About the Authors
Lawrence S.B. Goldstein, PhD: Larry Goldstein, director of the University of 
California–San Diego Stem Cell Program, is one of the United States’ foremost 
experts in stem cell research. He has studied genetics and cellular develop-
ment for 35 years and has an active laboratory research program studying 
Alzheimer’s and Lou Gehrig’s disease and possible uses of embryonic stem 
cells and their derivatives in treating these diseases. He has played an active 
role in national science policy, having served on many public scientifi c advi-
sory committees. He has testifi ed on a number of occasions before the U.S. 
House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate about National Institutes of 
Health funding and stem cell research. He also served as co-chair of the sci-
entifi c advisory committee to the campaign for the Proposition 71 stem cell 
research initiative, which authorized $3 billion in tax-free state bonds to fund 
stem cell research in California over 10 years. As a cofounder and consultant 
of the biotechnology company Cytokinetics, he also has had an active role 
in private industry, where he has gained experience in translating scientifi c 
insights into new therapeutic approaches.
In addition to the directorship of the Stem Cell Program, Larry is Professor 
of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at the UCSD School of Medicine and an 
Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Before moving to 
UCSD, he was assistant, associate, and full professor at Harvard University’s 
Department of Cellular and Developmental Biology.
He received his B.A. degree in biology and genetics from UCSD in 1976 and 
his PhD degree in genetics from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 
1980. He did postdoctoral research at the University of Colorado at Boulder 
and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
His awards include a Senior Scholar Award from the Ellison Medical 
Foundation, an American Cancer Society Faculty Research Award, the Loeb 
Chair in Natural Sciences when he was at Harvard University, election to the 
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the 2009 Public Service Award 
from the American Society for Cell Biology.

Authors’ Acknowledgments
Although our names appear on the cover, we can’t claim sole credit for this 
book. Publishing is a team sport. Those who think they played but a minor 
role did more heavy lifting than they realize, and we would be remiss if we 
didn’t give them a shout-out for their contributions.
We offer our thanks and appreciation to the following people:
The folks at Wiley, for recognizing the importance of arming readers with 
accurate, plain-English information about stem cells and for supporting this 
book to fi ll that need.
Our editors, Michael Lewis and Kelly Ewing, for their vision, patience, and 
dedication.
Our agent, Barb Doyen, for bringing us together on this project and acting as 
business partner, cheerleader, coach, and friend.
Mark Dixon, for (once again) standing at the ready throughout the process, 
administering support, comfort, and ice cream as needed.
Connie Holm, for advice, support, and inexhaustible patience.
Our friends and colleagues Juan Carlos Izpisua-Belmonte, Paul Berg, Sylvia 
Evans, Fred “Rusty” Gage, Catriona Jamieson, Lynda Heaney, Olle Lindvall, 
Sean Morrison, Jim Spudich, Kevin Wilson, and Laurie Zoloth, who pro-
vided vital encouragement to undertake and complete this project and who 
helped immensely with advice and input about science, ethics, medicine, 
law, business, regulation, and policy, and ways to present this material in as 
understandable and accurate a way as possible. Of course, any errors of fact, 
presentation, or interpretation are ours alone.

Introduction
I
n some ways, stem cell science represents a whole new world for medi-
cine. Although scientists still have much more to discover, we know more 
than ever before about how the human body works, how cells and tissues 
and organs work together, and what goes wrong in disease. Forty years after 
Neil Armstrong first stepped on the moon, we’re on the brink of another giant 
leap for mankind — only this time the new frontier is under a microscope 
instead of beyond the clouds.
Like most frontiers, stem cell territory is fraught with unfamiliar sights, unan-
ticipated perils, wrong turns, dead ends, and misadventures of all kinds. In 
an interview with TIME magazine, Owen Witte, director of UCLA’s Institute 
for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine, said, “Biology is more complicated than 
splitting the atom” because stem cell researchers have to figure out how to 
create the outcomes they’re seeking and how to measure the results at the 
same time.
Then there are the ethical considerations of stem cell research. For cen-
turies, scientists have been portrayed in fiction and fable as doing things 
because they can do them and ignoring the question of whether they should 
do them — a perception unfortunately cemented by a few highly publicized 
real-life scandals. The New York Times reported in 2007 that James Thomson, 
whose team first isolated human embryonic stem cells, thinks the controver-
sial aspects of the research may have kept talented scientists away from the 
stem cell field. In real life, most scientists and physicians are highly ethical 
people who would never consider creating a modern-day Frankenstein or res-
urrecting a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Most of these professionals shun the noto-
riety that comes with controversy, and few 21st-century scientific endeavors 
are more controversial than stem cell research.
Finally, there’s just a lot of confusion about what scientists have done, what 
they’re trying to do, and what they think they might be able to do in the 
future. Unfortunately, those critical distinctions aren’t always clear in media 
reports. During the Civil War, a Syracuse, New York, newspaper ran a column 
of battlefield gossip under the headline, “Important, if true.” In our opinion, 
the media should revive that disclaimer when it comes to stem cell reports 
because sometimes it’s hard to determine what’s true, what’s sort of true, 
what’s true but irrelevant, and what’s more or less wishful thinking.

Stem Cells For Dummies 
About This Book
We’ve written this book with three main objectives. First, we want to present 
the best available information on what stem cell research is and where it may 
lead in straightforward, easy-to-understand language. Throughout the text, 
we strive to leave the technical jargon to the scientific journals and translate 
the information into everyday English.
Second, we aim to dispel the persistent myths and misconceptions about 
stem cell research. (We even devote a chapter in the Part of Tens to common 
myths.) Many of these misconceptions are driven by the nature of mainstream 
media reporting; newspapers and even Web sites often don’t have the space to 
devote to truly complete explanations of what scientists are doing. And some-
times — not always, but sometimes — reporters don’t fully understand the 
story they’re covering, so factual errors enter the public debate as truth.
Finally, we want to lay out as fairly and objectively as possible the many 
perspectives and points of view about the morality and ethics of stem cell 
research. Naturally, we’re generally in favor of stem cell research (we don’t 
support some practices), but we recognize that opponents have many valid 
concerns and questions about the field and its implications for a conscien-
tious society. We don’t attempt to persuade you toward one opinion or 
another; we simply provide the arguments and counterarguments so that you 
can decide for yourself.
Conventions Used in This Book
For the sake of consistency and readability, we use the following conventions 
throughout the text:
 
✓ Technical terms appear in italics, with a plain-English definition or expla-
nation nearby.
 
✓ Keywords in bulleted lists and the action part of numbered steps are in 
bold.
 
✓ Web addresses are in monofont. (When this book was printed, some 
Web addresses may have been split into two lines of text. If that hap-
pened, rest assured that we haven’t inserted any extra characters (such 
as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using one of these Web 
addresses, just type exactly what you see in this book as though the line 
break doesn’t exist.)
 
✓ Many people use the words embryo and fetus interchangeably, or at least 
inconsistently, and, in fact, various dictionaries offer different definitions 
of embryo and fetus. For our purposes throughout this book, we generally 
use embryo to refer to stages of development from zygote up to blastocyst 

3
 Introduction
(see Chapter 4) — that is, stages that haven’t yet implanted in a woman’s 
uterus. We use fetus to refer to stages after implantation and generally 
after 8 weeks of development.
 
✓ We hedge on quite a few things, with phrases like “as far as we know” 
and “apparently can.” We include these qualifiers because, contrary to 
popular belief, science isn’t a collection of hard and fast facts; it’s a col-
lection of experiments, observations, and interpretations. We present 
the most accurate and up-to-date information available, but what’s accu-
rate today may not be accurate a year from now as scientists make more 
discoveries and as interpretations of observations evolve.
What You’re Not to Read
Like all For Dummies books, this one is organized so that you can find the 
information that matters to you and ignore the stuff you don’t care about. 
You don’t have to read the chapters in any particular order; each chapter 
contains the information you need for that chapter’s topic, and we provide 
cross-references if you want to read more about a specific subject. You don’t 
even have to read the entire book (but we’ll be delighted if you do).
Occasionally, you’ll see sidebars — shaded boxes of text that go into detail 
on a particular topic. You don’t have to read them if you’re not interested; 
skipping them won’t hamper you in understanding the rest of the text.
You also can skip any information next to the Technical Stuff icon. We 
explain most technical information in simple language and reserve the 
Technical Stuff icon for details that are interesting but not crucial to under-
standing the topic.
Foolish Assumptions
In researching and writing this book, we’ve made some assumptions about 
you, the reader. We assume that you
 
✓ Have a health condition (or a loved one with a health condition) for 
which stem cell research may produce effective treatments.
 
✓ Want to be able to separate the realistic possibilities stem cell research 
is opening up from overblown hype.
 
✓ Want straightforward information to help you understand various view-
points in the debate over stem cell science.

Stem Cells For Dummies 
 
✓ Are interested in understanding stem cell science, but don’t want to 
pursue a Ph.D. in the field.
 
✓ Want a convenient, comprehensive, and easy-to-understand resource 
that covers all this information without making you feel like a dummy.
How This Book Is Organized
For Dummies books are known for breaking a topic down into broad subtop-
ics so that you can easily find the information you want without having to 
slog through a lot of information you’re not interested in. For the highly com-
plex topic of stem cells, we split the information into the following parts.
Part I: Brushing Up on Biology
In this part, we give you an overview of stem cell science, as well as a primer 
on the structures and functions of human cells and tissues. We provide the 
basic information you need to understand how and why stem cell research-
ers do what they do in the lab and explain the apparently unique properties 
of different kinds of stem cells and why they inspire so much hope for treat-
ing or curing so many devastating illnesses.
Because the field has garnered so many headlines in recent years, many 
people think stem cell research is brand new. But today’s research is built 
upon decades — even centuries — of investigation into and discoveries 
about how living organisms work. So we also provide a brief recap of the his-
tory of stem cell science and show you how the research arrived at its cur-
rent point.
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science
One of the things that makes the stem cell debate confusing is that there are 
so many different kinds of stem cells. Even the names of different stem cell 
types can be misleading: “Adult” stem cells, for example, don’t always come 
from grownups, and “cloning” in this context usually refers to methods for 
making specific kinds of stem cells rather than creating a carbon copy of a 
human being.
In this part, we break down all the different types of stem cells and explain 
what they are, where they come from, and what scientists think each cell type 
can do. These chapters explore embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells, and 

5
 Introduction
alternative methods for creating and directing stem cells. We also cover the 
advantages and disadvantages of combining cells from different sources — dif-
ferent breeds and different species — and the scientific and ethical implica-
tions of such “cell swapping.”
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells 
Can Affect the Future
The potential for today’s stem cell research is huge. Researchers around the 
globe are aggressively pursuing lines of inquiry that may lead to revolution-
ary therapies for such devastating human ailments as cancer, Lou Gehrig’s 
and Parkinson’s diseases, diabetes, and heart disease.
The chapters in this part look at the stem cell research for these and other 
diseases. We tell you what scientists have discovered so far and what they 
think their discoveries mean for the future. We show you how and why stem 
cells hold such exciting possibilities for developing effective treatments and 
explain the challenges researchers have to overcome before patients can 
actually begin to receive stem cell-based treatments.
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today
Not all stem cell therapies are products of the distant future. Doctors rou-
tinely use some stem cell therapies to treat leukemia and severe burns, 
and researchers are testing methods for treating other cancers, diabe-
tes, heart disease, and multiple sclerosis. In 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration approved the first clinical trial for an embryonic stem cell-
based therapy for people with spinal cord injuries.
Meanwhile, interest in banking stem cells (from a variety of sources) has 
exploded. We tell you how stem cell banking works and what you need to 
know if you’re considering preserving your own (or a loved one’s) stem cells.
Part V: Understanding the Debate: 
Ethics, Laws, and Money
Stem cell research raises a complex series of moral, ethical, and philosophi-
cal questions that politicians, religious leaders, and the general public have 
been debating for years. In this part, we cover the various viewpoints and 
arguments — pro and con — on different kinds of stem cell research and 
explain where there seems to be common ground and where the deep divi-
sions are.

6
Stem Cells For Dummies 
We also provide a summary of current laws and policies in the United States 
and abroad, as well as the events and forces that led to their enactment. And 
we explain how stem cell research gets funded and the issue of who owns the 
rights to things like genes and specific stem cell lines.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is one of the most popular features of For Dummies books 
because it condenses lots of information into small, easily digested nuggets. 
In this part, we explore popular myths and misconceptions about stem cells 
and ten challenges to using stem cells in routine medical therapies. We also 
look at ten exciting possibilities for the future of stem cells.
Finally, we give you ten essential things you need to do before you seek stem 
cell treatment for yourself or a loved one.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the text, you see icons that alert you to certain types of informa-
tion. Here’s a glossary of those icons and what they mean:
 
We use this icon to indicate procedures you should follow if you’re looking for 
stem cell-based treatments or considering banking stem cells.
 
This icon highlights important information you should keep in mind about 
stem cell research, especially if you haven’t yet formed an opinion on the 
merits, morality, or ethics of the science.
 
This little bomb alerts you to information that may have been misreported or 
misconstrued in the media, as well as potential dangers that often are played 
down or overlooked in news reports.
 
With a topic like stem cell research, you might expect every paragraph to be 
marked with this icon; after all, it’s a pretty technical subject. But our job is to 
make the topic easy to understand, so you’ll only find this icon next to a few 
details that are more technical than the rest of the text.

7
 Introduction
 
Even in the gee-whiz-evoking field of stem cell research, some things stand out 
as particularly nifty. We use this icon when we tell you about funky machines, 
awe-inspiring biological processes, and other things that make us say, “How 
cool!”
 
Myths and misconceptions about stem cells and the people who study them 
are varied and plentiful. This icon identifies information that may not agree 
with what you’ve heard or that provides important clarification of potentially 
vague points.
Where to Go from Here
The beauty of For Dummies books is that, unlike textbooks, you don’t have to 
read earlier chapters to understand the information in later chapters. Where 
you start reading about stem cells is entirely up to you.
If you want to understand why stem cell research is so controversial, turn to 
Chapter 15 for a discussion of moral and ethical questions surrounding the 
science. If you’re curious about where embryonic stem cells come from and 
what they can do, start with Chapter 4. If you’re interested in receiving stem 
cell-based therapy for yourself or a loved one, go to Chapter 21 to find out 
what you need to know before you sign up. And if you’re thinking of banking 
stem cells for future use, check out Chapter 14 to understand the process 
and the pros and cons.

S
tem cell research has a long history, but it has come 
under intense public scrutiny only in the past decade 
or so. Research involving human embryonic stem cells is 
at the root of most of the controversy surrounding stem 
cell science. (Research on fetal tissue and fetal stem cells 
also is controversial in some circles.) In this part, we pro-
vide an overview of stem cell research, as well as a primer 
on cells and tissues and how they work in the human 
body.
We also explore the history of stem cell science, revealing 
what the ancients knew about regenerating body parts in 
humans and other animals and what scientists have dis-
covered about how cells operate in living organisms. We 
show you how understanding DNA and other cellular 
mechanisms have helped researchers combat diseases 
like leukemia and how today’s scientists are building on 
that body of knowledge to tackle other health issues.

of Stem Cell Science
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring the foundations for stem cell science
▶ Understanding what researchers know now
▶ Looking at what scientists still need to discover
S
ome stem cells researchers shake their heads in bemusement at the 
sudden public interest in their field. Thirty years ago, no one outside the 
scientific community had ever heard of stem cells. Today, stem cell scientists 
are sort of like the overnight singing sensations who have been performing at 
local nightclubs for years and suddenly has a No. 1 hit on the national charts. 
The general public has no idea how much work that singer put in before she 
was “discovered.” Similarly, many people aren’t aware of how much stem cell 
researchers have discovered about normal biological development and dis-
ease, or how those years of research have led them to the experiments and 
discoveries that are touted in the headlines today.
Finally, many people are unaware of how far stem cell research still has to go. 
Although scientists know a lot about human development, the workings of 
various genes, and the behavior of certain diseases, a lot of questions remain 
unanswered. And these aren’t esoteric questions, either; they’re questions 
like why some cells in the body’s tissues never become specific cell types, 
what signals or mechanisms direct those cells to become active, and how 
cells malfunction in disease.
In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of what stem cell scientists have 
been doing all these years before their work generated such widespread 
interest. We explain why scientists do so much work with mice, fruit flies, 
and other animals, and how they translate their findings in animal studies 
into predictions (and subsequent testing to confirm those predictions) about 
what happens in humans. We also inventory the things that researchers think 
they know about various kinds of stem cells, as well as the things they’re still 
trying to figure out.

Part I: Brushing Up on Biology 
Working with Animals 
and Other Organisms
Humans are a lot like yeast. No, this isn’t the start of one of those joke e-mails 
your coworkers send you on a quiet Friday afternoon; it’s a biological fact. 
Humans also are a lot like fruit flies, mice, and other animals and organisms 
that have eukaryotic (pronounce you-CARE-ee-ah-tic) cells — cells that have 
a distinct nucleus encased in a membrane. (Prokaryotic cells, such as those in 
bacteria, don’t have a compartmentalized nucleus, but rather a less-defined 
nucleoid region that contains their DNA.) Amazing as it sounds, at the cellular 
level, many of the pathways and functions of eukaryotic cells are the same no 
matter what organism the cells are in.
 
Scientists have shown that some of the genes in yeast will function in human 
cells, and vice versa. This interchangeability of genes among different organ-
isms is called conservation; that is, nature uses many of the same blueprints 
and mechanisms, at least at the cellular level, for a wide range of living crea-
tures. In fact, different organisms are so similar at the cellular level that many 
of the genes that cause certain kinds of cancer were first discovered and stud-
ied in yeasts and fruit flies.
When it comes to fruit flies and worms, not only are the pathways inside cells 
very similar to those in humans, some of the pathways for communicating 
between cells or for instructing a cell to specialize are similar. For example, 
scientists know what genes are turned on in order to make a human neuron 
and wire it so that it communicates properly with other cells and tissues 
in part because they’ve studied these genetic mechanisms in fruit flies and 
worms.
 
Just because fruit flies don’t look like humans — or just because fruit flies 
are insects and humans are mammals — doesn’t mean they don’t share some 
characteristics. From a scientific perspective, fruit flies, mice, and humans are 
like different motorized vehicles. Fruit flies are motorcycles; mice are compact 
cars; and humans are luxury sedans. The details of how you put each of these 
vehicles together differ greatly, but many of the basic mechanisms are the 
same, and a lot of the parts are the same (although they may not be the same 
size). And, in some cases, some of the parts are even interchangeable, as in 
the case of yeast and human genes.
Obviously, you can’t take the throttle from a motorcycle and install it in a 
luxury sedan. But when the throttle on the motorcycle breaks, sometimes 
it can tell you a lot about how the Cadillac’s acceleration mechanism might 
break. The same principle is what leads scientists to spend so much of their 
time working with yeasts, worms, fruit flies, and mice. These approaches are 
important because, in many cases, experimenting on human beings is unethi-
cal; the risks are too great.

 Chapter 1: Painting the Broad Strokes of Stem Cell Science
Understanding the mouse’s 
role in stem cell research
The mouse has arguably been the most important animal in stem cell 
research. In the early 1960s, Canadian researchers James Till and Ernest 
McCulloch were the first to prove that bone marrow contained stem cells. 
They exposed mice to high doses of radiation to kill the mouse’s blood- and 
immune-forming system and then injected bone marrow cells into some of 
those mice. The mice that didn’t receive new bone marrow cells died; the 
mice that received the transplants lived because the new bone marrow cells 
rebuilt their blood- and immune-forming systems.
Till and McCulloch also noted that the mice that received transplants devel-
oped small but visible nodules, or lumps, on their spleens, and that the sizes 
of the nodules were directly proportional to the number of bone marrow 
cells the mouse received in the transplant. The scientists theorized that 
these so-called spleen colonies originated with a single cell from the bone 
marrow transplant — perhaps a stem cell. They later proved that theory and, 
as their work continued, also proved that some cells in bone marrow are 
capable of reproducing themselves as well as generating specific cell types.
 
Till and McCulloch’s work on mice is the basis for human bone marrow trans-
plants, which are routinely used today to treat leukemia and some other kinds 
of blood disorders (see Chapter 13).
Embryonic stem cells also were first isolated from mice. In the early 1980s, 
researchers learned how to extract the inner cells from mouse blastocysts — 
a hollow ball of cells that forms a few days after an egg cell is fertilized — and 
grow them in Petri dishes or other containers. When these cells are grown 
properly (a process called culturing), they reproduce themselves — or self-
renew; they don’t adopt the characteristics of specialized cells until they’re 
exposed to the appropriate biochemical signals. That work formed the foun-
dation for isolating human embryonic stem cells in 1998, which in turn led to 
the “overnight sensation” phenomenon the field is experiencing today. (See 
Chapter 4 for more on embryonic stem cells.)
Using mice in today’s labs
The mouse is still a critical component of many stem cell laboratories. 
Researchers manipulate mouse genes to see how specific genetic changes 
affect normal development or the progression of a disease. They create mice 
with defective immune systems so that they can inject them with human 
tumors to study different forms of cancer (see Chapter 8). And researchers 
focusing on leukemia and other diseases of the blood still study how abnor-
mal blood cells and normal blood cells interact in mouse models of these 
diseases.

14
Part I: Brushing Up on Biology 
Researchers also test potential drugs and other therapies on mouse models. 
Till and McCulloch proved that you can save a mouse whose own blood- and 
immune-forming system has been destroyed by giving it an injection of new 
bone marrow stem cells. Patients with certain forms of leukemia and immune 
diseases undergo basically the same treatment today: Doctors kill their 
blood- and immune-forming systems with high doses of chemicals and radia-
tion and then save the patient by injecting them with blood-forming stem 
cells that, ideally, settle into the patient’s bone marrow and begin generating 
new blood cells — including the immune cells that normally circulate in the 
bloodstream. (Chapter 13 describes this process in detail.)
New discoveries from work on the mouse are announced all the time, and 
most of those discoveries have implications for how researchers can go 
about treating human ailments. The following sections describe two recent 
examples of this kind of work.
Figuring out how cells make skin
One of the key questions in stem cell research has been how stem cells know 
when it’s time to stop reproducing themselves and start producing special-
ized cells for the tissue in which they reside. In some cases, stem cells seem 
to be able to divide into two structurally different cells — one that remains 
a stem cell and another, called a progenitor cell, that goes on to generate 
specialized cells. In other cases, though, a stem cell creates two progenitor 
cells — essentially giving up its ability to reproduce itself so it can create 
specialized cells instead. The details are still unclear, so this area of research 
is quite active, and it’s important because work with skin cells reveals a lot of 
information about what may happen in other organ systems.
In most instances, researchers believe that certain proteins and other signal-
ing or controlling molecules are responsible for directing cell specialization 
(although they still don’t fully understand the signals that tell stem cells to 
produce progenitor cells). But, because the human body has some 200 dif-
ferent cell types, isolating the specific proteins (or other elements) that are 
responsible for creating each type of specialized cell is a monumental task.
In the past few years, researchers have identified some of the proteins that 
tell stem cells in the base layer of the skin to generate new skin cells. These 
discoveries relied on genetic engineering techniques in mouse embryos to 
turn off the genes that create specific types of proteins. When those mice 
were born, their skin was sometimes so badly deformed that it couldn’t con-
tain water, and the newborn mice quickly died of dehydration.
 
Although researchers are actively working to identify the specific mol-
ecules that control normal skin development, a lot of questions still remain 
unanswered, including how stem cells know when to make more skin cells. 

15
 Chapter 1: Painting the Broad Strokes of Stem Cell Science
Scientists know that skin stem cells make the decision to produce new skin 
cells daily because you shed dead skin cells every day and, if the stem cells 
in your skin didn’t create replacement skin cells, you’d suffer the same fate 
as the genetically engineered mice. But the precise mechanism that tells stem 
cells to make more skin cells remains unknown.
Determining the role immune cells play in certain diseases
Researchers have recently discovered some of the genes that control cre-
ation of special immune cells in the blood known as Natural Killers, or NK 
cells. NK cells, a type of white blood cell, are formed by stem cells in the bone 
marrow, and they roam throughout the bloodstream, seeking out and attack-
ing cells that are contaminated with cancer-initiating mutations, viruses, or 
harmful bacteria.
Researchers have long wondered whether NK cells play a pivotal role in auto-
immune diseases like Type 1 diabetes (in which the immune system attacks 
and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas), multiple sclero-
sis, and other diseases. The theory is that maybe NK cells turn into rogues, 
attacking everything in sight instead of limiting their activities to truly 
infected or otherwise dangerous cells.
Some work suggests that it’s possible to disable the genes that control NK 
cell production in mice, creating mice with no NK cells in their bodies (but 
all the other normal blood and immune cells). The mouse model gives scien-
tists another tool for figuring out whether NK cells really are the bad guys in 
various autoimmune diseases and what role they play in inflammation, drug-
resistant infections, and even transplant rejection. Knowing the genes that 
control NK production also opens the door to finding possible drug or gene 
therapies for autoimmune diseases.
Finally, researchers can use this mouse model to study potential new treat-
ments for cancer. If certain chemicals can induce stem cells in the bone 
marrow to produce extra NK cells to attack tumors (but not healthy cells), 
such drugs may eventually reduce the need to use radiation and other chemi-
cals that kill both cancerous and normal cells.
 
Any time you read of a new therapy or exciting development in stem cell 
research, you can almost guarantee that it came about through work on 
mouse or other animal models of the disease or developmental process. And 
researchers still use layers of specially treated mouse skin cells as a base on 
which to grow human embryonic stem cells. Scientists and bioengineers are 
investigating other methods to grow these cells, because using mouse cells 
raises concerns about contaminating the human cells with viruses or other 
unwanted elements, but, so far, mouse skin cells seem to be the most reliable 
for growing human embryonic stem cells.

Exploring What Scientists Know (And 
Don’t Know) About Stem Cells
You could write a book on what researchers have already discovered about 
stem cells. (Oh, wait — we did, and you’re reading it!) But even with all the work 
that’s been done over the past 40 years or so, there are still quite a few holes in 
the body of stem cell knowledge. Some of those holes are pretty big, too.
Other chapters in this book detail what’s known and unknown about stem 
cells in specific contexts. In the following sections, we provide an overview of 
what scientists have figured out about stem cells in general, and what they’re 
still trying to discover about them.
Understanding stem cells’ key properties
Stem cells have two key characteristics that distinguish them from other 
types of cells: They can reproduce themselves for long periods (self-renewal), 
and they can, under certain conditions in the body or in the lab, produce 
cells that eventually become specific types of cells — a process known as dif-
ferentiation or specialization.
The following sections discuss what scientists know and don’t know about 
embryonic and adult stem cells.
Looking at the unique abilities of embryonic stem cells
 
Embryonic stem cells don’t technically exist in an embryo. In the normal 
course of development, the blastocyst fuses with the uterine wall, and the 
inner cell mass begins growing into all the different cell types of the fully 
developed body (see Chapter 4). In other words, although the cells in the 
inner cell mass grow and divide, they don’t create more of themselves; 
instead, they create daughter cells that, in their turn, create cells with the 
structures and other elements they need to do their specific jobs. By the time 
a baby is born, his body doesn’t have any cells that precisely mimic the cells 
in the inner cell mass — at least as far as researchers know.
In the lab, scientists can extract the inner cell mass from blastocysts that are 
created in the lab (not in a female’s body) and prevent those cells from going 
through this specialization process. When these cells are grown properly, 
they renew themselves virtually indefinitely and never develop the unique 
characteristics of specialized cells (unless they’re prompted to do so through 
changes in their growth environment). This process of developing stem cell 
lines from the inner cell mass is called derivation.

 Chapter 1: Painting the Broad Strokes of Stem Cell Science
Scientists are investigating a number of methods to induce embryonic stem 
cells to differentiate into specific cell types. Some methods work pretty well; 
others aren’t as reliable. But the ability to create the kinds of cells you want 
is enormously important in studying development and disease, and espe-
cially in testing potential treatments, because it allows you to study human 
cells and tissues instead of relying on animal sources. While animal models 
are useful and animals and humans share many biological characteristics, 
you don’t really want to do all your hands-on training on a beater car if you 
plan to fix a luxury sedan.
Exploring adult stem cells
Although a fully developed body apparently doesn’t normally have cells that 
can give rise to any type of cell, it does have some self-renewing cells that 
can generate specific types of differentiated cells. Researchers call these cells 
adult stem cells, to reflect the fact that they live in fully formed tissues. (The 
term adult stem cells has caused some confusion because they’re in fetal 
tissues as well, so some researchers prefer to call them tissue stem cells or 
somatic stem cells; see Chapter 5 for more information.)
Researchers have found adult stem cells in a variety of tissues. The best-
known are skin stem cells and blood-forming stem cells, but stem cells also 
have been identified in fatty tissue, the intestines, the liver, the lungs, and 
skeletal muscles, as well as in the brain, blood vessels, and even, it appears, 
in the heart muscle. Their job seems to be to replenish tissue cells as they 
wear out or die from age or normal wear and tear.
 
Researchers don’t fully understand the signals that induce adult stem cells 
to form, or the signals that control their behavior. How do adult stem cells 
decide when it’s time to renew themselves or make differentiated cells? With 
a few exceptions — notably skin and blood-forming stem cells — most adult 
stem cells seem to be inactive most of the time. On the face of it, you could 
assume that these cells don’t do anything until they’re activated by disease or 
injury. But if that were the case, why don’t stem cells in the brain, for example, 
leap into a flurry of activity when someone suffers a stroke or sustains a head 
injury in a car accident? One possibility is that those stem cells actually do 
become active in response to an injury but don’t have enough repair capac-
ity to heal the injury. Another possibility: Stem cells in the brain don’t have 
a repair function, but instead play a role in storing new information. Clearly, 
researchers need to do a lot more work to figure these things out.
Finally, some adult stem cells may be able to generate cells outside their own 
tissue type — a phenomenon called transdifferentiation. In the early 2000s, 
several research groups reported that certain kinds of blood-forming cells, 
which typically only create blood cells, can transdifferentiate into other 
kinds of tissue cells, including heart cells, brain cells, and liver cells. Further 
investigation, though, revealed that other processes may have been at work 
in those experiments.

18
Part I: Brushing Up on Biology 
 
Most stem cell scientists aren’t convinced that stem cells actually can go out-
side their normal tissue types to produce other kinds of cells. Experiments 
haven’t provided clear answers yet. If you inject blood-forming stem cells into 
a damaged heart muscle and the heart muscle gets better, does that mean the 
blood-forming stem cells began generating new heart muscle cells? Or did the 
blood-forming stem cells send signals to the heart’s own stem cells and stimu-
late them to repair the tissue? Or did the blood-forming stem cells fuse with 
cells in the heart muscle and therefore adopt some of the structure and func-
tion of the heart muscle cells? No one knows for sure, and until researchers 
better understand what’s really happening, these kinds of procedures are 
unlikely to become standard treatment.
Confirming that cells really are stem cells
Okay, you’ve extracted the inner cell mass of a blastocyst, put it in a dish 
with the appropriate chemicals and feeder cells, and let the cells grow and 
divide for a while. Or you’ve taken samples of the areas in skin where skin 
stem cells hang out and induced them to grow and divide for a while. How do 
you know that what you’ve grown really are stem cells?
Scientists use a number of strategies for demonstrating that suspected stem 
cells really are what the scientists think they are. For embryonic stem cells, 
researchers may do one or more of the following:
 
✓ Grow them for several months to ensure that they really are self-renewing.
 
✓ Examine the cells’ surfaces, looking for markers that occur only in undif-
ferentiated cells.
 
✓ Look for the presence of the OCT-4 protein and other signaling mol-
ecules typically produced by undifferentiated cells.
 
✓ Inject them into immune-compromised mice to see whether they form 
teratomas, a special kind of benign tumor that contains cells from all 
three main tissue layers (see Chapter 2).
To identify adult stem cells, scientists usually use one or more of the follow-
ing techniques:
 
✓ Attaching special markers to cells in the tissue and seeing what kind of 
cells they generate
 
✓ Removing the cells from a living animal, such as a mouse, labeling 
them with special markers (see Chapter 4) and then injecting them into 
another animal to see whether they repopulate their specific tissue type
 
✓ Using genetic engineering methods to induce the cells to grow and 
divide in a dish and then inventorying the types of cells the original cells 
become

19
 Chapter 1: Painting the Broad Strokes of Stem Cell Science
 
Not all stem cell researchers agree on which verification methods are the 
most useful or which ones should be standard for confirming that cells are 
indeed stem cells. This area of the science is still evolving, with different crite-
ria needed for different types of cells; as researchers learn more about the 
cells themselves, it should become more clear which criteria are the most 
important for positively identifying cells as stem cells.
Figuring out how to use stem cells
In broad terms, researchers use stem cells to study development — both 
normal development of specific systems in the body and how diseases start 
and what happens as they progress. They’ve used stem cells to identify the 
so-called master genes that tell cells what to do and when to do it, as well 
as transcription factors, the proteins that turn those genetic instructions on 
and off. This kind of basic research helps scientists figure out how individual 
cells and collections of cells are supposed to work and what goes wrong in 
disease.
Armed with that knowledge, scientists can target their search for possible 
treatments to specific mechanisms. For example, researchers have discovered 
that cells that support motor neurons — the nerve cells that control move-
ment — seem to play a critical role in Lou Gehrig’s disease (see Chapter 9). 
Now they’re working on ways to counter the possibly damaging activity of 
those supporting cells, such as replacing them with transplanted cells or find-
ing drugs that rescue the motor neurons or reverse the toxicity of neighboring 
cells.
In some cases, stem cells may act as delivery agents instead of actually fixing 
a problem themselves. They could be used to deliver missing enzymes to the 
cells in the brain, for example, or growth factors that prod the body’s own 
stem cells to begin making new specialized cells. Scientists also can use stem 
cells to reconstruct diseases in the lab and study those diseased cells to 
understand the molecular abnormalities that cause or lead to disease.
And, someday, stem cells may be used to grow replacement tissues — or 
even whole organs — in the lab. (Turn to Chapter 20 for ten reasonable pos-
sibilities in using stem cells for medical treatments.)
Looking at some unanswered questions
Scientists have been studying adult stem cells for more than 40 years and 
embryonic stem cells for more than 20 years. They’ve uncovered a lot about 
both kinds of stem cells, but there’s a lot they still don’t know.

20
Part I: Brushing Up on Biology 
Questions researchers are still seeking answers to include the following:
 
✓ How many kinds of adult stem cells are there?
 
✓ Where do adult stem cells live in specific tissues?
 
✓ What control mechanisms do stem cells use to maintain their self-
renewal capabilities?
 
✓ What genetic mechanisms control stem cells’ ability to make one or 
more kinds of differentiated cells?
 
✓ Why don’t adult stem cells differentiate automatically when they’re sur-
rounded by differentiated cells?
 
✓ Why can embryonic stem cells grow and make more of themselves in the 
lab for a year or more, while most adult stem cells have far more limited 
self-renewing capabilities in a Petri dish?
 
✓ How do stem cells know when to make more of themselves and when to 
make cells for specific tissues?
 
✓ Why don’t all stem cells “home in” to their proper location the way 
blood-forming stem cells do when they’re transplanted into a living body 
(see Chapter 13)?
 
✓ If you introduce stem cells into specific tissues in a living body, do 
they stay where you put them, or do they wander aimlessly around the 
body’s tissues?
 
✓ How long do transplanted stem cells stay in the body?
 
✓ If you reprogram adult cells to behave like embryonic stem cells (see 
Chapter 6), are the reprogrammed cells completely normal, or does the 
reprogramming process mess with the genetic instructions?
 
✓ In their normal environments (known as niches), can adult stem cells 
really make differentiated cells for tissues other than their tissue of 
origin?
 
✓ Is there a master adult stem cell — one that, like embryonic stem cells, 
can make any type of cell in the body?
 
Modern stem cell science is pretty young, so it’s not surprising that research-
ers still don’t know the answers to some relatively basic questions. As Lao 
Tzu, the father of Taoism, is credited with saying, “The wise man knows he 
doesn’t know.”

ells are the basic units of biology, the individual bricks in the construc-
tion of all living organisms. They pack a lot of power into their infinitesi-
mal size, too. They reproduce, communicate, and cooperate with each other 
and carry out their assigned tasks to sustain all the functions of a plant or 
animal that, compared to them, is like Mount Everest to a fruit fly. An adult 
human body consists of trillions of cells that make up the skeleton, muscles, 
organs, blood, and all other tissues.
Scientists have made great strides, especially in the past 50 years, in figur-
ing out how cells do what they do. They’ve identified more than 200 distinct 
kinds of cells in the human body, each with its own special job to perform. 
Scientists also know some of the ways in which cells talk to each other and 
are learning how to manipulate various kinds of signals to get cells to act 
in specific ways. This knowledge provides insight into both normal human 
development and what goes wrong in disease and injury.
In this chapter, we give you a primer on cell structure and function, show-
ing you how cells read and implement their genetic programs and how they 
transfer information. We tell you how cells work together to form tissues, 
how tissues work together to form organs, and how organs work together to 
form complete systems. Finally, we introduce you to stem cells and explain 
what makes them stand out from the cellular crowd.
Exploring Cell Structure and Function
Cells are like tiny balloons filled with chemicals and water. The nucleus of a 
cell contains nearly all the genetic information. The watery material inside 
the cell (but outside the nucleus) is called the cytoplasm; the cytoplasm 

22
Part I: Brushing Up on Biology 
contains organelles (miniature organized functional units) that have specific 
functions within the cell. Mitochondria, for example, are organelles that con-
tain tiny bits of DNA (inherited only from the mother) and function as energy 
factories for the cell. The cell membrane, its outer barrier, is thin and flexible 
like a balloon, but strong enough to keep the cytoplasm and other internal 
materials from leaking out and to keep material on the outside of the mem-
brane from getting in. Figure 2-1 shows the basics of cell construction.

The human body contains more than 200 different types of cells, and each 
cell type has a specific job to do to keep the entire body functioning nor-
mally. Think of your body as a mall, and each type of human cell as a store 
with its own special product or service. If you need insulin, you go to the 
Pancreatic Beta Cell store. For communication services, you go to the Brain 
Cell store. To pump blood, you go to the Heart Cell store.
To keep your body working the way it’s supposed to, many of these specialty 
cell stores refresh their inventory periodically by growing and dividing. Cells 
grow by taking up sugar and other nutrients from their environments and 
by creating other components through a process called synthesis. Then they 
divide to make more cells. In symmetric division, one cell divides into two iden-
tical cells, called daughter cells. As the cell prepares to divide, the amount of 
genetic material doubles, so each of these daughter cells has all the genetic 

23
 Chapter 2: Understanding Cells and Tissues
material of the original cell and half the other contents — proteins, sugars, 
fats, organelles, and so on — of the original. In asymmetric division, the daugh-
ter cells are different from each other; descendants of one daughter cell may 
become red blood cells, for example, while the other daughter cell’s descen-
dants may become white blood cells.
 
Ordinarily, cell growth and division are tightly controlled; cells divide only 
when they get a signal that it’s time to split. When growth and division get out 
of control, that’s a step on the road to cancer. Scientists know about several 
mechanisms that keep cell growth and division in check, and they’re working 
on figuring out why those controls fail — and how to repair them — in cancer 
(see Chapter 8).
Beyond their basic construction and reproduction methods, cells can differ 
dramatically in order to carry out their functions. Although all the cells in 
your body have the same genetic code, they come in all different sizes; they 
read and implement different parts of the genetic code; they use different 
methods to import and export essential nutrients and other materials; and 
they communicate in different ways. The following sections discuss these 
functions and why they matter.
Sizing cells
 
Cells typically are measured in microns, or thousandths of millimeters (or ten 
thousandths of an inch). One inch equals 25,400 microns. Blood cells generally 
are between 5 and 10 microns in diameter, so you could line up 2,540 to 5,080 
of them between the tip and first knuckle of your index finger. Muscle cells may 
be long enough to be measured in centimeters or inches, but are only a few 
microns wide, like the long balloons magicians use to make balloon animals.
Motor neurons, the nerve cells that control movement, are the biggest cells 
in the human body, with “wires” measuring more than 3 feet long. They have 
a unique structure, too. Consider a motor neuron that allows you to wiggle 
your toes, for example. Part of that neuron is in your spinal cord; it’s called 
the cell body. Dendrites, which receive signals for the neuron, surround the 
cell body. The cell body has an axon, sort of like an electrical wire, that 
extends down your leg and into your toes. The axon transmits signals that 
tell the muscles in your toes to flex and relax so that you can wiggle your 
toes. (All neurons have axons; sensory neurons, for example, have sensory 
axons that sense heat, pressure, pain, and so on.)
If you scaled the toe-wiggling motor neuron’s dimensions in feet instead of 
microns, the cell body would be about 20 feet wide, the size of a large living 
room. The axon would be like a hallway off the living room, 3 to 5 feet wide, 
leading to the muscles in the toes. And the hallway itself would be 200 miles 
long.

24
Part I: Brushing Up on Biology 
Other cells provide support to neurons and motor neurons so that they func-
tion properly. For example, oligodendrocytes help create myelin, the fatty 
sheath that allows neurons to conduct electrical signals properly. In motor 
neurons, special cells called Schwann cells provide myelin for the motor and 
sensory axons. Astrocytes supply some nutrients and clean up excess signal 
molecules. And the synapse is the point where two neurons almost touch to 
conduct signals from the axon of one neuron to the cell body or dendrite of 
another neuron.
Figure 2-2 shows the structure of neurons in the brain, motor neurons in the 
spinal cord, and sensory neurons.

This difference in size among various cell types presents some challenges 
for stem cell researchers. Small cells that have a defined location in an 
organ, such as heart muscle cells or cells in the eye, are presumably easier 
to replace with stem cell derivatives than, say, motor neurons, which have 
to grow long axons from your spinal cord to your toes. Eventually, scientists 
may figure out a way to create replacement motor neurons that grow reli-
able axons and send those axons to the correct place. But, for the time being, 
most researchers are focusing their efforts on developing and transplanting 
smaller, less structurally challenging replacement cells.

 Chapter 2: Understanding Cells and Tissues
Decoding cell messages: DNA and RNA
Each cell’s nucleus contains deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA — the genetic 
material that controls what individual cells do and, when cells interact, what 
the whole organism (such as the human body) does. DNA is like a big library, 
and an individual cell’s activity depends on which parts of the library it 
reads. Pancreatic cells read a different part of the library than brain cells, for 
example, and brain cells read a different part than heart cells.
All plants and animals have genomes — a library of DNA. The human genome 
has about 3 billion letters, labeled A, T, G, or C, which are arranged in 23 
pairs of chromosomes — threadlike strands of DNA that carry genes — and 
30,000 or so genes. While different individuals are identical at most of the 3 
billion letters, the arrangement of the letters can differ at key sites in the DNA 
strands. These differences account for variations in appearance between 
individuals, as well as other traits like susceptibility to certain diseases and 
responses to certain drugs.
Ribonucleic acid, or RNA, translates the DNA library for individual cells and 
determines which parts of the library get used. RNA comes in several forms and 
does the bulk of its work in the cytoplasm of the cell with the help of proteins. 
(See the section “Exploring Cell Structure and Function,” earlier in this chapter.)
 
If you think of a cell as a construction site, the DNA represents the architect’s 
plans. The RNA is the site supervisor, who interprets the architect’s plans, 
recruits proteins, and tells the proteins which parts of the plans to work on. 
And the proteins are the laborers who build the appropriate structures and 
run the appropriate chemical reactions.
Scientists know quite a bit about how DNA and RNA work, but they’re always 
discovering more. The idea is that if you can identify which parts of the DNA 
library are read or built incorrectly in a genetic disorder such as Niemann-
Pick Disease (see Chapter 9), that information will help you figure out how 
to fix the problem, or even prevent it. These two elements — identifying the 
genetic problem and figuring out how to fix it — drive important parts of 
today’s stem cell research.
Covering entrances and exits: 
How things get in and out of cells
If John Donne had known about cells, he may have written “No cell is an 
island,” instead of “No man is an island.” Single-celled organisms, like some 
yeasts and bacteria, don’t have to communicate, cooperate, or interact with 
other cells; everything they need to do to ensure proper functioning happens 
inside the organism’s single membrane (although even yeasts and bacteria 
communicate with other cells under some circumstances).

26
Part I: Brushing Up on Biology 
But in multicelled organisms like human beings, cells must exchange informa-
tion, as well as signaling molecules, to keep the entire body working the way 
it should. Pancreatic beta cells, for example, create insulin, but if the insulin 
stays inside those cells, it can’t circulate throughout the body and instruct 
other cells to absorb sugars.
So how do cells let some information or signaling molecules escape without 
spilling their entire contents? After all, if you poked a hole in a balloon, all 
the air inside would eventually leak out. And, conversely, how do cells take 
in information or signaling molecules from other cells without being flooded 
with a lot of extraneous material? The following sections describe how cells 
release certain substances and take in material from outside the membrane.
Getting stuff out
Generally, cellular proteins do all their work within the confines of the cell’s 
membrane. But some have special abilities to go outside the cell membrane. 
They cross the membrane in one of two ways:
 
✓ The proteins get inside vesicles, which look something like tiny soap 
bubbles. When the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane, it can dump 
its contents outside the cell. Imagine a bus at a border crossing between 
the United States and Mexico. While the bus doors are closed, the 
people inside have to stay inside. But when the bus arrives at the border 
crossing, the driver opens the doors, and the people inside can get out 
of the bus and step into Mexico. (We’re simplifying here. This process 
is very complicated, and the people who figured it out have won lots of 
Nobel prizes for doing so.) Figure 2-3 shows what a protein-filled vesicle 
looks like and how it discharges its cargo outside the cell.
 
✓ The proteins go only partway into the vesicle. When the vesicle fuses 
with the cell membrane, the protein is partially outside and partially 
inside the cell, like a bus halfway across the U.S.–Mexico border. The 
protein acts as an antenna, sending or receiving signals by touching 
other cells or coming in contact with the materials other cells release. 
So, for example, when a protein antenna on a muscle cell comes in con-
tact with insulin, the antenna signals the muscle cell to absorb sugars in 
the bloodstream. Figure 2-4 shows a protein antenna.
Letting stuff in
Some materials, like certain hormones, can cross a cell’s membrane without 
any help from proteins; they more or less soak in, sort of like water soaking 
through a rug, into the floor beneath, and, eventually, through the ceiling of 
the room below.

Part I: Brushing Up on Biology 
Other materials need help getting into cells, though, and that help comes 
from proteins inside the cell. These proteins use two main mechanisms to 
bring outside matter inside a cell:
 
✓ By creating portals in the membrane. Picture a medieval castle. The 
moat around the castle is like the membrane around the cell. When visi-
tors come to the castle, guards ensure that the visitors belong in the 
castle before they lower the drawbridge and let the visitors cross the 
moat. In cells, certain proteins act as castle guards, controlling access 
through the cell membrane. They open little pores in the cell membrane 
for certain things, like salts, some sugars, and amino acids, but close 
those pores against material that doesn’t belong in the cell.
 
✓ By attracting specific molecules to receptor sites on the membrane 
surface. Some protein antennae act as receptors for specific molecules 
or substances. For example, cholesterol travels from your liver to your 
other tissues in little protein packages called lipoproteins. These lipo-
proteins search for specific receptors on the surface of the cell; when 
the lipoprotein attaches itself to the receptor, the membrane essentially 
folds itself over the lipoprotein and absorbs it. Once inside the cell, the 
lipoprotein interacts with other molecules to release the cholesterol. 
Figure 2-5 illustrates this process.

29
 Chapter 2: Understanding Cells and Tissues
 
If cells weren’t able to exchange information and signaling molecules, all crea-
tures would be single-celled organisms. And if scientists didn’t know how cells 
communicate and cooperate with each other, they wouldn’t be able to use 
stem cells to generate specific types of cells (see Chapters 4 and 5).
Understanding how cells communicate
Scientists have identified four major ways in which cells communicate with 
each other:
 
✓ Diffusible signals, in which a cell releases a substance into the blood-
stream, such as insulin, which then binds to a receptor on another cell 
to send instructions (insulin tells other cells to absorb sugar)
 
✓ Electrical signals, in which cells communicate via miniscule electrical 
currents
 
✓ Tactile signals, in which cells or protein antennae (see the previous sec-
tion) get messages or instructions by touching other cells or the sub-
stances in the spaces between cells
 
✓ Mechanical signals, in which cells respond to being bent or flexed; for 
example, when the antennae on cells in your ear bend, the cells send a 
signal that your brain interprets as sound
 
Because scientists know what these signals are and how they work, they 
can use them to tell stem cells (and other cells, for that matter) what to do. 
Scientists use one set of signals to tell a stem cell to wait to divide until the 
appropriate time, and then to become a brain cell, for example. Then other 
signals tell that new brain cell how to function, to maintain its current state, 
and so on. Manipulating these signals helps scientists see what goes on in 
normal development and provides clues to what goes wrong in disease.
Building Tissues and Organs
In the human body, cells almost always touch lots of other cells, forming 
tissues. (The main exception is the bloodstream, where many blood cells 
bounce off each other but often roam alone, without touching many, if any, 
other cells.) Tissues in turn combine to form organs like the heart, brain, 
liver, eyes, and so on.

30
Part I: Brushing Up on Biology 
Tissue comes in four main types:
 
✓ Epithelial tissue, which forms linings for organs like the stomach and 
intestines and for the body as a whole in the form of the outer layer 
of skin.
 
✓ Connective tissue, which provides structure and support in the form 
of bone, tendons, ligaments, and fat, among other things.
 
✓ Muscle tissue, which contracts and relaxes to generate movement.
 
✓ Nerve tissue, which generates and conducts electrical impulses to 
control all bodily functions.
 
Researchers have discovered stem cells in all four types of human tissue, 
including nerve tissue — which was once believed to be incapable of new 
growth. Although each type of tissue has only a small number of stem cells, 
these small stem cell pools generate enough new cells for their respective 
tissues to last a lifetime. (Read “Comparing Stem Cells to Other Kinds of Cells,” 
later in this chapter.)
Organs comprise at least two kinds of tissue and may have several different 
kinds of cells with different functions. Your heart, for example, has three 
main layers: the epicardium, loose connective tissue that protects the heart 
muscle while giving it plenty of room to beat; the myocardium, or muscle 
layer, composed of contracting cells (cells beat — expanding and contracting 
like a rubber band that’s stretched and released — individually on a micro-
scope slide, cooperatively in your heart); and the endocardium, another layer 
of loose connective tissue inside your heart with a smooth surface that facili-
tates the even flow of blood through the heart’s chambers.
Likewise, your pancreas has different types of cells. The islets of Langerhans, 
for example, contain five different cell types, including beta cells, which pro-
duce insulin. Figure 2-6 shows the pancreas and how beta cells release insulin 
into the bloodstream.
Every organ in your body has its own unique structure that’s critical to the 
function of that organ. Your stomach, for example, is designed to take in 
food and liquids and break them down into components the rest of your 
body can use. So your stomach has an entryway and an exit, and its lining is 
constructed so that the acids that break down food don’t destroy the lining 
or other stomach tissues. The tissues in your eyes, on the other hand, don’t 
have to take in or excrete food, and the protective layers around your eyes 
don’t have to interact with bodily acids, so they’re constructed differently.
 
Organs work together to create organ systems — another thing that would be 
impossible if cells couldn’t communicate with each other. (See “Understanding 
how cells communicate,” earlier in this chapter.)

The human body has ten major organ systems:
 
✓ Circulatory: Heart, blood vessels, and blood work together to transport 
nutrients throughout your body and carry away waste products, such as 
carbon dioxide.
 
✓ Digestive: The mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large 
intestine allow your body to take in and absorb nutrients from food and 
drink.
 
✓ Endocrine: A collection of glands (adrenal, pituitary, thyroid, and so 
on) send and relay chemical messages through your body and work 
with the nervous system to control certain functions, such as growth 
and metabolism.

✓ Excretory: The kidneys, ureters (tubes that carry urine from the kidneys 
to the bladder), bladder, and urethra (the tube leading from the bladder 
to the genitals) are your body’s janitorial crew, gathering up cellular 
waste, toxins, and excess water and expelling them.
 
✓ Immune/lymphatic: Lymph nodes, lymph vessels, white blood cells, and 
other blood cells are on a continual search-and-destroy mission against 
foreign invaders. The lymphatic system also cleans your blood of excess 
fluids and fat.
 
✓ Muscular: Skeletal muscle is attached to the bones in your body and 
helps you move. Smooth muscle lines the inside of all major organs 
(except the heart) and helps things (like food) move through those 
organs. Cardiac muscle, which is different from both skeletal and smooth 
muscle, keeps your heart beating.
 
✓ Nervous: Your brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves send electrical 
signals back and forth to control voluntary and involuntary movement. 
(Wiggling your toes is voluntary; the beating of your heart is involun-
tary.) Hormones and other signaling molecules also influence these sig-
nals; adrenalin, for example, puts your entire body on alert for danger, 
increasing your heart rate and dilating your blood vessels to get more 
oxygen to your muscles in preparation for fighting or running away (the 
so-called fight or flight response), among other things.
 
✓ Reproductive: Mature males produce sperm, and mature females pro-
duce egg cells. When a sperm cell and an egg cell fuse, they can go on 
to create a fetus. (See Chapter 4 for more on this process.) In males, the 
reproductive system comprises the testes, seminal vesicles (the glands 
that create seminal fluid), and the penis. In females, the reproductive 
system consists of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina.
 
✓ Respiratory: Your nose, trachea (windpipe), and lungs allow your body 
to pull in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. Your circulatory system 
works with your respiratory system to distribute the oxygen to the rest 
of your body and get rid of carbon dioxide.
 
✓ Skeletal: The skeleton is your body’s frame, providing support and pro-
tection for your internal organs. The skeletal system consists of bones, 
cartilage, ligaments, and tendons.
 
All your body’s organ systems work together to keep you functioning the way 
you’re supposed to. Normally, when something goes wrong in one organ or 
system, other systems respond to help deal with the situation. Say you cut 
your finger. The pain you feel is actually a red alert to your brain, prompting 
you to get away from the cause of the pain and protect the damaged tissue. 
(Think about how quickly you snatch your hand away from a piece of paper 
when you get a paper cut.) In response to the red alert, your brain sends sig-
nals to increase your heart rate and blood pressure (unless the cut is severe, 
in which case your brain lowers your blood pressure to help prevent further 
blood loss).

33
 Chapter 2: Understanding Cells and Tissues
Meanwhile, your endocrine system releases hormones to control inflam-
mation and provide additional energy to cope with the injury. Blood cells 
begin clotting. Your immune system sends troops to quell any harmful invad-
ers that may have entered your body through the wound. By the time the 
severed blood vessels have constricted to slow or stop the bleeding, the 
injury site is teeming with a massive (microscopically speaking) emergency 
response crew that immediately begins assessing the damage, cleaning up 
the mess, and rebuilding tissues.
Scientists have figured out a lot about how this complex process works, but 
they’re a long way from being able to duplicate the smooth interaction of bil-
lions of cells. Stem cell research is exciting, in part, because it offers a unique 
window into how cells develop and communicate, so scientists can see — and 
perhaps, eventually, fix — what goes wrong when disease or injury strikes.
Comparing Stem Cells 
to Other Kinds of Cells
In plants, stems are the center of plant growth, giving rise to leaves, flowers, 
and fruit. In animals, stem cells are the unique cells that give rise to other 
types of the body’s cells, such as skin, blood, and nerve cells. Stem cells fall 
into two main categories:
 
✓ Embryonic stem cells can give rise to any type of cell in the adult body 
(see Chapter 4).
 
✓ Tissue stem cells — commonly, though inappropriately, called adult stem 
cells — live in many of your body’s tissues and can make any type of cell 
in that particular tissue (see “Building Tissues and Organs,” earlier in 
this chapter, and Chapter 5).
Like other kinds of cells, stem cells grow by dividing. In the lab, embryonic 
stem cells divide to keep reproducing themselves until they’re coaxed into 
creating specific types of cells (see Chapter 4). In the body, the cells gener-
ated early in development start with the potential to make any kind of cell. 
But as development progresses, the cells become more and more specialized, 
so a human baby or adult body no longer contains cells that can generate any 
kind of cell. Instead, the adult body contains tissue stem cells in a variety of 
different tissues.
Like other cells, tissue stem cells reproduce by dividing. However, the daugh-
ter cells aren’t always identical to each other. In general (there are a few 
exceptions), when a stem cell divides, one of the daughter cells remains a 
stem cell, and one becomes a blood cell or a skin cell, or what have you. This 
ability to create two different kinds of cells through division is an important 
feature of stem cells. It’s also essential to the body’s maintenance-and-repair 

34
Part I: Brushing Up on Biology 
functions: Stem cells create more of the cells the body needs, so they also 
have to reproduce themselves to ensure that there’s always a pool of stem 
cells to make other kinds of cells. Figure 2-7 shows in general terms how stem 
cells reproduce themselves and generate other cell types.

Stem cells have two key properties that distinguish them from other kinds 
of cells:
 
✓ They can create more of themselves (self-renew) for long periods.
 
✓ They can generate specialized, or differentiated, cells.
So how do stem cells do both — make more of themselves and make differen-
tiated cells? Either through asymmetric division (see the section “Exploring 
Cell Structure and Function,” earlier in this chapter) or by going through a 
burst of self-renewal, after which some of the new stem cells go on generate 
specific cell types.

35
 Chapter 2: Understanding Cells and Tissues
 
Stem cells’ typical job is to replenish cells and tissues that are lost or shed in 
the usual course of events — that is, through normal wear and tear, or some-
times as a result of injury or disease. Skin is a good example of this process. 
You shed skin cells every day; in fact, shed skin makes up a good portion of 
common household dust. If your body didn’t replace those lost skin cells, your 
blood would leak out. So stem cells in your skin continue to replenish them-
selves (a process called self-renewal) and to make new skin cells throughout 
your life.
Similar processes take place all over your body. Stem cells in your stomach 
and intestinal tissue replace those cells as needed, and stem cells in your 
bone marrow make new blood cells to replace those that wear out and die 
off. You even have stem cells in your brain — the one organ that researchers 
long assumed had no capabilities for regrowth. So far, scientists have verified 
stem cell caches in bone marrow, the brain, the heart, the liver, the reproduc-
tive system (both male and female), skeletal muscles, skin, and teeth.
This ability to replenish dead or damaged cells is at the core of stem cell 
research. Scientists are trying to understand exactly how all kinds of stem 
cells work and how to manipulate them into doing specific things, such as 
creating new insulin-producing cells or repairing damage to myelin, the pro-
tective sheath that covers parts of nerve cells. (You can read more about 
stem cells’ capabilities in Chapters 4 and 5 and about research on potential 
medical therapies in Chapters 9, 10, and 11.)

Tracing the History 
of Stem Cell Research
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at ancient ideas and the research they inspired
▶ Figuring out heredity and genetics
▶ Charting notable developments: transplants, fertility treatments, and cloning
T
he term stem cell has made its way into general usage only in the past 
decade or so, and, to many people, stem cell research is a new, untested, 
and even frightening endeavor. In truth, though, everything researchers know 
today about stem cells — and stem cells’ potential for medical therapies — is 
built on centuries of observations and discoveries about biology in a broad 
array of organisms. Even the ancients knew that certain animals could grow 
new limbs, for example. History is replete with stories (many undocumented) 
of transplants and other medical miracles dating from a time when the bio-
logical “cell” wasn’t even a concept, much less part of anyone’s vocabulary.
In this chapter, we recap three separate but intertwined histories of research 
into how living things work. One is the history of ideas about regeneration, 
the ability to regrow body parts that are damaged through injury or disease. 
Another is the history of discovering how certain traits are passed from one 
generation to the next and decoding the inner workings of cells. The third is 
the history of medical advances since the 1950s, when new knowledge and 
surgical methods sparked an explosion of now-commonplace procedures like 
organ transplants and fertility treatments.
All these ideas and concepts played a role in leading stem cell research to 
its status today. In fact, all of them have a role in directing today’s research 
toward a variety of potential future uses, such as growing organs and tissues 
for transplant.

Regenerating Body Parts: 
Legends, Tales, and Truths
Almost since humans began talking, they’ve been sharing stories — some 
true, some clearly not true, and many based on a kernel or two of fact, embel-
lished and adorned to make a good, gripping tale. Many of the earliest stories 
indicate that the people who told them had observed certain peculiarities in 
the world around them, such as the ability to grow new body parts, and wove 
those observations into their legends and myths.
Of course, regeneration — the ability to regrow body parts that are damaged 
through injury or disease — isn’t merely the stuff of fiction. Lots of animals 
can regrow body parts; some can even grow whole new animals from bits of 
themselves. Even humans have some regenerative capabilities. The follow-
ing sections provide an overview of some popular regeneration myths and 
lesser-known facts — and how they hinted at the existence of stem cells long 
before stem cells were discovered.
Taking a look at ancient 
regeneration myths
Two ancient Greek myths are particularly relevant to stem cell research and 
the idea of using stem cells to grow new body parts: the story of Prometheus’s 
eternally regenerating liver, and the tale of the many-headed Hydra.
According to Greek mythology, Prometheus created humans (according 
to some versions of the story) and taught them such skills as astronomy, 
mathematics, medicine, and navigation. Zeus, the leader of the Greek gods, 
resented Prometheus for empowering humans and took fire away from the 
mortals. When Zeus discovered that Prometheus had snuck down to earth 
to return the gift of fire, he ordered Prometheus chained to a boulder in 
the mountains, where a large bird of prey spent the daylight hours eating 
Prometheus’s liver. At dusk, the bird flew away, and Prometheus’s liver grew 
back overnight so that the bird could feast again the next day.
 
Scientists now know that the human liver can regenerate itself, even if 
as much as three-quarters of the liver tissue is damaged. In fact, as far as 
researchers know, the liver is the only internal organ that can generate a com-
plete organ from a fraction of the original tissue. Prometheus’s story is widely 
viewed as an indication that the ancient Greeks knew that livers (but not other 
organs) could grow back — something they may have observed from treating 
battle-wounded soldiers.

39
 Chapter 3: Tracing the History of Stem Cell Research
Another Greek myth concerns regrowing heads — something the Greeks 
clearly did not observe in humans. But they may have observed it, or some-
thing similar, in other animals. In any case, the phenomenon made its way 
into a story about Hercules.
As penance for killing his children in a blackout induced by an angry god-
dess, Hercules had to perform a series of seemingly impossible tasks known 
as the Labors of Hercules. One of these tasks was to slay the noxious many-
headed Hydra, a sea creature whose breath was poisonous and whose nine 
heads grew back when they were cut off. (In some versions, two heads grew 
back to replace a lost one.) Hercules eventually destroyed the creature by 
cauterizing the Hydra’s necks so that new heads couldn’t grow back.
No one really knows where the idea of the many-headed beast came from, but 
researchers have known for centuries that some creatures can regenerate 
body parts and even whole new bodies. Other animals that can regenerate 
include certain types of worms, frogs, lizards, and crustaceans. (See the next 
section, “Looking at animals that can regenerate.”) Early Greek storytellers 
may have observed regeneration among certain animals and used it as the 
basis for the tale of the Hydra.
Looking at animals that can regenerate
In the 1700s, Abraham Trembley of Switzerland (sometimes considered the 
father of experimental zoology) discovered a small creature that attaches 
itself to plants in fresh water and uses its tentacles to capture and eat prey. To 
figure out whether this creature was a plant or an animal, Trembley conducted 
a series of experiments, including ones in which he split the creature halfway 
down the center. The result: Two heads grew back. In one of his experiments, 
Trembley induced one of these creatures to regenerate seven heads. Thinking 
he had discovered a new species, he called the creatures polyps; today, they’re 
known as hydra, which refers both to their habitat (hydra comes from the Latin 
word for water) and the beast of Greek mythology.
Over the centuries, scientists (and curious children) have found a number of 
animals that can regenerate body parts, including
 
✓ Crayfish: When crayfish lose a claw or leg, they grow new ones. In fact, 
crayfish have special break-away joints so that when a predator grabs a 
claw or leg, the appendage breaks at the base, allowing the crayfish to 
escape.
 
✓ Earthworms: If you cut an earthworm in half, the head end will grow a 
new tail. Interestingly, in some earthworm species, the tail end, if it sur-
vives, also grows another tail, so it eventually starves to death.
 
✓ Frogs: Adult frogs don’t generate new legs, but the hind legs in frog tad-
poles can grow back.

40
Part I: Brushing Up on Biology 
 
✓ Newts and starfish: When newts or starfish lose a leg, they grow new ones.
 
✓ Planaria (a half-inch long flatworm): You can cut Planarian worms into 
as many as 32 pieces, and each piece will grow into a complete worm 
with head, tail, mouth, eyes, and all internal organs. Scientists now know 
that these types of worms have huge numbers of stem cells all over their 
bodies, and those stem cells seem to be able to grow into any type of 
cell the worm needs at any time during its life.
 
All animals, including humans, have at least limited regeneration powers. (For 
more on human regeneration, see the next section.) Younger organisms gen-
erally are more adept at regenerating body parts than older ones, and some 
simpler organisms (like earthworms) do it more easily than more complex 
organisms like humans.
You do it, too: Regenerating 
human skin and blood
Humans don’t have the same regeneration capabilities as starfish and cray-
fish; if you chop an arm off a human, it doesn’t grow back. But your body 
does regenerate some things. If you lose a fingernail, for example, your body 
grows a new one. If you break a bone, your body creates new bone tissue to 
mend the fracture. Other human tissues that regenerate include blood (gen-
erated by bone marrow), liver, and skin.
Red and white blood cells eventually wear out and die off, so stem cells in 
your bone marrow create new supplies of these cells. And the human liver 
has quite remarkable regenerative abilities. (See “Taking a look at ancient 
regeneration myths,” earlier in this chapter.)
Stem cells in the skin generate new skin to replace the cells you lose every 
day and to cover minor wounds, such as a scrape or shallow cut. In more 
serious wounds, your body creates scar tissue in addition to new skin. In 
severe burns, the skin stem cells are destroyed, leaving the body’s skin 
regeneration system crippled. The loss of skin stem cells explains why treat-
ing and healing burns is so challenging — and the presence of skin stem cells 
in other parts of the body explains why skin grafts are sometimes successful 
in repairing burned areas.
 
No one has yet figured out the biological mechanisms that allow some human 
tissues to regenerate and not others. Clearly, humans and the various animals 
who do grow new body parts have significant biological differences. Even 
more puzzling, though, is why your liver can regenerate itself, but your kid-
neys and heart (among other organs) don’t seem to have that ability. Stem 
cells may hold the answer to creating new tissues that the body doesn’t regen-
erate, if scientists can figure out how to activate the proper mechanisms to 
grow those tissues in the lab.

41
 Chapter 3: Tracing the History of Stem Cell Research
Discovering the Genetic Controls in Cells
Since 1665, when English scientist Robert Hooke put forth the idea that all 
living things are made up of cells (though he didn’t know what cells consisted 
of), researchers have explored many facets of cell structure, function, and 
behavior. Among the many questions those early researchers tried to answer 
was the basic one of heredity, or how certain characteristics pass from one 
generation to another. Of course, everyone knew that cats have kittens, dogs 
have puppies, and humans have human babies — a fact scientists call conti-
nuity. But how species create more of only their own species was the subject 
of much theorizing and debate.
The following sections provide a brief recap of the important theories and 
discoveries that led to today’s understanding of how cells, including stem 
cells, work the way they do.
Comparing ideas about heredity
In the early 1800s, French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed the 
idea that acquired characteristics — that is, traits the parent acquired 
during its lifetime, as opposed to traits the parent was born with — could 
be passed on to the next generation. For example, a cat who lost an ear or 
a leg in a fight, Lamarck thought, would give birth to kittens missing ears 
or legs. This idea of soft inheritance was part of Lamarck’s theories about 
evolution and how adaptation to the environment leads to more (or less) 
use of specific characteristics.
In the mid-1800s, German biologist August Weismann disproved Lamarck’s 
theory of soft inheritance. (He chopped the tails off 20 generations of rats 
and noted that not a single offspring was born with any abnormality in the 
tail.) Instead, Weismann argued, heredity must be controlled by the germ 
plasm — contained in the reproductive cells of an organism. In humans (and 
other mammals), the female egg cell and the male sperm cell constitute the 
germ plasm.
The question then became whether other cells contain hereditary informa-
tion. Weismann believed that only germ cells passed information and traits 
from one generation to the next; he argued that no other cells have access to 
the full range of information in the germ cells. In other words, his theory was 
that brain cells had the material they needed to be brain cells, and skin cells 
had the material they needed to be skin cells, but neither had the material to 
become anything else.
Today, scientists know that, in general, most cells carry the entire genetic 
code for an organism; however, normal cells read and implement only the 
portion of the code that applies to their particular specialization.

42

Unlike most cells, some types of immune cells have regions of DNA that are 
different in organization than other cells in your body. Immune cells use a 
unique process to shuffle, mix, and match certain parts of the genetic material 
to create antibodies and other molecules involved in immune system function.
Today’s technology for cloning cells and even organisms (see “Cloning ani-
mals,” later in this chapter, as well as Chapter 7) is the direct result of 150 
years of research into how genetic material works. In fact, technologies for 
cloning DNA, cells, and animals developed over time as a way to answer fun-
damental questions about how cells and organisms work and whether every 
cell contains a complete set of genetic material, or whether genetic informa-
tion is lost when cells develop into their specific type and carry out their 
specific jobs.
Understanding DNA
Although scientists in the 1800s knew that something inside cells was respon-
sible for heredity, they didn’t know what that something was. In 1868, Swiss 
biologist Friedrich Miescher conducted chemical studies on cell nuclei 
(pronounced noo-klee-eye, the plural of nucleus) and discovered a sub-
stance consisting of acids and proteins that he called nuclein. Miescher (and 
others) believed the acidic portion of the nuclein was important in heredity. 
However, others argued that heredity must come from the proteins in the 
nuclein because the proteins are much more diverse than the acidic portions. 
The protein proponents believed such diversity was necessary to create the 
astounding range of specific cells and tissues in an organism.
Scientists in the acid and protein camps debated their respective theories 
for decades. Then, in 1943, a group of scientists at the Rockefeller Institute 
proved that the acidic portion of nuclein — what today is called DNA — is 
the bearer of genetic information. Many of the proteins in nuclein, including 
proteins called histones, are responsible for packaging and controlling access 
to the DNA.
 
Since the 1940s, scientists have proved that DNA is the hereditary agent in vir-
tually all organisms. RNA viruses are the only exception. RNA viruses include 
those that cause the common cold and more serious infections, such as hepa-
titis A, C, and E, HIV, West Nile, and yellow fever. These viruses store their per-
manent genetic information in the RNA instead of in the DNA. (See Chapter 2 for 
more on DNA and RNA.)
 
If you stretched the DNA from one human cell flat on a table, the thread would 
be about 6 feet (2 meters) long, but only 2 nanometers (billionths of a meter) 
wide. If you placed all of the DNA in a human adult end to end, you could wrap 
it around the earth’s equator 1 million times or more. But because DNA is 
coiled so tightly in the cell nucleus, scientists couldn’t figure out how it copies 
itself during each cell division without breaking apart. After all, you can’t get 

43
 Chapter 3: Tracing the History of Stem Cell Research
to the end of a spool of thread without either unwinding the entire spool or 
cutting through the outer layers of thread. Scientists also were puzzled about 
how such a long molecule could be packaged into tiny nuclei.
In the 1950s, two teams of scientists — Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins 
at London’s Kings College, and Francis Crick and James Watson at Cambridge 
University — figured out the basic structural features of DNA. The structure 
in turn provided hints about the mechanism that allows DNA to be copied 
multiple times (that is, every time a cell divides) without losing its structural 
integrity. Franklin found evidence of DNA’s spiral, or helix, structure; Watson 
and Crick built on her evidence to propose that DNA is actually a double 
helix and that each strand is a template for the other. When cells divide, the 
two strands of DNA separate and build new companion strands from their 
own templates. Figure 3-1 shows how DNA replicates when a cell divides.

Mapping the genetic library
For 50 years, researchers have worked on decoding every bit of information 
in the DNA of various organisms, trying to figure out where specific genes 
are located in the double helix structure and which genes control which cell 
traits and behaviors. So far, scientists have mapped genomes (the entire 
genetic library) for many organisms, including mice, horses, cattle, pigs, 
chickens, sheep, apes, and humans, as well as crops like rice and certain 
types of moss, fungus, and bacteria. In fact, the genomes of mice, worms, and 
fruit flies serve as important research models to understand general prin-
ciples of genome structures and functions.
 
All humans are virtually identical to each other over most of their genomes; 
this “near likeness” is what distinguishes humans as a separate species from 
other animals, including nonhuman primates. Against this background of 
substantial similarity, however, individuals vary significantly in a number of 
regions of their genetic makeup. Your genome may be different in important 
ways from your best friend’s genome, for example, or even from your Uncle 
Charlie’s genome. These differences in genomes account for variations in 
appearance, susceptibility to disease, and drug sensitivity among individuals. 
See the nearby sidebar, “Genomes and epigenomes,” for more on differences 
among individual human genomes.
The differences in individual genomes explain, among other things, why 
some people are tall and some are short, why some go bald and some don’t, 
and so on. More important, at least from a medical science perspective, is 
that some of these genetic differences between people may ultimately deter-
mine whether they’re more or less susceptible to certain diseases and how 
their bodies respond to drugs and other treatments. Genetic differences also 
explain why one person’s body rejects cells, tissues, and organs from other 
people and why doctors have to suppress transplant patients’ immune sys-
tems. (See “Transplanting organs and tissues,” later in this chapter.)
Discovering growth factors
Scientists have known for decades that glands in the human body produce 
growth factors or hormones, especially steroids like estrogen and testoster-
one, that induce cells to grow and divide and that turn genes on and off in cells. 
But the identities of the factors that stimulate cell growth and division — and 
how those factors worked — was more or less a mystery until after World War 
II. In the 1950s, Italian neuroscientist Rita Levi-Montalcini and American bio-
chemist Stanley Cohen discovered nerve growth factor, a special protein that 
certain cells release to induce nerve cells to grow. Cohen later isolated epider-
mal growth factor, which prompts skin cells and other types of cells to grow 
(and which appears to be a factor in some cancers).

45
 Chapter 3: Tracing the History of Stem Cell Research
Scientists now know that many types of growth factors activate (or suppress) 
signaling proteins in cells (see Chapter 2) to tell cells when to grow — or, 
paradoxically, when to stop growing. Sometimes growth factors even tell 
cells what type of cell to become; scientists use some types of growth factors 
in the lab, for example, to tell stem cells to grow into nerve cells.
Growth factors are important in healing wounds; epidermal growth factor, for 
example, spurs the creation of new skin cells to heal cuts and scrapes. In the 
lab, researchers use a variety of growth factors to get stem cells (and other 
kinds of cells) to grow, divide, and differentiate into specific cell types.
Identifying stem cells
The concept of stem cells — and even the term — dates back to the mid-
1800s. Medical and scientific articles throughout the latter half of the 19th 
century discussed the idea that certain special cells give rise to several dif-
ferent types of cells, especially in blood. Scientists knew that human blood 
contains several different types of cells, and they theorized freely about the 
properties stem cells would need to generate all the different kinds of blood 
cells.
Genomes and epigenomes
All plants and animals have genomes made of 
DNA. In humans, the genome has about 3 bil-
lion letters (A, T, G, or C) arranged in 23 chromo-
somes and 30,000 or so genes. While different 
individuals are identical at most of the 3 billion 
letters, they can differ at key sites in the DNA 
strands.
In 2003, the Human Genome Project (HGP), an 
international research endeavor, announced 
that it had mapped and determined the coding 
information common to the genes of all people. 
Because every person’s genome has many 
unique features, the HGP’s map really defines 
which gene sequences all humans have in 
common, as well as some genetic differences 
among individuals, based on the individual 
genomes of a few anonymous donors. And, 
in fact, the “complete” map released in 2003 
covers only about 92 percent of the human 
genome; researchers think that the remaining 
DNA doesn’t contain any genes, but that theory 
hasn’t been absolutely proven yet.
Today, researchers are working on figuring out 
how genetic instructions are read, decoded, 
and delivered. They’ve discovered that pro-
teins that surround DNA contain a layer of 
information that controls access to the genes 
in the DNA. This layer of information is called 
the epigenome, and it works a bit like a secu-
rity guard at a concert or football game. The 
security guard lets you go to your seat but 
keeps you from going to a different section of 
the arena. Likewise, the epigenome allows a 
cell to access the genetic information it needs 
to do its job, but blocks access to the rest of the 
genetic library. All the cells in your body have 
the same genome, but each cell has a differ-
ent epigenome that allows the cell to make and 
deliver its particular product or service.

But proof of stem cells’ existence didn’t come until the 1960s. Canadian scien-
tists James Till and Ernest McCulloch were the first to report direct evidence 
that a single cell from bone marrow could generate copies of itself and mul-
tiple types of blood cells — the modern definition of stem cells.
 
Twenty-five years after Till and McCulloch’s experiments, Irving Weissman 
and his colleagues purified blood-forming stem cells in mice and showed 
that these cells can regenerate a mouse’s entire blood-forming and immune 
system. In 1992, Weissman and his colleagues showed that humans have simi-
lar blood-forming stem cells with the same capabilities. He and other scien-
tists have since isolated human stem cells in skin, neurons, and several other 
tissues. (See Chapter 5 for more on tissue stem cells.)
Recapping Developments 
Since the 1950s
The Industrial Revolution led to extraordinary technological advances — new 
developments that, in just a few decades, irrevocably changed civilization as 
we know it. Biology and medicine began undergoing a similar transformation 
in the 1950s, when post-World War II advances led to exponential leaps in 
understanding how cells work in the body and developing treatments for a 
variety of diseases.
In the following sections, we recap some key developments in medicine and 
cellular biology — organ transplants, fertility treatments, and cloning tech-
nology — and explain how they relate to today’s stem cell research and the 
potential for even better medical therapies in the future.
Transplanting organs and tissues
People have attempted organ transplants and the equivalent of plastic 
surgery since ancient times. A 16th-century Italian wonder-worker named 
Gaspare Tagliacozzi was the first documented successful plastic surgeon. He 
regularly repaired nose, ear, and other facial injuries — the results of war-
fare, duels, and syphilis — with a technique called autografting, or taking skin 
from another area of the body and grafting it onto the injured area.
Successful transplants using another person’s organs and tissues were 
rare before the 1950s, and even the ones that worked weren’t unqualified 
successes. In 1954, Joseph Murray performed the first successful kidney 
transplant; it worked because the donor and recipient were identical twins, 
so their genetic architecture was identical, and the recipient’s body didn’t 
reject the new kidney. Until the 1970s, when researchers developed effec-
tive immune-suppressing drugs, most other transplants failed — many 

47
 Chapter 3: Tracing the History of Stem Cell Research
within only a few weeks — because the recipient’s immune system inevitably 
attacked and destroyed the new organ or tissue. (The nearby sidebar, “When 
organ transplants were experimental,” discusses the qualified successes of 
early transplant surgery.)
Today, of course, organ and tissue transplants are fairly common. Patients 
regularly receive donated hearts, lungs, kidneys, and livers, as well as bone 
marrow, corneas, heart valves, and veins, among other things. (See Chapter 
13 for more on donating organs and tissues.)
 
Bone marrow transplants are considered to be the first stem cell transplantations. 
Thanks to Till and McCulloch, scientists knew that — in mice, anyway — you 
could use radiation to kill the blood-forming system and essentially resuscitate 
the patient (or mouse) by transplanting bone marrow that contains blood-form-
ing stem cells. The first successful bone marrow transplant in humans followed 
that model; the patient, who had leukemia, underwent radiation therapy to kill 
off the blood-forming system and then received a bone marrow transplant from 
the patient’s identical twin.
When organ transplants were experimental
Even before anyone knew about the human 
body’s immune system or how it worked, 
scientists and doctors knew that something 
prevented the body from using organs or tis-
sues from other people. (This phenomenon, of 
course, isn’t unique to humans; other animals, 
including mice, have the same rejection issues, 
which scientists have studied extensively 
to better understand how rejection works in 
humans.) Organ and tissue rejection didn’t keep 
doctors and researchers from trying trans-
plants, though. In the 1800s, scientists carried 
out organ transplants in animals; the first suc-
cessful cornea transplant, for example, was 
done on a gazelle in the 1830s. In 1905, a Czech 
doctor carried out the first successful human 
cornea transplant, and in 1926, a Serbian man 
became the first to receive a donated testicle.
After Joseph Murray performed a successful 
kidney transplant between identical twins in 
1954, surgeons all over the world tried to trans-
plant other organs. In general, the first organ 
transplants were experimental and of only lim-
ited success. For example, a lung cancer patient 
received a new lung in 1963, but died of kidney 
failure only 18 days after the transplant. Likewise, 
the first successful heart transplant patient sur-
vived for only 18 days after his surgery in 1967. 
Of the more than 100 people who received heart 
transplants in 1968 and 1969, few lived longer 
than two months after their surgeries.
In 1970, researchers discovered chemicals 
that suppress the human (and animal) immune 
systems, and transplants evolved from last-
resort experimental procedures to life-saving 
surgery. By the mid-1980s, two of every three 
heart transplant patients lived for five years or 
longer after their transplants.
Today, although correctly modulating the 
immune system still presents challenges, the 
bigger issue for many patients is the lack of 
suitable organ and tissue donors.

Part I: Brushing Up on Biology 
Overriding the body’s immune system
Although no one knew anything about the body’s immune system in the 15th 
century when Gaspare Tagliacozzi was performing skin grafts (see the pre-
ceding section), he knew that his technique worked only with the patient’s 
own skin. If he tried to use another person’s skin, the patient’s body would 
usually reject the graft quickly.
Overriding immune responses is still a challenge four centuries after 
Tagliacozzi practiced. The human body’s immune system is designed to 
destroy and expel foreign invaders like unfriendly bacteria and viruses. 
When it detects a major invasion, such as a new kidney or heart, the immune 
system goes into full battle mode, relentlessly attacking the foreign organ 
or tissue. Today, transplant surgeons use powerful drugs that suppress the 
patient’s immune system and allow the body to accept the “foreign” material. 
Immune-suppressing drugs work wonders in transplants, but they carry risks, 
too: Patients typically have to take the drugs for the rest of their lives, and, as 
a result, their bodies are more susceptible to even minor infections that can 
cause serious health problems.
Keeping a transplanted donor’s immune system in check
The transplant recipient’s immune system isn’t the only one transplant 
surgeons have to control. When bone marrow is used as a donor tissue, 
for example, it generates an immune system from the donor, and then the 
patient is the invader. The phenomenon of donor immune cells attacking the 
patient’s body is called graft-versus-host disease.
Interestingly, a little bit of graft-versus-host disease is useful in some trans-
plants. Certain kinds of leukemia, for example, are treated with bone marrow 
transplants. The procedure involves killing as many of the leukemia cells as 
possible with toxic chemicals and radiation and then transplanting stem cells 
in the bone marrow from another person; those stem cells then form blood and 
immune cells that carry the donor’s genetic makeup. Doctors use drugs to tweak 
the recipient’s immune system so that, for the most part, the recipient’s body 
accepts the new blood-forming and immune cells. In many cases, the donor 
immune cells can then attack any leukemia cells that survived the chemical and 
radiation treatments — thus contributing to the success of the therapy.
 
Research has shown that most transplants among identical twins work 
exceedingly well because no adverse immune response occurs. But bone 
marrow transplants between identical twins generally aren’t as successful in 
treating leukemia as transplants between closely matched (but not genetically 
identical) donors and patients. Bone marrow transplants between identical 
twins don’t generate any graft-versus-host disease, so leukemia cells that sur-
vive after the transplant can still cause disease in the transplant recipient.

49
 Chapter 3: Tracing the History of Stem Cell Research
Understanding how stem cells could revolutionize transplants
Because some types of stem cells can generate so many other kinds of cells, 
researchers envision a day when doctors can grow, say, new heart valves for 
a patient with heart disease. These custom-made valves could even be grown 
from the patient’s own stem cells, thus erasing the immune barrier; the 
new valves would have the same genetic code as the original valves, so the 
patient’s immune system wouldn’t see the new valves as foreign.
 
Surgeons are already showing how stem cells can revolutionize their jobs 
in certain situations. In November 2008, a team in Europe saved a young 
woman’s life by building and implanting a new airway linking her trachea to 
one of her lungs. The team took a section of trachea from a deceased donor, 
removed all the donor’s tissues, and “seeded” the trachea scaffold with new 
cartilage cells grown from the patient’s own stem cells. (They used mesenchy-
mal stem cells from her bone marrow, the stem cells that normally give rise to 
connective-tissue cells.) Four days after surgeons implanted the replacement 
trachea, the graft was nearly indistinguishable from the patient’s own airways, 
and she suffered no severe complications from the surgery. Because the 
trachea was seeded with the patient’s own cells, she didn’t require immune-
suppressing drugs to ensure her body accepted the graft.
Of course, science is a long way from being able to grow completely func-
tional and individualized organs and tissues. However, stem cell technology, 
coupled with tissue engineering and better methods of regulating immune 
responses in both patient and donor cells, may well yield vastly improved 
transplant techniques. In fact, stem cell scientists and bioengineers already 
are beginning to work together to create scaffolds on which stem cells can 
be coaxed to grow to create so-called replacement parts — bits and pieces of 
organs and tissues that have the right architecture and will behave the way 
the original equipment does.
Developing in vitro fertilization
In vitro means “in glass.” Strictly speaking, in vitro fertilization (IVF) is a form 
of transplantation. The procedure involves collecting sperm and egg cells, 
fusing them and letting them grow and differentiate for a few days in a lab, 
and then implanting the resulting blastocyst (see Chapter 4) in the female’s 
uterus in hopes of starting a pregnancy. Scientists began looking at creat-
ing animal embryos outside the womb in the late 1800s, but the technique 
wasn’t successful until 1959, when the first IVF animals (rabbits) were born. 
Researchers created IVF laboratory mice in 1968, and the first IVF calf was 
born in 1981.
IVF was applied in humans beginning in the 1970s to help infertile couples 
conceive children. Louise Brown became the world’s first test-tube baby when 
she was born in Britain in 1978; in 1999, when Louise celebrated her 21st 
birthday, more than 35,000 IVF babies were born in the United States alone.

50
Part I: Brushing Up on Biology 
As scientists refined IVF techniques, they learned that they could fertilize egg 
cells, allow the cells to grow, divide, and differentiate for a few days, and then 
freeze the resulting blastocysts for future use. When the growing and freezing 
procedures are done properly, blastocysts generated in the lab can be thawed 
and implanted to start a pregnancy even after several years in frozen storage.
 
Scientists can grow human embryonic stem cells today (see Chapter 4) only 
because of the development of in vitro fertilization and improved storage tech-
niques that protect the cells’ viability for several years.
Cloning animals
Almost as soon as August Weismann (see “Comparing ideas about heredity,” 
earlier in this chapter) proposed the idea that genetic material is lost as cells 
become specialized for particular jobs, scientists tried to figure out whether 
he was right. (He wasn’t, for the most part.) In 1928, Hans Spemann used a 
rudimentary technique to transfer the nucleus of a salamander embryo cell 
into a salamander cell that didn’t have a nucleus; he managed to create a 
new salamander embryo, essentially an artificially created clone salamander. 
When he published his findings in 1938, he proposed experiments to deter-
mine whether you could make cloned animals using adult nuclei, too.
Other scientists answered the challenge, and, ultimately, British scientist 
John Gurdon transferred the nucleus of an intestinal cell from a tadpole into 
a frog embryo cell (with the original nucleus removed) and created a cloned 
frog. He also discovered that the later in development you took the nucleus, 
the less efficient the process was.
In 1996, the world marveled at Dolly the sheep, the first cloned mammal. 
Since then, scientists have cloned cats, dogs, mice, and cattle, proving that 
you can take the nucleus of almost any kind of adult cell, transfer it into an 
egg cell, and create a whole new animal that’s genetically identical to the 
adult cell from which you took the nucleus. (See Chapter 6 for details on dif-
ferent cloning technologies.)
 
Popular as cloned humans are in science fiction, virtually no one in the medi-
cal or scientific communities thinks cloning human adults in real life is a good 
idea. For one thing, the technology doesn’t work well enough to support clon-
ing humans — at least not yet, and maybe not ever, because it’s highly risky 
from a medical standpoint. More important, though, is the fact that virtually 
all the mammals cloned so far have had some sort of abnormality. Dolly, for 
example, lived only 6 years, about half the typical lifespan of her breed. And 
while her short life may have been coincidental, most researchers suspect 
that the reading of genetic information becomes slightly garbled when you 
transfer the nucleus of an adult cell into an egg cell. (See Chapter 15 for a 
discussion of ethical and other questions surrounding cloning and other tech-
niques related to different types of stem cell research.)

ifferent kinds of stem cells have different abilities 
and limitations. Embryonic stem cells appear to be 
the most malleable, able to grow indefinitely in the lab 
and give rise to all the cell types in the adult body. Adult 
stem cells can reproduce themselves and generate spe-
cific types of cells, but how versatile they are remains an 
open question. And scientists around the world are exper-
imenting with so-called “engineered” stem cells — repro-
gramming certain types of cells so that they exhibit some 
of the properties of stem cells.
In this part, we explain the what, where, how, and why of 
the various kinds of stem cells, starting with embryonic 
stem cells. We show you what scientists know about these 
different types of cells and what they’ve been able to do 
with them so far. And we explain how researchers use 
hybrids, chimeras, and other creations to expand their 
knowledge and look for treatments for various ailments.

mbryonic stem cells have enormous potential to revolutionize health-
care — not just in treating disease, but in understanding how disease 
develops, creating more effective treatments, and, perhaps, even discovering 
the “on-off’ switches that lead either to normal human development or to ill-
ness. Imagine being able to use embryonic stem cells to learn how to “turn 
off” a cellular switch that shouldn’t be on and thereby stop the development 
of, say, leukemia or other forms of cancer.
Of course, we’re many years and many thousands of experiments and trials 
away from such astounding medical advances. But these kinds of possibilities 
drive today’s researchers, fire their imaginations, and provide a roadmap for 
where scientists think we can go with embryonic stem cell research.
To understand why embryonic stem cells generate so much excitement, you 
have to know what they are and what they can do. In this chapter, we show 
you where embryonic stem cells come from, explain what scientists have 
learned about them so far, and show you why they generate such excitement 
and hold so much promise for dramatic breakthroughs in health and medi-
cine in the coming years.

Exploring the Stages of 
Embryonic Development
For most people, the word embryo conjures a mental picture of a miniature 
baby. However, at the point when human embryonic cells are collected for 
research, they haven’t yet formed what most people think of when they hear 
the word “embryo.” (See Chapter 14 for a discussion of the ethical, moral, 
and philosophical questions surrounding embryonic stem cells.)
 
Embryonic stem cells are so called because they’re derived from the very earli-
est stages of embryonic development — before cells begin differentiating, or 
becoming specialized as muscle cells, blood cells, nerve cells, and so on.
Reproduction in mammals follows the same basic pattern. Figure 4-1 shows 
the stages of early development:

 Chapter 4: Starting with Embryonic Stem Cells
 
1. Sexually mature animals, including humans, produce egg cells and 
sperm cells (the male’s germ cells).
 
 Neither is capable of reproducing until it fuses with the other.
 
2. When an egg cell fuses with a sperm cell, they form a zygote — a 
single cell with amazing properties that launches early development.
 
 Zygotes can even reproduce themselves by splitting in half, which is one 
way identical twins are created.
 
3. The zygote travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus, grow-
ing through a process called cell division that happens every 10 to 20 
hours.
 
 By the time it reaches the point where the fallopian tube joins the 
uterus — a journey that takes about a week — the zygote has grown and 
divided four times to form a cluster of 16 cells.
 
4. These 16 cells keep dividing, but now a tiny cavity forms in the center 
of the cell cluster.
 
 Some cells form a membrane that separates the inner and outer cells. 
Cells on the outside of the membrane eventually form the placenta and 
umbilical cord. Cells on the inside of the membrane go on to form the 
fetus and, eventually, the adult. This new structure is called a blastocyst, 
which is about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
 
5. If the blastocyst moves into the uterus and fuses with the uterine wall, 
the adult female becomes pregnant.
 
 If the blastocyst doesn’t fuse with the uterine wall, it stops growing, and 
the female’s body eventually discards it.
 
In the lab, embryonic stem cells are derived from blastocysts (see “Growing 
Embryonic Stem Cells from Extra Blastocysts,” later in this chapter) — not 
from later stages of development. In fact, cells from later stages of develop-
ment (when the blastocyst has grown into a gastrula) have already begun to 
differentiate, or take on the characteristics of specific types of cells (heart 
cells, brain cells, and so on), so they aren’t as malleable as cells from blas-
tocysts. Once a cell has specialized as a nerve cell, for example, it can’t be 
directed to become a blood cell or skin cell. (Figure 4-2 shows how cells from 
the gastrula go on to form the different cell types in the body.) Cells from blas-
tocysts, however, have the potential to become any type of cell in the adult 
body. (See “Directing cell specialization,” later in this chapter.)

 Chapter 4: Starting with Embryonic Stem Cells
Looking at the Role of In Vitro 
Fertilization in Creating Blastocysts
When couples have difficulty conceiving children on their own, they often 
turn to fertility treatments. The best-known of these is called in vitro fertil-
ization, a process in which egg cells are removed from the woman’s body, 
fertilized with the man’s sperm, grown into blastocysts in a Petri dish, and 
implanted in the lining of the woman’s uterus. (For more on blastocysts, see 
the preceding section.)
In nature, only a fraction of blastocysts actually attach to the uterine wall 
and grow into babies. The same is true with in vitro fertilization, so a typical 
course of this technique may generate eight to ten (or more) blastocysts. 
Scientists and doctors may use one or two of these blastocysts in the first 
attempt to start a pregnancy while freezing and storing the others for later 
use. They can then thaw the blastocysts and use them to start a pregnancy, 
or, if the couple decides not to have more children, donate the blastocysts to 
other people who are trying to have children.
 
Blastocysts can be frozen for several years, but eventually they lose viability 
(that is, they no longer have the potential to start a pregnancy). Blastocysts 
that aren’t used to start a pregnancy are often thrown away as biological or 
medical waste.
Growing Embryonic Stem Cells 
from Extra Blastocysts
Instead of throwing away blastocysts that couples have decided not to use, 
store, or donate to another couple, couples can decide to donate those 
excess blastocysts for research. (Figure 4-3 shows the various potential uses 
for blastocysts.) Scientists can extract the inner cell mass — the collection of 
cells inside the blastocyst — from donated blastocysts and grow those inner 
cells in the lab. Interestingly, when grown properly, these inner cells seem 
able to grow indefinitely outside the blastocyst, which doesn’t happen when 
the blastocyst remains intact. When they’re grown in the lab in this way, 
they’re called embryonic stem cells.
 
Because of this ability to grow more or less indefinitely in a Petri dish, embry-
onic stem cells seem to be different from the inner cells of the blastocyst that 
generate them. However, if they’re grown properly, these cells — at least as 
far as we know today — retain an important property of the inner cells of a 
blastocyst: They can make any cell in the adult body. (See “Generating any 
kind of cell,” later in this chapter.)

Cultured pluripotent stem cells
How do we know that embryonic stem cells can make any cell in the adult 
human body? Well, to be absolutely accurate, we don’t, because there 
are some experiments you just can’t perform on human beings. However, 
research in mice has proven that embryonic stem cells do have this ability. 
For example, you can transplant mouse embryonic stem cells into a mouse 
blastocyst, implant the blastocyst to initiate a pregnancy, and show that 
derivatives of those transplanted embryonic stem cells gave rise to every 
single cell type in the newborn baby mouse.

59
 Chapter 4: Starting with Embryonic Stem Cells
From this and other experimental results from mice, as well as laboratory 
experiments with human embryonic stem cells, we infer that human embry-
onic stem cells most likely have the same properties and behave in the same 
ways as mouse embryonic stem cells. (See Chapter 3 for more on experi-
ments with mice and what scientists have learned from them.)
Exploring Embryonic Stem Cell Properties
In the movie “Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,” the crew of the Enterprise 
travels back in time to 20th-century Earth, and Dr. McCoy helps a woman 
undergoing dialysis. As she’s being wheeled down a hospital corridor, she 
joyfully tells everyone, “Doctor gave me a pill, and I grew a new kidney!”
Okay, that kind of biological miracle is still the stuff of science fiction. But 
embryonic stem cells hold enormous potential for giant leaps in medical 
treatments because of their unique properties:
 
✓ They can divide and grow more or less indefinitely.
 
✓ They can develop into any cell type found in the adult body.
 
✓ They have an incredibly lengthy shelf life, so they can be stored for very 
long periods without losing their potency.
Growing and growing and growing . . .
Left to their own devices, cells in the blastocyst eventually differentiate, or 
begin developing special characteristics of job-specific cells. Some become 
neurons, for example — the brain cells that control thought and movement. 
Others spin off into red or white blood cells, or heart muscle cells, or liver 
cells, and so on. DNA, which provides the blueprints for cell development, 
and RNA, the user’s manual stating which part of the blueprint to follow, 
determine which job each cell takes on. (See Chapter 2 for a primer on 
genetic instruction and its role in development.)
 
In the lab, though, scientists can delay the reading and implementation of the 
genetic instructions that tell cells to specialize by isolating the inner cells from 
blastocysts, transferring them to Petri dishes, and feeding them a mixture of 
appropriate nutrients (called a growth medium or culture medium) so they can 
continue to grow. Under the correct conditions, embryonic stem cells read the 
genetic instructions for self-renewal and continue to grow until they’re exposed 
to signals that tell them to read the genetic instructions for specialization.

60
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
Cells like to touch other cells, so scientists usually line the Petri dish with a 
layer of other cells — most commonly embryonic skin cells from mice that 
have been treated so they won’t grow. The cells in this layer are called feeder 
cells. The inner cells from a blastocyst are placed on top of the feeder cells, 
and a growth medium (a broth rich in the nutrients the cells need to thrive) 
is added. Depending on what’s in the growth medium, these inner cells can 
continue dividing into more embryonic stem cells, or they can begin differen-
tiating into specific categories or types of cells.
One of the risks associated with using mouse feeder cells to grow human 
embryonic stem cells is that the human cells may be infected with viruses 
or contaminated with other unwanted material from the mouse cells. 
Researchers have come up with other ways to grow embryonic stem cells, 
but only time will tell us whether these alternative methods are as useful and 
reliable as using mouse cells.
Assuming the relocation of the blastocyst’s inner cell mass into a Petri dish 
is successful — and that’s not always the case — the embryonic stem cells 
grow until they crowd the dish. Then they’re removed from the original dish, 
divided up, and placed into several new dishes with fresh growth media. This 
process is called subculturing, and each round of subculturing is called a pas-
sage. Scientists can separate, freeze, and store batches of cells at any stage of 
the subculturing process. They also can ship them to other researchers after 
they’ve verified that the cells are stable and usable.
It takes at least six months and several passages to create an embryonic stem 
cell line — that is, millions of cells derived from the original inner cell mass of 
the blastocyst that meet two critical conditions:
 
✓ They retain their ability to grow into any kind of cell in the adult body.
 
✓ They appear to have no genetic defects.
Scientists use a method called karyotyping to make sure that stem cells have 
the correct number of chromosomes (see Chapter 2). Normal human cells 
have a total of 46 chromosomes, paired in sets of two; you inherit one of each 
set, or 23 chromosomes, from each parent.
 
Embryonic stem cells’ ability to grow and divide practically indefinitely under 
the right conditions is an important property for medical research and devel-
oping useful treatments. It takes millions of cells to conduct reliable experi-
ments, and one of the biggest eventual challenges in using stem cells to treat 
illness is creating enough of them to do the job.

61
 Chapter 4: Starting with Embryonic Stem Cells
Generating any kind of cell
When you read about stem cells, you often run into three terms:
 
✓ Pluripotent (“pluri” meaning “many,” and “potent” meaning “potential”) 
cells can generate any kind of cell in the adult body. Embryonic stem 
cells are pluripotent because, as far as we know, they can give rise to 
any cell type except those that form the placenta and the umbilical cord 
needed to establish and maintain a pregnancy.
 
✓ Multipotent (which, technically, means the same thing as pluripotent) 
is most often — and most accurately — used to describe cells that can 
give rise to several different cell types in a specific category of cells — 
different types of blood cells or skin cells, for example.
 
✓ Totipotent means the potential to create all types of cells in an organism 
at any stage of development. Totipotency is extremely rare. In humans 
and other mammals (as far as we know), only the first eight cells created 
from a zygote are totipotent because they can give rise to all the cells in 
the adult as well as the cells that form the placenta and umbilical cord — 
without which no fetus can survive.
 
These terms aren’t always used consistently or properly, especially in media 
reports. Sometimes pluripotent and multipotent are used interchangeably, 
and sometimes these words have different meanings, depending on the con-
text. See the nearby sidebar, “The trouble with terms,” for a more precise 
explanation of what pluripotent may really mean.
The trouble with terms
The same word can mean different things 
depending on the context, and that’s true in any 
discussion about stem cells, too. For example, 
the meaning of pluripotent can change depend-
ing on whether you’re talking about embryonic 
stem cells or adult stem cells (which we cover 
in Chapter 5).
In the context of embryonic stem cells, pluripo-
tent means the ability to generate all the cells 
in an adult body.
When you’re talking about adult stem cells, 
pluripotent means the ability to make lots of 
different kinds of cells, but not usually all the 
cell types in an adult body. In fact, as far as we 
know, no stem cell in an adult organism retains 
the ability to make all adult cell types, but the 
term pluripotent is often used for specific types 
of adult stem cells. For example, blood-forming 
(hematopoietic) stem cells are sometimes 
called pluripotent because they can give rise 
to 20 or so different types of blood cells. But 
(again, as far we know) they can’t give rise to, 
say, nerve cells.
Most scientists and researchers use the term 
multipotent to describe stem cells that can create 
many types of cells in a category of cells — 
blood cells, for example — and pluripotent to 
describe cells that can generate all of the dif-
ferent categories of cells, such as nerve cells 
and connective tissue cells.

62
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
So how do you know whether a cell is totipotent, pluripotent, or multipotent? 
It depends on which parts of the cell’s genetic code are turned on and which 
parts are turned off. Thanks to decades of research, scientists know that 
when certain genetic material is on (and other genetic materials that con-
trol specialized cell behavior are off), cells are pluripotent. If those genetic 
switches aren’t on, the cell’s ability to give rise to different kinds of new cells 
is limited. (Of course, it takes a bunch of really cool, sophisticated, sci-fi-type 
equipment to determine which genetic material is turned on and which is 
turned off.)
 
In the lab, scientists have successfully grown many types of mouse and 
human cells from embryonic stem cells by manipulating the genetic on and off 
switches. In fact, they’ve even done it with other, nonmammalian organisms, 
such as frogs.
Making Cells and Tissues
Scientists have made great progress in inducing embryonic stem cells to form 
mixtures of tissue types. We now know, for example, which kind of growth 
formula to use to create embryoid bodies, a mixture of cells from the three 
major tissue types. (See Chapter 2 for more on tissue types.) Ultimately, the 
cells from embryoid bodies create a new mixture of specialized cells — neu-
rons and heart cells and all sorts of bits and pieces of various tissues.
This process is pretty cool, but it isn’t very efficient. Embryoid bodies are a 
mish-mash of different cell types that will go on to form widely differing tis-
sues; ideally, scientists want to be able to grow a single type of cell or tissue 
in a dish, or at least be able to quickly and easily isolate the cells they want.
So the first challenge is to direct the cells in embryoid bodies to make specific 
cell types. The second is to isolate the cells you want from all the other cells 
in the mixture so that you have a pure collection — all white blood cells, for 
example, instead of a combination of red and white blood cells — to work with.
Directing cell specialization
The main problem in creating specific cells and tissues is figuring out how 
to tell the cells what you want them to do. For the present, scientists and 
researchers use two main approaches to accomplishing this goal:
 
✓ A trial-and-error approach that involves manipulating the growth 
medium and the culture environment and seeing what you get
 
✓ An approach that uses what scientists already know about intercellular 
communication to create the cells that scientists and researchers want

63
 Chapter 4: Starting with Embryonic Stem Cells
Manipulating the environment
Over the past several years, scientists have learned some things about how 
the growth medium affects cell development. They have some formulas for 
stimulating the growth of heart, brain, liver, blood, and pancreatic cells and 
tissues, and researchers are working on developing the right nutrient recipes 
for other kinds of cells and tissues.
Those recipes may consist of different nutrients — vitamins, amino acids, 
and other essential nutrients that allow cells to grow and multiply — or dif-
ferent chemicals, or a combination of the two. Scientists can also combine 
these nutrient/chemical recipes with a special layer of mouse feeder cells 
called stromal cells, which secrete special factors that appear to spur cell 
growth in certain specialized directions. (Unfortunately, scientists haven’t 
yet figured out exactly what those factors are or precisely how they work.)
Cells grown under these different conditions are tested to see which genetic 
material is turned on and which is turned off, and that information is com-
bined with visual examination under a microscope to see what the resulting 
cells look like — whether they appear normal for their cell type and so on.
Controlling cell communication
Fruit flies and other nonhuman organisms have taught scientists a lot 
about how cells communicate with each other. It takes more than one cell 
to become a wing, obviously, but how do emerging wing cells know where 
they’re supposed to be and which other cells they’re supposed to hang out 
with?
As it turns out, cells “talk” to each other, after a fashion. Wing cells produce 
specific molecules that signal other wing cells. Cells destined to become legs 
or skin or eyes have their own molecular call signal, which only cells with the 
appropriate call signals respond to. That’s why, in a genetically normal fruit fly, 
you don’t see eyes in the middle of the wings or legs in the middle of the eyes.
Human, mouse, and frog cells have many of these same “communication” 
molecules, and they’re incredibly important in telling cells what to do and 
how to do it. Taking advantage of this knowledge, scientists can apply those 
communication molecules to mouse or frog cells in the lab and try to mimic 
the conditions normally found in a developing mouse or frog. This approach 
is pretty effective in creating the desired cell types.
 
By manipulating the growth environment and controlling communication 
molecules, scientists can create the specialized conditions different cell types 
need to develop. So, with the right growth recipes and call signals, you can 
grow insulin-producing pancreatic cells, or brain cells that make dopamine (a 
neurotransmitter involved in controlling body movement), or motor neurons 
(the cells in the nervous system that send signals out to the muscles in the 
body).

64
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
Growing pure cells
One problem with most of the reliable methods for growing specialized 
cells is that they don’t produce pure cell types. That is, if you’re trying to 
grow insulin-producing pancreatic cells, you end up with some other types 
of pancreatic cells, too — as well as some cells that have nothing to do 
with the pancreas.
Fortunately, thanks to decades of research on the hematopoietic or blood-
forming system, we know that different kinds of cells have different kinds of 
molecules on their surfaces. Red blood cells, white blood cells, and blood 
stem cells each make different molecules that are displayed on their surfaces, 
and the genetic coding of each cell type determines which surface molecules 
the cell creates. Those molecules have important jobs in communicating with 
other cells, but they also provide a marker to identify which type of cell is 
which. In many cases, certain types of cells produce unique markers or com-
binations of markers, so if you can identify the markers, you can identify the 
cell type.
Scientists use antibodies to identify the markers on the cells’ surface. 
Antibodies are special proteins in blood and other bodily fluids that iden-
tify and neutralize foreign bodies like bacteria and viruses. Scientists can 
engineer antibodies so that they bind to one — and only one — type of cell 
surface marker. Scientists can outfit these engineered antibodies with fluo-
rescent molecules that shine or glow under special lights, similar to the way 
black-light posters of the 1970s glowed different colors under ultraviolet 
light.
 
Scientists use machines called fluorescent-activated cell sorters (FACS) that 
examine cells that have been exposed to mixtures of different antibodies (and 
thus give off different colors) and sort them according to color. Red cells go 
into one tube, for example; green cells go into another tube; and cells that give 
off both red and green light go into yet another tube. (Figure 4-4 shows how 
FACS works.) The FACS also counts each cell as it’s sorted, so at the end of 
the process, you know how many red-emitting cells, how many green-emitting 
cells, and how many red-and-green-emitting cells you have.
Another way to separate the cells you want from the ones you don’t want is 
to attach magnetic beads to the antibodies and mix the antibodies and cells 
together in a tube. When you hold a magnet to the side of the tube, all the 
cells that have bound to the magnetic-bead antibodies move to that side of 
the tube, allowing you to wash away the remaining cells and preserve the 
ones you want.

Touring the Lab: What Scientists Are 
Doing with Embryonic Stem Cells
Stem cell research isn’t just about figuring out how cells work. Scientists are 
trying to solve practical problems — or at least improve our understanding 
of how and why problems arise. Among the practical applications of embry-
onic stem cell research:
 
✓ Developing reliable ways to make different types of defined cells — for 
example, motor neurons, pancreatic beta cells (the ones that produce 
insulin), eye cells, and heart cells.
 
✓ Building disease models to see what goes wrong after the genetic 
instructions are read, figure out how and why the instructions don’t 
yield the correct outcome, and test drugs that can fix the mistakes.

66
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
 
✓ Creating processes to manufacture cell patterns and instruction codes 
so that you can quickly and reliably make (culture) exactly the kinds of 
cells you need for a given purpose.
 
✓ Studying stem cell transplants in animals with a view to develop cell 
therapies for humans, where defined cells made from stem cells are gen-
erated in the lab and transplanted into a person to
 
• Treat a given disease
 
• Replace cells lost to the disease
 
• Replace or modify the cell functions that disease affects
Looking at examples of current research
Fixing a car is difficult if you don’t know how the car is supposed to work in 
the first place. Medical researchers have the same problem. We know some 
things about how normal cells should develop, and we know a few things 
about what can go wrong. But there’s an awful lot we don’t know yet, so sci-
entists are using stem cells to expand our understanding of normal — and 
abnormal — human development.
Much of today’s research centers on making different cell types so that sci-
entists can try to figure out what happens in specific diseases. For example, 
at the University of California–San Diego Stem Cell Program, scientists use 
human embryonic stem cells to make human brain cells afflicted with some 
of the genetic changes found in Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers study these 
created cells to find out what goes wrong in Alzheimer’s with the idea that, 
when you know what’s broken, you can figure out how to fix it.
Similar research is going on all over the world. Research groups and compa-
nies are using human embryonic stem cells to create motor neurons in hopes 
of better understanding such diseases as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, 
more commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease) and spinal muscular atro-
phy (a disease in which the motor neurons degrade, leading to decreases in 
muscle mass and overall weakness).
Other research groups and biotech companies are working on making other 
kinds of cells — insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells, which may lead to 
more effective treatments for diabetes; different kinds of blood cells; differ-
ent kinds of cancer cells; and cardiomyocytes, or heart muscle cells. All these 
avenues of research have one goal in common: understanding normal cell 
biology and figuring out what goes wrong in disease so that researchers can 
fix them. (See the nearby sidebar, “Geron’s attempts to re-insulate neurons.”)

67
 Chapter 4: Starting with Embryonic Stem Cells
Creating a basis for future research
 
Although researchers have been studying human adult stem cells for decades, 
human embryonic stem cell research is still in its infancy. Real-world, practical 
applications of this research are still years away. But all the work scientists 
are doing today is laying the foundation for what future research may reveal.
Elements of that foundation include
 
✓ Learning how to alter stem cells’ genetic material. By tinkering with 
DNA and RNA, scientists hope to determine how the human genome dic-
tates the development and behavior of different types of cells, both nor-
mally and when they malfunction. If we can decode the mechanisms that 
carry out the instructions, someday we may be able to control those 
mechanisms and dictate those instructions ourselves.
 
✓ Figuring out new methods to purify cell cultures. Right now, processes 
for separating the cells you want from the ones you don’t want are rela-
tively cumbersome. (See “Growing pure cells,” earlier in this chapter.) 
Coming up with streamlined, reliable purification methods is an impor-
tant step in developing safe and useful medical treatments.
Geron’s attempts to re-insulate neurons
In 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approved the world’s first clinical trial for a 
treatment using cells derived from human 
embryonic stem cells. Biotech firm Geron has 
been researching treatments for spinal cord 
injury, specifically ways to repair and regener-
ate myelin, the fatty sheath that covers neurons 
(similar to the insulation that covers electrical 
wires). Myelin is often damaged or destroyed 
in spinal cord injuries, and, like a bare wire that 
can short-circuit, the exposed neurons can be 
permanently damaged.
Geron’s clinical trial — which, as of this writ-
ing, has been put on hold while researchers 
assess the results of animal experiments — 
involves injecting spinal cord injury patients 
with cells that have the potential to mature into 
oligodendrocytes  — the cells that form myelin. 
Research with mice has indicated that repair-
ing and regrowing myelin can improve control 
of body movements.
The first phase of Geron’s clinical trial is 
designed primarily to gauge the safety of the 
treatment; fewer than a dozen patients will take 
part. Assuming that the treatment is judged to 
be safe, additional clinical trials will determine 
whether Geron’s approach actually works in 
humans.

68
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
 
✓ Creating precise “cell mixture recipes” to more accurately reflect 
natural processes. Cells that behave one way in the lab often exhibit dif-
ferent behaviors in a live human or animal body, and cells in the body 
constantly interact with other cells. If scientists can find the right combi-
nation of different cell types to give a reasonable model of what goes on 
in the human body, they can use that model to develop more effective 
medical treatments.
Understanding the Possibilities and 
Limitations of Embryonic Stem Cells
Embryonic stem cells hold a great deal of promise in treating or even curing 
a range of devastating diseases. But potential isn’t reality, and, even with 
all their promise, embryonic stem cells can’t do some things — at least, 
we don’t think they can. Unfortunately, these nuances are often missed or 
blurred when a promising idea or test captures headlines. So here’s a sum-
mary of what we really know about embryonic cells: what they can do, what 
they can’t do, and what we think they may be able to do — not today, but in 
the relatively near future.
What embryonic stem cells can do
To figure out how cells develop normally and what goes wrong when they don’t, 
you need a lot of cells to observe and test. Perhaps the most useful property of 
embryonic stem cells, at least for today’s researchers is that when you grow 
them properly, you can make lots and lots and lots of embryonic stem cells.
And you can, in turn, use those embryonic stem cells to make lots of specific 
types of cells. If you want to figure out why pancreatic beta cells misbehave 
in some types of diabetes, for example, and then find ways to repair or 
replace them, you need a lot of pancreatic beta cells.
Several research groups have already started testing drugs using cells 
derived from embryonic stem cells, and a number of researchers are well 
on their way to transplanting such derivative cells into animals to test the 
cells’ capacity to change a disease — reduce symptoms or reverse damage. 
(Scientists need to do these types of tests on animals, and the results have to 
meet certain benchmarks before they can conduct similar tests on humans.)
 
Embryonic stem cells seem to be able to make all types of cells in the adult 
body, which makes them particularly useful in investigating the causes of and 
possible treatments for a wide range of diseases, from central nervous system 
disorders like ALS to chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.

69
 Chapter 4: Starting with Embryonic Stem Cells
What embryonic stem cells can’t do
Even with all their wondrous abilities, embryonic stem cells have their 
limitations.
For example, they can’t make a baby. That’s because embryonic stem cells 
are derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst. Those inner cells can’t 
make the placenta that provides nourishment for a developing baby, or the 
umbilical cord that delivers nutrients to the fetus.
Embryonic stem cells can’t be used to clone an adult (at least, as far as we 
know today).
And they can’t cure disease in and of themselves. You can’t just inject a 
syringe-full of embryonic stem cells into a mouse or a human and expect 
them to identify and correct a problem. You have to know what kind of cells 
to make from embryonic stem cells, how to purify them, and where to put 
them in the body. Plus, in order to make testing any potential treatments safe 
(and to give those potential treatments a strong likelihood of being effective), 
you need a lot of reliable information about both the cells and the potential 
treatment. (See Chapter 11 for more on developing and testing potential 
treatments.)
Perhaps most important, embryonic stem cells can’t solve all our medical 
problems and issues overnight. Even with all the exciting things we can do 
with them now, it’s going to take time — quite a lot of it — to fulfill many of 
the promises these fascinating cells seem to hold. See Chapters 9, 10, and 11 
for more on research to find potential treatments for various diseases.
What embryonic stem cells 
may be able to do
With good ideas and rigorous research, scientists see virtually no limit to 
what we may be able to do with embryonic stem cells a generation or two 
from now. The ideas are the key: Creative ideas lead to realities that nobody 
ever imagined. (After all, do you think the guys who invented the first com-
puter foresaw the Internet?)
Some of the things scientists are daring to imagine now:
 
✓ Creating cells and tissues that can be transplanted into humans
 
✓ Developing drugs that are cheaper to make and more effective in treat-
ing disease

70
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
 
✓ Testing toxins and environmental factors to see how they affect human 
development and health
 
✓ Growing “replacement parts” — new limbs, organs, and tissues that the 
body accepts as its own, without suppressing the immune system or 
running the risk of infection
We’re years away from realizing many of these dreams, of course. Human 
embryonic stem cell research is only about 10 years old; work with adult 
stem cells, on the other hand, is more than 40 years old, which is why we 
know so much about some kinds of adult stem cells and have been able to 
develop some practical applications for them (see Chapter 5).

A
lthough cells with the valuable properties of embryonic stem cells 
aren’t normally found in the adult body (see Chapter 4), the adult body 
does have some cells that can reproduce themselves and generate many or 
all of the cells in the tissues in which they live. These cells are commonly 
called adult stem cells, but the term is something of a misnomer because cells 
with the same properties as adult stem cells are found in fetal tissue as well 
as in fully grown individuals. Curiously, these cells historically have been 
called adult stem cells even though they reside in fetal tissues. Thus, some 
scientists prefer the term tissue stem cell because these particular stem cells 
live inside various tissues. (However, at this time, media reports consistently 
refer to adult stem cells, so we use that term here as well.)
Adult or tissue stem cells are usually multipotent, meaning that they can give 
rise to some or all of the cell types in their home tissues. Like embryonic 
stem cells, adult stem cells can reproduce themselves, or self-renew, but they 
do so to a more limited extent. Unlike embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells 
don’t usually form cells outside their tissue type — although researchers are 
experimenting to see whether they can induce them to create cells outside 
their normal functions.
In this chapter, we explore adult stem cells — what they are, what they can 
and can’t do, and how scientists are using them to understand human devel-
opment and unlock potential therapies for disease.

72
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
Demonstrating the Existence 
of Tissue Stem Cells
For generations, scientists, doctors, and others assumed that the human 
body must contain some special mechanism to repair or replace worn-out 
or damaged tissues. Even the ancients knew, for example, that the liver can 
regenerate itself (see Chapter 3) and that, even though dead skin routinely 
sloughs off the body, the body’s supply of skin never seems to run out.
During the 1940s and 1950s, various researchers conducted experiments that 
suggested that bone marrow contained cells that could reconstitute the blood 
and immune system. In 1961, two Canadian researchers finally proved the 
existence of what they called stem cells — cells that were capable of regenerat-
ing tissues and even whole systems within a fully developed body. They used 
X-rays to kill a mouse’s blood-forming cells and immune system cells and then 
injected bone marrow into the irradiated mouse. The injected bone marrow 
reconstituted the mouse’s blood supply and immune system, proving that cells 
in the marrow are capable of producing all the different cell types in the blood. 
Eventually, these researchers showed that a single cell type — what is known 
now as hematopoietic stem cells — was responsible for that reconstruction. 
These experiments formed the basis of today’s use of bone marrow transplants 
to treat leukemia and other kinds of blood disorders.
Defining Adult Stem Cells (And the 
Problem with Definitions)
Stem cells differ from other cells in the body in a couple of important ways. 
Most cells in the body are specialized to carry out specific functions, such as 
a skin cell or a stomach cell. Stem cells aren’t specialized in that way, so, by 
themselves, they don’t really carry out any specific functions of the tissues 
they live in. What makes stem cells so special is their ability to reproduce 
themselves for most, if not all, of the organism’s life and to produce cells that 
go on to generate specific types of cells needed in that tissue.
 
The best definition of a stem cell is a cell that has two important properties: 
It can self-renew for long periods (even as long as the lifetime of the organ-
ism), and when it divides, it can give rise to differentiated or specialized 
cells.

73
 Chapter 5: Understanding Adult Stem Cells
When any cell reproduces and divides, the result is two daughter cells. 
When specialized cells divide, their daughter cells are also specialized; 
that is, when a specialized liver cell, or hepatocyte, divides, both daughter 
cells are also hepatocytes.
When stem cells divide, one of the daughter cells continues to be a stem 
cell (self-renewal), and the other can go on to become a specialized cell. 
Sometimes the daughter cell that’s destined to become a specialized can 
itself divide one or more times, in which case it’s referred to as a progenitor 
cell. The additional cell division(s) of a progenitor cell allows for a larger 
pool of specialized cells to be generated from the previous single division 
of the stem cell. In the blood-forming system, for example, some progenitor 
cells divide to generate all the different types of red blood cells and 
platelets, and other progenitor cells give rise to the different types of white 
(or immune) blood cells. Figure 5-1 shows the broad strokes of how adult 
stem cells give rise to fully specialized, or differentiated, tissue cells.
Embryonic stem cells can give rise to any type of cell in the adult body. Adult 
stem cells typically give rise only to the cell types of the tissues in which 
they live. So, for example, hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow can 
produce blood and immune cells, but they can’t produce nerve cells or heart 
muscle cells.
In some cases, adult stem cells produce only specific types of cells within a 
tissue or organ. For example, brain stem cells normally give rise to cells only 
in the olfactory region and in certain regions of the brain involved in learning 
and memory. Researchers are investigating whether they can induce brain 
stem cells to provide repair activity in other regions of the brain (see Chapter 9), 
but no one knows for certain whether that’s possible or how to accomplish it.
 
The term adult stem cell can be misleading. Certainly, human adult bodies (and 
adult bodies of other organisms) contain several caches of stem cells. But the 
word adult is really used to distinguish between stem cells that can become 
any type of cell in the fully developed body (embryonic or pluripotent stem 
cells) and stem cells that give rise only to specific types or categories of cells 
(adult stem cells). The latter really are tissue stem cells. They’re found in chil-
dren and in adult (meaning grown-up) bodies and in fetal tissues — but, for 
whatever reason, tissue stem cells that come from aborted fetuses are rarely 
called fetal tissue stem cells.

Exploring the Abilities 
of Adult Stem Cells
Generally, cells in the human body become progressively more restricted in 
their capabilities as the body develops. So, while the single-celled zygote (see 
Chapter 4) is capable of giving rise to all the cell types a developing fetus 
needs, including the cells that form the placenta and umbilical cord, cells 
taken from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst can form any cell type except 
those that form the placenta and umbilical cord. Figure 5-2 shows the broad 
strokes of how cells become more specialized — and thus more limited in 
their capabilities — as a human embryo or fetus develops.
Some cells, though, remain relatively unspecialized. The job of these adult 
or tissue stem cells is to be on call, so to speak, to create new cells in their 
respective tissues as needed throughout the body’s life. To fulfill this func-
tion, they occasionally reproduce themselves, ensuring that there will be 
enough of them to respond when the tissue needs new specialized cells. But, 
most of the time, many adult stem cells are quiescent, or inactive — sort of 
like bears in hibernation.

Understanding how they work
Many tissues in your body have some adult stem cells. Their level of activ-
ity generally depends on what type of tissue they reside in. Human skin, for 
example, is particularly rich in tissue stem cells because you shed lots of 
dead skin cells every day. (Those dead skin cells make up the majority of 
household dust.) So your body creates a high demand for new skin cells. 
Likewise, stem cells in bone marrow are quite active because they replenish 
blood cells and certain kinds of immune cells that wear out.
In other tissues, such as the liver, stem cells spend most of their time just 
hanging out in their neighborhoods, maintaining their populations by occa-
sionally making more of themselves and waiting for the call to generate new 
specialized cells. Logically, those calls to make specific kinds of cells must 
come through some sort of intercellular signal, but scientists don’t yet know all 
they need to know about how those signals work. Sometimes certain chemicals 
called growth factors are involved, but in other instances, researchers aren’t 
sure how the signals are conducted.
However, researchers do know that adult stem cells usually live in special-
ized environments within their home tissues called niches. (Figure 5-3 shows 
niches for intestinal and skin stem cells.) The signals that tell adult stem cells 
to fire up their manufacturing operations may come from molecules that cells 
in or near the niche give off, or those signals may be transmitted through other 
cells touching the adult stem cells. (Chapter 2 has more information on the var-
ious ways cells communicate with each other.) And sometimes growth factors 
circulate through the niche, urging the stem cells to wake up and get to work.

Figuring out their uses 
and limitations
Scientists are still discovering what they can and can’t do with adult stem 
cells. They know quite a lot about how to use some kinds of these cells; for 
example, they know, based on 40 years of bone marrow transplants, that you 
can reconstitute a person’s entire blood-forming system with the stem cells 
that live in bone marrow (see the section titled “In bone marrow,” later in 
this chapter), but that growing large amounts of those stem cells in the lab — 
at least so far — is impossible.
For other types of adult stem cells, scientists are still trying to gather solid 
evidence about their possible uses and limitations. Because adult stem cells 
have specific jobs in specific tissues, coming up with a can-you-or-can’t-you-
do-this description that fits all adult stem cell types is difficult.
Here’s what scientists generally agree on about adult stem cells:
 
✓ They’re rare; most tissues only have a small supply of adult stem cells.
 
✓ They divide only when they need to — in many cases, not very often at all.
 
✓ They’re largely restricted to making specialized cells in their own tissues.

77
 Chapter 5: Understanding Adult Stem Cells
The last point makes good sense from a biological standpoint. You wouldn’t 
want stem cells in your brain to make liver or muscle tissue, for example, and 
you wouldn’t want stem cells in your intestines to make heart or brain cells. 
An apparent exception to this rule is bone marrow; adult stem cells in bone 
marrow make blood cells and some types of immune cells, which go on to the 
circulatory system rather than staying in the marrow. But blood is really a 
distributed tissue; that is, it circulates throughout the body. And blood-form-
ing stem cells don’t make skin, heart, or other kinds of cells.
 
You also wouldn’t want these stem cells to make new specialized cells willy-
nilly; what would your body do with a bunch of excess liver cells or heart 
muscle cells? Keeping a tight rein on both the types of cells adult stem cells 
can generate and how often those new cells are generated is essential for 
your body to function normally. If those controls on cell type and growth fail, 
you’ve got a problem — such as cancer (see Chapter 8).
Scientists can grow some adult stem cells in the lab and use them to study 
their properties and capabilities, investigate how diseases develop, and test 
possible therapies using either the stem cells themselves to correct a prob-
lem or drugs that induce the stem cells or their progeny to behave in certain 
ways. Other types of adult stem cells — notably blood-forming stem cells — 
don’t grow well in the lab, for reasons that no one has fully figured out yet.
Finding Stem Cells in Tissues
Embryonic stem cells are readily accessible after they’ve been derived in a 
lab from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst (see Chapter 4). In tissues, though, 
stem cells hide out in special niches, so tracking them down is challenging. 
Even when scientists have good reason to believe that a certain kind of tissue 
harbors stem cells, they still have to figure out how to find them and, just 
as important, how to positively identify them as stem cells — a process that 
involves looking at cell shape and structure, surface markers (see Chapter 2), 
and behavior in well-designed experiments. After you’ve identified and located 
adult stem cells, the question becomes what to do with them — how to use 
them to come up with better understanding of the tissue’s mechanisms and 
what goes wrong in disease and, ideally, develop new, effective therapies for 
treating disease.
Scientists have solved important pieces of these problems for several organs. 
In many cases, the methods they use differ from organ to organ, both in 
locating and identifying stem cells and in using them to discover therapies.
 
Even when you can find stem cells in an adult tissue, you still have problems 
getting them from a living donor. If you need stem cells from the intestine, for 
example, you have to perform surgery to get them, for example. So just know-
ing that tissues have stem cells and even knowing where they live in the tissue 
isn’t the end of the story.

Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
The following sections look at what researchers know (and don’t know) 
about certain types of adult stem cells.
In bone marrow
In some ways, the stem cells in bone marrow are the best understood of all 
tissue stem cells. Bone marrow contains three types of stem cells:
 
✓ Mesenchymal, which forms connective tissue (bone, cartilage, ligaments, 
and so on)
 
✓ Endothelial, which can generate blood vessels and other structures
 
✓ Hematopoietic, which can generate all the cells of the blood and certain 
immune system cells
Figure 5-4 shows cell lineage from a blood-forming stem cell to all the differ-
ent types of tissue cells it can give rise to.

 Chapter 5: Understanding Adult Stem Cells
 
Blood- and immune-forming stem cells are an important model for thinking 
about all other stem cells; researchers know more about them than about any 
other kind of stem cell, and they’re the easiest to find with current methods.
Finding and identifying blood-forming stem cells
Unfortunately, stem cells don’t wear little name tags identifying themselves 
as stem cells, so researchers have to use somewhat roundabout methods 
to figure out which cells really are these elusive and prized types. Blood-
forming stem cells are identified through an assay (a controlled test) in which 
researchers use radiation to kill a mouse’s blood- and immune-forming sys-
tems and then give the mouse a bone marrow transplant. If the mouse lives, 
you can conclude that the cells in the transplant reconstituted the mouse’s 
blood-forming system (because, if it didn’t, the mouse would have died). 
From these kinds of experiments, scientists can trace the cell lineage back 
(see Figure 5-4) and identify the cells that are responsible for generating the 
various cell types in the bloodstream. Canadian researchers James Edgar Till 
and Ernest McCullough were the first to demonstrate the existence of stem 
cells when they performed this experiment in 1961 (see Figure 5-5). Their 
work became a key part of the foundation for today’s life-saving bone marrow 
transplants in humans.
 
Although some researchers claim that hematopoietic stem cells can generate 
brain cells and other types of cells, the evidence for those claims is pretty 
weak. On the other hand, there’s quite strong evidence that these stem cells 
make only blood and immune system cells. And if anybody tells you he’s 
grown brain cells from hematopoietic stem cells in the lab, you have our 
permission to be skeptical; despite everything scientists know about hema-
topoietic stem cells, no one has yet managed to grow large amounts of them 
successfully in the lab, much less induce them to spawn other types of cells. 
(Scientists have grown small amounts of these cells for research, but not 
enough for clinical uses.)

Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
When you’ve shown that stem cells exist in bone marrow, the next challenge 
is finding them so that you can extract them, purify them, and study them. 
To locate blood-forming stem cells, scientists use antibodies that react with 
specific molecules, or markers, on the surface of a stem cell. (See Chapter 4 
for one method scientists use to isolate different kinds of cells via the mark-
ers on their surfaces.) These markers allow scientists to purify blood-forming 
stem cells and transplant them to see whether they can rebuild the mouse’s 
blood and immune systems. The markers also give scientists a way to track 
where the cells go, or home to, so scientists can learn more about how blood 
and immune cells are formed.
 
Not only can transplanted hematopoietic stem cells rebuild an entire blood supply, 
they can also find their way to their natural homes without assistance, even in a dif-
ferent body. That homing instinct makes life a lot easier for bone marrow transplant 
patients and their doctors because the doctor can simply inject the bone marrow 
into the patient’s bloodstream, and the cells will do the rest.
Hematopoietic stem cells are pretty easy to purify and study in the lab, but 
studying them in their natural environment — bone marrow — is more dif-
ficult. Scientists are engaged in ongoing research to determine precisely what 
creates the special environment that these cells normally live in, hoping that 
they can devise a reasonable facsimile in the lab that will allow these cells to 
grow, divide, and reproduce in controlled conditions outside the bone marrow.
Despite the fact that they resist growing in the lab, blood-forming stem cells 
are fairly easy to extract from the body, thanks to new techniques. In the old 
days, the only way to extract these cells was to stick a needle directly into 
the bone marrow of the pelvis — a painful process for the patient. But now 
scientists know that, occasionally, these cells slip out of the marrow and 
wander around the bloodstream for a while before they head back to their 
home. Injections of certain growth factors can stimulate the stem cells to 
divide and migrate out of their niches more often than normal, and the extra 
stem cells end up in the bloodstream, where they can easily be extracted. 
Scientists don’t know exactly why the growth factors result in more stem 
cells in the bloodstream, but the growth factors appear to reduce the signals 
that normally tell the stem cells to stay in the bone marrow, and, without 
those signals, more of the stem cells enter the bloodstream.
 
For clinical purposes, blood-forming stem cells generally are taken from adult 
bone marrow. But they also can be extracted from umbilical cord blood and 
aborted fetuses. Researchers are also working on making blood-forming stem 
cells from embryonic stem cells (see Chapter 4) or other pluripotent cells (see 
Chapter 6) for a couple reasons:
 
✓ It may solve the problem of not being able to grow these particular stem 
cells in the lab.
 
✓ You could, theoretically, make genetically matched hematopoietic stem 
cells for use in transplants, thus relieving the severe shortage of bone 
marrow donors compared with people who need bone marrow transplants.

81
 Chapter 5: Understanding Adult Stem Cells
Tracking down mesenchymal stem cells
Mesenchymal stem cells have the potential to make bone, tendons, liga-
ments, and other connective tissues. They hang out in the bone marrow with 
the blood-forming stem cells, as well as other locations like fatty or adipose 
tissue, dental tissue, and the umbilical cord. (In fact, early claims of finding 
pluripotent stem cells in fat and amniotic fluid probably were describing mes-
enchymal stem cells.)
Unlike blood-forming stem cells, mesenchymal cells grow pretty well under 
laboratory conditions, so researchers are interested in using mesenchymal 
stem cells to treat conditions like arthritis and tendon and ligament damage. 
Because their normal job is to repair connective tissue, scientists also are 
looking at using them to form matrices or scaffolds for various kinds of tissue 
repair.
 
Some published reports have claimed that mesenchymal stem cells can make 
neurons or other kinds of brain cells, but most critical, careful scientists 
think that those reports are based on inadequate work and will eventually be 
proved wrong. Most of the available evidence today indicates that mesenchy-
mal stem cells can reliably make only connective tissue cells — bone, carti-
lage, ligaments, and so on. However, within their own purview, mesenchymal 
stem cells — like blood-forming stem cells — can be quite useful.
In the brain
The human brain contains two small caches of stem cells — one in the region 
of the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in learning and memory, and 
one in one of the brain’s ventricles (one of four cavities in the brain that are 
continuous with the spinal cord column) that make cells involved in your 
sense of smell. Interestingly, the offspring of the cells in the ventricle don’t 
stay there; they migrate to the olfactory bulb, the brain region that processes 
signals from the nose.
Scientists know quite a bit about these stem cells:
 
✓ They appear to be present in both adult and fetal brains. Fetal brain 
stem cells seem to grow and behave better in laboratory experiments 
than those that come from adults (although comparatively few experi-
ments have been done on nonfetal brain stem cells).
 
✓ They can grow and divide in the lab. Unlike some other kinds of adult 
stem cells, brain stem cells can grow and retain their essential prop-
erties in laboratory conditions, making them incredibly valuable for 
research. Remember, however, that any time you take a cell out of a 
human being or animal and grow it in the laboratory, the properties of 
that cell change — and those changes affect the cell’s ability to generate 
normal cells if you put it (or its offspring) back into the body.

82
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
 
✓ They can be induced to generate several kinds of brain cells. In both 
their natural environment and in the lab, brain stem cells apparently 
can be directed to generate some types of neurons, as well as glial cells 
(non-neuronal cells that support neuron function).
Presumably, the main job of brain stem cells is to provide either maintenance 
services, replacing worn-out or dead cells as needed, or to encode and store 
new information — or possibly both these functions. They also may be part 
of making new memories, too. But the two known populations of brain stem 
cells apparently don’t provide repair functions beyond their own particular 
regions in the brain. Scientists are investigating whether they can spur these 
stem cells to go outside their normal territories to provide rescue and repair 
activity in other regions of the brain. No one knows whether it’s possible or 
not, but researchers are doing lots of interesting work in this area.
Miscellaneous adult stem cells
Researchers have identified stem cells — or at least cells that may turn out to 
be stem cells — in lots of human tissue types. However, the sum of scientific 
knowledge about some of these adult stem cell caches is relatively limited. 
For example, the skeletal muscles (muscles that are attached at one or both 
ends to bone) have stem cells, as do ovaries and testicles, and scientists 
know quite a bit about these particular stem cells. But scientists don’t yet 
know as much as they need to about other kinds of stem cells, such as those 
in the liver and pancreas.
Here’s a summary of some miscellaneous adult stem cell sources and what 
scientists know about them:
 
✓ Heart stem cells: Researchers have been debating whether the heart 
has its own stem cells for years, but the evidence is gradually tipping 
in favor of their existence, at least during fetal development. Whether 
any of these stem cells persist in the adult heart, or whether the adult 
heart is capable of replacing cells damaged by injury or disease, are 
lively areas of research. It may be that heart stem cells are rare, perhaps 
designed to replace only a few specific cells every now and then over 
the course of a lifetime.
 
✓ Intestinal stem cells: These stem cells live in the crevasses (called crypts) of 
the intestines, and their job is to maintain the intestinal lining. Interestingly, 
scientists only recently tracked intestinal stem cells to their hideouts and 
identified them positively. For a long time, although researchers knew there 
must be caches of stem cells somewhere in the intestines, they didn’t know 
which cells were stem cells or where they lived.

83
 Chapter 5: Understanding Adult Stem Cells
 
✓ Lung stem cells: Scientists have debated whether the lung has stem 
cells for years, but recent evidence suggests that lung stem cells do 
indeed exist. In fact, the lungs may harbor more than one kind of stem 
cell; researchers are just beginning their efforts to characterize these 
cells and determine exactly what they can and can’t do in the body.
 
✓ Pancreas stem cells: Scientists don’t agree on how many stem cell popu-
lations are in the pancreas, where they live, or whether they can gener-
ate new beta cells, the cells responsible for delivering insulin into the 
bloodstream. Some researchers think that maybe the stem cells don’t 
normally produce beta cells; perhaps a stash of inactive stem cells is 
activated to make new beta cells when the pancreas is injured.
 
✓ Skin stem cells: Skin stem cells are reasonably active because they 
replace the skin cells you shed every day through normal wear and tear. 
Researchers can grow skin stem cells in the lab and are investigating 
ways to create large sheets of skin to use in severe burns and other skin 
injuries (see Chapter 12).
For those tissues that don’t seem to have huge numbers of stem cells, 
researchers are trying to figure out why those stem cells can’t repair all the 
damage that occurs throughout life — even normal wear and tear. Perhaps 
these stem cells have limited capacities for repair and are called on only 
to provide those functions in specific circumstances. If that’s the case, and 
if researchers can devise a way to get those rare tissue stem cells to per-
form their latent repair and replenishing functions more aggressively, such 
advances could help treat myriad diseases.
Scientists also are working on using embryonic stem cells to make tissue 
stem cells, which in turn they can use to grow specific types of tissue cells. 
This approach has two big potential benefits: It can give researchers access 
to lots of genetically diverse cell populations, which is important for studying 
normal and disease development and for testing drugs and other therapies, 
and it can lay the foundation for growing genetically matched cells and tis-
sues in the lab for transplant.
The implications for transplant technology are particularly exciting. Getting 
enough tissue stem cells from an individual is difficult enough, especially in 
those tissues where stem cells are rare, such as the heart. When someone 
needs a transplant, though, harvesting the patient’s own stem cells is even 
more difficult because the organ or tissue has sustained severe damage — 
that’s why the patient needs a transplant. When the tissue is severely dam-
aged, the stem cells in that tissue may be overwhelmed or even destroyed; 
plus, going in to harvest these stem cells may make the patient even sicker. 
So you need to figure out other ways to provide the repair and replenishing 
activities of the worn out or missing stem cells.

84
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
 
Sometimes you don’t want to use the patient’s own stem cells for repairs 
because the stem cells may be defective from an inherited genetic defect. But 
the emerging technologies for generating bits and pieces of tissues in the lab — 
and being able to match those tissues to specific patients — provide exciting 
potential alternatives to current treatments.
Exploring Cord Blood Stem Cells
Stem cells from umbilical cord blood have gotten a lot of attention in recent 
years, particularly from people who are opposed to human embryonic stem 
cell research and want to present cord blood stem cells as a just-as-good 
alternative. Cord blood stem cells are obtained by draining and storing the 
blood from the umbilical cord after a baby is born. These stem cells can be 
used later to restore a child’s blood-forming system after chemotherapy, as 
long as they match the child’s immune system (so that they don’t attack the 
child’s tissues). Matching isn’t an issue if a child’s own cord blood is used, 
but if the cord blood is donated to another patient (see Chapter 14), the 
patient and the cord blood have to be a close genetic match.
 
A typical umbilical cord contains about 5 tablespoons of blood. The blood 
contains a high ratio of blood- and immune-forming stem cells, but it’s gener-
ally not enough to treat a large adult. Currently, cord blood is used mainly to 
treat children and sometimes small adults (see Chapter 14).
Stem cell researchers find cord blood interesting, but not generally as a 
substitute for human embryonic stem cells. Essentially, cord blood is bone 
marrow. It’s a little richer in hematopoietic stem cells than bone marrow, and 
it’s easier to obtain. But, like bone marrow, it contains only certain types of 
stem cells — hematopoietic, mesenchymal, and possibly some endothelial 
stem cells.
 
Claims that cord blood may contain truly pluripotent stem cells — the equiva-
lent of embryonic stem cells — rest on quite shaky evidence, and most stem 
cell researchers believe these claims will turn out to be incorrect.
However, the hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells in cord blood are, 
in some ways, better than their counterparts in bone marrow. Cord blood 
stem cells are less prone to rejection by the host’s immune system, for exam-
ple, and cord blood’s immune cells aren’t as well developed, so there’s less 
chance of rejection or graft-versus-host disease when cord blood cells are 
used in transplants.
The catch is that cord blood doesn’t have huge amounts of stem cells, and 
the blood-forming stem cells in cord blood — like those in bone marrow — 
won’t (as yet anyway) grow well in the lab. So if you need to do a transplant 
in an adult, a single unit of cord blood probably won’t provide enough stem 
cells to do the job.

85
 Chapter 5: Understanding Adult Stem Cells
 
As far as researchers know today, cord blood stem cells can give rise only to 
certain types of tissue cells: blood and some immune cells, connective tissue 
cells, and perhaps some endothelial cells. But you can’t make brain, liver, or 
other highly specialized tissue cells from cord blood stem cells – at least not 
yet.
Working with Adult Stem Cells
Although most research on adult stem cells is virtually free of political con-
troversy today, it does present unique challenges in the lab. In the first place, 
researchers have to find the caches of stem cells in various tissues, which 
isn’t always easy because tissue stem cells are fairly uncommon and often 
hide out in hard-to-locate niches. (See the section “Finding Stem Cells in 
Tissues,” earlier in this chapter.) Researchers also have to figure out how to 
remove the cells from the tissue without damaging them, the tissue, or the 
donor (if you’re harvesting them from living people). In animals, researchers 
sometimes use special marking methods that let them figure out the lineage 
of cells in a tissue and use those markers as a way of tracking back to find the 
ancestral stem cell. That process works fine in animals, where you can alter 
genes and develop these so-called lineage tracers, but you can’t really do that 
in humans. So researchers use the evidence from animals to identify compa-
rable cells in human tissues, such as the pancreas, liver, or intestine.
However, to isolate those cells from human tissues, you have to develop 
ways of growing and testing them to make sure that they’re the kinds of cells 
you think they are — or use other methods, such as fluorescent-activated cell 
sorting (see Chapter 4), to positively identify suspected stem cells.
 
Growing adult stem cells in the lab is itself a challenge. Some types of adult 
stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells, grow pretty well, while others, 
such as blood-forming stem cells from bone marrow and cord blood, don’t 
grow much at all. Even if the cells do grow in the lab, though, researchers 
have to keep them genetically stable and ensure that they retain their ability 
to grow and divide — and, at the same time, also retain their ability to make 
specialized cells. It’s a tricky process, which is why investigations into adult 
stem cells are research projects rather than isolate-the-cells-and-grow-a-new-
liver kinds of endeavors. (Of course, eventually scientists hope to reach the 
point where they can isolate stem cells and grow new tissues from them. But 
they’ve probably got many years of work in front of them before they get 
there.)
Finally, creating therapies from adult stem cells is challenging because each 
disease and each organ has its own particular issues. Just because stem cells 
in, say, the skin behave a certain way when the skin is damaged doesn’t mean 
stem cells in the brain will act in a similar fashion when the brain is damaged. 
Researchers may be able to find ways to make stem cells behave differently, 
but, again, they have a long road to travel before they get there.

E
ver since human embryonic stem cells were first isolated in 1998, stem 
cell scientists have been at the center of a firestorm of controversy, and 
many of them were woefully unprepared for the depth of feeling their work 
aroused among a broad cross-section of the general public. After all, they had 
been working with adult human stem cells and embryonic stem cells from 
animals for years without attracting much notice, much less questions about 
the morality of their research.
In this chapter, we introduce you to some intriguing approaches for generat-
ing stem cells that share important properties with human embryonic stem 
cells. For each method, we tell you how the process works (and how well it 
works), how it may help scientists find new treatments for disease, and about 
some of the ethical questions it raises. We also tell you about two special 
kinds of cells that have stem cell-like properties.
Why the Uproar?
Historically, stem cell researchers haven’t encountered many objections 
when their work involves adult stem cells or animal embryonic stem cells. But 
human embryonic stem cells are a whole different ethical and moral ballgame, 
raising a host of concerns for some people (see Chapter 15) that are largely 
absent when you talk about other kinds of stem cells. Partly in an effort to 
respond to those concerns, but primarily in an ongoing mission to find the best 
way to advance the research, stem cell scientists are investigating many differ-
ent methods for creating cells with similar properties as embryonic stem cells:
 
✓ The ability to renew themselves
 
✓ Pluripotency, the ability to give rise to all the cell types in the adult body

88
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
Some of these methods still involve using blastocysts — embryos that are a 
few days old — which is the main thing opponents of human embryonic stem 
research object to. But, in many ways, these blastocysts aren’t capable of 
developing into normal fetuses, and some researchers think that these meth-
ods (assuming that they all work with human cells) may make their work less 
controversial — at least to some people.
 
A few researchers have reported evidence that you can get truly pluripotent 
cells from umbilical cord blood, but the evidence is flimsy. Pluripotency is the 
ability to make all cell types in the body, not just all the cell types in a specific 
tissue, as is the case with blood-forming stem cells. Another report that gar-
nered headlines, about amniotic fluid containing pluripotent cells, appears to 
be wrong, too; those cells most likely are also a type of multipotent adult stem 
cell — probably a type of mesenchymal (connective tissue) stem cell.
Understanding Nuclear 
Transfer Techniques
When Philadelphia researcher Robert Briggs first applied for a grant from the 
National Cancer Institute in 1949 to study what happens when you put the 
nucleus of one cell into an egg cell whose nucleus has been removed — a pro-
cess called nuclear transfer — the NCI turned down his funding request with 
a rather snide dismissal of the concept as “a hare-brained scheme” that was 
unlikely to work, much less have any practical application. His second grant 
application was approved, and he and fellow scientist Thomas King set about 
their experiments.
Sixty years later, Briggs’s “hare-brained scheme” forms the basis of several 
techniques that stem cell researchers are using to figure out how to recreate 
the unique properties of stem cells. Nuclear transfer is a two-step process:
 
1. You take the nucleus out of an egg cell.
 
 This step makes the egg cell an enucleated cell, which is missing most 
of its DNA but still has mitochondrial DNA, RNA molecules, and proteins 
that appear to be capable of turning genes on and off in any new nucleus 
you give it.
 
2. You replace it with the nucleus from another cell.
Originally, scientists experimented with nuclear transfer to determine 
whether genetic material in the nucleus gets lost as cells develop — a theory 
that, for a long time, many scientists thought might be true. Briggs and King 
used the nuclei from embryonic frog cells to show that they could generate 

89
 Chapter 6: Exploring Other Stem Cell Sources
fully developed tadpoles when those nuclei were transplanted into enucle-
ated egg cells. But when scientists used nuclei from older, more devel-
oped cells, the transfer technique was far less successful in yielding viable 
embryos.
In 1958, British scientist John Gurdon showed that you can generate viable 
embryos using the nucleus of an intestinal cell from a tadpole, but that didn’t 
resolve the debate. Scientists didn’t know whether the donor nuclei came 
from cells that were truly differentiated — that is, cells with the structure 
and other components to be one and only one type of cell — or whether 
they were really rare stem cells with the ability to give rise to all types of 
cells in the body. The debate wasn’t settled until 2002, when researchers in 
Massachusetts conducted nuclear transfer experiments in mice, using the 
nuclei from a type of immune cell that has specific markers. Those markers 
allowed the researchers to track which cells in the newborn mice arose from 
the donor nucleus, thus showing that nuclei from adult cells have all the 
genetic information needed to permit development of a viable embryo.
 
Officials at the National Cancer Institute may have thought nuclear transfer 
was “hare-brained” because it involves creating viable embryos without fertil-
izing the egg cell — that is, without any sperm cell. How does a nonfertilized 
egg cell develop into an embryo? Researchers use electricity or chemicals 
to stimulate the egg cell to grow and divide, just as it would if it fused with a 
sperm cell. (We know: It sounds like Dr. Frankenstein. But researchers really 
do use chemicals and jolts of electricity to activate unfertilized egg cells — 
although most of them forego the maniacal laugh when they do it.)
Today, stem cell researchers use nuclear transfer techniques to try to create 
cells that have many of the same properties as embryonic stem cells: the 
ability to make more of themselves, and the ability to give rise to all the cell 
types in the fully developed body.
In the following sections, we take you through these techniques, showing you 
their strengths and weaknesses.
Getting inside somatic 
cell nuclear transfer
A somatic cell is any cell in the fully developed body except egg cells or sperm 
cells (these reproductive cells are called germ cells). Skin cells are somatic, 
as are liver cells, kidney cells, heart cells, muscle cells, and so on. Somatic 
cells are sometimes called adult cells.
In somatic cell nuclear transfer, or SCNT, scientists take the nucleus from a 
somatic cell and transplant it into an enucleated egg cell. Then they prompt 
the SCNT cell to begin developing by treating it with electricity or chemicals. 

90
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
Figure 6-1 shows the SCNT process and how it generates cells that are similar 
in many ways to embryonic stem cells.

If the egg cell and the somatic cell come from the same donor, the resulting 
embryo (and eventually adult organism) is an exact genetic copy, or clone, of 
the donor because the donor provided all the DNA. If the egg cell comes from 
a different donor, the offspring has a slightly different genetic makeup than the 
somatic cell donor because the cytoplasm — the viscous substance outside 
the nucleus — contains mitochondria with small bits of DNA from the egg cell 
donor. However, the ratio of nuclear DNA to mitochondrial DNA is something 
like 99.999 to 0.001, so, for all practical purposes, the offspring is considered 
to be nearly genetically identical. (Technically, this latter situation creates a 
cytoplasmic hybrid, or cybrid, because the nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA 
come from different women; see Chapter 7 for more on cybrids, cloning, and 
other technologies.)
To stem cell scientists, the attraction of SCNT is that, theoretically, you can 
create blastocysts with this technique and extract the inner cell mass to gen-
erate cells with many of the properties of embryonic stem cells. These SCNT 
cells are identical — or nearly identical — to a patient’s own genetic makeup. 
(See Chapter 4 for more on how researchers grow embryonic stem cells.) 
Then, again theoretically, you could use those embryonic stem cells to grow 
replacement tissues or use them to deliver drugs or other materials to treat a 
disease, and the patient’s body wouldn’t reject the cells or tissues because it 
wouldn’t recognize them as foreign.

91
 Chapter 6: Exploring Other Stem Cell Sources
All these ideas are theoretical because, so far, no one has succeeded in grow-
ing human embryonic stem cells from SCNT blastocysts. But some research-
ers have created human SCNT blastocysts, so they expect to be able to 
derive embryonic stem cells from this technique eventually.
 
Although scientists have cloned all sorts of animals, virtually no one in the 
scientific community thinks it’s a good idea to try to clone humans. For one 
thing, cloning people is ethically problematic. For another, the technology 
isn’t anywhere near safe enough to try it in humans. Most — perhaps all — of 
the cloned animals created so far have been abnormal in some way, and the 
few people who have claimed to have created actual human babies via SCNT 
have been exposed as frauds. (See Chapter 7 for more on the problems with 
cloned animals and Chapter 15 for a discussion of the moral and ethical con-
cerns about cloning.)
Bringing embryo development to a 
halt with altered nuclear transfer
Altered nuclear transfer, or ANT, was developed as a result of ethical concerns 
about somatic cell nuclear transfer (see the preceding section). When you 
make a human blastocyst from somatic cell nuclear transfer, you make a 
clone that, in theory at least, may be capable of developing into a baby. If you 
view the moral status of the blastocyst (see Chapter 15) as the equivalent 
of a person, somatic cell nuclear transfer is morally problematic because it, 
in essence, creates a human life that will be destroyed when you extract the 
inner cell mass.
To get around this ethical conundrum, some stem cell scientists began 
exploring the idea of creating blastocysts that are physiologically incapable 
of developing into fetuses. They already knew that a gene called CDX2 plays 
a critical role in early development. In mice that are missing the CDX2 gene, 
development is normal in the very earliest stages, but becomes abnormal by 
the blastocyst stage. The blastocyst has an inner cell mass but can’t implant 
in the uterine wall because it can’t form the trophectoderm — the layer of 
cells that gives rise to the placenta and umbilical cord. Without those fea-
tures, the blastocyst can’t get the nutrients it needs from the mother’s body 
to continue developing.
However, because development of the inner cell mass appears to proceed 
normally up to the blastocyst stage, you can, in theory, extract the inner cell 
mass and generate cells with many of the properties of embryonic stem cells. 
At least one research team has done this experiment with mouse cells, using 
the following steps (see Figure 6-2):

5. They ended up with a defective blastocyst that couldn’t implant in the 
uterus and then extracted the inner cell mass.
 
6. They derived stem cells from the inner cell mass.
 
Although the ANT technique was developed specifically to address ethi-
cal concerns some people have about creating potential human life simply 
to destroy it, the ethics of ANT itself are far from clear. It depends on when 
you believe personhood begins (see Chapter 15). If you believe blastocysts 
deserve consideration as persons, then neither somatic cell nuclear transfer 
nor ANT may be acceptable because the defective blastocyst is destroyed in 
both methods. On the other hand, because nuclear transfer doesn’t involve 
fertilization of the egg cell — the altered cells are stimulated to begin develop-
ing through a jolt of electricity or exposure to certain chemicals that make 
them behave the way a fertilized egg cell behaves — the question of whether 
these (probably defective) blastocysts really constitute human life also arises 
for some people.
As far as we know, no one has used ANT with human cells yet, so the ethical 
considerations may be moot, at least for now. However, the concept has been 

93
 Chapter 6: Exploring Other Stem Cell Sources
proven with mouse cells, and the technology seems to work, so it’s probably 
just a matter of time before scientists and laypeople alike have to wrestle 
with these questions.
Exploring Other Techniques for 
Generating Pluripotent Cells
Technology and nature present other possibilities for generating stem cells 
that behave similarly to embryonic stem cells. Scientists use two of these 
methods — one derived from technological advances in treating infertility 
and one adapted from nature — to derive pluripotent cells for study.
The following sections describe these processes and their pros and cons.
Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis
Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis developed as a result of advances in fertil-
ity treatments, namely in vitro fertilization, or IVF. In IVF, egg cells and sperm 
cells are fused in the lab, cultured in a dish for a few days (to the blastocyst 
stage), and then implanted in the woman’s uterus in an attempt to start a 
pregnancy. Couples whose offspring may be at risk of developing genetic dis-
eases often choose to have their IVF embryos tested so that they can elimi-
nate the embryos with the genetic defect and use only normal embryos to try 
to initiate a pregnancy.
In pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD, the fertility clinic generates 
several eight-cell embryos and then extracts a single cell from each embryo 
and tests its DNA to see whether it carries the genetic defect. Removing a 
single cell at this stage of embryo development doesn’t seem to harm the 
embryo, and the genetic testing can identify a range of potential diseases, 
as well as the embryo’s sex and other conditions like deafness. PGD is often 
used when the parents carry genes that can give their offspring a fatal illness, 
such as Niemann-Pick (see Chapter 9), or a chronic ailment like hemophilia (a 
blood-clotting disorder).
The process for PGD opens up possibilities for generating embryonic stem 
cells without harming the embryo. If you can extract a single cell from an 
eight-cell embryo for testing, you can do it to generate a stem cell line, right? 
In fact, a Massachusetts biotech company did it. It used the same technique 
to extract the single cell and then grew that cell into a collection of embry-
onic stem cells. Figure 6-3 shows how this process works.

Even though using the PGD technique to generate embryonic stem cells 
appears to be safe for the embryo, and therefore ethical, the process does 
raise some questions. First are the moral and ethical aspects of rejecting 
embryos simply because of a genetic predisposition to disease (or, even more 
problematic, based on the embryo’s sex). Second, is it more ethical to take 
cells from leftover IVF blastocysts that are destined to be destroyed anyway 
(see Chapter 4), or to risk damaging an embryo that’s intended to start a 
pregnancy? Does the fact that the embryo (usually) survives with the PGD 
technique trump the potential risk to the embryo? (See Chapter 15 for a full 
discussion of moral and ethical concerns about human embryonic stem cell 
research.)
Males need not apply: Parthenogenesis
Parthenogenesis is one of those strange quirks of nature. The term comes 
from the Greek word parthenos, meaning virgin, and genesis, meaning origin; 
it refers to the process by which some insects and animals (mainly reptiles) 
reproduce without any male involvement. Mature females give rise to female 
offspring; their egg cells develop without fertilization.
Mammals don’t seem to be able to reproduce this way; at least, no one knows 
of any mammals that can do it. In mammals, the DNA in the sperm cell is 
modified differently from the DNA in the egg cell, and that subtlety is impor-
tant for controlling genes properly in the resulting embryo and fetus.

95
 Chapter 6: Exploring Other Stem Cell Sources
 
But scientists have figured out that you can take egg cells from mice or 
humans and activate them with chemicals or electricity, and they’ll start grow-
ing and dividing. If you stimulate and culture the egg cells correctly, the DNA 
in the cells doubles (to compensate for the lack of DNA from a sperm cell), 
and you end up with a blastocyst. And, of course, when you have a blastocyst, 
you can extract the inner cell mass and use it to generate stem cells (see 
Chapter 4). Figure 6-4 shows how parthenogenesis works in the lab.

Parthenogenetic blastocysts are terrible candidates for developing into 
fetuses or babies. With one exception that we know of, scientists have never 
used these blastocysts to create adult animals; one team did create an adult 
mouse from parthenogenesis, but it took an enormous amount of genetic engi-
neering to do so, simply because there’s no DNA from a male donor.
However, parthenogenetic blastocysts can produce usable stem cells. And, 
in theory, those stem cells — or cells derived from them — should be geneti-
cally compatible with the woman who donated the egg cell, so you could 
generate patient-specific stem cell lines (for women, anyway) from parthe-
nogenesis. Such cells also could be used in men, as long as the cells and 
patient’s genetic makeup are reasonably well matched.

96
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
Scientists haven’t done a lot of work with parthenogenesis yet, but some 
companies are working on it. From an ethical standpoint, some people think 
parthenogenesis is a reasonable alternative because the blastocysts can 
never become a human adult. Others are opposed to this technique, viewing 
it as a sort of back door to human cloning, or because they oppose creation 
of any type of human blastocyst
Investigating Other Pluripotent 
Cell Types
Embryonic stem cells are the most famous pluripotent cells — cells that can 
give rise to all the types of cells in the adult body — but they aren’t the only 
ones with that remarkably useful capability. Scientists have identified plu-
ripotent cells in rare tumors that form in the gonads (ovaries and testicles), 
and a specific set of embryonic cells called primordial germ cells. Researchers 
also are refining ways to engineer or reprogram adult cells so that they 
become pluripotent.
We explore these lesser known types of pluripotent cells in the following 
sections.
Collecting stem cells from tumors
Every once in a while, benign tumors called teratomas form on the ovary or 
the testicle. Teratomas contain cells from all three germ layers in the embryo 
(see Chapter 2); sometimes you find hair, teeth, and all kinds of weird things 
in these tumors.
Sometimes teratomas become cancerous (and are then called teratocarcino-
mas). Scientists can grow malignant teratocarcinomas in the lab, and some of 
the cells that arise from that growth acquire the characteristics of a specific 
type of cancer cell called an embryonal carcinoma cell, or EC cell. EC cells, 
like other cancer stem cells (see Chapter 8), can give rise to all the cell types 
in a cancerous tumor. The EC-like cells from malignant teratomas also are 
essentially pluripotent.
In the mouse, these cells are reasonably stable, genetically speaking. In 
humans, though, these cells tend to have a lot of chromosome abnormalities, 

97
 Chapter 6: Exploring Other Stem Cell Sources
and they tend to make mistakes in cell division. Scientists have studied them 
for decades. In fact, these cells helped launch the idea that you could grow 
some kinds of pluripotent cells in a dish.
Exploring reproductive sources 
of pluripotent cells
The human reproductive system is amazing in so many ways — not least 
of which is the way germ cells (egg cells in women and sperm cells in men) 
retain their ability to pass the instructions for all the right cells along to the 
next generation.
A key player in reproduction is the primordial germ cell, which gives rise to 
egg cells in the female and sperm cells in the male. Egg and sperm cells have 
to be able to create undifferentiated cells in order to generate a blastocyst. 
So the primordial germ cell has to retain some pluripotent-like properties 
because it’s responsible for creating the cells that, in turn, will create the 
next generation.
If you extract primordial germ cells right at the beginning of gonad formation 
in the fetus (five to nine weeks after conception; these cells are taken from 
induced-abortion fetuses), you can grow them in a dish, and, over time, you 
end up with pluripotent cells known as embryonic germ cells, or EG cells.
EG cells differ from embryonic stem cells and EC cells (see the preceding sec-
tion) in technical ways: They grow differently and exhibit different behaviors, 
and some modifications in the DNA are different. They’re harder to get and 
a little harder to work with than human embryonic stem cells. But they’re 
useful for studying pluripotency, and some researchers are looking at poten-
tial therapeutic uses for them.
 
The adult testicle also provides a source of (apparently) pluripotent cells: the 
spermagonial stem cell. These cells are difficult to grow in the lab, but when sci-
entists can isolate and grow them, the cells seem to have pluripotent properties.
Pluripotent cells from the germ lines are difficult to get and difficult to grow, 
and they’re not identical to embryonic stem cells. But these cells do have 
properties that scientists find useful to study.

98
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
Engineering stem cells
Nuclear transfer experiments (see “Understanding Nuclear Transfer 
Techniques” earlier in this chapter) have led stem cell scientists to look for 
ways to reprogram adult cells so that they revert to a pluripotent state. It’s 
really a matter of logical deduction: If you can put the nucleus of an adult cell 
into an enucleated egg cell and generate a blastocyst, there must be some-
thing (or several somethings) in the enucleated egg cell that instructs the 
transplanted nucleus to “turn on” its pluripotency.
The question was whether you could reprogram cells in the lab without going 
through nuclear transfer. In 2006, Japanese researcher Shinya Yamanaka 
announced a way to do it: He discovered that, if you put four specific genes 
into mouse or human skin cells, those cells appear to become pluripotent. 
The evidence is pretty good that they are indeed pluripotent, at least in the 
mouse; in mouse skin cells, these genetically modified cells, called induced 
pluripotent cells (often abbreviated as iPS cells), pass all the gold standard 
tests for pluripotency.
Skin cells are much easier to get than embryonic stem cells, and the method 
for creating iPS cells is so straightforward that lots of researchers are using it 
to create cells for their own areas of study. In just a few years, iPS cells have 
become an almost standard research tool.
 
Some people argue that, with the advent of iPS cells, researchers don’t need to 
study human embryonic stem cells. But even Yamanaka thinks it’s premature 
to ditch human embryonic stem cells in favor of iPS. The two cell types share 
a lot of characteristics, but researchers have yet to identify the precise simi-
larities and differences between iPS and embryonic stem cells.
The other main reason that most scientists think iPS cells aren’t quite ready 
to replace embryonic stem cells is that the original methods Yamanaka came 
up with involve using viruses to deposit the genes inside the skin cells (see 
Figure 6-5). Those viruses have to land somewhere, so they could disrupt 
genes in the skin cells. Also, some of the genes used in this method can cause 
cancer under certain circumstances. So, although iPS cells are fantastic 
research tools, they’re not yet appropriate for transplants or other therapies.
That said, a lot of researchers are looking for — and beginning to find — 
other, safer ways to induce pluripotency in adult cells. And they’ll probably 
find safer methods because when you know a thing can be done, it’s really a 
matter of testing various ways to do it.

 Chapter 6: Exploring Other Stem Cell Sources
 
All the different types of cells we discuss in this chapter have useful proper-
ties and will help scientists solve problems in understanding and treating 
human disease. Each type of cell has its own strengths and weaknesses, and 
the key to making the most rapid scientific and medical progress is for scien-
tists as a community to work on them all simultaneously to look for the break-
throughs that are going to help them understand and treat disease.

Understanding Why Scientists 
Mix and Match Cells
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the differences among hybrids, chimeras, clones, and cybrids
▶ Exploring the uses and purposes for mixed-and-matched cells and organisms
▶ Understanding the roots of some ethical concerns
T
o many people, the very words used to describe the results of mixing 
and matching cells from different people and even different species — 
chimera, clone, cybrid — are frightening, evoking memories of a long series of 
scary sci-fi movies. Hybrid is a more familiar term and therefore usually less 
frightening; after all, hybrid cars, which use a combination of gas and elec-
tricity for power, are a good thing, right? But the other terms are straight out 
of scary-future movies like Blade Runner and The Terminator.
You may feel better about these terms if you remember that you’re a hybrid; 
all humans are, because all humans start out as a zygote (see Chapter 4) with 
the DNA of both parents. If you have an identical twin, you’re also a clone; a 
clone is just a copy, and identical twins are genetic copies of each other. You 
also may be a chimera, carrying two separate sets of genetic material, each in 
different cells of your body; while human chimeras were long believed to be 
extremely rare, recent research indicates they may be much more common 
than originally thought. A few people are even cybrids, thanks to techniques 
for treating infertility.
In this chapter, we explain these terms in detail — how they’re made in nature 
and in the lab, how they differ from one another, and how they’ve been used to 
advance scientific knowledge. We start with hybrids, because most people are 
familiar with many examples of hybrids. Then we tackle chimeras, clones, and 
cybrids — the real-life varieties, not the Hollywood versions.

102
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
 
The techniques we describe in this chapter have been used without contro-
versy for years — some of them for decades and even centuries — to discover 
principles of heredity, create hardier crops, study diseases, make insulin for 
diabetics, and help infertile couples have children, among other things. Since 
human embryonic stem cells were first isolated in 1998, many of these tech-
niques have come under intense scrutiny and (often misinformed) criticism as 
they relate to work with human cells, especially embryonic cells. We provide a 
brief discussion here of the ethical concerns that have been raised over these 
techniques in the context of stem cell research. (For more on many of the 
moral and ethical issues of stem cell research, turn to Chapter 15.)
Exploring Hybrids
The word hybrid is used in a number of different contexts — and not always 
correctly. Strictly speaking, a hybrid is simply an organism that has genetic 
material from two different parents who are not genetically identical. All 
humans are effectively hybrids because each person carries genetic informa-
tion from both parents (who, in turn, are hybrids of their parents). Figure 7-1 
shows different types of common hybrids.
Hybrids within a single species include humans, crops, and dog breeds. 
Then there are hybrids between species, such as the mule (a cross between 
a female horse and a male donkey) and the hinny (a cross between a male 
horse and a female donkey). Some people mistakenly refer to chimeras and 
cybrids as hybrids, but hybrids aren’t the same thing. (See the sections 
“Decoding Chimeras” and “Discovering Cybrids,” later in this chapter).
Hybridization (the generation of hybrids) is common. Farmers have used it 
almost since the beginning of agriculture to cultivate crops that are resistant 
to certain diseases or insects. You can cross-fertilize different breeds within 
the same species, which is how seed companies come up with new varieties 
of corn, wheat, and other crops, and how dog breeders come up with so-
called designer breeds like the Labradoodle (a Labrador-poodle mix) and the 
Cockapoo (a Cocker spaniel-poodle mix). You also can cross-fertilize different 
species sometimes.
 
Hybrids have two different genetic libraries in the fertilized egg (called a 
zygote). The mother and father each contribute their own genetic library.

Creating stronger versions of species
In many species, hybrids are stronger or hardier than either of their par-
ents — a quality called hybrid vigor. Crossbred dogs, for example, tend to 
be healthier than purebreds; they often live longer and are less prone to ill-
nesses that are common in purebreds.
Hybrids also can be selectively bred to bring out certain desired traits. In 
agriculture, scientists create hybrids designed to produce more or better 
seeds or fruits or to resist disease and insects. They also make crops to 
weather harsh conditions like drought, heat, or cold. Horticulturalists create 
hybrids that produce more and bigger blooms or new colors.
Common plant hybrids include
  
✓ Peppermint: A hybrid of spearmint and water mint.
  
✓ Tangelo: A hybrid of Mandarin orange and grapefruit, believed to have 
been developed in Asia around 1500 B.C.
  
✓ Wheat: The wheat used to make bread flour is a hybrid of three wild 
grasses; pasta flour wheat (durum wheat, which is milled into semolina) 
is a hybrid of two wild grasses.
 
Hybrids aren’t the same as genetic mutations. Mutations typically affect a 
single gene, and, while mutations can be passed on to offspring in both plants 
and animals, they’re fairly rare. Hybrids, on the other hand, can generally 
be thought of as containing multiple genetic variations in offspring and, in 
humans, lead to variations, such as the spectrum of hair and eye color and 
body type. Successful plant hybrids can evolve into distinct new species; 
genetic mutations rarely lead to new species.
Using hybrids in the lab
Scientists typically create hybrid plants and animals to study principles of 
heredity — how certain traits or characteristics are passed on to subsequent 
generations. Sometimes this work involves genetic engineering to promote spe-
cific desired characteristics, such as higher yields or insect resistance in crops.
 
Hybridization happens all the time in nature. But, in recent years, the term 
has been misapplied to stem cell research, mainly by people opposed to using 
egg cells from animals to create human embryonic stem cells. Opponents call 
these research efforts human-animal hybrids, raising the specter of fully devel-
oped animals with human characteristics, or vice versa. In reality, the process 
of mixing animal egg cells with human tissue cells creates a cybrid, which is 
most often used for research. This type of cybrid is not capable of making 
humans with animal bodies, faces, or other features, or vice versa. (See the 
section “Discovering Cybrids,” later in this chapter.)

105
 Chapter 7: Understanding Why Scientists Mix and Match Cells
Decoding Chimeras
In Greek mythology, the Chimera (pronounced KI-mer-uh or ki-MER-uh) was 
a fire-breathing lion whose tail was a serpent and who had a goat’s head pro-
truding from its back. In real life, chimeras are way more cool.
In some chimeras, cells can be descended from two different sets of parents. 
The cells don’t mix their contents; rather, cells in one part of the chimera’s 
body are from one set of parents, and cells in another part of the body are 
from a different set of parents. In the lab, for example, scientists can fuse an 
embryo from a breed of black mice with an embryo from a breed of white 
mice, and the baby mouse will have patches of black and white fur. The 
patches aren’t just different pigments; they actually have different DNA. 
Figure 7-2 shows a chimeric black-and-white mouse.
People who have organ or bone marrow transplants can be thought of as chi-
meras because the donor cells have different DNA than the recipient.

Finding the chimera within
 
Some people are natural chimeras; they carry cells from an unborn fraternal 
twin. (Fraternal twins come from two separate zygotes; identical twins are 
created when one zygote or blastocyst splits into two zygotes or blastocysts.) 
In fact, recent research indicates that chimeras may be far more common 
than once believed, simply based on birth statistics. Here’s how spontaneous 
human chimeras arise:
 
1. Two zygotes (fused egg and sperm cells) travel down the fallopian 
tubes toward the uterus, growing and dividing into multiple-celled 
embryos as they go.
 
2. The growing embryos come into contact with each other, and one 
absorbs the other, or they fuse together.
 
 (This step can happen later, too, after one or both of the embryos 
implants in the uterine wall.)
 
3. The absorbed embryo supplies cells with its own DNA to the body of 
the developing embryo.
 
4. The resulting baby (and eventually adult) is composed of cells with 
two different genetic libraries — one set of cells from each of the two 
embryos that fused.
If this scenario sounds like something you’ve seen on TV, you’re right: 
Chimeras have been used in plots on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Grey’s 
Anatomy, and House, M.D. For once, though, Hollywood may have gotten the 
science right. Some chimerism experts say as many as one in every eight con-
ceptions and live births is a single twin — that is, a single baby whose frater-
nal twin vanished at some point during development. And Dutch researchers 
have argued that as many as 30 percent of all people are chimeras.
A couple of high-profile cases have brought human chimerism into the lime-
light. A 52-year-old woman who needed a kidney transplant was told that 
she couldn’t be the mother of two of her three sons; they weren’t a genetic 
match. The sons were clearly the offspring of their father, so it wasn’t a case 
of taking the wrong babies home from the hospital.
Of course, cases of false paternity are pretty common, but false maternity? 
That’s just bizarre. But initial tests to determine whether any of the sons were 
a suitable match showed that, while they were definitely brothers, the woman 
wasn’t the mother of two of them. Additional testing of the woman’s hair and 
tissues revealed that some of her egg cells carried different genetic information 
than other tissues, such as her blood. Thus, this woman may be a chimera, the 
result of two separate embryos that fused together in her mother’s uterus.
A similar case involved a woman who was charged with welfare fraud after 
initial DNA testing indicated the children she claimed as hers couldn’t be 

107
 Chapter 7: Understanding Why Scientists Mix and Match Cells
hers. Again, additional testing showed that the woman’s body was composed 
of two genetically different cell types.
Fusion of male and female embryos or absorption of a female embryo by a 
male embryo in the womb also may account for some cases of boys who have 
both testicles and some ovarian tissue.
 
Most chimeric people never know they’re carrying around the vestiges of their 
unborn twin because development seems to proceed normally in spontane-
ous chimeras. If both cell lines in a chimera are normal and of the same sex, 
there’s no naked-eye way to distinguish them from people who never shared 
the womb with a twin. And even if the cell lines are of different sexes, often 
there’s no reason to investigate the possibility of chimerism.
Chimerism has implications for blood transfusions and organ and tissue 
transplants. Although rare, chimeric blood has caused problems in recipi-
ents who otherwise matched the blood type they received. In organ and 
tissue transplants, researchers long knew that chimeric cells were produced 
by the recipient’s body after the transplant. But in 2005, researchers in the 
Netherlands conducted autopsies on 46 women who hadn’t had transplants 
and said they found chimeric male cells in half the autopsied women. The 
researchers looked only for cells with the XY, or male, chromosome and 
noted that, based on their findings, they’d expect to find female chimeric 
cells in high numbers, too.
Using chimeras to improve medicine
Scientists routinely create chimeric mice and other animals to study specific dis-
eases and test potential treatments. For example, cancer researchers inject mice 
with human cancer cells; these chimeric mice are then used to test cancer drugs.
Researchers studying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis — ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s 
disease — make chimeric mice with a mixture of normal neurons and neurons 
that are genetically programmed to produce ALS. In this disease, motor neurons 
die, and patients progressively lose voluntary muscle or movement control.
Mixing normal and diseased neurons in mice helps researchers discover 
exactly what goes wrong as ALS progresses. Do normal neurons wither and 
die if they’re surrounded by ALS neurons? Conversely, if ALS neurons are 
surrounded by normal neurons, can those normal neurons be induced to per-
form rescue functions for the sick neurons? Initial research on these chimeric 
animals suggests that ALS may not be a disease solely of motor neurons, and 
that introducing new non-neuronal cells into the ALS motor neurons’ environ-
ment may be an effective therapy — at least in mice. Scientists are pursu-
ing this line of investigation, conducting more tests and experiments to see 
whether this approach may lead to a useful therapy for humans.

Comprehending Clones
For decades, novelists and filmmakers have been scaring people out of their 
wits with the specter of cloning. In the 1978 movie The Boys from Brazil, 
the notorious Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele plotted the rise of a Fourth Reich with 
clones of Adolph Hitler. And, in the Star Wars saga, an entire movie is devoted 
to the Attack of the Clones.
Cloning effectively means copying. Thus, in real-life biology, the term clone is 
used to refer to many different things, including (but not limited to) situations 
where two (or more) organisms are genetically identical. Identical human twins 
are clones because they have the same genetic makeup; identical twins are cre-
ated when an early human embryo splits in two. Fraternal twins are not clones 
because fraternal twins come from two separate zygotes; even though they 
share DNA from their parents, their genetic makeup isn’t identical.
Cloning is more common than you may think. If you’ve ever taken a cutting 
from a plant and given it to a friend, you’ve essentially cloned that plant. 
Scientists use cloning for all kinds of things — to make human insulin (see 
the following section); to study various forms of disease, such as cancer, 
and test drugs; and even to make genetically identical mice to study normal 
development and disease progression. Figure 7-3 shows these different types 
of cloning.
Among other cloning methods, stem cell scientists use a technique called 
somatic cell nuclear transfer, or SCNT, to create genetically matched copies of 
specific cells or animals. They remove the nucleus (which contains most of 
the genetic material) of, say, a mouse egg cell (called an enucleated cell) and 
replace it with the nucleus of a mouse tissue cell — a skin cell, for example. 
(Chapter 6 describes this process in detail.) When this technique is done 
properly, the resulting cell grows and divides the same way a normal fertil-
ized egg does, creating a blastocyst. Scientists can extract the inner cell mass 
of this blastocyst to derive stem cells and induce those cells to grow into spe-
cific cell types.
Scientists can also use the SCNT method to generate animals that are geneti-
cally identical to existing adult animals. The most famous real-life engineered 
cloned animal is Dolly the sheep (see Figure 7-4). She was the first mammal 
scientists created using the SCNT technology with adult tissue cells (see 
Chapter 6). Since her birth in the mid-1990s, researchers have used similar 
methods to create “cloned” mice, pigs, cows, and other animals.
In 2009, South Korean researchers announced they had used SCNT to gener-
ate cloned beagles with added special fluorescent genes that make them glow 
red under ultraviolet light. The scientists used SCNT to create these dogs; 
they inserted the fluorescent genes into skin cells and then used the nuclei 
from those skin cells to generate the embryos that eventually grew into the 
“glowing” dogs.

Using cloning methods to develop therapies
Several different cloning technologies (see Chapter 6) have been incredibly 
useful in developing animals that have human diseases, or at least some 
symptoms of those diseases; such animals are called research models, and 
scientists use them to study disease and even develop therapies for illnesses. 
Cancer researchers, for example, make lots of copies, or clones, of human 
cancer cells and then inject them into mice to study how cancer progresses 
and to test potential cancer-fighting drugs.

Drug companies make human insulin via cloning techniques that involve 
recombinant DNA, or combining gene fragments from different species (see 
Chapter 6). They make lots of copies of the genes that make human insulin, 
put the cloned (copied) genes in special bacteria, and use the mixture to 
make the insulin that diabetics take to regulate their blood sugar.
Cloned human insulin was an enormous advance in treating diabetes. Before 
the development of recombinant DNA, insulin came solely from pig pancreas, 
which is similar — but not identical — to human insulin. The similarity 
made pig insulin a good option for treating diabetes, but because pig insulin 
isn’t identical to human insulin, some people developed allergies to it. With 
recombinant DNA technology, insulin can be genetically matched to patients, 
so allergic reactions are no longer a concern.
 
Genetic researchers commonly use different types of cloning techniques to 
study aspects of heredity, gene behavior, and even potential gene therapies. 
Even the cloned glowing dogs (see the preceding section) represent thera-
peutic possibilities — not because they’re fluorescent, but because scientists 
inserted the gene that makes them glow. If researchers can develop ways to 
insert specific genetic traits into human stem cells made from cloning meth-
ods, they may be able to correct and learn how to treat the genetic problems 
that cause diseases like Type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, 
Parkinson’s, and a host of other illnesses.

111
 Chapter 7: Understanding Why Scientists Mix and Match Cells
Using cloning for research
 
The cloned cells and animals that scientists create in the lab using the SCNT 
method aren’t usually true clones; that is, they aren’t 100-percent genetic 
matches to the donor cell because the egg cell and tissue cell typically come 
from different donors. The egg cell has a very small amount of DNA in the mito-
chondria, tiny bits of genetic material found in the egg cell’s cytoplasm (the 
watery substance outside the nucleus). However, because most genetic mate-
rial is in the nucleus, the resulting cells are thought to be close enough to be a 
genetic match to the tissue cell donor. (See the section “Discovering Cybrids,” 
later in this chapter.)
This type of technology has great potential for therapeutics. Rejection of 
donor tissues and organs is a huge hurdle in transplants; transplant patients 
typically have to take powerful drugs that suppress their immune systems 
so that their bodies don’t attack the donor tissues. Suppressing the immune 
system makes these patients more susceptible to infection, and even infec-
tions that would be minor in healthy individuals pose significant risks to 
transplant patients. (See Chapter 13 for more on the challenges of transplant-
ing organs and tissues.)
Using nuclear transfer to generate stem cells (sometimes called therapeutic 
cloning) raises the possibility of creating replacement tissues and organs 
from a patient’s own cells, thus eliminating the problem of rejection and the 
need for lifelong immune suppression.
This technique also helps scientists learn more about specific diseases and 
potential drug therapies. If you can use SCNT to clone cancer cells, for exam-
ple, or cells with the genetic markers for Alzheimer’s or other neurological 
disorders, you can test a lot of different chemicals on differentiated versions 
of those cells, such as new blood cells or new brain cells, in the lab to see 
which ones work, which ones don’t work, and which ones work but produce 
serious side effects.
 
Technically, cells and animals created through nuclear transfer techniques 
are also cybrids. (See the section “Discovering Cybrids,” later in this chapter.) 
However, media reports — and scientists themselves — most often refer to 
this technique as cloning.
Understanding the difficulties 
of cloning primates
Despite the claims of some — we’ll be polite and call them unconventional — 
self-described researchers, no one has yet engineered a cloned human being. 
More important, virtually no one in the mainstream, reputable medical or 

112
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
scientific communities wants to create fully developed human babies using 
cloning technology, and hardly anybody thinks it’s either safe or possible 
even if there was a general desire to do it.
In fact, until recently, no one using nuclear transfer technology had been 
able to generate any primate embryo, much less human embryos. Several 
research teams have attempted to create nuclear transfer primate embryos, 
but, until 2007, none of these attempts yielded stem cells; attempts to use 
such embryos to initiate pregnancies also failed. (Some have claimed to 
generate human embryos using nuclear transfer methods, but most of those 
claims either turned out to be false or are widely regarded as elaborate 
hoaxes; see the nearby sidebar, “Unproven human cloning claims.”)
The stumbling block for cloning primates through SCNT (see the previous 
section) may lie in the process of removing the nucleus from the egg cell. 
Some scientists have suggested that, in primates, the egg cell nucleus con-
tains materials that are essential to normal development, and when you 
remove the nucleus, you remove these materials. Other scientists theorize 
that traditional nuclear transfer methods somehow damage the egg cell. 
Research to answer that question is ongoing.
 
In 2007, a research team in Oregon produced the first SCNT primate embryos, 
using cells from rhesus monkeys. Instead of using dyes and ultraviolet light to 
locate the egg cell’s genetic material, the Oregon researchers used polarized 
light (similar to the way sunglasses work to reduce glare and deepen colors) 
to illuminate the egg cell’s genetic material so that they could remove it. The 
process apparently is less damaging to the egg cells than the traditional dye-
and-ultraviolet light technique.
The research team inserted skin cell nuclei from an adult male monkey into 
304 egg cells from 14 female monkeys. The cells were then jolted with elec-
tricity to get them to grow and divide, creating blastocysts that were genetic 
copies of the adult male monkey. The scientists were able to create two 
embryonic stem cell lines from the embryos. Because of previous scandals 
involving this line of research (see the “Unproven human cloning claims” 
sidebar), the journal Nature asked independent experts from Australia to con-
firm key aspects of the Oregon team’s work and published the review along 
with the original research.
Although the Oregon research is important and promising, its low success 
rate — only two stem cell lines created from more than 300 embryos — poses 
significant technical and ethical obstacles. However, the research does prove 
that it’s possible to generate primate embryos using this technology, and fur-
ther experiments may yield critical advances in studying human diseases in 
human (rather than animal) tissues. For example, researchers could use skin 
cells from Alzheimer’s patients to generate SCNT embryos and grow stem 
cells from those embryos, which would carry the same genetic information 
as the Alzheimer’s patient and give scientists living human cells to study the 
disease’s development and progression.

113
 Chapter 7: Understanding Why Scientists Mix and Match Cells
In 2008, Stemagen, a Californian human embryonic research company, 
announced that it had successfully created human embryos using SCNT. The 
embryos didn’t yield stem cells, but the company believes its cloning tech-
nique eventually will lead to the creation of viable stem cell lines.
Unproven human cloning claims
Ever since Dolly the cloned sheep was born in 
the mid-1990s, people inside and outside the 
scientific community have been talking about 
using SCNT technology to generate multiple 
human beings who are genetically identical to 
existing people — the popular conception of 
clones — not as some futuristic fantasy, but as 
a real, reachable reality. So far, though, claims 
of successfully cloning human babies have 
been either unproven (and widely discredited) 
or exposed as fake. Some groups have suc-
cessfully created human blastocysts using 
nuclear transfer methods, but no one has yet 
demonstrated reliable generation of human 
stem cells from such blastocysts.
In 2002, Clonaid (www.clonaid.com), an 
outfit founded by followers of the Raelian reli-
gious sect that believes that aliens created 
humans through cloning 25,000 years ago, 
announced the birth of a 7-pound girl named 
Eve who was allegedly the world’s first human 
baby created via SCNT. Initially, Clonaid offi-
cials said they would make the infant available 
to independent experts so they could confirm 
that Eve was in fact a clone. The promised 
independent access never happened, though, 
and Clonaid officials have never revealed Eve’s 
whereabouts or information about her parents. 
Clonaid still operates its Web site and claims to 
have created at least 13 babies via SCNT since 
2002. However, no one knows where Clonaid 
operates (its U.S., Korean, and Bahamian offices 
were shut down several years ago), no one has 
ever independently confirmed Clonaid’s claims, 
and, according to the Web site, “CLONAID is a 
project name. The company name under which 
we operate is different and is not revealed 
for obvious security reasons as to protect the 
safety of it’s (sic) employees and customers.” 
Today, most knowledgeable observers doubt 
that Clonaid even has access to SCNT technol-
ogy, much less that it’s successfully applied it.
In 2004, Dr. Hwang Woo-suk, a South Korean 
scientist, announced that he and his team 
had created human embryos using SCNT and 
induced them to grow long enough to produce 
stem cells. The research was published in the 
journal Science and hailed around the world 
as an important breakthrough in the field. But, 
within the next two years, Woo-suk’s research 
was exposed as fake. The journal Science 
retracted two papers it had published on Woo-
suk’s work; Woo-suk resigned from his univer-
sity post and was eventually charged with fraud 
and embezzlement. When South Korea decided 
to allow human SCNT research to continue, it 
specifically barred Woo-suk from working with 
human cells or tissues.
In 2001, biotech company Advanced Cell 
Technology announced that it had created 
human embryos via SCNT; however, the only 
embryo that survived the process stopped 
dividing at the six-cell stage. In 2008, California-
based Stemagen reported using SCNT to create 
human embryos, although the company hasn’t 
yet reported success in generating stem cells 
from such human embryos. The only other con-
firmed, published example of a human embryo 
created by SCNT was in 2005 at Great Britain’s 
Newcastle University. As in the ACT experi-
ment, the Newcastle University embryos didn’t 
survive long enough to generate stem cells — 
the ultimate goal of the process.

114
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
 
Most people consider using SCNT methods to create human embryos for 
reproductive purposes to be unethical or morally troubling. Scientists gener-
ally aren’t in favor of using SCNT techniques for human reproductive pur-
poses, either, especially because the technology is unreliable. Most of the 
animals born following SCNT have had abnormalities of some kind, ranging 
from premature aging to genetic defects. The success rate for live births from 
SCNT embryos remains stubbornly at between 2 percent and 3 percent for 
most mammals; spontaneous abortion rates and neonatal deaths are high. 
And early apparent health seems to be an unreliable indicator of whether 
SCNT animals will remain healthy as they age.
The dismal track record for reproductive cloning in animals leads virtually 
all people in the scientific and medical communities to condemn the idea of 
reproductive cloning in humans. Aside from the ethical considerations (dis-
cussed in detail in Chapter 15), the technology just isn’t safe for either the 
baby or the baby’s prospective mother.
Discovering Cybrids
Cybrids — sometimes called cytoplasmic hybrids — are cells whose nucleus is 
from one source and whose cytoplasm is from another source.
Technically, scientists have four techniques for making cybrids:
 
✓ Using nuclear transfer technology, in which the nucleus and egg cell are 
from different donors (often referred to as clones, but this technique 
really produces a cybrid)
 
✓ Fusing nonidentical cells to mix the cytoplasm of each cell and create a 
new cell with either one nucleus or two nuclei
 
✓ Transplanting cytoplasm from one woman’s egg cells into another wom-
an’s egg cells
 
✓ Combining the nucleus of a cell from one species with an egg cell from 
another species
The technology is particularly controversial when scientists use egg cells 
and adult cells from different donors or from different species. Scientists take 
a cell or nucleus from the cell of one animal — a mouse, say — and insert 
it into an enucleated egg cell from, say, a cow. The nucleus in this altered 
cell contains the mouse DNA, and the cytoplasm comes from the cow and 
contains small amounts of cow DNA. Because the cytoplasm of an egg cell 
contains only mitochondrial DNA (a handful of genes from the cow’s genetic 
library, passed down only through the mother), the resulting cells are 99.9 
percent mouse and 0.1 percent cow. Figure 7-5 shows how multispecies 
cybrids are created for research purposes.

115
 Chapter 7: Understanding Why Scientists Mix and Match Cells
 
Recently, new experimental fertilization treatments have created human 
cybrids (all the cells involved are human). In some cases where problems with 
a woman’s egg cells were thought to be causing her and her husband’s fertility 
problems, doctors treating the couple have tried a novel approach called cyto-
plasmic transfer. This process involves using egg cells from another woman 
whose donated egg cells have previously been used to start healthy pregnan-
cies. The doctors take a little bit of cytoplasm from these donor egg cells and 
inject it into the patient’s egg cells. The donor cytoplasm contains a variety of 
egg cell materials, including mitochondria (the energy- producing factories in 
all cells that contain small amounts of DNA). The doctors then fertilize the 
cybrid egg cells with sperm from the patient’s husband.

Although we don’t know yet how safe and effective this method is — simply 
because it hasn’t been done often enough to draw any reliable conclusions — 
this procedure has generated a number of children. Interestingly, the result-
ing embryos and babies may have traces of genetic material from the donor’s 
egg cell mitochondria, so they could be said to have three parents — a father 
and two mothers. However, because the nucleus contains the couple’s DNA, 
the resulting babies are mainly the children of the two parents (not the cyto-
plasmic donor), genetically speaking. Figure 7-6 shows how cybrid embryos 
are created for fertility treatments.

Scientists have been creating cybrids in the lab for almost 40 years by fusing 
cells of different animals and different species to study development, genet-
ics, and disease. They’ve also been fusing mouse and other animals’ cells 
with human cells for a very long time to study human cellular physiology and 
genetics. Until fairly recently, no one cared that researchers routinely mixed 
the contents of cells from different animals, or from animals and humans, in 
the lab. But in the context of stem cell research — and specifically human 
embryonic stem cell research — human-animal cybrids have become highly 
controversial.
In the following sections, we describe what scientists do with various kinds of 
cybrids and explain recent political developments regarding these creations.

117
 Chapter 7: Understanding Why Scientists Mix and Match Cells
Using cybrids to understand 
development and disease
Over the past four decades or so, researchers have fused cells from different 
animals in the lab to learn about many basic biological processes. For exam-
ple, scientists have used cybrid technology to expand their understanding 
of how cell division is controlled, how cancer cells work, and even the loca-
tions and functions of human genes. The technology already has contributed 
greatly to basic research and research on human biology and disease.
 
One of the persistent challenges in human embryonic stem cell research is 
generating a genetically robust variety of stem cells for study and possible 
eventual transplantation. Although fertility clinics have an estimated 400,000 
blastocysts in cold storage, most of those won’t be used for research. The 
ones that are donated for research won’t necessarily yield stem cell lines (see 
Chapter 4), and the lines those excess blastocysts do yield represent limited 
genetic diversity when compared with the human population as a whole. 
Cybrid technology provides one possible solution to this problem.
Harvesting a healthy woman’s egg cells is difficult and often painful and risky 
for the donor, so scientists aren’t sure that it’s a practical method to secure 
egg cells for research. Some scientists are turning to animal egg cells — includ-
ing rabbit and cow eggs — to provide the outer cellular structure for human 
genetic material. Animal eggs are far more plentiful and easier to obtain than 
human eggs, and, because the animal eggs are emptied of all but a tiny fraction 
of their DNA, concerns about spontaneous development of a half-human, half-
bull creature like the Minotaur of Greek mythology are virtually nonexistent in 
scientific circles. There simply isn’t enough animal DNA in a cybrid to generate 
such a thing.
Understanding the Uproar over 
Cell-Swapping Technology
The technique of combining animal egg cells and human tissue cells treads 
on some pretty tricky territory, at least from a political point of view. Many 
bioethicists don’t see any ethical problem with creating chimeras, clones, or 
cybrids because they’re used only for research; no one is aiming to create 
fully developed half-animal, half-human monsters, and, in fact, no one in sci-
entific circles thinks it’s possible to do that.

118
Part II: Delving into Stem Cell Science 
However, for some people, combining genetic material from animals and 
humans violates a natural boundary between species and devalues human-
ness. And some people look at these techniques from an animal-rights point 
of view, arguing that humans shouldn’t subject animals to this kind of genetic 
manipulation.
Several developments in stem cell and medical technology have fueled the 
controversy:
 
✓ Creating chimeric pigs that have human blood pumping through their 
bodies. Researchers at the Mayo Clinic implanted human blood stem 
cells in fetal pigs to find out whether viruses common in pigs can infect 
human cells. They found that some of the human and pig cells fused, 
creating a nucleus with both human and pig DNA, and that the pig cells 
passed a common virus onto the human cells. The research was part of 
an ongoing effort to find suitable substitutes for human-to-human organ 
and tissue transplants; pigs are considered likely candidates because 
many of their organs and tissues are similar to those in humans. In fact, 
surgeons have been using valves from pigs and cows in human heart 
operations for some time, a technique that generates little or no contro-
versy today.
 
✓ Creating mice chimeras with partially human brains. Scientists have 
routinely generated mice with brains that have human cells, as much as 
1 percent in some cases. Some scientists are interested in creating mice 
with 100-percent human brains by injecting human brain cells into the 
brains of fetal mice. Those mice would be aborted and dissected to see 
whether their brains mimicked human brain structure. If such an experi-
ment worked, researchers believe it would improve their understanding 
of how the human brain works — which in turn would be useful in study-
ing various neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Lou 
Gehrig’s.
 
✓ Using rabbit eggs and human tissue cells to grow stem cells. Chinese 
researchers were the first to report successfully harvesting stem cells 
from human-animal cybrids. They said the rabbit-human embryos grew 
for a few days in the lab, long enough to produce the inner cell mass 
that scientists use to grow stem cells. Other researchers haven’t yet 
reproduced these results, though.
 
Opponents of techniques that combine animal and human cells are generally 
worried about two things: creating animals with human consciousness, and 
creating animals with human DNA in their reproductive cells. Even though the 
odds are slim that scientists will ever create, say, a living mouse with a fully 
functional human brain, or mice that produce human egg and sperm cells, 
opponents worry that today’s technology could lead to such problematic 
results.

119
 Chapter 7: Understanding Why Scientists Mix and Match Cells
Drawing the line between what’s acceptable and what isn’t when it comes 
to mixing and matching animal and human cells is itself problematic. In the 
United States, Kansas Senator Sam Brownback introduced the Human-Animal 
Hybrid Prohibition Act of 2009, which would ban any attempts to create a 
human-animal hybrid. The definitions in the bill actually describe chimeras 
and cybrids rather than true hybrids — perhaps a result of the casual way 
these highly technical terms are often used in nonscientific circles. As writ-
ten, the proposed bill would make it illegal to combine human and animal 
cells in virtually any form of embryo. Critics of the legislation have accused 
the senator of “trying to ban mermaids.” Supporters say such a ban is neces-
sary to preserve human dignity and species integrity. The bill was referred to 
the Senate Judiciary Committee in the summer of 2009 and hadn’t been acted 
on as of this writing.
Lawmakers in the United Kingdom took a different approach to try to assuage 
opponents’ concerns about swapping cells among animals and humans. 
Although the British had banned the creation of embryos containing human 
and animal genetic information, the government decided to allow scientists 
to create cybrids for research purposes, as long as the cybrid embryos are 
destroyed within two weeks of their creation. The two-week limit is a nod to 
the Warnock Commission’s definition of when an embryo attains “person-
hood” (see Chapter 15); human embryos begin to develop the so-called primi-
tive streak, a thickening that eventually gives rise to the nervous system, 14 
days after conception. The new British law also prohibits implanting cybrid 
embryos in a womb.
 
Scientists typically harvest a blastocyst’s inner cell mass — the cells that are 
used to grow embryonic stem cells — when the blastocysts have developed 
for between three and five days.
The International Society for Science and Religion adopted a formal statement 
on cybrids and chimeras authored by Sir Brian Heap of Cambridge University 
and the Rev. Dr. Ronald Cole-Turner of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. 
The statement supports research, including the use of cybrids and chimeras, 
that promotes basic scientific knowledge of human development and disease 
and provides insights for developing potential therapies for disease.
The society’s statement also “encourages further public discussion and com-
plete openness about the status of research and the progress of regulatory 
procedures” and urges “that a prudent and respectful regard for the public 
concerns be maintained by researchers and policy-makers alike, in recogni-
tion of the long-term benefits to science that come from maintaining public 
support.”

dangerous and difficult to eradicate. We look at the concept that certain 
cancer cells have stem cell-like properties and show how those traits may 
explain why cancer is so difficult to treat effectively with current methods. 
And we show you how stem cell research, coupled with the concept of 
cancer stem cells, has the potential to help solve some of the persistent prob-
lems in the war on cancer.
Battling the Age-Old War on Cancer
Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine and creator of the Hippocratic Oath (often 
expressed as, “First, do no harm”), first used the Greek words carcinoma and 
carcinos to describe tumors. He thought cancer was caused by an excess of 
black bile — one of the four humors that he thought influenced health and sick-
ness. (The other humors were blood, phlegm, and yellow bile.)

Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
In the 18th century, doctors thought cancer was caused by fluid from the 
lymph nodes. In the early 19th century, scientists determined that cancer is 
made up of cells, but thought abnormal cells came from the material in the 
spaces between normal cells. Some theorized that cancer was caused by 
chronic irritation and that it spread like a liquid, similar to the way water 
spreads when it’s on a flat surface. Others thought trauma — such as being 
thrown from a horse — caused cancer, and, for a time, many thought cancer 
was contagious.
Historically, a diagnosis of cancer was a death sentence. Even today, with all 
the advances in science and medicine, many forms of cancer remain stub-
bornly difficult to treat, and some (too many) are still deadly despite the best 
treatments available. According to the National Cancer Institute, about 1.5 
million Americans will be diagnosed with some form of cancer this year, and 
500,000 Americans will die of some form of cancer this year.
The news isn’t all bad. The war on cancer has been, in general, slowly suc-
cessful; five-year survival rates (the number of cancer patients who live for at 
least five years after initial diagnosis) have hit the 75-percent mark or higher 
for many types of cancer.
Still, treating cancer has turned out to be far more difficult than anyone antic-
ipated. And, despite improvements in diagnostics, treatment, and cancer 
mortality rates, about four in every ten people will be diagnosed with some 
form of this disease at some point in their lives.
 
One of the challenges in defeating cancer is that it isn’t just one disease. 
Rather, it’s a collection of around 100 diseases that share certain character-
istics but diverge in important ways. This variety makes it more difficult to 
devise appropriate tools for diagnosing and treating individual cancer types.
Understanding What Cancer Is
At its simplest, cancer is a disease where normal cells become abnormal as 
a result of genetic changes. These genetic changes are sometimes inherited, 
but most often they occur as a result of environmental factors — exposure 
to carcinogenic (cancer-causing) chemicals, radiation, or certain types of 
viruses or bacteria.
Cancer cells differ from normal cells in important ways:
 
✓ They divide more often (and sometimes more quickly) than they should.
 
✓ They don’t die when they should.
 
✓ They spread to other parts of the body.

125
 Chapter 8: Looking into Cancer’s Cradle: Cancer Stem Cells
 
The fact that cancer spreads is what makes it so deadly. If tumors stayed in 
one place, almost all cancers (with the exception of some cancers of the brain, 
perhaps) would be relatively curable because you could just cut the tumors 
out. In fact, in the 19th century, surgeons believed that cancer migrated 
through tissues, not through the bloodstream or lymphatic system, so they 
typically removed a great deal of healthy tissue to make sure that they excised 
the entire tumor. For example, a surgical procedure called a radical mastec-
tomy (which is rarely done these days) for breast cancer involves removing 
the breast, the muscle tissues beneath the breast, and the lymph nodes in the 
armpit, even if those tissues appear to be healthy.
In the following sections, we explain how genetic changes lead to the forma-
tion of cancer cells and how the mechanisms controlling cell growth, death, 
and migration go awry.
Changing cells’ genetic instructions
Cells can undergo genetic changes through two main mechanisms — hered-
ity and environmental exposures. Scientists have identified inherited genetic 
changes that increase the risk of developing a number of different cancers, 
including breast, bone, colon, kidney, and skin cancer. Some people even 
choose to undergo testing to see whether they carry the genetic change asso-
ciated with a specific cancer. (See the nearby sidebar, “Genetic testing for 
cancer predisposition.”)
Genetic testing for cancer predisposition
Thanks to advances in genetics, you can now 
be tested to see whether you carry the genetic 
markers that indicate a predisposition to cer-
tain types of cancer. Women who inherit cer-
tain forms of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, 
for example, have a higher risk of developing 
breast and ovarian cancer, and some women 
who have a history of breast cancer in their 
families decide to be tested to see whether they 
have the problematic genes.
While genetic testing can provide peace of 
mind (or allow people to manage their increased 
risk by having screening tests, such as mam-
mograms, more frequently), the process isn’t 
without its downsides. For one thing, interpret-
ing genetic tests is difficult, so you may not get 
the black-and-white answers you’re looking for; 
some changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes 
are known to be associated with an increased 
risk of developing cancer, but the significance 
of other changes in those genes is unknown.
Insurability can become an issue, too. Health 
insurers have been known to drop coverage for 
people who have genetic markers for certain 
diseases, even though the markers imply only 
a higher risk of developing the disease — not 
an absolute certainty that the disease will arise.

126
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
Researchers believe only about 10 percent of cancer cases arise from inher-
ited genetic changes. The vast majority of genetic changes associated with the 
development of cancer are acquired through environmental exposures, such as 
smoking (cigarette smoke contains a number of harsh chemicals, including form-
aldehyde and hydrogen cyanide), chemicals, radiation, and even certain viruses.
Chemicals and radiation damage the genetic material in your body’s cells. 
Viruses add their own genes to cells, which can either damage or destroy 
your normal genes. In many cases, a single genetic change can have a cas-
cade effect, clearing the way for other alterations that turn a normal cell into 
a cancer cell.
 
Not all harmful changes occur inside the cell. Sometimes the cell’s environ-
ment changes, too. Most cells live in close contact with other cells and 
exchange information and even products with them. (See Chapters 2 and 5 for 
more on cells’ environments.) If the environment gets weird — if signals get 
garbled, for example — it can trigger changes in cell behavior. No one really 
understands the mechanics or whether the abnormal cell or the environment 
is the instigator of the changes. But researchers are looking into both internal 
cellular changes and changes in the cells’ environment to try to solve at least 
part of the cancer puzzle.
Losing control of growth
At its root, cancer is a problem of uncontrolled cell growth and division. Normal 
cells grow and divide in certain parts of your body throughout your lifetime to 
replenish dying or worn-out cells, but they do so according to an intricate set of 
genetic instructions that keep a tight rein on growth and division.
Many genes are involved in controlling growth and division. Generally, cells 
don’t divide until they have enough internal material to supply two cells, and 
they create that material only in response to signals that it’s time to grow. 
Stem cells, for example, pick up signals that the body needs more skin cells 
or more blood cells or what have you (depending on the tissue involved), 
and they begin growing so that they can divide. Sometimes they divide into 
two stem cells, or, if the body needs differentiated cells — such as skin or 
blood cells — one or both of the daughter cells will go off to fill that need.
Your body has several ways to keep cell growth and division under control. 
Tumor suppressor genes control growth by instructing cells to produce cer-
tain proteins that slow or stop growth. When cells grow too fast or too large, 
one special tumor suppressor gene calls for the cell to create a protein called 
p53 that triggers cell suicide (called apoptosis). The process is sort of like 
over-inflating a balloon: If you fill a balloon with too much air, it pops. When 
cells grow too fast because of genetic damage, tumor suppressor genes order 
the production of p53, which causes the cell to pop, or die. Because the cell 
itself makes the p53 protein, scientists refer to this process as cell suicide.

127
 Chapter 8: Looking into Cancer’s Cradle: Cancer Stem Cells
Other genes specialize in repairing damage to DNA. They go to work before 
a cell divides to fix any mistakes made when the DNA replicates itself. When 
genetic damage isn’t repaired correctly, genetic mistakes and mutations will 
be copied every time the original damaged cell and its offspring divide.
 
When the function of tumor suppressor or DNA repair genes is compromised, 
it’s like having bad brakes (or no brakes) when you’re cruising downhill in San 
Francisco. You may be lucky and make it to the bottom of the hill without hit-
ting anything, but chances are you’re going to have an accident.
In your body, if the brakes fail in cells that aren’t dividing, such as the top 
layer of your skin (which you regularly shed, cell by cell), it’s like having bad 
brakes in a parked car; there’s no risk of an accident. But if the brakes fail in 
dividing cells, such as stem cells or progenitor cells that create specific cell 
types — or if a cell that shouldn’t be growing and dividing suddenly starts 
doing both — then you’ve got a problem.
Cheating death
Normal cells typically have a defined lifespan, although that lifespan depends 
on the type of cell. Cells in your skin, hair, and the linings of your stomach 
and intestines, for example, die off (and are replenished) frequently because 
these cells are continually exposed to environmental factors, such as heat, 
light, and the components of food, drink, and medicine. Cells in some other 
tissues and organs are replenished less frequently, either because they’re 
exposed to fewer environmental factors that cause wear and tear or because 
replacing cells would disrupt the function of that tissue. For example, fre-
quent replacement of brain cells may disrupt learning and memory because 
your ability to learn and remember things is encoded in the structures, activi-
ties, and connections of the cells in your brain. Likewise, frequent replace-
ment of heart cells would disrupt the heart cells’ ability to beat together in 
the same rhythm; introduction of new heart cells would be like having two 
drummers in a band playing at different speeds.
 
Until recently, most scientists thought that heart cells didn’t replenish them-
selves at all; they thought the heart cells your body developed during the first 
two decades of life had to last until your death. In April 2009, collaborating 
researchers in California and Sweden reported that heart cells may indeed 
replenish themselves, albeit very slowly. According to their findings, a 25-year-
old’s heart replaces about 1 percent of its muscle cells in a 12-month period, 
and a 75-year-old’s heart replaces 0.5 percent of its muscle cells in a year. This 
rate of replacement may be slow enough to allow new cells to incorporate 
without disrupting rhythmic beating.
Assuming that your blood-forming system is healthy, you produce new red blood 
cells to replace worn-out ones about every 12 hours. Blood platelets — the blood 
cells responsible for clotting — are typically replenished every 10 to 12 days.

128
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
Sometimes cells don’t die or wear out when they’re supposed to. But if your 
body continues to produce new cells to replace the ones that are supposed 
to die, you may end up with too many cells, which can form tumors.
 
Tumors themselves aren’t always inherently life-threatening. Sometimes they 
can impinge on vital organs, like the brain, and have to be removed. But, in 
many cases, removal is fairly easy, and many tumors are benign, or noncancer-
ous. Benign tumors, which include moles and other growths, typically grow 
quite slowly if they grow at all, don’t invade surrounding tissues, and don’t 
spread to other parts of the body.
Breaking out of tissue jail
Cells that grow and divide when they’re not supposed to and don’t die on 
schedule become truly dangerous when they metastasize, or migrate to other 
areas of the body. Cancer cell migration is akin to escaping from a maximum-
security prison: The cells have to be able to leave the parent tumor, move 
over or around other cells, hitch a ride to a distant location, and then invade 
and set up a new colony in unfamiliar territory teeming with hostile forces.
Here’s how the journey goes in some cases:
 
1. The cell turns off adhesion molecules on its surface.
 
 These molecules normally make the cell stick to other cells.
 
2. The cell moves itself by stretching forward, grabbing hold of neigh-
boring cells and letting go of the cells behind it, sort of like the way 
an inchworm moves.
 
3. The cell keeps moving until it hits a basement membrane, a thick wall 
of proteins that surrounds tissues.
 
4. The cell secretes enzymes that eat through the basement membrane, 
creating an opening the cell can crawl through.
 
5. After it gets through the basement membrane, the cell looks for a way 
to ride to another location.
 
 Sometimes the cell squeezes between cells in blood vessel walls and 
enters the bloodstream. Sometimes the cell travels through ducts in 
lymph nodes. And sometimes it goes through the body wall, the muscles 
and connective tissues that surround the chest and abdominal cavities.
 
6. When the cancer cell reaches a likely new home, it hops off its trans-
port and attempts to establish a new colony.

129
 Chapter 8: Looking into Cancer’s Cradle: Cancer Stem Cells
 
The cancer cell’s original location seems to dictate how it travels; the blood-
stream is the most common mode of transportation. Cancers in bone and soft 
tissues most often travel through the circulatory system, while breast, lung, 
gastrointestinal, and some skin cancers travel mainly through the lymphatic 
system. Passage through the body wall seems to be uncommon; only ovarian 
cancers and mesothelioma — cancer that attacks the linings of the lungs, 
heart, and abdomen — appear to spread this way.
The hazards associated with this journey are many and varied. Simply 
detaching from neighboring cells can cause the cancer cell to die. Entering 
the circulatory system is like merging into a NASCAR race on a bicycle; in 
fact, cancer cells can sometimes attach themselves to platelets in the blood-
stream to protect them from colliding with other blood cells. Even so, they 
can get stuck in blood vessels or lymphatic ducts, because cancer cells can 
be much larger than normal cells. Healthy tissues are incredibly hostile to 
foreign invaders. And the agents of the body’s immune system are continu-
ally searching for and trying to attack the cancer cell every step of the way.
Given all these obstacles, how does cancer manage to be so prolific? It’s all in 
the numbers. The journey for any given cancer cell may be statistically likely to 
end prematurely, but 1 million or more cells can migrate from a tumor at any 
time. If only 1 percent of them successfully complete the journey, that means 
10,000 cancer cells are out there potentially able to form a new tumor. In some 
cases, a single cell may be capable of starting tumor growth at a new site.
 
Even if a cancer cell can’t establish a new colony in new tissues, it doesn’t nec-
essarily die — that’s one of the genetic changes characteristic of cancer cells. 
Instead, it lies dormant in its new location, waiting to pick up another genetic 
change that will enable it to start growing and dividing again. This ability to lie 
dormant without dying is why sometimes cancer patients appear to be cancer-
free, only to have tumors show up in other areas of their bodies months or 
years later.
Exploring the Idea of Cancer Stem Cells
Cancers are generally named for where they originated — lung cancer, 
kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, basal cell carcinoma from a type of skin 
cell, and so on. This convention has led some people to think that the term 
cancer stem cells means that cancer starts in stem cells. (The nearby side-
bar, “Cancer types,” lists the main categories of cancer.)
 
In some cases, the genetic changes that cause cancer may indeed originate 
in a stem cell, or in progenitor cells, which are more differentiated than stem 
cells and give rise to a more limited range of tissue cells. However, the term 
cancer stem cells actually refers to the properties of certain cancer cells, 
rather than their origin.

130
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
Most normal tissues (see Chapter 5 for exceptions) have populations of stem 
cells that divide slowly throughout a person’s life, replenishing themselves 
and, as needed, replenishing some of the body’s cells that die off or wear out, 
like skin and blood cells.
In some cancers, cells apparently acquire genetic changes that may cause 
some of them — but not all the cells in a tumor — to act like stem cells; that 
is, they can renew themselves, and they can give rise to all the different cells 
in the cancer. These genetic changes may happen in a variety of different cell 
types: a stem cell, a progenitor cell, and perhaps even a terminally differenti-
ated cell — a cell that, under normal circumstances, acquires a specific func-
tion and structure that it maintains until it dies. Figure 8-1 shows how genetic 
changes turn a blood-forming cell into a leukemia stem cell.

The essential idea underlying the cancer stem cell model is that some can-
cers act like normal tissues: Their growth is driven by a small subpopula-
tion of cells that have much more capacity to divide than other cells. Very 
likely, not all cancers follow this model. There may be many cancers in which 
nearly all of the cancer cells can grow indefinitely and contribute to the dis-
ease. However, cancers that are driven by cancer stem cells might be treated 
more effectively by searching for drugs that specifically kill the cancer stem 
cells, rather than using drugs designed to target all the cells in the cancer.
In chronic myeloid leukemia, or CML, for example, researchers think the first 
genetic change happens in the hematopoietic stem cell. That one change 

131
 Chapter 8: Looking into Cancer’s Cradle: Cancer Stem Cells
can give rise to a chronic, or ongoing, form of the leukemia, which can be 
controlled pretty well, but not cured, with a drug called Gleevec. Gleevec 
appears to kill the differentiated leukemia cells, but not the leukemic stem 
cells carrying the initial genetic change. The leukemic stem cells thus have 
time to acquire additional genetic changes that allow them to form differenti-
ated cells that are more aggressive — or resistant to Gleevec. When the leu-
kemic stem cells give rise to these “super” cancer cells, the disease goes into 
an acute phase called blast crisis. Gleevec no longer can control the leukemia, 
and that’s when people die.
Researchers think the next genetic change — the one that really drives the 
disease out of control — may not happen in the stem cell but in a progeni-
tor cell that, after the genetic change, starts to act like a leukemia stem cell. 
When the disease goes into the acute phase, Gleevec no longer controls it, 
and that’s when people die.
 
The concept of cancer stem cells is important because it provides a model of 
sorts for thinking about how many types of cancer may develop and, perhaps, 
how to treat certain kinds of cancer. We explore these ideas in detail in the fol-
lowing sections.
Cancer types
Cancers are generally named for where they 
originated because, in many cases, cancerous 
cells don’t lose all aspects of their original iden-
tities, even when they move into other tissues. 
So, for example, breast cancer that spreads 
to the lungs doesn’t become lung cancer; it’s 
metastasized breast cancer, and the cancer 
cells may still retain some properties of breast 
tissue. Doctors can usually figure out where the 
cancer originated by taking a sample of tumor 
cells and looking for specific markers on the 
cells’ surfaces to identify their point of origin. 
(This procedure is called a biopsy.)
In rare cases, doctors can’t determine where 
the cancer originated. Those cancers, which 
account for between 2 and 4 percent of all 
cancer cases, are called cancers of unknown 
primary, or CUP.
Cancer can occur in any part of the body. The 
main types of cancer are
 ✓ Brain and spinal cord cancers, which typi-
cally start around neurons in the central 
nervous system. Because much of the 
central nervous system is enclosed in hard 
bone-and-cartilage structures, even non-
cancerous tumors can cause problems by 
creating pressure on sensitive nerve tissue.
 ✓ Carcinomas, which begin in skin or other 
epithelial tissues (the layer that lines all 
the body’s organs, including mucous 
membranes in the mouth, lungs, and other 
organs).
 ✓ Leukemias, which start in the bone marrow 
and blood-forming tissues.
 ✓ Lymphomas and myelomas, which start in 
the immune system.
 ✓ Sarcomas, which start in bone, muscle, and 
connective tissues like tendons.

132

Figuring out differences in cancer cells
In the 1980s and ’90s, Canadian cancer researcher John Dick began investi-
gating whether all cancer cells are the same. He focused on a specific type 
of leukemia called acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, in which abnormal white 
blood cells collect in the bone marrow and inhibit the production of normal 
blood cells. In humans, most AML cells resemble specialized blood cells that 
have minimal capacity to divide, raising the possibility that the disease prolif-
erates from a small population of cells with stem cell-like properties.
Dick and his research team tested this theory by transplanting human AML 
cell into mice whose immune systems were compromised (thus allowing 
the human cells to escape destruction by the mouse’s immune system) and 
found that less than one-tenth of 1 percent (0.1 percent) of AML cells were 
capable of transferring AML to the mice. In an important follow-up, Dick went 
on to show that rare AML cells with properties similar to normal blood-form-
ing stem cells were far more likely to be able to transfer the disease than AML 
cells that resembled specialized blood cells. Today, the AML cells capable of 
transferring disease are described as leukemic stem cells.
 
The confirmation that only a few AML cells are capable of starting and main-
taining the disease has critical implications for treatment because you can 
kill literally millions of AML cells with chemotherapy and radiation without 
necessarily harming the cells that actually generate the disease. As one cancer 
specialist puts it, you can kill all the worker ants in an anthill, but if you don’t 
kill the queen, the colony will come back.
In 2003, Stanford University researcher Michael Clarke applied the cancer 
stem cell hypothesis to breast cancer and found that, as in AML, only a few 
breast cancer cells are capable of initiating the disease in mice. Most breast 
cancer cells just sort of hang around, not doing much of anything — except 
getting in the way of normal tissues, sucking up nutrients, and waiting.
But just because breast cancer and some forms of leukemia have small popu-
lations of cancer stem cells doesn’t mean that’s true for all forms of cancer. 
Remember, cancer is really a collection of about 100 different diseases, and 
each form of cancer has its own properties and behaviors. It may be impossi-
ble to come up with a so-called “theory of everything” that explains all cancers.
In fact, researchers have shown that the concept of rare cancer stem cells 
may be useful only in some cases. In 2008, Sean Morrison and his research 
team at the University of Michigan showed that, when a mouse’s immune 
system is severely compromised, as many as one in four skin cancer (mela-
noma) cells is capable of starting the disease in the mouse’s body. And those 
cancer-initiating cells weren’t all the same; they looked different from each 
other and had different structures, or morphology. So far from being the pro-
verbial needle in a haystack, Morrison’s team showed that, at least under 
certain circumstances, the ability to proliferate with lethal efficiency is a 
common property of cells in some cancers.

133
 Chapter 8: Looking into Cancer’s Cradle: Cancer Stem Cells
Discovering similarities in normal 
and cancerous stem cells
In some ways, cancer cells and normal cells are similar. The human body 
has about 200 different kinds of cells, and all these cell types have different 
shapes, different structures, and different functions. Cancer cells also can 
have different shapes, structures, and functions.
Most important, though, may be functional similarities between normal stem 
cells and cancer stem cells. Many scientists think that normal stem cells have 
a number of formidable defense mechanisms to protect them from genetic 
damage. They tend to resist harmful chemicals, for example, and when such 
chemicals breach the stem cell membrane, proteins in the cell’s plasma mem-
brane form a sort of bucket brigade to pump the chemical out.
Stem cells also have an abundance of enzymes that conduct search-and-
destroy missions against molecules called reactive oxygen species, or ROS. ROS 
is a natural byproduct of cell metabolism, but when there’s too much ROS — 
through exposure to certain chemicals or radiation, for example — these tiny 
molecules can seriously disrupt DNA, leading to disruptions in tissue function 
and regeneration that may resemble premature aging. (Antioxidants like vita-
min C and vitamin E also help cells fight off ROS.)
 
The traditional treatments for cancer are surgery to remove as many cancer 
cells as possible, and chemotherapy and radiation to zap any cancer cells that 
remain in the body. But if cancer stem cells have the same kinds of defenses 
that normal stem cells do, they may be able to pump out the chemicals 
designed to kill them and send out enzymes to get rid of the ROS generated by 
radiation treatments.
As it turns out, that may be exactly what happens in cancer stem cells — or 
at least some kinds of them. Some researchers have discovered evidence that 
the cancer stem cells in some cancers, including breast cancer, repair DNA 
damage more readily after radiation treatment than other types of cancer 
cells do. Researchers have recorded similar results in tests on human head 
and neck cancers, too.
 
These stem cell defense mechanisms may explain why traditional cancer ther-
apies can knock down cancer but often can’t knock it out. The therapies that 
are most effective at killing nonstem cancer cells apparently deal only glancing 
blows — if that — to cancer stem cells. It’s like the archetypal alien invasion 
movie, where mankind’s most powerful weapons can’t penetrate the mother 
ship’s force field.

134
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
Connecting Cancer, Stem Cells, 
and Possible Therapies
The traditional way of tackling cancer (after surgery, and sometimes in lieu of 
surgery) has been to kill every abnormal cell in sight that’s dividing — while 
trying not to kill every normal cell in the patient that’s dividing. It’s not an easy 
trick to pull off, because the methods that are lethal to most cancer cells are 
also, unfortunately, lethal to nearly all normal cells. And, just as bacteria can 
become resistant to antibiotics if the drugs are administered too frequently, 
cancer cells can become resistant to chemotherapy and radiation — so you 
have to give higher and higher doses to get the same effect. In the meantime, 
the therapy can do enough damage to normal cells to seriously sicken (or even 
kill) the patient.
Researchers have been investigating other approaches, including methods 
of cutting off the blood supply to tumors. As a tumor grows, the cells in the 
center of the tumor become further removed from the tissue’s blood supply, 
so the tumor establishes its own blood vessels to feed the cells in the center 
of the mass. The theory is that if you can starve the tumors of the nutrients 
they get from the blood supply, they’ll eventually die off on their own — per-
haps without the need for harsh chemicals or radiation.
Putting this starvation theory into practice raises some challenges. First, any 
drug that cuts off the tumor’s blood supply has to be carefully used so that 
it doesn’t wipe out the blood supply to too many normal tissues. Second, if 
cancer stem cells can lie dormant for months or years in tissues without their 
own blood supply (instead feeding off the tissue’s blood supply), these drugs 
won’t affect them until they begin to grow and form tumors with their own 
blood supply. And even then, who knows whether these cells can revert to a 
dormant state when their environment becomes too hostile?
Researchers are also investigating whether they can target specific cell path-
ways — such as the pathway involving antioxidant enzymes or pathways con-
trolling cell growth or death — to infiltrate cancer stem cells and kill them. 
Different pathways may be activated in different kinds of cancers, and normal 
cells may rely heavily on the same pathways, so this possibility requires a 
great deal more study of both normal and cancer cells.
 
Cancer is only one area where research into both normal and abnormal cell 
structure and behavior has to proceed in tandem. Scientists need to learn as 
much as they can about how normal cells develop and function in order to 
determine exactly what’s different in cancer cells and figure out ways to stop 
cancer from progressing.

135
 Chapter 8: Looking into Cancer’s Cradle: Cancer Stem Cells
Researchers can use many of the same methods that they use for studying 
normal stem cells to study cancer stem cells. For example, they can take 
normal stem cells in a tissue or pluripotent stem cells (from blastocysts) 
and generate the genetic changes in those cells that scientists think lead to 
creation of cancer stem cells. Then they can put those altered cells into mice 
with specific genetic changes that allow researchers to detect cancer cells; 
then the researchers can see whether the genetic changes they’ve made in 
the stem cells actually generated cancer stem cells. Some researchers also 
are interested in using nuclear transfer techniques (see Chapter 6) to transfer 
the nucleus of a cancer stem cell into an egg cell to try to generate cancer 
stem cells from scratch. These methods give scientists new ways to test 
whether their ideas about the genesis and development of certain cancers 
are correct.
If scientists can create large quantities of cancer stem cells in the lab, they 
also can test potential cancer drugs, analyze the genetic pathways of these 
abnormal cells, and potentially figure out how to kill them (without killing the 
patient).
Stem cell biology methods also give researchers new tools to push forward 
in studying cancer. Equipment like flow cytometers that can count different 
types of cells and testing methods like creating mouse models of human 
diseases can help scientists find cancer stem cells in a human so that they 
can extract them, purify them, and study them to identify their strengths and 
weaknesses.
The concept of cancer stem cells is therefore useful both as a way of target-
ing and developing therapy and as a way of focusing on the cells at fault and 
studying them in detail to figure out what makes them different.
The road ahead in cancer treatments and cures is still a long and winding 
one, but advances in stem cell research over the past 15 years or so offer the 
best promise so far of finally figuring out what goes on in this collection of 
100 or so diseases — and, most important, how to stop it.

iseases that attack the central nervous system — the brain and spinal cord 
— are among the most devastating and emotionally wrenching of human 
ailments because they often result in mental infirmity as well as physical dis-
ability. You don’t just lose your ability to control your movements; you may also 
lose your “self,” the immeasurable elements of personality and intellectual acuity 
that define you. The families of people with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other 
similar diseases often report feelings of loss and grief that begin long before their 
loved one succumbs to the disease (or its complications).
In this chapter, we examine a number of common and not-so-common neu-
rodegenerative diseases, ranging from Alzheimer’s to stroke. We show you 
what scientists have learned about what goes wrong in each of these dis-
eases, explain the abilities and limitations of current treatments, and discuss 
how research on stem cells may lead to long-sought breakthroughs.
Understanding Neurodegenerative 
Diseases
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Lou Gehrig’s, and a number of other disorders are 
called neurodegenerative diseases. Neuro refers to the brain or central ner-
vous system, and degenerative means the disorder results in deterioration of 
at least some portion of the central nervous system. Unfortunately, some of 
these diseases are quite common. Even more unfortunate, they’re extremely 

138

difficult, if not impossible, to treat with today’s medical arsenal — in large 
part because scientists’ understanding of how the human central nervous 
system works is far from complete.
Although neurodegenerative diseases seem to affect different regions of the 
brain or spinal cord, they share several common features:
 
✓ Neurons lose their connections with surrounding nerve cells.
 
✓ Those lost connections mean the electrical signals that tell cells to carry 
out movement or thought can’t be transmitted properly.
 
✓ Eventually, neurons die.
Researchers encounter two main hurdles in trying to figure out exactly what 
goes wrong in neurodegenerative diseases: The human nervous system is 
extremely complex, and studying living nerve cells in their natural habitat, 
so to speak, is both logistically and ethically difficult. Technologies like 
functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, have provided unparalleled 
insight into brain activity, but you can’t open up a person’s skull and stick 
probes into her brain — or remove a bunch of brain cells — just to see what 
happens. Research on cadavers lets scientists investigate the structure of 
the brain and nervous system, but doesn’t provide much insight into how the 
system works in a living body; it’s like trying to infer how a car engine works 
without ever being able to turn it on.
 
Stem cells hold the potential for boosting understanding of the brain and ner-
vous system over these hurdles. Scientists can grow different kinds of nerve 
cells from stem cells and use them to learn more about their function, as well 
as the causes, progression, and possible treatments of various neurodegenera-
tive diseases.
Attacking Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer’s may be the most common form of dementia (although a diag-
nosis of Alzheimer’s can’t be confirmed until after death). Health experts 
estimate that this disease strikes 10 percent of all people over age 65 and as 
many as 50 percent of people over age 85. As people live longer and the Baby 
Boom generation reaches retirement age, Alzheimer’s may become even 
more prevalent. Ronald Reagan suffered from Alzheimer’s, as did Arizona 
senator and 1964 presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. Film director Otto 
Preminger and actress Rita Hayworth also had Alzheimer’s.
This particular form of dementia starts with the loss of synapses — the 
intersections at which neurons transmit signals to target cells, which may 
be other brain cells, motor neurons, and so on. In Alzheimer’s, synapses in 

139
 Chapter 9: Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases
regions of the brain involved in memory, learning, and problem-solving are 
the first to go. In its early stages, people often assume memory lapses are 
due to normal aging. But Alzheimer’s is progressive; it spreads throughout 
the brain, and, although it starts with the loss of connections between cells, 
eventually the cells themselves start to die, first in the memory-learning-
problem-solving regions of the brain and ultimately throughout the brain.
As the disease advances, patients typically exhibit changes in behavior and 
personality; they have trouble making decisions and may lose vocabulary 
and other language skills. In moderate to severe Alzheimer’s, patients lose 
the ability to recognize family and friends and are typically confused about 
time and place. As the disease progresses, more and more brain cells die — 
and, eventually, the patient dies.
Scientists have yet to find a way to stop or even slow down the progression 
of Alzheimer’s. The only drugs available — such as Aricept and Exelon — 
help ease the symptoms of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s, but they don’t 
change the course of the disease. One drug, Namenda, is prescribed to help 
patients with more severe symptoms, but, again, it doesn’t slow down the 
disease.
Figuring out what happens in Alzheimer’s
By studying the brains of people who have died of Alzheimer’s or complica-
tions, researchers have identified three main hallmarks of the disease:
 
✓ Amyloid plaques: These deposits appear in the spaces between nerve 
cells in the brain and are composed of pieces of a variety of proteins, 
neurons, and other nerve cells.
 
✓ Neurofibrillary tangles: NFTs are made up of clumps of a protein called 
tau. In normal neurons, tau helps keep them healthy. But when tau 
clumps together, it interferes with neuron function and may lead to 
neuron death.
 
✓ Shrinking of brain tissue: When neurons die, the affected regions of the 
brain atrophy, or shrink. In advanced Alzheimer’s, damage has spread 
throughout the brain, and there’s significant shrinkage of brain tissue.
 
Amyloid plaques and NFTs can’t be detected unless the brain tissue can be 
analyzed. That’s why an Alzheimer’s diagnosis can’t be confirmed until after 
death. Although researchers agree that these elements signify Alzheimer’s, 
rather than another form of dementia, there’s very little agreement about what 
causes these hallmarks to appear, which (if any) are responsible for generat-
ing the disease, or how to go about treating it.

140
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
Part of the problem in tracking down first causes is that researchers 
don’t have as many tools as they need to unravel what causes and drives 
Alzheimer’s disease. Cognitive tests to measure memory and reasoning abili-
ties help with diagnosis but don’t answer questions about how the disease 
starts or why it progresses so fatally. Imaging technology is continually 
improving, allowing scientists to peer deep into the brain to try to see what’s 
happening at various stages of the disease, but, again, the whys and hows 
remain elusive.
 
A relatively new concoction known as Pittsburgh compound B, combined with 
specialized imaging technology, allows researchers and physicians to see 
amyloid deposits in the brains of living people. The Pittsburgh compound 
works like a dye so that amyloid plaques are detectable with certain imaging 
equipment. This imaging technique is particularly important in measuring the 
effectiveness of treatments that are now in clinical trials. (See the next section 
in this chapter.)
You can examine the brains of people who have died from the disease or 
complications, but by then the system is pretty well ravaged; the disease 
has progressed for a long time, and, in many cases, the very structure of the 
brain has fallen into ruin, so figuring out what happened early on is difficult. 
It’s like trying to determine what caused a plane to crash when all you have 
to work with is the wreckage. If you can’t find the so-called black box, which 
provides a record of everything that happened in the cockpit before some-
thing went wrong, piecing together what really happened is quite a challenge.
 
Scientists are looking for the black box in Alzheimer’s — and many other dis-
eases, for that matter — but for the time being, they’re often limited to trying 
to figure out where the problem begins by studying the wreckage the disease 
leaves in death. Stem cell research may help to answer these questions.
Still, the challenges aren’t holding back research. Several groups are conduct-
ing clinical trials to test treatments based on different theories of the main 
culprit in Alzheimer’s. And scientists are studying rare genetic forms of the 
disease to see whether they can develop a model for the more common, nonge-
netic forms. The following sections look at these approaches in more detail.
Testing cause-and-effect 
theories in clinical trials
Considering how many people Alzheimer’s affects (and its expected growth 
in incidence), the number of clinical trials for potential treatments is disap-
pointingly small. Most trials under way now focus on three main types of 

141
 Chapter 9: Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases
approaches. The first type of approach is based on the idea that the amyloid 
plaques (see the preceding section), or the pieces that make up the plaques 
cause all the subsequent damage in Alzheimer’s, so if you can remove the 
plaques, you can stop the disease from progressing. Some trials are testing a 
type of vaccination strategy to dissolve the plaques; other trials are targeting 
the pathways that lead to plaque formation.
In their early stages, these trials have had mixed results. Some researchers 
think these strategies show promise. But others are skeptical, in part because 
it’s not at all clear that the plaques are the main culprit in the disease’s 
progression.
A second type of approach is based on ideas about systemic factors that may 
cause or feed Alzheimer’s. Some evidence, for example, suggests that cho-
lesterol may be a contributing factor to the disease’s development, so some 
trials aim to reduce the incidence or progression of Alzheimer’s by control-
ling cholesterol levels with drugs called statins. (Lipitor and Crestor are two 
name-brand statin drugs). And some researchers are conducting trials that 
target other nutrients or vitamins that those researchers think may be impor-
tant, although there’s little hard evidence to rely on.
The third major approach being tested in trials now is to try to alleviate 
symptoms by stimulating affected parts of the brain. This tactic doesn’t 
change the course of Alzheimer’s, but it may provide some symptomatic 
relief for some patients.
Exploring genetic causes of Alzheimer’s
In nearly ten out of ten cases, Alzheimer’s is a sporadic disease, meaning 
researchers and physicians don’t know what causes it. But in perhaps one 
case in 100, Alzheimer’s has a clear-cut genetic origin. Researchers know 
of mutations in three genes that can cause a particularly virulent form of 
Alzheimer’s, known as early onset Alzheimer’s, that strikes people in their 30s, 
40s, and 50s.
While these genetic mutations are rare, scientists can use them to identify 
genetic pathways and functions in normal cells that keep people from developing 
hereditary forms of the disease or that make them susceptible to it. Of course, 
researchers can’t do these sorts of investigations in living people, so they make 
genetically manipulated mice (see Chapter 7) to conduct their studies.

142
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
 
Although mouse models (mice that develop some or all of the symptoms of 
human disease) often can be quite useful in figuring out what goes wrong and 
how a disease progresses, that isn’t the case with Alzheimer’s. For reasons 
that scientists don’t really understand, mice don’t develop true Alzheimer’s. 
Their neurons don’t die the way human neurons do, and the disease doesn’t 
produce the significant behavioral changes in mice that it produces in 
humans. So, while mouse models of Alzheimer’s are somewhat useful in seeing 
how the disease operates in its early stages, they haven’t inspired any break-
through treatments — at least not yet.
Bringing stem cells into 
Alzheimer’s research
Because the mouse models of Alzheimer’s don’t truly duplicate the disease 
(see preceding section), researchers have tried making the genetic changes 
that cause early-onset Alzheimer’s in a variety of cells grown in the lab. This 
technique has been helpful in letting scientists understand how these genes 
work normally and what happens when they carry the mutations that cause 
Alzheimer’s. However, until recently, scientists weren’t able to make and study 
these genetic changes in human neurons because, before the advent of human 
embryonic stem cells and technologies for reprogramming other cells, making 
human neurons in the lab was, for all practical purposes, impossible.
Scientists can use human stem cells — either embryonic stem cells or 
induced pluripotent stem cells from tissues (see Chapter 6) — or neuronal 
stem cells from fetal tissue to grow human neurons that have the genetic 
mutations that lead to Alzheimer’s. Then they can study what’s different 
about those neurons and perhaps come up with drugs that repair the damage 
or keep the damage from spreading.
 
Similarly, scientists can take other types of cells — say, from the skin — from 
people with sporadic Alzheimer’s, reprogram them to become pluripotent 
stem cells, and grow neurons from them. (Larry’s lab at the University of 
California–San Diego is using this technique.) Then they can compare the 
behavior of human neurons with the genetic architecture of hereditary 
Alzheimer’s, sporadic Alzheimer’s, and normal neurons to see where the 
similarities and differences lie. This comparison may help researchers deter-
mine why some people are less susceptible to Alzheimer’s than others, as 
well as identify the triggers and mechanisms of the disease — which may, 
in turn, lead to new therapies for treating Alzheimer’s. (Scientists are using 
similar approaches to study other diseases, too, such as Lou Gehrig’s and 
Parkinson’s.)

143
 Chapter 9: Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases
Scientists also are trying to find ways to use the brain’s own stem cells to 
replace damaged cells in Alzheimer’s and other diseases. (See the nearby 
sidebar, “Using the brain’s stem cells,” for more details.)
Of course, growing neurons isn’t the only thing you can do with stem cells. 
You can also
 
✓ Use them in cell transplant experiments. Several labs are experi-
menting with transplanting healthy cells into animals to see whether 
they replace or rescue damaged or defective cells in mouse models of 
Alzheimer’s.
 
✓ Use them to deliver material to specific regions of the brain. In 
Alzheimer’s patients, their brains may have enough of certain material, 
such as growth factors, but the material doesn’t get to the regions of the 
brain that need it. Scientists are exploring ways of using stem cells and 
other methods to deliver these potentially important materials to the 
appropriate parts of the brain. (Figure 9-1 shows how scientists envision 
packaging and delivering these kinds of therapies.)
 
✓ Use them to develop potential drug therapies. Scientists can test 
drug therapies on cells with hereditary or sporadic Alzheimer’s to see 
whether the therapies make the cells behave more normally.
Unfortunately, the idea of manipulating the brain’s own stem cells to solve 
problems outside their normal purview is easy to draw on a blackboard, but 
not so easy to put into practice. But it’s an exciting possibility with implica-
tions for all kinds of neurodegenerative diseases, so the scientific community 
is eagerly pursuing it.
Using the brain’s stem cells
For decades, researchers thought brains in 
humans and other mammals were devoid of 
stem cells. But the human brain (and animal 
brains, for that matter) does contain two small 
populations of stem cells. One cache supports 
the olfactory system (the tissues and organs 
involved in sensing smell), and the other is in a 
region of the brain that’s involved in processing 
information and forming new memories.
Many researchers are trying to figure out 
whether these indigenous brain stem cells can 
be induced to provide rescue activity to regions 
that are damaged in Alzheimer’s and other 
neurodegenerative diseases. For example, per-
haps these stem cells could be programmed 
to spawn new neurons to replace damaged or 
dead ones.

Treating Lou Gehrig’s Disease (ALS)
On July 4, 1939, Lou Gehrig — the “Pride of the Yankees” — bid an emo-
tional farewell to the game he loved, telling more than 60,000 fans at Yankee 
Stadium that he was “the luckiest man on the face of this earth.” Gehrig’s 
career didn’t end because of age; he had to retire because of a progressive 
and fatal neuromuscular disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also 
known as ALS or, especially in the United States and Canada, Lou Gehrig’s 
disease.
Until his forced retirement, Gehrig was a formidable ballplayer. His lifetime 
batting average was .340; his lifetime on-base percentage was .447; and his 
lifetime slugging percentage (total number of bases divided by total number 
of at-bats) was .632. He played in 2,130 consecutive games — a record that 
stood until 1995, when Baltimore’s Cal Ripken, Jr. surpassed it. Gehrig’s 
23 career grand slams still stood as a Major League record as of the 2009 
season.
But in late 1938, at age 35, Gehrig lost much of his power and prowess as a 
ballplayer. In spring training in 1939, he failed to hit a single home run and 
even collapsed at the Yankees’ spring training ballpark in Florida. A golf-
ing buddy noticed that Gehrig didn’t wear cleats, instead donning flat-soled 
shoes and shuffling his feet along the course. Finally, he had trouble making 
a routine play at first base in an April game, and a few days later took himself 
out of the Yankees lineup for the first time in 17 seasons. Later that year, he 
was diagnosed with ALS, and he died two years later.
Gehrig’s experience is quite typical of ALS. It starts with muscle weakness, 
which patients may attribute to fatigue or age. Unfortunately, because it’s 
painless, patients often don’t get diagnosed until the disease is fairly well 
advanced (not that early diagnosis would make a difference — at least not 
yet). As of today, there is no effective therapy for ALS, although some drugs 
can improve quality of life for some patients. As many as one in ten ALS 
patients may survive for ten or more years after diagnosis, but the average 
lifespan is three to five years.
ALS typically strikes people between age 40 and 60, but younger and older 
people can be afflicted. In the United States, an estimated 20,000 people have 
ALS, and about 5,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Besides Gehrig, 
other famous people with ALS include Morrie Schwartz (the title character in 
the nonfiction bestseller Tuesdays with Morrie), physicist Stephen Hawking, 
Chinese leader Mao Tse-Tung, and actors David Niven and Lane Smith.
 
ALS is effectively untreatable. Occasionally, the disease’s progression stops spon-
taneously, for reasons that nobody understands. (Stephen Hawking may — or 
may not — be one of those rare cases.) But in most cases, ALS is incurable 
and fatal.

146
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
Understanding why ALS 
is so difficult to treat
While it’s nearly impossible to treat successfully, ALS is a pretty simple 
disease to describe. It attacks the body’s motor neurons — the nerve cells 
responsible for receiving signals from the central nervous system and send-
ing them on to the muscles. Motor neurons are in charge of voluntary muscle 
movement, such as moving your arms, legs, torso, and neck. Motor neurons 
also control functions like breathing and swallowing.
In ALS, motor neurons begin dying — and they keep dying. Patients gradually 
become paralyzed. Chewing and swallowing become difficult. Some patients 
go on respirators and feeding tubes; others choose not to have these life-
prolonging measures. Many patients die of complications, such as pneumonia.
Nearly all treatments for ALS are aimed at easing symptoms. These treat-
ments include
 
✓ Drugs that target specific symptoms: Doctors often prescribe medica-
tions to help ALS patients feel less tired, reduce cramps and muscle 
spasms, assist sleep, and alleviate pain or symptoms of depression and 
anxiety.
 
✓ Physical therapy: Exercises to keep muscles loose can help ease spasms 
and aid the patient in strengthening unaffected muscles.
 
✓ Speech therapy: ALS patients often have trouble speaking clearly, espe-
cially as the disease progresses. Speech therapy can teach patients tech-
niques for strengthening their voices and alternative communication 
strategies when speaking becomes too difficult.
 
✓ Nutrition counseling: Because swallowing is often affected, ALS patients 
are challenged to get enough calories and nutrients. Nutrition counsel-
ing identifies easy-to-swallow foods and prepares meal plans to help ALS 
patients get the right foods in the right amounts.
 
At present, only one drug specifically targets the progression of ALS rather than 
its symptoms. Riluzole, sold under the brand name Rilutek, is an FDA-approved 
drug that reduces motor neuron damage by controlling the release of glutamate, 
a chemical that helps transmit signals between nerve cells. In clinical trials, 
some patients taking Rilutek survived several months longer than patients in 
the control group. The drug doesn’t reverse damage and doesn’t completely 
halt the progression of ALS. And, like all medications, it can have unpleasant 
and even dangerous side effects. However, it’s the only drug that’s been shown 
to slow down the progression of this debilitating disease.

147
 Chapter 9: Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases
Using stem cells to find new drugs 
and save motor neurons
As with Alzheimer’s disease (see “Attacking Alzheimer’s Disease,” earlier in 
this chapter), most ALS is sporadic; no one knows for sure what causes it. 
There are rare genetic versions of the disease, but, for the most part, ALS 
patients have no family history of it, and having a family member with sporadic 
ALS doesn’t seem to increase your risk of getting it. Most theories about the 
causes of sporadic ALS center on environmental toxins, autoimmune issues, 
infections, dietary factors, and even trauma, but none of these theories is 
proven. In fact, no theory, as yet, even has strong evidence to support it.
Scientists have made models of ALS in mice, rats, and fruit flies, giving these 
animals some or all the symptoms of the disease and then studying what hap-
pens. In one genetic form of ALS, for example, patients have a defect in the 
gene that encodes a protein called superoxide dismutase 1, or SOD1. Mice and 
rats with the SOD1genetic mutation develop a condition that looks very much 
like ALS, giving scientists a practical way to study both the mechanisms that 
cause motor neurons to die in this genetic environment and to test drugs that 
may slow or stop the destruction of motor neurons. In fact, drug and gene ther-
apy trials, developed from studying mice with the SOD1 mutation, are under 
way (although few of the trials have reported encouraging results so far).
Looking into the role other cells may play
 
Some labs (including Larry’s lab at the University of California–San Diego) 
have created chimeric mice (see Chapter 7) in which some of their cells carry 
the SOD1 genetic defect and some of their cells are normal to figure out how 
the genetic mutation is at fault and what role cells surrounding the motor neu-
rons may play. These surrounding cells, called astrocytes and microglia, are an 
important part of the central nervous system, even though they don’t transmit 
signals like neurons do. Instead, they support neuronal function.
Scientists combine normal and SOD1-mutant cells in mice to try to figure out 
what actually kills the neurons. Is something inside the mutant motor neurons 
causing them to die no matter what? Does the combination of two types of 
mutant cells cause the motor neuron’s death? Or can a mutant non-neuronal 
cell kill the motor neuron, regardless of whether the motor neuron carries 
the SOD1 mutation? The answer that’s emerging from these experiments in 
chimeric mice is that when astrocytes and microglia carry SOD1 defects, they 
seem to play key roles in killing motor neurons.
In recent and relatively preliminary experiments, scientists have generated 
cells that will give rise to new astrocytes from normal, nondiseased stem 
cells (both embryonic and fetal) and transplanted them into mice (or rats) 
with SOD1 motor neurons. The new astrocytes seemed to keep motor neu-
rons in the transplant region from getting sick and dying, at least for a while, 
even though those motor neurons carried the SOD1 mutation.

148
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
Seeing that normal cells in a mutant motor neuron’s neighborhood can 
improve the mutant motor neuron’s fate is good news for scientists trying 
to develop therapies for ALS. Why? Because growing and transplanting a 
motor neuron is extremely difficult; logistically, it’s a tough wiring project 
(see Chapter 2). But astrocytes and microglia are relatively easy to grow and 
transplant.
 
As with most transplants, rejection of the transplanted cells or tissues is a 
concern. Scientists routinely suppress animals’ immune systems when they 
conduct these kinds of experiments, and any human treatments that come 
from this work likely would involve suppressing human patients’ immune sys-
tems, too, at least initially.
If the findings in mice and rats turn out to be applicable in humans (and, of 
course, scientists hope they do), you may be able to replace the astrocytes 
and microglia that surround the motor neurons and rescue the neurons that 
are dying. Such transplants may keep the disease from progressing. If you 
can keep ALS patients from losing their breathing and swallowing abilities, 
for example, that would be an enormous step forward in treating the disease. 
Several research groups are aggressively pursuing this line of experimenta-
tion, trying to collect enough animal data to support applications for clinical 
trials in humans.
Looking for differences in genetic and nongenetic ALS
Stem cell technology may be useful for studying sporadic ALS, too. As with 
other neurological diseases, researchers are taking, say, skin cells from 
people who develop sporadic (that is, nonhereditary) ALS and reprogram-
ming them to become pluripotent stem cells. Then they can grow these stem 
cell lines, use them to generate motor neurons and astrocytes, and study 
them to see whether there’s a certain genetic architecture — perhaps a com-
bination of genetic variants — that makes people more susceptible to the 
disease. They can also grow astrocytes, microglia, and motor neurons from 
these stem cell lines to see whether they behave differently than such cells 
from people without ALS.
Scientists also can mix and match normal and genetically mutant neurons — 
that is, neurons that have the genetic changes that cause ALS — astrocytes, 
and microglia in various combinations to test potential drugs. For example, 
scientists know that an SOD1-mutant astrocyte will make normal motor neu-
rons sick in a dish, so they can combine those types of cells and test different 
drugs to see whether any of them can prevent the astrocyte from making the 
motor neuron sick. Figure 9-2 shows how researchers can use stem cells to 
grow motor neurons and astrocytes to test potential drugs.
 
All these techniques are helpful for both understanding how a disease devel-
ops and behaves, and for testing potential treatments. Animal models that 
develop human diseases are extremely useful for this kind of research, but 
there’s no substitute for being able to test theories and drugs on human cells.

Fighting Batten Disease
Batten Disease is a genetic lysosomal storage disease that involves missing 
enzymes in brain cells. Lysosomes (pronounced LIE-so-sohmz) are organelles 
inside cells (see Chapter 2) that store various enzymes that help the lyso-
some break down nutrients and bacteria or viruses that the cell has engulfed. 
Lysosomal storage diseases — there are about 40 — involve some malfunc-
tion of the lysosomes, usually in the form of missing critical enzymes.
Although it affects only 4 in every 100,000 children born in the United States. 
each year, Batten’s effects are devastating; children with Batten disease 
typically become blind, paralyzed, and demented before succumbing. Some 

150
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
Batten patients survive into their late teens or early 20s, but many die much 
earlier. Chapter 12 describes this disease in more detail, as well as clinical 
trials that are under way and aimed at providing brain cells with the missing 
enzymes to prevent further damage.
Those clinical trials are testing fetal neuronal stem cells to see whether 
they’ll supply the missing enzyme to diseased brain cells. Meanwhile, 
researchers are exploring similar approaches to treating Batten, using other 
kinds of stem cells. One idea is to generate new neurons, or neuronal stem 
cells, from human embryonic stem cells that don’t have the Batten defect; 
these cells could then be injected into the brain and, theoretically, per-
form rescue operations by supplying diseased brain cells with the missing 
enzymes. Figure 9-3 shows how such a rescue operation could work.

Scientists also are using stem cell technologies to study potential treatments. 
Similar to the techniques they use to study other diseases, scientists could, 
in principle, reprogram cells from people who have the genetic changes that 
cause Batten Disease and use those reprogrammed cells to develop stem 
cell lines for study and drug testing. They also may be able to introduce the 
genetic changes into human embryonic stem cells and use those cells to gen-
erate neurons for the same purposes.
Finding Treatments for Cerebral Palsy
Cerebral palsy is an umbrella term that covers several kinds of damage to the 
brain’s motor control functions. Although cerebral palsy isn’t progressive — 
it doesn’t get worse over time — it can be severely debilitating. Each year, 
about 10,000 babies are born with cerebral palsy in the United States, and 

151
 Chapter 9: Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases
the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation estimates some 800,000 Americans live 
with at least one of the disease’s symptoms. No one has definitely identified 
what causes cerebral palsy, but at some point during pregnancy, birth, or 
early life, neurons involved in controlling movement either fail or die — pos-
sibly because of insufficient blood flow to key regions of the brain, which 
starves cells of oxygen and other nutrients. Sometimes cerebral palsy occurs 
as the result of a brain injury during or after birth; sometimes it results from 
an infection. Its symptoms may be mild or severe, and, although it isn’t a pro-
gressive disease like Alzheimer’s or ALS, it is permanent.
Current treatments for cerebral palsy are limited to helping patients cope 
with or work around their symptoms. Physical and speech therapy are 
common; drugs can help control muscle spasms and other symptoms; and 
surgery can sometimes improve or correct specific problems related to cere-
bral palsy.
Researchers are looking into using stem cell transplants to restore some 
function in areas of the brain affected by cerebral palsy. Early research, 
mainly in animal models, has indicated that such transplants may be able to 
enhance the brain’s normal growth during early development. But scientists 
have to do a lot more work to determine whether stem cells can provide safe 
and effective treatments for this disease.
Getting a Grip on Huntington’s Disease
Huntington’s disease is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that first affects 
control of muscle movement and leads to dementia and death. It affects 
about 30,000 people in the United States, and some 5 million worldwide. It’s 
most common in people of European descent; people of Asian or African 
ancestry don’t seem to have the genetic changes as often. It’s sometimes 
known as Woody Guthrie’s disease; the folk singer, most famous for the song 
“This Land is Your Land,” suffered declining health and exhibited erratic 
behavior in his mid-30s, which was misdiagnosed as alcoholism and schizo-
phrenia before doctors finally determined he had Huntington’s — which he 
inherited from his mother.
Huntington’s is also one of the few neurodegenerative diseases that is 
100-percent genetic and whose specific genetic mutations are known. It’s 
caused by changes in a gene called Huntingtin, and those rare changes lead to 
a serious and, if severe, invariably fatal disease. When patients are unmedi-
cated, they’re plagued by wild, uncontrollable movements. Other symptoms 
can include irritability, mood swings, and depression, as well as trouble 
learning new material or making decisions.

152
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
 
Drugs can control Huntington’s symptoms for a time, but they can cause side 
effects, such as fatigue or restlessness, and eventually they lose their effective-
ness. Researchers are interested in finding more effective drugs, as well as 
ways to correct the root causes of the disease’s symptoms.
Early in the course of Huntington’s disease, part of the brain’s movement-
control circuitry fails. Neurons fail in the striatum, tissue in the center of the 
brain that works with the substantia nigra (a mass of tissue located below the 
striatum) and the cerebral cortex (the outer layer of the brain, often referred 
to as gray matter) to control movement, mood, and other functions. (Figure 
9-4, in the section “Treating Parkinson’s Disease” later in this chapter, shows 
the striatum, substantia nigra, and cerebral cortex.)
For reasons that researchers don’t completely understand yet, in 
Huntington’s, neurons in the striatum lose their connections and appear to 
die off. One theory is that the neurons in the cortex, which are connected 
to the striatal neurons, don’t deliver the right amounts of substances called 
nerve growth factors. In particular, the striatal neurons don’t appear to get 
enough of a nerve growth factor known as BDNF, which may lead to their 
death.
Because it isn’t really clear whether the striatal neurons are sick or whether 
the neurons in the cortex effectively starve the striatal neurons, research-
ers are studying whether new neurons generated from stem cells have 
any impact on the behavior or progression of the disease, depending on 
whether they’re placed in the cortex or the striatum. Scientists also are look-
ing for ways to deliver BDNF (similar to the approach that may be taken in 
Alzheimer’s; see Figure 9-1) to striatal neurons, as well as for drugs and other 
therapies that may prolong the lives of those neurons or make them less 
abnormal.
Tackling Niemann-Pick Disease
Niemann-Pick Disease, like Batten, is a lysosomal storage disease. In Batten, 
the malfunction is due to a missing enzyme, which can be provided by 
normal cells in a sort of rescue operation. In Niemann-Pick, the cells can’t 
properly use cholesterol and other lipids, or fats, causing harmful buildups in 
the brain, spleen, liver, and other organs.
There are three types of Niemann-Pick:
 
✓ Type A, the most common form of this rare disease, begins in infancy 
and results in an enlarged liver, jaundice, and extensive brain damage. 
It’s generally fatal within 18 months of birth.
 
✓ Type B usually strikes preteens and enlarges the liver and spleen. The 
brain isn’t affected in Type B, and patients often survive into adulthood.

153
 Chapter 9: Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases
 
✓ Type C can strike children, teenagers, and even young adults, but most 
often occurs in children. It typically starts with abnormalities in the liver 
and spleen and then progresses to neurological problems — most often 
starting with eye movement because of defects in the cerebellum, the 
region of the brain that controls movement. Ultimately, Type C leads 
to dementia that’s similar to Alzheimer’s, and this degeneration in the 
brain eventually is fatal.
In Type C, the genetic defect prevents cells from taking up cholesterol, pro-
cessing it normally, and distributing it to the right parts of the cell. Scientists 
identified this problem by studying skin cells from people with the disease. 
The problem in finding treatments for this class of Niemann-Pick has been 
the lack of brain cells to study — and the lethal element of this disease 
appears to be the cholesterol-processing issues that develop in the brain.
 
For years, doctors and researchers thought there was a fourth type of 
Niemann-Pick, called Type D. But recently researchers have discovered that 
the so-called Type D is really a version of Type C.
 
Using human embryonic stem cells or reprogrammed cells (see Chapter 6), 
researchers have generated pluripotent cells that have the Niemann-Pick Type 
C defect. Those pluripotent cells are then induced to develop into neurons so 
that researchers can study how the genetic defect plays out in brain cells and 
test potential drugs. Importantly, scientists also can use these Niemann-Pick 
brain cells to see whether drugs that work on Niemann-Pick skin cells will 
work on neurons, too.
Unfortunately, although there’s some interest in developing cell transplant 
therapies — injecting normal cells into the damaged areas of the brain in 
hopes that the transplanted cells will provide some rescue activity — the evi-
dence that’s been published in scientific journals so far indicates that this kind 
of rescue operation isn’t likely to work in Niemann-Pick. No one knows exactly 
why, and some researchers are pursuing the idea in hopes of finding a break-
through, but so far the outlook for this kind of approach is discouraging.
Treating Parkinson’s Disease
Relatively common as neurodegenerative diseases go, Parkinson’s is most 
identifiable by the uncontrollable tremors and muscle rigidity its victims 
suffer. Actor Michael J. Fox, a vocal proponent of embryonic stem cell 
research, has become the public face of Parkinson’s. Evangelical preacher 
Billy Graham also suffers from Parkinson’s, and Muhammad Ali has a form 
of Parkinson’s possibly caused by brain damage he suffered during his 
legendary boxing career. In the United States, about 500,000 people have 
Parkinson’s, and about 50,000 new cases are reported every year.

154
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
Like many such diseases, Parkinson’s is largely sporadic; most cases develop 
from external causes, such as brain injury (as suspected in the case of Ali) 
or other environmental factors. In addition, rare genetic forms of the disease 
often present symptoms earlier in life than sporadic Parkinson’s does.
 
Although drugs such as L-Dopa can control many Parkinson’s symptoms fairly 
well, this disease is incurable and progressive; it gets worse over time. Besides 
muscle tremor and rigidity, primary symptoms include slowness of movement 
and impaired balance or coordination. Other symptoms that typically appear 
as the disease progresses include
 
✓ Depression, irritability, or other mood changes
 
✓ Difficulty chewing and swallowing
 
✓ Slurred speech or other communication difficulties
 
✓ Sleep disorders
 
✓ Constipation or urinary problems
Symptoms vary widely. Some Parkinson’s patients end up severely disabled, 
even suffering dementia, while others experience only mild symptoms that 
can be managed fairly well with available drugs. Researchers don’t know why 
some people are more affected by the disease than others, and no one yet 
knows how to predict how bad an individual’s symptoms will get. Because of 
this wide range of severity, there’s really no such thing as an average lifespan 
with Parkinson’s; some people live with the disease for 20 years or more, 
while others live only a few years after being diagnosed.
Understanding what happens 
in the Parkinson’s brain
Many of the most severe symptoms of Parkinson’s arise from a deficiency 
of dopamine, a chemical neurotransmitter involved in registering pleasure, 
facilitating sexual desire, and controlling movement. Neurons in the brain’s 
substantia nigra supply dopamine to neurons in the striatum, which signal 
neurons in the cerebral cortex. In Parkinson’s, neurons in the substantia 
nigra malfunction and die, so the striatum doesn’t get its supply of dopamine. 
Figure 9-4 illustrates the neurons that die in Parkinson’s.
Parkinson’s can’t be cured, and its progression can’t be stopped, so current 
treatments focus on alleviating symptoms. Drugs supply dopamine or an 
altered form of dopamine that survives longer in the brain, and they’re pretty 
effective at controlling tremors and rigidity. However, the more severe the 
symptoms, the less effective these drugs seem to be.

Another method for treating Parkinson’s involves using electrical impulses 
to stimulate specific areas of the brain. In deep brain stimulation, or DBS, doc-
tors insert electrodes into the brain and use a device called a pulse generator 
to interfere with normal electrical signals in the targeted region. The Food 
and Drug Administration approved DBS for treating Parkinson’s in 2002, but 
it’s generally reserved for people whose symptoms aren’t responding to med-
ication or to alleviate severe side effects of the medications. Like dopamine 
replacement drugs, DBS only eases symptoms; it doesn’t cure Parkinson’s or 
change the disease’s progression.
 
Even though the most bothersome symptoms for patients come from the 
problems in the substantia nigra, the disease may actually start in other 
regions of the nervous system — such as the olfactory region involving smell, 
or some of the regions involving nervous reactions of the gut — and then 
the problem seems to spread. Scientists are still working on identifying first 
causes of Parkinson’s and figuring out how it ends up affecting neurons in the 
substantia nigra.
Using stem cells to replace critical brain 
cells and seek drug treatments
So far, scientists have taken two main approaches in using stem cells 
(or other cells) to try to develop better treatments for Parkinson’s. One 
approach is to try to generate substantia nigra neurons in the lab, transplant 

156
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
them into the substantia nigra or striatum, and get them to perform their 
normal function of supplying dopamine to the striatum. Theoretically, this 
method would restore control of movement.
The approach isn’t entirely theoretical, though. Over the years, through 
medical innovation and clinical trials (and, frankly, probably some unwar-
ranted experimentation on human subjects), researchers have learned that 
using cells in this fashion — primarily cells taken from the substantia nigra of 
an aborted fetus — seems to have some beneficial effect. Initially, anecdotal 
evidence indicated that some patients got better after this kind of treatment, 
and that discovery led to a few small, double-blind clinical trials (see Chapter 
11). Unfortunately, the clinical trials didn’t demonstrate a statistically sig-
nificant benefit; some patients got better, but some got worse. However, 
those trials showed enough positive evidence that researchers are trying to 
develop similar treatment strategies — but with better controls to learn how 
to deliver the right number and types of cells to the right locations.
The other approach to finding effective treatments involves studying the rare 
hereditary forms of Parkinson’s. As in other diseases with genetic causes, sci-
entists are using reprogrammed cells from hereditary Parkinson’s patients to 
make human neurons with the same genetic changes so that they can try to 
figure out what goes wrong. Then they can compare the behaviors of neurons 
that have the genetic changes in hereditary Parkinson’s, neurons that have 
the genetic constitutions of people with sporadic Parkinson’s, and neurons 
from people who don’t have either form of Parkinson’s to identify similari-
ties — and differences — that may help lead to more effective drugs or other 
kinds of treatment.
Creating New Treatments 
for Spinal Cord Injuries
Spinal cord injuries can be devastating, resulting in severe paralysis and 
myriad complications, such as breathing problems, susceptibility to infec-
tion, and other problems. The spinal cord is a column of nerve tissue that 
extends from the brain down the torso and transmits electrical impulses to 
and from the brain. Your spinal cord has 31 pairs of nerves; one of each pair 
controls functions on the right side of your body, and the other controls 
functions on the left side.
Although it’s encased in bone, cartilage, connective tissue, and fluid designed 
to protect it from shock, the spinal cord is susceptible to damage from falls, 
car accidents, and violent acts, such as gunshot wounds. When the cord 
is injured, the immune system responds by inflaming the site of the injury, 
which can strip nerve cells of their myelin, the insulating sheath that allows 
nerve cells to send and receive signals.

157
 Chapter 9: Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases
Current treatments for spinal cord injuries are limited to blocking inflam-
mation as soon as possible and then subjecting the patient to rehabilitation 
therapies — which are often focused on teaching the patient how to use a 
wheelchair or other devices rendered necessary by the injury.
 
Although many doctors and clinics around the world claim to offer stem cell 
therapies for spinal cord injury, there’s little or no evidence that most of these 
so-called “therapies” are effective. Biotech company Geron is working on 
developing and testing — in rigorous and carefully designed clinical trials — a 
therapy using human embryonic stem cells to make a special cell called an oli-
godendrocyte, which generates myelin. But, at present, no approach is known 
to work, which is why careful and ethical clinical trials are so important.
The Geron approach is designed to be used within the first few months after 
an injury (see Chapter 12). But the quarter-million Americans with older 
spinal cord injuries also desperately need new treatments. Some researchers 
are looking into adapting Geron’s approach for these older injuries — using 
stem cells to stimulate new myelin growth.
These scientists use animal models in the lab, inducing controlled mechani-
cal injury — that is, an injury caused by trauma rather than genetic or other 
factors. Then the scientists test whether neurons or other types of cells that 
are transplanted into the injury site rescue the damaged cells.
Limiting the Effects of Stroke
There are two kinds of stroke. In an ischemic stroke, a blood vessel in the 
brain becomes blocked by a clot, cutting off the blood supply (and the 
oxygen and other essential nutrients blood carries) to that region of the 
brain. In a hemorrhagic stroke, a blood vessel ruptures, allowing blood to 
flood the brain, which kills brain cells. Both types of stroke can also initiate 
an inflammatory response from the immune system, which often causes fur-
ther damage. About 80 percent of all strokes are ischemic.
Current therapies focus on resolving the original problem — opening the 
blocked vessel in ischemic stroke and stopping the bleeding in hemorrhagic 
stroke — and then giving the patient rehabilitation therapy. If the damage 
is limited, rehabilitation often works pretty well because the brain has a 
remarkable ability to wire new pathways when original ones fail. However, 
when the damage is significant — when lots of neurons and other cells have 
died from the stroke — rehabilitation becomes less effective.
Scientists are exploring various ways to use stem cells to repair damage from 
stroke. Depending on who you talk to, you get varying degrees of enthusi-
asm about ideas to transplant stem cells or use them as delivery vehicles 

158
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
for growth factors or other substances that might stimulate the brain’s own 
repair systems, or deliver growth factors or other materials that may help in 
repair.
Some researchers are even looking into the idea of creating drugs that can 
reprogram stem cells in the olfactory system or the new-memory/information-
processing regions of the brain (see the sidebar, “Using the brain’s stem 
cells,” earlier in this chapter) to make repairs in areas outside their normal 
specialties.
 
Many researchers are conducting laboratory studies on animals, using stem 
cells to try to control and repair damage in ischemic stroke — a method that 
also may be useful in treating cerebral palsy. Unlike clot-busting drugs, which 
have to be administered within three hours to be effective, researchers hope 
to find a stem cell therapy that can be beneficial up to seven days — or even 
longer — after a stroke.
Some treatments being tested in animals don’t affect the core area of a 
stroke; stem cells can’t survive in the core because there’s no blood supply. 
But the penumbra — the area of damaged cells around the stroke’s core — 
typically grows for several days after the stroke, and that’s where stem cells 
may be able to contain and even repair damage.
 
Careful clinical trials will be essential to figure out how to make cell transplant 
therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, cerebral palsy, and spinal 
cord injury as safe, as effective, and as reliable as possible. In the meantime, 
regard any current claims of being able to effectively treat such injuries with 
cell transplant therapy with a healthy skepticism (see Chapter 21).

Chapter 10
Improving Therapies for Diseases 
of the Heart, Liver, and Pancreas
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring new potential treatments for heart disease, a leading cause of death
▶ Helping the liver when it can’t help itself
▶ Restoring proper insulin function and response in diabetes
H
eart disease, diabetes, and liver disease kill hundreds of thousands of 
people every year and leave millions of others ailing and even physi-
cally disabled. Aside from the effects on patients and their families, these 
diseases take a huge economic toll, costing billions of dollars in direct health 
care costs and hundreds of millions more in indirect costs — things like lost 
productivity in the workplace, temporary and permanent disability, and pre-
mature death.
In this chapter, we look at diseases in three key organs: the heart, liver, and 
pancreas. We explore the debilitating and often deadly diseases that strike 
these organs, the limitations of current treatments, and how stem cell research 
is being applied to try to solve these all-too-common health problems.
Different Diseases, Common Problems
Although the heart, liver, and pancreas and their related diseases are all dif-
ferent, they have some common elements:
 
✓ The organ is damaged in some way, through injury or disease.
 
✓ Cells of various types die.
 
✓ The organ stops functioning the way it’s supposed to.
 
✓ Reduced function or failure in the affected organ has a domino effect on 
other bodily tissues and functions.

160
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
Damage to the organ can be hereditary, caused by changes in specific genes; 
environmental, resulting from trauma (like a car accident) or exposure to 
toxins or infections arising from viruses or bacteria; degenerative, relating to 
age and the wearing out of cells and tissues; or a combination of these factors.
The challenge is figuring what to do about the damage after it’s done. Drugs 
can control symptoms, but few (if any) drugs can repair damage or restore 
function in the heart, pancreas, or liver. If the damage is severe, an organ 
transplant may be the only way to save the patient’s life. Unfortunately, there 
are never enough donor organs, no matter what kind of organ you need; 
people continually die waiting for donor hearts, livers, kidneys, and other 
organs or tissues.
How do stem cells come in? If the damage is in a tissue that has its own 
cache of stem cells (see Chapter 5), you may be able to stimulate them to 
step up their activities — to make more new cells that can take over for the 
dead or dying cells. You can also try to grow pieces of the organ in the lab, 
using adult, embryonic, or induced pluripotent stem cells as the source (see 
Chapter 6).
 
Even in cases where tissue repair or replacement makes the most sense, you 
still need drugs to help make the repair or transplant succeed. In addition, 
you can use stem cells to generate versions of cells from the relevant tissues 
to test drugs. And you can study those stem cell-derived tissues to figure out 
how the patient’s genetic constitution contributed to the tissue degeneration, 
which may in turn lead to new treatment possibilities.
Getting to the Core of Heart Disease
Heart disease is the No. 1 killer in the United States. It’s an equal opportunity 
killer, too, affecting men and women more or less equally, and ranking as the 
leading cause of death among whites, black, Hispanics, American Indians and 
Alaska natives. (It’s the second leading cause of death among people of Asian 
and Pacific Island ancestry; cancer is the top killer in that group.)
Risk factors for developing heart disease include obesity, lack of exercise, smok-
ing, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, among other things. Heredity 
may play a role, too, although that isn’t always the case; as an example, Meg’s 
mother’s family had a history of heart disease and her father’s family had a 
history of cancer, but her father had a heart attack and her mother developed 
breast cancer. (Both, luckily, survived with few long-term effects.)
 
Doctors have a range of drugs and surgical techniques to treat heart disease 
before and after a heart attack. Medications can control blood pressure and 
cholesterol levels, for example, and angioplasty — opening a blocked artery 
and, if necessary, inserting a device called a stent to keep it open — can 

161
 Chapter 10: Improving Therapies for Diseases of the Heart, Liver, and Pancreas
restore blood flow to the heart muscle. But most of these therapies don’t pre-
vent or stop degeneration of the heart muscle or the blood vessels that supply 
the heart, so eventually you either have to fix the organ or replace it.
Most heart disease is cardiovascular, meaning it affects the heart (cardio), 
the blood vessels (vascular) in and around the heart, or both. (It’s also some-
times called coronary heart disease or coronary artery disease; technically, 
both terms mean abnormalities in the structure or function of the heart’s 
blood vessels, which impair the ability of the heart muscle to pump blood 
adequately.) This kind of heart disease is by far the most common, respon-
sible for nearly seven of every ten heart disease deaths.
In coronary heart disease, blood flow to the heart is restricted, either by a 
blockage in one or more blood vessels or because of damage to the vessels. 
Restricted blood flow deprives heart muscle cells of the proper amounts of 
oxygen and other nutrients, so they weaken and eventually die. Lost muscle 
cells in the heart aren’t naturally replaced, and scar tissue often appears in 
place of the dead muscle cells, resulting in changes in elasticity and pump-
ing ability. Depending on the extent of the damage, the heart may “remodel” 
itself to make up for the loss of function in the damaged area. But remodeling 
causes the heart muscle to stretch and eventually weaken, just as a strip of 
elastic eventually loses its ability to snap back if it’s stretched too far for too 
long. So remodeling, even though it helps the heart maintain its function in 
the short term, can increase the degree of damage over the long term.
This type of damage can happen gradually, or it can happen all at once in a 
heart attack. People with coronary heart disease typically have restricted 
blood flow to and through the heart regardless of whether they suffer a heart 
attack. In a heart attack, a large blockage stops the blood flow, and a chunk 
of the heart muscle dies. Even if the patient survives — and heart attack sur-
vival rates are much better than they used to be — the damage is done and, 
at least at this point, can’t be undone.
Using stem cells to look 
for new treatments
Stem cell researchers envision a variety of potential approaches to fixing the 
damage done by coronary heart disease. Among the possibilities are using 
stem cells to
 
✓ Generate new blood vessels. The new vessels would ensure that the 
remaining heart tissues get sufficient oxygen, which could prevent 
further damage to the heart muscle. New blood vessels also would be 
required in any therapy that involves transplanting or stimulating new 
muscle tissue, so some researchers are looking into growing new muscle 
tissue and blood vessels together

162
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
 
✓ Grow new heart muscle tissue. The new tissue could then be used to 
patch the damaged area(s) of the heart.
 
✓ Stimulate blood vessel growth or repair of muscle tissue. Researchers 
are experimenting (in animals and in humans) with injecting various 
kinds of stem cells to prompt this sort of repair activity, or, failing 
that, encourage the remaining healthy tissues (or even scar tissue) to 
perform better. Most experiments involve either hematopoietic (blood-
forming) or mesenchymal stem cells (cells that generate connective 
tissue like tendons); a few scientists also are investigating using stem 
cells from skeletal muscles.
 
✓ Stimulate the heart’s own stem cells to step up repair activity. There’s 
still some debate about whether the heart has its own set of stem cells, 
but the weight of evidence is tipping toward proving their existence. So 
some researchers are looking at ways to give those stem cells a sort of 
power boost so that they provide more and faster repair functions.
Nearly all the stem cell treatments being tested now in people use adult, 
rather than embryonic, stem cells. Unlike human embryonic stem cell 
research, adult stem cell research generates little (if any) controversy, so 
the potential treatments for heart disease don’t encounter the same kind of 
political resistance that researchers focusing on other diseases sometimes 
run into.
 
All these experiments are testing delivery methods as well as basic 
approaches. No one knows yet whether it’s safest or most effective to intro-
duce stem cell-based therapies directly into the heart muscle, into the vessels 
in and around the heart, or into the bloodstream. Likewise, researchers are 
trying to figure out whether injections, catheters, or surgery work best to 
apply the therapies. It’s still far too early in the testing game to predict which 
therapy or delivery method, if any, will deliver the desired results reliably — 
despite claims of “cures” you may see from offshore clinics.
Researchers also are using stem cells to test potential drugs for heart disease. 
In the lab, they give cells the same kind of damage commonly seen in heart dis-
ease or give the cells genetic predispositions that impair the cells’ function and 
performance and then look for drugs that can treat those problems.
Looking at a current clinical 
trial involving stem cells
Researchers are currently conducting lots of clinical trials for various stem 
cell-based therapies for heart disease. Early results so far have been mixed, 
with some therapies showing promise and others demonstrating disappoint-
ing — or at least not as positive as expected — outcomes.

163
 Chapter 10: Improving Therapies for Diseases of the Heart, Liver, and Pancreas
One intriguing clinical trial is testing a technique that involves harvesting a 
patient’s bone marrow stem cells, purifying them, and then injecting them 
back into the same patient’s heart muscle. The stem cells are thought to be 
capable of growing new blood vessels (identified as such by a specific marker 
on the cells’ surfaces), and the idea is that, once in place in the heart muscle, 
these cells will work to improve blood flow to the targeted tissue. At this 
point, the treatment is being tested on patients who’ve had limited or no ben-
efit from all other available treatments.
The researchers conducting this trial, which is sponsored by healthcare com-
pany Baxter International Inc., report no side effects so far from the therapy. 
There are some risks because the cells are delivered through a catheter, which 
could perforate the heart tissue, and the drug that mobilizes the stem cells can 
cause clotting problems. Injecting the cells directly into the heart muscle also 
may increase the risk of inducing arrhythmia, or irregular heart beat.
Another trial involves using intravenous (IV) injections of a therapy con-
taining mesenchymal stem cells to repair heart muscle damage in patients 
who’ve had only one heart attack.
Considering challenges to using stem cell 
treatments for heart disease
As promising as some stem cell-based therapies may be for treating heart dis-
ease, there are still plenty of challenges to overcome. One is figuring out how 
to get the cells to go where you want them to go. Of course, you can try inject-
ing them directly into the heart muscle, but that approach can be risky — and 
even if you inject the cells into the heart muscle, they may not stay there. Some 
researchers are experimenting with so-called homing markers on cell surfaces 
that would, theoretically, direct them to the right places in the body; they’ve 
had some success in using homing markers in animal models.
The other main challenge is coming up with enough cells for an effective 
treatment. (This issue is true of lots of therapies, not just those for heart dis-
ease.) For example, one research team injected bone marrow stem cells into 
the leg skeletal muscles of mice and reported that the injected cells produced 
growth factors that traveled to the heart. The injected cells also apparently 
stimulated the muscle cells at the injection site to make additional growth 
factors that helped improve heart function. However, to work in humans, 
researchers would need about 1 billion cells for each patient, compared with 
only a few million cells for each mouse. Generating that many cells in the lab 
would be expensive, not to mention logistically difficult. So researchers are 
also trying to figure out how to accomplish the same goal with far fewer bone 
marrow stem cells.

164
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
 
Finally, researchers simply don’t know how an introduced stem cell — 
whether it’s the patient’s own stem cell or whether it comes from another 
donor — behaves in the body over the course of time. This consideration is 
important because, unlike most drugs that eventually are flushed out of the 
body, stem cells settle into their new hosts and may stay there for the rest of 
the host’s life. Most stem cell therapies are so new (with the exception of bone 
marrow transplants) that no one knows what an introduced stem cell will do 
5, 10, or 20 years down the road.
Still, some researchers think stem cell-based therapies for heart disease 
could be available to the general population in as little as five to ten years. A 
few even predict the first such therapies will hit the market in the next two 
to four years. Of course, such therapies could be much further away. It really 
depends on how long it takes for careful experiments to identify treatments 
that are safe and effective.
Looking into Potential Treatments 
for Liver Disease
The liver is your body’s great detoxifier. All the blood that leaves the stom-
ach and intestines passes through the liver, which pulls out and processes 
nutrients and drugs so that the rest of the body can use them more easily. 
The liver also is part of your immune system; it cleanses the blood of bacte-
ria and other toxic elements and pushes them out of the body through either 
the kidneys or the excretory system (see Chapter 2).
Researchers have identified more than 500 functions that the liver carries 
out, including
 
✓ Producing bile, which helps the small intestine digest fats and assists in

As impressive as all those functions are, one of the liver’s most amazing prop-
erties is its incredible ability to regenerate itself (see Chapter 2). The liver can 
lose as much as 75 percent of its cells before it stops functioning, and it can 
grow new tissue even when it loses significant chunks of itself.
Even so, the liver isn’t invincible. Liver tissue can be damaged through injury 
or disease, such as hepatitis (usually caused by viruses or bacteria) or cir-
rhosis (most often caused by chronic alcohol abuse). If the damage is too 
extensive, or if it recurs — for example, if the liver suffers repeated bouts of 
inflammation, which can damage cells and tissues — the organ’s regenerative 
system becomes overwhelmed and eventually can wear out. So scientists are 
interested in using stem cells to help fix liver damage when the liver can’t do 
it on its own.
 
About 25 million Americans suffer from liver diseases like hepatitis and cir-
rhosis. Each year, some 18,000 people need a liver transplant because their 
own livers are too damaged to either regenerate or function properly, but only 
about 5,000 donor livers are available in a given year. And the trend of severe 
shortages of donor livers (and other vital organs, for that matter) is getting 
worse; every year, far more people die waiting for an organ transplant than 
receive one. (See Chapter 13 for more on how transplants work, donor short-
ages, and how to become an organ donor.)
Given the woefully inadequate supply of donor livers, stem cell research is 
particularly essential for people with chronic liver disease. Scientists are 
exploring all kinds of possible treatment avenues, using all kinds of different 
stem cells.
Some possibilities are
 
✓ Using stem cells to grow new liver tissue. If scientists can reliably grow 
substantial amounts of liver tissues in the lab, they may be able to graft 
those tissues to the damaged liver. Then the new tissue could either take 
over liver function from the damaged organ or perhaps provide rescue 
activity to restore some degree of function to the damaged tissue.
 
✓ Developing drugs that spur the liver’s stem cells to improved function. 
As in other diseases that affect other organs or tissues, scientists can use 
stem cell technologies to grow liver cells in the lab, give them the same 
kind of damage that occurs in disease, and then test various potential 
drugs to see whether any of them stimulate repair operations in the cells.
 
Because the liver can function with only a fraction of its total cells, therapies 
derived from stem cell research could be designed — at least initially — to 
provide interim help to patients rather than a permanent fix. For example, if 
scientists can figure out a way to keep a severely damaged liver functioning for 

166
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
a longer period, it may help keep patients alive while they wait for a suitable 
donor liver to become available for transplant. The “buying time” approach 
could be critical to thousands of people waiting for new livers because, when 
the liver fails, life expectancy is measured in days rather than weeks, months, or 
years.
Various labs are investigating different ways of growing liver cells — from embry-
onic, mesenchymal, and liver stem cells — but, so far, attempts to restore liver 
function by transplanting cells have had mixed results. As is the case with so 
many areas of stem cell research, it’s too early to tell for sure which methods 
may turn out to be both safe and effective. Because there’s still so much work to 
do, developing reliable treatments for humans probably will take years.
Treating Diseases of the Pancreas
The pancreas (pronounced PAN-kree-us) helps your body digest food and 
use its components for energy. Most of its tissue is devoted to helping the 
small intestine break down food. But it also produces several hormones and 
enzymes, including insulin, which it releases directly into the bloodstream to 
help control glucose, or sugar, levels in the blood.
Pancreatic diseases include pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, 
which typically occurs when the main duct from the pancreas is blocked. 
Digestive and other enzymes can build up in the pancreas and even lead 
to the pancreas digesting itself. Cancer also can develop in the pancreas, 
although it may start somewhere else and migrate, or metastasize, to the pan-
creas (see Chapter 8 for more on various types of cancer). Alcohol abuse is 
linked to both pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer; other risk factors include 
diabetes, smoking, and drug use.
To most people, though, the best-known pancreatic disease is diabetes. 
The pancreas contains hundreds of thousands of cell clusters called islets 
of Langerhans (generally referred to simply as islets), which hang out with 
each other in formations that resemble tiny bunches of grapes. The islets 
are home to beta cells, which produce insulin. Insulin circulates through the 
bloodstream, telling other cells, such as muscle and liver cells, to absorb 
sugars from the blood. Cells then use the sugars to feed themselves and 
create the compounds they need to function properly (see Chapter 2).
When the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin — or when the body can’t 
use the insulin properly — blood glucose gets out of control and can cause 
serious damage. Diabetes is a huge health problem in the United States. It 
affects more than 23 million Americans, or almost 8 percent of the population, 
and it’s the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. (See the nearby 
sidebar, “Quick facts about diabetes,” for more on the impact of this disease, 
and check out Diabetes For Dummies [Wiley] by Alan L. Rubin, M.D.)

167
 Chapter 10: Improving Therapies for Diseases of the Heart, Liver, and Pancreas
The following sections describe the two main types of diabetes and how stem 
cell research is being applied to find better treatments for each type.
Investigating stem cell therapies 
for Type 1 diabetes
In Type 1 diabetes, often called juvenile diabetes, the body’s immune system 
runs amok, attacking and killing the beta cells in the pancreas. Without the 
beta cells, the pancreas doesn’t produce insulin, and without insulin in the 
bloodstream, other cells don’t get the signal to take up sugar. High levels of 
sugar in the blood for prolonged periods damages a number of tissues and 
organs and can lead to blindness, kidney problems, loss of limbs, and all 
kinds of unpleasantness.
People with Type 1 diabetes must continually monitor their blood sugar levels 
and periodically inject themselves with insulin so that other cells can absorb 
sugar from the bloodstream. The problem is that, even though insulin injec-
tions are pretty effective at keeping diabetes under control, this treatment 
can’t mimic the minute-by-minute monitoring of glucose levels and instant 
response to high glucose that a healthy pancreas provides. So Type 1 diabetics 
live with a continuing cycle of alternating high glucose levels and high insulin 
levels.
Quick facts about diabetes
According to the American Diabetes 
Association (www.diabetes.org), an esti-
mated 23.6 million Americans have some form 
of the disease. Of those, almost 6 million are 
diabetic but haven’t been diagnosed, in part 
because, until it begins to cause problems with 
organs and organ systems, it’s a more or less 
painless ailment.
Diabetes typically is accompanied by a slew of 
other health issues, including high blood pres-
sure (about three-quarters of all diabetics), 
heart disease (affecting as many as seven in 
ten diabetics), and an increased risk of suffer-
ing a heart attack or stroke.
Complications of diabetes include blindness; 
the disease is the leading cause of new cases 
of blindness in people between the ages of 20 
and 74. Nearly half of all new cases of kidney 
failure each year are attributed to diabetes. 
As many as seven in ten diabetics have nerve 
system damage, particularly in the feet and 
hands; this damage can lead to amputation of 
toes, fingers, feet, and hands. (Sixty percent of 
nontraumatic amputations are performed on 
people with diabetes.)
Finally, diabetes is an expensive disease. The 
ADA estimates direct medical costs associated 
with the disease at $116 billion every year, with 
indirect costs — such as disability benefits, loss 
of workplace productivity, and early death — 
adding another $58 billion to the annual tally.

168
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
Stem cell researchers are investigating two possibilities for restoring beta 
cell function. One approach is to stimulate the existing stem cells in the pan-
creas to make new beta cells. It’s a fine idea, if the pancreas actually does 
have caches of appropriate stem cells; the evidence isn’t at all clear, and 
researchers are debating the point.
The other approach is to make new pancreas cells in the lab from pluripotent 
stem cells and transplant them using the so-called Edmonton protocol (see 
Chapter 12).
 
In both these approaches, scientists have to figure out some way of taming the 
immune system to ensure that it doesn’t attack any new cells. Even suppos-
ing that the pancreas has its own stem cells and that those stem cells can be 
induced to generate new beta cells, the core problem — the immune system–
attacking beta cells — has to be addressed so that the new beta cells don’t meet 
the same fate as the ones they replace. Likewise, transplanted beta cells — even 
if they’re grown from the patient’s own tissue stem cells — are vulnerable to 
attacks from the immune system. So either the immune system has to be reset 
in some way to stop the attacks, or the beta cells have to be put in a protective 
device that allows insulin and sugar to cross in and out but keeps the immune 
system at bay.
Exploring stem cell treatment 
ideas for Type 2 diabetes
In Type 2 diabetes, sometimes referred to as adult-onset diabetes, cells stop 
responding to insulin. Initially, the beta cells in the pancreas function normally, 
producing the proper amounts of insulin, but for some reason (not yet fully 
understood) cells ignore the signals from insulin that tell them to absorb blood 
sugar. As the cells become more resistant to the insulin, the beta cells respond 
by sending out more of it, and eventually all this extra effort wears out the beta 
cells. When that happens, people with Type 2 diabetes have the same problem 
as people with Type 1: Their bodies don’t produce enough insulin. Then they 
have to take insulin periodically, either orally or via injection.
Obesity and lack of exercise, along with a few other health and lifestyle condi-
tions, are prime risk factors for Type 2 diabetes. When people are considered 
prediabetic — that is, when blood tests indicate the body’s cells may be at 
risk for becoming resistant to insulin — their doctors typically recommend 
changes in diet and exercise patterns to decrease their chances of develop-
ing full diabetes. When the beta cells wear out, current treatment consists 
of replacing the lost beta cell function by taking supplemental insulin, and 
sometimes taking other drugs, too. Future treatment may include replacing 
the beta cells, using the same methods we outline for Type 1 diabetes (see 
the preceding section).

169
 Chapter 10: Improving Therapies for Diseases of the Heart, Liver, and Pancreas
 
In theory, Type 2 diabetics don’t have the same immune system issues as 
people with Type 1 (although that idea hasn’t been proven beyond a reason-
able doubt yet), so replacing the beta cells may be less complex than it is for 
Type 1. However, if the transplanted beta cells aren’t genetically identical to 
the patient, the immune system likely will attack them as foreign invaders. So 
the patient either has to take drugs that suppress the immune system (and 
thus make the patient more vulnerable to infection), or the beta cells have to 
be protected in some way from immune system attacks. Also, beta cell trans-
plants won’t resolve the insulin resistance of other cells in the body.
In addition to stimulating putative pancreatic stem cells to generate new beta 
cells or transplanting lab-grown beta cells into the pancreas, scientists hope 
to use stem cell technology to make cellular models of insulin resistance 
and then study those models to look for the mechanisms that lead to insulin 
resistance and test drugs that may mitigate or reverse the resistance.
 
Because scientists can use reprogrammed or induced pluripotent stem cells 
(see Chapter 6) to capture and study the human genome — the entire genetic 
library of an individual or species — they also can investigate why certain 
ethnic groups are so much more susceptible than others to Type 2 diabetes. 
These researchers are trying to learn whether diet and exercise are really the 
main determinants, or whether subtle genetic changes also may predispose 
individuals or specific groups to developing diabetes. There’s certainly evi-
dence that ethnicity may play a role; Native Americans, for example, have the 
highest incidence of diabetes of any ethnic group. But no one knows for sure 
what the relative contributions of lifestyle factors and genetic variations are.

Improving Drug Development
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the risks and benefits of current drugs
▶ Taking a peek into the drug development process
▶ Seeing how stem cell research can improve drug development
T
he Holy Grail of drug development is the perfect pill or potion: one that 
cures the disease, produces no side effects, and is inexpensive to pro-
duce. The fortunate doctors and patients on television grasp the Holy Grail 
all the time. An episode starts with a deathly ill patient; the doctors huddle, 
run some tests, and find the perfect pill or potion; the patient gets well; and 
everyone moves on to scenes from the next episode.
In reality, neither the practice of medicine nor the research behind it is so 
neat and tidy. Historically, the closest thing to a perfect pill or potion is 
antibiotics, which are cheap, usually very safe, and usually very effective at 
curing bacterial infections. But even these wonder drugs aren’t ideal. Some 
people are allergic to penicillin, for example, and some infections are resis-
tant to it.
Developing effective drugs is a lot harder than it seems. Part of the problem 
is that researchers don’t really understand everything about how cells, tis-
sues, and organs work, so they don’t always know how they might go about 
fixing the things that go wrong in disease. Even when they do know what’s 
wrong and have good ideas for how they may be able to fix it, finding the 
right drug — the one that’s both safe and effective — takes years of hard 
work and persistence.
In this chapter, we explain the good and not-so-good aspects of current drug 
treatments, including the difference between drugs that treat symptoms and 
drugs that actually fix the underlying problem. We take you through the drug 
development process and show you why, even after years of research and 
testing, a given drug may not live up to its initial promise. Finally, we show 
you how research on stem cells — from a variety of sources — has the poten-
tial to transform new drug development from a lengthy and sometimes unpre-
dictable trial-and-error process to a more efficient and effective process 
based on better knowledge of what really goes wrong in specific diseases.

Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
Weighing the Pros and Cons 
of Current Drug Treatments
Virtually no one is completely satisfied with the state of drug therapies 
today. Researchers aren’t completely happy because in many ways they’re 
like inexperienced auto mechanics: They know the car needs oil, for example, 
but they aren’t familiar with all the reasons why a car may run out of oil or all 
the consequences of insufficient or dirty oil.
Healthcare providers aren’t completely happy, either, because treating disease 
in real life often is as much trial-and-error as finding effective drugs. Every 
patient is different, with different tolerances for drugs and different specific 
health issues, so healthcare providers often have to experiment with treat-
ments and dosages to find the most effective combination for each patient.
And patients aren’t entirely at ease because medical treatments can be con-
fusing, expensive, and time-consuming, and the treatments may not work as 
well as the patient hoped or expected.
 
The truth is that every drug treatment has pros and cons — what research-
ers and healthcare providers call a risk-benefit profile or analysis. The drug 
treatments available today aren’t nearly as perfect as everyone would like, 
but many of them work very well and are safe and relatively inexpensive. And 
even the ones that aren’t as good are still better than no treatment at all.
The following sections explore the main pros and cons of drug treatments: 
effectiveness and side effects.
Doing their job well
Most drugs work in one of two ways: They either treat the disease itself, or 
they treat the symptoms the disease causes. Drugs that treat the disease 
generally prolong life. Drugs that treat only symptoms generally improve the 
quality of life, but they don’t necessarily lengthen your life.
Both kinds of drugs can be quite effective in doing their jobs. Statins, for 
example, are very effective at reducing the synthesis of cholesterol, and so 
are widely used to treat high blood cholesterol levels. Painkillers are effective 
in reducing the symptoms of, say, arthritis or a torn muscle, although they 
don’t actually cure either health problem.
Many of the drug treatments on the market today fall into the symptom-treating 
category. And many of the disease-treating drugs resolve health problems that 
don’t generate any obvious symptoms, such as high blood pressure and high 
cholesterol.

173
 Chapter 11: Improving Drug Development
 
Sometimes people get frustrated with drug therapies not because the drug 
itself doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to, but because it treats symptoms 
rather than the cause of the symptoms. Drugs can improve memory functions 
for Alzheimer’s patients, for example, but they don’t change the rate at which 
Alzheimer’s disease progresses. Naturally, then, Alzheimer’s patients and their 
loved ones are frustrated because the available treatments don’t fix the under-
lying problem.
For diseases where drugs treat symptoms but not root causes, researchers 
also get frustrated, which is why they’re so interested in studying and work-
ing with stem cells. Stem cells can teach researchers how cells normally 
work, how they interact in tissues and organs, and how normal develop-
ment proceeds; studying stem cells also can help researchers identify the 
mechanisms that lead to disease. Then, like an experienced auto mechanic 
who knows that a car keeps running out of oil because it has a leak and fixes 
the leak, researchers can figure out how to fix the root cause of disease (and 
eliminate the symptoms, too).
Bringing along unwanted guests
You’ve probably seen television commercials for prescription drugs that 
tell you how effective the drug is, followed by an often-frightening litany of 
potential side effects. (Our favorites are the ones that warn of “potentially 
fatal” side effects, which make us think we’d rather suffer with the medical 
condition.) Irony aside, though, these ads highlight an important point: Every 
medical therapy has side effects. Even aspirin, arguably the safest drug ever 
made, can irritate your stomach and cause gastrointestinal bleeding if you 
take too much of it.
Side effects can be temporary, or they can develop over time. Long-term side 
effects include
 
✓ Damage to organs or organ systems (see Chapter 2): Some drugs can 
cause kidney, liver, or heart damage if you take them for a long time. 
Ibuprofen, for example, can harm your kidneys and liver if you take it 
frequently for several years.
 
✓ Drug-resistance or tolerance: Over time, you can build up a tolerance 
for certain drugs, so you need to take it more often or in higher doses 
to get the same effect. This warning is especially true with painkillers, 
narcotics-like sleep aids, and even antibiotics. Some drugs simply lose 
their effectiveness altogether; Dopamine works well in treating Parkinson’s 
symptoms, for example, but eventually it stops having any effect, no 
matter how you adjust your intake.

174
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
 
Although the medications that make it to the marketplace have been tested 
and studied and tested again for safety and effectiveness, no drug works 
exactly the same way in everyone. Some people can’t tolerate aspirin, and 
others can chew aspirin tablets as if they were candy and never experience a 
single side effect. This difference in drug reactions is mainly due to the tiny 
genetic differences among individuals. Add in myriad combinations of health 
issues and the way certain drugs can interact with each other, and the true 
complexity of finding safe, effective drugs begins to emerge.
So why take a drug that may cause nausea, dry mouth, headache, stomach 
ulcers, or even worse side effects? The only good reason is that the benefits 
outweigh the risks. For example, the side effects of radiation and chemother-
apy include nausea, muscle weakness, and hair loss. But if you have cancer, 
radiation and chemotherapy may be the best available treatments, and the 
risk of experiencing the side effects is acceptable when you weigh it against 
the benefit of slowing or stopping the cancer’s growth. On the other hand, 
if you have a sore throat, the risk of having your hair fall out probably isn’t 
worth the benefit of being able to swallow comfortably.
Looking at Why Drugs Are So Expensive
Experts and pundits have written volumes on why prices for prescription 
medications are so high. Part of the explanation lies in economics — market 
forces, publicly traded companies that have to appease shareholders, gov-
ernment regulations, and so on.
But a big part of the reason is that research and development for new drugs 
is expensive. It can be much cheaper to use existing drugs to treat other 
health problems — such as prescribing low-dose aspirin to help fight heart 
disease or the antidepressant Wellbutrin (also known as Zyban) as a stop-
smoking aid.
Making new drugs from scratch, and even modifying existing drugs to make 
them work better, however, is a slow and expensive process. Some drugs, 
such as antibiotics, have been discovered almost accidentally, and some (like 
aspirin) have been refined from cruder forms that date back to ancient times. 
But, for the most part, the search for new drugs involves a tedious and time-
consuming process of elimination.
 
Developing a drug from concept to market can take 12 to 15 years. In the 
United States, patents are valid for a maximum of 20 years, leaving pharma-
ceutical companies a narrow window in which to recoup their research and 
development costs and make a profit off a given drug — because, in many 

175
 Chapter 11: Improving Drug Development
cases, companies file patents before they’re ready to start clinical trials. When 
drug patents expire, other companies can make generic versions that cost a 
fraction of the patented drug, and numerous studies have shown that sales of 
name-brand drugs drop precipitously when generics become available.
In the following sections, we take you through the steps of finding potential 
drugs, testing their safety and effectiveness, and getting them to market.
Finding promising drug-like chemicals
Before researchers can identify potential new drugs, they have to decide how 
to test various chemicals and measure the results. The most common meth-
ods, called assays, involve test-tube reactions, cell cultures, and animals. 
Good assays recreate the biochemical pathways that researchers suspect are 
abnormal in a given disease. In some cases, researchers make animal models 
of human diseases, which allows them to both study cell behavior in the dis-
ease and test chemicals that may treat the disease or its symptoms.
After they choose the assay, researchers then begin testing lots of chemicals — 
hundreds of thousands, or even a million or more — one by one to see what 
happens. (If you’re thinking this approach is pretty scattershot, you’re right. 
But it’s almost unavoidable, partly because so many chemicals exist, and partly 
because researchers don’t yet fully understand the mechanisms that trigger 
many diseases.)
 
In test-tube and cell culture assays, automation makes the search for promis-
ing chemicals much more efficient. Robotic equipment handles the mundane 
work of adding the chemicals to the assay samples, moving the samples 
around, and measuring the results. These machines can handle tens of thou-
sands, or even hundreds of thousands, of samples a day, far beyond the capa-
bilities of human researchers.
Out of hundreds of thousands of chemicals, only a tiny fraction yield promis-
ing results. Chemists then work on the promising candidates, modifying the 
chemicals to improve their effectiveness — another time-consuming process. 
After the chemists are done, researchers test the improved chemicals on the 
original assays — again taking precise measurements to determine how well 
the chemicals work.
If the improved chemicals work well in the original assays, researchers then 
test them on animals, primarily to see whether the chemicals are safe and that 
the benefits — easing symptoms or changing the course of the disease — out-
weigh any unintended effects. Figure 11-1 shows how the drug development 
pipeline works.

Only a few drug-like compounds emerge from the assay and animal testing 
processes. Some people find the low ratio of hits to misses discouraging, 
especially because these early tests take so much time. But these preliminary 
steps are absolutely essential in drug development. You can’t take random 
chemicals off the shelf and test them in humans. You have to have some evi-
dence that human testing, when you do it, will be worthwhile — that is, that 
the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. With current technology, 
the only way to gather that evidence is to go through the laborious elimination 
and testing processes described in this section.
Proving a drug’s safety and effectiveness
When testing on humans begins, determining a drug’s safety is the first prior-
ity. Initial tests on people — called Phase I trials — usually involve only a few 
volunteer subjects — often as few as 12 or 18 people. Drug doses start small 
and gradually increase so that researchers can determine where toxic effects 
come in.
Researchers usually select healthy people for Phase I tests because the focus 
is primarily on drug safety, not its effectiveness. Because the sample is so 
small, and because Phase I trials usually aren’t designed to weed out unreli-
able reports of improvement, most suggestions of efficacy at this stage aren’t 
statistically significant. The following sections describe what clinical trials 
are and how they work.

177
 Chapter 11: Improving Drug Development
Understanding clinical trials
Clinical trials are controlled tests of drugs, medical devices (such as pace-
makers), and surgical procedures in humans. Patients are randomly assigned 
to receive either the drug being tested, a placebo (a harmless substance, 
such as a sugar pill), or no treatment at all. In single-blind trials, the patients 
don’t know whether they’re receiving the drug or a placebo, but the physi-
cian administering the treatment knows which patients are getting the drug.
In double-blind trials, neither the patients nor the physician know who’s 
getting the treatment. Double-blind trials are considered more trustworthy 
because they minimize the chances of physicians being influenced by their 
natural desire to see improvement in their patients and patients’ natural 
desire to get better.
 
By definition, clinical trials are conducted on human subjects; if researchers 
are conducting tests on animals, it isn’t a clinical trial.
Participation in clinical trials is completely voluntary. Patients (or their des-
ignated proxies (parents or legal guardians when the patients are children or 
otherwise unable to make their own decisions) must give their informed 
consent — that is, they must be told of the treatment’s known potential risks 
and benefits and told that there may be unknown risks (because, often, the 
risks become apparent only after testing in humans has begun).
Going through the phases of clinical trials
Clinical trials typically have three or four phases. The cost of trials goes 
up steeply as they progress, adding more patients and more time. Phase 
I trials involve, at most, a few dozen people and test for the drug’s safety, 
not for effectiveness. In Phase II, the patient pool expands to a few hundred 
people, and testing, which lasts one to three years, focuses on both safety 
and effectiveness.
Phase III trials involve larger numbers of patients — in some instances, 
between 1,000 and 3,000 patients — and often run for one to two years. Phase 
IV trials can run for as long as five to ten years to assess the drug’s long-term 
safety and effectiveness; unlike earlier phases, Phase IV trials are designed to 
be carried out as part of the patients’ regular medical care, to better imitate 
real-world conditions.
Pharmaceutical companies and researchers often continue to monitor safety 
and effectiveness after the drug is on the market. These follow-ups can run 
for decades and are designed to spot two main things: potential risks in 
patients with other health issues (or adverse interactions with other medica-
tions) and possible off-label uses for treating other conditions. This long-term 
tracking is how researchers discovered that the antidepressant Wellbutrin 
could be useful as a stop-smoking aid.

178
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
 
The safest drug in the world isn’t much use if it doesn’t treat the cause or 
symptoms of a disease. So, after initial human testing indicates a drug is safe, 
researchers begin measuring its effectiveness. Safety isn’t taken for granted; it 
simply shares the spotlight with the question of whether the drug actually 
works. Phase II, Phase III, and Phase IV trials monitor both aspects of a drug; 
those drugs that are shown to be safe and effective undergo regulatory review 
(see the following section).
Getting the regulatory green light
When clinical trials are complete (usually after Phase III) and researchers 
(or pharmaceutical companies) can document that a drug is safe and effec-
tive for the disease they’re trying to treat, the next step is getting regulatory 
approval. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
determines which drugs meet its criteria and can be placed on the market. In 
Europe, the European Medicines Agency regulates drugs, and, in some cases, 
individual countries have their own review and approval processes.
As the gatekeeper for new drugs in the United States, the FDA is in an unenvi-
able position. The agency regularly finds itself under fire for being either too 
slow and bureaucratic in allowing promising treatments to enter the mar-
ketplace or for being too quick to approve drugs without proof that they’re 
safe to use. The first criticism tends to come from patients with terrible (and 
often terminal) disorders, who are understandably eager for access to any 
treatment that offers a glimmer of hope. The second criticism tends to come 
from patients (or their families) who suffer unanticipated side effects from a 
newly approved drug.
Given the arduous path from idea to market, it’s almost a marvel that any 
drug makes it into your local pharmacy’s inventory. The numbers are cer-
tainly discouraging: Of every ten drugs that begin clinical trials, only one is 
approved for use. Developing new drugs is fraught with false starts, blind 
alleys, and a plethora of miscalculations and misadventures. Figure 11-2 illus-
trates the potential problems at every step of the process.
 
The clinical trial and regulatory systems aren’t perfect, and people continually 
offer proposals for improving them. The safeguards slow down the process, 
but they help ensure that new drugs do what they’re supposed to do. Still, 
even with all the safeguards, some drugs have unexpected — and sometimes 
dangerous — side effects. Sometimes the dangers are predictable, but, more 
often, these additional risks become apparent only when the sample size 
explodes from a few thousand to millions of patients.

Getting Stem Cells into the Act
Stem cell research holds a great deal of promise in making the drug devel-
opment process more efficient. Under the current testing protocols, only a 
handful of promising drugs make it past Phase I clinical trials because, many 
times, drugs that seem to be safe and effective in animals aren’t safe and 
effective for humans. Although mice and other lab animals provide important 
insights into how diseases work, some things — especially disease progres-
sion and possible treatments in the heart and brain — just don’t translate 
well from animal models to humans.
One of the biggest potential advantages of using stem cells in drug develop-
ment is that researchers can test a drug’s safety and effectiveness in human 
tissues without exposing patients to any risk. Clinical trials with live people 
probably can’t be eliminated. However, especially early in the process, 
researchers may be able to identify and discard chemicals that aren’t likely 
to work in humans and focus instead on more promising possibilities.
Using human stem cells to test drug therapies offers a number of potential 
benefits. Stem cells can help researchers overcome several current chal-
lenges, including
 
✓ The lack of high-quality human cells available for testing: Human 
cells are hard to come by for research purposes; you can’t just ask 
the barista at your local coffee shop to donate brain or heart cells, for 
example. Cells gathered after a person’s death often aren’t normal, 
especially if the person died of disease, and, even if the cells are normal, 
there usually aren’t enough of them to test a lot of different drugs. With 
stem cells, scientists can explore the normal development and functions 
of cells and tissues and use genetic manipulation techniques to find out 
what goes wrong in different diseases. This is why embryonic stem cell 
research and differentiating embryonic stem cells into various types of 
tissue cells is so important.

180
Part III: Discovering How Stem Cells Can Affect the Future
 
✓ Insufficient quantities of human cells to conduct meaningful tests: 
Even when researchers have access to human cells, the quantities 
usually are small, which limits testing capabilities. With stem cells — 
particularly embryonic stem cells (see Chapter 4) and reprogrammed 
stem cells (see Chapter 6) — researchers can grow infinite quantities of 
human cells in order to test a wide spectrum of potential drug 
treatments.
 
✓ Gaps in scientists’ knowledge about how certain diseases develop: For 
some diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and a variety of other neurological 
diseases, researchers don’t know exactly what goes wrong because they 
don’t yet fully understand how the system works. Stem cell research can 
fill in the gaps of what scientists know about normal development, lead-
ing to a better understanding of what goes wrong in specific diseases 
and, ultimately, finding drugs that either alleviate symptoms or treat the 
underlying cause of the symptoms.
Scientists are engaged in intensive research to fill in the gaps in knowledge 
about specific diseases. Alzheimer’s researchers, for example, use stem cells 
to grow brain cells and then genetically modify some of those brain cells so 
that they develop Alzheimer’s. The researchers can use those modified brain 
cells to test specific chemicals (potential drugs) and determine whether 
any of the chemicals show promise of being able to fix what goes wrong in 
Alzheimer’s.
Researchers studying Parkinson’s disease, as well as heart, liver, kidney, 
and several other diseases, are using similar techniques — giving human 
cells the genetic changes that cause specific diseases, as well as using these 
cells to try to generate models for sporadic diseases without making genetic 
changes. Cancer researchers also are interested in adapting these methods 
to study various forms of cancer. (See Chapter 8 for more on using stem cells 
in cancer research.)
 
Using stem cells for disease and drug research isn’t a magic bullet for all that 
ails the human race. However, even if stem cell research only doubled the 
success rate of moving clinical trial drugs to the market — that is, if two out 
of every ten drugs proved to be safe and effective in humans — the benefits 
could be far-reaching for countless millions of people.
At the very least, stem cell research promises to eliminate some of the false 
starts that plague drug development today — without compromising the safe-
guards designed to ensure a drug’s safety and effectiveness. This potential 
is why researchers are eager to take advantage of as many stem cell sources 
as possible in their quest to understand the mechanisms of specific diseases 
and find possible treatments.

to Use Today

D
octors have been taking advantage of stem cells’ 
properties for years, notably to treat leukemia and 
burns. Researchers are testing potential stem cell thera-
pies for other diseases, including spinal cord injury, heart 
disease, and diabetes. The biggest hurdle: coming up with 
treatments that are both safe and effective.
In this part, we look at current treatments and promising 
leads involving stem cells. We explain how transplants 
work and the role stem cells play in those procedures. 
And we explore the concept of banking stem cells for 
future use and explain what you need to know if you’re 
considering banking your own or a loved one’s stem cells.

T
hese types of headlines can be confusing. On one hand, the media 
reports exciting new breakthroughs in stem cell therapies practically 
every day, raising hopes for patients (and their families) with diseases that 
have resisted all other efforts to treat or cure them. On the other hand, just 
try getting access to one of these promising breakthrough treatments. If 
you’re trying to get one of these breakthrough therapies for yourself or a 
loved one, suddenly it seems like no such treatment is available.
Adding to the confusion is the argument — asserted by opponents of human 
embryonic stem research — that adult stem therapies are already being used 
to treat dozens of diseases, so there’s no reason to sacrifice potential human 
lives in the form of blastocysts. (Chapter 15 discusses various views on when 
a developing embryo achieves moral status as a person.) Often, opponents 
of human embryonic stem cell research claim that adult stem therapies have 
been used to treat 65 or 70 different diseases; when the debate gets heated, 
some opponents say such diseases are being “successfully treated” or even, 
sometimes, “cured.”

So what can you believe? And how can you know what’s really a demon-
strated, proven therapy, what’s being tested but hasn’t been proven yet, and 
what’s not being tested at all — either because it isn’t ready to be tested on 
humans or because it has been tested and discarded as unworkable?
Throw in the offshore clinics (clinics that operate outside the United States 
and therefore aren’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration) prom-
ising miracle treatments and the picture just gets more confusing. These 
clinics often point to the existence of early stage-clinical trials as proof that 
their therapies work. But clinical trials, particularly in the early stages (see 
Chapter 11) are just tests of possible therapies; by definition, treatments in 
clinical trials are experimental, and the fact that they’re being tested doesn’t 
mean they work.
In this chapter, we clear away some of the fog surrounding proven therapies, 
promising therapies, and therapies that are, at present, more or less theoreti-
cal. We also help you understand the challenges of clinical trials and why it’s 
so hard to get access to experimental treatments outside formal trials.
Looking at Treatments 
That Work Well Now
For the most part, stem cell treatments that work well — and by “work well,” 
we mean treatments where there’s enough evidence to conclude, with a high 
degree of certainty, that the treatment works and the likely benefit to the 
patient exceeds the risk — are limited to diseases involving blood disorders. 
The best-known stem cell treatment, of course, is bone marrow transplanta-
tion, which doctors have used for 40 years to treat leukemia and other dis-
eases of the blood.
The other main area where stem cell-related treatment is known to work is in 
using skin grafts to help heal burns. Unlike bone marrow transplants, though, 
skin grafting works well only with the burn patient’s own skin. Researchers 
haven’t yet found a way to make so-called donor skin consistently compat-
ible with patients’ immune systems for more than a short time, which makes 
treating people with severe burns over a large percentage of their bodies 
exceedingly difficult.
In the following sections, we examine these two proven treatments and why 
they work.

185
 Chapter 12: Where We Are Now: Stem Cell Treatments, Trials, and Possibilities
Using bone marrow transplants in leukemia
In leukemia, some cells in the blood-forming system go off the rails and start 
dividing out of control — not necessarily faster than normal, but outside the 
normal controls so that your body makes many more of them than it should. 
As the disease gets worse, these out-of-control cells start invading and dis-
rupting the functions of other tissues, including production of normal blood, 
in a process called metastasis (see Chapter 8).
Bone marrow transplants often work well in treating leukemia, but the proce-
dure is pretty tough on the patient. Doctors use chemotherapy or radiation, 
or both, to kill off as many dividing leukemia cells as possible. (The treatment 
also kills off other normal cells, so there are lots of side effects.) Then, doc-
tors perform a bone marrow transplant or use something called mobilized 
blood, which has been enriched with blood-forming stem cells and is injected 
into the patient. When you can find a good donor match, this treatment is 
often almost (but not always) curative.
 
Bone marrow transplants work best when the donor is not an identical genetic 
match to the patient (such as an identical twin or the patient’s own cells). If 
you use the patient’s own cells, you risk giving the patient leukemia again. And 
donated cells from an identical twin don’t provide the same benefit as cells 
from an independent donor. When there’s a slight genetic difference between 
donor and patient, the immune system in the donor’s cells recognizes the 
patient’s cells and tissues as foreign and attacks them; this phenomenon is 
called graft-versus-host disease. That disease sounds like it must always be a 
bad thing, and, in fact, it can be deadly when it isn’t controlled. But as long 
as the graft-versus-host activity is limited (so that it doesn’t overwhelm the 
patient’s body), it’s actually quite helpful in mopping up the last few bits of 
cancer cells left over from chemo and radiation therapy.
 
Another major problem with standard leukemia therapy is finding a suit-
able donor. Overall, experts estimate that as many as one-half or more of 
the people who need bone marrow transplants can’t find appropriately 
matched donors. Those numbers are higher for certain ethnic groups; African-
Americans in particular face a severe shortage of donors.
Some researchers are testing the use of stem cells from umbilical cord blood 
to treat leukemia, but at present no one knows for sure under what condi-
tions it will work. One concern is that you may not get enough blood-forming 
stem cells from a single cord to treat an adult, depending on how advanced 
the disease is. Another concern is that cord blood doesn’t generate as much 
graft-versus-host activity because cord blood has a lower ratio of immune 
cells. Nonetheless, using cord blood to treat certain childhood leukemias has 
lots of potential — if the cord blood is free of cancer cells and other prob-
lems. Researchers also are actively working on generating blood and immune 
system stem cells from human embryonic stem cells to create appropriate 
donor cells when needed.

186
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
Grafting skin to treat burns
In mild burns, some skin stem cells survive and can generate new tissue, so 
the burn heals. This process may take quite a bit of time, and the patient may 
end up with some scarring, but generally skin regenerates quite nicely in mild 
burns.
Severe burns kill off stem cells in the skin, which is why severe burns don’t 
heal or heal only very slowly. If you can take skin from another, undamaged 
part of the body and graft it to the burn, the technique works pretty well 
despite the potential for significant scarring. Over time, the stem cells in the 
grafted skin will regenerate tissue over the burn site.
The problem arises when a patient has severe burns over a large percentage 
of his body. In those cases, the patient often doesn’t have enough undamaged 
skin to use for grafts. And, even when undamaged skin is available, grafting 
is a long and often painful process. If you take a layer of skin from the thigh 
to treat part of a large burn, for example, you may have to wait several weeks 
for new graftable skin to grow back so that you can treat the rest of the burn. 
During this time, the patient is highly vulnerable to infection and dehydration 
because the skin, which acts as a natural barrier to keep water in the body 
and harmful invaders out, is absent or severely compromised.
 
Although doctors often use skin from cadavers, or even animals, as a tempo-
rary covering for severe burns, it just isn’t possible — at least with today’s 
medical tools — to permanently treat burns with anything other than the 
patient’s own skin. Grafts from other donors, whether human or animal, die 
within a few weeks, leaving the injured site unprotected. Only autologous 
(meaning “self”) skin grafts work to actually heal burns or other severe skin 
injuries. (The exception is skin from an identical twin, whose genetic makeup 
is the same as the patient’s.)
Because of the unique challenges of skin grafts, researchers are interested in 
figuring out how to grow skin in the lab for transplants. They face some tech-
nical issues, including
 
✓ Time: As you know if you’ve ever had a serious cut, or even a mild burn, 
new skin takes time to grow. Burn patients are often critically ill, and, 
because temporary coverings from cadavers or animals don’t last very 
long, the challenge is generating enough useful skin within a timeframe 
that helps the patient.
 
✓ Thickness: Most burn patients who need skin grafts need more than 
just the outer layer of skin; they need the foundation layers, too. And 
thicker grafts seem to heal the burn site better than thinner ones. But 
it’s unclear whether you can grow sheets of skin in the lab that are thick 
enough to be useful in grafting.

187
 Chapter 12: Where We Are Now: Stem Cell Treatments, Trials, and Possibilities
Research in this area is proceeding using both skin stem cells and embryonic 
stem cells, and the hope is that, eventually, scientists will come up with a 
way to grow enough skin in the lab to help people with severe burns.
Assessing Treatments 
Currently Being Tested
A lot of good research is going on with adult stem cells, and many research-
ers are testing therapies developed from them. As of this writing, a check 
of www.clinicaltrials.gov, a registry of nearly all clinical trials going 
on around the world, returns more than 2,500 trials with stem cells. A large 
fraction of those trials are for experimental treatments to test adult stem cell-
related therapies for a variety of conditions, which would seem to support 
the claims of embryonic stem cell research opponents.
 
But if you look more closely, you see that, of those 2,500 trials, almost 1,000 
are for leukemia, and about 1,800 are for cancer in general. More than 100 are 
for heart conditions, but only a dozen or so are for spinal cord injury, and 
another dozen or so are for multiple sclerosis. There just isn’t a lot of activity 
with adult stem cells when it comes to conducting clinical trials in humans for 
a broad range of other diseases or health conditions.
Some of these trials appear promising, but, in many cases, formal testing in 
humans is just beginning — meaning any of these potential treatments may 
yet prove to be unsafe, ineffective, or both.
In the following sections, we break down some potential treatments that are 
being tested for common diseases: various forms of cancer, heart disease, 
multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and lupus.
Going after other cancers
For 40 years, scientists have been trying to win the war on cancer, and 
they’ve had some success. Survival rates have improved dramatically for 
many types of cancer, in part because diagnostic techniques have improved, 
allowing more cancers to be identified in earlier, more treatable stages. But 
as many as four of every ten people still will be diagnosed with some form 
of cancer at some point in their lives, and, in the United States, half a million 
people still die of cancer every year. (See Chapter 8 for more on cancer.)

188
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
With those kinds of statistics, it’s not surprising that lots of researchers are 
investigating using blood-forming stem cell transplants for a variety of can-
cers, including lymphoma and breast cancer. The theory is that, because 
bone marrow transplants work pretty well in treating leukemia, a similar 
kind of treatment may work for other cancers. (Finding participants for clini-
cal trials poses a unique challenge for cancer researchers, though; see the 
nearby sidebar, “Why cancer clinical trials are so difficult.”)
The scenario, regardless of the type of cancer being targeted, is usually the 
same: Expose the patient to high doses of radiation, followed by high doses 
of chemotherapy, to kill as many cancer cells as possible — which simultane-
ously kills all the normal cells in the blood-forming and immune system, so 
the patient will die unless you inject new blood-forming and immune stem 
cells. Many researchers are exploring using stem cells from the patient to 
avoid the need for powerful and potentially dangerous immune-suppressing 
drugs. The challenge is making sure that the patient’s stem cells aren’t con-
taminated with cancer cells so you don’t reintroduce the cancer.
Interestingly, this sort of therapy has been tried before in breast cancer 
patients. Some doctors did it as a medical innovation — that is, an attempt 
to improve a specific patient’s health, rather than to determine whether the 
treatment was safe and effective for large numbers of patients. As more doc-
tors tried the therapy, more patients demanded it, and they put pressure on 
health insurers to pay for it. But when unbiased, well-controlled clinical trials 
were finally done to see whether the therapy was safe and effective, research-
ers discovered it didn’t really work as well as everyone thought.
 
This false positive is one of the problems with experimental treatments and 
patient testimonials that aren’t backed up by hard clinical data. When people 
are convinced a therapy works, even if no real evidence shows that it works, 
they’ll demand access to the therapy. If they can’t get that access at home, 
they may head overseas — and, unfortunately, plenty of clinics around the 
world operate with little or no regulatory control or oversight, so they can 
claim pretty much whatever they want to (the modern equivalent of snake 
oil, in many cases) in their attempts to get desperate, paying patients through 
their doors.
 
Claims that patients with other forms of cancer (not just blood- or immune-
system cancers) are being treated with stem cell therapies are true in a sense; 
after all, clinical trials are all about testing experimental treatments. But just 
because people are receiving a treatment doesn’t mean it works. If the treat-
ment is administered in a clinical trial, it’s being tested; if it’s administered 
outside a clinical trial and hasn’t been proven, you really can’t expect it to 
work. Clinics that claim to offer treatments are indeed providing their patients 
with something, but unless the treatment has been through clinical trials, 
there’s virtually no way to tell whether the treatment is either safe or effective. 
Patients should be wary of stem cell “treatments” offered by unregulated clin-
ics operating outside the law or in countries with lax regulation.

189
 Chapter 12: Where We Are Now: Stem Cell Treatments, Trials, and Possibilities
Keeping heart disease at bay
Heart disease is another area where researchers are very interested in 
exploring potential stem cell therapies. Treatments that are being tested 
now use several types of stem cells — from the blood-forming system, from 
the heart itself, and from skeletal muscles, among other sources. Most cur-
rent trials involve introducing stem cells into the heart to try to generate 
new heart muscle cells or arteries. The delivery methods are being tested 
as much as the treatment’s safety and effectiveness because, in most cases, 
researchers don’t know which delivery techniques are best.
The early data on many of these therapies is at least somewhat promising. 
Animal studies have suggested that some of these therapies may work in 
humans, and the results of well-constructed early clinical trials in humans 
show a little improvement in some patients. Most of the current trials are in 
Phase I or Phase II. (See Chapter 11 for more on clinical trial phases.)
Why cancer clinical trials are so difficult
When President Richard Nixon signed the 
National Cancer Act in 1971, the goal was to make 
“the conquest of cancer a national crusade.” 
Nearly 40 years later, though, cancer, in all its 
varied forms, remains an all-too-common — 
and all-too-deadly — disease. One of the many 
things standing in the way of big breakthroughs 
in cancer treatments is the lack of participants 
in clinical trials. According to one review of 
cancer clinical trials sponsored by the National 
Cancer Institute, at least 20 percent of trials fail 
to enroll a single patient, and 50 percent never 
enroll enough patients to get meaningful results 
from the testing.
Several obstacles affect participation in cancer 
clinical trials. For one thing, doctors are poorly 
compensated for enrolling patients and admin-
istering trial treatments. For another, cancer 
patients — already wrestling with a life-chang-
ing diagnosis and trying to sort through an 
often confusing array of treatment options — 
are seldom interested in participating in a trial 
where they may not receive the treatment 
being tested. (See Chapter 11 for more on how 
clinical trials are conducted.) The people most 
likely to participate in clinical trials for cancer 
treatments are those whose disease has pro-
gressed beyond the point where tried-and-
tested treatments can help. Even so, concerns 
about expenses, inconvenience, and uncer-
tainty about actual treatment keeps many 
patients away from clinical trials.
Some researchers are trying to find ways 
to use the limited pool of cancer volunteers 
more effectively to get the clinical data they 
need. One trial of a new breast cancer drug 
that began in the fall of 2009, for example, was 
designed to get strong data from a pool of just 
300 participants. Instead of surgically remov-
ing the tumor and then treating the patients 
with drugs, the participants took chemotherapy 
and experimental drugs for six months to see 
whether cells in the tumors would respond at all 
to the drug being tested. This approach shaves 
years off the trial because, when the tumor is 
removed first, it can take five to ten years to find 
out whether the cells derived from the tumor 
are sensitive to the drug being tested.

190
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
 
The positive results from early trials mean these therapies are worth testing 
further, and many rigorous, well-designed clinical trials are under way to see 
whether those positive results hold up in larger samples. It’s entirely possible 
that good, solid treatments may emerge from these trials, but it’s far too early 
to say that these treatments are safe and effective.
Treating multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune 
system attacks the myelin sheaths that insulate nerve cells. Myelin facilitates 
communication among nerve cells; when it’s damaged or destroyed, patients 
lose muscle control and can suffer a range of physical and cognitive disabili-
ties. In its early stages, and for most patients, MS is fairly well controlled with 
drugs. But MS is a progressive disease, meaning it gets worse over time, and 
drugs eventually lose their effectiveness.
Researchers have already done a lot of work with transplants of blood- and 
immune-forming stem cells to treat MS. The idea is to get rid of the sick 
immune system and reconstitute it from scratch with the foundational stem 
cells of the body’s blood-forming and immune systems. This approach has 
worked moderately well, but the side effects are sometimes very serious. As 
in bone marrow transplants for leukemia, the traditional way to replace an 
immune system in MS is to first attack the problem with enormous amounts 
of chemotherapy, which also affects healthy cells and tissues.
Most of the trials involving blood stem cell transplants have been Phase I and 
Phase II; so far, no one has done a rigorous Phase III study. The mortality rate 
associated with these transplants is around 3.5 percent; that number may 
seem low, but if you deliver this treatment to, say, 100,000 people, 3,500 of 
them may die from it.
Recently, some researchers have tried blood stem cell transplants with lower 
doses of chemotherapy, and Phase I trials suggest that patients may do 
better. But this adaptation poses some challenges of its own. First, for lower-
dose chemo to be effective, you have to administer it earlier in the disease’s 
progression. But patients in the early stages of MS tend to do okay with 
established drug therapies, so convincing patients to choose a more invasive 
treatment may be difficult. On the other hand, if you wait to do the transplant 
until the disease has progressed further, you probably need the higher, more 
toxic doses of chemo, which means more risk to the patient.
A recent experiment using moderate-dose chemotherapy before the trans-
plant seemed to be effective in patients who weren’t responding well to tradi-
tional treatment. But it’s still too early to say definitively that this alternative 
is safe and effective. As in so many diseases, the only way to answer those 
questions is with clinical trials.

191
 Chapter 12: Where We Are Now: Stem Cell Treatments, Trials, and Possibilities
Easing the effects of Type 1 diabetes
Sometimes treatments that fail in one incarnation can be successful with a 
certain amount of adjusting and tweaking. Such may be the case in one kind 
of treatment for Type 1 diabetes.
Better known as juvenile diabetes, Type 1 is an autoimmune disease; the 
immune system attacks and kills the beta cells in the pancreas that produce 
insulin. (In Type 2 diabetes, sometimes called adult-onset diabetes, the pan-
creas often continues to produce insulin, but the body doesn’t use it effi-
ciently.) People with Type 1 diabetes are dependent on insulin injections and 
often suffer severe complications, ranging from loss of vision to kidney failure.
In the 1970s, some researchers speculated that the disease could be cured 
with transplants of pancreatic islets, the areas of the pancreas in which beta 
cells live. But more than 400 transplants failed, and most researchers decided 
the idea was unworkable.
In the 1990s, researchers in Canada revived the idea and set about figuring 
out why earlier transplants didn’t work. They decided that there were two 
problems with the original protocol: Surgeons didn’t use enough islets, and 
the drugs designed to keep the patient’s body from rejecting the transplant 
were too weak.
In the late 1990s, these researchers developed a procedure called the 
Edmonton protocol, which uses a whole bunch of islets from cadavers and 
a novel combination of immune-suppression drugs. Since 1999, more than 
150 patients have undergone the Edmonton protocol transplant, largely suc-
cessfully. The biggest challenge appears to be getting enough genetically 
compatible islets; in the United States, there are only about 8,000 to 10,000 
organ donors every year, and only about 40 percent of those are suitable islet 
donors. The Edmonton protocol requires two pancreases per transplant to 
harvest enough islets, so only about 1,000 to 2,000 patients could receive the 
treatment in a given year.
Controlling the immune system presents another challenge for the Edmonton 
protocol (as well as for most other transplant operations). Drugs that sup-
press the immune system can be detrimental to a patient’s health over the 
long term. And even in spite of long-term immune suppression, many patients 
eventually reject the transplanted islets, and their disease worsens again.
 
Every year, 15,000 children are newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. As it’s 
done today, islet transplantation can help, at most, about 1 in 5 or 1 in 10 of 
those children (and even then, the help is probably only temporary) — assum-
ing all donor pancreases were used for these new cases. Scientists are working 
on generating beta cells from stem cells, which would eliminate, or at least 
reduce, the need for cadaver pancreases.

192
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
Scientists also are just beginning to address another important issue: Some 
cells, including beta cells, must function in precisely regulated ways. Creating 
insulin-secreting cells from stem cells isn’t enough; the insulin-secreting cells 
also have to respond in just the right ways to the signals within the body, 
such as blood sugar (glucose) levels, that regulate the release of insulin.
This problem of getting lab-generated cells to respond to signals the way 
they’re supposed to is quite complex. Normally, the body sends signals that 
induce cells to generate the circuitry they need in order to respond to vari-
ous complicated physiological processes. So scientists need to create cells 
that can recognize those circuitry-building signals, either by duplicating in 
the lab the signals the body would send out or by putting the cells into the 
body and hoping the cells behave the way they’re supposed to.
So far, researchers have found that generating insulin-secreting cells in the 
last is much more straightforward than making sure those cells correctly 
receive and interpret the signals that tell them when to release insulin and 
how much to release.
In addition, as with all efforts to generate specific cells from stem cells, 
researchers have to figure out how to make sure that the generated cells 
follow their prescribed functions and are free from any kind of contaminants 
before they can be tested.
Another approach involves variations on autologous bone marrow and blood 
tissue transplants, which may help preserve some insulin-producing function 
by resetting the immune system so that it stops attacking the beta cells before 
it kills all of them. This procedure has been tried in some small trials with 
promising results in a small number of patients, but it isn’t yet clear whether 
the benefits would outweigh the risks. To know for sure whether these treat-
ments would be safe and effective for large numbers of diabetes patients, 
researchers need to conduct more clinical trials with more participants.
Attacking lupus
On the television show House M.D., lupus is something of a running gag: 
Whenever a patient shows up with weird symptoms, the doctors have to rule 
out lupus as the cause. But for more than 1 million Americans, lupus is no 
laughing matter. It’s a chronic inflammatory disease that attacks the body’s 
tissues — another case of the immune system run amok. Eventually, lupus 
can lead to organ failure, typically in the kidneys, heart, or lungs.
Experimental stem cell treatments for lupus are similar to what’s being done 
in multiple sclerosis and diabetes: transplants that aim to reconstitute the 
immune system or replace key cells that are damaged or killed in the disease.
Early clinical trials have had promising results. But, again, only additional 
controlled testing can determine whether the treatment really works safely.

193
 Chapter 12: Where We Are Now: Stem Cell Treatments, Trials, and Possibilities
Investigating Promising Leads
For several diseases and debilitating conditions, scientists have strong 
theories — and, in some cases, even encouraging anecdotal evidence — 
about how stem cells can ease symptoms, improve health, and perhaps 
even resolve the root problem.
 
For Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and a few other diseases, stem cell researchers 
are working hard to discover potential therapies that can slow down or halt 
the disease’s progression. As of this writing, a few trials are being conducted 
around the world, but our focus in this chapter is on trials where the scien-
tific evidence is strongly supportive of the therapies being tested. Read more 
about work on Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other neurodegenerative dis-
eases in Chapter 9.
Of course, some clinics (mainly outside the United States) claim all kinds of 
wild things. If you do a Google search for “stem cell treatments,” the ads on 
the right side of the results page fairly scream about alleged cures for every-
thing from aging to late-stage cancer. But anyone who wants to spend the 
money can buy an ad on Google. Real scientists have to be able to prove their 
claims.
Two of the most promising areas of stem cell research are in treating spinal 
cord injuries and a devastating childhood illness called Batten Disease. We 
cover each in the following sections.
Improving function in patients 
with spinal cord injury
If you never saw one of Christopher Reeve’s poignant pleas for furthering 
embryonic stem cell research, you just weren’t paying attention. After the 
star of the 1978 movie version of Superman was paralyzed in a horseback-
riding accident in 1995, Reeve became a visible and vocal champion of 
research into spinal cord injuries and regularly pushed Congress to permit 
human embryonic stem cell research to proceed with minimal restrictions.
An estimated 250,000 Americans live with spinal cord injuries, and some 
11,000 people suffer spinal cord injuries each year. The most common causes 
are car accidents and acts of violence, usually involving gunshot or knife 
wounds. For senior citizens, spinal cord injuries are usually caused by a fall.
Treatment options for spinal cord injuries are much better than they used 
to be, but they’re still pretty limited. Sometimes steroids can reduce nerve 
damage and inflammation around the injury site, but only if they’re adminis-
tered within a few hours of the initial injury. Surgery can stabilize the spine to 

194
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
prevent further injury, and traction can bring the spine back into alignment. 
But, most often, treatment focuses on minimizing complications, such as 
breathing issues and infections, and teaching the patient ways to adapt to his 
new disability.
Prognosis is difficult, too. According to the Mayo Clinic, if a patient recovers 
from a spinal cord injury, the recovery usually begins in the six months after 
the injury; any impairment that’s still present after one to two years is likely 
to be permanent in most cases.
 
Spinal cord injuries are so devastating because, even though the injury rarely 
actually severs the spinal cord, some nerve fibers are severed. The injury 
prompts an inflammatory attack — a common immune system response — 
that strips nerve cells of their myelin. Researchers have reported some pretty 
strong evidence that restoring the myelin may improve mobility in many — 
maybe even most — people with spinal cord injuries.
For the first time in the United States, a company is preparing to test a ther-
apy in human clinical trials using human embryonic stem cells. Biotech com-
pany Geron, working with researchers at the University of California–Irvine, 
received approval in 2009 to begin clinical trials to test a special type of cell 
that’s designed to stimulate the production and repair of myelin in spinal 
cord injuries. (The trials were scheduled to begin in 2009 but were put on 
hold while researchers collected and analyzed more information from animal 
experiments.) Although much of Geron’s work hasn’t been made public 
because the company is pursuing Food and Drug Administration approval of 
its cell therapy (assuming that it works), what is known about the potential 
treatment is intriguing.
 
Geron is using human embryonic stem cells to make oligodendrocytes, a spe-
cial kind of cell in the nervous system that produces myelin, which insulates 
nerve fibers. The company conducted many studies in animals to make sure 
that these lab-grown cells remain oligodendrocytes in living organisms, that 
they produce myelin and insulate nerve fibers in rats with spinal cord injuries, 
and that they don’t become cancerous when they’re injected into a host body.
The results of the animal studies have been encouraging, and stem cell 
researchers (as well as people affected by spinal cord injury) hope the delay 
in starting clinical trials is temporary. The first phase of trials will involve 
only a handful of patients and will be designed mainly to test the safety of the 
transplanted cells, so researchers will be looking more for adverse events 
that can indicate problems with the treatment than for improvements in 
participants’ symptoms. If the Phase I trials go forward to Phase II and are 
successful, the treatment will be expanded to a few hundred patients, and, if 
those trials are successful, Geron will move to Phase III trials to evaluate the 
treatment in a large, diverse sample population.

195
 Chapter 12: Where We Are Now: Stem Cell Treatments, Trials, and Possibilities
 
Geron’s experimental treatment has to be administered in the early stage of 
the injury; there seems to be a limited window of opportunity for repairing 
myelin damage after a spinal cord injury. Some injuries repair themselves 
spontaneously — that is, regardless of any medical therapy — as much as two 
years or more after the initial injury, but that’s pretty rare; most spontaneous 
recovery happens within the first several months after the injury. So one issue 
about administering Geron’s treatment within a few months of an injury is fig-
uring out whether the transplanted cells induced any improvement in the 
patient’s condition or whether the patient’s body healed itself. Geron claims it 
can classify injuries to determine which ones are likely to recover on their 
own and weed out people who have those kinds of injuries. In any case, it may 
be several years before any definitive results come from the Geron trials.
Finding a treatment for Batten Disease
Batten Disease is a lysosomal storage disease. Lysosomes are enzyme-filled 
containers that live in the cytoplasm of cells and function as a combination 
of storage closet, wastebasket, and garbage disposal; they absorb, digest, 
and discard excess materials that the cell doesn’t need. In lysosomal storage 
diseases, the enzymes are defective or missing. Some of these diseases can 
be treated by injecting the patient — who is usually a child, because these 
diseases are genetic and manifest themselves early in life — with the missing 
enzymes, which the body’s cells pick up and use.
But in some of these diseases, the enzymes can’t get past the blood brain 
barrier, a structure that restricts the brain’s absorption of certain elements 
from the blood supply. Oxygen and other essential nutrients pass through 
the blood brain barrier easily, but certain enzymes — including the ones 
involved in Batten Disease — are denied entry into the brain. As a result, the 
enzymes can’t rescue brain cells, and the brain cells begin malfunctioning 
because they can’t digest excess fats and proteins.
There’s no cure for Batten. As the disease progresses, the child loses sight 
and motor skills, suffers ever-worsening seizures or convulsions, and eventu-
ally becomes blind, demented, and bedridden. Some patients die in their late 
teens or early 20s, but many die at much younger ages.
Researchers are experimenting with providing the missing enzymes by inject-
ing fetal neural stem cells directly into the brains of children with Batten 
Disease. The idea is that those stem cells will survive in the brain and pro-
vide the missing enzyme, which other brain cells can then take up and use. 
(Chapter 2 explains how cells exchange materials like enzymes.) The poten-
tial treatment has worked well in animals, and it’s in clinical trials for humans 
now. As of July 2009, results of early trials indicated the treatment is safe and 
well-tolerated; whether it works in humans as well as it does in animals will, if 
all goes well, be tested in further trials.

196

Exploring the Human Potential 
in Animal Treatments
Most reliable medical treatments are first tested extensively in animals — 
usually mice or rats. But sometimes treatments that work in other animals, 
such as dogs or horses, may translate to therapies for humans.
One intriguing instance is a stem cell treatment that veterinarians use to treat 
arthritis and other joint problems in dogs and horses. This treatment uses 
mesenchymal stem cells from fat tissue. Their normal job is to make cartilage 
and connective tissue, such as tendons and ligaments. Vets inject them into 
affected joints, and some interesting anecdotal evidence indicates that the 
treatment works well — at least in dogs and horses.
Clinical data on these treatments is harder to come by. However, a few 
small studies indicate that the treatment makes a real, observable differ-
ence in horses and dogs with joint problems, and those findings have helped 
spark interest in adapting the therapy to treat osteoarthritis in humans. 
(Osteoarthritis is caused by a breakdown of cartilage in joints; rheumatoid 
arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which chronic inflammation attacks 
joints, tissues, and organs.)
 
Just because a treatment works well in animals doesn’t mean it’ll work in 
humans. That’s why Phase I clinical trials focus more on the safety, rather 
than the efficacy, of the treatment. Lots of potential treatments never make 
it out of Phase I trials because they turn out to be much more dangerous in 
humans than they are in animals.
An informative example of this problem comes from studies of Parkinson’s 
disease in mice. Researchers treated Parkinson’s-afflicted mice with a 
growth factor called GDNF, and it seemed to be very effective — effective 
enough that these experiments generated a great deal excitement about 
translating the therapy into a treatment for Parkinson’s in human beings. 
Scientists did everything they needed to do to get this potential treatment 
ready for clinical trials. But when they began testing GDNF on humans, the 
results were disappointing.
Some scientists think GDNF didn’t work in humans because the human brain 
is much bigger than the mouse brain, so it’s harder for the GDNF to get from 
the injection site to the region of the brain that’s affected by Parkinson’s 
(see Chapter 9). Thus, even differences in size between animals and humans 
(along with other factors, of course) can lead to very different outcomes 
when you’re testing potential treatments.

197
 Chapter 12: Where We Are Now: Stem Cell Treatments, Trials, and Possibilities
Understanding the Challenges of Clinical 
Trials and Experimental Treatments
If you’ve read the rest of this chapter, you’ve gathered by now that we’re 
leery of individual experimental treatments and prefer the harder data gen-
erated by well-designed clinical trials. It’s not that we’re unsympathetic to 
people who are desperate for relief from their symptoms or illnesses. We’re 
not even opposed to doctors using their best judgment in deciding whether 
to try innovative and untested treatments for specific patients.
However, we are opposed to clinics that make fantastical claims with little 
or no basis in sound scientific research. In our opinion, the people who run 
these clinics prey on the ill at their most vulnerable; their intentions may 
be good, but we suspect that their prime motivator often is financial profit. 
We feel so strongly about this concern that we devote a chapter in this book 
(Chapter 21) to the things you need to do before you consider seeking any 
kind of “new” stem cell treatment.
 
Clinical trials aren’t perfect. Even if people in early trials received the treat-
ment and got better, it doesn’t prove the treatment is either safe or effective. 
Especially when it comes to stem cell therapies for diseases outside the blood 
and immune systems, no one knows the long-term effects of introducing stem 
cells — especially stem cells from an independent donor — into the human 
body. And there are so many variables in how diseases progress and present 
themselves that it’s virtually impossible to draw any firm conclusions from the 
results of trials that involve only a few, or even a few hundred, patients.
To be sure that a treatment will be safe and effective for large numbers of 
people, you have to conduct double-blind clinical trials (see Chapter 11) with 
large numbers of participants.
Understanding safety issues
Several safety issues arise in any sort of stem cell trial. The first question is 
whether the stem cells are purified and free of any type of contamination, 
such as cancer cells, viruses, bacteria, unwanted animal products, and any-
thing else that could be transmitted to the patient. In the United States, purifi-
cation is tightly controlled; the companies that sell stem cells to researchers 
and clinicians label their products to note whether they’re for research only, 
safe for use in animals but not humans, or safe for use in humans. In some 
other countries, regulatory controls are weak (if they exist at all), and cases 
of therapy providers using the wrong grade of stem cells have been reported.

198
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
The second safety issue is whether stem cells stay where you put them. In 
bone marrow transplants, a lot of evidence suggests that blood-forming and 
immune system stem cells go to the right places in the body and do their 
jobs. But researchers know much less about other kinds of stem cells, so 
they don’t know for certain whether cardiac stem cells will stay put in the 
heart, for example, or whether they’ll wander off and form colonies in, say, 
the liver.
Figuring out where to put stem cells and how to deliver them is another open 
question. Cells that are nontoxic in their own environments — brain cells in 
the brain, mesenchymal cells in fat tissue, and so on — may well wreak havoc 
if you put them somewhere else. And while it makes sense to inject blood-
forming stem cells into a vein, devising a safe delivery method for other kinds 
of stem cells is more challenging; you probably don’t want to inject liver stem 
cells into the circulatory system and just trust that they’ll find their way to 
the liver, for example.
Finally, time is a safety issue. Clinical trials typically last only a few months in 
the early stages and only a few years in later phases. But transplanted stem 
cells may stay in your body for the rest of your life, replicating themselves 
and giving rise to other cells. No one knows whether stem cells that seem to 
be safe and effective over a span of a few years will continue to be safe 10, 20, 
or 30 years on.
Racing the clock
If you have a terminal illness, you may (quite naturally) feel that you don’t 
have time to wait for clinical trials to establish a treatment’s safety and effec-
tiveness. Some terminally ill patients argue that they have nothing to lose 
even if the treatment proves to be dangerous or ineffective. This sense of 
urgency is one reason people often seek treatment overseas; they’re under-
standably frustrated with the slow pace of testing and approval in highly 
regulated countries like the United States.
Patients and their advocates sometimes press for access to experimental 
treatments that may not even have begun clinical trials, which poses some 
ethical and practical problems. From an ethics standpoint, performing experi-
ments on people when not even good animal data supports the treatment is 
problematic. And if the current standard treatments are relatively good, the 
risks of experimental treatments tend to carry more weight than the possible 
benefits.
From a practical standpoint, open access to experimental treatments can 
severely curtail the usefulness of clinical trials. For one thing, if patients can 
get experimental treatments without enrolling in a clinical trial, participation 

199
 Chapter 12: Where We Are Now: Stem Cell Treatments, Trials, and Possibilities
in trials likely will drop sharply — making good data even harder to come 
by. (Cancer trials already have a tough time attracting participants, which 
has hindered research; see the sidebar earlier in this chapter.) Without con-
trolled clinical trials, you never get the data that shows whether a treatment 
works or whether it’s reasonably safe.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is good example of a promising treat-
ment that didn’t turn out to be unqualifiedly wonderful. Most people thought 
giving women supplemental estrogren was a safe and effective way to ease 
the symptoms of menopause — even though HRT hadn’t been tested in clini-
cal trials. Millions of menopausal women took estrogen as a matter of course. 
Then evidence began to emerge that HRT wasn’t as safe and simple as every-
one thought. In fact, in some women, HRT actually increases risks of certain 
types of cancer and other diseases.
There are business considerations, too. If you’re running a biotech company 
and you’ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars to do research, animal 
testing, and clinical trials for a certain treatment, you have a very strong 
disincentive against giving your experimental treatment out for people to 
take willy-nilly. For one thing, if anything bad happens to a patient taking 
your treatment, whether it’s related to the treatment or not, you may have to 
report it to the FDA as an adverse event. The more adverse events there are, 
the less likely the FDA is to approve a treatment for marketing — or even for 
additional trials.
If you’re a cynic, you may say that all these caveats are just excuses for busi-
nesses that want to suppress negative information. And, in a sense, that’s 
partly true. But it’s also economic reality. According to Pharmaceutical 
Researchers and Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group, it costs 
more than $800 million to escort a drug from research and animal testing to 
clinical trials and finally to market. If you invested that kind of money and 12 
to 15 years in research and development, wouldn’t you do everything you 
could to protect your investment? Promising therapies have been pulled 
from human clinical trials because of adverse events involving poorly super-
vised use of the treatment, so the companies footing the bills have a tremen-
dous stake in making sure that their treatments are used the way they’re 
intended in the types of patients they’re intended to help.
 
The goal of clinical research is to find out what’s really going on in a disease 
and the treatment being tested, not necessarily to make a specific patient 
better. Doctors often use medical innovations — in essence, trying experimen-
tal approaches — in individual cases; their goal is to make their patient better, 
not to further the bounds of general scientific knowledge.

Understanding the Role of Stem 
Cells in Transplants
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing why transplants of blood-forming stem cells work
▶ Identifying various sources of transplantable stem cells
▶ Going through the steps of a transplant
▶ Becoming a registered donor
W
hen vital organs like the heart, kidneys, liver, or lungs are damaged 
beyond repair, or when a genetic issue causes the organ to degen-
erate and eventually fail, transplant is often the only remaining option for 
saving the patient’s life. For the past 40 years, bone marrow transplants have 
been some of the most successful transplant procedures, in part because of 
the nature of the stem cells in bone marrow and in part because the ongoing 
study of the transplants and transplant recipients themselves have revealed 
much about how the body’s immune system works.
In this chapter, we focus on bone marrow transplants because it’s the one 
area where research and medicine have already found stem cells to be partic-
ularly useful. In fact, these transplants are so useful in reforming the body’s 
blood and immune systems that researchers and physicians are testing these 
transplants as treatments for diseases beyond those that affect the blood. 
Some researchers are even pursuing the possibility of performing transplants 
of an organ along with matched blood- and immune-forming stem cells from 
the same donor; the idea is that adding stem cells to an organ transplant 
could lower the risk of the recipient’s body rejecting the organ (although that 
research is in quite early stages).
In this chapter, we take you through bone marrow transplants step by step. 
We look at when transplants are appropriate and when they’re not and exam-
ine the challenges of performing transplants, including finding donors and 
matching them to recipients. We show you how a transplant works from the 
patient’s perspective and how donation works from the donor’s perspective. 
We tell you how to become a donor and cover the general requirements for 

202
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
living and deceased organ and tissue donors. And we discuss the limitations 
of current transplant medicine and how stem cell research and regenerative 
medicine may change everything in the coming years.
Exploring Circumstances When Stem 
Cell Transplant Is Appropriate
Although thousands of organ and bone marrow transplants are performed 
every year in the United States, transplants aren’t always appropriate. In fact, 
many patients are removed from the national transplant waiting lists every 
day because they become too sick to survive the procedure, even if a suit-
able donor is available.
 
In the United States, someone is diagnosed with a blood cancer every four 
minutes. Leukemia and other blood cancers account for almost 10 percent 
of new cancer diagnoses each year, as well as about 10 percent of all cancer 
deaths each year. For many of those newly diagnosed patients, a transplant of 
blood-forming stem cells is their best hope for survival.
Bone marrow transplants seem to work best in younger people, in patients 
whose disease is in its early stages, and in those who haven’t undergone 
much in the way of other treatments. Some transplant centers set age limits, 
requiring people who get a transplant of their own blood-forming stem cells 
to be under 65 (or under 60 in some cases) and setting 50 as the maximum 
age for receiving a stem cell transplant from another donor.
 
In most cases, bone marrow transplants consist of harvesting and transplant-
ing the hematopoietic, or blood-forming, stem cells found in bone marrow. For 
some blood diseases, including certain kinds of leukemia and anemia (lack of 
sufficient red blood cells), hematopoietic stem cell transplants are being used 
as a treatment. For other kinds of blood diseases, transplants are being tested 
to see whether they can serve as treatments there, too. And hematopoietic 
stem cell transplants have been and are currently being tested as a supple-
mental treatment for cancers in solid organs, where the idea is to blast away 
at the cancer with chemotherapy and radiation, and then use the transplant to 
reconstitute the patient’s blood- and immune-forming system — which is often 
severely compromised by the chemotherapy and radiation.

203
 Chapter 13: Understanding the Role of Stem Cells in Transplants
Understanding the Challenges 
in Stem Cell Transplants
Although they’re pretty routine these days, hematopoietic stem cell trans-
plants aren’t necessarily easy to do:
 
1. You have to decide where to get the stem cells — from bone marrow, 
from circulating blood, or from umbilical cord blood.
 
2. You have to find donors.
 
3. You have to match donors to recipients.
 
4. After you’ve found a match, you have to make sure that neither the 
patient’s immune system nor the immune functions in the trans-
planted cells go haywire.
 
5. Finally, you have to minimize the chances of the disease returning 
after the transplant.
The following sections explain these challenges in detail, starting with the 
possible sources of blood-forming stem cells.
Choosing a source of stem cells
Currently, blood- and immune-forming stem cells come from three sources:
 
✓ The most common source is bone marrow, which physicians have trans-
planted successfully for more than 40 years.
 
✓ In recent years, researchers have discovered ways to stimulate produc-
tion of stem cells and subsequent migration from the bone marrow into 
the blood, permitting harvesting from the blood stream.
 
✓ Umbilical cord blood is a rich source of these types of stem cells.
The following sections describe these stem cell sources, and the procedures 
used to harvest them, in more detail.
Collecting stem cells from bone marrow
Bone marrow is the spongy material in the center of your bones. The adult 
body contains two types of bone marrow:
 
✓ Red marrow, where the hematopoietic stem cells live. Red marrow is 
located mainly in the large, flat bones of the body — ribs, skull, shoulder 
blades, breast bone, and hip bones — and at the ends of long bones in 
the arms and legs.

204
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
 
✓ Yellow marrow, which consists mainly of fat cells and resides in the 
middle of the long bones.
In newborns, all bone marrow is red, but, as you age, about half your marrow 
becomes yellow.
 
Believe it or not, your body has a back-up system for making blood and 
immune cells, a process called hematopoiesis (pronounced he-MAT-oh-poe-
EE-sis). When the bone marrow can’t make enough blood cells, the spleen 
and liver step in to pick up the slack and help the bone marrow by produc-
ing blood and immune cells themselves. When blood cell numbers return to 
adequate levels, the spleen and liver stop making new blood and immune cells 
and resume concentrating on their normal functions.
If necessary, your body can also convert yellow marrow back to red marrow 
so that it can create more blood and immune cells. This conversion typically 
happens only when the body experiences severe or sustained blood loss.
In addition, stem cells in red marrow produce all the cell types in the blood:
 
✓ Red blood cells, which distribute oxygen from the lungs and carry 
carbon dioxide and other waste to the lungs for expulsion
 
✓ White blood cells, which form part of your body’s immune system
 
✓ Platelets, which help the blood clot to prevent blood loss
To harvest blood-forming stem cells from bone marrow, the donor usually is 
placed under general anesthesia (fully unconscious), and doctors use a long 
needle to extract marrow from the hip bone (pelvis), which has the most 
red marrow. Depending on the donor’s health and the hospital’s protocols, 
the donor may be released the same day or hospitalized for a day or two 
to ensure proper recovery. Although conventional wisdom holds that this 
process is quite painful for the donor, most donors only experience mild to 
moderate aches in the hip for a few days, or perhaps a couple of weeks, after 
the procedure.
Harvesting stem cells from the bloodstream
Stem cells don’t usually circulate in the bloodstream, but you can coax them 
to do so by giving the donor drugs that prompt the hematopoietic stem cells 
to create more of themselves, and to move from the bone marrow into the 
blood and other blood-forming organs like the spleen. Some researchers 
believe the reason this technique works is because the drugs that prompt the 
stem cells to begin dividing also induce them to move away from the bone 
marrow. Others theorize that space is limited in the niches where blood-
forming stem cells usually live, and when the niches get full, excess stem 
cells are forced into the bloodstream.

205
 Chapter 13: Understanding the Role of Stem Cells in Transplants
Hematopoietic stem cell donation under this technique is similar to donat-
ing blood. Blood is drawn from a vein in the arm and run through a special 
machine that filters out the stem cells in a process called apheresis. The 
remaining blood is returned to the donor’s body. Apheresis takes several 
hours, and the donor may have to do it several days in a row to produce 
enough stem cells for a transplant.
Using stem cells from umbilical cord blood
Cord blood is the other main source of blood-forming stem cells. In the 
uterus, the umbilical cord delivers nutrients from the mother’s body to the 
fetus. After birth, when the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the blood in 
the cord can be drained into a sterile bag or vial, treated with a preservative, 
and frozen for later use.
The main down side to using cord blood is its small volume. Although cord 
blood contains lots of hematopoietic stem cells per milliliter (a milliliter is 
1⁄1,000 of a liter; a teaspoon equals about 5 milliliters), a typical umbilical cord 
contains only about 30 to 100 milliliters of blood. So the blood from a single 
cord may not contain enough stem cells to treat a large adult.
On the other hand, the stem cells in cord blood aren’t as mature as those 
found in adult bone marrow, so they may be able to produce more blood cells. 
Scientists are currently testing whether blood from multiple cords (obviously, 
from multiple babies) can be transplanted into the same patient when the 
blood from a single cord isn’t enough. But, because no one knows for sure 
whether or how well combining blood from multiple cords works, most trans-
plant centers use cord blood stem cells only to treat children or small adults. 
(And using cord blood is still considered an experimental treatment.)
Understanding the pros and cons of each stem cell source
Hematopoietic stem cells harvested from marrow, circulating blood, and 
umbilical cord blood all are injected into the patient’s bloodstream through a 
vein — just as in a blood transfusion — and will find their way to the patient’s 
bone marrow. There, the stem cells settle into their proper niches and begin 
growing to make new, normal blood cells.
Stem cells from bone marrow typically generate new blood cells within two 
to four weeks. Stem cells from circulating blood generate new blood cells 
faster — often within 10 to 20 days. Because of this faster response, and 
because collecting stem cells from the bloodstream or umbilical cord is 
easier on the donor, many transplant centers prefer these methods.

206
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
Another plus to using circulating blood is that the donor can be given more 
growth factors to generate more stem cells if needed. And that’s one of the 
down sides to using cord blood: If the cord blood doesn’t yield enough stem 
cells, you can’t just go back to the donor and get more.
Stem cells from cord blood also take longer to begin generating new blood 
cells, which means the patient is vulnerable to infection for a longer period 
after the transplant.
On the other hand, some studies indicate that cord blood doesn’t have to 
be as closely matched as bone marrow or stem cells from circulating blood, 
which may be helpful for patients with rare tissue or blood types. (See the 
section “Matching donors and recipients,” later in this chapter.)
 
Scientists and physicians know how to generate, extract, filter, and store 
blood-forming stem cells so they remain viable for transplant, but no one yet 
knows how to grow clinically useful amounts of them in the lab. Unlike some 
other types of stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells (at least so far) don’t 
reproduce themselves extensively outside the body — a problem researchers 
are working to resolve.
Finding and matching donors
The biggest challenge for any transplant is finding a suitably matched donor 
because most people aren’t genetically identical. If you put Meg’s kidney into 
Larry’s body, Larry’s immune system would recognize the kidney as foreign and 
attack it. If you put Larry’s immune-forming cells into Meg’s body, on the other 
hand, those cells would view Meg’s tissues as foreign and attack them — a phe-
nomenon called graft-versus-host disease. The more closely matched the donor is 
to the recipient, the less of this immune incompatibility you have, and the less you 
have to do after the transplant to keep either immune system from attacking.
 
In some cases, a little graft-versus-host disease is a good thing because it 
helps destroy any cancer cells or other diseased cells that other treatments 
missed. But the graft-versus-host disease has to be carefully controlled so that 
it doesn’t end up attacking and killing the patient’s healthy cells and tissues.
The following sections explore different donor options, and how donors and 
recipients are matched.
Exploring transplant donor options
Transplanted stem cells can come from three kinds of donors: yourself 
(an autologous transplant), an identical twin (a syngeneic transplant), or 
another person (an allogeneic transplant), such as a brother, sister, or other 

207
 Chapter 13: Understanding the Role of Stem Cells in Transplants
blood relative or, if no family members are a good match, a volunteer from a 
donor registry. Each donor source of transplant cells has its advantages and 
disadvantages.
 
✓ In an autologous (pronounced aw-TALL-uh-gus) transplant, doctors 
harvest stem cells from your blood or bone marrow, treat you with high 
doses of chemotherapy (drugs) or radiation or both, and then inject 
your stem cells back into your bloodstream. The main advantage is that, 
because this method uses your own cells, your immune system won’t 
attack the stem cells, and you don’t have to take powerful immune-
suppressing drugs, which leave you vulnerable to infection. The main 
disadvantage is that some cancer cells may be mixed in with your stem 
cells, so your doctor may try to treat the cells with additional drugs to 
try to kill those residual cancer cells before putting the stem cells back 
in your body. Some scientists are testing purification techniques to elim-
inate unwanted cells, or at least to reduce their numbers to where they 
won’t cause problems.
 
✓ In a syngeneic (pronounced sin-jeh-NAY-ick) transplant, an identi-
cal twin provides the stem cells. Because you and your identical 
twin are a genetic match, this type of transplant avoids rejection and 
other immune-response issues. However, because there is no immune 
response, the transplanted cells don’t perform the same clean-up duties 
that closely matched (but not genetically identical) cells do. (Besides, 
relatively few transplant patients have identical twins.)
 
✓ In an allogeneic (pronounced al-oh-jeh-NAY-ick) transplant, doctors 
look for a close (but not identical) genetic match between you and 
potential donors — who may be related to you or complete strangers. 
(See the following section for more on how doctors find donor-recipient 
matches.) Closely matched donor cells can provide enough graft-versus-
host activity to get rid of any residual cancer cells, but not enough to 
cause additional damage to the recipient. Another plus: Donors can be 
called back to provide more stem cells, if needed (unless the cells come 
from an umbilical cord donor). The biggest drawback is that allogeneic 
cells may not survive the journey to the bone marrow; the recipient’s 
immune system, although weakened, may attack the cells before they 
reach their destination and begin their healing work.
Researchers are experimenting with human embryonic stem cells, induced 
pluripotent stem cells (see Chapter 6), and other techniques to grow useful 
amounts of blood-forming stem cells in the lab. If successful, this research 
will add another source of transplantable cells to the ones in use today. And 
that would be an important advance in treating blood and immune system 
diseases, because, unfortunately, a hefty portion of patients have difficulty 
finding suitable donors of blood-forming stem cells. The ability to generate 
blood-forming stem cells from pluripotent stem cells in the lab would allow 
many more patients to get the stem cell transplants they need.

208
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
 
Since the late 1990s, some transplant centers have been experimenting with 
so-called mini transplants to treat patients. In these procedures, the patient is 
given only enough chemotherapy and/or radiation to suppress the immune 
system — not enough to kill all the cancer or bone marrow in the patient’s 
body. Then allogeneic cells are transplanted into the patient and, when they 
settle into the bone marrow, sometimes they begin killing the remaining 
cancer cells. Because the patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells aren’t com-
pletely killed off, her stem cells and the donor stem cells co-exist in the 
patient’s body for a while. But after a few months, the donor cells take over, 
generating new, healthy blood and immune cells.
The mini-transplant technique isn’t appropriate for everyone. Doctors use it 
most commonly to treat patients whose first transplant didn’t take or those 
who aren’t healthy enough to withstand a standard stem cell transplant. The 
technique doesn’t work as well in people with aggressive cancer or whose 
bodies are already ravaged by disease. But researchers are looking for ways 
to make this treatment as effective as possible for greater numbers of people.
Matching donors and recipients
If doctors can use your own cells, matching is no problem, but recontaminat-
ing you with disease is a concern. If you have an identical twin, you’ve got a 
perfectly matched donor, and you probably don’t have to worry about any 
diseases coming along for the ride. However, if the transplant is intended 
to correct an inherited genetic defect, the identical twin will have that same 
genetic defect; in addition, your twin’s stem cells won’t be able to clean up 
any residual cancer cells because your twin’s cells won’t recognize your tis-
sues as foreign, so you won’t get any graft-versus-host activity.
But few people have identical twins, and, even if you have non-identical sib-
lings, the odds of one of your brothers or sisters being an exact match at the 
major genetic markers that determine whether or not your body will reject 
the transplant is only 1 in 4. If you end up looking for a match among people 
who aren’t blood relations, only 1 in 20,000 potential donors will be a match. 
And if you’re a minority, the odds are even worse because few minorities are 
signed up to donate bone marrow or other tissues and organs. Finding a com-
patible donor is easier among people of the same ethnic or racial background 
because, although all people have the same genes, there’s a ton of variation 
within each specific gene, and some of those variations appear to be more 
common in people who have similar ethnic or racial ancestry.
Scientists also are experimenting with combining gene therapy and stem cell 
transplants to treat certain inherited blood and immune system disorders; 
see the nearby sidebar, “Combining stem cells and gene therapy,” for more 
on how this approach may work.

209
 Chapter 13: Understanding the Role of Stem Cells in Transplants
 
For transplants, donors and recipients are matched by comparing human leu-
kocyte antigens (HLAs), which are proteins on the surface of most cells in your 
body. The most important HLAs that the National Marrow Donor Program 
uses to match donors and recipients are called A, B, and DRB1. (Some trans-
plant centers use other genes and HLAs for matching in addition to the A, B, 
and DRB1 HLAs.) You have three pairs of these HLAs, for a total of six; you 
inherited one set of these HLAs from each of your parents. Your particular 
combination of A, B, and DRB1 HLAs make up your tissue type. Thousands of 
HLA combinations are possible, which makes finding an identical match diffi-
cult. (It’s also why you have only a 25-percent chance that your older brother 
or younger sister has exactly the same tissue type you have.)
A 6-out-of-6 HLA match at A, B, and DRB1 increases the likelihood that 
the transplanted cells won’t be rejected by the recipient’s body. For bone 
marrow transplants, the National Marrow Donor Program requires at least a 
5-in-6 HLA match; other transplant centers may have more stringent match-
ing requirements. When cord blood stem cells are transplanted, a 4-in-6 HLA 
match at A, B, and DRB1 may be enough for a successful graft. The theory 
with cord blood is that the immune system isn’t as mature, so it’s less likely 
to attack the patient’s healthy cells and tissues.
Combining stem cells and gene therapy
Some blood and immune system disorders, 
including some kinds of anemia and thalasse-
mia, a disease that results in abnormalities in 
the hemoglobin (the proteins that carry oxygen 
in red blood cells), are caused by inherited 
genetic defects. In cases where scientists 
know which genetic defect causes the disease, 
they’re looking into using stem cells to deliver 
correct copies of the relevant genes into the 
patient’s body, which (researchers hope) would 
correct the root problem.
In this form of gene therapy, the patient’s blood-
forming stem cells are extracted, and scientists 
insert a normal copy of the gene into those stem 
cells. Then the stem cells are injected back into 
the patient’s body, where they can repopulate 
the patient’s blood and immune systems, thus 
repairing the defects that cause the disease.
An important advantage of this method is that, 
because it uses the patient’s own stem cells, 
the patient’s immune system won’t attack them, 
and the patient doesn’t have to take powerful 
immune-suppressing drugs that leave him vul-
nerable to infection. A potential disadvantage is 
that the process of fixing the defect in the gene 
or inserting a new gene into the patient’s stem 
cells could cause new genetic changes that 
may lead to cancer.
Researchers are devoting considerable time 
and energy to figuring out how to do this kind 
of gene therapy safely and efficiently. Finding 
suitable donors and controlling the immune 
system response are always issues in any kind 
of transplant, and this potential treatment would 
eliminate those concerns.

210
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
When family members can’t provide a suitable match, doctors turn to donor 
registries to find volunteers with compatible tissue types. The largest reg-
istry in the United States is the National Marrow Donor Program (www.
marrow.org) and its Be The Match initiative. The National Marrow Donor 
Program has enlisted more than 5 million volunteer donors, as well as around 
30,000 cord blood units. Turn to “Seeing How It Works: Becoming a Donor,” 
later in this chapter, for information on signing up with the registry.
 
Donor registries are wonderful organizations, but they can’t guarantee they’ll 
find a match for any given patient, for a couple reasons. One reason is that, 
even with millions of potential donors, the donor pool may not be genetically 
diverse enough to match certain people. As we mention earlier in this chapter, 
people of African, Asian, and Hispanic descent have a more difficult time find-
ing suitable donors.
Another problem is keeping track of people who’ve signed up with the regis-
tries. In America’s mobile society, donors may move and not notify the regis-
tries of their new contact information. Or they may change their minds about 
donating.
Public cord banks (see Chapter 14) are good resources because, unlike with 
other donors, the blood is already in a freezer somewhere, so you don’t 
have to track down individual people. You may need more than one unit of 
cord blood. (See “Using stem cells from umbilical cord blood,” earlier in this 
chapter.) But early experimental work indicates that you may be able to get 
away with less-perfect matches when you use cord blood, so finding several 
suitable units of cord blood may be easier than finding a well-matched adult 
donor. Researchers are testing different approaches to using cord blood as a 
source of transplantable stem cells to find the methods and matching criteria 
that work the best.
Overcoming the body’s immune response
Suppressing the immune system isn’t a pretty process, but it often has to be 
done to ensure that the patient’s body doesn’t reject the transplanted cells 
or tissues. In solid organ transplants, like liver or kidney transplants, patients 
typically are given powerful immune-suppressing drugs after the fact, which 
lowers the risk of rejection but also makes the patient more susceptible to all 
kinds of infections. In some cases, even relatively minor infections can be life-
threatening to transplant patients.
Rejection of a transplanted organ can happen at any time, so transplant 
patients usually have to take immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of their 
lives. And that means transplant patients are vulnerable to infection for the 
rest of their lives.

211
 Chapter 13: Understanding the Role of Stem Cells in Transplants
 
If you’re treating cancer with chemotherapy and radiation — whether it’s leu-
kemia or cancer in a solid organ — the treatment may wipe out the patient’s 
immune system anyway. One of the unintended consequences of such treat-
ment is that it kills healthy cells along with diseased cells. So reconstituting 
the patient’s immune system with a transplant of blood-forming stem cells is 
sometimes part of the standard course of treatment.
Preventing disease relapse
One big challenge in treating leukemia and other blood disorders is making 
sure that the disease doesn’t return. If cancer cells have migrated to other 
parts of the body, for example, finding and destroying them can be diffi-
cult (see Chapter 8). This challenge occurs in solid organ transplants, too. 
For example, if the underlying problem is an immune system malfunction, 
preventing the immune system from attacking the new organ may require 
additional treatment (on top of the usual immune-suppression techniques 
employed to keep the body from rejecting the new organ).
Graft-versus-host disease can help prevent cancer from returning because 
the donor’s immune cells view the transplant recipient’s cells and tissues as 
foreign invaders and attack them. The trick is controlling graft-versus-host 
disease so that it doesn’t overwhelm healthy cells and tissues.
 
Unfortunately, like so much in medicine, preventing disease relapse has as 
much to do with luck, the individual patient, and the disease itself as with 
treatment. Sometimes (too often, many physicians would say) it’s a matter of 
administering the treatment and then crossing your fingers and hoping you 
got it right — that all the variables go your way. But when all those variables 
do go your way, you can (we think) end up with a cure for some cancers — at 
least for that individual, and at least for several years, if not for a lifetime.
Going Through the Stages: What 
Happens in a Stem Cell Transplant
To borrow from Bette Davis, having a stem cell transplant ain’t for sissies. 
It’s a lengthy, invasive, exhausting procedure, requiring physical, mental, and 
emotional stamina and a great deal of social support both before and after 
treatment.
In the following sections, we take you through the steps of a stem cell trans-
plant, from pretransplant evaluation and preparation to recovery.

212
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
Evaluating the potential 
transplant patient
Because transplants are hard on both your mind and body, transplant cen-
ters first conduct an extensive evaluation to determine whether you’re a 
good candidate for a stem cell transplant. The evaluation process looks at 
such factors as the type and stage of your disease and any other physical 
health issues that may complicate the transplant process or interfere with its 
effectiveness (such as alcohol abuse in the case of liver transplants or heart 
disease in other potential transplant patients).
The transplant team also evaluates your psychological and emotional status. 
Most patients experience a syndrome called cancer treatment distress before 
and after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant; this syndrome includes anxi-
ety about the treatment itself, as well as worry about finances, physical capa-
bilities, and “being a burden” to loved ones. In about a third of patients, their 
distress symptoms rise to the level of clinical depression.
 
Social support is a major factor in recovery and long-term survival rates for 
stem cell transplant patients. Having a spouse, partner, parent, or other loved 
one at your side before and after the transplant can make a huge difference in 
your chances of recovery — as long as the loved one offers the right kind of sup-
port. See the nearby sidebar, “How loved ones can help or hurt your recovery.”
Other pretransplant tests and evaluations may include
 
✓ Medical history and physical exam
 
✓ HLA tissue typing (see “Matching donors and recipients,” earlier in this 
chapter)
 
✓ Radiology tests, such as chest X-rays and CT (computed tomography, 
commonly called a CAT scan) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) 
scans
 
✓ Heart tests
 
✓ Blood tests, including screening for diseases like HIV/AIDS and counts of 
various cell types
 
✓ Bone marrow biopsy
You and your transplant team also discuss health insurance coverage and 
out-of-pocket expenses that you may be responsible for.

213
 Chapter 13: Understanding the Role of Stem Cells in Transplants
Preparing your body for the procedure
When you’re ready to begin treatment, your doctor inserts a catheter, a thin 
tube designed to allow withdrawal and introduction of fluids, into a large vein 
in your chest. The catheter typically stays in place until blood tests show 
that the transplant has “taken,” and your blood counts are showing steady 
improvement. You may receive chemotherapy through this catheter before 
the transplant, too.
The better your overall health, the more easily your body can tolerate the 
preparation for the transplant. In many cases, stem cell transplant patients 
first go through exhausting rounds of high-dose chemotherapy and radia-
tion, which can produce some ghastly side effects. Patients often experience 
severe nausea, weakness, and hair loss, among other effects. Your immune 
system also becomes compromised from the treatment, so you’re more vul-
nerable to infection.
How loved ones can help or hurt your recovery
Research into the psychological and social 
aspects of stem cell transplants has shown that 
having the emotional and practical support of 
family and friends can contribute to how well 
you’ll fare after the transplant. But the quality 
of that support is just as important as the sup-
port itself.
Negative support — criticism of the patient, pes-
simism about the treatment or prognosis, or help 
that doesn’t match the patient’s needs (such 
as insisting on cooking meals when the patient 
really needs help taking care of the yard) — has 
a negative impact on patient recovery. One study 
indicated that so-called problematic support can 
more than triple a patient’s risk of dying within 
four years after a transplant.
If you have a loved one undergoing a stem cell 
transplant, just being there (with a positive atti-
tude) is important. In a study comparing trans-
plant patients whose positive caregivers were 
present during the patient’s hospital stay and 
patients whose caregivers weren’t at the hos-
pital, all the patients whose caregivers were 
present survived the first month after the trans-
plant, while nearly one in five patients without 
caregiver support died within the first month. 
Almost three-quarters of those patients died 
within a year, compared with only 25 percent 
of the patients whose caregivers were present.
No one knows exactly why positive social sup-
port is so important to patient health and recov-
ery. Some studies have shown that positive 
caregivers help patients adhere to their medical 
plan better, taking medicine, eating, and exer-
cising as directed. Other studies have shown 
that stress and anxiety can make healthy indi-
viduals succumb to rhinovirus, which causes 
about a third of common colds in adults. Finally, 
a small study supports the idea that psychologi-
cal characteristics like optimism and determi-
nation can influence your immune system: stem 
cell transplant patients who had higher depres-
sion scores before the transplant took almost a 
week longer to develop strong levels of infec-
tion-fighting white blood cells than patients 
with lower pretransplant depression scores.

214
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
Chemotherapy and radiation is called conditioning. (The technical term is 
myeloablation.) Conditioning makes room in your bone marrow for the trans-
planted cells to settle in, suppresses your immune system so that it won’t 
attack the transplanted cells, and destroys many (but not always all) cancer 
cells in your body. Chemotherapy is usually given in pills or through a cath-
eter; radiation is usually given to the entire body, either in a single treatment 
or in a series of treatments.
 
Because of the high doses typically used in conditioning, the chemotherapy 
and radiation make most people — men and women alike — sterile, or unable 
to have children. While other side effects will ease over time (it may take sev-
eral months to fully recover), this one is permanent, so it’s important to dis-
cuss it with your spouse or partner and with your medical adviser before you 
decide on a treatment plan. Men often store sperm before undergoing treat-
ment; unfortunately, unfertilized eggs don’t seem to store as well.
Receiving the transplant
Actually receiving the transplant is the easy part of the entire process. It’s 
just like getting a blood transfusion: The new cells are introduced into your 
body through an IV. Most patients are hospitalized for at least a few days — 
sometimes longer — to keep them in a controlled, sterile environment and 
thus reduce the risk of infection. Infection is a big risk at this point because 
the patient’s own immune system is severely compromised (maybe even non-
existent) and it takes time for the transplanted cells to rebuild the immune 
system.
The other big issue is graft-versus-host disease. A certain amount of graft-
versus-host activity helps wipe out any cancer cells that survived the che-
motherapy and radiation treatments. But too much of it can wipe out the 
patient by attacking healthy cells and tissues. So patients sometimes receive 
immune-suppressing drugs after the transplant to keep graft-versus-host 
activity under control.
Other side effects with the transplant usually are mild and short-lived, and 
not all patients experience them. Some suffer fever or chills, low blood pres-
sure, chest tightness or pain, and shortness of breath, but most of these 
symptoms pass quickly.
Waiting for old and new to work together
After the transplant comes the waiting game. For most patients, it takes 
between two and six weeks for the transplanted cells to begin measurably 
restoring the blood and immune systems. Unless you have a catheter (a tube 
inserted in your body, through which health care professionals can deliver 

215
 Chapter 13: Understanding the Role of Stem Cells in Transplants
medicines and draw blood), you may feel like a pincushion during those 
weeks, as your transplant team will draw blood regularly to measure counts 
of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. You also may receive 
transfusions of red blood cells and platelets to keep your body’s tissues 
nourished and prevent bleeding problems until the transplant “takes.”
You also may take a variety of antibiotics, anti-viral, and anti-fungus drugs 
until your white blood cell count reaches an acceptable level. These drugs are 
designed to ward off infection when your immune system is at its weakest.
Fatigue is often a problem for transplant patients, especially in the first 
couple of weeks after the transplant. Other potential symptoms include stom-
ach or intestinal problems and issues with other vital organs, such as the 
heart, liver, or kidneys. And patients often have to cope with feelings of isola-
tion, anxiety, and depression, too.
 
Sometimes a transplant doesn’t take — that is, the stem cells don’t settle into the 
bone marrow and begin producing new blood cells. They may not survive the trip 
to the bone marrow, or there may not have been enough stem cells to reconsti-
tute the blood and immune systems. Depending on the circumstances — includ-
ing the patient’s general health — a second transplant attempt may be made, and 
the cycle of treatment starts all over again.
Seeing How It Works: Becoming a Donor
In the United States, two main agencies administer transplant donations. The 
National Marrow Donor Program (www.marrow.org) concentrates on bone 
marrow donors and recipients, while the United Network for Organ Sharing 
(UNOS) handles solid organ donations (see www.unos.org).
 
Celebrities and wealthy people don’t have any greater access to donated 
organs and tissues than anyone else; everyone on the transplant waiting list is 
evaluated by the same criteria, which include the severity of the illness, time 
spent on the waiting list, geographic location, and medical considerations. 
Appropriately matched donated organs and tissues go to patients who are 
seriously ill but healthy enough to withstand the transplant.
The following sections cover donations of bone marrow and solid organs, as 
well as how to become a donor of either.

216
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
Donating blood-forming stem cells
Doctors harvest blood-forming stem cells in one of two ways:
 
✓ By collecting marrow directly from a large bone (usually the hip bone)
 
✓ By giving the donor drugs that stimulate stem cell growth and then 
drawing the donor’s blood
Both methods are typically done on an outpatient basis (although collecting 
directly from the marrow may require a short hospital stay) and are fairly 
easy on the donor. Although direct marrow collection used to be the stan-
dard, harvesting stem cells from circulating blood is becoming increasingly 
common — in part because it’s easier and less expensive than the surgical 
bone-marrow-collection procedure.
When bone marrow is collected, the donor is put under anesthetic — either 
general, which means you’re unconscious for the procedure, or local, in 
which you’re conscious but the area being worked on is numb. After the 
anesthetic wears off, the donor typically feels some pressure or pain in the 
lower back for a few days, but most donors go back to normal activities 
within a week, and any residual symptoms typically disappear within three 
weeks.
When stem cells are collected from circulating blood, the donor takes 
growth-stimulating drugs for a few days before the procedure, which can 
cause some mild side effects like headache and nausea. The symptoms asso-
ciated with the drugs usually disappear a day or two after the donation.
 
Blood-forming stem cells are remarkably good at replenishing lost cells, so 
donors don’t have to worry about giving “too much” marrow or blood. It only 
takes 5 percent or less of your bone marrow to treat an adult (and possibly 
save a life), and your body will replace the donated marrow in four to six 
weeks. It takes even less time for your body to recover from donating stem 
cells from circulating blood.
It doesn’t cost you anything to donate, either. The recipient’s health insur-
ance typically covers your medical expenses, and the National Marrow Donor 
Program, which operates the Be The Match registry, reimburses you for 
travel expenses and may help with other expenses.
Donating solid organs and tissues
UNOS (www.unos.org) coordinates the efforts of nearly 60 regional organ 
procurement agencies around the country. These regional agencies handle 
organ procurement for more than 261 transplant centers.

217
 Chapter 13: Understanding the Role of Stem Cells in Transplants
All hospitals are required to notify their regional organ procurement agency 
of all patient deaths; the agency then looks for possible recipients and con-
tacts the families of the deceased patients to inquire about donations. This 
is why it’s important to talk to your family about your wishes: About a third 
of families refuse to consent to donation, even if the deceased intended to 
donate.
Signing up to donate
Almost 80 million Americans are registered organ, tissue, or bone marrow 
donors. Even so, thousands of people die each year waiting for life-saving 
transplants. In some cases, people who want to donate organs or tissues 
after death don’t communicate their wishes to their families. In other cases, 
people change their minds about being a donor — especially in the case of 
living donations, such as bone marrow, liver, or kidney donations.
 
Becoming a donor is easy. Many medical societies and patient advocacy 
groups encourage it, and people who have donated blood or other tissues or 
organs generally feel good about donating. If you want to donate bone marrow 
or blood-forming stem cells, check out the Be The Match program at www.
marrow.org. This one-stop site for joining the national bone marrow dona-
tion registry provides information on becoming a donor, including eligibility 
requirements.
In most states, you can sign up at any time to donate your organs and tis-
sues (which would only be donated after your death, of course) at your local 
driver’s license bureau or Department of Motor Vehicles office. Be sure to 
discuss your intentions with your family and leave written instructions about 
your donation wishes, too. You’re never too old to donate: Although living 
donors often have age restrictions, people age 65 and older can donate cor-
neas, skin, and bone after death, or make a so-called full-body donation for 
scientific research.
You can also choose to donate your newborn’s umbilical cord blood (see 
Chapter 14). Contact the National Marrow Donor Program (www.marrow.
org) to find a cord blood donation center near you and to learn about cord 
blood donation guidelines.
Living donors can contribute the following organs and tissues:
 
✓ Blood-forming stem cells, either from bone marrow or from circulating 
blood
 
✓ A portion of the intestines
 
✓ Kidney (the remaining kidney will grow a bit to accommodate the extra 
work it has to do)
 
✓ A portion of the liver (because the liver can regenerate itself)

218
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
 
✓ A portion of the lung
 
✓ A portion of the pancreas
 
Living donors have to meet certain health criteria and age limits. Generally, 
living donors can be between the ages of 18 and 60, be in good overall health, 
and genuinely want to donate. (They can’t be coerced or paid for donating.) 
People who have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a history of cancer, heart 
disease, or kidney disease usually can’t become living donors.
Deceased donors can donate:
 
✓ Bone
 
✓ Corneas
 
✓ Heart
 
✓ Intestinal organs
 
✓ Kidneys
 
✓ Liver
 
✓ Lungs
 
✓ Pancreas
 
✓ Skin
Understanding the Current State 
of Transplant Medicine
Bone marrow or circulating blood transplants are becoming more common 
for a wider range of diseases — especially those where either the disease 
or the standard treatment severely damages the patient’s immune system. 
These processes are standard treatments for leukemia and some other can-
cers and blood disorders, but they’re still experimental for other diseases.
Kidney and liver transplants also are fairly routine, but the issue is the lack 
of available donor organs. According to UNOS, about 100,000 people in the 
United States are waiting for suitable donor organs or tissues at any given 
time. A new name is added to the waiting list every 11 minutes, and 18 
patients die every day waiting for a donor. In 2008, nearly 8,000 deceased 
people’s organs and tissues were donated, and another 6,200 living donors 
contributed organs or parts of organs, tissues, and blood-forming stem cells. 
Combined, these donations helped more than 27,000 patients — but that left 
some 73,000 people without the donor organs and tissues they desperately 
needed.

219
 Chapter 13: Understanding the Role of Stem Cells in Transplants
As transplantation itself has become more reliable and more common, the 
demand for donor organs and tissues has gone up considerably. But, as of 
today, there’s no obvious way to increase the supply of donor organs and 
tissues because, except in limited cases, someone has to die in order for a 
transplant patient to get a new organ.
 
Supply will never equal demand when it comes to organ and tissue trans-
plants, in part because not everyone, living or deceased, is a suitable donor. 
When the donor is deceased, in most cases, organs and tissues have to be har-
vested within a few hours after death, if not immediately; in situations where 
autopsies are requested or required, or where the death isn’t discovered right 
away, chances are those organs and tissues won’t be usable for transplants 
(although you can donate those organs and tissue to research if you choose).
Stem cell research and regenerative medicine may be able, someday, to 
help fill the gaps by discovering ways to grow tissues, parts of organs, or 
even whole organs that can be safely used to treat people for whom the only 
option is a transplant. Scientists aren’t there yet, and these kinds of break-
throughs may be several years away. But this is one direction in which the 
field is moving because it has the potential to revolutionize the way the medi-
cal community treats a variety of diseases.

Putting Stem Cells in the Bank
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the benefits and limitations of cord blood
▶ Discovering how cord blood banking works
▶ Understanding the differences between private and public cord blood banks
▶ Finding out whether cord blood banking is right for you
T
he idea of storing stem cells for future use has been around since at 
least the early 1990s. That’s when researchers began experimenting with 
blood from umbilical cords to see whether its stem cells could help patients 
suffering from certain blood diseases like leukemia. The National Institutes of 
Health also began funding public cord-blood banks in the early ’90s. Today, 
private cord blood banks abound, and some companies offer to freeze and 
store stem cells from all kinds of sources, including fat, teeth, and even men-
strual blood. The idea is that you can gain access to your own stem cells if 
you or a family member ever needs an infusion of them. Of course, that’s a 
pretty big “if.”
In this chapter, we explore the pros and cons of stem cell banking, showing 
you how these banks work, identifying the differences between public and 
private banks, and helping you figure out what you need to know if you’re 
considering banking your own or a loved one’s stem cells. We focus on cord 
blood banks, because they’re the most common, so we start with the limita-
tions of cord blood to help you weigh costs against potential benefits.
Examining Medical Uses of Cord Blood
Cord blood contains several types of stem cells, including blood-forming and 
mesenchymal stem cells, which form bone and connective tissue cells (see 
Chapter 5). Transplants of the blood-forming stem cells in cord blood look 
promising in terms of treating certain diseases, primarily diseases of the 
blood. These transplants are becoming more common, especially in cases 
where the transplant team can’t find a suitable marrow donor. And various 
researchers and physicians are experimenting with cord blood in hopes that 
these experiments will lead to standard treatments.

222
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
At the moment, though, much of this experimentation is just that — experi-
mental. Some patients seem to respond, others don’t, and much of the evi-
dence so far is anecdotal. Several research teams are conducting clinical trials 
involving cord blood, but it’s too early to say what kinds of cord blood thera-
pies will end up being the most effective for the greatest number of people.
 
Cord blood does have certain limitations. So far, cord blood isn’t obviously 
useful for treating anything other than blood disorders. Cord blood stem cells 
take longer to begin regenerating new blood cells than stem cells from adult 
bone marrow or blood. And, although cord blood contains a high frequency of 
blood-forming stem cells, a typical umbilical cord doesn’t yield much blood; 
the average yield is 75 milliliters, or about 5 tablespoons. Usually, a single 
cord blood unit doesn’t contain enough stem cells to treat an adult, and scien-
tists don’t know yet how to grow large amounts of blood-forming stem cells in 
the lab.
On the other hand, sometimes finding multiple cord blood units that match 
the intended recipient is easier than finding a single adult donor match. (See 
Chapter 13 for more on matching donors and recipients.)
 
Because cord blood transplants aren’t approved by the FDA yet, many health 
insurance companies refuse to pay for them on the grounds that they’re 
experimental.
Understanding How Cord 
Blood Banking Works
Public cord blood banks work like blood banks, processing, screening, and 
freezing cord blood for possible transplants; when you use a public bank, 
you essentially donate your child’s cord blood to whomever needs it (and 
is a suitable genetic match). Private cord blood banks are more like safety 
deposit boxes for your child’s cord blood; unless you decide to make it avail-
able to an unknown recipient, the cord blood is stored solely for use by your 
child or a family member.
 
Different countries have different systems for banking cord blood. Some com-
bine public and private banking, so that families have the option of reserving 
their children’s cord blood or releasing it for a transplant or for research. In 
Germany, for example, parents can store their child’s cord blood at a private 
bank but allow the relevant genetic makeup of the cord blood to be listed on a 
public registry. Then, if the cord blood matches a potential recipient, the par-
ents decide whether to release the cord blood to that recipient or keep it in 
reserve. Spain has a similar system, except that parents who list their child’s 
cord blood type on a public registry are required to release the cord blood if it 
matches a potential recipient.

223
 Chapter 14: Putting Stem Cells in the Bank
In the United States, you have an either/or choice between public or private 
cord blood banks, and the type you choose affects how the process of bank-
ing cord blood works. The following sections look at the differences between 
public and private banks, the processes for banking cord blood in the United 
States, and the potential downsides of doing so.
Weighing the pros and cons 
of private and public banks
Public cord blood banks have been around since the 1990s. They’re funded 
through government contracts; the cord blood in their stores is available to 
anyone who needs a transplant and matches a specific unit of cord blood (see 
Chapter 13); and they work with designated hospitals to ensure that cord 
blood is collected, screened, and shipped according to standard protocols.
The public banks have a congressional mandate to store at least 150,000 cord 
blood units or samples, which creates a pretty big pool of potential donors — 
a good thing for matching cord blood to transplant recipients, and for study-
ing certain kinds of blood diseases.
Public banks have some disadvantages, including the following:
 
✓ Their cord blood is available to anyone who’s an appropriate match. If 
you ever need a cord blood transplant, you go into the registry and look 
for a potential match just like everyone else; you don’t necessarily get 
back the cord blood you donated.
 
✓ Not every hospital can collect cord blood for public banks. Only about 
200 hospitals in the United States are authorized to collect cord blood 
for public banks, and if you’re not near one of those hospitals, you may 
have to consider other donation options, such as private banks or an 
organization like Cryobanks International, which accepts public dona-
tions from anywhere in the continental United States.
 
✓ Although donation is free, withdrawal may cost you. Public banks 
don’t charge for donations of cord blood, but they sometimes charge a 
fee for withdrawing units or samples. Your health insurance may or may 
not cover this expense; although insurance coverage is slowly becoming 
more common, many insurers don’t pay for any costs associated with 
cord blood transplants because they’re still considered experimental 
treatments.
Private cord blood banks — sometimes referred to as family banks — work 
the other way around. Whatever you deposit in a private bank is yours when-
ever you need it, or until you decide you don’t want to pay for its storage 
any more. Your donation won’t be used for research or for a transplant in 

224
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
an unrelated recipient; it’s reserved for your use alone. Private cord blood 
banks started popping up in the United States around the turn of the 21st 
century, and today it’s a $250-million industry.
Disadvantages with private banks include the following:
 
✓ Out-of-pocket expenses: Most private banks charge between $1,000 and 
$2,500 for collection, processing, and initial storage of cord blood. Then 
you pay a yearly maintenance fee, usually a couple hundred dollars, to 
keep the cord blood in storage. Health insurance rarely, if ever, covers 
these costs.
 
✓ Lack of standardized processing: Public banks have to follow certain 
procedures to make sure that any donated cord blood is screened for 
diseases, viruses, and other contaminants that would make it unsuitable 
for transplant. Private banks don’t have any such rules, and there’s no 
standardized set of procedures for private banks to follow. Some groups 
offer accreditation, and a few states have enacted licensing require-
ments (see the following section), but accreditation is largely voluntary, 
and licensing requirements are by no means uniform.
 
✓ No contribution to research: For some people, donating cord blood 
is more an act of civic responsibility than an insurance policy against 
future illness. Donating to a public bank means your cord blood will 
be used either to help another individual or to advance scientific 
understanding of diseases. Private banking doesn’t offer either of 
these possibilities.
 
Although private banks have far more cord blood units than public banks, 
public banks have facilitated far more actual transplants than private banks. 
According to the National Marrow Donor Program, the number of transplants 
from public bank sources is 650 times greater than the number of private-bank 
transplants. From a scientific perspective, the public banks are far more useful 
than private banks because these transplants — and the availability of cord 
blood for research — are providing much more data than the private banks 
provide.
Making a deposit
Whether you go with a public or private bank (see “Weighing the pros and 
cons of private and public banks,” earlier in this chapter), the process of 
collecting and storing cord blood is essentially the same: After the umbilical 
cord is clamped and cut in the delivery room, the blood is transferred to a 
sterile bag or vial and shipped to a storage facility. There’s virtually no risk to 
the baby or the mother because the blood isn’t collected until after the cord 
is cut.

225
 Chapter 14: Putting Stem Cells in the Bank
 
Public banks have certain protocols that hospitals have to follow in collecting 
and shipping cord blood, and not all hospitals are equipped to follow these 
guidelines. Private banks accept cord blood from wherever the birth takes 
places. (See “Exploring standards of practice,” later in this chapter for more 
on the different requirements of private and public banks.)
Public cord blood banks in the United States require that the mother give her 
informed consent to the donation — that is, she has to freely agree to donate 
the cord blood after she is told of (and understands) what the cord blood 
may be used for and what’s expected of her. The nearby sidebar, “What hap-
pens with donations to public banks,” provides an overview of what most 
public banks’ informed consent process entails.
 
The National Marrow Donor Program (www.marrow.org), which operates 
the Be The Match registry for bone marrow and blood-forming stem cells, rec-
ommends that you discuss donating cord blood with your doctor or midwife 
before your 34th week of pregnancy. This timing gives you and your delivery 
team time to complete the consent form and health questionnaires and deter-
mine whether your hospital collects cord blood donations. If your hospital 
doesn’t collect cord blood for public banks, you may have other donations 
options; check out the Web site at the beginning of this paragraph to find out 
where you can donate.
What happens with donations to public banks
When you donate cord blood to a public bank 
in the United States, federal law requires you 
to sign a consent form that describes what 
the cord blood may be used for (transplant or 
research) and what your rights and responsi-
bilities are as a donor. For example, you have 
to agree to have your own blood tested for 
infectious diseases within seven days after you 
give birth; the tests screen for HIV, hepatitis, 
and other diseases that can be passed along 
to your child (and would therefore render the 
cord blood ineligible for transplant).
The cord blood also is tested for contamina-
tion (which can occur in the delivery room) and 
genetic disorders (such as sickle cell disease) 
and then analyzed to determine blood and 
tissue type.
Typically, donors have to agree to be told of the 
test results; if you don’t want to learn what the 
tests show, you aren’t eligible to donate. You 
also have to agree to let the bank review medi-
cal records for you and your baby and may have 
to answer some questions about your medical, 
social, and economic history.
Sometimes even healthy cord blood can’t be 
used for a transplant because it doesn’t contain 
enough blood-forming stem cells. Cord blood 
that’s deemed unsuitable for transplant may 
be used for research or discarded as medical 
waste — another condition you have to agree to.

226
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
When the cord blood arrives at the bank, it’s processed and then frozen in 
liquid nitrogen or vapor from liquid nitrogen. Different banks have different 
methods for processing cord blood; some freeze it whole, and some extract 
the blood-forming stem cells and freeze only those, discarding the remaining 
material. (Although cord blood probably contains other cells that may be 
useful, most banks focus on preserving the blood-forming stem cells.) The 
freezing and storage techniques most banks use seem to protect cord blood 
stem cells’ viability for quite a long time — at least 10 to 15 years.
Knowing what can go wrong
Cord blood banking presents several potential pitfalls — or at least reasons 
why it may not live up to the promises in its press releases. For one thing, the 
likelihood that your child or another family member will need the cord blood 
for a transplant is very low. Some authorities put the lifetime odds of any 
given child ever needing the stem cells from his umbilical cord at 1 in 400; 
others put the odds at 1 in 2,700 or more. Overall, the current odds of any 
individual ever getting any kind of stem cell transplant are around 1 in 200 
over a 70-year lifespan.
 
Cord blood can be very useful in treating certain blood disorders. But if 
your child has a disease affecting the heart, kidney, brain, or other organs, 
chances are his cord blood cells won’t be any help at all in terms of treating 
the disease.
If you choose a public bank, those odds may not be an issue because the idea 
behind public banks is that donors make their donations available to anyone 
who needs them. But with private banks, you pay a pretty good chunk of 
money to have cord blood collected, processed, and stored, without any 
guarantee that you’ll ever have reason to withdraw and use the cord blood. 
Prices among banks differ, of course, but you can expect to pay between 
$1,000 and $2,000 for initial processing and storage, and a couple hundred 
dollars per year in maintenance fees after that.
Another potential concern: Private cord blood banks can go out of business, 
and then what happens to the cells they’re storing? The industry hasn’t been 
around long enough to answer that question, but businesses go under all 
the time for all kinds of reasons, and there’s no good reason to suppose that 
private cord blood banks are immune to the pressures other businesses face. 
The nearby sidebar, “The PharmaStem licensing legal battle,” describes how 
one such financial pressure can affect a private bank’s bottom line.

227
 Chapter 14: Putting Stem Cells in the Bank
 
How long banks can store cord blood and its blood-forming stem cells before 
they lose their potential usefulness also is an issue. So far, the evidence seems 
pretty solid that, with the standard freezing and storage techniques in use 
today, the cells can remain viable for a decade or longer. But most people who 
get stem cell transplants don’t need them until far later in life. And no one 
knows whether your child’s cord blood cells will still be useful if he needs a 
transplant in his 30s, 40s, or 50s — assuming that scientists figure out how to 
grow enough cord blood stem cells in the lab to treat an adult.
Conducting Due Diligence: What You 
Need to Know in Choosing to Bank
If you look at many of the ads for cord blood or stem cell banks, you see 
some pretty amazing claims. (By “pretty amazing,” we mean “probably not 
true — at least not yet.”) Companies are storing fat gathered from liposuc-
tion and claiming that the stem cells in that fat can be used to treat all kinds 
of diseases. Other companies offer to freeze the tissue from your children’s 
baby teeth so that the stem cells in that tissue can be available should your 
children ever need them. There’s even a company promoting collection and 
storage of menstrual blood, claiming stem cells from that blood can be used 
to treat disease.
 
Many, if not most, of these claims are overblown at best and just plain false at 
worst. Fat and baby teeth do indeed contain some stem cells; they’re mainly 
(and maybe solely) mesenchymal stem cells. That’s not to say that mesen-
chymal stem cells are useless; they’re very good for some applications (see 
Chapter 5). But scientists are a long way from using these types of stem cells 
to treat a wide range of diseases, as some of these bank ads claim.
The PharmaStem licensing legal battle
Between 2002 and 2006, biotech company 
PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. claimed that 
all cord blood banks were using processes and 
procedures that PharmaStem had patented. 
(See Chapter 17 for more on patenting in stem 
cell science.) The company went after the 
private cord blood banks in the United States, 
trying to force them to buy patent licenses. 
Some banks agreed and paid PharmaStem for 
the right to use the patented procedures. Four 
banks, including CBR, the largest private cord 
blood bank in the United States, resisted and 
instead challenged PharmaStem’s patents. 
The patents eventually were revoked, but not 
before CBR and the other challenger banks had 
run up substantial legal bills. And the banks that 
agreed to pay PharmaStem for patent licenses 
had to comply with those contracts even after 
the patents were revoked.

228
Part IV: Putting Stem Cells to Use Today 
Be aware, too, that private banks employ salespeople whose job is to get doc-
tors to encourage their patients to bank their children’s cord blood — at the 
salesperson’s bank, of course. In some cases, doctors even receive commis-
sions for the patients they refer.
So, if you can’t trust the ads and you don’t know whether your doctor has 
a financial interest in the bank she’s recommending, how do you make an 
informed decision about banking cord blood or other stem-cell-laden tissues? 
The following sections help you sort out how to assess a bank’s operating 
practices and standards and where to go for more information.
Exploring standards of practice
Several agencies and organizations offer accreditation for private cord blood 
banks, and a handful of states have enacted licensing or other requirements 
for private banks that do business within their borders. For the most part, 
though, the only banks that are required to meet defined criteria are public 
banks, which are regulated by the federal government.
The following sections provide an overview of federal, state, and accrediting 
organization requirements — and tell you which ones may mean the facility 
maintains high standards and which ones are more generic in nature.
Looking at the Food & Drug Administration’s role
Under FDA rules, all cord banks, public or private, have to register with the 
FDA, but the FDA doesn’t license or otherwise “approve” cord blood banks. In 
fact, registration doesn’t even imply that a facility follows other FDA rules for 
screening donated cord blood or preventing contamination of the samples.
 
The FDA has never officially approved cord blood transplantation, so it’s still 
considered an experimental treatment. Hospitals or clinics that perform these 
transplants, particularly when the donor and recipient aren’t related, have to 
register the procedures under an Investigational New Drug, or IND, applica-
tion. Similar to clinical trials (see Chapter 11), IND applications have safety 
and reporting requirements that the hospital or transplant facility has to meet.
Any facility, including a cord blood bank, that performs patient testing 
also has to follow federal regulations known as CLIA (Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments). Labs and other testing facilities are inspected 
every two years and bear the cost of the inspections. Because CLIA compli-
ance is a legal requirement for these facilities, so-called CLIA certification 
isn’t really an accreditation standard.
Examining state regulations
A few states have enacted laws that regulate cord blood banking operations. 
New York has one of the most rigorous sets of licensing requirements: Cord 

229
 Chapter 14: Putting Stem Cells in the Bank
blood banks have to meet specific personnel, testing, and procedural qual-
ity control conditions in order to operate within the state’s borders, accept 
donations from anywhere in the state, or provide samples to any facility in 
the state. Banks typically receive a provisional license first, but even banks 
with permanent licenses can be downgraded to provisional status if they 
fail any inspection points or get lax on the licensing requirements. The state 
health department lists licensed public and private banks online at www.
health.state.ny.us. Use the site’s search function (type “cord blood 
bank”) to find the list of banks.
California, Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey have similar requirements 
for cord blood banks that are located or do business within their borders. 
California and Maryland accept AABB accreditation (see the following sec-
tion) in lieu of a state inspection.
Sorting through accrediting agencies
Accreditation of cord blood banks is strictly voluntary; facilities don’t have to 
be accredited to obtain state licenses or to register with the FDA. Typically, 
accreditation ensures that the cord blood bank meets reasonably high stan-
dards in area ranging from personnel levels and qualifications to daily operat-
ing procedures.
Several organizations offer accreditation for cord blood banks. They include
 
✓ Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy, or FACT (www.
factwebsite.org): FACT is a nonprofit coalition of the International 
Society for Cellular Therapy, the American Society for Blood and Marrow 
Transplantation, and other similar organizations. It conducts accredita-
tion inspections and reviews on a voluntary basis for public cord blood 
banks. FACT inspections are done every three years, and the facilities pay 
$25,000 to go through the accreditation process. FACT inspections exam-
ine a bank’s operations from the collection site to transplant recipients, 
and the inspection team includes a transplant physician. So far, only four 
public cord banks have received FACT accreditation.
 
✓ AABB (www.aabb.org): Formerly the American Association of Blood 
Banks, this nonprofit group now has an international scope and goes by 
its initials only. Accredited banks are inspected every two years and pay 
$5,600 to go through the process. AABB doesn’t mandate how banks oper-
ate, but does require banks to perform standard screening tests on dona-
tions or deposits and requires banks to report patient outcomes when 
one of their samples is used as a medical treatment. Private banks, which 
aren’t eligible for FACT accreditation, often seek AABB accreditation.
 
✓ International Organization for Standardization (www.iso.org): ISO is 
a quality accreditation that ensures businesses have operating proce-
dures in place and follow them. ISO isn’t specific to cord blood banks (or 
any other business or industry, for that matter), but many international 
cord blood banks are ISO-accredited.

Finding the right bank for you
For most people, choosing a bank is a matter of balancing costs and ben-
efits. With private banking, you have to weigh the upfront and maintenance 
expenses against the low or modest risk that you’ll need the cord blood you 
deposit someday. With public banks, the cost is in losing ownership of your 
donation; the benefit is contributing to a shared resource that will help more 
than your own family.
 
Here are some resources to help you in your search for a cord blood bank:
 
✓ The Parent’s Guide to Cord Blood Foundation (http://parents
guidecordblood.org) lists public and private banks in the United 
States (they call private banks family banks), as well as price estimates 
and suggested questions to ask when you’re considering a bank.
 
✓ The National Marrow Donation Program’s Web site (www.marrow.org) 
lists hospitals that participate in public banking; click the Get Involved 
tab at the top of the home page and then select Donate Cord Blood from 
the menu on the left side of the screen.
 
✓ If you’re not near a hospital that participates in public cord blood 
banking, you may be able to make a donation through Cryobanks 
International (www.cryo-intl.com). Cryobanks accepts donations 
from throughout the continental United States and lists those donations 
on the National Marrow Donation Program’s Be The Match registry.
Exploring the Future of Stem Cell Banking
No one really knows whether banking stem cells will become standard prac-
tice or just a stop-gap measure on the way to creating made-to-order cells 
and tissues. If the technologies used to create induced pluripotent stem 
cells — such as reprogramming stem cells from skin or fat or other tissues 
to behave more like embryonic stem cells (see Chapter 6) — turn out to be 
reliable and cost-effective, stem cell banks will probably go the way of the 
old-fashioned general store. There won’t be any reason to save stem cells if 
you can have the appropriate cells made from your own tissues whenever 
you need them.
On the other hand, it may be quite a long time before those reprogramming 
technologies become safe, effective, and affordable. In that case, stem banks 
will be valuable resources — at least for hematopoietic and mesenchymal 
stem cells. Whether you’d ever be able to store stem cells from solid organs 
or neuronal stem cells is an open question, given the difficulties in finding 
and harvesting them (see Chapter 5). Until those questions are answered 
definitively, private stem cell banks are likely to proliferate, and public banks 
are likely to continue seeking donations for research and treatments.

Understanding the 
Debate: Ethics,

S
cientific advances often bring with them questions 
about what is and isn’t appropriate, ethical, or moral. 
Stem cell research is no exception, particularly when it 
comes to using human embryonic stem cells or stem cells 
from fetal tissue. Among the issues surrounding such 
research are the questions of when personhood begins, 
government’s role in promoting and regulating stem cell 
research, and who should pay for it.
In this part, we present various religious and moral view-
points on the issue of personhood, explaining the basis 
for various opinions. We also explore how government got 
involved in scientific research and some of the scandals 
that led to today’s best practices for research on human 
subjects. Finally, we dig into the funding debate, showing 
you the roles that private and public money play in stem 
cell research.

Chapter 15
Exploring Ethical, Religious, 
Philosophical, and Moral Questions
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding various definitions of personhood
▶ Following the arguments for and against fetal tissue research
▶ Debating genetic manipulation issues
M
ost people don’t have religious objections to research on cells and 
tissues from plants, microorganisms, animals, or adult humans. 
Although some people strongly object to using animals for research, those 
objections usually aren’t rooted in a particular religious belief. When cells are 
donated by adult humans, protocols exist for obtaining adult human cells and 
tissues: The donor must be informed of the risks and benefits, and consent 
must be voluntary (no coercion and usually no financial incentive to donate 
cells or tissues). The same is true for research on cadavers and tissues from 
deceased persons; as long as the appropriate people — usually next of kin, 
if the deceased left no instructions in the form of a will — give their consent, 
such research is generally considered ethically and morally permissible.
Research on human embryos and fetal tissues, on the other hand, raises a 
host of moral and ethical questions, many of them rooted in certain religious 
viewpoints and philosophies about who is and is not a “person,” and when 
human life “begins.” Some people see personhood as an absolute — that is, 
they believe a zygote (the fusion of an egg cell and sperm cell) has a soul and 
full rights as a human being. Others see personhood as a process or contin-
uum — something that comes along with development in the womb, but that 
doesn’t immediately occur at conception. The distinction between “living and 
human,” which describes all kinds of cells and tissues, and “living human,” in 
the sense of a “person,” also is part of the debate.
In this chapter, we explore perspectives on personhood and the “living 
and human,” distinction, the issue of “cooperating with evil,” and concerns 
sparked by the technologies stem cell scientists use in their research.

234
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
 
We don’t offer black-and-white answers to the questions raised here; we can’t 
because the answers depend so much on personal beliefs. We present various 
points of view as honestly and as objectively as possible, but we leave the 
hard part — deciding which answers, if any, make sense — up to you.
Deciding When Personhood Begins
The real question in using human embryos for research isn’t when life begins. 
Most people, including those in the scientific community, agree that life 
begins at conception, when an egg cell and sperm cell fuse to form a zygote. 
The real question is the moral status of that life — that is, society’s inherent 
obligations to respect and protect the rights, needs, interests, and well-being 
of zygotes, blastocysts, fetuses, babies, and adults. Is an 8-cell embryo as 
much a person — an individual human being, entitled to life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness — as an 8-year-old child? What about an 8-week-old 
embryo? Where do you draw the line between “just a collection of cells” and 
the full rights of personhood?
 
In the United States, there is no overarching legal definition of personhood, or 
even of what constitutes a human being. While the Constitution refers to “per-
sons” several times, neither Congress nor the U.S. Supreme Court has ever 
defined the point at which an individual becomes a full-fledged person with all 
the rights of personhood.
Even in Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision on abortion, the 
justices avoided defining personhood. “We need not resolve the difficult 
question of when life begins,” Justice Harry Blackmun wrote in the majority 
opinion. “When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, phi-
losophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, 
at this point in the development of man’s knowledge, is not in a position to 
speculate as to the answer.” The rationale for allowing abortion without any 
state restrictions in the first trimester was based on centuries of common law 
that distinguished between early pregnancy and quickening — the first recog-
nizable movement of a fetus in the womb.
For many people and many religions, the issue of personhood revolves 
around when an embryo is infused with a soul. Some believe the soul is cre-
ated at conception; others believe it happens later in development. The fol-
lowing sections examine some common definitions of personhood and the 
distinction between what is “living and human” and what is a “living human.”
Considering definitions of personhood
Attempts to define personhood date back at least to Aristotle. The ancient 
philosopher thought that developing fetuses had three souls — a vegetative 

235
 Chapter 15: Exploring Ethical, Religious, Philosophical, and Moral Questions
soul that was present at conception, an animal soul that appeared after 40 days 
of development in males and after 80 days of development in females, and a 
rational soul, acquired at birth. Aristotle’s theory of mediate animation — that 
is, that individuals only gradually move toward self-awareness in the womb — 
was nearly universally accepted for centuries. Until the 1800s, even the Roman 
Catholic Church taught that ensoulment was a process, not a single event or 
point in time, in the womb.
Some religions still subscribe to some version of gradual ensoulment; others 
teach that ensoulment occurs at conception. The following sections explain 
how various religions answer the question of when an embryo becomes a 
person.
 
Many religious groups have taken official positions on human embryonic stem 
cell research, but members of those faiths don’t always agree with the official 
positions of their religious leaders. See the nearby sidebar, “Official religious 
positions on stem cell research,” for specific positions of major religious groups.
The Catholic viewpoint
Since the 1800s, the Roman Catholic Church’s doctrine on personhood has 
held that each human being has a unique soul from the moment of concep-
tion, and therefore even embryos in the earliest stages of development 
have the same inviolable right to life as infants, children, and adults. The 
Vatican reaffirmed this view in 2008 when it released the Instruction Dignitas 
Personae on Certain Bioethical Questions:
“The originality of every person is a consequence of the particular relationship 
that exists between God and a human being from the first moment of his 
existence and carries with it the obligation to respect the singularity and 
integrity of each person, even on the biological and genetic levels.”
Not all Catholics adhere to this view, however. Polls indicate that a majority 
of Catholic laypeople support human embryonic stem cell research as long 
as the cells are derived from excess blastocysts created for in vitro fertiliza-
tion and not from embryos created solely for research. And testimony before 
the National Bioethics Advisory Commission in the late 1990s suggested that 
“a growing number of Catholic moral theologians” dispute the idea that per-
sonhood occurs at conception.
 
The Vatican doesn’t oppose all stem cell research. In fact, it explicitly sup-
ports research on cells and tissues from adults, umbilical cord blood, and 
“fetuses who have died of natural causes.” However, the Catholic Church 
opposes any research, treatment, or process that harms or creates embryos, 
including in vitro fertilization (because it replaces the “natural reproduc-
tive act” and results in excess blastocysts that are doomed to be destroyed 
through research or simple discarding), cloning for both therapeutic and 
reproductive purposes, and creating human-animal chimeras. (See “Looking 
at the Ethical Views of Creating Embryos, Clones, and Chimeras,” later in this 
chapter.)

Official religious positions on stem cell research
In 2008, the Pew Forum on Religion and Public 
Life surveyed major religious groups for their 
positions on all forms of stem cell research. At 
the time, a slim majority of Americans (51 per-
cent) supported embryonic stem cell research, 
and a third equated the process of deriving 
embryonic stem cells with murder. Following 
is a summary of the Pew Forum’s findings. 
Remember, not all followers of a particular reli-
gion subscribe to their leaders’ official positions.
American Baptist Churches USA: No official 
position; “one must be guided by one’s own 
relationship with God and Scripture.”
Buddhism: No official position. Embryonic stem 
cell research brings two Buddhist teachings 
into direct conflict — the tenet of ahimsa, which 
prohibits harming or destroying others, and the 
tenet of prajna, the pursuit of knowledge.
Episcopal Church: The General Convention 
supports embryonic stem cell research as long 
as the blastocysts were created for fertility 
treatments, would be destroyed in any case, 
and aren’t bought or sold.
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America: A 
task force has been studying biotechnology and 
genetics and is scheduled to issue its report in 
2011. In the meantime, the church has taken no 
official position on stem cell research.
Hinduism: No official position.
Islam: Traditionally, Islam teaches that the soul 
doesn’t enter the developing fetus until 120 
days after conception.
Judaism: All major denominations — 
Conservative, Orthodox, Reconstructionist, and 
Reform — support embryonic and adult stem 
cell research as long as the research is for 
medical or therapeutic purposes.
Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod: Supports 
adult stem cell research but opposes embry-
onic stem cell research.
National Council of Churches: This group, 
whose members include Protestant, Anglican, 
Orthodox, Evangelical, and other denomina-
tions, “neither endorses nor condemns experi-
mentation on human embryos” because a 
committee charged with investigating the issue 
was unable to find a “clear consensus” among 
scientists, ethicists, and academics.
Presbyterian Church (USA): Supports stem cell 
research intended to benefit “those suffering 
from serious illness.”
Roman Catholic Church: The Vatican supports 
research on adult stem cells and tissues, umbil-
ical cord blood and tissues, and on the tissues 
of spontaneously aborted fetuses as long as 
rigorous consent procedures are followed. (The 
Vatican also opposes in vitro fertilization to help 
couples have children because IVF bypasses 
the “normal” conception process.)
Southern Baptist Convention: Opposes destruc-
tion of human embryos and supports “the devel-
opment of alternative treatments which do not 
require human embryos to be killed.”
Unitarian Universalist Association of 
Congregations: Supports embryonic and adult 
stem cell research for therapeutic purposes 
and opposes reproductive cloning.
United Church of Christ: Supports embryonic 
stem cell research as long as the cells come 
from blastocysts that would otherwise be dis-
carded from in vitro fertilization.
United Methodist Church: Supports research, 
including therapeutic cloning, on excess blas-
tocysts from in vitro fertilization, but opposes 
creating embryos solely for research.

237
 Chapter 15: Exploring Ethical, Religious, Philosophical, and Moral Questions
The Jewish viewpoint
Traditional Judaism believes that ensoulment doesn’t occur until after the 
40th day of gestation. Rabbi Elliot Dorff testified before the National Bioethics 
Advisory Commission that
“Genetic materials outside the uterus have no legal status in Jewish law, 
for they are not even a part of a human being until implanted in a woman’s 
womb and even then, during the first 40 days of gestation, their status is ‘as 
if they were water.’”
Under Jewish biblical and Talmudic law, there is no moral prohibition against 
using excess blastocysts from in vitro fertilization for research. In fact, for 
many of the Jewish faith, human embryonic stem cell research may pose 
fewer moral and ethical questions than abortion and research on fetal tissues 
from elective abortions. Human embryonic stem cells are always derived 
before the blastocyst attains personhood in Jewish tradition, while elective 
abortions nearly always occur after 40 days of gestation.
The Protestant viewpoint
Protestant denominations are far from united on the question of person-
hood. Some, like the Southern Baptist Convention and the Lutheran Church–
Missouri Synod (see the nearby sidebar, “Official religious positions on stem 
cell research”), share the Catholic Church’s view that destroying human 
embryos at any stage of development, even to potentially benefit society, is 
morally wrong. Others take an intermediate approach, supporting research 
on excess embryos created for fertility treatments but opposing so-called 
cloning and creating embryos solely for research.
Other religious viewpoints
Several religious groups have yet to take an official position on human 
embryonic stem cell research. But the teachings of these religions provide 
some insight into their view of when an embryo qualifies for personhood, as 
well as potential conflicts within the tenets of the same religion:
 
✓ Buddhism: Human embryonic stem cell research brings two Buddhist 
tenets into direct conflict: respect for all forms of life, however “minor,” 
and pursuit of knowledge and understanding. Some Buddhists believe 
the pursuit of knowledge is a noble cause that trumps the tenet of 
ahimsa, which bars harming or destroying life. Others believe the oppo-
site — that respect for life is paramount.
 
✓ Hindu: Hindus believe in reincarnation, so conception marks the rebirth 
of a soul from its previous life. However, some Hindus believe the fetus 
doesn’t get its soul until between the third and fifth month of development.

238
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
 
✓ Islam: Traditionally, Islam teaches that a developing fetus becomes 
ensouled at 120 days — roughly the same time frame as the ancient 
dividing line of quickening cited in the Roe v. Wade decision. (See the 
section “Deciding When Personhood Begins,” earlier in this chapter.) 
Some Muslims believe destroying human embryos is immoral. As of this 
writing, Islamic leaders haven’t issued any official statements on the 
morality of human embryonic stem cell research. However, most Sunni 
and Shiite theologians support the research, as long as scientists follow 
ethical practices in obtaining the embryos.
 
The idea of a unique soul inhabiting one earthly body is mainly a Western 
European tradition. Hindu, Buddhist, and many Native American cultures 
see the soul as a continuation of a person’s specific spiritual lineage, which 
may entail both one’s ancestors and animal spirits. And many people don’t 
subscribe to any particular religious view of personhood; they may prefer the 
scientific view (see the following section) or reject the idea of a soul, at least 
as envisioned by various religious traditions, entirely.
For some, the potential benefits of embryonic stem cell research outweigh what 
they view as the theoretical personhood of the embryos. Most people who share 
this philosophy draw the line of personhood at a later point in development — 
some while the fetus is still in the womb, and some not until birth.
The Warnock Commission viewpoint
In the 1980s, Great Britain’s Warnock Commission, convened to come up with 
standards for the then-new technique of in vitro fertilization and its attendant 
ethical issues, drew a short timeline between conception and personhood: 
14 days. That’s when the so-called primitive streak appears in a developing 
embryo — a thickening line that eventually gives rise to the nervous system, 
among other bodily structures. When the primitive streak begins to develop, 
the embryo can no longer divide into twins; before that point, every embryo 
has the potential to split into two (or more) distinct embryos. So, the scientific 
argument is that an embryo becomes an individual — a potential person — at 
14 days.
 
Embryonic stem cells are harvested from blastocysts that are three to five 
days old, and the blastocysts have never been implanted in a woman’s uterus. 
Although embryo has several definitions, many scientists place the dividing 
line between embryo and fetus at implantation or shortly thereafter — a dis-
tinction we use throughout this book.
“Living and human” versus “living human”
Another issue that complicates the ethical debate is the distinction between 
cells or tissues that are both human and living, and the collection of cells and 
tissues that constitute living humans.

239
 Chapter 15: Exploring Ethical, Religious, Philosophical, and Moral Questions
Egg cells and sperm cells are living and human. But until they fuse to form 
a zygote, and until the zygote grows sufficiently to form a blastocyst, and 
until the blastocyst embeds in the uterine wall and begins to form the primi-
tive streak that eventually becomes the nervous system, skeleton, and other 
bodily scaffolding, many people believe they can’t be classified as living 
humans.
Likewise, cancer cells are human and living, as are heart cells that beat in 
unison in a Petri dish. But neither is a living human.
Many religious doctrines (see the preceding section) view the zygote as a 
living human. The Catholic Church, in its Instruction Dignitas Personae on 
Certain Bioethical Questions, specifically states that, “The body of a human 
being, from the very first stages of its existence, can never be reduced merely 
to a group of cells.”
Others call viewing zygotes and embryos as full persons “the trap of poten-
tial,” meaning people see what zygotes and embryos can become instead of 
what they actually are at these stages of development. They point out that, 
in the natural course of things, many zygotes and embryos never become 
fetuses, much less full-term babies. Therefore, they argue, zygotes and 
embryos, while living and human, should not be viewed as living humans.
“Cooperating with Evil” — 
Another Ethical Dilemma
When President George W. Bush allowed federal funding for research on 
human embryonic stem cell lines that were created before August 9, 2001, he 
argued that, because those lines already existed, it was ethically and morally 
okay to use them for research. His policy forbade federal funding for research 
on new embryonic stem cell lines, and Congress has prohibited using federal 
money to create new stem cell lines. (President Barack Obama lifted the ban 
on funding research on new stem cell lines, but researchers still can’t use fed-
eral money to actually derive human embryonic stem cells. See Chapter 16 
for more on federal funding rules.)
In announcing his policy, President Bush said he was drawing “at least one 
bright line” in the ethical debate over what’s permissible and what’s not in 
human embryonic stem cell research. But for many people, that “bright line” 
isn’t so clear.

240
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
The Vatican and other groups and individuals condemn human embryonic 
stem cell research, regardless of the source of the stem cell lines, because of 
the moral ban against “cooperation with evil and scandal.” From this point of 
view, induced abortion and the destruction of human embryos are immoral; 
therefore, any research on electively aborted fetal tissue or stem cells 
derived from human embryos is irrevocably tainted.
The same argument has been used in discussing whether it’s ethically accept-
able to build on the findings of Nazi researchers who conducted morally 
reprehensible experiments on concentration camp prisoners. Does using the 
information equal tacit approval of the methods by which it was gained?
On the other hand, is it right to ignore information and opportunities simply 
because you find the way that information or opportunity was created to be 
immoral or unethical? Should people not receive polio vaccine because it was 
developed using fetal tissue? (See the section “Exploring the Questions on 
Fetal Tissue Research,” later in this chapter.) Does a patient who receives a 
kidney or a cornea from a homicide victim implicitly condone murder simply 
by receiving the organ?
Some argue that donating unused blastocysts for research is the moral 
equivalent of donating organs and tissues after death. You don’t have to like 
the fact that someone died in order to appreciate the second chance the 
dead person’s organs and tissues can give to the living. As long as donors — 
of both post-mortem tissues and organs and excess blastocysts — are fully 
informed of what donation means, and as long as they aren’t coerced into 
donation, either through financial incentives or other means, many (if not 
most) scientists and civilians believe such donations — and the research 
or other results, such as organ transplantation — are ethical. (In 2009, New 
York took the controversial step of allowing researchers to pay women who 
donate their eggs; see the nearby sidebar, “Paying women to donate eggs,” 
for more information.)
 
Intention matters, too. If your intention in using donor organs and tissues is 
to save or improve someone else’s life — in other words, to derive a benefit 
from a bad situation (the donor’s death) — then the morality of transplanta-
tion meets the so-called straight face test. This idea of intention is why many 
people view research on excess blastocysts as morally acceptable. In vitro 
fertilization creates more blastocysts than can or will be used to start preg-
nancies, and excess blastocysts are doomed to be destroyed anyway; they’ll 
never be used to start a pregnancy. Instead of discarding them, many people 
both inside and outside the scientific community believe the better choice is 
to use these excess blastocysts to discover as much as possible about normal 
human development and human diseases — and, possibly, discover new 
therapies to treat or cure disease. The intention is to make the best of a bad 
situation (excess blastocysts that will never be used to start a pregnancy).

241
 Chapter 15: Exploring Ethical, Religious, Philosophical, and Moral Questions
James Thomson, whose team first isolated human embryonic stem cells, 
believes the more moral decision is to put excess blastocysts to use in 
research instead of throwing them away. In a 2005 interview on MSNBC, 
Thomson said:
“The bottom line is that there are 400,000 frozen embryos in the United 
States, and a large percentage of those are going to be thrown out. 
Regardless of what you think the moral status of those embryos is, it makes 
sense to me that it’s a better moral decision to use them to help people than 
to just throw them out. It’s a very complex issue, but to me it boils down to 
that one thing.”
Looking at the Ethical Views of Creating 
Embryos, Clones, and Chimeras
Conducting research on extra blastocysts that were created for the purpose 
of initiating a pregnancy is one thing. Creating blastocysts solely in order to 
do research on them is a different ethical issue. The distinction is a fuzzy one 
to some people, but many scientists, politicians, and ordinary citizens feel 
that generating embryos for research is disrespectful of the potential human 
lives those embryos represent.
Paying women to donate eggs
In 2009, New York became the first state to allow 
state money to be used to pay women to donate 
their eggs for research. The Empire State 
Stem Cell Board bucked National Academy 
of Sciences guidelines, which prohibit paying 
women for eggs used in research, saying it’s 
extraordinarily difficult to attract unpaid donors. 
The NAS guidelines permit reimbursement or 
coverage only of the donor’s medical expenses. 
(On the other hand, women are frequently — 
and often lavishly — paid to donate their eggs 
for in vitro fertilization.)
Paying women to donate their eggs for 
research raises some ethical concerns. Does the 
opportunity to get up to $10,000 (the limit in New 
York) for donating eggs put unfair pressure on 
poor women? Is there a moral or ethical dif-
ference between paying donors for eggs for 
research and paying donors for eggs destined 
to be used in fertilization treatments? Is there 
any difference between paying donors for eggs, 
for whatever purpose, and paying donors for a 
pint of blood plasma?
Even with the new state policy, some stem cell 
research centers in New York — including 
Cornell University, Rockefeller University, and 
the Sloan-Kettering Institute — prohibit paying 
women to donate eggs.

242
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
Many people agree that manufacturing large numbers of research embryos — 
which, in stem cell research, are never intended to develop into fetuses and 
are destroyed in the process of creating stem cells — turns potential human 
life into a product, little different from manufacturing a cell phone or a piece 
of clothing. Most scientists, however, regard the prospect of large-scale man-
ufacturing of human embryos solely for research as highly unlikely.
The techniques for creating embryos also raise concerns. Somatic cell 
nuclear transfer (SCNT), for example, uses the nucleus of an adult tissue cell 
and an egg cell from which the nucleus has been removed. (See Chapter 6 for 
more on SCNT.) Scientists in Scotland used this technique to create Dolly, 
the famous cloned sheep. The process holds potential for growing genetically 
compatible replacement tissues for humans, but no one knows whether SCNT 
cells can generate a complete human being. If they could be used to “grow” a 
human being, some see an ethical issue in whether it’s moral to create poten-
tial human life knowing that it never will have the opportunity to develop 
into a fetus or baby. For now, most scientists believe SCNT cells cannot (and 
should not) be used to initiate a normal pregnancy, so the process is a way 
to work with living, human cells and tissues. However, improvements in the 
technique and technology may one day lead to the creation of embryos that 
are capable of developing into normal human babies, so some people find 
SCNT morally disquieting.
 
Some people find SCNT more morally acceptable than using excess IVF blas-
tocysts because SCNT embryos — at least as the technology stands today — 
can’t generate actual, living fetuses. IVF blastocysts, on the other hand, clearly 
can be used to start a pregnancy. So SCNT, some believe, doesn’t raise the 
same ethical problem as IVF.
Altered nuclear transfer (ANT) poses different ethical questions. In this tech-
nique, the function of a genetic element known as CDX2 is blocked in the 
nucleus of the adult tissue cell before it’s fused with the egg cell (see Chapter 
6). Without the function of the CDX2 gene, the embryo doesn’t generate the 
cells it needs to implant in the uterus, so it can’t live for more than a few 
days. (Scientists have tested this technique only in mice, not in humans, by 
the way.) However, ANT mouse embryos survive long enough to harvest the 
inner cells that are used to grow stem cells.
Many people find the idea of creating a crippled embryo — one that’s 
genetically designed to die — even more distasteful than creating normal 
embryos for research purposes. However, because this technique can’t 
generate an implantable fetus, some find it more acceptable than using 
excess IVF blastocysts.
Chimeras, organisms that contain cells or tissues from two or more individu-
als, also raise ethical concerns. (Chapter 7 discusses chimeras in detail.) 

243
 Chapter 15: Exploring Ethical, Religious, Philosophical, and Moral Questions
Scientists regularly create chimeras in the lab — injecting human cells into 
fetal or adult mice, for example, to study diseases and cell interaction. These 
experiments are highly regulated, and, independent of stem cell research, 
scientists have been performing them for years to study cancer, disease biol-
ogy, and other elements of development. In fact, many of the techniques used 
in stem cell research have been utilized for years without controversy or 
even particular notice in the general public. These techniques have yielded 
valuable information both about normal development and about how trans-
planted stem cells behave in a living organism.
But some people (including some scientists) become uneasy at the idea that 
mice — or other test animals — could develop human consciousness. It 
seems extremely unlikely, given what scientists know about brain structure 
and function. But it’s a popular theme in fiction (read Michael Crichton’s 
novel Next for a fictional account of what experiments on chimeras could 
lead to), and some people worry that such a reality isn’t too far off.
The National Academy of Sciences has issued guidelines that prohibit inject-
ing human cells into blastocysts of nonhuman primates (chimps, apes, and 
so on). The guidelines also bar injecting animal or human cells into human 
blastocysts and prohibit breeding of human-animal chimeras (like chimeric 
mice) in case any human cells migrate to the chimera’s gonads and become 
reproductive cells.
 
The National Bioethics Advisory Commission, which studied stem cell 
research from 1996 to 2001 (when its charter expired), recommended against 
federal funding for the creation of research-only embryos. The commission 
noted that public opinion on this issue may eventually change. But in the 
years since the commission was disbanded, the idea of creating embryos 
solely for research purposes has remained a controversial one, even among 
proponents of embryonic stem cell research.
Exploring the Questions on 
Fetal Tissue Research
Scientists have been studying human fetal tissue for at least 80 years (prob-
ably a lot longer; the ancients very likely studied fetal tissue from spontane-
ous abortions), learning about cell biology, the immune system, and other 
features of human development. In 1954, a group of American immunologists 
won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for developing the polio vaccine; their work 
was based on cultures from human fetal kidney cells.

244
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
The Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 raised concerns that more women would 
have abortions if they thought they could donate their fetuses to research. 
In response to those concerns, the federal government enacted extensive 
regulations for informed consent to fetal tissue donation, restrictions on how 
federally funded research could use fetal tissue, and prohibitions on buying 
and selling fetal tissue. And, in fact, studies throughout the past 35 years 
have found no evidence that the option to donate fetal tissue for research 
prompted women to choose abortion more often than they otherwise would.
In the late 1980s, scientists began using fetal cells and tissues in experimen-
tal treatments for Parkinson’s disease, which reignited the ethical debate 
over the use of fetal tissue for research. President Ronald Reagan imposed a 
moratorium on funding for fetal tissue transplant research, and the morato-
rium remained in effect until 1993. That year, President William Clinton lifted 
the moratorium via executive order, and Congress later passed the National 
Institutes of Health Revitalization Act, permitting federal funding of fetal 
transplant research under certain conditions.
Abortion opponents generally also oppose fetal tissue research on the 
grounds that it encourages or legitimizes abortion, which they believe to be 
immoral, and that it creates a commodities market for fetal tissue.
Most abortion opponents, including the Catholic Church, don’t object to 
research on tissues from spontaneous abortions or ectopic or tubal pregnan-
cies (when the embryo embeds in the fallopian tube instead of the uterine 
wall). But they oppose research on tissues from elective abortions. In fact, 
many argue that the woman doesn’t have the right to consent to donating her 
aborted fetus for research because she abdicates her parental responsibili-
ties when she chooses abortion in the first place.
Scientists and proponents of fetal tissue research, on the other hand, point 
out that spontaneous abortions occur when there’s a problem with either the 
fetus or the womb, so the tissues can’t be considered normal. In addition, tis-
sues from spontaneous abortions and ectopic pregnancies are fairly rare and 
hard to come by for research purposes.
Proponents also point out that fetal tissue research has contributed greatly 
to medicine, leading to significant advances in diagnosis and treatment of 
fetal diseases and defects, as well as scientific understanding of the immune 
system, cancer, and transplantation. Fetal tissue research also contributed to 
the development of amniocentesis as a diagnostic tool for discovering poten-
tial problems in fetal development in the womb.
In 1998, Dr. Hannah Kinney, who used fetal tissues to study Sudden Infant 
Death Syndrome (SIDS), testified before Congress about the value of fetal 
tissue research. Four years earlier, public health officials launched the Back 
to Sleep campaign, urging parents to put infants to sleep on their backs 

245
 Chapter 15: Exploring Ethical, Religious, Philosophical, and Moral Questions
instead of their stomachs. Between the start of the campaign and Kinney’s 
testimony, the incidence of SIDS in the United States dropped by 38 percent. 
Kinney testified that
“My research in SIDS brainstems and relevant human fetal brainstem 
development was cited as a major contributing factor to the medical and 
scientific consensus that led to this campaign, as it provided solid biologic 
evidence to support the theory that babies are safer sleeping on their 
backs.”
The Back to Sleep campaign “illustrates how human fetal research can have 
an impact on public health policy and saving lives,” Kinney told Congress.
Understanding the Ethical Concerns 
of Genetic Testing and Manipulation
While fears of creating half-human, half-chimpanzee creatures seem far-
fetched, the ability to manipulate genetic material and test for specific 
genetic traits raises some very real ethical concerns. Some of these concerns 
stem from the history of eugenics, the idea of using of selective breeding, 
forced sterilization, and other techniques to promote certain traits and sup-
press others.
Some people also are concerned that genetic testing — particularly pre-
implantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD, on blastocysts created for in vitro 
fertilization — may lead to a generation of so-called “designer babies,” with 
parents choosing to discard blastocysts that don’t exhibit the desired genes 
for gender, hair and eye color, athletic ability, or intelligence.
Tracing the history of eugenics
The term eugenics dates back to the 1800s, but the idea of promoting desir-
able human traits and suppressing undesirable characteristics stretches all 
the way back to Plato. The Roman philosopher proposed a “marriage lottery” 
in which government officials would match “high-quality” men and women 
and encourage them to have children, who presumably would be some sort 
of super-offspring, embodying the best traits of their parents.
The idea that qualities like intelligence can be inherited (a still-controversial 
subject — studies of identical twins have shown that genetically identical 
people aren’t intellectually identical, but the question is by no means settled) 
lies at the root of virtually every social class system in virtually every culture 
throughout human history. It’s also the basis of much of racism.

246
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
In the United States, eugenics took off in the late 19th and early 20th centu-
ries. Connecticut lawmakers barred anyone who was “epileptic, imbecile or 
feeble-minded” from marrying as early as 1896. In 1907, Indiana became the 
first state — but unfortunately not the last, as more than 30 states eventu-
ally adopted similar laws — to mandate forced sterilization of certain people. 
Virginia applied its forced sterilization law to patients in state mental institu-
tions — a practice that continued in the United States until the 1970s. Over 
the decades, some 60,000 Americans were sterilized against their will.
Even more horrifying, the Nazi government in Germany widely cited 
American eugenics and sterilization laws as proof that sterilization programs 
to prevent undesirable characteristics from being passed on to a new genera-
tion were both effective and humane. At the Nuremberg war trials after World 
War II, Nazi administrators claimed eugenics policies in the United States 
inspired them to sterilize more than 450,000 people.
With this kind of history, it’s not surprising that some people are uneasy, if 
not outright alarmed, at scientists’ ability to manipulate human genes in the 
lab. A century ago, eugenics supporters were convinced that they had figured 
out a way to “improve” humankind, and most of them never envisioned the 
evils of the Holocaust. Opponents of genetic manipulation worry about the 
unintended consequences of such work.
 
People — and nature, for that matter — have been manipulating genetic 
material for centuries. Cross-pollination creates genetically modified plants; 
cross-breeding of dogs creates so-called designer breeds like Labradoodles 
(Labrador-poodle mixes) and Cockapoos (cocker spaniel-poodle mixes). 
(See Chapter 7 for more on various methods of mixing and matching genetic 
material.) Although some controversy exists over genetically modified foods 
and other “messing about” with genetics (also discussed in Chapter 7), these 
processes have proven useful in diagnostics, drug development, and ideas for 
new therapies for serious diseases.
Scientists see genetic manipulation as an incredibly useful tool for under-
standing how human development works, both normally and in disease. They 
commonly fuse cells and genetic material from humans and other animals 
in the lab — and have been doing so for decades — to see how cells grow 
and multiply and how they operate in a living organism. They inject diseased 
cells into mice to observe how the disease progresses and how the mouse’s 
immune system responds. And they test potential therapies to turn the 
appropriate genetic material on or off.
 
The focus of genetic manipulation in the lab is to understand what goes wrong 
in disease and figure out ways to fix it or treat it. No one in stem cell science is 
looking to create a “master race.” In fact, most scientists don’t think it can be 
done, even if it were ethically permissible.

247
 Chapter 15: Exploring Ethical, Religious, Philosophical, and Moral Questions
Looking at genetic testing
Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD, also raises the specter of eugen-
ics and Nazi Germany. PGD allows parents to decide whether to implant a 
blastocyst that may carry a genetic defect. For example, deaf parents under-
going in vitro fertilization may opt to have their blastocysts tested for con-
genital deafness and discard those that carry the genetic determinants for 
deafness. (Chapter 6 discusses PGD in more detail.)
The Catholic Church vehemently opposes PGD, calling it a form of “biologi-
cal slavery.” In the 2008 Instruction, Dignitas Personae on Certain Bioethical 
Questions, the Vatican asserts that PGD is “the expression of a eugenic men-
tality that accepts selective abortion in order to prevent the birth of children 
affected by various types of anomalies . . . thus opening the way to legitimiz-
ing infanticide and euthanasia as well.”
PGD can raise heart-wrenching ethical dilemmas for prospective parents, 
too. Couples who undergo fertility treatments are highly motivated by the 
desire to have children. Those who opt for PGD typically want to make sure 
that the blastocyst is healthy; often, they want to ensure that the blastocyst 
doesn’t carry the genetic markers that one or both of the parents carries for 
a specific disease. For example, the genetic mutations that cause Alzheimer’s 
disease to appear in your 30s or Huntington’s disease to appear in your 40s 
are dominant genes — only one copy of the gene is enough to give you the 
disease. So, for the parents, the question is whether to test blastocysts for 
those genetic markers and, if they do, rejecting the blastocysts that carry the 
markers can induce overwhelming feelings of guilt.
Dissecting the Goals of 
Stem Cell Research
Responsible stem cell scientists — which is to say nearly all of them — aren’t 
interested in creating designer babies or humanzees (a cross between humans 
and chimps). They are interested in learning as much as they can about how 
normal human development and human tissues work and what goes wrong in 
disease. If scientists can figure out how things are supposed to work, they may 
be able to come up with fixes for times when things don’t work the way they’re 
supposed to. That fundamental interest is why there’s broad consensus in the 
scientific community about the need to study all kinds of stem cells from all 
sources — embryos, fetal tissues, and adult tissues.

248
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
Like anyone committed to his job in any other field, stem cell scientists and 
physicians want to be able to do their jobs well and to provide the best 
benefits in the long run. So they want to discover new principles and under-
standing of how the body works and find new practical applications to treat 
disease.
To do their jobs well, and to have the broadest range of opportunities for 
making valuable discoveries and coming up with potential therapies, stem 
cell scientists need the following:
 
✓ A genetically diverse pool of cells and tissues to work with
 
✓ Reliable ways of isolating, purifying, and studying many different types 
of stem cells
 
✓ Ethical standards to prevent misuse and abuse of stem cell technologies
 
✓ Time and money with which to do their research and experiments
No one in the scientific community thinks it’s likely that researchers will find 
a cure for Alzheimer’s or heart disease next week, or even next year. Even as 
exciting and optimistic reports of successful stem cell therapies dominate the 
news, most scientists believe they’re 10 or 20 years away from the kinds of 
breakthroughs that will move most of these therapies beyond the experimen-
tal stage. On the other hand, tremendous breakthroughs could come at any 
time, if responsible research has political and financial support.
In the meantime, although deep divisions between those who support embry-
onic stem cell research and those who believe the research violates basic 
human rights are likely to remain unresolved, some people on all sides of the 
debate are seeking a reasonable balance that will allow important research to 
continue without turning human life into a product or commodity.

T
he news seems to be full of stem cell headlines these days — elected 
officials announcing new stem cell policies, researchers announcing new 
stem cell developments, and proponents and opponents of stem cell research 
making their cases in front of lawmakers, the media, and the public.
Sorting out all these announcements and opinions can be confusing. What’s 
allowed, and what’s not? What are the rules, and what do changes in the 
rules mean? And how do governments and researchers balance scientific 
inquiry against the ethics of conducting research on human beings, cells, and 
tissues?
The answers aren’t always easy to come by, mainly because both the politi-
cal and scientific landscapes are continually shifting and evolving. In this 
chapter, we explore government’s role in supporting and regulating research 
and provide a brief recap of federal policies regarding stem cell research. 
We explain how disagreements about abortion affect the political debate and 
attitudes toward stem cell science, and the role incorrect assumptions about 
science in general have played in public policy.
We also offer an overview of the policies that individual states and other 
countries have adopted as of this writing. And we look at the guidelines the 
U.S. National Academy of Sciences and International Society for Stem Cell 
Research have recommended to promote responsible and ethical research 
practices.

Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
 
The greatest current controversy in stem cell research is tied to the derivation 
and use of human embryonic stem cells. Most people agree that research on 
human adult (or tissue) stem cells is ethical as long as it’s carried out respon-
sibly, and few object to research on either embryonic or adult stem cells in 
mice. The history, politics, and policies we cover here relate to human embry-
onic stem cells, unless noted otherwise.
Exploring the Relationship between 
Science and Government
In the United States, World War II marked a significant shift in government 
attitudes toward (and practical support of) scientific research. Before the 
1940s, the federal government had set up a handful of limited research 
functions in certain agencies, such as the Department of Agriculture. But 
most research was done in universities and the private sector, often 
attracting little public notice and seldom incurring governmental regulation 
or oversight.
As the war in Europe progressed and U.S. involvement grew more likely, 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Office of Scientific Research and 
Development to promote and coordinate research in medicine and weap-
onry. By 1944, the federal government was paying for 75 percent of the coun-
try’s scientific research.
To help allay scientists’ concerns about working for the government, the 
Office of Scientific Research and Development — the forerunner of today’s 
National Science Foundation — contracted with universities and private 
research facilities instead of hiring researchers directly. This arm’s-length 
arrangement allowed scientists to accept public funding without fearing 
undue government interference in their research activities.
Since the National Science Foundation was established in 1950, the government 
has had four main duties in supporting scientific research and development:
 
✓ Providing funding
 
✓ Encouraging basic research and innovation
 
✓ Regulating for safety
 
✓ Restricting questionable practices
Stem cell research — particularly research using human embryonic stem 
cells, in vitro fertilization, and other techniques to generate stem cells (see 
Chapter 6) — presents some unique challenges to these governmental 
duties. Since the 1970s, Congress has banned the use of federal funding for 
any human embryo research; many fertility treatments and techniques like 

251
 Chapter 16: Getting a Handle on Current Stem Cell Laws and Policies
in vitro fertilization (see Chapter 2) were developed with private monies. 
Because of the federal ban on funding, basic research and clinical research 
(what little there is) on early-stage human embryos and in vitro fertilization 
clinical practice and delivery have been carried out mainly in universities 
and the private sector, without national regulations governing safety or ethi-
cal considerations.
Although the National Institutes of Health issued its first guidelines on human 
embryonic stem cell research in 2000, President George W. Bush put those 
guidelines on ice in 2001 when he announced a new federal policy on fund-
ing for human embryonic stem cell research. Under Bush’s policy, federal 
funding became available for human embryonic stem cell research for the 
first time. But his policy didn’t include any national ethical guidelines for 
either conducting the research or for donating human embryos for stem cell 
research. In fact, the only real guideline in Bush’s policy was that research-
ers could use federal money to study human embryonic stem cells that were 
created from excess IVF blastocysts (see Chapter 4) before he announced 
his policy. Any human embryonic stem cell lines (collections of cells derived 
from a single blastocyst) that were derived after his announcement were 
ineligible for federal funding. At the time, the Bush Administration thought 
several dozen embryonic stem cell lines existed, but only a handful actually 
became available and were useful for stem cell research.
In 2009, President Barack Obama eliminated the Bush Administration’s 
“made before” restriction on human embryonic stem cells that are eligible for 
federal funding. At the same time, Obama initiated a formal review and ethi-
cal guideline development process, which resulted in much more stringent 
ethical guidelines for donation procedures and research than had been in 
place under Bush’s policy. (See the section “Understanding General Political 
Pressures,” later in this chapter.) Since 2001, scientists (using nonfederal 
funding) have generated new embryonic stem cell lines that have valuable 
properties; researchers hope many of these new lines will be eligible for fed-
eral funding under the Obama Administration’s policies.
In the following sections, we explain how stem cell research fits in with the 
government’s roles in supporting science — and where gaps still remain, 
despite recent policy changes.
Looking at the relationship between 
funding and regulation in the United States
The American system of funding and regulating scientific research differs from 
many regions of the world. While some countries maintain strict oversight of 
research, the federal government in the United States doesn’t regulate every-
thing that goes on in every lab. In general, unless there’s an issue with human 

252
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
safety or interstate commerce, the federal government takes a hands-off 
approach to research operations.
However, when the federal government funds specific types of research, that 
funding often brings with it a number of regulations about how the funds 
can be used and the criteria and restrictions associated with the funding. 
When the federal government gets involved in funding embryonic stem cell 
research, scientists face a great many restrictions on what they can — and 
mostly what they cannot — do with human embryos, cells, fetal tissues, and 
so on.
When federal funds aren’t involved, there are often far fewer restrictions — 
and sometimes there aren’t any restrictions at all. That’s why, as long as you 
aren’t using federal dollars, you can do pretty much anything you want in 
research on human embryos, cells, and fetal tissues. For researchers who don’t 
use federal money, regulation comes mainly from the state and local govern-
ments (if there’s any regulation at all).
This peculiarity in the American system is why in vitro fertilization clinics are 
so lightly regulated. The technology was developed without federal money, 
and federal regulations still prohibit funding IVF research and clinical prac-
tice, so regulation and oversight of IVF clinics generally fall to state and local 
governments.
The good thing about the American system is that the federal government 
doesn’t intrude much into scientific research. But the flip side of that coin is 
that, when the federal government doesn’t provide money, something of a 
regulatory vacuum exists because there’s no guaranteed level of consistency 
among state and local regulations.
Providing funding
Before World War II, the federal government spent less than $70 million a 
year on science. In 2009, the National Science Foundation asked Congress for 
nearly $7 billion “to advance the frontiers of research and education in sci-
ence and engineering.”
The National Science Foundation isn’t the only agency that funds scientific 
research. The fiscal 2010 budget for the federal government included $31 
billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the source of most federal 
stem cell research funding. In 2008, NIH provided $88 million to help finance 
260 projects that used human embryonic stem lines that complied with the 
Bush Administration’s policy.
However, even though NIH has been funding some human embryonic stem cell 
research since 2001, some long-standing and confusing funding restrictions 
remain in effect. For example, although President Obama lifted the ban on 

253
 Chapter 16: Getting a Handle on Current Stem Cell Laws and Policies
federal funding for certain types of human embryonic stem cell research, 
Congress continues to impose a ban on federal funding for any research in which 
human embryos are created or destroyed. (See the nearby sidebar, “The Dickey-
Wicker amendment.”) However, as a result of a legal decision in the late 1990s, 
NIH has determined that the embryonic stem cells themselves aren’t subject to 
the ban. (That’s the current interpretation of the law, but pending court cases 
challenging that interpretation may change the rules for federal funding yet 
again.)
Here’s a brief recap of federal rules on funding human embryonic research, 
including embryonic stem cell research, since the early 1970s:
1973: In response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, which 
prohibited states from outlawing abortion in the first two trimesters of preg-
nancy, Congress bans federal funding for research on embryos, fetuses, and 
embryonic or fetal tissue.
1974: Congress extends the federal funding ban to research on infertility, 
fertility treatments, and prenatal diagnosis. The U.S. Department of Health, 
Education, and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services) 
continues a moratorium on research involving human fetal tissue.
1979: A national Ethics Advisory Board recommends allowing federal fund-
ing for research on in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer within 14 days 
of conception, but the Department of Health and Human Services rejects the 
recommendations.
1980: The Ethics Advisory Board’s charter and funding expire, and no 
other federal governmental body has ever been created to review proposed 
research protocols for human embryo research.
1987: Researchers ask the National Institutes of Health to fund Parkinson’s 
disease research that involves transplanting fetal neural cells into patients’ 
brains. The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, 
withholds its approval of the funding.
1989: The Department of Health and Human Services’ moratorium on funding 
research on human fetal tissue is extended indefinitely amid concerns that 
such research would prompt an increase in abortions.
1990: Congress passes legislation overriding the DHHS moratorium, but 
President George H.W. Bush vetoes the bill.
1993: President Bill Clinton issues an executive order lifting the moratorium 
on federal funding of fetal tissue research.

254
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
1995: Congress bans federal funding for human embryo research — a 
ban still in effect as of 2009. The legislation, known as the Dickey-Wicker 
Amendment (for Congressmen Jay Dickey and Roger Wicker, who first intro-
duced it), has been added to every appropriations bill involving NIH funding 
since 1995. The amendment also prevents the federal government from fund-
ing clinical research on in vitro fertilization, as well as research to improve 
IVF practices. (See the nearby sidebar, “The Dickey–Wicker amendment,” for 
the complete text of the ban.)
1997: President Clinton establishes the National Bioethics Advisory 
Commission in response to an announcement that a biotech company had 
inserted a human nucleus into a cow egg cell. The commission was charged 
with investigating research practices and crafting guidelines for ethical 
practices, but none of the commission’s recommendations was ever 
implemented.
2000: Because the Dickey–Wicker amendment doesn’t specify whether its 
ban applies to cells already derived from an embryo, the federal government 
decides that it can fund research on already-derived cells (arguing that cells 
aren’t embryos). NIH can’t finance extraction of cells from human blasto-
cysts or any research involving the embryos themselves. However, because 
the cells, after they’ve been extracted, are legally defined as different from 
embryos, researchers with NIH funds can study human embryonic stem cells 
that were generated with nonfederal dollars.
2001: President George W. Bush announces that NIH can fund research on 
human embryonic stem cell lines that were created before August 9, 2001, as 
long as the cells came from blastocysts that were left over from in vitro fer-
tilization treatments. This announcement clarifies which human embryonic 
stem cells can be used under federal funding rules, but provides virtually 
no regulation or even guidance on ethical practices for embryonic stem cell 
research.
2009: President Barack Obama lifts the Bush Administration’s “made-before” 
restriction on which human embryonic stem cell lines are eligible for federal 
funding and orders a formal process for developing ethical guidelines for 
research practices and donation protocols. The funding restrictions of the 
Dickey–Wicker Amendment remain in place. Researchers who want to use 
federal grants cannot derive stem cells from human blastocysts themselves; 
they may only use federal funds to conduct research on stem cells obtained 
from leftover blastocysts from fertility clinics (and only if those fertility 
clinics don’t use federal funds to create or destroy embryos). The Dickey–
Wicker amendment prohibits using federal funds to create or destroy human 
embryos for research, regardless of the technique. And, for research to qual-
ify for federal funding, embryonic stem cells must be derived from excess IVF 
blastocysts that were created for fertility treatments, not research purposes.

255
 Chapter 16: Getting a Handle on Current Stem Cell Laws and Policies
 
The only way the president can overturn the Dickey–Wicker Amendment is to 
veto any legislation it’s attached to — which means the president would have 
to veto the appropriations bill that includes NIH funding every single year. 
Even then, presidential vetoes are subject to override by a two-thirds majority 
vote in Congress — 66 votes in the Senate, and 290 votes in the House of 
Representatives. Of course, Congress can decide to drop the amendment, but 
so far has chosen not to.
 
Ironically, despite congressional bans and the DHHS moratorium, researchers 
using federal funds — many of them at federal agencies — have conducted 
valuable research on fetal tissue for several years.
The Dickey–Wicker amendment
Congress has attached the Dickey–Wicker 
amendment to every appropriations bill (legis-
lation that authorizes the government to spend 
money) affecting NIH funding since 1995. The 
2009 text of the amendment reads:
 
 “None of the funds made available in this 
Act may be used for — (1) the creation of 
a human embryo or embryos for research 
purposes; or (2) research in which a human 
embryo or embryos are destroyed, dis-
carded, or knowingly subjected to risk of 
injury or death greater than that allowed for 
research on fetuses in utero under . . . the 
Public Health Service Act. . . . For purposes 
of this section, the term ‘‘human embryo or 
embryos’’ includes any organism, not pro-
tected as a human subject under (federal 
law) as of the date of the enactment of this 
Act, that is derived by fertilization, parthe-
nogenesis, cloning, or any other means 
from one or more human gametes or human 
diploid cells.”
Gametes are egg and sperm cells. Diploid cells 
contain two sets of chromosomes — one set 
from each parent — so the amendment bans 
research on a single-celled zygote (the fusion 
of an egg cell and a sperm cell) as well as any 
subsequent stage of embryonic development.
The amendment’s language clearly bans cre-
ating human embryos for research purposes. 
However, it doesn’t ban research on cells 
derived from human embryos, as long as fed-
eral funds aren’t used to create the embryonic 
stem cells. Thus, the federal government ruled 
in 2000 that the law allows it to fund research on 
human embryonic stem cells (because the cells 
themselves aren’t embryos), but forbids it from 
funding the actual process of deriving the stem 
cells. (See Chapter 4 for more on how scientists 
derive human embryonic stem cells.)
The Dickey–Wicker amendment doesn’t 
address research on fetal tissues, which are 
obtained from spontaneous or induced abor-
tions. Thus, several federal agencies have con-
ducted or funded such research using federal 
money. The National Cancer Institute and the 
National Institute of Diabetes and Kidney and 
Digestive Diseases (both part of the NIH), for 
example, have used cultured cell lines from 
human fetal tissue to study insulin-like growth 
factors. The Veterans Administration has used 
similar methods to research genetic factors 
in Wilms’ tumor, a type of childhood kidney 
cancer. And the Environmental Protection 
Agency has used fetal tissue to study chemi-
cals, viruses, and radiation that can cause birth 
defects.

256
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
Universities around the country also have used federal funds to pay for basic 
research on human fetal cells and tissues.
 
For our purposes throughout this book, we use embryo to refer to stages of 
development from zygote up to blastocyst (see Chapter 4) — that is, stages 
that haven’t yet implanted in a woman’s uterus. We use fetus to refer to stages 
after implantation and generally after 8 weeks of development.
Encouraging basic research and innovation
You can think of basic research as the pursuit of knowledge to understand 
how things work — including how the human body works. Applied research 
is aimed at finding useful applications of knowledge. You may study how the 
bee brain works and how genes control bee behavior, for example; that’s 
basic research. But if you want to increase honey production, your research 
may focus on ways to improve how bee colonies work together; that’s 
applied research.
Critics of human embryonic stem cell research argue that the research has 
yielded no practical applications in the decade since the cells were isolated, 
while adult stem cell research has led to several real-world treatments, 
including bone marrow transplants. In a limited sense, the critics are right: 
As of today, no tried-and-true medical therapies are based on human embry-
onic stem cell research. Some adult stem cell therapies have been proven 
effective in treating certain conditions (see Chapter 5), but neither adult nor 
embryonic stem cell research has yet produced therapies for many of the ail-
ments that scientists seek to understand and treat.
The critics also fail to note that researchers have been working with adult 
stem cells for decades, while embryonic stem cell research is still in its early 
stages. In biomedical science, research follows a continuum from basic — the 
discovery stage, when researchers figure out how things work — to transla-
tional (when researchers explore how they can use their new knowledge to 
unlock the secrets of disease or create new therapies) to clinical (how actual 
human patients respond to new therapies). For most diseases, research on 
both adult and embryonic stem cells is in the early stages, and both show 
great promise for the future, in the opinion of most researchers.
Industry is typically more interested in applied research that leads to prof-
its, and, in general, companies’ investment in basic research has been on a 
decline since the 1980s. Government funding supports researchers who are 
pursuing important ideas that don’t necessarily have immediate or obvious 
commercial applications.
Companies are cropping up to invest in various aspects of stem cell research 
with the goal of applying that research to the development of products — 
useful drugs or therapies that can be sold commercially and thus generate 

257
 Chapter 16: Getting a Handle on Current Stem Cell Laws and Policies
profits. And, as is the case in other medical science areas, academic institu-
tions and industry are forming partnerships for stem cell research — a model 
that has great growth potential as the field expands.
 
Basic research is essential because it has long-term value and, without it, 
most attempts at making useful technology and products would fail. However, 
because basic research offers no immediate profit, industrial funding can be 
hard to come by (although lots of private foundations finance basic research). 
Government fills the void by investing in basic research without pressuring 
scientists to come up with a profitable application for their findings.
When it comes to human stem cells, the federal government has drawn a 
bright line between the kinds of research it encourages (through funding) 
and the kinds it doesn’t want to be involved with.
Federally fundable stem cell research includes
 
✓ Basic and applied research on all types of animal stem cells and tissues, 
and on human fetal and adult tissue
 
✓ Basic research on embryonic stem cells, as long as the research team 
receiving the federal funding doesn’t destroy embryos themselves (or 
create embryos for research purposes), and as long as the cells come 
solely from leftover blastocysts that were created for fertility treatments 
and meet stringent NIH ethical review criteria
 
✓ Applied research on embryonic stem cells, as long as the cells meet the 
conditions specified for basic research
The federal government won’t currently fund stem cell research that includes
 
✓ Actually deriving stem cells from human blastocysts (researchers can 
obtain stem cells that were generated without federal funding from 
other labs but can’t use federal funds to derive their own stem cells)
 
✓ Using stem cells derived from nuclear transfer (cloning) or parthenogen-
esis techniques (see Chapter 6) or from blastocysts created solely for 
research purposes
 
✓ Any research that involves transplanting human stem cells into blasto-
cysts from chimpanzees, apes, or other nonhuman primates
 
✓ Any research that involves breeding animals with human germ lines 
(female egg cells or male sperm cells)
 
Researchers can apply for federal funding to study human embryonic stem 
cells, but not embryos themselves. The NIH determined that cells don’t violate 
the Dickey-Wicker Amendment (see the preceding section) because the cells 
themselves aren’t embryos. However, privately funded labs aren’t fettered 
by the Dickey-Wicker Amendment or federal policies. The nearby sidebar, 
“Generating research embryos in private labs,” explains what some research-
ers have done without federal funding.

258
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
Regulating for safety
Whether research is publicly or privately funded, the government applies 
regulations designed to ensure that the research — and any resulting applica-
tions like drugs or other medical therapies — are safe.
Safety regulations come from several federal departments and agencies. The 
Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
oversees workplace conditions, for example. In laboratories, OSHA regula-
tions require certain safety precautions, such as the use of gloves and safety 
glasses, as well as training workers on the proper handling and use of poten-
tially hazardous materials.
Generating research embryos in private labs
Federal rules against creating human embryos 
solely for research purposes don’t apply to the 
private sector. Most privately funded labs use 
excess IVF blastocysts to generate embryonic 
stem cells — the only source of human embry-
onic stem cells that researchers may study 
using federal funds under current regulations. 
However, a few private labs have been experi-
menting (and continue to do so) with creating 
so-called research embryos to generate embry-
onic stem cell lines.
In July 2001, the Jones Institute, a private fer-
tility clinic in Virginia, announced that it had 
created human embryos for research, using 
young, healthy egg and sperm donors who 
weren’t undergoing any fertility treatments. 
Researchers at the Jones Institute argued that 
unused blastocysts from fertility treatments 
often aren’t usable for research because the 
donors typically are older and their blastocysts 
often don’t develop well. However, of the 110 
blastocysts Jones scientists created from 
younger, healthy donors’ cells, only 3 yielded 
stem cell lines.
A few months after the Jones Institute made 
its announcement, Massachusetts-based 
Advanced Cell Technology announced that it 
used adult cells to generate human embryos 
that were genetically almost identical to the 
adult cell donors (sometimes called cloning 
or nuclear transfer technology) as part of its 
efforts to grow cells that would be compatible 
with the donor. In 2006, the company announced 
it had developed a method to make a stem cell 
line by extracting a single cell from an eight-cell 
embryo (see Chapter 4) without destroying the 
embryo itself.
Under current rules, federally funded research-
ers can’t use these stem cells from either the 
Jones Institute or Advanced Cell Technology 
because, for the time being, both firms are 
creating embryos solely for research pur-
poses. However, if the technique of extracting 
a single cell from an eight-cell embryo without 
destroying the embryo works on a large scale, 
scientists may be able to use the technique for 
federally funded research. (Even so, the tech-
nique raises moral and ethical questions about 
possibly endangering embryos by removing a 
single cell; see Chapter 15 for a more thorough 
discussion of the ethical issues surrounding 
human embryonic stem cell research.)

259
 Chapter 16: Getting a Handle on Current Stem Cell Laws and Policies
The Food and Drug Administration requires researchers and companies to 
prove their products are safe and effective before they sell those products 
to the public. (See Chapter 10 for more on how drugs are developed.) The 
NIH regulates the use of animals, human subjects, and biohazardous materi-
als in research it funds, and the Department of Energy regulates the use of 
radioactive materials, which are often used in stem cell and other biomedical 
research laboratories.
Restricting questionable practices
Until the 1960s, no federal agency regulated research on human subjects. The 
Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, often cited as the first regulation regarding 
ethical research practices on humans, was really a consumer protection law 
that emphasized proper labeling rather than restricting research practices.
In the 1960s and 1970s, public outrage over a series of really cruel and 
egregious research projects eventually prompted Congress to enact laws 
designed to protect people from becoming unwitting or unwilling partici-
pants in scientific research. The high-profile scandals included the infamous 
Tuskegee Syphilis Study, the Willowbrook hepatitis study, and the Jewish 
Chronic Disease Hospital cancer study — all of which violated today’s stan-
dards of voluntary participation, informed consent, reasonable risk-benefit 
ratios, and peer review.
For example, at the Nuremberg trials after World War II, 23 German doctors 
and administrators were accused of conducting medical experiments on 
thousands of concentration camp prisoners without the prisoners’ consent. 
Many died from the experiments, and many others suffered permanent physi-
cal damage. The Nuremberg Code, established in 1948 as a result of the rev-
elations from the trial, was the first major international document advocating 
that participants in research studies must take part voluntarily and must be 
apprised of the risks — a concept called informed consent. But it took nearly 
30 years and other instances of unethical research practices for the U.S. 
Congress to adopt the principles of the Nuremberg Code as law.
One of the best-known scandals is the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, in which the 
U.S. Public Health Service monitored 600 African-American men, 400 of whom 
had syphilis, for 40 years. The infected men weren’t told about their disease, 
and, even though penicillin was known to cure syphilis in the 1950s, the men 
in the study weren’t told about or offered treatment. In some cases, research-
ers intervened to prevent men from getting treatment when they were diag-
nosed by other doctors. The Tuskegee study ran from 1932 to 1972 and was 
stopped only when media reports generated a public outcry.

260
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
In the meantime, other disturbing research projects had come to light. At 
Willowbrook State School for children with developmental disabilities in 
Staten Island, New York, healthy children were given the virus that causes 
hepatitis so that researchers could assess the effects of certain treatments. 
The parents of children who were admitted to the school’s research ward 
were required to consent to the research as a condition of admission, but 
weren’t necessarily informed of what the research comprised. Public outrage 
forced the cancellation of the study in 1966, and the school eventually was 
closed amid allegations of other forms of abuse.
Around the same time, doctors at the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital in New 
York injected live cancer cells into 22 senile patients with chronic debilitating 
health conditions to see whether their weakened bodies would reject foreign 
cancer cells at the same rate that healthy bodies did. The researchers didn’t 
inform the patients that they were being injected with cancer cells, nor did 
they tell the patients’ doctors what they were doing. In fact, the researchers 
didn’t even get permission from the hospital’s research committee.
Developing regulations for research in humans
In the aftermath of the outrage over the Tuskegee study and other scandals, 
Congress passed the National Research Act of 1974 to investigate and estab-
lish rules of conduct for research in humans. The legislation created the 
National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and 
Behavioral Research, which was charged with identifying ethical principles 
and developing guidelines to assure those principles are followed.
In 1979, the commission issued its findings, asserting the following principles 
and guidelines for ethical research:
 
✓ Respect for human subjects: Individuals have the right to decide 
whether they want to participate in research. Informed consent consists 
of being given all relevant information, understanding the risks and ben-
efits of participation, and being willing to take part without coercion. 
Under this principle, researchers have to take extra precautions when 
their subjects are people who have limited decision-making capabilities, 
such as dementia or low IQ, because their ability to give informed con-
sent is compromised. In these cases, informed consent can be given by 
the person’s legally designated healthcare proxy.
 
✓ Reasonable expectation of beneficial results: The principle of benefi-
cence states that research on humans should maximize benefits and 
minimize risks, especially to the subjects. This principle is the reason 
researchers test potential drugs in the lab and on animals before they 
begin testing on humans (see Chapter 11); only with these preliminary 
tests can scientists determine whether the potential benefits of testing 
in humans outweigh the potential risks.

261
 Chapter 16: Getting a Handle on Current Stem Cell Laws and Policies
 
✓ Fair distribution of risks and possible benefits: People were outraged 
at the Tuskegee study in part because the subjects all were African-
American men; no women and no Caucasians were included in the 
study. The principle of justice in human research requires that no single 
population — African-American men, children with developmental dis-
abilities, or senile seniors, for example — be considered “expendable” in 
the interests of research.
The commission’s findings were incorporated into DHHS and FDA regulations 
in 1981, and those regulations have since been adopted by most federal agen-
cies and departments that sponsor research in humans. Now known as the 
Common Rule, these regulations
 
✓ Require studies to be reviewed by an internal committee, called an 
Institutional Review Board
 
✓ Establish rules for Institutional Review Board membership, duties, and 
recordkeeping
 
✓ Require researchers to obtain and document informed consent from 
their subjects
 
✓ Provide for special protections for vulnerable research subjects, such as 
prisoners and children
 
✓ Set procedures for ensuring that research institutions comply with all 
the provisions of the Common Rule
Understanding how the scientific community views regulation
Popular misconceptions about scientists in general include the ideas that 
research isn’t regulated, that scientists don’t want to be regulated, and that 
scientists are more interested in figuring out what they can do than in look-
ing out for the common good — that is, considering whether they should do 
something. These misconceptions date back centuries and are continually 
reinforced in books and movies: Think of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein or 
Michael Crichton’s Jurassic Park, not to mention virtually every B sci-fi movie 
from the 1950s.
In real life, the archetypal mad scientist is, thankfully, a pretty rare phenom-
enon. Most scientists are responsible, ethical, and highly attuned to the 
common good; in fact, many scientists are motivated to enter their fields by a 
desire to improve the common good.
 
Although they grumble sometimes about the paperwork involved, scientists 
generally approve of regulations that protect the integrity of their research 
and the people who participate in their experiments. In fact, in many cases, 
scientists have actively sought governmental regulation — and fellow scien-
tists often end up blowing the whistle on their unethical or irresponsible col-
leagues. (See Chapter 15 for whistle-blowing examples.)

Understanding General 
Political Pressures
The politics of embryonic stem cell research are inextricably linked with 
abortion. Almost immediately after the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing 
abortion, Congress prohibited federal funding for any research involving 
human embryos, fetuses, and embryonic or fetal tissue. Some lawmakers 
and anti-abortion activists worried that women who were ambivalent about 
having an abortion would choose to terminate their pregnancies if they 
thought their embryos or fetuses could contribute to scientific research. 
(During the past 30-plus years, various studies have turned up no evidence 
that “contributing to research” influences a woman’s decision to have an 
abortion.)
Little has changed in the decades since Roe v. Wade, as far as the issues of 
abortion and embryonic stem cell research go. When James Thomson and 
his team at the University of Wisconsin first isolated embryonic stem cells 
in 1998, they used extra blastocysts that had been created during in vitro 
fertilization that couples had decided to discard (rather than storing them 
indefinitely); Thomson’s team sought donor couples’ consent to use these 
excess blastocysts for their research. Around the same time, a research team 
at Johns Hopkins University reported isolating a similar type of pluripotent 
stem cell called a human embryonic germ cell. This group used the tissue of 
aborted fetuses to derive the cells. Both methods remain controversial today.
 
The crux of the debate is the issue of the moral status of human embryos at 
various stages of development. Some argue that personhood begins at concep-
tion, when the egg cell and sperm cell fuse to form a zygote (see Chapter 4). 
Others argue that, until the so-called primitive streak appears, the cells in a blas-
tocyst are just cells, bearing no resemblance to even a developing human being. 
Chapter 15 discusses the question of personhood in more detail.
The primitive streak typically begins to form around 14 days after concep-
tion, so many states limit researchers to using blastocysts that have devel-
oped for less than 14 days. This 14-day limit doesn’t interfere with embryonic 
stem cell research because, when the primitive streak appears, cells begin to 
develop the special characteristics of their tissue type (see Chapter 2) and 
therefore lose many of the properties that make cells in younger blastocysts 
unique and useful for human embryonic stem cell research.
For opponents of embryonic stem cell research, though, the age of the blasto-
cysts is immaterial. They believe every zygote is a human life, and destroying 
blastocysts — even those left over after in vitro fertilization treatments — is 
equivalent to murder. Meanwhile, while this debate is going on, blastocysts 
are created (and destroyed, if they don’t meet certain criteria, or if they’re 
not needed to initiate a pregnancy) every day in the normal course of every 
IVF clinic’s business.

263
 Chapter 16: Getting a Handle on Current Stem Cell Laws and Policies
For elected officials, the balance between respect for human life (even poten-
tial human life) and research that may, someday, lead to vastly improved 
treatments for a wide range of devastating diseases is a delicate one. Many 
couples who undergo in vitro fertilization choose to have their leftover blas-
tocysts destroyed when they have completed in vitro fertilization treatment. 
In those cases, some politicians argue, it’s appropriate to derive some value 
from these doomed-to-be-discarded blastocysts, in much the same way that 
organ and tissue donation creates value for the living when the donor dies.
When President George W. Bush allowed the NIH to fund research projects 
that used stem cells derived from blastocysts before August 9, 2001, he 
attempted to assuage critics by noting that the blastocysts that gave rise 
to those stem cell lines had already been destroyed and therefore could be 
used for research in good conscience. However, he refused to sanction the 
creation of new stem cell lines on the grounds that doing so would amount to 
approving of the destruction of human life. Not surprisingly, his effort to find 
a middle ground in the contentious debate left many unsatisfied.
 
As the debate continues to rage over the moral status of early blastocysts 
and whether it’s ever morally justifiable to destroy a blastocyst for research 
purposes, some proponents on either side tend to become more entrenched 
in their views and more intractable in their statements. For those who believe 
embryonic stem cell research is wrong, the issue is the sanctity of all human 
life — a moral stance from which they can’t be shaken. Those who believe 
such research can move medicine forward by quantum leaps, on the other 
hand, are sometimes tempted to make promises that aren’t yet supported by 
the science.
Few of those claims, by the way, come from the scientific community; much 
of the hype and suggestions of immediate therapies is driven more by media 
coverage than by either stem cell researchers or even the people who advo-
cate the research on behalf of patients with debilitating diseases. As with 
most controversial issues, the rhetoric on embryonic stem cells tends toward 
black-and-white statements, while the reality is heavily nuanced with shades 
of gray.
In fact, as a result of the political pressures and debates, there’s very little in 
the way of federal legislation regarding human embryonic stem cell research 
or in vitro fertilization treatment or research. The broader ethical and politi-
cal issues are so contentious that lawmakers in Washington can’t even 
agree on a straightforward ban on reproductive cloning, for example. In the 
absence of federal legislation on some of these narrower issues, state legis-
latures have taken it upon themselves to control what happens inside their 
borders. (See the following section, “Exploring Stem Cell Policies in Individual 
States.”)

264
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
When President Obama delivered the 2009 commencement address at the 
University of Notre Dame, he summed up the stem cell debate this way:
“Those who speak out against stem cell research may be rooted in 
admirable conviction about the sacredness of life, but so are the parents of a 
child with juvenile diabetes who are convinced that their son’s or daughter’s 
hardships might be relieved . . . When we open up our hearts and our minds 
to those who may not think precisely like we do or believe precisely what 
we believe — that’s when we discover at least the possibility of common 
ground.”
Exploring Stem Cell Policies 
in Individual States
One of the unintended consequences of the complicated federal funding situa-
tion regarding embryonic stem cell research was that some talented scientists 
began looking for opportunities to conduct their research in other countries 
with less restrictive policies. State governments, alarmed at the potential brain 
drain and eager to create new economic models in a post-manufacturing age, 
latched on to stem cell research as a way to keep and attract researchers and 
the companies that employ them. That has led to another unintended conse-
quence: a patchwork of sometimes conflicting laws, regulations, and funding 
policies that themselves can be pretty complicated.
Since 2004, several states have enacted legislation to promote stem cell 
research within their borders. They include
 
✓ California: In 2004, voters directed the state to borrow $3 billion 
throughout the next decade to spend on stem cell research, including 
human embryonic stem cells, and added constitutional protection for 
such research. The money commitment puts California ahead of many 
other nations’ budgets. This money has been used for several research 
projects involving human adult, embryonic, and fetal stem cells; some 
of these project include development of new tools and technologies, 
training of young scientists, construction of new facilities that are inde-
pendent of federal funds (and the attendant restrictions), and formation 
of teams to attempt to put potential treatments into clinical trials as 
quickly as possible.
 
✓ Connecticut: In 2005, the state committed to spending $100 million 
throughout the next ten years on both embryonic and tissue (or adult) 
stem cell research.
 
✓ Illinois: In 2005, then-governor Rod Blagojevich created a stem-cell 
research institute by executive order, bypassing the state legislature.

265
 Chapter 16: Getting a Handle on Current Stem Cell Laws and Policies
 
✓ Iowa: In 2007, the state eased restrictions on cloning embryos, allowing 
cloning for research purposes but not for reproduction.
 
✓ Maryland: The 2006 Maryland Stem Cell Research Act allocated $15 mil-
lion for state grants to fund embryonic stem cell research.
 
✓ Missouri: In 2006, voters defied the state legislature, which had been 
trying to ban embryonic stem cell research in the state, and approved a 
constitutional amendment protecting such research.
 
✓ New Jersey: In 2004, the state legislature funded the newly chartered 
Stem Cell Institute of New Jersey — beating California by a few months 
to become the first state to fund stem cell research.
 
✓ New York: State lawmakers created the Empire State Stem Cell Trust in 
2007; the endowment supports research on stem cells from any source.
 
One often-repeated concern is that research on human embryonic stem cells 
is guaranteed to lead to cloning of human adults. Although Congress hasn’t 
yet managed to enact legislation restricting human reproductive cloning, sev-
eral states that support stem cell research have enacted bans on reproductive 
cloning (see Chapter 6). In fact, stem cell scientists are virtually unanimous 
in their opinion that human cloning is neither ethical nor desirable, and most 
of them support formal bans on the technique. In many cases, the state bans 
may have arisen in reaction to various bogus announcements by rogues 
(and, frankly, quacks like the Raelians, discussed in Chapter 6) that they’ve 
succeeded in creating cloned human babies or generated blastocysts using 
nuclear transfer (cloning techniques) that can be used to initiate a pregnancy. 
(So far, no one has produced a verified cloned human baby, and few research-
ers believe it’s possible with current technology. See Chapter 15 for more on 
the ethical considerations of cloning.)
Other states have taken different approaches to stem cell research. The legal 
situation across the country is continually shifting as states debate and enact 
their own legislative policies. Some states have decided to adopt federal poli-
cies, or at least make their own policies consistent with federal guidelines 
and regulations. Others have taken different stances on what is and isn’t per-
mitted within their borders. Virginia, for example, allows research on tissue, 
or adult, stem cells (see Chapter 5) but not on embryonic stem cells. South 
Dakota prohibits any research on embryos, and Louisiana prohibits research 
on blastocysts created through in vitro fertilization. Arkansas, Indiana, 
Michigan, and North Dakota ban research on cloned embryos; California, 
Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode 
Island allow (and regulate) generating embryos with nuclear transfer (clon-
ing) methods for research but not for initiating a pregnancy.

Looking at What Other Countries Are 
Doing with Stem Cell Research
Human stem cell research policies around the globe vary as much as they do 
among individual states in the United States. Some countries are aggressively 
pursuing the field and its possibilities, permitting scientists to create stem 
cells from virtually any source, including somatic cell nuclear transfer, the 
process of removing the nucleus from an egg cell and replacing it with the 
nucleus of a tissue cell. (See Chapter 6 for more on how this process works.)
Other countries have more restrictive policies, limiting researchers to 
donated blastocysts from fertility clinics, for example. Still others have 
enacted outright bans on human embryonic stem cell research, while many 
countries have no established policy.
Countries with the most liberal policies include Australia, Belgium, China, 
India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Countries 
with the most restrictive policies — ranging from bans on stem cell research 
to restrictions similar to those imposed by the U.S. government — include 
Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and Poland.
 
The United States and some other countries strictly regulate clinics that offer 
stem cell therapies. Unfortunately, some countries are quite lax in their over-
sight of these clinics, and clinics in those unregulated countries often aggres-
sively market their services in the United States. (If you’re considering seeking 
stem cell therapy, turn to Chapter 21 to find out what you need to know before 
you make your decision.)
The International Society for Stem Cell Research recently addressed the issue 
of marketing unproven stem cell therapies to consumers by saying,
“Unfortunately, there are clinics around the world that exploit patients’ 
hopes by offering supposed stem cell therapies, without credible scientific 
rationale, oversight, or other patient protections.”
The society’s guidelines (see the following section) establish standards for 
judging the claims stem cell clinics make about their treatments and deter-
mining whether the treatments were developed responsibly and ethically. 
The ISSCR also issued a strong statement against unproven stem cell thera-
pies, saying,
“ . . . the ISSCR condemns the administration of unproven uses of stem cells 
or their direct derivatives to a large series of patients outside of a clinical 
trial, particularly when patients are charged for such services.”

267
 Chapter 16: Getting a Handle on Current Stem Cell Laws and Policies
 
Nearly all stem cell therapies — except bone marrow transplants, which have 
a 40-year track record — are new and experimental and can’t be considered to 
be effective until there’s strong and reliable evidence from trials on sufficient 
numbers of patients.
Exploring the Roles of Science 
and Medical Societies
Science and medical associations often recommend guidelines to ensure that 
research is carried out responsibly and ethically. These guidelines some-
times mirror governmental regulations, but often they incorporate more 
rigorous standards than governments require — partly because members of 
these groups are more familiar with the scientific, clinical, and ethical issues 
involved in their research than elected officials usually are.
In 2005, the National Academies released its guidelines for human embryonic 
stem cell research in the United States. Those guidelines, which included the 
principles of voluntary participation, informed consent, and review panels 
made up of professionals with the appropriate expertise, became the tem-
plate for regulation in a number of states and for subsequent international 
guidelines.
In 2008, the International Society for Stem Cell Research issued updated 
guidelines for translating basic stem cell research into clinical therapies. 
The new guidelines are based on the core principles of responsible research, 
including
 
✓ Independent review and oversight by qualified scientists: The ISSCR 
guidelines emphasize the importance of having stem cell experts review 
data from lab and animal experiments to determine whether the evi-
dence supports testing in humans. “Given the novelty and unpredictabil-
ity of early stem-cell-based clinical trials, it is of utmost importance that 
individuals with stem-cell-specific expertise be involved in the scientific 
and ethical review at each step” of the research process.
 
✓ Voluntary informed consent: The ISSCR guidelines urges researchers 
to place special emphasis on “the unique risks” of stem cell treatments 
to make sure research subjects understand the uncertainties about the 
short- and long-term effects of such treatments. The guidelines also 
acknowledge the hype surrounding potential stem cell therapies, noting 
that patients in clinical trials “may harbor misconceptions about the 
potential for therapeutic efficacy.” In other words, some people may 
think that entering a stem cell clinical trial will cure whatever ails them, 
even if the science doesn’t yet support such hopes.

268
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
 
✓ Careful monitoring and timely reporting of adverse events: Because 
of the uncertainties involved in stem cell-based therapies, the ISSCR 
guidelines urge researchers to pay particular attention to patients’ over-
all health during clinical trials and to immediately report any adverse 
events, which could be something as minor as a rash or as serious as 
a severe allergic reaction or organ failure. The ISSCR also recommends 
that researchers report all results, positive and negative, “to prevent 
others from being subjected to unnecessary risk in future clinical trials” 
and to ensure that any clinical treatments are safe and effective. (See 
Chapter 11 for more on clinical trials.)
 
✓ Social justice: Lay people are excited about stem cell research because 
it holds great promise for devising effective treatments for a number 
of common diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurological 
diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. But public support for the 
research will fade fast if the benefits are perceived as too narrow. The 
ISSCR guidelines emphasizing selecting research participants fairly and 
ensuring that participants benefit from discoveries and therapies. (This 
was one of the fatal flaws of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study: Participants 
weren’t treated for their disease even after a proven cure — penicillin — 
was available.)

Funding and Profits

M
oney matters in every walk of life, and scientific research of all types, 
including biomedical and stem cell research, is no different. While 
people debate the merits of public funding for certain kinds of stem cell 
research — or for any research at all, for that matter — the fact is that with-
out money from somewhere, research stalls, and the potential solutions to 
human problems and disease it could bring to light remain hidden.
In this chapter, we explore the various sources that fund stem cell research, 
from government monies to private foundations to pharmaceutical and bio-
tech companies (and investors in those companies). We also provide a brief 
primer on how patents and licenses work in the stem cell field and the areas 
of concern such claims of ownership raise.
Taking a Look at Funding 
in the United States
In the United States, the federal government is the single largest and most 
important financer of early-stage biomedical research. The federal govern-
ment funds research before it leads to clinical trials, and even before the 
research leads to any preclinical development. By the time industry and 

270
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
even some private foundations get involved, research is typically at its later 
stages, when scientists have a good idea of what the final treatment, drug, or 
other therapy might look like.
 
The thing is, scientists could never deliver practical applications and thera-
pies without all that basic investigation and discovery that the federal gov-
ernment pays for. So the federal contribution is really the driver of the entire 
American biomedical research enterprise, which means that if we want to 
keep getting therapies and treatments out of the for-profit private sector, we 
have to keep the money flowing for the earliest stages of research.
The current American system of financing research was designed after World 
War II, when policy makers realized that science really won that war. Before 
World War II, the federal government spent a (comparatively) paltry $70 mil-
lion on all forms of scientific research. Today, the budget for the National 
Institutes of Health, which funds a vast range of biomedical research, includ-
ing research involving stem cells, is about $31 billion. The National Science 
Foundation’s budget is another $7 billion. (See Chapter 16 for more on the 
history of government funding for stem cell research.)
In general, the federal government finances research when it’s clear that the 
research is valuable and may, someday, lead to useful applications or prod-
ucts, but — and this is the “but” that tends to keep corporate and venture 
capital investment away — it’s not yet clear what those applications or prod-
ucts might be. Funding from companies and investors tends to come in when 
scientists are somewhat confident as to what the final product will be. (Full 
disclosure: As an academic researcher, Larry receives public and private 
funding for his work. He also founded a publicly held biotech company sev-
eral years ago and is a shareholder and consultant for the company.)
Generally, stem cell research, like most medical research, is funded by a com-
bination of public and private dollars. In fact, because public funding has been 
restricted due to political conflicts, some funding from private foundations and 
philanthropists has flowed into the field to enable research to continue.
Not all private money invested in stem cell research is donated out of pure 
altruism, though. While donors may genuinely wish to see science make 
significant advances in treating devastating and seemingly intractable dis-
eases like Alzheimer’s, cancer, or heart disease, there’s also, in many cases, 
a strong profit motive. Health-related industry is one of the fastest growing 
sectors in the U.S. economy, and analysts expect that trend to continue for 
at least the next 20 years as the enormous Baby Boom generation reaches 
retirement age and demands more from the country’s healthcare system. In 
the United States, the for-profit sector of biomedical delivery is the major 
way in which new drugs and many therapeutic devices are developed and 
delivered to the general population.

271
 Chapter 17: Following the Money: Understanding Stem Cell Funding and Profits
Aside from the profit potential in developing new drugs, stem cell research 
offers vast opportunities to make money from specific techniques for grow-
ing stem cells and even from the cells themselves. The idea of patenting 
human cells or tissues raises several ethical and moral questions, but, for the 
time being at least, being the first to describe and claim ownership of a stem 
cell technique or product opens up the potential for lucrative licensing fees 
and royalties that other researchers have to pay.
Looking at Government Funding
The popular perception is that the federal government doesn’t fund stem cell 
research — at least not research on human embryonic stem cells. This mis-
taken idea comes, at least in part, from another popular myth: that President 
George W. Bush banned human embryonic stem cell research in 2001. (See 
the nearby sidebar, “Bush’s policy on human embryonic stem cell research,” 
for the real story.) While it’s true that federal spending on human embryonic 
stem cell research has been restricted (not banned), the U.S. government 
has provided funding for most other types of stem cell research — including 
adult human stem cells, fetal human stem cells, and embryonic stem cells 
from nonhuman sources like mice. (Federal funding research on fetal tissues 
and stem cells was prohibited for a number of years, but that restriction was 
lifted in the 1990s; see Chapter 16.)
Through the National Institutes of Health, the federal government spent 
approximately $938 million in 2008 to support various types of stem cell 
research. Of that total, about $88 million was dedicated to human embry-
onic stem cell research. Most people expect the NIH to devote more money 
to this specific type of research in the future because President Barack 
Obama changed the restrictions on such funding in 2009. (In late 2009, a 
federal District Court judge threw out a lawsuit challenging the Obama 
Administration’s funding rules.)
 
Despite all the jokes you’ve heard about wasteful government spending, the 
National Institutes of Health doesn’t just hand out grants to any old research 
project. Grants are issued on a competitive basis, meaning researchers have to 
submit proposals that undergo scientific review and are judged against other 
proposals. The highest-quality, most meritorious proposals get funded — 
between 10 to 15 percent of all the proposals that were submitted in the last few 
years.
Of course, the federal government isn’t the only source of government 
monies. Since President Bush’s restricted policy on funding human embry-
onic stem cell research was announced in 2001, state governments have 
funded some research in the field to try to fill the gap. Some have even 
amended their constitutions to ensure that such research is allowed within 
their borders.

272
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
According to the Rockefeller Institute of Government (www.rockinst.org), 
California is the largest government financier of human embryonic stem cell 
research, having already committed more than $3 billion to the field through 
the creation of the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). 
Total state-level spending on various kinds of stem cell research is expected 
to top $500 million a year over the next decade as New Jersey, New York, 
Massachusetts, Texas, and other states work to push the research closer to 
therapeutic applications and possibly generate new companies, as well as 
potentially lucrative biotechnology clusters that connect universities, non-
profit institutions, and private companies. (See Chapter 16 for more on fed-
eral and state policies on stem cell research.)
 
Even though the $31-billion NIH budget and California’s $3-billion commitment 
to embryonic stem cell research are a lot of money, they’re mere pittances 
when compared to what the country spends on treating diseases and their asso-
ciated costs (like lost work days), not to mention human suffering. And, frankly, 
American consumers spend more on shoes — nearly $40 billion a year — than 
the federal government spends on biomedical research.
Bush’s policy on human 
embryonic stem cell research
On August 9, 2001, President George W. Bush 
announced that stem cell scientists could apply 
for federal funding for research on human 
embryonic stem cell lines that were created 
before 9 p.m. on the day of his announce-
ment. His policy prohibited federal funding for 
research on any human embryonic stem cell 
lines created after that day and hour; his rea-
soning was that, although he didn’t want to 
encourage the destruction of human embryos, 
he felt it was reasonable to fund research in 
cases where the stem cells had already been 
derived.
His announcement marked the first time federal 
funds were made available for any research 
on human embryonic stem cells. Although the 
Clinton Administration opened discussions on 
the funding issue, President Bush took office 
before President Clinton adopted a formal 
policy on what kinds of research the govern-
ment should finance.
President Bush also urged couples to donate 
leftover IVF blastocysts — so-called snowflake 
embryos, referring to the fact that IVF blasto-
cysts are frozen until they’re needed — to other 
couples who wanted to have children. The first 
snowflake baby was born in the late 1990s, but 
even with the President’s public push, only a 
couple hundred snowflake children have been 
born in the United States during the past 10 
years (representing a tiny fraction of the esti-
mated 400,000 blastocysts stored in freezers at 
IVF clinics around the country).

273
 Chapter 17: Following the Money: Understanding Stem Cell Funding and Profits
Considering arguments for and 
against government funding
 
Not everyone is a fan of federal government funding for stem cell research. 
Some people argue that with individual states taking up much of the financial 
burden, the federal government should stay out of the more controversial 
aspects of stem cell science, such as work involving human embryos. They 
point out that in vitro fertilization was developed without financial support 
from the U.S. government — and that the United States is the undisputed 
world leader in fertility treatments, a $3 billion-a-year industry. These advo-
cates also note that James Thomson’s lab, which was the first to isolate 
human embryonic stem cells in 1998, didn’t use any federal funding for its 
research in this area.
Others argue that the state-funded initiatives, most of which were started in 
response to the Bush Administration’s restrictions, have resulted in a confus-
ing patchwork of conflicting rules and regulations, which makes it difficult 
for researchers to collaborate across state lines. In addition, because of the 
federal restrictions that prohibited the use of any equipment and other facili-
ties paid for with federal dollars in unapproved research activities, much of 
the states’ money has gone to duplicating infrastructure rather than funding 
actual research. In the view of many people, the easiest way for the country 
to come up with a coherent and consistent policy on all forms of stem cell 
research is for the federal government to do so — and the easiest, most ratio-
nal way for the federal government to implement a coherent and consistent 
policy is through funding.
Finally, some people believe all levels of government should stay away from 
funding scientific research in general. Advocates of private-only funding 
argue that government doesn’t get the same kind of return on its investment 
that private companies do and argue that subsidizing academic research 
cannibalizes private industry. They also consider government-funded initia-
tives to be unnecessarily bureaucratic and cumbersome, stifling rather than 
encouraging scientific research and innovation.
But such critics may be taking too narrow a view of the value of publicly funded 
research. According to the book Measuring the Gains from Medical Research: An 
Economic Approach, edited by University of Chicago economists Kevin Murphy 
and Robert Topel (University of Chicago Press), improvements in preventing 
and treating heart disease alone netted a total economic gain of $31 trillion — 
1,000 times the annual NIH budget. Increases in average life expectancy in the 
1970s and 1980s are worth $57 trillion of economic activity — four times the 
gross domestic product (GDP, total net output of tangible goods and services) in 
the United States in 2008. Medical research that led to a 20-percent reduction in 
cancer deaths would be worth $10 trillion to the U.S. economy.

274
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
Here’s how government investment in basic biomedical research benefits the 
economy:
 
✓ By making people healthier: Healthier people live longer (and often 
work longer, thus contributing to the GDP), spend less on healthcare, 
and require fewer services from the government (such as coverage of 
nursing home expenses).
 
✓ By laying the foundation for development of new products and thera-
pies: Without basic research, no one would ever develop new drugs, 
medical devices, or other therapies. Basic research leads to midstage 
research, which leads to the development of new therapies and prod-
ucts for the market.
 
✓ By creating jobs: Federal funding of biomedical research creates hun-
dreds of thousands of jobs, either directly or indirectly, at universities, 
academic medical centers, and private companies around the country.
Exploring how federal money can 
advance stem cell research
Proponents of federal spending on stem cell research say more is at stake 
than simply having the money to equip labs and hire scientists. The Bush 
Administration’s restrictions on human embryonic stem cell research cre-
ated, in effect, two distinct classes of researchers in the field: those who 
primarily relied on federal money and those who had access to other fund-
ing sources. Under the Bush Administration’s rules, federally funded scien-
tists were limited to working with only a federally approved subset of the 
embryonic stem cell lines that were available. Thus, if they wanted to use 
nonapproved lines or collaborate with researchers who had enough nonfed-
eral money to work with nonapproved cell lines, the paperwork involving 
accounting and auditing was so cumbersome that such collaborations were 
often difficult to do — which may have (no one knows for sure) slowed down 
research during those years.
With less restrictive federal policies on financing human embryonic stem cell 
research, advocates expect more collaboration, which may facilitate faster 
breakthroughs on some of the challenges in creating effective medical treat-
ments with these cells.
The other appeal of less restrictive federal funding for human embryonic 
stem cell research is the implicit seal of approval it signals to private compa-
nies and investors. Although pharmaceutical companies and individuals have 
contributed to stem cell research over the past decade, some people believe 
the earlier federal restrictions made such investments appear risky. They 
anticipate even greater private investment over the next few years now that 
federal restrictions have been eased.

 Chapter 17: Following the Money: Understanding Stem Cell Funding and Profits
Understanding Academic Funding
Researchers at universities typically rely on four main sources of funding: 
government grants, foundation monies (see “Getting Private Foundations 
Involved,” later in this chapter), private donations, and corporate funding. 
When federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research was limited to 
specific cell lines (see Chapter 16), academic reliance on foundation grants 
and private donations grew; some labs, to avoid running afoul of the federal 
restrictions, bought two of everything — from major equipment to office sup-
plies — so that they could dedicate one set to federally funded research and 
the second set to research financed through other sources.
Of course, that kind of duplication eats up money fast, so many academic 
scientists greeted state funding and President Obama’s policy changes on 
federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research with enthusiasm.
 
In some ways, the funding restrictions under the Bush Administration spurred 
more activity among institutions, foundations, and private individuals, and 
state governments to find creative ways to advance stem cell research. One 
of those creative solutions was Proposition 71 in California, which authorized 
the state to sell $3 billion in government bonds over 10 years to finance stem 
cell research. However, implementation of Proposition 71 was stalled for more 
than two years by political and legal challenges, leaving state funding for 
research in limbo. To temporarily help fill the gap, wealthy individuals con-
tributed more than $250 million to California universities to conduct stem cell 
research — particularly research on human embryonic stem cells. (Of course, 
both amounts are mere drops in the bucket compared to what’s needed.)
Universities across the country saw similar contributions from 2001 on. 
Johns Hopkins University received an anonymous donation of nearly $60 mil-
lion to start its Institute for Cell Engineering. The University of Texas Health 
Science Center in Houston received a 10-year, $25-million contribution from 
one of its patients to fund stem cell research. And, for the past few years, 
Harvard University has been working toward a goal of $100 million in private 
donations for its Stem Cell Institute. (The economic downturn of 2008–09 neg-
atively affected this sort of financial giving, just as it did nearly every other 
sector of the economy.)
The challenges of funding also have prompted universities, foundations, 
and clinics to forge collaborative partnerships so that they can leverage 
money and expertise — although foundation funding typically is targeted to 
research on a specific disease. For example, Harvard, the Juvenile Diabetes 
Research Foundation, Boston IVF, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute 
joined forces in 2001 to generate new human embryonic stem cell lines. In 
three years, the consortium developed 17 new lines without using a penny of 
government money.

276
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
 
Funding from private foundations is limited compared with the amount of fed-
eral funding that’s available. Private industry often doesn’t invest in research 
at its very early stages because the basic principles that early research seeks 
to identify may not lead to the products a company is trying to develop. 
Disease-oriented foundations primarily focus on the disease they’re interested 
in, and industry-sponsored research typically involves research that leads to a 
defined goal — that is, industry isn’t as interested in discovering how stem 
cells work as it is in using stem cells to develop therapies it can sell.
Academic stem cell researchers are sometimes funded by or collaborate with 
private companies. That’s a good thing because it brings complementary 
strengths together. But it also can be complicated because, when a company 
funds research, it often wants rights to the results of that research that go 
beyond what the academic institution is willing to cede. These collabora-
tions also have inherent conflicts between the companies’ natural tendency 
to keep their activities secret (so as not to tip off the competition) and aca-
demia’s tradition of sharing research results with the scientific community 
and the general public.
These kinds of collaborations get even more complicated when the issue of 
patent licenses arises. (See the section “Establishing Ownership through Patents 
and Licenses,” later in this chapter.) Academic researchers often receive patent 
licenses that prohibit development of commercial applications — a trade-off for 
the custom of not charging a licensing fee (or charging only a very small fee) for 
the right to use the patented material, process, or equipment.
Getting Private Foundations Involved
Although the federal and state governments spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars on stem cell research of all kinds, private foundations and individual 
philanthropists are also trying to help this new field develop. According to 
the Rockefeller Institute, foundations and private individuals have committed 
nearly $2 billion for stem cell research over the past several years — much 
of it aimed at helping universities and other research institutions advance 
human embryonic stem cell research despite federal funding restrictions.
Even so, that $2 billion, which has been spread out over several years, is only 
slightly more than the federal government spends on stem cell research in 
just two years. And that annual commitment is the big advantage of govern-
ment funding: While philanthropists and foundations may pledge, say, $1 
million a year for 10 years, the National Institutes of Health spends more than 
$900 million on stem cell research every year.

277
 Chapter 17: Following the Money: Understanding Stem Cell Funding and Profits
 
Although the money that foundations and philanthropists spend on stem cell 
research is impressive, it can’t compete with recurring federal and state gov-
ernment financing. Lots of funding from foundations and individuals is a one-
shot deal. A research project may get $25 million this year, but it won’t get 
another $25 million from the same private source next year. However, funding 
from foundations and philanthropy often helps research get to the point 
where it can compete for federal dollars and sustained, multiyear funding.
The International Society for Stem Cell Research (www.isscr.org) lists 
funding opportunities on its Web site from a broad range of foundations, 
scientific societies, and government agencies like the National Institutes of 
Health and the National Science Foundation.
Understanding the Role 
of Private Industry
One of the reasons funding early-stage research often isn’t a high priority for 
private industry is that early-stage basic research doesn’t always provide a clear 
business model. When you’re investigating how cellular processes and disease 
mechanisms work, predicting whether a final answer to treating a disease will be 
a drug, a device, or a procedure that can be readily commercialized is difficult. 
Drugs and devices can be sold, of course, but procedures — like a kidney trans-
plant, or methods for grafting new heart tissue onto a damaged heart — typically 
don’t have an obvious profit-making path. And research and development are 
expensive enough without spending money on something that may never lead to 
a product you can sell. That said, a number of companies are starting up in this 
growing field, looking to make money from advances in biomedical and stem cell 
research.
The biotechnology industry (usually shortened to biotech in common 
use) owes its existence to the technology of recombinant DNA, sometimes 
referred to as DNA cloning (see Chapter 7), which led to, among other 
things, the ability to make human insulin for diabetes patients. In the ear-
ly1970s, a number of researchers at Stanford University and the University 
of California–San Francisco developed new techniques for splicing bits of 
human (or animal or plant) DNA together and using special kinds of bacteria 
to make many copies of the recombinant DNA. One of those researchers, 
Herbert Boyer, later cofounded Genentech, now the largest company in the 
biotech industry.

278
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
In 2007, biotech companies in the United States invested some $30 billion in 
research and development (although little, if any, of this investment went to 
basic research). The 2008–09 recession forced significant cuts in R&D spend-
ing. (See the nearby sidebar, “How biotech fares in a recession.”) Still, U.S. 
biotech firms are testing more than 400 potential drug treatments and other 
therapies in clinical trials. These trials target cancer, heart disease, diabetes, 
AIDS, arthritis, Alzheimer’s, and multiple sclerosis.
To pay for all that research and development, early stage biotech companies 
seek out venture capital — investment from individuals or firms who believe 
the biotech company has potential for rapid growth — and partnerships with 
each other, large corporations, and, occasionally, academic or medical insti-
tutions. Insulin, the first biotech drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, was developed through a partnership between Genentech 
and pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly.
According to BioWorld, an industry news and research service, biotech com-
panies entered into more than 400 new partnerships with pharmaceutical 
companies in 2007, and nearly 500 arrangements with other biotech firms. 
Between 2003 and 2007, biotech companies — mostly startups or young 
companies — raised more than $100 billion in financing.
How biotech fares in a recession
Like most industries, biotech isn’t recession-
proof. According to reports from various indus-
try watchers, only 10 percent of the 370 publicly 
traded biotech companies in the United States 
reported positive net income in January 2009. 
Thirty percent of public biotech companies 
reported having less than six months’ worth 
of cash on hand, and almost half had less than 
a year’s worth of cash on hand. While not all 
of these companies are involved in stem cell 
research, the fact that biotech had a tough 
time during the 2008–2009 recession likely 
means that investment in stem cell biotech also 
suffered.
More significant from a research perspective 
is the fact that, between September 2008 and 
January 2009, at least 24 companies suspended 
drug development programs for diseases 
including Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, vari-
ous forms of cancer, and diabetes. These com-
panies didn’t postpone their research because 
it wasn’t leading anywhere. On the contrary, 
these promising areas of research were put on 
hiatus for lack of ready financing.
Other signs that biotech is just as vulnerable to 
economic conditions as any other industry: Six 
biotech companies filed for bankruptcy in 2008, 
and 19 companies that had planned to go public 
withdrew their initial public offerings of stock 
in 2008. Overall, U.S. biotech stocks lost nearly 
half their value in 2008.

279
 Chapter 17: Following the Money: Understanding Stem Cell Funding and Profits
Large pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Merck, are just 
beginning to get seriously involved in the use of stem cell and regenerative 
medicine technologies. Initially, they probably will use these technologies 
primarily for drug development and improving the efficiency of drug develop-
ment, but it isn’t clear yet what the long-term uses of these technologies will 
be in the pharmaceutical industry.
 
Of course, biotech isn’t limited to the health field. The industry also works in 
agriculture to improve crop yields and disease or pest resistance; in environ-
mental sciences to clean up hazardous waste; and in industrial applications to 
find cleaner fuel sources and reduce waste.
Establishing Ownership Through 
Patents and Licenses
Legal ownership of stem cell technologies — and even the cells themselves — 
further complicates the funding picture for researchers. Aside from the issue of 
whether it’s ethical to patent human cells, tissues, and genes, pharmaceutical, 
biotech, and even some academic researchers who want to use patented tech-
nology or cells have to factor in the fees charged by the patent holder. Often, 
patent holders charge an upfront licensing fee, plus royalties on any revenues 
the licensee earns from using the patent holder’s material and other fees.
In some cases, researchers also have to navigate a patent thicket — a stack 
of separate patents that can add significant costs to research and develop-
ment and make any final product inherently unprofitable. Confusion about 
how many patents are involved and how much licensing fees and royalty 
payments add to R&D costs can scare off potential investors. In some cases, 
uncertainty about the costs is worse than having a solid, though high, 
number to work with.
In the following sections, we explain how patents work, how they apply to 
stem cell research, and how they affect funding options.
Understanding how patents work
A patent is a property right. Patent holders can prevent others from using 
their inventions or discoveries without permission, and they can sell rights 
to make, use, or sell their inventions or discoveries through patent licenses. 
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) grants patents in 
three categories:

280
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
 
✓ Utility: Utility patents cover “any new and useful process, machine, 
article of manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful 
improvement thereof.”
 
✓ Design: Design patents are for “a new, original, and ornamental design 
for an article of manufacture,” such as clothing designs.
 
✓ Plants: Plant patents are granted to someone who “invents or discov-
ers and asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant.” 
Agribusiness companies like Monsanto routinely patent unique varieties 
of corn, wheat, and other crops, for example.
 
Under U.S. law, you can’t patent laws of nature (like gravity), naturally occur-
ring phenomena (like water, rainbows, or ground squirrels), or abstract ideas. 
However, you can patent an antigravity machine (assuming that it works and 
is useful in some way) or a genetically modified ground squirrel.
Patenting human DNA, genes, cells, and tissues is controversial, but the 
USPTO has issued thousands of patents for such items. In 2008, the USPTO 
issued 762 patents for “multicellular living organisms and unmodified parts 
thereof and related processes.” Some of those patents were for things like 
genetically modified plants or genetically modified animals. Others were for 
human materials.
Opponents of such patents argue that it turns every component of the human 
body into a commodity. So far, challenges to these types of patents have 
been unsuccessful, and neither Congress nor the courts have restricted 
patent protection for many human bodily materials.
Patents typically are granted for 20 years, during which the holder can sell 
licenses to others that give the buyers some or all rights to manufacture, use, 
sell, or import the item covered by the patent. U.S. patents are valid only in 
the United States and its territories and possessions (like Puerto Rico and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands).
In Europe, the European Patent Office (EPO) issues patents for more than 30 
member countries. EPO regulations prohibit issuing patents for inventions or 
processes that violate the ordre public — the public order or general moral 
sensibilities of the member nations. Therefore, the EPO has denied patent 
requests for commercial or industrial uses of human embryos, as well as 
patent applications for processes used to extract human embryonic stem 
cells and the stem cell lines themselves.
Exploring patents in stem cell research
Since James Thomson first isolated human embryonic stem cells at his 
University of Wisconsin lab in 1998, he and the Wisconsin Alumni Research 
Foundation (WARF) have applied for and received three key U.S. patents:

281
 Chapter 17: Following the Money: Understanding Stem Cell Funding and Profits
 
✓ One for primate embryonic stem cells
 
✓ One for human embryonic stem cells
 
✓ One for the process Thomson and his team developed for isolating 
human embryonic stem cells
(The EPO denied WARF’s attempt to apply the U.S. patents in Europe, citing 
the prohibition against patenting commercial or industrial uses of human 
embryos.)
WARF licenses its patents to researchers around the world and, through a 
subsidiary called WiCell, operates the National Stem Cell Bank. According to 
WiCell’s Web site (www.wicell.org), the National Stem Cell Bank has sup-
plied stem cell lines to more than 670 researchers in industry and academia 
since 1999.
Looking at objections to the WARF patents
Critics complain that the WARF patents are too broad, and several groups 
challenged them in 2006, saying they stifled research and innovation in the 
field. The USPTO upheld the patents in 2009, so, at least for the time being, 
every researcher who wants to use such cells for any purpose has to sign a 
licensing agreement with WARF. In the Frequently Asked Questions section of 
WiCell’s Web site, the subsidiary notes
“While you may obtain stem cells from other sources, you must still enter 
into an agreement with WARF to use the cells in commercial research under 
WARF’s patent rights.”
 
Perhaps in response to the challenges to its patents, WARF relaxed some of its 
licensing policies in 2007. It allows academic and nonprofit labs to use embry-
onic stem cells without paying a licensing fee, and for-profit companies and 
organizations can sponsor research at a nonprofit or academic facility without 
obtaining a license from WARF. However, if the sponsored research moves to 
the company’s own facilities or leads to a product for market, the companies 
have to obtain a license, which typically involves an upfront fee, charges to 
reimburse WARF for its patent costs (which can easily top $250,000), annual 
maintenance fees (for keeping the license active), and royalties on every unit 
of the final product that’s sold.
WARF doesn’t reveal how much it earns from its stem cell patents. However, 
the Wisconsin State Journal reported in 2006 that the foundation had earned 
$3.2 million in license fees since 1999; three-quarters of that revenue was 
funneled back into research. Upfront fees can range from $25,000 to $2 mil-
lion; annual maintenance fees can be another $25,000 or more. Royalties on 

282
Part V: Understanding the Debate: Ethics, Laws, and Money 
developed products or technologies usually run between 1 percent and 5 per-
cent per unit, and WARF’s typical licensing agreement requires a minimum 
royalty payment regardless of how many units are sold.
One of the most controversial clauses in WARF’s licensing agreement is the 
so-called reach-through royalty provision. If the licensee hires a separate com-
pany to manufacture its product, the WARF license calls for that manufac-
turer to pay royalties — a provision that critics say can increase production 
costs beyond the point where the manufacturer can make a profit.
Cutting through patent thickets
A patent thicket occurs when several companies or individuals hold patent 
rights that may apply to a specific invention, such as a drug or medical 
device. For example, biotech company Geron, which is working on clinical 
trials for treating acute spinal cord injuries with stem cell-based drugs (see 
Chapter 12), bought exclusive licenses from WARF to come up with commer-
cial uses for neural, pancreatic, and heart muscle cells. Other researchers 
who want to develop drugs using any of these types of cells — say, pancre-
atic cells to treat diabetes — may have to pay WARF if any part of their work 
involves human embryonic stem cells and then pay Geron if they develop a 
drug therapy from pancreatic cells that they want to bring to market.
In 2009, Pfizer, the world’s largest research-based pharmaceutical company, 
purchased license rights from WARF to work with human embryonic stem 
cells in researching and developing drugs. The terms of the license agree-
ment weren’t disclosed, so no one knows whether other researchers using 
human embryonic stem cells to test and develop drugs have to pay addi-
tional fees to Pfizer.
And biotech company Novocell now holds a patent on endoderm cells — cells 
that can generate pancreatic, lung, liver, and other specific tissues — derived 
from human embryonic stem cells. Novocell also has a patent on a research 
method it developed for using such endoderm cells.
 
As more basic technologies and products — such as specific types of cells — 
become patent-protected, scientists (and those who fund them) have a harder 
time sorting through the licensing requirements, which can slow down or even 
discourage research. To counter this effect, some have suggested setting up 
a clearinghouse of sorts to keep track of patents and licensing requirements 
in stem cell research. Agriculture already has such a mechanism, called the 
Public Intellectual Property Resource for Agriculture — which, incidentally, 
includes WARF among its members.

283
 Chapter 17: Following the Money: Understanding Stem Cell Funding and Profits
Seeing how patents affect funding
The adage in pharmaceuticals is that, for any given drug, it costs 50 cents to 
make the second pill, but it can cost $500 million or more to make the first 
pill. That’s why so many drugs are so expensive: It takes drug makers years 
to recoup their research and development costs, even if actual production 
costs are low.
Companies large and small — ranging from giants like Pfizer, Amgen, and 
GlaxoSmithKline to tiny biotechs like Geron and Novocell — are beginning to 
invest significantly in stem cell research, with the idea that they’ll eventually 
be able to make money from a drug or other product they develop. But these 
companies also are pursuing patents on both their research methods and the 
things they create, because patent licenses can be extremely lucrative.
Public institutions like universities know how lucrative patents can be, 
too, and are fully engaged in the patent chase when it comes to stem cells. 
According to a 2007 analysis in the journal Nature Biotechnology, the top eight 
companies and the top eight public sector institutions each held 13 percent 
of all stem cell patents in the United States.
Still, no single entity, public or private, owns more than 3 percent of all cur-
rent stem cell patents, which means ownership of various technologies and 
products in the field is highly fragmented. If you’re a venture capitalist or 
individual or institutional investor looking to invest in stem cell research, the 
very complexity of the patent landscape may be enough to scare you off.
In fact, the patent issue is one strong argument in favor of government fund-
ing for stem cell research. (See the section “Looking at Government Funding,” 
earlier in this chapter.) Private investors may be leery of supporting stem cell 
research because licensing issues and the uncertainty about royalties and 
business models may eat up a disproportionate amount of potential profits, 
but improving health and medical care is one of government’s main con-
cerns. And, because governments aren’t designed to make profits (although, 
in principle, they shouldn’t lose money, either), they can — and, in the eyes 
of many people, have a responsibility to — put money into research that may 
take years to yield tangible returns.

Chapter 18
Ten (or So) Stem Cell Myths
In This Chapter
▶ Sorting out the facts about embryonic stem cells
▶ Assessing the state of the research
O
ver the years, stem cell science has given rise to its own set of myths 
and urban legends. Some of these myths are built on a kernel or two of 
fact, some are based on outdated information, and some are based on politi-
cal ideology.
In this chapter, we present ten or so of the most common myths and miscon-
ceptions about stem cell research and give you the facts about each one.
Stem Cells Come Only 
from Aborted Fetuses
The old myth that stem cells come only from aborted fetuses is helped along 
in part by the fact that one of the first research teams to isolate one type 
of human stem cells used tissue from aborted fetuses (see Chapter 16). But 
those cells weren’t the same as human embryonic stem cells.
Embryonic stem cells come from blastocysts (see Chapter 4) left over from 
in vitro fertilization treatments. IVF providers fertilize egg cells in a Petri dish 
and let them grow for a few days before they implant the blastocysts in the 
woman’s uterus. Eight to ten blastocysts are created in a typical course of 
IVF, but only one or two are usually implanted at any one time. The excess 
blastocysts are typically frozen and then thawed as needed to start addi-
tional pregnancies. When couples decide to discontinue IVF treatments, 
either because they decide not to have any more children or because the 
treatments didn’t work, the unused blastocysts may be frozen indefinitely, 
donated to other couples seeking fertility treatments, or thrown away as 
medical waste. Because these extra blastocysts are never implanted in a 
woman’s uterus, they can’t grow into fetuses. Some estimates say fertility 
clinics have as many as 400,000 blastocysts stored in freezers, many of which 

288
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
will never be used to start a pregnancy and will eventually be destroyed, 
regardless of whether they’re used for research.
Adult stem cells generally come from tissues like bone marrow and skin and, 
after death, from the liver, lung, and other vital organs.
 
Some so-called “adult” stem cells are derived from aborted fetuses. They’re 
called adult stem cells because they share many of the properties of stem cells 
found in actual human adults. For whatever reason, these particular cells are 
seldom called fetal stem cells, and some scientists and researchers prefer to 
call all these types of cells tissue stem cells to more accurately reflect the cells’ 
properties rather than their source.
Embryos Are Created 
Just to Be Destroyed
Another myth is that embryos are created just to be destroyed. A few human 
embryonic stem cell lines have been created from so-called research embryos — 
that is, embryos that were created for the sole purpose of deriving stem cells. 
However, for the vast majority of embryonic stem cell research, the cell lines are 
derived from extra blastocysts created for in vitro fertilization.
Some people in both the scientific and civilian community would like to see 
researchers create more stem cell lines from research embryos, but the prac-
tice isn’t common (at least not yet), and, under current federal guidelines, no 
federal money is available for studying lines derived from research embryos.
Researchers have generated a few cloned human embryos using nuclear 
transfer techniques (see Chapter 6). So far, none of these embryos has 
yielded a stem cell line, as far as we know. If nuclear transfer becomes a 
common method of creating embryos for stem cell research, you could argue 
that those embryos are created just to be destroyed. However, remember 
that such embryos are probably not capable of starting a pregnancy, at least 
not with today’s technology. The pregnancy failure rate with nuclear transfer 
embryos in animals is something like 97 percent, so there’s little to no inter-
est in attempting this procedure in humans.
In the private sector, a few companies work with embryos created through 
parthenogenesis (see Chapter 6), and these embryos have been created to 
be destroyed. However, parthenogenetic embryos are incapable of starting 
a pregnancy, so the question of whether these embryos really constitute a 
potential human life remains open.
Finally, some researchers are interested in using blastocysts that are dis-
carded after pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD. IVF providers use 

289
 Chapter 18: Ten (or So) Stem Cell Myths
this technique when couples know they carry a genetic mutation that can 
cause a devastating disease in their children. The IVF clinic tests each of the 
eight-cell embryos it creates for the couple to determine which ones carry 
the genetic problem. Those that don’t have the problem are used for implan-
tation. Those that do have the genetic change for the disease are typically 
destroyed, and researchers are interested in using those blastocysts to study 
those diseases.
Stem Cells from Adults Can Do Everything 
Embryonic Stem Cells Can
There was a time when some researchers thought that stem cells from adults 
can do everything embryonic stem cells can. Some scientists claimed to have 
found stem cells in adults that had the same properties as embryonic stem 
cells — the ability to grow practically indefinitely in the lab and to turn into 
any type of cell in the adult body — but further investigation revealed that 
the results of the experiments on these adult cells had been misinterpreted 
or couldn’t be replicated. That kind of error happens sometimes. But current 
data suggests it’s very unlikely that any naturally occurring adult stem cell 
has the kinds of potency found in embryonic stem cells.
That’s not to say that adult stem cells don’t have some pretty valuable prop-
erties themselves. Researchers have learned a lot about connective tissue, 
blood formation, and regenerative properties of the liver and skin, thanks to 
adult stem cells. Lots of leukemia patients and people with some other blood 
disorders are alive today because doctors know how to transplant blood-
forming stem cells from one person to another.
And researchers are working on reprogramming adult cells to more closely 
mimic the properties of embryonic stem cells. So far, the technology isn’t an 
unqualified success, but advances in this line of research are coming quickly 
and are already beginning to make important contributions to the under-
standing of human disease. While such cells are unlikely to replace embry-
onic stem cells, they offer an important additional approach.
Researchers Don’t Need to Create Any 
More Embryonic Stem Cell Lines
Another myth is that researchers don’t need to create any more embryonic 
stem cell lines. In fact, scientists cite several reasons for creating new human 
embryonic stem cell lines. The most important reasons include the following:

290
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
  
✓ Embryonic stem cells aren’t immortal. They can grow and generate 
more of themselves for incredibly long periods, but eventually embry-
onic stem cells begin to show signs of age, much like your body does. 
Sometimes they even pick up genetic changes, which make them less 
useful than “normal” cells.
  
✓ Technological advances can make better-quality stem cells. The meth-
ods used to generate cell lines today very likely aren’t as good as the 
methods that will be available next year. It’s like the difference between 
digital TV and high-definition TV. Digital TV is okay, but it doesn’t 
deliver the same quality as a high-definition signal.
  
✓ If stem cell research leads to the ability to provide transplants for 
large numbers of people, the stem cell lines have to be as genetically 
diverse as possible. Tissue and organ rejection is a major challenge in 
transplantation (see Chapter 13), and stem cell transplants pose the same 
problems. Growing and/or transplanting new tissues and organs with 
a patient’s own genetic code seems to be possible and useful (it’s been 
done, apparently successfully, in a few experimental treatments), but the 
cost may limit its use. In the meantime, genetically diverse stem cells may 
be able to bridge the gap between today’s transplant processes and the 
longer-term goal of patient-specific organ and tissue generation.
 
As long as in vitro fertilization is practiced the way it’s done today, the pro-
cess will create more blastocysts than are needed for the IVF treatment. 
Because many of those excess blastocysts eventually will be thrown away, sci-
entists and supporters of stem cell research argue that, instead of discarding 
them, it’s better to put the extra blastocysts to use by allowing researchers to 
generate new stem cell lines from them — and thus further potentially benefi-
cial research into a variety of human diseases.
Advances in Drug Therapies Eliminate 
the Need for Stem Cell Research
Advances in drug therapies actually don’t eliminate the need for stem cell 
research. Many diseases remain incurable. For some diseases, such as 
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Lou Gehrig’s, the treatments in today’s phar-
macological arsenal simply treat some of the symptoms — and sometimes 
they don’t even treat the symptoms very well. These drugs don’t change 
the course of the disease, and they don’t repair the damage that’s already 
occurred.
The same is true for heart disease. Of the myriad drugs heart patients take 
every day to feel better, few (if any) are capable of repairing damage to the 
heart muscle or extending the patient’s life. Cancer is still difficult to treat 
with drugs, too.

291
 Chapter 18: Ten (or So) Stem Cell Myths
Of course, researchers are continually searching for ways to improve existing 
drugs and create new, better ones. Stem cell research provides an avenue of 
research that will allow scientists to better understand both the disease and 
the effects drugs can have on a disease’s progress.
Stem Cell Research Will 
Lead to Human Cloning
We’re not going to lie to you: The technologies used in stem cell science 
today could, at some point in the distant future, lead to the creation of cloned 
human adults — in much the same way that today’s nuclear energy technol-
ogy could, someday, lead to the annihilation of the human race. But neither 
scenario is particularly likely.
History is replete with instances in which society has placed sensible limits 
on what you can and cannot do with technology. Society doesn’t ban cars or 
electricity or knives or fire because they can be used to hurt people or for 
illicit purposes. Instead, society places restrictions on how you can use cars 
and electricity and knives and fire and penalizes people who misuse them.
The same principles apply to stem cell science and technology. The ability to 
make stem cell lines that are genetically identical to existing people doesn’t 
mean that scientists will — or even want to — generate cloned human babies. 
In fact, the scientific community is virtually united in its opposition to human 
cloning, in part because the technology isn’t close to safe today. Besides, 
scientists are people, too, and they generally find the idea of human cloning 
morally and ethically problematic.
 
A technology’s mere existence doesn’t force its misuse. Human civilization has 
a long track record of tightening the reins on potentially dangerous technolo-
gies, and there’s no reason to suppose that society’s grip on what’s permis-
sible and what isn’t will loosen when it comes to stem cell technology.
If the Research Were Really So Powerful, 
Private Companies Would Fund It
In general, the private sector doesn’t do much basic research; industry is 
more interested in research that can lead to profits fairly quickly. Stem cell 
science is still mostly in the basic research phase, and even the applications 
that researchers are testing today are highly experimental. (See Chapters 16 
and 17 for more on how stem cell research is funded.)

292
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
One of the biggest hurdles for private funding of stem cell research is that no 
one knows for sure how to make money from it yet. You may spend a long 
time and a lot of money to come up with a therapy that’s safe and effective, 
but the therapy might not be something you can sell. If the therapy is more 
akin to an organ transplant than a drug, for example, the money-making 
potential is severely curtailed.
Eventually, companies probably will come up with business models that 
allow them to profit from stem cell research. They’ll patent specific therapies 
and processes and perhaps license them to other companies or hospitals, 
similar to the way software companies license their products to businesses. 
But in the meantime, although the research is important and powerful, the 
direct financial return on investment in basic stem cell research is too uncer-
tain to tempt most private businesses today.
Stem Cells from Adults Are Already 
Curing Many Diseases
Bone marrow transplants are the best — really, the only — example of 
well-documented, safe, and effective use of adult stem cells to cure disease. 
Doctors routinely use bone marrow transplants to treat leukemia and a few 
other blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia. But for other devastating 
diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Lou Gehrig’s, no one has done rigorous, 
double-blind clinical trials — where neither the patient nor the physician mea-
suring the potential benefits knows whether any individual patient is in the 
treatment or control group — demonstrating that any sort of stem cell inter-
ventions will effectively treat or cure those diseases.
 
People sometimes think that, if there’s a clinical trial with adult stem cells, 
people are being treated effectively for a specific illness. That may be true 
in some cases, but clinical trials are really just experiments to see whether 
a therapy is, first, safe and, second, effective. (See Chapter 11 for more on 
clinical trials.) When the sample sizes are small — as they almost always are 
in early clinical trials — one or two patients may get better, but that doesn’t 
mean the treatment works. All kinds of factors can contribute to improved 
health during a clinical trial; that’s why trials are typically conducted in three 
phases — to make sure that the promising results from early phases hold true 
when you expand the sample size.
You should be wary of testimonials from people who’ve participated in stem 
cell and other clinical trials, too. Sometimes participants are in the trial’s con-
trol group and don’t know it; they feel better, so they assume they received 

293
 Chapter 18: Ten (or So) Stem Cell Myths
the treatment, but they may feel better simply because of the placebo effect — 
the brain’s remarkable ability to make you feel better just because you expect 
to feel better. Similarly, some participants might know that they have been 
treated and feel better for many of the same reasons.
 
The only reliable way to know if a therapy truly has a benefit that exceeds its 
risk is when it has been tested on large numbers of patients in double-blind 
clinical trials.
Also, beware of offshore clinics promising cures with stem cell therapies for 
diseases other than leukemia and related diseases. As far as we know, most 
of these claims are overblown at best and fraudulent at worst. There’s little 
or no evidence that any of these so-called therapies work.
Nothing Has Yet Come Out of 
Embryonic Stem Cell Research
Another myth is that nothing has yet come out of embryonic stem cell 
research. Researchers have spent almost 30 years working with mouse 
embryonic stem cells, which has given them enormously improved under-
standing of how cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems work in mammals, 
including humans. Scientists have used mice to create models of human dis-
eases, and they’ve conducted some therapeutic experiments in mice using 
embryonic stem cells. Through the use of mouse embryonic stem cells, sci-
entists have gained enormous insights into tumor suppressors, cancer stem 
cells (see Chapter 8), and other areas of disease biology.
“That’s all well and good,” you’re saying to yourself, “but people aren’t giant, 
furless mice. What about humans?”
Good question. The answer is that those three decades of research with mice 
have set the stage for building the field of stem cell research and therapies 
in humans. Although only a few clinical trials are starting now, if the field fol-
lows the pattern of other science fields with comparable potential, the next 
10 to 20 years may well deliver an explosion in discoveries and developments 
that can reduce human suffering and even save lives.
 
Responsible research is a slow process — sometimes agonizingly slow. 
Sometimes research goes really well, and sometimes it disappoints. But even 
setbacks and failed experiments are valuable, because they eventually lead to 
success.

294
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Hope Equals Hype
Sometimes it seems that stem cell scientists can’t win for losing. If they’re 
too cautious, pointing out the problems and difficulties that have to be sur-
mounted before the science yields safe, effective treatments, people accuse 
them of robbing patients and their families of hope. On the other hand, if 
scientists paint too rosy a picture, people accuse them of overblowing the 
potential of stem cell therapies and underplaying the pitfalls.
Here’s the key: If scientists didn’t believe in the possibilities stem cells rep-
resent, nobody would be working in the field. Yes, the journey toward safe 
and effective medical uses of various kinds of stem cells is most likely a long 
one. Yes, scientists will have to solve a lot of problems and overcome a lot 
of obstacles before they can say, with any degree of certainty, that they’ve 
unlocked the full potential of stem cells.
But time and degree of difficulty have never been good excuses for not doing 
something worthwhile. (If they were good excuses, no one would ever have 
children.) Not starting the journey, or quitting when you’re part of the way 
there, just guarantees that you’ll never reach your destination. And, who 
knows? Maybe scientists will discover a breakthrough that will speed things 
up considerably. But they’ll never find that breakthrough, or any of stem 
cells’ potential, if they end their journey now.
President Bush Banned Embryonic 
Stem Cell Research
Actually, President George W. Bush didn’t ban embryonic stem cell research. 
He did the opposite: He began federal funding for embryonic stem cell 
research. On August 9, 2001, he announced a policy that allowed the federal 
government to finance research on embryonic stem cells lines that existed 
as of that date. While there was some confusion about how many lines were 
available and how to go about getting them, Bush’s policy was an enormous 
step forward for the field, and he deserves credit for implementing it.
As the science progressed, Bush’s policy proved to be imperfect (as many 
policies are). Many of the existing lines turned out to be contaminated or 
otherwise compromised. New embryonic stem cell lines, generated with 
private funds, often demonstrated better properties than the ones Bush per-
mitted funding for. But those subsequent discoveries don’t change the fact 
that Bush was the first president to allow federal funding of embryonic stem 
cell research. So far from banning it, he encouraged it by opening the purse 
strings.

Chapter 19
Ten Hurdles to Stem Cell Use
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the challenges in research
▶ Looking into issues for real-world treatments
W
hile stem cells hold great promise for treating a plethora of diseases, 
scientists have to resolve several issues before stem cell therapies 
become standard treatment for most ailments. In some cases, researchers 
need to know much more about how diseases work before they can figure 
out whether stem cells may provide useful treatments. In other cases, simply 
growing enough cells to learn about disease or test potential drugs is the 
main challenge.
In this chapter, we list ten obstacles researchers must overcome for stem cell 
science to reach its full potential.
Knowing Whether Stem Cells Can 
Actually Fix What Ails You
Before researchers can apply stem cell therapies to diseases, they need to 
understand each disease well enough to know whether there’s an appropri-
ate stem cell treatment, what that treatment might be, and how to use it. 
While you don’t have to know everything about a disease in order to treat 
it, the more you know the better off you are, and the deeper understanding 
sometimes helps you know which cells to target. The cell that dies isn’t nec-
essarily the cell at fault; other cells may be making the dying cells sick.
In Type 1 diabetes, for example, you may be able to replace worn out beta 
cells in the pancreas to produce insulin, but that alone won’t fix the problem; 
you have to figure out how to keep the immune system from attacking the 
beta cells, too (see Chapter 10). In Lou Gehrig’s disease, on the other hand, 
stem cell scientists have discovered that stem cells may be able to help in 
simpler ways than they initially anticipated; although the main problem in 
Lou Gehrig’s is that motor neurons die, stem cell therapy may be able to fix 

296
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
the surrounding cells that normally support the health of the motor neurons 
(see Chapter 9).
 
For lots of diseases, scientists are still trying to identify the mechanisms that 
cause the disease and whether stem cells can alter those mechanisms — by 
replacing missing cells, or delivering a product that the cells are missing, or 
stimulating better cell behavior in some way. Figuring those things out, and 
then testing potential therapies, will take much more research.
Cultivating Enough Cells
Even for diseases that scientists understand well, designing effective treat-
ments presents several challenges. First on the list is being able to cultivate 
enough cells to conduct research and create treatments. If you’re going to 
screen lots of chemicals in your search for safe, effective drugs, you need a 
lot of cells to conduct tests on. If you’re going to treat a disease with actual 
cells, you need to grow enough cells to do the job (and, for most diseases, no 
one yet knows what the “right” number of cells is).
 
Not only do you need to grow the cells, but you need to grow them properly 
to ensure that they’re safe to use for treating humans. In the United States, the 
Food and Drug Administration regulates the conditions for growing cells that 
are intended for human use. These conditions are sometimes known as good 
manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions, and they’re designed to ensure that 
the cells aren’t contaminated with unwanted viruses, bacteria, or other ele-
ments that could make them unsafe.
Different kinds of stem cells present different cultivation issues. Embryonic 
stem cells are the least challenging; they grow well in the lab, and scientists 
have pretty reliable methods of separating embryonic stem cells from other 
kinds of cells so that they can work with pure embryonic stem cells. The main 
issue with embryonic stem cells is what happens after you grow them in the 
lab: When you prompt them to create specific types of cells, you have to make 
sure that the resulting cells either function as normal cells in the body would 
(or, if they’re intended to function in unusual ways, that they work the way you 
want them to) and that they’re pure enough to use for the purpose you intend. 
(See the section “Eliminating Unwanted Cells,” later in this chapter.)
For other kinds of cells, cultivation is more challenging. You can harvest 
small amounts of hematopoietic or blood-forming stem cells from umbilical 
cord blood, bone marrow, or the blood that circulates throughout the body. 
But nobody has yet figured out a way to grow large numbers of them in the 
lab; for some reason, these stem cells just don’t reproduce themselves well 
outside the body.
And for solid organs, it’s unclear whether you can grow enough tissue stem 
cells for study, testing, or treatment. Most tissues and organs, such as the 

297
 Chapter 19: Ten Hurdles to Stem Cell Use
liver, brain, and intestines, have only small populations of stem cells; even 
skin stem cells, which are arguably the most populous form of tissue stem 
cells, can be difficult to harvest and grow in the lab.
Getting the Right Cells for the Job
Making sure that you have the right cells to accomplish your goal involves 
more than just ensuring that you don’t use liver cells to treat a brain disease. 
Most tissues and organs in your body consist of two or more types of cells, 
so scientists have to figure out how to make the right kinds of cells, how to 
tell them what to do, and how to mix them in the right proportion and get 
them to form the right architecture — especially if scientists want to make 
bits and pieces of tissues and organs. If you’re going to make a chunk of liver 
in the lab, for example, you need more than one type of liver cell. But you 
don’t want cells from other organs mixed in with the liver cells. (See the sec-
tion “Eliminating Unwanted Cells,” later in this chapter.)
 
Getting the right kinds of cells in the right combination is one issue. Getting 
enough of the right kinds of stem cells also is an issue because, in some cases, 
you can’t get enough from the tissue itself to perform rigorous tests. In other 
cases, you can get lots of cells, but not necessarily the kind you need to 
advance research and therapy development.
Even when scientists are trying to make a single type of cell, they face a number 
of quality control issues; that is, they need to be sure that the cells they’re looking 
at in a culture dish are really the cells they wanted to make — a beta cell or a liver 
cell or what have you. Determining that you’ve got the right kind of cell involves 
more than just its outward appearance (lots of different cell types look similar 
under a microscope); scientists have to perform a number of tests to make sure 
that the cells have all the right markers (see Chapter 2), the right structure, and 
the right kinds of functions at the proper levels. Scientists also have to make sure 
that the cells are stable and will live long enough to do their jobs.
 
The criteria for establishing that a cell is indeed a beta cell or what have you 
are evolving as researchers discover more about the inner workings and coop-
erative behaviors of different kinds of cells.
Eliminating Unwanted Cells
In principle, if you’re going to treat a disease with a stem cell transplant of 
some sort — such as blood-forming stem cells for leukemia and other blood 
disorders, or pancreatic beta cells for diabetes — you want those cells to be 
as pure as possible. Why? Because unwanted cells can behave in unwanted 
ways. They can wander around the body, settle in “foreign” tissues or organs, 
and form tumors, for example.

298
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Even after you induce stem cells to differentiate, some residual stem cells 
remain; after all, their natural function is to reproduce themselves so that 
there’s always a pool from which to create more specialized cells. No one 
knows how pure the cells have to be to avoid problems in the body. If you 
have one stem cell for every 100 differentiated cells, will that one stem cell 
give rise to a tumor somewhere? What if there’s one stem cell for every 1,000 
differentiated cells, or for every 10,000? And does the purity level have to be 
the same for every transplant? Or could you get away with one in 100 for cer-
tain tissues, but not for others? Stem cell scientists are looking for answers to 
all these questions, but no one has come up with any definitive rules, or even 
general guidelines yet.
Scientists are working on developing methods to grow only one kind of spe-
cialized cell from stem cells, but no one has quite mastered that approach. 
So, for now, researchers use a variety of methods; for example, they use fluo-
rescent-activated cell sorters (see Chapter 4) to separate different cell types 
when they’re working with smaller numbers of cells. Other methods include 
using antibodies or other reagents that bind to specific types of cells.
Matching Cells and Patients
Unless you take cells (or tissues or organs) from a patient and put them back 
into the same patient, you have to make sure that the transplanted cells are 
a close genetic match to the patient’s genetic makeup. If they aren’t a close 
match, the patient’s body will reject the transplant (see Chapter 13).
 
Depending on the disease, using a patient’s own cells may not be feasible. In 
leukemia, for example, if you harvest the blood-forming stem cells, you have to 
be sure that they’re not contaminated with cancer cells; you also have to make 
sure that the blood-forming stem cells haven’t acquired the cancer-causing 
mutations that led to the disease in the first place. Otherwise, if you simply re-
inject those cells into the patient, you essentially give her leukemia again.
The best donor-recipient matches are between identical twins, whose genetic 
makeup is exactly the same. The next best matches, usually, are between 
non-identical siblings — fraternal twins or other siblings from the same set 
of parents — because, although their genetic makeup isn’t identical, they can 
be pretty close. For donors and recipients who have no blood ties, though, 
a transplant won’t work unless their HLAs — human leukocyte antigens — 
match. (See Chapter 13 for more on matching donors and recipients.)
The genetic makeup of an embryonic stem cell line is essentially random in 
relation to any given patient; that is, there’s no guarantee the genetic makeup 
of the cells will match the patient’s genetic makeup, so embryonic stem 
cells — and any cells derived from them — have to be matched just as any 
other donor tissue or organ would be. So you have to have a large number 

299
 Chapter 19: Ten Hurdles to Stem Cell Use
of embryonic stem cell lines to provide enough genetic diversity to find 
matches for individual patients.
Technologies like nuclear transfer or reprogramming (see Chapter 6) may 
help solve the problem of genetic matching because you can create geneti-
cally matched cells with these techniques. But these technologies are fairly 
new, so it’s not clear yet what it’ll take to make them safe and affordable for 
routine usage. As yet, nobody knows whether these methods will turn out to 
be efficient for creating pluripotent cells for therapeutic use.
Researchers also are investigating ways of altering the genetic makeup of 
stem cells (embryonic or adult) to match the transplant rejection markers 
(see Chapter 13) to the patient. This approach would, in theory, eliminate 
the need for immune-suppressing drugs and enhance the likelihood that the 
patient’s body would accept the transplant.
Delivering Cells to Their Destination
In some ways, stem cell scientists would have an easier job if all cells 
behaved like blood-forming stem cells. When you inject blood-forming stem 
cells into the bloodstream, they home in on their proper niche in the bone 
marrow and travel there; they don’t dillydally or look around for other places 
to settle into. And, when they reach their proper home, they go about their 
business of making all the kinds of cells they’re supposed to make, without 
outside direction or any fuss. Other cells, unfortunately, don’t seem to do 
that — at least not automatically. So researchers are working on the problem 
of getting the cells where they’re supposed to go.
Sometimes you can get away with injecting the cells into a vein. For example, 
in the Edmonton protocol for diabetes (see Chapter 12), you can inject pan-
creatic beta cells into veins in the liver, and they’ll do their job even though 
they aren’t in their normal location. In some cases, though, delivering the 
cells likely will involve surgical methods. Suppose that you want to deliver 
cells to the heart, for example; in many cases, you may be able to deliver 
them with a catheter, using a vein or artery, but if scientists someday can use 
stem cells to make replacement heart tissues like valves, delivering those tis-
sues likely will involve cracking the chest — open heart surgery, in essence. 
In the brain, sometimes the damage is deep inside the tissues, so delivering 
cells on a rescue or repair mission likely would involve some sort of brain 
surgery.
As scientists study diseases and test potential therapies, finding the right 
delivery mode is a key aspect of their research. In many cases, cell-based 
therapies may have to be delivered directly to the affected organ or tissue 
to be effective and to avoid unwanted effects. But in other cases, research-
ers may be able to develop drugs or other delivery mechanisms that are less 
invasive than surgery.

300
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Keeping Track of Cells
One of the biggest issues in creating stem cell-based therapies for humans is 
making sure that the cells do what they’re supposed to do and that they go 
where they’re supposed to go — and stay there. The more tinkering that’s 
done in the lab, the more open the question of how the cells will behave in 
the body. Even if the cells are purified, and even if you’ve figured out the 
right delivery method, how do you know that they’ve stayed where you put 
them and are doing the job they’re meant to do?
In some cases, radiology — X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 
so on — probably will be the most effective way of tracking transplanted 
cells to make sure that they don’t go wandering off into other parts of the 
body. And blood tests may be able to measure whether the cells are perform-
ing their jobs correctly and sufficiently. These issues will have to be resolved 
before stem cell-based therapies become commonplace.
 
If you start a clinical trial to test a drug and patients have adverse reactions, 
you can stop giving them the drug. But taking transplanted stem cells out of a 
patient when they cause problems isn’t as straightforward. So researchers are 
working on developing a number of potential exit strategies — ways to control 
the transplanted cells if they start misbehaving. One idea is to give the cells 
genetic tweaks that make them sensitive to certain drugs; if the cells cause 
problems, you can administer a drug to deactivate or kill the cells. Another 
idea, which is more technically complicated, is to equip the transplanted cells 
with a genetic off switch that reacts to antibiotics, prompting the cell to essen-
tially commit suicide.
Tracking cells also is an issue for preclinical research. When you’re test-
ing potential drugs, for example, you have to be able to measure the effects 
those drugs have on the cells. If you’re working with a mixture of different 
cell types, you need to know whether the drugs affect the right cells in the 
right way, and you also need to know whether the other cells in the mixture 
are influencing either the target cells or the drug’s behavior. It gets compli-
cated pretty quickly, which is why research is so often such a slow and labo-
rious process.
Ensuring Safety
Because so many aspects of stem cell science are relatively new — human 
embryonic stem cells were only isolated a decade ago, and techniques for 
growing and differentiating them are even younger — no one’s sure exactly 
what safety issues may arise in using cells made from these stem cells in 

301
 Chapter 19: Ten Hurdles to Stem Cell Use
humans. In some instances, the safety of the technique or treatment is pretty 
well accepted; in bone marrow transplants, for example, scientists know that 
taking the blood-forming cells from one person and putting them back in the 
same person is usually okay.
But in other cases, the safety issues aren’t understood as well. Researchers 
know that if they put pure embryonic stem cells into an animal, those cells 
will form tumors called teratomas. While teratomas are usually benign in 
animals, benign doesn’t mean that those tumors are completely harmless. 
For example, if a benign teratoma grows in the brain, it’ll put pressure on sur-
rounding cells and can eventually lead to paralysis and even death. Clearly, 
no one wants a therapy that carries a significant risk of teratoma formation. 
But researchers also know that, in animals at least, if you induce the embry-
onic stem cells to differentiate and then separate the differentiated cells from 
any remaining embryonic stem cells, the differentiated cells usually don’t 
seem to cause any problems. (See the section “Eliminating Unwanted Cells,” 
earlier in this chapter.)
Apart from issues regarding the safety of the cells themselves, researchers 
have to figure out which delivery methods are the safest and most effective — 
and that may not always be the obvious answer. If you want to replace part of 
the pancreas, for example, maybe it doesn’t have to go back into the pancreas; 
maybe it can go into the veins in the liver. And maybe pieces of liver can safely 
be placed outside the liver and still do their jobs effectively. One of the many 
questions scientists still have to answer is to what extent the architecture of 
the target tissues affects safety and efficacy.
 
Then there are all the safety issues no one knows about yet. What scientists 
don’t know about stem cells — or any new or experimental therapy or drug — 
can hurt you, which is why research in the lab and well-designed clinical trials 
(see the following section) are so critical before scientists can make treat-
ments widely available to the general public.
Setting Up Clinical Trials
Clinical trials help researchers determine how safe and effective potential 
treatments are (see Chapter 11). But setting up trials presents some chal-
lenges, too:
 
✓ Cost: Clinical trials are expensive. Healthcare professionals who admin-
ister the trials have to be trained on the protocols. Participants typically 
are given free medical care, which means someone else has to pay for 
that benefit. The treatment itself usually is costly because there’s no 
economy of scale at this stage of development. And various stages of 
trials can last several years.

302
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Design: Trials have to be set up to guarantee as much safety as possible 
for the participants, and, to get reliable results, they have to be designed 
to minimize the placebo effect. The gold standard for reliable trials is 
the double-blind design, where neither the patient nor the people admin-
istering the trial know who’s getting the treatment and who’s not. Trials 
also have to be crafted so that both the trial itself and the results are 
accurately reported so that people can make informed decisions about 
whether to participate in additional trials or whether to seek the treat-
ment outside a clinical trial.
 
✓ Size: To get statistically significant results — that is, to prove that the 
treatment is safe and effective for large numbers of patients — trials 
have to enroll large numbers of participants, especially if the effects of 
the treatment are small. (If the effects are huge, you can get by with a 
smaller number of participants to demonstrate a treatment’s effective-
ness.) Size is a problem for many diseases because, in some cases, the 
disease being treated is fairly rare, so the patient population is small. In 
other cases, such as many types of cancer, patients often elect to have 
standard treatments first and pass on clinical trials for experimental 
treatments. This tendency to seek tried-and-tested treatments first is 
especially problematic if you want to test your experimental treatment 
on people who haven’t undergone standard therapies.
Of course, the challenges of clinical trials don’t arise until after the earlier chal-
lenges of research have been resolved. But they’re there, and they have to be 
dealt with when new areas of stem cell science are ready to take that step.
Figuring Out Healthcare Delivery
When we say healthcare delivery, we’re not talking about healthcare reform, 
but about the logistics of getting treatments into the hands of doctors who 
can use them for their patients. Think of the annual flu shots and the difficul-
ties physicians face in getting the vaccine to the people who need it.
Transplant patients already face this challenge; only a handful of hospitals 
around the country are equipped to handle transplants. Then there’s the 
question of insurance coverage; today, most stem cell therapies are experi-
mental, and most health insurers won’t pay for experimental treatments. 
That likely will change as therapies are tested in clinical trials and approved 
for widespread use, but it’s a challenge for the time being.
 
The best treatment in the world is useless if you can’t deliver it to the people 
who need it in a timely, affordable, reliable manner. Stem cell scientists and 
physicians are united in their desire to find ways to make these treatments 
generally available so that they do the most good for the greatest number of 
people.

Ten Possibilities for the 
Future of Stem Cells
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing where stem cell research is heading
▶ Identifying areas with real potential for effective treatments
M
edia reports are full of all kinds of claims about what scientists can do 
with stem cells. Every time a research team gets a positive result from 
an experiment, it seems, the headlines trumpet it as settled fact — and gloss 
over (or ignore completely) the caveats that responsible scientists nearly 
always include in their scientific reports.
So you can be forgiven for viewing such reports as just fantastical hype. In 
fact, we encourage you to be skeptical about these things. Your motto when 
reading and assessing coverage of stem cell science should be “Important, if 
true.” Remember, to be considered scientifically valid, experimental results 
have to be reproducible — that is, other researchers using the same methods 
should come up with the same results. The best way to evaluate whether 
reported results are valid is to look for other examples of researchers report-
ing similar findings.
That said, stem cell science has yielded a lot of intriguing and exciting leads 
for developing new medical treatments. In this chapter, we discuss ten areas 
where stem cells have real potential for resolving some serious health prob-
lems in the next 5, 10, or 20 years.
Fighting and Winning the War on Cancer
The whole notion of cancer stem cells is potentially revolutionizing the way 
scientists and physicians look at some (or even all) cancers (see Chapter 8). 
Traditionally, treatment has focused on trying to remove cancers via surgery 
or to kill all the cancer cells in the body with powerful drugs or radiation 
treatments. But scientists are learning that, at least in some forms of cancer, 

304
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
a small population of cancer cells is particularly resistant to these treatments 
and seems to have stem cell-like properties — the ability to renew them-
selves and the ability to generate all the cell types in the tumor. So killing 
cancer becomes analogous to getting rid of an ant colony: You can kill every 
single worker ant, but if the queen survives, the colony will pop up again.
The more scientists discover about normal stem cells and cancer stem cells, 
the better equipped they are to figure out new ways to defeat cancer. They 
can study cancer stem cells to learn more about how they operate, and they 
can use them to test potential drugs and other treatments.
Stem cell biology also opens the door to better control of graft-versus-host 
disease (when the immune functions of transplanted cells and tissues attack 
the recipient’s cells and tissues). In leukemia treatments (see Chapter 13), a 
little bit of graft-versus-host activity helps mop up residual cancer cells that 
chemo and radiation missed. But too much graft-versus-host presents real 
problems, so better controls mean better outcomes for patients. In addition, 
stem cell science may well lead to genetic engineering methods that may be 
able to improve tissue matching for blood-forming stem cell transplants — 
another way to control graft-versus-host disease when treating some kinds of 
cancer.
 
Scientists and physicians have been fighting the so-called “war on cancer” 
since President Nixon declared it in 1971. Treatments and survival rates have 
made enormous strides in the past 40 years, but cancer still claims about 
500,000 lives in the United States every year. Although actual cures for all can-
cers still seem to be far off, stem cell, genetic engineering, and drug discovery 
technologies have the potential for finally pushing this particular health-issue 
war closer to and maybe into the “won-and-done-with” column.
Developing Drugs that Tell Your 
Stem Cells What to Do
Under normal circumstances, the various caches of stem cells in your body 
do their jobs without any fuss or fanfare. Stem cells in your skin and bone 
marrow work virtually around the clock, renewing themselves and making 
new specialized cells. But in most of your tissues, they’re usually pretty inac-
tive (scientists call this state quiescence) — and, in some cases, they’re inac-
tive even when a burst of activity may be beneficial.
Scientists are playing with the idea of creating drugs that can make specific 
caches of stem cells more enthusiastic about their jobs. Imagine, for example, 
a drug that could tell stem cells in your brain to make new neurons and 

305
 Chapter 20: Ten Possibilities for the Future of Stem Cells
supporting cells to replace those that die off in Alzheimer’s or other neurode-
generative diseases (see Chapter 9). Some research teams are already work-
ing on finding such drugs.
 
Finding such drugs isn’t easy. Researchers don’t know nearly enough yet 
about how stem cells that reside in tissues operate. This lack of understand-
ing drives basic research that’s aimed at figuring out which stem cells are in 
which places in specific tissues, as well as the signals and mechanisms that 
tell them when to divide and make particular types of cells to repair or replen-
ish that tissue.
When researchers answer those questions, they’ll be making even more con-
certed efforts to find drugs that can stimulate stem cell activity — or perhaps 
even direct stem cells to modify their normal jobs to meet specific needs cre-
ated by disease or injury.
Sound too science-fiction-y? Well, as of this writing, it is the stuff of the 
future. But, given what researchers already know and the directions their 
investigations are taking, it’s not unrealistic. Knowing how stem cells work in 
their normal environments can unlock all kinds of intriguing possibilities for 
revolutionizing the way some diseases are treated.
Growing Replacement Tissues in the Lab
Scientists are already working on growing skin in the lab to treat burns and 
pancreatic beta cells to treat diabetes, as well as other bits and pieces of vari-
ous tissues and organs. Many researchers anticipate eventually being able to 
grow brain cells, liver cells, and blood cells that can be used to treat a variety 
of diseases. And, some day, scientists may even be able to generate entire 
organs in the lab — a breakthrough that would benefit the 70,000 or more 
Americans who wait in vain for suitable organ donors every year.
Okay, so growing whole livers or hearts or kidneys in the lab sounds a little 
farfetched. But it isn’t as crazy as it sounds. Organs are architectural struc-
tures, with defined blueprints, so to speak, that show where different types 
of cells go. Growing a replacement organ is a matter of making the right kinds 
of cells, purifying them to make sure that there aren’t any foreign cells, and 
combining those purified cells in the right ratios on the right architectural 
scaffolding. In fact, the recent case of a woman who received an artificially 
engineered trachea (windpipe), built with her own mesenchymal stem cells 
on the scaffold of a piece of windpipe from a cadaver, hints at the possibili-
ties ahead. Trust us: The era of lab-generated replacement organs is coming. 
It isn’t here yet, but it’s coming.

306
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
To make replacement tissues or organs, researchers have to figure out how to 
make the right kinds of scaffolds from the right materials. To build the replace-
ment trachea we mention in the preceding paragraph, for example, doctors 
took a piece of trachea from a cadaver and stripped it of all the donor’s cells, 
leaving only the naturally occurring scaffold of proteins and other molecules 
that the cells normally grow in and around. Then they repopulated the trachea 
scaffold with cells grown from the patient’s stem cells. This method may work 
well for some other organs and tissues; bioengineers are working hard to 
figure out ways to build replacement tissues and organs, using either biologi-
cal or synthetic materials for scaffolds.
Healing Spinal Cord Injuries
When the spinal cord is injured, motor neurons around the injury site lose 
their myelin, the sheath of fatty tissue that helps the motor neurons con-
duct electrical impulses to the muscles to generate voluntary movement. 
Researchers are investigating ways to repair or restore myelin; one U.S. 
company received approval in 2009 to conduct clinical trials on a treat-
ment that uses human embryonic stem cells to generate the cells that can 
rebuild myelin (although the trial hadn’t actually begun as of this writing; see 
Chapter 12). Repairing the motor neurons themselves or restoring myelin can 
each have benefits for spinal cord injury patients.
 
Researchers face two issues in treating spinal cord injury. One issue is restor-
ing the connections between the brain and the muscles. Working with motor 
neurons is tricky because scientists have to figure out how to make sure that 
these types of neurons “wire” correctly into the central nervous system and 
out to the muscles.
The second issue is generating enough myelin to permit these neurons to 
conduct signals properly. The axons on motor neurons — the long nerve 
fibers that stretch from the cell body to the muscles — can be 3 feet long or 
longer, so you need quite a bit of myelin to cover the entire axon.
Another challenge is repairing older spinal cord injuries, where muscle atro-
phy may inhibit recovery even if the myelin is replaced and the axon is cor-
rectly wired.
Improving Treatments for Huntington’s, 
Lou Gehrig’s, and Parkinson’s Disease
One goal in treating neurodegenerative diseases is to use stem cells — 
embryonic, neuronal, or other types — to make replacement neurons 

307
 Chapter 20: Ten Possibilities for the Future of Stem Cells
or other cell types for those that die or malfunction in these diseases. 
Researchers appear to be closest to applying this approach to Huntington’s, 
Lou Gehrig’s, and Parkinson’s disease (see Chapter 9), in part because all 
these diseases have hereditary forms (Huntington is entirely hereditary) that 
researchers can study to figure out the mechanisms of the disease — or at 
least its hereditary forms.
Scientists also are using stem cells to generate human neurons that carry the 
genetic changes that cause these diseases so that they can test potential drugs 
in hopes of finding one (or more) that will stop the disease’s progression. Larry’s 
lab, for example, is using this approach for Alzheimer’s disease — generating 
embryonic and reprogrammed stem cells that carry the genetic changes that can 
cause Alzheimer’s disease, using those cells to generate human neurons with 
these genetic changes, and treating them with various chemical combinations to 
see if any of them impede the disease mechanisms.
 
Both of these approaches are important because eventual treatments may 
combine them. Patients may take drugs to stop the disease’s progression, for 
example, and then undergo additional therapy to repair or replace neurons 
that have already been damaged. Researchers aren’t there yet, but tune in five 
years from now — you may see amazing developments in that time.
Helping Stroke Victims
Stroke victims suffer the same sort of damage as patients with other neuro-
degenerative diseases: a blood clot or bleeding in the brain damages neurons 
and other brain cells, in many cases leading to severe impairment of muscle 
control, speech, and other functions.
Stem cell researchers are investigating ways to minimize and repair the 
damage from stroke. Possible approaches include creating new tissues to 
repair the damaged area or new blood vessels to restore the nutrient supply. 
Some researchers are testing so-called rescue therapies in which stem cells 
can be infused into the stroke site to limit the damage. Other scientists are 
looking into reprogramming the brain’s own stem cells to induce them to pro-
vide rescue and repair services outside their normal niche.
 
The brain is an incredibly complex organ, and scientists don’t fully under-
stand how it all works yet. The challenges to developing effective treatments 
for any type of brain injury or disease involve making sure that you get the 
right treatment to the right region of the brain and resolving “wiring” issues to 
ensure that any therapy works in concert with the brain’s natural functions.

308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Beating Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) presents two main issues: The immune system gets 
out of whack and begins attacking neurons, and neurons lose their myelin so 
that they can’t conduct electrical signals properly.
Bone marrow transplants may resolve the immune system problem because 
you can replace the blood- and immune-forming stem cells in the body 
(see Chapter 13). Another approach is to develop drugs that turn down 
the immune system, or use embryonic stem cells to redirect or control the 
immune cells that have gone haywire.
Replacing lost myelin may involve using stem cells to grow the cells that gen-
erate myelin — oligodendrocytes in the brain and Schwann’s cells for motor 
and sensory neurons (see Chapter 9) — and transplanting them into the 
patient.
Reversing Retinal Degeneration
Many eye diseases remain stubbornly resistant to treatment, and diseases 
that affect the retina, the layers of nerve tissue behind the cornea and lens 
that convert light and images to electrical signals, are the most difficult to 
treat. Unlike corneas, retinas can’t be transplanted, so when the cells in the 
retina are damaged or die off, vision is typically permanently impaired. In 
age-related macular degeneration, for example, the macula, which lies at the 
back of the retina, is either displaced or breaks down, causing a loss of cen-
tral vision. People with this disease often see a dark spot in the middle of 
anything they look at; as the disease progresses, the dark spot widens, and 
eventually people go blind.
In glaucoma, the optic nerve, which leads from the retina to the brain and 
sends the retina’s electrical signals to the brain, is damaged by pressure. If 
caught early, it can be treated with drugs or surgery, but it’s often diagnosed 
only after permanent damage has been done. Worldwide, glaucoma is the 
second-leading cause of blindness.
In recent years, stem cell scientists have reported encouraging results in 
repairing retinal damage. One research team, for example, injected neural 
stem cells into the retinas of rats that had genetic variations that lead to 
blindness. The researchers reported that the cells migrated to the damaged 
areas of the retina and transformed into normal-looking retina nerve cells, 
even growing apparently normal nerve fibers that extended to the optic 
nerve. Of course, it’s hard to tell whether the rats’ vision actually improved, 
but the stem cells’ migration and repair activity could pave the way for new 
treatments for glaucoma and other diseases that damage the optic nerve or 
neurons in the retina.

309
 Chapter 20: Ten Possibilities for the Future of Stem Cells
Other researchers are working on creating new photoreceptor cells, the cells 
in the retina that sense light. The two main types of photoreceptor cells are 
rods and cones: Rods provide black-and-white vision and work mainly in low 
light, while cones help the brain perceive color and function mainly in day-
light and other bright conditions. Scientists are developing techniques for 
making new rods and cones from embryonic stem cells and induced pluripo-
tent stem cells (see Chapter 6).
Yet another avenue toward treating retinal disease is using other kinds of eye 
cells to deliver drugs or viruses that can impel the retina to work better (see 
Chapter 9).
Fixing a Broken Heart
Scientists have no shortage of ideas about what to do to improve treatments 
for damaged or failing hearts. Right now, the simplest ideas — which are 
being tested in clinical trials — include trying to induce generation of new 
blood vessels to improve nutrient delivery to the affected region of the heart 
and introducing new tissue to replace damaged heart tissues.
Researchers are pursuing other possibilities, too, such as developing pieces 
of heart tissues from embryonic stem cells (or other kinds of stem cells) to 
either replace or stimulate repair of damaged areas. Some scientists also are 
investigating using stem cells to build replacement valves, new cardiac pace-
makers, or vessels that are damaged by disease or injury.
And, some day (it’ll be a while, of course), scientists may be able to build arti-
ficial hearts — not from mechanical materials, but from biological materials 
and scaffolds so that these manufactured hearts really work the way they’re 
supposed to.
Assisting Diabetes Patients
Researchers face two sets of challenges when it comes to diabetes. In Type 
1 diabetes, the immune system attacks the beta cells in the pancreas, which 
produce insulin. When the beta cells are damaged or destroyed, the body 
doesn’t produce any insulin, so other cells in the body never get the mes-
sage to take up sugar (a major cellular energy source) from the bloodstream. 
In Type 2 diabetes, other cells in the body become resistant to insulin; in 
essence, they ignore insulin’s signals to take up sugar. The beta cells in the 
pancreas then work overtime to produce more insulin in an effort to get the 
other cells to respond, and eventually the beta cells wear out from overwork.

310
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
For Type 1, scientists are looking at ways to make new beta cells; possibilities 
include growing them from embryonic stem cells or from other cells in the 
pancreas, which could be harvested from patients or living donors or from 
deceased donors.
Then they have to figure out how to keep the immune system from attacking 
the new beta cells. In the Edmonton protocol (see Chapter 12), the patient 
receives a transplant of pancreatic islets — the places where beta cells hang 
out — along with a cocktail of immune-suppressing drugs. So far, the proto-
col seems to be effective at curbing some of the aspects of Type 1 diabetes, 
but few patients can give up daily insulin supplements (usually injections) 
over the long term.
In Type 2 diabetes, the first challenge is replacing the beta cells; the second 
is figuring out how to counter other cells’ resistance to insulin. Stem cell 
scientists are working on creating genetically compatible beta cells, as well 
as searching for drugs that can make other cells in the body pay attention to 
insulin’s message.

Ten (or So) Things to Do Before 
You Consider Stem Cell Treatment
In This Chapter
▶ Separating realistic possibilities from overblown hype
▶ Being your own best investigator
I
n recent years, so-called medical tourism has exploded, as people seek 
treatments overseas for often debilitating, and sometimes fatal, diseases. 
Celebrities often travel the world to receive unusual or experimental treat-
ments; when Farrah Fawcett was fighting anal cancer — a rare and often 
deadly form of the disease — rumors (apparently unfounded) persisted that 
she was receiving stem cell treatments.
Physicians, scientists, and patient advocates in the United States are sympa-
thetic toward people who are desperate for treatment and hope, especially 
when traditional medical therapies can’t offer either very effective treatment 
or much hope. But these same physicians, scientists, and patient advo-
cates seldom recommend seeking unproven stem cell treatments overseas 
because, in their view, the dangers outweigh the possible benefits. It’s impor-
tant to remember the possible downsides of signing up for an advertised 
“therapy” that isn’t proven — that is, not accepted by mainstream physicians 
and scientists.
If you’re considering seeking stem cell treatment for yourself or a loved one, 
whether at home or abroad, this chapter is essential reading. Here, we tell 
you about ten or so things you should do before you think of signing up for 
any kind of stem cell therapy. (Fair warning: Based on the data and evidence 
available today, we’re highly skeptical of any clinic selling stem cell “treat-
ments” other than bone marrow transplants for certain kinds of blood disor-
ders. In our opinion, most such clinics deal more in false hopes than in actual 
medical therapies.)

312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Look for Independent Oversight 
and Regulation of the Clinic
 
There’s nothing inherently wrong with clinics offering experimental treat-
ments, as long as patients know the treatments are experimental. If you don’t 
have that piece of information, you really can’t give your informed consent 
to the treatment. (See the section “Make Sure That Your Consent Really Is 
Informed,” later in this chapter.)
Unfortunately, clinics located in countries with little or no regulatory over-
sight often don’t disclose that their treatments are experimental at best, or 
guesswork or snake oil at worst. Your best bet is to look for clinics that have 
to comply with a reasonable level of governmental regulation, which typi-
cally should include an independent oversight board or committee. A truly 
independent oversight board is composed of people with the proper level of 
expertise in the field who don’t have any financial or other personal stakes in 
the clinic or the company operating the clinic.
Government regulation usually involves ensuring the safety and rights of 
patients, including reviewing evidence of the treatment’s safety and effective-
ness. Independent oversight boards also review data about the treatment and 
its outcomes and ensure that the clinic follows best practices in hiring quali-
fied staff, screening patients and informing them of potential risks (which, 
with experimental treatments, should include information about what sci-
entists don’t know yet, as well as what they do know), and administering the 
treatment
Understand Your Disease and Why 
the Treatment Might Work
Although some clinics offer the same stem cell treatment for all diseases, 
remember that not all diseases are alike and therefore won’t respond in the 
same way to the same treatment. To put it simply, if someone’s offering aspi-
rin to cure headaches, toothaches, diabetes, and lung cancer, the patients 
who have headaches and toothaches may think the therapy is swell and rec-
ommend it highly to everyone they meet. But the patients with diabetes and 
lung cancer aren’t likely to see any improvement even in their symptoms, 
much less their disease.
Learn about the biology of your disease before you let anyone practice a 
treatment on you, especially novel or unusual treatments. In certain forms of 
leukemia, for example, part of the bone marrow produces abnormal infection-
fighting blood cells, so replacing the cancerous bone marrow with healthy 

313
 Chapter 21: Ten (or So) Things to Do Before You Consider Stem Cell Treatment
marrow makes sense. But a bone marrow transplant doesn’t make sense if 
you suffer from, say, kidney stones, because the biology of kidney stones is 
far different than the biology of leukemia.
 
Check out Web sites for organizations devoted to your specific disease. 
Generally, the best sources of unbiased information are nonprofit groups, 
patient advocacy organizations, and professional medical society Web sites. 
The following organizations’ sites offer information on the disease, medical 
treatments, other steps you can do to improve your quality of life, and often 
even reports and discussions of the pros and cons of promising new treat-
ments and clinical trials, such as stem cell therapies:
 
✓ ALS Association (www.alsa.org)
 
✓ Alzheimer’s Foundation of America (www.alzfnd.org)
 
✓ American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org)
 
✓ American Diabetes Association (www.diabetes.org)
 
✓ American Heart Association (www.americanheart.org)
 
✓ Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (www.jdrf.org)
 
✓ National Parkinson Foundation (www.parkinson.org)
The National Institutes of Health Web site (www.nih.gov) also has informa-
tion on a broad range of diseases and their treatments. And the International 
Society for Stem Cell Research (www.isscr.org) has information on how 
stem cells have been used to treat certain diseases, as well as which treat-
ments are experimental, which show promise, which aren’t likely to work, 
and which don’t yet have sufficient information for an objective evaluation.
 
If you’re looking into stem cell treatment, first you need to know enough about 
the disease to understand whether claims of effective stem cell therapy even 
have a chance of being true. Second, get independent advice; see the section 
“Get a Second (and Third) Reputable, Expert Opinion,” later in this chapter.
Find Out How the Treatment 
Was Developed
Medical treatments are developed in all sorts of ways: guesswork, careful 
rigorous scientific and medical research, animal experiments, luck, tradition, 
and even inspired logic. But when you’re investigating whether to pursue an 
experimental treatment, the more scientific information and logical, legiti-
mate rationale there is behind it, the better.

314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The Web sites listed in the previous section are good starting points for find-
ing out how much researchers know about a given treatment. Researchers 
don’t always know a lot about how well experimental treatments work (see 
the following section) because often there isn’t enough data — that’s why 
these treatments are called experimental. However, any treatments to be 
tried in humans should at least have a significant history of experiments — 
and positive results — in animals.
 
The one thing you definitely don’t want is a stem cell treatment that someone 
cooked up in his kitchen one day and has never tested carefully on animals. 
If no such information is on the company’s Web site or in the scientific litera-
ture, watch out! And remember that even info on the company’s Web site may 
be more sizzle than steak; be wary of promotional material that glosses over 
(or completely ignores) factual details.
Know What You’re Getting with 
Experimental Treatments
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration is the gatekeeper for 
drugs, biologics (including cells and stem cells) and medical devices — and 
for the clinical trials that carefully test whether those therapies are safe and 
effective. Anyone who wants to conduct clinical trials for drugs, stem cells, 
or medical devices in the United States has to get FDA approval before pro-
ceeding. Chapter 11 has more on the various stages of clinical trials. (In the 
European Union, the FDA equivalent is the European Medicines Agency.)
Treatments are experimental when they’re administered before they’ve been 
approved for market. Even clinical trials are experimental — they’re experi-
ments on human subjects to find out how safe and effective the treatment is. 
Various codes of ethics require physicians and other treatment providers to 
provide patients with strongly worded consent forms that emphasize the fact 
that the treatment is experimental and that the treatment may have unknown 
risks.
 
Clinics in countries with weak regulatory standards don’t have to follow the 
same rules as clinics in countries with more stringent standards, such as 
those in the United States or European Union countries. In less regulated 
countries, you may not be told explicitly that the treatment is experimental, 
and the potential risks may be downplayed.
Although you don’t have to participate in a clinical trial to receive an experi-
mental treatment, clinical trials offer the best patient protections for these 
kinds of therapies. Some clinics offer treatments on a patient-by-patient basis 
but aren’t conducting research on the treatment; that is, they aren’t conform-
ing to best practices to objectively evaluate the outcomes of the treatment. 

315
 Chapter 21: Ten (or So) Things to Do Before You Consider Stem Cell Treatment
In unregulated environments — typically outside the United States and 
European Union, but they probably have some clinics that operate outside 
the rules, too — a clinic can claim almost anything without having actual data 
to back it up.
If you’re thinking of participating in a clinical trial, make sure that you under-
stand how the trial is structured and which phase researchers are trying to 
find volunteers for (see Chapter 11). Double-blind trials are the most reliable 
from a scientific standpoint, because neither the patient nor the physician or 
people administering the trial know who’s getting the treatment and who’s 
getting a placebo, so the likelihood of results attributable to the placebo 
effect are lower. (For more on the placebo effect, see the section “Beware of 
Patient Testimonials,” later in this chapter.)
However, people who are seeking nontraditional treatments for disease often 
don’t want to participate in double-blind or even single-blind trials because 
there’s no guarantee they’ll actually receive the treatment. If you want to be 
sure that you receive the treatment, look for an open-label trial, where both 
the patient and the researcher or physician administering the treatment 
know who’s getting what. However, keep in mind that some open-label trials 
are randomized, meaning participants are randomly chosen to receive the 
treatments.
 
In a double-blind trial, you may or may not actually receive the treatment. 
Even if you do receive the treatment, it may not work for you. A recent survey 
of studies showed that even common best-practices therapies, such as aspirin 
for a headache, don’t work the same for everyone. And, to successfully com-
plete clinical trials and bring a drug or other treatment to market, whoever 
developed it only has to show that it’s safe and works better than a placebo — 
not that it will help a majority of patients.
 
The National Institutes of Health maintains a Web site devoted to clinical trials 
(www.clinicaltrials.gov) around the world. Use the site’s search func-
tion to look for clinical trials for your medical condition; you can narrow the 
search by your location, too. Clicking any of the results will show you who’s 
conducting the trial, how long it’s scheduled to last, the kinds of patients 
they’re interested in recruiting, and a range of other information. Not all clini-
cal trials are listed on the site, but a July 2009 check of the catalog showed 
more than 75,000 listed trials in 169 countries.
Ask About Risks and Side Effects
Researchers know very little about how many proposed stem cell therapies 
will actually work in living, human bodies, so accurately assessing the risks 
and side effects can be quite a challenge. Consider the case of a 9-year-old 
boy suffering from a rare genetic neurological disorder, reported in the 
journal PLOS Medicine in February 2009. At a Moscow hospital, the boy was 

316
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
“treated” with three injections of fetal brain stem cells in a bid to revive or 
replace his own dying brain cells, and four years later he developed tumors 
at the base of his brain and in his spinal column. No one knows exactly why 
the tumors, which appeared to be formed from the injected cells, developed 
or whether such treatments would lead to tumors in other neurological dis-
eases. But this case illustrates why it’s so important to be clear about risks 
and side effects before you begin treatment.
Don’t assume that a clinic or a company running a clinical trial outside of a 
well-regulated environment (such as the United States or parts of Europe) 
will tell you about risks and side effects. And, even in the United States and 
Europe, risks and side effects often aren’t known; clinical trials are designed 
to investigate those factors. Usually, clinical trials are only started after 
experiments have been done in animals to test for obvious side effects and 
efficacy. However, sometimes animals and humans don’t exhibit the same 
side effects — or even the same effectiveness — from the same treatment.
Even reputable clinics and companies that provide risk and side effect infor-
mation often give you only a printed list, and the information may be in medi-
cal terms rather than plain English. Be sure to consult your physician and 
others who are knowledgeable about your disease and potential treatments. 
Take the time to read any materials you’re given and make sure that you get 
acceptable answers to your questions. If you feel that the clinic or research 
team is being evasive or vague, think long and hard before you sign up for 
anything.
 
Be especially skeptical if someone tells you a treatment has no risks or side 
effects. Every medical therapy and procedure carries some risk. In many 
cases, the risk is minor — the equivalent of having an upset stomach if you 
take aspirin or flushing (a kind of hot flash) if you take niacin. Any claim from 
a clinic that an experimental, or even well-established, treatment has no risks 
should be a tip-off that you’re not getting the full story.
In many experimental stem cell therapies, though, nobody knows for sure 
what the risks and side effects may be, because so few have been tried in 
humans. So the clinic or research team should tell you what’s happened 
in animal testing and the results of any clinical trials. And, as always, they 
should explain this information to you in language you understand. If they 
won’t explain it in plain terms, be on your guard; they may be pedaling bogus 
treatments.
 
Sometimes patients are drawn to experimental treatments because they feel 
that they have nothing to lose; they figure that, even if the treatment doesn’t 
help, it won’t hurt. Unfortunately, though, experimental treatments can be 
very harmful, sometimes even fatal. Short of that extreme, the treatment could 
leave you in incurable pain or otherwise make managing your disease and its 
symptoms more complicated. Or such treatments can eat up funds that would 

317
 Chapter 21: Ten (or So) Things to Do Before You Consider Stem Cell Treatment
be better used to make yourself and your family more comfortable. Even if 
things are bad, think carefully about whether a proposed treatment could 
make your situation worse.
Look for Valid Confirmation
Put the marketing brochures aside and do your own investigative work. Start 
by asking your doctor about the treatment and the company or clinic offer-
ing it. Then ask for a referral to a specialist who can explain all your treat-
ment options — including stem cell therapy — to you. (See the section “Get a 
Second [and Third] Reputable, Expert Opinion,” later in this chapter.)
Then hit the Internet and look for journal articles and news reports that men-
tion both the treatment and the company. Not everything published in the 
media — including scientific and medical journals — is accurate, of course. 
But perusing this information may answer some questions for you and raise 
others that you can ask your doctor.
 
Several magazines and Web sites specialize in making scientific information 
accessible and understandable to the lay reader. Check out Scientific American 
(www.scientificamerican.com), Science Daily (www.sciencedaily.
com), and Nature (www.nature.com).
Beware of Patient Testimonials
People who say their condition or overall sense of well-being improved after 
they underwent certain therapies — including stem cell therapies — aren’t 
necessarily lying. In fact, chances are good that they did feel better after the 
therapy. But that doesn’t mean the therapy worked.
Thanks to a phenomenon known as the placebo effect, people often feel better 
simply because they think they’ve been treated. Your brain is conditioned 
to expect good things or bad things from various experiences and often 
responds by making you feel better (or worse) based on what you expect to 
happen. Say someone in a white coat with a stethoscope around her neck 
gives you a capsule and says your headache should go away in five minutes. 
If you’re like many people, your symptoms will fade within five minutes, and 
you’ll attribute your improved condition to the capsule you took — even if 
the capsule contained nothing but powdered sugar.

318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The placebo effect works the opposite way, too. If the woman in the white coat 
hands you the capsule and says, “You can take this pill, but it’s not usually 
very effective,” odds are you’ll feel no improvement in your headache — even 
if the capsule contains actual medicine, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, that’s 
generally effective against headaches.
Reliable scientific evidence shows that outcome measures from open-label, 
single-blind, and double-blind clinical trials can be very different because of 
the placebo effect, coupled with patients’ natural desire to feel better and 
doctors’ natural desire to see improvement in their patients. The placebo 
effect seems to be particularly powerful when parents assess their child’s 
progress after a treatment; it’s not uncommon for parents to report signifi-
cant improvement, even though empirical measures of the treatment’s effect 
indicate little or no change.
 
Patients who say their treatments worked may be perfectly sincere in their 
beliefs. But there are too many unknowns to take such testimonials at face 
value. Look for clinical evidence that the treatment is effective and regard 
patient testimonials as, at best, anecdotal evidence. The patient giving the 
testimonial may be one patient out of 1,000 and may be the only one who got 
better after the treatment. Ask yourself this question: Who else received the 
treatment who you’re not hearing from?
Remember, too, that disease symptoms fluctuate, and sometimes people 
go into spontaneous remission. Just because someone feels better after 
receiving a given therapy doesn’t prove that the therapy worked. If you flip 
a coin when you have a headache and, five minutes later, your headache 
disappears, it doesn’t mean that flipping the coin had any effect on your 
symptoms. To paraphrase Sigmund Freud, sometimes a coincidence is just a 
coincidence.
Watch Out for Hidden Costs
Health insurance rarely covers experimental treatments, and, except for 
established therapies like bone marrow transplants, nearly all stem cell treat-
ments fall under the experimental category. Stem cell clinics typically charge 
tens of thousands of dollars for their treatments — which you’ll have to come 
up with up front.
 
Your health insurance may not cover complications from experimental treat-
ments, either. In fact, some insurers may even cancel your coverage or refuse 
to cover conventional treatment after you undergo experimental therapy. Be 
sure you understand your insurer’s policies and limitations and weigh those 
factors in your decision to seek stem cell therapy.
You may encounter other unexpected costs, too. For example, in addition to 
your treatment expenses, the clinic may require you to pay a room-and-board 

319
 Chapter 21: Ten (or So) Things to Do Before You Consider Stem Cell Treatment
fee for in-patient days, or vague “processing” or “administrative” fees on top 
of the cost of the treatment.
And, of course, you’ll have to pay for transportation, lodging, and meals for 
yourself and anyone who accompanies you.
 
Participants normally aren’t charged to join a clinical trial. In many clinical 
trials, your treatments, follow-up appointments, and any additional health 
care expenses related to the trial are covered. Sometimes participants are 
even reimbursed for travel expenses. In addition to the financial benefits, 
strong regulatory systems in the countries where the clinical trials are being 
conducted improve the odds that the potential benefits of the treatment have 
been properly weighed against the potential risks.
Get a Second (and Third) 
Reputable, Expert Opinion
If you’re being treated for a progressive illness such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, 
Parkinson’s, Lou Gehrig’s, or dozens of other diseases, chances are your 
doctor is at least aware of stem cell research that may show promise for your 
situation. Even if she isn’t an expert in it, she has access to medical and sci-
entific journals that report on stem cell research.
We recommend consulting at least two physicians who are experts in your 
disease and familiar with stem cell advances as they relate to your disease. 
These professionals are the best-equipped to give you sound, realistic advice 
on a range of treatment options and help you weigh the risks of experimental 
therapies against the potential benefits.
 
Organizations devoted to fighting specific diseases, such as those listed 
earlier in this chapter in the section “Understand Your Disease and Why the 
Treatment Might Work,” sometimes have staff who can help you find special-
ists and other information so that you can sort out your treatment options.
Make Sure That Your Consent 
Really Is Informed
Reading and signing a consent form is one thing. Really understanding 
the treatment, the risks, your rights, and your responsibilities is something 
else. The International Society for Stem Cell Research (www.isscr.org) 
has a Patient Handbook on Stem Cell Therapies that advises asking a lot 

320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
of questions to make sure that you know what you may be signing up for, 
regardless of whether the treatment is approved (such as bone marrow 
transplants), experimental, or in clinical trials.
Questions the ISSCR recommends asking include
 
✓ Is the treatment routine for your specific disease or condition?
  
✓ Is the treatment part of a formal clinical trial?
  
✓ If the treatment is experimental, is there any independent oversight, 
such as an institutional review board or ethics advisory board?
  
✓ Are the facilities where the treatment will be done and where the cells 
are processed subject to independent oversight, accreditation, or regu-
latory authority?
  
✓ How is the treatment done?
 
• Where do the stem cells come from?
 
• If the treatment doesn’t use your own stem cells, how will the 
treatment provider ensure that your immune system doesn’t reject 
the cells?
 
• How are the cells isolated, purified, and grown?
 
• Are the cells differentiated into specific cell types before therapy?
 
• How does the treatment deliver the cells to the right part of your 
body?
 
Whether you’re seeking treatment as a patient or looking into volunteering for 
a formal clinical trial, you have the right and the responsibility to fully under-
stand the process. We strongly recommend that you stay away from any clinic 
or treatment center that refuses to answer your questions, gives vague or eva-
sive answers, or implies that you don’t need to know any of the details of your 
potential treatment.
Also be sure that you get advice from an unbiased source before you agree to 
participate in a clinical trial or receive an experimental treatment. Check with 
your own doctor, as well as nonprofit organizations for your disease. (See the 
section “Understand Your Disease and Why the Treatment Might Work,” ear-
lier in this chapter.)
Know How to Spot Scams and Charlatans
In 2006, the BBC reported on a stem cell clinic in South Africa that used 
stem cells designed for research to “treat” human patients. We put the word 
“treat” in quotes because, according to news reports, the clinic supposedly 

321
 Chapter 21: Ten (or So) Things to Do Before You Consider Stem Cell Treatment
injected the stem cells intravenously in patients with medical conditions 
ranging from deafness to lung cancer to multiple sclerosis to HIV/AIDS.
Here’s the problem: There may be diseases in which injecting stem cells into 
the bloodstream makes sense, but it’s highly unlikely that this single delivery 
method would work on all these different types of health issues. For example, 
if you inject lung cells into the bloodstream, how do you know those cells 
won’t end up in the liver or gall bladder?
The BBC also reported that the South African clinic was using stem cells that 
were clearly labeled for research only, and the company the cells came from 
hadn’t even certified them to be “clean” enough for use in animals, much less 
humans.
Consider this a cautionary tale. If you read the preceding section and won-
dered why it’s important to know where the cells come from and how they’re 
isolated, purified, and grown — well, do you really want someone injecting 
you with cells that may be contaminated with bacteria or viruses?
The sad fact is that a lot of self-described “stem cell clinics” prey upon the 
hopes and fears of desperately ill people and their families. They tend to set 
up shop in countries that have little or no regulatory oversight and where 
pursuing either civil or criminal legal action is difficult. They aggressively 
market their product to vulnerable individuals. And, all too often, they cut 
corners on patient safety.
The best way to protect yourself is to cultivate a healthy skepticism toward 
any claims you see in marketing or advertising from these outfits and rigor-
ously investigate them before you fork over any cash or allow them to give 
you any treatment. Ask as many questions as you can think of and then check 
out the answers with a trusted medical advisor. Even a simple Google search 
online can alert you to potential scams or other problems.
 
Stem cell research has shown a great deal of promise for developing new and 
better treatments for a broad range of human ailments. But only a very few — 
mainly blood-related stem cell therapies — are proven to be safe and effective. 
Some researchers and physicians have reported positive results from experi-
mental stem cell therapies, but these therapies are still experimental. Anyone 
who promises stem cell miracle cures as of today should be regarded with 
skepticism. They may be just foolishly optimistic, but they may be frauds, too.

e’ve provided the best and latest information about stem cells that 
was available when we wrote this book. But the field is growing 
rapidly, and new discoveries and breakthroughs are likely to expand the 
possibilities for stem cells at an astonishing rate. Fortunately, thanks to the 
Internet, you can keep up on advances in stem cell research — and the issues 
surrounding the research — virtually as they happen.
In this chapter, we share ten or so Web sites that have reliable information 
about stem cells, advances in research, government policies, and ethical 
standards. We also steer you toward news sites so that you can stay current 
on what scientists around the world are doing.

ister to access them.
National Academies/National 
Academy of Sciences
Abraham Lincoln signed the law that created the National Academy of 
Sciences in 1863, in the middle of the Civil War. Today, the National Academies 
comprise the National Academy of Sciences, the National Research Council 
(added in 1916), the National Academy of Engineering (added in 1964), and 
the Institute of Medicine (added in 1970). Its mission is to address issues of 
national concern and advise the federal government (and the public), and its 
nonprofit status ensures that their advice is independent of political and

International Society 
for Stem Cell Research
The International Society for Stem Cell Research (www.isscr.org) was 
formed in 2002 to promote the exchange of information among stem cell 
scientists worldwide. It’s an independent not-for-profit group, and part of its 
mission is to help educate the general public about stem cell research, and 
especially about seeking stem cell treatment. You also can access the ISSCR’s 
Patient Handbook on Stem Cell Therapies (see Chapter 21).
The ISSCR site provides access to a collection of essays on various aspects 
of stem cell research and what they mean for the future of the field and for 
medical care, as well as informative videos about stem cells, stem cell treat-
ments, and related topics. The Stem Cell Briefings sections provides news 
about advances in research.
Harvard Stem Cell Institute
You can access a plethora of articles and information under the Resources 
tab on The Harvard Stem Cell Institute Web site (www.hsci.harvard.edu). 
While much of the material is aimed at researchers, there’s quite a bit for 
the layperson to sink her teeth into as well. Check out the Frequently Asked 
Questions (FAQ) and glossary or click Stem Cell Bookshelf to investigate 
other resources.
 
If you really want to delve into stem cell science, check out Harvard’s 
“Stembook” (www.stembook.org), a collection of peer-reviewed chapters 
on various aspects of stem cell biology. You can even sign up for e-mail alerts 
when a new chapter is posted. Be warned, though: These are scientific papers, 
so if you’re looking for plain-English explanations, we recommend sticking 
to sites like the National Institutes of Health and the International Society for 
Stem Cell Research. (See their sections earlier in this chapter.)
University of California–San Diego 
Stem Cell Initiative
Larry’s home base, the University of California–San Diego Stem Cell Initiative 
(http://stemcells.ucsd.edu), offers links to news and information 
about stem cells, as well as articles and papers on bioethics and links to bio-
ethics sites.

326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Check out the Multimedia tab on the right side of the home page for video clips 
on stem cells, advances in the field, and ethical considerations. (Larry stars in 
many of the video clips, including a series of videotaped lectures on what stem 
cells are and the ethical and policy questions surrounding the science.)
NIH Clinical Trials Registry
Use the National Institutes of Health clinical trials registry (www.clinical
trials.gov) to get information on treatments and therapies that are being 
tested for specific diseases or health conditions. Although not every trial is 
registered, this site provides the most comprehensive listing; on any given 
day, you can find out about tens of thousands of publicly and privately 
funded trials in virtually any corner of the globe.
The site gives you a summary of each trial, including its status (whether 
it’s still recruiting patients), location, and criteria for participants. The 
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page provides a full explanation of what 
clinical trials are and how they work, as well as information on signing up for 
trials.
 
Type stem cells into the search box to find all the registered clinical trials 
involving stem cells. Then use the information from this site to search the 
Internet for more thorough descriptions of the trial(s).
National Bone Marrow Program/C.W. 
Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program
In 2005, Congress and President George W. Bush reauthorized federal fund-
ing for the National Bone Marrow Program (www.marrow.org) and added a 
national registry for umbilical cord blood donations (http://blood
cell.transplant.hrsa.gov). These registries (named for the Florida 
Congressman who first proposed a national bone marrow donor registry) let 
physicians find potential bone marrow and cord blood donors for patients 
who need transplants (see Chapter 13).
The National Bone Marrow Program administers the Be The Match registry 
and the Be The Match Foundation, which helps patients and their families 
with some of the costs of transplantation and promotes research and donor 
signups. The Web site offers information on becoming a donor or donating 
cord blood, stories from transplant patients, and what to expect before and 
after a transplant.

The Nobel Foundation
Scientists who win the Nobel Prize typically give lectures either a few days 
before they receive their medals or at the medal presentation ceremony, 
and their lectures often are quite accessible for the layperson. The Nobel 
Foundation Web site (http://nobelprize.org) publishes the lectures 
after they’ve been delivered. The site also offers information on Alfred Nobel 
and the history of the prizes.
You can search for stem cell information on the Nobel Foundation site and 
learn about the people who have made significant contributions to the 
advancement of stem cell science. (You may want to bookmark this site 
because we have no doubt that stem cell scientists will earn more Nobel 
Prizes in the future.)
One of the coolest features is the Educational Games page, where you can 
control cell division to make sure that nothing goes wrong as a cell prepares 
to split in two, or join the fighting forces of the immune system to track down 
and destroy harmful invaders.
American Society of 
Reproductive Medicine
Although the American Society of Reproductive Medicine is a professional 
association, its Web site (www.asrm.org) provides a good deal of information 
for patients seeking fertility treatments. Fact sheet topics run the gamut from 
factors that affect fertility, such as weight, smoking, cancer, and spinal cord 
injury, to the risks of in vitro fertilization and using donated egg or sperm cells 
to generate embryos. (See Chapter 4 for more on in vitro fertilization.)
The site lists Frequently Asked Questions about infertility, cloning, and stem 
cell research. And you can find fertility doctors and even clinical trials on the 
site.
National Bioethics Panels
Presidents William J. Clinton and George W. Bush each appointed panels 
charged with investigating, reporting, and making recommendations on 
ethical practices for research in a number of areas of biology and medicine, 

328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
including stem cells. Both the Clinton Administration’s National Bioethics 
Advisory Commission and the Bush Administration’s President’s Council on 
Bioethics generated numerous useful reports on a variety of issues, including 
the issues surrounding stem cell research.
 
Naturally, these two presidents appointed commission members who looked 
at the issues from different philosophical and political leanings; not sur-
prisingly, the two panels produced papers and reports that reflected their 
particular points of view. These differences make the material these panels 
generated particularly useful in understanding different viewpoints on stem 
cell research.
The President’s Council on Bioethics Web site (www.bioethics.gov) has 
an archive of reports from both the Clinton Administration’s panel (which 
you can access directly at http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/nbac) 
and several other similar panels, most of them available for download. Select 
Former Bioethics Commissions on the home page and scroll through the list 
of reports and recommendations.
Stem Cell News Sites
If you want to keep up on the latest reports about stem cells but don’t want 
to decode the language in scientific journals, you can add one or more stem 
cell news sites to your favorites or bookmarks. These sites collect news 
reports from various wire services and other news sources, so you don’t 
have to go hunting all over the Internet for them.
Stem cell news sites include
 
✓ Science Daily (www.sciencedaily.com/news/health_medicine/
stemcells)
 
✓ Stem Cell Research News (www.stemcellresearchnews.com)
 
✓ Medical News Today (www.medicalnewstoday.com/sections/
stem_cell)
 
These Web sites are great tools to stay informed about new developments in 
stem cell science, but remember that what’s reported in the news media isn’t 
always accurate. We strongly encourage you to not take accuracy for granted. 
Remember the old journalism credo: If your mother says she loves you, check 
it out.

Glossary
adult stem cell: an undifferentiated cell, often found in a specific tissue (such 
as skin, liver, or bone marrow) that’s capable of renewing itself long term and 
giving rise to different types of cells in that particular tissue (multipotent). 
Also called tissue stem cell or somatic stem cell. (Sometimes fetal stem cells 
are mistakenly referred to as adult stem cells.)
altered nuclear transfer (ANT): a technique in which a gene called CDX2 is 
suppressed, so the embryo can’t develop the cells it needs to implant in a 
uterus. However, the embryo can develop the cells that give rise to embry-
onic stem cells.
Alzheimer’s disease: a disease of synapse loss in the brain, characterized by 
plaques and tangles in brain tissue and disturbances in memory and thinking.
amniotic stem cell: stem cells reportedly found in amniotic fluid (the fluid 
in which the fetus is suspended in the womb). These cells originally were 
reported to be pluripotent, but most scientists believe these stem cells are 
really multipotent mesenchymal stem cells.
amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS): a neurodegenerative disease in which 
motor neurons die, ultimately resulting in paralysis and death. Also known as 
Lou Gehrig’s disease.
anemia: a deficiency of red blood cells. Some forms of anemia are hereditary, 
and some are sporadic.
animal model: a mouse, rat, fruit fly, or other animal that carries genetic 
changes or is otherwise treated to develop symptoms that are similar or 
identical to some or all symptoms of a human disease. Scientists routinely 
create animal models of human disease to study disease progression and test 
potential treatments.
apoptosis: a form of programmed cell death that induces cells to “commit 
suicide” if they grow too large or have other abnormalities.
astrocyte: one of several types of glial cells that support neurons and other 
cells in the nervous system.
asymmetric division: the process in which a cell divides into two different 
daughter cells. The descendants of each of the daughter cells take on differ-
ent jobs; one daughter cell may give rise to white blood cells, for example, 
while the other daughter cell remains a blood-forming stem cell.

330
Stem Cells For Dummies 
axon: the long tendril in neurons, such as motor neurons, that stretches 
from the cell body to the target tissue, such as the diaphragm or leg muscles. 
The axon serves as both a wire to transmit electrical signals and as a pipe to 
deliver materials from the cell body to the synapse.
basic research: the stage at which scientists focus on understanding how 
something works, such as the progression of a specific disease or develop-
ment of specific tissues, as well as basic cellular mechanisms and biochemi-
cal processes.
blastocyst: an embryo of about 150 to 200 cells that hasn’t implanted in a 
woman’s uterus.
CDX2: a gene required for proper construction of the trophectoderm.
cell body: the main part of a neuron that contains the nucleus and the cellu-
lar components that produce energy, nutrients, and other critical elements.
cell culture: growth of cells in Petri dishes or other containers in the lab for 
study and experiments.
cell division: the process by which a cell makes more cells. Also see asym-
metric division and symmetric division.
cell membrane: the thin, flexible outer barrier of a cell that maintains the 
unique environment inside the cell by controlling what enters and exits it.
cell therapy: a medical treatment that uses stem cells or other types of cells 
that have been programmed to repair or replace damaged or dead cells. Also 
called cell-based therapy or stem cell therapy.
chimera: an organism containing at least two types of cells that are geneti-
cally different from each other; often used to describe animals or people with 
two types of cells, each of which comes from a different set of parents. In chi-
meric black-and-white mice, the DNA of the black patches of fur is different 
than the DNA of the white patches of fur.
chromosome: the organizational unit in the genome consisting of DNA and 
proteins and that contains many genes.
clinical trials: controlled tests of drugs, medical devices, cell therapy, or sur-
gical procedures in humans, most reliable when designed to gather measur-
able evidence and minimize the placebo effect.
clone: an identical copy; in biology, a genetically identical copy of DNA, cells, 
or animals. Researchers routinely clone human insulin for diabetes treat-
ments, DNA for research, and animals for experiments, as well as cells for 
cancer testing and stem cell research.

embryonic stem cell line by extracting and culturing the inner cell mass of the 
blastocyst under defined conditions in the lab.
differentiation: the process by which a cell acquires the specialized charac-
teristics it needs to become a tissue cell, such as a skin, pancreas, or heart 
cell.
directed differentiation: manipulating stem cells in the lab to generate the 
specific types of tissue cells desired.
disease model: see animal model.
DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic material that provides the blue-
prints for individual cells, tissues, and organisms. Most DNA is found in the 
nucleus of a cell.
double-blind trial: a clinical trial in which neither the patient nor the person 
doing the evaluation knows whether the patient is receiving the treatment or 
a placebo.
ectoderm: one of three germ layers of tissue cells that grow from the inner 
cell mass of a blastocyst; the ectoderm, the outermost layer, gives rise to 
skin, the nervous system, and sensory organs like the eyes and ears. Also see 
endoderm and mesoderm.

332
Stem Cells For Dummies 
embryo: definition varies according to which dictionary you consult. For 
our purposes in this book, an embryo is a stage of animal or human develop-
ment at any point from the time of conception to implantation in a female’s 
uterus; some define it as the first eight weeks of development. We use embryo 
to describe the stages before implantation and fetus to describe stages after 
implantation.
embryoid bodies: rounded clumps of cells that are generated when embry-
onic stem cells are cultured in suspension instead of in a dish. Embryoid 
bodies have cell types from all three germ layers.
embryonic stem cells: pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass 
of a human blastocyst. They can reproduce themselves indefinitely without 
differentiating.
embryonic stem cell line: embryonic stem cells derived from a single blas-
tocyst and have been cultured in the lab to reproduce themselves without 
differentiating.
endoderm: one of three germ layers of tissue cells that grow from the inner 
cell mass of a blastocyst; the endoderm, the innermost layer, gives rise to the 
respiratory and digestive systems. Also see ectoderm and mesoderm.
enucleated: a cell whose nucleus has been removed.
feeder layer: a layer of cells used to help stem cells grow in culture. Typical 
feeder layers include mouse skin cells and human embryonic cells that have 
been treated so that they won’t grow.
fertilization: fusion of an egg cell and a sperm cell. Also see zygote.
fetus: for the purposes of this book, the stage of animal or human develop-
ment after an embryo has implanted in a female’s uterus, up until birth. 
Generally, a fetus is a developing organism at any point between eight weeks 
after conception and birth.
fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS): a method used to separate cells 
based on their surface markers, usually with an instrument called a fluorescent-
activated cell sorter.

hereditary disease: a disease that’s passed on from one generation to the 
next because of genetic changes.
human embryonic stem cells: see embryonic stem cells.
hybrid: an organism with genetic material in each cell from two genetically 
different parents. Most humans can be considered hybrids because their 
mothers and fathers aren’t genetically identical to each other.
implantation: the process by which a blastocyst or embryo fuses with the 
uterine wall to start a pregnancy.
induced pluripotent stem cells: differentiated cells that are reprogrammed 
to an undifferentiated state that mimics many of the important properties of 
embryonic stem cells.
inner cell mass: the collection of cells inside a blastocyst, which researchers 
extract to derive embryonic stem cells.
in vitro: Latin for “in glass;” in a culture dish in a lab.
in vitro fertilization: a technique for fusing egg cells and sperm cells in a 
lab to generate a zygote, which is then cultured to the blastocyst stage. The 
zygote created by IVF is then cultured to the blastocyst stage and can be 
inserted into a woman’s uterus to achieve implantation and initiate a preg-
nancy.
in vivo: Latin for “in life;” in the body.

334
Stem Cells For Dummies 
inner cell mass: a collection of cells inside a blastocyst. Under normal condi-
tions, if the blastocyst implants in the female’s uterus, the inner cell mass 
gives rise to all the tissues and organs of the offspring’s body. When the inner 
cell mass is removed and adapted to growth and culture in a lab, the cells 
can grow indefinitely without differentiating, thus creating embryonic stem 
cell lines.
lysosome: an organelle in the cell responsible for breaking down materials.
lysosomal storage disease: a disease in which lysosomes are defective and 
lack the ability to break down materials properly, leading to potentially toxic 
buildups of those materials.
medical innovation: use of unconventional therapies in an effort to help a 
specific patient. Medical innovation may lead to further research to deter-
mine whether such therapies are safe and effective for large groups of 
people, but it’s susceptible to abuse without proper oversight.
mesenchymal stem cells: stem cells from fat tissue, bone marrow, cord 
blood, and other sources whose normal job is to make cartilage, tendons, 
and other connective tissues.
mesoderm: the middle germ layer in a blastocyst’s inner cell mass, which 
gives rise to bone, muscle, and connective tissue, among other things. Also 
see ectoderm and endoderm.
mitochondria: the energy-producing factories in a cell’s cytoplasm that con-
tain small amounts of DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the female 
egg cell.
morphology: the appearance and structure of a cell or tissue.
motor neuron: nerve cells that control muscle movement; the cells that die 
in ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease).
multipotent: the ability of a tissue-specific stem cell to give rise to all cell 
types in that particular tissue. For example, hematopoietic stem cells are 
multipotent because they can give rise to red blood cells, white blood cells, 
and platelets.
mutation: a change or variation in a gene; often used to refer to a difference 
in an individual that isn’t usually present in the general population.
myelin: a fatty covering or sheath that insulates the axons of neurons to 
facilitate the sending and receiving of electrical impulses.

335
 Glossary
Niemann-Pick Type C disease: a lysosomal storage disease in which children 
lose motor function and become progressively demented.
niche: the environment of a stem cell that controls some of the stem cell’s 
activities.
neuron: the cell type in the brain and spinal cord that send and receive mes-
sages and control thought and movement.
neuronal stem cell: a stem cell found in the brain, or generated in the lab 
from embryonic stem cells, that gives rise to neurons and glia and can 
self-renew.
neurotransmitter: a chemical that transmits nerve impulses from one neuron 
to another across a synapse. Dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine are neu-
rotransmitters.
nuclei: the plural of nucleus.
nucleus: the inner compartment of a cell that contains DNA and other 
nuclear proteins.
oligodendrocyte: a glial cell that supports nerve cells by generating myelin.
oocyte: egg cell.
Parkinson’s disease: a disease where neurons of the substantia nigra and 
other regions of the brain become defective, leading to uncontrolled move-
ment and other symptoms.
parthenogenesis: a method that uses chemicals, electricity, or both to 
induce a nonfertilized egg cell to begin development as if it were fertilized, 
even though no sperm cell is present. Scientists believe it’s impossible for a 
parthenogenetic egg cell to initiate a viable pregnancy in mammals.
placebo: a harmless or inert substance, such as a sugar pill.
placebo effect: the tendency to believe a treatment is working based on 
desire or expectations rather than empirical evidence. Named after the 
effect that some patients experience after receiving a placebo instead of a 
treatment.
placenta: the structure that supports the fetus via exchange of blood flow 
and nutrients with the mother.
plasticity: see transdifferentiation.

336
Stem Cells For Dummies 
platelets: blood cells responsible for clotting.
pluripotent: the ability to give rise to all cell types in the adult body. 
Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent; they can generate all types of adult 
cells, but not the cells that form the placenta or umbilical cord. Pluri comes 
from the same root word as plural, meaning “many” but not “all.” Sometimes 
incorrectly used to refer to a multipotent stem cell, such as a hematopoietic 
stem cell.
pre-implantation: before implanting in a female’s uterus. In nature, human 
blastocysts typically attempt to implant about a week after conception. 
Embryonic stem cells are derived from blastocysts that are created in a lab 
and never implant in a uterus.
primitive streak: a thickening line that shows up in human embryos at about 
the 14th day of development; it eventually gives rise to the nervous system 
and other structures. When the primitive streak appears, an embryo can no 
longer divide to form twins.
progenitor cell: a cell that’s more specialized than an undifferentiated stem 
cell and that gives rise to fully differentiated cells. Progenitor cells usually 
have limited potential for cell division and replication, unlike stem cells, 
whose self-renewal capabilities are virtually unlimited.
recombinant DNA: a combination of gene fragments joined together and 
amplified (cloned) from different species.
regenerative medicine: see cell therapy. Also may apply to certain drugs or 
other therapies that stimulate tissue regeneration.
reproductive cloning: the process of creating an offspring that’s geneti-
cally identical to the donor of the genetic material. Dolly the sheep, the first 
mammal cloned from an adult cell, was a product of reproductive cloning. 
Also see somatic cell nuclear transfer.
Reprogramming: typically used to refer to the procedure for inducing adult 
or tissue stem cells to become pluripotent with a combination of genes or 
other factors.
RNA: ribonucleic acid, which reads and interprets DNA and relays genetic 
instructions to the cell. Most RNA work is done in the cell’s cytoplasm.
Schwann cell: a cell that produces myelin around sensory and motor axons.
sensory neuron: a neuron whose special role is in sensing heat, pain, and 
other sensory stimuli.

337
 Glossary
somatic cell: any cell in the adult body except egg or sperm cells.
somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT): a technique that introduces the 
nucleus of a somatic cell into an enucleated egg cell to create an embryo. 
Dolly the sheep was created using SCNT. SCNT can be used for reproductive 
(implantation in a uterus follows SCNT) or therapeutic (no implantation or 
ANT) purposes.
somatic stem cells: see adult stem cell.
sporadic disease: disease caused by environmental factors, or by a combina-
tion of environmental factors and genetic variation, rather than by a single 
genetic defect; see hereditary disease.
stem cell: any cell that is not differentiated, can reproduce itself indefinitely, 
and can give rise to differentiated cells. Stem cells may be totipotent, pluripo-
tent, or multipotent.
symmetric division: the process in which one cell divides into two identical 
daughter cells that have the same genetic makeup and potential. Also see 
asymmetric division.
synapse: the point where two neurons come very close to each other and 
form a special structure that’s required for neurons to connect to exchange 
signals and information.
synthesis: the process of creating complex compounds from simple ingre-
dients. For example, cells take up sugars and other nutrients to make other 
components (for example, protein) so that they can grow and divide.
teratoma: a type of multilayered, benign tumor with cells from all three 
germ layers. In the lab, a teratoma results from injecting undifferentiated 
human embryonic stem cells into mice with suppressed immune systems. 
Development of a teratoma confirms that the human cells are indeed pluripo-
tent stem cells.
terminally differentiated cell: a cell that, under normal circumstances, 
acquires a structure and function that it maintains until it dies.
therapeutic cloning: nuclear transfer to create pluripotent stem cells that are 
genetically identical to the somatic cell donor. In principle, the genetically 
identical cells can then be used to study or treat the donor’s medical condi-
tion without danger of rejection by the donor’s immune system.
tissue stem cell: see adult stem cell.

338
Stem Cells For Dummies 
totipotent: the ability to give rise to all cell types in an organism, including 
(in humans and other mammals) the cells that generate the placenta and 
umbilical cord. In humans, only the zygote and the first few cells created by a 
zygote’s development are totipotent. Also see multipotent and pluripotent.
transdifferentiation: the process of inducing adult stem cells from one tissue 
type to generate cell types for other tissues (that is, hematopoietic to liver); 
it’s unclear whether transdifferentiation happens under normal circum-
stances. Also called plasticity.
translational research: the stage at which scientists look for ways to apply 
knowledge they’ve gained from basic research to solving real-world prob-
lems. Translational research can be the stage in which drugs and other thera-
pies are tested on animal models and human cells.
trophectoderm: the cell type in the blastocyst that leads to formation of the 
placenta and umbilical cord in the womb.
tumor suppressor genes: genes that can limit cell division and other cell 
functions that, when unregulated, can lead to tumors and cancers.
umbilical cord stem cells: stem cells found in umbilical cord blood — actu-
ally a mixture of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells, and perhaps 
unidentified stem cells of unknown abilities. Also called cord blood stem cells.
undifferentiated: cells that haven’t yet adopted specific structures, func-
tions, or other characteristics of specialized tissue cells.
uterus: organ in which the fetus grows during pregnancy; womb.
zygote: the single cell that results when an egg cell and sperm cell fuse; 
zygotes are totipotent.

A balanced, plain-English guide 
to this politically charged topic
This friendly, practical guide cuts away the hype and clearly 
presents the facts on stem cells.  It explains what stem cells 
are and what they do, the legalities of harvesting them and 
using them in research, the latest research findings from 
the United States and abroad, and the prospects for medi-
cal stem cell therapies in the short and long term.
•  Brushing up on biology — understand the basics of cells and tis-
sues and take a guided tour of the history of stem cell research
•  Delving into stem cell science — get easy-to-follow explanations 
of embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells, and sources of stem 
cells 
•  Where we are now — dig into the current practices in stem cell 
treatments, trials, and transplants
•  The possibilities are endless — discover how stem cells are 
projected to make medical advances in the understanding and 
improved treatment of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and more 
•  Understanding the debate — explore the ethical, religious, 
philosophical, and moral questions related to stem cell research 
and get armed with the knowledge needed to take an informed 
stance
