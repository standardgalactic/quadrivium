Preface 
This grammar is intended for those studying Greek in schools and 
universities as well as the ever-increasing number who learn it in adult 
education. 
It is a grammar of Attic Greek (the dialect centred on Athens) from about 
500 to 300 BC, but there is an appendix giving key information about the 
Homeric and Ionic dialects and New Testament Greek. As in the 
companion Latin grammar, I have aimed to cut down on the amount of 
accidence with which traditional grammars of classical languages have 
confronted their readers. I have given a large number of principal parts but 
divided them into two lists, the first for learning, the second for reference. 
Again as in the Latin grammar, to the analyses of the constructions I have 
added sentences from both Greek into English and English into Greek 
through which students can practise what they are learning. Vocabularies 
which cover these sentences are included. Greek names have generally 
been Latinized in my English, e.g. Crito for Kriton, Cyrus for KGros, and 
Thucydides for ThoukQdides. 
I am very conscious that the demands of pedagogical clarity have at 
times led me to take liberties with philological truth. I am also aware that 
my decision not to adjust the original words in any of the numerous 
quotations has made the Greek in this grammar less smoothly regular than 
that in any of its predecessors. The justification for this is that I wanted to 
centre the grammar around true unvarnished Attic. 
Acknowledgements 
Any compiler of a grammar will inevitably owe a great deal to his 
predecessors. I am delighted to acknowledge my very considerable debt to 
two important American Greek grammars, those by William W. Goodwin 
(Macmillan, 1894; Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1992) and Herbert Weir Smyth 
(Harvard University, 1920; revised by Gordon M. Messing, 1956). These are 
too detailed for the tyro Greekist but remain classics in their field. The 
latter has proved especially valuable to me, and it will provide the answers 
to most questions left unanswered in this book. Raphael Kiihner and 

Bernhard Gerth's monumental Ausfiihrliche Grammatik der gnechischen 
Sprache (Hanover, 1898-1904) is the fullest work of reference. 
I am equally delighted to express my appreciation of the generous help 
given me by the following: Michael Atkinson, Christopher Collard, E. J. 
Kenney, David Langslow, John Penney, Philomen Probert and John Taylor 
(who wrote the section on New Testament Greek). Rachel Chapman, James 
Clackson and Andrew Hobson have made important contributions, as has 
W. Sidney Allen. (The essay on the history of the pronunciation of Greek is 
in fact a simple precis of material in Allen's Vox Graeca.) Jason Zerdin has 
been the most vigilant and constructive of proof-readers. To my grateful 
acknowledgement of how much I owe to all of them, I must add that I take 
full responsibility for any errors which my obstinacy or carelessness has 
allowed to remain. 
Richard Ashdowne has been my amanuensis since the start of this 
project. He has seen to the production of the manuscript and has proved 
more than equal to the challenge set him by the scribblings with which I 
littered the successive revisions. He has been a constant source not only of 
support but of helpful counsel too. I thank him warmly. 
I dedicate this book to the Joint Association of Classical Teachers' Greek 
Summer School at Bryanston, an institution which has played an 
incalculable role in ensuring the survival of Greek studies in the UK.

Glossary of 
grammatical terms 
accent 
a mark (acute, grave or circumflex) placed above a vowel or 
the second letter of a diphthong to indicate the musical pitch 
at which the accented syllable was pronounced. 
accidence 
the area of grammar dealing with endings. 
accusative 
the usual case of a direct object; many prepositions take the 
accusative. 
active 
the form of a verb most commonly used when the subject of 
the sentence performs the action (e.g. we do = ποιοϋμεν) or 
has his/her/its/their state described (e.g. we are kind = 
εϋφρονές έσμεν). 
adjective 
a word describing, identifying or saying something about a 
noun, with which it agrees in gender, number and case: the 
big book = τό μέγα βιβλίον; the book is big = τό βιβλίον 
(έστι) μέγα. 
adverb 
a word which describes or changes the meaning of a verb, 
an adjective or another adverb: he walks slowly = βραδέως 
βαδίζει. 
agent 
the person who causes an action: it was done by this man = 
ύπό τούτον έπράχθη. 
agree with 
have the same gender, case and number as. 
antecedent 
the noun, pronoun or clause to which a relative pronoun 
refers back. 
aorist tense 
the tense of a verb which refers to something that happened 
in the past: I did this = τούτο έποίησα. Distinguish between 
this past tense and the imperfect (Ί was doing'), the perfect 
CI have done') and the pluperfect (Ί had done'). 
apodosis 
the main clause of a conditional sentence, i.e. not the 'if 
or 'unless 
clause but the clause giving the result. 

apposition 
the placing of a word, phrase or clause in parallel with 
another word, phrase or clause to give further information 
about the latter: George Washington, the President, spoke 
eloquently. 
aspect 
the term referring to the distinction between two ways in 
which a verb can convey time (the time and the type of 
time) - see p. 61. 
augment 
something added at the beginning of verbs to denote a past 
tense. If the verb begins with a consonant, this is the letter 
έ-: for example, επαυον is the imperfect of παύω. 
cardinals 
see numerals. 
case 
the form of a noun, pronoun, adjective or article that shows 
the part it plays in a sentence; there are six cases: 
nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, and 
locative. 
clause 
a section of a sentence in which there are at least a subject 
and a verb. 
common 
either masculine or feminine in gender, according to 
meaning: man = ό άνθρωπος; woman = ή άνθρωπος. 
comparative 
the form of an adjective or adverb that makes it mean 
'more', 'rather' or 'too': more wise (wiser), rather wise, too 
wise = σο φόηερος. 
complement 
a word or phrase which describes the subject of the verb 
and completes the description; it is used with verbs such 
as Ί am' and Ί become' which cannot take an object: 
my mother is intelligent = ή μήτηρ σοφή έστιν; my mother 
became priestess = ή μήτηρ ιέρεια έγένετο. 
compound 
a verb formed by adding a prefix to a simple verb: 
verb 
I overshoot = υπερβάλλω. 
concessive 
a clause usually beginning in English with the word 
clause 
'although' or 'though'. 
conditional 
a clause usually beginning in English with the words 'if', 
clause 
'if not' or 'unless'. 
conjugate 
give the different forms of the verb: παύω, παύεις, παύει, 
παυομεν, παύετε, παύονσι; επαυον, έπαυες, έπαυε, etc. 

conjunction 
a word used to join clauses, phrases or words together: 
men and women = άνδρες και γυναίκες. 
consonant 
a sound, or letter representing a sound, that is used together 
with a vowel, such as β, γ, δ; cf. vowel. 
construction 
the way in which a clause is constructed grammatically. 
contraction 
the process by which two vowels or a vowel and a 
diphthong standing next to each other in adjacent syllables 
are united into a single vowel or diphthong, e.g. χρυσε-ος 
(golden) contracts to χρυσούς and τΐμά-εις (you honour) 
contracts to τΐμφς. 
dative 
the case of an indirect object; among the many meanings of 
the dative are 'to', 'for', 'with' and 'by'; many prepositions 
take the dative. 
declension 
there are a number of patterns according to which Greek 
nouns change their endings; we call these declensions. 
decline 
go through (or, more literally, down) the different cases of a 
noun, adjective or pronoun, in order. 
definite article in English, 'the'; in Greek, ό, ή, τό. 
deictic 
deictic (noun: deixis) is used of words or expressions which 
'point' (= δείκνϋμι) to some feature of a situation. 
Pronouns (e.g., οΰτος, ούτοσί, έκεϊνος (this, this ... here, 
that), etc.) and words of place (ένθάδε, έκει (here, there), 
etc.) and time (νυν, τότε (now, then), etc.) tell us such 
things about a situation as who is involved in it, and where 
it takes place. 
deliberative 
showing that a thought process about a possible action is 
going on: What am I to do? 
deponent 
the passive form of a verb when that form is active in 
meaning. 
diaeresis 
two dots (") placed over the second of two adjacent vowels 
which are to be pronounced separately: βοΐ (to an ox). 
dialect 
this term refers to the different forms of Greek used in 
different areas of the Greek world. The chief dialects that 
occur in literature are Aeolic, Doric, Ionic and Attic. 
diminutive 
a word formed from another to express diminished size, 
e.g. 'hillock' from 'hill' - τό παιδίον (little child) from παις 
(child). 

diphthong 
the union of two vowels pronounced as one syllable (or, 
more properly, one vowel followed by a glide into a second 
vowel). 
direct object 
see object (direct). 
direct speech the words actually used by a speaker. 
dual 
in Greek, nouns or adjectives representing two people or 
things, and verbs with two people or things as their subject, 
can adopt a special form which is known as the dual 
(see pp. 232-3). 
enclitic 
a short word which cannot stand alone but has to follow 
another word, onto which it throws back its accent 
(see p. 224). 'Enclitic' means 'leaning on'. 
ending 
a letter or letters added to the stem (or modification of the 
stem) of verbs, nouns and adjectives, in order to mark tense, 
case, etc. Compare the way in which an English noun 
changes in the plural: dish, dishes. 
feminine 
one of the three Greek genders: γραϋς (old woman) and ναυς 
(ship) are both feminine nouns; they take the feminine form 
of the article, ή. 
finite verb 
a verb with a personal ending, as opposed to infinitives and 
participles. 
future perfect the tense of a verb that refers to something in the future at a 
tense 
stage after it has happened: I shall have ceased = 
πεπαυσομω. In Greek this is a rare form - many verbs do not 
possess it - and it appears in the middle or passive 
(indistinguishable from each other in appearance). 
gender 
the class in which a noun or pronoun is placed in a 
grammatical grouping; in Greek, these classes are masculine, 
feminine, neuter and common (i.e. masculine or feminine 
according to meaning). 
genitive 
the case that shows possession; among its many meanings, 
the dominant one is 'of; in Greek it is also the case of 
separation; many prepositions take the genitive. 
gerund 
a verbal noun. Greek uses the neuter singular of the definite 
article followed by the infinitive to supply this: the art of 
fighting = ή τον μάχεσθαι τέχνη. 

gerundive 
a verbal adjective which expresses the idea of obligation: 
this is (requiring-)to-be-done (i.e., this must be done) = 
τούτο ποιητέον έστίν. 
imperative 
the parts of the verb that express a command: do this! = 
τούτο ποιεί. 
imperfect 
the tense which expresses continuous or repeated or 
tense 
incomplete action in the past: I was considering = ενόμιζον. 
impersonal 
a verb introduced in English by the word 'it' (e.g., 'it is 
verb 
raining'), and in Greek used impersonally in the 3rd person 
singular: it is necessary for me = χρή με. 
indefinite 
in English, 'a' or 'an'; there is no indefinite article in Greek, 
article 
though enclitic τις can serve as an equivalent: a (certain) 
woman = γυνή τις. 
indefinite 
the English word 'ever' added to the end of another word 
construction brings out the force of this construction. Compare 'Pericles, 
who says that, is mad' (specific) with 'Whoever says that is 
mad' (indefinite). 
indicative 
usually refers to a verb when it makes a statement or asks a 
question: τούτο είπεν = he said this. With reference to 
Greek, the word usually indicates that the verb is not in the 
imperative, subjunctive, optative, infinitive or participle. 
indirect 
the reporting of an actual (direct) command, e.g. Do this! 
command 
(direct speech, direct command): She instructed him to do 
this (indirect command). 
indirect 
the noun or pronoun indirectly affected by the verb, at 
object 
which the direct object is aimed: I gave him the book = 
τό βιβλίον αντω έδωκα. 
indirect 
the reporting of an actual (direct) question, e.g. What are you 
question 
doing? (direct speech, direct question): I asked her what she 
was doing (indirect question). 
indirect 
the reporting of someone's words, e.g. I have done this 
statement 
(direct statement): He said that he had done this (indirect 
statement). 
infinitive 
the form of a verb that means 'to do something': to teach = 
διδάσκειν. In Greek, infinitives vary according to tense and 
voice. 
inflection 
see ending. 

a sound, word or phrase standing outside the grammatical 
structure of the sentence and expressing an emotion such as 
distress, joy or disgust: alas! = οϊμοι. 
a verb which does not take a direct object, e.g. 'go', 'come'. 
interjection 
intransitive 
verb 
irregular verb a verb that does not follow the set pattern of παύω (the 
regular verb in this Grammar) and either belongs to a small 
class of verbs or has its own individual forms. 
jussive 
giving an order. 
locative 
the case which tells us where something is happening: 
οϊκοι = at home; Άθήνησι = in Athens. 
macron 
a line above a vowel indicating that it is long, e.g. ά ΐ ϋ. 
main clause 
the clause which is the basic grammatical unit of a sentence. 
'Although I love her, she still avoids me.' 'She still avoids me' 
makes sense on its own, while 'although I love her' does 
not. Thus 'she still avoids me' is the main clause, and 
'although I love her' is a subordinate clause. 
masculine 
one of the three Greek genders: άνήρ (man) and λόγος 
(word) are both masculine nouns; they take the masculine 
form of the definite article, δ. 
middle 
a term applying to certain Greek verb forms. The middle 
often has a reflexive quality: παύομαι = I stop myself, 
i.e. I cease; φέρομαι = I carry off for myself, I win. 
However, a number of verbs have a middle form but an 
entirely active meaning, e.g. ήδομαι = I rejoice. 
mood 
the grammatical form of a verb which shows whether it is in 
the indicative, subjunctive, optative or imperative. 
negative 
expressing denial, refusal or prohibition. In English, the 
words 'no' or 'not' are generally used. 
neuter 
one of the three Greek genders: γάλα (milk) and δώρον (gift) 
are both neuter nouns; they take the neuter form of the 
definite article, τό. 
nominative 
the case of the subject of a sentence or (usually) of the 
complement of a verb: the king is angry = ό βασιλεύς 
όργίζεται. 

noun 
a word that names or denotes a person or thing: όνομα = 
name or noun, βιβλίον = book, όργή = anger. 
number 
the state of being either singular or plural or dual. 
numerals 
numbers; these are either cardinals (1, 2, 3, etc.), ordinals 
(1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) or adverbs (once, twice, three times, 
etc.). 
object (direct) a noun or its equivalent acted upon by a transitive verb: 
the dog bites the boy = ό κύων τόν παιδα δάκνει. 
a Greek mood of the verb which does not express statements 
but such concepts as 'would', 'might', 'if only!' It is also 
used in the indefinite construction and in certain subordinate 
clauses. It is more remote than the subjunctive in either 
likelihood or time. (The pronunciations 'optative' and 
'optative' are both current, with the UK having a preference 
for the latter.) 
see numerals. 
to give a full grammatical description of a word: for verbs 
this means to give the person, number, tense, mood, voice 
and meaning, e.g., φιλεΐς is the second person singular 
present indicative active of φιλέω, Ί love'. 
Greek particles, short words which never change, can 
connect clauses and qualify - and colour - words, phrases 
or clauses. 
an adjective formed from a verb (it can still take an object). 
In Greek, participles are either present (a loving woman = 
γυνή φιλούσα), future (about to love her husband = 
φιλήσουσα τόν άνδρα), aorist (after loving her husband = 
φιλήσασα τόν άνδρα) or perfect (after having died, i.e. being 
dead = τ£θνη#α>ια). 
part of speech a grammatical term identifying the function of a word: noun, 
adjective, pronoun, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, 
interjection. 
passive 
when the verb is in the passive form, the subject of the verb 
does not perform the action but experiences it: the king was 
loved = ό βασιλεύς έφιλήθη. In Greek, a significant number 
of middle verbs use the passive form in the aorist 
(see p. 66). 
optative 
ordinals 
parse 
particle 
participle 

perfect tense the tense of a verb that refers to a completed action, the 
effects of which still continue in the present; in English the 
word 'have' or 'has' is generally used: he has written a letter 
(and it is now written) = γέγραφεν έπιστολήν. The Greek 
perfect may often be translated by the present: τέθνηκε = 
he has died, i.e. he is dead. 
person 
a term identifying the subject of a verb: 1st person -
I (singular), we (plural); 2nd person - you (both singular 
and plural); 3rd person - he, she, it (singular), they (plural); 
dual - both of you (2nd person), both of them (3rd person). 
(Adjective: personal.) 
personal 
a pronoun that refers to a person, e.g. I, you = έγώ, σύ. 
pronoun 
phrase 
a self-contained group of words which does not contain a 
finite verb: I walked through the city. 
pluperfect 
the tense that means 'had', referring to a past state resulting 
tense 
from a completed action: the flower had bloomed (and was 
then in flower) = τό άνθος ήνθήκει. 
plural 
of nouns and other parts of speech, referring to more than 
one: the ships = αί νήες. 
positive 
not negative; (of adjectives) not comparative or superlative. 
possessive 
a pronoun, in an adjectival form, that shows possession, 
pronoun 
belonging to someone or something: my, mine = έμός, έμή, 
έμόν. 
prefix 
a syllable or word added to the beginning of another word: 
I overshoot = υπερβάλλω. 
preposition 
a word that stands (almost always) in front of a noun or 
pronoun to produce an adverbial phrase. It expresses a 
spatial, temporal or logical meaning. In Greek it is followed 
by the accusative, genitive or dative: according to the laws 
= κατά τούς νόμους. 
present tense the tense of a verb that refers to something happening now: 
I am playing, I play = παίζω. 
principal 
the forms of a verb that must be learnt to give access to all 
parts 
its parts. 

pronoun 
a word that stands instead of a noun (person or thing), 
e.g. 'it' used in place of 'the tree': this, that = ούτος, αύτη, 
τούτο; έκείνος, έκείνη, έκείνο. See also personal pronoun. 
protasis 
the 'if...' or 'unless ...' clause of a conditional sentence. 
reduplication the process by which verbs begining with a single consonant 
(but not β) form a prefix in the perfect, pluperfect and future 
perfect by adding that letter followed by an ε at the 
beginning: παύω, πέπαυκα, έπ^παύκη, πεπαύσομαι. 
reflexive 
a word referring back to the subject of the main verb and 
pronoun 
indicating that the action of the verb is performed on its 
subject: he killed himself = άπέκτεινεν εαυτόν. The reflexive 
pronoun never appears in the nominative. 
regular verb 
a verb that follows παύω in its forms. 
relative 
a pronoun that introduces a subordinate clause, identifying 
pronoun 
the person or thing mentioned in the main clause: the man 
who loves me = ό άνήρ δς φιλεΐ έμέ. 
sentence 
a group of words with a subject and a verb, that can stand 
on its own to make a statement, ask a question, give a 
command or express a wish. 
sequence of 
the principle according to which the use of a certain tense in 
tenses and 
the main clause determines whether the subjunctive or the 
moods 
optative should be used in a subordinate clause. 
singular 
of nouns and other parts of speech, referring to just one: 
the tree = τό δένδρον. 
stem 
the part of a noun, adjective or verb to which endings are 
added: λόγ- is the stem of λόγος = word; παύ- is the stem of 
παύω = I stop; πανσ- is the stem of παύσω = I shall stop. 
subject 
in a clause or sentence, the noun or pronoun that causes the 
action of the verb or has his/her/its/their state described: 
the queen killed the king = ή βασίλεια άπέκτεινε τον 
βασιλέα. 
subjunctive 
a verb form that is used, among many other functions, to 
express doubt, unlikelihood or possibility; it is less remote 
than the optative in either likelihood or time. Words such as 
'may', 'might' and 'should' can indicate a subjunctive in 
English (see p. 61). 

subordinate 
a clause which depends on another clause (usually the main 
clause 
clause) of the sentence in which it stands. In the sentence, 
'He is an author who is easy to understand', the clause 'who 
is easy to understand' describes the author. The clause 
would not make sense on its own. Thus it is subordinate. 
superlative 
the form of an adjective or adverb that makes it mean 'most' 
or'very': most small (smallest), very small = μϊκρότατος. 
syllable 
part of a word that forms a spoken unit, usually a vowel 
sound with consonants before and/or after: συμ-βάλ-λω 
(I throw together); σύ-νο-δος (meeting). 
syntax 
the area of grammar dealing with constructions. 
tense 
the form of a verb that shows when the action takes place: 
present, future, perfect, etc. (The word 'tense' is related to 
French temps (= time).) 
terminations 
the endings of nouns, adjectives and verbs that show their 
case, number, gender, tense, person etc. 
tragedy 
the tragic plays of the three great Attic poets of the fifth 
century BC, Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. 
transitive 
a verb used with a direct object either expressed or 
verb 
understood, e.g. 'pick apples' or 'pick till you are tired' (but 
not 'he picked at his lunch' - here 'picked' is intransitive). 
verb 
a word that describes an action: I arrived at Athens = 
άφϊκόμην εις τάς Αθήνας. 
vocative 
the case by which one addresses or calls to someone: 
Demosthenes, come here! = ώ Δημόσθενες, έλθέ δεϋρο. 
voice 
the set of forms of a verb that show the relation of the 
subject to the action, i.e. (in Greek) active, middle or 
passive. 
vowel 
a sound, or letter representing a sound, that can be spoken 
by itself: α, ε, η, ι, ο, ω, υ.

Throughout this Grammar, where α, ι or υ are long, they are marked by a 
macron (i.e. ά, ΐ, 0), unless they are already shown to be long either by an 
iota subscript beneath them (i.e. ql) or by a circumflex above them (except 
that, when ι or υ forms part of a diphthong, a circumflex does not indicate 
that the ι or υ is long but that the diphthong as a whole is long).

Breathings and accents (see below for both) are written over the second 
letter of a diphthong, e.g. οίδα (I know). Where one of the above 
combinations is pronounced as two separate vowels, breathings are written 
over the first letter, e.g. άϊδρις (ignorant), while the accent is written over 
the vowel to which it belongs. Note also the diaeresis ("). 
In many modern texts the iota subscript will not be found. The iota will 
be placed at the same level as the other letters (e.g. coi, not ω). This was in 
fact the practice in classical times. The iota subscript was a later invention. 
| Double consonants 
When double consonants are used, the sound is correspondingly 
lengthened, e.g. 
vv 
unnamed (compare unaimed) 
ππ 
higigocket 
σσ 
disservice 
ττ 
rattrap 
The exception is γγ which is pronounced as in linger, i.e. as if νγ. Similarly, 
γκ γχ are pronounced with an 'n' as in encore and anchor. Note also that 
in many words Attic has ττ where other dialects (including Ionic) have σσ: 
thus θάλαττα (the sea) is Attic, cf. θάλασσα. 
I Moveable ν 
In the accidence tables in this Grammar you will see that some forms are 
given which end in (v). This is the so-called moveable nu, which is 
generally added at the end of a word when the next word begins with a 

vowel. It can be added to words ending in -σι, to the 3 sg. (of verbs) in -ε 
and to έστι (= is). Compare the following: 
πάσι δίδωσι ταύτα 
he gives these things to everybody 
πάσιν έδωκεν αύτά 
he gave these very things to everybody 
0 
Moveable nu can also be added at the end of a sentence, e.g. 
πάσι ταύτα έδωκεν. 
he gave these things to everybody 
| Breathings 
Words which begin with a vowel have a breathing mark over the first 
(in the case of a diphthong, over the second) letter. This will either be: 
the 'rough' breathing, denoting the sound 'h'; or 
the 'smooth' breathing, denoting the absence of the sound 'h' 
Note that all words beginning with ρ and υ take a rough breathing, e.g. 
βόδον (rose) and ύδωρ (water), hence, e.g., 'rheumatism' and 'hydraulics'. 
Some examples: 
ή, αϋτη, αύτη, ό φήτωρ (speaker) 
Note the position of the breathing with capital letters: Ηρόδοτος, 
Αισχύλος. 
I Crasis 
In Greek, some combinations of words which occurred frequently together 
could coalesce to form a single word by a process called crasis (κράσις = 
mixing), if the first ended in a vowel and the second began with one. This 
is similar to the English contraction in words like 'won't', 'shan't', 'I'm' 
and 'I'd'. In Greek it is usually indicated by a smooth breathing on the first 
vowel sound of the word even though it begins with a consonant. Some 
common examples (with their full forms) are: 
κάλοι κάγαθοί 
κάλοι και άγαθοί 
good and fine men 
ταύτά 
τάαύτά 
the same things 
χω 
και ό 
and the, and he 
ώνδρες 
ώ άνδρες 
Omen! 
In recognising crasis, it is worth remembering that χ or θ may represent a 
combination of κ or τ with the rough breathing. 

| Accents 
Greek words have pitch accents, not stresses. These accents, ' (acute), 
' (grave) and ~ (circumflex), denote the musical pitch at which the 
accented syllable was pronounced. The acute (') denotes high pitch, the 
grave Ο lower pitch and the circumflex f , originally written as a grave 
and an acute combined, ") high pitch falling to low. 
This is difficult for English speakers — whose language is stressed — 
to reproduce. Modern Greeks in fact use the accents to denote stress, not 
pitch — in fact, the change from the pitch to the stress accent took place in 
antiquity, probably before the end of the fourth century AD —, and 
English-speaking learners may wish to follow their example. 
In the UK, USA and Holland, there is a strong tradition of stressing Greek 
according to the rules for Latin (for which, see p. 1 of the companion Latin 
Grammar). This follows the mistaken arguments of a Dutch medical doctor 
named Henning in the 17th century, and cannot be recommended in spite 
of its widespread use. 
The tradition of writing accents appears to have started at Alexandria 
around 200 BC and is generally accredited to Aristophanes of Byzantium. 
Initially its use seems to have been intermittent and mainly to clarify 
ambiguities — in which respect it can still prove helpful. 
Accents are marked throughout this Grammar, and we outline various 
ways in which they are of use in the understanding of Greek on p. 218. 
However, those who do not wish to master the expertise of accentuation 
surely need feel no shame. It did not exist at the high period of Attic 
literature. Those who wish to go ahead are referred to the appendix on 
accentuation on pp. 222-6. 
I Punctuation 
There was virtually no punctuation in fifth- and fourth-century Athens. 
Nor were there any gaps between words. It seems good sense, however, to 
adopt the conventions developed later in these areas. 
Note, therefore, the following punctuation marks: 
full stop, as in English 
comma, as in English 
colon or semi-colon (placed on a level with the top of the small 
letters) 
; 
question mark (?) 

| Practice exercises 
Write the following Greek words in English letters: 
δραμα, Ιπποπόταμος (-ος = -us), Ζεύς, Παρθενών, λύγξ, Γοργών, 
ήχώ, Αφροδίτη, Βάκχος, πρώτον. 
Write the following English words in Greek: 
acropolis (c = κ), rhododendron, dogma, symposium (-um = -ov), 
character, asbestos, Sphinx, Socrates, Athene, Cyclops. 
Which animals do you imagine make the following noises in Greek? 
αύ αύ, βή βή, βρεκεκεκέξ, κικκαβαϋ, κόκκϋ.1 
We give here a fable of Aesop (336) so that you can practise your 
pronunciation: 
χειμώνος ώρςι τον σΐτον βραχέντα οί μύρμηκες εψϋχον. τέττιξ δε λϊμώττων 
ήτει αυτούς τροφήν. οί δε μύρμηκες εΐπον αύτφ· 'δια τί τό θέρος ου 
συνήγες και συ τροφήν;' ό δέ εΐπεν 'ουκ έσχόλαζον, άλλ' ήδον μουσικώς.' 
οί δέ γελάσαντες εΐπον* 'άλλ' ει θέρους ώραις ηϋλεις, χειμώνος όρχοϋ.' 
ό μύθος δηλοϊ δτι ού δει τινα άμελείν έν παντι πράγματι, ϊνα μη λϋπηθή 
και κινδϋνεύση. 
In the winter season, the ants dried out their drenched grain. A grasshopper 
who was famished with hunger asked them for food. The ants said to him, 
'Why didn't you collect food in the summer like us (literally, also)?' And he 
said, Ί did not have the time, but I sang away melodiously.' And they said 
with a laugh, 'Well then, if you made music in the summer months, (you 
can) dance in the winter!' 
The story shows that one should not be negligent in any matter if one 
wants to avoid distress and danger.

| The history of the pronunciation of Greek 
In 1267, Roger Bacon, the English philosopher and experimental scientist, 
observed that there were not five men in Latin Christendom acquainted 
with Greek grammar. And despite efforts to improve the situation, Petrarch 
could count only eight or nine Italians who knew Greek a hundred years 
later. 
However, Italy did see a gradual growth .in the teaching of Greek in the 
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a progress further speeded by the influx 
of Byzantine scholars after the fall of Constantinople to the Hirks in 1453. 
Naturally enough, these scholars pronounced ancient Greek like their 
native tongue of modern Greek. Thus, in addition to the other distortions 
they inevitably inflicted upon the pronunciation of ancient Greek, they 
gave respectability to the considerable reduction of the rich variety of 
vowel sounds available to the classical language, ι, η, υ, ει, οι and υι were 
all pronounced as T, and the judgement of another English scholar of the 
following century, Roger Ascham — the author of The Scholemaster' — 
is understandable, however hyperbolically expressed: 'all sounds in Greek 
are now exactly the same, reduced, that is to say, to a like thin and slender 
character, and subjected to the authority of a single letter, the iota; so that 
all one can hear is a feeble piping like that of sparrows, or an unpleasant 
hissing like that of snakes/ 
Long before Ascham's broadside, scholarly doubts had arisen about the 
current pronunciation of Greek. A Spanish humanist, Antonio of Lebrixa, 
led the way in 1486. In a further treatise of 1503, he argued, among other 
things, that η is a long vowel corresponding to ε as ω does to o, and that 
ζ is pronounced σδ. Further progress was made by the great Venetian 
printer Aldus Manutius, who was the first to cite the correct bleating 
pronunciation of βή βή, rejecting the current 'vee vee'. 
Then in 1528 Erasmus' dialogue De recta Latini Graecique sermonis 
pronuntiatione ('Concerning the correct pronunciation of Latin and Greek') 
was published in Basle. This light-hearted conversation between a bear 
(the instructor) and a lion was a milestone on the journey towards the 
re-establishment of the classical pronunciation. 
Though his work appeared to have liberated ancient Greek from the 
tyranny of its modern delivery, Erasmus himself did not in fact practise 
what he preached. The credit for practical application of the reformed 
pronunciation must go to two Cambridge scholars, John Cheke and 

Thomas Smith, who in 1540 were elected Regius Professors of Greek and 
Civil Law respectively. Their attempts to establish the new pronunciation1 
were temporarily halted when the Chancellor of the University published in 
1542 an edict specifically forbidding it — undergraduates, he claimed, were 
becoming insolent in making use of an exotic pronunciation and relishing 
the fact that their elders could not understand it. However, his edict was 
repealed in 1558. As W.S. Allen2 remarks, 'with all their imperfections, the 
16th-century reforms resulted in something like an approximation to what 
we now believe to have been the classical Attic values ...'. The so-called 
Erasmian pronunciation now reached out from England to the continent. 
But at the very time that English scholarship seemed to be leading the 
rest of Europe in this area, it suffered a major set-back. In the sixteenth 
century, the Middle English vowel system shifted to that of modern English 
(the so-called Great English Vowel Shift). This altered the nature of the 
English long vowels to which sixteenth-century scholars had, with 
remarkable accuracy, tied the Greek vowel sounds. The most notorious 
examples of what happened are the pronunciation of η as in meat, αι as in 
pay, ει as in kaleidoscope, and ου as in gown. 
And so by the end of the nineteenth century, a new set of reforms had to 
be instituted. The Cambridge University Press has played an honourable 
role in publishing the necessary documentation. First, there was The 
Restored Pronunciation of Greek and Latin by E.V. Arnold and R.S. Conway 
(1895, 4th revised edition 1908). Then there was The Teaching of Classics 
(1954). Finally there has been the influential work of W. Sidney Allen 
(Vox Graeca, 1968). We begin the new millennium with no excuse for 
failing to fall in line with philological scholarship in this important area. 
1 Not directly derived from Erasmus. Cheke and Smith did not, in fact, always agree 
among themselves: while Cheke pours scorn on 'af af as the English equivalent of a 
Greek dog's αύ αύ, Smith cites the 'af af bark of Maltese terriers.

Reference grammar 

Nouns, adjectives 
and pronouns 
| Number and gender 
In English grammar we are familiar with the concept of number, i.e. 
singular and plural: 
The girl was cleverer than the boys but they were not afraid of her. 
Here the words in bold are in the singular, while the words underlined are 
in the plural. 
We are also familiar with the concept of gender, i.e. masculine, feminine 
and neuter: 
The boy and the girl love the parrot but it feels no affection for them. 
Here the boy is 'masculine' and the girl is 'feminine'. While the parrot will 
of course in reality be either male or female, it is here regarded as neither: 
hence the word 'it'. This is the 'neuter' gender. 
The assignment of gender in Greek will strike English speakers as 
extremely arbitrary. Greek, for example, has a feminine as well as a neuter 
word for 'book', and feminine words for 'island', 'army' and 'cavalry'. 
| Cases 
Greek is an inflected language, i.e. the endings of nouns, pronouns, 
adjectives and verbs change to reflect their relationship with other words in 
a sentence. English is largely uninfected, though some words do change 
according to their function. 
I am searching for a woman whom I admire, but I cannot find her. 
Is she avoiding me? 

'Whom', 'her' and 'me' are the accusative (direct object forms) of 'who', 
'she' and T. (You can see how English tends to abolish inflection from the 
fact that most speakers nowadays would say 'who' and not 'whom', or 
omit the word altogether, in the first sentence.) 
Verbs in tenses (see pp. 60-1) with personal endings are called finite 
verbs; they have subjects and often have objects. The subject carries out 
the action of the verb; the object is on the receiving end of the action of the 
verb. In the first sentence above, Τ is the subject of the verb 'am searching 
for', and 'a woman' is the object. Τ am doing the searching; 'a woman' is 
being searched for. The subject is in the nominative case; the object is in 
the accusative case. 
Which words are the subjects and the objects in the following sentences? 
He is studying his grammar. 
The dog keeps distracting him. 
I am watching them. 
These people I am watching especially carefully. 
In what case are the following? 
she, her, whom, us, me 
Nominative and accusative are the names of two of the Greek cases. In 
Greek there are five main cases, and they all have names which are still 
used in English grammars. 
In Greek the endings of nouns, pronouns and adjectives vary according 
to the case they are in as well as according to their number and gender.1 
Generally speaking, in modern English this happens only with some 
pronouns, as in the examples above. 
The endings by which the cases are marked on most Greek nouns fall 
into a number of regular patterns. (The word 'case' comes from the Latin 
word meaning 'fall'.) We call these patterns declensions. It is customary to 
recognise three of these in Greek. To decline is to go through (or down) 
the different cases of a noun, adjective or pronoun in order. 
1 In the vocabulary lists in this grammar, nouns are given in their nom. and 
gen. singular (though the gen. is omitted in the case of regular nouns of the first 
and second declensions), while adjectives and pronouns are given in their nom. sg. 
masculine, feminine and neuter. 

In Greek, adjectives are in the same number, gender and case as the 
nouns to which they refer. (This is called agreement.) The endings, 
however, may differ since the adjective may belong to a different 
declension from its noun. 
1 | Nominative 
The nominative is, as we have seen, the case of the subject of the verb: 
ό Σωκράτης αίνιγματωδώς λέγει. 
Socrates is speaking in riddles. 
It is also used for the complement of the verb, when the verb's subject is 
in the nominative. 
Σωκράτης φιλόσοφος έστιν. 
Socrates is a philosopher. 
0 
Neuter plural subjects are almost always followed by singular verbs: 
τά οίκήματα φκοδομήθη. 
The buildings were put up. 
2 | Genitive 
The basic meaning of the genitive case is 'of'. It is used mainly in these 
senses: 
• 
the possessive genitive: 
την οικίάν την Σίμωνος (Lysias 3.32) 
the house of Simon 
τίς εσθ' ό χώρος; του θεών νομίζεται; (Sophocles, Oedipus at 
Colonus 38) 
What is this place? Which of the gods is it considered to belong to? 
Θουκυδίδη ν τόν Όλόρου (Thucydides 4.104.4) 
Thucydides, the son of Olorus 
• 
the partitive genitive: 
τούς ... άπορους τών πολιτών (Demosthenes 18.104) 
the needy among (out of) the citizens 

τον δε πεσόντα ποδών έλαβε. (Homer, Iliad 4.463) 
But he held him by his feet as he fell. 
of price, value and the penalty: 
Ιερά ... τριών ταλάντων (Lysias 30.20) 
offerings worth three talents 
άργυρίου ... πρίασθαι ή άποδόσθαι ϊππον. (Plato, Republic 333b) 
to buy or sell a horse for money 
ους πάντες ήδεσαν ... άπό συκοφαντίας ζώντας ... ύπήγον θανάτου 
(Xenophon, Hellenica 2.3.12) 
the people who everybody knew were living off malicious prosecutions, 
they impeached on a capital charge 
of crimes: 
δώρων έκρίθησαν (Lysias 27.3) 
they were tried for bribery 
But note that compounds of κατα- take the genitive of the person 
charged and the accusative of the crime: καταγιγνώσκω (I condemn), 
καταδικάζω (I judge against), καταψηφίζομαι (I vote against), 
κατακρίνω (I give sentence against) 3ηάκατηγορέω (I accuse). 
τούτου ... δειλίάν καταψηφίζεσθαι (Lysias 14.11) 
to vote this man guilty of cowardice 
of separation» lack: 
ου πόνων ύφίετο, ού κίνδυνων άφίστατο, ού χρημάτων έφείδετο. 
(Xenophon, Agesilaus 7.1) 
He did not relax his efforts, stand aloof from dangers, or spare his 
money. 
πολλού δει ούτως έχειν (Plato, Apology 35d) 
That is far from being the case, (πολλού δει = there is a lack of 
much, much is lacking) 
ένδεά ... κάλλους ή άρετής (Plato, Republic 381c) 
lacking in beauty or virtue 
of comparison: 
When ή ( = than) is not used,1 the object of comparison (i.e. the word 
after 'than' in English) is in the genitive. 
When ή is used, the people or things compared are in the same case: 
φιλώ γάρ ού σέ μάλλον ή δόμους έμούς. (Euripides, Medea 327) 
For I do not love you more than my own house. 

ήττων ... άμαθης σοφού, δειλός άνδρείου. (Plato, Phaedrus 239a) 
An ignorant man is inferior to a wise man, a coward to a brave man. 
• 
of superiority: 
Έρως των θεών βασιλεύει. (Plato, Symposium 195c) 
Love is king of the gods. 
• 
of exclamation (the thing exclaimed over): 
& Ζεύ βασιλεύ, της λεπτότητος των φρενών. (Aristophanes, Clouds 
153) 
0 King Zeus, what (an example of) subtlety of intellect! 
• 
'the role of, 'the nature of: 
πενίάν φέρειν ού παντός, άλλ' άνδρός σοφού. (Menander, Sententiae 
463) 
To bear poverty is the mark not of everybody, but of the wise man. 
ούδ' έμοιγε δοκεί δικαίου τούτ' είναι πολίτου. (Demosthenes 8.72) 
And this does not seem to me to be the duty of a just citizen. 
• 
of quality: 
έόντα (= Attic όντα) ... τρόπου ήσυχίου (Herodotus 1.107) 
being of a peaceful disposition 
• 
of degree: εις τούτο, εις τοσούτο 
εις γάρ τούτο θράσους και άναιδείάς τοτ' άφίκετ[ο] (Demosthenes 
21.194) 
for he reached such a pitch of boldness and shamelessness then 
όράτε ... οΐ προελήλυθ' άσελγείάς. (Demosthenes 4.9) 
You see to what a pitch of brutality he has come. 
• 
the genitive may be found after έν and εις where the place is omitted: 
έν Αρίφρονος (Plato, Protagoras 320a) 
at Ariphron's (house) 
εις διδασκάλου φοιτών (Plato, Alcibiades 1 109d) 
going to the school (i.e., (to the house) of the teacher) 
ειν (εις) Άιδάο (Homer) 
in, to (the kingdom of) Hades 
• 
verbs of desire (έπιθϋμέω, έράω) are followed by a genitive: 
(oi φαύλοι) έρώσι τών σωμάτων μάλλον ή τών ψυχών. (Plato, 
Symposium 181b) 
Base men are in love with the bodies rather than the souls. 

However, φιλέω (I love) and ποθέω (I long for) take the accusative. 
The genitive is also used: 
• 
with a number of prepositions (see pp. 56-9) 
• 
in some expressions of time and space (see pp. 131-5) 
• 
in the genitive absolute construction (see pp. 140-1) 
The following verbs take the genitive: 
• 
share in, take hold of, touchy aim at, miss, begin 
μετέχω 
I share in 
(συλ)λαμβάνομαι 
I take hold of 
άπτομαι 
I grasp, take hold of 
άντέχομαι 
I cling to 
θιγγάνω 
I touch, take hold of 
όρέγομαι 
I reach out for, grasp at, long for 
άμαρτάνω 
I miss, fail to win 
σφάλλομαι 
I am cheated of, foiled in 
άρχω 
I begin 
τυγχάνω 
I meet with 
• 
tastey smelly perceivey remember, desire (see p. 14 above), spare, care 
for, neglect, despise 
γεύομαι 
I taste

I hear (usually with the accusative of the thing 
φροντίζω

φείδομαι 
έπιμέλομαι

opposed to something as a whole) 
take thought for 
forget 
desire

• 
rule, command 
άρχω 
κρατέω 
στρατηγέω 
I command, rule over 
I get possession of, rule over 
I am general of 
The above list is by no means exhaustive and a number of these verbs can 
take the accusative too. 
The basic meanings of the dative case are 'to* and 'for'. It goes naturally 
with verbs of giving and the like ('dative' derives from the Latin word for 
'give'). These verbs are regularly followed by a direct object in the 
accusative and an indirect object in the dative. 
βόδον έδωκα τή έμή άδελφή. 
I gave a rose (direct object) to my sister (indirect object). 
or I gave my sister a rose. 
Other uses of the dative include the following: 
• 
the possessive dative: 
άλλοις μεν γάρ χρήματά έστι πολλά και νήες και ϊπποι, ήμΐν δε 
ξύμμαχοι άγαθοί. (Thucydides 1.86.3) 
For others have a lot of money and ships and horses, but we have good 
allies (literally, to others there is a lot of money ...). 
• 
of advantage or disadvantage: 
πάς άνήρ αύτώ πονεί. (Sophocles, Ajax 1366) 
Every man toils for himself. 
ήδε ή ήμέρά τοις Έλλησι μεγάλων κακών άρξει. (Thucydides 2.12.4) 
This day will be the beginning of great sorrrows for the Greeks (i.e., for 
their disadvantage). 
• 
the 'ethic' or 'polite' dative: 
τούτω πάνυ μοι προσέχετε τόν νουν. (Demosthenes 18.178) 
Pay close attention to this, I beg you. (i.e., Please pay ...) 
Cf. 'Study me how to please the eye' (Shakespeare, Love's Labour's Lost 
I.i.80). 
ώ μήτερ, ώς καλός μοι ό πάππος. (Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 1.3.2) 
Oh, mother, how handsome grandpa is (I've just realized)! 
In the second example, the feeling conveyed is surprise. 
3 | Dative 

• 
likeness and unlikeness: 
σκιαϊς έοικότες 
like shadows 
• 
'in': 
άνήρ ήλικίςι... έτι τότε ων νέος (Thucydides 5.43.2) 
a man who was then still young in age 
• 
'with', 'by': 
έβαλλέ με λίθοις. (Lysias 3.8) 
He hit me with stones. 
νόσφ ύστερον άποθανόντα (Thucydides 8.84) 
having died later of (from) a disease 
If the agent (doer) of an action is a person, he or she is usually in the 
genitive after ύπό (by, at the hands of). However, with the perfect and 
pluperfect passive, and after the verbal adjective in -τέος (see pp. 
193-4), the agent can be in the dative: 
πολλαι θεραπεΐαι τοις Ιάτροϊς εϋρηνται. (Isocrates 8.39) 
Many cures have been discovered by doctors. 
• 
the measurement of difference: 
τή κεφαλή μείζονα (Plato, Phaedo 101a) 
taller by a head 
μακρω άριστος (Plato, Laws 729d) 
by far the best 
• 
note the idiomatic use of the dative plural with αυτός (usually without 
the article) in such expressions as: 
μίαν δε (ναϋν) αύτοις άνδράσιν εΐλον ήδη. (Thucydides 2.90) 
They had already taken one ship with its men and all. 
άποδόσθαι βούλομαι τον όνον άγων αύτοισι τοις κανθηλίοις. 
(Aristophanes, Wasps 169-70) 
I want to take this donkey and sell it, pack-saddle and all. 
• 
for the use of the dative in expressions of time and place, 
see pp. 131-3. 
• 
the dative is used with a number of prepositions (see pp. 56-9). 
The following verbs take the dative: 
• 
help, injure 
βοηθέω 
I help 

άρέσκω 
I please 
εύνοέω 
I am friendly, favourable to 
όργίζομαι 
I am angry with 
άπειλέω

I fight 
πολεμέω 
I make war on, quarrel with 
λϋσιτελεϊ μοι 
it profits me, it is better for me 
συμφέρει μοι 
it is of advantage to me 
But note that ώφελέω (I help), μΐσέω (I hate) and βλάπτω (I hurt, 
hinder) take the accusative. 
meety yield 
άπαντάω

ένάντιός είμι 
I am unlike, opposite to 
πρέπει μοι 
it is fitting for me 
note also χράομαι with the dative = I use, experience, treat, deal with, 
have sexual intercourse with. 

4 | Accusative 
The accusative is, as we have seen, the case of the (direct) object: 
φιλώ την γραϋν. 
I love the old woman. 
Note: 
• 
the 'cognate' accusative: 
Here the noun in the accusative is from the same origin as the verb 
('cognate' means 'born together with'), e.g. 
άλλη ν πολλή ν φλυάρίάν φλυάροϋντα (Plato, Apology 19c) 
talking another lot of nonsense 
τί προσγελάτε τον πανύστατον γέλων; (Euripides, Medea 1041) 
Why do you smile the last smile you will ever smile? 
• 
the accusative of respect: 
πόδας ώκύς Άχιλλεύς (Homer) 
swift-footed Achilles (literally, Achilles, swift as to (with respect to) 
his feet) 
διεφθαρμένον την άκοήν (Herodotus 1.38) 
deaf (literally, destroyed/ruined as to his hearing) 
πλήγεντα την κεφαλήν πελέκει (Herodotus 6.38) 
struck on his head with an axe 
Some verbs are followed by two accusatives, e.g. 
• 
make somebody something, regard someone as something 
στρατηγόν ... αύτόν άπέδειξε. (Xenophon, Anabasis 1.1.2) 
He appointed him general. 
τρεις τών έμών έχθρών νεκρούς 
θήσω, πατέρα τε και κόρην πόσιν τ' έμόν. (Euripides, Medea 374-5) 
I shall make corpses of three of my enemies, the father and the girl 
and my husband. 
οί... κατάπτυστοι Θετταλοί και άναίσθητοι Θηβαίοι φίλο ν, 
ευεργέτη ν, σωτήρα τον Φίλιππον ήγούντο. (Demosthenes 18.43) 
The contemptible Thessalians and stupid Thebans considered Philip 
their friend, their benefactor, their saviour. 
• 
asky teach someone something; conceal, take something away from 
someone 
ου τοϋτ' έρωτώ σε. (Aristophanes, Clouds 641) 

I am not asking you this. 
την θυγατέρα έκρυπτε τόν θάνατον του άνδρός. (Lysias 32.7) 
He concealed from his daughter her husband's death. 
τούτων την τιμήν άποστερεϊ με. (Demosthenes 28.13) 
He robs me of the price of these things. 
• 
treat someone [well or badly], speak of someone [well or badly] 
πολλά άγαθά υμάς έποίησεν. (Lysias 5.3) 
He did you much good. 
τότε δη ό Θεμιστοκλέης κεΐνόν τε και τους Κορινθίους πολλά τε και 
κακά έλεγε. (Herodotus 8.61) 
Then Themistocles spoke many damning words about that man and 
the Corinthians. 
The following are other uses of the accusative: 
• 
It is used after a large number of prepositions (see pp. 56-9). 
• 
It is used in many expressions of time, place and space (see pp. 131-5). 
• 
For the 'accusative absolute', see pp. 141-2. 
5 | Vocative 
The vocative is the case by which one addresses or calls to someone. It is 
used with or without ώ (0!): 
ώ Ζεϋ και θεοί (Plato, Protagoras 310d) 
0 Zeus and you gods! 
άκούεις, ΑΙσχίνη; (Demosthenes 18.121) 
Do you hear, Aeschines? 
The vocative is generally identical or close in form to the nominative and 
so is not included in the tables in this Grammar. Where a separate form 
needs to be learnt, we have given it in a note. 
Note the use of the nominative with a vocative force in these examples: 
ό παις, άκολούθει δεΰρο (Aristophanes, Frogs 521) 
Boy, follow me over here! 
ούτος, τί πάσχεις, ώ κακόδαιμον Ξανθιά; (Aristophanes, Wasps 1) 
You there, what's your problem, you accursed Xanthias? 
ώ γενναίος (Plato, Phaedrus 277c) 
Oh, the noble man! 

| The dual 
In Greek, nouns representing a pair of people or things can adopt special 
forms, known as the dual. Adjectives and verbs may agree and thus be in 
the dual as well, or they may be in the plural. This number is not included 
in the accidence section of this Grammar, but it is explained in an appendix 
on pp. 232-3.

Note 
1 -η in the nom. singular of feminine nouns is kept in all cases of the singular. 
2 -a (usually long) in the nom. singular after ε, ι or ρ is kept in all cases of the 
singular. 
3 -a (usually short) in the nom. singular after any other letter changes to η in the 
gen. and dat. only. 
4 All first declension nouns have plural endings -αι, -ών, -αις, -άς. 
5 The vocative of first declension feminine nouns is the same as the nominative. 
Masculine nouns ending in -της and -άς have vocative singulars in -τα and -ά 
respectively, e.g. κριτά, νεάνίά. Proper nouns ending^in -άδης and -ίδης have 
vocatives in -άδη and -ίδη, e.g. Μιλτιάδη. The vocative plural is always identical 
with the nominative plural. 
6 Most first declension nouns are feminine. Masculine nouns are obvious from their 
meaning and from the special form of their nom. and gen. singular.

Note 
1 Vocatives of second declension masculine nouns ending in -ος have the ending 
-ε in the singular, e.g. ώ άνθρωπε. 
2 In neuter nouns, the nominative, vocative and accusative are always the same and 
in the plural they end in -a. 
3 Be careful to distinguish second declension nouns in -ος from third declension 
neuter nouns such as γένος (race), όρος (mountain), τείχος (wall), etc.

Note 
1 In order to identify the stem of nouns of the third declension with consonant 
stems, it is important to learn their genitive singular. The stem can be found by 
taking off the final -ος of the genitive; and the following endings are added to the 
stem: in the singular, gen. -ος, dat. -i, acc. -a; in the plural, nom. -ες, gen. -ων, 
dat. -σι (see next note), acc. -ας; neuter pi. nom. & acc. -a. 
2 To accommodate the -σι ending of the dative plural, changes often have to be 
made for reasons of euphony. So from έρως, έρωτος (love) we have dat. pi. έ'ρωσι 
(τ is omitted); and from λέων, λέοντος (lion) we have dat. pi. λέουσι 
(for λέοντσι, cf. γέρων, γέρουσι). 
3 Note that the endings of γέρων are identical with the masculine forms of the 
present participle (see p. 38). 
4 Vocative singulars (where different from the nominative): γέρον, άνερ, πάτερ, 
μήτερ, βήτορ, γύναι, Ζευ. Note the vowel shortening. 
5 Note how πατήρ (and μήτηρ (mother) and θυγάτηρ (daughter)) have an epsilon 
before the ρ of their stem in the acc. singular and nom., gen. and acc. plural, but 
not in the gen. or dat. singular or the dat. plural. 
6 Like έλπίς goes πούς, m. (foot): πούς, ποδός, ποδί, πόδα; ποδές, ποδών, 
ποσί(ν), ποδάς. 
7 (a) Ζεύς is classified as a noun with a consonant stem because originally there 
was a consonant called a digamma (p) after the ε. This letter, pronounced like w, 
dropped out of the Attic alphabet. 
(b) The following forms of Ζεύς are frequently met in tragedy: Ζην-ός (gen.), 
Ζην-ί (dat.), Ζήν-α (acc.).

1 γένος and τριήρης observe the rules of contraction. The uncontracted endings are 
given in brackets but are not used in Attic. 
2 It is extremely important to distinguish between the third declension neuter nouns 
ending in -ος and the second declension masculine nouns with the same ending. 
3 Vocative singulars (where different from the nominative): πόλι, βασιλεύ, βοϋ, 
ναΰ, υίέ, Δημόσθενες. 
4 With the declension of Demosthenes compare: Περικλής (Pericles), gen. 
Περικλέους, dat. Περικλεϊ, acc. Περικλέά, voc. Περίκλεις. Σωκράτης (Socrates) 
declines like Δημοσθένης. 
Distinguish between these -ης names and the first declension names ending in 
-άδης and -ίδης. See p. 25, note 5. 
5 With the declension of ναύς compare: γραύς, f. (old woman), singular: gen. γράός, 
dat. γράΐ, acc. γραύν, voc. γραύ; plural: nom. γράες, gen. γράών, dat. γραυσί(ν), 
acc. γραύς, voc. γραες. 
6 Note: 
αΙδώς, f. (shame), singular: gen. αΐδούς, dat. αίδοϊ, acc. αΙδώ, voc. αΙδώς. 
πειθώ, f. (persuasion), singular: gen. πειθούς, dat. πειθοί, acc. πειθώ, voc. πειθοϊ. 
ήρως, m. (hero), singular: gen. ήρωος, dat. ήρωϊ or ή pep, acc. ήρωα or ή ρω, voc. 
ήρως; plural: nom. ήρωες or ήρως, gen. ήρώων, dat. ήρωσι(ν), acc. ήρωας or 
ήρως, voc. ήρωες or ήρως. 
2ως, f. (dawn), follows the Attic declension (νεώς, p. 27) except that its accusative 
is έ'ω (not έων). The Ionic declension of ήώς, f. (dawn) will be met in Homer: gen. 
ήοϋς, dat. ήοΐ, acc. ήώ (like αίδώς).

Compound adjectives (i.e. adjectives beginning with a preposition or some other 
prefix, including ά(ν)- (not)) do not usually have a separate feminine ending, 
e.g. ά-λογος (irrational), έπί-σημος (remarkable), εΰ-ξενος (hospitable), καλλί-νΐκος 
(gloriously triumphant). They are called two-termination adjectives.

Comparison of adjectives 
The comparative ('more ...') is most commonly formed by adding -τερος, 
-τέρά, -τερον to the masculine stem. 
The superlative ('most...') is most commonly formed by adding -τατος, 
-τάτη, -τατον to the masculine stem. 
When the adjective ends in -ος, the vowel before -τερος and -τατος etc. is 
ο if the preceding syllable is heavy and ω if the preceding syllable is light. 
(A syllable is light if it contains a short vowel which is followed by no 
more than one consonant. Otherwise it is heavy.)1

But άρχαίος (ancient), άναγκαϊος (necessary), βέβαιος (firm), δίκαιος

άρχαιότερος, etc.

Adverbs 
The adverbial ending of most adjectives is -ως, and so adverbs are usually 
derived from adjectives by adding -ως to the stem. As a rule of thumb, the 
form of adverbs can be found by changing the -v of the genitive plural 
masculine to -ς, e.g. 
δικαίως 
justly 
ή δ έως 
sweetly 
πάντως 
wholly 
Note the following neuters (either singular or plural) used as adverbs: 
πολύ, πολλά 
μέγα, μεγάλα 
μόνον 
Note the following: 
μάλα 
σφόδρα 
τάχα 
άνω 
κάτω 
έγγύς 
εύ 
much 
greatly (also μεγάλως) 
only 
very 
very much, exceedingly 
quickly, perhaps 
above 
beneath, below 
near 
well 
Comparison of adverbs 
The comparative of an adverb is regularly the neuter acc. singular of the 
comparative adjective, and its superlative is the neuter acc. plural of the 
superlative adjective: 
Comparative 
Superlative 
σοφώς 
wisely 
ταχέως 
quickly 
Note also: 
μάλα 
much 
ευ 
well 
σοφώτερον more wisely σοφότατα most wisely 
θάττον more quickly 
τάχιστα very quickly 
μάλλον more 
άμεινον better 
μάλιστα very much 
άριστα very well 
0 
Remember the idiom ώς with the superlative (= as ~ as possible): 
ώς τάχιστα as quickly as possible.

When τίς is used in asking a question, it always has an accent on its first syllable, 
τις, the indefinite pronoun, is an enclitic and may or may not be accented, but it 
never has an accent on its first syllable (unless it gets it from another enclitic), and 
must follow another word. See p. 149. 

| Deictic pronouns 
The deictic pronouns ούτος, όδε (i.e. δ + δε) and έκεΐνος, like αυτός and 
άλλος, follow the definite article (see p. 24) and the relative pronoun (p. 
50) in having the ending -o (not -ov) in the nom. and acc. neuter singular.

2 Cardinal numbers from 5 to 199 are indeclinable, except that in compound 
numbers (see below) είς, δύο, τρεις and τέτταρες are declined if they occur as 
distinct words; hundreds .and thousands decline like the plural of φίλιος. Ordinals 
decline in full like σοφός, except δεύτερος which declines like φίλιος, because of 
its ρ before the -ος (see p. 32). 
3 In compound numbers, the smaller and the larger number can come either way 
around if they are linked with καί. Thus 24 can be εϊκοσι και τέτταρες or 
τέτταρες καί εϊκοσι (as in 'four-and-twenty'). If καί is not used, the larger 
number comes first: είκοσι τέτταρες (as in 'twenty-four'). 
0 
μύριοι means 'countless' or 'infinite' when accented in this way 
(cf. μύριοι = 10,000). It is found with this meaning in the singular 
(μΰρίος -ά -ov).

Note 
1 In compound verbs, διά adds the meaning of either 'thoroughly' or 'right through' 
or 'parting'. 
2 In compound verbs, μετά tends to add the meaning of either 'after' ('follow after', 
'send after (= for)') or 'sharing' or 'changing'. 
3 In compound verbs, ύπό adds the meaning of either 'under' or 'gradually' or 'in 
an underhand way'. 
1 This word, both as a separate preposition and as part of a compound (e.g. συν-άγω 
(I bring together)) was spelt ξύν in old Attic, but σύν appeared in the fifth century 
BC and became usual towards the end of it. Thucydides is the only Attic prose writer 
who consistently uses the ξ. It is the usual spelling in tragedy. 

Verbs 
1 Most Greek verbs alter their endings according to a single pattern. 
We give the verb παύω (I stop), παύομαι (I cease) as our example of 
this. If you master this verb you will be able to understand and form 
any part of the vast majority of verbs. 
There are a significant number of irregular verbs and we give the most 
frequently used of these in the tables of grammar and in the lists of 
principal parts. We divide the principal parts into two sections. The 
'top 101' are the commonest and the effort of learning them will prove 
worthwhile. The second list can be used for reference. 
2 In the following tables, the numbers 1, 2 and 3 refer to persons. In 
the singular 1 is T, 2 is 'you' and 3 is 'he', 'she' or 'it'. In the plural, 
1 is 'we', 2 is 'you' and 3 is 'they'. For agreement of persons, see 7 on 
p. 219. 
3 There are three voices in Greek, active, middle and passive. The 
middle voice generally tells us that the subject performs an action 
upon himself or herself, or for personal benefit, e.g. παύω = I stop 
(something), παύομαι = I stop myself, i.e. I come to a stop, I cease. 
Sometimes, however, verbs have an active meaning but only middle 
(or middle and passive) forms, e.g. βούλομαι (I wish). We call such 
verbs deponent. If they do make use of passive as well as middle 
forms, the passive forms will usually be confined to the aorist. 
4 The middle and the passive have the same forms as each other except 
in the future and the aorist. We give only the future and aorist tenses 
under the middle in the tables, referring readers to the passive table 
for the other tenses. 
5 Almost all of the tenses we use when talking about Greek verbs are 
used in English grammar. But note the following: 
imperfect tense - this tense usually expresses continuous or repeated 
or incomplete action in the past, e.g. Ί was stopping ...'.It can also 
have the meaning of Ί tried to ...' (conative, from the Latin 'conor' 
(I try)). 

aorist tense - this tense simply tells us that a single event happened 
in the past, e.g. Ί did this'. It is often used with the force of the 
English pluperfect. 
Outside the aorist indicative and its participles (but see p.137), i.e. in 
imperatives, infinitives, subjunctives and optatives, the aorist does not 
tell us the time at which the action happened.1 It tells us that it was a 
single event, and the event can take place in the present and the 
future as well as the past. Thus έλθέ (aorist imperative) δεϋρο means 
'Come here (and be quick about it)!' The imperfect tense, which 
usually suggests that the action should be seen as a continuing 
process, makes a helpful contrast with this use of the aorist to convey 
a single crisp event. We refer to the distinction between ways of 
expressing events and actions as aspect. 
pluperfect tense - this tense is rarely used in subordinate time 
clauses. The aorist is preferred, e.g. έπει είσήλθομεν = when we had 
come in. The pluperfect is in fact rarely used altogether. 
future perfect tense - Ί shall have stopped', 'you will have stopped', 
etc. This tense is very rarely found. 
finite verb - a verb in a tense with a personal ending. 
indicative - this term tells us that a finite verb is not in the 
subjunctive, optative (see below) or imperative. It is usually making a 
statement or asking a question. 
the subjunctive and optative - the various uses of the subjunctive and 
optative will become increasingly evident as this grammar is studied. 
However, it is worth remarking that a mood which is certainly not the 
indicative is used in English. The following citations are taken from 
The Oxford English Grammar' (published in 1996): 
Israel insists that it remain in charge on the borders ... 
If they decide that it's necessary, then so be it. 
... you can teach him if need be. 
... more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored 
to their needs. 
He said Sony would not object even if Columbia were to make a movie 
critical of the late Emperor Hirohito. 
Words such as 'may', 'might', 'would', 'should' and 'could' can also 
be helpful when translating the Greek subjunctive and optative. 
1 However, note the use of the infinitive in indirect statement and the optative in 
indirect statement and indirect questions, both of them in 'the tense actually used' 
(see pp. 155 & 164).

1 All past indicatives add έ- as a prefix (the augment) except for the perfect, which 
reduplicates. (In fact, the perfect does not count as a past tense at all since it 
denotes a present state.) For details, see p. 67. 
2 Forms of the verb which are not indicative do not have an augment. 
3 There is no future subjunctive.

the future and aorist passive, e.g. λυω (I loose) - λυ-θήσομαι, έ-λύ-θην; πιστεύω (I

the following: 
I wish 
I beg 
I find pleasure in 
I remember 
I converse 
I think 
I fear

| The augment expressing time, and reduplication 
1 You can tell the past tenses of the indicative because, apart from the perfect (a 
special case since it is not really a past tense - see p. xiv), they all have an 
'augment' (= something added at the start) in all three voices: 
(a) If the verb begins with a consonant, this is the letter έ-, e.g. έ-παυον 
(imperfect), έ-παυσα (aorist). 
(b) If the verb begins with a vowel, the vowel will lengthen as follows: 
original vowel 
vowel with augment 
α 
η 
ςι, αι, ει 
η 
αυ, ευ 
ηυ 
ε 
η, rarely ει 
ι 
ϊ 
0 
ω 
οι 
ω 
υ 
0 
2 The augment is added to the uncompounded verb, not its prefix. Thus the aorist 
of άποπαύω (I stop) is άπ-έπαυσα (the augment dislodging the ο of άπο-). 
Compare: 
καταπέμπω 
aor. κατ-έπεμψα 
I send down 
έπιβουλεύω -> aor. έπ-εβούλευσα 
I plot against 
But note: 
έγκρύπτω -» aor. έν-έκρυψα 
I hide in 
έκπαιδεύω —> aor. έξ-επαίδευσα 
I educate 
περιβαίνω -> impf. περι-έβαινον 
I go around 
(the ι of περι 
remains) 
προβαίνω —> impf. προ-έβαινον or προϋβαινον I go forward 
3 (a) The perfect 'reduplicates' (see p. xv) if the verb begins with a consonant, 
making use of the vowel ε. Thus: 
παύω 
pf. πέ-παυκα 
I stop 
λυω -» pf. λέ-λυκα 
I release 
(W θ, φ, χ reduplicate with τ, π, κ, e.g., 
θυω -> pf. τέ-θυκα 
I sacrifice 
φεύγω 
pf. πέ-φευγα 
I flee 
χαίρω -» pf. κε-χάρηκα 
I rejoice 
(c) If the verb begins with a vowel, the same lengthening process is followed as 
with the augment (see 1 (b) above). 
4 The pluperfect both has an augment and reduplicates. When the pluperfect is 
formed from the perfect of a verb beginning with a vowel, no further change is 
made. 

| Forming the perfect passive 
The perfect passive of verbs with stems ending in vowels is formed like 
that of παύω (see p. 65), but when the stem ends in a consonant, almost all 
the regular endings have to be changed for reasons of sound. Study of the 
perfect passives of λείπω (I leave) and πράττω (I do) will indicate the 
nature of these changes: 
λείπω 
πράττω 
perfect passive (indicative) 
sg 1 
λέλειμμαι 
πέπράγμαι 
2 
λέλειψαι 
πέπράξαι 
3 
λέλειπται 
πέπράκται 
pi 1 
λελείμεθα 
πεπράγμεθα 
2 
λέλειφθε 
πέπράχθε 
3 
λελειμμένοι είσί(ν) 
πεπραγμένοι είσί(ν) 
Infinitive: λελεϊφθαι Participle: λελειμμένος Infinitive: πεπράχθαι Participle: πεπραγμένος 
0 
Where the forms of the perfect passive are made up of the perfect 
passive participle and a part of είμί (I am), the participle must agree 
in number and gender with the subject of the verb, e.g. 
αί γυναίκες λελειμμέναι είσίν. 
The women have been left behind. 

| Verbs with a 2nd aorist 
Many very common verbs which form all their other tenses regularly like 
παύω form those based on the aorist stem in a different way. This is the 
2nd aorist and is often distinguished by having an aorist stem which is 
shorter than the present stem. In the tables of principal parts, a verb which 
forms a 2nd aorist will have the ending -ov or -όμην in the aorist column. 
While the formation is different, the meaning is the same. Compare 
English, where the 'regular' past tense is formed with -ed, as 'walked* from 
'walk'. The Greek 2nd aorist can be compared with the past tense of verbs 
like 'sing' and 'run', where we find (with a vow£l change) 'sang* and 'ran'. 
Sometimes in both languages, a different stem is used in different tenses. 
For example, the aorist of αίρέω (I take) is είλον, from the stem έλ-. 
Cf. English 'go' beside 'went'. 
The forms are given in full below, but note that the endings are identical 
to those of the regular imperfect for the indicative and to those of the 
present for all the other forms. The aorist passive is formed from its own 
separate stem.

Note 
The accents on 2nd aorist verb forms can be different from those on other verbs. For 
the details, see 4 on p. 226. 

| Root aorists 
Some verbs form the aorist by just adding endings onto the root of the

βιόω 
έβίων

-διδράσκω

-έδϋν 
enter, put on 
Note: List continues on p. 72 

ϊστημι 
έστην 
aor. = I stood (intr.) 
σβέννϋμι 
έσβην 
extinguish 
φθάνω 
έφθην 
anticipate X (acc.) in doing, act or be first 
φύω 
έφϋν 
aor. = I am by nature (intr.) 
Some verbs have both regular and root aorists. In these cases the root aorist is 
always intransitive and the regular aorist is often transitive. For example, 
έ'φϋν 
έφϋσα 
I grew, I was by nature 
I grew, produced, made to grow 
έστην 
έστησα 
I stood, was standing 
I did set up, made stand (see p. 84) 
κατέδϋν 
κατ έδυσα 
I sank 
I made sink, caused to sink 
But φθάνω (I anticipate X (acc.) in doing, act or be first) is both transitive and 
intransitive in both its aorist forms (έφθην and έφθασα). And βιόω is intransitive 
in both of its aorist forms (έβίων and έβίωσα). 

| Contracted verbs 
Contracted verbs are verbs whose present stem ends in a vowel (-α-, -ε-, 
-ο-), e.g. τιμάω, φιλέω, δηλόω. 
In the present and imperfect (including the imperative, subjunctive, 
optative, infinitive and participle), this vowel coalesces with the vowel of 
the ending. We give these conjugations in full on the following pages. 
The following rules should be learnt: 
α verbs 
α followed by ε or η becomes ά. 
α followed by ο or ω becomes ω. 
ι is preserved but becomes subscript; υ disappears. 
ε verbs 
ε followed by ε becomes ει. 
ε followed by ο becomes ου. 
ε followed by a long vowel or diphthong disappears. 
ο verbs 
ο followed by a long vowel becomes ω. 
ο followed by a short vowel becomes ου. 
Any combination with ι becomes 01. 
N.B. The endings of contracted verbs follow those of παύω with the 
application of the above rules, except in the singular of the present optative 
active. 
From τιμάω, this is τΐμ-φην, τϊμ-φης, τϊμ-φη. 
From φιλέω, this is φιλ-οίην, φιλ-οίης, φιλ-οίη. 
From δηλόω, this is δηλ-οίην, δηλ-οίης δηλ-οίη.

Note 
1 Note that the present infinitive active of these verbs usually ends in -αν. The ι of 
the regular infinitive ending -ειν (originally -εεν) is not found in contracted verbs. 
2 Some α verbs (including ζάω (I live) and χράομαι (I use)) contract to η instead of 
ά when α is followed by ε or η, e.g. ζην (to live), χρήσθαι (to use).

1 When stems in ε are only one syllable long, e.g. πλέ-ω (I sail), δει (it is

Note 
1 The future tense of είμί is έ'σομαι and is formed regularly except for the 3 sg., 
which is έ'σται. 
2 The present indicative (except the 2 sg.) is enclitic. However, έστί is written έστι 
when it starts a sentence; possibly when it means 'he, she, it exists': and when it 
follows ούκ, μή, εΐ, ώς, καί, άλλά, τούτο. 
3 Distinguish carefully the indicative forms from those of είμι (I shall go); see p. 94. 
4 The alternative optative forms are only used in prose. Plato uses είμεν; είτε 
occurs only in poetry; είεν is used in prose and verse, and is more common than 
εΐησαν.

Note 
1 The 'present' indicative of this verb is future in meaning: for a true present tense, 
use έρχομαι (I go). In the subjunctive, the meaning is always future. In the 
optative, infinitive and participle, it may be either future or present. The aorist is 
ήλθον (I went), the perfect is έλήλυθα (I have come) and the pluperfect is 
έληλύθη, all of which are formed regularly. However, ήκω (I have come) and 
ήκον (I came) are frequently used for the perfect and pluperfect respectively. 
2 Whether such verbs in a given instance signify coming or going (arrival or 
departure) must be decided by the context.

Note 
1 This verb is perfect in form but present in meaning. Etymologically it is related to 
Latin video Ί see'. The perfect in Greek thus came to mean Ί know (that) ...' from 
Ί have seen that...'. 
2 The aorist of this root became the aorist for δράω (/ see): εΐδον.

Note 
1 The present participle of φάσκω (I say) is used instead of φάς in Attic prose: 
φάσκων, -ουσα, -ον. 
2 The imperfect of φάσκω is used for repeated assertion: έφασκον. 
3 The present indicative (except the 2 sg.) is enclitic. 
4 ού φημί means Ί say no, refuse, say ... not'. See p. 156. 

Tables of principal parts 
The list of verbs is divided into two groups. The first table contains the 
101 most common verbs, and is well worth learning. The second table is 
provided for reference. 
Note: 
• 
compound verbs are generally given without their prefix. The most 
common prefix is given in brackets. Note that, in general, prose prefers 
the compounded forms, whereas verse uses both compound forms and 
forms without a prefix. 
• 
a form beginning with a hyphen indicates that the verb is not found (or 
is rarely found) without a prefix in this tense or voice but that 
compounds of it are. 
• 
italics indicate forms which are rarely or never found in Attic prose. 
• 
where the word in the first column is deponent (i.e. middle in form but 
active in meaning) the forms given for the perfect middle/passive and 
aorist passive are also generally active in meaning.

Constructions 

I The definite article 
The hero was saved by a woman. 
In this sentence 'the* is the definite article and 'a' (written 'an' before a 
vowel) the indefinite article. Greek has no word for the indefinite article, 
though it often uses the indefinite pronoun τις (some, a certain) after the 
noun to perform the same function (see p. 149). It does, however, have a 
definite article: ό, ή, τό (for the full declension, see p. 24). 
Greek uses the definite article much as English does, but note the 
following points. They include a number of instances where the word 'the* 
must be omitted in translation into English: 
1 In English, the names of people and places almost never have the 
article, but in Greek, they very often do. It may well not be used the 
first time a name occurs. For example, Herodotus begins his history by 
declaring that it is the work Ηροδότου Άλικαρνησσέος (of Herodotus 
from Halicarnassus) and Thucydides says that Θουκυδίδης Αθηναίος 
ξυνέγραψε τόν πόλεμον (Thucydides the Athenian wrote the history of 
the war).1 But after a name has been mentioned once, subsequent 
uses generally need the article. 
With famous names, however, the article can be used on their first 
occurrence, e.g. ό των έπτά σοφότατος Σόλων (Solon, the wisest of 
the Seven (Sages), Plato, Timaeus 20d). 
2 Where English uses possessive adjectives (my, your, her, etc.) Greek 
employs the definite article unless there is doubt about the identity of 
the possessor: 
Κϋρός τε καταπηδήσάς άπό τοΟάρματος τόν θώρακα ένεδυετο. 
(Xenophon, Anabasis 1.8.3) 
And after leaping down from his chariot, Cyrus put on his breastplate. 
3 Abstract nouns are generally found with the article. Note therefore 
that ή άνδρείά must be translated as 'courage* and not 'the courage'. 
1 The supremely important king of Persia is referred to simply as βασιλεύς, without 
the article. 

The article can be used with adjectives functioning as nouns, e.g.: 
οί άνδρεΐοι 
brave men 
τό δίκαιον 
justice {literally, the just thing) 
The article can be used with participles, e.g.: 
ό βουλόμενος 
anyone who wishes, the first to volunteer 
ό έπιτυ ών 
ί ί 
t h e m a n w h o meets> 
, ,π 
, 
\\ i- e· t h e first man one meets, the man in 
δέντυχων 
J [ the street 
' 
τά γεγενημένα 
the things that have occurred, events 
οί άληθή λέγοντες 
those speaking the truth, those who speak the 
truth 
The article with the participle is frequently found with the meaning of 
a relative clause. See p. 138. 
The article is used with nouns or adjectives which describe whole 
classes. We call this usage generic: 
ό άνθρωπος 
ί r a man, men, mankind (as opposed to other 
οί άνθρωποι 
r \ living creatures) 
αί γυναίκες 
women 
οί γέροντες 
old people 
οί σοφοί 
the wise 
The article can be used with adverbs or adverbial phrases and without 
nouns in such expressions as: 
οί έκεΐ 
the people there 
οί ένθάδε 
the people here 
οί νυν 
people nowadays 
οί πάλαι 
people in the old days 
οί τότε 
people then 
οί έν ήλικίςι 
those in the prime of life 
οί έν τελεί 
the people in authority 
ό δέ, ή δέ, τό δέ and/but he, and/but she, and/but it 
Here the article refers back to a noun in a previous clause which was 
not the subject of that clause: 
Ίνάρως ... Αθηναίους έπηγάγετο. οί δέ ... ήλθον. (Thucydides 
1.104.1-2) 
Inaros invited the Athenians; and they came. 

9 ό μέν ... ό δέ this one ... and (or but) that one ... 
οί μέν ... οί δέ some ... others 
... ού πάσας χρή τάς δόξας τών άνθρώπων τϊμάν, άλλα τάς μέν, τάς δ' 
οϋ; (Plato, Crito 47a) 
... so one shouldn't respect all the opinions of men, but (only) some 
and not others? 
Note also: 
τό μέν ... τό δέ 
on the one hand ... and on the other hand ... 
10 The neuter singular of the definite article (τό) with the infinitive 
creates a verbal noun (also called a gerund). In English, the verbal 
noun ends in '-ing', or the infinitive can be used. Examples are: 
Communicating (or to communicate) is difficult. 
I like walking (or to walk). 
τό πράττειν 
accomplishing, to accomplish 
τό τούτο πράττειν 
accomplishing this 
The subject of the infinitive, if expressed at all, is in the accusative: 
τό έμέ τούτο πράττειν 
my accomplishing this 
This verbal noun declines: 
nom. τό πράττειν 
gen. 
του πράττειν 
dat. 
τω πράττειν 
acc. 
τό πράττειν 
Negative μή. 
τω μή τούτο πράττειν 
by not accomplishing this, by 
failing to accomplish this, through 
failure to accomplish this 
11 The original use of the definite article as a deictic pronoun (see p. ix) 
is frequently met in Homer and Herodotus: 
τήν δ' έγώ ού λυσω. (Homer, Iliad 1.29) 
But her I will not release. 
12 In Homer, forms identical with the article are used as the relative 
pronoun (see p. 227): 
πυρά πολλά τά καίετο (Homer, Iliad 10.12) 
many fires which were burning ... 

This is found in Herodotus and tragedy too: 
κτείνουσα τους ού χρή κτανείν (Euripides, Andromache 810) 
killing those whom it is not right to kill 
We never find this relative form in Attic prose or comedy. 
| The definite article and word order 
1 Adjectives or adjectival phrases normally come between the article 
and the noun or (less commonly) after the noun with the article 
repeated. We call these positions attributive: 
ή σοφή γυνή or ή γυνή ή σοφή 
the wise woman 
οί έν άστει κεραμείς or οί κεραμείς οί έν άστει 
the potters in the city 
ό δεινός λεγόμενος γεωργός (Xenophon, Oeconomicus 19.14) 
the man who is called a skilful farmer 
Cf. ή της μητρός οικία (the mother's house): ή οίκία της μητρός is 
less common. 
The genitive of deictic and reflexive pronouns (e.g. ταύτης, έκείνου, 
τούδε, σεαυτοϋ, έαυτού) takes the attributive position: 
άπέκτεινεν έαυτόν τφ έαυτού ξίφει. 
He killed himself with his own sword. 
See also 3 on p. 147. 
2 If the adjective is not in this position, i.e. stands outside the article 
and noun, the verb 'to be' will be understood in some way, e.g. 
ή γυνή σοφή 
The woman (is) clever. 
άθάνατον τήν περι αύτών μνήμην καταλείψουσιν. (Isocrates 1.9.3) 
They will leave behind a memory of themselves (that will be) 
immortal. 
We call this the predicative position. 

A noun without the article can be used in this way, e.g. 
στρατηγός ό "Ιων 
Ion (is) a general. 
0 
The following words will be found in the predicative position, i.e. 
either before the article or after the noun: 
ούτος 
this — e.g. ούτος ό παις 
or ό παις ούτος = this child 
δδε 
έκείνος 
έκαστος 
έκάτερος 
this 
that 
each 
άμφω/άμφότεροι 
each of two 
both 
πάς, άπας, σύμπάς 
all, each and every (used attributively, it 
means 'as a whole', e.g. οί πάντες πολϊται 
= the whole body of citizens)

Relative clauses 
This is the man who betrayed me. 
I am the man whom she betrayed. 
There is the woman for whom he left me. 
That is the relationship that she preferred. 
The relative pronoun (who, which, whom, whose, that) is one of the few 
English words which can change according to its function in the sentence. 
Note, however, that in English the word 'whom' is now used very little. 
The second of the above sentences could be rewritten: 
I am the woman (who/that) he betrayed. 
As you can see, the word 'who', 'whom' or 'that' may be omitted. 
The relative pronoun refers back to a noun or pronoun, in the above 
sentences 'man', 'woman', 'woman' and 'relationship' respectively. We call 
this word the antecedent. 
In Greek, the most common word for 'who' is ός, ή, δ (see p. 50 — after 
the nominative singular and plural, this is the same as the definite article 
without the τ).1 It agrees in gender and number with its antecedent, but its 
case depends on its function in the relative clause which it introduces. 
εΐδον τους άνδρας οϊ άφίκοντο. 
I saw the men who arrived. 
άπέκτεινα τους άνδρας ους είδες. 
I killed the men (whom) you saw. 
In the first sentence, οϊ is masculine and plural because it agrees with its 
antecedent τούς άνδρας in gender and number. It is nominative because it 
is the subject of the verb άφίκοντο. 
In the second sentence, ους is masculine and plural because it agrees 
with its antecedent τους άνδρας in gender and number. It is accusative 
1 ή, οί and αί do not have accents when they are the definite articles, but do have 
them (ή, οϊ and αϊ) when they are relative pronouns. 

not because τους άνδρας is accusative, but because it is the object of the 
verb είδες. 
If you are translating from English into Greek, you can discover the case 
that the relative pronoun should be in by phrasing the English relative 
clause as a full sentence. In the second sentence above, you can change 
'whom you saw' to 'You saw them (the men)'. In this sentence, 'the men' 
would be accusative in Greek, and so they will also be accusative in the 
corresponding relative clause. The Greek for 'the men' is masculine and 
plural. Hence ους. 
αϋτη έστιν ή γυνή ήν έζητοϋμεν. 
This is the woman whom we were looking for. 
ον γάρ θεοί φιλοϋσιν άποθνήσκει νέος. (Menander, Sententiae 425) 
For he whom the gods love dies young. 
Notice how the antecedent has to be understood in this example (i.e. it is 
not given in the Greek). 
Four more relative pronouns 
• 
δσπερ, ήπερ, δπερ is especially definite: 
ταύτόν μοι έδοξαν έχειν άμάρτημα δπερ και οί ποιηταί. (Plato, 
Apology 22d) 
They seemed to me to be making exactly the same mistake as the 
poets. 
• 
δστις, ήτις, δτι when used as a relative is generalized, i.e. it does not 
refer to a specific person: 
άνελεύθερος πάς δστις εις δόξαν βλέπει. (Cleanthes, a Stoic 
philosopher) 
Every man who looks to fame is unfree. 
• 
οΐος, -ά, -ον (of the kind that) and δσος, -η, -ον (sg. as much as, pi. as 
many as) are commonly used. See p. 51. 
| Attraction of the relative 
A relative pronoun which would be in the accusative is frequently attracted 
into the case of the antecedent if that antecedent is in the genitive or 
dative. 

Μήδων μέντοι όσων [for δσους) έώράκα ... πολύ ούτος ό έμός πάππος 
κάλλιστος. (Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 1.3.2) 
However, of all the Medes that I have seen ... this man, my 
grandfather, is by far the most handsome. 
έπαινώ σε έφ' οίς [for έπί τούτοις ά) λέγεις. (Xenophon, Anabasis 
1.3.45) 
I praise you for what you say. 
Note how the antecedent is omitted in the above sentence. This is usual 
when the relative is attracted into the case of a deictic pronoun (see p. ix). 
Cf. Milton, Paradise Lost 6.808: 'Vengeance is his, or whose he sole 
appoints/ Here 'whose' stands for 'that of the individual whom'. 
Attraction of the relative is by no means inevitable. It happens with ός, 
οίος and όσος, but not όστις. 
0 
In translating όσος in the plural, it is likely that you will find yourself 
including the word 'all', as in the first example above. 
N.B. The article with the participle is frequently found with the meaning of 
a relative clause. See 5 on p. 123. 
άλλ', οϊμαι, οί τιθέμενοι τούς νόμους οί άσθενεις άνθρωποι εισιν και 
οί πολλοί. (Plato, Gorgias 483b) 
But, I think, those who enact the laws are the weak men and the mass 
of the people. 
Here οί τιθέμενοι τούς νόμους is a participial phrase which could also have 
been expressed by a relative clause, i.e. έκείνοι οϊ τίθενται τούς νόμους.

Time, place and space | 
| Time 
• 
In Greek, the accusative expresses time how long: 
αί δέ σπονδαι ένιαυτόν έσονται. (Thucydides 4.118.10) 
And the truce will be for a year. 
έτη γεγονώς έβδομήκοντα (Plato, Apology 17d) 
born for seventy years, i.e. seventy years old [The life is seventy years 
long.] 
With an ordinal number, the accusative expresses how long since: 
έβδόμην ... ήμέράν της θυγατρός αύτφτετελευτηκυίάς. (Aeschines 
3.77) 
After his daughter had died six days before (this being the seventh 
(έβδόμην) day of the duration of her death). 
• 
The genitive expresses time within which: 
νυκτός 
in the course of the night 
χειμώνος 
in the course of the winter 
• 
The dative expresses time when: 
τή ύστεραίςι 
on the next day 
τραγφδοΐς καινοΐς 
at the presentation of the new tragedies 
(from an inscription) 
έν is often found before the dative, especially in prose, e.g. 
έν οΰτως όλίγφ χρόνφ 
in so brief a time 
Some expressions of time: 
ϋμ' ήμέρ$ 
at daybreak 
άμα (τή) έω

| Place 
In Greek, prepositions are generally used to indicate place: 
• 
motion towards involves prepositions followed by the accusative: 
προς το άστυ 
towards/to the city 
είς τό άστυ 
into the city 
ώς Φαρνάβαζον 
to Pharnabazus (the preposition ώς is used 
with people only, not places) 
• 
motion away from involves prepositions followed by the genitive: 
άπό του άστεως 
away from the city 
έκ του άστεως 
out of the city 
παρά βασιλέως 
from the Persian king (παρά is commonly 
used with people) 

• 
place where commonly involves prepositions followed by the dative: 
έν τή πόλει 
in the city 
πρός τω άστει 
near or at the city 
But in poetry the dative is used without έν, and in prose place names 
can be found both with and without έν. Plato has an example of both 
alongside each other: 
των τε Μαραθώνι μαχεσαμένων και των έν Σαλαμινι ναυμαχησάντων 
(Plato, Menexenus 241b) 
both those who fought at Marathon and were in the sea battle at 
Salamis 
0 
While the dative, with or without έν, generally expresses place where, 
an older dative plural ending survives for the first declension which is 
also used with this meaning. This ends in -άσι or -ησι (compare 
Πλαταιάσι (at Plataea) with the later dative Πλαταιαΐς). In addition a 
small number of fossilized examples of the old locative (the case 
which expresses place where) survive, e.g. οϊκοι and χαμαί (see 
below). For the sake of convenience, we classify all of these as 
locatives. 
Note the following: 
• the locative: 
οϊκοι 
at home (but beware of ποϊ (= to where)) 
χαμαί 
on the ground 
Άθήνησι 
at Athens 
Πλαταιάσι 
at Plataea 
• the suffix -θεν indicates place from where: 
πανταχόθεν 
from every side 
Άθήνηθεν 
from Athens 
οϊκοθεν 
from home 
• the suffix -δε or -σε indicates place to where: 
πανταχόσε 
in every direction 
Άθήναζε 
to Athens 
οΐκαδε 
to home, homewards 
Why the ζ in Άθήναζε? Because the suffix -δε is being added to the 
accusative Αθήνας and the combination σδ is naturally written with a 
zeta (see p. 1). 

Some place words: 
Άθήνησι 
at Athens 
άλλοθι

| Space 
• 
the accusative expresses extent of space: 
άπέχει τό άστυ τρία στάδια. 
The town is three stades away. 
έξελαύνει διά της Λϋδίάς σταθμούς τρεις, παρασάγγας είκοσι και δύο. 
(Xenophon, Anabasis 1.2.5) 
He advances the length of three days' marches, twenty-two parasangs, 
through Lydia. 
• 
τό μήκος in length 
τό εΰρος in breadth 
τό ϋψος in height 
Greek generally uses a genitive of the measurement with an accusative 
of respect (e.g. in length, breadth, etc.). The article is included with the 
accusative of respect: 
τείχος όκτώ σταδίων τό μήκος 
a wall eight stades long (literally, in length)

Participles 
I ran away from the collapsing house. 
Newly rebuilt, the house will last a hundred years. 
Hanging in the art gallery, I saw the picture. 
Participles are verbal adjectives, i.e. they are formed from verbs and so 
describe an action, but they are adjectives and so in Greek almost always 
agree with a noun or pronoun. If you think about the ambiguity in the 
third sentence above, you will see that English indicates agreement through 
the order of the words. In Greek agreement is indicated through the case, 
gender and number of the agreeing words. 
• 
The present participle describes an action going on at the same time as 
the main verb: 
ταύτα έπραττε στρατηγών. 
He did this while he was general. 
• 
The future participle unsurprisingly looks forward in time. It is likely 
to express purpose, often in conjunction with ώς: 
συλλαμβάνει Κύρον ώς άποκτενών. (Xenophon, Anabasis 1.1.3) 
He arrests Cyrus in order to put him to death. 
After verbs of motion ώς is frequently omitted: 
ό δ' άνήρ αυτής λαγώς φχετο θηράσων. (Xenophon, Anabasis 4.5.24) 
But her husband had gone to hunt hares. 
• 
The aorist participle usually communicates an action which has 
occurred before the action of the main verb: 
δειπνήσάς έχώρει. (Thucydides 3.112.2) 
After having his dinner, he went off. 

But note: 
έπομόσάς έφη ... 
he said on oath ... 
γελάσας έφη ... 
he said with a laugh ... 
In these two cases he will have respectively sworn and laughed before 
he started speaking, but the actions of the participles presumably 
continued while he spoke. In the first example, his words were the 
expression of his oath; in the second, they were accompanied by 
laughter. 
• 
The perfect participle communicates a present state which has resulted 
from a past event, e.g. 
οί τεθνηκότες 
those who have died, i.e. the dead 
| More uses of the participle 
Note the following uses of the participle: 
causal - (a) with άτε, οία or οΐον (inasmuch as, seeing that) 
άτε, οία and οΐον are used when the writer advances the cause as a 
fact: 
ήκομεν τή προτεραίςι έσπέράς έκ Ποτίδαιας άπό του στρατοπέδου, 
οΐον δέ διά χρόνου άφΐγμένος άσμένως fja έπι τάς συνήθεις 
διατριβάς. (Plato, Charmides 153a) 
We had come in the evening of the day before from the camp in 
Potideia and, inasmuch as I had arrived after a long absence, I went 
with pleasure to my usual haunts. 
- (b) with ώς (on the grounds that) 
ώς implies that the cause is the thought or statement of the main verb 
without suggesting that it is also the idea of the writer: 
τόν ... Περικλέά έν αίτίςι εϊχον ώς πείσαντα σφας πολεμείν καί δι' 
έκείνον ταίς συμφοραΐς περιπεπτωκότες. (Thucydides 2.59.2) 
They kept blaming Pericles on the grounds that he had persuaded 
them to make war and that it was through him that they had fallen 
into disaster. 
The negative in both these causal uses is ού. 

'although* = καίπερ 
έποικτίρω δέ νιν ... καίπερ όντα δυσμενή. (Sophocles, Ajax 121-2) 
But I pity him, although he is my enemy. 
Negative ού. 
comparison - with ώσπερ (as, as if) 
ώρχούντο ... ώσπερ άλλοις έπιδεικνύμενοι. (Xenophon, Anabasis 
5.4.34) 
They danced as if they were showing off to others. 
Negative ού. 
conditional 
σύ δέ κλύων εΐσει τάχα. (Aristophanes, Birds 1390) 
If you listen, you will find soon out. 
Here κλύων could be expanded to έάν κλύης (see pp. 184-5). 
Negative μή. If μή is used with the participle, it is likely to have this 
conditional force: 
ούκ άν δύναιο μή καμών εύδαιμονεΐν. (Euripides, fragment 461.1) 
You couldn't be happy unless you were to work. 
Here μή καμών could be expanded to εί μή κάμοις. 
'with' - note the following participles which are frequent equivalents to 
the English word 'with': 
έχων 
having 
άγων 
leading, bringing 
φέρων 
carrying, bringing 
(mainly with inanimate objects) 
λαβών 
having taken 
χρώμενος (+ dat.) 
using 
έχων στρατιάν άφικνεΐται. (Thucydides 4.30.2) 
He arrives with (literally, having) an army. 
βοή τε χρώμενοι (Thucydides 2.84.3) 
and with (literally, using) a shout 
with the article - note pp. 123 & 129. 
Study the following sentence: 
οί Αθηναίοι οί έν τή πόλει δντες καταφρονούσι τών τούς άγρούς 
οίκούντων. 
The Athenians who are in the city despise those who live in the 
country.

φονέά του παιδός έλάνθανε βόσκων. 
(Herodotus 1.44) 
He didn't realize he was entertaining 
his son's murderer.

(Plato, Republic 375c) 
They will do this themselves first. 
έφθασε τον φίλον τρέχων.

διατελεί μισών. 
He continues to hate (or hating). 
έπτά γαρ ήμέράς ... μαχόμενοι

Anabasis 4.3.2) 
For they continued fighting for seven 
days. 
άρξομαι δέ άπο τής Ιατρικής λέγων. 
(Plato, Symposium 186b) 
But I shall begin by talking about 
medicine. 
παύσαι λέγουσα. 
(Euripides, Hippolytus 706) 
Stop talking! 
ούκ άνέξομαι ζώσα. 
(Euripides, Hippolytus 354) 
I shall not hold out and live on 
{literally, endure living). 
1 This can also mean: 'He was actually there.' 
2 άρχομαι λέγειν means simply Ί begin to speak'. 

φαίνομαι 
I am obviously 
φαίνεται τάληθή λέγων. 
He is evidently speaking the truth. 
0 
With φαίνομαι + the participle, appearance and reality coincide. As 
in English, the use of the infinitive suggests that the appearance may 
be false: 
φαίνεται τάληθή λέγειν. 
He appears to be speaking the truth (but may not be).

μετεμέλοντο τάς σπονδάς ού 
δεξάμενοι. (Thucydides 4.27.3) 
They were sorry they had not 
accepted the truce. 
| Genitive absolute 
In all the examples above, the participles have agreed with the subject or 
object of a verb. They could also have agreed with a noun or pronoun 
which forms some other part of the clause it belongs to, as in this 
sentence: 
Άθήναζε είμι μετά σου, φιλτάτης οϋσης. 
I shall go to Athens with you, (being) my dearest friend. 

Often, however, the participial phrase (i.e. the noun + the participle) is 
independent of the structure of the rest of the sentence: 
και ταυτ' έπράχθη Κόνωνος ... στρατηγουντος. (Isocrates 9.56) 
And these things were done while Conon was general. 
(literally, These things were done, Conon being the general.) 
Here, στρατηγοϋντος agrees with Κόνωνος, who is neither the subject nor 
the object of the main verb. His name is independent of the clause in 
which it sits. Compare: 
τούτων λεχθέντων άνέστησαν. (Xenophon, Anabasis 3.3.1) 
After these things had been said (literally; these things having been 
said), they got up. 
The technical term for this is absolute (from the Latin word for 'loosed 
from' or 'set free from\ i.e. 'independent'). In phrases such as this, both 
noun and participle are in the genitive case. 
Κύρος ... άνέβη έπι τά όρη ούδενός κωλυοντος. (Xenophon, 
Anabasis 1.2.22) 
Cyrus went up to the mountains without opposition (literally, no one 
hindering). 
| Accusative absolute 
Where the participle has no subject, i.e. with impersonal verbs (see 
pp. 190-1), the accusative absolute is used in place of the genitive 
absolute: 
it being necessary 
| it being possible 
it being fitting 
there being a share 
it being a matter of regret 
it being in one's power 
an opportunity having presented itself 
since it was resolved 
since it has been stated or told 
it being unclear 
δέον 
έξόν 
παρόν 
προσήκον 
μετόν 
μεταμέλον 
παρέχον 
παρασχόν 
δόξαν 
είρημένον 
άδηλον όν 

δυνατόν όν 
άδύνατον όν 
αίσχρόν όν 
καλόν όν 
it being possible 
it being impossible 
it being shameful 
it being fine or honourable 
For more information on the impersonal verbs, see pp. 190-1. 
τί δή, υμάς έξόν άπολέσαι, ούκ έπι τούτο ήλθομεν; (Xenophon, 
Anabasis 2.5.22) 
Why indeed, when it was possible for us to destroy you, did we not 
proceed to do it? 
μετεμέλοντό τε ότι μετά τά έν Πύλω, καλώς παρασχόν, ού ξυνέβησαν. 
(Thucydides 5.14.2) 
And they regretted that after what had occurred at Pylos, when a 
favourable opportunity had presented itself, they had not come to 
terms. 
Note that words such as άτε, ώς and καίπερ (see pp. 137-8) can be used in 
conjunction with the accusative absolute.

Pronouns 
1 I Deictic pronouns 
ούτος, αϋτη, τούτο this 
(see p. 49) 
έκείνος, έκείνη, έκεΐνο that (there) 
(see p. 49) 
δδε, ήδε, τόδε this (here) 
(see p. 49) [δδε is often used in tragedy to refer to the speaker] 
In prose, these pronouns are regularly used with the definite article, and 
are placed outside the article and the noun, i.e in the predicative position 
(see pp. 125-6): 
αϋτη ή γυνή 
δ άνήρ έκείνος 
this woman 
that man 
Since these pronouns point to what they describe, they are called deictic 
(from δείκνϋμι (I show)). 
δδε and its adverb ώδε (thus) usually point forward to what follows: 
τάδε εΐπεν. 
He spoke as follows. 
ούτος points to something near or something just mentioned, έκεϊνος to 
something further away. Thus έκεΐνος can mean 'the former' and ούτος 
can mean 'the latter', e.g. 
άλλ' έκεΐνος μέν σκληφρός, ούτος δέ προφερής και καλός και άγαθός 
την δψιν. (Plato, Euthydemus 271b) 
But the former is without grace while the latter is well-developed, 
handsome and good-looking. 
'-ί' can be added to ούτος in all its forms for emphasis, e.g. ούτοσί (this 
man here). 

Other deictic pronouns are: 
τοιόσδε, τοιάδε, τοιόνδε

(Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 5.2.31) 
And after hearing such words from Gobryas, Cyrus addressed him as 
follows. 
Study the declension of αύτός on p. 46. It is important to distinguish it 
from ούτος (p. 49), especially in the feminine nominative singular and 
plural: 
f. nom. sg. 
f. nom. pi. 
αύτός —> 
αύτή 
αύταί 
ούτος —> 
αϋτη 
αύται 
• 
ούτος and sometimes έκεΐνος can be used to mean 'well-known': 
Γοργίας ούτος 
έκεΐνος Θουκυδίδης 
the celebrated Gorgias 
that famous Thucydides 
τούτους τούς σΰκοφάντάς (Plato, Crito 45a) 
these infamous informers (they are not actually present, though the 
article is used) 
• 
Note the exclamatory use of ούτος: 
ούτος, τί ποιείς; (Aristophanes, Frogs 198) 
You there, what are you doing? 
Cf. τούτ' έκεϊνο. (Aristophanes, Acharnians 41) 
That's it! (iliterally, That's what this (is)!) 

2 | αύτός αύτή αύτό 
αύτός (see p. 46) has three different meanings, depending on how it is used: 
1 In the accusative, genitive and dative, αύτός means 'him', 'her', 'it' or 
'them': 
έρώ αύτής 
άπέκτεινα αύτόν 
I love her 
I killed him 
N.B. With this meaning, it is a pronoun and never appears in the 
nominative. Unless emphatic, it does not stand at the beginning of a 
sentence. 
2 Standing by itself or outside the article and the noun, αύτός means 
'self: 
ταύτα έποιεΐτε αύτοί 
you were doing these things yourselves 
αύτός ό στρατηγός 
the general himself 
ή γυνή αύτή 
the woman herself1 
For this meaning, the article is not necessary, as with names, e.g. 
Θουκυδίδης αύτός 
Thucydides himself 
Note the use of αύτός with ordinal numbers, e.g. 
τρίτος αύτός 
himself the third (i.e., with two others) 
πέμπτος αύτός 
himself the fifth (i.e., with four others) 
αύτός is always the chief person. 
3 When it is preceded by the definite article, αύτός means 'the same': 
ή αύτή γυνή 
ταύτά (= τά αύτά) 
the same woman 
the same things1 
For this meaning, the article is necessary. 
1 Note how in these usages the word order is the same in Greek and English. 

0 
αύτοϊς X = 'X and all' 
A common Greek idiom using αυτός in the dative plural (usually 
without the article) suggests inclusive accompaniment (see p. 20): 
μίαν τούτων [των νεών] αύτοΐς άνδράσιν (Thucydides 4.14.1) 
one of these ships with all its crew (with its men and all) 
είπεν ... ήκειν είς τάς τάξεις αύτοίς στεφάνοις. (Xenophon, 
Education of Cyrus 3.3.40) 
He told them to come to their posts, crowns and all. 
3 | Personal pronouns and their adjectives 
These are given on p. 46. 
The adjectives generally come after the article, the pronouns generally after 
the article + noun group, e.g. 
ή σή μήτηρ 
αύτοϋ, αύτής, αύτοϋ (ρΐ. αύτών) his, her, its (pi. their) (literally; of him, 
etc.) come outside the article and noun: 
δρω τον φίλον αύτοϋ (αύτής). 
I see his (her) friend. 
γιγνώσκων αύτοϋ την άνδρείάν (Plato, Protagoras 310d) 
knowing his courage 
ή μήτηρ ή σή 
ή μήτηρ σοϋ 
ή πατρίς ήμών 
our country 

4 | Reflexive pronouns 
These are given on p. 47.2 They refer back to the subject of their sentence 
or clause. 
γνώθι σεαυτόν. 
Know thyself. 
δίδωμί σοι έμαυτόν δοϋλον. (Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 4.6.2) 
I give myself to you as a slave. 
Όρέστης ... έπεισεν Αθηναίους έαυτόν κατάγειν. (Thucydides 
1.111.1) 
Orestes persuaded the Athenians to restore him. 
In the last example the reflexive pronoun refers back to the subject not of 
its own clause (έαυτόν κατάγειν) but to that of the main clause. We call 
reflexive pronouns used in this way indirect reflexives. Cf. 
Philip gave Olympias the crown which the Macedonians had given to 
him. 
• 
Note the following reflexive forms: 
singular 
dat. 
οί 
to himself, herself, itself 
plural 
gen. 
σφών 
of themselves 
ι 
dat. 
σφίσι(ν) 
to themselves 
[ often joined with αυτών, etc. 
acc. 
σφάς 
themselves 
J 
ήρώτά ... αυτήν εί έθελήσοι διακονήσαί οί. (Antiphon 1.16) 
He asked her if she would be willing to do him a service. 
έλεξαν ότι πέμψειε σφάς ό 'Ινδών βασιλεύς. (Xenophon, Education 
of Cyrus 2.4.7) 
They said that the king of the Indians had sent them. 
κελεύουσι γάρ ήμάς κοινή μετά σφών καί μετά Κορινθίων πολεμεΐν. 
(Andocides 3.27) 
For they urge us to make war in common with them and the 
Corinthians. 
2 See also the description of the middle voice on pp. xii & 60. 

In Attic prose these reflexive forms are generally used as indirect 
reflexives. In Homer, Herodotus and the Attic poets, they are generally 
simply personal pronouns, though they may be reflexives: 
αύτίκα δέ οί εϋδοντι έπέστη δνειρος. (Herodotus 1.34) 
and very soon a dream came to him in his sleep (literally; to him 
sleeping). 
0 
The genitive of reflexive pronouns as well as of deictic pronouns takes 
the attributive position (see p. 125) when it is possessive: 
άπέκτεινεν έαυτόν τφ έαυτού ξίφει. 
He killed himself with his own sword. 
τις, τι (some one; any, some; a certain, a, an) is an enclitic, i.e. it will, if 
possible, put its accent on the last syllable of the word in front of it. 
Therefore it cannot stand first word in its word-group. 
As you can see, τις can perform the function of the indefinite article. See 
p. xi. 
With adjectives, adverbs and numbers, τις may suggest that the word to 
which it is joined should not be taken completely literally: 
δεινός τις έρως (Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 5.1.24) 
a strange longing 
τριάκοντα μέν τινας άπέκτειναν. (Thucydides 8.73.6) 
They killed some thirty (about thirty). 
5 | The indefinite pronoun (τις, τι) 
τούτο λέγει τις 
άνθρωπος τις 
δεινός τις άνθρωπος 
άνθρωπος τις δεινός 
some one says this 
some/a certain man 

6 | Other pronouns 
άλλήλων one another, each other (plural, not nominative — see p. 47) 
ώς δ' είδέτην (dual, see pp. 232-3) άλλήλους ή γυνή και ό 
Άβραδάτάς, ήσπάζοντο άλλήλους. (Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 
6.1.47) 
When Abradatas and his wife saw one another, they embraced each 
other. 
άλλος, -η, -ο other 
άλλαι γυναίκες 
other women 
αί άλλαι γυναίκες 
(all) the other women, the rest of the women 
ό δέ Βρασίδας τω μέν άλλφ στρατώ ήσύχαζεν ..., έκατόν δέ 
πελταστάς προπέμπει. (Thucydides 4. Ill. 1) 
Brasidas did nothing with the rest of the army but sent forward a 
hundred peltasts. 
άλλος followed by another form of the same word can make a two-fold 
statement, as follows (cf. English 'different' - 'different people do 
different things'): 
άλλος άλλα λέγει. (Xenophon, Anabasis 2.1.15) 
one says one thing, another says another (literally, other things). 
άλλοι άλλοθεν 
some from one place, others from another 
Note also: 
ό έτερος, -ά, -ov 
one or the other of two 
οί έτεροι 
one of two groups 
έκαστος, -η, -ο ν 
each 
έκάτερος, -α, -ον 
each (one) of two 
έκάτεροι

άμφότεροι 
both, either 
ουδέτερος,-a,-ov 
1 n e i t h e r of t h e t w o 
μηδετερος, -a, -ov 
J 
When used with nouns, all of the above, apart from the first two, are 
placed outside the article and the noun.

10 Opinions differ. 

Sequence of tenses and 
moods 
In Greek, the tense of the main verb can determine whether a subjunctive 
or optative is used in a subordinate clause where one of those moods is 
needed. A similar process can operate in English too: 
I am wooing the rich widow so that I can/mav enjoy her money. 
I was wooing her so that I could/might enjoy her money. 
We call this pattern of agreement sequence of tenses and moods and it 
falls into two divisions, which we call primary (the main verb is usually in 
a present or future tense) and historic or secondary (the main verb is in a 
past tense). 
| Primary sequence 
Tense of verb in main clause 
Mood of verb in subordinate clause 
subjunctive 
present 
future 
perfect (describes a present state) 
future perfect 
Main verbs in the subjunctive and the imperative also fall into this 
category. 

| Historic sequence 
Tense of verb in main clause 
Mood of verb in subordinate clause 
imperfect 
. 
aorist 
> optative 
pluperfect 
J 
Main verbs in the optative also fall into this category. 
In the indicative, the historic tenses all begin with an augment (έ-). 
0 
You will discover that a subjunctive can be used in purpose clauses 
and clauses of fearing in historic sequence. See pp. 174-5 and p. 180. 

I Indirect statement 
Direct speech 
Indirect speech 
I am going to Athens. 
I said I was going to Athens. 
I have gone to Athens. 
I told her that I had gone to Athens. 
I shall go to Athens. 
I promised that I would go to Athens. 
An indirect statement comes after a verb in which the voice, mind or one 
of the senses is used (e.g. say, hear, discover, see, observe, know, think) 
followed by 'that' or with 'that' understood, e.g. 
I think that I am intelligent. I think he is a fool. 
It can be seen from the examples above that in English the words of direct 
speech are liable to be changed when they are converted into indirect 
speech. The Greek words usually change too, but this will depend on 
which of three different Greek constructions they follow. Here are the 
English equivalents of these three Greek constructions: 
1 I think that she is a fool. 
2 I believe her to be a fool. 
3 I regard her as being foolish. 
1 | οτι and ώς 
After verbs of saying (though not φημί), the clause of the indirect 
statement is usually introduced by δτι or ώς. δπως is also used, most often 
in poetry and Xenophon. Negative ού. 
The verb in the indirect statement remains in the tense of the direct 
speech (the tense actually used by the speaker), e.g. 
είπον δτι Άθήναζε προσέρχομαι. 
I said that I was on my way to Athens. 
αύτφ ήγγειλα ώς Άθήναζε προσείμι. 
I told him that I would (literally, shall) come to Athens. 

Note 
1 In historic sequence (i.e. after a main verb in a past tense — see 
pp. 152-3), the optative can be used. It will still be in the same tense 
as the indicative would have been (i.e. the tense actually used): 
εΐπον ότι ό Φίλιππος μώρος εΐη. 
I said that Philip was stupid. 
The optative is less 'vivid' than the indicative when used in sentences 
like this. In the example above, if έστί had been used instead of εϊη, it 
would have lent emphasis to the assertion of Philip's stupidity. 
2 δτι and ώς are chiefly found after λέγω (I say) and είπον (I said), and 
sometimes after άγγέλλω (I announce). 
2 | The infinitive construction 
After verbs of saying, thinking, believing, hoping, promising and swearing, 
the verb in the indirect statement goes into the infinitive in the tense of the 
direct speech (the tense actually used by the speaker). 
If the subject of the infinitive is the same as that of the main verb, it is 
usually omitted in Greek. If it is included, which happens rarely, it will be 
in the nominative. If the subject of the infinitive is different from that of the 
main verb, it will be in the accusative. Negative ού — as it would have 
been in the direct speech which is being reproduced. 
αϋτη φησιν Άθήναζε προσχωρήσειν. 
This women says that she will come to Athens. 
[Κλέων] ούκ έφη αύτός, άλλ' έκεινον [Νϊκίάν] στρατηγεΐν. 
(Thucydides 4.28.2) 
[Cleon] said that it was not himself who was the general, but that man 
[Nicias]. 
αύται έφασαν τήν άδελφήν άρτι άπελθεΐν. 
These women said that their sister had just gone away. 

The imperfect indicative becomes the present infinitive. 
τότε έβασίλευεν ό Δαρείος. 
Darius was king at the time. 
έφη τότε βασιλεύειν τον Δαρεΐον. 
He said that Darius was king at the time. 
The pluperfect indicative becomes the perfect infinitive. 
έφη ... χρήμαθ' έαυτφ τους Θηβαίους έπικεκηρϋχέναι. (Demosthenes 
19.21) 
He said that the Thebans had proclaimed a reward for him. 
Note 
1 The Greek for Ί say ... not' is οϋ φημι: 
ου φησι δώσειν μοι την βίβλον. 
He says that he will not give me the book. 
2 The verbs έλπίζω (I hope), ύπισχνέομαι (I promise) and όμνϋμι 
(I swear) are generally followed by a future infinitive because their 
meaning usually causes them to refer to the future. Negative μή. 
ύπέσχοντο μή κλέψεσθαι τό άργύριον. 
They promised not to steal the money, i.e. that they would not steal it. 
There is nothing irregular about this, but English speakers need to be 
on their guard since English tends to use what appears to be a present 
infinitive in this context, and this can prove misleading when 
translating English into Greek. 
The following verbs are among those which are followed by the infinitive 
construction: 
φημί 
I say 
ήγέομαι 
οίμαι, οϊομαι 
δοκέω 
• I think, consider 
νομίζω 
ύπολαμβάνω 
I suppose 
υποπτεύω 
I suspect 
εικάζω 
I guess 
πιστεύω 
I believe, feel sure that, trust 
άπιστέω 
I do not believe, disbelieve 
όμολογέω 
I agree 

3 | The participle construction 
After verbs of knowing and perceiving, the verb in the indirect statement is 
found in the participle. The participle is in the tense of the direct speech 
(the tense actually used by the speaker). If the subject of the participle is 
the same as that of the main verb, it is either omitted or is in the 
nominative. If it is different, it is in the accusative. The participle agrees in 
case, number and gender with its subject. Negative ού. 
έπιλελήσμεσθ' ήδέως γέροντες δντες. (Euripides, Bacchae 189) 
We have gladly forgotten that we are old. 
οίδα αύτόν μώρον όντα. 
I know that he is stupid. 
έγνω την έσβολήν έσομένην. (Thucydides 2.13) 
He knew that the invasion would take place. 
μέμνημαι Κριτίςι τωδε ξυνόντα σε. (Plato, Charmides 156a) 
I remember that you were together with Critias here. 
In the third example, the present participle is used to replace the imperfect 
'actually used'. This is regular. In the same way, the perfect participle 
replaces the pluperfect 'actually used'. 
Note 
1 When άκούω (I hear) is used in the context of hearing something 
actually happening, it is followed by the genitive and the participle: 
ήκουσαν της Κίρκης φδούσης. 
They heard Circe singing. 
Compare: 
άκούω αύτόν παρόντα. 
I hear that he is present. 
άκούω is regularly followed by the genitive of the person heard from 
and the accusative of the thing heard. 

2 When οΐδα (I know) and γιγνώσκω (I get to know) are used in the 
context of knowledge of a fact, they are often followed by the δτι or 
ώς construction (1 above): 
ήσαν δτι είσπλέουσιν οί πολέμιοι είς τον λιμένα. 
They knew that the enemy were sailing into the harbour. 
The idea is that they did not simply know but had been told of the 
fact; it had been spoken to them. Hence the same construction as that 
with λέγω is used. 
These verbs are among those which are usually followed by the participle 
construction. The asterisked verbs can be followed by the infinitive 
construction as well: 
οΐδα 
I know 
έπίσταμαι 
έννοέω 
μανθάνω 
> I learn, get to know 
πυνθάνομαι* 
> I learn, get to know 
γιγνώσκω 
έγνων 
αίσθάνομαι* 
1 perceive, realize 
άγνοέω 
1 don't know 
άκούω* 
1 hear 
μέμνημαι 
1 remember (literally, 1 have been reminded) 
έπιλανθάνομαι 
1 forget 
δηλόω 
1 
(έπι)δείκνϋμι 
\ 1 show 
(άπο)φαίνω 
J 
άγγέλλω* 
1 announce (usually with δτι or ώς) 
Herodotus uses both the infinitive and the participle constructions 
after πυνθάνομαι in the same sentence: 
οί... Πέρσαι πυθόμενοι σονάλίσθαι τούς Παίονας και την προς 
θαλάσσης έσβολήν φνλάσσοντας,... τράπονται. (Herodotus 5.15) 
The Persians, discovering that the Paionians had assembled and were 
guarding the approach by sea, ... turned away. 

| Subordinate clauses in indirect statement 
She said that she hated the king because his breath smelt. 
In one interpretation of this sentence, the subordinate clause 'because his 
breath smelt' is part of what she said. In that case, it is part of the indirect 
statement. Subordinate clauses in indirect statement, regardless of the 
construction used, follow these rules: 
1 If the main verb is primary (i.e. present, future or perfect - see p. 
152), the mood and tense of the verb in the subordinate clause do not 
change. 
... φησι... ποιήσειν ο μήτ' αίσχυνην μήτ' άδοξίάν αύτώ φέρει. 
(Demosthenes 19.41) 
He says he will do whatever does not bring shame or dishonour to him. 
2 If the main verb is historic (i.e. in a past tense - see p. 153), the mood 
and tense of the verb in the subordinate clause may be retained. 
... έφασαν ... τούς άνδρας άποκτενεΐν ους έχουσι ζώντας. (Thucydides 
2.5.5) 
They said that they would kill the men whom they had alive. 
It may also be put into the optative (keeping the same tense), i.e. in 
this example έχοιεν. However, past tenses of the indicative may not 
be put into the optative. They remain unchanged. 
ήλπιζον τούς Σικελούς ταύτη, ους μετεπέμψαντο, άπαντήσεσθαι. 
(Thucydides 7.80.6) 
They hoped that the Sikels whom they had sent for would meet them 
there. 
The following is included here for the sake of completeness. It can only 
be understood once the indefinite construction (see pp. 195-6) has 
been mastered. 
If a subjunctive with άν becomes optative, άν is dropped, έάν, όταν, 
etc. becoming εί, ότε, etc. 

έξελθών δέ τις αυτόμολος εΐπεν ότι έπιτίθεσθαι μέλλοιεν αύτφ, όπότε 
άπάγοι τό στράτευμα. (Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 7.5.2) 
A deserter came out and said that they intended to attack him when 
he led his forces away. (The 'when' clause in the direct speech 
would have been όπόταν άπάγης τό στράτευμα). 
άπεκρίνατο ότι μανθάνοιεν ά ουκ έπίσταιντο. (Plato, Euthydemus 
276e) 
He answered that they were learning what they did not understand.

The same rules apply to subordinate clauses within indirect questions

Direct and 
indirect questions 
| Direct questions 
What are you thinking? 
Where are you going? 
You aren't going to say that to her, are you? 
Greek has two ways of asking single direct questions. In both of them the 
verb is regularly in the indicative. 
Open or 'wh-' questions 
If the question is introduced by a word that asks a question (e.g. who? 
when? why? etc.), the word is likely to be one of those in column 1 below: 
1. Direct (and indirect) 
2. Indirect

0 
Greek π-, English wh- (and Latin qu-) are etymologically related. 
Other questions 
If the question is not introduced by one of the interrogative pronouns, 
adjectives or adverbs in column 1 above, see which of the following 
applies in the Greek: 
1 A question beginning with άρα or ή (the latter is chiefly poetic) 
implies nothing as to the answer expected, which can be either yes or 
no. 
άρ' είμι μάντις; (Sophocles, Antigone 1212) 
Am I a prophet? 
ή τέθνηκεν Οίδίπου πατήρ; (Sophocles, Oedipus Tyrannus 943) 
Do you mean that Oedipus' father is dead? 
However, just as in English, a question can be indicated by the sense 
or context, without the reinforcement of άρα or ή. Look out for (and 
don't forget to use) the question mark (;). 

2 If the question begins with άρα ού (άρ' ού), ούκούν or ού, it will 
expect the answer ye§. 
άρ' ού βούλεσθε χορεύειν; or ού βούλεσθε χορεύειν; 
You do want to dance, don't you? Surely you want to dance? 
ούκούν σοι δοκεΐ... σύμφορον είναι; (Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 
2.4.15) 
So doesn't it seem to you to be advantageous? 
3 If the question begins with άρα μή, μή or μών, it will expect the 
answer no. 
άρα μή βούλεσθε χορεύειν; or μή βούλεσθε χορεύειν; 
You don't want to dance, do you? Surely you don't want to dance? 
μή τι νεώτερον άγγελεις; (Plato, Protagoras 310b) 
No bad news, I hope? 
Note that μών does not always have this negative force: 
μών Πιτθέως τι γήρας εϊργασται νέον; (Euripides, Hippolytus 794) 
Nothing has happened to old Pittheus, has it? (The speaker fears that 
it has, but hopes that it has not.) 
4 If a question begins with πότερον (πότερα) followed, though not 
immediately, by ή (whether... or), it is a double question: 
πότερον έ§ς [αύτόν] άρχειν ή άλλον καθιστής άντ' αύτού; 
(Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 3.1.12) 
Do you allow him to rule or do you appoint someone else instead of 
him? 
πότερα δ' ήγή, & Κύρε, άμεινον είναι σύν τώ σώ άγαθφ τάς τιμωρίας 
ποιεΐσθαι ή σύν τή ση ζημί<£ (Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 
3.1.15) 
Do you think, Cyrus, that it is better to inflict the punishments for your 
own good or to your own detriment? 
You need not find a translation for πότερον (πότερα) in direct 
questions. It simply informs you that a second half to the question is 
coming up. 

0 
πότερον (πότερα) is often omitted: 
ήν χρήματα πολλά έχη, έφς πλουτείν ή πένητα ποιείς; (Xenophon, 
Education of Cyrus 3.1.12) 
If he has a lot of money, do you let him (go on) be(ing) rich or make 
him poor? 
Deliberative questions 
In questions where the speaker asks what he is to do or say, the present or 
aorist subjunctive is used. Negative μή. 
εϊπωμεν ή σϊγώμεν; (Euripides, Ion 758) 
Are we to speak or keep silent? 
ποΐ τράπωμαι; ποΐ πορευθώ; (Euripides, Hecuba 1099) 
Where can I turn? Where can I go to? 
Deliberative questions can be introduced by βούλει or βούλεσθε (θέλεις, 
θέλετε in poetry): 
βούλει εϊπω ταύτα; 
Do you want me to say these things? (literally; Am I to say these 
things? Do you want me to?) 
| Indirect questions 
Socrates asked his wife whv she nagged him so much. 
A verb in which the voice, ears, mind or one of the senses is used 
(e.g. ask, know, deliberate, discover) followed by a word which asks a 
question (who? when? why?, etc.) is followed in Greek by an interrogative 
pronoun plus a verb in the indicative, though in historic sequence 
(see pp. 152-3) the optative may be used — with a less 'vivid' force than 
the indicative. (Cf. Indirect statement with ότι and ώς (pp. 154-5).) 
The interrogatives used in direct questions (column 1 above, pp. 161-2) 
can be used, but the indirect interrogative pronouns, adjectives and 
adverbs (column 2 above) are more commonly found. 
Note that εΐ (less frequently άρα) = whether, if. 

If the indicative is used, the verb in the indirect question is in the tense 
of the direct question (the tense actually used). If the optative is used, it 
too will be in the tense actually used by the questioner. 
έρωτώντες εί λησταί είσιν (Thucydides 1.5.2) 
asking if they were pirates 
ή ρώτησα εί βούλοιτο (βούλεται) χορεύειν. 
I asked if he wanted to dance. 
έρωτφ ότι βούλεσθε. 
He is asking what you want. 
ήρετο αύτόν εί βληθείη (έβλήθη). (Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 
8.3.30) 
He asked him if he had been hit. 
ϊδωμεν άρ' ούτωσί γίγνεται πάντα. (Plato, Phaedo 70d) 
Let us see whether everything is produced exactly like this. 
Double indirect questions: 
διηρώτά τον Κύρον πότερον βούλοιτο (βούλεται) μένειν ή άπιέναι. 
(Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 1.3.15) 
She asked Cyrus whether he wanted to stay or go away. 
Note that a deliberative subjunctive (see p. 164) in an indirect question in 
historic sequence can either remain in the subjunctive or be replaced by an 
optative, e.g. 
δρώντες δέ αυτούς οί Πλαταιής άπειλημμένους έβουλεύοντο εϊτε 
κατακαύσωσιν ώσπερ έχουσιν, έμπρήσαντες τό οίκημα, εϊτε τι 
άλλο χρήσωνται. (Thucydides 2.4.6) 
Seeing that they were cut off, the Plataeans deliberated whether they 
should burn them as they were, by setting fire to the house, or 
dispose of them in some other way. 
The verbs in the indirect question could have been κατακαύσειαν and 
χρήσαιντο. 

The negative in indirect questions is generally ού, but after εί both ού 
and μή are found: 
ήρετο τον δήμον ει ούκ αίσχυνοιντο γελώντες. (Aeschines 1.84) 
He asked the people whether they were not ashamed of laughing. 
ήρετό με ... εί μή μέμνημαι. (Aeschines 2.36) 
He asked me whether I did not remember. 
0 
After verbs of saying, knowing and perceiving (but not after verbs of 
asking and rarely after negatives), the relative pronoun is often used: 
οΐδά σε δς εί. 
I know (you) who you are. [Ί know thee who thou art.'] 
Note how the subject of the subordinate clause has been extracted 
from it and made the object of the main verb. This happens in a 
number of constructions.

19 My wife asked me if I knew how (ώς) weak she was. 
20 I am at a loss (about) whether she is stupid or intelligent. 
21 I am aware of your intelligence (=1 know you, how intelligent you

22 My wife will tell you whether she is coming to Athens or not. 

Commands, exhortations 
and wishes 
Do this. Don't do that. 
Let's do this. 
If only we were doing this. 
I told her not to do that. 
| Commands 
Commands are expressed by the imperative: 
λέγε. 
ειπέ. 
Speak! 
Speak! 
ποίει τούτο. 
έλθέτω δεϋρο. 
Do this! 
Let him come here! 
χαιρόντων. 
Let them rejoice! 
For the use of the aorist imperative as opposed to the present imperative, 
see the note on aspect on p. 61. 
| Prohibitions 
Prohibitions are expressed either by μή with the present imperative or by 
μή with the aorist subjunctive. 
μή ποίει τούτο. 
Do not do this! (i.e., Don't keep doing this!) 
μή ποιήσης τούτο. 
Do not do this! 
For the distinction between the present and the aorist, see p. 61. 
The third person of the aorist imperative can occur in prohibitions. 

Note that όπως and όπως μή are used with the future indicative to 
express commands and prohibitions (often colloquially): 
νυν ούν όπως σώσεις μ[ε]. (Aristophanes, Clouds 1177) 
So now save me! 
όπως μοι... μή έρεΐς ότι έστι τά δώδεκα δις εξ. (Plato, Republic 337b) 
See to it that you do not tell me that twelve is twice six. 
It seems as if a word such as σκόπει or σκοπείτε (=see to it!) has dropped 
out in front of όπως. 
| Exhortations 
Exhortations are expressed by the first person of the subjunctive. Negative 
μη. 
ιωμεν. 
μή τούτο ποιώμεν. 
Let's go! 
Let's not do this 
μαχώμεθα άνδρείως. 
Let's fight bravely! 
0 
Imperatives and subjunctives can be preceded by άγε (άγετε), φέρε or 
ϊθι (come!). The singular form can still be used when the verb that 
follows is in the plural: 
άλλ' άγε μίμνετε πάντες. (Homer, Iliad 2.331) 
But come on, all of you, wait! 
| Wishes 
Wishes for the future are expressed by the optative, either with or without 
an introductory εϊθε or εί γάρ (if only!). Negative μή. 
εϊθ', ώ λφστε σύ, φίλος ήμίν γένοιο. (Xenophon, Hellenica 4.1.38) 
If only, you excellent fellow, you would become our friend! 
μηκέτι ζφην έγώ. (Aristophanes, Clouds 1255) 
May I no longer live! 

Wishes for the present or past, if they are unattained, are expressed by the 
imperfect or the aorist indicative, introduced by είθε or εί γάρ, which 
cannot be omitted. The imperfect expresses present time or continuous 
past time; the aorist expresses past momentary time. Negative μή. 
είθε τούτο έποίει. 
If only he was doing this! 
εί γάρ μή έγένετο τούτο. 
If only this had not happened! 
Wishes for the present and the past can also be expressed, chiefly in 
poetry, by ώφελον (=ought — aorist of όφείλω (I owe)) in the appropriate 
person, followed by the present or aorist infinitive, ώφελον can be 
preceded by είθε, εί γάρ or ώς. Negative μή. 
εί γάρ ώφελον, & Κρίτων, οΐοί τ' είναι οί πολλοί τά μέγιστα κακά 
έργάζεσθαι. (Plato, Crito 44d) 
If only, Crito, the majority were able to do the greatest evils! (present 
infinitive — referring to now) 
ώφελε τούτο ποιήσαι. 
If only he had done this! (aorist infinitive — referring to the past) 
εί γάρ ώφελον can stand on its own, meaning 'If only!' 
| Indirect commands 
Indirect commands are expressed by the infinitive, as in English. Negative 
μή (just as μή would have been used in the direct command). 
κελεύω αύτούς άπιέναι. 
I order them to go away. 
έλεγον αύτοϊς μή άδικεΐν. (Thucydides 2.5.5) 
They told them not to act unjustly. 
Some useful verbs of commanding: 
κελεύω 
I order 
παρακαλέω 
I encourage 
άπαγορεύω 
I forbid (always with μή) 

The following take the dative with the infinitive: 
διακελεύομαι 
I encourage, direct 
παραινέω 
I encourage, advise 
άγγέλλω 
I bring a message to, command 
παραγγέλλω 
I give orders 
(προ)εΐπον

I Because 
The cause of an action is often expressed in Greek by the participle with 
&τε, ώς, etc. (see p. 137). The words below, followed by a finite verb, are 
also used: 
ότι1 
διότι 
διόπερ 
ουνεκα (poetic) 
έπεί 
έπειδή 
ότε 
όπότε 
ώς 
because (i.e. the causal clause explains what 
has preceded it, e.g. Ί am looking after you 
because you are sick') 
since (i.e. the causal clause comes first, 
e.g. 'Since you are sick, I am looking after you') 
as, because, since (i.e. the causal clause 
comes first or second) 
The verb in the causal clause is regularly in the indicative. However, if the 
reason is alleged or reported, the optative is used after a verb in a historic 
tense (see pp. 152-3). This is because indirect statement is clearly implied 
(see p. 155). 
κήδετο γάρ Δαναών, ότι βα θνήσκοντας όράτο. (Homer, Iliad 1.56) 
For she pitied the Danaans because she saw them dying. 
[οί Αθηναίοι] τον Περικλέα ... έκάκιζον ότι στρατηγός ών ούκ 
έπεξάγοι. (Thucydides 2.21.3) 
The Athenians abused Pericles on the grounds that, though he was a 
general, he did not lead them out. 
Cause can also be expressed by a relative clause: 
θαυμαστόν ποιείς ος ήμίν ... ουδέν δίδως. (Xenophon, Memorabilia 
2.7.13) 
You are doing something astonishing in giving us nothing. 
1 The V of ότι does not elide.

Purpose clauses 
to see 
I went to Athens 
in order to see 
the poet, 
so as to see 
To express purpose, Greek most frequently uses ϊνα, όπως, ώς1 (in order 
that). Negative μή.2 
The sequence of tenses (pp. 152-3) means that if the verb in the main 
clause is in a primary tense, the verb in the purpose clause will be in the 
subjunctive. If the verb in the main clause is in a historic tense, the verb in 
the purpose clause may be in the optative: 
παρακαλείς Ιατρούς όπως μή άποθάνη; (Xenophon, Memorabilia 
2.10.2) 
Are you calling in doctors so that he may not die? 
φίλων ώετο δεϊσθαι, ώς συνέργους έχοι. (Xenophon, Anabasis 1.9.21) 
He thought he needed friends in order that he might have helpers. 
However, after a historic main verb, the subjunctive is often found in place 
of the optative: 
(τά πλοία) Άβροκόμας ... κατέκαυσενϊνα μή Κύρος διαβή. 
(Xenophon, Anabasis 1.4.18) 
Abrocomas burnt the boats so that Cyrus might (may) not cross. 
In this vivid usage, we enter Abrocomas' mind and find him thinking Ί 
will burn the boats so that Cyrus may not cross'. In fact, Xenophon, 
together with Plato and the poets, prefers the optative. Herodotus and 
Thucydides prefer the vivid subjunctive: 
ξυνεβούλευε ... τοις άλλοις έκπλεύσαι δπως έπι πλέον ό σίτος 
άντίσχη. (Thucydides 1.65.1) 
He advised the others to sail out so that the food might last longer. 
1 ϊνα is preferred by Aristophanes, Herodotus, Plato and the orators, δπως by 
Thucydides and Xenophon. ώς is rare in prose, except in Xenophon, but common in 
tragedy. 
2 ϊνα (etc.) μηδείς or μή τις (in order that... no one); ϊνα (etc.) μήποτε (in order that 
... never); etc. 

0 
μή can be used in place of ϊνα μή, etc. to mean 'in order that not': 
μή σπεύδε πλουτείν μή ταχύς πένης γένη. (Menander, Sententiae 358) 
Do not hasten to be rich, lest you swiftly become poor. 
This use of μή is common in poetry and in Xenophon and Plato. 
Note two other ways of expressing purpose: 
1 with the future participle (see p. 136). 
2 with the relatives, especially 6ς, ή, δ or (less commonly) όστις, ήτις, 
ότι, with the future indicative (even after historic tenses). Negative μή. 
φημι δή δειν ήμάς ... πρεσβείάν πέμπειν, ή τούς μέν διδάξει ταύτα, 
τούς δέ παροξύνει. (Demosthenes 2.11) 
I say that we must send an embassy to tell (literally, which will tell) 
some people these things and provoke others.

659)

When translating English into classical Greek, be very careful to obey 
the above rules and do NOT use the infinitive, which is probably the 
most common way of expressing purpose in English. In order to 
discover in what person to put the verb in a purpose clause introduced 
by the English infinitive, it can be helpful to change the 'to' of the 
infinitive to 'in order that' and adjust the English accordingly, e.g.: 
I went to Athens to see the comedy. 
I went to Athens in order that I might see the comedy.

Note two other ways of expressing purpose: 
1 with the future participle (see p. 136). 
2 with the relatives, especially 6ς, ή, δ or (less commonly) δστις, ήτις, 
δτι, with the future indicative (even after historic tenses). Negative μή. 
φημι δή δεϊν ήμάς ... πρεσβείάν πέμπειν, ή τούς μέν διδάξει ταύτα, 
τους δέ παροξύνει. (Demosthenes 2.11) 
I say that we must send an embassy to tell (literally; which will tell) 
some people these things and provoke others. 
κρύψω τόδ' έγχος τούμόν ... ένθα μή τις δψεται. (Sophocles, Ajax 
659) 
I shall hide this sword of mine where no one will see it.

When translating English into classical Greek, be very careful to obey 
the above rules and do NOT use the infinitive, which is probably the 
most common way of expressing purpose in English. In order to 
discover in what person to put the verb in a purpose clause introduced 
by the English infinitive, it can be helpful to change the 'to' of the 
infinitive to 'in order that' and adjust the English accordingly, e.g.: 
I went to Athens to see the comedy. 
I went to Athens in order that I might see the comedy.

Result clauses | 
Arachne wove so skilfully that she even challenged Athene. 
Atalanta ran too fast for anyone to catch her. 
In these sentences you can see how the words 'so' and 'too' signpost the 
result clause. A result clause in Greek is often signposted by one of the 
following words: 
ούτως (οϋτω before consonants) 
in such a way, so (with 
such a pitch (of) 
The result is then expressed by ώστε or sometimes ώς (as, that, so that) 
(a) followed by the infinitive (negative μή) when the result arises 
naturally or as a likelihood from the action of the main verb, i.e. when 
the action of the main verb is as important to the meaning as the 
action of the verb in the result clause. 
κραυγήν πολλήν έποίουν καλούντες άλλήλους ώστε καΐ τούς 
πολεμίους άκούειν. (Xenophon, Anabasis 2.2.17) 
They were making a loud noise as they called each other so that (with 
the result that) even the enemy could hear. 
The subject of the infinitive is in the accusative if it is different from 
that of the main verb. If it is the same, it is either omitted or in the 
nominative. 
The infinitive will almost always be used in a result clause when the 
main verb is negative: 
ούδεις πώποτ' είς τοσούτ' άναιδείάς άφίκεθ' ώστε τοιούτον τι 
τολμήσαι ποιεΐν. (Demosthenes 21.62) 
No one has ever reached such a pitch of shamelessness as to dare to 
do anything of that kind. 
τοιούτος, τοιαύτη, τοιούτο 
τοσούτος, τοσαύτη, τοσούτο(ν) 
ές τοσούτο(ν) 
adjectives and adverbs) 
such 
so great, so much 
so far, to such an extent, to 

(b) followed by the indicative (negative ού) when the actual occurrence 
of the result is stressed, i.e. when the action of the verb in the 
subordinate clause is more important than that of the verb in the 
main clause. 
οϋτω διάκειμαι ύφ' υμών ώς ούδέ δεΐπνον έχω έν τή έμαυτοϋ χώρςι. 
(Xenophon, Hellenica 4.1.33) 
I have been treated by you in such a way that I can't even have a meal 
in my own land. 
At times it is difficult to distinguish between these two usages in Greek. 
Note 
1 The comparative adjective or adverb with ή ώστε can represent the 
English word 'too': 
τους ... παΐδας αύτών ζηλώ δτι νεώτερο! είσιν ή ώστε είδέναι οϊων 
πατέρων έστέρηνται. (Lysias, Epitaphius 72) 
I envy their children because they are too young to know (literally, 
more young than so as to know) what sort of father they have been 
deprived of. 
When used in this way, ώστε must be followed by the infinitive. 
However, it is not a common usage. 
2 The infinitive with ώστε can express purpose: 
παν ποιοϋσιν ώστε δίκην μή διδόναι. (Plato, Gorgias 479c) 
They do everything so as not to be punished. 
Here they are doing everything to achieve the result of not being 
punished. 
3 ώστε can simply introduce a sentence as a connecting word meaning 
'the result was that...', 'so', 'therefore'. Used in this way, it has no 
effect on the verb that follows. The sentence in (a) on the previous 
page concludes as follows: 
... ώστε και τούς πολεμίους άκούειν ώστε οί μέν έγγύτατα τών 
πολεμίων και έφυγον. (Xenophon, Anabasis 2.2.17) 
... so that even the enemy could hear; as a result, those of the enemy 
who were nearest actually fled. 
4 Result clauses are often called consecutive clauses. 

| έφ' ω and έφ9 ωτε on condition that 
έφ' φ and έφ' φτε (on condition that) are followed usually by the infinitive, 
or occasionally by the future indicative. The negative is almost always μή. 
άφίεμέν σε, έπι τούτφ μέντοι, έφ' φτε μηκέτι... φιλοσοφείν. (Plato, 
Apology 29c) 
We release you, but on this condition, that you will no longer be a 
philosopher.

Verbs of fearing and 
precaution 
| Fearing 
• 
When English uses the infinitive after verbs of fearing, so does Greek: 
φοβούμαι τούτο ποιεΐν. 
I am afraid to do this. 
The subject of the two verbs will be the same. 
• 
Fear for the future — Greek uses μή1 (negative μή ού) with the 
subjunctive or optative depending on sequence of tenses (see pp. 
152-3). As in purpose clauses, the subjunctive can be used in historic 
sequence for a more vivid effect (see p. 174). 
δέδοικα μή ... ώσπερ οί λωτοφάγοι έπιλαθώμεθα τής οΐκαδε όδού. 
(Xenophon, Anabasis 3.2.25) 
I am afraid that like the lotus-eaters we may forget the way home. 
έδεισαν οί 'Έλληνες μή προσάγοιεν πρός τό κέρας. (Xenophon, 
Anabasis 1.10.9) 
The Greeks were afraid that they might advance against their flank. 
έφοβούντο μή τι παθή. (Xenophon, Symposium 2.11) 
They were afraid that something might happen to him. 
δέδιμεν μή ού βέβαιοι ήτε. (Thucydides 3.57.4) 
We are afraid you may prove unreliable. 
1 Compare English 'lest'. If one fears that something may happen, one hopes that it 
will not. 

• 
Fear for the present or past — Greek uses μή (negative μή ού) with the 
indicative: 
δέδοικα σ\ ώ πρεσβύτα, μή πληγών δέει. (Aristophanes, Clouds 493) 
I fear, old man, that you need blows. (literally, I fear you, old man, 
that ...cf. p. 166) 
δείδω μή δή πάντα θεά νημερτέα είπεν. (Homer, Odyssey 5.300) 
I fear that all that the goddess said was true. 
The commonest verbs of fearing are φοβούμαι and δέδοικα. Note also 
φόβος έστί (there is fear) and κίνδυνος έστι (there is danger). They are 
used with the same construction. 
Verbs of precaution (e.g. I take care, I am on my guard, I see to it that) can 
be followed by μή (negative μή ού) with the same construction as verbs of 
fearing. 
Their commonest construction, however, is όπως (negative όπως μή) 
with the future indicative: 
εύλαβούμενοι όπως μή ... οίχήσομαι. (Plato, Phaedo 91c) 
taking care that I do not go away. 
Verbs used to introduce this construction: 
| Precaution 
όράω 
σκοπέω, σκοπέομαι 
σκεπτέον έστί 
εύλαβέομαι 
φροντίζω 
φυλάττω, φυλάττομαι 

0 
For urgent exhortations, δπως or δπως μή can stand on their own 
without the introductory word meaning 'see to it' (e.g. σκόπει, 
δράτε): 
δπως δέ τούτο μή διδάξεις μηδένα. (Aristophanes, Clouds 824) 
But be careful not to teach anyone this.

Conditional sentences 
Conditional clauses in English are introduced by 'if', 'unless', 'if... not', 
'whether ... or'. You must be careful not tQ confuse them with indirect 
questions (see p. 164-6). Conditional sentences are made up of a 
conditional clause and a main clause which gives the consequence or 
implication of the conditional clause. In both English and Greek the 
conditional clause usually (but by no means always) comes first. 
Here are some examples to illustrate them. 
If Penelope was ever angry, I was a wretched husband. 
If Penelope is unfaithful, I am a wretched husband. 
If Penelope proves unfaithful, I shall be a wretched husband. 
If Penelope were to be unfaithful, I would be a wretched husband. 
If Penelope had been unfaithful, I would have been a wretched 
husband. 
In both English and Greek, conditional sentences can simply state facts, as 
in the first three above and in the axiomatic: 
If a triangle has two equal sides, it is an isosceles triangle. 
In this grammar we call conditionals of this type open (any time). 
The fourth and fifth sentences above fall into the categories of remote 
(referring to the future) and unfulfilled (referring to the present or past) 
respectively. Comparison between the third and fourth sentences will show 
how the fourth is expressed in a doubtful or remote way in contrast with 
the third. The words 'were to' and 'would' signal this remoteness. 
In the fifth sentence, we are in the area of the unreal or the impossible. 
Penelope was not unfaithful and the condition is unfulfilled. Here the 
words 'would have been' (or 'should have been') are the key. 
Thus it is natural to call conditionals of these two kinds remote and 
unfulfilled. 
We call the 'if' clause the protasis and the main clause the apodosis. 
(Protasis is the Greek for 'what is put forward', i.e. a premise; apodosis is 
the Greek for 'giving back, return', i.e. an answering clause.) 

13 The Greek for 'if is ει, and for 'whether ... or' εϊτε ... εϊτε. 
The negative in the protasis is μή. The negative in the apodosis is ού 
unless the clause has its own reasons for using μή.1 
| Open conditionals 
Past and present 
In past and present time, the verbs in both the protasis and the apodosis go 
into the natural tense of the indicative: 
εί ταύτα λέγεις, καλώς λέγεις. 
If you are saying these things, you are talking sense. 
εί ταύτα έλεγες, καλώς έλεγες. 
If you were saying these things, you were talking sense. 
εί ταύτα είπες, καλώς είπες. 
If you said these things, you talked sense. 
Future 
An open conditional referring to the future can have its verb in the future 
indicative. However, Greek tends to take into account the fact that the 
future is uncertain and to use the indefinite construction (see pp. 195-6) in 
the protasis, i.e. έάν + the subjunctive (έάν is made up of εί and άν):2 
έάν ταύτα λέγης, καλώς έρεΐς. 
If you say these things, you will be talking sense. 
If the future indicative is used, it insists on the inevitability of the 
consequence. It is thus appropriate to emotional appeals, threats and 
1 In addition to being a statement, an apodosis may be a command, a wish or a 
question, μή may stand in these constructions. 
2 In Ionic, in Thucydides and in tragedy, ήν appears in place of έάν. άν is also found 
in Attic Greek: Plato uses it more commonly than έάν. 

warnings. In this case the word for 'if' is not έάν but εί: 
εί ταύτα έρείς, άποκτενώ σε. 
If you say these things, I shall kill you. 
The future indicative is used in the apodosis whether the verb in the 
protasis is in the subjunctive or the indicative. 
N.B. In the last two examples above, what looks like a present tense in 
English ('you say') in fact refers to the future. We call this a concealed 
future, and if you are translating from English into Greek, it is vital that 
you spot it. 
0 
If the conditional clause begins with έάν and the verb in the main 
clause is in the present indicative, it is likely that έάν is introducing an 
indefinite conditional clause, where the rules relating to indefinite 
clauses affect those for conditional clauses. See pp. 195-6. 
έάν τοϋτο ποιής, σέ έπαινώ. 
If (= whenever) you do this, I (always) praise you. 
If the conditional clause had not been indefinite, the sentence would 
have read: 
εί τούτο ποιείς, σέ έπαινώ. 
If you are doing this, I praise you. 
| Unfulfilled and remote conditionals 
Present 
To convey present time in unfulfilled conditionals, Greek uses the imperfect 
indicative in the protasis and the imperfect indicative with άνι in the 
apodosis. 
1 άν is often placed before or after the verb but it can be attached to negatives, to 
interrogatives or to any emphatic word. It never comes first word in a sentence or a 
clause. 

ει ταύτα έλεγες, καλώς άν έλεγες. 
If you were saying these things, you would be talking sense. 
It is an interesting - and helpful - coincidence that 'you were saying', 
which is in fact an English subjunctive, is identical to the imperfect tense. 
Past 
To convey past time in unfulfilled conditionals, Greek uses the aorist 
indicative in the protasis and the aorist indicative with άν in the apodosis. 
ει ταύτα είπες, καλώς άν είπες. 
If you had said these things, you would have talked sense. 
0 
ή or ήν is usually considered to be the imperfect of είμί (I am). In this 
construction it may also convey the meaning of the aorist: 
πολύ άν θαυμαστότερον ήν (imperfect meaning), ει έτϊμώντο. (Plato, 
Republic 489b) 
It would be far more wonderful if they were being honoured. 
Contrast: 
ώστ', ει παρήσθα (aorist meaning), τόν θεόν τόν νυν ψέγεις 
εύχαΐσιν άν μετήλθες εισιδών τάδε. 
(Euripides, Bacchae 712-3) 
And so, if you had been there, you would have sought with prayers the 
god whom now you criticize, after seeing these things. 
The imperfect indicative is used to refer to an act as continuing or being 
repeated in the past. So 
εί ταύτα έλεγες, καλώς άν έλεγες 
could mean 'if you had been saying these things, you would have been 
talking sense' as well as 'if you were saying these things (now), you would 
be talking sense' (see the last example but one). The context should make 
the meaning clear. 

Future 
Remote conditionals referring to the future use εί + the optative in the 
protasis and the optative with άν in the apodosis. 
ει ταύτα λέγοις, καλώς άν λέγοις. 
If you were to say these things, you would talk sense. 
Note that in English 'you said' could be substituted for 'you were to say'. 
0 
The times at which the protasis and apodosis are set may be different. 
This is especially common with: 
ει + aorist indicative, imperfect indicative + άν. 
If I had done X, I would (now) be doing Y. 
Greek uses the construction appropriate to each clause. So: 
ει μή υμεϊς ήλθετε, έπορευόμεθα άν έπί βασιλέα. (Xenophon, 
Anabasis 2.1.4) 
If you had not come, we would now be marching against the king. 
Examine the following sentences. To which of the categories described

αισχροκερδής, ούκ ήν θεού. (Plato, Republic 408c) 
If Asclepius was the son of a god, he was not greedy for profit; if he 
was greedy for profit, he was not the son of a god. 
έάν ούν ϊης νυν, πότε έσει οϊκοι; (Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 
5.3.27) 
So if you go now, when will you be at home? 
εί ταύτα λέξεις, έχθαρή μέν έξ έμού. (Sophocles, Antigone 93) 
If you say these things, you will be hated by me. 

εί μεν περί άλλου τινός ή του σώματος ... Καλλίάς ήγωνίζετο, 
έξήρκει άν μοι και τά παρά τών άλλων είρημένα. (Lysias 5.1) 
If Callias were fighting for anything apart from his life, even the things 
said by everybody else would be enough for me. 
και ίσως άν ... άπέθανον εί μή ή άρχή διά ταχέων κατελύθη. (Plato, 
Apology 32d) 
And perhaps I would have been killed, had not the government 
speedily been put down. 
ού πολλή άν άλογίά εϊη, εί φοβοΐτο τόν θάνατον ό τοιούτος; (Plato, 
Phaedo 68b) 
Would it not be a great absurdity if such a man were to fear death? 
εί ήσαν άνδρες άγαθοί, ώς σύ φής, ούκ άν ποτε ταύτα έπασχον. 
(Plato, Gorgias 516e) 
If they had been good men, as you say, they would never have suffered 
these things (repeatedly). 
| Conditional sentences in indirect statement 
I said that if I made a mistake I would take responsibility for it. 
Protasis 
If the main verb (the verb of saying, etc.) is in a primary tense (see pp. 
152-3), the verb in the protasis of the indirect statement is unchanged. If 
the main verb is in a historic tense, the verb in the protasis can be put into 
the optative, but only if it is in a primary tense. (It may, of course, be in the 
optative already.) If the original subjunctive of the protasis is changed to 
the optative, εί must replace έάν. 
Apodosis 
If the construction with δτι or ώς is used, the rules on pp. 159-60 are 
followed. If the infinitive or participle is used, this will be in the same 
tense as the indicative or optative of the direct speech, with the present 
infinitive and 

participle standing in for the imperfect. If άν would have been used in the 
direct statement, it must remain. 
έάν τούτο ποιήτε, πάντα καλώς έξει. 
If you do this, all will be well, (direct speech) 
ήγούμαι, έάν τούτο ποιήτε, πάντα καλώς έξειν. 
I consider that, if you do this, all will be well, (primary sequence) 
ήγούμην, εί τούτο ποίοιτε, πάντα καλώς έξειν. 
I considered that, if you did this, all would be well, (historic sequence) 
In the last example έάν τούτο ποιήτε could have been kept from the direct 
speech. 
εί τούτο ποιοίης, πάντα καλώς άν έχοι. 
If you were to do this, all would be well, (direct speech) 
ήγούμαι, εί τούτο ποιοίης, πάντα καλώς άν έχειν. 
I think that, if you were to do this, all would be well, (primary sequence)

The gerundive | 
This young man is by no means to be despised. 
One word remains to be said. 
As well as using χρή and δει (see p. 190), Greek has another way of saying 
'ought', 'must' or 'should'. This is the gerundive, a passive verbal 
adjective (the equivalent of 'to be despised' and 'to be said' in the above 
sentences). It expresses the necessity for the action of the verb to be 
performed, and ends in -τέος, -τέά, -τέον, declining like φίλιος (see p. 32). 
It usually adds the ending to the verb stem which has the same form as 
that of the aorist passive (e.g. (έ)παύσ(θην)) with φ changing to π and 
χ to κ: 
παύω -» παυστέος 
to be stopped 
ποιέω 
ποιητέος 
to be done 
λαμβάνω 
ληπτέος 
to be taken (aor. έλήφθην) 
πράττω -»πρακτέος 
to be done (aor. έπράχθην) 
πείθω -> πειστέος 
to be persuaded or to be obeyed1 
Note the following less easily identifiable gerundives: 
φέρω -» οίστέος 
to be carried, endured (cf. fut. οϊσω) 
είμι 
ίτέος 
to be travelled (cf. 2 pi. ϊτε) 
Gerundives are used in two ways: 
• 
as straightforward adjectives. The agent is in the dative: 
ώφελητέά σοι ή πόλις έστίν. (Xenophon, Memorabilia 3.6.3) 
The city must be helped (literally, is to be helped) by you. 
• 
in the impersonal form -τέον (n. sg.) or -τέα (n. pi.), as the equivalent 
of χρή or δει with the infinitive (this usage is essential for intransitive 
verbs), e.g. 
ποιητέον (or ποιητέα) (έστί) = ποιείν χρή or δει 
It is necessary to do ... 
1 Note that verbs with different meaning in the active and middle have both 
available in the gerundive. 

σπευστέον (έστί) = σπεύδειν χρή or δει 
It is necessary to hurry. 
The agent can be in the dative (as in the last example) or in the 
accusative (as if it were accompanying χρή or δει). 
ήμϊν γ' ύπέρ της έλευθερίάς άγωνιστέον. (Demosthenes 9.70) 
We at any rate must struggle for freedom. 
In this example, ήμϊν could equally well have been ήμάς. 
Since the sense of the gerundive tends to be active, it can take an 
accusative object: 
τόν βουλόμενον ... εύδαίμονα είναι σωφροσύνην διωκτέον και 
άσκητέον. (Plato, Gorgias 507c) 
It is necessary that the man who wishes to be happy should pursue 
and practise moderation. 
οίστέον τάδε. (Euripides, Orestes 769) 
\ 
These things must be endured. 
As can be seen from the above examples, έστί (the word for 'it is', or the 
equivalent) is frequently omitted.

Indefinite clauses | 
I like the books you write. 
I like whatever books you write. 
I welcomed her when she arrived. 
I welcomed her whenever she 
arrived. 
The word 'ever' added to 'what' and 'when' in the sentences in the second 
column above makes the clause in which it appears indefinite. In Greek, 
verbs in primary (i.e. present or future) time in an indefinite clause are in 
the subjunctive with άν.1 Verbs in historic (i.e. past) time are in the 
optative without άν. 
Negative μή. 
0 
Since in most other constructions involving the subjunctive and 
optative, the subjunctive is not used with άν while the optative will 
have άν somewhere nearby, the indefinite construction is generally 
easy to recognize. 
Some examples: 
ά άν βούλωνται έξουσιν. 
They will have whatever they want. 
ότε βούλοιτο, τούτο έπράττεν. 
Whenever he wanted to, he used to do this. 
Note these indefinite conditional clauses: 
γελφ δ' ό μώρος κδν (= και έάν) τι μή γελοιον ή. (Menander, 
Sententiae 108) 
The fool laughs (every time) even if something is not funny. 
έάν is made up of εί and άν. (cf. p. 184.) 
1 άν never comes first word in a clause (or a sentence). In this construction it is 
likely to be closely attached to the word ('if', 'which', etc.) which begins the 
indefinite clause, often coalescing with it (e.g. δταν for ότε (when) άν, έπειδάν for 
έπειδή (when) άν, έάν for εί (if) άν). 

έτίμά δ' εϊ τι καλόν πράττοιεν, παρίστατο δ' εϊ τις συμφορά 
συμβαίνοι. (Xenophon, Agesilaus 7.3) 
He honoured (them) if (ever) they performed a noble action and he 
stood by them if (ever) any misfortune befell them. 
For this type of conditional, see pp. 184-5.

Time clauses | 
Time clauses referring to the present or the past have their verb in the 
appropriate tense of the indicative unless they are indefinite,1 in which case 
they follow the indefinite construction (pp. 195-6). 
εως έστί καιρός, άντιλάβεσθε των πραγμάτων. (Demosthenes 1.20) 
While there is an opportunity, take matters in hand. 
ήνίκα δε δείλη έγίγνετο, έφάνη κονιορτός. (Xenophon, Anabasis 
1.8.8) 
When it was getting to be afternoon, a cloud of dust appeared. 
όταν σπεύδη τις αύτός, χώ θεός συνάπτεται. (Aeschylus, Persae 742) 
Whenever a man is eager himself, god too works with him. 
Unlike English, the Greek language reflects the view that the future is 
inevitably indefinite. Therefore, in Greek, time clauses referring to the 
future are indefinite and therefore follow the indefinite construction for 
primary time, i.e. the verb is in the subjunctive with άν. This difference 
between the languages means that it is often better to translate words such 
as όταν not by 'whenever' but simply by 'when'. 
όταν δη μή σθένω, πεπαύσομαι. (Sophocles, Antigone 91) 
When my strength fails, I shall stop. 
ήνίκα δ' άν τις υμάς άδικη, ήμεϊς ύπέρ υμών μαχούμεθα. Xenophon, 
Education of Cyrus 4.4.11) 
But whenever anyone wrongs you, we shall fight for you. 
1 A time clause is indefinite: 
(a) when it refers to the future 
(b) when it happens an indefinite number of times 
(c) when it continues for an indefinite period.

μεγίστάς συμφοράς κατέστησαν. (Lysias 25.26) 
They did not stop (before) until they divided the city into factions. 

| πριν 
If πρίν is followed by the infinitive, it will mean 'before'. Otherwise 
translate it as 'until'. 
For speakers of English, helpful rules for the use of πρίν are: 
1 If πρίν can be translated either by 'before* or 'until· and the main verb 
is negative, its clause follows the rule of other temporal clauses (given 
above): 
ού χρή με ένθένδε άπελθεϊν πρίν αν δώ δίκην. (Xenophon, Anabasis 
5.7.5) 
I must not go from here before (until) I pay the penalty. 
ού πρόσθεν έπαύσαντο πρίν έξεπολιόρκησαν τον Όλουρον. 
(Xenophon, Hellenica 7.4.18) 
They did not stop before (until) they had taken Olourus by siege. 
2 If πρίν can be translated only by 'before', it is followed by the 
infinitive unless the main verb is negatived or contains a negative idea 
(e.g. άπαγορεύω (I forbid)). (In that case its clause follows the rule of 
other temporal clauses.) 
οί και πρίν έμ' ειπείν ότιούν είδότες (Demosthenes 18.50) 
those who know even before I say anything 
λέγεται γάρ Άλκιβιάδην, πρίν εικοσιν έτών είναι, Περικλεΐ ... τοιάδε 
διαλεχθήναι περί νόμων. (Xenophon, Commentaries 1.2.40) 
For it is said that Alcibiades, before he was twenty years old, 
discussed such things about laws with Pericles. 
πρότερον ή (sooner than, before) follows the same construction. 
0 
The subject of the infinitive is regularly in the accusative unless it is 
the same as that of the main verb, in which case it is in the 
nominative.

Verbs of preventing, 
hindering and denying 
Minos tried to prevent Daedalus and Icarus from leaving Crete. 
The mob in the street hindered his journey to the Pnyx. 
In Greek, verbs of preventing, hindering and denying (all of which contain 
some sort of negative sense) are followed by the infinitive, which can often 
be preceded by μή.1 When the verb of preventing is negatived itself, or is 
part of a question expecting the answer no, Greek usually follows it with 
μή ού with the infinitive: 
καταρνή μή δεδράκέναι τάδε; (Sophocles, Antigone 442) 
Do you deny that you did this? 
τίνα οΐει άπαρνήσεσθαι μή ούχί (see p. 204) καί αύτόν έπίστασθαι τά 
δίκαια; (Plato, Gorgias 461c) 
Who do you think will deny that he too understands what is just? 
(The answer 'nobody' is implied.) 
However, κωλύω (I hinder, prevent), whether negatived or not, is usually 
followed by the infinitive without μή: 
τόν μεν Φίλιππον παρελθεΐν .. .ούκ έδύναντο κωλύσαι. (Demosthenes 
5.20) 
They could not prevent Philip from passing through. 
Other usages after these verbs: 
• 
τό μή or τό μή ού with the infinitive: 
τόν πλείστον δμϊλον των ψιλών εΐργον τό μή ... τά έγγύς της πόλεως 
κακουργεϊν. (Thucydides 3.1.2) 
They prevented the biggest company of the light-armed troops from 
ravaging the parts near the city. 
1 The μή is redundant, but strengthens the negative idea of the verb. Compare 
Shakespeare, Comedy of Errors 4.2.7: 'First he denied you had in him no right.' 

ουδέν γαρ αύτφ ταύτ' έπαρκέσει τό μή ού πεσεΐν. (Aeschylus, 
Prometheus Bound 918) 
For in his case, these things will not be enough (to prevent him) from

ού becomes ούκ when the next word begins with a vowel with a 
smooth breathing, and ούχ when the next word begins with a vowel 
with a rough breathing, ούχί is a more emphatic denial than ού. 
As a rule, compound negatives which follow another negative (simple or 
compound) confirm it rather than cancel it as in English:2 
μή ταύτα λέγε μηδέποτε. 
Never say these things. 
Two negatives cancel each other out - making a strong affirmative - only if 
a simple negative follows another negative: 
ούδέ τον Φορμίων' έκεΐνος ούχ όρφ. (Demosthenes 36.46) 
literally, nor does he not see Phormio, Le. he sees Phormio plainly 
enough. 
1 When translating ούδέ and μηδέ, note that these have both the weak meaning 'and 
not' and the strong meaning 'not even'. 
2 But compare colloquial Ί can't get no satisfaction'. 

| The uses of ού and μή 
ού is the negative of facts and statements. μή is the negative of will and 
thought. 
ού is used in:

answer 'yes', and in normal 
μή is used in: 
all commands, exhortations and 
wishes

result clauses with the 
indicative 
the normal apodosis (main 
clause) of conditional 
sentences

answer 'no', and in all 
deliberative questions 
all indefinite clauses including 
temporal clauses 
result clauses with the infinitive 
purpose clauses with the 
subjunctive, optative, future 
indicative or future participle; 
also relative purpose clauses 
the protasis ('if...' clause) of 
conditional or concessive

(see below) 
the infinitive except in indirect 
statement 
the infinitive in indirect 
statement (but see p. 156 for 
μή after verbs such as 'hope',

Generic μή (indicating a class or group): 
ταύτα ά ού βούλεται πράττει ν άποφεύγει. 
He runs away from the (particular) things he doesn't want to do. 
ταύτα α μή βούλεται πράττειν άποφεύγει. 
He runs away from the sort of things he doesn't want to do. 

έφ' οΐς γάρ μή φρονώ σϊγάν φιλώ. (Sophocles, Oedipus Tyrannus 569) 
For I am accustomed to be silent over (the kind of) matters I do not

| Double negatives 
1 The uses of the double negative μή ού after verbs of fearing and 
precaution and of preventing, hindering and denying are explained on 
pp. 180-1 and pp. 201-2. 
2 ού μή with the aorist subjunctive (less commonly the present 
subjunctive) or the future indicative expresses a strong negative 
statement: 
ού μή παύσωμαι φιλοσοφών. (Plato, Apology 29d) 
I will not cease from searching for wisdom. 
ού τοι μήποτέ σ'... δκοντά τις άξει. (Sophocles, Oedipus at Colonus 
176) 
No one shall ever take you against your will. 
3 In Greek drama, ού μή may be used with the second person singular 
of the future indicative to express a strong prohibition: 
ού μή προσοίσεις χείρα μηδ' άψη πέπλων. (Euripides, Hippolytus 
606) 
Don't lay your hand (on me) or touch my garment! 
ού μή ληρήσεις. (Aristophanes, Clouds 367) 
Don't talk rubbish! 

Particles | 
Greek particles are short words which never change and serve one or more 
of the following functions: 
1 They can connect one utterance to a preceding one. 
2 They can qualify a word, phrase or clause ('even', 'also', 'anyway', etc.). 
3 They can 'colour' a word, phrase or clause, conveying what is often 
expressed in spoken English by volume and tone of voice ('he said 
that', 'he said that!') and in written English by italics, exclamation 
marks, inverted commas, etc. 
For reasons of convenience, a number of adverbs and conjunctions are 
included under this heading. 
Those words marked * cannot stand first in a sentence.

όμνΰμι θεούς ... ή μήν μήτε με Ξενοφώντα κελεύσαι 
άφελέσθαι τον άνδρα μήτε άλλον υμών μηδένα. 
(Xenophon, Anabasis 6.6.17) 
I swear by the gods that neither Xenophon nor anyone 
else among you told me to rescue the man. 
καί 
and, actually, also, even 
καί... καί... 
both ... and ... 

... τε* 
both ... and ... 
(...) και... 
Note that as an enclitic τε must be translated into English 
in front of the word which it comes after in Greek: 
Χ τε και Υ = both X and Υ. 
και γάρ 
and in fact 
και δή 
and above all (introducing a climax) 
και δή καί 
and especially, and in particular, and what is more 
καίτοι 
and yet 
μέν* ... 
on the one hand ... but on the other hand ... 
δέ* ... 
Sometimes the δέ clause is missing and must be supplied 
in thought. To put the English word 'while' (expressing 
not time but contrast) between the μέν and δέ clauses may 
be a good way of translating these words, but should not 
be overused. 
ή μέν ψϋχή πολυχρόνιόν έστι, τό δέ σώμα 
άσθενέστερον καί όλιγοχρονιώτερον. (Plato, Phaedo 
87 ά) 
The soul lasts for a long time, while the body is weaker 
and lasts for a shorter time. 
Remember that δέ means 'but on the other hand', not 
simply 'on the other hand*. Thus the following sentence 
does not work: 
των μέν Λακεδαιμονίων έν τή Αττική δντων, οί δέ 
Αθηναίοι έν τή πόλει έμενον. 
When the Spartans on the one hand were in Attica, but 
the Athenians on the other hand stayed in the city. 
μέν ούν* 
certainly, in fact; no, on the contrary 
Crito: άτοπον τό ένύπνιον, ώ Σώκρατες. 
Socrates: έναργές μέν ούν. (Plato, Crito 44b) 
The dream was strange, Socrates. 
No, on the contrary, it was clear. 
The speaker corrects his own words or those of another 
speaker, μέν ούν can also signal transition to a new 
subject. In addition, it can also simply combine the usual 
sense of μέν and ούν. 

μεντοι* 
μην* 
και μήν 
τι μην; 
μήτε ... 
μήτε ... 
δμως 
ούδέ 
οϋτε ... 
ούτε ... 
οϋκουν, 
ούκοϋν 
ουν* 
δ'ονν* 
however, certainly 
φιλοσοφώ μέν έοικας ... ισθι μέντοι άνόητος ών. 
(Xenophon, Anabasis 2.1.13) 
You are like a philosopher... know however that you are 
stupid. 
άληθέστατα μέντοι λέγεις. (Plato, Sophist 245b) 
Certainly, what you say is very true. 
indeed, however (especially after a negative) 
and indeed, and yet 
but here comes ... Le. signalling the entry of a new 
character in tragedy: 
και μήν άναξ όδ[ε] ... πάρα. (Sophocles, Oedipus at 
Colonus 549-50) 
But look, here is the king 
(on its own) but of course 
(introducing a question) what indeed? but what? 
άλλά τί μήν δοκεΐς; (Plato, Theaetetus 162b) 
But what is your opinion? 
neither... nor... 
nevertheless 
and not, not even (also μηδέ - see pp. 204-6)) 
neither ... nor ... (also μήτε ... μήτε ... - see pp. 204-6) 
Give priority to the part of the word with the accent: 
οϋκουν means 'certainly not' 
ούκοϋν means simply 'therefore', or alternatively 'not ... 
therefore?' (introducing a question expecting the answer 
'yes', like άρ' ού (see above, p. 207)). 
therefore, and so 
see under δέ 

που* (enclitic) που as an enclitic means Ί suppose' or 'somewhere'. 
τε* (enclitic) 
... τε* ... τε* 
... καί... 
τοι* (enclitic) 
τοινυν* 
ώς 
and (τε is translated into English in front of the word 
which it comes after.) 
Ζεϋ άλλοι τε θεοί (Homer, Iliad 6.476) 
Ο Zeus and the other gods 
both ... and ... and ... (see under καί) 
you do realize (The speaker feels that the hearer's attitude 
or behaviour should be affected by what is said.) 
τών τοι ματαίων άνδράσιν φρονημάτων 
ή γλώσσ' άληθής γίγνεται κατήγορος. 
(Aeschylus, Seven Against Thebes 438-9) 
So it is true that their tongue is the true accuser of 
men's vain conceits. 
further, therefore 
as, when, since, because 
how! 
that..., e.g. 
έλεγον ώς ... 
they said thai ... 
ώς with the future participle is used to express purpose 
(see p. 136). 
Note that accented ώς means 'thus, in this way'.

Greek likes to have a connecting word at the beginning (usually first 
or second word) of each sentence, δέ (and, but) will often be found at 
the outset of a passage and throughout it (as second word). Often 
there is no need to translate it into English. 

| Practice exercise 
What are the Greek connecting words you would use if you were 
translating this paragraph of Mansfield Park by Jane Austen? Fill in the 
gaps and give Greek equivalents for the words underlined. I have generally 
put the dots after the first word of their clause but you are welcome to use 
a connecting word that would in fact begin the clause. 
She ... was then taken into a parlour, so small that her first 
conviction was of its being only a passage-room to something better, 
and she stood for a moment expecting to be invited on; but when 
she saw there was no other door, and that there were signs of 
habitation before her, she ... called back her thoughts, reproved ... 
herself, and grieved lest they should have been suspected. Her 
mother, however, could not stay long enough to suspect anything. 
She ... was gone again to the street-door to welcome William. ... 
Oh! my dear William, [' she said.'] how glad I am to see you. But 
have you heard about the "Thrush"? She ... is gone out of the 
harbour already; three days before we had any thought of it; and I do 
not know what I am to do about Sam's things, they ... will never be 
ready in time; for she may have her orders tomorrow, perhaps. It... 
takes me quite unawares. And now you must be off for Spithead too. 
Campbell ... has been here, quite in a worry about you; and now 
what shall we do? I ... thought to have had such a comfortable 
evening with you, and here everything comes upon me at once.'

I Some tips 
1 While almost all words of the second declension have their neuter nom. 
and acc. singular in -ov, the following words (which are or can be 
pronouns) have them in -o: 
ό 
τό 
the 
δδε 
τόδε 
this 
δς 
δ 
who, which 
ούτος 
τούτο 
this 
έκεϊνος 
έκείνο 
that 
αύτός 
αύτό 
self, the same; it (acc.) 
άλλος 
άλλο 
another, the other 
2 Even if you do not learn the whole system of Greek accents, it is 
worthwhile noting: 
(a) τίς, τίνος (with an accent over the first syllable) means 'who? 
what?' 
τις, τινός (an enclitic, either with no accent or with an accent over 
the second syllable) means 'some, any, a'. 
(b) -έω verbs: 
ποιεί: the accent shows that this is in the present indicative active 
(3 sg.) or passive (2 sg.), 'he/she does', 'you are made ...'. 
ποίει: the accent shows that this is the singular present imperative: 
'do!'. 
(c) ή, οί and αί do not have accents when they are definite articles, but 
do have them (ή, οϊ and αϊ) when they are relative pronouns. 
(d) άλλα = other things 
άλλά = but 
3 The historic present: to convey excitement, vividness or immediacy, the 
present tense may be used of an action in the past: 
τηρήσάς με ... παίει τε πυξ καί άρπάζει μέσον καί έώθει με είς τάς 
λιθοτομίάς. (Demosthenes 53.17) 
after watching out for me, he hits me with his fist and grabs me round 
the middle and tried to shove me into the quarries. 
In this example note also the shift into the imperfect. The historic 
present is rare in English and it is generally advisable to translate it into 
an English past tense. 

4 The gnomic aorist: the aorist can be used in maxims and proverbs 
(γνώμαι). (In English, as often in Greek also, these are usually 
expressed in the present tense, e.g. Too many cooks spoil the broth/ 
But compare 'Curiosity killed the cat/) 
£ώμη ... μετά μέν φρονήσεως ώφέλησεν, άνευ δέ ταύτης πλείω τούς 
έχοντας έβλαψε. (Isocrates 1.6) 
Strength joined with judgement does good, but without it, it does 
greater harm to those who have it. 
5 The future tense: 
(a) The Attic future of verbs with stems ending in ν is often a 
contracted form with the letter ε. 
μένω 
μενώ (έω) 
I wait, wait for 
φαίνω 
φανώ (έω) 
I show 
This also happens with verbs with stems ending in λ, μ and ρ: 
βάλλω 
βαλώ(έω) 
I throw, hit 
νέμω 
νεμώ(έω) 
I distribute, pasture 
έγείρω 
έγερώ (έω) 
I wake (X) up 
(b) The Attic future of verbs ending in -ίζω which have more than two 
syllables is also a contracted form with the letter ε as follows: 
νομίζω 
νομιώ (έω) 
I consider 
6 Potential clauses: note how what is in effect the apodosis (main clause) 
of a conditional sentence containing άν is frequently found without the 
protasis ('if clause), which is implied (see pp. 183-7). We call this 
usage 'potential': 
τούτου τίς άν σοι τάνδρός ... άμείνων ηύρέθη; (Sophocles, Ajax 
119-20) 
Who could you have found better than this man [if you had looked or 
similar]? 
δις ές τον αύτόν ποταμόν ουκ άν έμβαίης. (Heraclitus, quoted at 
Plato, Cratinus 402a) 
You could not step twice into the same river [if you were trying to 
cross it or similar]. 
7 When the subjects of the verb are different persons, the verb is first 
person plural if one of the subjects is first person, second person if the 
subjects are second and third persons: 
υμεΐς δέ και έγώ που τάδε λέγομεν. (Plato, Laws 661b) 
But you and I, I suppose, say these things. 
πάντες άν υμείς και οί άλλοι Αθηναίοι άναστάντες έπί τό βήμ' 
έβαδίζετε. (Demosthenes 18.171) 

All of you and the rest of the Athenians would stand up and go to the 
speaker's platform. 
8 The verbal adjectives in -τέος and -τός: 
For the use of the gerundive form in -τέος, see pp. 193-4. 
The endings -τός -τή -τόν are added to verbs in the same way. 
These verbal adjectives either have the same meaning as a perfect 
passive participle, e.g. παιδευ-τός (educated), τακ-τός (ordered); or 
(more frequently) they convey possibility, e.g. δρά-τός (visible, i.e. 
that can be seen), πράκ-τός (that may be done). Many -τός forms 
fall into both categories. Some of them are active, e.g. £υτός 
(flowing). 
9 The letter ν at the end of prefixes (έν, σύν) changes (is 'assimilated') 
before certain consonants to assist pronunciation: 
before β, μ, π, φ, ψ it becomes μ — συμβαίνω (I come together) 
before γ, κ, ξ, χ it becomes γ — συγχέω (I pour together) 
before λ it becomes λ — έλλείπω (I leave out, undone; I fail) 
10 άμυνω (I defend) and θαυμάζω (I wonder at) 
(a) άμυνω basically means Ί keep [X (acc.)] away'. When it means Ί 
defend', the people (or whatever) defended go into the dative (of 
advantage). Thus: 
άμυνω τοις πολίταις. 
I keep away (the danger) for the advantage of the citizens, 
Le. I defend the citizens. 
(b) θαυμάζω can be used with the genitive to mean Ί wonder at' as 
well as with the accusative in the sense Ί admire'. 
11 καθίστημι: these two sentences, the first with a transitive form of the 
verb, the second with an intransitive form, will repay study: 
κατέστησα υμάς είς άθϋμίάν. 
I reduced you to despair (literally; I placed you into despair), 
κατέστην είς άπορίάν. 
I was reduced to helplessness (literally; I was placed into 
helplessness). 
12 A vowel which is naturally short becomes 'heavy' when followed by 
two consonants. (More correctly, it is the syllable which is heavy.) 
However, it may remain short (i.e. the syllable remains 'light') if the 
vowel is followed by a pair of consonants in which the first is a mute 
(or stop) ( π β φ τ δ θ κ γ χ ) and the second a liquid or nasal (λ ρ μ ν). 
13 If you are looking up a word beginning ξυν- or ξυμ- in a dictionary and 
cannot find it, look it up under συν- or συμ-. See p. 59. 

Appendices | 

I Accents 
There are three accents in ancient Greek. These indicate the musical pitch 
of the syllable on which they are placed: 
the acute 
' 
(high pitch) 
the grave 
' 
(low pitch or possibly a falling of the voice) 
the circumflex 
" 
(high pitch falling to low) 
Almost all Greek words have their own accent. Among those which do not 
are: 
• 
ό, ή, οί, αί [nom. of the definite article) 
• 
ού, ώς (= how) 
• 
εί, ώς (= when, as, that) 
• 
είς, έν, έκ, ώς (= to) 
See also Enclitics below. 
| The rules of accentuation 
| The acute and the grave 
The acute can fall on any of the last three syllables. If the last syllable 
contains a long vowel or a diphthong, it can fall only on one of the last 
two. So: 
φίλιος άργύριον φιλία βασιλεύς τιμή 
If an acute falls on the last syllable, it becomes grave when followed by 
another word, unless it is immediately followed by a punctuation mark or 
the next word is an enclitic (see below). So: 
ποία ή τιμή; ή τιμή ήν οί θεοί διδόασιν. 
What sort of honour? The honour that the gods give. 

Thus the grave can only stand on the last syllable not followed by a 
punctuation mark or an enclitic. 
Note how in the example above τιμή becomes τιμή because of its 
different position in the sentence, θεοί would have appeared as θεοί if it 
had been the last word in its sentence. 
| The circumflex 
The circumflex can fall only on one of the last two syllables and only on a 
long vowel or a diphthong. If the last syllable contains a long vowel or a 
diphthong, a circumflex cannot stand on the second-last syllable. So: 
έκεϊνος έκείνη έκεΐνο 
0 
For the purposes of accentuation -αι and -01 of the nom. plural count 
as SHORT. So: φίλιοι, φίλιαι, γνώμαι. 
I Names of the accents 
Each of the accents has a technical name: 
third-last 
second-last 
last 
oxytone 
barytone 
perisp5menon 
acute 
proparoxytone 
paroxytone 
grave 
circumflex 
propenspomenon 

| Enclitics 
Enclitics are linked by accent to the previous word. They 'lean on' it 
(έγκλίνω (I lean on), hence 'enclitic'). They often have no accent of their 
own and are likely to throw an acute accent onto the final syllable of the 
previous word, if possible. So: 
άνήρ τις έδωκέ μοι δώρόν τι. 
Some man gave me a gift. 
The occasions when an enclitic cannot place an acute on the final syllable 
of the previous word are as follows: 
1 The enclitic will cause a final grave accent on the previous word to 
revert to its natural accent, an acute, e.g. άνήρ τις. 
2 If the accent of the previous word is a circumflex on the last syllable, 
the enclitic causes no change (βούς τις, cf. δώρόν τι). 
3 If the accent on the previous word is an acute on the second-last, 
again the enclitic causes no change to that previous word, e.g. £ήτωρ 
τις. 
4 Strings of enclitics throw their accents back onto each other. So: 
εϊ τίς τί σοί φησιν ... 
If anyone is saying anything to you ... 
5 Note that a word can end up with two accents. 
The principal enclitics are: 
• 
indefinite τις (someone, anyone, some) 
• 
the indefinite adverbs (που, ποι, etc. - see p. 52) 
• 
the present indicative of είμί (I am) (except the 2 sg., but see p. 93) 
• 
the present indicative of φημί (I say) (except the 2 sg.) 
• 
the personal pronouns: με, μου, μοι; σε, σου, σοι (except when σέ, σου, 
σοι are emphatic); έ, ού, οί 
• 
τε (and), νυν ((logical) now, then), που (I suppose), γε, τοι (see pp. 208 
& 212) 

Accents | 2251 
Enclitics of more than one syllable have an accent on their second syllable 
when the previous word has an acute on its penultimate (second-last) 
syllable (paroxytone), e.g. λόγοι τινές. Cf. 3 above. 
| The position of the accent 
| Nouns and adjectives 
The accent on the nominative stays on the same syllable in the other cases 
as far as the general rules allow. Note the following: 
1 Words of the first and second declensions with an acute on the last 
syllable of the nominative singular have a circumflex on the final 
syllable in the genitives and datives. So: 
σοφός: σοφού, σοφώ; σοφών, σοφοΐς 
σοφή: σοφής, σοφή; σοφών, σοφαις 
σοφόν: σοφού, σοφφ; σοφών, σοφοΐς 
2 All first declension nouns have a circumflex on the -ών of the genitive 
plural. 
3 Monosyllables of the third declension have their accents on the final 
syllable of the genitive and dative. So: 
βοϋς (cow): βοός, βοι; βοών, βουσί(ν) 
4 Note πόλεως, πόλεων and άστεως, άστεων (and the declension of 
ίλεως on p. 34). These are exceptions to the rule that if the last 
syllable is or contains a long vowel or diphthong, the accent can fall 
only on one of the last two syllables. 
5 If a diphthong has an accent, it is placed over the second vowel. So 
βασιλεύς, σοφαΐς. 

| Verbs 
Generally the accent is placed as far back as possible. (This is almost 
always true of finite verbs.) The accent is nearly always acute. But note: 
1 For the purposes of accentuation only, final -αι counts as short, except 
in the optative. Thus: 
παϋσαι 
aor. act. infinitive or 2 sg. aor. mid. imperative 
παύεται 
3 sg. pres. indie, mid./pass. 
παύσαι 
3 sg. aor. opt. act. 
2 If the infinitive ends in -ναι, it will have its accent on the penultimate 
syllable and the nom. sg. masculine and neuter participles will be 
accented on the last syllable. Thus: 
είναι - ών, ουσα, ov (m. & η. gen. sg. δντος) 
πεπαυκέναι - πεπαυκώς, πεπαυκυΐα, πεπαυκός 
(m. & η. gen. sg. πεπαυκότος) 
παυσθήναι - παυσθείς, παυσθεΐσα, παυσθέν 
(m. & n. gen. sg. παυσθέντος) 
3 If the final syllable contains a short vowel, or is -αι (except in the 
optative), a circumflex is obligatory over a long penultimate vowel or 
diphthong when it is accented, e.g. είναι (to be) as opposed to 
διδόναι (to give). 
4 In the 2nd aorist (see p. 69), verbs have their accents on the last 
syllable of the active infinitive, participle and 2 sg. imperative. Thus 
(from λαμβάνω (I take)): 
λαβείν - λαβών, λαβούσα, λαβόν - λαβέ 
5 Contracted verbs have a circumflex on the resulting contracted 
syllable when the first of the two contracted syllables was accented 
before contraction. Thus ποιέω -> ποιώ. They have the acute when 
the second of the syllables was accented, or when the last syllable is 
long. Thus ποιε-έτω -> ποιείτω and τΐμα-οίην —> τϊμφην. 
The contracted syllable is, of course, unaccented if neither of the two 
syllables was accented. Thus ποίε-ε 
ποίει (2 sg. pres. imperative 
active).

Dialect| 
| Some key features of Homeric dialect 
The Greek after the equation marks is Attic. 
1 The augment may be omitted - λύσε = έλυσε (he loosed), βή = έβη 
(he went). 
2 Nominative singular: Attic -ά always appears as -η: θύρη (door), χώρη 
(country). But N.B. θεά (goddess): there is no Attic equivalent. 
3 Genitive singular in -οιο: δώροιο = δώρου (of a gift); 
also in -άο, -εω: Άτρείδάο and Άτρείδεω = Άτρείδου (of the son of 
Atreus). 
4 Dative plural: 
(a) Where Attic has -αις we find -ης or -ήσι: θύρησι = θύραις (doors), 
πύλησι = πύλαις (gates); της and τήσι = ταΐς (definite article, 
relative pronoun). 
(b 2nd declension words can end -οισι: δώροισι = δώροις (gifts), 
(c) 3rd declension words can end -(σ)σι or -εσσι: πόδεσσι and ποσσί 
= ποσί (feet); βελέεσσι, βέλεσσ^ηά βέλεσι = βέλεσι (missiles). 
The moveable nu can be added to all of these. 
5 The definite article: 
(a) most commonly means 'he', 'she', 'it', 'they* or 'this', 'that'. 
(b) οί and αί appear also as τοί and ταί. 
(c) Forms identical with the definite article are used as the relative 
pronoun, though the masculine nominative singular of the relative is 
ός as in Attic. 
6 The use of the enclitics οί (to him, to her) and τοι (to you (sg.)). 
7 Active infinitives often end in -μεν or its extended form 
-μεναι: άκουέμεναι = άκούειν (to hear); τεθνάμεν(αι) = τεθνάναι 
(to be dead); έμεν, έμμεν, έμεναι, έμμεναι = είναι (to be). 

8 Homer generally does not contract verbs ending in -έω, -άω and -όω 
which would contract in Attic. 
9 κεν (κε, κ') can be used as well as άν, with the same force. 
10 Tmesis, i.e. the separation of a preposition which is the prefix to a 
verb, from that verb: προς μϋθον έειπεν = μϋθον προσεΐπεν (he 
addressed a word). 
11 Particles frequently used in Homer: 
άρα, άρ, £α 
so, next (for transition) 
δή 
indeed (for emphasis, often of time) 
ή 
truly, certainly (for emphasis) 
περ 
just, even (for emphasis); although 
τε 
and; you know, let me tell you (to show that a 
comment is generalizing) 
τοι 
I tell you (for asssertion); can also = σοι (to you) 
| Some key features of Herodotus' Ionic 
dialect 
The Greek after the equation marks is Attic. 
1 Herodotus often has η where Attic has a (especially after ε, ι, p): 
ήμέρη = ήμέρά (day); πρήγμα β πράγμα (business, affair). 
2 Herodotus uses -έω for the genitive singular of nouns like νεηνίης 
(= νεάνίάς, young man): νεηνίεω = νεάνίου. 
3 Herodotus uses -έων for the genitive plural of nouns like τιμή, 
θάλασσα, χώρη, κριτής: Περσέων = Περσών (of the Persians). 
(This is contracted in Attic.) 
4 Dative plurals of the first and second declensions end in -σι: άγροΐσι 
(fields), τοίσι (definite article), τούτοισι (these). 
5 Herodotus uses σσ where Attic has ττ: θάλασσα = θάλαττα (sea), 
πρήσσω = πράττω (I do). 
6 Herodotus can have: 
ει for Attic ε: ξεινος = ξένος (foreigner, guest, host) 
ου for Attic ο: μοϋνος - μόνος (alone) 
ηϊ for Attic ει: οίκήιος = οίκειος (private, home-grown). 

10 
11 
12 
Herodotus often does not contract verbs ending in -έω which would 
contract in Attic: φιλέω = φιλώ (I like), ποιέειν = ποιείν (to make), 
νόος (mind) does not contract. 
Herodotus often does not contract nouns which have contracted forms 
in Attic (see p. 31), e.g. γένος (race): gen. sg. γένεος = γένους, nom. 
& acc. pi. γένεα = γένη. Compare σεο = σου (of you). 
Herodotus can have ευ in place of Attic εο or ου: σευ (for σεο = σου, 
of you), μευ = μου (of me), ποιεύμενα (for ποιεόμενα = ποιούμενα, 
things being done), ποιεύμεν = ποιούμεν (we do). 
Herodotus uses forms identical with the definite article as the relative 
pronoun, though the masculine nom. singular of the relative is ός as 
in Attic. 
With a few exceptions, there were no 'h' sounds in Ionic. Thus 
aspiration is often omitted: άπικνέομαι = άφικνέομαι (I arrive); 
μετίημι = μεθίημι (I let go). 
The following Herodotean forms are well worth noting: 
Herodotus 
έμεωυτού (gen.) 
έωυτού (gen.) 
έών, έούσα, έόν 
κοΐος (όκοϊος) 
κότε (όκότε)

| New Testament Greek 
The Greek of the New Testament differs significantly from that of Plato or 
Xenophon. But it is not (as was once thought) a special variety of Greek 
used by Jews of the Near East, or by the Holy Spirit. On the whole, it 
reflects the everyday Greek of the first century AD. 
1 except as an indirect reflexive (see pp. 148-9). 

Because of the political and commercial power of Athens, as well as the 
prestige of its literature, Attic became the dominant Greek dialect in the 
late fifth century BC. It gradually evolved (with an admixture of Ionic 
elements) into the so-called Koine (ή κοινή διάλεκτος = the common 
dialect) of the Hellenistic period. The main catalyst was the fourth-century 
rise of Macedon under Philip the Second and his son Alexander the Great. 
The Macedonians were anxious to assert their Greekness (Demosthenes 
called them barbarians - 3.16, 3.24 etc.), but their own language 
(apparently unintelligible to other Greeks) lacked the cultural prestige to 
match their imperial ambitions. 'Great Attic', already dominant outside its 
region of origin, met the need. As Alexander moved eastwards through the 
former Persian empire to the borders of India, founding (according to 
tradition) seventy cities, this form of Greek was from the outset employed 
as the official language. It became the universal vernacular of the eastern 
Mediterranean, a form of Greek simplified and modified to be a suitable 
vehicle for ordinary people of many races. 
The New Testament comes to us in Greek. However, the main language 
of Jesus and his disciples was Aramaic (a Semitic language related to 
Hebrew), and the gospel writers give several direct quotations of this. But 
the culture of Palestine was multi-lingual. Hebrew was widely spoken 
around Jerusalem. The inscription on the cross 'Jesus of Nazareth, the 
King of the Jews' was written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek (John 19.20). 
Some key features of New Testament Greek: 
1 There is a general simplification of both accidence and syntax. 
2 In accidence, difficulties and irregularities are frequently ironed out: 
unusual forms of comparative adjectives are made regular; third 
declension adjectives are rare; monosyllabic nouns (irregular in 
declension) are replaced; verbs in -μι are given the endings of verbs in 
-ω; first (regular) aorist endings often replace 2nd aorists (see pp. 
69-70); middle verbs are often replaced by active verbs with reflexive 
pronouns; the optative is rare; the dual number has disappeared. 
3 ϊνα has acquired new roles: it now introduces result clauses, indirect 
statements and third person direct commands. 
4 Purpose is often expressed by the infinitive or by the genitive singular 
of the definite article with the infinitive (i.e. the gerund - see p. 124): 
μέλλει γάρ Ηρώδης ζητεΐν τό παιδίον, του άπολέσαι αύτό. (Matthew 
2.13) 
For Herod intends to seek the young child (in order) to destroy him. 

5 Prepositions are used where the case alone would have sufficed in 
classical Attic. There are changes in the cases that prepositions take 
(the accusative advancing at the expense of others). Pronouns are 
used when the sense would be clear without them. Diminutive forms 
are used apparently with the same sense as the nouns of which they 
are diminutives, e.g. βιβλαρίδιον (book), diminutive of βίβλος. 
6 There are about 900 words (about 10% of the total vocabulary) not 
found in classical authors. 
7 There are numerous Semitic idioms, e.g. έγένετο introducing another 
verb (traditionally translated 'it came to pass that ...')· 
8 The narrative is generally without complication and clauses tend to 
follow one after another in a straightforward manner. 

I The dual 
If a verb has two people or things as its subject, or if a noun or adjective 
denotes two people or things, Greek can use a form called the dual. 
| Nouns and adjectives 
The following endings are used: 
1st declension 
2nd declension 
3rd declension 
dual 
nom./acc. -a 
-ω 
-ε (sometimes -ει) 
gen. /dat. -αιν 
-οιν 
-οιν 
The dual of the definite article: 
m. 
f. 
n. 
dual 
nom./acc. τώ 
τώ 
τώ 
gen./dat. 
τοΐν 
τοΐν 
τοίν 
For example: 
τώ καλώ άνθρώπω 
the two handsome people 
τοΐν σοφαίν θυγατέροιν 
of the two wise daughters 

| Verbs 
In verbs, duals are almost entirely limited to the second and third person. 
The following endings are attached to the stem + vowel-ending of the 
relevant tense (e.g. ε in the present tense of παύω): 
active 
middle/passive 
2 
-τον 
-σθον 
3 (primary)1 
-τον 
-σθον 
(historic)1 
-την 
-σθην 
For example: 
παύσετον 
the two of you/them will stop 
έπαυσάτην 
the two of them stopped 
παύσητον 
the two of you/them stop (pres. subj. act.) 
παυσαίσθην 
the two of them stop themselves (aor. opt. mid.) 
εΙμί (I am) has the following dual forms: 
έστόν 
(present indicative) 
ήστον, ήστην 
(imperfect indicative) 
ήτον 
(subjunctive) 
εΐτον or εΐητον, 
εϊτην or είήτην 
(optative) 
έστον, έστων 
(imperatives, 2nd and 3rd persons) 
1 See pp. 152-3. 

j Some literary terms 
alliteration the recurrence of the same or a similar consonant 
(cf. assonance), especially at the beginning of words or syllables: 
τον δέ ταύρω χαλκέω καυτήρα νηλέα νόον 
έ/θρά Φάλαριν κατέχει παντςί φάτις. (Pindar, Pythians 1.95-6) 
Universal condemnation seizes hold of Phalaris, the man of pitiless 
spirit who burned men in his bronze bull. 
The use of alliteration imparts emphasis, and the effect this creates 
depends on the meaning of the words emphasized. 
anadiplosis the repetition (literally 'doubling') of one or several words, e.g. 
Byron's The Isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece, Where burning Sappho 
loved and sung' {Don Juan, Canto 3). 
Θήβαι δέ, Θήβαι πόλις άστυγείτων, μεθ' ήμέράν μίαν έκ μέσης τής 
Ελλάδος άνήρπασται. (Aeschines 3.133) 
Thebes, Thebes, a neighbouring city, has been uprooted from the 
midst of Greece in the course of a single day. 
anaphora the repetition of a word or phrase in two or more successive 
clauses: 
ούτοι γάρ πολλούς μέν των πολιτών είς τούς πολεμίους έξήλασαν, 
πολλούς δ' άδίκως άποκτείναντες άτάφους έποίησαν, πολλούς δ' 
έπιτίμους όντας άτιμους κατέστησαν. (Lysias 12.21) 
For these men drove many of the citizens out to the enemy, many they 
killed unjustly and left unburied, and many who had civic rights 
they deprived of them. 
antithesis the contrasting of ideas emphasized by the arrangement of 
words: 
ώς τρις άν παρ' άσπίδα | στήναι θέλοιμ' άν μάλλον ή τεκείν άπαξ. 
(Euripides, Medea 250-1) 
since I would rather stand three times in the battle line than give birth 
once. 

aposiopesis a device in which the speaker breaks off before completing the 
sentence: 
εϊπερ γάρ κ' έθέλησιν 'Ολύμπιος άστεροπητής | έξ έδέων στυφελίξαι 
... (Homer, Iliad 1.580-1) 
for if the Olympian lightning-sender wishes to smash us from our seats 
Here something like 'what can we do about it?' must be understood. 
apostrophe the author 'turns away' (άποστρέφεται) from his narrative 
(told in the third person) to address one of his characters: 
ούδέ σέθεν, Μενέλαε, θεοι μάκαρες λελάθοντο | άθάνατοι. (Homer, 
Iliad 4.127-8) 
and you, Menelaus, the gods, the blessed immortals, did not forget. 
Homer and other poets appear to use this device to express sympathy for 
their characters. 
assonance the occurrence of similar vowel sounds in words close to each 
other (cf. alliteration): 
κατί/γεν ήγεν j/γεν ές μελαν πέδον. (Euripides, Bacchae 1065) 
he pulled the branch down, down, down, to the black ground. 
πάθει μάθος. (Aeschylus, Agamemnon 177) 
through suffering (comes) knowledge. 
asyndeton the omission of conjunctions (such as 'and' or 'but') where 
these would usually occur: 
προσπεσόντες έμάχοντο, έώθουν έωθούντο, έπαιον έπαίοντο. 
(Xenophon, Education of Cyrus 7.1.38) 
falling upon them, they fought, they pushed (and) were pushed, they 
struck (and) were struck. 
bathos the juxtaposition of the intense or important and the trivial: in 
Aristophanes' Birds, Basileia (Royalty) is the keeper of the thunderbolt of 
Zeus, of good counsel, good sense, the dockyards, abuse, the paymaster 
and the three-obol bits (1538-41). 

chiasmus (adjective chiastic) a pair of balanced phrases where the order 
of the elements of the second reverses that of the first: 
έν ... σώμ' έχων και ψϋχήν μίαν (Demosthenes 19.227) 
having a single body and a single soul 
This patterning can be represented with crossing diagonal lines like the 
Greek letter chi: 
ψϋχ.,. 
closure the sense of completion or resolution at the conclusion of a literary 
work or part of a literary work. Often conclusions deny us this sense of 
completion. For example, at the end of Homer's Odyssey, the peace that 
has been established by the hero on his island by his slaughter of the 
suitors is a disconcertingly uneasy one. 
ellipsis the shortening of a sentence or phrase by the omission of words 
which can be understood: 
έξ όνύχων λέοντα (Alcaeus 113) 
(to judge) a lion by its claws 
enallage and hypallage (in practice these terms cannot be distinguished) 
the use of the transferred epithet, i.e. transferring an adjective from the 
word to which it properly applies to another word in the same phrase: 
νεϊκος άνδρών ξύναιμον (Sophocles, Antigone 794) 
kindred strife of men [for strife of kindred men) 
enjambement (single-word enjambement) running a sentence over the end 
of a line of verse and then ending it after the first word of the new line, 
lending emphasis to that word: 
πίπτει προς ούδας μϋρίοις οίμώγμασιν | Πενθεύς. (Euripides, Bacchae 
He fell to the ground with innumerable cries of sorrow, did Pentheus. 
euphemism the substitution of a mild or roundabout expression for one 
considered improper or too harsh or blunt: εύφρόνη (the kindly time) for 
'night', Ευμενίδες (the kindly ones) for the Furies, άριστερός (better) for 
'left', the unlucky side. 
1112-13) 

hendiadys a single idea expressed through two nouns or verbs: 
έν άλι κυμασί τε (Euripides, Helen 226) 
in the sea and the waves (for in the waves of the sea) 
The word 'hendiadys' is Greek for 'one by means of two'. 
hyperbaton the dislocation of normal word order, by way of displacing one 
part of one clause into another; the effect is often impossible to 
reproduce in a literal English translation of the Greek: 
σύ δέ αύτός, ώ πρός θέων, Μένων, τί φής άρετήν είναι; (Plato, Meno 
71 d) 
but you yourself, by the gods, Ο Meno, what do you say that virtue is? 
Here the hyperbaton seems to reflect the informality and emphasis of 
conversation: 'Now you yourself, Meno - come on - what's your 
opinion?' 
hyperbole the use of exaggerated terms, not to be taken literally (cf. 
litotes). Thus μύριοι, which literally means 10,000, can (with the 
accentuation μύριοι) mean 'countless' or 'infinite'. 
hysteron proteron the reversal of the normal (temporal) order of events: 
εϊματά τ' άμφιέσάσα θυώδεα και λούσάσα (Homer, Odyssey 5.264) 
having dressed him in fragrant robes and washed him 
Clearly he was washed first. By his order Homer lays emphasis on what 
he describes first, which seems to him to be the more important action. 
irony the expression of one's meaning by using words of the opposite 
meaning in order to make one's remarks forceful, 
dramatic irony occurs when a character in a play uses words which have 
a different meaning for the speaker and for the audience, who know the 
truth of the situation. This is a device which is used with particular force 
by Sophocles. For example, in Oedipus Tyrannus he makes highly 
effective use of the fact that the blind seer Teiresias can see the truth 
while Oedipus, despite his gift of sight, cannot. 
Socratic irony the refusal to claim expertise, frequently employed by 
Socrates to provoke or confuse those in discussion with him. 
juxtaposition the placing of words next to each other for effect (see also 
oxymoron): 
δημοβόρος βασιλεύς (Homer, Iliad 1.231) 
king who feeds on his people 

liminality the use of location, especially involving passing through doors 
or gates, to make a symbolic point. In Euripides' play, Medea comes out 
of the house, to which her female role has confined her, to deliver the 
most assertive feminist manifesto in ancient literature (214). 
litotes the use of understatement, involving a negative, to emphasize one's 
meaning (cf. hyperbole). Thus, ούκ όλίγοι (not a few) can mean 'many' 
and ούκ άφανής (not obscure) can mean 'famous'. Cf. ούδ' ούτω κακώς 
(and not so badly), the words of a man who threw a tile at a dog but hit 
his stepmother (Plutarch, Septem Sapientium Convivium 147c). 
metaphor the application of a word or phrase to something it does not 
apply to literally, indicating a comparison, for example 'a sea (κλύδων) 
of troubles': 
φωνή γαρ ορώ, τό φατιζόμενον. (Sophocles, Oedipus at Colonus 138) 
for I see by sound, as the saying is. 
metonymy a form of expression by which people or things can take their 
name from something with which they are associated. Thus θέάτρον (a 
theatre) can be used of spectators, ϊππος (a horse) of cavalry, and Ιχθύες 
(fish) of a fish-market. In poetic texts, the names of gods are frequently 
used to denote their areas of control. Thus Dionysus (or Bacchus) can 
mean 'wine', Aphrodite 'love', etc.; cf. synecdoche. 
onomatopoeia words or combinations of words, the sound of which 
suggests their sense, for example, βρεκεκεκέξ κοάξ κοάξ (the croaking 
of frogs) in Aristophanes' Frogs (209). In the following hexameter line, 
the rhythm, with its smoothly running light syllables, imitates the rolling 
of Sisyphus' stone: 
αύτις έπειτα πέδονδε κυλίνδετο λάας άναιδής. (Homer, Odyssey 
11.598) 
then down again to the plain rolled the shameless stone. 
oxymoron the juxtaposition (see above) of two words of contradictory 
meaning to emphasize the contradiction: 
νόμον άνομον (Aeschylus, Agamemnon 1142) 
a discordant song 
The word 'oxymoron' is Greek for 'sharp-blunt' and is an oxymoron 
itself. 

paradox a statement which apparently contradicts itself but in fact makes a 
meaningful point: 
ει γαρ ώφελον, ώ Κρίτων, οΐοί τ' είναι οί πολλοί τά μέγιστα κακά 
έργάζεσθαι, ϊνα οίοί τ' ήσαν και άγαθά τά μέγιστα. (Plato, Cnto 
44d) 
if only, Crito, the majority were able to do the greatest evils, so that 
they might have been able to do the greatest good deeds as well. 
paronomasia a punning play on words: 
ού γάρ τον τρόπον άλλά τον τόπον μετήλλαξεν. (Aeschines 3.78) 
for he changed not his disposition but his position. 
periphrasis a circumlocutory or roundabout way of saying things. Thus in 
verse, βλέπειν φάος can mean 'to see the light (of day)', i.e. 'to be alive'. 
personification the representation of an idea or thing as having human 
characteristics. Death is frequently personified in Greek literature, and 
indeed appears as an actual character in Euripides' Alcestis. 
pleonasm the use of words which are superfluous to the literal meaning: 
κεϊτο μέγας μεγαλωστί. (Homer, Iliad 16.776) 
he lay huge at his huge length. 
prolepsis the use of an adjective to anticipate its result; i.e. the adjective 
will not be applicable until the action of the verb which controls it has 
been completed: 
τούτον τρέφειν τε και αϋξειν μέγαν (Plato, Republic 565c) 
to rear and to exalt this man into greatness 
σέ Θήβαί γ' ούκ έπαίδευσαν κακόν. (Sophocles, Oedipus at Colonus 
919) 
and yet, Thebes did not train you to be base. 
simile a figure of speech in which one thing is compared explicitly with 
another; in English, the words 'like' or 'as' often indicate a simile. In 
Homer, for example, human beings are frequently compared to animals 
or birds. The simile is a notable feature of epic - hence the term 'epic 
simile'. 

syllepsis an expression in which the same word is used in two phrases in 
two different ways but makes literal sense in both, e.g. 'she went home 
in a flood of tears and a sedan chair' (Charles Dickens, The Pickwick 
Papers) and 'Miss Nipper shook her head and a tin canister, and began 
unasked to make the tea' (Dickens, Dombey and Son): 
χρήματα τελούντες τούτοις ... και χάριτας (Plato, Crito 48c) 
paying (literally) money and paying (metaphorically) thanks to his 
men 
Cf. zeugma. 
synecdoche a form of expression in which the part is used to imply the 
whole. Thus δόρυ (plank) can mean 'ship', while the other meaning of 
δόρυ (the shaft of a spear) can lead to 'spear' and 'war'. Cf. metonymy. 
tautology repeating the same thing in different ways: 
άγών μέγας, | πλήρης στεναγμών ούδέ δακρύων κενός. (Euripides, 
Hecuba 229-30) 
a great contest, full of groans and not empty of tears. 
zeugma a figure of speech in which a verb or adjective is applied to two 
nouns, though it is literally applicable to only one of them, e.g. 'with 
tearful eyes and mind' (cf. syllepsis): 
ούτε φωνήν ούτε του μορφήν βροτών όψει. (Aeschylus, Prometheus 
Bound 21) 
you will know (literally, see) neither voice nor form of any of mortals. 
The Greek word ζεύγμα means 'a yoking'.
