What happens 
to the spike 
(action 
potential) when 
it reaches the 
end of an axon?

What is a Synapse? 
F A Synapse is a “connection” or junction between two neurons 
Electrical synapses use gap junctions 
Chemical synapses use neurotransmitters

Synapses can be Excitatory or Inhibitory 
Increase or decrease postsynaptic membrane potential

An Excitatory Synapse 
Input spike  
Neurotransmitter 
release (e.g., 
Glutamate)   
Binds to ion channel 
receptors   
Ion channels open  
Na+ influx   
Depolarization due to 
EPSP (excitatory 
postsynaptic potential)

An Inhibitory Synapse 
Input spike  
Neurotransmitter 
release (e.g., GABA) 
 Binds to ion  
channel receptors  
Ion channels open   
K+ leaves cell   
Hyperpolarization due 
to IPSP (inhibitory 
postsynaptic potential)

The Synapse Doctrine 
Synapses are the basis for memory and learning

How do Brains Learn? Synaptic Plasticity 
If neuron A repeatedly takes part in 
firing neuron B, then the synapse 
from A to B is strengthened

Synaptic Plasticity depends on Spike Timing! 
LTP/LTD depends on relative timing of input and output spikes

We seem to know a lot about channels, 
neurons, and synapses… 
 
What do we know about how networks of 
neurons give rise to perception, behavior, and 
consciousness?
