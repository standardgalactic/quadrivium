HOW TO START HACKING WITH KALI
LINUX

Now that we've had some time to explore Kali Linux and
understand why hackers choose this operating system over
Windows or Mac for their hacking needs, let's delve into the
world of hacking. Specifically, we'll focus on the distinctions
between ethical hacking and black hat hacking, which
represents the unethical side of hacking.
Before we dig deeper, let's briefly discuss black hat hacking.
Black hat hackers are typically the individuals that come to
mind when we think about hackers. They have malicious
intentions and aim to cause harm. Their activities often
involve 
running 
illegal 
businesses, 
stealing 
sensitive
information, and making money through illicit means. They
employ various techniques to achieve their objectives, but
the central theme is benefiting themselves at the expense
of others.
On the other end of the spectrum, we have ethical hackers.
These individuals engage in hacking not to harm others but
to protect. They might work for a company to safeguard
large corporate networks or apply their skills to secure their
own systems. Ethical hackers use similar methods to black
hat hackers but with a crucial distinction: they have
permission to access the network in question. Unlike black
hat hackers, they act within legal and ethical boundaries.
It's important to note that there are various types of hackers
with different motivations, knowledge levels, and skills in
hacking and coding. However, for now, our focus will remain
on understanding the fundamental differences between
black hat hackers and ethical hackers.
Let's explore the concept of an Ethical Hacker. Ethical
hacking, often referred to as white hat hacking, involves the
practice of assessing networks and computer systems to
identify and rectify security threats. Ethical hackers
undertake these actions with the goal of enhancing security
and minimizing potential vulnerabilities.

Ethical hackers, unlike black hat hackers, operate within the
boundaries of the law and ethical principles. They aim to
assess a system's security by attempting to bypass its
defenses and identifying any weak points that malicious
hackers could exploit. The knowledge gained from these
activities 
helps 
organizations 
improve 
their 
system's
security, making it less susceptible to potential attacks.
Hacking, in this context, is the process used to discover
vulnerabilities within a system. It allows for the identification
of entry points, often unauthorized, that malicious actors
could use for various illicit activities. It's essential to note
that hacking is typically considered illegal, and those caught
engaging in illegal hacking activities may face severe
consequences.
However, hacking can have legal applications, primarily
when conducted with proper authorization. Many companies
hire computer experts to assess their systems, searching for
vulnerabilities before black hat hackers can exploit them.
This proactive approach is a precautionary measure against
potentially harmful hacking attempts.
Ethical hackers, often known as white hat hackers, are the
individuals engaged in such activities. They conduct ethical
hacking, which entails authorized assessments of systems
and networks to enhance security.
This distinction leads us to the comparison between white
hat and black hat hackers, while recognizing that there are
other categories in between. Still, for the purpose of this
discussion, we'll primarily focus on understanding the
fundamental principles of hacking and its implications.
Now, let's delve into these different types of hackers and
the motivations behind their actions.
BLACK HAT HACKERS

When you hear the term "hacker," your initial thoughts
might gravitate toward news articles featuring hackers who
steal data or engage in unauthorized activities for personal
gain. These are the black hat hackers, individuals who
infiltrate 
networks 
or 
systems 
without 
the 
owner's
permission.
Black hat hackers are driven by personal gain and often
employ various techniques to achieve their objectives. They
may conduct activities such as man-in-the-middle attacks,
keylogging, or other methods to gain unauthorized access
and acquire information. Malware, viruses, and Trojan horses
are tools they frequently use to breach systems. Successful
black hat hacking can result in significant financial losses for
companies and damage to their reputation.
WHITE HAT HACKERS
White hat hackers, while possessing similar skills and
techniques to black hat hackers, have different motivations.
Their intentions are noble, and they always seek proper
authorization before assessing a network or system. They
may either work on their own network or, as employees of a
company, assess their employer's network security.
White hat hackers operate in two primary ways. Firstly, they
conduct security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and
report them to network administrators or system owners.
Secondly, some white hat hackers are genuinely interested
in computer systems and work on discovering flaws and
vulnerabilities to learn more about the field.
The critical distinction for white hat hackers is that they
always have the necessary permissions to access the
network. Network administrators or system owners are
aware of their presence and their purpose – enhancing
security. White hat hackers provide detailed reports on
vulnerabilities they discover, along with recommended
steps to secure the network further.

GRAY HAT HACKERS
Sitting between the white hat and black hat hackers are the
gray hat hackers. They lack authorization to access a
network, and network owners may remain unaware of their
presence. However, these individuals typically do not have
malicious intentions. Instead, they seek out vulnerabilities
and inform network administrators or owners to help them
secure their systems.
In this guidebook, we primarily focus on the role of a white
hat hacker, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding
networks while also providing a foundation in hacking
techniques. Whether you choose to be a white hat or black
hat 
hacker, 
the 
methods 
involved 
remain 
relatively
consistent. The key distinction lies in your intentions –
whether 
you 
aim 
to 
protect 
systems 
or 
exploit
vulnerabilities for personal gain. We emphasize that illegal
black hat hacking is not condoned, and our focus here is
solely on the principles and practices of white hat hacking.
What Qualifies as Ethical Hacking?
It's essential to ensure that the hacking activities we engage
in are categorized as ethical hacking. While black hat
hacking and ethical hacking share many similarities, certain
guidelines must be followed to distinguish between the two
and ensure the work is ethical.
The primary differentiator between these two forms of
hacking lies in the motivations driving the actions taken.
Black hat hackers are motivated by power, financial gain,
and personal advancement, often seeking to fulfill their self-
serving interests. In contrast, white hat hackers, also known
as ethical hackers, are driven by a desire to protect their
own or their organization's information and data.

So, what criteria must hacking meet to be considered
ethical? Ethical hacking follows specific rules:
1. Explicit Permission: To conduct ethical hacking,
there must be clear and express permission granted
to access the network. Often, this permission is
documented in writing, ensuring that all parties are
aligned regarding the scope and limitations of the
hacking activity. When working on one's own
network, written permission is not required.
2. Respect for Privacy: Ethical hackers must respect
the privacy of the network's owner. They should
maintain 
the 
confidentiality 
of 
vulnerabilities
discovered and share this information solely with
the relevant company or individual, refraining from
publicly disclosing network weaknesses.
3. Complete Work: Once the hacking task is
completed, 
all 
actions 
and 
vulnerabilities
discovered during the process should be diligently
closed out. This ensures that no open doors or
potential vulnerabilities are left for exploitation in
the future.
4. Communication 
with 
Developers: 
If
vulnerabilities are identified within the network,
ethical hackers should promptly notify software
developers or hardware manufacturers responsible
for the products in use. This is especially crucial
when 
the 
company 
is 
unaware 
of 
these
vulnerabilities.
Upon completing the penetration test and related tasks,
ethical hackers should share the findings with the network
owner. They should provide detailed information about
vulnerabilities and discuss potential measures to reduce or
eliminate them, enhancing the network's security.

The term "ethical hacker" has faced criticism over time, with
some arguing that hacking is hacking, regardless of the
actor's motivation. However, the work conducted by ethical
hackers plays a pivotal role in enhancing system security for
numerous companies. Their effectiveness and success in
identifying 
vulnerabilities 
and 
strengthening 
security
measures are evident. Individuals aspiring to become
ethical hackers typically adhere to strict rules and
regulations, often achieving certification as a Certified
Ethical Hacker (CEH) before embarking on their careers.
Understanding Various Types of Hacking
Now that we've delved into the realm of ethical hacking, it's
essential to explore the diverse hacking avenues and
understand the objectives behind each approach. Hacking
comes in various forms, each serving a specific purpose.
Here are some common types of hacking:
Website 
Hacking: 
When 
a 
hacker 
gains
unauthorized access to a website, they essentially take
control of the web server and any associated software,
including databases and interfaces. Their aim is to
manipulate or exploit the web server for their own purposes.
Network Hacking: In network hacking, the hacker
collects information about a network using tools like Netstat
and Tracert. This type of hacking intends to disrupt network
operations and impair its functionality.
Email Hacking: Email hacking involves gaining
unauthorized access to an email account and utilizing it to
send malicious content such as threats or harmful links

without the owner's consent. Caution is necessary when
opening emails to avoid falling victim to hackers.
Malware and Viruses: Hackers often create new
malware and viruses to compromise the security of systems.
Users can inadvertently introduce malware to their systems
by clicking on suspicious links or visiting compromised
websites. Employing reliable antivirus software is essential
to protect your data.
Password Hacking: Password hacking revolves
around retrieving secret passwords stored within a system
or transmitted by it. Hackers employ various methods to
obtain passwords, emphasizing the importance of creating
strong and secure passwords as they form a crucial defense
against unauthorized access.
Key Loggers: Keyloggers are tools hackers use to
record keystrokes on a victim's computer without their
knowledge. This data is then sent back to the hacker, who
can uncover patterns in usernames and passwords, posing a
significant security threat.
Screenshots: 
Screen 
capture, 
another 
method
explored in this guidebook, complements keyloggers. It
allows hackers to monitor websites visited by the user,
providing insights that can be exploited to their advantage.

Man-in-the-Middle Attack: This type of attack
occurs when a hacker convinces network users that they are
legitimate. When data is sent from one computer to
another, it is intercepted by the hacker, who can either
observe the information or manipulate it before forwarding
it to its intended recipient.
Computer Hacking: In computer hacking, the
hacker steals the computer's ID and password through
various hacking techniques to gain unauthorized access to
the system.
While there may be concerns that all hackers are the same,
it's crucial to differentiate between ethical and unethical
hacking. Ethical hackers play a valuable role in enhancing
network security and data protection. They help identify
vulnerabilities 
and 
fortify 
systems 
against 
malicious
hackers, ensuring the safety of valuable data.
