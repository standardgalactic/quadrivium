About the Author
Lisa Sabin-Wilson is a creative designer and owner of E.Webscapes Design 
Studio (www.ewebscapes.com) and has worked hard at providing her cli-
ents with custom designed WordPress blogs and Web sites since 2003. Lisa 
is a frequent speaker at WordCamps and other national conferences, such 
as South by Southwest Interactive and meet ups local to her Southeastern 
Wisconsin home, like Milwaukee’s Web development group, Web414. Lisa 
is highly regarded as a WordPress expert who specializes in helping users 
take full control over their Web publishing efforts through the use of the 
WordPress platform. She reaches thousands of people worldwide with her 
WordPress services, skills, and experience.
Lisa is the author of the popular WordPress For Dummies, fi rst published in 
2007. Her experience and knowledge of BuddyPress came from the rapidly 
emerging popularity of the platform; as more and more of her own clients 
started requesting BuddyPress integration on their Web sites, Lisa had no 
choice but to dig right in and fi gure out what it was all about! She’s glad she 
did — it’s a dynamic addition to any WordPress-powered Web site.
Lisa operates a few blogs online, all of which are powered by WordPress. Her 
personal blog (lisasabin-wilson.com) has been online since February 
of 2002 and her design business, E.Webscapes (ewebscapes.com), has 
been online since 1999. She also operates a successful Web hosting service, 
BlogsAbout Hosting (blogsabout.com), which caters to blogs and bloggers 
on a global scale, with an emphasis on WordPress users.
When she is not designing, or consulting with her clients, you can usually 
fi nd her either at her favorite coffee shop sipping espresso, on a mountaintop 
somewhere hitting the slopes with her family, or 100 feet beneath the ocean 
waters, scuba diving with her husband and swimming with the fi shes.
Lisa is actively involved in online social communities and you can fi nd her on

Dedication
My family deserves all of the credit, for their love, support, and encourage-
ment. My husband, Chris Wilson, gets an extra mention for being my rock 
and my reliable sounding board.


Author’s Acknowledgments
When people use free and open software for community use, the people that 
spend countless hours and days developing the software sometimes get 
lost in the excitement. Because BuddyPress is incapable of running without 
the WordPress MU software, the fi rst kudos go out to Matt Mullenweg, the 
founder of WordPress, and Donncha OCaoimh, the lead developer of the 
WordPress MU platform.
Andy Peatling is the lead developer of the BuddyPress project and has 
been the driving force behind development and community involvement. 
BuddyPress is truly a project driven by the community; Andy, and his team in 
the BuddyPress Forums (http://buddypress.org/forums), really does 
listen to user feedback, testers, and reports to improve existing features — 
and build new ones — for BuddyPress. Andy is also my technical editor for 
this book, so special thanks to him for keeping me on track.
To every WordPress and BuddyPress plugin developer and theme designer 
who donates his or her time, skills, and knowledge to provide the user com-
munity with invaluable tools that help us create dynamic Web sites, thank 
you a million times! And to the hundreds of volunteers and testers who 
destroy all those pesky pre-release bugs for each and every new version 
release — your time and efforts are so very appreciated.
Special thanks to Amy Fandrei, my acquisitions editor — an author could 
not ask for a better, or more supportive, publishing partner. Big thanks to 
Chris Morris, Brian Walls, and other editors from Wiley Publishing who were 
involved in this project for their support, assistance, and guidance.
To my family and friends, some of whom I have neglected during the process 
of writing this book, thank you for not abandoning me. Also, to my clients, 
many of whom showed incredible patience and encouragement during the 
months of writing these chapters.
Finally, thanks to my family — my husband, Chris; my son, Ben; my daughter, 
Melissa and my parents, Don and Penny Sabin — for their support for this 
book, and in life.

BuddyPress For Dummies

Introduction
B
uddyPress allows users to create their own social community on their 
Web site. BuddyPress entered the scene and began to gain attention 
in the blogging community during the summer of 2008, and brought a suite 
of plugins and add-ons to the very popular blogging platform, WordPress. 
Today, anyone can host a social community on their own Web site through 
the combined use of WordPress and BuddyPress. The really good news is 
that you can accomplish this on your own Web site for the cost of exactly 
nothing. BuddyPress is free, open-source software that you can download, 
install, and begin building your own social community on the Web today. 
Whoever said, “nothing in life is free” hasn’t met the folks behind the 
BuddyPress and WordPress software development!
Social communities on the Web are all the rave today. They started with sites 
like MySpace (www.myspace.com) and Facebook (www.facebook.com), 
where people can go to the Web site, join, and immediately start connecting 
with other people who share similar interests, hobbies, ideas, and talents. 
These communities allow you to share photos, music, videos, news, informa-
tion, and even personal anecdotes about you and your life. You’re able to net-
work with other people from around the world who share the same interests 
as you through searching for them, joining groups and discussion forums, 
and then creating friendships so that you can keep track of and stay in touch 
with the people you’ve met. Social communities are an event on the Internet 
in a room that’s never empty and in which the party never ends.
BuddyPress isn’t a stand-alone program; it requires the use of the WordPress 
software. This means that you have to be running WordPress on your Web 
site before you can add the BuddyPress component. WordPress is an insanely 
popular (and free) blogging platform that’s open source, easy to install, and 
used to power the content management of your Web site. After you install 
WordPress, you can add BuddyPress and start building a community. As 
you’ll find in the pages of this book, BuddyPress is easy to install and gets 
your site up and running in a very short amount of time.
Niche communities are popping up all over the Web. These communities 
encourage social groups that focus on specific topics, ideas, and talents to 
share information and enable community members to network with one
another, regardless of geographical location. By using BuddyPress on a
WordPress-powered site, the possibilities of social networking on the Internet 
are endless! Political groups, environmental groups, businesses large and 

2
BuddyPress For Dummies 
small, knitting groups, bowling groups, sports groups . . . any special interest 
group of any kind can build a community space on the Web where people 
with the same interests can connect, discuss, and share.
BuddyPress, with WordPress, gives you several features that will make your 
community very attractive to visitors and members, including the following:
 
✓ Extended Profiles: Members can fill in bits of information that let other 
members of the community get to know them better.
 
✓ Avatars: Members can upload a photo of themselves to display on their 
profile and various areas of the community.
 
✓ Friends: Members can connect by sending and accepting friendship 
requests and creating a list of friends within your community.
 
✓ Private Messages: Members can send and receive private messages 
from their friends within your community.
 
✓ Activity Streams: A display of all your activity within the community, such 
as comments, blog posts, friendships, wire posts, and group activity.
 
✓ Blog Tracking: A display of blog posts that a member has made on his 
blog(s) within the community.
 
✓ Forums: Allows community members to create and manage their own 
discussion forums.
 
✓ Community Blogs: Using WordPress MU, users are able to create and 
manage their own blog within the community.
The really nice thing about the BuddyPress features is that you can use only 
the ones you want. You don’t have to use all the available features — you can 
disable the ones you don’t think you’ll need and use only the ones you want. 
BuddyPress is flexible enough to help you create and customize your own 
social community.
This book presents an in-depth look at the BuddyPress platform and integrat-
ing BuddyPress into your existing WordPress-powered Web site. I cover the 
basics of setting up the WordPress software on your Web site as a foundation;
however, if you need more comprehensive information on how to use Word
Press, you might want to pick up a copy of my other book, WordPress For 
Dummies.
BuddyPress For Dummies, like all For Dummies books, focuses on you, the 
user — in this case it focuses on how you can build a social community on 
your Web site using the WordPress platform. This book does not cover PHP 
or MySQL programming, nor will it turn you into a WordPress or BuddyPress 
developer (for that, you might want to pick up The WordPress Bible by Aaron 
Brazell, published by Wiley). What this book will do is take you step-by-step

things. Throughout this book, you can count on a consistent set of typography 
conventions I’ve used to help guide you through the information presented:
 
✓ When I ask you to type something on your computer, you’ll see the text I 
want you to type printed in bold.
 
✓ When I suggest a keyword or phrase that you may want to type in a 
search engine, the keyword or phrase is printed in italics.
 
✓ Text that appears in this special font is sure to be a URL (Web 
address), e-mail address, filename, folder name, or snippet of code.
 
✓ When I feel the need to define a word that I think you might not be 
familiar with, the word appears in italic text to let you know that I go on 
to define it next.
What You Are Not to Read
BuddyPress For Dummies is meant to assist and guide you through the 
mechanics of using and setting up BuddyPress and the various features of 
the BuddyPress platform on your Web site to build your successful social 
community. It isn’t meant to be read from cover to cover. Rather, the infor-
mation is organized in a logical order and presented in such a way that you 
can jump from one section to another to enable you to take what you need, 
and leave the rest for your neighbor.
Although this book doesn’t contain extensive coverage of the WordPress 
platform, Wiley Publishing offers two books that comprehensively cover 
the use of WordPress. WordPress For Dummies, by (yours truly) Lisa Sabin-
Wilson, focuses on the beginner-to-intermediate level WordPress user; and the 
WordPress Bible, by Aaron Brazell, goes in-depth on WordPress development,

 Introduction
including plugin and theme development with the more advanced WordPress 
user in mind.
Visit the Table of Contents to discover the content covered in this book and 
flip to the pages that discuss the topic you need the most assistance with. 
For example, if you need the basics on setting up the WordPress foundation 
of your Web site, be sure to read Chapters 2 and 3, but if you already have 
WordPress set up on your Web server, you can skip Chapter 2.
If you need more of an introduction to the BuddyPress platform, be sure to 
read Chapter 1; then move on to Part II to discover the steps you take to set 
up the software and begin configuring the available options and features.
If you want to customize your BuddyPress-powered site with a really cool 
visual design and layout, then make sure you head to Part IV, “Customizing 
BuddyPress,” in which you discover the default BuddyPress themes and 
information on how to customize the themes with HTML and CSS.
In a nutshell, you’re safe to take what you need from this book and apply your 
new knowledge to your BuddyPress community. Then pass on your new found 
knowledge to your friends and wow them with your supreme geekiness!
Foolish Assumptions
I try not to make assumptions about people I’ve never met; however, for the 
purpose of this book, I have made a few assumptions about you:
 
✓ You have access to a computer — PC or Mac, this book covers both.
 
✓ Your computer has access to the Internet.
 
✓ You know how to type on a keyboard.
 
✓ You have a basic understanding of what blogs are and how they work.
 
✓ You know what WordPress is and have some basic experience with 
using the platform to run and maintain a blog or Web site on the 
Internet.
I’ve also assumed that you have a big interest in learning how you can create 
and maintain a social community on your Web site using the BuddyPress plat-
form. If I’m right on that assumption, then you are definitely in the right place!

BuddyPress For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
BuddyPress For Dummies is organized into 6 parts that encompass 17 chapters 
of information you need to know in order to use the BuddyPress platform.
 
✓ Part I: Introducing BuddyPress gives you an introduction of the 
BuddyPress platform and the advantages you will find in using it to 
build a social community of users on your Web site. In this part, you 
discover the tools you need to run BuddyPress on your Web site, includ-
ing domain registration, obtaining a Web hosting provider, and using 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to transfer the necessary software files. 
Additionally, this part introduces you to the basics of the WordPress MU 
software requirements that need to be in place before you can install the 
BuddyPress platform on your Web site. This part also includes a basic 
run through of the WordPress dashboard and options, once you have 
WordPress installed and running on your Web server.
 
✓ Part II: Getting Up and Running with BuddyPress introduces you to 
the methods of installing BuddyPress on your WordPress-powered site: 
auto-installation with the WordPress plugin installer, or manual instal-
lation with BuddyPress by downloading the software and using FTP to 
upload it to your Web server. This part gives you a full understanding of 
the directory structure of the BuddyPress software files. In this part, you 
configure BuddyPress, set up the components you want to use within 
your social community, and set up the profile fields for your community 
members.
 
✓ Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features takes you through all the 
exciting BuddyPress features that will make your social community a 
smashing success with your visitors. You explore how your users will 
benefit from such features as community registration, extended profiles 
and avatars, friendships, private messages, activity streams, community 
blogs, searchable directories, groups, and forums.
 
✓ Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress introduces you to BuddyPress themes 
and template tags that you can use to create a visual display that is indi-
vidualized and unique to your community. Although BuddyPress comes 
bundled with nicely designed default themes to get you going right 
away, you’ll find information on basic CSS and HTML that will help you 
tweak an existing free BuddyPress theme that you are using, or help you 
create your own custom theme. This part also takes you through the 
differences between the BuddyPress Home theme and the BuddyPress 
Member theme.

7
 Introduction
 
✓ Part V: Extending BuddyPress gives you the opportunity to explore how 
you can add different features to your BuddyPress community through 
third-party plugins developed by BuddyPress and WordPress community 
members. This part introduces you to the methods of finding, downloading, 
installing, and using BuddyPress plugins on your Web site. Additionally, 
this part also shows you how you can integrate other popular social 
network sites and communities (say Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube) in 
your own BuddyPress-powered community.
 
✓ Part VI: The Part of Tens is a staple in all For Dummies books. This Part 
of Tens explores real world examples of BuddyPress implementations 
on the Web so you can see how others are using the software to run suc-
cessful communities. This part also explores some popular BuddyPress 
plugins and themes that will help you extend your BuddyPress site and 
create a community that will receive rave reviews from your members!
 
 The Appendix covers some information for the true geeks out there! 
BuddyPress gives you the chance to use cutting-edge versions of their 
software before it releases to the public. This Appendix covers where to 
find a program called SVN (Subversion) to update your BuddyPress 
version to the latest cutting-edge (Beta) version.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you can’t miss the little icons that appear in the mar-
gins that spotlight certain points I want to emphasize. They highlight items 
you need to remember, warnings you need to be aware of, technical advice, 
and “how-tos” or tips that I think will really help you on your way. Here’s 
what to expect when you see these icons throughout the pages of this book.
 
This icon appears next to information that I think you’ll find very useful — 
advice and gems of information that I’ve discovered in my experiences with 
the BuddyPress software.
 
This icon looks like a little bomb for a reason! You definitely need to pay atten-
tion to these items because they contain information on things you should be 
doing — or not doing — when setting up and using the BuddyPress software.
 
This icon flags important points that I want you to remember while you set up 
and use your BuddyPress/WordPress-powered Web site. When I use this icon, 
I want you to read it two or three times and brand it into your brain forever 
and ever.

BuddyPress For Dummies 
 
Let’s face it, building Web sites, blogs, and social communities is kind of a 
geeky adventure. I use this icon to point out some technical mumbo jumbo — 
the sort of technical information that geeks love — that might be helpful while 
you set up your social community empire.
Where to Go From Here
I think I’ve gone on enough to give you a good understanding of what this 
book contains — it’s time to get started! This book is a handy reference guide 
that contains information, tips, ideas, concepts, and tools that you need to 
start using BuddyPress. As I mention in the “What You Are Not to Read” sec-
tion, thumb through the Index or the Table of Contents to find the sections 
that you feel will be most helpful to you. You can find this book’s Cheat Sheet

Chapter 1
A New Friend Named BuddyPress
In This Chapter
▶ Building a community-driven Web site with BuddyPress
▶ Creating communities for niche industries
▶ Discovering the benefits of BuddyPress
▶ Laying the WordPress foundation
▶ Exploring the BuddyPress community
T
he popularity of social communities on the Web is undeniable. If you 
picked up this book, most likely, you’re already familiar with WordPress. 
WordPress has created the world’s most popular blogging platform (no 
kidding, the world’s!), allowing millions of users all over the globe to freely 
publish content on the Internet and invite others to join the discussion. 
BuddyPress, introduced to the WordPress community in 2008, was the next 
logical step, enabling bloggers to expand their Web sites to include a social 
community for their visitors to participate in.
This chapter explores why you want to create a social community on your 
Web site and the benefits of using the BuddyPress platform to accomplish that 
goal. Because BuddyPress integrates with the WordPress blogging platform, 
you also discover some of the BuddyPress features that work in tandem with 
WordPress MU, such as member blogs and blog tracking features.
Building a Social Community 
with BuddyPress
Social communities are all over the Web today. One very popular example is 
Facebook (http://facebook.com). Facebook launched in 2004 and today 
is the largest and most popular social network on the Web, with more than 
250 million users (and growing). Before getting into details of building your 

12
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
own social community with the BuddyPress platform, have a look at a few 
impressive statistics about Facebook (see Figure 1-1).
 
✓ More than 120 million users log in to Facebook at least once a day.
 
✓ The average Facebook user has 120 friends on the site.
 
✓ More than 1 billion photos are uploaded to Facebook each month.
 
✓ More than 10 million videos are shared on Facebook each month.
 
✓ More than 45 million active user groups exist on Facebook.
 
✓ The fastest growing demographic on Facebook are those 35 years old or 
older.
Those are some impressive statistics, no? You might be asking why I’m shar-
ing Facebook stats (www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics) 
in a book about BuddyPress. The answer is simple: They illustrate the 
extreme popularity of social communities and the availability of a network 
where people can connect, share, and interact with others via a computer 
connected to the Internet.

 Chapter 1: A New Friend Named BuddyPress
BuddyPress allows you to create a very similar type of social community 
on your own WordPress-powered Web site and helps you take your existing 
Web site to the next level by allowing your visitors to become members. A 
BuddyPress social community gives its members a handful of core features 
that are easy to set up and allows them to immediately connect with other 
members of the community. Members can have extensive profiles that con-
tain personal biographical information that allows other members to find out 
more about them. Members share with other members any information they 
want, from personal information and news to Web site links, photos, videos, 
music, and more.
Why build a social community?
In March 2009, I attended a conference in Austin, Texas, called South by 
Southwest Interactive where geeks from all over the world gather for one 
weekend to network and discover the new, exciting, and innovative Internet 
trends and technologies. I attend this conference annually, and there is 
always a buzz about the major trend for that year. The buzz phrase at South 
by Southwest in 2009 was, “It’s all about the conversation.” The Web has 
become more than just a place to obtain information today; it has become a 
place to share information and connect with other people through ongoing 
conversations through different types of social media. Social communities 
give people the opportunity to be the media rather than just be consumers of 
the media.
One nice benefit to Facebook is its size — almost everyone I know has a 
Facebook account and I can find them there, add them as a friend, and con-
nect with them easily (and probably more often than I would off the com-
puter). A negative aspect of Facebook is that all the content shared on that 
site is stored on that site. Therefore, for people to find the source of the 
information they are seeking, they end up on the Facebook Web site, rather 
than your site; and the point of having a Web site is to build content that 
people want to read and consume.
Your Web site isn’t generic, is it? Of course not! More than likely, your Web 
site is about something — a specific topic, product, or service. BuddyPress 
gives you the opportunity to open up your Web site for members to join your 
community and engage in discussions about topics that you’re passionate 
about; so passionate that you started a Web site. You aren’t the only one 
in the world with a passion for your particular topic — inviting others who 
share your passion to join your community will benefit you and your mem-
bers by allowing the entire group to share advice, tips, and connections.

14
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
Types of people who build 
social communities
It’s been said that there’s a blog on the Internet for every possible topic that 
you can think of, and it’s true! There are blogs about politics, education, 
media, technology, beauty, Hollywood, arts and crafts, designing, health and 
medicine, and news, just to name several. If you can think of a topic — I bet 
there’s a blog about it.
These topical blogs function in the way you would suspect them to: The blog 
owner publishes articles and content that he or she thinks readers will find 
interesting; then visitors to the site are invited to participate in the discus-
sion of the articles through blog comments.
Web site owners who want to take the interactivity on their site a few steps fur-
ther can now build a social community where visitors to the Web site can create 
a membership and become part of the content and conversation. In addition to 
leaving comments on the articles, members can write their own articles, share 
more information, and participate in the site as a full contributor rather than just 
a visitor. Members can benefit from networking and connecting with other mem-
bers within the community as well. Here are a few examples of the types of com-
munities I’m talking about, all built with the BuddyPress/WordPress platform. (In 
Chapter 17, I give ten real-world examples of BuddyPress in action.)
 
✓ Tasty Kitchen (http://thepioneerwoman.com/tasty-kitchen): An 
active social community of members who like to cook.
 
✓ Gigaom Pro (http://pro.gigaom.com): A network of analysts provid-
ing technology-related research papers and notes.
 
✓ VWTankWars (http://tdi.vw.com): By Volkswagen, a network of VW 
TDI drivers working to make a world record mileage score.
Businesses large and small benefit from adding a social community compo-
nent to their Web sites by gaining the ability to invite their customers, or 
potential customers, to participate in the discussion about their business.
Political movements are ripe for social community involvement because they 
encourage the sharing of ideas and news, and the involvement in causes. Some 
would say that the success of Barack Obama’s campaign for President of the 
United States was aided tremendously by the very energetic and active social 
community of voters on the Internet. Barack Obama’s campaign Web site was 
a social community of voters and potential voters, whose thoughts and ideas 
helped to shape a good portion of Obama’s campaign. The success of that social 
movement on the Internet is undeniable, no matter which way your politics fall.
Other niche industries and communities can experience the same type of 
success when they gather people in one environment on the Internet — it’s 
all about listening to the conversation that develops!

 Chapter 1: A New Friend Named BuddyPress
Discovering the Benefits of BuddyPress
Working with the BuddyPress software since July 2008, I can attest to the 
rapid (and wonderful) development that takes place to improve BuddyPress. 
BuddyPress is constantly improving the software and introducing exciting 
new and useful features with each new release. If you spend time on the 
official BuddyPress Web site at http://buddypress.org (see Figure 1-2), 
you’ll find that the development of the platform is community-driven; that is, 
the community suggests ideas and wish lists for new features, and the devel-
opers of the BuddyPress software do their best to answer the call. Imagine a 
software company, say Microsoft, driving the development of its operating 
system in such a manner: The world would be a better place! It’s exciting to 
be part of a development community that is so responsive to its users.
 
Figure 1-2: 
The official 
BuddyPress 
Web site.
 
Aside from the exciting pace and quality of development, BuddyPress also 
offers the following advantages to users who wish to create a social commu-
nity on their Web site:
 
✓ WordPress MU: BuddyPress plugs right into the WordPress MU plat-
form. WordPress is very easy to set up and use, even for the novice Web 
site developer.
 
✓ Ease of use: BuddyPress is easy to install and set up; you don’t need to 
be a major geek or programmer to accomplish these tasks.
 
✓ Flexibility: BuddyPress offers a suite of plugins for WordPress that 
you can choose from. You can choose to use all of them or just a few of 
them.
 
✓ Extensibility: Using plugins and themes, you can customize BuddyPress 
to suit your needs.
 
✓ Community: As I’ve already mentioned, the BuddyPress community is a 
very active adjunct to the already huge and active WordPress commu-
nity. Finding assistance and camaraderie is just a mouse click away!

16
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
The following sections will quench your curiosity with more details on these 
features and point you to the various places in this book where you can find 
more detailed information.
WordPress as the foundation
You’re probably aware of how easy the WordPress blogging platform (see 
Figure 1-3) makes creating a blog or Web site. Millions of users blog on 
WordPress (http://wordpress.org), a proven success in Web publish-
ing and content management. Using such a solid and successful platform 
as WordPress for the foundation of your new social community (built with 
BuddyPress) is a formula for success because WordPress makes managing 
and maintaining a Web site very easy.
 
Three different versions of the WordPress software currently exist, as follows:
 
✓ WordPress.com: This is the hosted version.
 
✓ WordPress.org: This is the single user, self-hosted version.
 
✓ WordPress MU: This is the multi-user version.
 
Figure 1-3: 
The official 
WordPress 
Web site.
 

17
 Chapter 1: A New Friend Named BuddyPress
Currently, the only version that is compatible with BuddyPress is the 
WordPress MU version. WordPress.com and WordPress.org do not have the 
ability to host the features of BuddyPress right now, although that may cer-
tainly change in the future. When I refer to WordPress in this book, I am refer-
ring to WordPress MU, the multiple user version of the software. You will find 
a great deal of information about WordPress MU in Chapters 2 and 3.
The WordPress platform gives you a great foundation for your social commu-
nity with the following features:
 
✓ Multiple member blogs
 
✓ Articles organized by topic
 
✓ Content archived by month and year
 
✓ Categorized link lists
 
✓ Interactive comments
 
✓ Privacy controls
 
✓ Built-in RSS feed syndication
 
✓ Easy management of media files, such as photos, video, and music
 
✓ Hundreds of plugins and themes to extend your Web site
Once you have WordPress running on your site, you’re more than halfway 
toward building a social community. Adding the BuddyPress suite of plugins 
gives you the ability to extend additional features to your visitors that allow 
them to join your site’s community and create a full-featured member profile; 
create a blog on your site; and create groups, forums, photo albums, and more.
 
I mention in the Introduction that BuddyPress For Dummies is not a guide on 
using the WordPress software, but rather a book about adding the BuddyPress 
platform onto an existing WordPress-powered site. Although Chapters 2 and 3 
of this book explore the basics of getting WordPress running on your site, this 
book assumes a certain level of existing familiarity with WordPress. You might 
also want to pick up my other book, WordPress For Dummies for more in-depth 
information on running WordPress on your Web site.
With WordPress, you already have a blog or Web site where you’re publish-
ing content and inviting visitors to join in the discussion by providing the 
opportunity for feedback on your content through comments. WordPress 
also gives you an extended Multi User option where you can invite visitors to 
join your site and create their own blog on your domain. You can choose to 
run only one blog (yours), or enable the options that allow your community 
members to create blogs of their own on your domain. A WordPress-powered 
blog with the multiple blog option enabled is typically referred to as a blog 
network because it creates a directory of different blogs written by different 
authors on a variety of topics, all hosted on your Web site.

18
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
 
One important thing to take away from this section is that BuddyPress 
requires the WordPress MU platform in order to work. That is, you cannot use 
BuddyPress if you aren’t already using WordPress MU.
Be sure to read Chapters 2 and 3 for more information on the WordPress 
platform, including how to install WordPress on your Web server to lay the 
foundation for building your BuddyPress social community.
BuddyPress is easy to use
One of the most attractive features of the WordPress and BuddyPress platforms 
is the ease in which you can install, set up, and use the platform to manage and 
maintain your Web site. You don’t need to be a certified geek or programmer to 
get BuddyPress up and running, as Chapters 2, 3, and 4 show you. Even someone 
new to WordPress and BuddyPress can have a full-featured Web site, blog, and 
social community up and running in a relatively short period.
WordPress has bragging rights to a 5-minute installation (see Chapter 2), and 
BuddyPress takes even less time to install. Setting up the options for the vari-
ous BuddyPress features is transparent and easy — just use the WordPress 
dashboard to configure the feature options. Check out Chapter 3 for a guided 
tour through the WordPress dashboard to help familiarize yourself with the 
lay of the land.
Check out Chapter 4 for the steps to install BuddyPress and an exploration of 
the BuddyPress configuration options.
BuddyPress is flexible to your needs
BuddyPress is an extensive suite of plugins that allows you to create the fol-
lowing features within your social community:
 
✓ Extended member profiles: These include shared personal information 
about each member of your community.
 
✓ Member avatars: This feature allows your members to upload a unique 
personal photo.
 
✓ Member and site activity streams: A listing of member actions and 
activities throughout your community.
 
✓ Activity wires: A place where members can leave comments and mes-
sages for other members and groups in a public manner.
 
✓ Member groups: Community members can gather together in groups 
based on topics and interests.

19
 Chapter 1: A New Friend Named BuddyPress
 
✓ Member forums: Members can create and participate in topic-related 
discussions with other members.
 
✓ Blog tracking: A listing of blog activity throughout your community, 
including new blog posts and comments.
 
✓ Searchable member, blog, and group directories: Search through 
member lists, group lists, and blogs to find specific information you are 
looking for.
 
✓ Member status updates: Short but sweet updates members can share 
that answer the basic question: What am I doing right now?
You might find that you don’t want or need to use all the features that 
BuddyPress has to offer, and that’s okay. You don’t have to use them just 
because they exist. BuddyPress allows you to use only what you need — you 
can even delete extraneous features completely if you don’t want to use them — 
enabling you to tailor your BuddyPress community to your liking.
Chapters 5 through 8 provide an in-depth exploration of each BuddyPress 
feature to assist you in choosing the ones you want to use. Use them all, or 
use just one — the choice is completely yours.
Extending BuddyPress capabilities
As I mention at the beginning of this section, the BuddyPress development 
community is very active and constantly striving to improve the BuddyPress 
experience for both site owners and community members. Not only are 
development community members active and involved with the development 
of the BuddyPress software, but several members of the BuddyPress devel-
opment crew also work to create BuddyPress plugins and themes.
BuddyPress plugins are additional pieces of software that, by themselves, would 
not work or do you any good. Combine them with BuddyPress and WordPress, 
however, and you can extend the functionality of your BuddyPress-powered 
social community to bring additional fun and exciting features to your users.
Using BuddyPress plugins, you can
 
✓ Integrate elements of popular social media sites, such as YouTube 
videos, into your community.
 
✓ Allow users to add Twitter feeds to their member profiles and activity 
wires.

20
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
 
✓ Integrate Facebook content into your BuddyPress community.
 
✓ Extend search engine optimization (SEO) enhancements to further 
improve the visibility of your BuddyPress social community in popular 
search engines, such as Google and Yahoo!.
These features aren’t built into the BuddyPress platform, but you can add 
them by downloading and installing BuddyPress plugins. Chapters 13 and 14 
provide you with the information needed to add these additional plugins and 
features to your site.
Another way to extend your BuddyPress social community is to custom-
ize the look and layout of your site with BuddyPress themes and templates. 
BuddyPress comes packaged with themes for you to use. Figure 1-4 shows 
the BuddyPress Default theme, but you can also use the BuddyPress Classic 
theme, which is shown in Figure 1-5.
 
The BuddyPress default themes include all the basic elements that you need 
when starting a new BuddyPress social community on your Web site. You 
can extend your community in several ways by using the plugins and themes 
released by members of the BuddyPress community, but these default themes 
are an easy way to get started.

Chapters 9 through 12 provide you with information on how to customize 
your BuddyPress theme, including
 
✓ Finding, downloading, and installing free themes created by members of 
the BuddyPress development community
 
✓ Using HTML and CSS to customize the design and layout of your existing 
themes
 
✓ Using BuddyPress widgets to provide your site visitors with easy naviga-
tion features
 
✓ Creating a custom BuddyPress theme from scratch by understanding 
BuddyPress theme structure, template tags, and functions
Taking part in the BuddyPress community
The BuddyPress community was born from the larger WordPress commu-
nity, which makes sense because BuddyPress is a component that you can 
add to the WordPress platform. WordPress is already a very large and active 
community of developers, designers, and users on the Web, full of people 
who are very passionate about the WordPress project. That excitement and 
passion has continued in the BuddyPress community — and the BuddyPress 
community is growing in numbers each day.

22
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
Why is this important information to know? As a user of the BuddyPress 
platform, it’s nice to know that you have support out there when you need 
it. WordPress and BuddyPress are very much a “users helping users” com-
munity. Users from all over the world bring different levels of experience 
and knowledge to the community and freely share their experiences, tips, 
and advice with other users. This kind of grassroots involvement made 
WordPress the extreme success it is today.
You might be asking yourself, “Where do I find this passionate group of 
BuddyPress users?” Answer:
 
✓ http://buddypress.org: The official BuddyPress Web site where you 
can browse for news and information; click the Sign Up button at the top 
right of that site to become a member and start participating in the shar-
ing and discussions that go on there.
 
✓ http://buddypress.org/forums: The support forums for 
BuddyPress where you find official BuddyPress developers and 
BuddyPress users and community members sharing their knowledge, 
information, and experiences with other BuddyPress users.
 
✓ http://buddypress.org/developers: The BuddyPress developers 
community — and you don’t need to be a developer to join and partici-
pate. You find extremely helpful information and resources that help 
you on your way to building and maintaining a BuddyPress social com-
munity on your Web site.
 
✓ http://twitter.com/buddypressdev: Are you a Twitter user? Then 
follow @BuddyPressDev on Twitter; they always update their Twitter 
stream with information about new BuddyPress releases and features.

W
ith three distinctly different versions of the WordPress blogging 
platform — WordPress.com, the hosted version; WordPress.org, the 
self-hosted version; and WordPress MU, the multi-user version — it’s easy to 
get confused about which one you need to use under certain circumstances. 
Because you intend to use the BuddyPress suite of plugins on a WordPress-
powered Web site to build a social community, the version of WordPress that 
you must use is the WordPress MU platform, which can be found at http://
mu.wordpress.org.
Before you can set up your social community with BuddyPress, you first lay 
the foundation of the WordPress MU software. MU stands for multiple user, 
which means the platform allows you to host multiple user blogs on your 
domain.
Two things to consider prior to downloading and installing WordPress: You 
need to register a domain name (your Web site’s Web address) and you need 
to obtain Web hosting services (the place that houses your Web site data).
This chapter starts by taking you through the steps to register your domain 
name and obtain Web hosting services. When installing WordPress on your 
domain, you transfer the software files to your hosting account through a 
method called File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which I cover in the “Using File 

24
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
Transfer Protocol” section. Finally, I show you how to install the WordPress 
platform and get it running on your own domain so that you can get going 
with BuddyPress.
 
When I refer to WordPress in this book (particularly in this chapter), I’m 
referring to the WordPress MU (multiple user) platform, unless otherwise 
noted. At some point in mid-2010, the WordPress developers plan to merge 
the code base of the regular WordPress.org (self-hosted) code with the 
existing WordPress MU code base — when that happens, only one version 
of WordPress will be available for download. Until then, in order to use 
BuddyPress, you must use the correct version: WordPress MU available at 
http://mu.wordpress.org.
Understanding Web Site 
Development Tools
The first things every Web site owner needs to do is to select and register 
a domain name. A domain name is the unique Web address that you type in 
a Web browser’s address bar to visit a Web site. Some examples of domain 
names are WordPress.org and Google.com.
 
I emphasize the word unique because no two domain names can be the same. 
If someone has registered the domain name you want, you can’t have it. With 
that in mind, finding an available domain name sometimes takes a bit of time. 
You have options, of course. You can contact the owner of the domain name 
to find out whether it’s for sale and the cost. With this approach, however, 
chances are good that you’ll pay way more for that domain name versus a 
domain name available through a domain registrar.
Domain names: Do you own or rent?
When you “buy” a domain name, you don’t 
really own it. Rather, you purchase the right 
to use the domain name for a specified period. 
You can register a domain name for one year 
or up to ten years. Be aware, however, that if 
you don’t renew the domain name when your 
registration period ends, you lose it — and most 
often, you lose it right away to someone who 
preys on abandoned or expired domain names. 
Some people keep a close watch on expir-
ing domain names, and as soon as the buying 
window opens, they snap the names up and 
start using them for their own Web sites, with 
the hope of taking full advantage of the popular-
ity that the previous owners worked so hard to 
attain for those domains.

25
 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
Understanding domain name extensions
When registering a domain name, be aware of the extension that you want. 
The .com, .net, .org, .info, or .biz extension that you see tagged onto 
the end of any domain name is the top-level domain extension. When you reg-
ister your domain name, you’re asked to choose the extension you want for 
your domain (as long as it’s available, that is).
A word to the wise here: Just because you register your domain as a .com 
doesn’t mean that someone else doesn’t, or can’t, own the very same domain 
name with a .net. So if you register MyDogHasFleas.com, and it becomes a 
hugely popular site among readers with dogs that have fleas, someone else 
can come along and register MyDogHasFleas.net, and run a similar site to 
yours in the hope of riding the coattails of your Web site’s popularity and 
readership.
You can register your domain name with all available extensions if you want 
to avert this problem. My business Web site, for example, has the domain 
name EWebscapes.com; however, I also own EWebscapes.net, EWebscapes.
biz, and EWebscapes.info.
Considering the cost of a domain name
Registering a domain costs you anywhere from $3 to $30 per year, depend-
ing on what service you use and what options (such as privacy options and 
search-engine submission services) you apply to your domain name during 
the registration process.
 
When you pay the domain registration fee, you’ll pay another registration fee 
when the renewal date comes up again in a year, or two, or five — however 
many years you chose to register your domain name for. (See the “Domain 
names: Do you own or rent?” sidebar.) Most registrars give you the option of 
signing up for an Auto Renew service. This service automatically renews your 
domain name and charges the credit card you set up on that account. The 
registrar sends you a reminder a few months in advance, telling you it’s time 
to renew. If you don’t set up Auto Renew, you’ll need to log in to your registrar 
account before it expires and manually renew your domain name. The Auto 
Renew service does not cost extra; however, be aware that choosing this 
option means that the registrar will automatically bill your credit card for your 
domain renewal when the time comes.

26
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
Registering your domain name
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) certifies 
and approves domain registrars. Although hundreds of domain registrars 
exist, the ones in the following list are popular because of their longevity in 
the industry, competitive pricing, and variety of services they offer in addi-
tion to domain name registration (such as Web hosting and Web site traffic 
builders):
 
✓ GoDaddy: http://GoDaddy.com
 
✓ Register.com: http://register.com
 
✓ Network Solutions: http://networksolutions.com
 
✓ NamesDirect: http://namesdirect.com
No matter where you choose to register your domain name, here are the 
steps you take to accomplish this task:
 
1. Decide on a domain name.
 
 Do a little planning and forethought here. Many people think of a domain 
name as a brand — a way of identifying their Web sites or blogs. Think of 
potential names for your site, and then proceed with your plan to regis-
ter and use the domain name you’ve chosen for your Web site.
 
2. Verify the domain name’s availability.
 
 In your Web browser, enter the URL of the domain registrar of your 
choice. Look for the section on the registrar’s Web site that lets you 
enter the domain name (typically, a short text field) to see whether 
it’s available. If the domain name isn’t available as a .com, try .net or 
.info.
 
3. Purchase the domain name.
 
 Follow the domain registrar’s steps to purchase the name using your 
credit card. After you complete the checkout process, you receive an 
e-mail confirming your purchase, so be sure to use a valid e-mail address 
during the registration process.
The next step is obtaining a hosting account, which I cover in the next 
section.
 
Some of the domain registrars have hosting services that you can sign up 
for, but you don’t have to use those services. Often, you can find hosting ser-
vices for a lower cost than most domain registrars offer. It just takes a little 
research.

27
 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
Finding a Home for Your Blog
When you have your domain registered, you need to find a place for it to live — a 
Web host. Web hosting is the second piece of the puzzle that you need to com-
plete before you begin working with WordPress.
A Web host is a business, group, or individual that provides Web server space 
and bandwidth for file transfer to Web site owners who don’t have it. Usually, 
Web hosting services charge a monthly or annual fee — unless you’re for-
tunate enough to know someone who’s willing to give you server space and 
bandwidth free. The cost varies from host to host, but you can obtain quality 
Web hosting services for $3 to $10 per month to start.
Web hosts consider WordPress to be a third-party application. What this 
means to you is that the host typically won’t provide technical support on 
the use of WordPress (or any other software application) because support 
isn’t included in your hosting package. Although most Web hosts attempt to 
assist you with the use of the software, ultimately the responsibility for run-
ning it on your server account is all yours. This condition is one of the big 
reasons why some folks opt to run a WordPress-powered blog on the hosted 
version at WordPress.com. If you choose to go the self-hosted route with the 
WordPress.org software, you can find WordPress help and support in the 
WordPress support forums located at http://wordpress.org/support.
 
Several Web hosting providers also have WordPress-related services available 
for additional fees. These services can include technical support, plugin instal-
lation and configuration, and theme design services.
Hosting services generally provide (at least) these services with your 
account:
 
✓ Hard drive space
 
✓ Bandwidth (transfer)
 
✓ Domain e-mail with Web mail access
 
✓ FTP access
 
✓ Comprehensive Web site statistics
 
✓ MySQL database(s)
 
✓ PHP

28
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
Because you intend to run WordPress on your Web server, you need to look 
for a host that provides the minimum requirements needed to run the soft-
ware on your hosting account, which are
 
✓ PHP version 4.3 (or greater)
 
✓ MySQL version 4.0 (or greater)
Understanding PHP and MySQL
The WordPress software is a personal publishing system that uses a PHP and 
MySQL platform, which provides you with everything you need to create a 
blog without having to know any programming code. In short, all of your con-
tent is stored in a MySQL database on your hosting account.
PHP stands for PHP Hypertext Preprocessor, and it’s a server-side script-
ing language for creating dynamic Web pages. When a visitor opens a page 
built in PHP, the server processes the PHP commands and then sends the 
results to the visitor’s browser. MySQL is an open source relational database 
management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL), 
the most popular language for adding, accessing, and processing data in a 
database. If that all sounds Greek to you, just think of it as a big filing cabinet 
where all the content on you blog is stored.
Every time a visitor goes to your blog to read your content, he makes a 
request that’s sent to your server. The PHP programming language receives 
that request, obtains the requested information from the MySQL database, 
and then presents the requested information to your visitor through his Web 
browser.
In using the term content as it applies to the data that’s stored in the MySQL 
database, I’m referring to your blog posts, comments, and options that you 
set up in the WordPress Administration panel. 
 
The easiest way to find out whether a host meets the minimum requirement is 
to check the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section of the host’s Web site 
if it has one. If not, find the contact information for the hosting company and 
fire off an e-mail requesting information on exactly what it supports. Any Web 
host worth dealing with will answer your e-mail within a reasonable amount of 
time (12–24 hours is a good barometer).
Getting help with hosting WordPress
The popularity of WordPress has given birth to services on the Web that 
emphasize the use of the software. These services include WordPress 

29
 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
designers, WordPress consultants, and — yes — Web hosts that specialize in 
using WordPress.
Many of these hosts offer a full array of WordPress features, such as an 
automatic WordPress installation included with your account, a library of 
WordPress themes, and a staff of support technicians who are very experi-
enced in using WordPress.
Here is a list of some of those providers:
 
✓ Blogs About Hosting: http://blogs-about.com
 
✓ Laughing Squid: http://laughingsquid.net
 
✓ AN Hosting: http://anhosting.com
 
✓ DreamHost: http://dreamhost.com
 
A word about Web hosts and domain registration: A few Web hosting providers 
offer free domain name registration when you sign up for their hosting services. 
Research this topic and dig through those hosting providers’ terms of service 
because that free domain name sometimes comes with a few conditions.
Many of my clients have gone this route only to find out a few months later 
(when they’re unhappy with the unreliable hosting service and want to 
change to another host) that the Web hosting provider has full control of the 
domain name. That is, they can’t move the domain off the host’s servers for 
a set period (usually, a year or two) if ever. I feel that it’s always best to have 
the control in your hands, not someone else’s, so I recommend registering 
your domain name yourself with an independent domain registrar, such as 
GoDaddy.
Dealing with disk space and bandwidth
Web hosting services provide two very important things with your account:
 
✓ Disk space
 
✓ Bandwidth transfer
Think of your Web host as a garage that you pay to park your car in. The 
garage gives you the place to store your car (disk space). It even gives you 
the driveway so that you, and others, can get to and from your car (band-
width). It won’t, however, fix your rockin’ stereo system (WordPress or any 
other third-party software application) that you’ve installed — unless you’re 
willing to pay a few extra bucks for that service.

30
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
Managing disk space
Disk space is no more complicated than the hard drive on your computer. 
Each hard drive has the capacity, or space, for a certain amount of files. An 
80GB (gigabyte) hard drive can hold 80GB of data — no more. Your hosting 
account provides you a limited amount of disk space, and the same concept 
applies. If your Web host provides you 10GB of disk space, that’s the limit 
on the file size that you’re allowed to have. If you want more disk space, you 
need to upgrade your space limitations. Most Web hosts have a mechanism 
in place for you to upgrade your allotment.
Starting with a WordPress blog doesn’t take much disk space at all. A good 
starting point for disk space is between 3–5GB of storage space. If you 
find that you need additional space, contact your hosting provider for an 
upgrade.
 
Time for a public-service announcement: A good Web host has a system in 
place that sends you a warning (via e-mail) when you reach at least 80 percent 
of your total disk space capacity. This warning helps you manage the space 
in your hosting account. With this warning, you can plan on either doing 
some account maintenance of your own and clearing out some unnecessary 
files that may be taking up space, or getting in contact with your Web host to 
upgrade your account.
Choosing the size of your bandwidth pipe
Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that is carried from point A to point 
B within a specific period (usually, only a second or two). I live out in the 
country — pretty much the middle of nowhere. The water that comes to my 
house is provided by a private well that lies buried in the backyard some-
where. Between my house and the well are pipes that bring the water to my 
house. The pipes provide a free flow of water to our home so that everyone 
can enjoy their long hot showers while I labor over dishes and laundry, all at 
the same time. Lucky me!
The very same concept applies to the bandwidth available with your host-
ing account. Every Web hosting provider offers a variety of bandwidth limits 
on the accounts it offers. When I want to view your Web site in my browser 
window, the bandwidth is essentially the pipe that lets your data flow from 
your “well” to my computer and monitor. Similar to the pipe connected to my 
well — it can hold only a certain amount of water before it reaches maximum 
capacity — your bandwidth limit is determined by how much bandwidth 
your Web host allows for your account — the larger the number, the bigger 
the pipe. A 50MB (megabyte) bandwidth limit makes for a smaller pipe than 
does a 100MB limit.

31
 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
 
Web hosts are pretty generous with the amount of bandwidth they provide in 
their packages. Like disk space, bandwidth is measured in gigabytes (GB). 
Think about what you’re planning to do with your Web site. Running a social 
community with BuddyPress can require a lot more bandwidth and disk space 
than just running a blog without a social community because you now have 
members who are trafficking your site, connecting with friends, and sharing 
information. I recommend a hosting service that provides you, initially, with 
50 to 100GB of bandwidth per month with disk space allowances of up to 
500MB of space. Those recommendations are for starters; most Web hosting 
providers give you the opportunity to upgrade your bandwidth and disk 
space, as needed.
 
Web sites that run large files — such as video, audio, or photo files — generally 
benefit from higher disk space compared with sites that don’t involve large 
files. Additionally, Web sites running WordPress MU and BuddyPress, by 
nature, will use more bandwidth than a regular (single user) WordPress Web 
site because of the amount of traffic your community members create on 
your site. Keep this point in mind when you sign up for your hosting account. 
Planning now for sufficient hard disk space and bandwidth transfer allow-
ances will save you a few headaches down the road.
Transferring Files from Point A to Point B
This section introduces you to the basic elements of FTP. The ability to use 
FTP with your hosting account is a given for almost every Web host on the 
market today. FTP is the method you use to move files from one place to 
another — for example, from your computer to your Web hosting account. 
This method is referred to as uploading.
Using FTP to transfer files requires an FTP client. Many FTP clients are avail-
able for download. Following are some good (and free) ones:
 
✓ WS_FTP: www.ipswitch.com/_download/wsftphome.asp
 
✓ SmartFTP: www.smartftp.com/download
 
✓ FileZilla: http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla
 
✓ FTP Explorer: www.ftpx.com
Earlier in this chapter, in the section “Finding a Home for Your Blog,” you find 
out how to obtain a Web hosting account. Your Web host gives you a user-
name and password for your account, including an FTP IP address. (Usually, 
the FTP address is the same as your domain name, but check with your Web 
host, as addresses may vary.) You insert this information — the username, 
password, and FTP IP address — into the FTP program to connect it to your 
hosting account.

on the right shows the listing of files on my hosting account.
 
Figure 2-1: 
FileZilla is a

FTP clients such as FileZilla make it easy to transfer files from your computer 
to your hosting account by using a drag-and-drop method. You simply click 
the file on your computer that you want to transfer, drag it to the side that lists 
the directory on your hosting account, and then drop it. Depending on the FTP 
client you’ve chosen to work with, you can refer to its user manuals or support 
documentation for detailed information on how to use the program.
Working with WordPress
By the time you’re finally ready to install WordPress, you should have done 
the following things:
 
✓ Purchased the domain name registration for your account
 
✓ Obtained a hosting service on a Web server for your blog

33
 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
 
✓ Established your hosting account username, password, and FTP address
 
✓ Acquired an FTP client for transferring files to your hosting account
If you’ve missed any of the items listed, you can go back to the beginning of 
this chapter to reread the portions you need.
Without further ado, go get the WordPress MU software at http://
mu.wordpress.org/download.
 
WordPress gives you two compression formats for the software: Zip and Tar.
gz. I recommend getting the Zip file because it’s the most common format for 
compressed files, and you can use a program like WinZip (http://winzip.
com) to decompress the files on a PC. Macs will automatically decompress a 
Zip file when you open it.
The first step in the WordPress installation process is to download the 
WordPress software to your computer and decompress (or unpack, or unzip) 
it to a folder on your computer’s hard drive. Having the WordPress soft-
ware on your own computer isn’t enough, however; you also need to upload 
(transfer) it to your Web server account (the one you obtain in the section, 
“Finding a Home for Your Blog,” earlier in this chapter). Before installing 
WordPress on your Web server, you need to make sure that you have a 
MySQL database set up and ready to accept the WordPress installation. The 
next section tells you what you need to know about MySQL.
Setting up the WordPress 
MySQL database
The WordPress software is a personal publishing system that uses a PHP-
and-MySQL platform, which provides everything you need to create your own 
blog and publish your own content dynamically without having to know how 
to program those pages yourself. In short, all your content (options, posts, 
comments, and other pertinent data) is stored in a MySQL database in your 
hosting account.
Every time visitors go to your blog to read your content, they make a request 
that’s sent to your server. The PHP programming language receives that 
request, obtains the requested information from the MySQL database, and 
then presents the requested information to your visitors through their Web 
browsers.
Every Web host is different in how it gives you access to set up and manage your 
MySQL database(s) for your account. A popular account administration interface 
is cPanel (shown in Figure 2-2), which I use in the example in this section. If your 
host provides a different interface, the same basic steps apply, but the setup in 
the interface that your Web host provides might be different.

34
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
 
Figure 2-2: 
cPanel is a 
Web

manager

by several 
Web hosting 
companies.
 
To set up the MySQL database for your WordPress blog with cPanel, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Log in to the administration interface with the username and pass-
word assigned to you by your Web host.
 
 I’m using the cPanel administration interface, but your host might pro-
vide NetAdmin or Plesk, for example.
 
2. Locate the MySQL Database Administration section.
 
 In cPanel, click the MySQL Databases icon.
 
3. Choose a name for your database and enter it in the Name text box.
 
 Be sure to make note of the database name because you’ll need it during 
the installation of WordPress later.
 
 For security reasons, make sure that your password isn’t something that 
sneaky hackers can easily guess. Usually, I give my database a name that 
I will easily recognize later. This practice is especially helpful if you’re 
running more than one MySQL database in your account. If I name this 
database something like WordPress or wpblog, I can be reasonably 
certain — a year from now, when I want to access my database to make 
some configuration changes — that I know exactly which one I need to 
deal with.

35
 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
 
4. Click the Create Database button.
 
 You get a message confirming that the database has been created.
 
5. Click the Go Back link or the Back button on your browser toolbar.
 
6. Choose a username and password for your database, enter them in 
the Add New User text boxes, and then click the Create User button. 
 
 You get a confirmation message that the username was created with the 
password you specified.
 
 Make sure that you note the database name, username, and password 
that you set up during this process. You will need them in the next sec-
tion before officially installing WordPress on your Web server. Jot them 
down on a piece of paper, or copy and paste them into a text-editor 
window; either way, just make sure that you have them immediately 
handy.
 
7. Click the Go Back link or the Back button on your browser toolbar.
 
8. In the Add Users to Database section, choose the user you just set up 
from the User drop-down menu; then choose the new database from 
the Database drop-down menu.
 
 The MySQL Account Maintenance, Manage User Privileges page appears 
in cPanel.
 
9. Assign user privileges by selecting the All Privileges check box.
 
 Because you’re the administrator (owner) of this database, you need to 
make sure that you assign all privileges to the new user you just created.
 
10. Click the Make Changes button.
 
 A page opens with a confirmation message that you added your selected 
user to the selected database.
 
11. Click the Go Back link.
 
 You go back to the MySQL Databases page.
Uploading the WordPress files
To upload the WordPress files to your host, return to the folder on your 
computer where you unpacked the WordPress software that you downloaded 
earlier. You’ll find all the files you need (shown on the left side in Figure 2-1) 
in a folder called /wordpress-mu.
Using your FTP client, connect to your Web server, and upload all these files 
into the root directory of your hosting account.

36
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
 
If you don’t know what your root directory is, contact your hosting provider 
and ask, “What is my root directory for my account?” Every hosting provider’s 
setup is different. On my Web server, my root directory is the public_html 
folder; some of my clients have a root directory in a folder called httpdocs. 
The answer really depends on what type of setup your hosting provider has. 
When in doubt, ask!
Here are a few things to keep in mind when you upload your files:
 
✓ Upload the contents of the /wordpress-mu folder to your Web 
server — not the folder itself. Most FTP client software lets you 
select all the files and drag and drop them to your Web server. Other 
programs have you highlight the files and click a Transfer button.
 
✓ Choose the correct transfer mode. File transfers via FTP have two 
forms: ASCII and binary. Most FTP clients are configured to autodetect 
the transfer mode. Understanding the difference as it pertains to the 
WordPress installation is important, so that you can troubleshoot any 
problems you have later:
 
• Binary transfer mode is how images (such as .jpg, .gif, .bmp, 
and .png files) are transferred via FTP.
 
• ASCII transfer mode is for everything else (text files, PHP files, 
JavaScript, and so on).
 
 For the most part, it’s a safe bet to make sure that the transfer mode of 
your FTP client is set to autodetect. But if you experience issues with 
how those files load on your site, retransfer the files using the appropri-
ate transfer mode.
 
✓ You can choose a different folder from the root. You aren’t required 
to transfer the files to the root directory of your Web server. You can 
make the choice to run WordPress on a subdomain or in a different 
folder on your account. For example, if you want your blog address to 
be http://yourdomain.com/blog, you would transfer the WordPress 
files into a folder named /blog.
 
✓ Choose the right file permissions. You need to pay attention to file per-
missions when you’re transferring files to your Web server. File permis-
sions tell the Web server how these files can be handled on your server; 
that is, whether they’re files that can be written to. Generally, PHP files 
need to have permission (chmod) of 666, whereas file folders need a 
permission of 755. Almost all FTP clients let you check and change the 
permissions on the files if you need to. Typically, you can find where to 
change file permissions within the menu options of your FTP client.
 
 Some hosting providers run their PHP software in a more secure format 
called safe mode. If this is the case with your host, you need to set the 
PHP files to 644. If you’re unsure, ask your hosting provider what per-
missions you need to set for PHP files.

37
 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
Web server configurations 
for WordPress MU
This section gives you important information about the configurations of 
your Web server. These configurations need to be in place to run WordPress 
MU successfully. If you can perform the configurations in this section your-
self (and if you have access to the Apache configuration files), this section is 
for you. If you don’t know how, are uncomfortable with adjusting these set-
tings, or do not have access to change the configurations in your Web server 
software, you’ll need to ask your hosting provider or hire a consultant to per-
form the configurations for you.
 
These configurations are essential, so make sure they’re in place before you 
try to run WordPress MU.
Apache
Apache (http://httpd.apache.org) is Web server software that’s loaded 
and running on your Web server. Not everyone has access to Apache configu-
ration files, however. Usually, the only person who has access to those files is 
the Web server administrator (this is usually your Web host). Depending on 
your own Web server account and configuration, you may or may not have 
access to the Apache software files.
mod re_write
The Apache module that’s necessary for WordPress MU to create nice per-
malink URLs is mod_rewrite. This module must be configured so that it is 
installed and activated on your server.
You or your Web host can make sure that mod_rewrite is activated on 
your server; open the httpd.conf file and verify that the following line is 
included within:
LoadModule rewrite_module /libexec/mod_rewrite.so
If it isn’t, type that line on its own line and save the file. You will probably 
need to restart Apache before the change takes effect.
Virtual Host (or vhost)
In the same httpd.conf file that I discuss in the previous section, you need 
to adjust the <VirtualHost> section. Follow these steps:
 
1. Find the <VirtualHost> section in the httpd.conf file.
 
 This line of the httpd.conf file provides directives, or configurations, 
that apply to your Web site.

38
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
 
2. Find the line in the <VirtualHost> section of the httpd.conf file 
that looks like AllowOverride None.
 
3. Replace that line with AllowOverride FileInfo Options.
 
4. On a new line, type ServerAlias *.yourdomain.com.
 
 Replace yourdomain.com with whatever your domain is. This line defines 
the host name for your WordPress MU site and is essential for the vir-
tual host to work correctly.
DNS (domain name server)
WordPress MU gives you two ways to run a network of blogs on your domain. 
You can use the subdomain option or the subdirectory option. The most pop-
ular option (and recommended structure) sets up subdomains for the blogs 
created by your WordPress MU community. With this subdomain option, 
the URL of each blog looks cleaner, and the username of the blog appears 
first. Also, if you intend to take advantage of plugins that are available for 
WordPress MU, you’ll find that most of the plugin structures are written with 
a subdomain set up in mind.
You can see the differences in the URLs of these two options by comparing 
the following examples:
 
✓ A subdomain looks like this: http://username.yourdomain.com
 
✓ A subdirectory looks like this: http://yourdomain.com/username
In the subdomain example, see how the username appears first? That’s the 
most desired method of setting up a WordPress MU network of community 
blogs.
If you want to use a subdomain for each blog in your WordPress MU com-
munity, you must add a wildcard record to your DNS records on your Web 
server. If you are unsure of what a wildcard record is, or how to set one up 
for your domain — just ask your Web hosting provider. You also need to add 
a hostname record pointing at your Web server in the DNS configuration tool 
available in your Web server administration software (like WebHost Manager, 
a popular Web host administration tool). The hostname record looks like 
this: *.yourdomain.com (where yourdomain.com is replaced with your 
actual domain name).
PHP (PHP Hypertext Processor)
In this section, you edit the PHP configuration on your Web server. To run 
WordPress MU, PHP needs to have the following configurations in place in 
the php.ini file on your Web server:
 
✓ Set your PHP so that it doesn’t display error messages in the visitor’s 
browser window. (This is usually turned off by default; just double-
check to be sure.)

39
 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
 
✓ Find out whether your PHP is compiled with memory limit checks. 
You can find this out by looking for memory_limit in the php.ini 
file. Usually, the default limit is 8MB. Increase the memory limit to at 
least 32MB, or even 64MB, to avoid PHP memory errors when running 
WordPress MU.
 
✓ Global variables should be set to Off. Usually, the default setting does 
have global variables turned off, but double-check to be sure. An easy 
way to configure this is to open the .htaccess file (found on your Web 
server in the same directory you install the WordPress MU files) and 
add the following lines to the very top:
 
 php_flag register_globals 0
 
 php_flag display_errors 0
Running the WordPress install script
The final step in the installation procedure for WordPress is connecting the 
WordPress software you uploaded to the MySQL database. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Type this URL in the address window of your browser, replacing your
domain.com with your own domain name:
 
 http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/install.php
 
 If you chose to install WordPress in a different folder from the root 
directory of your account, make sure you indicate this fact in the URL 
for the install script. If you transferred the WordPress software files to a 
/blog folder, for example, you would point your browser to the follow-
ing URL to run the installation: http://yourdomain.com/blog/wp-
admin/install.php.
 
 Assuming that you did everything correctly (see Table 2-1 for help with 
common installation problems), you see the message shown in Figure 2-3.
 
2. Click the Create a Configuration File button.
 
 The next page that opens displays a Welcome to WordPress MU mes-
sage and gives you the information you need to proceed with the instal-
lation, including the initial settings and database configurations that you 
need to fill in. Read through the What Do I Need? section on this page 
and confirm that you have the necessary items:
 
• Access to your Web server via FTP 
 
• A valid e-mail address
 
• An empty MySQL database

Figure 2-3: 
The first 
time you 
run the

script for 
WordPress, 
you see this 
message.
 
 
3. In the Blog Addresses section, select either the Sub-domains or the 
Sub-directories radio button.
 
 You need to choose how you would like to set up your network of com-
munity blogs. If you aren’t sure which option to choose, review the ear-
lier “DNS (domain name server)” section.
 
You can’t go back and change the options from Step 3 later — so be sure you 
check the right option for your setup in this step.
 
4. Type the name of your database, the database username, the pass-
word, and the database host in their respective text boxes, as shown 
in Figure 2-4.
 
• Database Name: Type the database name you used when you cre-
ated the MySQL database before this installation. Because hosts 
differ in configurations, you need to enter either the database 
name or the database name with your hosting account username 
appended.

41
 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
 
 If you named your database wordpress, for example, you would 
enter that in this text box. Or if your host requires you to append 
the database name with your hosting account username, you 
would enter username_wordpress, substituting your hosting user-
name for username. If my username were lisasabin, I would enter 
lisasabin_wordpress.
 
• User Name: Type the username you used when you created the 
MySQL database before this installation. Depending on what your 
host requires, you might need to append this username to your 
hosting account username.
 
• Password: Type the password you used when you set up the 
MySQL database. You don’t need to append the password to your 
hosting account username here.
 
• Database Host: Ninety-nine percent of the time, you’ll leave this 
field set to localhost. Some hosts, depending on their configura-
tions, have different hosts set for the MySQL database server. If 
localhost doesn’t work, you need to contact your hosting provider 
to find out the MySQL database host.
 
Figure 2-4: 
At this 
step of the 
WordPress 
installation 
phase, you 
need to 
enter the 
database 
name, user-
name, and 
password. 
 
5. Type your domain name in the Server Address text box.
 
 This should be the shortest version of your domain name. For example, 
type yourdomain.com, not www.yourdomain.com (where your
domain.com is your actual domain name). Don’t include the http:// 
portion of the domain name here either.

42
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
 
6. Type the title of your Web site in the Site Title text box.
 
 The title is what you would like to call your WordPress-powered commu-
nity site. You can edit this later if you change your mind.
 
7. Type your e-mail address in the Email text box.
 
 This is the e-mail address where you want to receive all site-related 
information (such as contact information, notifications, and so on). 
Consider it the site administrator’s contact e-mail address.
 
8. Click the Submit button.
 
 This puts the WordPress MU installation script to work, and you see a 
page with the message, “Installation Finished!” This page also has the 
login information you need (username and password) to log in to the 
WordPress administration panel, where you will administer, manage, 
and maintain your Web site (see Figure 2-5). Make note of this login 
information and store it in a safe place.
 
 After you click the Install WordPress button, you receive an e-mail with 
the login information and login URL. This information is handy if you’re 
called away during this part of the installation process. So go ahead 
and let the dog out, answer the phone, brew a cup of coffee, or take a 
15-minute power nap. If you’re somehow distracted away from this page, 
the e-mail sent to you contains the information you need to log in to 
your WordPress blog successfully.

 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
 
 If you happen to lose this page before proceeding to the next step, you 
can always find your way to the login page by entering your domain fol-
lowed by the call to the login file (for example, http://yourdomain.
com/wp-login.php).
 
9. Click the Log In button to log in to WordPress.
 
 You know that you’re finished with the installation process when you 
see the login page, as shown in Figure 2-6. Check out Table 2-1 if you 
experience any problems during this installation process; it covers some 
of the common problems users run into.

to get WordPress running on your Web site. And let me be the first to con-
gratulate you on your newly installed WordPress blog. Were you expecting a 
marching band? WordPress isn’t that fancy . . . yet. Give them time, though. If 
anyone can produce it, the folks at WordPress can.

Touring the WordPress Dashboard
In This Chapter
▶ Logging into WordPress MU
▶ Exploring the WordPress dashboard
▶ Discovering the Site Admin options
▶ Performing general site management duties
W
ith the WordPress software successfully installed, you can begin to 
explore the software. In this chapter, you discover the WordPress 
MU dashboard, how to set administration configurations, and how to manage 
your network of users.
Some of you might be intimately familiar with how to use the WordPress 
dashboard to administer your Web site. If so, you can breeze through this 
chapter or skip it entirely. This chapter is geared toward the reader who’s 
unfamiliar with the back-end of WordPress, its vital settings, and the tools 
you need to manage and maintain your site and community.
Feeling comfortable with the dashboard sets you up for successful entrance 
into the world of WordPress. For a great depth of information on WordPress, 
try my other book, WordPress For Dummies.
Logging into WordPress
When you log in to WordPress, you see the dashboard first. Follow these 
steps to log in to WordPress and view the dashboard:
 
1. Open your Web browser and type the WordPress login page URL 
(Web address) into the address box.
 
 The login page address looks like http://yourdomain.com/
wp-login.php.

46
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
 
 If you installed WordPress into its own folder, be sure to include that 
folder in the address you type when you log in. For example, if you 
installed WordPress into a wordpress folder, the login URL would look 
like http://yourdomain.com/wordpress/wp-login.php.
 
2. Type your username into the Username text box and your password 
into the Password text box.
 
 I hope you kept your username and password in a safe place. Enter that 
information in the text boxes provided on the login page, as shown in 
Figure 3-1.
 
Figure 3-1: 
The 
WordPress 
login page.
 
 
3. Select the Remember Me check box if you want WordPress to place a 
cookie in your browser.
 
 The cookie tells WordPress to remember your login credentials the 
next time you load the login page in your browser window. The cookie 
set by WordPress is harmless and stores your WordPress login on your 
computer. Because of the cookie, your username and password will be 
remembered the next time you visit.
 
4. Click the Log In button.
 
 This loads the WordPress dashboard, which I cover in the next section.

 Chapter 3: Touring the WordPress Dashboard
Getting Familiar with WordPress
You need to be familiar with the WordPress interface because that’s 
where you find all the BuddyPress goodies after you install BuddyPress. 
Additionally, you will tweak your settings several times throughout the life of 
your Web site. In this section, I give you a very basic idea of what the dash-
board looks like and how you navigate the menus to find the settings and 
options that you need.
Navigating the WordPress dashboard
Following a successful WordPress install and login, the WordPress dash-
board appears, as shown in Figure 3-2.
 
Figure 3-2: 
The 
WordPress 
dashboard.
 
The dashboard is where you find and configure all the settings and options 
for running a WordPress-powered Web site. In Chapter 5, I show you where 
you can find all the BuddyPress configurations. (For information on installing 
BuddyPress, see Chapter 4.)

48
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
The WordPress dashboard gives you some quick, at-a-glance information 
about your WordPress installation. Here you find statistics about your 
WordPress site, such as
 
✓ How many posts, pages, and comments you have.
 
✓ The number of categories and tags you’ve created.
 
✓ The name of the theme and number of WordPress widgets you are using.
 
✓ The five most recent comments visitors have left on your blog.
 
✓ The five most recent drafts you’ve saved to publish later.
 
✓ Information and links to recent WordPress news and plugins.
The dashboard is a portal to the other sections of your WordPress interface. 
In the navigation menu on the left side of the page, you can configure and 
manage your WordPress blog or Web site. With a WordPress MU Web site, 
you can manage your Web site two ways:
 
✓ As site administrator: This role manages the overall settings and com-
munity aspects of your site. Within this role, you manage your user 
base, community blogs (if you have them set up), available themes, 
member registration options, and overall site-wide community settings.
 
✓ As site publisher: This role publishes content to your site, whether it’s 
posts to a blog; static pages for your site; or categories, link lists, and 
media files you create and maintain.
How you use the WordPress dashboard completely depends on which role 
you’re fulfilling at that moment.
Configuring the Site Admin options
The Site Admin menu is directly beneath the dashboard menu in the navigation 
on the left side of the page. When you hover your cursor on Site Admin, a drop-
down arrow appears to the right. (Each menu in this area has a drop-down 
arrow that functions in this manner.) If you click the drop-down arrow, the Site 
Admin options appear. This section covers all six options shown in Figure 3-3.
Admin
The first item on the Site Admin menu is Admin. Click Admin and the 
WordPress MU Admin page appears where you can search for users and 
blogs within your community. Obviously, you won’t perform this search if 
you don’t have any users or blogs yet. However, this function is extremely 
useful when you have a community of users and blogs within your network.

49
 Chapter 3: Touring the WordPress Dashboard
 
Figure 3-3: 
The 
WordPress 
dashboard 
menus 
expand to 
reveal menu 
items.
 
The Search Users feature allows you to search usernames and user e-mail 
addresses. If you search for the user Lisa, for instance, your results will 
include any user whose username or e-mail address contains Lisa — so you 
can receive multiple returns when using just one search word or phrase. The 
Search Blogs feature returns any blog content within your community that 
contains your search term, too.
The WordPress MU Admin page has two links near the top of the page that 
are very useful:
 
✓ Create a New Blog: Click this link to create a new blog within your com-
munity. Once clicked, the Blogs page appears where you can add a new 
blog. I cover how to do this in the upcoming “Blogs” section.
 
✓ Create a New User: Click this link to create a new user account within 
your community. Once clicked, the Users page appears where you can 
add a new user to your community. I cover how to do this in the upcom-
ing “Users” section.
Additionally, the WordPress MU Admin page gives you a real time count of 
how many blogs and users you have in your community, which is nice-to-
know information for any community site owner.
Blogs
The second item on the Site Admin menu is Blogs. The Blogs page is where 
you find several options for managing your community blogs.
At the top of the Blogs page is a search box that allows you to search through 
your community’s blogs by name, ID, or IP address. This is especially helpful 
if you have a large community and a user contacts you with a question about 
his blog. You can visit the Blogs page and pull up that particular blog pretty 
quickly with the search feature.

50
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
The Blogs page also lists all the blogs within your community. The listing 
shows the following statistics about each community blog:
 
✓ ID: The blog’s ID number assigned when it was created
 
✓ Blog Domain: The domain URL (Web address) of the blog
 
✓ Last Updated: The date the blog was last updated (or published to)
 
✓ Registered: The date the blog was registered in your community
 
✓ Users: The username and e-mail address associated with the user(s) of 
that blog
Underneath the listing of existing blogs in your community is the handy “Add 
a Blog” area, in which you can add a new blog easily by following these few 
steps:
 
1. Type the address in the Blog Address text box.
 
 The Blog Address is also the URL (Web address) of the blog you are cre-
ating. For example, if you typed in the word newblog, then the resulting 
URL of the blog will be http://newblog.yourdomain.com (if you 
are using subdomains) or http://yourdomain.com/newblog (if you 
are using subdirectories in your community), where yourdomain.com 
is the domain name of your community).
 
2. Type the title in the Blog Title text box.
 
 This is the title of the new blog you are creating. An example of a title: My 
New Blog — unlike the Blog Address, which cannot be changed, this title 
can be changed at any time within the WordPress dashboard settings.
 
3. Type the e-mail address of the blog owner in the Admin Email text box.
 
 This is the e-mail address of the person who is the owner of this blog. 
If the user is not already a member of your community, WordPress will 
create a new user and send that user an e-mail with his username and 
password for his new blog.
 
4. Click the Add Blog button.
 
 This action creates the blog in your network, and the Blogs page 
refreshes; you now see the newly created blog in the listing of blogs 
within your community.
For detailed information about using and managing community blogs, see 
Chapter 7.
Users
The third item on the Site Admin menu is Users. The Users page lists all your 
users and provides the following information about each one:

51
 Chapter 3: Touring the WordPress Dashboard
 
✓ Username: This is the login name the member uses when she logs in to 
her account in your community.
 
✓ Name: This is the user’s real name, taken from her profile. If the user has 
not provided her name in her profile, this column will be blank.
 
✓ E-mail: This is the e-mail address the user entered when she registered 
on your site.
 
✓ Registered: This is the date when the user registered.
 
✓ Blogs: If you enable blogs within your WordPress community, this lists 
any blogs the user is a member of.
When you hover on a username with your mouse, an Edit link appears that 
you can click to edit that user’s profile if you need to.
Also on the Users page, you can add new users with the interface near the 
bottom of the page, as shown in Figure 3-4.
 
Figure 3-4: 
Add a new 
user on the 
Users page.
 
Maybe you have a reluctant friend who’s been dragging her feet about joining 
your community. You’ve been begging and pleading with her to join, and she 
keeps promising she will, yet days go by, and her user registration doesn’t 
come through your e-mail. (Mom, are you paying attention?) Well, fix her up 
with an account on your site right this very minute! Here’s how to add a new 
user to your community:
 
1. Type the desired username in the Username text box.
 
2. Type the user’s e-mail address in the Email text box.
 
3. Click the Add User button.
 
 The page reloads with an Options Saved message at the top. You now 
see the new user in the list of users on the Users page.
The new user you created receives a confirmation e-mail. You’ve graciously 
helped your friend along, but she still has to confirm the registration. 
Nevertheless, you’re one step closer to having your friend on board in your 
community!

52
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
Themes
The fourth item on the Site Admin menu is Themes. The Site Themes page 
lists available themes that you can use within your community, and is where 
you enable or disable installed themes for use on your site. Additionally, if 
you integrate community member blogs within your WordPress/BuddyPress 
web site (see Chapter 7), you can enable several themes for the bloggers to 
choose from.
You enable the BuddyPress theme that you want to use on your own main 
site on the Site Themes page. For more information about enabling and using 
the default BuddyPress themes, see Chapter 4.
Part IV of this book takes you through a myriad of information about using 
WordPress and BuddyPress themes within your community. If you have a 
burning desire to know more, hop over to that part of the book and read all 
about it.
Options
The fifth item on the Site Admin menu is Options. The Site Options page con-
tains the operational settings (such as the site name, administrator e-mail 
address, and the welcome text sent to new users) for your entire WordPress 
MU–powered community, as shown in Figure 3-5.
 
Figure 3-5: 
The Site 
Options 
page.
 

53
 Chapter 3: Touring the WordPress Dashboard
The following steps take you through each option:
 
1. Type the name of your site in the Site Name text box.
 
2. Type your e-mail address in the Site Admin Email text box.
 
 You use this e-mail address to send site registration notices, password 
reminders, and support e-mails to users within your community. Just a 
suggestion: Make the e-mail address an easy, generic address, such as 
support@yourdomain.com. Some users might e-mail you back at this 
address seeking support or assistance.
 
3. Select an Allow New Registrations option:
 
• Disabled: Disallows new user registration completely. When 
selected, this option prevents people who visit your site from reg-
istering for a user account.
 
• Enabled. Blogs and User Accounts Can Be Created: Gives users the 
ability to create a user account or a blog during the registration 
process.
 
• Only User Accounts Can Be Created: Gives people the ability to 
create only a user account; users will not be able to create a blog 
within your network.
 
• Only Logged In Users Can Create New Blogs: Allows only existing 
users — that is, those who are already logged in — to create a new 
blog within your network. This also disables new user registration 
completely. Select this option if you don’t want just anyone regis-
tering for an account. Instead you, as the site administrator, can 
add new users at your own discretion.
 
4. Select registration notification preferences.
 
 Choose Yes or No to whether you want to be notified via e-mail each 
time a new user registers in your community.
 
5. Select whether to allow blog administers to add new users to their 
blog(s).
 
 Choose Yes or No to whether you want to allow your community blog 
owners to add new users to their own community blog via the Users 
page within their individual dashboards.
 
6. Type the name or ID of the dashboard blog.
 
 The dashboard blog is the main blog for your Web site. If this field is 
left blank, the main blog for your site will default to your main domain 
(yourdomain.com) when people visit your site. New users are added as 
subscribers to the dashboard blog if they don’t have a blog within your 
community.

54
Part I: Introducing BuddyPress 
 
7. Set the default role for new users on the dashboard blog.
 
 Your drop-down menu choices are
 
• Subscriber: Users can access their profile only and cannot access 
any of the back-end features or settings of your main blog.
 
• Contributor: Users can upload files and write, edit, and manage 
posts on your main blog. However, when a contributor writes a 
post, the post is saved as a draft to await administrator approval. 
Contributors cannot post to the blog without approval, which is a 
nice way to moderate content written by new authors.
 
• Author: In addition to having the same access and permissions as 
a contributor, an author can publish posts without administrator 
approval. Authors can also edit and delete their own posts.
 
• Editor: In addition to having the same access and permissions as 
an author, an editor can moderate comments, manage categories, 
manage links, edit pages, and edit other author’s posts. Editors can 
also read and edit private posts.
 
• Administrator: This user has access to all menus and settings 
within the WordPress dashboard and has the authority to change 
any of those options and settings, as well. 
 
 I would highly recommend leaving the default role set to Subscriber 
because you don’t want community users to have access to any of the 
back-end settings and options for your main blog (unless that’s your 
intention, then by all means, change it!).
 
8. Type disallowed user names in the Banned Names text box.
 
 By default, WordPress MU bans several user names from being regis-
tered within your community, including www, web, root, admin, main, 
invite, administrator, members, register, activate, search, blog, activity, 
blogs, forums, and groups. For good reason, you don’t want a random 
user to register a username, such as admin, because you don’t want that 
person misrepresenting himself as an administrator on your site. You 
can enter an unlimited amount of usernames that you do not want to 
allow on your site in the Banned Names text box.
 
9. Limit registration to certain e-mail addresses.
 
 This option allows you to enter an unlimited amount of e-mail addresses 
to limit new user registration to only certain e-mail addresses. For exam-
ple, if I wanted to create a community of people from my publishing 
company, Wiley Publishing — I can put wiley.com in this field to restrict 
registration to only people with access to that e-mail domain. People 
who try to register with an e-mail that is not on the list cannot register. 

55
 Chapter 3: Touring the WordPress Dashboard
To keep registration open to everyone, regardless of their address, leave 
this field blank.
 
10. In the Welcome Email text box, type the text of the e-mail you want 
new users to receive when they register with your site.
 
 Alternatively, you can leave this area alone and use the default text pro-
vided for you by WordPress MU.
 
 A few variables you can use in this e-mail aren’t explained entirely on 
the Site Options page, including
 
• SITE_NAME: Inserts the name of your WordPress site.
 
• BLOG_URL: Inserts the URL of the new member’s blog.
 
• USERNAME: Inserts the new member’s username.
 
• PASSWORD: Inserts the new member’s password.
 
• BLOG_URLwp-login.php: Inserts the hyperlinked login URL for 
the new member’s blog.
 
• SITE_URL: Inserts the hyperlinked URL for your WordPress MU 
site.
 
11. In the First Post text box, type the text that you want to appear in the 
first post on every blog that’s created in your community.
 
 You can use this area to provide useful information about your site and 
services. This also serves as a nice guide for new users, as they can view 
that post in their dashboard, on the Edit Post page, and see how it was 
entered and formatted and use that as a guide for creating their own 
blog posts. You can also use the variables mentioned in Step 10 to have 
WordPress automatically add some information for you.
 
12. Select media upload buttons.
 
 The choices are Images, Videos, and Music. Select the media that you’ll 
allow community users to upload to their own blog (assuming you’re 
integrating community blogs on your site).
 
13. Type the number for the maximum storage space allowed for blog 
uploads.
 
 The amount is in megabytes (MB), and the default storage space is 
10MB. This amount of hard drive space is what you give users to store 
the files they upload to their blog.
 
14. Select upload file types.
 
 Users cannot upload any file types that do not appear in this text box. 
By default, WordPress includes the following file types: .jpg, .jpeg,

.png, .gif, .mp3, .mov, .avi, .wmv, .midi, .mid, and .pdf. You can 
remove any default file types, and add new ones.
 
15. Set the maximum uploaded file size.
 
 This amount is in kilobytes (K), and the default file size is 1500K. This 
means that a user cannot upload a file that is larger than 1500K. Adjust 
this number as you see fit.
 
16. Set the Admin Notice Feed.
 
 If you want to display the latest post from your main blog within the 
dashboard of each of your users, type the RSS feed of the blog into this 
text box. By default, the text box is blank.
 
17. Type the usernames that are allowed administrative access to your 
dashboard.
 
 The usernames in this text box are allowed to log in to the main blog 
dashboard and access the Site Admin menu.
 
18. In the Menus section, select the Plugins check box.
 
 The Plugins page will be visible to users on their own blog dashboard. 
If you leave this option deselected, users will not have access to the 
plugins list. For more information about using plugins with WordPress 
and BuddyPress, see Chapter 13.
 
19. Click the Update Options button.
 
 When you finish the Site Options settings, don’t forget to click the 
Update Options button to save your settings. This reloads the Site 
Options page with your saved settings.
Upgrade
The final item on the Site Admin menu is Upgrade. You use the Site Upgrade 
page to upgrade the WordPress MU software. When WordPress MU releases 
a new version of their software, a message is shown at the top of your 
WordPress dashboard alerting you that you need to upgrade. This easy 
process is described in the “Tools” section, later in this chapter. However, 
upgrading the main software isn’t enough; you have to make sure each blog 
within your community is upgraded also. To accomplish this upgrade, simply 
click the Upgrade Site button on the Upgrade Site page. After you do that, 
WordPress MU runs a script that upgrades each blog within your community, 
assuming that you’ve chosen to integrate community blogs.
Depending on the size of your community — particularly if there are several 
blogs — this could take a very long time.

Part II
Getting Up and 
Running with 
BuddyPress

In this part . . .
A
fter you lay the WordPress foundation, you’re 
ready to download, install, and configure the 
BuddyPress suite of plugins that enable you to design a 
social community on your Web site. In this part, you 
install the BuddyPress plugins and configure the initial 
settings and required options.

▶ Installing BuddyPress
▶ Automatic and manual installation methods
▶ Activating BuddyPress
▶ Using the default themes
▶ Discovering the BuddyPress menu
A
fter reading this chapter, you’ll find that installing BuddyPress on your 
WordPress MU–powered Web site is relatively easy to accomplish. In 
Chapter 2, I cover all the basic requirements that you need in order to run 
BuddyPress on your Web site. By this point in the book, you should have 
accomplished the following:
 
✓ Registered a domain name for your Web site
 
✓ Obtained a Web hosting provider to house your Web site data
 
✓ Uploaded the WordPress MU files to your Web hosting account
 
✓ Set up the WordPress MU MySQL database
 
✓ Installed the WordPress MU software on your Web site
 
✓ Configured the correct Apache/DNS settings on your Web server
 
✓ Have a very good idea of the navigation structure of the WordPress MU 
dashboard
If you haven’t completed one, or more, of these steps, revisit Chapter 2 to 
review the sections where I discuss these items in detail. If you’ve met these 
requirements, then you’re ready to set up your BuddyPress community. 
This chapter takes you through the installation and activation process for 
BuddyPress, and includes information on the two installation methods: 
automatic and manual. This chapter also introduces you to the default 
BuddyPress themes that ship with the BuddyPress suite of plugins. You also 
discover the basics of the BuddyPress menu to understand your WordPress 

66
Part II: Getting Up and Running with BuddyPress 
MU dashboard and the available BuddyPress components and settings. 
Additionally, at the end of this chapter, you find some online BuddyPress 
resources to help you along your way.
 
You must already have WordPress MU functioning on your Web site before 
you can install and use BuddyPress to build a social community on your Web 
site. (Chapter 2 covers the installation and setup of WordPress MU.)
 
In addition to the information provided in this chapter on installing BuddyPress 
on your Web site, you might also want to visit the official BuddyPress Codex to 
reference a nice checklist of installation steps: http://codex.buddypress.
org/getting-started/setting-up-a-new-installation.
Installing BuddyPress
You can use two methods to install BuddyPress on your WordPress MU–
powered site:
 
✓ Automatic installation, using the WordPress MU auto-installer
 
✓ Manual installation, using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to upload files to 
your Web server
Using either of these installation methods will get BuddyPress up and run-
ning on your Web site. The automatic installation is, by far, the easiest; how-
ever, the manual installation method is good to know in case the automatic 
installation method fails (machines are not infallible, you know).
Using the automatic installation method
The easiest method to install BuddyPress on your Web site is to use the 
automatic installer that’s built into the WordPress MU platform. This method 
takes the guesswork out of installing BuddyPress because the installer does 
all the heavy lifting for you, including the following:
 
✓ Downloads the latest version of BuddyPress to your Web server
 
✓ Places the BuddyPress files in the correct directory (or location) on 
your Web server
 
✓ Verifies that BuddyPress files are viable and in the right spot before you 
can use them

67
 Chapter 4: Setting Up Base Camp
 
If something bad happens during the automatic installation process, such as 
an interruption in Internet service, WordPress MU warns you that BuddyPress 
is not ready to be activated on your site. The automatic installer knows 
whether the pieces and parts of a plugin, like BuddyPress, are correctly in 
place. If they aren’t, the installer simply will not let you activate and use the 
plugin until it verifies that the installation went smoothly.
By using the automatic installer to install and activate BuddyPress, you save 
yourself valuable time that can be spent building your Web site content and 
community. If it sounds too good to be true (something so geeky can’t really 
be that easy, can it?), then give the automatic installer a shot and experience 
its goodness! The following steps take you through installing BuddyPress on 
your WordPress MU–powered site with the built-in automatic plugin installer:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress MU dashboard.
 
 Point your browser to http://yourdomain.com/wp-login.php, 
enter your WordPress username and password, and then click the Log In 
button.
 
2. Expand the Plugins menu.
 
 On the left side of your WordPress MU dashboard, click the drop-down 
arrow that appears on the Plugins menu. This expands the Plugins menu 
and shows several links beneath the menu title.
 
3. Click the Add New link.
 
 The Install Plugins page appears, as shown in Figure 4-1.
 
4. Search for the BuddyPress plugin.
 
 Make sure Term is selected in the drop-down menu and then type 
BuddyPress in the field to the right.
 
5. Click the Search Plugins button.
 
 This reloads the Install Plugins page with a listing of search results for 
the term BuddyPress. Figure 4-2 illustrates the plugin search results page.
 
6. Click the Install link for the BuddyPress plugin.
 
 A pop-up window appears with a description of the BuddyPress plugin. 
(In Figure 4-2, the BuddyPress plugin on the Install Plugins search 
results page is the fifth listing.)

7. Install BuddyPress.
 
 Click Install Now in the top-right corner of the BuddyPress pop-up 
window, as shown in Figure 4-3. This loads the Installing Plugin: 
BuddyPress page and displays each step of the successful plugin instal-
lation process:
 
• Downloading install package from http://wordpress.org/
extend/plugins/buddypress
 
• Unpacking the package
 
• Installing the plugin
 
• Successfully installed the plugin BuddyPress
 
8. Activate BuddyPress.
 
 Two links display after the plugin installation: Activate Plugin and 
Return to Plugin Installer. Click the Activate Plugin link to activate 
BuddyPress on your Web site. You return to the Manage Plugins page 
where you see a listing of plugins currently installed on your Web site; 
BuddyPress is now among the plugins listed.

Part II: Getting Up and Running with BuddyPress 
 
The WordPress MU automatic plugin installer comes in handy for any plugin 
you want to install and use on your Web site. However, the only plugins that 
are available through the plugin installer are listed in the official WordPress 
Plugin Directory located at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins.
 
After you install WordPress MU, the site admin (that’s you) needs to enable 
the display of the Plugins menu for users within your community if you want 
to allow your users to access the menu to choose which plugins they want to 
activate on their community blog. When you visit the Manage Plugins page 
to activate the BuddyPress plugins, a red status message tells you, the site 
admin, that the Plugins page is not visible to normal users and must be acti-
vated (see Figure 4-4). You do not need to activate the Plugins menu to acti-
vate BuddyPress. The only reason to do this is if you want your normal users 
(non-admin users) to see and use the Plugins page to manage plugins on their 
own community blog. For more about the use of plugins, see Chapter 13.
The next part of this chapter deals with the manual installation of the 
BuddyPress plugin files — you might want to stick around for these instruc-
tions because they are good to know in a pinch. Additionally, this information 
gives you a solid idea of where the BuddyPress plugin files live on your Web 
server, which comes in handy when you dig deeper into customizing your 
BuddyPress community by creating or tweaking theme designs (see Part IV).

Installing BuddyPress manually
The manual installation process of BuddyPress requires quite a few more 
steps than the automatic installation method I cover. However, this method 
gives you a good understanding of the directory structure of the BuddyPress 
files and the location of the files on your Web server, including the names of 
the folders and files that make up the suite of BuddyPress plugins.
 
Before you start, make sure you have an FTP program ready because you’ll 
need it to transfer the BuddyPress files from your computer to your Web 
server. Chapter 2 covers the information you need to use an FTP program if 
you want to make sure you have the information and tools necessary to per-
form the manual installation.
Downloading the BuddyPress files
To download the BuddyPress plugins from the official BuddyPress Web site:
 
1. Browse to the BuddyPress Web site at http://buddypress.org.
 
2. Choose Download on the top navigation menu on the BuddyPress 
Web site.
 
 The Download BuddyPress page (http://buddypress.org/download) 
appears where you download the latest release of BuddyPress.
 
3. Click the Download BuddyPress link.
 
 A dialog box appears where you choose a location on your computer to 
store the BuddyPress Zip file.
 
4. Decompress (or unzip) the BuddyPress plugin files.
 
 Use a program like WinZip for the PC, or the built-in tool for compressed 
files on a Mac.
Be sure to remember where you store the BuddyPress files on your computer 
because you need to know that for the next step in the manual installation 
procedure.
Uploading the BuddyPress files
To upload the BuddyPress files to your host, within your FTP program open the 
location on your computer where you unzipped the BuddyPress plugin files that 
you downloaded earlier. The left side of Figure 4-5 shows all the files in the 
\buddypress folder. I’m using an FTP program called Filezilla; the program you 
use might look different but will still list the same files and folders you see here.
Using your FTP client, connect to your Web server, and upload all the files 
to your hosting account’s root directory. Upload the entire \buddypress 
folder to your Web server into the /wp-content/plugins/ folder within 
your existing WordPress installation directory. The right side of Figure 4-5 
illustrates the correct location of the BuddyPress files on your Web server.

Part II: Getting Up and Running with BuddyPress 
 
Figure 4-5: 
The 
BuddyPress 
file structure

in the

program.
 
 
Most FTP client software allows you to select all the files and drag and drop 
them to your Web server. Other programs have you highlight the files and 
click a Transfer button.
In Chapter 2, I give you several tips and things to keep in mind when upload-
ing files to your Web server via FTP, including transfer mode and file permis-
sions. Review that section if you experience any problems during the manual 
installation process.
Activate BuddyPress after manual file installation
After you have the necessary BuddyPress files uploaded to your Web server, 
you can activate BuddyPress on your Web site. To activate BuddyPress, 
follow these few easy steps:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress MU dashboard.
 
 Point your browser to http://yourdomain.com/wp-login.php, enter 
your WordPress username and password, and then click the Log In button.

73
 Chapter 4: Setting Up Base Camp
 
2. Browse to the Manage Plugins page.
 
 Choose Installed on the Plugins menu on the left side of your WordPress 
MU dashboard. This loads the Manage Plugins page where you find a 
listing of all the installed plugins on your site.
 
3. Activate BuddyPress.
 
 Click the Activate link that displays beneath the BuddyPress plugin. The 
Manage Plugins page reloads, and BuddyPress appears at the top of the 
page under the Currently Active Site Wide Plugins heading, as shown in 
Figure 4-6.
BuddyPress admin bar
One thing you might immediately notice after successfully installing and activat-
ing BuddyPress is the admin bar at the top of your site, as shown in Figure 4-7.

Admin bar
The admin bar is a navigation menu that you and your community of users 
can use to navigate the different pages and features of your social community 
after logging in.
Using Default BuddyPress Themes
BuddyPress comes with default themes that you can use for the visual look of 
your social community’s Web site. One theme framework is the parent theme 
that all other (child) themes are built from. That might sound a little confus-
ing, but in Part IV of this book, I unravel the mysteries surrounding parent 
and child themes, frameworks, and using them to create your BuddyPress 
social community Web site’s custom design. For right now, however, getting 
the default themes installed and running on your site is the important issue.
Moving theme folders
After you install and activate BuddyPress on your site, the theme files are in 
the /wp-content/plugins/buddypress/bp-themes folder on your Web 
server.

75
 Chapter 4: Setting Up Base Camp
Whether you chose the automatic or manual method of installing BuddyPress, 
the theme files need to be moved before you can use the themes on your Web 
site. You use your FTP program to move the theme folders to the correct loca-
tion on your Web server. The three theme folders to move are
 
✓ Move /wp-content/plugins/buddypress/bp-themes/bp-sn-
parent to /wp-content/themes
 
✓ Move /wp-content/plugins/buddypress/bp-themes/bp-classic
to /wp-content/themes
 
✓ Move /wp-content/plugins/buddypress/bp-themes/bp-
default to /wp-content/themes
 
Keep an eye out for a new release of the WordPress MU software in the early 
months of 2010. The planned upgrade for WordPress MU will eliminate the 
need for you to move the BuddyPress theme files to the /wp-content/
themes/ folder; this action will be done for you when you install and activate 
the BuddyPress suite of plugins.
 
Every FTP program differs in the way it allows you to move files and folders 
from one directory to another. Some allow you to utilize the drag-and-drop 
method; others require that you right-click the file or folder with your mouse, 
select the Move option, and then type the directory that you want to move the 
files or folders to.
Activating themes
The final step in making sure that you can use the default BuddyPress themes 
on your Web site is to activate them within your WordPress MU dashboard. 
Two concepts are at work:
 
✓ Enabling themes on your WordPress MU dashboard
 
 The BuddyPress installation process places the BuddyPress themes 
where they need to be on your Web server; however, you still need 
to take the extra step of activating those themes for use on your 
WordPress MU site. Part IV of this book covers BuddyPress themes in 
depth; however, to use themes on your WordPress MU and BuddyPress 
site, the theme files need to exist in the /wp-content/themes folder in 
your WordPress MU installation directory on your Web server. Having 
the themes installed in that directory isn’t enough, however; you also 
need to enable the themes for use on your WordPress MU site.
 
✓ Activating a theme to display on your main site
 
 Once enabled, themes can be activated. You can have only one active 
theme on your Web site at a time. The active theme is what displays 
when you, and other people, view your Web site in a Web browser.

76
Part II: Getting Up and Running with BuddyPress 
The following steps enable the BuddyPress themes in WordPress MU and 
activate the BuddyPress Default theme on your Web site:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress MU dashboard.
 
 Point your browser to http://yourdomain.com/wp-login.php, 
enter your WordPress admin username and password, and then click 
the Log In button.
 
2. Browse to the Site Themes page.
 
 Choose Themes on the Site Admin menu on the left side of your 
WordPress MU dashboard. The Site Themes page appears, showing a list-
ing of available themes installed in your /wp-content/themes folder.
 
3. Enable the BuddyPress themes for use on your WordPress MU site.
 
 Select the Yes radio button to the left of either the BuddyPress Classic 
theme or the BuddyPress Default theme. The BuddyPress Social 
Network Parent theme does not get enabled, because it acts only as a 
framework for the other child themes.
 
4. Click the Update Themes button.
 
 The Site Themes page reloads and displays a message telling you that 
the Site Themes options are saved, as shown in Figure 4-8.

 Click the Activate link that appears beneath the BuddyPress Default 
or the BuddyPress Classic theme thumbnails — you can use either the 
Default or Classic theme, the choice is yours. I’ve chosen to activate the 
BuddyPress Default theme. When it’s activated, the BuddyPress Default 
theme (see Figure 4-9) displays when you visit your site.
 
You can preview how a theme will look on your site before activating it on the 
Manage Themes page. Click the Preview link beneath the theme image, and 
a pop-up window shows you how your site looks with that particular theme 
active. To activate the theme from the pop-up window, just click the Activate 
link that appears in the top-right corner of the window. To close the window 
without activating the theme, click the X that appears in the top-left corner of 
the pop-up window.

The BuddyPress themes use built-in WordPress and BuddyPress widgets 
to display content on your Web site. I don’t cover widgets in this chapter; 
however, Chapter 9 has a great deal of information on how to use widgets, 
including the built-in BuddyPress widgets that enable you to add dynamic 
and interactive features to your social community Web site.
Finding the BuddyPress Menu
In Chapter 2, I cover the basics of navigating through the WordPress MU 
dashboard. The left side of the dashboard is where you find all the menus of 
options and settings that you need to set up and configure your WordPress 
MU site. Once installed and activated, BuddyPress has its own menu in the 
WordPress MU dashboard directly beneath the Site Admin menu. Figure 4-10 
shows you exactly where the BuddyPress menu is found.
The next chapter in this book, Chapter 5, goes through the options and configu-
rations in detail; however, to give you a very basic idea of the navigation options 
and configuration settings in the BuddyPress menu, here’s a brief rundown:

✓ General Settings: Click this link to load the BuddyPress Settings page 
where you define basic settings of your BuddyPress social community, 
such as its wire, admin bar, and avatar handling.
 
✓ Component Setup: Click this link to load the BuddyPress Component 
Setup page. Components are the modules that you can use to enable the 
following features within your community:
 
• Activity Streams
 
• Blog Tracking
 
• bbPress Forums
 
• Friends
 
• Groups
 
• Private Messaging
 
• Extended Profiles
 
 You can enable all the components or just the ones you want to use; 
you do not need to enable all the components for BuddyPress to work 
on your site. Enable the components that you might want to use; the 
disabled ones will not be accessible to users on your site. You can, how-
ever, come back later and enable the components if you choose.
 
✓ Forums Setup: Click this link to load the Forums Setup page where you 
can set up a new bbPress installation or use an existing one to integrate 
discussion forums into your social community. bbPress is a discus-
sion forum software (created by the same folks behind WordPress 
and BuddyPress) that’s separate from WordPress MU or BuddyPress. 
However, bbPress integrates with both platforms. For more information 
about this option, see Chapter 7.
 
✓ Profile Field Setup: Click this link to load the Profile Field Setup page 
where you can create information fields that your community users 
fill out about themselves and display on their member profiles within 
your community pages. See Chapter 5 for in-depth information about 
extended user profiles.
Various sites on the Web offer additional information, resources, and assis-
tance to help you with all things related to BuddyPress and WordPress MU. 
Table 4-1 lists some of the more popular Web sites where WordPress and 
BuddyPress geeks hang out to talk, swap stories, and help one another.

Chapter 5
Configuring BuddyPress
In This Chapter
▶ Configuring the general settings
▶ Setting up BuddyPress components
▶ Installing and enabling group forums
▶ Encouraging user friendships
▶ Using private messaging
▶ Setting up extended profiles for users
T
he very foundation of a BuddyPress-powered social community is the 
BuddyPress suite of plugins. These components help create the “social” part 
of your network by allowing your community to participate in your Web site by 
building personal profiles, creating friendships with other users, and communi-
cating with other users via private messaging, forums, wires, and groups.
In this chapter, you configure the initial general settings of BuddyPress via the 
BuddyPress menu on your WordPress MU dashboard. Additionally, you step 
through the setup of each BuddyPress component, and gain insight about why 
you may or may not wish to use the component in your community.
 
You do not have to use all of the components that come with BuddyPress for it 
to work on your Web site. You can choose which components you want to use 
by enabling them on the BuddyPress menu and leaving the rest disabled. Just 
like the salad bar at your local eatery — take what you want and leave the rest!
Configuring the General Settings
First things first, you need to visit the BuddyPress Settings page to config-
ure the general settings of your BuddyPress community. BuddyPress comes 
packaged with several different components and features that you can enable 
within your community. (See Chapter 6 for information on BuddyPress 
components and what they do). You do not have to use all of the available 
components — as a site administrator, you have the option to use only what 

82
Part II: Getting Up and Running with BuddyPress 
you need and leave the rest. The following steps take you through the basic 
settings. Later in this chapter I show you the different components you can 
use in your BuddyPress community site.
 
1. Log in to your WordPress MU dashboard.
 
 Point your browser to http://yourdomain.com/wp-login.php, 
enter your WordPress admin username and password, and then click 
the Log In button.
 
2. Expand the BuddyPress menu.
 
 On the left side of your WordPress MU dashboard, click the drop-down 
arrow on the BuddyPress menu. This expands the BuddyPress menu 
and displays several links beneath the menu title.
 
3. Browse to the BuddyPress Settings page.
 
 Click the General Settings link on the BuddyPress menu. This loads the 
BuddyPress Settings page, as shown in Figure 5-1, where you set up the 
initial general settings for your community.
 
Figure 5-1:

83
 Chapter 5: Configuring BuddyPress
On the BuddyPress Settings page, you’re presented with seven settings. Each 
of these options already has a default setting, which you can leave or change 
according to your tastes:
 
✓ Base Profile Group Name: By default, the Base Profile Group Name 
value is Base, but you can change the value to anything you want by 
typing a new name in the text field. I cover profile groups in the later 
“Building Profile Groups and Fields” section; in short, however, the pro-
file group name is the title that displays on member profiles above the 
information they provide at signup.
 
 Figure 5-2 shows my member profile where I’ve changed the default 
profile group name to Information. (You can see that the title bar above 
the details in my profile now reads Information.) If I had left the default 
profile group name Base, the title on my profile would read Base instead.
 
✓ Full Name Field Name: Just like the default profile group name, the Full 
Name Field Name value displays on member profiles as the member 
name label. By default, the Full Name Field Name value is Name — but 
you can change the value by typing a new phrase in the text field. A 
couple of examples might be Handle or Nickname.
 
 In Figure 5-2, you see that the label to the left of my name reads People 
call me — so when visitors see my member profile, they read People 
call me: Lisa Sabin-Wilson. This is another small way to customize your 
BuddyPress social community.
 
✓ Disable BuddyPress to WordPress Profile Syncing?: Here you can 
choose to have BuddyPress synchronize users’ profiles with the profile 
data they filled out in their WordPress profiles.
 
✓ Hide Admin Bar for Logged Out Users?: Select Yes or No to hide the 
admin bar for logged out users. The admin bar is a navigation menu that 
appears at the top of a WordPress MU Web site that has an additional 
BuddyPress social community added to it. The admin bar allows users 
to navigate to different areas of the community, such as profiles, groups, 
forums, and blogs. If you want this admin bar visible to users of your 
community who aren’t logged in (or who aren’t members), select No. If 
you want to hide it from visitors who aren’t logged in, select Yes.
 
 For more information about the admin bar and using it for easy naviga-
tion throughout your Web site and community, see Chapter 6.
 
✓ Disable Avatar Uploads?: Here you can choose to disable users’ abil-
ity to upload their own avatar image. If you select Yes, users won’t be 
able to add their own photos or pictures to their member profiles. If you 
select No, users will be able to upload their own photos to display on 
their profiles.

✓ Disable User Account Deletion?: This allows you to select whether you 
will allow your users to delete their own accounts within your com-
munity. The selection is No by default, which allows users to delete 
their own accounts whenever they want to — this is the recommended 
setting if you want to give your users full control over their accounts in 
your community.
 
✓ Disable Global Forum Directory?: By default, the selection here is set to 
No, which means the Global Forums Directory will display on your site. 
(See Chapter 6 for full information about BuddyPress Directories). If you 
prefer to disable this, select Yes.
 
✓ Disable Activity Stream commenting on blog and forum posts?: Here 
you can control whether community members can leave comments 
within Activity Streams on blog posts and forum posts. By default, this 
option is set to No — select Yes if you want to disable this feature.
 
✓ Default User Avatar: User profiles that don’t have a custom avatar or 
photo uploaded display a default avatar. Your selection here determines 
the default avatar, and BuddyPress gives you four options to choose 
from, as shown in Figure 5-3.

When you complete selecting and setting the options on the BuddyPress 
Settings page, be sure to click the Save Settings button at the bottom of the 
page, otherwise your new settings will not be saved.
Discovering BuddyPress Components
The next step in configuring your new BuddyPress community is enabling the 
components that you want to use on your Web site. You can use all of them, 
or some of them, depending on your personal preference. This section gives 
you the details on each component to help you decide whether you’d like to 
use them to enhance your community. You can find further information on 
these components in Chapter 6, which takes you through how members of 
your community can use each feature.
To enable or disable components for your Web site, follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress MU dashboard.
 
 Point your browser to http://yourdomain.com/wp-login.php, 
enter your WordPress admin username and password, and then click 
the Log In button.
 
2. Expand the BuddyPress menu.
 
 On the left side of your WordPress MU dashboard, click the drop-down 
arrow on the BuddyPress menu. This expands the BuddyPress menu 
and displays several links beneath the menu title.
 
3. Browse to the BuddyPress Component Setup page.
 
 Click the Component Setup link on the BuddyPress menu. This loads the 
BuddyPress Component Setup page, as shown in Figure 5-4, where you 
set up the initial settings for your community.

Each component on the BuddyPress Component Setup page has two options 
that you can select: Enabled or Disabled. By default, each component is 
enabled — to change that for any of the components on this page, select the 
Disabled radio button and then click the Save Settings button on the bottom 
of the page to save your changes.
Activity Streams
You probably want to enable activity streams in your community because 
activity streams are the heart of almost every social community on the Web. 
Enabling activity streams in BuddyPress gives you the capability of publish-
ing a page on your Web site that displays all of your community members’ 
activities on your network. Every action is recorded on the activity stream, 
which gives your community members an easy way to discover what other 
members are doing and how they’re using your community features.
Figure 5-5 shows a WordPress MU-powered Web site at the official test site 
for BuddyPress at http://testbp.org. The front page of the Web site, 
which uses the BuddyPress Default theme, shows recent member activity 
within their entire community.

87
 Chapter 5: Configuring BuddyPress
 
Figure 5-5: 
Site wide

page of 
http://testbp.
org.
 
Additionally, activity streams collect individual activities on individual pro-
files so that members can see a running list of their own recent activities 
within your community, as well as a listing of their friends’ activities.
What types of activities are recorded within the activity streams? Don’t 
worry — the recorded activity is restricted to community activities only, so 
no one will know if you’re picking your nose while browsing the Web. The fol-
lowing activities are some examples of what’s recorded in activity streams:
 
✓ Wire posts
 
✓ Blog posts and comments
 
✓ New friendships
 
✓ Profile updates, including updates to a member’s profile photo
Blog Tracking
One feature of a WordPress MU–powered blog that sets it apart from a 
Web site powered by the (single user) WordPress.org software is that the 
MU-powered blog allows users to create multiple blogs within the network. 
Adding BuddyPress to the mix doesn’t remove this feature at all; it enhances 
and encourages the activity by providing the Blog Tracking component.

88
Part II: Getting Up and Running with BuddyPress 
With the Blog Tracking component enabled, members’ blogs, blog posts, and 
blog comments display in one spot on their member profile. This enables 
other members to easily find all the blogs that member belongs to, or owns, 
as well as all of their blog posts and comments. This handy feature encour-
ages deeper navigation and conversation through member participation 
within your network on various member blogs. Figure 5-6 illustrates the Blog 
Tracking feature on the BuddyPress demo Web site (http://testbp.org). 
For additional information about integrating member blogs, see Chapter 7.
bbPress Forums
Discussion forums, or message boards, engage your community in communica-
tions, discussions, and debates about various topics. BuddyPress integrates 
discussion forums into your community to allow users to create, manage, and 
maintain their own message boards for groups they create within your net-
work. Group and community members post and reply to topics right from the 
community’s group pages — without leaving the member area.
bbPress (http://bbpress.org) is the discussion forum platform that inte-
grates with a BuddyPress community. The reason for this is simple, bbPress 
is part of the WordPress family of software and it integrates seamlessly 
with the WordPress platform. Figure 5-7 shows a forum integrated on the 
BuddyPress demo Web site for the Group called BuddyPress Testers. Within 
this group, members can start discussion threads and encourage other group 
members to participate in the conversation. For more information about 
groups and forums, including technical details on how to install bbPress on 
your Web site, see Chapter 8.
Friends
A community wouldn’t be social without friends, would it? The Friends 
component is really fun — it allows you and your users to add new friends 
that you’ve met within the community. Community friendships exist among 
people within the network who connect through requests. Each commu-
nity member has a list of people who are “friends” that anyone can browse. 
Additionally, members can click a name on the list to view the full profile, 
and even add that person as a friend on their own list.
Every member profile displays an Add Friend button so you can add friends 
while you’re browsing the Members Directory. Friend requests are e-mailed 
to the member, who then can log in to accept or decline your friendship 
request. After the request is accepted, your activity stream will appear on 
your friend’s wire, and vice versa, so you can keep track of what your friends 
are up to. You can also send private messages to your friends.

Part II: Getting Up and Running with BuddyPress 
Groups
The Groups component gives users the ability to create, well — groups! Think 
of groups as similar to cliques in high school— groups of kids who shared an 
interest in sports, music, theater, or chess; or even those geeks in the back 
of the room with their noses stuck to their computer monitors (you know the 
type . . . ahem). Groups in social communities like the one you’re running on 
your Web site with BuddyPress allow members to band together with other 
people who share the same interests and ideas so they can interact, discuss, 
and communicate with one another in their own little corner of your Web site.
BuddyPress also has a built-in Groups Directory. This listing of groups within 
your community is browseable and searchable. Figure 5-8 shows you the 
Groups Directory on the official BuddyPress test site at http://testbp.
org/groups. Using the drop-down menu above the Groups display (on the 
right), you can sort the Groups display by the following sorting methods:
 
✓ Last Active
 
✓ Most Members
 
✓ Newly Created
 
✓ Alphabetical
Additionally, BuddyPress ships with a Groups widget that gives you the ability to 
display a random listing of groups and that also includes navigation features to 
display groups by other criteria, such as newest, most active, and most popular.
For information on groups, including details on creating group forums, see 
Chapter 8.
Private Messaging
To re-use the high school analogy that I use in the Groups example, the 
Private Messaging component is just like passing notes to your best friend 
during Mr. Smith’s 4th period Geometry class — some things just cannot wait 
until recess! The difference within a BuddyPress community is that these 
are virtual notes and there’s no moderator standing by to reprimand you or 
asking whether you have something to share with the rest of the class!
Private messages sent among friends in a BuddyPress community are just 
that — private. When you send private messages to friends, the next time 
they log in to the community they see a notification that they have a new 
message. They can click the alert, read your message, and hit the Reply 
button to send a reply back to you, all within the confines of the network. 
And no one sees these messages except you and your friend.

91

Members can set up their notification preferences in their profile settings 
after they sign up and obtain an account. I cover these preferences in 
Chapter 6, but for now, just know that members have the ability to be noti-
fied via e-mail whenever they receive a new message.
Extended Profiles
On a regular WordPress MU–powered Web site — that is, one without the 
additional features of a BuddyPress community installed — users are asked 
to provide just two pieces of information when they sign up:
 
✓ A username
 
✓ An e-mail address
With the Extended Profiles component enabled in BuddyPress, you can ask 
your members to fill out all sorts of questions — beyond a username and an 
e-mail address — when they sign up for membership on your Web site. You 
can create your own questions or use the default ones. By default, there are 
two items asked of your members at signup:
 
✓ Name
 
✓ Photo upload of themselves

92
Part II: Getting Up and Running with BuddyPress 
On extended profiles, you can create an unlimited amount of information 
fields for your users to fill out that will display on their profiles. Some good 
examples of the information that you can ask your users to provide are
 
✓ Location, such as city, state, province, and country
 
✓ Birth date (you can exclude the year if you want to)
 
✓ Interests
 
✓ Occupation
 
✓ Web site addresses
 
✓ Other social network memberships, such as Twitter or Facebook
The more information fields that you provide on your users profiles, the 
more users can share about themselves with other members of your commu-
nity, which allows everyone to get to know each other beyond just a photo 
and a username. The only required bits of information are the user’s name, 
username, and e-mail address; sharing anything else is optional. Figure 5-9 
shows extended profile fields on my member profile, including Company, Job 
Title, Website, and Interests.
 
You’re asking your new members to share their e-mail address for signup and 
site administration notifications only. Member e-mail addresses are private 
and not shared within the public forum or community.

 Chapter 5: Configuring BuddyPress
The upcoming “Building Profile Groups and Fields” section covers everything 
you need to set up profile groups and fields for your community members to 
share their information.
Setting up bbPress Forums
The Forums Setup link on the BuddyPress menu takes you to where you set 
up the bbPress discussion forum software so your BuddyPress community 
can create group forums, which I discuss in Chapter 8. For more information 
on bbPress, see the following “What is bbPress” sidebar.
To navigate to the Forums Setup page on your WordPress MU dashboard, 
follow these three simple steps:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress MU dashboard.
 
 Point your browser to http://yourdomain.com/wp-login.php, 
enter your WordPress admin username and password, and then click 
the Log In button.
 
2. Expand the BuddyPress menu.
 
 On the left side of your WordPress MU dashboard, click the drop-down 
arrow on the BuddyPress menu. This expands the BuddyPress menu 
and displays several links beneath the menu title.
 
3. Browse to the Forums Setup page.
 
 Click the Forums Setup link on the BuddyPress menu. This loads the 
Forums Setup page, as shown in Figure 5-10, where you set up the initial 
settings for your community.
 
The Forums Setup link appears on the BuddyPress menu only when you 
enable bbPress Forums on the BuddyPress Component Setup page. If bbPress 
Forums is disabled, the Forums Setup link does not appear in the menu at all.
You have two options on the Forums Setup page:
 
✓ Set Up a New bbPress Installation: Use this option if bbPress is not 
installed on your Web server.
 
✓ Use an Existing bbPress Installation: Use this option if bbPress is 
installed on your Web server.
The next section of this chapter takes you through the steps of installing and 
setting up bbPress for use within your community.

What is bbPress?
bbPress is an open source discussion forum, 
or Internet message board, platform created 
by the folks at Automattic who created the 
WordPress, WordPress MU, and BuddyPress 
platforms and plugins. On the bbPress Web 
site at http://bbpress.org, you can 
read about bbPress, join in its discussion forum 
about the software, read the bbPress blog to 
learn about updates and upcoming releases of 
the software, and download the latest version 
of bbPress and related plugins and themes.
People use bbPress to run forums on their Web 
sites to encourage participation in discussions 
and debates on topics of interest to commu-
nity members. You don’t need WordPress or 
BuddyPress to use bbPress; however, bbPress 
integrates seamlessly with the WordPress and 
BuddyPress platforms, and allows site owners 
to share user information between the installa-
tions of WordPress or WordPress MU (with or 
without BuddyPress).
Perhaps the largest and most popular imple-
mentation of the bbPress software is the 
WordPress community support forum at 
http://wordpress.org/support.

95
 Chapter 5: Configuring BuddyPress
Setting up a new bbPress installation
To set up a brand new bbPress installation, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Set Up a New bbPress Installation button.
 
 The Forums Setup: New bbPress Installation page appears with a mes-
sage telling you that you need to complete the installation process, 
which is usually a fast and easy, one-click process.
 
2. Complete the installation of the bbPress software.
 
 Click the Complete Installation button. The Forums Setup page appears 
with a message telling you that you need to create a configuration file 
before you can use the Forum feature.
 
3. All Done!
 
 No, really — it is that quick and easy! BuddyPress writes a new file to 
your BuddyPress plugin directory into your WordPress installation 
directory called bb-config.php. This file contains the necessary 
information the software bbPress needs to connect to your existing 
WordPress MU database; for your reference, here is an example of what 
the bb-config.php file looks like:
$bb->custom_user_table = “wp_users”;
$bb->custom_user_meta_table = “wp_usermeta”;
$bb->uri = “http://yourdomain.com/wp-content/plugins/buddypress/bp-forums/
bbpress/”;
$bb->name = “ Forums”;
$bb->wordpress_mu_primary_blog_id = 1;
define(‘BB_AUTH_SALT’, “947e3f84ddfb12eda897156a25f8dd2898380993d27d1a3dbc5
5408ebe98 6a3a”);
define(‘BB_LOGGED_IN_SALT’, “d2e88a14f2fc60b99dcc080e4de2646b4173273d694df5
e14f110b132d5b 5e04”);
define(‘BB_SECURE_AUTH_SALT’, “b1d425584cb97341dfa1fdbed80f7fe516ea6f1bcd60
6dce82d08f050f81 5d56”);
define(‘WP_AUTH_COOKIE_VERSION’, 2);
?>
 
4. Return to the Forums Setup page.
 
 Click the Forums Setup link in the BuddyPress menu again. A successful 
installation of bbPress will result in a new message on the Forums Setup 
page that reads bbPress forum integration in BuddyPress has been set up 
correctly. If you are having problems, you can re-install.

96
Part II: Getting Up and Running with BuddyPress 
Using an existing bbPress installation
In the previous “What is bbPress” sidebar, I point out that bbPress can 
function as a stand-alone discussion forum platform on hundreds of sites 
across the Web without the presence of WordPress or BuddyPress. In fact, 
you might already have bbPress installed and running on your Web site, in 
which case, you don’t need to do a brand new installation. In cases like this, 
BuddyPress gives you the option to use an existing bbPress installation to 
integrate forums into your community. To accomplish this, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Use an Existing bbPress Installation button.
 
 This button appears on the Forums Setup page and when clicked, loads 
the Forums Setup: Existing bbPress Installation page.
 
2. Type in the location of the bb-config.php file.
 
 The Forums Setup: Existing bbPress Installation page appears with a 
message telling you to provide the location of the bb-config.php file 
from your existing bbPress installation directory. Type that file location 
in the bb-config.php File Location field. Your file location might look 
similar to /home/public_html/yourdomain/bbpress/.
Integration . . . what’s that?
I use the word integration several places in 
this chapter, and you might be wondering what 
that means, exactly. Integration means that the 
bbPress forum software shares the same data 
that WordPress MU and BuddyPress uses to 
define user accounts, such as usernames, pass-
words, e-mail addresses, and avatars (or photos). 
Data sharing is integral in creating a smoothly run 
social community that allows users to log in to 
their member account only once to access the 
various features within your network.
If, for example, you were running the bbPress 
forum software as a stand-alone message 
board without WordPress or BuddyPress, users 
would need to log in to the bbPress forum to 
participate. On a Web site running WordPress 
MU and BuddyPress in tandem with bbPress, 
requiring bbPress users to log in to use the 
forum after they already logged in to your com-
munity would be annoying. This is where inte-
gration comes into play.
When a user logs in to your community, a cookie 
stores in his browser directory that tells all the 
integrated pieces of software on your Web site 
(WordPress MU, BuddyPress, and bbPress) 
that the user is logged in. This means that the 
user’s credentials as a logged-in member are 
shared and recognized throughout the entire 
network.

3. Finish the installation procedure.
 
 Click the Complete Installation button at the bottom of the page to 
finish the installation of bbPress on your Web site. The Forums Setup 
page appears with a message telling you the bbPress integration in 
BuddyPress was successful.
With the bbPress forums installed on your Web site, along with WordPress 
MU and BuddyPress, your community setup is complete. Figure 5-11 shows 
an example group forum, as seen on the BuddyPress demo Web site at 
http://testbp.org. Your community members can use the Forum feature 
to add discussion forums to groups they create within your network. (See 
Chapter 6.)
At this point, no more software needs to be installed on your Web server to 
run your community unless you want to extend the functions and features 
of your community by using special add-ons called plugins. For informa-
tion about using plugins on your WordPress MU and BuddyPress Web 
site, see Chapter 13. Additionally, Chapter 15 contains a list of ten popular 
BuddyPress plugins that you can use to enhance your Web site.

Part II: Getting Up and Running with BuddyPress 
Building Profile Groups and Fields
Within any social community on the Web, members share information about 
themselves through profiles so that community members can get to know 
each other a little better.
The final item in the BuddyPress menu is Profile Field Setup. Clicking this link 
loads the Profile Field Setup page where you set up new profile groups and 
fields to display on the user sign-up page and member profiles. These groups 
and fields allow your community members to share additional information 
about themselves with the rest of your community.
Profile groups are groupings of profile questions. By default, BuddyPress 
creates the first group, Base, for you. The earlier section, “Configuring the 
General Settings,” gives you instructions on how to change the name of 
the default profile group. In that section, I change the name from Base to 
Information; but you can call the group whatever you want, I won’t stop you. 
Also by default, the Name field — users provide their name upon signup — is 
created for you and can be changed per your preference, too.
Although you can create as many profile groups as you want, the first profile 
group contains the fields that users fill out when registering for your Web 
site. All other profile groups are available for users to fill out, at their leisure, 
after they successfully sign up and log in. At that point, they can edit their 
profile and fill out the other profile fields that you provide within the differ-
ent groups.
Adding new profile fields
Figure 5-12 shows the Profile Field Setup page on my WordPress MU dash-
board. Notice that the profile group name, Information, displays at the top of 
the group, and the following fields (that I created) are within that group:
 
✓ People Call Me (Core): This field is actually the default Name field on a 
new installation of BuddyPress. You can change the name of this field on 
the BuddyPress General Settings page, but you cannot delete this field 
because it contains information that BuddyPress uses to create the base 
of a member’s profile.
 
✓ Occupation: Asks users to provide information on what they do for a 
living.
 
✓ Web Site: Gives members a chance to publicize their own Web site on 
their profile.

99
 Chapter 5: Configuring BuddyPress
 
Figure 5-12: 
The 
BuddyPress 
Profile Field 
Setup page.
 
 
✓ City: Asks members to tell everyone the city they live in.
 
✓ State/Province: Asks members to provide the state or province they 
reside in.
 
✓ Interests: Asks members to provide a list of items that interest them, 
such as hobbies they like to do in their free time.
You start by adding a field to the default profile group; from there, you 
can create additional new fields as needed. The following steps add an 
Occupation field to the default profile group:
 
1. Click the Add New Field link.
 
 The Add New Field link is located at the bottom of each Profile Group 
box, as seen in Figure 5-12. The Add Field page appears.
 
2. Type Occupation in the Field Title text box.
 
 This field name will display on the Edit Profile page.

100
Part II: Getting Up and Running with BuddyPress 
 
3. Type a description of your new field in the Field Description text box.
 
 The description is a short line of text that tells the user what type of 
information you’re asking for. For example, the Field Description for the 
Occupation field could read What do you do for a living?
 
4. Choose the required status on the Is This Field Required? drop-down 
menu.
 
 To require this information from your members when they register for 
your Web site, choose Required on the drop-down menu; to make the 
information optional, select Not Required.
 
5. Choose the field type on the Field Type drop-down menu.
 
 BuddyPress gives you seven Field Type options. Select the option that 
best fits the type of answer you want your members to provide:
 
• Text Box: For answers that require only single lines of text, such as 
Occupation.
 
• Multi-Line Text Box: For answers that require multiple lines, or 
maybe a paragraph of text, such as Your Bio.
 
• Date Selector: For answers that require dates (day, month, year), 
such as Birthday.
 
• Radio Buttons: For answers that require one selection from a few 
possible answers, such as a yes/no question.
 
• Drop-Down Select Box: For answers that require a drop-down menu 
where users can select one of several possible answers, such as 
a listing of all 50 states where the member need only pick the one 
they reside in.
 
• Multi Select Box: For answers that require a drop-down menu 
where members can select more than one answer from a drop-
down list of several possible answers, such as a listing of languages 
the member currently speaks.
 
• Checkboxes: For answers where more than one response can be 
selected from a checklist of items, such as Pets: Dog, Cat, Fish, Bird, in 
which case, members can check one, or all, answers for this question.
 
6. Save your changes.
 
 Click the Save button at the bottom of the page to save the changes 
you’ve made to your new profile field.
Figure 5-13 illustrates how the profile fields that I created look on my member 
profile in my community.

Creating new profile groups
In the previous section, I mention that the default profile group contains the 
profile fields presented to a member when they go through the sign up pro-
cess. Figure 5-14 shows the Sign Up page where each of the profile fields that 
I created are displayed and just waiting for a new member to come along and 
answer.
The fields from new profile groups that you create do not appear on the reg-
istration page. They appear on the member’s profile on the Edit Profile page 
(see Figure 5-15) where members can fill out the remaining fields at their lei-
sure. Links to each profile group you create appear as tabs on the Edit Profile 
page. For example, I created two new profile groups for testing purposes 
called Profile Group 2 and Profile Group 3, which display as links in the tab 
menu navigation.

To create new profile group, make sure you’re on the Profile Field Setup page 
and follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add New Group Link.
 
 You find this link at the bottom of the page. Once clicked, the Add Group 
page appears.
 
2. Name the new profile group.
 
 Type the name you want assigned to this new group in the Profile Group 
Name text box.
 
3. Add the new group.
 
 Click the Add Group button; you return to the Profile Field Setup page 
and see your new profile group displayed. You can add new profile fields 
to this new group by following the step-by-step instructions in the previ-
ous section.

103
 Chapter 5: Configuring BuddyPress
 
Figure 5-15: 
Profile fields 
on the Edit 
Profile page.
 
Using extended profiles, you can tailor the personal details shared by mem-
bers to the theme (or genre) of your social community. For example, a sports 
community could create profile groups and fields that encourage members 
to share details about their favorite sports teams and players. A music com-
munity could ask members to share their preferences about music groups, 
genres, and artists that they enjoy. Members can update their profile infor-
mation as often as they want, too. Additionally, the answers your members 
provide are searchable within member directories. Therefore, if you want to 
see members who live in Wisconsin, you can search for the term Wisconsin 
and get a listing of all members who have that state listed in their member 
profile. Figure 5-16 shows the search results on the BuddyPress test site at 
http://testbp.org — I used the search term Wisconsin all members in 
that community from Wisconsin. Of the 14,550 total members, 4 are from 
Wisconsin — I was surprised to find so many!

Part III
Understanding 
BuddyPress 
Features

In this part . . .
O
kay! You’ve installed WordPress, and BuddyPress is 
up and running — time to explore all the features 
BuddyPress has to offer you and your community mem-
bers. In this part, you explore extended member profiles, 
avatars, activity streams, friends, groups and forums. You 
also discover the multiple blog option in WordPress to 
enable your community members to build their own blogs 
in your community.

Chapter 6
Exploring Your New Community
In This Chapter
▶ Registering as a new member
▶ Using the admin bar
▶ Editing your profile
▶ Managing messages
▶ Making and adding new friends
▶ Creating and joining new groups
▶ Discovering your activity stream
▶ Browsing community directories
W
hen you’re familiar with the BuddyPress components and know how 
to set them up in your community, it’s time to have a look at how 
those components will appear on the front end of your site. In other words, 
what will users see on your site after they sign up to become a member?
This chapter steps you through registering as a new member on your site; 
setting up and editing your member profile; uploading and cropping your 
avatar (or photo); using the admin bar to navigate the areas of your commu-
nity; making and adding new friends within the community; understanding 
activity streams, groups, and forums;, and using the Members, Groups, and 
Blogs directories.
When you’re done with this chapter, you’ll understand how all the 
BuddyPress components work together to form a fun and interactive social 
community on your Web site, and you’ll have the knowledge you need to sup-
port your member community.
 
In this chapter, and all subsequent chapters, I am using the BuddyPress 
Default theme. Because BuddyPress has two different themes available — the 
BuddyPress Default and BuddyPress Classic — some of the things I describe 
in this chapter may look different on your system if you are using the Classic 
theme on your site.

108
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
Signing Up as a New Member
The first step any prospective member of your community must take is reg-
istering to become a member of your site; without that step — she cannot 
enjoy the benefits of membership. It’s a good idea for you to go through the 
process of signing up as a new member so you can experience what your 
members will experience. To accomplish this, be sure you log out of your 
WordPress dashboard by clicking the Log Out link in the top-right corner.
New member registration
The following steps assume that you’re using the default BuddyPress themes. 
If you’re not using those themes, then some of these steps may vary, and 
you’ll have to make adjustments based on the theme you are using. (See Part 
IV of this book for more information about BuddyPress themes.) To sign up 
as a new member, proceed with the following steps:
 
1. Browse to your site at http://yourdomain.com.
 
 Replace yourdomain.com with your own domain name, where you 
installed WordPress MU and BuddyPress.
 
2. Click the Sign Up link in the Site Admin menu.
 
 The Sign Up page (http://yourdomain.com/register) appears 
with several fields of information that need to be filled out, including the 
profile fields that you created for the default profile group in Chapter 5. 
Figure 6-1 shows the Sign Up page.
 
3. Type your desired user name in the Username field.
 
 This required field needs to be at least four characters in length. 
Because this account is for your testing purposes only, enter tester in 
the Username field. This username becomes part of the URL for the 
member profile. For example, with the username of tester, the member 
profile URL is http://yourdomain.com/members/tester.
 
4. Type your e-mail address in the Email Address field.
 
 This required field needs to be an e-mail account that you can access. 
The e-mail address entered here is the one in which members receive 
all community-related notifications, including their account username 
and password login information. Additionally, member accounts are lim-
ited to one e-mail address, so if you’re already using an e-mail address 
for a member account, you cannot develop another account using the 
same e-mail address. For your testing purposes, enter a different e-mail 
address than the one you’re using for your WordPress MU admin user 
account.

109
 Chapter 6: Exploring Your New Community
 
Figure 6-1: 
The default 
BuddyPress 
Sign Up 
page.
 
 
5. Type your desired password in the Choose a Password field.
 
 Your password can be anything you want it to be, but make sure the 
password is difficult for other people to guess. After you type the pass-
word into the Choose a Password field, you have to re-type the same 
password into the Confirm Password field — both are required.
 
6. Select the Yes, I’d Like to Create a New Blog check box.
 
 This causes the system to create a blog for your test account when you 
sign up. Users can choose not to create a blog and bypass this selection 
altogether; they are not required to set up a blog within your network. If 
they don’t select this box, users will have a member profile only, but can 
choose to create a blog within your network later if they want to.
 
7. Type your desired Blog address in the Blog URL text box.
 
 The Blog URL is the Web address of your blog within your community. 
For your testing purposes, type testblog in the Blog URL field. This cre-
ates the Blog URL of http://testblog.yourdomain.com if you’re 
using the WordPress MU subdomain setup, or http://yourdomain.
com/testblog if you’re using the WordPress MU subdirectory setup. 
(See Chapter 2 regarding subdomains versus subdirectories for member 
blogs in WordPress MU.)

110
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
 
8. Type your desired title in the Blog Title text box.
 
 Here is where you can give your blog a name. The Blog Title displays 
at the top of your blog so everyone knows what your blog is about. For 
your testing purposes, type My Test Blog in the Blog Title field.
 
9. Select Blog privacy options.
 
 This selection states, “I would like my blog to appear in search engines 
and in public listings around this site.” Select Yes to make your blog 
public and viewable in your community profile and blog directories, and 
to allow search engines (such as Google or Yahoo!) to see your blog and 
record it in their search directories. Select No if you want to hide your 
blog from community profiles, directories, and search engines.
 
10. Type your name in the Name text box.
 
 This is a required field. Type your name the way you want it to appear 
on your member profile.
 
11. Fill out the remaining profile fields.
 
 The profile fields that you add to the default profile group (see Chapter 5) 
will appear on the registration page. Fill in the requested information and 
keep in mind that the answers you provide display on your member profile.
 
12. Click the Complete Sign Up button.
 
 A new page appears with a message that reads, “Sign Up Complete!” 
Your new account is created and you receive an e-mail at the address 
you provided in Step 4.
 
13. While you wait for the e-mail from Step 12 to arrive — upload your 
avatar.
 
 An avatar is a photo or graphic image that visually represents you in 
the community. It appears on your member profile, in all comments you 
leave on member blogs and wires, and next to your activity streams 
throughout the community site. A default image displays for you, but 
you probably want to change it to something a little more personal and 
specific to you. To change your default avatar, follow these steps:
 
a. Click the Browse button.
 
 A dialog box appears where you select a photo that you want to 
use from a directory on your computer. Select the file and click 
Open (or just double-click the file); the dialog box closes.
 
b. Click the Upload Image button.
 
 The file uploads from your computer to your Web server where it 
is stored in a folder in your WordPress installation directory.
 
c. Resize your image.

111
 Chapter 6: Exploring Your New Community
 
 BuddyPress provides a built-in cropping tool that allows you to 
crop your chosen file to a size of your preference. To use the crop-
ping tool, you drag the edges of the box, shown in Figure 6-2, to the 
size you prefer. Everything inside the borders of the box displays 
as your avatar within the community. When you’re done, click the 
Crop Image button; the page reloads and shows your new avatar. If 
you’re unhappy with the image, you can follow these steps again to 
upload and crop a new image.
 
Figure 6-2: 
The crop-
ping tool 
allows you 
to crop and 
resize your 
avatar.
 
Activating a new member account
During the signup process, an e-mail is sent to an address you provide that 
contains a link that you must click to activate the new user account. Skipping 
this step prevents the user account from creating fully. When you click the 
link, a browser window opens, and the Account Activate page on your commu-
nity Web site appears with a message that reads, “Your account was activated 
successfully! You can now log in with the username and password you provided 

112
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
when you signed up.” At that point, you can log in to your site using the user-
name and password that you created by following these steps:
 
1. Type your username in the Username field.
 
 The login area is located in the top right of your Web site. Type the user-
name that you designated when you signed up for this account; if you 
followed the steps in the preceding section, the username you created is 
tester.
 
2. Type your password in the text box to the right of the Username field.
 
 Type the password that you designated during the signup process.
 
3. Click the Log In button.
 
 The front page of your site reloads. At this point, the login area disap-
pears and your avatar and username display. When you click your 
username, your member profile appears at http://yourdomain.com/
members/tester.
Figure 6-3 shows my “tester” profile complete with avatar and the informa-
tion I filled out during the sign-up process.

Now you have a regular member account. You can use this account to test 
all the features in your community the way a regular member would. The 
next sections of this chapter cover those features in detail from a member’s 
perspective.
Navigating the Admin Bar
You might have already noticed the admin bar located at the top of every 
page on your Web site (see Figure 6-4). Community members use the admin 
bar to navigate through the areas and sections of your Web site, and through-
out your community.

 Chapter 6: Exploring Your New Community
 
In Chapter 5, I describe an option available to the site administrator that hides 
the admin bar from logged-out users. If you want site visitors, including ones 
who aren’t logged in as a member, to see the admin bar, then be sure to select 
No on the Hide Admin Bar for Logged Out Users? option on the BuddyPress 
Settings page. If you want only members who are logged in to see the admin 
bar, then select Yes for that setting. The choice is yours — I report, you decide!
Exploring Your Profile
When you activate a community account, your profile is your gateway into 
the community’s features. When you’re logged in, your profile gives you 
menu options in the navigation bar above your profile information. Notice 
the options are the same as those in the My Account menu on the admin bar. 
You can choose whichever menu is more comfortable for you to use when 
navigating the features.
 
Your profile page looks slightly different when you aren’t logged in to the 
community. Figure 6-3 shows a profile of a member who’s logged in. Figure 6-5 
shows a profile of a member who’s logged out. When logged out, you are not 
able to see the menu options in the navigation bar above your profile, and a 
login form appears at the top of the sidebar on the right of the page.
 
Figure 6-5: A 
BuddyPress 
profile of a 
user who’s

116
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
A light gray menu with several navigation options appears above your pro-
file information (refer to Figure 6-3). When you’re navigating your profile, 
another subnavigation menu appears beneath those navigation options, 
which gives you the ability to edit or view different options for your account. 
For example, when you choose Profile in the navigation menu, the subnaviga-
tion menu displays any options you have for the Profile feature.
Activity
The first menu item is the Activity feature. Click Activity and the Activity 
page loads in your browser window and lists only your recent activity within 
the community. The types of activities listed here include
 
✓ Blog posts: When you publish a new blog post on your community blog, 
the title of the blog post displays in you’re Activity stream with a link 
to your new blog post. If my new blog post were titled, “BuddyPress 
is really neat!” the My Activity stream would display Lisa Sabin-Wilson 
wrote a new blog post: BuddyPress is really neat! Additionally, the time 
since that activity happened would display, such as 1 hour ago or 2 
months ago.
 
✓ New friendships: When you add a new friend to your network, it dis-
plays in you’re My Activity stream. Figure 6-6 shows a listing on my 
Activity page that reads, “You and Tester are now friends.” The name 
Tester links to Tester’s profile, too.
 
✓ Group activity: All activity related to groups posts to your My Activity 
stream, such as new groups you create or join, new comments you leave 
on a group wire, and any topics you comment on (or create) in a group 
forum.
 
✓ Profile updates: Updates you make to your profile list in your My 
Activity stream. For example, your Activity page will mention if you 
change your avatar or update your profile fields.
 
✓ Status updates: All status updates you make post to your My Activity 
stream. (See the upcoming “Updating your status” section for more info 
about updating your status.)
Navigating the Activity page
The Activity page lists the 25 most recent updates per page — click the 
Load More link at the bottom to automatically load the next 25 most recent 
updates on the page.

New friendship listing
Above the My Activity stream, on the right side, you see a drop-down menu. 
(By default, the menu says, No Filter.) This menu gives you, and anyone else 
browsing your community pages, the ability to sort and filter the display of 
Activity listings on this page. The options provided within that drop-down 
menu include:
 
✓ No Filter: This option creates an Activity listing of all possible activities 
within the community. This is the default option.
 
✓ Updates Only: Choosing this option changes the display on the page 
to a list of status updates. (See the upcoming section, “Updating your 
status,” for more information about status updates.)
 
✓ New Blog Posts Only: Choosing this option changes the display on the 
page to a list of new blog posts.
 
✓ New Blog Comments Only: This option filters the activity listing to dis-
play only new blog comments.
 
✓ New Group Forum Topics Only: This option filters the activity listing to 
display only new topics created within Group forums.

118
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
 
✓ New Group Forum Replies Only: Choosing this option changes the 
display on the page to list only new replies made within Group forums — 
which is nice way of keeping track of new discussions going on within the 
different forums within your community.
 
✓ New Friendships Only: This menu option filters the activity listing 
to display newly created friendships between members within the 
community.
On each activity listing, a Comment link appears after the update. When 
clicked, this link opens a text box that allows any member to leave a com-
ment. Figure 6-7 shows the comment text box beneath an activity listing of a 
new friendship.
 
Figure 6-7: 
Members 
can easily

comment on 
any activ-
ity listing 
with the

link.
 
Updating your status
Above the Activity listings is a text box where you can provide a quick status 
update. Status updates are usually short one- to two-line statements you 
write to update your friends and other community members about what 
you’re doing. If you’ve ever used the Twitter platform, you know exactly what 
I’m talking about. Twitter is considered a “micro-blogging’” service where 
members of the Twitter community can update their status, 140 characters 
at a time, to provide their friends and followers with details of exactly what 
they’re doing at that moment.
You can use status updates in various ways:
 
✓ Give a quick update on what you’re doing right this moment. For 
example, if I were to update my status right now in a BuddyPress com-
munity, I would probably write something like I’m about halfway done 
with writing Chapter 6 of my BuddyPress latest book: BuddyPress For 
Dummies!, as seen in Figure 6-8.

119
 Chapter 6: Exploring Your New Community
 
Figure 6-8: 
My latest 
status

BuddyPress 
demo Web 
site.
 
 
✓ Ask a question that community members will see. You can ask a ques-
tion like Does anyone have any good examples of a live BuddyPress com-
munity site? — and with any luck, you’ll get a good answer. Community 
members an respond to you by clicking the Comment link on your 
status update. (By the way, you can find some great examples of live 
BuddyPress community sites in Chapter 17.)
 
✓ Share a helpful tip or resource with your friends in the community. 
For example, Hey! I just found this great book called BuddyPress For 
Dummies — everyone should read it!
There are no rules for status updates, you can use them any way you want. 
The following steps show you how to update your status on your profile:
 
1. Visit your profile.
 
 You need to be logged in to update your status. You can view your pro-
file at http://yourdomain.com/members/tester (where your
domain.com is the domain of your Web site).
 
2. Click the Activity link in the navigation menu.
 
 The Activity page loads, showing a text box at the top.

3. Type your update in the What’s New? text box.
 
4. Click the Post Update button.
 
 This saves and then displays the text of your status update with a time-
stamp of how long ago you made the update (for example, 1 minute ago, 
1 hour ago, 10 days ago, and so on).
You can update your status as often as you want; there are no time restric-
tions on when you can do it. Your status update also appears to the right of 
your Member Avatar on your Profile page. That status update will change the 
next time you type in a new status update on the Activity page.
Profile
The second menu item is the Profile feature. Click Profile, and the Profile 
page loads in your browser window. Earlier in this chapter, you see what a 
profile looks like in a BuddyPress community (refer to Figure 6-3). A member 
profile displays the following items:
 
✓ The amount of time since you were last active in the community (for 
example, as shown in Figure 6-6, Active 1 Minute Ago)
 
✓ Your avatar (or photo)
 
✓ Your latest status update
 
✓ The Add Friend button, which allows other community members to 
request your friendship
 
✓ The Send Message button, which allows your established friends to send 
you a private message
 
✓ The information from the profile fields that you fill out when you sign up.
On the subnavigation menu on the Profile page, you see three additional 
options that you can use to sort the Profile menu:
 
✓ Public: This Profile menu default view shows you exactly how your pro-
file looks to others when they view your profile page.
 
✓ Edit Profile: Where you can edit the details in your profile, including the 
profile fields that you set up previously.
 
✓ Change Avatar: Where you can edit your avatar by uploading a new one, 
or re-cropping the one you currently have.

121
 Chapter 6: Exploring Your New Community
Editing your profile information
On the subnavigation menu on the Profile page, the second option, Edit 
Profile, is where you can update and add new profile information as often as 
you like. To create new profile groups and fields for your members to fill out 
so they can add information to their profile, see Chapter 5.
Figure 6-9 displays the Editing page for my profile.
 
Figure 6-9: 
Editing 
personal 
profile 
information.
 
The profile group contains the questions I filled out when I signed up as 
a member. (As I discuss in Chapter 5, this default profile group is set up 
for you when you install BuddyPress on your site.) The remaining ques-
tions contain profile information that I can fill out after I log in and choose 
Profile➪Edit Profile.
To edit your profile, fill out the profile fields with the information requested. 
Be sure to click the Save Changes button at the bottom of each profile group 
when you finish. If you visit your public profile (by choosing Public on the 

122
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
subnavigation menu), you see your information is updated. Notice that some 
of the words in your profile are hyperlinked. Check out the following “Profile 
data — filtered” sidebar to find out why hyperlinks are a great feature for 
your community members.
Changing your avatar
On the subnavigation menu on the Profile page, the last option, Change 
Avatar, is where you upload and crop a new avatar to display on your profile. 
The method of accomplishing this is the same one you use during the user 
registration process; see the earlier “New member registration” section to 
change your avatar.
Blogs
The third menu item is the Blogs feature. Click Blogs, and the Blogs page 
loads in your browser window where you see a listing by title of the blogs 
that you own, or are a member of, within the community. The blog titles are 
hyperlinked, meaning you and other community members can click a blog’s 
title to load it in your browser window.
Above the Blogs listing is a drop-down menu that allows you to filter the dis-
play of your blogs by the following sort methods:
 
✓ Last Active
 
✓ Newest
 
✓ Alphabetical
Filtering the display of Blogs on the page is especially helpful if you own or 
are a member of several different blogs within the community.
Profile data — filtered
On your profile, you see that some of the words 
and phrases are a different color and are under-
lined (if you’re using the BuddyPress Default 
theme). When you click such text, called a 
hyperlink, a page that lists other members who 
have the same words in their profile appears. 
This feature is helpful because it gives you the 
opportunity to discover members within the 
community who have the same interests, live in 
the same area, or do the same type of work that 
you do. For example, when I click Author on my 
profile, a directory of community members who 
have the word Author in their profile appears. 
From there, I can communicate with other 
authors and share experiences, resources, and 
information about a field and activity that we 
have in common.

123
 Chapter 6: Exploring Your New Community
Messages
The next menu item is the Messages feature. After you add community 
members as friends, you can send private messages to them, and they can 
send messages to you. Click Messages, and the Messages page loads in your 
browser window where you can read, send, and manage messages for your 
user account. Three options appear in the subnavigation menu: Inbox, Sent 
Messages, and Compose.
Managing your Inbox
When you choose Messages➪Inbox, you can read messages sent to you by 
your community friends. A short excerpt of the messages displays with your 
friends’ avatars (photo), their names, the dates the messages were sent, and 
the title of their messages. Click a message title to read the full content of the 
message.
You can sort your Inbox by using the Select drop-down menu on the Inbox 
page. BuddyPress gives you three options to sort messages by:
 
✓ Read: Displays messages that you’ve read.
 
✓ Unread: Displays messages that you haven’t read.
 
✓ All: The default displays all messages sent to you, read or unread.
Managing messages in your Inbox is a pretty easy task. Figure 6-10 illustrates 
that I have two messages in my Inbox. The number to the right of the Inbox 
option in the subnavigation menu changes depending on the amount of mes-
sages you have in your Inbox. If there are no messages in your Inbox, nothing 
displays next to the Inbox option.
On the Inbox page, you can delete a message by clicking the Close button 
(the small red box with the white X in the middle), shown to the right of the 
message excerpts in Figure 6-10.
You can further manage the messages in your Inbox by using the links above 
the Inbox section and the check boxes shown to the right of the message 
excerpts in Figure 6-10. Select the check box next to the message you want to 
manage, and then choose one of the following links from the menu:
 
✓ Mark as Read: BuddyPress displays that message as one that you’ve 
already read. Additionally, the notification icon on the admin bar that tells 
you the number of unread messages you have in your Inbox turns off.
 
✓ Mark as Unread: BuddyPress displays that message as one that you 
haven’t read. The notification icon in the admin bar remains active as a 
reminder that the message is in your Inbox.

124
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
 
✓ Delete Selected: BuddyPress deletes the selected message from your 
Inbox. Be careful with this one, though, because there’s no confirmation 
message asking you whether you’re sure that you want to delete the 
message. When you click the Delete Selected link, the Inbox page reloads 
and states the message has been deleted — and sure enough, the mes-
sage is gone forever.
 
Figure 6-10: 
The Inbox 
page 
displays 
private mes-
sages from

friends.
 
Reading and replying to Inbox messages
To read a message listed in your Inbox, click the message’s title. A new page 
loads and displays the full content. This page also keeps a record of your 
conversations with the message sender regarding this message, so when you 
send a reply, it lists on this page, too. Figure 6-11 shows a message thread 
between a friend within the community and me. The original message is at 
the top, followed by any subsequent replies and a text box at the bottom for 
you to easily add more to the private conversation.
Viewing messages you’ve sent
When you choose Messages➪Sent Messages, you see only the messages sent 
by you to other community friends. You can view and manage those mes-
sages the same way you do on the Inbox page; review the previous section 
and apply that information to the Sent Messages page.

Composing a new message
The next option in the Messages menu is Compose. When you choose 
Messages➪Compose, the Compose page appears where you can compose 
a new message to send to a community friend. To compose a new message, 
follow these steps:
 
1. In the Send To field, type the username of the friend you want to send 
the message to.
 
2. (Optional) Send as a notice to all users,
 
 Underneath the Send To field is the This Is a Notice to All Users 
checkbox — check this box if you want your message to be sent to 
all users within the community.
 
3. In the Subject field, type a message subject.
 
 The subject also serves as the message title that displays in your 
friend’s Inbox.
 
4. In the Message text box, type the body of your message.
 
 There are no character or word count limits here, so your message can 
be as short or as long as you need it to be.
 
5. Click the Send Message button at the bottom of the Compose page to 
send the message to your friend.

126
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
Notifications
The final option in the Messages menu is Notices. When you click the Notices 
link, the Notices page loads and lists all new notifications you have received. 
Notices can include several items, such as
 
✓ New friendship requests
 
✓ Newly received, unread messages
 
✓ Replies to messages you have sent
 
✓ New Group invitations
Additionally, when you have new notices waiting for you, you will see a notifi-
cation alert. This alert — a bright white circle with a number in the center — 
appears in the admin bar at the top of every BuddyPress community page next 
to the Notifications item. The number within the circle indicates how many 
new notifications you have. You can see this in play in Figure 6-10.
Friends
Friendships are made and lost in social communities around the Web, and a 
BuddyPress-powered community is no different.
The next menu item is the Friends feature. Choosing Friends➪ Friends loads 
the My Friends page, which lists all the friends you’ve added within the com-
munity. Figure 6-12 shows my Friends list on a BuddyPress community Web 
site.
Viewing and sorting your My Friends list
The My Friends page, by default, displays your newest friends in the com-
munity first. The Friends list reveals your friends’ avatars, names, and times 
since their last recorded community action, and a button giving you the 
option to cancel your friendship with each person.
You can further sort your friends by using the drop-down menu above the 
listing. This drop-down menu allows you to sort your Friends list by:
 
✓ Last Active
 
✓ Newest Registered
 
✓ Alphabetical

127
 Chapter 6: Exploring Your New Community

Groups
If membership in the exclusive community on your site isn’t enough, you and 
other community members can create new groups and join existing groups 
within your community. In Chapter 5, I describe groups and using them in 
your BuddyPress community. The Groups feature is the place to go to view 
groups you belong to, create new groups, and invite your friends to commu-
nity groups you’re associated with.
Choosing Groups➪My Groups loads the My Groups page, which lists commu-
nity groups you either own or belong to. Figure 6-13 illustrates the My Groups 
page where the group’s avatar, title, number of members, and description 
display for easy understanding and navigation.

Viewing and sorting your My Groups list
Above the My Groups section is a drop-down menu of options that allow you 
to further sort your list by the following sort methods:
 
✓ Last Active: The My Groups page, by default, displays your most 
recently active groups first.
 
✓ Most Members: Sorts your My Groups list to display the groups with the 
highest amount of members.
 
✓ Newly Created: Sorts your My Groups list to display the groups creation 
date, from newest to oldest.
 
✓ Alphabetical: This option sorts the My Groups list in alphabetical order, 
A through Z.
Creating a new group
If you want to create your own group within a Buddypress community, click 
the Groups link in the top-right navigation menu — then click the Create a 
Group button. This loads the Create a Group page, where you can create a 

129
 Chapter 6: Exploring Your New Community
community group on any topic, theme, or interest you want. Simply create 
the group and then invite other friends from the community to join. To create 
a new group, choose Groups➪Create a Group, as shown in Figure 6-14, and 
then follow these steps:
 
Figure 6-14: 
Creating a 
new group 
in your 
BuddyPress 
community.
 
 
1. Type the name of your group.
 
 The Group Name field is where you type in the name of the group you 
are creating.
 
2. Type the group description.
 
 The Group Description field is where you type a short description of 
your new group.
 
3. Enter any recent group news.
 
 If your new group has any recent news you want to share, type it in the 
Recent News field.
 
4. Click the Create and Continue button.

130
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
 
 This loads the Create a Group — Settings page where you can choose 
whether to enable discussion forums for your group. If you do, place a 
check mark in the box labeled Enable Discussion Forum.
 
 Additionally, you have three privacy options to choose from:
 
• This Is a Public Group: Any member of the community can join, 
and the group is listed in the community’s group directory and in 
search results. Additionally, the group content (wire posts, mem-
bers, forum topics, and discussions) are viewable by any member 
of the community.
 
• This Is a Private Group: Requires that community members request 
to join the group. Requests are sent to the group administrator (or 
creator) for approval. The group is listed in group directories and 
search results; however, the group’s content is viewable to only 
approved members of the group.
 
• This Is a Hidden Group: Allows membership by invite only; the site 
administrator (or creator) has to invite the members before they 
can join. This group is not included in group directories or search 
results, and the group’s content is viewable to only approved 
members of the group.
 
5. Click the Next Step button.
 
 This loads the Create a Group — Avatar page where you can upload and 
crop an avatar that represents the group within the community.
 
6. Upload and crop the group avatar.
 
 The steps for uploading and cropping a group avatar are the same as the 
steps to upload an avatar for your profile. Follow the steps in the earlier 
“New member registration” section to upload and crop your group’s 
avatar.
 
7. Click the Next Step button.
 
 The Create a Group — Group Invites page appears where you can select 
from your friends list who you want to invite to join your new group.
 
8. Click the Finish button.
 
 Your new group’s page loads in your browser window. The group I cre-
ated during this process is shown in Figure 6-15.
Managing a newly created group
After you create a new group, as the group administrator, you need to know a 
few things about managing the group. The Groups menu provides easy navi-
gation to the Admin, Forums, and Members options, as shown in Figure 6-16, 
but it also links to helpful options that are available to only the site adminis-
trator. Your options on the Groups subnavigation menu are

131
 Chapter 6: Exploring Your New Community
 
Figure 6-15: 
A newly 
created 
group on a 
BuddyPress 
community 
site.
 
 
✓ Home: This link is visible to all members of the group and returns you to 
the Groups front page.
 
✓ Admin: This link is visible to only the group administrator and contains 
the following options for group management, as shown in Figure 6-16:
 
• Edit Details: Edit the group name, description, news, and notifica-
tion preferences.
 
• Group Settings: Edit the settings for enabling the comment wire or 
discussion form and set the privacy options for the group.
 
• Group Avatar: Change the group avatar by uploading and cropping 
a new image.
 
• Manage Members: View a listing of all members of the group and 
manage their settings.
 
 You can also “Kick/Ban” a member, which removes the member 
from the group and disallows them from re-joining the group in the 
future. You would do this for a group member who is being par-
ticularly difficult, or who has been harassing other members of the 
group, and so on. The decision to ban a member from the group is 
at the discretion of the group administrator.

132
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
 
 Additionally, you can promote a member to Moderator or 
Administrator status, which increases the member’s access to 
administrative group settings. Usually, group administrators pro-
mote another member to help moderate a particularly busy group 
where the administrator might need help with member and topic 
management. Additionally, you are able to demote a member 
from moderator or administrator to a normal member, with no 
advanced privileges.
 
• Delete Group: Delete the group completely from the community. 
Be careful using this option because it deletes everything — group 
wire comments, group forum discussions, and member lists — and 
removes the group from site directories, search results, and activ-
ity streams. Be aware that deleting a group is permanent — once 
you do this, all group data is completely lost and there is no way to 
get it back — so be careful with this option!
 
✓ Forum: This link is visible to all group members and loads the group 
forum page where you and other members of your group can view and 
create forum topics and discussions within the group.

tor can edit

133
 Chapter 6: Exploring Your New Community
 
✓ Members: This link is visible to all group members and loads the group 
Member Directory for the group, which displays members’ avatars and 
names. Each name is a hyperlink that takes you to that member’s profile.
 
✓ Send Invites: This link is visible to only the group administrator and 
loads a listing of your friends that you can select and send group invites 
to. The members you invite get a notification via e-mail and a notifica-
tion in the admin bar at the top of the site.
 
✓ Leave Group: This link is visible to all community members and gives 
them the option of leaving the group completely. They can rejoin the 
group later if they choose to. Group administrators aren’t allowed to 
leave their own group, so Group administrators will not see the Leave 
Group option in the navigation menu.
Above the Group listings is a drop-down menu that allows you and other group 
members to sort the display of group activity by the following methods:
 
✓ Updates Only: Choosing this option displays a listing of updates made 
by group members.
 
✓ Group Forum Activity Only: Choosing this option displays a listing of 
group forum topics and discussion.
 
✓ Blog Activity Only: Choosing this option displays a listing of blog activ-
ity (posts and comments) from group members.
Settings
The next menu item is the Settings feature. Choose Settings➪General to
 
✓ Change your account e-mail address.
 
✓ Change your password by typing a new password in the Change 
Password text box, re-typing it in the second text box, and then clicking 
the Save Changes button.
The second option on the Settings subnavigation menu is Notifications where 
you can set your community e-mail notification preferences, as shown in 
Figure 6-17. Select Yes if you want notifications by e-mail; select No if you’d 
rather not receive e-mail notifications. Notifications are sent for the following 
events:
 
✓ Messages: You receive an e-mail when another member sends you a pri-
vate message or a new site notice is posted.
 
✓ Friends: You receive an e-mail when another member sends you a 
friendship request or accepts your friendship request.

134
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
 
✓ Groups: You receive an e-mail when another member invites you to join 
their group, when group information updates, when a member posts a 
wire message to a group you belong to, when you’re promoted to group 
administrator or moderator, and when a member requests to join a 
group that you marked private in the group settings.
 
Figure 6-17: 
Set your 
e-mail 
notification 
preferences 
on the 
Notifica-
tions page.
 
 
By default, all e-mail notification preferences are marked as Yes; you’ll 
automatically receive e-mail notifications whenever any of those events 
occurs unless you go to the Settings page and change your e-mail notifica-
tion preferences.
Discovering Site Wide Activity, 
Directories, and Searches
What good is a community of active, social members if they cannot find 
activities or other members within the community? About as good as photog-
rapher without a camera, I’d say. That’s why BuddyPress communities come 
with the following features:

135
 Chapter 6: Exploring Your New Community
 
✓ Site Activity stream: A listing of activities that have happened through-
out the entire community that includes the following:
 
• Wire posts on member profiles and group pages
 
• New friendships between community members
 
• New blog posts and comments
 
• New forum topics and discussions
 
• New groups
 
• New members to a group
 
• Status updates by community members
 
• Profile updates by community members (new avatars, new profile 
data, and so on)
 
 When a community member performs an action within the community, 
it appears in the Site Wide Activity stream. Figure 6-18 displays the Site 
Wide Activity stream on the BuddyPress demo Web site at http://
testbp.org.
 
Figure 6-18: 
The Site 
Wide 
Activity

136
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
 
✓ Members Directory: A full listing of community members sorted from 
the most recently active member to the least recently active member 
where you can view names, profiles, and avatars. Additionally, you can 
use the drop-down menu shown above the Members listing to sort the 
directory by the following sort methods:
 
• Last Active
 
• Newest Registered
 
• Alphabetical
 
 By default, the Members Directory lists the ten most recently active 
members, as shown in Figure 6-19. Other members appear, ten per page, 
on subsequent pages. Also, to the right of each member’s name is an 
Add Friend button, which you can click to send friend requests to mem-
bers from the directory page. (If you’re already a friend of the member 
listed, the Cancel Friendship button appears instead.)
 
✓ Groups Directory: Similar to the Members Directory, a full listing of 
groups within the community sorted by the most recently active groups, 
which appear on the first page before the listing paginates. This pagina-
tion feature keeps the directory pages from becoming too unwieldy. 
To the right of each group listing is a Join Group button, which you 
can click to join that group. (If you’re already a member of a group, 
the Leave Group button appears instead.) Also similar to the Members 
Directory, you can use the drop-down menu to sort the Group listing by 
the following sort methods:
 
• Last Active
 
• Most Members
 
• Newly Created
 
• Alphabetical
 
✓ Forums Directory: A directory listing of all forums created within the 
community, sorted by the most recently active forums. With the drop-
down menu displayed above the forums listing, you can filter forum 
topics by the following sort methods:
 
• Last Active
 
• Most Posts
 
• Unreplied

137
 Chapter 6: Exploring Your New Community
 
Figure 6-19:

✓ Blogs Directory: A directory of all blogs within the community sorted by 
the most recently active blogs, which appear on the first page before the 
listing paginates. As with the Members Directory and Groups Directory, 
you can sort community blogs using the drop-down menu at the top by 
the following sort methods:
 
• Last Active
 
• Newest
 
• Alphabetical
 
 To the right of each blog listing is a Visit Blog button, which takes you to 
that community blog. Additionally, beneath the Visit Blog button is a link 
to the most recently posted article on that blog, as seen in Figure 6-20.
Another easy way to navigate the community is to use the built-in Search fea-
ture that appears on the top right of every page within the community. Figure 
6-21 shows the Search feature on a BuddyPress community site.

The Search ﬁeld

139
 Chapter 6: Exploring Your New Community
To use the Search feature, follow these steps:
 
1. Type a keyword in the Search field.
 
 The keyword you use should correspond with the criteria for your 
search. For example, if you want to search the community for mem-
bers, groups, or blogs related to the subject of coffee, type coffee in the 
Search field.
 
2. Choose the type of search you want to perform.
 
 The drop-down menu to the right of the Search field allows you to 
narrow your search results to the following directories:
 
• Members: Returns search results within the Members Directory.
 
• Groups: Returns search results within the Groups Directory.
 
• Forums: Returns search results within the Forums Directory.
 
• Blogs: Returns search results within the Blogs Directory.
 
3. Click the Search button.
 
 BuddyPress performs a search based on the keyword criteria that you 
specified in the Search field. When the search is complete, a new page 
loads in your browser window with the results that meet your criteria.
Using the Site Activity stream; the Members, Groups, Forums, or Blog direc-
tories; or the Search feature within your BuddyPress community enables you 
and your community members to discover new members, new activity, and 
new information within your community.
You can also discover people and activities within your community by using 
widgets. Chapter 9 fully covers how to use widgets in your community.

Chapter 7
Enabling Blogs
In This Chapter
▶ Enabling user blogs
▶ Configuring WordPress MU for member blogs
▶ Setting up blog options
▶ Displaying directories
▶ Tracking blogs in member profiles
▶ Listing blog comment activity in activity streams
B
logs are a benefit to a social community and allow members to manage 
and maintain articles, publish ideas and photos, and share information — 
all of which becomes part of the content flow within the community’s activity 
streams. Enabling user blogs is just another tool you can provide to your com-
munity to encourage the sharing of information and interactivity between mem-
bers. The advantage to you, the site owner, is that the more your users publish 
to their community blogs, the more content they provide within your commu-
nity, which increases the value of your site has as a whole.
The WordPress MU software is what allows you to enable your community 
users to create blogs within your network. However, in BuddyPress, you 
have the option to track user blogs and blog activity within the member pro-
files and directories. Every community is different; whether you want your 
community members to create and manage blogs is a decision only you can 
make. This chapter gives you the information to help you make that decision, 
along with details on how to make it happen.
Managing User Blogs in Your Community
In Chapter 2, you download, install, and set up the WordPress MU software, 
which is required to run BuddyPress. You also choose whether you want 
blogs created in a subdirectory of your Web site, or a subdomain, as follows:

142
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
 
✓ Subdirectory: Using this configuration, users’ blogs are created in a 
directory on your Web server and the Web addresses of the blogs look 
similar to http://yourdomain.com/username.
 
✓ Subdomain: Using this configuration, a new subdomain is created and 
the Web addresses of the users’ blogs look similar to http://user
name.yourdomain.com. Subdomains require configuring the DNS on 
your Web server, and Chapter 2 gives you the information and steps you 
need to make that happen.
Enabling user blog creation
Chapter 2 gives you a tour of the WordPress dashboard, where you manage 
all the settings for your WordPress MU-powered Web site. On the WordPress 
dashboard, you can enable or disable the creation of blogs within your net-
work. The following steps take you through the procedure:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
 
 The URL for your WordPress dashboard is http://yourdomain.com/wp-
login.php (where yourdomain.com is your actual site domain name.)
 
2. Choose Options on the Site Admin menu.
 
 The Site Options page appears, as shown in Figure 7-1, and you’re presented 
with several configuration options for your WordPress MU installation.
 
Figure 7-1:

3. Select an option under Allow New Registrations:
 
• Disabled: Disallows new user registration completely. People visit-
ing your site will not be able to register for a user account.
 
• Enabled. Blogs and user accounts can be created: Gives users the 
ability during the registration process to create a user account and 
a blog.
 
• Only user accounts can be created: Gives people the ability to create 
only a user account; they will not be able to create a blog within 
your network.
 
• Only logged in users can create new blogs: Allows only users who 
are already logged in to create a new blog within your network. 
This also disables new user registration completely.
 
4. Save your settings.
 
 Click the Update Options button at the bottom of the Site Options page 
to save the options you configure. (The Site Options page reloads in 
your browser with your new settings saved.)
In Figure 7-1, I chose the Enabled. Blogs and User Accounts Can Be Created 
option because I want people who visit my site to be able to create an 
account, and a blog, when they register.
With blog creation enabled, users have the option on the user registration 
page to select whether they would like to create a blog. The user registration 
page for my community (shown in Figure 7-2) displays the Yes, I’d Like to 
Create a New Blog check box. When users check this box during the sign-up 
process, a blog is created for them.
If the user doesn’t check this box, then only a user account that accesses all 
the BuddyPress member profile areas is created. However, users can create a 
blog later from within their BuddyPress member profile settings. These steps 
show you how to create a blog from your member profile:
 
1. Login to the community using your username and password.
 
2. Hover your mouse over the My Blogs item on the Site Admin bar.
 
3. Click Create a Blog! from the drop-down menu.
 
4. Type the address for your new blog in the Blog Domain text box.
 
5. Type the title of your new blog in the Blog Title text box.
 
6. Choose Privacy options for your new blog.
 
 Select Yes if you want the blog to appear in community directory listings 
and to enable it to be discovered by search engines, such as Google. 
Select No if you want your new blog to be private. Private blogs aren’t 
listed in community directories and are not visible to search engines.

7. Click the Create Blog button.
 
 The Create a Blog page reloads with a message congratulating you on 
the creation of your new blog. The page displays a link to your new blog, 
as well as a dashboard link that you click to log in, manage your new 
blog, and publish new blog posts.
 
Remember that your community members can only create blogs within the 
community if you have that option enabled within the WordPress MU Site 
Admin options, found in your WordPress MU Dashboard (see Chapters 2 and 3 
for information on setting site options in WordPress MU).
Managing user blogs
As the site owner, you have full access to all user blogs created within your com-
munity. Choosing Blogs on the Site Admin menu loads the Blogs page, which lists 
all the blogs in your community, with options for managing each blog.
Searching for specific blogs
At the top of the Blogs page is a Search feature you can use to search for 
blogs by name, blog ID, or IP address. This is very helpful if you have a large 

145
 Chapter 7: Enabling Blogs
community and one of your users e-mails you with a problem or question — 
you can visit the Blogs page and pull up the information on his blog pretty fast.
Managing individual blogs
The Blogs page lists the blogs in your community by ID. (User blogs are 
assigned a specific ID at the time of their creation.) The listing of user blogs 
also displays the following information about each blog:
 
✓ ID: Blog ID number
 
✓ Domain: The name associated with this blog
 
✓ Last Updated: The date the blog was last updated (or posted to)
 
✓ Registered: The date the blog was registered within your community
 
✓ Users: The e-mail address associated with the user(s) of the blog
When you hover on any of the blogs listed on the Blogs page, an options 
menu appears that allows you to manage the blogs within your community. 
Figure 7-3 shows the options that appear when I hover my mouse on the ‘test-
blog’ user blog in my community.
 
Figure 7-3: 
Options to 
manage 
individual 
user blogs 
on the Blogs 
page.
 
The available options and the ways they can help you manage your blogging 
community are as follows:
 
✓ Edit: Opens the Edit Blog page, which allows you to view and edit set-
tings for this users blog. You use this more for diagnostic and trouble-
shooting purposes than for altering user settings.
 
✓ Backend: Opens the user’s blog Dashboard, allowing you (the commu-
nity administrator) to view the Dashboard as if you were the ower of this 
blog. It’s excellent for troubleshooting purposes, as it allows you to view 
how the user has set up the different options in their blog Dashboard.
 
✓ Deactivate: Deactivates the user’s blog, but does not delete it. When you 
choose Deactivate, you confirm that you’re certain you want to deac-
tivate this blog. After you confirm you want to deactivate the blog, the 

146
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
Deactivate link changes to Activate, allowing you (the community admin-
istrator) to reactivate the blog at any time. Visiting the user’s blog after 
it’s deactivated displays a message that reads, “This user has elected to 
delete their account and the content is no longer available.”
 
✓ Archive: Suspends the user’s blog and deactivates it. When you choose 
Archive, you confirm that you’re certain you want to archive the blog. 
After you confirm you want to archive the blog, the Archive link changes 
to Unarchive, allowing you (the community administrator) to unarchive 
the blog at any time. Visiting the user’s blog after it’s archived displays a 
message that reads, “This blog has been archived or suspended.”
 
✓ Spam: Marks the blog as spam and archives/suspends it from your com-
munity. When you choose Spam, you confirm that you’re certain you 
want to mark the blog as spam. After you confirm you want to mark the 
blog as spam, the Spam link changes to Not Spam, allowing you (the 
community administrator) to mark the blog as Not Spam at any time.
 
✓ Delete: Deletes the user’s blog from your community. When you choose 
Delete, you confirm (twice!) that you’re certain you want to delete the 
blog. If you confirm that you want to delete the blog, you cannot undo 
this action. This doesn’t delete the user’s account, however; the user 
can create new blogs with his or her existing user account.
 
✓ Visit: Opens the user’s blog in a new browser window.
 
When you delete a blog within the community (or if one of your users delete 
their own blog), it’s permanent; so be absolutely, 100 percent positive that 
you really, really want to delete the blog before you confirm the action. This is 
why the WordPress MU software provides not one, but two, confirmation mes-
sages, forcing you to think twice before you act.
Deleting multiple blogs at one time
Figure 7-4 shows a check box to the left of each blog listing. You can delete 
or mark as spam multiple blogs from your community at one time by select-
ing the check box next to each blog you want to delete and then clicking the 
Delete button at the top of the page. This is very helpful if you have a number 
of spam blogs appear in your community.
Adding a blog to the community
You can manually add blogs to the system from your WordPress dashboard, 
as shown in Figure 7-4. This feature is especially helpful if you want to create 
your own blogs within the community, or if you want to set up a blog for a 
friend and save him the trouble of creating a blog on his own. (We all have 
friends like that, don’t we?)
In the Add Blog section of the Blogs page, take the following steps to create 
a blog:
 
1. Type a username in the Blog Address text box.

147
 Chapter 7: Enabling Blogs
 
2. Type the title of the blog in the Blog Title text box.
 
3. Type the user’s e-mail address in the Admin Email text box.
 
4. Click the Add Blog button.
 
 The Blogs page reloads, and the blog you just set up appears in the list 
of blogs.
 
Figure 7-4: 
WordPress 
MU allows 
you to

blogs 
within the 
Dashboard.
 
BuddyPress includes a default theme (see Figure 7-5) that your users can use 
for their blogs within the community.
 
Figure 7-5: 
The default 
BuddyPress

148
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
 
What displays on the default BuddyPress theme depends on the use of the 
built-in WordPress and BuddyPress widgets. Chapter 9 covers widgets, includ-
ing information about installing new themes and tweaking the default 
BuddyPress themes with basic HTML and CSS to make them unique to your 
social community.
Tracking Community Blog Activity
Part of what makes a social community so informative and fun is that you 
can find out what community members are up to through activity streams 
and tracking. With BuddyPress installed on a WordPress MU site, you can 
track blog activity within your community. This section shows you the ways 
a BuddyPress social community Web site keeps track of blog activity within 
your user community.
The blog activity tracked in activity streams includes
 
✓ Creation of new blogs: Any time a user creates a new blog in your com-
munity, it broadcasts to the entire community.
 
✓ Newly published blog posts: When a user posts to their community 
blog, the entire community knows.
 
✓ Newly published blog comments: When a user comments on a public 
community blog, it’s noted throughout the community.
Before any blog activity can be tracked within your community, however, you 
have to enable blog tracking in the BuddyPress options:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
 
2. Choose Component Setup on the BuddyPress menu.
 
 The BuddyPress Component Setup page appears.
 
3. Enable Blog Tracking.
 
 Select the Enabled option to turn on blog activity tracking across your 
entire network.
 
4. Save your settings.
 
 Click the Save Settings button at the bottom of the BuddyPress 
Component Setup page to save the blog tracking settings.
With blog tracking enabled, your users can easily discover all the new blog 
activity occurring within your community. Figure 7-6 shows an activity 
stream listing new blog posts made within a BuddyPress social community.

149
 Chapter 7: Enabling Blogs
 
Figure 7-6: A 
BuddyPress 
activity 
stream 
shows com-
munity blog 
activity.
 
 
The Site Activity stream shown in Figure 7-6 displays on a page within your 
site by using either the BuddyPress Default theme (the code for this is built 
into the theme itself) or with the BuddyPress Classic theme, using the built-
in BuddyPress widget called Site Wide Activity. With this widget, you can 
control how many activity items display on the page at one time. Chapter 9 
covers BuddyPress widgets and displaying information and content on your 
community Web site.
A user’s blog activity also displays on the member’s Activity page in his or 
her own activity stream. As shown in Figure 7-7, some of my most recent blog 
activity displays on my profile’s Activity stream.
 
Each blog has privacy options, which I cover in the earlier “Enabling user 
blog creation” section. If the privacy options are set to disallow the blog from 
appearing in search engines and public listings, then that blog will not be 
included in blog activity listings throughout the community.
A BuddyPress-powered social community also has the added advantage 
of providing a directory of blogs within the community. In the BuddyPress 
Default theme, click Blogs on the navigation menu displayed to the right of 
the site title for a directory of the community’s blogs, as well as a drop down 
manu navigation feature that allows you to browse community blogs by the 
latest active, newest and alphabetically. Figure 7-8 shows the Blog Directory 
listing in a BuddyPress community using the BuddyPress Default theme.

 Chapter 7: Enabling Blogs
Publishing Blog Posts
In this book’s Introduction, I state that I expect readers to have a certain level 
of experience with blogging on WordPress. However, part of the responsibili-
ties of owning a social community is supporting users and letting them know 
how they can use the different features.
All the chapters of this book give you insight into using WordPress and 
BuddyPress as a site owner/administrator and as a member of your site 
so that you can give your members direction and instruction. This section 
briefly looks into how you and your users will use the WordPress MU blog 
feature to write, categorize, and publish blog posts on the community blogs.
Here are the steps to compose and write a basic blog post from your 
WordPress dashboard:
 
1. Choose Add New on the Posts menu.
 
 The Add New Post page appears, as shown in Figure 7-9, where you 
write and publish a new blog post to your community blog.
 
2. Type the title of your post in the title text box.
 
3. Type the content of your post in the body text box.
 
 Just as you would type an e-mail, you type the content of your post in 
the text box on this page. You can use the formatting menu above the 
text box to format your content with bold or italicized text, hyperlinks, 
and text alignment. Additionally, you can insert photos and images into 
your blog post by using the Add Media icons.
 
4. Publish your post.
 
 Click the Publish button to publish the post to your blog.
You and your users can manage posts published to your blog by choosing 
Edit on the Posts menu. The Edit Posts page appears, and lists all the posts.
For specific details on managing a WordPress-powered blog, refer to my 
book, WordPress For Dummies.

Using the Groups Feature
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing the BuddyPress Groups feature
▶ Enabling groups and forums
▶ Creating new groups
▶ Joining an existing group
▶ Participating in a group
▶ Exploring group administration, member management, and activity
I
magine you are the host of a large house party and you’ve invited 100 of 
your closest friends to attend. When the party gets started, there’s a lot of 
noise while everyone tries talking to one another — talking over the music, 
and talking over other people. In a short time, you notice that the people at 
your party start to break out into smaller groups having conversations in 
different rooms. A group in the kitchen is discussing their favorite food and 
wine, while another group in the TV room is engaged in a heated conversa-
tion over their favorite contestant on the latest reality TV show.
The concept is the same for the BuddyPress Groups feature. As the site 
owner, you invite the public to gather in your space on the Web to take part 
in the sharing of content and the overall conversation. Inevitably, your com-
munity members will break out into smaller groups to discuss shared topics 
of interest. Sometimes, in large gatherings, smaller groups of conversation 
make it easier to participate and engage other members.
This chapter introduces you to the BuddyPress Groups feature. I show you 
how to enable groups and forums in your social community; how to create, 
join, and participate in new groups within the community; and how to admin-
ister and manage your own groups.

154
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
Enabling Groups and Forum Options
In a BuddyPress community site, you can think of groups as micro-communities 
that exist within the larger community. Groups are where members of your 
community can come together to discuss and share ideas. Group members 
can use the forums feature to start discussions on different topics and to 
invite other group members to participate in those discussions. Enabling 
forums allows your members to create discussion forums within the groups 
they create in your community.
Just because the Groups feature exists doesn’t mean you need to use it. Plenty 
of great Web sites thrive without allowing members to create groups and 
forums within the network. However, if you who want to give your community 
members this ability, you can create an unlimited number of group and forum 
discussions on an unlimited amount of topics to keep the conversations within 
your community lively and active. All you have to do is follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress MU dashboard.
 
2. Choose BuddyPress➪Component Setup.
 
 This loads the BuddyPress Component Setup page where you can 
enable or disable the available BuddyPress components.
 
3. Select Enabled under bbPress Forums.
 
 This gives your community members the ability to create discussion 
forums within the groups they create in your network.
 
4. Select Enabled under Groups.
 
 This gives your community members the ability to create, join, and par-
ticipate in groups within your community.
 
5. Click the Save Settings button at the bottom of the page to save the 
Component Setup settings you’ve selected.
bbPress is a discussion forum platform created by the folks behind the 
popular WordPress platform, so it makes perfect sense for the developers 
of BuddyPress to choose bbPress to provide the framework for the group’s 
forums. 
 
In Chapter 5, I cover setting up and installing the bbPress Forums feature to 
allow you to enable forums on your community site. If the forums have not yet 
been set up on your site, review Chapter 5.
 
bbPress is a discussion forum platform that many people use as a stand-alone 
solution for hosting a discussion forum on their Web site. However, bbPress is 
part of the BuddyPress suite of plugins and installs along with BuddyPress 
when you do the initial installation (see Chapter 4). bbPress exists within the 

155
 Chapter 8: Using the Groups Feature
BuddyPress directory of files in the /wp-content/plugins/buddypress/
bp-forums/bbpress/ folder on your Web server and integrates completely 
with your WordPress MU and BuddyPress installation.
Participating in community groups
Like everything else within a BuddyPress community site, group activity is 
tracked and displayed within the community’s activity stream. The type of 
information tracked includes
 
✓ Creation of new groups: When a member creates a new group, it 
appears on community activity wires and in the Group Directory listing. 
The creation of the group is broadcast on that member’s profile, as well.
 
✓ Posts made to a group’s wire: When a member comments on the 
group’s wire, it appears in the Site Wide Activity listing and on that 
member’s profile.
 
✓ Creation of new forum topics: When a group member starts a new 
forum topic, it appears in the Site Wide Activity listing and on that mem-
ber’s profile.
 
✓ Posts made to a forum discussion: When a group member participates 
in a forum by posting a comment, the comment appears in the Site Wide 
Activity listing and on that member’s profile.
 
The type of tracked information depends in part on the options you choose 
when you create the group. When a new group is created, the group admin-
istrator (or owner) can set the group’s privacy options to Public, Private, or 
Hidden. (See Chapter 6.) If a group is set to Hidden, then the group activity 
items will not publish in the community activity wires and directories.
Groups Directory
Figure 8-1 shows the community’s Groups Directory in the BuddyPress 
Default theme. The Groups Directory can be viewed by clicking Groups on 
the upper-right navigation menu of the Web site.
By default, the Groups Directory lists all groups by most active to least active 
and displays a maximum of tengroups per page. Additionally, the Groups 
Directory gives you a drop-down menu that allows you to sort the Groups 
listing by the following methods:
 
✓ Last Active: Choosing this option displays the Groups listing by the 
most recent to the least active groups within the community.
 
✓ Most Members: Choosing this option displays the Groups listing by the 
groups with the most members to the groups with the least members.

156
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
 
✓ Newly Created: Choosing this option displays the Groups listing by the 
newest groups to the oldest groups created within the community.
 
✓ Alphabetical: Choosing this option displays the Groups listing in an 
alphabetical manner.
 
Figure 8-1: 
The Groups 
Directory in 
a Buddy
Press social 
community 
site.
 
Groups listed in the directory display the following information:
 
✓ Avatar: When members create new groups, they can choose an avatar, 
or photo, to represent the group.
 
✓ Name: This name is given to the group by the group administrator.
 
✓ Time last active: This shows the time of the group’s last activity, such 
as a new member, new wire comment, or forum post. This will display 
something similar to “Active 1 hour, 30 minutes ago.”
 
✓ Description: Two or three lines of text that describe what the group is 
about.
 
✓ Number of members: Total number of group members.
 
✓ Join/Leave option: This button gives you the ability to join a group or 
leave a group you’re already a member of.

157
 Chapter 8: Using the Groups Feature
Groups widget
You can use the widgets that come packaged within BuddyPress to display 
specific content on your community site; check out Chapter 9 to find out 
how. One of the widgets is the Groups widget, which displays a listing of com-
munity Groups on the site to help other members easily discover existing 
groups they can browse and join. The Groups widget allows users to sort the 
list of groups by the following criteria:
 
✓ Newest: The latest groups created within the community.
 
✓ Active: The most active groups in the community, determined by the 
amount of discussion occurring within the group.
 
✓ Popular: The most popular groups in the community, determined by the 
number of group members.
The links to sort the groups are located in the upper-right corner of the 
widget, as shown in Figure 8-2.
 
Figure 8-2: 
The Groups 
widget dis-
plays a list 
of groups, 
sortable by

Site Activity
The Site Activity listing is part of the front page of a BuddyPress site (if 
you’re using the BuddyPress Default theme), or powered by the Site Wide 
Activity widget (if you are using the BuddyPress Classic theme). (You can 
find out more about widgets in Chapter 9.) This widget gives you a list of all 
community activity in your network, including group activity items. However, 
if you’re using the BuddyPress Default theme, you don’t really need to 

158
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
use the widget — Figure 8-3 shows the Site Activity listing from the official 
BuddyPress demo site, filtered by new Group forum replies within the com-
munity. (Information about filtering the Site Activity listing can be found in 
Chapter 6.)
 
Figure 8-3:

Viewing group activity in the Site Activity listing allows community mem-
bers to discover new and active groups within the community. From the Site 
Activity listing, members can click the name of the group to view the group’s 
front page, find out more about the group and, if they desire, join the group.
Finding out about a community group
Every group within a BuddyPress community has its own page. Figure 8-4 
shows a group in the BuddyPress demo site community.
The front page of a group displays the following information:

159
 Chapter 8: Using the Groups Feature
 
Figure 8-4: 
A group’s 
front 
page in a 
BuddyPress 
social 
community.
 
 
✓ Avatar: The group administrator — the person who created the group — 
can choose a photo, called an avatar, to represent the group. The group 
page displays the large version of the group avatar. (See Chapter 6 for 
information on how to create a group avatar.)
 
✓ Join/Leave option: This button gives users the options to join or leave a 
group.
 
✓ Administrator: The photo and name of the person who created the 
group. The administrator’s name links to his/her profile. Additionally, 
if the administrator has assigned any other administrators or modera-
tors of the group, they will appear in this section, as well. (See Chapter 
6 for information on assigning other administrators and moderators to a 
group you own.)
 
✓ Title: The title of the group, determined by the group’s administrator.
 
✓ Publicity: Indicates whether the group is public or private. Chapter 6 
covers information on group privacy options.
 
✓ Description: A short, two-to-three line description of what the group is 
about.

160
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
 
✓ News: Administrators and moderators can post news items that appear 
in the News section.
 
✓ Recent activity stream: All group activity is listed in the group’s activ-
ity stream. This includes new members, new wire comments, and new 
forum topics. By default, recent activity items appear ten per page.
 
✓ Recent forum topics: A list of all forum topics. By default, forum topics 
appear five per page, in chronological order.
 
✓ Members: The avatars and names of the group members. By default, 
members appear five per page, but a See All link is available in the upper 
right of this section.
 
✓ Forums: If the administrator of the group has enabled a discussion 
forum for this group, a Forums link is shown in the navigation menu 
options above the group activity listing.
Joining community groups
After you discover a group that you want to join, visit the group’s front page. 
Every group’s front page has a Join/Leave button directly below the group’s 
avatar. The following buttons display, depending on the group’s publicity 
status:
 
✓ Join Group: Click this button to join a group. When you do so, you 
become a member of the group and the text on the button changes to 
“Leave Group.”
 
✓ Request Membership: This button appears on private groups. When 
you click this button, the administrator of the group receives noti-
fication that you want to join and the text on the button changes to 
“Membership Requested.” You have to wait for the administrator to 
approve your membership before you can participate.
 
✓ Leave Group: This button appears on groups that you are a member of. 
When you click this button, you cancel your membership to that group 
and the text on the button changes to “Join Group.” You can click the 
Join Group button if you want to re-join the group later.
Joining the Discussion
The Forums feature is popular in BuddyPress communities because it allows 
members to host their very own discussion forums. Discussion forums give 
members the ability to create new topics for discussion and invite other mem-
bers to comment on and provide feedback on that particular topic. Members 

161
 Chapter 8: Using the Groups Feature
can create an unlimited amount of topics to encourage discussion and conver-
sation between all the members within the group. In BuddyPress, discussion 
forums are referred to as Group Forums. On any group’s front page that has 
the Forum feature enabled, choose Groups➪Forum on the navigation menus 
to the left. The group’s Forum page appears, as shown in Figure 8-5, where you 
find a listing of the most recent topics started by members.
 
Figure 8-5: 
A group’s 
Forum page 
lists the 15 
most recent 
topics.
 
By default, the group’s Forum page lists the 15 most recent topics; additional 
topics appear 15 per page.
Posting new topics in a forum is easy. Here’s how:
 
1. Click the Forums link in the Group navigation menu.
 
 Scroll down to the bottom of the page and you find the Post a New Topic 
form, as shown in Figure 8-6.
 
2. Type the title of your topic in the Title text box.
 
 You can give your new topic any title you want.
 
3. Type the topic message (or body) in the Content text box.
 
4. Tag your topic by typing keywords in the Tags text box.

162
Part III: Understanding BuddyPress Features 
 
Figure 8-6: 
This form 
allows you 
to post a 
new topic in 
a forum.
 
 
 Members can browse forum topics by tags — one to two keyword 
descriptions of what the topic is about. Tags organize topics. For 
example, if your topic is about pet goldfish, the tags for your topic could 
be goldfish, fish, and pet fish. Always separate each tag by a comma so 
BuddyPress knows where one tag ends and another one begins.
 
5. Click the Post Topic button.
 
 Your new topic displays in a new window with a text box underneath it 
where other members can come along and add to the discussion of your 
new topic.
Topics and discussions
When talking about group forums, you hear 
phrases like forum topics and discussion 
threads, but what is the difference between 
the two? A forum topic is a proposed subject 
of discussion. Similar to being in a group at a 
party, you can start a conversation by bringing 
up a topic for people to talk about. A discussion 
thread is the conversation that results from the 
topic. Every forum topic in BuddyPress has a 
text box that members can use to submit their 
thoughts on the topic; therefore, adding to the 
conversations going on in the forum.

163
 Chapter 8: Using the Groups Feature
Exploring the Groups Menu
The navigation menu on the left side contains links for browsing your com-
munity’s features, including the Groups feature. Within a group, the Groups 
menu has six options, as shown in Figure 8-4:
 
✓ Home: Displays the group’s home page.
 
✓ Forum: Displays the Forum page where you can read and participate in 
forum topics and discussions.
 
✓ Members: Displays all the current group members; this page displays the 
member’s avatar and name, linked to their individual profile. It also indi-
cates how long the person has been a member of this particular group.
 
✓ Send Invites: Displays in the Groups menu only if you are a member of 
the group. This link loads the Send Invites page that lists community

Customizing 
BuddyPress

In this part . . .
T
his part is all about individualizing and customizing 
your BuddyPress themes and templates to create a 
completely unique look that’s all your own. I tell you 
where to find existing free BuddyPress themes, how to 
tweak existing themes using basic HTML and CSS, and 
how to use BuddyPress template tags and functions to 
help you put together a nicely designed theme to suit 
your needs and style.

B
uddyPress comes with two nicely designed themes that you can use 
on your site after you install and set up the BuddyPress plugin. The 
BuddyPress Default and Classic themes are included so you can get your site 
up and running right away.
You can customize the BuddyPress themes to create a visual design 
unique to your own community, which I cover in Chapter 11. You can also 
find, download, and install different themes created by designers in the 
BuddyPress community, which I describe in Chapter 10. Additionally, in 
Chapter 16, I list ten great free themes I’ve come across in my travels that 
you can use in your BuddyPress community.
This chapter gives you an overview of the BuddyPress themes, includ-
ing how to install and activate it, and how and when to use the included 
BuddyPress widgets to display different content and information on your 
community Web site.
Installing the Themes
In Chapter 4, I show you how to install the BuddyPress suite of plugins into 
your existing WordPress MU installation. To perform this installation, you 
need to move the Default theme folders into the /wp-content/themes/ 
folder on your Web server. (If you need to review how to move these files, 
check out Chapter 4.)

168
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
 
Keep an eye out for a new release of the WordPress MU software in the early 
months of 2010. The planned upgrade for WordPress MU will eliminate the 
need for you to move the BuddyPress theme files to the /wp-content/
themes/ folder; this action will be done for you when you install and activate 
the BuddyPress suite of plugins.
The first theme included in the BuddyPress plugin is the BuddyPress 
Classic, as shown in Figure 9-1. This theme has a three-column layout and an 
orange-and-gray color scheme. The BuddyPress Classic theme requires the 
BuddyPress Parent theme in order to work.
The second theme is the BuddyPress Default theme, the newest theme to 
be created by the BuddyPress developers. You can see how the BuddyPress 
default theme looks in Figure 9-2; it has a two-column layout with a blue-and-
white color scheme.
The third theme bundled in the BuddyPress suite of plugins is the 
BuddyPress Social Network Parent Theme. This theme should never be 
activated and used directly on your site. Rather, this theme is a parent 
theme, or a theme framework, that other themes are built from, including 
the BuddyPress Classic theme. I cover the parent/child theme relationship in 
more depth in Chapter 12.

 Chapter 9: Default Theme and Widgets
 
Figure 9-2:

I mentioned early on in this book that BuddyPress has undergone some pretty 
massive new development since it burst onto the blogging scene in 2008. The 
BuddyPress Classic theme, built on the BuddyPress Parent theme, was the first 
theme that users were able to use. For this reason, the BuddyPress develop-
ers left the Classic and Parent themes in place so that sites already running 
BuddyPress wouldn’t fail when the new Default theme was added. I recom-
mend you use the Default theme to build your community site — the Classic 
theme, while functional, is a bit more challenging to work with.
In this book I work exclusively with the BuddyPress Default theme, but the con-
cepts and ideas introduced can be applied toward the Classic theme, if you care 
to go that direction. In this chapter, I mention some features that are used only 
with the Classic theme, but for the most part I stick with the Default theme.
Using BuddyPress Widgets
Widgets are helpful and handy tools found in all WordPress installations. 
BuddyPress adds some additional widgets to help you display the content 
you want to show on your community Web site. Widgets allow you to easily 
arrange the display of content, such as activity wires, member listings, and 
blog posts, on your Web site using drag-and-drop technology.

170
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
Have a look again at Figure 9-2. It shows the BuddyPress Default theme with 
the Site Activity listings on the left side; however, on the right side, you see 
my avatar, name, and a log out button at the top (if you were the one logged 
into the site, of course, you would be seeing your own avatar and name). The 
rest of the right sidebar is empty — that is because we haven’t yet added 
widgets to the sidebar. I show you how to do that next.
To add widgets in the BuddyPress Default theme, log in to your WordPress 
MU dashboard and choose Appearance➪Widgets. This loads the Widgets 
page, shown in Figure 9-3, where the WordPress and BuddyPress widgets dis-
play beneath the Available Widgets heading, and the available sidebar appear 
on the right. In the BuddyPress Default theme, you can add widgets to
 
Figure 9-3: 
The Widgets 
page is 
where you

to your 
BuddyPress 
Default 
theme.
 
In a default WordPress MU installation with BuddyPress added, you have 
access to several widgets. However, the Widgets page on your WordPress 
dashboard doesn’t indicate whether the widgets are WordPress widgets or 
BuddyPress widgets, so I’ve compiled a listing of widgets for you in Table 9-1, 
listed in order of appearance.

Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
From Table 9-1, you can easily see that WordPress widgets deal mainly with 
your blog-related content, and BuddyPress widgets deal primarily with your 
community-related content.
One other BuddyPress widget is available — the Site Wide Activity widget — 
which is used only with the BuddyPress Classic theme. If you are using 
the Default theme, the Site Wide Activity widgets won’t appeart on the 
WordPress Widgets page because it is used only with the Classic theme. I 
cover this widget in the next section.
Displaying site wide activity 
on the Classic theme
Within most community sites on the Web, there is a hub of activity where 
you can peek in and discover what’s going on and who’s doing what. On a 
BuddyPress-powered site, this hub of activity displays through a widget 
called Site Wide Activity.
After it’s activated on the site, the Site Wide Activity widget displays a real-
time listing of site activity, including:
 
✓ New friendships
 
✓ Recent posts on community blogs
 
✓ Latest forum topics and discussions
 
✓ Recent comments made to member and group wires
 
✓ Formation of new groups, forums, and blogs
 
✓ Latest member status updates
To add the Site Wide Activity widget to your site, using the Classic 
BuddyPress theme, follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress MU dashboard.
 
2. Choose Appearance➪Widgets.
 
 The Widgets page displays the available widgets on the left and the 
available sidebars on the right.
 
3. Expand the First-Section sidebar.
 
 Clicking the drop-down arrow on the First-Section sidebar expands the 
sidebar and readies it to receive a new widget. This sidebar controls 
the content that displays in the left column of the BuddyPress Classic 
theme. (I like to place the Site Wide Activity Widget here because this 
section has the largest display on the BuddyPress Classic theme.)

173
 Chapter 9: Default Theme and Widgets
 
4. Locate the Site Wide Activity widget.
 
 The Widgets page lists available widgets in alphabetical order; scroll 
down until you see the Site Wide Activity widget.
 
5. Drag and drop the Site Wide Activity widget to the First-Section sidebar.
 
 When you drag a new widget onto the First-Section sidebar, a dotted 
outline appears, indicating that you can now release the button on your 
mouse to drop the Site Wide Activity widget into place, as shown in 
Figure 9-4.
 
Figure 9-4: 
Drag 
and drop

on your

dashboard.
 
 
6. Edit the Site Wide Activity widget’s options.
 
 After you drop the widget onto the sidebar, the widget expands to reveal 
available options, as shown in Figure 9-5. The Site Wide Activity widget 
has two options that you can configure:
 
• Number of Items per Page: This option tells BuddyPress how many 
activity items you want to show on each page. The default setting 
is 25, but you can change the number by typing a new one in the 
text box provided.
 
• Max Items to Show: This option tells BuddyPress how many items 
you want to display overall. By default, BuddyPress cuts off the 
listing at 200, but you can change the number by typing a new one 
in the text box provided.
 
 By default, BuddyPress lists 25 activity items per page. The higher the 
number in the Max Items to Show option, the more page numbers that 
display.
 
7. Save your widget settings.
 
 Click the Save button within the Site Wide Activity widget to save the 
settings you just configured.

8. Load your site to view the Site Wide Activity listing.
 
 When you load the main page of your site (http://yourdomain.
com), you now see a listing of activity that has occurred within your 
community — the more activity, the larger the list. Figure 9-6 shows 
the Site Wide Activity listing on the home page of my BuddyPress 
community site.

175
 Chapter 9: Default Theme and Widgets
 
The Site Wide Activity widget is available only if you have the BuddyPress 
Classic theme activated on your WordPress MU site; this widget will not 
appear as an available widget when you have the BuddyPress Default theme 
activated. The Site Wide Activity listing displays an array of activity within 
your community. Chapter 6 details what information accumulates in this list-
ing and includes how you and your members can use it to navigate your com-
munity site.
Using the Members widget
One of the widgets I really like within BuddyPress is the Members widget, 
which allows you to display a listing of members within your community and 
sort the listing by the newest, recently active, and most popular members. 
The programming is in place — all you have to do is add the widget to the 
sidebar on your site by following these easy steps:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress MU dashboard.
 
2. Choose Appearance➪Widgets.
 
 The Widgets page appears and displays the available widgets on the left 
and the available sidebars on the right.
 
3. Expand the sidebar on the right.
 
 Clicking the drop-down arrow on the sidebar expands the sidebar and 
readies it to receive a new widget (refer to Figure 9-3). 
 
4. Locate the Members widget.
 
 The Widgets page lists available widgets in alphabetical order; scroll 
down until you see the Members widget.
 
5. Drag and drop the Members widget to the sidebar.
 
 Click the Members widget and while holding down your mouse button, 
drag it onto the sidebar.
 
6. Edit the Members widget’s options.
 
 After you drop the widget onto the sidebar, the widget expands to reveal 
available options, as shown in Figure 9-7. The Members widget has one 
option that you can configure: Max Members to Show. This option tells 
BuddyPress how many members to display in the listing. By default, 
BuddyPress displays five, but you can change the number by typing a 
new one in the text box provided.

176
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
 
7. Save your widget settings.
 
 Click the Save button within the Members widget to save the settings 
you just configured.
 
8. Load your site to view the Members listing.
 
 When you load the main page of your site (http://yourdomain.com), 
you now see a listing of your community members in the right sidebar, 
as shown in Figure 9-8. You can sort the listing by using the links you see 
in the top-right corner of the Members listing:
 
• Newest: The default display shows the newest members to register 
an account within your community.
 
• Active: Displays the most recently active members within your 
community.
 
• Popular: Displays the most popular members within your commu-
nity, determined by the number of friends they’ve accumulated.

 Chapter 9: Default Theme and Widgets
The Members widget makes locating new members easy for you and your 
community because the Members widget shows the member’s photo and 
name — both of which link directly to the member’s profile.

Displaying community groups
The Groups widget enables you to display a listing of groups within your 
community, which allows your members to discover new groups while they 
browse your Web site. The Groups widget displays the following information 
in the selected column of the BuddyPress Default theme:
 
✓ The group’s avatar: A photo that the group administrator has chosen 
to represent the group that can be clicked by any site visitor to view the 
group’s main page.
 
✓ The group’s title: The title given to the group by the administrator that 
can be clicked by anyone to view the main page of the group.

178
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
 
✓ The number of members: The number of people who have joined the 
group.
You can display the Groups listing in any column on the BuddyPress Default 
theme using the Groups widget; here’s how:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress MU dashboard.
 
2. Choose Appearance➪Widgets.
 
 The Widgets page appears and displays the available widgets on the left 
and the available sidebar on the right.
 
3. Expand the sidebar.
 
 Clicking the drop-down arrow on the sidebar expands the sidebar and 
readies it to receive a new widget (refer to Figure 9-4). This sidebar con-
trols the content that displays in the right column of the BuddyPress 
Default theme.
 
4. Locate the Groups widget.
 
 The Widgets page lists available widgets in alphabetical order; scroll 
down until you see the Groups widget.
 
5. Drag and drop the Groups widget to the sidebar.
 
 Click the Groups widget and while holding down your mouse button, 
drag it onto the sidebar.
 
6. Edit the Groups widget’s options.
 
 After you drop the widget onto the sidebar, the widget expands to 
reveal available options, as shown in Figure 9-9. The Groups widget has 
one option that you can configure: Max Groups to Show. This option 
tells BuddyPress how many groups to display in this listing. By default, 
BuddyPress displays five, but you can change the number by typing a 
new one in the text box provided.
 
7. Save your widget settings.
 
 Click the Save button within the Groups widget to save the settings you 
just configured.
 
8. Load your site to view the Groups listing.
 
 When you load the main page of your site (http://yourdomain.
com), you now see a listing of groups in the right column. You can sort 
the listing by using the links you see in the top-right corner of the Groups 
listing:

179
 Chapter 9: Default Theme and Widgets
 
• Newest: The default display shows the newest groups created 
within your community.
 
• Active: Displays the most recently active groups within your 
community.
 
• Popular: Displays the most popular groups within your community, 
determined by the number of members they’ve accumulated.

Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
You can accomplish this very easily by using the Buddypress Welcome 
widget. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress MU dashboard.
 
2. Choose Appearance➪Widgets.
 
 The Widgets page appears and displays the available widgets on the left 
and the available sidebars on the right.
 
3. Expand the sidebar on the right.
 
 Clicking the drop-down arrow on the sidebar expands the sidebar and 
readies it to receive a new widget (refer to Figure 9-4). 
 
4. Locate the Welcome widget.
 
 The Widgets page lists available widgets in alphabetical order; scroll 
down until you see the Welcome widget.
 
5. Drag and drop the Welcome widget to the sidebar.
 
 Click the Welcome widget and while holding down your mouse button, 
drag it onto the sidebar.
 
6. Edit the Welcome widget’s options.
 
 After you drop the widget onto the sidebar, the widget expands to reveal 
available options, as shown in Figure 9-10.
 
 The Welcome widget has two fields for you to fill with information:
 
• Title: Give your welcome message a title like Welcome to Our 
Community! — type your desired title into the Title text box.
 
• Content: Come up with a short, effective paragraph of text that wel-
comes your visitors to your site and tells them what your site is 
about. Using a little HTML code, you can even provide a link inviting 
them to read more information on your site’s Bio (or “About Us”) 
page (as luck would have it, I cover basic HTML code in Chapter 10).
 
7. Save your widget settings.
 
 Click the Save button within the Welcome widget to save the settings 
you just configured.
 
8. Load your site to view the Welcome message.
 
 Figure 9-11 shows the welcome message displayed at the top of the right 
sidebar on my BuddyPress community site.

Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
By now, you should understand the concept of widgets and adding them to 
your BuddyPress Default theme. The remaining BuddyPress widgets, and 
their options, include:
 
✓ Recently Active Member Avatars: Add this widget to display just the 
avatars (or photos) of the most recently active members within your 
community. By default, the number of avatars that displays is 15, but 
you can change the number by typing a new one in the text box pro-
vided in the widget’s options.
 
✓ Who’s Online Avatars: Add this widget to display avatars belonging to 
community members who are logged into your site; that is, their status 
is online. By default, the number of avatars that displays is 15, but you 
can change the number by typing a new one in the text box provided in 
the widget’s options.
Blog versus Community Widgets
In Table 9-1, I list the widgets that are available within a default WordPress 
MU installation with BuddyPress added and indicate which widgets are 
default WordPress widgets, and which come with the BuddyPress suite of 
plugins. The difference between the two is the WordPress widgets are blog 
content–related, and the BuddyPress widgets are community-related. The 
WordPress widgets display information related to the content within your 
main site or blog, such as recent blog posts, categories, and lists you’ve cre-
ated on your WordPress dashboard.
You can use the WordPress widgets to display content on your BuddyPress 
community — and you can mix and match WordPress and BuddyPress wid-
gets to create content and navigation features that are unique to your site. 
Figure 9-12 displays my main blog page and the widgets I added by dragging 
and dropping them to the Sidebar section of the Widgets page:
 
✓ Recent Posts: A listing of the five most recent posts published to my 
blog.
 
✓ Categories: A listing of categories I’ve created on my blog.
 
✓ Archives: A listing of my monthly blog archives.
If you enable user blogs within your community, then these widgets are avail-
able for your users to drag and drop onto their own sidebars, too. On their 
blog, the information that displays relates to the content on their individual 
community blog.

183
 Chapter 9: Default Theme and Widgets
Currently, widgets cannot be added to member profiles, but give those bright 
developers at BuddyPress.Org a little time. Down the road, I’m sure the 
wonder of widgets will be available to help you control the content that dis-
plays on your profile, too.
 
Other widgets can be added to a BuddyPress community by using plugins cre-
ated just for BuddyPress community sites. For information on where to find, 
download, and install plugins for BuddyPress, see Chapter 13.

Finding and Installing Themes
In This Chapter
▶ Finding Free BuddyPress Themes
▶ Previewing a new theme
▶ Downloading and installing themes
▶ Activating and using a new theme on your community site
I
n previous chapters, I cover how to install and set up various BuddyPress 
features and components. You’ve discovered how to set up features like 
groups, forums, blogs, and extended member profiles. Chapter 4 shows you 
how to use the BuddyPress Default theme — a theme all ready for you to use 
right after you install and set up BuddyPress on your Web site. The default 
theme is great, but what if you’re looking for something a little different?
This chapter steps you through finding free themes created for BuddyPress 
by members of the BuddyPress development community. You also find out 
how to download and install the theme on your site, and, finally, how to acti-
vate the theme for use.
Finding Free BuddyPress Themes
Unlike the parent WordPress community, the BuddyPress community does 
not yet have a solid theme development community, so finding quality free 
themes for BuddyPress at this time can be somewhat challenging. Still, it’s 
not impossible, if you know where to look. The BuddyPress Default theme is 
meant to get you started, but you’re certainly not limited to using only the 
default theme. You can download other themes and try them out on your 
site, which I talk about in this chapter. In Chapters 11 and 12, I discuss how 
you can customize your own BuddyPress theme, if you’re the kind of person 
who likes to dip a bit into the techy side of things.

186
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
Free themes, such as the ones I spotlight in Chapter 16, are appealing to a 
wide audience of BuddyPress users because they offer an easy way to change 
the visual look and layout of your social community. They are also fantastic 
tools to use to teach yourself how to create and customize your own themes.
By using themes that are available for download from the BuddyPress Web 
site, you can get your social community site up and running at no additional 
cost because the themes you find there are free. You can find the directory 
of themes at http://buddypress.org/extend/themes (see Figure 10-1) 
to browse the offerings, view small screenshots of the themes, and download 
the theme files to your computer.
The themes that you find at the official BuddyPress site are compatible with 
the latest version of the BuddyPress software and free of any ugly code or 
obvious problems. In short, the themes are safe for your use because the 
BuddyPress development team has vetted them. Safe themes tend to be bug-
free and contain the basic BuddyPress functions that are considered funda-
mental requirements to ensure that your theme, and ultimately your site, is 
able to take full advantage of all BuddyPress components and features.

 Chapter 10: Finding and Installing Themes
Table 10-1 gives you a few other places on the Web where you can find free

reference to you, with no guarantees.

Downloading and Installing Themes
Each theme on the BuddyPress Themes page provides you with a link to 
download the theme. The following steps take you through the process of 
downloading, unpacking, and installing a free BuddyPress theme on your 
Web site:
 
1. Click the Download link.
 
 The download link appears on the image of the theme screenshot.
 
2. Save the theme files to your computer.
 
 After you click the download link, a dialog box opens, giving you the 
option to save a Zip file to your computer. Choose a location on your 
computer and save the file.
 
3. Unpack the plugin Zip file.
 
 All theme files are zipped, meaning they download to your computer in 
an archived format, either Zip or Tar.gz. Using your preferred decom-
pression program (like WinZip, for example), unpack the files on your 
computer.

188
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
 
4. Open your preferred FTP (File Transfer Protocol) program.
 
5. Connect to your Web server via FTP.
 
 Check out Chapter 2 for detailed information on using FTP to connect to 
your Web server.
 
6. Transfer (upload) the theme folder to your Web server.
 
 Upload the unarchived theme folder from your computer into the 
/wp-content/themes/ folder within the WordPress MU installation 
directory on your Web server.
 
 The right side of Figure 10-2 shows that I uploaded the theme folder 
bp-music to the /wp-content/themes directory of my Web server.
After you download and unpack the theme on your computer, you should 
examine the theme’s contents to make sure everything’s okay. Most of the 
free themes that you download for use with BuddyPress will be a “child 
theme.” (I go into more detail on the BuddyPress theme framework in 
Chapter 11, including the parent/child relationship, which you don’t need to 
worry about in this chapter.) The directory structure of a child theme, at a 
minimum, contains the following:

files that drive the layout and formatting of the theme. (More infor-
mation about CSS can be found in Chapter 12.)
 
• images: This folder contains all the image files that are used in the 
theme design.
The theme you download might contain additional files or folders not listed 
here, but check and make sure that it contains at least the files and fold-
ers that I’ve listed. If it does not, chances are the theme will not work with 
BuddyPress, and you may have to move on and find a different theme to use.
Activating a New Theme
You’ve browsed through a bunch of BuddyPress themes and have chosen the 
one you’d like to use. You have taken the big leap of downloading it, unpack-
ing it, and uploading it to your Web server. You’re on your way, but you still 
have two steps left to go before you can display your new theme on your 
Web site: enabling the theme and then activating it on your site.
Enabling a theme in WordPress MU
Because you are required to have the WordPress MU software running on 
your site to use the BuddyPress plugins, you always have to keep WordPress 
MU considerations in mind with every decision you make on running your 
community. These include any plugins you decide to use and any themes you 
install on your site.
In WordPress MU, to use a theme, it has to be enabled in the Site Admin 
menu first, which you can accomplish in these few steps:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress MU dashboard.
 
2. Choose Site Admin➪Themes.
 
 You find the Site Admin menu in the navigation on the left side of your 
WordPress MU dashboard.

190
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
 
3. Find your new theme on the Site Themes page.
 
 This page loads after you click the Themes link in Step 2.
 
4. Make the theme active.
 
 Select Yes to the left of the theme name to make the theme active on 
your site.
 
5. Update your options.
 
 Click the Update Options button to save your settings; the Site Themes 
page reloads and displays “Site themes saved.”
Activating a new theme
After enabling the theme on your WordPress MU dashboard, the last step is 
activating the theme on your site. This step makes your new theme display 
on your site. To activate your new theme, follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
 
2. Choose Appearance➪Themes.
 
 The Manage Themes page appears and displays small thumbnails of 
theme screenshots, as shown in Figure 10-3.
 
3. Activate the theme.
 
 In Figure 10-3, you see three links beneath the theme screenshot and 
name:
 
• Activate: Click this to activate the theme on your Web site.
 
• Preview: Click this to preview the theme.
 
• Delete: Click this to delete the theme files from your Web server.
 
 Click the Activate link to activate the theme on your site.
 
4. Visit the main page of your Web site to verify that the theme you 
selected is indeed displaying on your site.
 
Many WordPress users enjoy the dashboard feature that allows them to 
browse the official WordPress Theme Directory to find, install, and activate 
themes. BuddyPress fans can use the same feature by clicking Add New 
Themes under the Appearance menu. Simply type the word BuddyPress in the 
search box to find themes compatible with BuddyPress; then click the Install 
link to install the theme on your site.

Themes are always a hot topic of conversation in any discussion about the 
BuddyPress suite of plugins because most users are interested in more than 
just having the great BuddyPress features available on their Web site. Users 
also want to display a design that is aesthetically pleasing to the eye and, 
often, unique to their particular community. Using free themes is a nice way 
to get a different look and feel on your site than the standard BuddyPress 
Default theme.
If you’re interested in individualizing your theme, check out the information 
on using CSS to style your BuddyPress community in Chapter 12. However, 
before you begin digging into the CSS for your theme, it’s important to 
understand the BuddyPress theme architecture — including the parent/child 
framework that BuddyPress uses as its base — which I discuss in Chapter 11.
Finally, Chapter 16 of this book gives you a peek at ten nice BuddyPress 
themes that are available for you to download and try on your site for the 
price of absolutely nothing!

Understanding Themes 
and Templates
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding parent/child theme relationships
▶ Exploring the BuddyPress Default theme
▶ Modifying parent theme files
▶ Using BuddyPress with an existing WordPress theme
I
n Chapter 4, I take you through the process of installing BuddyPress 
on your WordPress-powered Web site, including installing the default 
BuddyPress themes. Refer to Chapter 4 if you feel like you need to review the 
default BuddyPress themes and their locations on your Web server.
In this chapter, you discover the concept of the parent/child theme frame-
work that the BuddyPress themes are built upon. You can use this framework 
to build your own themes for BuddyPress. I provide you best practices in 
modifying the parent template files and integrating BuddyPress into an exist-
ing WordPress theme and include some helpful code snippets that will assist 
you in making your site a bit more dynamic and interactive.
 
In Chapter 10, I discuss the history of the BuddyPress Classic and BuddyPress 
Parent theme and explained that in this book I will be working primarily with 
the BuddyPress Default theme. However, the concepts and ideas introduced 
can be applied toward the Classic theme, if you care to go that direction.
Understanding Parent/Child 
Theme Relationships
The concept behind parent/child themes is simple: The parent theme con-
tains the core programming that creates the functions and features on your 
site, and the child theme contains the images and styles that provide the 

194
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
base for your site’s layout and design. When someone visits your Web site, 
the theme customizations (in the form of Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS) and 
images stored in the child theme are loaded first, followed by the functions 
found in the parent theme.
Themes are divided into parent themes and child themes to keep the pro-
gramming of the theme functions safe from user edits while still allowing 
full customization of the theme files by using custom CSS and images. This 
parent/child theme relationship has the advantage of safeguarding the 
BuddyPress themes for future upgrades because you do not edit the core 
functions in the parent theme files — ever. The nature of child/parent theme 
relationships means that the child theme pulls the functions from the parent 
theme, keeping the parent theme completely unaltered. Future upgrades to 
BuddyPress will overwrite the parent theme, keeping the style and format-
ting changes you’ve made in the child theme safe from breaking during an 
upgrade. You can still alter the function files from the parent theme, if you 
find you need to, and in that case, there are still safeguards in place for you, 
which I discuss a bit later in this chapter.
 
The BuddyPress Default theme is considered a parent theme, as it contains all 
the core template files required to display the different BuddyPress features 
and components on your Web site. If you want to change the Default theme, 
I recommend that you create a child theme that pulls from the Default theme 
framework. I explain more about this a bit later in this chapter.
Exploring the BuddyPress parent theme
The bp-default theme folder, shown in Figure 11-1, should be in the 
/wp-content/themes/ folder on your Web server. Inside the bp-sn-
parent theme folder, you find the following folders with templates that 
contain the base code for the BuddyPress features and functions:
 
✓ _inc: This folder contains all the base styles (CSS), JavaScript files, and 
images for the BuddyPress admin bar and for the default formatting of 
the theme.
 
✓ Activity: The templates in this folder provide the functions for the activ-
ity streams on member profiles.
 
✓ Blogs: The templates in this folder provide the functions for blog track-
ing on member profiles.
 
✓ Forums: The templates in this folder provide the functions for the Group 
forums within your community. This folder also includes the bbPress 
software that powers the discussion forum feature.
 
✓ Groups: The templates in this folder provide the functions for the 
groups listings on member profiles, as well as group pages, wires, and 
forums.

195
 Chapter 11: Understanding Themes and Templates
 
✓ Members: The templates in this folder provide the functions for the 
Members Directory listing in your community site.
 
✓ Registration: The templates in this folder provide the functions for the 
registration page that visitors use to register for your site.
 
Figure 11-1: 
The 
BuddyPress 
Default 
theme 
directory.
 
Within the bp-default theme folder, you also find several template files 
that power all the functions and features for your WordPress site — pages, 
posts, archives, comments, and search results.
Because these files create a solid framework of combined WordPress and 
BuddyPress functions, you should never have to edit them. Actually, I strongly 
recommend that you refrain from editing the files found in the bp-default 
theme folder because upgrades to BuddyPress will overwrite any changed files 
with the newer upgraded BuddyPress files, and any customizations you’ve 
done to your community Web site will be lost.
Exploring the child theme
In the previous section, I emphasize that customizations or changes to your 
BuddyPress theme should not be made in the parent theme folder. Rather, 
changes should be made in a child theme folder. This theme folder should 
contain very few files, as shown in Figure 11-2:

196
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
 
✓ _inc: This folder contains the CSS that define the style and layout of the 
site, as well as the images that create the visual look of the design.
 
✓ screenshot.png: This is the thumbnail representation of the 
BuddyPress child theme that you see in the gallery of available themes 
on the Manage Themes page in your WordPress dashboard.
 
✓ style.css: This is the main CSS for the child theme used to define all of 
the different CSS files that are used, from both the parent and child theme.
 
Figure 11-2: 
The 
BuddyPress 
child theme 
directory.
 
Creating a child theme folder
Now that you have the basic files that need to exist within a child theme 
folder - why not create one? Here’s what you need to do:
 
1. Create a new folder on your computer for your child theme.
 
 Give the new folder the name you intend to call your new child theme. 
For our purposes here, I’ve created a folder called /child-theme — 
original, I know!
 
2. Copy files from the Buddypress Default theme.
 
 Download a copy of the following folders and files from the BuddyPress 
Default theme folder to the new /child-theme folder created on your 
local computer:

197
 Chapter 11: Understanding Themes and Templates
 
• /_inc folder and all files contained within
 
• style.css
 
• screenshot.png
 
3. Connect the new child theme to the parent Default theme in the 
style.css file. Do this by following these steps:
 
a. Open the style.css file in a text editor like NotePad. The first eight 
lines of the style.css file look like this:
/*
Theme Name: BuddyPress Default
Theme URI: http://buddypress.org/extend/themes/
Description: The default theme for BuddyPress.
Version: 1.2
Author: BuddyPress.org
Author URI: http://buddypress.org
*/
 
 Anything placed between the /* and */ characters in the style.css 
file is considered to be a comment — that is, a note left in plain 
English by the style sheet author to help readers understand the 
code. Comments do not affect the function of the code; in fact, 
browsers completely ignore them.
 
b. Edit the second line by giving your theme a new name.
 
 For my example child theme, I’ve named it New Child Theme, so 
the second line of the style.css looks like this:
Theme Name: New Child Theme
 
c. Add a line to the style.css that tells BuddyPress that your new child 
theme is using the BuddyPress Default theme as the parent framework.
 
 This line goes directly above the final comment closing mark. It is 
vital that this line gets included in your child theme style.css 
file because this is the line that connects your new child theme to 
the BuddyPress Default parent theme framework. The line is:
Template: bp-default
 
 When you are done, the final edits to the style.css look like this:
/*
Theme Name: New Child Theme
Theme URI: http://buddypress.org/extend/themes/
Description: The default theme for BuddyPress.
Version: 1.2
Author: BuddyPress.org
Author URI: http://buddypress.org
Template: bp-default
*/

198
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
 
4. Save the new style.css file into your new /child-theme folder on 
your local computer.
 
5. Upload the child theme folder to your Web server.
 
 Using your FTP client, upload the entire new /child-theme folder to 
your Web server into the /wp-content/themes/ directory.
 
6. Enable the New Child theme in the WordPress MU Site Admin menu.
 
 Click the Themes link in the Site Admin menu in the WordPress MU 
Dashboard and enable the New Child Theme there.
 
7. Activate the New Child Theme on your site.
 
 Click the Themes link under the Appearances menu in the WordPress 
MU Dashboard and activate the New Child Theme.
 
8. Customize the New Child Theme.
 
 You can now customize the style, formatting, and images of your New 
Child Theme freely, without damaging the integrity of the base/core tem-
plate theme files in the BuddyPress Default parent theme.
Chapter 12 takes you through the mechanics of tweaking your BuddyPress 
theme through CSS, including how to change the header image, background 
color, and font styles. This section simply shows you how the parent and 
child theme “talk” to one another. To understand that, you need to open and 
view the style.css file found in the root of the bp-default folder.
Because WordPress MU doesn’t have a built-in theme editor, as the single 
user version of WordPress does, you have to open theme files with your FTP 
(File Transfer Protocol) program. Most FTP programs let you view files by 
right-clicking the file with your mouse and choosing View, which opens the 
file locally on your computer using a simple text editor, such as Notepad.
At the beginning of the file, you see information about the theme, such as the 
theme name, author, description, and version; the theme and author URLs; 
and theme tags, which are keywords that describe the theme. The last line 
of the opening information section of the Template file indicates: Template: 
bp-default. This portion of the child theme’s style.css file is vital 
because it tells WordPress and BuddyPress what the parent theme is and 
where it needs to go to pull in all the features and functions for this theme. 
Without that line, WordPress and BuddyPress would not know which theme 
is the parent theme containing all the functions.
The other lines of code you see throughout the style.css file are commands 
that import different files and style sheets from the _inc folder within the 
theme, as well as from other directories within the child theme. For example, 
after the theme information section, the next line of the style.css file is
/* The default theme styles. */
@import url( _inc/css/default.css );

199
 Chapter 11: Understanding Themes and Templates
The @import command tells the program that you are importing another CSS 
file from a different directory location on your Web server. The second half of 
that command tells the program exactly where the file you’re importing exists.
The style.css file imports information from several CSS files in the child 
theme folders; if you want to remove any of these calls, you can do so by 
simply deleting the entire line and then saving and re-uploading the file. The 
files (including full paths) from which information is imported are
 
✓ @import url( _inc/css/default.css ); This style sheet formats 
the BuddyPress default layout and style.
 
✓ @import url(_inc/css/adminbar.css ); This style sheet con-
tains default styling and formatting for admin menu bar.
Using a custom CSS file in the child theme
Now you are ready to fully customize your BuddyPress child theme and keep 
it safe from being overwritten in future BuddyPress upgrades! All of the CSS 
files for you new Child Theme exist within the /_inc/css/ folder in your 
child theme. For the most part, you must edit the default.css file to cus-
tomize the look and feel of your BuddyPress community site, but you can 
also edit the adminbar.css file to edit the look and feel of the Site Admin 
menu bar at the top of your site.
I cover tweaking your CSS to customize your theme more fully in Chapter 12. 
For now, all you need to know is that any CSS styling you add to the default.
css file overrides all styles within the main style sheets in the parent theme. 
This is the main file you will use to customize the existing BuddyPress child 
theme with CSS styling of your own.
Using your own images in the child theme
As with the custom CSS file you create in the previous section, images for 
your theme design are found in the _inc/images folder in your child theme. 
Open the folder in your FTP application to find a number of images that make 
up the BuddyPress Default theme, as shown in Figure 11-3.
When you want to change any of the images that exist in the child theme, 
you create a new image (using your preferred graphic editor software, such 
as Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro); give it the same name as the file you are 
replacing; and then upload it to the _inc/images folder, which overwrites the 
original file. Likewise, if you delete any of the image files in the _inc/images 
directory in the child theme, the image will not load when your Web site loads 
in your browser. Any new images that you add need to be uploaded to this 
folder, and accounted for in the custom CSS file, which I discuss in Chapter 12.

Modifying Parent Template Files
I mention earlier in this chapter that modifying template files in the parent 
theme folder isn’t recommended and isn’t the best practice for modifying 
some of the functions that exist within those files. You might be wonder-
ing, then, how do you change any of the items within those files? Many 
WordPress and BuddyPress users really like to dig into their template files 
and customize them to add and subtract functions — it’s all part of the fun 
of using BuddyPress software. For example, how can you add a link in your 
site’s navigation menu when the navigation menu’s file is one that I am telling 
you not to touch?
The BuddyPress parent/child theme framework already has a solution for 
you — and it’s pretty easy! You can find the code for the navigation menu 
in the header.php file in the parent theme. To edit it, simply download a 
copy of the header.php file to your computer, make your changes, and 
then upload it into your child theme folder. The header.php file that exists 
within the child theme will override the one that exists within the parent 
theme. Basically, BuddyPress uses the template files from the parent theme 
by default — however, if a duplicate template file exists within your child 
theme, it will use that one instead.
You can apply this technique to any of the files and folders within the parent 
theme; you just have to remember that you have to re-create the very same 
folder and filenames in your child theme folder that exist within the parent 
theme folder.

201
 Chapter 11: Understanding Themes and Templates
For another example, say you want to change the way your Members Directory 
appears on your Web site. To do this, you would need to edit the files within 
the /members/ folder. Because you shouldn’t edit any of the files in the parent 
theme, you will need to re-create that file structure in your child theme. Create 
a folder called /friends/ in the /child-theme/ theme folder you created in 
the previous section of this chapter. Download a copy of the files from the ver-
sion of that folder in the /bp-default parent theme, and then upload those 
files into the /child-theme/members/ folder — at which point, you are free 
to edit and change the core template files to your heart’s desire.
 
The beauty of the parent/child theme relationship, as it relates to editing core 
template files, is if you make a mistake in the coding of a core template file and 
don’t know how to fix it, you can simply delete it from your child theme, and 
the copy of that same file within the parent theme takes over.
Using a WordPress Theme 
with BuddyPress
Users can download and use literally thousands of free WordPress themes on 
their WordPress-powered sites. The majority of those themes can be found 
in the official WordPress themes directory at http://wordpress.org/
extend/themes.
Many WordPress users want to integrate BuddyPress features into their exist-
ing site, but want to continue using their favorite WordPress theme instead 
of switching to the BuddyPress Default theme. This is possible to accomplish 
with just a few steps:
 
1. Make a backup copy of your existing WordPress theme.
 
 Simply download a copy of your theme from your Web server to your 
local computer. It is always, always a good idea to make a backup of files 
before you do something that is going to affect them.
 
2. Copy files from the BuddyPress parent theme.
 
 Download all the folders and that exist within the /bp-default theme 
folder to your local computer. Just the folders, however; not the files 
that sit within the root of the /bp-default theme folder.
 
3. Upload the BuddyPress parent theme folders to your WordPress 
theme folder.
 
 Using your FTP program, upload the folders you copied in Step 2 into 
the WordPress theme folder that you are currently using on your site.

202
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
 
4. Open the style.css file in your WordPress theme.
 
 Using your FTP program, right-click the style.css file in your 
WordPress theme folder and choose Edit to open the file locally in a text 
editor, such as Notepad.
 
5. Add the line to call in the components.css file from the parent theme.
 
 Add the following line to your style.css file beneath the theme infor-
mation comments:
@import url( _inc/css/default.css );
@import url( _inc/css/adminbar.css );
 
 This pulls in the component styling for BuddyPress components and 
applies it to your existing WordPress theme.
 
6. Edit and adjust the CSS file, as needed.
 
 You might need to do this to adjust the BuddyPress areas of your site 
for consistent styling with your WordPress theme. (See Chapter 12 for 
basic CSS information.)
Integrating BuddyPress into an existing WordPress theme is not an exact 
science, and there are no absolute steps to follow to create a perfect inte-
gration. The reason for this is simple — WordPress themes differ from one 
another in terms of style, function, and framework. You will probably need 
to play around with the CSS and styling of your WordPress themes to make 
the BuddyPress components fit in flawlessly; however, the previous steps get 
you started on your way to full and successful integration. 
 
The development environment surrounding BuddyPress is pretty fast-paced, so 
the BuddyPress you know today is likely to be different than the BuddyPress 
you come to know in a year — or even six months — from now. It’s good to be 
armed with a resource that can help you stay up-to-date on changing tech-
niques and information. Bookmark the official BuddyPress Codex, which is a 
repository of documents and information on the use of BuddyPress, as well as 
what is new and changing: http://codex.buddypress.org.

n Chapter 11 of this book, I provide information on how to create a new 
child theme using the BuddyPress Default parent theme as a framework, 
and you even dipped a little bit into editing the style.css file for your new 
child theme. However, I cannot tell you how many times people have asked 
me how they can customize a theme that they’ve found. They ask things to 
me like:
 
✓ I like this free theme I found, but I really want to change the header 
image — how do I do that?
 
✓ I found this great theme, but I really need to change the background 
color from black to pink — can I do that, or do I need to hire someone?
 
✓ This theme I have is perfect; although, I wish I could change the font 
from Times New Roman to Tahoma — can you tell me how to do that?
The practice of changing a few elements within an existing theme is tweaking, 
and thousands of Web site owners tweak their existing themes on a regu-
lar basis. This chapter provides you with information on some of the most 
common tweaks you can make to your theme, such as changing the header 
image, changing the color of the background or the text links in your theme, 
or changing font styles — and they are pretty easy, too! You’ll be tweaking 
your own theme in no time!

204
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
Styling with CSS: The Basics
In every WordPress and BuddyPress theme you use in your blog, is a 
Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). The CSS provides style and design flair to the 
template tags in your templates. (See Chapter 11 for information about 
BuddyPress templates.) The CSS files (.css) for your theme are called into, 
and applied to, your site theme through the Header template (header.php) 
and is named style.css.
Have a look inside the header.php file of the parent BuddyPress theme. 
Remember, WordPress MU does not have a built-in theme editor, so you need 
to open the header.php file using your FTP program. Inside the header.php 
file is the following line of code, which pulls the CSS (style.css) into the 
page to provide the formatting of the elements of your site:
<link rel=”stylesheet” href=”<?php bloginfo(‘stylesheet_
url’); ?>” type=”text/css” media=”screen” />
 
Do not tweak the line of code that calls in the style.css file; otherwise, the 
CSS won’t work for your blog.
CSS selectors
With CSS, you can provide style (such as size, color, and placement) to the 
display of elements on your blog (by making changes to text links, header 
images, font size, font colors, paragraph margins, and line spacing). CSS selec-
tors contain names, properties, and values to define which HTML elements in 
the templates you will style with CSS. Table 12-1 provides some examples of 
CSS selectors and their use.

Classes and IDs
Look at the default.css style sheet for the BuddyPress Default parent 
theme (see Figure 12-1). Everything in it might look foreign to you right now, 
but I want to bring your attention to two items:
 
✓ #wp-admin-bar: One type of CSS selector. The hash mark (#) indicates 
that it’s a CSS ID.
 
✓ .ajax-loader: Another type of CSS selector. The period (.) indicates 
that it’s a CSS class.
IDs and classes define styling properties for different sections of your 
WordPress theme. Table 12-2 shows examples of IDs from the header.php 
template in the BuddyPress parent theme. Armed with this information, 
you’ll know where to look in the style sheet when you want to change the 
styling for a particular area of your theme.

the template code that says class (such as div class= or p class=), look 
for the period in the style sheet followed by the selector name.

 Chapter 12: Tweaking the Default Theme with CSS
CSS properties and values
CSS properties are assigned to the CSS selector name. You also need to pro-
vide values for the CSS properties to define the style elements for the particu-
lar CSS selector you’re working with.
In the BuddyPress Default parent theme, for example, one of the first pieces 
of markup in the Header template (header.php) is <div id=”header”>. 
This ID, with the name header, provides styling for the site page.
In the default.css of your child theme style sheet (found in /_inc/
css/), the CSS defined for the header ID, preceded by the hash mark (#), 
is as follows:
#header {
     overflow: auto;
     width: 100%;
}
 
Every CSS property needs to be followed by a colon (:), and each CSS value 
needs to be followed by a semicolon (;).
The CSS selector is #header, which has several properties; however, many 
users would like to change two:
 
✓ The CSS color property has the value #fff, which is white. You can edit 
that color to make it display whatever color you want just by removing 
#fff and replacing it with a different color value.
 
✓ The CSS background property has the value of url(../images/
default_header.jpg);. You can edit the background by changing 
the image file that is defined in the background value.
Table 12-3 provides some examples of commonly used CSS properties and 
values.

Changing the Background Color
In this section, I show you how to tweak the <body> tag in the BuddyPress 
Default parent theme. The <body> tag is simple HTML markup. Every theme 
has this tag, which defines the overall default content for each page of your 
Web site — the site’s body.
In the BuddyPress child theme that you create in Chapter 11, the default.
css file (found in /_inc/css/default.css) has body styles defined like 
this:
body {
background: #eaeaea url( ../images/background.gif ) top 
left repeat-x;
font-size: 12px;
font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;

209
 Chapter 12: Tweaking the Default Theme with CSS
line-height: 160%;
color: #555555;
width: 90%;
min-width: 960px;
max-width: 1250px;
margin: 0 auto;
padding-top: 0 !important; /* Remove the top padding space 
for the admin bar in this theme */
} 
The background for the <body> tag assigns a light gray color using the hex 
code #eaeaea (although an image is not assigned as a background element, 
you can assign one):
 
✓ Color: A hexadecimal (or hex) code represents a certain color. Hex 
codes always start with a hash symbol (#) and have six letters and/or 
numbers to represent a particular color — in this case, #eaeaea. Table 
12-4 lists some common colors and the corresponding hex codes. (The 
W3Schools Web site has a great resource on hex codes at http://
w3schools.com/HTML/html_colornames.asp.)
 
 Image: You can easily use an image as a background for your site by 
uploading the image to the images folder in the BuddyPress child 
theme folder in /_inc/images/. That value would look like back-
ground: url(_inc/images/yourimage.jpg). (Note: The url 
portion of this code automatically pulls in the URL of your blog, so you 
don’t have to change the url part to your URL.)
 
You can also use a combination of colors and images in your backgrounds.

Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
 
In the case of some basic colors, you don’t have to use the hex code. For 
colors such as white, black, red, blue, and silver, you can just use their 
names — background-color: white, for example. Additionally, CSS 
rules allow certain colors to use shortened hex codes down to three 
characters — these rules mainly apply to primary colors like white, which 
can be shortened to #fff, and black, which can be shortened to #000, for 
example.
To change the background color of your BuddyPress theme, add the follow-
ing lines to the default.css file in the child theme (found in the /_inc/
css folder) that you create in Chapter 11:
body {
background: #ffffff url( ../images/background.gif ) top 
left repeat-x;
font-size: 12px;
font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif;
line-height: 160%;
color: #555555;
width: 90%;
min-width: 960px;
max-width: 1250px;
margin: 0 auto;
padding-top: 0 !important; /* Remove the top padding space 
for the admin bar in this theme */
} 
Because this changes the background value from #eaeaea (light gray) to 
#ffffff (white), these lines change the color of the background of your 
BuddyPress site from gray to white.
 
Any styles you define in the default.css in the BuddyPress child theme 
folder overrules any styles that exist in any other style sheet within your 
theme. Adding CSS styling directives to the default.css causes those 
changes to occur on your site as soon as you edit and upload the file on your 
Web server.
Using Your Own Logo in the Header
In the BuddyPress Default theme, your site name appears as text, as shown in 
Figure 12-2. Although this is nice for some people, others might want to dis-
play a logo file or graphic in that area, instead of simple text.
To accomplish this, you need to have an image file that you are ready to use, 
and will need to add a few bits of CSS to your default.css file:

211
 Chapter 12: Tweaking the Default Theme with CSS
 
Figure 12-2: 
The site 
name dis-
played on 
a Buddy
Press site 
using the 
BuddyPress 
Default 
theme.
 
 
1. Upload your header graphic to your Web server.
 
 Images used in the BuddyPress theme should be uploaded to the images 
folder in the child theme: /_inc/images/ — this way, you always know 
where the image files are located. Using FTP, upload your chosen header 
graphic to your Web server.
 
2. Open the default.css file from the BuddyPress child theme.
 
 Using your FTP program, locate the default.css file in the /_inc/
css/ folder, right-click it, and then choose Edit.
 
3. Add the CSS values to call in your header image.
 
 For purposes of this section, let’s say your header image has the file 
name: header.jpg. Because you want to use an image to replace 
the text, you also have to account for the CSS for this portion of the 
header.php file: <h1 id=”logo”><a href=”... The current CSS for 
the header is located in the default.css file in your child theme and 
looks like this:
#header h1 {
position: absolute;
bottom: 12px;
left: 15px;
width: 44%;
}
#header h1 a {
color: #fff;
font-size: 26px;
text-decoration: none;
}
 
 In a recent project I did for a client, I used the following CSS in the 
default.css file to override the CSS code in the parent default.css 
file to use a logo for the header, instead of plain text:

212
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
#header h1 {
background: url(../images/logo.png) no-repeat;
width: 230px; 
height: 60px;
position: absolute;
bottom: 0px;
left: 15px;
}
#header h1 a {
color: #fff;
font-size: 0px;
text-decoration: none;
}
 
 You can see in the previous example that I included a header image file 
called logo.png and also added in a height and width property to the 
h1#logo selector and changed the font size to 0 so it displays only the 
image, not the text.
Your needs might vary when it comes to using an image file for the site 
name and top area of your Web site, depending on the type and size of the 
image you want to use. However, if you follow my previous example, it will 
point you toward making the necessary adjustments you need for your spe-
cific image, site design, and formatting.
Changing Font Styles, Colors, and Sizes
Fonts come in all shapes and sizes, and you can use CSS to define the font styles 
that display in your blog. Changing the font can change the look and feel of your 
blog dramatically, as well as improve your readers’ experience by making the 
text easy on the eyes. Table 12-5 displays some of the most commonly used CSS 
properties and values for applying font styling to your style sheet.
Table 12-5

213
 Chapter 12: Tweaking the Default Theme with CSS
The Web is actually kind of picky about how it displays fonts, as well as what 
kind of fonts you can use in the font-family property. Not all fonts display 
correctly on the Web. To be safe, here are some commonly used font families 
that display correctly in most browsers:
 
✓ Serif fonts: Times New Roman, Georgia, Garamond, Bookman Old Style
 
✓ Sans-serif fonts: Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS
 
Serif fonts have little tails, or curlicues, at the edges of letters. (This text is in 
a serif font.) Sans-serif fonts have straight edges and are devoid of any fancy 
styling. (Table 12-5 uses a sans-serif font.)
When you want to change a font family in your CSS, open the style sheet 
(style.css), search for property: font-family, change the values for 
that property, and then save your changes.
If, in your CSS file, the font is defined in the <body> tag like this:
font-family: ‘Lucida Grande’, Verdana, Arial, Sans-Serif;
You can change the family of the font by changing the font names to some-
thing like:
font-family: verdana, arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
You can easily change the color of your font by changing the color property 
of the CSS selector you want to tweak. You can use hex codes (refer to Table 
12-4) to define the colors.
If, in your CSS file, the font color is defined in the <body> tag like this:
color: #000000;
You can change the color by changing the value to something like:
color: #ffffff
You can tweak the size of your font by changing the font-size property of 
the CSS selector. Generally, units of measurement determine font sizes, as in 
these examples:
 
✓ px: Pixel measurement. Increasing or decreasing the number of pixels 
increases or decreases the font size (12px is larger than 10px).
 
✓ pt: Point measurement. As with pixels, increasing or decreasing the 
number of points affects the font size accordingly (12pt is larger 
than 10pt).

214
Part IV: Customizing BuddyPress 
 
✓ %: Percentage measurement. Increasing or decreasing the percentage 
number affects the font size accordingly (50% is the equivalent to 7 
pixels; 100% is the equivalent to 17 pixels).
Sometimes, the font size is defined in the body tag as a percentage, like this: 
font-size: 62.5%;
Putting all three elements (font-family, color, and font-size) together in the 
<body> tag styles the font for the overall body of your site. Here’s how they 
work together in the <body> tag of a CSS file:
body {
font-size: 62.5%;
font-family: ‘Lucida Grande’, Verdana, Arial, Sans-Serif;
color: #333;
}

Extending 
BuddyPress

In this part . . .
U
sing community-developed plugins for BuddyPress, 
you can extend the functionality of your 
BuddyPress social community to fit your needs and the 
needs of your community members. This part explores 
where to find and download BuddyPress plugins and how 
to install and use them in your community. This part also 
explores the popularity of social networks and media Web 
sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, and shows you how 
to add their content to your community Web site.

Chapter 13
Getting Plugged In with Plugins
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding what plugins are
▶ Finding BuddyPress plugins
▶ Installing plugins
▶ Activating and using BuddyPress plugins
F
or the WordPress platform, literally thousands of plugins are available 
that allow you to extend the features you can make available on your 
site. Actually, BuddyPress is a WordPress plugin — one that adds a social 
community component to your site. This chapter is about BuddyPress 
plugins — that is, it’s about the plugins you can install into the WordPress 
plugin known as BuddyPress. It is a little confusing, I know. Think of it in a dif-
ferent way — the plugins you can install to extend the features of BuddyPress 
are actually WordPress plugins that work on a WordPress-powered site that 
has BuddyPress activated. If BuddyPress is not installed and activated, these 
plugins will not work. In short: BuddyPress is required.
This chapter takes you through the installation of a BuddyPress plugin, which 
then gives you the mechanics and knowledge you need to install any plugin 
using the same steps. In Chapter 14, I take you through the installation of plugins 
that integrate popular social network sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, 
into your BuddyPress community. Finally, Chapter 15 gives you a look at ten 
BuddyPress plugins that add some great features to your community Web site.
For this chapter, I assume that the WordPress MU software is successfully 
running along with the BuddyPress plugin on your Web server.
Understanding What Plugins Are
A plugin is a small script that interacts with an application to provide some 
additional functions and features. Plugins are not part of the core software 
files that you install when you upload the WordPress software to your Web 
server and they do not function as stand-alone programs. They require a host 
program (in this case, WordPress MU and BuddyPress) in order to function 

218

at all. If left by themselves, they do nothing, except maybe produce some 
unsightly PHP errors on your Web site.
Like WordPress and BuddyPress, most plugins are free. In fact, for 
WordPress, literally thousands of free plugins are available for users to down-
load and install. 
 
The plugins I talk about in this book are BuddyPress-related plugins; that 
is, these plugins will work only if you are running both WordPress MU and 
BuddyPress on your site.
Finding and Installing 
BuddyPress Plugins
There is no need to hunt and peck around the Internet to find useful plugins 
for BuddyPress. WordPress makes it easy to locate the plugins you want to try 
out — just use the handy plugin search feature on your WordPress MU dash-
board (See Chapter 4 for information on where to find, and how to use the plugin 
search feature). To find the plugin you want, you choose Plugins➪Add New, 
which loads the Install Plugins page, as shown in Figure 13-1.
 
Figure 13-1: 
Find and 
install great 
plugins on 
the Install 
Plugins 
page.
 

219
 Chapter 13: Getting Plugged In with Plugins
The Install Plugins page gives you the ability to search, locate, install, and 
activate WordPress (and BuddyPress) plugins directly from your WordPress 
dashboard. This only works for plugins that are currently in the WordPress 
Plugin Directory, which you can find by browsing to http://wordpress.
org/extend/plugins.
On the Install Plugins page, you can browse WordPress plugins with the fil-
ters provided at the top:
 
✓ Featured: Displays plugins currently featured in the WordPress Plugin 
Directory that WordPress wants to draw attention to, mostly due to 
their usefulness to WordPress users.
 
✓ Popular: Display the most popular plugins, determined by the number 
of user downloads.
 
✓ Newest: Displays the latest plugins added to the WordPress Plugin 
Directory.
 
✓ Recently Updated: Displays plugins recently updated within the 
WordPress Plugin Directory.
At the bottom of the Install Plugins page, you can also browse plugins in 
the Popular Tags section. This section provides you with a list of keywords 
that correspond to plugin topics. Click any of these keywords to find related 
plugins.
You have two methods of installing plugins on your WordPress site: use 
the automatic method with the built-in plugin installer in WordPress, or the 
manual method, which involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to 
your Web server. Both methods install the plugin on your site, and really, 
the only reason you would use the manual method is if the particular plugin 
you want to use is not in the Plugin Directory. Sometimes, plugin developers 
choose not to submit their plugins to the official directory, so you may find a 
plugin or two that you will have to download from the developer’s site, and 
then upload it using FTP, to your Web server. I cover both installation meth-
ods in this chapter.
Installing plugins using the 
Install Plugins interface
Because you are setting up and running a BuddyPress social community 
site, you want to find plugins that help you extend the functionality of the 
BuddyPress features. One way to find them is by using the search feature 
found in the middle of the Install Plugins page. Just enter a keyword, author, 

220
Part V: Extending BuddyPress 
or tag into the text box and then press the Search Plugins button. When you 
find what you’re looking for, install the plugin. The following steps show you 
how to:
 
1. Type BuddyPress into the search box.
 
 Be sure Term is selected in the drop-down menu to the left of the search 
box; this tells the WordPress software that you want to search by a term 
or keyword. You also have the option to search by Author (the plugin 
author’s name, if you know it) or Tag. When plugin developers add their 
plugin to the official directory, they can tag their plugins with defining 
keywords, and you can search the directory using these tags.
 
 In this case, you are searching for BuddyPress plugins, so type 
BuddyPress in the search box and then click the Search Plugins 
button; the Install Plugins page displays the plugins you can use with 
BuddyPress, as shown in Figure 13-2.
 
 Plugins appear in a table displaying several pieces of information for 
each plugin:
 
• Name: The title of the plugin.
 
• Version: The plugin version number.
 
• Rating: The rating of the plugin, determined by community users 
and a star rating system in which five stars is the highest rating 
and one star is the lowest. The average number of stars the plugin 
has received displays in the Rating column.
 
• Description: A description of the plugin features.
 
• Actions: This column contains the link to click to install the plugin 
on your Web site.
 
2. Install a BuddyPress plugin from the list.
 
 The BuddyPress plugin I’m installing for this chapter is the Group Forum 
Subscription for BuddyPress plugin, which allows members to subscribe 
to individual forums and topics within the community so they receive noti-
fication when that particular forum or topic updates with new discussion.
 
 Find the Group Forum Subscription for BuddyPress plugin in the list 
and click the Install link in the Actions column. A small window appears 
and displays a description of the plugin, the version number, the author 
name, and an Install Now button, as shown in Figure 13-3.

3. Click the Install Now button.
 
 The Installing Plugin: Group Forum Subscription for BuddyPress page 
appears on your WordPress dashboard. A message confirms that the 
plugin has been downloaded, unpacked, and successfully stored in the 
correct directory on your Web server.
 
 Two links are shown beneath the confirmation message:
 
• Activate Plugin: Click this link to activate the plugin you just 
installed on your site.
 
• Return to Plugins Page: Click this link to go to the Manage Plugins 
page.
 
 Before you activate any BuddyPress-related plugins, you need to make 
sure that the BuddyPress plugin, itself, is activated. If BuddyPress is not 
activated, any BuddyPress-related plugins you try to activate will cause 
errors and the activation will fail.
 
4. Click the Activate Plugin link.
 
 This takes you to the Manage Plugins page, which displays a listing of 
plugins installed on your site. The new plugin you just installed is now 
listed with the active plugins. You should now have the Group Forum 
Subscription for BuddyPress plugin installed and activated on your site.
You can refer to the previous steps to install and activate any plugin on your 
site using the built-in plugin installer on your WordPress dashboard. Several 
plugins extend the features in your BuddyPress community, and I list some 
great ones in Chapter 15.
Installing plugins manually
In the previous section, I show you how to install plugins automatically using 
the WordPress dashboard. In this section, I show you how to find, upload, 
and install the Group Forum Subscription for BuddyPress plugin manually. 
This requires that you download, unpack, upload, and activate the plugin 
with your WordPress MU and BuddyPress community site.
The Group Forum Subscription for BuddyPress plugin allows members of 
your community to subscribe to individual forum discussion topics. After 
members subscribe to a forum or topic, they receive notifications via e-mail 
and via their BuddyPress accounts that a new discussion has been added. 
This feature encourages more discussions in your group forums because 
when people know that others are participating, it sparks more talk!

223
 Chapter 13: Getting Plugged In with Plugins
To install the Group Forum Subscription for BuddyPress on your site using 
the manual installation method, you must accomplish the following:
 
✓ Download and unpack the plugin files.
 
✓ Upload the plugin files to your Web server.
 
✓ Activate the plugin in your community.
The next sections discuss these tasks in detail.
Downloading the plugin files from the WordPress Plugin Directory
To download and unpack the Group Forum Subscription for BuddyPress 
using the manual installation method, follow these steps:
 
1. Visit the WordPress Plugin Directory to find and install the plugin.
 
 Type the URL for the plugin directory (http://wordpress.org/
extend/plugins) in your browser address bar to go to the site. 
 
2. Search for the plugin by typing Group Forum Subscription for 
BuddyPress in the Search box and then click the Search Plugins 
button.
 
 A page appears that lists the link to the plugin, as shown in Figure 13-4.

224
Part V: Extending BuddyPress 
 
3. Click the Group Forum Subscription for BuddyPress link.
 
 On the plugin page that appears, you find a description of the plugin, as 
well as other information about the plugin (see Figure 13-5). For exam-
ple, take note of the following important information in the FYI box:
 
• Version: The version number shown is the most recent version of 
the plugin.
 
• Other Versions: This link takes you to a page that displays all the 
previous versions of the plugin. This is helpful if you have to revert 
to an older version of the plugin if the new version fails when you 
install it.
 
• Last Updated: The date the plugin author last updated the plugin 
files in the directory.
 
• Requires WordPress Version: This tells you the version of 
WordPress MU and BuddyPress that needs to be installed to run 
this plugin successfully on your site.
 
• Compatible Up to: This tells you what version of the WordPress 
MU and BuddyPress software this plugin is compatible with. For 
example, if this section tells you that the plugin is compatible up to 
version 2.8, you cannot use the plugin with versions higher than 2.8.
 
• Author Homepage: This link takes you to the plugin author’s main 
Web site.
 
• Plugin Homepage: This link takes you to the specific Web site 
address for the plugin. Often, this is a page within the plugin 
author’s Web site.
 
4. Download the Group Forum Subscription for BuddyPress plugin.
 
 Click Download on the right of the Plugin Directory page; a dialog box 
opens and asks whether you want to open or save the file. Save the Zip 
file to your hard drive and remember where you save it.
 
5. Locate the Zip file you just downloaded on your hard drive and open 
it with your preferred decompression program.
 
 If you’re unsure how to use a decompression program (such as WinZip 
or WinRar), refer to the documentation available with the program).
 
6. Unpack the plugin file you downloaded for the Group Forum 
Subscription for BuddyPress plugin.
 
 Using your preferred archiving program, such as WinZip, unpack the 
plugin files to a folder of your choice on your local computer.

Often, plugin authors include a helpful readme.txt file with their plugin 
files to give you some additional information about the use of the plugin. I 
strongly recommend opening that file and reading it, because more often 
than not, it contains information you should know. The Group Forum 
Subscription for BuddyPress plugin has a readme.txt file, as shown in the 
Plugins folder structure in Figure 13-6.

Part V: Extending BuddyPress 
Uploading the plugin files to your Web server
All plugin files, whether they are WordPress plugins, or BuddyPress-related 
plugins, are uploaded into a dedicated /wp-content/plugins folder in 
your WordPress installation directory on your Web server.
Using your preferred FTP (File Transfer Protocol) program, upload the plugin 
folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ folder within the WordPress instal-
lation on your Web server. If you need a quick review on how to use FTP to 
transfer files from your computer to your Web server, flip to Chapter 2.
Activating the plugin on your WordPress dashboard
After you upload the plugin files successfully to your Web server, open your 
browser, log in to your WordPress dashboard, and follow these steps to acti-
vate the Group Forum Subscription for BuddyPress plugin:
 
1. Choose Plugins➪Installed to visit the Manage Plugins page on your 
WordPress dashboard.
 
2. Locate the Group Forum Subscription for BuddyPress plugin.
 
 Because you haven’t activated this plugin, it’s located in the Inactive 
Plugins section at the bottom of the Manage Plugins page.
 
3. Click the Activate link.
 
 The Activate link is directly beneath the plugin name; click it and 
the Manage Plugins page reloads. You now see the Group Forum 
Subscription for BuddyPress plugin listed in the Active Plugins section.
 
Before you activate any BuddyPress-related plugins, you need to make sure 
that the BuddyPress plugin is activated. If BuddyPress is not activated, any 
BuddyPress-related plugins you try to activate will cause errors and the acti-
vation will fail.
If you followed the steps in this section correctly, you now have the new plugin 
installed and activated on your site and ready to use — congratulations!
Managing Plugin Options
Many, but not all, WordPress/BuddyPress plugins provide an Options page 
that contains settings pertinent to the individual plugin. The settings on the 
plugin’s Options page will vary from plugin to plugin, and generally con-
tain settings that will assist you in individualizing the settings to suit your 
needs for your Web site. When the plugin is installed, the link to this page 

227

can usually be found on the Settings menu or the BuddyPress menu on your 
WordPress dashboard. In short, if the plugin you installed has an Options 
page, you just need to look in the menus on the WordPress dashboard to find 
the link to it.
In the case of the Group Forum Subscription for BuddyPress plugin you 
install in this chapter, the link to the Options page is labeled Group Forum 
Subscription on the BuddyPress menu. When you click it, the Group Forum 
Subscription Options page appears, as shown in Figure 13-7.

Uninstalling Plugins
After all this talk about installing and activating plugins, what happens when 
you decide you don’t want to use a particular plugin anymore and want to un-
install it? Don’t worry — you aren’t stuck forever with a plugin that you don’t 
want. WordPress lets you be fickle and finicky about your plugin options.
To uninstall a plugin:
 
1. Choose Plugins➪Installed.
 
 The Manage Plugins page appears.

228
Part V: Extending BuddyPress 
 
2. Locate the plugin you wish to un-install.
 
3. Click the Deactivate link beneath the plugin’s name.
 
 The Manage Plugins page reloads and shows the plugin in the Inactive 
Plugin list.
 
4. Select the plugin.
 
 Place a checkmark in the box to the left of the plugin name.
 
5. Select Delete and then click the Apply button.
 
 The Delete Plugins(s) page opens and a confirmation message displays 
asking you whether you’re sure that you want to delete this plugin.
 
 When you delete a plugin, it’s gone forever. Of course, you can follow 
the steps in this chapter to re-install the plugin if you really mess up or 
accidentally uninstall a plugin you didn’t intend to.
 
6. Click the Yes Delete These Files button.
 
 The Manage Plugins page reloads and the plugin you just deleted is gone 
from the list of plugins.
You’re done with deleting the plugin — that’s all it takes!
 
Don’t forget to remove any bits of code that you added to your theme tem-
plates for that particular plugin; otherwise, they’ll cause ugly error messages 
to display on your blog.
 
If you intend to de-activate the BuddyPress plugin, it is extremely important 
that you de-activate any BuddyPress-related plugins before you de-activate 
BuddyPress. If you do not, it will result in some pretty ugly errors on your site.
This chapter took you through finding BuddyPress plugins within the 
WordPress plugin interface; however, the following list shows you some 
places you can visit on the Web to find more about BuddyPress plugins, 
including where to find them and discussions related to their development.
 
✓ BuddyPress Forums — Plugins (http://buddypress.org/forums/
tags/plugins): The section of the BuddyPress forums where users 
and developers discuss plugins.
 
✓ BuddyPress Extend (http://buddypress.org/extend/plugins): 
The page on the BuddyPress Web site that lists plugins.
 
✓ WordPress Extend (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/
search.php?q=BuddyPress): The page in the WordPress Plugin 
Directory to find BuddyPress related plugins.

229
 Chapter 13: Getting Plugged In with Plugins
Understanding Open Source Concepts
The WordPress platforms and the BuddyPress suite of plugins are licensed 
by something called GPL, which stands for General Public License, and 
distributed as open source software. Simply put, software that is released 
as open source can be freely redistributed; does not require royalty, or any 
other associated, fees; the source code of the software is released to the gen-
eral public; and any derivative work must adopt the very same license under 
which the original software was released. Plugins are considered derivative 
works, so you find that almost all the plugins out there are open source and 
free for you and I to use.
 
To find out more about the open source software, go to the Open Source 
Initiative Web site at http://opensource.org.
You might ask whether the Open Source/GPL concept even applies to you 
since you aren’t a plugin developer. Yes, there are implications that you and I 
need to consider when using open source software and plugins, including:
 
✓ The software is free and that generally means that the developers who 
create WordPress, BuddyPress, and related plugins and themes are giving 
their development work away at no cost. For many developers, this is a 
way to boost their exposure in the community and pass on their work to 
a worthy cause, such as free and open software. This pretty much trans-
lates into zero overhead for you, me, and all other WordPress Web site 
owners, because the cost is exactly nothing. It’s free.
 
 Because it’s free, and because these developers are giving away their 
time and talents at no cost, the developer who created your favorite 
plugin is not obligated to continue development on it in the future. If the 
developer finds a new hobby, new job, or any other activity that takes 
him away from his development work, he can walk away from develop-
ment work on your favorite plugin at any time. If no one picks up where 
he left off, and the plugin stops working with the latest version of your 
software, you can kiss that plugin goodbye.
 
✓ Developers of popular plugins are typically extremely good about updat-
ing the plugins when new versions of WordPress and BuddyPress are 
released, or when a security bug or flaw is discovered. Keep in mind, 
however, that no timetable exists for these developers. Many of these 
folks have day jobs, classes, or families that can keep them from devot-
ing as much time to the project as you’d like them to.
 
✓ Beware of the pitfalls of falling in love with any particular plugin for 
BuddyPress because the world of plugin development is easy come, 
easy go. Try not to let your Web site become too dependent on any one 
plugin in particular, and don’t be surprised if a plugin you love doesn’t 
exist tomorrow. You can use the plugin for as long as it continues to 

230
Part V: Extending BuddyPress 
work for you, but when it stops working (such as with a new WordPress 
or BuddyPress release, or a security exploit that makes it unusable), you 
have a decision to make. You can
 
• Stop using the plugin and try to find a suitable alternative.
 
• Hope that another developer takes over the project if the original 
developer discontinues his involvement.
 
• Try to find a consultant to hire and fix it for you (in which case, 
you’ll more than likely have to pay his hourly fee for such services).
Understanding the dynamics in play with plugin development is very impor-
tant and not all gloom and doom. However, I did want to make sure that 
you’re aware of the potential problems you might encounter with the open 
source WordPress and BuddyPress technologies. Forewarned is forearmed; 
consider it food for thought as you continue building your online social com-
munity on the Web.

Chapter 14
Integrating Popular Social Media
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring popular social media
▶ Connecting BuddyPress with Facebook
▶ Publishing Twitter feeds on member profiles
S
ince 2007, Facebook.com, Twitter.com, MySpace.com, Youtube.com and 
Flickr.com have taken the Internet by storm. These Web sites all have 
one thing in common: They build social communities on the Web.
Running a social community on your Web site using BuddyPress presents 
you with a bit of a challenge: How does your community compete with all the 
other, much larger communities on the Web? The answer is easy: Your site 
doesn’t compete; your site collaborates by inviting your members to connect 
their memberships in other social networks, like Facebook and Twitter, with 
their account on your site so they can use those tools together, rather than 
separately.
This chapter shows you how you can integrate some very popular social 
network services, like Facebook and Twitter, into your BuddyPress-powered 
social community to give your members features and tools that enable them 
to gather their content from other social communities and share them in 
your community.
Discovering Popular Social Networks
One great way to use the World Wide Web is to network with other people 
around the world by participating in social community Web sites. You can 
use these sites to share photos, videos, and music, or you can use them to 
have conversations with other people who share your interests. Social net-
works allow you to keep up with your friends, find old friends, and even make 
new ones. Social networks facilitate the sharing of content, and the content 
you find within them tends to be user-generated — meaning, the users create 
the content they share with others.

232
Part V: Extending BuddyPress 
Social network sites and services are used by groups of people, such as small 
businesses or large corporations, and by individuals, such as your grocer 
down the street or your favorite big screen movie actor. Social network sites 
enable people to connect with other people from many different places in 
the world, which is something people normally wouldn’t easily be able to do. 
Social media provides the population of the world with a thread of connec-
tion and helps people build new, and lasting, relationships through the shar-
ing of information and conversation.
Table 14-1 displays four of the most popular social network sites on the Web, 
including their Web addresses and brief descriptions of their services. Later 
in this chapter, you discover how to connect these four social networks to 
your own BuddyPress social community, allowing your members to bring 
their shared content into your network.

Connecting BuddyPress and Facebook
People who are interested in joining your social community Web site are 
already likely to be members of some, if not all, of the social network sites I 
mention in this chapter. To encounter a savvy Web user today who doesn’t 
have a Facebook account and profile set up is rare.

233
 Chapter 14: Integrating Popular Social Media
Using a simple plugin for BuddyPress, you can give your members the ability 
to log in to your community by using their Facebook credentials. Providing 
this option makes it more efficient for people who have a Facebook account 
to join your community because such users won’t need to go through the 
entire new user sign up process I describe in Chapter 6. Here’s how to add 
this plugin to your community:
 
1. Download and install the BP-FB Connect (BuddyPress-Facebook 
Connect) plugin.
 
 You can find the plugin in the WordPress Plugin Directory at http://
wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bp-fbconnect. Download it 
and then manually install it on your site. (If you can’t recall how to do 
this, refer to Chapter 13.) Or, you can choose the Plugins menu on your 
WordPress dashboard, search for the plugin, and then install it using the 
instructions in Chapter 13.
 
 Before you activate any BuddyPress-related plugins, you need to make 
sure that the BuddyPress plugin is activated. If BuddyPress is not acti-
vated, any BuddyPress-related plugins you try to activate will cause 
errors and the activation will fail.
 
2. Activate the BP-FB Connect plugin.
 
 Click the Activate link on the Manage Plugins page on your WordPress 
dashboard to activate the plugin on your site.
 
3. Go to the Facebook Connect Plugin Options page.
 
 When the plugin is active, you see a Facebook Connect link in the 
Settings menu — click that link to load the Facebook Connect Plugin 
Options page on your WordPress dashboard. (See Figure 14-1.)
 
4. Read and follow the instructions on the Facebook Connect Plugin 
Options page.
 
 Or do the following:
 
a. Visit the Facebook application registration page by clicking that 
link on the Facebook Connect Plugin Options page.
 
 The Create Application page on the Facebook Web site appears 
at (http://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.
php?version=new).
 
b. On this page, type the name of your new application — for simplic-
ity’s sake, type the name of your Web site.
 
c. Indicate that you agree to Facebook’s terms of service, by select-
ing the Agree option under Terms, and then click the Save Changes 
button. (See Figure 14-2.)
 
 When you click the Save Changes button, the Edit page for your 
new application appears.

5. Copy the API Key and the Secret for your application.
 
 This information displays on the Edit page for your newly created appli-
cation, shown in Figure 14-3.
 
 Copy the API Key from the Facebook Edit application page and paste it 
into the API Key text box on the Facebook Connect Plugin Options page 
on your WordPress dashboard. (Refer to Figure 14-1).
 
6. Copy the Secret.
 
 Copy the Secret from the Facebook Edit application page and paste it 
into the Secret text box on the Facebook Connect Plugin Options page 
on your WordPress dashboard (Refer to Figure 14-1).
 
7. (Optional) Upload an image to use as an icon and logo for your appli-
cation on Facebook.
 
 On the Facebook Edit application page, you can upload images to use 
as an icon or logo for your application that appears in and around the 
Facebook social network site. Click the Change Your Icon link to upload 
a new icon image; and click the Change Your Logo link to upload a new 
logo image.
 
8. Save Changes on your Facebook application.
 
 On the Facebook Edit application page, click Save Changes at the bottom 
of the page to save your new application in your Facebook account.

9. Update the Facebook Connect Plugin Options.
 
 At the bottom of the Facebook Connect Plugin Options page on your 
WordPress dashboard, click the Update Options button to save your set-
tings, and you’re done.
 
After you follow the steps to update the Facebook Connect Plugin options, it 
might take Facebook a few minutes to collect your information and activate it. 
Wait 5–10 minutes before trying the new Facebook Connect plugin feature on 
your site, just to be sure that you’ve given Facebook time to make the neces-
sary changes for it to work.
With the BP-FB Connect plugin activated and set up, visitors to your site can 
easily register, log in, and begin using the features of your social community. 
Assuming you’re using the BuddyPress Default theme, a new Facebook icon 
appears at the top-right of your site. When a visitor clicks the Facebook icon, 
a Facebook login window pops up (shown in Figure 14-4), allowing the user to 
enter her Facebook login information to log in to your community. Your site 
is now connected with Facebook!

 Chapter 14: Integrating Popular Social Media
Integrating Twitter
Twitter (http:twitter.com) is a unique social community that allows 
users to communicate and connect with one another in messages of 140 
characters or less. (This type of communication is often referred to as micro-
blogging). Twitter members can send updates to the people following the 
member’s Twitter account that can include anything from what you had for 
breakfast to the latest and greatest stock tips — any message at all, really, as 
long as it’s at or under 140 characters in length. 
Sending short updates to 100 of your closest friends on the Web might seem 
a little funny to people who have not used the service. However, individuals 
and businesses — from average people communicating with others to com-
panies interacting with their client base to extend their reach — have discov-
ered real value in the service. In June 2009, Twitter was on the cover of TIME 
magazine with the headline “How Will Twitter Change the Way We Live.” The 
article revealed the depth of social interaction that the service has brought 
to millions of users.
The 140-character messages that Twitter users publish on the Twitter.com 
Web site are Tweets, or short updates. Soon after Twitter became popular, 
users wanted to see their Tweets show up in other areas of their social circle 
on the Web. You started seeing people publishing their latest Tweet on their 
blog and in their Facebook accounts, and through a bit of programming and 
code, developers began creating applications and scripts that made Tweets 
portable, allowing users to take their Tweets with them wherever they went 
on the Web.
In running a social community using WordPress and BuddyPress, it’s natural 
to want to allow your community members to bring their Twitter updates 
into their profiles within your community. With an easy-to-install plugin 
called BuddyPress Group Twitter, developed by Andy Peatling, you have the 
ability to give your users that feature by following these easy steps:
 
1. Navigate to the Plugins page in your WordPress Dashboard.
 
 Click the Add New link in the Plugins menu in your WordPress 
Dashboard and search for the BuddyPress Group Twitter plugin in the 
search form provided.
 
2. Install the BuddyPress Group Twitter plugin.
 
 Click the Install link to the right of the BuddyPress Group Twitter plugin 
title and then click the Install Now link in the plugin installation pop-up 
window.

238
Part V: Extending BuddyPress 
 
3. Activate the BuddyPress Group Twitter plugin.
 
 Click the Activate link displayed on the Installing Plugin: BuddyPress 
Group Twitter plugin page.
Now that the BuddyPress Group Twitter plugin is installed and functioning 
on your site, member Twitter accounts can be added to groups within the 
community by going to the Admin page of the group you’re the administrator 
of and adding Twitter accounts for the members of your group.
The ultimate goal of building a social Web is allowing users to create content 
within their communities, share the content, and take it with them wherever 
they go. The plugins I’ve listed provide a means of reaching that goal in your 
own social community. 
Additionally, future development of BuddyPress promises to bring in richer 
features and functions that will give you, and your users, numerous ways 
of sharing your content in and around the larger social Web. Have a peek 
at the Appendix in the back of this book for ways that you can keep up 
with BuddyPress developments, including using the bleeding edge, not-yet-
released beta versions of BuddyPress.

n Chapter 13, I provide you with information on where to find and down-
load BuddyPress plugins, and show you why you would want to add 
plugins to your BuddyPress community to extend its default features to do 
some really cool things. That chapter also walks you through how to install, 
activate, and use plugins on your site.
This chapter introduces you to ten BuddyPress plugins that I’ve installed on 
various BuddyPress communities and have found to be exciting additions 
to any social community. I want to share these with you so you can provide 
your community members with additional features that will make your com-
munity so attractive that they’ll never want to leave.
 
If these ten BuddyPress plugins aren’t enough for you, at the end of this chap-
ter I give you some great resources on where to find more plugins for your 
BuddyPress community.
 
This book is mainly about BuddyPress, not WordPress. Literally thousands of 
WordPress plugins can also add new functionality to your Web site. You can 
find WordPress plugins in the official WordPress Plugin Directory at http://
wordpress.org/extend/plugins, or visit the Plugins page on your 

242
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
WordPress Dashboard to search for and explore new WordPress plugins you 
can use. Many WordPress plugins exist that work well alongside BuddyPress 
and allow you to bring more social networking features to your site. When you 
search for plugins in the official WordPress Plugin Directory, use terms like 
social, social media, and BuddyPress to find new and interesting plugins for 
your social community site.
BuddyPress Privacy Component
Developer: Jeff Sayre
URL: http://jeffsayre.com/2009/12/05/buddypress-privacy-
component-released/ 
Almost every single person using the internet today is concerned about pri-
vacy issues; specifically who has access to their information.
Being a member of a BuddyPress community is no different — users within 
a BuddyPress community may, or may not, want everyone to have access to 
the information they share on their profiles, in groups.
With the BuddyPress Privacy Component plugin, users are able to define and 
control who has access to certain pieces of data they share in their profiles, 
activity streams, friends’ lists, blogs, private messaging, and more.
Featured Members Widget
Developer: Jeff Sayre
URL: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-
featured-members-widget
One of the advantages of being a member in any social community on the Web 
is the possibility that you’ll gain just a bit more exposure on the Internet than 
you would have had you not joined a community Web site. Whether your com-
munity has a focus on business or any other topic, you have the ability to spot-
light featured members in your community by adding the Featured Members 
Widget plugin to your BuddyPress-powered social community Web site.
After you install the Featured Members Widget, you can add it to your site on 
the Widgets page on the dashboard and start displaying featured community 
members immediately. Figure 15-1 illustrates how Tasty Kitchen (http://
tastykitchen.com) uses the Featured Members Widget to spotlight an 
individual member of their social community.

Author Avatar List
Developers: Benedikt Forchhammer and Paul Bearne
URL: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/author-avatars
The Author Avatar List allows you to display a list of member avatars (or 
pictures) on your Web site. This plugin also allows you to display a member’s 
avatar within a post or page, which is a great feature when you’re posting 
about a member because you can insert the member’s photo within the body 
of the post.
Using the Author Avatar List widget that comes with the plugin, you can dis-
play a configurable listing of user avatars on your community Web site. You 
can limit the number of avatars that display, adjust the size of the avatars, 
sort the list by name, display the list in random order, and change the avatar 
alignment to appear to the left, right, or center of the section you’re display-
ing the avatar(s) in.

244
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
BuddyPress Events Calendar
Developer: Erwin Gerrits
URL: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bp-events
The BuddyPress Events Calendar plugin adds an Events option to the user 
menu in each member’s profile, which allows you and your community mem-
bers to create events for other community members to view and join. This 
plugin also provides an Events item in the navigation menu of the main Web 
site so visitors to the site can see a full listing of events scheduled within 
your social community.
The BuddyPress Events Calendar plugin also provides you with a widget that 
gives you the option to display upcoming, newest, or active events within 
your community on your Web site.
This widget is very helpful within active communities that have scheduled 
events, conferences, Webinars, educational programming, or online chats.
BuddyPress Geo
Developer: Dale Mugford, Duane Storey
URL: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-geo
Google’s location feature, BuddyPress Geo, allows members of a BuddyPress 
social community to search for other members by geographical location. 
For example, say you live in Wisconsin and you want to find members within 
the community who live within a certain distance from you. You can search 
for members who live within 5, 10, 15, or 20 miles, or more, to connect with 
people who are local to your location.
 
You can search for, and install, this plugin by choosing Plugins➪Add New 
on your WordPress dashboard. Here’s a tip, however, do not activate it right 
away. Instead, after you install it with the built-in plugin installer, go to the 
Manage Plugins page by choosing Plugins➪Installed, find the BuddyPress Geo 
plugin in the list, and then click the Activate BuddyPress Geo Site Wide link. 
This activates the plugin site wide, rather than per user blog. Note: The plugin 
will not work if you do not activate it site wide.
To find options for the BuddyPress Geo plugin, choose BuddyPress➪
GeoSearch Setup on the WordPress dashboard. Figure 15-2 illustrates the Geo 
Search Setup page where you fill out the required information to complete 
the plugin’s setup.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) 
for BuddyPress
Developer: Sven Lehnert
URL: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-for-buddypress
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is something that every Web site owner 
should be concerned about. Search Engine Optimization helps make your 
Web site friendlier to the various search engines, such as Google, Yahoo!, 
or MSN. The easier the search engines can find and catalogue your content 
in their directories, the easier Internet surfers, like me, can find your site by 
searching with various keywords.
The SEO for BuddyPress plugin helps you improve the SEO of your 
BuddyPress community by giving you full control over the title, description, 
and keywords for each page within your BuddyPress community. 

246
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
After you install and activate the plugin, the SEO for BuddyPress option 
appears on the BuddyPress menu. Click that link to go to the SEO for 
BuddyPress Options page where you fill the Title, Description, and Keyword 
fields with keywords and phrases that you think will best help the search 
engines find and include your content within their topical directories.
BuddyPress/Facebook Connect
Developer: Andy Peatling, Adam Hupp
URL: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bp-fbconnect
This plugin adds the ability for your members, and potential or future 
members, to log in to your community with their Facebook account login. 
This is handy when someone who already has a Facebook account visits 
your community. They can use their Facebook login to log in to your com-
munity, as well, which prevents them from having to use your community’s 
built-in registration and log in process. Basically, the BuddyPress/Facebook 
Connect plugin makes logging in and participating in your community 
quicker and easier.
If a visitor doesn’t have a Facebook account, they can’t take advantage of this 
feature and will need to go through the sign-up and login process built into 
your community.
BuddyPress-Kaltura Media Component
Developer: Kaltura.org
URL: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-kaltura-
media-component
Give your community members the opportunity to upload and share photos, 
videos, and audio files with other members. The Kaltura Media Component 
plugin adds a My Media menu to the users’ profiles, as shown in Figure 15-3. 
In this menu, the user can choose to view and/or upload photos, videos, or 
audio files to their profile to share with the rest of the community.
This plugin not only allows users to upload media files from their own local 
computer, but also users can share media files from other social networks, 
such as Flickr, Photobucket, YouTube, and MySpace.

BuddyPress Stats
Developer: Jobjörn Folkesson
URL: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bp-community-blogs
Every Web site owner is at least a little curious about his or her Web site’s 
statistics. Knowing how many daily visitors a site has and where the traffic is 
coming from, at the very least, is interesting. In other cases, such as business 
sites and sites that offer advertising, Web site statistics can be very helpful in 
attracting new advertisers to your Web site, particularly when you can show 
that your Web site experiences high amounts of traffic.
The BuddyPress Stats plugin gives you stats on your BuddyPress community, 
including
 
✓ How many members, how many groups, and how much activity you 
have within your community.
 
✓ How many friends each member in your community has.

248
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Groups stats, including groups with the most active members.
 
✓ Activity stats, including which members have the most activity and what 
activity (blog posts, wire activity, and so on) is most prevalent in your 
community.
BuddyPress Welcome Pack
Developer: DJPaul
URL: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/welcome-pack
The Welcome Pack plugin gives the site administrator enhancements to add a 
customized welcome message for each new member of the BuddyPress com-
munity. Additionally, the plugin allows the site administrator to determine 
new member default items, such as
 
✓ A default friends list
 
✓ Membership in predetermined groups
Therefore, when new members join, they receive a friendly welcome message 
to your community, are members of active community groups, and have new 
friends to make them feel at home and help them get started.
Figure 15-4 shows you the administrative options for the BuddyPress 
Welcome Pack plugin.

ecause BuddyPress is relatively new to the scene, theme creation for 
it is just getting started. Soon, hundreds of BuddyPress themes will be 
available for you to download and use. BuddyPress development continues 
to make it easier for theme developers to design themes based on the parent/
child theme framework (which I discuss in Chapter 12), so new themes will 
be arriving all the time.
The listing of themes in this chapter is not exhaustive by any means, but 
does provide you with ten of the best themes that have already been cre-
ated for you. In Part IV of this book, I discuss themes in depth and help you 
understand the ins and outs of the BuddyPress theme framework, including 
the best ways to customize the default BuddyPress themes to make your own 
unique look. In Chapter 10, especially, I show you how to install a theme after 
you download it from the developer’s site.

Avenue K9
Theme designer: Michael Kuhlmann
URL: www.avenuek9.com/2009/09/18/new-avek9-bp-1-1-theme
The blues, greens, and yellows of this BuddyPress theme, built directly from 
the BuddyPress theme framework (see Chapter 12), make for a very cheery 
and bright color scheme. I installed and activated the Avenue K9 on my own 
BuddyPress community site, as shown in Figure 16-1.

theme
The BuddyPress Corporate theme is a sleek, professional looking theme that 
is suited perfectly for a small business Web site. In addition to its smooth 
design, the BuddyPress Corporate theme includes a menu that provides you 
with 12 color schemes to choose from. Figure 16-2 displays the default gray 
monochrome design of the BuddyPress Corporate theme.

Bruce
Theme designer: miloIIIVII 
URL: http://wp2.3oneseven.com
The Bruce BuddyPress theme has a clean layout with a minimalistic, mono-
chromatic color scheme. A clean, four-column layout enables you to display a 
lot of content on your Web site. The columns give the theme a magazine-like 
appearance, as shown in Figure 16-3.
 
Figure 16-3: 
The Bruce 
theme for 
BuddyPress.
 
Some of the highlights of the Bruce theme include
 
✓ A slider script that enables you to dynamically display a lot of content 
on the front page of your Web site without taking up a whole lot of room.
 
✓ Support for the various WordPress and BuddyPress widgets.
 
✓ An options menu in the WordPress dashboard that allows you to config-
ure how you would like to feature a variety of content on the front page 
of your community Web site.

255
 Chapter 16: Ten Free BuddyPress Themes 
BuddyPress Fun
Theme designer: James Farmer
URL: http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/buddypress-fun-theme
The BuddyPress Fun theme is a fully customizable, light-hearted theme for 
your WordPress MU/BuddyPress-powered community site. This theme gives 
you the choice of a dark color scheme, as shown in Figure 16-4, or a light 
color scheme.
Other display options include
 
✓ The ability to change the background color.
 
✓ The ability to add a graphic to use for a background.
 
✓ The ability to change the font style used throughout the site.
 
✓ The ability to upload and crop a logo to use in the header of your site’s 
pages.
 
✓ The ability to customize the CSS. (See Chapter 11 for information about 
editing CSS and basic CSS properties.)

Shouty
Theme designer: BuddyDress
URL: http://buddydress.com
The Shouty theme has a fresh and clean look, with a vivid light blue, orange, 
and white color scheme in a comfortable two-column layout. This theme 
takes into consideration all the details within a BuddyPress community site 
and is a nicely designed theme for any community on the Web. The Shouty 
theme is one of many themes provided by the folks at BuddyDress.com, fea-
tured later in this chapter.
BuddyPress Community
Theme designer: James Farmer
URL: http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/buddypress-community-
theme
The BuddyPress Community theme strives to make your BuddyPress-
powered community Web site look and feel like Ning.com (http://ning.
com), another popular social network.
The BuddyPress Community theme has a very sharp and clean look with a 
striking blue-and-white color scheme, making it a bright and cheery place for 
you and your community members.
As with James’s other BuddyPress theme, the BuddyPress Fun theme, 
you can
 
✓ Change the background color.
 
✓ Add a graphic to use for a background.
 
✓ Change the font style used throughout the site.
 
✓ Upload and crop a logo to use in the header of your site’s pages.
 
✓ Customize the CSS. (See Chapter 11 for information about editing CSS 
and basic CSS properties.)
This theme comes with two color options: blue and red. Figure 16-5 shows 
the blue option.

Purple & Black
Theme designer: Christina Milburn
URL: http://theeasybutton.com/blog/2009/06/01/buddypress-
theme-purple-black
This BuddyPress theme is exactly what the title states: purple and black! 
Christina, the designer, changed the BuddyPress Default theme’s color 
scheme from orange and gray to present a striking color combination.
This theme, like the BuddyPress Default theme, is fully widgetized and com-
patible with all WordPress and BuddyPress widgets. Check out Chapter 9 to 
discover the wonder of widgets, including how you can use them to display 
different types of content and activities within your community.

258
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
MuddyPress
Theme Designer: Nagapress
URL: www.blogcastor.com/muddypress-theme
MuddyPress is a theme that plays off the BuddyPress Default theme with a 
few added options and differences, including
 
✓ Premium features that enable you to manage your theme’s options 
(such as uploading and adding a new logo to your Web site) on your 
WordPress dashboard.
 
✓ Photoshop software by Adobe. The designer of this theme included the 
Photoshop files to help you easily create a new logo for your site.
 
✓ A clean, three-column design that gives you lots of room to display your 
Web site content and community activities.
New Yorker
Themes designer: miloIIIVII
URL: http://wp.3oneseven.com/
This is a theme created for a WordPress MU site with BuddyPress added 
for the social community layer. The theme is laid out in a magazine-style 
format with the content (articles, blog posts, and so on) taking center stage. 
Contents are arranged by category/topic rather than by the usual chronologi-
cal arrangement. The design of the theme looks and feels very much like a 
magazine with large photos and striking typography. Figure 16-6 shows the 
front page of the New Yorker theme. By miloIIIVII.
BuddyPress Default Theme
No chapter on free BuddyPress themes would be complete without the 
mention of the BuddyPress Default theme and framework, provided for you 
within the BuddyPress suite of plugins. The Default theme, designed by Andy 
Peatling, the lead developer of the BuddyPress project, is provided for you 
to start running your BuddyPress-powered social community right out of the 
box, without having to worry about theme compatibility.

259
 Chapter 16: Ten Free BuddyPress Themes 
 
Figure 16-6: 
The New 
Yorker 
BuddyPress 
theme.
 
Because this theme works off the main theme framework, the BuddyPress 
Default theme is fully customizable. The parent theme framework contains 
all of the core code and programming that allow your BuddyPress theme to 
do its thing — the BuddyPress Default theme is just a Cascading Style Sheet 
(CSS) with some images to make everything look nice. I discuss parent/child 
themes in Chapter 12, so check that out if you require more information.
The advantage here is that you can now create an unlimited amount of 
themes by altering the CSS and changing the images, without having to be a 
certified code geek to make it happen. Chapter 11 takes you through some 
basic steps and CSS concepts that help you customize the BuddyPress 
Default theme. This setup makes customizing themes for BuddyPress really 
easy, without the complication of having to know the underlying PHP code. 
It’s all done for you in the parent theme.
Brilliant!
The Future of BuddyPress Themes
BuddyPress recently released a major upgrade (September 2009) that intro-
duced the parent/child theme framework, which makes the design process 
easier. This should mean that more and more designers will release themes 
for the BuddyPress community soon.
Keep your eye on the official BuddyPress Web site for announcements 
on new BuddyPress themes, specifically at http://buddypress.org/

S
ince mid-2008, when BuddyPress hit the scene, some amazing examples 
of WordPress-powered sites with added BuddyPress social community 
components have launched on the Web. This chapter shows you ten shining 
examples of BuddyPress implementations in the wild so that you can see, 
from a visitor’s standpoint, how BuddyPress social communities look and 
function. Feel free to visit any of these sites and sign up as a member to gain 
a community member’s perspective!

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
BuddyPress
http://buddypress.org
The best example and implementation of the BuddyPress platform is the 
official BuddyPress site. BuddyPress.org is a Web property owned by 
Automattic, the company behind the very popular WordPress.com.
BuddyPress.org has developed a community of BuddyPress users where you 
can create member profiles, connect with other BuddyPress users, and par-
ticipate in various BuddyPress user groups and forums. On BuddyPress.org, 
you will find a wealth of information and resources on the use and implemen-
tation of the BuddyPress platform and all of its features and options.
Also on the BuddyPress Web site is a BuddyPress demo (http://testbgp.
org) where members can give BuddyPress a test drive. (See Figure 17-1.) 
You can create a membership, kick the tires a bit, and test all the features 
that your community members will have available to them after you add 
BuddyPress to your WordPress-powered Web site.

Nourish Network
http://nourishnetwork.com
Nourish Network is a social community for people who love food, love to cook, 
and love to do it in an eco-friendly way. On the community’s front page, the 
various articles (blog posts) appear within a handy tabbed box. The front page 
also pulls in a few BuddyPress components by displaying the site owner, site 
contributors, and status updates from profile pages — as well as the Group 
Forums in a box labeled “What’s The Buzz?”, which draws special attention to 
the conversations happening within Nourish Networks community.
Figure 17-2 displays the front page of Nourish Network, while Figure 17-3 
shows you how the individual Member profile pages look.

WeEarth
http://weearth.com
WeEarth is an online community of individuals who share their passion for 
“creativity, collaboration, and the urgent need for a sustainable society, with 
the ultimate goal to unveil the truth and reinvent what it means to be con-
nected.” (See Figure 17-4.)
I have to issue a small disclaimer and say that I was directly involved in the 
design and development of the WeEarth WordPress/BuddyPress project. To 
create the community, I built the foundation using the WordPress multiple 
blog option that allows WeEarth members to create individual member blogs 
within the community. I followed that with the implementation of a much-
customized BuddyPress theme that encompasses Members, Blogs, and 
Groups directories, as well as individual member profiles, group pages, and 
activity streams.

The WeEarth community also has a Commerce section where they host a 
store and sell organic products. This was accomplished by adding the Shopp 
WordPress plugin and applying a fully customized design to the WeEarth 
shop.
WeEarth launched in July 2009 and has a very active membership of more 
than 485 members and counting.
We Heart This
http://weheartthis.com
They say it right on the top of their Web site: We Heart This is a community 
of chicks who love stuff. Built with the WordPress multiple blog option and 
BuddyPress to power the social community, We Heart This hosts a large net-
work of mainly women who share ideas, deals, links, and passions on shop-
ping, fashion, and beauty. (See Figure 17-5.)

266
Part VI: The Part of Tens

I was involved in the design and development of this community. In July 2008, 
shortly after BuddyPress made a big splash on the Web, the We Heart This 
ladies asked me to help them develop a full-blown social community that 
had Facebook-like features. Since then, I’ve helped them upgrade the various 
plugins and platforms on their Web site to keep the software (WordPress MU 
and BuddyPress) and their various plugins that power their community up to 
date and running smoothly.
In addition to member blogs, profiles, and groups, We Heart This has a dis-
cussion forum that uses the bbPress software (http://bbpress.org).
GigaOM Pro
http://pro.gigaom.com
GigaOM Pro is a Web site that addresses “the gap that exists in real-time 
expert industry analysis on emerging technology markets.” GigaOM Pro gives 
you expert insights and inside information on technology markets without 
the huge price tag that you’d usually expect for expert insider advice and 
analysis. (See Figure 17-6.)

267
 Chapter 17: Ten Real World Examples of BuddyPress
GigaOM Pro offers memberships for $79.00. This is a great example of a Web 
site utilizing a combination of the WordPress and BuddyPress platforms to 
provide paid content and memberships. GigaOM Pro is an excellent example 
of how to accomplish this very popular business model with BuddyPress.
To give their site a dynamic feel, GigaOM Pro also integrates several popular 
WordPress features, such as:
 
✓ Featured content areas that spotlight content they feel is important to 
feature on the top of the front page.
 
✓ Multiple blogs that focus on topical information.
 
✓ Categorical display of content by topic rather than by date. This method 
of content delivery helps readers easily find the content they want to 
find because the content is sorted by topic.
 
✓ Easy subscription and online payment methods make it super easy for 
members to register for GigaOM Pro.

Flokka
http://flokka.com
Flokka.com uses WordPress and BuddyPress to deliver a social community 
focusing on women in the business world who use blogs to promote their 
products and services. Members of the Flokka community can add existing 
blogs, as well as create new blogs, on the Flokka Web site. Flokka showcases 
these blogs and members’ business information as a membership benefit. 
(See Figure 17-7.)
Flokka uses their community to give individuals a platform to network and 
enter into conversations with other members about business-to-business 
services and products. Flokka also regularly features members and member 
blogs to promote them through the use of a Featured Members and Featured 
Blog widget that displays one member and blog at a time on their front page 
to put them center stage.

Unstructure
http://unstructure.org
Unstructure brilliantly uses the WordPress and BuddyPress platforms to 
create a community for business professionals, bloggers, and thought leaders 
to “discuss and debate action ideas that would aid the evolution of business.” 
(See Figure 17-8.)
The goal of Unstructure is to provide their community members a place to be 
heard, to teach, to learn, and to connect with one another. Unstructure pro-
vides these features to their members by using the BuddyPress platform.
The community members of Unstructure openly debate issues that face busi-
ness professionals.

Young People
http://young-people.ch/home
Young People is a Web community for young people written in the German 
language, but even if you can’t read German, the customized design and 
implementation of the WordPress and BuddyPress platform is so excellent I 
felt I had to include it here! (See Figure 17-9.)
Young People is a portal of information and community for youth on the 
Web. Their goal is to provide resources, media tips, and information, and to 
be a great place for young people to gather, share, and connect.
In addition to the usual community aspects of member profiles, groups, 
forums, and private mailings, Young People also provides their members the 
ability to create their own blogs and operate their own Web sites with the 
best free tools on the Web: WordPress and BuddyPress.

VW TankWars
http://tdi.vw.com
Want to know all there is to know about TDI clean diesel fuel? The 
Volkswagen car company thought you might, so they used the WordPress/
BuddyPress platforms to put together a fabulous Web site and social com-
munity to discuss the truths, myths, and facts about TDI clean diesel fuel and 
TDI clean diesel vehicles. (See Figure 17-10.)
According to the VW Tank Wars site, the VW Jetta set a Guinness World 
Record for cleanest EPA ratings in 2009. VW is inviting you to join the site 
and share the miles per gallon of your TDI diesel vehicle as a challenge to 
their Web community to meet or beat the current Guinness World Record. 
This is a very effective way for a large corporation to use WordPress and 
BuddyPress to bring their customers together.
The VW Tank Wars Web site invites people to create a profile, using a 
BuddyPress plugin called Facebook Connect. (See Chapter 15.) This plugin 
allows people to log in to the VW Tank Wars site with their Facebook login 
rather than creating a new login. Once connected, members can create pro-
files and participate in the discussions on the site.

Tasty Kitchen
Tasty Kitchen is a well-designed implementation of WordPress and 
BuddyPress that invites its community members to connect with one 
another, share cooking tips, and search for recipes. Tasty Kitchen is a com-
munity of people who love food and love to cook. I have to admit, this is my 
kind of place! (See Figure 17-11.)
Tasty Kitchen happily invites you to “submit a recipe and join the fraternal 
order of the mitt!” Members can submit recipes to include on the main Tasty 
Kitchen site or just the Recipe Box section of their own member profile. 
Community members can rate other members’ recipes, and members can 
search recipes by title, type, and rating. I just stick to searching for recipes. If 
I added any recipes of my own, I’m sure they’d be among the lowest rated — 
just ask my husband.

Appendix
Cutting Edge BuddyPress
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping up with the fast-paced development of BuddyPress
▶ Using BuddyPress Trac
▶ Creating a test environment
▶ Downloading and using nightly builds
▶ Upgrading your BuddyPress
O
ne piece of advice that I give to BuddyPress users when they’re starting 
out is this: Know what you’re getting into. BuddyPress hit the scene in 
2008 with a raw beta version of the software that was more conceptual than 
it was useful. This is what they call ‘bleeding edge’ in the software world — 
meaning, that version of BuddyPress wasn’t stable at the time and was prone 
to bugs and flaws. In 2009, the stable version that we know and love today 
was released with much fanfare. Around that time, people began putting 
BuddyPress to good use, and the BuddyPress project began to grow by leaps 
and bounds.
BuddyPress, much like the WordPress project, is a living and breathing 
platform. Programmers and developers work every day to improve the 
existing programming and to add new features and components. Because 
BuddyPress is in constant development, the development team actually 
listens to its user base for new feature requests and bug reports. The one 
downside is that users sometimes find the development process arduous 
and difficult to keep up with. New developments come quickly, and some-
times it can feel like you’re constantly upgrading to a new version of the 
software just to stay current.
In this chapter, you discover how to keep yourself up-to-date on the happen-
ings within the BuddyPress development community. You also explore how 
to use and test the nightly builds, or beta versions, of the software in a test 
environment, and perhaps even participate in the bug-testing process. Lastly, 
I reveal important steps and tips on upgrading your existing BuddyPress 
installation.

274
BuddyPress For Dummies 
Staying in the Know
Committing yourself, and your Web site, to the use of the BuddyPress platform 
to run your social community brings with it a certain responsibility to remain 
informed and updated on the latest BuddyPress features, flaws, bugs, and 
upgrade releases. I refer to this as a responsibility because after you decide to 
invite members to your site and use all the great BuddyPress features, those 
members will expect you to keep the site as up-to-date, safe, flaw-free, and fea-
ture-rich as you possibly can. With BuddyPress, you’re not just running a Web 
site on your own; your site is a community effort. The content created by your 
members helps create the greatness of your Web site.
Staying up-to-date with the development of the BuddyPress platform might 
seem daunting, but this section de-mystifies it for you and shows that it’s 
easy to take a few minutes out of your day to keep yourself informed.
Subscribe to BuddyPress.Org
The official Web site for the BuddyPress platform can be found at http://
buddypress.org. There, on the official BuddyPress blog, you can find 
the latest announcements about new version releases of the BuddyPress 
software. Andy Peatling, the lead developer of the BuddyPress project, is 
extremely good about updating the BuddyPress blog when new upgrades 
become available. For the Twitter users out there, you can also subscribe 
to the official BuddyPress Twitter feed to stay updated (see Figure A-1) 
because BuddyPress also announce upgrade news on their Twitter account 
at http://twitter.com/buddypressdev (or @buddypressdev).
These upgrade announcements include:
 
✓ Highlights of the new upgrade
 
✓ Any new features introduced into the BuddyPress software
 
✓ Explanations of any bug fixes from previous versions
 
✓ Advice and tips on upgrading your current version of BuddyPress to the 
newest one available.
Using your favorite RSS feed reader, such as Google Reader or Bloglines, 
you can easily subscribe to the RSS feed at BuddyPress.Org so that you 
receive updates when BuddyPress update their blog with information you 
need to know.
 
In addition to subscribing to the BuddyPress site using your own, preferred 
RSS feed reader — RSS feed updates from the BuddyPress Web site also 
appear on your WordPress dashboard in the Other WordPress News box, as 
shown in Figure A-2.

Browsing BuddyPress forums
Among the other helpful parts of the BuddyPress.Org Web site is the Forum 
Listing at http://buddypress.org/forums (shown in Figure A-3). Spend 
a bit of time browsing the discussions and posts within the Forum Listing and 
you’ll find a wealth of information. Within the forums, you can find a wide 
array of users of the BuddyPress platform ranging from brand new (novice) 
users to the advanced-level, lead developers. Here people share their expe-
riences, offer tips and advice, and try hard to help one another toward the 
mutual goal of using BuddyPress to grow their own social community on 
their Web site.
The discussion forums at BuddyPress.Org cover a variety of topics that you 
can search through to find helpful tips and information, including:
 
✓ Installation: Help for the initial steps of installing BuddyPress on your 
Web site.
 
✓ Troubleshooting: Tips and advice on troubleshooting any problems you 
experience after you install BuddyPress.

✓ Extending: Information about new themes and plugins that you can use 
in tandem with BuddyPress to add new features to your Web site.
 
✓ Requests: Where you can give your great ideas for new features directly 
to the BuddyPress developers.
 
✓ Third Party Plugins: Where you can discover new plugins for 
BuddyPress, as well as read about, and participate in discussions relat-
ing to upcoming plugin development.
 
✓ Gallery: Where designers and developers show off the work they’ve 
done with BuddyPress on their, and others’, Web sites. This area of the 
forum can give you some great inspiration!
 
✓ General/Miscellaneous: An area of the forum that doesn’t quite fit into 
any of the categories and topics I’ve already mentioned.
Chances are, if you’re experiencing problems with your BuddyPress instal-
lation, or have a question about it, someone else has already had the same 
problem or question. A good rule of thumb for using the forums on the 
BuddyPress Web site is to take full advantage of the search feature at the top 
of the forum section. Using keywords and phrases, the search feature allows 
you to search for topics already discussed about the particular issue you are 
having a problem with. You might be able to solve the problem, or answer 
your own question, by reading the experiences shared by other forum users.
 
A fantastic feature in the forums at the BuddyPress Web site is that each topic 
you find there has an RSS feed that you can subscribe to. This gives you the 
ability to follow a topic you’re interested in and receive updates whenever 
someone adds to that topic. Figure A-4 shows the Help Installing BP topic in 
the BuddyPress forums. Notice the small, orange RSS icon to the right of the 
forum topic title. Click the icon to subscribe to the topic in your favorite RSS 
feed reader (like Google Reader or Bloglines).
When you use the forums at BuddyPress.Org to request support from users 
or developers, you should keep a few things in mind:
 
✓ Provide the user or developer the numbers of the WordPress MU and 
BuddyPress versions you are using. This information helps troubleshoot 
version-specific problems.
 
✓ Let the user or developer know if you are using WordPress MU with 
subdomains or subdirectories. (See Chapter 3 for information on subdo-
mains versus subdirectories.) This information helps troubleshoot prob-
lems due to your WordPress MU configuration.
 
✓ Provide the user or developer a list of any plugins that you’ve installed 
on your site. This might clear up possible plugin compatibility issues or 
known conflicts that might be occurring.

✓ Give the user or developer information on the theme you’re using on 
your BuddyPress-powered site. Are you using the BuddyPress Default 
theme with no alterations, a customized, modified version of the 
BuddyPress Default theme, or something else? This information can be 
vital in troubleshooting problems you might be experiencing.
 
✓ Provide the user or developer information on any other software or 
scripts that you’re running on your Web site. Insight on this might help 
others assist you with your problem, but also its just good information 
to know.
 
✓ Be willing to answer more questions, provide additional information, 
and be patient. Not all problems with software like WordPress and 
BuddyPress are immediately apparent; sometimes, additional informa-
tion is required to help pin down a possible solution for your particular 
problem.
You might not find answers or solutions for every problem you post to the 
BuddyPress forums. You might very well discover a new bug in the program. 
If that’s the case, BuddyPress has a handy Report a Bug button in the forums 
that takes you to the BuddyPress Trac Web site (http://trac.buddy
press.org), which I cover in the next section.

 Appendix: Cutting Edge BuddyPress
Browsing and using BuddyPress Trac
Several open source software programs, such as WordPress and BuddyPress, 
use an interface called Trac (http://trac.edgewall.org) to keep track of 
their software development. Trac provides many features to software devel-
opers that users don’t need to be aware of. However, browsing and using the 
BuddyPress Trac at http://trac.buddypress.org (shown in Figure A-5) 
does offer advantages to non-developers:
 
✓ Timeline: Click the Timeline link to view a timeline of events that have 
occurred in the development of BuddyPress. This includes tickets, bug 
reports, and bug resolutions, and provides the identity of the developer 
responsible for resolving the reported problems and bugs.
 
✓ Roadmap: Click the Roadmap link to view items that are under devel-
opment for future versions of BuddyPress. This is a great way to stay 
informed about upcoming features, including whether a bug is sched-
uled to be fixed, when, and in which version.
 
✓ View Tickets: Click the View Tickets link to browse every submitted or 
resolved ticket throughout the development of BuddyPress. This includes 
tickets with issues and problems that have not yet been resolved.
 
Figure A-5: 
BuddyPress 
Trac.
 

280
BuddyPress For Dummies 
 
✓ New Ticket: Click the New Ticket link to submit your own ticket by pro-
viding an explanation of a bug that you experienced. To submit a ticket, 
you need to register on the BuddyPress Trac site, but registering has its 
benefits: It’s a great way to contribute to the development of future ver-
sions of BuddyPress. You don’t have to be a coding genius in order to 
contribute!
 
✓ Browse Source: Click the Browse Source link to view the source code of 
the files that make up the BuddyPress software. You can browse older 
versions, if you want to, but the good stuff is in the Trunk directory. The 
Trunk directory contains the absolute latest and greatest, cutting-edge 
version of the BuddyPress software. The files in the Trunk directory are 
the latest nightly builds, or beta versions. I describe using nightly builds 
and beta versions in a test environment in the upcoming “Downloading 
and Using Nightly Builds” section.
You can see there’s a lot of browsing around, reading, and snooping to be 
done in the BuddyPress Trac so that you can stay informed and find out 
what’s coming in future versions of BuddyPress. This information helps site 
owners plan the best ways to grow their communities. By knowing what new 
features are coming, you can build excitement and anticipation among your 
community members about upcoming features. By staying informed on the 
intended schedule of BuddyPress version releases, you can also plan your 
strategy for upgrading your site and keeping it fresh and new.
Setting Up a Test Environment
Something that helps me a great deal when I work with platforms that change 
as quickly as WordPress and BuddyPress is creating a test environment where 
I can install and run beta versions of the software. In a test environment, work-
ing with new features before they release to the public in an official version 
upgrade can be highly beneficial. The advantages of doing this include
 
✓ Becoming adept at using new features so that when you upgrade your 
site, you’re informed enough to advise your users.
 
✓ The opportunity to install and test new plugins or themes before you 
commit to making those changes on your site.
 
✓ Testing early, beta versions of BuddyPress to help discover bugs and 
then using the BuddyPress Trac to report any problems. As I men-
tion earlier, you don’t have to be a programmer to contribute to the 
BuddyPress project; you can be a tester and help the developers and 
programmers fix issues for BuddyPress users worldwide.
There are several ways to create a test environment, and every one’s mileage 
will vary on how they prefer to create one. The steps I take to create a test 
environment of my own are probably the easiest for you:

281
 Appendix: Cutting Edge BuddyPress
 
1. Find out whether your hosting provider gives you the ability to create 
subdomains.
 
 Generally, most hosting providers give you this option. I use the cPanel 
hosting account manager to create this subdomain, but your hosting 
account might offer you a different management tool, such as NetAdmin 
or Plesk.
 
 A subdomain is the second level of your current domain that can 
handle unique content separately than content in your main domain. 
Subdomains operate underneath your main domain, and can function as 
a wholly different section of your site, independent from your existing 
domain name.
 
 For an example of a subdomain on my domain, ewebscapes.com, see 
steps 3 and 4 where I create the subdomain http://testing.eweb
scapes.com. The prefix testing in that Web address (or URL) is a 
subdomain that branches off ewebscapes.com that, when set up, han-
dles completely different content than content currently installed on my 
main domain.
 
2. Log in to your cPanel (or hosting account manager tool provided to 
you).
 
3. Locate and then click the Subdomains icon in the cPanel interface.
 
 The Subdomains page within cPanel appears, as shown in Figure A-6.
 
Figure A-6: 
The 
Subdomains 
page in 
cPanel 
where you 
can create 
a new 
subdomain.
 

282
BuddyPress For Dummies 
 
4. Type the name of your subdomain in the Subdomain text box.
 
 For the purposes of making this straightforward and easy, type testing 
in the text box.
 
5. On the drop-drop menu, choose the name of the domain on which you 
want to add the subdomain.
 
 In Figure A-6, the drop-down menu shows the domain ewebscapes.
com. I’m creating the subdomain on this domain, so my new subdomain 
is http://testing.ewebscapes.com.
 
 A unique folder name for your new subdomain appears in the Document/
Root text box. Don’t alter this text because this tells your Web server 
where to install the necessary WordPress and BuddyPress files.
 
6. Click the Create button.
 
 It takes a few seconds, but the page refreshes and displays a message 
that the new subdomain has been created, as shown in Figure A-7.
 
Figure A-7: 
Successful 
subdomain 
creation 
message in 
cPanel.
 
Now that you have a subdomain set up on your hosting account, you can 
install WordPress MU and BuddyPress into the folder that was created when 
you added the subdomain. For example, if you created a subdomain called 

283
 Appendix: Cutting Edge BuddyPress
testing, then the folder on your Web server you’ll install into will be the 
/testing/ folder. For the steps to install WordPress MU and BuddyPress on 
your subdomain, refer to Chapters 2, 3, and 4.
 
Before going forward and installing WordPress MU and BuddyPress in 
your new test environment, read through the next section of this chapter 
to find out where to find the latest beta versions (or nightly builds) of the 
BuddyPress software because that is the version you want to install on your 
test environment so you can, well . . . test it!
Downloading and Using Nightly Builds
You can get your hands on the latest nightly build of the BuddyPress soft-
ware several ways, but in this section, I’m going to give you the easiest way. 
It isn’t the fastest way, but for non-techy types, it’s the most sure-fire way to 
get the latest development version of the platform.
 
When I refer to nightly builds, what I am referring to is the latest development 
work that the BuddyPress developers have added to the source. Nightly 
builds are available only through the official BuddyPress site, and are not con-
sidered safe for public use. People use nightly builds for testing purposes and 
site development planning, not for use on live sites because these builds gen-
erally contain bugs or vulnerabilities that still need to be fleshed out and fixed 
before the next, official version of BuddyPress is released.
To find a Zip file of today’s latest BuddyPress development version, follow 
these quick steps:
 
1. Visit the BuddyPress Trac at http://trac.buddypress.org.
 
2. Click the Browse Source link in the navigation menu.
 
 This opens the Root directory in the BuddyPress Trac.
 
3. Click the Trunk directory.
 
 The BuddyPress Trac displays a full listing of files available in this latest 
build of BuddyPress, as shown in Figure A-8.
 
4. Click the Zip Archive link.
 
 If you don’t see this link, scroll all the way to the bottom of the page. 
Clicking Zip Archive opens a dialog box that allows you to save the Zip 
version of the BuddyPress files on your local computer.

284
BuddyPress For Dummies 
 
Figure A-8: 
The Root/
Trunk direc-
tory in the 
BuddyPress 
Trac.
 
 
5. Install WordPress MU on the subdomain you’re using for your test 
environment.
 
 If you need instructions on installing WordPress MU on your test envi-
ronment subdomain, see Chapter 2.
 
6. Install the BuddyPress nightly build that you downloaded from the 
BuddyPress Trac.
 
 If you need instructions on manually installing BuddyPress, see Chapter 3.
 
7. Finish setting up and configuring BuddyPress on your new test 
environment.
 
 If you need the steps and configuration information to finish setting up 
BuddyPress on your test environment subdomain, see Chapter 4.
You now have WordPress MU and the latest nightly build of BuddyPress 
installed and setup on a test environment on a subdomain of your hosting 
account. With this environment, you are free to test new features or try out 
new plugins or themes before you make any changes to your main, public 
site. Having this environment also gives you the ability to test new develop-
ment and provide BuddyPress developers feedback on their latest work.

285
 Appendix: Cutting Edge BuddyPress
 
You might have heard about another method of obtaining the nightly builds 
of the latest BuddyPress development called SVN, or Subversion. SVN is a 
higher-tech way of downloading and installing the BuddyPress files to your 
Web server and requires that you have access to a Subversion program, such 
as Tortoise SVN for the PC. Because the use of SVN is somewhat complex, I 
provide you only with the easiest way to obtain the files and do not cover 
SVN. However, if you feel brave and are curious about SVN, check out the 
informative article that appears in the WordPress Codex at http://codex.
wordpress.org/Using_Subversion, which includes resources on using 
an SVN client and other helpful information for using SVN.
Having a test environment is not necessary, but I recommend it for site 
owners who are serious about maintaining a BuddyPress community on their 
own sites, for the various reasons I mention in this chapter.
Upgrading BuddyPress
When BuddyPress releases an official upgrade, you need to be armed with 
best practices for upgrading BuddyPress on your site. To keep you informed 
about newly released upgrades, your WordPress MU dashboard alerts you 
when a new version of BuddyPress is ready and waiting for you to download. 
So if you paid no attention to any of the resources that I provide in this chap-
ter, you’ll still stay informed about newly released upgrades. It’s foolproof, 
really!
When a new version of BuddyPress or a plugin upgrade is available, you see 
a bright red circle in the Plugins menu on your WordPress dashboard. The 
number in the red circle gives you an indication of how many of your plugins 
have upgrades available. As shown in Figure A-9, the indicator tells me that I 
have 1 plugin upgrade available.
Click Plugins to go to the Manage Plugins page. There you see an alert 
directly beneath the BuddyPress plugin listing that a new version of 
BuddyPress is available. (See Figure A-10.)
Do not click the Upgrade Automatically link right way. Instead, follow these 
few steps to ensure a safe and smart upgrade to your BuddyPress plugin:
 
1. Deactivate the current version of BuddyPress on your site.
 
 Click the Deactivate link beneath the BuddyPress plugin title to deacti-
vate the BuddyPress plugin. The Manage Plugins page reloads, indicat-
ing that the BuddyPress plugin is deactivated.

286

2. Deactivate any additional plugins that require BuddyPress.
 
 Any other plugins you might have installed that require BuddyPress also 
need to be deactivated at this time.
 
3. Upgrade BuddyPress.
 
 Click the Upgrade Automatically link beneath the BuddyPress plugin 
title on the Manage Plugins page. This loads the Upgrade Plugin page 
where you see a series of messages alerting you that the newest version 
of BuddyPress is being downloaded, unpacked, installed, and upgraded.
 
4. Reactivate BuddyPress.
 
 Click the Activate Plugin link on the Upgrade Plugin page, as shown 
in Figure A-11. This takes you to the Manage Plugins page where 
BuddyPress is showing as an activated plugin.
Your BuddyPress installation is the latest version, and you’re ready to share 
all the new features and fixes in this latest version with your entire member 
community. Congratulations!
