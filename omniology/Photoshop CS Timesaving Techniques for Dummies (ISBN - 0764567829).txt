Introduction
W
elcome to the incredible world of Photoshop! I use this program
every day and it never ceases to amaze me. Photoshop is like
one of those “learn a new word every day” calendars. I always
discover something new about Photoshop every time I use it, even if it’s
just a keyboard shortcut that makes things go quicker or a different
approach to solving a sticky problem.
Photoshop CS Timesaving Techniques For Dummies is jam packed with ideas
and information. Whether you’re familiar with Photoshop and want to find
out more or you know a lot about Photoshop and you’re looking for new
ideas, these pages have something for everyone.
Saving Time with This Book
Photoshop CS Timesaving Techniques For Dummies focuses on high-payoff
techniques that help you get the job done. Although a technique may take 
time when you first use it, after you’ve got the steps under your belt, it
saves you time down the road.
This book gets to the point in a hurry with an easy-to-use, two-column
format and step-by-step instructions that speed you through the tasks
you need to do. I don’t spend any time on extra talk or irrelevant explana-
tions. The 64 techniques zero in on key Photoshop features that you can
use to work faster and smarter, not harder.
In Photoshop CS Timesaving Techniques For Dummies, you can find out
how to

Bam! Take your skills up a notch: You’re already familiar with the
basics of using Photoshop. Now use this book to take your skills to the
next level.

version of Photoshop. Bear in mind, however,
that if you aren’t running Photoshop CS, some of
the features that I explain here might not be
available to you. For instance, the History
palette, which I use in Techniques 7 and 25, was
introduced in Photoshop version 6. Layer Comps,
which I discuss in Technique 16, were introduced
with CS.
If you’re using a previous version, you can find
out what your version includes (and what it
doesn’t) by choosing Help➪Photoshop. Click
the Index link and then click the letter P. Scroll
down the list of P topics until you reach
Photoshop Format. Click the link next to
About(1).

You have a good basic knowledge of Photoshop
and want to find out more. What does this mean?
Well, this book doesn’t hold your hand and tell
you to choose File➪Save when you need to save
something. Instead, it takes you step by step
through some very cool effects, showing you
just what you need to do. And, after you’ve done
something once, the second time is certainly eas-
ier and faster.
Conventions Used in This Book
I’m not too conventional (what writer/Photoshop
artist/scuba diver/tap dancer is?), so I’m not a great
one for setting conventions. However, to get us all on
a level playing field, I came up with a few items for
consistency. They include:

Command keys: You press the command keys in
combinations to activate commands — Shift,
Ctrl, and Alt for Windows, and Shift, Ô, Alt, and
Control for Mac. When using control keys in this
book, I list the Windows version first followed by
a backslash and then the Mac version. So, if I tell
you to copy a layer with command keys, it
appears like this: Ctrl+J/Ô+J.

Tame time-consuming tasks: Do you need to per-
form the same command over and over? Don’t
drive yourself batty; make it easy by creating a
custom keyboard shortcut or action. From there,
you can quickly batch process files by using the
custom action. Let Photoshop do the work for
you — you’re in the driver’s seat.

Print your projects right the first time: Printing
at home or in the office can be a frustrating
process. Preparing images for high-end commer-
cial presses can be a nightmare — but it doesn’t
have to be that way. Wake up, sit back, and have
a latte. This book shows you the ins and outs of
printing one step at a time.

Create tool presets: If you’re working under a
deadline, you don’t need to be fiddling with tool
settings. Create the tool settings you need at the
beginning of a project and save them in a custom
library. Then you’ll have the tools that you need
with the right settings anytime.

Expand Photoshop’s capabilities: Installing plug-
ins, third-party software, or downloading tool
presets or actions from the Web can save you
oodles of time. If you need to do something in
Photoshop, chances are that someone has done
it before. Where relevant, I list Web sites that you
can go to and third-party software products that
you can use to find the solutions that you need.
Basic Assumptions
Here’s where I get silly and start making assump-
tions about you even though I’ve never met you. The
following are some of my basic assumptions about
you, dear reader:

You have a Mac or Windows computer. You are
familiar with the computer, and you can navigate
around through dialog boxes and menus without
getting hung up.

Your computer is running Photoshop. Although
this book was written for Photoshop CS, you can
use this book if you’re working with a previous

Drop-down lists versus pop-up menus: Menus
that appear when a button or arrow is clicked
are known as drop-down lists in Windows and
pop-up menus on the Mac. Instead of bogging
you down with terminology throughout the book
and writing “Choose the Widget item from the
drop-down list/pop-up menu,” I made a blanket
decision to call this feature a drop-down list.
After all, these menus do appear to drop down
more often than they pop up.

New terms are italicized: When I introduce a
new term or concept, it first appears in italics.
After the italics is a quick definition explaining
exactly what the italicized term means.

Filenames, paths, and Web addresses are set in
monospace font: For instance, the Adobe Web
site is www.adobe.com. My e-mail address is
photoshop@bearhome.com.
How This Book Is Organized
To save you time, this book is organized into tech-
niques (short sections, usually four to eight pages
long) that show you how to use a specific Photoshop
feature or create a cool effect.
This book is laid out in an easy-to-read, two-column
format that’s full of figures to speed you through the
steps. No unnecessary fluff — just the steps, straight
and simple.
Because this book is so nice and wide (and a
bit floppy), make space on your desk to lay it
out flat. Crack the binding a bit if you have to.
That way, you can see exactly what you’re
doing without pages flipping unexpectedly or
the book sliding off a pile.
You can work through the book from front to back
if you want to or you can just dive right into the
technique of your choice. Either way works just fine.
Whenever I mention a concept that I don’t cover in
depth in that technique, I provide a cross-reference to
another technique that gives you more information.
If you need to find something specific, look through
the Table of Contents or scan the Index.
The Cheat Sheet at the beginning of the book lists
the most commonly needed features with a quick
reference to the technique that shows you how to
make it happen. Also included are important key-
board shortcuts and references to techniques that
show you how to save time by automating repetitive
tasks. Tear out the Cheat Sheet, use a highlighter to
mark the features most important to you, and then
tape it on your wall. Use it and abuse it — the Cheat
Sheet is there to help you find things fast.
The sixteen-page color section shows several tech-
niques as they progress from step to step. Look at
the Color Insert to get a taste of what you can accom-
plish with this book. If you see a finished image or
idea that you really like, turn to that technique, open
an image, and create your own masterpiece!
The walled city of Isengard has seven levels, and
three rings of power were given to the elves, but this
book needs ten parts to accomplish its task.
Part I: Making Photoshop Work for You
Get organized and get ready to be creative! The tech-
niques in this part show you how you can customize
Photoshop to tailor it to your needs. Create custom
keyboard shortcuts, organize and rank your image
files, set up a color management system, work with
tool presets, and batch process your files. Everything
that you need to save you time while performing
repetitive tasks is here.
Part II: Getting Images Into 
and Out of Photoshop
Peripheral devices such as digital cameras, scanners,
tablets, and printers can make even the most savvy
computer users tear their hair out at times. Take a
look at the techniques in this part to avoid pitfalls
when scanning images, using a digital camera, setting

Part VI: Amazing Fast Filter Effects
When I say amazing effects, I mean it! Some of the
techniques create subtle results, and other results
are downright wild. Sharpen your images or blur for
emphasis. Create beautiful watercolors, make images
look like pressed tin, or create a lovely sketch. Be
your own Andy Warhol and create photo silkscreens
to rival the Campbell’s Soup series. When you’re
finished creating your masterpieces, add frames or
special edges to really customize your work.
Part VII: Super Type Effects
Type doesn’t just have to be flat, boring, one-
dimensional letters on a page. Create type by using
nothing but shadows, use layer masks to create type
cut-outs, melt metal, drip lava, and wiggle with jelly.
The techniques in this part show you how to create
super type, super fast.
Part VIII: Transforming Images Using Channels
and Masks (It’s not as hard as you think!)
Layer masks are one of the great Photoshop features
that I use everyday. Find out how to make layers fade
in or out, use masks to hide portions of a layer, and
group layers into clipping masks.
Often ignored or just plain forgotten, channels are
essential in the Photoshop artist’s arsenal of talents.
Take a look at the techniques in this part to find out
what really makes channels tick, how to use them,
and how to get better results when recoloring and
applying filters.
Part IX: Creating Flashy, Professional 
Web Graphics
Web graphics are easy and fun to create. Even if your
family Web site has a “mom and pop” feel, you can
create great graphics with Photoshop and Image-
Ready, Photoshop’s sister program. You can teach
your old graphics new tricks by making them roll
up a tablet, using a printer, or getting your files ready
for high-end offset printing.
Part III: Using Layers to Save Time, Protect 
Your Work, and Create Cool Images
Layers are one of the fundamental building blocks in
Photoshop. You can’t create great images without
’em. The techniques in this part show you how to
manage and organize layers and create layer comps.
You find out how to use all those great layer features:
using blending modes; setting opacity; performing
transformations; adding special effects such as drop
shadows, bevels, embossing; and much more.
Part IV: Painting and Coloring 
to Enhance Your Images
If you’ve ever felt daunted by painting in the real
world, Photoshop can open doors to your painterly
imagination that you never thought possible. The
techniques in this part show you how to create cus-
tom brushes, create an oil painting by using a photo-
graph, apply color from one image to another,
recolor images by using gradients, and even paint
backward in time.
Part V: Restoring and Retouching Images 
for Quick, Beautiful Results
Everyone loves a beautiful photograph, but few pho-
tos fall under the beautiful category. Usually, some-
thing is a bit off — perhaps the color isn’t quite right,
little Susie’s eyes look like something from Fright
Night, or Uncle George’s schnoz is just way too big.
You can fix these problems in a flash with Photoshop.
The techniques in this part deal with fixing problems,
recoloring with photo filters to enhance tones, creat-
ing and colorizing black and white images, and stitch-
ing photos together to create fantastic panoramas or
photomontages. With only a few clicks of the mouse,
you can turn a boring daytime scene with ordinary
lighting into a mysterious sunset photo with beautiful
twilight tones.

over or run across a page. I even show you how to
add hotspots for users to click. The techniques in
this section help you create super Web graphics,
save them, and preview them in your favorite
browser.
Part X: The Scary (Or Fun) Stuff
Have you ever wondered if there’s more to Photoshop
than meets the eye? (Actually, who needs to won-
der? We all know it has a lot under the hood.) The
techniques in this part show you how to extend
Photoshop’s capabilities by installing plug-ins, load-
ing tool and brush libraries, and using third-party
software within Photoshop to make your images
even more spectacular.
About the Color Insert 
and the Web Site
This book comes with a Color Insert and a companion
Web site. Because the book is printed in black and
white, I’ve chosen certain images from the techniques
so that you can see the colorful results. At the Web
site, you can find links to great Photoshop sites and
jpeg images from the Color Insert. If you want to fol-
low along and experiment with the techniques fea-
tured in the Color Insert, go to www.dummies.com/go/
photoshopcstt and download the images.
Icons Used in This Book
As you use this book, you’re sure to run across some
icons sprinkled in the margins. Each icon has a pur-
pose, which I define here:
This handy little icon marks interesting tidbits
that can save you time, tell you how to do
something faster, or just generally help speed
things up. When you’re working in Photoshop,
editing and manipulating images can take lots
of time. (I can’t even remember how many
times I’ve looked at the clock and realized that
two hours have just gone by in what felt like
two minutes.) These handy hints help speed
you on your way.
When I have an interesting idea, or a special
feature is worth mentioning, I use this icon. Tips
can explain how to use an alternative method
or point the way to something helpful.
This icon is like the string tied around your
finger — without the numbness and blue skin
tone. You don’t need to memorize the info
marked with this icon. However, try to remem-
ber that this icon indicates a special Photoshop
feature that you may need to know for future
endeavors.
I hate being worried or feeling pressured, so I
don’t want to pass anything on to you. I use this
icon — which serves to protect you from file
damage or worse — only when it’s really, really
necessary. There’s no need to get uptight about
stuff, so you don’t see this icon very often. (I
think I use it only three or four times in the
whole book.) Photoshop and your computer are
there for you (not the other way around). If you
make a mistake or get frustrated, you can just
leave the computer and come back after a cap-
puccino — the computer will still be there wait-
ing ever so patiently for you.
Where to Go from Here
If you think this book is worth its weight in salt or if
you just want to gab with the publisher, you can con-
tact the For Dummies folks at www.dummies.com. Click
the Contact Us link to find out where you can send
your comments and suggestions.
You can contact Phyllis at photoshop@bearhome.com
with any questions or comments. I can’t promise to
answer everything that comes my way — what with
two children, a third on the way, and a ridiculous
writing and teaching schedule — but I’ll do my best!
I will certainly include any good suggestions or tips
in the next edition of this book.

Organizing Image
Files and Managing
Projects
B
efore you start a project, take a few minutes to get organized. This
may seem like a waste of time — you’re excited and you want to get
started — but a little organization now goes a long way in helping
you work smarter, not harder. 
Some projects can consist of one or two image files, while other projects
can be made up of hundreds. Even if you don’t think you’ll end up with a
ton of image files, many projects created in Photoshop CS and Image-
Ready, Photoshop’s sister program, end up involving literally hundreds
of files. How do you organize all this?
Thankfully, Photoshop CS comes with a great organizing tool, the File
Browser. The File Browser is more than just a window showing thumb-
nails of your image files. It is a pretty complete asset management system
that you can use to, well, manage your assets (image files). With the File
Browser, you can create a folder system to organize image files, search
for images using thumbnails, move and rename images, flag and rank
images, and much more. This technique covers the ins and outs of how
to use the File Browser and includes tips for organizing image folders to
help your workflow.
In addition, this technique shows you how to add virtual sticky notes or
vocal annotations to an image and gives you a few tips about which
image files you should save and which ones you should discard.
Managing Your Projects
If you take a few minutes to organize folders and files before embarking
upon a project, you’ll be more organized, be able to find the image files
you want to work on, and reduce the possibility of deleting files that may
be important.
When I start on a project, I create a master folder that contains all the
folders and files for that project. Usually, I give this folder a name that
refers to the project and helps me find it quickly (especially when I arrive
at the computer in the morning bleary-eyed because my little son has
kept me up all night!).

Technique 1: Organizing Image Files and Managing Projects
10
Using the File Browser
The File Browser is your place for one-stop shopping
when you need to find image files, open them, save
copies, rename them, flag or rank them, and so on.
The File Browser is a large window, which you can
open by clicking the Toggle File Browser button on
the Options bar, choosing File➪Browse, or pressing
Ctrl+Shift+O (the letter)/Ô+Shift+O (the letter).
The File Browser, shown in Figure 1-1, is divided into
two sections. Four palettes are on the left side of the
window and a Preview pane is on the right:

The Folders palette shows you a branching, hier-
archical view of all your folders and files. The
tree structure lets you dig around in folders to
find your image files.

The Preview palette shows you a thumbnail
image that is selected in the Preview pane. If you
double-click the preview image in the Preview
palette, the image opens.

The Metadata palette displays information about
the currently selected image file, including file
size, date created, image height and width, reso-
lution, color mode, camera data, and other
important info. The Metadata palette also
includes a GPS section that you can set to the
exact position on the earth where you took the
photo (just in case you want to return to the
exact spot!).

The Keywords palette displays keywords
assigned to an image. You can group and organ-
ize images by these keywords. 

The Preview pane shows thumbnail previews of
the image file types that Photoshop CS supports. 
Inside this master folder are more folders that divide
the project into parts. For instance, if I’m working on
a new series of images that I’ve scanned, I create one
Scans folder that contains the original scanned
images, another Working folder that contains all the
files I’m working on, and a third Finished folder that
contains only completed image files. I never save
over any of the original scanned images in the Scan
folder; instead I save a copy in the Working folder.
That way, if I make a huge, tremendous mistake, I
always have the original available.
This is only one way to go about it. You can have
folders within a Working folder that are dated so that
you know what you were working on when; you can
also divide up a project by its pieces — if you’re
working on a brochure, for example, you could have
Front Flap, Panel 1, and Back Flap folders. What I’m
suggesting is to take the time to think about your
project before you start working on it. Take a good
old-fashioned piece of paper and a pen or some 3 x 5
cards and block out the process of your project. If
you take the time now to think about what you’re
creating and how you’re going to create it, you save
a huge amount of time in the long run.
Deciding which files to discard
Another workflow issue is what I call housekeeping — deciding
which files are valuable and need to be kept, and which
images can head toward the virtual circular file.
Because my computer has a large hard drive, I tend to keep
more than I probably should. I always have that lingering
thought in the back of my mind, “What if I need that layer
mask, or need this technique again?”
My best advice for deciding which images to delete is to
carefully consider where your project is heading. Is a partic-
ular image file one that you used to test a specific technique
that didn’t work? Then, fine, delete it. Be careful, though,
because after an image file is gone, it’s gone. Take a look at
Technique 7 for tips about creating backups and snapshots.
Also, if you have a CD-R or CD-RW, you can archive your
files on a CD-ROM disc. This saves you precious hard drive
space and still saves any files you might want to keep “just
in case.”

Using the File Browser

• Figure 1-1: The File Browser makes finding and opening
images easy. 
File Browser basics
The first step to managing your image files is to
understand the basic functionality of the File
Browser — opening files, selecting images in the
Preview pane, moving files to different folders, and
deleting files. Here’s a list of the basics:

To select a file in the Preview pane, just click the
image thumbnail. A larger version of the selected
image thumbnail appears in the Preview palette.

To open a file, either double-click the image
thumbnail in the Preview pane, double-click the
image thumbnail in the Preview palette, or select
the image in the Preview pane and then choose
File➪Open from the File Browser menu.
Click to view palette menu

Flag an image
Delete

Palettes

To navigate through your folders in the Folders
palette, on a PC click the plus sign next to a folder
name to view all the subfolders inside that folder.
On a Mac, click the triangle next to a folder name
to view the subfolders.

To move a file to a different folder, select the
image file in the Preview pane, and then drag it
to the desired folder in the Folders palette.

To delete a file, you can either select it in the
Preview pane and then press the Delete key, drag
the image from the Preview pane to the trashcan
icon at the top of the File Browser window, or
right-click/option-click on the thumbnail in the
Preview pane and choose the Delete option from
the context-sensitive menu.
Renaming individual files
To rename an individual file, click the filename below
the thumbnail in the Preview pane. The filename
becomes highlighted. Type a new name for the
image file, and then click the image thumbnail. When
you click the image’s filename to rename it, only the
filename is selected, not the three-letter file exten-
sion that tells Photoshop CS what kind of file it is
(such as .tif or .pdf). You must drag over the file
extension to change the file type, if you want.
If you’re a Mac user and you send files to
someone using a PC, remember to add the
three-letter file extension to your filenames.
You can tell Photoshop to automatically add
the extension to the filename when saving the
image file. Either press Option+K and then
Option+2, or choose Edit➪Preferences➪
File Handling to open the Preferences dialog
box. Select the Always option from the
Append File Extension drop-down list. In addi-
tion, select the Use Lower Case option as well.
This ensures compatibility with other plat-
forms, including UNIX, and makes any Web
graphics you create work on any platform.

4.
Use the File Naming area to select how you
want to rename the files.
You have the option of appending up to six differ-
ent file variables with the drop-down menus,
such as a serial number or letter, or a date
(shown in Figure 1-3). For example, I want the
images I selected in Step 1 renamed using the
document name + the date + the three-letter file
extension. For instance, Flower.jpg is renamed
Flower010904.jpg.
• Figure 1-3: You select the filenaming variables you want
to use with the drop-down lists.
5.
Select the Compatibility check boxes at the bot-
tom of the Batch Rename dialog box.
This ensures the files are named so that they
work on any computer, no matter what operating
system is running.
6.
Click OK.
Photoshop CS goes to work renaming all the
selected files. 
Creating a new folder
Creating a new folder for your images with the File
Browser is easy. Select the location for the new
folder with the Folders palette — this can be a hard
drive or another folder (if you select a folder, the
Batch renaming
When you use the Batch Rename command, you can
rename the files in the folder where they currently
live or move them to a different folder. (Remember:
Moving files does just that — it moves them to a new
folder instead of creating copies.) Also, you can add
up to six different additions to each filename, such
as a serial number or letter or month/day/year.
Follow these steps to rename multiple files at once:
1.
Select the files you want to rename.
Select a bunch of files from the same folder by
holding down Shift (to select consecutive files)
or Ctrl/Ô (to select non-consecutive files) and
clicking the files. Or you can choose Edit➪Select
All from the File Browser menu to select an entire
folder of images. 
2.
Choose Automate➪Batch Rename from the File
Browser menu.
The Batch Rename dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 1-2.
• Figure 1-2: You select the location of the renamed image
files and set how to modify the image file-
names in the Batch Rename dialog box.
3.
Select whether you want to keep the files in the
folder where they are currently located or
move them to a new folder.
In the Destination Folder area, select the Rename
in Same Folder or the Move to New Folder radio
button. Click Browse (Windows) or Choose
(Mac) to locate a folder for a different location.

new folder appears as a subfolder within the
selected folder). Then, either right-click/option-click
on the selected folder and choose the New Folder
option from the context-sensitive menu or choose
File➪New Folder from the File Browser menu.
You should know, however, that  you can’t
delete a folder with the File Browser. You have
to minimize Photoshop CS and go to the desk-
top level to do that.
Get Organizing!
Photoshop CS gives you many options to organize
your image files — you can rank and flag them, sort
images, and add and move images around the File
Browser.
Flagging files
If you need to quickly sort through many images
(suppose you import 50 photos from a digital cam-
era), flagging images in the File Browser is a quick
way to separate the wheat from the chaff. 
To flag an image, simply select the image you want
to flag in the Preview pane, and then click the Flag
icon at the top of the File Browser window. A small
flag icon appears at the bottom-right corner of the
image thumbnail in the Preview pane. You can view
either flagged or unflagged image files by selecting
either the Flagged Files or Unflagged Files option or
both from the Show drop-down list at the top right of
the File Browser window (see Figure 1-4).
Ranking files
Another way to sort files is to rank them. Suppose
you flag 20 photo files, and then just view those
flagged files, which I discuss in the preceding sec-
tion. You can also line the images up in a specific
order. This is where ranking comes in. Ranking lets
you control how to sort images in the File Browser.
You can rank one image at a time or give the same
rank to several selected images. 
• Figure 1-4: Use the Show drop-down list to select
whether you want to view flagged or
unflagged files, or all files.
To rank images, follow these steps: 
1.
Select the image or images you want to rank in
the Preview pane.
If you want to select more than one image, you
can either Shift+click or Ctrl+click/Ô+click the
files you want to select.
2.
Right-click/Ctrl+click the selected image and
choose the Rank option from the shortcut
menu or choose Edit➪Rank from the File
Browser’s menu bar.
The Rank Files dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 1-5.
• Figure 1-5: Rank image files with the Rank Files
dialog box.
3.
Enter numbers and/or letters in the Rank 
text box.
When you sort the files, Photoshop sorts them
numerically and/or alphabetically, depending
upon what you enter in the Rank text box.

Technique 1: Organizing Image Files and Managing Projects
14
• Figure 1-6: The Toggle Expanded View arrows hide the
palettes and enlarge the Preview pane.
Photoshop remembers the positions in which
you sort the image files. Even if you close the
File Browser and shut down Photoshop, the
next time you view that folder of image files
using the File Browser, the files will still be in
the same positions you left them in. How does
Photoshop do this? By creating a special cache
file that saves all the positioning information.
Adding Notes and
Vocal Annotations
Another way to organize a project and help to
remember diddly items about an image that you’re
working on is to add virtual sticky notes to an image
or even record a message.
4.
Click OK. 
To view the image ranks, choose View➪
Show Rank from the File Browser menu.
To sort the images in the Preview pane by 
rank, choose Sort➪Rank.
Sorting images
The File Browser comes with more than a dozen
ways you can sort image files. With the Sort menu,
you can sort by filename, by image dimensions, reso-
lution, file type, when you created the images, and
much more.
To sort a folder of images displayed in the Preview
pane, simply click the Sort menu at the top of the
File Browser window, and then choose from one of
the many options. The images sort and re-sort the
way you choose.
Turning the File Browser into a lightbox
When working with 35mm slides on a lightbox, I
move the slides around, rearrange them in the order
that I need them in, and then place them in a plastic
slide page to keep them in that order. You can do the
same thing with the File Browser. 
To sort images as you do with a lightbox, click the
Toggle Expanded View arrows at the bottom of the
File Browser, as shown in Figure 1-6. This hides the
palettes at the left side of the File Browser and
expands the area of the Preview pane.
You can now just drag the image thumbnails around
on the virtual lightbox into the order you want to
sort them. Note: When you drag an image file to a
new position, the other files move over to make
room, automatically snapping into position.

Adding Notes and Vocal Annotations
15
To add a virtual sticky note to an image, follow these
steps:
1.
With the image open in Photoshop, select the
Notes tool from the Toolbox (or press N on the
keyboard). 
2.
Click in the image window.
A note window appears, as shown in Figure 1-7.
3.
Type your message, and then click the tiny Close
box at the upper corner of the note window. 
A small note icon remains in the image window. If
you want to open the note, just double-click it.
To delete the note, right-click/Ô+click on the
note icon and choose the Delete Note option
from the context-sensitive menu.
• Figure 1-7: Adding notes to remind you of something.
The small note icon is visible only in the image
window when the image is open in Photoshop
CS. If you print the image, the icon does not
print.
Follow these steps to add a vocal annotation to an
image:
1.
With an image open in Photoshop, select the
Audio Annotation tool from the Toolbox.
Remember: You need a microphone plugged into
your computer’s sound card.
2.
Click anywhere in the image window.
The Audio Annoation dialog box, shown in Figure
1-8, opens.
• Figure 1-8: Click Start to begin recording an audio
annotation.
3.
Click Start to begin recording your message.
4.
When you’re finished recording, click Stop.
A tiny speaker icon appears in the image window.
If you want to hear the recorded message, just
double-click the icon. To delete the annotation,
right-click/Ô+click the speaker icon and choose
the Delete Audio Annotation option from the
context-sensitive menu.
The speaker icon is visible only in the image
window when the image is open in Photoshop
CS. If you print the image, the icon does not
print.

Technique
Creating Custom
Palette Groups and
Workspaces
W
hen you open Photoshop CS for the first time (see Figure 2-1),
notice that some palettes are arranged along the right side of
the program window, some palettes are available in the Palette
Well on the Options bar, and, if you open the Window menu, some
palettes are not visible at all.
• Figure 2-1: By default, not all palettes are shown in the Photoshop CS program
window.
As you work on projects, you’ll discover that you need to move palettes
out of the way in order to see something and access palettes that aren’t
displayed. In addition, you’ll probably find that some palettes display in
the program window that you never use. Why have unused palettes tak-
ing up valuable screen real estate? Why not customize your working envi-
ronment so that you can work more efficiently? That’s where this
technique comes in.

Making Custom Palette Groups
17
In this technique, you find out how to customize your
workspace. You discover how to make Photoshop
remember the location of the palettes and Toolbox,
so they appear in the same positions every time you
launch Photoshop. You find out how to break apart
the default palette groups and create your own palette
groups. Then, you find out how to create custom work-
spaces so that you can retrieve these custom palette
groups when you need them for a special project.
Saving Palette Locations
With one simple check box selected, you can tell
Photoshop CS to remember the location of your
palettes and Toolbox between work sessions. Every
time you launch Photoshop, the palettes and
Toolbox reappear in the same place you left them as
last time (Photoshop considers the Toolbox a
palette). In addition, if you create any custom palette
groups (as described in the next section),
Photoshop remembers those as well.
To save your palette locations, press Ctrl/Ô+K to
open the General panel of the Preferences dialog
box, as shown in Figure 2-2. Make sure that the Save
Palette Locations box is checked, and then click OK.
• Figure 2-2: Select Save Palette Locations in the
Preferences dialog box.
Making Custom Palette Groups
Photoshop CS gives you everything to help you work
more efficiently — this includes creating your own
palette groups. In Figure 2-3, notice that three
palettes are grouped together; this is known as, well,
a palette group.
• Figure 2-3: You can arrange palettes in palette groups.
Breaking apart palette groups and building custom
palette groups based on the type of work you’re
doing is easy. For instance, if you’re doing a lot of
painting, creating a custom palette group containing
the Brushes, Color, and Tool Presets palettes makes
sense.
To separate a palette from its palette group, all you
need to do is drag the palette’s tab out of the group,
as shown in Figure 2-4.
To add a palette to a palette group (making your
own custom palette groups), drag a palette’s tab
onto another palette group.
Windows users: If you want to keep a palette
or palette group displayed in the Photoshop
program window but want to recapture some
screen real estate, click the Minimize box at
the upper right of the palette, as shown in
Figure 2-5. When you do, the palette collapses.
Mac users can click the tiny green button at
the upper left of a palette to toggle between
three sizes.

Technique 2: Creating Custom Palette Groups and Workspaces
18
A few palette group suggestions
You can create custom palette groups to help you work
more efficiently depending upon the type of project you are
working on. Of course, you can group palettes in any way
that works for you, but here are a few suggestions to get
you started:

If you’re doing a project that requires a lot of paint-
ing, group the Brushes, Color, and Tool Presets
palettes together. Substitute the Swatches palette for
the Tool Presets palette for a different variation.

If you are working on a text intensive project, open
the Character and Paragraph palettes (they are
grouped together by default) by choosing either
Window➪Character or Window➪Paragraph. Then,
add the Tool Presets palette to this palette group.
Any custom Type tool presets that you create are
quickly available. (Take a look at Technique 6 to find
out how to create your own tool presets.)

If you’re creating graphics for the Web in
Photoshop’s sister program, ImageReady, try out the
palette groups that are available when you choose
Window➪Workspace. One palette group helps with
optimizing graphics files, the other makes creating
GIF animations easy. To find out more about these
palettes and creating Web graphics using
ImageReady, turn to Part IX.
Using the Palette Well
Another place to put palettes that you use all the time
is in the Palette Well on the Options bar. By default,
the Brushes, Tool Presets, and Comps palettes are
docked in the Palette Well, as shown in Figure 2-6.
• Figure 2-6: When you launch Photoshop for the first time,
three palettes are docked in the Palette Well.
• Figure 2-4: Drag the palette’s tab out of the palette
group.
• Figure 2-5: Click the Minimize box to collapse a palette.
Click here to minimize palette.
Click here to expand palette.

Creating Custom Workspaces
19
If you don’t see the Palette Well in the upper-
right corner of the Photoshop program win-
dow, your monitor’s resolution may be the
culprit. If your monitor resolution is set to
800 x 600 or less, the Palette Well — and other
parts of the program window — are hidden.
Raise your monitor resolution to see the entire
program window.
You can use the Palette Well to store palettes that
you use frequently but want out of the way. To
access a palette docked in the Palette Well, simply
click the palette’s tab and the palette opens. 
Removing and adding palettes to the Palette Well
works just like removing and adding palettes from
palette groups (see the “Making Custom Palette
Groups” section). Drag the tab of the palette that
you want to remove out of the Palette Well. To add a
palette, drag the palette’s tab over the Palette Well.
Creating Custom Workspaces
Letting Photoshop automatically remember your
palette locations, as described in “Saving Palette
Locations,” is fine and dandy if you are the only one
working on your computer. But, what if other people
use your computer and you don’t have separate user
accounts set up? Suppose that one of them likes to
close all the palettes and use them only when she
needs them. That could really mess up your work-
space. Also, suppose that you are a very creative
person and you like to do several different kinds of
projects — brochures for Company A, photo
retouching for Company B, and creating Web graph-
ics for your own Web site. These different kinds of
projects use different palettes. You may want to set
up your workspace very differently depending upon
the type of work you’re doing on a certain day. 
Ordinarily, you would have to rearrange palettes and
move everything around until you’re satisfied and
ready to work. This gets pretty tedious if you are
working on one type of project on Monday, but
another type of project on Tuesday. However
Photoshop takes all the tedium out of setting up
workspaces by remembering palette locations for
you. To create a custom workspace:
1.
Position and group palettes where you want
them, close palettes you don’t need, and dock
any palettes you would like in the Palette Well. 
2.
Choose Window➪Workspace➪Save Workspace. 
The Save Workspace dialog box opens, as shown
in Figure 2-7.
• Figure 2-7: Enter a name for your workspace in the text
box, and then click OK.
3.
Type a descriptive name for your custom work-
space in the Name text box.
4.
Click OK.
Create as many workspaces as you need. When
you want to load a workspace, choose Window➪
Workspace and then choose the custom workspace
you want to use from the bottom of the Workspace
submenu, as shown in Figure 2-8.
If you ever want to delete a workspace, choose
Window➪Workspace➪Delete Workspace. Then,
select the workspace you want to delete from the
drop-down list and click Delete.
You can also return the palettes to their
default Photoshop locations with just a click of
the mouse. Choose Window➪Workspace➪
Reset Palette Locations.

Assigning Custom
Keyboard Shortcuts
U
sing keyboard shortcuts that are easy to remember can increase
your productivity, helping you work faster and more efficiently. If
you like the keyboard shortcuts you use in other programs, you
can customize Photoshop CS to do it your way.
Depending upon the type of work you do, you might like to define several
shortcut sets. For instance, if you are using several filters over and over,
you can assign custom shortcuts that give quick, easy access to those
filters. You could save these filter shortcuts in a shortcut set named
“Filters.” A second shortcut set that you might create, suppose it’s
named “Color Modes,” could include custom shortcuts that quickly
convert images from one color mode to another (for instance, from
RGB color mode to CMYK color mode). Any time you need one of these
shortcut sets, you can quickly load it.
This technique covers how to create custom shortcuts, save them in a
shortcut set, and load the shortcut set when you need it. In addition, you
find out how to view a complete list of shortcuts available to you in a
shortcut set. Finally, you find out how to revert to the standard shortcuts
that come with Photoshop, and delete unwanted shortcut sets.
Defining Custom Shortcuts
Creating your own shortcuts is easy. You have to keep some things in
mind, though, when creating shortcuts. Photoshop lets you come up with
almost any keystroke combination that you can think of, but there are a
few rules:

Single letter keystrokes such as M or B can be assigned only to tools in
the Toolbox.

Single digits, such as 1 or 9, cannot be used for shortcuts.

You can use any combination of the Shift, Ctrl/Ô, or Alt/Option keys
with a letter or number. For instance, you could use Shift+8 or
Ctrl+Shift+K/Ô+Shift+K for shortcuts.

2.
Locate the menu item or tool to which you want
to add the shortcut.
3.
Use the Shortcuts For drop-down list to select
the location of the item to which you want to
add the shortcuts.
You can choose from:
 Application Menus: These are the commands
found on the Menu bar at the top of the pro-
gram window.
 Palette Menus: These are the commands
available with each palette.
 Tools: These are the tools in the Toolbox.
4.
Select the menu command or tool to which you
want to add the custom shortcut.
If you selected Application Menus or Palette
Menus in Step 3, then you need to click the tiny
arrow next to a menu or palette category to view
the available commands, as shown in Figure 3-2.
• Figure 3-2: Click the tiny arrow to access the commands
in a menu or palette.
5.
Enter a custom shortcut in the text box.
Just enter the combination you want to use in
the text box, such as Ctrl+O/Ô+O. If there’s a
conflict or problem, Photoshop tells you as
shown in Figure 3-3.
Enter shortcut here

Any of the function keys can be used on their
own or in combination with the Shift, Ctrl/Ô, or
Alt/Option keys.

Any shortcuts assigned by Photoshop to perma-
nent features, such as palettes, cannot be used.
For instance, Ctrl+1/Ô+1 is assigned as a short-
cut to access the first channel in the Channels
palette. You cannot reassign this shortcut.
That said, you can come up with plenty of other
combinations. If any shortcuts conflict (a shortcut is
in use somewhere else or you create an impossible
combination), don’t worry! Photoshop tells you
what’s wrong.
To create your own custom shortcuts, follow these
steps:
1.
Choose Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts or press
Shift+Ctrl+Alt+K/Shift+Ô+Option+K on the key-
board. ( You can use your toes if you need to.)
The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box shown in
Figure 3-1 opens, displaying the currently
selected shortcut set.
• Figure 3-1: The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box opens
showing the loaded shortcut set.

Saving Shortcut Sets
23
• Figure 3-3: If you try to assign a custom shortcut that is
unacceptable or creates a conflict, Photoshop
tells you.
6.
Accept or cancel the shortcut:
If the shortcut does not create any conflicts,
click Accept to add the shortcut.
If the shortcut creates a conflict and you don’t
want to use it, click either Undo or Undo
Changes.
If the shortcut creates a conflict and you still
want to accept it, you can either click Accept to
add the change and not view the command that
created the conflict or click Accept and Go To
Conflict to add the change and view the com-
mand that created the conflict.
When you add a custom shortcut, you may
notice that (modified) is appended to the
currently selected shortcut set name. Any cus-
tom shortcuts you create are automatically
saved with the currently selected set unless
you save them in their own shortcut set.
Saving Shortcut Sets
Say the title of this section 10 times fast! After you
create custom shortcuts, you want to save them.
You have two options: You can save the new short-
cuts with the currently selected shortcut set or save
the shortcuts in a new shortcut set.
To save custom shortcuts to the currently selected
shortcut set, click the Save Changes to Current Set
button, shown in Figure 3-4.
• Figure 3-4: Click the Save Changes to Current Set button
to add custom shortcuts to the selected set.
To save custom shortcuts to a new shortcut set, fol-
low these steps:
1.
Click the Create New Set button, shown in
Figure 3-5.
• Figure 3-5: Click the Create New Set button to make a
new shortcut set.
The Save dialog box, shown in Figure 3-6, opens
with the appropriate folder location, Keyboard
Shortcuts, selected.
2.
Type a name for your shortcut set in the File
Name (Windows) or Save As (Mac) text box.
3.
Click Save.
The Save dialog box closes and the new set you
just created appears selected in the Set drop-
down list.

Technique 3: Assigning Custom Keyboard Shortcuts
24
Photoshop makes retrieving custom shortcuts easy.
You can view them on-screen or even print them for
quick reference.
1.
Open the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box by
choosing Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts.
2.
Select the shortcut set that you want to view
from the Set drop-down list.
3.
Click the Summarize button.
The Save dialog box opens.
4.
Enter a name for the shortcut set in the File
Name text box and select a folder where you
want to save the list of shortcuts, and then 
click Save.
Photoshop automatically creates an HTM file
containing all the keyboard shortcuts assigned
to that set and opens the file in your default
browser (see Figure 3-7).
• Figure 3-7: The shortcut list automatically opens in your
default browser.
• Figure 3-6: Enter the name for your custom shortcut set
in the File Name text box (Windows, top) or
Save As text box (Mac, bottom).
After you create a custom shortcut set, you
can load it by choosing Edit➪Keyboard
Shortcuts to open the Keyboard Shortcut dia-
log box. Select the set name from the Set
drop-down list, and then click OK to close the
dialog box and load the shortcuts.
Viewing a Complete 
List of Shortcuts
Even with the best intentions — creating shortcuts
that you’re sure you can’t forget — things happen.
Time passes, you have a new baby in the house (in
other words, you’re so sleep deprived your brain
stops functioning), whatever. Shortcuts can be
forgotten. 

Deleting a Shortcut Set
25
From here, you can just give the shortcut list a
look over to refresh your memory or use your
browser’s print feature to print the list as a
handy desk reference.
Reverting to Standard
Photoshop Shortcuts
If you find that you just can’t live without Photoshop’s
standard shortcut set, getting it back is easy.
Open the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box by choosing
Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts, select Photoshop Defaults
from the Set drop-down list, and then click OK.
Of course, if you need them, any custom shortcut
sets that you create are still available. You can select
a custom set from the Set drop-down list in the
Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box at any time.
Deleting a Shortcut Set
Moving out, moving up, moving on. For some reason
you decide you don’t need a particular shortcut set
anymore. The project is over and you’re sure you’ll
never have to convert so many images to CMYK
again. You’re moving to a new job and you don’t
want to leave your custom shortcuts lying around.
Whatever the reason, simply choose Edit➪Keyboard
Shortcuts to open the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog
box. Next, use the Set drop-down list to select the
shortcut set you want to delete, and then click the
Delete Shortcut Set button, shown in Figure 3-8.
• Figure 3-8: Click the trashcan to delete the selected

The Last Word
about Color
Management
W
hen I travel to different countries, I’m not always lucky enough
to speak the language. Over the years I’ve managed to learn a
good deal of Spanish and French, but Danish, Russian, Hindi?
Nope. If I want to speak to someone who knows no English (or Spanish or
French), I need a language interpreter. A good color management system
works as a color interpreter. It looks at how color is created by different
peripheral devices — such as digital cameras, monitors, and printers —
and then translates the color for each device, helping them display (or
print) the colors as accurately and consistently as possible.
Why do you need a color management system? Well, have you ever
scanned a photograph, opened the scanned image in Photoshop, and
then discovered to your dismay that the colors you see on-screen don’t
look anything like the original photograph? A color management system
checks the colors coming in from the scanner and then tells the monitor
to match those colors and accurately display them. 
If you think that setting up a color management system is difficult, it’s not.
Here’s the secret: All you have to do is adjust the colors of your monitor
(or calibrate your monitor) to display colors accurately, and then you
must tell Photoshop what devices you’re using so that it knows how to
accurately adjust and standardize the colors from device to device.
This technique deals with color management — a topic that’s created
lots of confusion over the years. Whenever I talk to Photoshop users,
many are puzzled about how the colors on the monitor can differ from a
photograph or color printout. Follow through this technique to find out
how to set up color management on your computer. First, I discuss why
each device handles color so differently. Then, I move on to the nitty-
gritty of calibrating your monitor and setting up color profiles so that
Photoshop can be your color interpreter.

Calibrating Your Monitor

What Is a Color Space and 
Why Is It So Important?
Every scanner, digital camera, software program,
monitor, and printer — every device or program that
you use to create, manipulate, or output images —
renders color in a different way. Each device works
within its own color space, the portion of the color
spectrum that it can reproduce.
For instance, a computer monitor uses red, green,
and blue light to create color; a color inkjet printer
uses cyan, yellow, magenta, and black inks to create
color; and a digital camera records the color it sees
using daylight (which has a yellowish cast) or a flash
(which has a bluish cast). How can any of these
devices ever manage to create some kind of color
match without some help? They can’t. That’s where
color management goes to work.
Calibrating Your Monitor
The first step in setting up a color management sys-
tem is to calibrate your monitor. For Windows users,
Photoshop defines the color space on your monitor
with the Adobe Gamma utility program. For Mac
users, you need to use OS X’s built-in Display
Calibrator Assistant.
Before you calibrate your monitor, you need to turn
it on, and if you’re using a CRT monitor, let it warm
up for at least 30 minutes. Also, make sure that your
room lighting is set at a constant level and that your
monitor is set at an angle that works for you. If you
are working with an LCD monitor, different viewing
angles can make colors change, so be sure that your
monitor is angled for optimal viewing.
For Windows users
Follow these steps to calibrate your monitor:
1.
Choose Start➪Control Panel.
The Windows XP control panel opens displaying
various system utilities.
2.
Double-click Adobe Gamma to open the utility.
The Adobe Gamma dialog box opens, displaying
the composite gamma, which is the combination
of red, green, and blue light that makes up the vis-
ible colors of what you’re seeing (see Figure 4-1).
To calibrate your monitor more accurately, you
turn this off to set the red, green, and blue
ranges for your monitor separately.
• Figure 4-1: Make sure to remove the check mark from
the View Single Gamma Only check box.

Technique 4: The Last Word about Color Management
28
to the Adobe Gamma dialog box, and use the
default monitor profile provided by the utility.
Skip Step 5 and continue with Step 6.
• Figure 4-3: The Open Monitor Profile dialog box provides
color space information for many monitor
models.
5.
Select your monitor model and click Open.
The Open Monitor Profile dialog box closes and
the monitor color space is loaded into the Adobe
Gamma utility.
6.
Use the Phosphors drop-down list to select your
monitor type.
If your monitor is not listed (a good basic setting
for monitors is Trinitron), then choose Custom
and enter the Red, Green, and Blue phosphors
settings for your monitor. To find these settings,
consult the manual that came with your monitor.
If you selected a monitor model in Step 4, the util-
ity automatically enters the Phosphors settings.
7.
In the Gamma area, use the slider bars under
the red, green, and blue areas to adjust each
color.
For each color, make the inner square match the
outer color as closely as possible.
8.
Click OK.
3.
In the Gamma area, click the View Single
Gamma Only check box to remove the check
mark and deselect this option.
The Adobe Gamma dialog box changes to display
the individual monitor colors of red, green, and
blue, as shown in Figure 4-2.
• Figure 4-2: Use the individual color channels to accurately
calibrate your monitor.
4.
Click the Load button to find your monitor
model.
The Open Monitor Profile dialog box opens and
displays a list of monitor models and color pro-
files followed by an .icm file extension (Figure
4-3). For instance, I’m using a ViewSonic PF790
monitor. To identify my monitor to the Adobe
Gamma utility, I selected PF790.icm from the list.
If you can’t find your monitor model in the Open
Monitor Profile dialog box, click Cancel to return

Calibrating Your Monitor
29
The Save As dialog box opens with the Color
folder selected (this is where all the other color
profiles are saved on your computer).
9.
Enter a name for your custom profile in the File
Name text box, and then click Save.
Your custom profile is saved and the Adobe
Gamma dialog box closes. Every time you use
Photoshop, these settings transfer to Photoshop
so that the program knows how to set your moni-
tor’s color space.
For Mac users
To calibrate your monitor with Mac OS X, follow
these steps:
1.
Choose System Preferences➪Displays.
The Displays pane of the System Preferences dia-
log box opens showing the Display and Color
tabs, as shown in Figure 4-4.
• Figure 4-4: Use the Color tab in the Displays pane to
access monitor calibration.
2.
Select the Color tab and click the Calibrate 
button.
The Display Calibrator Assistant opens, as
shown in Figure 4-5. The Display Calibrator uses
Apple’s system-wide color management system
called ColorSync.
• Figure 4-5: The Display Calibrator Assistant helps guide
you through calibrating your monitor.
3.
Select the Expert Mode check box.
Expert mode gives you more control over how
your monitor is calibrated.
4.
Click Continue.
The next Display Calibrator Assistant pane
enables you to set the neutral tones of the dis-
play, as shown in Figure 4-6.
• Figure 4-6: Use the sliders to make the apple match the
background.

12.
Click Continue.
13.
Move the sliders to make the black apple blend
into the background.
When the apple is blended in correctly, the back-
ground appears almost black.
14.
Click Continue.
5.
Move the blue dot sliders in the squares to the
left and right of the apple to adjust neutral tones.
Move the sliders until the apple matches the
background as closely as possible. (It may help
to squint!)
6.
Click Continue.
The next panel of the Display Calibrator Assistant
sets the brightness values, as shown in Figure 4-7.
• Figure 4-7: Use the sliders to make the apple’s brightness
match the striped background.
7.
Move the blue dot sliders in the squares to the
right and left of the apple to adjust your moni-
tor’s brightness.
8.
Click Continue.
Shown in Figure 4-8, the next panel helps you set
your monitor’s luminescence.
9.
Move the blue dot sliders to make the apple
match the background as closely as possible.
10.
Click Continue.

Setting a Working Space
After you calibrate your monitor and identify it,
you’ll use Photoshop to select a color space — also
called a working space — depending upon the type
of work you do. Just follow these steps:
1.
In Photoshop, choose Edit ( Photoshop on the
Mac)➪Color Settings.
The Color Settings dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 4-14, displaying a huge array of choices.

gives the widest range of possible colors. Also, it
allows you to accurately view high-end 24-bit
images.
To find out more about a particular option
in the Color Settings dialog box, pass your
mouse over that option. An explanation of the
feature appears in the Description area at the
bottom of the dialog box.
3.
Click OK to close the dialog box and save your
color management settings.
Setting Color Space Conversions
Another part of Photoshop’s color management sys-
tem is to set how images embedded with a color pro-
file are handled when they don’t match your color
settings. This comes up when you open an image
that uses color settings different from yours.
To set your color management policy, follow these
steps:
1.
Choose Edit (Photoshop on the Mac)➪Color
Settings.
2.
Use the CMYK, RGB, and Gray drop-down lists
in the Color Management Policies area to set
how images should be handled.
As shown in Figure 4-15, you have three options
to choose from for each:
 Off: Turns color management off when an
image is imported or opened.
 Preserve Embedded Profiles: Uses the color
setting saved with the image. It does not con-
vert the image to current Photoshop settings.
(Photoshop can have any number of images
with different color settings open at the
same time.)
 Convert to Working RGB: Converts the image
to the current color settings.
3.
Select the Profile Mismatches: Ask When
Opening and Missing Profiles: Ask When
Opening check boxes.
Each of these options sets Photoshop to ask how
to proceed with color conversion when an image
that doesn’t match your color settings is opened
or imported.
• Figure 4-15: Set how imported or opened images are
handled in the Color Management
Policies area.
4.
Click OK to close the dialog box and save your
color management policy settings.
Converting to Another 
Color Space
If you open or import an image into Photoshop that
uses different color profile settings (depending upon
your color management policy settings), Photoshop
automatically converts the image to the current
color settings, asks whether you want to convert the
image, or doesn’t do anything. (To find out how to
set your color management policy, turn to the pre-
ceding section, “Setting Color Space Conversions.”)
If Photoshop is set to ask how to proceed with the
conversion, the Embedded Profile Mismatch dialog

Making Image
Editing Easier
T
he other day my little 2-year-old son was using a magnifying glass
to look at an ant. There he was, nose almost to the ground, first
looking at the ant without the magnifying glass, and then popping
the magnifying glass in front of his eyes to view the ant close up. With
Photoshop you can get out your virtual magnifying glass and take a close
look at your images. When you’re working on an image, seeing the details
is really important. Being able to edit down at the pixel level can make all
the difference (especially when working on small Web graphics).
You can change the magnification (or view size) of an image to see it at
actual size, pixel by pixel, or any magnification in between. View sizes are
expressed in percentages, so 100% shows the image at its actual size;
200% doubles the size of the image on-screen, magnifying it; and 50%
halves the size on-screen, shrinking the image.
This technique covers the ins and outs of zooming. You might think
you know everything you need to know about magnifying images in
Photoshop, but a few tips here may surprise you and come in handy.
Using the Navigator Palette
The Navigator palette, shown in Figure 5-1, is one of the palettes I use all
the time. With this palette you can zoom in and out and quickly move
around the image window to see hidden areas. If you don’t see this
palette on-screen (by default it is docked with the Info palette), choose
Window➪Navigator.


You can drag the View box inside the image
thumbnail in order to view another part of the
image in the image window.

By default, the View box is cyan (Windows) or
red (Mac). You can change the color of the View
box (this is particuarly helpful if the image is
light, making the View box hard to see). To
change the color of the View box, choose Palette
Options from the Navigator palette menu. Use
the Color drop-down list in the Palette Options
dialog box to select a color. (You can also select
a color by clicking the color you want to use in
the image window.)

Hold down the Ctrl/Ô key and drag a new View
box in the image thumbnail of the Navigator
palette. This is a quick way to change the magnifi-
cation and move to a different area of the image.

If you have screen real estate available, you can
drag the Size box to make the Navigator palette
bigger. As the palette gets larger, the image thumb-
nail also gets bigger. This makes navigating much
easier.
Other Zooming Techniques
You should know a few other ways to zoom in and out.
These shortcuts can help you work more efficiently:

Press Ctrl+plus (+)/Ô+plus (+) to zoom in.

Press Ctrl+minus (-)/Ô+minus (-) to zoom out.

Type an exact magnification percentage or ratio in
the Magnification box at the lower-left corner
of the image window (see Figure 5-2), and then
press Enter/Return. 100% magnification is the
actual pixel size of the image. The same magnifi-
cation using a ratio is 1:1; 200% magnification is
expressed as the ratio 2:1; 50% magnification is
expressed as 1:2, and so on.
• Figure 5-1: The Navigator palette is your key to quick
zooming.
You can zoom in and out using the Navigator palette
in four different ways:

Type a magnification percentage in the
Magnification box (in the lower-left corner), and
then press Enter/Return.

Click the Zoom In button to increase the magnifi-
cation, viewing more and more pixel detail every
time you click the button.

Drag the Zoom slider to change the magnifica-
tion. If you drag to the left, the image zooms out;
if you drag to the right, the image zooms in.

Click the Zoom Out button to decrease the mag-
nification and view more of the image.


If you hold down the Ctrl/Ô key and the space-
bar at the same time, the mouse cursor tem-
porarily changes to the Zoom In tool. After you
finish zooming, release the keys to return to the
previous tool.

If you hold down the Alt/Option key and the
spacebar at the same time, the mouse cursor
temporarily changes to the Zoom Out tool. After
you’re done changing the view size, release the
keys to return to the previous tool.
Viewing an Image 
in Two Windows
One technique I use constantly when editing an
image is looking at the image in two windows. The
first window I use to zoom way in so that I can see
pixels — this is the image window in which I do the
actual image editing. The other window is set to
100% magnification (or whatever fits on-screen); I
use this window to see how my edits are working.
You don’t have to paint at a higher magnification, and
then zoom out to see how it looks, zoom in to paint
more, zoom out to check it again. Just open two win-
dows and preview your edits as you make them.
To open a second image window, choose Window➪
Arrange➪New Window. As shown in Figure 5-3, I’ve
set one window so that I can see the entire image.
The second window is magnified. Every time I make
a stroke with a brush or edit the image, the edit
appears simultaneously in both windows. Paired
with the Navigator palette, I can move around, zoom,
and edit to my heart’s content, seeing exactly what
I’m doing all the while.

Technique
Creating Your Own
Tool Presets
P
hotoshop comes with many features that help you save time and
work more efficiently. One of these great features is tool presets. 
A tool preset is a tool setting that Photoshop remembers. This tool setting
includes any settings selected on the Options bar, the Brushes palette
(for painting or retouching tools), and the Character palette (for type
tools). After you save a tool preset, you can access those tool settings at
any time by clicking the name of the preset in the Tool Presets palette or
Tool Presets picker. Also, tool presets are saved with Photoshop, not just
a specific image file. So, you can use the same tool presets with any num-
ber of image files.
You can define many types of presets in Photoshop besides tool-specific
presets — including presets for brushes, gradients, contours, swatches,
styles, patterns, and custom shapes. You can access these presets in the
palette or picker for each type of preset.
This technique deals exclusively with creating presets for tools. Brushes
can also be saved as presets and, yes, brushes are tools. But, I don’t
cover brushes here. Because brushes are so very special and important
to your work in Photoshop, I devote an entire technique to creating cus-
tom brushes and brush presets. So, if you want to create brush presets,
flip through the book to Technique 23.
Working with the Tool Presets Palette
and the Tool Presets Picker
The Tool Presets palette and the Tool Presets picker are like smart stor-
age bins for tool presets. The palette and the picker store exactly the
same tool presets; they are just different ways to access the tool presets.
As shown in Figure 6-1, by default, the Tool Presets palette resides in the
Palette Well at the right side of the Options bar; the Tool Presets picker
lives at the left side of the Options bar.

• Figure 6-1: By default, the Tool Presets picker and Tool
Presets palette are both on the Options bar.
Because the Tool Presets palette is, well, a palette,
you can pull it out of the Palette Well into the pro-
gram area if you want complete access to it, or you
can close it if you don’t need it. (For more about
moving, grouping, and docking palettes, take a look
at Technique 2.) If you don’t see the Tool Presets
palette anywhere in the Photoshop program area,
choose Window➪Tool Presets.
Both the Tool Presets picker and the Tool Presets
palette work in exactly the same way. All you need to
do to select a tool preset is to open the Tool Presets
picker or the palette, and then click the tool preset
you want to use. The tool is automatically selected
from the Toolbox with the saved attributes selected.
By default, all the tool presets that are loaded into
the Tool Presets palette and picker are displayed. If
you want to see tool presets only for the currently
selected tool, then you must select the Current
Tool Only option in either the picker or the palette.
(When you turn this option on in one, it is automati-
cally selected in the other.)
Loading a Tool Preset Library
You may not know it, but Photoshop ships with four
tool preset libraries that are not automatically loaded
Tool Presets picker
into Photoshop. These libraries include presets for
the Art History Brush, Brush tool, Horizontal Type
tool, and the Crop and Rectangular Marquee tools.
To load a tool preset library, follow these steps:
1.

bottom of the Tool Presets palette menu, as
shown in Figure 6-2.
• Figure 6-2: Select one of the tool preset libraries from

Technique 6: Creating Your Own Tool Presets
40
Creating Your Own Tool Presets
Imagine that you’re working on a text intensive
Photoshop project with four other artists. And, com-
ing up with the type styles needed for the project is
your job. This job includes the type’s font, size, and
other attributes, such as alignment, color, and hori-
zontal or vertical scale — any feature that you can
set for one of the Type tools.
After you come up with the type specifications,
how do you deliver the specs to the other
artists? You could type them all out and send
them via e-mail, but that means that each artist
has to enter multiple attributes into Photoshop
as they need text — not a pretty picture when
you think about time spent and the errors that
could creep in. Instead, you can create a tool
preset for each type spec, save the presets with
descriptive names, and then e-mail them to
your co-conspirators. The other artists load the
tool presets into their versions of Photoshop,
and that’s it. Everyone has the same specs and
can use them with a click of the mouse.
Besides creating a new tool preset from scratch, you
can also create a tool preset based on an existing
tool preset.
To create a new tool preset from scratch, follow
these steps:
1.
Select the tool from the Toolbox for which you
want to create the preset.
2.
Choose the settings you want to save with the
tool preset.
Depending upon the tool you select, you can use
the Options bar, Brushes palette, or Character
palette to choose the tool’s settings.
3.
Select New Tool Preset from the Tool Presets
palette menu.
The New Tool Preset dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 6-5.
 Click Cancel to back out of the entire loading
operation.
 Click Append to add the tool preset library
you selected to the tool presets currently
listed in the Tool Presets dialog box.
• Figure 6-3: Use this dialog box to set how you want the
selected tool preset library loaded into the
Tool Presets palette.
If you decide you don’t want to use a tool pre-
sets library that you loaded, you can unload it
by choosing Reset Tool Presets from the Tool
Presets palette menu, and then clicking OK.
Figure 6-4 shows the Crop and Marquee preset
library loaded into the Tool Presets palette.

Depending upon the tool you’re creating the pre-
set for, a special check box may also be included
in the New Tool Preset dialog box:
 Brush, Pencil, or Shape tool: Select Include
Color to tell Photoshop to remember the cur-
rently selected Foreground and Background
color.
 Gradient tool: Select Include Gradient to save
the currently selected gradient.
 Pattern Stamp tool: Select Include Pattern to
save the currently selected pattern.
5.
Click OK.
The new tool preset appears at the bottom of the
Tool Presets palette.
Follow these steps to create a new tool preset based
on an existing tool preset:
1.
In the Tool Presets palette, select the existing
tool preset that you want to use as the basis for
the new tool preset.
2.
Modify the tool preset settings by using the
Options bar, Brushes palette, or Character
palette.
3.
Select New Tool Preset from the Tool Presets
palette menu.
The New Tool Preset dialog box appears (refer to
Figure 6-5).
4.
Type a name for the tool preset.
5.
Click OK.
The new tool preset appears at the bottom of the
Tool Presets palette.
Creating identical Type tool presets
Creating new tool presets based on existing tool presets
works especially well for the Type tools. 
For instance, suppose you want to create two Type tool pre-
sets that have the same formatting attributes (font, size,
horizontal spacing), but one preset uses the Horizontal
Type tool and the other uses the Horizontal Type Mask tool.
Here’s how to create two different presets:
1.
Create the original tool preset by using the
Horizontal Type tool.
2.
Select the tool preset in the Tool Presets palette.
When you select the tool preset, all of the type attrib-
utes load into the Options bar and Character palette.
3.
Select the Horizontal Type Mask tool from the
Toolbox.
Even though you select a different Type tool, the type
attributes remain set in the Options bar and Character
palette.
4.
Choose New Tool Preset from the Tool Presets
palette menu.
5.
Type a name for the tool preset in the New Tool
Preset dialog box.
6.
Click OK.
Storing and Deleting 
Tool Presets
When you finish with a project, cleaning up and
doing a little bit of housekeeping is always a good
idea. The Tool Presets palette and picker can get so
filled up with presets that finding the new presets
you create is hard.
You have two options: You can save a project’s pre-
sets (think of it as archiving the presets in case you
need them at some later date) and then delete them
from the Tool Presets palette; or delete the tool pre-
sets without saving them. If you decide to delete the
tool presets without saving them, be sure you won’t

Technique
Moving Back in
Time: Getting Rid
of Mistakes
S
ometimes you make little mistakes, sometimes you make big ones.
This technique covers what you can do to help yourself out before
you make a big mistake (or think you may be headed down the path
towards a whopper) — a course of action that can save you both time
and aggravation in the long run.
What can you do when you make a big mistake? If you’ve been working
on an image for days or even a few hours, deleting the entire file is cer-
tainly out of the question. Thankfully, Photoshop comes with several
powerful tools and commands that you can use to prepare a safety net
for yourself.
Testing Techniques Using Duplicates
If you want to try out a technique that you’re not sure about — for
instance, you want to apply a filter to the red color channel, adjust the
curves of the blue channel, and then flatten all the layers and apply
another filter to the entire image — don’t mess around with your image
file; create a duplicate image and run tests on the duplicate. After you try
your test, if you like the effect you can then save the duplicate and con-
tinue to work on it, keeping the original image file as a backup. Or, if you
hate the effect you create, you can delete the duplicate and no harm done.
Creating a duplicate is simple:
1.
With the image file selected in the program window, choose
Image➪Duplicate.
The Duplicate Image dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-1.
2.
Enter a name for the duplicate in the As text box.
If your image contains layers and you want the duplicate image to
retain those layers, do not put a check mark in the Duplicate Merged
Layers Only check box. If you want the layers flattened in the duplicate
image, put a check mark in the check box.

Creating Backups
45
• Figure 7-1: Type a name for the duplicate image in the
text box.
3.
Click OK.
The duplicate image appears on-screen.
This duplicate image is not saved until you
save it by choosing File➪Save.
Using Revert and Undo
Revert and Undo are two simple little commands
that can help you out of a bind.
Everyone, of course, knows about unassuming little
Undo. Undo appears in almost every program there
is (frankly, I can’t think of a program that doesn’t
include Undo). 
You have to remember that Undo only moves you
back one step. If you apply a filter and then add a
Type layer, Undo removes the Type layer but not the
filter. (To go back more than one step, use the all-
powerful History palette as described later in
“Stepping Back with the History Palette.”)
But, Undo does work well for the quick one-step fix.
Choose Edit➪Undo or press Ctrl/Ô+Z to do the undo.
Revert is another simple command, but it can pack
a wallop. When you use revert by choosing File➪
Revert or pressing F12, Photoshop restores the image
file to its last saved version. Depending upon how
much you save a file as you work on it, this com-
mand can take you back one step or twenty steps.
Unfortunately, unless you keep mental track of when
you last saved the image, you might not know what
state the image will be in when you use Revert.
Using the History palette gives you an advan-
tage over using Revert. With the History
palette, you can revert to the original image
regardless of whether you saved along the
way. Revert reloads the last saved version,
which may include some undesireable
changes.
If you use Revert and then realize it was a mistake,
don’t worry! You can use Undo to remove the Revert
or use the History palette to move back because
Revert is recorded in the History palette.
Creating Backups
Another ally in the war against major catastrophe is
the backup. Using the Save As command, you can
save a copy of a file. Save As does more than create
identical copies; you can also use it to save a copy in
another color mode (for instance, create a copy in
CMYK color mode and keep the original in RGB color
mode) and another file format.
Here’s how to create a backup:
1.
Choose File➪Save As or press Ctrl+Shift+S/
Ô+Shift+S.
The Save As dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 7-2.
2.
Type a new name or modify the existing file
name in the File Name text box (Windows) or
Save As text box (Mac).
3.
Select a folder where you want to save the
backup.
4.
If you want, choose a different file format for
the backup using the Save As drop-down list
(Windows) or the Format pop-up menu (Mac).
If your image file contains layers and you
choose a file format that does not support lay-
ers, the Layers check box is grayed out and
the backup copy is automatically flattened.

In the Save and Color areas, select any options
that you need.
If you select the As a Copy option, the image
copy remains closed and the original remains
open. If you want to include a color profile with
the backup, select the Embed Color Profile
option (Mac) or Color: ICC Profile option
(Windows). (To find out how to create a color
profile, turn to Technique 4.)

Click Save.
If you click Save and you haven’t changed the
name of the backup copy from the original, the
Adobe Photoshop dialog box shown in Figure 7-3
appears.
• Figure 7-3: Photoshop warns you that you are going to
save the copy over the original file.
Click OK to save over the original file or click
Cancel to return to the Save As dialog box where
you can change the backup copy’s filename.
Stepping Back with 
the History Palette
The History palette is Photoshop’s amazingly power-
ful undo tool. With the History palette you can undo
up to 99 previous states. Each state is something that
you do that modifies the image, such as using a com-
mand or stroking in the image window with a brush.
The History palette records all your modifications
and keeps a running list of states. As you perform
each edit, Photoshop names the state and labels it
with a corresponding icon depending upon the tool
or command used.
• Figure 7-2: The Windows XP Save As dialog box (top) and
the Mac OS Save As dialog box.

Stepping Back with the History Palette
47
You can use the History palette to move back any
number of edits if you decide that you made a mis-
take. In addition, the History palette works with the
History Brush and Art History Brush, which you can
use to selectively restore areas to a prior state. (To
find out more about using the History Brush and Art
History Brush, turn to Technique 25.)
By default, the History palette is grouped with the
Actions palette at the right side of the Photoshop pro-
gram window. If you don’t see it, choose Window➪
History to display the palette, shown in Figure 7-4.
• Figure 7-4: The History palette records each action you
make, allowing you to return to any given
point in time.
Reverting to a previous state
When you discover that you’ve done something to
an image that you don’t like or didn’t intend, use the
History palette to step back in time as far as you
need to go.
Current state
Delete current state
History state
Create snapshot
Create new document
from current state
You can use the History palette in several different
ways to revert to a previous state:

Click a previous state on the History palette.

Drag the slider on the left side of the palette up
to the desired state.

Choose Step Backward from the History palette
menu to move back one history state. Keep
selecting this command to move back as many
states as you want.

Press Ctrl+Alt+Z/Ô+Option+Z to move back one
history state. Keep pressing this key combina-
tion to move back as many states as you need.
Taking snapshots
A snapshot is a special copy of a history state with an
important difference. Unlike a history state, which
can be deleted (because you reached the maximum
number of history states or the palette is cleared),
a snapshot remains in the History palette until the
image file is closed. When a file is closed, the snap-
shots are automatically deleted.
You can take a snapshot at any time you need.
Creating a snapshot before performing a long series
of edits or running an action is always a good idea.
You can select two automatic snapshot settings in
the History Options dialog box (see Figure 7-5). To
open the dialog box, choose History Options from
the History palette menu.
• Figure 7-5: Use the History Options dialog box to select
snapshot settings.

Technique 7: Moving Back in Time: Getting Rid of Mistakes
48
It’s time to get down to brass tacks, now. Taking a
snapshot is quite easy; just click the Create Snapshot
button at the bottom of the History palette. The new
snapshot appears at the top of the History palette
with a default name (something imaginative such
as “Snapshot 1”). You can rename the snapshot by
clicking the snapshot’s name, typing a new name,
and then pressing Enter/Return.
Another button on the History palette is very
handy: Create New Document from Current
State. Click this button to create a duplicate
image based on the history state currently
selected in the History palette. If you create a
document this way, remember that it’s not
saved until you press Ctrl+S/Ô+S.
If you find that you need to revert to the state that
you captured when you took the snapshot, click the
snapshot in the History palette. The image instantly
returns to that history state.
Here are the two settings:

If Automatically Create First Snapshot is selected,
Photoshop automatically takes a snapshot each
time an image file is opened. This setting is handy.
In case you come to some point of no return (for
instance, suppose you clear the History palette
by mistake so there’s no way to undo anything),
at least you have a snapshot of the image when
it’s first opened.

If Automatically Create New Snapshot When
Saving is selected, Photoshop automatically
makes a snapshot every time you save an image.
For me, this setting just doesn’t work out. I hit
Ctrl+S/Ô+S almost unconsciously, so I’d proba-
bly end up with 500 snapshots in the course of a
morning’s work. Snapshots take up memory, so I
leave this option unselected.

Creating 
Actions
W
hat happens when you want to repeat certain actions over and
over again? For instance, suppose you need to convert 50 images
from RGB to grayscale? Well, you could open every image and
then choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale 50 times, but that would take a
long time and be very tedious. Instead, you can record a mini-program,
known in Photoshop as an action, and play it, simultaneously applying
the action to the entire folder of 50 images. In a few seconds, an action
can perform the repetitive task that would take an hour.
Also, while actions are great for performing repetitive tasks, you can use
actions to automate any process you can come up with in Photoshop.
Suppose you create a cool effect that changes a regular old black letter B
into a stunning B that has the appearance of translucent liquid blue gel.
You can record the steps that create this effect, and then play them back,
instantly transforming any letters you want.
An action can consist of anything from a keyboard shortcut to a complex
series of commands that trigger other actions. You can create actions in
Photoshop or ImageReady. The Actions palette (see Figure 8-1) is used to
record, play, edit, save, delete, and load other actions. And, to make using
actions easier, you can assign keyboard shortcuts to them.
As shown in Figure 8-1, Photoshop comes with several actions already
loaded into the Actions palette. Some of these actions include Sepia
Toning (which re-colors a layer to look like it is sepia toned), Water
Reflection (which adds a wavy-looking reflection to type), and Vignette
(which creates a frame around a selection).
This technique takes you through the process of recording and playing
actions, as well as grouping the actions together into action sets. You also
find out how to load the extra action sets that ship with Photoshop and
where to find action sets available for download on the Web.

Button mode
Button mode hides all the commands within an
action and also hides the record/playback buttons
located at the bottom of the Actions palette when the
menu is viewed in Command mode. Button mode dis-
plays each action as a button, as shown in Figure 8-2.
• Figure 8-2: When the Actions palette displays in Button
mode, just click a button to play an action.
To play the action, just click the button. To view the
Actions palette in Button mode, open the Actions
palette menu and choose Button mode.
Command mode
While giving access to an action set so that you can
select and play it, Command mode also lets you view
and manipulate the commands within an action, and
gives access to the record/playback buttons at the
bottom of the Actions palette. 
By default, the Actions palette displays in Command
mode. If your Actions palette is displayed in Button
mode and you want to switch to Command mode,
make sure Button mode is unselected on the Actions
palette menu. Figure 8-3 shows the Actions palette
displayed in Command mode.
• Figure 8-1: Use the Actions palette to create actions,
mini-programs that can save you lots of
time and increase productivity.
Viewing Actions and 
Their Commands
You can view actions in the Actions palette in two
ways: Button mode and Command mode. Each mode
gives different access to actions and the commands
contained within an action. Button mode is the sim-
plest, displaying each action as a button, while
Command mode displays all the commands within
an action.

51
• Figure 8-3: Command mode gives access to all the
commands within an action.
To work with the commands in an action, you need
to view them. To do so, click the tiny right-pointing
arrow next to an action. The action expands, show-
ing the commands contained within the action in a
nested fashion.
Using Command mode, you can set how much of an
action plays back. If a command is within an action
that you don’t want to use, remove the check mark
from the left-most column next to the command.
Also, if you don’t want to play an action from the
beginning but want to start with a command within
the action, highlight the command within the action,
and then click Play. The action plays from the
selected command to its end.
Creating an Action Set
Notice in Figure 8-3 that actions are grouped together
in the Actions palette. This group is called an action
set. Action sets make organizing actions easy so that
you can quickly find the action you want to play.
To create an action set, follow these steps:
1.
If the Actions palette is not displayed in
Command mode, open the Actions palette
menu and deselect Button mode.
2.
Click the Create New Set button at the bottom
of the Actions palette.
The New Set dialog box appears.
3.
Enter the name for the action set.
4.
Click OK.
The new set appears in the Actions palette.
You can move action sets up or down the list
in the Actions palette the same way you can
restack layers in the Layers palette. Just drag
the action set up or down in the Actions
palette to its new position.
Recording an Action
When you create an action, the commands you
select are recorded. When you finish creating the
action, the commands appear in the Actions palette
indented under the action’s name.
1.
Open an image or create a new image.
You use this image to select the steps you want
recorded. If you’re not sure about all the steps you
want to record, you can always create a duplicate
of the image by choosing Image➪Duplicate, and
then practice on the duplicate image.
2.
If the Actions palette is not displayed in
Command mode, open the Actions palette
menu and deselect Button mode.
3.
Click the Create New Action button at the bot-
tom of the Actions palette.
In the New Action dialog box, shown in Figure 8-4,
enter a name for the action and assign a keyboard
shortcut for the action, if you want to. You can also
select a color for the action so that it appears in
your chosen color in the Actions palette.

2.
If the Actions palette is displayed in Command
mode, select the action you want to play, and
then click the Play button at the bottom of the
Actions palette.
If the Actions palette is displayed in Button
mode, click the action you want to play.
Try this with some of the actions that come with
Photoshop. Figure 8-5 shows two actions, Water
Reflection and Cast Shadow, applied to some type.
• Figure 8-5: You can use the actions that come with
Photoshop to enhance your images.
What can I record?
You can use many tools and palettes when recording an
action and a few that you cannot.
These items can be used when recording an action:

Tools: All selection tools, Crop, Eyedropper, Gradient,
Magic Eraser, Move, Notes, Paint Bucket, all shape
tools, Slice, all type tools.

Palettes: Actions, Channels, Color, History, Layers,
Paths, Styles, Swatches.
These items cannot be used when recording an action:

Tools: Blur, Brush, Burn, Clone Stamp, Dodge,
Pattern Stamp, Pencil, Sharpen, Sponge.

Commands found on the View and Window menus.
• Figure 8-4: Use the New Action dialog box to name the
action and assign a keyboard shortcut and
color for the action.
4.
Click Record to close the New Action dialog
box and start recording.
5.
Select the commands that you want to record,
applying them as you normally would.
If you enter values in text boxes, they are
recorded. If you cancel out of a dialog box, the
canceled item is not recorded. You cannot use
several tools when recording an action. Check
out the sidebar “What can I record?” to find out
which ones they are.
6.
When you finish applying commands, click the
Stop button on the Actions palette or press the
Esc key.
The recording stops and your custom action
appears in the Actions palette. If you look at your
action, all the commands that you recorded are
listed under the action’s name.
Playing an Action
After recording an action, you can then play it back
on an individual image file or a folder containing
many image files.
Playing an action on one image
1.
Open the image on which you want to play
the action.

Loading Action Sets
53
Before playing an action on an image file, cre-
ate a snapshot to save the way the image
looks (also called a state). If you don’t like the
effect the action has on the image, you can
then use the snapshot to revert to the earlier
state. To find out more about snapshots and
how to create them, turn to Technique 7.
Playing an action on a folder of images
1.
Move all the files to which you want to apply
the action to the same folder.
2.
Choose File➪Automate➪Batch or in the File
Browser choose Automate➪Batch.
The Batch dialog box, shown in Figure 8-6, opens.
Use this dialog box to select the folder where the
images are stored and the action you want to play.
3.
Select the action you want to play from the
Action drop-down list in the Play area.
4.
Select Folder from the Source drop-down list.
5.
Click the Choose button to select the folder
where the images are located.
6.
In the Destination drop-down list, select the des-
tination for the files after the action is played.
Use the Destination drop-down list to select
None, Save and Close, or Folder: 
 None leaves the images open in Photoshop
after the action is played. 
 Save and Close saves the images and then
closes them, leaving them in their original
folder.
 Folder saves the images after the action is
played in a new folder. If you select Folder,
click Choose to select the folder where you
want the images stored.
7.
Click OK to play the action and apply it to the
images in the selected folder.
• Figure 8-6: The Batch dialog box is used to select a folder
and an action.
Deleting an Action
After you finish using an action, you can quickly
delete it by dragging the action to the trashcan icon
at the bottom of the Actions palette. Actions can take
up a lot of memory, so do some housekeeping from
time-to-time and remove unnecessary action items.
Loading Action Sets
When Photoshop is installed, only one default action
set is loaded into the Actions palette. (It’s listed as
Default Actions.atn at the top of the Actions
palette.) Seven more libraries of action sets ship
with Photoshop.

Automating
Photoshop
Functions
T
his technique focuses on ways that you can modify batches of files
while letting Photoshop do (most of) the work for you. The big
time sink for you is setting up the automation. After you have the
automation in place, though, Photoshop can do the work in a matter of
seconds.
So, what can you automate? Using the tools included in Photoshop,
you can

Rename batches of files, saving the renamed files in the same folder as
the original files or a new folder.

Modify any number of images using actions that you record, and then
save the modified image files in the original folder or a new folder.

Create mini-programs called droplets that bring recorded actions to the
Windows or Mac desktop. From there, you drop selected files or a
folder of files on the droplet in order to play the action.
None of these features is very difficult to use. Working your way through
the various dialog boxes may take some figuring out the first time, but
when you’re familiar with the way each of these features works, setting
up automated processes in the future is really a snap.

To use the Batch Rename command, you have to use
the File Browser. If you aren’t familiar with the File
Browser, take a look at Technique 1 for a quick
refresher.
Here’s how to automate renaming files:
1.
Open the File Browser by clicking the Toggle
File Browser button on the Options bar or
choosing File➪Browse.
2.
Using the Folders palette, move to the folder
containing the files you want to rename.
When you select the folder, the image files dis-
play as thumbnails in the Preview pane.
3.
Select the image files you want to rename.
You can select individual files by clicking them in
the Preview pane or select an entire folder of
image files by selecting the folder in the Folders
palette.
4.
Choose Automate➪Batch Rename.
The Batch Rename dialog box, shown in Figure 9-1,
opens.
• Figure 9-1: You can select where the renamed files are
stored with the Batch Rename dialog box.
Programming Photoshop using scripts
For those of you who are interested in programming,
Photoshop can be customized using short programs or
scripts written in AppleScript, JavaScript, or Visual Basic. In
Photoshop 7, scripting was included as an optional plug-in
that needed to be installed. With Photoshop CS, scripting is
integrated into the program, so any system running
Photoshop CS supports scripting by default. 
If you decide to write scripts for the Mac exclusively, you
need to use AppleScript and a script editor. Both of these
come with Mac OS X and can be found in the Applications
folder. To find out more about AppleScript, check out
www.apple.com/applescript.
Windows users interested in writing scripts exclusively for
Windows machines can use Visual Basic or the Windows
Scripting Host. To download Windows Scripting Host, go to
www.msdn.microsoft.com/scripting.
Photoshop users who decide to create scripts for both the
Windows and Mac platforms can use JavaScript. In fact,
Photoshop includes a built-in cross-platform framework for
playing JavaScripts.
Four scripts are installed by default in Photoshop; access
them by choosing File➪Scripts. Photoshop also ships with
scripting manuals and many sample scripts written in the
three scripting languages. You can find these manuals and
scripts in the Scripting Guide folder of your Photoshop CS
installation.
Renaming a Bunch of Files
The Batch Rename command lets you rename any
number of files in one operation. You can rename a
few selected files, or rename an entire folder of files.
When renaming the files, you have the option of
leaving the files in their original folder or moving
them to a new folder. 
You can select up to six filenaming options when set-
ting how the files will be renamed. They include:

Three Document Name options that set whether
the file is renamed using upper- or lowercase
characters or a combination.

5.
In the Destination Folder area, select where the
renamed files are stored.
Select Rename in Same Folder to leave the files
in their current folder.
Select Move to New Folder to move the files to a
different location. If you select this option, click
the Browse button and use the Browse For Folder
dialog box, shown in Figure 9-2, to locate the
folder where the renamed files will be stored.
• Figure 9-2: Locate the folder where the renamed files will
be stored using the Browse For Folder dialog
box (Windows, top) or using the Choose a
Destination Folder dialog box (Mac, bottom).
6.
In the File Naming area, select the options that
you want to use to rename the image files.
Using the drop-down lists shown in Figure 9-3,
select up to six options.
If you select one of the Serial Letter/Number
options, enter the first number or letter in the
Starting Serial # text box (Photoshop automati-
cally counts up from there).
• Figure 9-3: In the File Naming area, select up to six
naming options.
7.
Put check marks in all Compatibility check
boxes.
This step ensures that the renamed files work on
any computer.
You cannot undo the file renaming after it is
completed, so make sure all your settings are
right before you click OK.
8.
Click OK.
Photoshop goes to work, and in the blink of an
eye, all the selected files are renamed.
Automating Image
Modifications
The Batch command modifies entire selected
images using actions that you create. Actions are
mini-programs that perform specific steps that you
record. Actions can automate almost any Photoshop
technique, such as applying filters, creating new
layers, deleting channels — you name it. To find
out how to create actions, turn to Technique 8.

this option, skip to Step 8.
 Save and Close: Select this option to save the
modified files and close them, leaving them in
their original folder. If you select this option,
skip to Step 8.
The Batch command, like its cousin the Batch
Rename command, gives you the option of leaving
the modified image files in the folder where they cur-
rently reside or moving them to a new folder. If you
choose to move the files to a new folder, you also
have the option of renaming the files using the exact
same options that the Batch Rename command
offers, including selecting up to six filenaming vari-
ables, such as adding the date, a serial number, or
serial letter.

Decide how you want errors handled by choos-
ing an option from the Errors drop-down list.
Sometimes errors occur when actions are played
on image files. For instance, the action specifies
a specific image size minimum and the image is
not large enough. 
 Select Stop for Errors from the Errors drop-
down list to halt the Batch command. A dialog
box displaying the error appears and the batch
operation is aborted; you need to set up the
entire batch process again.
 Select Log Errors to File to send error reports
to a text file. The batch processing continues
even if an error occurs. If you choose this
option, click the Save As button to set a folder
location and name for the error log text file.
9.
When you’re sure all the settings are correct,
click OK.
Photoshop goes to work processing the image
files using the action and settings you selected.
Working with Droplets
A droplet is an action that is encapsulated into an
executable program. You can put droplets directly
on your desktop or save them in a convenient folder.
If you drag an image file or a folder full of files over a
droplet, the droplet executes, playing the action on
the files. (If Photoshop isn’t open when the droplet
is activated, the droplet automatically opens
Photoshop.)
Because a droplet is a standalone program, you can
pass it to other Photoshop users and use it on other
computers, even cross-platform. 
If you create a droplet on a Windows com-
puter, it can be used by a Mac computer and
vice versa. All you need to do is convert it to
the right platform. To make a Mac-made
droplet usable with Windows, add an .exe
extension after the droplet’s name. To make a
Windows-made droplet work on the Mac,
locate the Photoshop CS application icon, and
then drag the droplet over it.
Creating a droplet
The first thing you need to do before creating a
droplet is to record the action that you will use when
creating the droplet. If you need a refresher on record-
ing actions, turn to Technique 8. After you record the
action, follow these steps to create a droplet:
1.
Choose File➪Automate➪Create Droplet.
The Create Droplet dialog box opens, as shown
in Figure 9-5. You use this dialog box to name the
droplet, set the location where the droplet is
saved, and set how files are handled when they
are modified by the droplet.

You can select from
 None: Select this option to leave the modified
image files open in Photoshop. If you select
this option, skip to Step 8.
 Save and Close: Select this option to save the
modified files and close them, leaving them in
their original folder. If you select this option,
skip to Step 8.
 Folder: Select this option to save the files and
move them to a new folder. If you select this
option, click Choose and use the Browse For
Folder dialog box (Windows) or Choose a
Destination Folder dialog box (Mac) to locate
the folder where you want to store the files.
Also, when you select Folder, you can also
rename the files. 
6.
In the File Naming area, select the options that
you want to use to rename the image files.
Using the drop-down lists, select up to six options
(refer to Figure 9-3).
If you select one of the Serial Number options,

Using a droplet
After you create a droplet, using it to modify batch-
es of files is simple. From your desktop, locate the
folder containing the droplet (if you haven’t placed
it on the desktop) and set that window aside. Next,
locate and select the files or folder of files that you
want to modify. Drag the selected files or folder on
top of the droplet. This action triggers the droplet
and it goes to work, modifying the files and saving
them in a new folder if you specified that when
creating the droplet.
Creating droplets in ImageReady
When working on Web graphics in Photoshop’s sister pro-
gram, ImageReady, you can create actions using com-
mands just like in Photoshop. But, you can also create
droplets that are used to help you quickly optimize Web
graphics, compressing them as much as possible for quick
downloading.

Importing Images
Using a Scanner
B
etter quality and good prices are making peripheral devices, such
as digital cameras and scanners, almost as common a household
appliance as toasters and blenders. (Actually I have two digital
cameras, two scanners, and only one toaster — go figure!) 
Only a few years ago scanners weren’t so commonplace and you had to
go to a service bureau. These days, scanning images such as photographs
is an everyday occurrence. This technique takes you through the world
of importing images using a scanner. You find out everything you need to
know about image resolution so that you can create scans that work for
your project — be it a Web page, a printed item such as a brochure, or a
high-end scan for offset printing. 
Then, you create a scan using the simple steps that I include in this tech-
nique. Scanning causes more headaches for people and I’ve heard so many
complaints about scans not working right that I want to help as much as I
can. Because so many different types of scanners exist, I try to make this
technique as generic as possible. You may find, however, a few differences
between my descriptions and what you experience with your device. 
You probably don’t want to hear it, but of course, the first thing you
really need to do is read the documentation that came with your scanner.
It may be a bit on the dry side, but knowing how your scanner works is
the first step on the way to getting great results with it.
What’s in a Pixel?
Creating excellent scans that work for your projects is all about resolu-
tion. And, resolution boils down to pixels. 
Here’s a quick pixel refresher. Pixels are the tiny colored dots that, put
together in an orderly grid, make up a Photoshop image. The display on
your computer monitor is also made up of pixels. The number of screen
pixels on your monitor depends on the display setting you’re using. For
instance, a typical setting is 1024 x 768, meaning 1,024 pixels run across

• Figure 10-1: Increasing the magnification makes an
image appear larger on-screen but doesn’t
affect the printed image.
• Figure 10-2: Check out the pixels: 96 ppi (top), 150 ppi
(left), and 300 ppi (right).
the screen and 768 pixels run down the screen.
Multiply them together and you get . . . well, you use
a calculator. These screen pixels are so tiny that you
may not be able to see them even if you flatten your
nose to the screen.
To get a look at image pixels more closely, open an
image in Photoshop and magnify it to 200%. (For a
refresher on zooming and magnifying images, turn to
Technique 5.) At 200% magnification, image pixels
are magnified to four times their previous size. One
image pixel now measures two screen pixels wide
and two screen pixels high and 2 x 2 = 4. Next, mag-
nify the image to 400%. That single image pixel is
now magnified to sixteen times its original size and
measures four screen pixels wide and four screen
pixels high (4 x 4 = 16). Take a look at Figure 10-1 to
see how different magnifications affect the appear-
ance of image pixels on-screen.
Magnifying an image in Photoshop has nothing to
do with the size at which an image prints — it only
affects how the image looks on-screen. To view an
image at its approximate print size, choose
View➪Actual Pixels.
The quality of the way an image looks on-screen and
on a printed page depends upon the resolution of the
graphic.
Images scanned for the Web need to be a resolution
different from images scanned for the printed page. A
typical PC monitor resolution is 96 pixels per inch (on
a Mac, it’s 72 ppi); this low resolution creates small
file sizes and images that work well for the Web. If
I print an image set at 96 ppi, it looks very pixilated,
as shown in Figure 10-2. The higher the resolution,
the finer and sharper a printed page looks. A typical
printed image is set at 300 ppi. Many home and office
printers offer resolutions upwards of 720 ppi or even
1200 ppi.
When you scan an image, you can use the scanner’s
software to set the resolution of the scan. Know
what you are using the scanned images for — the
Web or print — and set the resolution accordingly.

Scanning Images: Windows Users

Scanning Images: Windows Users
Depending upon your scanner, you may have two
import standards to choose from when scanning an
image on a Windows computer. One standard is
available on all scanners: TWAIN, a cross-platform
interface that ensures that the software you install
on your computer works correctly and consistently
when you use a peripheral device, such as a scanner.
The other standard, WIA, is a more recent develop-
ment from Microsoft and is installed with many
newer scanners. The WIA standard ensures that the
software installed on your computer uses the same
dialog boxes and interfaces that you typically see
in Windows XP. So, when you import images into
Photoshop using a scanner, you may see both of
these options on the Import menu. 
Which one should you use? Either standard gets you
to the scanning software installed on your computer.
The WIA interface inserts a few more dialog boxes
that allow you to select where to save scanned
images and gives you a little more control over color
management. Try both and see which one you prefer.
For me, I tend to use the WIA interface because of the
color management options. (To find out more about
color management and setting up a color manage-
ment system on your computer, turn to Technique 4.)
To scan and import an image using Windows, follow
these steps:
1.
Make sure your scanner is on and launch
Photoshop CS.
2.
Choose File➪Import to view the submenu
shown in Figure 10-3.
3.
Choose WIA Support from the submenu.
A WIA Support wizard opens. You can select a
peripheral device (see Figure 10-4). (Of course,
you can go with the TWAIN option if you want.
For this example, I use the WIA Support wizard.)
• Figure 10-3: The Import menu displays installed scanners
and lets you choose between the TWAIN
and WIA standards.

(see Figure 10-7). When you installed your scan-
ner software, chances are the software automati-
cally installed a color profile. This color profile
tells Photoshop what color space the scanner 
is working in and helps Photoshop adjust an
image’s colors as it is imported into Photoshop.
If the color correction works as it should, the
colors in the scanned image closely match 
the colors in the original photograph.
If a color profile is selected, skip to Step 12.
• Figure 10-6: Check out the properties for your scanner to
see if a color profile is loaded.

If you need to, click Add to load a color profile
for your scanner.
In the Add Profile Association dialog box that
then appears, use the list box to select the color
profile for your scanner. If you’re not sure which
profile is the right one for your scanner, check
the documentation that came with your scanner.
You don’t need to select a color profile every
time you use your scanner. You just need to
set this up the first time. In the future, you can

option automatically creates a folder within the
destination folder you specified in Step 4, and
places the scanned images in this sub-folder.

down list. I can use this drop-down list to select
the resolution I need, 96 ppi for Web graphics,
300 ppi for a typical printed page, 720 ppi or 1200
ppi for a fine photographic print. No doubt the
dialog box you’re using is different, but look
around. Somewhere a text box or drop-down list
is labeled Resolution.

The scanner’s dialog box closes and the scan
begins. The scanned image imports and opens in
Photoshop, as shown in Figure 10-9.

Follow the steps outlined by your scanner’s
software to import the image.
Don’t forget to set the resolution of your scan.
Select 96 ppi for Web graphics, 300 ppi for a typi-
cal printed page, or 720 ppi or 1200 ppi for a fine
photographic print.
When your scanner finishes acquiring the image,
the scanner’s dialog box closes and the scanned
image imports and opens in Photoshop.
Try scanning objects, too!
Try scanning objects and other items not normally used for
a scan. This can come in handy when trying to design
three-dimensional objects in Photoshop. For instance, if
you’re working on a project that includes cubes or spheres,
you can scan some blocks or balls to use as a pattern to
trace (see the following figure).

Scanning Images: Mac Users
Scanning images on a Mac is pretty straightforward.
Peripheral devices, such as scanners, use the TWAIN
compliant software to acquire images and import
them into Photoshop. TWAIN is a cross-platform
standard that ensures that the software you install
on your computer works correctly and consistently.
To find out more about the TWAIN standard, you can
visit www.twain.org.
To scan and import an image on a Mac, follow these
steps:

• Figure 10-11: Use your scanner’s software to select

Using Crop and 
Straighten Photos
If you scan more than one photo at a time, you can use
a new Photoshop CS command, Crop and Straighten
Photos, to separate the photos, crop them to their
edges, and then place them into their own image win-
dows. Most times Crop and Straighten Photos works
like a charm; but once in a while, it doesn’t divide two
photos correctly (probably because the photos are
too close together and the command can’t detect the
edges of the photos). Overall, though, this command
works pretty well and can be quite a time saver.
Here’s how to use this command:
1.
Scan several photos at once and import them
into Photoshop.
When the photos are imported into Photoshop,
they appear as one giant image (see Figure
10-12).
2.
Choose File➪Automate➪Crop and Straighten
Photos.
The command goes to work, separating and
cropping the photos. When it’s finished, all the
photos are in their own image windows (see
Figure 10-13). 
Some of the photos may need to be rotated.
Choose Image➪Rotate Canvas and choose the
correct rotation.
Even though the separated photos are in their
own image windows, they are not saved until
you press Ctrl+S/Ô+S.

Getting Professional
Results with the
Camera Raw Format
T
his technique dives into the world of photography exploring the
truly sensational Camera Raw capabilities built into Photoshop.
Introduced as a plug-in with Photoshop 7, the newly integrated
Photoshop CS Camera Raw format lets you open and professionally
process your digital negatives, which lets you set the tone, color, and
brightness of your photos without losing important image data. Also,
you get better resolution.
What you find in this technique is a discussion about Camera Raw, what
it is, and how it works in Photoshop. You use the extensive Camera Raw
interface built in to Photoshop to process your own digital photos, and
then save these new originals in specific file formats depending upon your
needs.
Getting to Know Camera Raw
It’s best to work with the Camera Raw features just like you would with a
traditional camera print. Traditional cameras use film that must be sent
to a photo lab for processing. Negatives are made from the film for each
picture. The photo lab creates prints by shining light through the negatives
onto light-sensitive photographic paper. The photographs may differ in
color, tone, and brightness depending upon how long the photographic
paper is exposed to light. But throughout the entire process, the negative
does not change. The prints are only affected by the amount of light pass-
ing through the negative.
Most digital cameras for consumers produce JPEG or TIF images. The
JPEG format uses lossy compression. This means that the compression
process that saves a JPEG photo can lose some of the data that makes up
the image, especially if you resave the image many times. Also, when an
image is saved in a format such as JPEG, the picture information is inter-
preted by the format, which automatically sets colors, tone, brightness,
and other parameters for the photo. In other words, you can never get
back to the naked image — the unaltered image that the camera captured.

Opening images directly from the camera
in Windows XP
Depending upon your camera, you may be able to open
photos directly from your camera without downloading
them first. With your camera connected to your computer,
choose File➪Open. Use the Look In drop-down list to
find My Computer and select it. Your camera should be
included in the list of drives and folders. Double-click the
camera icon to see the images currently saved in the camera.
The Camera Raw dialog box has a lot of options to
select from, but you don’t need to reset them every
time you open a raw image. The dialog box has what
is called sticky settings — it saves the settings that
you used last and opens with those settings selected.
After tweaking settings for your camera, you can
save the settings and apply them to other raw
images.
Histogram

Zoom box
Photo processing settings
Camera Raw format does not lose vital image infor-
mation, nor does it format the digital negative by
altering color, tone, or any other aspect of the photo.
Instead Camera Raw format saves the image data as
the camera captures it without further processing.
This raw image is saved on your hard drive. When
you open a Camera Raw photo in Photoshop, a copy
of the image is opened, not the original. You use
Photoshop’s built-in Camera Raw interface to process
the copied photo by adjusting exposure, tone, color,
and other settings, creating your own original. The
digital negative is never touched.
Digital photography has come a long way in the past
few years. Digital cameras have become more com-
mon and cameras with high-end features are becom-
ing more affordable. You can set many of these
cameras to save photos in either JPEG or Camera
Raw format. Camera manufacturers that make cam-
eras with the Camera Raw features include Canon,
Fujifilm, Leaf, Minolta, Nikon, and Olympus. To find
out whether your camera can use Photoshop’s
Camera Raw features, go to www.adobe.com/products/
photoshop/cameraraw.html for a complete list of the
cameras supported by Photoshop CS’s Camera Raw
interface.
Using the Camera Raw
Interface
When you’re ready to open a Camera Raw image,
double-click the image in the File Browser or choose
File➪Open and use the Open dialog box. The Camera
Raw file format extension is .crw.
Whichever way you decide to open the image, the
image automatically opens in the Camera Raw dialog
box, as shown in Figure 11-1. 

Using the Camera Raw Interface

The rest of this section walks you through the many
features and settings available in the Camera Raw
dialog box. You can use as many or as few of these
settings as you need to get the results you want. If
you need a specific setting, just skip to the topic that
covers it.
Looking at the features
Before you do anything, take a look around the dia-
log box. Notice that the camera type, filename, and
camera settings such as F-stop, exposure time, and
lens diameter are listed in the Title bar of the dialog
box (see Figure 11-2).
• Figure 11-2: The Title bar lists camera information as well
as the image’s filename.
Do yourself a favor and rename 
your digital photos
Have you noticed how inscrutible digital photo filenames
are? Take CRW267_0359.CRW for instance. You would never
know that this picture is of seashells.
Every time you take a camera load of pictures and down-
load them, do yourself the favor of renaming them while
you still know what they are. Put them in a folder with the
day’s date or a quick descriptive word, whatever. You’ll thank
yourself two weeks later when you’re looking for that great
surf photo you took. For a look at renaming files in batches,
turn to Technique 9.
The image itself is viewed in a large Preview pane.
The Preview pane is dynamic, so every time you
make a setting change, the preview updates to let
you see what you’ve done.
Also, notice that three tools are at the upper left
as shown in Figure 11-2: the Zoom, Hand, and
Eyedropper tools. As you may have guessed, the
Zoom tool is for magnifying the image and the Hand
tool is for moving the image around in the Preview
pane. The Eyedropper tool (actually called the White
Balance tool in this dialog box) is for setting the
options that compensate for various lighting condi-
tions. I discuss its use later in the section “Setting
adjustment options.”
The lower-left area of the dialog box contains four
drop-down lists that you can use to set color space,
resolution, and size. I discuss these drop-down lists
in the section “Setting resolution and color space.”
Below the OK and Cancel buttons at the upper-right
area of the dialog box are two radio buttons: Basic
and Advanced. When you select the Basic radio
button, only the Adjust and Detail tabs show in the
Settings area. If you select the Advanced radio but-
ton, you have access to two more tabbed panels of
settings, Lens and Calibrate. 
Underneath the Basic and Advanced radio buttons
is a histogram, shown in Figure 11-3. This histogram
shows a combined RGB histogram in white and sepa-
rate red, green, and blue histograms (one for each
color channel). The histogram shows the range of
color values in the image.
• Figure 11-3: The Histogram determines the range for
each color channel.
Setting resolution and color space
At the bottom left of the Camera Raw dialog box are
four drop-down lists (see Figure 11-4). You can set
resolution, image size, bit-depth, and the color space.
(Bit-depth is the amount of color information in a
pixel.) Here’s a description of each option and
possible settings.

Technique 11: Getting Professional Results with the Camera Raw Format
76
Some typical bit-depth values are 1-bit, 8-bit, and 
16-bit. For example, a 1-bit pixel has two possible
color values, black and white. An 8-bit pixel has 256
possible color values, and a 16-bit pixel has 65,536
possible color values.
Because Photoshop CS now has the ability to work
with 16-bit color images (Photoshop 7 does not), it’s
up to you to choose the bit-depth you want to use.
The only word of caution is that when you select a
greater bit-depth, invariably file size goes up.
Size
The Size drop-down list gives you some image size
options in pixels. The image size selected by default
in the drop-down list is the size at which your cam-
era captured the image. You can scale up or down
depending upon your needs.
Scaling up can have some consequences.
Because a larger image needs more pixels,
Photoshop adds those pixels to the image, col-
oring them by selecting color from surround-
ing pixels. The resulting image can look fuzzy,
not clear and sharp like the original.
Resolution
The Resolution text box and drop-down list let you
set how many pixels per inch (ppi) (or pixels per
centimeter) your image has. A higher resolution
makes for a crisper-looking printed page. Typically,
a better digital camera captures Camera Raw images
at 240 ppi or greater. (By comparison, the same cam-
era saves the image at 180 ppi when the image is
saved as a JPEG.) A good setting for Web graphics
and images is 96 ppi.
Setting adjustment options
The Adjust tab panel at the right of the dialog box
lets you set the White Balance, Exposure, Shadows,
Brightness, Contrast, and Saturation by using slider
bars (see Figure 11-5).
• Figure 11-4: These drop-down lists are used to set the
photo’s resolution and color space.
Color space
The Space drop-down list sets the color space. The
color space is the range of the color spectrum (also
called gamut) in which a device, such as a monitor
or digital camera, works. (For more about color
spaces and color management systems, take a look
at Technique 4.)
You can choose from four options in the Space drop-
down list:

Adobe RGB (1998): This color space offers the
widest range of colors. Adobe RGB is a good
choice for high-quality digital photographs. I
usually select this color space.

ColorMatch RGB: Many publishers and commer-
cial printers use this color space. If you are creat-
ing photos for offset printing, check with your
printer to see whether this color space is the one
to use.

ProPhoto RGB: Kodak created this color space
for its high-end professional digital cameras.
ProPhoto RGB offers a wider range of colors than
the other color spaces, but should only be used
with Kodak cameras.

sRGB IEC61966-1: Also called sRGB for short
(for standard RGB), this color space offers a
smaller range of colors and is a good choice for
Web graphics.
Depth
The Depth drop-down list offers two bit-depth
options: 8 Bits/Channel and 16 Bits/Channel. The 
bit-depth is the amount of color information in a pixel,
per channel. The more bit-depth that an image has,
the more colors are available. So, the higher the bit-
depth, the more accurate the color representation is
on-screen and the printed page.

Using the Camera Raw Interface

• Figure 11-5: The Adjust tab panel lets you adjust the
lighting quality and tonal values.
White Balance
White Balance describes the lighting conditions in a
photograph and how the eye perceives them. 
The White Balance area contains two slider bars:
Temperature and Tint. Temperature (actually
expressed in Kelvin) attempts to reproduce light’s
actual color. At lower Temperature settings, a photo
appears more cyan; at higher Temperature settings, a
photo appears more yellow. The Tint slider bar
adjusts the light quality. Lower Tint settings are
bluish, while higher Tint settings are redder.
Another feature is the White Balance drop-down list
with preset lighting configurations that attempt to
re-create different types of light, such as daylight, fluo-
rescent lighting, and flash. Figure 11-6 shows the avail-
able options on the White Balance drop-down list.
• Figure 11-6: The White Balance drop-down list and sliders
set lighting quality.
Exposure and shadows
The Exposure slider controls highlights, while the
Shadows slider controls the shadows (of course!). 
When the Exposure slider is dragged left, fewer high-
lights appear in the photo. Drag the Exposure slider
to the right and more highlights appear.
To decrease the amount of shadows, drag the
Shadow slider to the left. Drag to the right to
increase shadows.
Hold down the Alt/Option key while using
either of these slider bars to see a threshold
view of the image. This threshold view is
handy for finding the lightest and darkest
areas of an image, and determining whether
any shadows or highlights are getting lost (or
clipped).
Brightness, contrast, and saturation
The Brightness, Contrast, and Saturation sliders are
pretty self-explanatory; they do what they say. If you
need more brightness, contrast, or saturation correc-
tion after opening the image in Photoshop, you can
use the commands on the Image➪Adjustments menu.
Adding detail
The Detail tab panel offers three slider bars:
Sharpness, Luminance Smoothing, and Color Noise
Reduction, as shown in Figure 11-7.

Technique 11: Getting Professional Results with the Camera Raw Format
78
• Figure 11-8: The Lens tab panel helps you correct color
and shadow problems created by the camera
lens.
Fixing chromatic aberrations
The Chromatic Aberration R/C slider (R/C stands for
Red/Cyan) and Chromatic Aberration B/Y slider (B/Y
stands for Blue/Yellow) corrects color problems at
the edges of a digital photograph. Sometimes the
colors at the edges of a photograph don’t line up,
causing what is called fringing. This fringing can cre-
ate a colored halo effect that is very subtle. To see
whether your photo has fringing, you need to zoom
in on one of the edges of your photo at the highest
magnification, 400%. Slide the Chromatic Aberration
sliders back and forth to test how this fringing looks.
Return the sliders to a position where you don’t see
any color halos.
• Figure 11-7: The Detail tab panel adjusts your photos’
sharpness and reduces noise.
The Sharpness settings in the Camera Raw interface
work pretty well. Usually, I do 10% of the sharpening
here and the rest in Photoshop using the powerful
Unsharp Mask. (Take a look at Technique 37 for tips
on using the Unsharp Mask.)
The Luminance Smoothing and the Color Noise
Reduction controls remove noise from your photos.
When you use these sliders, the Camera Raw inter-
face tries to keep as much sharpness on the edges as
possible, but if you go too far, the photo can become
a bit fuzzy. Use these settings with a light touch.
Adjusting lens irregularities
You can view the Lens tab panel (shown in Figure
11-8) only if you first select the Advanced radio but-
ton. The Lens tab panel is used to correct lens condi-
tions that create problems with color focus.

sliders correct another lens defect where the cor-
ners of the photograph are darker than the center
(see Figure 11-9).
• Figure 11-9: Shadowy vignettes at a photo’s edges (top)
is a problem created by the lens that
Photoshop can correct (bottom).
The Vignetting Amount slider corrects the bright-
ness at the corners of the photo. Moving the slider
to the left darkens the corners, while moving the
slider to the right brightens the corners.
The Vignetting Midpoint slider adjusts how the
brightness moves from the center of the photo to
the edges. When you move this slider to the left, the
photo appears brighter in the center and darker at
the edges. As you move the slider right, the bright-
ness spreads to the photo’s edges.
Calibrating color and tone
You can see the Calibrate tab panel only if the
Advanced radio button is selected. This tab panel,
shown in Figure 11-10, sets color and tone by adjust-
ing the color cast in shadowed areas and using the
red, green, and blue channels.
• Figure 11-10: The sliders on the Calibrate tab pane adjust
color and tone.
Adjusting the color tone of shadows
The Shadow Tint slider works with the White Balance
value set on the Adjust tab panel. After a white bal-
ance is set, a tinted colorcast can still remain in the
shadowed portions of a photo. Move the slider left
to increase the greenish cast of shadows; move the
slider right to make the shadows redder. If you hold
down the Alt/Option key while moving the slider, a
threshold view of the shadows in the image indi-
cates whether some shadowed areas are getting lost.

Using Tablets and
Pressure-Sensitive
Devices
W
hether you’re a Photoshop professional or hobbyist, you may
find yourself wishing, at times, for a better or easier input device
than a mouse. Some folks that I’ve spoken with consider drawing
with a mouse like trying to draw with a chunk of wood or a bar of soap.
A drawing tablet and pen (also called a stylus) can be an answer for those
artists who want a more reality-based drawing experience. (See Figure
12-1.) Using a tablet and stylus feels much closer to sketching with a tra-
ditional pencil or pen than using a mouse on a mouse pad does.
• Figure 12-1: A drawing tablet and stylus can easily double your output and
increase the overall speed and quality of your Photoshop work.
A drawing tablet and stylus can be used anytime that you need to per-
form some type of painting or stroking. This includes using any of the
brush tools, Dodge and Burn tools, Eraser tools, Pen tools, Stamp tools,
Healing Brush and Patch tools, and selection tools. (Did I miss anything?)
As you can see, virtually every tool can be used when drawing or editing
with a stylus.

their added levels of sensitivity (1024 compared to
other manufacturers’ 512) and their tilt capabilities.
(When you’re drawing with a Wacom stylus, the width
of the stroke can vary depending on the angle or tilt
at which you hold the pen.) Also, all Wacom tablets
are Windows and Mac compatible. However, pick a
tablet based on your needs and your pocketbook.
Super-sensitivity may not be something you need,
and a $130 tablet is a lot less expensive than one
that sells for $549.
Another question that comes up when considering
tablets is which size should you buy? Tablets come
in a range of sizes including 4 x 5, 6 x 8, 9 x 12, and
12 x 18 inches. Consider the type of work that you
do, how big your strokes tend to be when drawing,
and the size of your monitor. If you have a small
monitor and buy a large tablet, you’ll be all over the
monitor in no time; or if you have a large monitor
and buy a small tablet, you may find that you use up
the tablet area before you’ve touched half the avail-
able monitor area. I have a 21-inch monitor and use
a 9-x-12-inch tablet. They work together really well.
Most of the time, I don’t use the entire tablet area,
but when I get painting, my strokes can get quite
large and I don’t run out of room on the bigger tablet.
Saving the pain!
When you’re editing and working on images in Photoshop,
hours can go by like nothing. (You may at some point think,
“Wait a minute! I’m sure I looked at the clock only a few
minutes ago, but the clock says it’s been two hours!”) Cricks
in the neck and aching arms are standard territory for many
graphic artists. Some people use a stylus instead of a mouse
because of arm fatigue or carpal tunnel syndrome. Instead
of having to move the cursor by dragging a mouse around,
you can just point and tap. This avoids the excessive wrist
and arm mousing motions that can lead to pain.
Configuring a Tablet
After you buy a tablet and get started with it, you
need to configure its settings. Selecting settings
isn’t a one-time thing, however. As you work with
the tablet and stylus, you get used to the feel and
possibly will need to modify settings.
Another feature of a tablet and stylus is the pressure
sensitivity that enables you to draw more realisti-
cally. With different strokes, you can create lines that
are thicker or thinner, more opaque or translucent,
depending on the amount of pressure that you use
as you drag the stylus across the tablet.
But, before you go off and buy a tablet, take one out
for a test drive. Find a friend who has a tablet, bring
some coffee and muffins, and doodle for an hour. Or
go to your local computer store and check out the
tablet display. Don’t expect great results right from
the start when drawing with a stylus. The feel is dif-
ferent from a traditional pencil on paper. Although the
stylus feels more like a traditional pen or pencil, the
tablet doesn’t feel like paper. Artists who are used to
working with traditional media will need to get used
to this. You need to practice and practice, and then
practice some more to find out how you like to work
with a tablet, what brush settings you like, how hard
you like to press, and many other factors.
If you’re used to drawing with pencil and
paper and find the tablet surface too smooth
and slippery, tape a piece of your regular
drawing paper to the tablet and use the stylus
to draw on top of that. The grain and rough-
ness of the paper can make you feel right at
home and give you more control.
After I purchased my first tablet, hooked it up
to my computer, and got used to working
with it, I couldn’t believe how fast I could
work! My output per hour doubled at the
least. Also, after intense sessions that would
last for hours, my hand wasn’t stiff or sore. If
you get the chance, try out a tablet. You really
might like it.
When buying a tablet, one big question is which
one? Several tablet manufacturers exist, including
AIPTEK, GTCO CalComp Inc., Summagraphic, and
Wacom. Most of these include Windows and Mac
drivers, but some only include Windows drivers
(sorry Mac users). The best known of these com-
panies is Wacom. Wacom’s tablets are generally con-
sidered the best artistic input devices because of

Some settings that need to be configured include
how fast you tap the pen to set up a double-tap
(which works just like the double-click on a mouse),
pressure-sensitivity, and mapping (the amount of
tablet area that is used to cover the monitor area).
Typically, you can find the applet that’s used to con-
figure the tablet on the Start➪All Programs menu
(Windows) or Applications/Wacom (Mac). Figure 12-2
shows a Wacom Tablet configuration screen.
• Figure 12-2: This is the Windows configuration dialog box
for the Wacom Intuos 2 tablet.
The following two sections show you how to config-
ure double-taps and pen pressure. Depending on the
type of tablet and stylus that you own, you probably
need to set up some other features. If you need help
setting up these features, take a look at the documen-
tation that came with the tablet, or choose Help in
the tablet’s configuration dialog box.
Setting double-tap speed
To access stylus features in the configuration dialog
box, you need to tap the stylus on the tablet to let
the configuration program know that the stylus is
active. When you do, several tab panels that are
used to set up stylus features appear in the config-
uration dialog box shown in Figure 12-3.
• Figure 12-3: Tap your tablet to access tab panels for stylus
features.
Here’s how to set up your double-tap:
1.
Click the Double Click tab to access that panel.
2.
In the Automatic area, double-tap the bull’s eye.
The tablet configuration program automatically
adjusts the Set Double-Click Speed slider to how
fast you tap.
3.
In the Test area, double-tap the bull’s eye to con-
firm that the double-tap speed is set correctly.
If your confirmation double-tap matches the set
speed, you get a thumbs-up. (See Figure 12-4.)
4.
Click OK to close the configuration dialog box
and save your settings.
Setting pen pressure
Pen pressure settings should be adjusted as you get
used to using the tablet. When you first start using a
tablet, you may find yourself pressing harder than
you normally would with pencil and paper. Then, as
you grow more comfortable using the tablet, your
maximum pressure evens out to what’s comfortable
for your hand. Here’s how:
1.
Click the Tip Feel tab to view that tab panel.

Getting Started with
Your Tablet
So how do you start practicing with a tablet? When
you consider how many brushes and brush settings
are available, it can be a bit overwhelming.
Simple is best. Select a medium-size brush — say
about 20 pixels in diameter, with a hardness setting
of 100 percent. Stick to black and white for now.
Create a new white canvas by choosing File➪New,
and then doodle! Draw circles and rectangles, and
get a feel for how the stylus moves on the tablet
surface.
After you get comfortable using a simple brush, start
experimenting with the brush combinations in the
Brushes palette. Many settings use pressure sensitiv-
ity and pen tilt to shape brush strokes. I discuss cre-
ating brushes and selecting pressure-sensitive brush
settings in detail in Technique 23.
nik multimedia penPalette
nik multimedia offers some great filters and plug-ins that
extend the capabilities of Photoshop. penPalette is an excel-
lent program that lets you set up filter effects such as color,
tone, and noise by using custom dialog boxes (shown in
the following figure). Then, using your tablet and stylus, you
can brush the effects on in the areas where you want them.

ave printer, will print, right? Well, maybe. When everything is work-
ing correctly, printing is easy and you get the results that you want.
When something is out of whack — for instance, your image reso-
lution is low so you end up with pixilated output or the color you see on
the monitor does not match the printed page — things can get a little out
of hand.
This technique covers the easy aspects of printing and the not-so-easy
aspects, like the gnarly glitches that lead to headaches and hair pulling.
First, you find out how image resolution relates to the printed page. Next,
you discover how to set a default printer and set printer-specific options.
Then, you take a look at paper options and other printing options avail-
able to you in Photoshop. The end of this technique covers the three
commands that you can use to print your images. By the way, if you’re
preparing artwork for a commercial printer, turn to Technique 14, where
you can find much of the information that you need to make your offset
printing project a success.
Resolving Resolution: Getting the 
Apples and Oranges to Line Up
Sometimes when Photoshop users print an image that they’ve been work-
ing on, they’re upset that the printed image doesn’t look like the image on
the monitor. The printed image looks jaggy or pixilated. When comparing
an on-screen image to the image on the printed page, it’s like comparing
apples and oranges: The screen image is composed of square pixels and
the printed image is composed of tiny round dots, and (here’s the impor-
tant part) both devices deliver high-quality images at different resolutions.
Pixels are the tiny squares that make up Photoshop images. Pixels are
very small and when viewed from a distance, the colors in these tiny
pixels combine to make up the image you see. Image resolution on the
screen is discussed by using the term pixels per inch or ppi. Typical Web

• Figure 13-1: The same image saved at 72 ppi (top),
150 ppi (middle), and 300 ppi (bottom).
graphics are saved at 72 or 96 ppi. (A Mac monitor’s
normal ppi is 72 and a PC monitor’s maximum ppi
is 96.) All the images that you create in Photoshop
look great at 100% magnification on the monitor at
96 ppi.
Printed images, on the other hand, are created
with tiny round dots of ink or toner. Image resolu-
tion for the printed page is discussed in dots per
inch or dpi. A square inch removed from an image
printed at 96 dpi contains 96 tiny dots across and 96
tiny dots down, making 9,216 dots in that one-inch
area. A square inch removed from an image printed
at 300 dpi contains 300 dots across and 300 dots
down, for a total of 90,000 dots per square inch. As
you can imagine, having more dots packed into an
inch of printed area makes for a smoother-looking
image. A typical LaserJet prints good-quality images
at 300 dpi. Many home printers even go as high as
720 dpi. Commercial imagesetters can print images
at 1200 dpi, 2400 dpi, and up.
Take a look at Figure 13-1. I saved the same image at
three different resolutions. Check out how the differ-
ent resolutions look on the printed page.
So, where does this leave you when you want to
make great prints? First off, look at the documenta-
tion that came with your printer and find out what
the maximum resolution output is for the printer.
Next, choose Image➪Image Size to open the Image
Size dialog box shown in Figure 13-2.
Take a look at the Resolution text box in the
Document Size area. What does it say — 72 ppi,
96 ppi, 150 ppi, or 300 ppi? If you’re at the upper
end (250 ppi or 300 ppi) your image will, most likely,
print well and look pretty good. If your image is at
the lower end, say 100 ppi, you’re going to have prob-
lems with dots and jaggies. You need to spend a little
time experimenting with printing your image at dif-
ferent resolutions to see what kind of results you can
get with your printer. (Also, some printers need spe-
cial paper to create quality images. If you’re printing
on standard office paper, chances are that you’re not
going to get very good results.)

Resolving Resolution: Getting the Apples and Oranges to Line Up
89
• Figure 13-2: Use the Image Size dialog box to find out
the resolution of your image.
If you need to change the resolution of your image to
make it look better in print, you can do it in one of
two ways — by using the Image Size dialog box shown
in Figure 13-2 or by using Photoshop’s Print Preview
feature. The Image Size dialog box gives you more
control over the exact resolution, whereas the Print
Preview dialog box lets Photoshop come up with the
resolution based on the scaling size that you select.
To set a new resolution by using the Image Size dia-
log box:
1.
With the image open in Photoshop, choose
Image➪Image Size to open the Image Size
dialog box shown in Figure 13-2.
2.
Enter a value in the Resolution text box in
either pixels per inch or pixels per centimeter.
Here’s another way to let Photoshop help you
out. In the Image Size dialog box, click Auto
to open the Auto Resolution dialog box shown
in Figure 13-3. Enter a line screen setting of
133 lines per inch (or 52 lines per centimeter),
and then select a Quality radio button to define
the output quality that you want. Click OK to
close the Auto Resolution dialog box and
return to the Image Size dialog box. Based on
your selections in the Auto Resolution dialog
box, Photoshop calculates the resolution that
it thinks will work best and enters it in the
Resolution text box. Try printing with this res-
olution and see if the results work for you.
• Figure 13-3: Use the Auto Resolution dialog box to let
Photoshop calculate a resolution for you.
3.
Optional: Uncheck the Resample Image
check box.
If you turn off this option, Photoshop doesn’t
add or subtract pixels (depending on whether
you are increasing or decreasing the resolution).
Photoshop leaves the pixels intact and changes
only how many pixels print per inch. (Test this
and see if it works for your printer.)
4.
Click OK.
The Image Size dialog box closes and Photoshop
adjusts the resolution of your image. Now you’re
ready to make a test print and see if the image
prints to your satisfaction.
If you find that the resolution you set doesn’t
work, you can always return to the original
resolution by using the History palette to
select a history state before the resolution
change. To find out more about the History
palette, turn to Technique 7.
To let Photoshop set the resolution by using Print
with Preview:
1.
With the image open in Photoshop, choose
File➪Print with Preview.
In the Print dialog box that opens (see Figure
13-4), use the Scaled Print Size area of the dialog
box to set the size of the image on the printed
page.

Or, if the printer that you want to use is not installed,
you can install the printer drivers that you need.
What you’re doing when you install a printer on your
computer is actually installing printer drivers, the
software that tells Windows or Mac OS, the printer,
and Photoshop how to translate your images from
the computer to the printed page. Normally, you
want to select a printer that’s directly hooked up to
your computer or available via a network. However,
if you’re preparing artwork for commercial printing
and the printing company has asked that you select
a high-end printer such as an imagesetter, you can
install printer drivers even if that printer isn’t con-
nected to your computer.
To select a default printer in Windows XP, use the
following steps:
1.
Choose Start➪Printers and Faxes to open
the Printers and Faxes dialog box shown in
Figure 13-5.
• Figure 13-5: Windows XP users can set a default printer
with the Printers and Faxes dialog box.
2.
Right-click the printer that you want to use as
your default printer and select Set as Default
Printer from the context-sensitive menu, as
shown in Figure 13-6. 
If you want to install a new printer, click Add a
Printer in the Printer Tasks area at the left of the
Printers and Faxes dialog box, and then follow
the Add Printer Wizard directions.
• Figure 13-4: Use the Scaled Print Size area to let
Photoshop figure out the resolution.
2.
Enter a percentage in the Scale text box, select
the Scale to Fit Media check box, or enter actual
printed dimensions in the Height and Width
text boxes.
Percentages in the Scale text box work just
like percentages when zooming in and out in
Photoshop. 100% scale prints the image at
actual size, 200% scale prints the image at
twice its actual size, and 50% scale prints the
image at half its actual size.
By changing the scale of the image in the Print
Preview dialog box, you’re only changing the
size of the printed image, not the size of the
actual image.
Scaling the printed image greater than 100%
lowers image resolution, and scaling the image
below 100% increases resolution.

Click Print to continue with the printing
process.
Selecting a Printer
The first step on the path to printing nirvana is
to pick the printer that you’re going to use. The
process is a little different for Windows and Mac
users, though it all boils down to selecting a cur-
rently installed printer as your default printer.

Scale (Mac OS X only): You can enter a percent-
age in the scale text box to change the size of the
printed image. Although this feature does work,
it depends on the printer to do the scaling, not
Photoshop. So if you want to change the printed
size of your image, you’re better off using the
Scaled Print Size area in the Print dialog box
accessed by choosing File➪Print with Preview,

Let It Rip: Printing Those Pages
After you do all the legwork — you set image resolu-
tion, selected a printer, set paper size and orienta-
tion, and selected all the printing options you need —
you’re ready to print. This all may seem like a ton of
work (actually, it is!) but, after you select the set-
tings that you need, you don’t have to select them
again. Photoshop remembers your settings for you.
So, from here on out, you can just flat out print your
images or perform a few minor tweaks if you have a
special image. (For instance, you might need to
change the scale of the printed image.)

• Figure 13-11: This Print dialog box is used to set printer
options and how many copies are printed.
Photoshop, being the versatile and deep program
that it is, offers not one but three commands that
you can use to print your image. They’re listed here,
from the simplest bare bones command to the one
that offers the most options:

Choose File➪Print One Copy or press Alt+Ctrl+
Shift+P/Option+Ô+Shift+P to print (you guessed
it) one copy of your image without having to click
Print in any dialog boxes. This option automati-
cally uses the printer and paper options that you
selected by using the Page Setup and Print with
Preview commands earlier in this technique.

Choose File➪Print or press Ctrl+P/Ô+P to open
the simple Print dialog box shown in Figure 13-11.
You can use this dialog box to have one last
chance at selecting a printer and setting printer-
specific options. In addition, you can choose
whether the entire image or just a selected area
of the image prints and how many copies are
printed. Click OK to print.

Choose File➪Print with Preview to open the
Print dialog box that contains all the possible
printing options in Photoshop. (Refer to Fig-
ure 13-10.) After you select the options that you
need, click Print. The Print dialog box opens
(see Figure 13-11), giving you a last chance to
select printer settings. Click OK to print.

Getting Files Ready
for Offset Printing
P
hotoshop includes many high-end features that let users create
professional-quality separations for high-quality offset printing.
Typically, you create your Photoshop projects in RGB (red, green,
blue) color mode; this is based on the colored light projected by your
monitor. Commercial printing presses use a different color mode, CMYK
(cyan, magenta, yellow, black), based on the inks used by the presses.
Converting RGB images to CMYK mode and getting the printed results to
match your monitor can be a time-consuming and sometimes frustrating
process.
Using the tools included with Photoshop, you can cut down on the frus-
tration by selecting CMYK prepress settings provided by your commer-
cial printer, and soft proofing your project files — previewing a fairly
accurate approximation of the printed image on-screen. In addition, you
can check the colors in your image to make sure they are all printable.
Out-of-gamut (non-printable) colors can then be corrected before your
project goes out the door.
This technique walks you through the world of offset printing and prepar-
ing files for high-end output. You find out how to select color settings
based on printing press settings, convert the image to CMYK mode, soft
proof your project, and add printer’s marks. From there, you find out
what spot colors are and how you can use them to give your projects
real visual punch.
Although some folks might find this all a bit daunting, don’t worry! I
explain everything as simply as possible, and if you follow the step-by-
step directions, you shouldn’t have trouble — even if you’ve never
worked with a commercial printer before.

Talk to the commercial printer or
service bureau first!
Many commercial printers and service bureaus use
Photoshop, so they may ask for regular Photoshop PSD files.
To ensure that your files work for the printer or service
bureau, talk to them first. They’ll tell you what printer to spec-
ify, which printer’s marks to select, and any other special-
ized output settings that should be used. If this is too much
for you to deal with, many printers and service bureaus will
even take your completed Photoshop files and perform any
conversions or add the necessary output settings for you.
Working with CMYK
Computer monitors display color by blending red,
green, and blue light; this is called RGB color mode.
You typically use RGB mode when working on proj-
ects in Photoshop. Printing presses create color by
blending cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks; this
color mode is called CMYK. Because RGB mode and
CMYK mode create color in such different ways —
one uses lights in three colors, and the other uses
inks in four colors — it’s very hard to convert colors
exactly from RGB to CMYK and get the results that
you want. However, Photoshop’s color manage-
ment system helps with the conversion by letting
you select standard printing setups, and proofing
the settings by printing a color proof and matching
it to the proof on-screen.
Here’s a checklist that you need to follow when work-
ing on a project that will end up as CMYK separa-
tions, ready for offset printing:
1.
Make sure that your monitor is correctly cali-
brated. (See Technique 4.)
2.
Convert your RGB image to CMYK color mode.
3.
Call your commercial printer and get the cus-
tom CMYK settings for the printing press and
paper type you’re using.
Different types of paper absorb ink in different
ways, so the amount of ink used needs to be
adjusted depending on the paper.
How Offset Printing Works
When you prepare a project, such as a brochure,
poster, book, and so on, for commercial printing, you
need to work with a commercial printer and possibly
a service bureau.
Traditionally, a service bureau uses your prepared
Photoshop files to either print the image with a high-
resolution printer, giving you camera-ready output,
or (more likely) images the files onto film. If you get
camera-ready output, the commercial printer uses a
camera or scanner to capture the output and create
film.
However, because many graphic artists have the
ability to save files on transportable large storage
media, such as writable CD-ROMs, Zip drives, and
removable storage media, the artists skip the serv-
ice bureau entirely, cutting out the intermediate step
of film or camera-ready output. Instead, they go
directly to the commercial printer with their files.
Many commercial printers work with Photoshop, so
files saved in the native Photoshop PSD format are
usually acceptable. However, some printers may pre-
fer to use encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files.
The commercial printer takes any of these media —
camera-ready output, film, or computer files — and
uses them to make printing plates. Printing plates are
usually made out of acid-etched metal. If your proj-
ect uses more than one color, one plate is created
for each color. The plates are put on large rollers on
a printing press by the press operator, a pressman.
The pressman uses registration marks to make sure
that all the plates are exactly aligned so that the col-
ors line up. He or she then runs the press. As the
rollers rotate, the plates are dipped in ink. The inked
plate is then rolled across paper, transferring the ink
to the paper.
After the ink dries, the paper is trimmed and folded
as necessary, using crop marks as guides. The print
job is then stapled or bound, depending upon the
number of pages. The completed print job is packed
into boxes and shipped to you.

4.
Enter the custom CMYK settings into Photoshop
by using the Color Settings dialog box and
choosing Edit➪Color Settings/Photoshop➪
Color Settings.
5.
Use the custom CMYK settings to soft proof
your art, previewing how the image will look
when printed as I describe in “Setting up soft
proofing.”
6.
Look at your image with Photoshop’s Out-of-
Gamut feature, adjusting any colors that aren’t
printable.
7.
Use the Unsharp Mask to resharpen the image.
Take a look at Technique 37 for more information
about the Unsharp Mask feature.
8.
Soft proof again to be sure that the image looks
just the way you want it.
9.
Print a CMYK proof by using a high-end color
PostScript printer, and then use a spectro-
colorimeter (a machine that measures color
values) to determine the exact colors in your
image.
Commercial printers usually help you with this
step. If any of the colors are off, readjust the
Photoshop image, and then print and analyze
another proof. (Using adjustment layers is a
great way to make color corrections. Check out
Technique 22 to find out more about adjustment
layers.)
10.
Using the Print Preview dialog box, set up the
various printer’s marks that you need.
The printer’s marks include registration marks,
crop marks, and a calibration bar (used for check-
ing the colors). Check with your commercial
printer to see which printer’s marks they recom-
mend using.
11.
If your commercial printer doesn’t accept
Photoshop PSD files, create CMYK separations
for your image saved in EPS format.
Phew! Some list, huh? The next six sections take you
through these steps, showing you how to convert
your image from RGB to CMYK, enter custom CMYK
printing press settings, set up soft proofing, check
for unprintable colors, add the printer’s marks that
you need, and then create CMYK separations. I know
it sounds like a lot, but take it step by step and you
discover that this isn’t so hard after all.
Entering and saving custom 
CMYK printer settings
Choosing custom CMYK settings gives you more
control over the amount of ink coverage that a print-
ing press uses when printing your project. You can
get these custom settings from your commercial
printer. Many times, the default settings that come
with Photoshop (such as the U.S. Prepress Defaults)
are good enough and the printer specifies them.
Here’s how to set up custom CMYK settings:
1.
Choose Edit➪Color Settings/Photoshop➪
Color Settings.
The Color Settings dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 14-1, ready for you to select the prepress
settings that you need.
• Figure 14-1: The Color Settings dialog box is used to
enter custom CMYK prepress settings.

98
• Figure 14-3: Use the Custom CMYK dialog box to select
the amount of ink coverage.
6.
In the Separation Options area, use the radio
buttons and text boxes to select the proper
settings.
The commercial printer should also provide
these settings. In the Separation Options area,
you can set the following:
 Separation Type: Your options are GCR
(Gray Component Replacement) or UCR
(Undercolor Replacement). This setting tells
Photoshop what type of printing press is
being used.
 Black Generation: This option sets how
much black is used when your RGB image
is converted into CMYK. This prevents the
CMYK inks from becoming muddy when
they’re mixed together.
 Black Ink Limit, Total Ink Limit, and UCA
Amount: Enter a percentage in each of these
text boxes to set the amount of ink that’s used
on each printing plate.
7.
Click OK to close the Custom CMYK dialog box
and return to the Color Settings dialog box.
8.
Click Save, enter a name for the color settings
in the Save dialog box that appears, and then
click Save. (See Figure 14-4.)
2.
In the Working Spaces area, use the CMYK
drop-down list to select the prepress settings
that you need. (See Figure 14-2.)
If you aren’t in the United States, select prepress
settings based on your geographic location.
If one of the predefined prepress settings works
for you, you do not need to create a custom
CMYK setting, so skip to Step 9.
• Figure 14-2: Select one of the prepress settings that
matches the press and paper type that
you’re using.
3.
If you need to select custom settings, choose
Custom from the CMYK drop-down list.
The Custom CMYK dialog box opens, as shown
in Figure 14-3, giving you access to ink settings.
4.
Type a name for the custom CMYK settings in
the Name text box.
5.
Select an ink type from the Ink Colors drop-
down list, and use the Dot Gain text box to
enter the correct percentage.
This information should be supplied by your
commercial printer.

Click OK to close the Color Settings dialog box.
Great job! You’re on your way to using Photoshop
to proof and create CMYK separations. The next
step is to convert your image to CMYK color
mode.
Checking for unprintable colors
Out-of-gamut (non-printable) colors are a problem
when printing a project at a commercial press
because they can lead to unexpected results.
When you convert an image from RGB mode to CMYK
mode, any out-of-gamut RGB colors are forced into
the printable CMYK color range. This can lead to
unwanted color shifts.
So, before you convert to CMYK and soft proof your
project, check for unprintable colors. Here’s how:
1.
Choose View➪Proof Setup➪Working CMYK.
2.
Choose View➪Gamut Warning.
The non-printable colors in the image are cov-
ered with an opaque gray mask, as shown in
Figure 14-5.
By default, out-of-gamut colors are shown
using a medium gray mask. You can change
the color and opacity of this mask by choosing
Edit (Photoshop on a Mac)➪Preferences➪
Transparency & Gamut, and then changing
the settings in the Gamut Warning area of the
Preferences dialog box.
• Figure 14-5: An opaque gray mask covers the out-of-
gamut colors.
3.
Choose Select➪Color Range.
This opens the Color Range dialog box shown in
Figure 14-6.
4.
Use the Select drop-down list to select Out of
Gamut, and then click OK.
All out-of-gamut areas in the image are selected,
as shown in Figure 14-7. This protects the areas
that contain printable colors and contains your
work to the non-printable areas.
5.
Select the Sponge tool from the Toolbox.
6.
Select Desaturate from the Mode drop-down list
on the Options bar.
7.
Use the Flow slider bar to select a percentage.
Flow sets how quickly pixels are desaturated. A
higher percentage desaturates an area faster
than a lower percentage.
8.
Use the Brush picker to select the diameter of
the sponge.
9.
Stroke across the selected, out-of-gamut areas.
When the color in an out-of-gamut area moves
into printable colors, the gray mask disappears.
Be careful when using the Sponge tool though:
Too much desaturation can make colors dull.

Technique 14: Getting Files Ready for Offset Printing

convert to CMYK mode, notice that CMYK appears
in the title bar of your image next to the filename.
As the conversion occurs, you may also notice that
the colors in the image become a bit dull-looking.
This is because of the color shift that occurs when
Photoshop converts the image from one color space
to another. You can correct this shift by adjusting
the tone using levels and curves. For more informa-
tion about color correction, turn to Technique 30.
Be sure to select your custom CMYK settings
by using the Color Settings dialog box (as I
describe earlier in “Entering and saving cus-
tom CMYK printer settings”) before you con-
vert your image from RGB to CMYK. If you
perform the color mode conversion before
selecting the custom settings, none of the cus-
tom settings will be applied to your image,
making the image inconsistent with the color
settings. Such inconsistencies can mess up soft
proofing and color reproduction later in the
printing process.
Setting up soft proofing
Soft proofing lets you see a pretty accurate preview
of your image by using the default prepress settings
or custom CMYK settings that you selected and saved
in the earlier section, “Entering and saving custom
CMYK printer settings.” To ensure that the image col-
ors that you see while soft proofing are correct, you
need to calibrate your monitor first. For directions
on calibrating your monitor, turn to Technique 4.
Here’s how to set up soft proofing:
1.
Choose View➪Proof Setup➪Custom.
The Proof Setup dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 14-8. This dialog box is used to select a
custom CMYK color setting and how color is
converted when your image moves from one
color space (your monitor and Photoshop pro-
gram) to another color space (the printing
press).
• Figure 14-6: Use the Color Range dialog box to select the
out-of-gamut areas.
• Figure 14-7: By selecting the out-of-gamut areas, the
printable colors are protected from editing.
Really zoom in on the areas that you’re desat-
urating so that you can see exactly when pixel
colors move from out-of-gamut to printable.
Converting to CMYK color mode
This next step is a breeze. All that you need to do
is choose Image➪Mode➪CMYK Color. When you

2.
Make sure that the Profile drop-down list has
the right prepress settings selected.
The default prepress or custom CMYK settings
that you created in “Entering and saving custom
CMYK settings” should already be selected. If the
settings are not selected, use the drop-down list
to find and select them.
3.
Use the Intent drop-down list to select a color-
conversion setting.
Your commercial printer should provide the set-
ting. You have four options to choose from:
 Perceptual: Converts color values in a way
that produces little color shift. Good for pho-
tographs and other continuous-tone images.
 Saturation: Converts color values with the
intent of preserving vivid colors. This option
can produce a noticeable color shift. Good
for sharp-edged images, such as charts and
graphs.
 Relative Colorimetric: The default setting,
this option converts color based on the moni-
tor’s whitepoint setting. This option can pro-
duce a noticeable color shift.
 Absolute Colorimetric: Converts color based
on the printable color range (gamut), and
attempts to convert colors that are out-of-
gamut into printable colors. This can produce
color shifts in non-continuous areas of the
image, making for some unintended results.
4.
Click Save, enter a name for the proof setup in
the Save dialog box, and then click Save. (See
Figure 14-9.)
• Figure 14-9: Use the Save dialog box to enter a name for
your custom soft proof settings.
5.
Click OK to close the Proof Setup dialog box.
The soft proof settings that you saved are
now available at the bottom of the View➪
Proof Setup menu.
6.
Choose Proof➪View Colors or press
Ctrl+Y/Ô+Y to turn on soft proofing.
When soft proofing is turned on, notice that
the selected proof setting name appears in the
title bar of the image window, as shown in Fig-
ure 14-10.
• Figure 14-10: The selected soft proof setting appears in
the image’s title bar.
If your project contains several images that
you want to soft proof by using the same cus-
tom proof settings, you need to turn on soft
proofing and select the settings for each
image.

Saving your image as an EPS file
Depending on the commercial printer that you’re
using, you may not need to save your image as an
EPS file. Many printers will take it from here and
accept a Photoshop PSD file. But, if your printer
Adding printer’s marks
Depending on your project, you may need to use var-
ious printer’s marks. For instance, if your project —
suppose it’s a brochure — uses four ink colors (this
would be called a 4-color or 4-c job), you would need
to include registration marks so that the pressman
could exactly align the printing plates on the press.
A calibration bar would be needed to measure col-
ors exactly. The edges of the brochure and any folds
would need to be indicated with crop marks. Fig-
ure 14-11 shows some typical printer’s marks.
• Figure 14-11: Printer’s marks tell the pressman and other
workers at the printing company how to
align, calibrate, trim, and fold your project.

In the Ink Characteristics area, click the square
next to Color.
The Color Picker opens, showing CMYK process
color combinations.
7.
Click Custom in the Color Picker.
The Color Picker changes to show custom spot
colors. (See Figure 14-19.)
Working with Spot Colors
Spot colors, also called custom colors, are used to
exactly match a particular color — for instance a
lapis blue corporate logo or a book title in silver
metallic letters for a book cover. No way could you
exactly match that lapis blue with a mixture of
CMYK inks, and you certainly couldn’t create
metallics from those inks. (By the way, CMYK inks
are also referred to as process color. You may hear
your commercial printer refer to them this way.)
That’s when you need to turn to custom colors cre-
ated by companies such as Pantone, TRUMATCH,
TOYO, and DIC. These custom colors are used in
addition to (or instead of) the standard CMYK inks.
Spot colors are selected by using a printed swatch
book that you can buy at the better art supply stores
or directly from the ink manufacturer. When you
select a spot color in Photoshop, the color that
you see is only an approximation. Spot colors must
be selected from printed swatch books.
Each spot color needs its own plate on the printing
press. (If you plan to include a varnish for your proj-
ect, the varnish is also considered a spot color and
needs a separate plate.) Spot color information is
saved in Photoshop in its own channel. When you
want to export the spot color channels, you need to
save the image file in Photoshop DCS 2.0 or
Photoshop PDF format.
Adding a spot color to your image
Selections are used to create spot color channels.
A spot color channel can contain any shape or type
that you can create in Photoshop. This example uses
type to create a spot color channel. Here’s how:
1.
Open the image to which you want to add the
spot color channel.
2.
Make sure white is selected as the Foreground
color.
Using white for the type creation makes it easier
to see how the spot color affects the type later.

the ink completely opaque, covering up any ink
below it. Typically, if I don’t have any information
from the printer, I leave this setting at 0 percent.
That way, I can see the selected color and any

Working with and
Organizing Layers
L
ayers are one of Photoshop’s fundamental building blocks. You sim-
ply can’t work in Photoshop without using at least a layer or two
(or sometimes 60). If you aren’t using the full power of layers, you
should. If you use layers all the time, how do you keep them organized?
If you’re asking, “What are layers?” here’s a brief rundown. (If layers are
as familiar as the back of your hand, skip this paragraph and the next
one, too.) Imagine that you have three pieces of clear window glass and
three colored markers, say orange, black, and red. In your mind, take the
orange marker and scribble on the first piece of glass. Next, take the
black marker and scribble on the second piece of glass. Then, take the
red marker and scribble on the third piece of glass. You now have three
pieces of glass with a different colored scribble on each one. Take the
three pieces of glass and place them one on top of the other with the
orange scribble on the bottom, the black scribble in the middle, and the
red scribbled glass on top. As you look through the glass you see three
different scribbles. If you want to erase some of the red scribble, you can
do so because the red scribbled glass is on top. But, notice that if you
want to change the orange scribble, you have to reshuffle the deck of
glass to get to it because it’s on the bottom. Also, any change that you
make to a scribble on one piece of glass affects only that piece of glass.
The other scribbles are separate and don’t change.
Each layer is like one piece of clear glass. The different colored scribbles
are your drawings, brush strokes, type, or whatever on each layer. You
can activate layers individually and edit the contents of a layer without
affecting any of the other layers. Layers are great for trying out some-
thing (you can always toss a layer in the trash) or separating different
parts of an image. (For instance, you can group all your type layers into
one layer set.) Layers are listed in the Layers palette in a stacking order —
the layer at the top of the list is in front of the layer stack, and the layer
at the bottom of the list is at the back. (For a more detailed explanation
of layers and how they work, take a look at Photoshop CS For Dummies by
Deke McClelland and yours truly, published by Wiley.)

• Figure 15-2: The checkerboard areas of the separate
layers indicate transparency.
Granted, the surf cat example has only three layers.
But, what happens when you start working with more
layers? Anytime that I have more than ten layers, I
find that it gets confusing unless I group and color
code the layers. This technique shows you the ins
and outs of working with layers, changing stacking
order, color coding layers, and grouping layers into
layer sets.
Getting to Know Layers
This section is a mini-refresher on layer basics.
Using the Layers palette, you can rename and hide
layers, change their stacking order, flip them hori-
zontally or vertically, and even copy a layer from
one image to another. You probably know how to
Figure 15-1 shows a drawing of a hip cat surfing a
wave. The Layers palette shows that the drawing is
made up of three layers: Surf Cat, Surf Board, and
Wave. Figure 15-2 shows each layer separately. When
these three layers are viewed at the same time, you
see the entire composite image. Notice how the lay-
ers are stacked in the Layers palette. The Wave layer
is on the bottom, so it is in the back of the image.
The Surf Board is next up in the stacking order, so it
appears on top of the Wave layer. And, finally, the
Surf Cat is at the top of the list, so it’s on top of the
surfboard. If I moved the Surf Board layer to the top
of the stacking order, the surfboard would hide the
cat’s feet in the picture.
• Figure 15-1: Notice how the separate layers are stacked
in the Layers palette and the order in which
they appear in the image. 

Four Ways to Lock Layers
111
do most of these things already, but you may glean a
few tidbits here:

Open the Layers palette: Press F7 on the key-
board or choose Window➪Layers.

Select a layer: Click the layer in the Layers
palette. Remember that a layer needs to be
selected in order for you to edit it.

Rename a layer: Double-click the layer’s name,
type a new name in the text box, and then press
Enter/Return.

Change the stacking order: Drag a layer up
or down the list in the Layers palette to a new
position.

Hide or show a layer: Click the eye icon to the
left of the layer in the Layers palette.

Convert the Background to a regular layer:
Double-click the Background in the Layers
palette, type a name in the New Layer text box,
and then click OK. Or, select the Background
in the Layers palette, and then choose Layer➪
New➪Layer From Background.

Convert a regular layer to the Background:
Select a layer in the Layers palette, and then
choose Layer➪New➪Background From Layer.

Flip a layer vertically or horizontally: Select
the layer in the Layer palette, and then choose
Edit➪Transform➪Flip Vertical or Flip Horizontal.

Copy a layer from one image to another: Open
both images in Photoshop, select the layer that
you want to copy in the Layers palette, and then
drag the layer to the image window where you
want it copied. The layer automatically adds
itself to the Layers palette for that image.
Color Coding Layers
Color coding layers is a pretty quick and effective
way to separate one type of layer from another.
Suppose that you have ten layers that contain
brushed shadows and eight layers that contain
furniture pieces in a darkened room. Knowing which
layer is a shadow and which layer contains a sofa
could take a few minutes to figure out. But, if you
color code all the shadow layers blue, they’re easy
to pick out.
To color code a layer:
1.
Select the layer that you want to color code in
the Layers palette.
2.
Right-click/Control+click and choose Layer
Properties from the context-sensitive menu or
choose Layer Properties from the palette menu.
The Layer Properties dialog box shown in Fig-
ure 15-3 appears.
• Figure 15-3: Use the Color drop-down list in the Layer
Properties dialog box to color code the
selected layer.
3.
Use the Color drop-down list to select the color
that you want to use.
4.
Click OK.
The layer in the Layers palette changes to that
color.
Four Ways to Lock Layers
Using the locking buttons at the top of the Layers
palette, you can lock a portion of a layer’s pixels,
lock the layer’s position, or lock everything down —
pixels and position. Figure 15-4 shows the four
buttons.

Technique 15: Working with and Organizing Layers
112

To lock the layer in position, click the button
second from the right.

To lock layer position and all pixels (colored or
transparent), click the rightmost button.
When you use any of the Lock buttons, a tiny pad-
lock appears to the right of the layer’s name.
Of course, you can use any of these buttons in a tem-
porary fashion: If you decide that you want to unlock
a portion of a layer, just click the appropriate button
again.
Creating Layer Sets
Layer sets are great for organizing layers into groups.
After you’ve divided layers into layer sets, you can
view just the name of the layer set in the Layers
palette or click the tiny arrow to show all the layers
contained within the layer set.
Here’s how to create a layer set:
1.
Choose Layer➪New➪Layer Set or Alt+click/
Option+click the Create New Set button at the
bottom of the Layers palette. (See Figure 15-5.)
If you click the Create New Set button without
holding down Alt/Option, Photoshop creates a
layer set with a default name and no color coding.
2.
Use the New Layer Set dialog box shown in
Figure 15-6 to select the layer set’s properties.
 Type a name for the layer set into the Name
text box. By default, Photoshop automatically
enters the name Set followed by a number.
You can use any descriptive name that works
for you.
 Use the Color drop-down list to color code
the layer set.
 Use the Mode drop-down list to select a
blending mode. The default setting is Pass
Through mode. With this blending mode
selected, any blending mode or adjustment
• Figure 15-4: By using the Lock buttons at the top of the
Layers palette, you can protect your work.
Locking layers is great for protecting your work if
you don’t want to edit a part of a layer or move it
by accident. Here’s what each button does:

To lock all transparent pixels on a layer so that
they can’t be changed, click the leftmost button.
With this lock in place, you can edit only colored
pixels.

To lock all colored pixels on a layer so that they
can’t be edited, click the button second from the
left. Only transparent pixels are available for
editing.

layers applied to a layer within the layer set
affect the rest of the layers below it (even if
the layers are not in the layer set). Any other
setting using the Mode drop-down list restricts
blending mode or adjustment layer effects to
the layers within the layer set.
3.
Click OK.
• Figure 15-5: Alt+click/Option+click the Create New Set
button to access layer set properties.
• Figure 15-6: Use the New Layer Set dialog box to name
and color code the layer set.

Layer sets can be repositioned in the stacking
order just like layers. Just drag the layer set up
or down the list to a new position in the
Layers palette.
Layer Set Techniques
After you create a layer set, you want to add layers
to it. Also, as your project goes along, you may find
that you need to change color coding, remove layers
from the set, or even copy the entire layer set. The
following is a list of techniques that you can use to
manage your layer set:

Add a layer to a layer set: Drag the layer over
the layer set’s name.

Remove a layer from a layer set: Drag the layer
outside the layer set.

Rename a layer set: Double-click the layer set’s
name, type a new name in the text box, and then
press Enter/Return.

Color code an existing layer set: Select the layer
set and then choose Layer Set Properties from
the Layers palette menu. Use the Color drop-
down list to select a color.

Copy an entire layer set: (This includes the lay-
ers contained within the layer set.) Drag the layer
set over the Create New Layer button at the bot-
tom of the Layers palette.

Nest an existing layer set: (This includes the lay-
ers contained within the layer set inside a new
layer set.) Drag the layer set over the Create New
Set button at the bottom of the Layers palette.

Delete a layer set: Select the layer set and then
click the trashcan icon at the bottom of the
Layers palette. The dialog box shown in Figure
15-7 appears. You can choose to delete the layer
set and all the layers contained in the layer set,
or delete only the layer set and leave the layers
intact. (To delete a layer set and all the layers
contained in the layer set and bypass the dialog
box shown in Figure 15-7, drag the layer set on
top of the trashcan icon.)

Technique 15: Working with and Organizing Layers
114
• Figure 15-7: Use the dialog box to select how you want
to delete a layer set.
You can nest a layer set within another layer
set. In fact, you can nest down to five layer
sets deep!

Getting to Know
Layer Comps
W
hen working for clients, I often create several versions of a lay-
out or image to show them. The clients can then choose the
version that they like best. In the past, this meant saving sev-
eral separate image files in Photoshop, one for each version. But, with
Photoshop CS and layer comps, all this has changed.
Layer comps are used to create virtual snapshots of every Layer palette
setting including position, stacking order, opacity, blending mode, and
applied layer styles. And unlike history snapshots, which are deleted when
an image is closed, layer comps are saved with the image and are available
every time the image is reopened. So instead of showing my clients sev-
eral image files, I can open just one image file and cycle through the layer
comps. Figure 16-1 shows the same image file viewed with two different
layer comps. Notice that the type layer’s appearance and position changes
depending on which layer comp is selected.
• Figure 16-1: The same image is viewed with two different layer comps.

This technique shows you everything you need to
know about layer comps: creating and updating them,
cycling through layer comps, deleting them, you name
it. Give layer comps a try and experiment with them.
I think you’ll find that they can be a useful tool for
client presentations and everyday work. If you want
to try out a blending mode, different layer position, or
layer effect, use layer comps to save the original and
the tester, and then cycle back and forth between the
two to see which you like best.
You can also think of layer comps as layer
version control. Before you change something
about a layer’s attributes, you can save the
original settings with a layer comp.
Creating Layer Comps
To work with layer comps, you need to use the Layer
Comps palette shown in Figure 16-2. By default, the
Layer Comps palette is docked in the Palette Well on
the Options bar. If you don’t see the Layer Comps
palette, choose Window➪Layer Comps to view it.
Creating a layer comp is pretty straightforward.
Here’s how:
1.
Position layers and set layer opacity, blending
mode, and other layer attributes the way that
you want them by using the Layers palette.
2.
Click the Create New Layer Comp button at the
bottom of the Layer Comps palette.
3.
Use the New Layer Comp dialog box that
opens, as shown in Figure 16-3, to set layer
comp options.
Using the dialog box you can
 Type a descriptive name for the layer comp in
the Name text box.
 Select which layer attributes are saved:
Visibility, Position, and Appearance.
 Type a description of the layer placement or
changes in the Comment text box.

Validating a Layer Comp
117
4.
Click OK.
The new layer comp appears selected in the
Layer Comps palette.
Don’t worry about your file size when saving
layer comps with an image — layer comps
take up only about 1K.
Cycling through Layer Comps
After creating the layer comps that you need, you
want to view the layer comps to compare the differ-
ent layer settings.
You can cycle through layer comps in two ways:
Select them one-by-one in the Layer comps palette
or use the arrow buttons to move backward or for-
ward through the layer comps. Here’s how:

View layer comps individually: Click in the col-
umn to the left of the layer comp. The tiny layer
comp icon appears in the column and the layer
comp is selected.

Cycle forward through the layer comps: Click
the Apply Next button at the bottom of the Layer
Comps palette.

Cycle backward through the layer comps: Click
the Apply Previous button at the bottom of the
Layer Comps palette.
Managing Layer Comps
An image constantly changes as you work on it. This
means that layer comps need to be updated from
time to time to keep track of the changes. You also
may find that you need to change layer comp options,
restore your image to the last layer state, or delete a
layer comp entirely. Here’s how:

Update a layer comp to the current layer settings
by selecting it in the Layer Comps palette, and
then clicking the Update button at the bottom of
the Layer Comps palette.

Change layer comp options by double-clicking
the layer comp, and then using the Layer Comp
Options dialog box that appears. This dialog box
looks exactly the same as the one shown in
Figure 16-3; only its name is different.

Restore your image to the last applied layer
state by clicking the column to the left of Last
Document State at the top of the Layer Comps
palette.

Delete a layer comp by selecting it and then
clicking the trashcan icon at the bottom of the
Layer Comps palette. You can also drag the
layer comp over the trashcan icon.
Validating a Layer Comp
Layer comps are snapshots of all the layers and
their attributes. If one layer (or more) is merged
into another layer, deleted, or converted into a
Background layer, a tiny warning icon appears in
the Layer Comps palette next to the layer comps
that are affected, as shown in Figure 16-4.
• Figure 16-4: The tiny warning icon tells you that a layer
comp is out of date.

Technique 16: Getting to Know Layer Comps
118

Right-click/Control+click the warning icon to view
a menu that lets you choose Clear Layer Comp
Warning or Clear All Layer Comp Warnings.

Click the Update button at the bottom of the
Layer Comps palette to make the layer comp
current.

Delete the layer comp with the problem.
You can do a few things in this situation:

Ignore the warning icon altogether. If you do this,
you might lose some layers that are important
to you.

Use the History palette to activate a history
state before any layer deletion, merging, or con-
version. (For more about the History palette,
turn to Technique 25.)

Enhancing Images
with Blending
Modes
T
his technique zeroes in on another powerful Photoshop feature —
blending modes. What is a blending mode? I thought you’d never
ask. Suppose that you’re using two layers and you select a blending
mode for the upper layer. The blending mode defines the way pixels on
the upper, active layer affect the appearance of the pixels on the layer
immediately below it. Some blending modes affect lighter pixels, some
affect darker pixels, and some affect neutral tones. When you think about
blending modes, remember this: Blending modes are all about how the
color being applied interacts with existing color.
This may all seem a bit mysterious, and if you are a “show me” person
like I am, you want to see what blending modes can really do. Because
Photoshop has 25 blending modes, I can’t show them all in a few short
pages. However, I take you through which tools and dialog boxes make
blending modes available, and how blending modes affect changes to
pixels when they’re applied. Then, I focus on a few blending modes and
show you how to use them. My one directive throughout this technique
is don’t hesitate to experiment! A blending mode that you think can’t pos-
sibly work may give you some really cool results.
A Blending Mode Rundown
Before you can use blending modes, you need to know where to find
them. One place is the Layers palette. Figure 17-1 shows the open
Blending Mode drop-down list. As shown in Figure 17-1, the blending
modes are divided into six different sections on the drop-down list
according to the type of pixels they affect.

Technique 17: Enhancing Images with Blending Modes
120
modes are available on the Options bar when the
following tools are selected: Art History, Blur, Brush,
Bucket, Color Replacement, Gradient, Healing Brush,
History Brush, Pencil, Sharpen, and Smudge. The
blending modes are also available in the following
dialog boxes: Apply Image, Calculations, Fade, Fill,
and Layer Styles.
The first two modes, Normal and Dissolve, don’t
change pixels on the layers underneath. Normal
mode combined with 100% Opacity displays every
pixel in the active layer no matter what colors are
present on layers underneath. Dissolve mode works
best on semi-transparent areas such as drop shad-
ows or fade outs, changing them into a random spray
of pixels. Take a look at the section “Creating a Grainy
Shadow,” later in this chapter, to see Dissolve mode
in action.
The next four modes, Darken, Multiply, Color Burn,
and Linear Burn, use darker pixels to create results.
White pixels are neutral, so they don’t affect the pix-
els underneath, but instead become clear.
Next on the blending mode drop-down list are the
opposites of the four darkening blending modes
above: Lighten, Screen, Color Dodge, and Linear
Dodge. These blending modes use lighter pixels to
create results. Black pixels are neutral, so they don’t
affect the pixels underneath, but instead become
clear.
The fourth group down on the blending mode drop-
down list includes six blending modes: Overlay, Soft
Light, Hard Light, Vivid Light, Linear Light, and Pin
Light. These blending modes change the contrast of
underlying pixels. 50% gray pixels are neutral, so
they don’t affect the pixels underneath, but instead
become clear. Pixels that are darker than 50% gray
darken the underlying pixels; pixels that are lighter
than 50% gray lighten the underlying pixels. Turn to
the section “Fading a Filter,” later in this chapter, to
see what Vivid Light mode can do.
• Figure 17-1: Whenever you encounter the Blending
Mode drop-down list, you see that it’s
organized into six categories. Here the 
drop-down list is shown in the Layers 
palette.
The other places that you can access blending modes
are certain dialog boxes and the Options bar when
a brush or painting tool is selected. The blending
Does not change pixels on other layers
Applies these qualities of the upper
layer pixels to the pixels underneath
Darkens the pixels underneath
Lightens the pixels underneath
Compares upper layer pixels with pixels underneath
Changes the contrast of the pixels underneath

Applying a Blending Mode
121
The next blending mode group, Difference and
Exclusion, uses comparison to create results. White
areas on the active layer invert underlying pixels.
Black areas on the active layer don’t affect the pixels
underneath.
The final group of blending modes, Hue, Saturation,
Color, and Luminosity, apply that quality of the
active layer to the pixels underneath. Look at the
following section, “Applying a Blending Mode,” to
see how the Luminosity mode blends pixels.
The Behind and Clear blending modes
When you use the Brush, Bucket, Gradient, History Brush,
or Pencil tools, two blending modes are available on the
Options bar Blending Mode drop-down list that are not
offered in the Layers palette: Behind and Clear. (Clear is
only available with the Brush, Bucket, and Pencil tools.)
Behind mode protects colored pixels on a layer just as if
you had clicked the Lock Image Pixels button on the Layers
palette. Only transparent (non-colored) pixels are affected
by the blending mode.
Clear mode works like an eraser, removing color from pix-
els and making them transparent. This lets the layer below
show through completely.
Applying a Blending Mode
The directions that follow show how to apply a blend-
ing mode by using the Layers palette. If you’ve never
used blending modes before, open two images and
give this a try. Also, this example uses the Luminosity
blending mode. Don’t limit yourself to this particular
blending mode; cycle through them all and see how
they affect your images.
1.
Open two images in Photoshop.
For this example, I use an image of the moon
and a bug that I dubbed Sly Fly, as shown in
Figure 17-2. My ultimate goal with these two
images is to blend the fly onto the moon to
make it look like there’s a bugly in the moon
(instead of a man in the moon).
• Figure 17-2: For this example, I’m combining these two
images.
2.
Make sure that both images are contained on
regular layers, not the Background layer.
If you need to convert a Background layer to a
regular layer, choose Layer➪New➪Layer from
Background. In the New Layer dialog box, enter
a name for the layer in the Name text box, and
then click OK.
3.
Drag one image layer from the Layers palette
onto the other image window.
This copies the layer containing one image to the
other image window.
For this example, because I want the fly positioned
on top of the moon, I drag the layer containing the
fly onto the Moon image window. The fly layer
was automatically added to the Layers palette,
as shown in Figure 17-3.
If you look at the two layers in Figure 17-3, you
notice that the fly is too big to fit in the moon
area and that the fly is completely opaque. It
doesn’t blend into the moon layer at all.

Technique 17: Enhancing Images with Blending Modes
122
• Figure 17-4: After the fly is scaled and rotated, it fits into
the moon area. 
• Figure 17-5: Lowering the opacity of the Sly Fly layer
makes the moon’s texture and lighting
visible.
Fading a Filter
This blending mode example uses the Fade dialog
box to apply a blending mode. First, a filter is applied
to a copy of the image. Then, the Fade dialog box is
used to set the layer’s opacity and blending mode.
• Figure 17-3: I dragged the layer containing the fly to the
Moon image window.
The first thing that I need to do is use the
Transformation commands to scale and rotate
the bug so that it fits into the moon area, as
shown in Figure 17-4. (I discuss transformations
in detail in Technique 18.) Next, I use a blending
mode to blend the fly’s pixels with those of the
moon.
4.
In the Layers palette, use the Blending Mode
drop-down list to select a mode.
For this example, I chose Luminosity, which
colors and shades the fly exactly like the moon
behind it.
5.
Adjust the layer’s opacity, if necessary.
The final touch for my bugly in the moon is to
put the opacity down to 30%, letting more of the
moon’s texture and lighting show through. (See
Figure 17-5.)

Creating a Grainy Shadow
123
1.
Open an image in Photoshop.
The image in this example is a picture of a window
contained on one layer, as shown in Figure 17-6.
• Figure 17-6: The window image is contained on one layer.
2.
Duplicate the layer that the image is on by
dragging the layer to the Create New Layer
button at the bottom of the Layers palette.
A copy of the layer appears in the Layers palette
above the original layer.
3.
Apply a filter to the copied layer.
For this example, the Graphic Pen filter is
applied to the copied layer.
4.
Choose Edit➪Fade.
The Fade dialog box shown in Figure 17-7 opens.
• Figure 17-7: Use the Fade dialog box to select a blending
mode.
5.
Set the layer’s Opacity and choose a blending
mode from the Mode drop-down list.
In this example, Opacity is set to 30% and Vivid
Light mode is selected.
6.
Click OK.
The faded layer’s pixels blend with the original
image pixels to create interesting texture and
lighting, as shown in Figure 17-8.
• Figure 17-8: The Vivid Light blending mode adds more
contrast to the image.
Creating a Grainy Shadow
This blending mode example uses Dissolve mode to
make a drop shadow appear grainy. You use the Layer
Style dialog box to apply the shadow and blending
mode. (To find out more about layer styles, turn to
Technique 20.)

Technique 17: Enhancing Images with Blending Modes
124
4.
Use the Blend Mode drop-down list to select
Dissolve mode and move the Opacity slider to
the desired opacity.
For this example, Opacity is set at 75%. In addi-
tion, Distance is set to 10 pixels and Size is set
to 24 pixels.
5.
Click OK.
The grainy drop shadow appears behind the
type. Figure 17-10 shows two versions of the
drop shadow. One uses Normal mode (top)
and the other uses Dissolve mode (bottom).
• Figure 17-10: Dissolve mode changes the shadow into a
spray of pixels.
1.
Open a new image window and use the
Horizontal Type tool to create some type.
2.
In the Layers palette, make sure that the Type
layer is selected.
3.
Click the Add Layer Style button at the bottom
of the palette and choose Drop Shadow from
the menu.
The Layer Styles dialog box opens with Drop
Shadow selected. Use the Drop Shadow area at
the center of the dialog box (see Figure 17-9) to
set the size and opacity of the shadow and select
a blending mode.
• Figure 17-9: Use the Drop Shadow area to create your
drop shadow.

Transforming
Images, Layers,
and Selections
T
ransformation is one of those fun, tangible Photoshop toys. You
can flip, rotate, skew, and add perspective to anything in Photoshop.
Transformation always makes me feel like a magician. I wiggle my
fingers, there’s nothing up my sleeves, and click! The model is suddenly
standing on her head. Click: Her head is facing the other direction. Click:
She’s as big as Mount Rushmore. Fun.
This technique shows you how to use the transformation commands to
flip, spin, and gain a little perspective. First, you take a look at transform-
ing entire images. Then, you move on to transforming layers and selec-
tions. If you’ve worked with transformations before, some of this material
may be old hat. But keep your eye out for a myriad of interesting tricks
and tips — it could be a transforming experience.
Doing the Big Flip
With Photoshop, you can rotate, horizontally flip, or vertically flip an
entire image. The commands that perform such transformations are in
the Image➪Rotate Canvas menu shown in Figure 18-1. Most of the com-
mands shown in Figure 18-1 are pretty self-explanatory, but I quickly run
down the Image➪Rotate Canvas menu:

Rotate an image to stand it on its head by choosing 180°.

Choose 90° CW or 90° CCW to rotate the image one quarter turn
clockwise or counterclockwise, respectively.

Rotate an image a specific number of degrees clockwise or counter-
clockwise by choosing Arbitrary.

Flip the image so that left becomes right and right becomes left by
choosing Flip Canvas Horizontal.

Choose Flip Canvas Vertical to flip the image upside down.

• Figure 18-2: Use the commands on the Edit➪Transform
menu to transform layers and selections.
• Figure 18-3: This brave lad is ready to be transformed.
• Figure 18-1: Use the Rotate Canvas menu to transform
entire images.
If you want to skew, distort, or add perspec-
tive to an entire image, you have to perform
the transformations by linking all the layers
together and then performing a layer transfor-
mation. For details on how to link layers
together, take a look at the “Linking layers”
sidebar in this technique.
Prestidigitation with
Transformation
When you want to transform a layer or selection,
use the commands on the Edit➪Transform menu,
as shown in Figure 18-2.
A brave young boy from the audience has volun-
teered to demonstrate the Edit➪Transform menu
commands. This lad is shown in Figure 18-3.

Prestidigitation with Transformation
127
To get you started, I give full directions for scaling an
image. After that, I tell you how to perform the other
transformations by using a quick list.
To scale an image, use the following steps:
1.
Use the Layers palette to select a layer or use
any of the selection tools to select an area to
be transformed.
2.
Choose Edit➪Transform➪Scale.
A bounding box with small square handles
appears around the layer or selection, as
shown in Figure 18-4.
• Figure 18-4: The brave lad is enclosed within a
bounding box.
3.
Position the mouse pointer over one of the
square handles, click the mouse button, and
drag.
Drag a corner handle to change both the horizon-
tal and vertical scale. Drag the handle on the left
or right side of the bounding box to change the
vertical scale. Drag a top or bottom handle to
change the horizontal scale. Figure 18-5 shows
our brave volunteer being scaled horizontally.
If you need to quickly scale a layer or selection
proportionally, just hold down the Shift key
while dragging a corner handle.
• Figure 18-5: Drag a handle or part of the bounding box
to scale the layer or selection.
4.
When you’re finished scaling, release the
mouse and press Enter/Return to accept the
change or press Esc to cancel the scaling.
You can also click the Commit check mark but-
ton on the Options bar to accept changes or
click the Cancel button on the Options bar.
While using any of the transformation com-
mands on the Edit menu, you can access
another type of transformation by right-
clicking/Control+clicking inside the bound-
ing box and selecting another transformation
command.

Technique 18: Transforming Images, Layers, and Selections
128
• Figure 18-6: Slide the bounding box right or left to skew
the layer or selection vertically.
• Figure 18-7: Drag in any direction to distort the layer or
selection.
You can’t transform the Background layer.
If you want to transform part or all of the
Background layer, you have to convert the
Background to a regular layer first. To do this,
select the Background in the Layers palette
and then choose Layer➪New➪Layer from
Background.
If the layer’s locked, you can’t transform it!
None of the commands on the Edit➪Transform menu are
available to you if the layer that you’re trying to transform is
locked. If the transformation commands are grayed out
after you select a layer, check to see whether a tiny padlock
appears to the right of the layer’s name in the Layers
palette. Chances are that the Lock: Position button or the
Lock: All button at the top of the Layers palette is selected.
For the rest of the Edit➪Transform commands, I list
them by command and then tell you how to move the
bounding box handles to perform the transformation.
Use the earlier directions on scaling an image and
substitute each of the following bullet points for
Steps 2 and 3:

To rotate a layer or selection, choose Edit➪
Transform➪Rotate. The bounding box with
square handles appears. (Refer to Figure 18-4.)
Position the mouse over one of the handles and
drag clockwise or counterclockwise.

To skew a layer or selection, choose Edit➪
Transform➪Skew. Slide the left or right sides of
the bounding box to skew vertically, as shown in
Figure 18-6. Slide the top or bottom sides of the
bounding box to skew horizontally. Hold down
Alt/Option and drag to skew around the center
point (located on the boy’s nose).

To distort a layer or selection, choose Edit➪
Transform➪Distort. Drag a handle or bounding
line in any direction to simultaneously skew,
scale, and add perspective to the layer or selec-
tion. (See Figure 18-7.)

To add perspective to a layer or selection, choose
Edit➪Transform➪Perspective. Drag any handle
or bounding line in any direction.

Going Wild with Free Transform
129
You can move the center point (located on the
boy’s nose in Figure 18-6) to change the fixed
point that the transformation moves around.
Moving the center point is like anchoring a
corner or side to a door hinge and letting the
image swing around that hinge.
Linking layers
If you want to transform two or more layers at the same
time, you need to link them by using the Layers palette.
Here’s how: In the Layers palette, select one of the layers
that you want to link. Click the column to the left of another
layer that you want to link to the selected layer. A tiny chain
link appears in the column (shown in the following figure),
showing that the layers are linked. Continue clicking in the
column to the left of each layer that you want to link.
Going Wild with Free Transform
The Free Transform command does everything that
is available on the Edit➪Transform menu. Using this
one command, you can scale, rotate, skew, distort, or
add perspective to any layer or selection. The Free
Transform command is used in conjunction with key-
strokes to access each particular transformation.
Here’s how:
1.
Use the Layers palette to select a layer or use
any of the selection tools to select an area to
be transformed.
2.
Choose Edit➪Free Transform or press Ctrl+T/
Ô+T.
A bounding box with square handles appears
around the layer or selection. (Refer to Fig-
ure 18-4.)
3.
Perform the transformations that you want.
 Drag one of the handles to scale the layer or
selection. Hold down the Shift key while drag-
ging a corner handle to scale proportionately.
Alt/Option+drag to scale around the center
point.
 To rotate the layer or selection, position the
mouse pointer outside the bounding box,
and then drag clockwise or counterclockwise.
Shift+drag to rotate the layer or selection in
15-degree increments.
 Skew the layer or selection by Ctrl/Ô+drag-
ging a side handle. Ctrl+Alt+drag/Ctrl+Option+
drag to skew around the center point.
 Ctrl+drag/Option+drag a corner handle to dis-
tort the layer or selection.
 To add perspective to a layer or selection,
Ctrl+Alt+drag/Ô+Option+drag one of the han-
dles. This changes the perspective along one
axis. To change the perspective along two
axes at the same time, Ctrl+Alt+Shift+drag/
Ô+Option+Shift+drag.

The Move tool, alias the
Free Transform tool
Here’s an oft-forgotten use for the Move tool: transforma-
tions! Believe it or not, you can set the Move tool to work
exactly like the Free Transform command. 
Here’s how: Select the Move tool, and then select the Show
Bounding Box check box on the Options bar. A transfor-
mation bounding box with handles appears around the
layer or selection. To perform transformations, use the same
keystrokes+dragging that you would for the Free Transform
command.
If you want to undo the last transformation and
remain within free transform mode, press
Ctrl/Ô+Z.
4.
Press Enter/Return to accept the final transfor-
mation or Esc to cancel.
You can also click the Commit check mark
button on the Options bar to accept the
transformation, or click the Cancel button
on the Options bar.
You can move the image in the image window
when performing a transformation by drag-
ging within the bounding box.

Going Transparent
with Opacity 
and Fill
H
ave you ever seen an advertisement where a ghost appears to
hover in the background behind an unsuspecting person? Or, how
about an animated Web graphic that appears to fade in and fade
out? Both of these effects can be created in Photoshop by using opacity
settings to make the image or type semi-transparent. This technique
focuses on the Opacity and Fill settings found on the Layers palette. I
show you how to change these settings to blend layers together, making
them semi-transparent or even transparent.
You can also set the opacity of the colors that you apply to layers, including
brush strokes (Technique 23), patterns (Technique 29), fills (Technique 21),
and layer styles (Technique 20). For more details about setting opacity
for each of these features, take a look at the techniques I’ve listed here.
To find out how to make an animated Web graphic that fades in and out,
take a look at Technique 60.
Words can be opaque
When talking with other Photoshop artists about transparency, you might find some
discrepancies between meanings. First, everyone agrees that transparent is the
opposite of opaque. But semi-opaque and semi-transparent can be used to describe
the same effect (sort of the glass is half full or half empty depending how you look
at things). Then there’s translucent. Translucent is a toughie because part of the
word, lucent, indicates light, so you would imagine that the layer or image appears
lit or has some kind of light source behind it. However, some folks use translucent
to mean transparent and others use it to mean semi-transparent. I guess pictures
can be worth a thousand words after all.
Using Opacity and Fill
You may have noticed two little text boxes at the top of the Layers
palette labeled Opacity and Fill, as shown in Figure 19-1.
Technique

 Lowering Opacity and Fill
 Blending layers together

Technique 19: Going Transparent with Opacity and Fill
132
• Figure 19-2: With layer styles applied to the quilt pieces,
the Fill slider doesn’t change the opacity of
the layer effects (bottom).
Opacity: 100%, Fill: 100%
Opacity: 40%, Fill: 100%
Opacity: 100%, Fill: 40%
• Figure 19-1: The Opacity and Fill text boxes set layer
opacity in different ways.
The Opacity and Fill text boxes both affect a layer’s
opacity, but in different ways. The Opacity setting
affects the entire layer. Every pixel on the layer is
altered when the Opacity setting is changed. The Fill
setting changes the opacity of the entire layer except
areas where layer styles are applied. Take a look at
Figure 19-2 to see what I mean.
In Figure 19-2, I used layer styles to add a drop
shadow and bevel to a quilt piece (top). Then, I low-
ered Opacity to 40% and left the Fill at 100% (middle).
Notice how both the quilt piece and layer styles are
semi-transparent. Next, I raised the Opacity back to
100% and lowered the Fill to 40% (bottom). As you
can see, the quilt piece becomes semi-transparent,
but the layer styles remain unchanged.
You can adjust layer styles opacity settings in
the Layer Styles dialog box.
Depending on the effect that you want to create, you
can use the Opacity setting to blend layers together
in different ways. The Fill setting can be used to fade
the layer contents, emphasizing the effect of the layer
styles. You can even set the Fill to 0% and make the
layer transparent, leaving only the layer styles effect.
(See Figure 19-3.)

Blending Layers Together
133
• Figure 19-3: With Fill set to 0%, the layer disappears
entirely, leaving only the layer styles.
If you want to play around with the Opacity and Fill
sliders, apply a layer style such as a drop shadow or
bevel to two different layers. Then, lower the Opacity
of one layer, and lower the Fill setting for the other
layer. The results quickly become apparent. (Turn to
Technique 20 for directions on applying layer styles.)
If you want to create a gradual fade-in/fade-
out effect on a single layer, you must use a
layer mask. Turn to Technique 50 for details.
Blending Layers Together
To blend two (or more) layers together, you should
use the Opacity slider on the upper layer. This makes
the top layer semi-transparent so that the layer
underneath becomes visible. You can create some
interesting effects with this technique. Here’s how:
1.
In the Layers palette, make sure that the two
layers that you want to blend to are directly
next to one another, as shown in Figure 19-4.
• Figure 19-4: Use the Layer’s palette to place the layers
next to one another.
2.
Select the uppermost of the two layers.
3.
Click the arrow button next to the Opacity text
box and use the slider that appears to adjust
the layer’s opacity, as shown in Figure 19-5.
If you’re using the Move tool, you can quickly
change the active layer’s opacity by typing the
percentage on the keyboard.

Technique 19: Going Transparent with Opacity and Fill
134
You can’t change the opacity of the Background
layer or a layer that’s locked. If you want to
change the opacity of the Background, you
have to convert it to a regular layer first. To 
do this, choose Layer➪New➪Layer from
Background.
• Figure 19-5: Use the slider to set the layer’s opacity.

Creating Great
Effects with Layer
Styles
L
ayer styles are really fabulous. With a few clicks of the mouse, you
can add drop shadows, bevels, textures, patterns, strokes, and more
to any layer, type layer, or vector shape on a shape layer. Layer styles
work hand-in-hand with the Styles palette. When you come up with a layer
style effect that you like, you can save the effect on the Styles palette as a
preset for later use.
This technique is an introduction to using layer styles. First, you find out
how to apply bevels and emboss layers to add three-dimensional qualities
and depth. Then, you work with inner and outer glows to add shine to
your layers and apply a colored overlay. From there, you see how to save
layer styles that you create and then apply them with the Styles palette.
As you can see, I get you started. I show you how to use the Layer Styles
dialog box to access these great effects, but you take it from there. You
can create hundreds of effect combinations, including several layer style
options not demonstrated here — drop shadows and contours; texture,
pattern, and gradient overlays; satin effects and strokes. (I discuss drop
shadows in Technique 44.) Use your imagination to come up with your
own amazing effects!
Getting to Know Layer Styles
The Layer Style dialog box shown in Figure 20-1 is the place to go for 
special layer effects. As shown in Figure 20-1, the layer style effects are
listed with check boxes on the left side of the dialog box. When a box is
checked, that layer style is applied to the active layer. To view the settings
for a layer style, click the effect’s name in the left column. The settings for
a selected layer style appear in the center of the dialog box. Most of the
layer effects include several settings that you can change.

• Figure 20-2: Choose a special effect from the menu.
Adding Bevels and Embossing
Bevels and embossing add depth to a layer by using
highlights and shadows to give it a chiseled, three-
dimensional look. Using the Bevel and Emboss panel
of the Layer Style dialog box shown in Figure 20-3,
you can create five different effects with the Style
drop-down list.
The five different bevel and emboss effects are Outer
Bevel, Inner Bevel, Emboss, Pillow Emboss, and Stroke
Emboss. An example of each type is shown in Figure
20-4. (At the bottom of Figure 20-4 is an extra example
of a Stroke Emboss that includes a Pattern Overlay.
Hey, I had the room and I wanted to show a variation!)
• Figure 20-1: The Layer Style dialog box is special effects

2.
Click the Add Layer Style button at the bottom
of the palette, as shown in Figure 20-2.
3.
Select the effect that you want to apply from
the menu.
Here’s the second way:
1.
Use the Layers palette to select a layer.
2.
Choose Layer➪Layer Style and select the effect
that you want to apply from the menu.
In both cases, the Layer Style dialog box opens with
that effect selected. You can then select the settings
you need for that effect and add any other effects
that you would like to apply as well.
Layer styles can’t be applied to the Background
layer, a locked layer, or a layer set.

Select settings in the Structure area to shape
the bevel and emboss.
 Use the Style drop-down list to select a Bevel
and Emboss effect. You can choose from Outer
Bevel, Inner Bevel, Emboss, Pillow Emboss, and
Stroke Emboss. Refer to Figure 20-4 to find the
type of effect you’re looking for.
 Select a look for the effect by using the
Technique drop-down list. You can choose
from Smooth, Chisel Hard, and Chisel Soft.
 Select a Direction radio button to set whether
the bevel and emboss appears to go up or
down.

Click OK to close the Layer Style dialog box.
Applying Inner and Outer Glows
When you want to make a layer element stand out
or look like it’s lit from within, try applying an inner
glow or an outer glow. Glow effects work best with a
lot of contrast because the glow is typically a lighter
color, such as yellow or pink. So if you try to apply a
glow to a layer where the background color is white,
you probably won’t be able to see the glow until you
change the background to a darker color (or until
you change the glow to a darker color). Figure 20-7
shows both types of glows.
• Figure 20-7: Inner and outer glow layer styles.
The setting options for the two glows are the same
in the Layer Style dialog box. As shown in Figure 20-8,
the settings for the inner or outer glow are divided
into three areas: Structure, Elements, and Quality.
4.
In the Shading area, select settings to set 
the angle, shadows, and highlights. (See 
Figure 20-5.)
• Figure 20-5: Use the Shading area to set how the
shadows and highlights look.
 Set the direction of the light source by enter-
ing a degree in the Angle text box or by drag-
ging the tiny crosshair around the circle.
 Use the Altitude text box to enter a number in
degrees for the height of the light source. Zero
degrees shines light straight across the layer
from the left. Ninety degrees shines light
straight down onto the layer.
 Click the Gloss Contour Picker to select the
shape of the highlights and shadow, as shown
in Figure 20-6.
• Figure 20-6: Use the Gloss Contour Picker to select
highlight and shadow shape.

Blending a Color Overlay
139
• Figure 20-8: The settings are divided into three areas.
Open an image or create some type and give these
glows a try:
1.
Select a layer in the Layers palette.
2.
Click the Add Layer Style button at the bottom
of the Layers palette, and then choose Inner
Glow or Outer Glow from the menu.
The Layer Style dialog box opens with the Inner
Glow or Outer Glow effect selected. (Refer to
Figure 20-8.)
3.
In the Structure area, select the color and
opacity for the glow effect.
 Use the radio buttons to select whether the
glow is a solid color or a gradient. By default,
solid light yellow is selected. To change the
solid color, click the color square to open the
Color Picker. To select a gradient, click the
arrow to the right of the gradient swatch to
open the Gradient Picker.
 Set the opacity of the glow by using the
Opacity slider.
 To make the glow look grainy, use the Noise
slider.
 Use the Blend Mode drop-down list to select a
blending mode. (Blending modes are discussed
in Technique 17.)
4.
In the Elements area, set whether the glow 
originates from the center or edge, and set the
glow’s size.
 Use the Technique drop-down list to select
whether the glow is Softer or Precise. Precise
can create some jagged edges.
 Set the Source of the glow by selecting either
the Center or Edge radio button.
 Use the Choke and Size sliders to set how
large the glow is.
5.
In the Quality area, select the options that
determine the shape of the glow.
 Click the arrow to the right of the Contour
sample to open the Contour Picker. Contour
sets the shape of the glow.
 Use the Range slider to set the size of the
glow contour.
 If you selected a gradient to color the glow,
use the Jitter slider to make the glow grainy.
6.
Click OK to close the Layer Style dialog box.
Blending a Color Overlay
Applying a color overlay to a layer can dramatically
change the color of the layer depending on the blend-
ing mode that you select. If you select the Normal
blending mode, the solid color is applied to the layer.
However, select any other blending mode and the color
overlay blends with the layer’s current colors to create
something entirely different. Figure 20-9 shows a type
layer before and after a color overlay is applied. (For
more about blending modes, turn to Technique 17.)

Use the Opacity slider to set whether the color
overlay is solid (100%) or semi-transparent.
6.
Click OK to close the Layer Style dialog box.
Saving Layer Styles
After you create a great layer style, you probably
want to save it so that you can apply it to other lay-
ers. This can really come in handy — and save you
some time — if you’re working on a project and need
to use the same effect over and over. Layer styles are
saved as presets in the Styles palette.
Here’s how to save a layer style:
1.
Open the Layer Style dialog box by double-
clicking the layer style that you want to save in
the Layers palette.
2.
Click the New Style button.
The New Style dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 20-11.
• Figure 20-11: Use the New Style dialog box to save a
layer style as a preset.
3.
Enter a name for the new preset in the Name
text box.
4.
Select both the Include Layer Effects check
box and the Include Layer Blending Options
check box.
This saves the layer effect and blending mode
settings.
5.
Click OK to close the New Style dialog box.
6.
Click OK to close the Layer Style dialog box.
Check out your new layer style preset in the
Styles palette. (See Figure 20-12.)
• Figure 20-9: Color overlays can change a layer’s color
radically.
Here’s how to apply a color overlay:
1.
Select a layer in the Layers palette.
2.
Click the Add Layer Style button at the bottom
of the Layers palette, and then choose Color
Overlay from the menu.
The Layer Style dialog box opens with the Color
Overlay effect selected. (See Figure 20-10.)
• Figure 20-10: The Color Overlay settings are pretty
straightforward.
3.
Click the color square to the right of the Blend
Mode drop-down list to select a color with the
Color Picker.
4.
Use the Blend Mode drop-down list to select a
blending mode.
Experiment with the blending modes to see what
kind of interesting effects you can create.

Taking Layer Styles Apart
141
• Figure 20-12: The new layer style preset appears at the
end of the list in the Styles palette.
Presets are saved with Photoshop, not just with
an image file, so the layer style presets that
you create are always available for later use.
Applying Layer Style Presets
You can apply a layer style to a layer in several ways.
The first way that comes to mind is applying a layer
style preset to a layer by using the Styles palette. To
apply a layer style preset, just select a layer in the
Layers palette, and then click the preset in the Styles
palette.
You can also apply a layer style that you’ve created
(but not saved as a preset) by copying it to another
layer in the same image file or by copying it to an
entirely different image.
To copy a layer style to a different layer in the same
image or a different image, use the following steps:
1.
In the Layers palette, right-click/Control+click
the layer style that you want to copy and
choose Copy Layer Style from the contextual
menu.
If you want to copy a layer style effect that’s
made up of several layer styles, such as a drop
shadow, bevel, and color overlay, right-click/
Control+click the word Effects in the Layers
palette and choose Copy Layer Style from the
contextual menu. (See Figure 20-13.)
• Figure 20-13: Right-click/Control+click the layer style
that you want to copy.
2.
Select the layer that you want to copy the layer
style to in the Layers palette.
If you’re copying the layer style to another image,
select the image to make it active, and then select
the layer that you want to copy it to.
3.
Right-click/Control+click the selected layer and
choose Paste Layer Style from the contextual
menu.
Taking Layer Styles Apart
Layer styles can be really informative. If you ever
create a style and then say, “How does it do that?”
you can take the layer style apart to see what makes
it tick.

Technique 20: Creating Great Effects with Layer Styles
142
• Figure 20-15: When the layer style is separated into
individual layers, you can really get a
good idea how each effect works.
To check out the anatomy of a layer style, select the
layer containing the style in the Layers palette, and
then choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Create Layers. Each
layer style effect is separated onto its own layer
(some layer styles may create two layers).
Take a look at where the layers are located in the
Layers palette and check out their order. Figure 20-14
shows a heart with several layer styles applied: a drop
shadow, a bevel, and an inner glow. Figure 20-15 shows
the effects broken down into layers in the Layers
palette.
• Figure 20-14: The layer styles applied to this vector shape
can be separated into layers.

Recoloring with 
Fill Layers
O
ne day, you’re working on an advertising project for a client who
just has to include a particular photograph in the ad. The client
says that the photo is really great except that the shirt the model
is wearing is the wrong color or the background clashes with the furni-
ture or the flowers should be yellow, not pink! All you have to do is say,
“No problem,” get to your computer, and then use Photoshop to recolor
the area with a fill layer.
Fill layers are used to recolor a layer or selection by using another layer
instead of applying the correction to the actual image and altering the
image pixels forever. This layer-based recoloring leads to an amazing
amount of flexibility. You can always change the color without changing
the image itself. Also, because the area being recolored is defined with a
layer mask, you can adjust the layer mask anytime that you need to include
or exclude an area. (If you find that you need to alter the layer mask after
you create a fill layer, turn to Technique 49 for a complete discussion on
working with layer masks.)
This technique takes you through recoloring an image with a fill layer. It
may sound a bit scary or difficult, but it’s not! Using fill layers is really
easy. After you try them out, you discover just how flexible they are.
Applying a Fill Layer
A fill layer can be applied to an entire layer or a selection on a layer. If
you’re going to apply the fill layer to a selected area, really take the time
to make a good selection with the various selection tools. Be careful
about the edge of the selection. If the edge is high-contrast, meaning that
there’s an abrupt color change from the selected to unselected area (for
instance, dark blue to light tan), you might want to feather the selection
by one or two pixels. To feather a selection, choose Select➪Feather. (For
a complete rundown of the selection tools and selecting, take a look at
the selections chapter in Photoshop CS For Dummies by Deke McClelland
and yours truly, published by Wiley.)

When applying a fill layer to an image, you can
also use a gradient or pattern. If you want to do
so, select either Gradient or Pattern from the
menu.
• Figure 21-2: Choose Solid Color from the Create New Fill
or Adjustment Layer menu.

Use the Color Picker to select a color.
If you want to use the Color Picker to select a
specific spot or process color, click Custom, use
the Book drop-down list to select a color swatch
book, such as PANTONE Solid Coated, and then
select the specific color. (See Figure 21-3.)
As you select the color, notice that it appears in
the image window, though it may not blend in
well. (Don’t worry — you can fix that with a
blending mode.)
4.
When you’re finished selecting a color, click
OK to close the Color Picker.
The fill layer appears in the Layers window and
the new color appears in the image window, as
shown in Figure 21-4.
5.
In the Layers palette, use the Blend drop-down
list to select a blending mode.
After you select the right blending mode, the fill
layer’s pixels blend with the underlying layer. For
this example, I used the Multiply mode to blend
the pixels. The result is shown in Figure 21-5.
The other thing that you should be aware of when
using fill layers is blending modes. Blending modes
affect the way the fill layer’s color blends with the
layer underneath. If the new color that you’re using
in the fill layer is similar in saturation to the old
color, the Hue, Soft Light, or Color blending modes
may work best. If the new color is significantly
darker, experiment with the Multiply blending mode.
Try the Screen blending mode if the new color is
quite a bit lighter. Work with the blending modes
until you achieve the color that you’re looking for.
(For a complete discussion about blending modes,
turn to Technique 17.)
Here’s how to apply a fill layer:
1.
In the Layers palette, select the layer to which
you want to apply the fill layer.
However, if you want to recolor only a portion of
a layer, select the area on the layer. For this
example, I selected the white blouse worn by the
woman in Figure 21-1. Using a fill layer, I’m chang-
ing the blouse color to medium blue.
• Figure 21-1: I selected the white blouse with the
Magnetic Lasso and Lasso tools.
2.
Click the Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer
button at the bottom of the Layers palette and
choose Solid Color from the menu, as shown in
Figure 21-2.

• Figure 21-4: The new color appears in the image window,
though it may not blend well, yet.
• Figure 21-5: The right blending mode makes the fill
layers pixels blend with the image pixels.
Recoloring the Sneaky Way
Another way to recolor an image is to use the Hue/
Saturation command. This doesn’t allow the exact
color matching that using a fill layer does, but it’s a
fast way to change the color of a layer or selected
area. It’s not quite cheating, but it is a quick trick.
You can apply the Hue/Saturation command to the
actual layer pixels by choosing Image➪Adjustments➪
Hue/Saturation, or by applying the command by using
an adjustment layer (which I recommend). Using an
adjustment layer is similar to a fill layer in that it does
not alter the image pixels forever. (Take a look at
Technique 22 for a complete discussion about adjust-
ment layers and what they can do.)
Whichever way you decide to make the adjustment
(to the actual pixels or by using an adjustment layer),
here’s how to shift the color in an image:
1.
In the Layers palette, select the layer that you
want to recolor.
If you want to recolor only a portion of a layer,
select an area on the layer.

Technique 21: Recoloring with Fill Layers

4.
Use the Hue slider to recolor the layer or 
selection.
Notice that as you move the Hue slider, the new
color appears in the color bar at the bottom of
the Hue/Saturation dialog box.
5.
Click OK when the image is the right color.
Using the Hue/Saturation command, I changed
the blue blouse from Figure 21-5 to light tan, as
shown in Figure 21-7.
Figure 21-7: Using Hue/Saturation, I shifted the blouse
color from blue to tan.

Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Hue/Saturation to

at the bottom of the Layers palette and choose
Hue/Saturation from the menu.

Working with
Adjustment 
Layers
U
sing Photoshop CS, you can change the color and tone of an image
for correction purposes (a photograph might be underexposed)
or to create a special effect. Typically, you turn to the Image➪
Adjustments menu to find the command that makes the change you 
want: Levels, Hue/Saturation, or Color Balance just to name a few (actu-
ally, Photoshop has more than a dozen adjustment commands; I discuss
many in detail in Part V).
But, while the adjustment commands accessed on the Image menu work
just fine, they affect only the active layer and they permanently change the
layer’s pixels. What happens if you have a complex image containing eight
layers and you want to correct six of them at once? Well, you can merge
the layers together, but that ruins any further individual layer editing. So
that solution is certainly out of the question. You could also apply the
adjustment commands to each layer one at a time, but that is tedious, time
consuming, and also permanently changes the layers’ pixels — definitely
out of the question. As you’re starting to pull your hair out, you exclaim,
“But, Photoshop has everything so there must be an answer!”
Indeed there is and it’s a great one, too. The answer is to use adjustment
layers.
Adjustment layers use the same commands found on the Image➪
Adjustments menu, but they work as layer-based corrections. This gives
you an amazing amount of flexibility. Here are a few of the pluses inher-
ent in adjustment layers:

Layer-based corrections are not permanent unlike the commands on
the Image➪Adjustment menu. They blend only with the pixels on the
layers below; they don’t permanently change pixels. If you decide you
need to change the adjustment later, you can. If you decide you don’t
want to use the adjustment layer, you can either hide it by clicking the
eye icon on the Layers palette or delete it altogether.

• Figure 22-1: This photograph is way underexposed.
2.
Click the New Fill or Adjustment Layer button
at the bottom of the Layers palette, and choose
an adjustment command from the menu (see
Figure 22-2).
The top three commands on the menu are for
creating a fill layer. If you need to recolor an
image, turn to Technique 21 to find out how to
apply a fill layer.
Depending on the adjustment command you
select, the dialog box for that command appears,
as shown in Figure 22-3.
3.
Use the dialog box to make the adjustments,
and then click OK.
The adjustment layer appears in the Layers
palette and the image is corrected (see 
Figure 22-4).

The number of layers affected by the adjustment
layer depends upon where the adjustment layer
is located in the stacking order in the Layers
palette. Every layer under an adjustment layer is
modified. Any layers above the adjustment layer
are not modified. You can move the adjustment
layer up and down the stacking order to affect
more or fewer layers.

Because these corrections are layer-based, you
also have the option of selecting a blending
mode and opacity. While you can use Edit➪Fade
to employ a blending mode and opacity when
using the commands on the Image➪Adjustments
menu, the Fade command is available only imme-
diately after using the adjustment command.
Conversely, the Blend drop-down list and Opacity
slider are always available to the adjustment
layer in the Layers palette.
Quite a list, huh? I almost never use the commands
on the Image➪Adjustments menu; instead, I usually
opt for an adjustment layer. This technique shows
you how to add the power of adjustment layers to
your projects. Open an image and give them a try.
After you discover the full potential of adjustment
layers, I guarantee you won’t turn back.
Applying Adjustment Layers
Using adjustment layers is quite easy. Here’s how:
1.
Select the layer you want the adjustment layer
to appear above.
You can also use the selection tools to select a
specific area that you want to correct.
For this example, I’m using an underexposed
photograph of bottles (see Figure 22-1), and I use
the Levels command to correct it.

Adjusting the Adjustments

Adjusting the Adjustments
After you have an adjustment layer in place, you can
alter the applied command depending upon your
needs. Here’s a kitchen sink list of what you can do
with an adjustment layer:

Change the adjustment layer’s blending mode or
opacity using the Blend drop-down list or Opacity
slider in the Layers palette.

Change the amount of correction by changing
the command’s settings. To change the selected
settings for an adjustment layer, double-click
the layer’s thumbnail to open the command’s
dialog box.


Move the adjustment layer up or down the layer
stack in the Layers palette depending upon how
many layers you want to apply the adjustment to.

Copy an adjustment layer within the same docu-
ment by dragging the adjustment layer in the
Layers palette down over the Create New Layer
button.

Copy an adjustment layer to another image by
dragging the adjustment layer from the Layers
palette onto the other image window.

Make the effects of the adjustment layer perma-
nent by selecting it and then either:
 Choosing Layer➪Merge Down to merge the
adjustment layer to the layer below it. This
command applies the adjustment layer’s
effects only to the layer with which it is
merged.
 Choosing Layer➪Merge Visible to merge the
adjustment layer with all visible layers (the
ones with the eye icons showing in the Layers
palette).
 Choosing Layer➪Flatten to merge the adjust-
ment layer with all layers.

Hide the effects of an adjustment layer by click-
ing the eye icon to the left of the adjustment
layer in the Layers palette.

Delete an adjustment layer by dragging it to the
trashcan icon at the bottom of the Layers palette.

Target the adjustment layer corrections to a spe-
cific area by altering the layer mask attached to
the adjustment layer. (For details on working
with layer masks, turn to Technique 49.) For
instance, in Figure 22-5, I altered the layer mask
attached to the Levels adjustment layer (shown
in Figure 22-4), making the Levels correction
appear only on the right side of the image.

Everything You Ever
Needed to Know
about Creating
Brushes
B
rushes, brushes everywhere! So many to use and so little time!
Photoshop is your ultimate source for virtual brushes. Any kind of
brush that you can imagine you can design and save in Photoshop.
With so many options, you can create literally millions of brushes.
Brushes set the size and shape of the mouse cursor. When you select a
brush, you’re in effect selecting a brush tip. The shape of the brush tip
could be anything — round with a soft edge like a magic marker, or
square with a chalky texture like a pastel, for instance. (Also, don’t con-
fuse brushes with the Brush tool, which some Photoshop artists also
refer to as “the brush.”)
Many tools in Photoshop use brushes to define the size and shape of the
tool. Any tool that you use to stroke an image uses brush settings. When
working with these tools, besides selecting brush size and shape, you
also need to select other settings for the tool by using the Options bar;
possible settings include opacity, blending modes, and flow. Check out
the sidebar “Which tools use brushes?” for a complete list of tools.
This technique takes you into the wonderful and sometimes wacky world
of Photoshop brushes. Here, you find out where to locate brushes, how
to select them, and how to create your own custom brushes. If you use a
tablet with a pressure-sensitive stylus, I show you what settings work
with pressure and tilt. (For instance, you could set a brush to splatter
paint farther from the mouse cursor depending on how hard you’re
pressing.) From there, you discover how to save the brushes that you
create as presets and in brush libraries. Finally, you take a quick look at
brushes available on the Web and how to load them for your use in
Photoshop.
Which tools use brushes?
Many tools in Photoshop use brushes to define the size and shape of the tool. These
tools are Art History Brush, Background Eraser, Blur, Brush, Burn, Clone Stamp,
Color Replacement, Dodge, Eraser, History Brush, Pattern Stamp, Pencil, Sharpen,
Smudge, and Sponge.

• Figure 23-2: The Brushes palette is the central station for
brush selection and creation.
As shown in Figure 23-2, the Brushes palette is divided
into three areas. On the left in the rectangular box
are the brush settings. A check mark next to a brush
setting indicates that that setting is applied to the
currently selected brush. Options that you can select
for each brush setting are located at the right side
of the palette. These options change depending on
which brush setting is selected. At the bottom of the
palette is a brush preview area. When you select a
brush or create a new brush, a preview of the stroke
appears in this area.
Selected setting
Applied settings
Looking for Brushes in All 
the Right Places
You can go to two places in Photoshop to find
brushes: the Brush Preset picker and the Brushes
palette.
The Brush Preset picker, located on the Options bar
and shown in Figure 23-1, lets you select from brush
presets and also lets you change brush size and
hardness.
• Figure 23-1: The Brush Preset picker is used to select
brush presets and change brush size and
hardness.
The Brushes palette is where to go to select brushes,
change any kind of brush settings, and create custom
brushes. By default, the Brushes palette is docked in
the Palette Well. If you want, you can drag it by the
palette tab out into the Photoshop workspace, as
shown in Figure 23-2. If you don’t see the Brushes
palette, choose Window➪Brushes or press F5.

Creating Brushes
155
Creating Brushes
When you first start creating your own custom
brushes, keep it simple. Because so many options
are available in the Brushes palette, starting out can
be a bit overwhelming. If you start simply, you dis-
cover which brush setting affects a particular aspect
of the brush appearance. Otherwise, you may add so
many options that you don’t know which setting
does what.
Because Photoshop never does anything by halves,
you can actually create brushes in two ways:

Select an existing brush in the Brushes palette,
and then modify its appearance with the various
brush settings.

Create a brush by selecting pixels in the image
window and then using this selection to create a
new brush. The selected pixels could be any-
thing from a colorful speckled area to an actual
image, like a duck or shoe.
Using the Brushes palette
The first thing that you should do when creating a
custom brush with the Brushes palette is select Brush
Presets in the brush settings area, and then choose a
brush tip from the list as shown in Figure 23-3.
The next step is to change the settings of the brush
that you selected to meet your needs by using any of
the brush settings available in the Brushes palette.
In this section, I run through each available brush
setting. You can select and set as many or as few
brush settings as you want. For those of you using a
tablet and pressure-sensitive stylus, I highlight these
settings in each section. When you’re finished creat-
ing your custom brush, turn to the section “Saving
Presets and Libraries,” later in this technique, to
save your brush.
• Figure 23-3: Select a brush preset in the Brushes palette.
You may have noticed the tiny padlocks next to
each brush setting in the Brushes palettes. (See
Figure 23-4.) When a padlock is selected, it
locks those particular brush settings, freezing
them so that they can’t be changed by mistake.

Technique 23: Everything You Ever Needed to Know about Creating Brushes

• Figure 23-5: The Brush Tip Shape settings are used to set
brush diameter and spacing.

Adjust Roundness to make the brush tip shape
elliptical. A setting of 100% is round. The lower
the percentage, the shorter and fatter the brush
tip becomes.

If your Roundness setting is less than 100%, you
can enter a percentage in the Angle text box to
slant the brush tip. You can also change the
brush Angle by dragging the arrowhead in the
circle to the right of Angle and Roundness.

Soften the edges of the brush tip by adjusting the
Hardness setting. The lower the setting, the
softer the brush.

Use the Spacing setting to determine how often a
drop of paint falls from your brush tip. When you
stroke with a brush tip that’s set to a lower per-
centage, a solid line is created. Higher percent-
ages spread out the paint drops, making dotted
lines.
• Figure 23-4: Click the tiny padlock to freeze brush
settings.
Brush Tip Shape
Use the Brush Tip Shape settings to select the
brush’s diameter, angle, hardness, and spacing, as
shown in Figure 23-5. Figure 23-6 shows the effects of
these settings.
Make the most of the following Brush Tip Shape 
settings:

Change brush width by moving the Diameter
slider. Moving the slider to the left makes the
brush tip smaller, and moving the slider to the
right makes it bigger.

The brush that you selected might be directional:
for instance, a leaf leaning to the right. Select the
Flip X check box to flip the brush tip horizontally
(this would make the leaf lean to the left), and
select the Flip Y check box to flip the brush tip
vertically (this would flip the leaf upside down).

Shape Dynamics
Shape Dynamics are used to vary the width, angle,
and roundness during a brush stroke. In the Brushes
palette, click the name Shape Dynamics (not the
check box) to view the settings shown in Figure 23-7.
Notice how the Shape Dynamics settings are divided
into three areas: Size Jitter, Angle Jitter, and Round-
ness Jitter. Jitter refers to how randomly these settings
are applied during a brush stroke. For instance, 0%
Size Jitter doesn’t change the size of the brush dur-
ing a stroke, but 100% Size Jitter allows random size
changes during a stroke.
Each setting also includes a Control drop-down list.
Control sets how the random effect is manipulated.
All of these effects have the following Control 
settings:
A
B
C
• Figure 23-7: Shape Dynamics are used to vary the width

three options are for use with a pressure-sensitive

Take a look at Figure 23-8 to see the Shape Dynamics
settings in action. The stroke labeled A is the base
stroke. Stroke B adds the Size Jitter option, stroke C
adds the Angle Jitter option to stroke B, and stroke D
adds Roundness Jitter to stroke C.

158

Use the Roundness Jitter slider to set how much
the roundness of the brush tip changes during a
stroke. A higher setting makes for more variation.
Scattering
Scattering sets how a brush mark is placed during a
stroke. The higher the Scatter setting, the more
marks spread away from the stroke’s path. Figure
23-9 shows the Scattering options available in the
Brushes palette. Figure 23-10 shows the Scattering
brush effect in action.
• Figure 23-9: Use the Scattering brush settings to splatter
the paint around the brush stroke.

Jitter. B: 75% Size Jitter, 10% Minimum
Diameter. C: 75% Angle Jitter. D: 100%
Roundness Jitter, 1% Minimum Roundness.
Here’s the scoop on the Jitter bug:

Use the Size Jitter slider to set how randomly
the brush tip size changes during a stroke. A set-
ting of 0% allows for no change, and a 100% set-
ting allows for the maximum amount of random
change.

If your brush tip is set to less than 100% round-
ness on the Brush Tip Shape panel, you can use
the Angle Jitter slider to set how randomly the
angle of the brush tip changes during a stroke.
The higher the setting, the more angle changes
occur.


Move the Scatter slider to set how widely brush
marks are placed around the path of a stroke.
The higher the setting, the farther the brush
marks are from the stroke.

Use the Count option to set how many brush
marks occur as a stroke is made (based on the
Spacing setting selected on the Brush Tip Shape
panel). The Count Jitter setting randomizes the
Count option setting.

Both the Scatter and Count settings include a
Control drop-down list. Control sets how the
effect is manipulated. The Control settings are:
 Fade: This option sets how a stroke fades out
from the start of the stroke to the end of the
stroke.
A

C
 Pen Pressure, Pen Tilt, and Stylus Wheel:
These three options are for use with a pres-
sure sensitive tablet and pen.
Texture
The Texture brush settings can be used in two ways:
to create the effect of painting on a textured surface
such as burlap or rice paper, or to add a special tex-
tured effect that makes your brush strokes stand
out. Figure 23-11 shows the Texture settings in the
Brushes dialog box. Figure 23-12 shows a few tex-
tured strokes.
• Figure 23-11: The Texture brush settings changes the

Dual Brush
The Dual Brush setting combines two brush tips to
create a new, combination brush tip. Figure 23-13
shows the Dual Brush options.
• Figure 23-13: By using the Dual Brush settings, you can
stroke with two brush tips at the same
time.
Use the following steps to create a combination
brush tip:
1.
Use the brush tip picker at the right of the
Brushes palette to select a second brush tip, as
shown in Figure 23-13.
2.
Select a blending mode from the Mode drop-
down list.
This sets how the two brush tips blend together.
Add some texture to your world with the following
options:

Click the Pattern Picker to select a pattern for
the texture.

Use the Scale slider to set how large the pattern
is. The higher the percentage, the larger the 
pattern.

Choose blending mode from the Mode drop-down
list to set how the stroke colors blend with the
colors already present in the image. (For more
about blending modes, turn to Technique 17.)

Select the Texture Each Tip check box to set
how the selected blending mode mixes the brush
colors throughout the stroke.

Move the Spacing slider to set how far apart
each second brush tip dab is when you stroke
with the combination brush.
5.
Use the Scatter slider to set how far the second
brush tip’s mark spreads within the area of the
first brush tip.

Move the Count slider to set how many of the
second brush’s marks are made based on the
Spacing setting for the first brush.
Take a look at Figure 23-14 to see two examples

Color Dynamics
Color Dynamics are really fabulous: They set how the
color of the brush tip changes as you stroke with it.
So instead of creating a stroke that’s just bright red,
for instance, that stroke could change from bright red
to pink to burgundy, or even further through the color
spectrum to include an entire rainbow of colors.
Figure 23-15 shows the Color Dynamics options in
the Brushes palette.
• Figure 23-15: Use the Color Dynamics settings to change
your strokes from mono-color to multicolor.
Before selecting Color Dynamics settings, you need
to select the Foreground and Background colors that
you want to use as the basis for the color change as
you stroke. So, click the Foreground and Background
color squares in the Toolbox and use the Color
Picker to select colors.

Technique 23: Everything You Ever Needed to Know about Creating Brushes
162
Other Dynamics
Use the Other Dynamics settings to select Opacity
Jitter and Flow Jitter. Opacity Jitter sets how much
the opacity changes during a stroke. Flow Jitter sets
how the amount of paint applied during a stroke
changes. Both of these settings are based on the
Opacity and Flow settings selected in the Options
bar for the tool that you’re using.
Noise, Wet Edges, Airbrush, Smoothing, 
Protect Texture
The rest of the brush settings in the Brushes palette
add special effects or limitations to your strokes.

Noise adds a grainy quality to strokes. This setting
works best with brush tips that have softer edges
(that is, they have a lower Hardness setting).

Select Wet Edges to give the brush stroke a
watercolor appearance.

The Airbrush option works just like the Airbrush
button on the Options bar. With this option
selected, the paint pumps from the brush tip, let-
ting it build up. This works especially well if you
hold the mouse in one position.

Smoothing evens out the rough spots of your
strokes.

Select Protect Texture if you’re painting textured
lines and you want the lines to match. With this
option selected, Photoshop restricts brush
stroke textures, keeping them consistent from
one brushstroke to the next.
Using an image
You can also create brush tips by using any selected
pixels in the image window. This could be a spray of
dots that might imitate a real-life stipple brush or an
image such as a duck. Here’s how:
1.
Choose File➪New to create a new Photoshop
image with a white background.
For dynamic color, set the following options:

Move the Foreground/Background Jitter slider
to set how much variation exists between the
Foreground and Background colors. The Control
drop-down list is used to set how the effect is
manipulated.

Use the Hue Jitter, Saturation Jitter, and
Brightness Jitter sliders to set how far the color
can vary from the Foreground and Background
colors. Lower settings keep the colors within the
Foreground and Background color’s tonal range.
Higher settings move the colors farther from the
original tonal range. 

Move the Purity slider to change the saturation of
the color. A higher setting adds more saturation.
Figure 23-16 shows two brush strokes. The first
stroke, A, uses just one color (the Foreground color).
The second stroke, B, has Color Dynamics settings
applied with two colors (the Foreground and

Loading Brush Libraries
Several brush libraries ship with Photoshop but
aren’t automatically loaded into the Brushes palette
or Brush Preset picker. Some of these brush libraries
include calligraphic, square, and special effects
brushes. Load a new brush library and give it a try.
Having a few new brushes is a great way to expand
your Photoshop painting and editing repertoire.
Here’s how:
Thankfully, you can easily save a brush as a preset
and also save it in a library with other brushes that
you create.
Here’s how to save a brush as a preset:

Creating a Painting
by Using an Image
A
s you can imagine, almost as many ways of painting in Photoshop
exist as Photoshop artists exist to paint with them. Three of the
most commonly used painting methods range from simple at first
glance (but really rather difficult to use) to slightly roundabout (and
really easy to use):

Starting from scratch: Start with a blank image window (a canvas)
and use the painting tools to stroke on color, outlines, and textures.
Although this method is the simplest to set up, it can actually be the
hardest because you’re starting entirely from scratch.

Tracing an image: Use tracing paper over an image or photo. The trac-
ing paper is a new, empty layer positioned above an image. You trace
the image and then select colors and use the paint tools to fill in the
colors. Although this method isn’t as hard as starting from scratch, it
does include selecting colors by using either the image or the Color
Picker, selecting brushes, and sketching.

Painting over an image: Use the colors in a photo or image as if they
were wet paint. You stroke with various brushes to create the outlines
and textures while simultaneously sampling the colors from the image.
Although this method seems a little bit roundabout, it’s actually remark-
ably easy because you’re using the colors and textures already available
in the image.
This technique explores the third method. You prep the canvas by first
opening the image that you’re going to use and then adding two layers.
The first layer will be filled with a simple noise pattern. This speckled
noise layer is used to mix with the “paint” from the image to help show
brush strokes and add texture. The second layer is empty and you can
use it to actually paint on.
After you’re finished painting, you add two more layers. The first one
gives your paint strokes the appearance of more texture, making the
strokes appear to stand out from the canvas. The second layer is filled
with a canvas pattern to make the painting look like it was actually
painted on canvas.

3.
Click the Create New Layer button at the bottom
of the Layer palette.
A new empty layer appears above the image. You
can rename the layer to something meaningful, if
you want. For this example, I renamed the layer
Noise Speckle.
4.
Select white as the Foreground color.
A fast way to do this is to press D, and then 
press X.
5.
Select the Bucket tool from the Toolbox and
click in the image window.
The layer is filled with solid white, obscuring the
image below.
6.
With the white layer still selected in the Layers
palette, choose Filter➪Noise➪Add Noise.
7.
Use the Add Noise dialog box to select noise
settings.
Set the Amount to 20%, select the Gaussian 
radio button under Distribution, and select 
the Monochromatic check box, as shown in
Figure 24-2.
• Figure 24-2: Use the Add Noise dialog box to create a
speckled appearance.
This all may sound rather complicated, but in prac-
tice it’s simple to do! Just follow the steps. You 
can see the results in color if you check out Color
Plate 24-1.
Think of this technique as a mini painting lesson at
your local art studio. Don your smock, grab your
palette, easel, and brushes, and get ready to paint by
using an existing image. And don’t forget to have fun!
Preparing the Canvas
As any painter knows, before you start painting you
need to prepare your canvas. In this case, the canvas
is an image opened in Photoshop with two extra lay-
ers added. Here’s how:
1.
Open the image that you want to use for your
painting.
For this example, I use a photograph of a calla
lily, which is shown in Figure 24-1.
• Figure 24-1: For this example, this photograph is the
basis for a painting.
2.
Choose File➪Save As to save the image with
another filename.
That way, your original image has not been
altered and is always available.

Ready, Get Set, Smudge!
169
8.
Click OK to close the Add Noise dialog box and
apply the filter to the white layer.
The layer is now speckled.
9.
With the white speckled layer selected in the
Layers palette, use the Blending Mode drop-
down list in the Layers palette to select Soft
Light.
Soft Light mode blends the white speckled layer
with the image layer below, giving a grainy appear-
ance. As you paint, this white speckled layer helps
to show your strokes and add texture.
10.
Click the Create New Layer button at the bottom
of the Layers palette.
A new empty layer appears above the speckled
layer. You’re going to paint on this layer. You can
rename it, if you want. For this example, I’ve
renamed the layer Painting, as shown in Figure
24-3. You now have three layers and your canvas
is prepared. Get ready to paint!
• Figure 24-3: You’re going to paint on the upper, empty
layer.
Ready, Get Set, Smudge!
Huh? You thought that you were painting didn’t you?
Well, you are. Two types of tools in the Toolbox use
brushes to define their shape. These tools are the
ones that you use when creating a Photoshop paint-
ing. The painting tools (the Brush and Pencil tools)
apply a selected color to an image. The editing tools
(the Blur, Sharpen, Smudge, Dodge, Burn, and Sponge
tools) modify existing colors in an image. All these
tools are used in the same way: You stroke them
across the image window to apply or modify color
just like you would a real-life brush on canvas.
For this technique, the Smudge tool is used to sample
the colors from the bottom image layer as you set it
up in the previous section. The sampled color is actu-
ally stroked onto the empty layer above the image
layer and noise layer shown in Figure 24-3. (If you
haven’t prepared your image for painting, go back to
“Preparing the Canvas” and follow the steps.) Time to
get started!
1.
Select the Smudge tool from the Toolbox.
2.
Select the settings that you need on the
Options bar.
 Use the Mode drop-down list to select Normal.
 Move the Strength slider 100%.
 Enable the Use All Layers check box.
 Make sure that the Finger Painting check box
is unchecked.
3.
Use the Brushes palette to select a brush tip.
You can use brushes from any of the brush
libraries. (To find out how to load brush libraries
and create custom brushes, turn to Technique 23.)
If this is your first time painting in Photoshop,
select a large, textured brush. One of my favorites
is 100 Rough Round Bristle found in the default
brush set. This brush gives big textured strokes.
4.
With the empty painting layer selected, start
stroking the canvas.
Keep your strokes small and follow the lines of
the image with your strokes, as shown in Figure
24-4. For instance, if you’re trying to paint a leaf,
stroke in the direction of the leaf’s veins. Pull any

Technique 24: Creating a Painting by Using an Image

5.
Continue painting with the Smudge tool until
you’re satisfied.
If you’re working on a small area, you can zoom
in to see it more clearly. Also, if you’re working
close up, open a second image window as
described in Technique 5 to view your painting
at actual size as you stroke the magnified image.
Use the Brush tool to add highlights to any
areas that need special outlining or emphasis.
Use the Eyedropper tool to select a highlighting
color from the image and select a hard, small
brush to perform the highlighting. You can
stroke this highlighting onto the same layer that
you’ve been painting on with the Smudge tool,
or you can create a new layer above the paint-
ing layer just for highlights. I recommend this
extra highlighting layer because you can always
correct or add any highlights later without
affecting the painting layer.
Finishing Your Painting
After you finish working with the Smudge tool, you
can finish your painting by adding two layers on
top of the painting layer. The first layer gives your
brush strokes the appearance of more texture in an
interesting and — to my mind — rather clever way.
The second layer adds a canvas texture to give the
impression that the image was actually painted on
canvas. Here’s how:
1.
In the Layers palette, select the painting layer.
2.
Choose Layer➪New➪Layer Via Copy.
This copies the selected layer. The new copied
layer appears in the Layers palette above the
original. Rename this copied layer if you want.
For this example, I’ve renamed the layer Texture.
3.
With the copied layer selected in the Layers
palette, choose Filter➪Stylize➪Emboss.
darker shaded areas up into lighter areas for con-
trast. You can always switch brushes if you need
a smaller brush or one with a differently shaped
tip. Also, a tablet and stylus can really come into
their own. If you have a tablet, use it. You’ll be
surprised at the good results.
If your strokes don’t look right, or if you feel
that you made a mistake, don’t worry! You can
always undo the previous stroke by pressing
Ctrl/Ô+Z or by using the History palette to
move back a few history states. If after a while
you’re really unsatisfied with your painting,
you can always select the entire layer, and
then choose Edit➪Clear to start fresh with an
empty layer.
• Figure 24-4: As you stroke with the Smudge tool, the
color from the image layer is painted onto
the empty painting layer.

Use the Emboss dialog box to select settings, as
shown in Figure 24-5.
 Set the Angle to follow the direction of the
lighting in your image. For the calla lily photo-
graph that I’m using, the light is coming from
the upper-left corner, so a setting of 135
degrees works well.
 Set the Height to 5 pixels.
 Set the Amount to 125%. (Higher settings add
more texture.)
• Figure 24-5: Select the Emboss settings to add more
texture to the brush strokes.
5.
Click OK to close the Emboss dialog box.
6.
In the Layers palette, select Overlay from the
Blending Mode drop-down list.
This blends the embossed paint strokes with the
painting layer below. You can also use Soft Light
blending mode for a softer appearance.
7.
With the embossed layer still selected, click the
Create New Layer button at the bottom of the
Layers palette.
A new, empty layer appears at the top of the
layer stack. You can rename this layer, if you
want. For this example, I’ve renamed the layer
Canvas.
8.
Select white as the Foreground color.
A fast way to do this is to press D, and then 
press X.
9.
Select the Bucket tool from the Toolbox and
click in the image window.
The new layer is filled with solid white, obscur-
ing the painting below. You should now have five
layers, as shown in Figure 24-6.
• Figure 24-6: After adding the two new layers, you should
have five layers in your painting.
10.
Choose Filter➪Texture➪Texturizer.
11.
Use the Texturizer dialog box to select the set-
tings shown in Figure 24-7.
 At the right side of the dialog box, use the
Texture drop-down list to select Canvas.
 Set the Scaling to 200%.

This blends the canvas layer with the rest of the
painting.
14.
Use the Opacity slider to lower the opacity until
you can see only a hint of the canvas texture.
Adjust the slider until you’re happy with the
results. For my calla lily painting, a setting of 30%
works pretty well, as shown in Figure 24-8. Color
Plate 24-1 shows the calla lily painting in full
color. Sit back and enjoy your painting!
• Figure 24-8: After you add the embossed paint strokes
and the canvas texture, the painting looks

 Set the Relief to 15.
 Use the Light drop-down list to select the
direction from which the light comes in your
image. For my example, because the light is
coming from the upper left in the original calla
lily photograph, I selected the Top Left option.

Painting Back 
in Time
O
nly with a time machine or with Photoshop can you paint back-
ward through history. Thanks to the powerful History palette, you
can select a previous history state and use either the History Brush
or Art History Brush to stroke away the image’s current state and reveal
the past history state.
This technique uses a simple example to show you how you can paint
backward in time. First, I give you a quick look at the History palette just
to show you what’s available there and how to use it. Then, you apply a
filter to an image and use the History Brush to remove the effects of the
filter. Using the History Brush is interesting and easy. 
Getting to Know the History Palette
The History palette records every command and operation that you use
in Photoshop. This includes brush strokes, Foreground and Background
color changes, blending mode changes, and anything that you do that
affects the image window. Figure 25-1 shows the History palette with a
selected history state. By default, the History palette is grouped with the
Actions palette at the right side of the program window. If you don’t see
the History palette, choose Window➪History.
You can do many things with the History palette. I don’t list all of them
here, but the following list gives you an idea of the power and scope of
this great palette:

Move back to a previous history state by selecting it in the History
palette. When you click the previous history state, the image in the
image window reverts to that previous state. You can set how many
history states the History palette records by choosing Edit➪
Preferences➪General (Windows) or Photoshop➪Preferences➪General
(Mac), and then entering a number from 1–100 in the History States
text box.

Create a new document based on the currently selected history state
by clicking the Create New Document from Current State button at the
bottom of the History palette.

Technique 25: Painting Back in Time
174
Painting with History
The example that I use here is very simple. It shows
you how to use the History Brush by selecting a pre-
vious history state as a source. Here are the basic
steps that I’ve taken to accomplish this:
1.
Apply a filter to an image.
2.
Select the history state before the filter com-
mand as the source for the History Brush.
3.
Use the History Brush to return portions of the
image to its original appearance before the fil-
ter was applied.
Even though the example is simple, the principle
always works the same: No matter how many history
states are recorded in the History palette, you can
use any history state as a source for the History
brush. Just follow these steps:
1.
Open an image that you want to use as the
basis for painting with the History Brush.
For this example, I’m using the ballerina photo-
graph shown in Figure 25-2.
• Figure 25-2: Select an image to use as the basis for a
painting.
2.
Choose File➪Save As and save the image with
another filename.

Create a snapshot of an image before performing
a complicated editing procedure by clicking the
Create New Snapshot button at the bottom of the
History palette. This snapshot saves the entire
state of the image, including layers, blending
modes, active selections — you name it. If you
make a mistake or want to revert to the state
saved by the snapshot for any reason, simply
click the snapshot at the top of the History
palette. Turn to Technique 7 to find out more
about creating and using snapshots.

Select a previous history state as the source for
the History Brush and Art History Brush by click-
ing in the left column next to the desired history
state. When a history state is set as the source,
any painting that you do with the History Brush
or Art History Brush restores those areas to the
selected history state.
The fourth bullet point is the focus of this technique.

That way, your original image is not altered and
is always available.
3.
Make any tonal adjustments that you think nec-
essary to improve the color and balance of the
image.
For the ballerina photograph, I increased the sat-
uration and adjusted the highlights by using
Levels.
4.
Apply a filter to the image.
For this example, I applied the Watercolor filter
to the ballerina photograph, as shown in 
Figure 25-3.
• Figure 25-3: The ballerina photograph looks quite different
after the Watercolor filter is applied.
5.
With the current history state selected in the
History palette, click in the left column next 
to the previous history state, as shown in
Figure 25-4.
Be sure that you don’t select the previous his-
tory state.
6.
Select the History Brush from the Toolbox.
7.
Use the Brushes palette to select a brush tip
shape.
For the ballerina example, I selected a small
round brush of medium hardness. (To find out
more about the Brushes palette, turn to
Technique 23.)
• Figure 25-4: Click the left column to select the previous
history state as the source for the History
Brush.
8.
Use the Options bar to select History Brush 
settings.
 Use the Mode drop-down list to select the
Normal blending mode.
 Set Opacity and Flow to 100%.
Experiment with different settings to see what
kind of results you get.
9.
Stroke in the image window with the History
Brush.
As you stroke, notice that the previous history
state is revealed. For the ballerina example, I’m
just stroking over the ballerina’s face and arms
to return them to the state before the Watercolor
filter was applied, as shown in Figure 25-5.

The Big Color
Swap Meet
S
uppose you’re designing a family Web site and you have five photo-
graphs of your children that you want to put on one Web page. The
pictures were taken at different times and in different lighting condi-
tions, so unfortunately the tone of each photograph is different — one
has a bluish cast, one looks yellow, another is reddish, well, you get the
picture (pun intended). Because the photographs are all going on one
Web page, they should be as uniform as possible in color range and tone.
But, how are you going to do it?
Photoshop has the answer: the Match Color command. By using the Match
Color command, you can select the color and tone from the photograph
that you like best and apply it to the other photos, adjusting their colors
and tones to match. You can also use the Match Color command to apply
the colors from one layer to another within the same image or from one
selection to another within the same image or different images.
The Match Color command is especially good for matching skin tones.
So, if you have three photographs of the same model, but the color cast
of her face is slightly different in each photograph, you can use the
Match Color command to even out the skin tones between the three
photographs.
In this technique, you find out how to use the Match Color command to
enhance your images by evening out tone and color. You also discover
how to save and load Match Color settings for later use. Color Plate 26-1
shows you the results of the images used in this technique.
The Match Color command works only on images set in RGB color
mode.

• Figure 26-2: This dark photograph is going to change
dramatically when the color source is

Okay, here’s how the Match Color command works:
1.
Open the image(s) that you want to use to
match colors.
If you want to select portions of an image or
layer for use as the source color or as target
areas, use the selection tools to select those
areas.
For this example, I’m using two images: Man.psd
and Woman.psd, shown in Figures 26-1 and 26-2.
2.
Make sure that the target image is selected and
in front or the target layer is selected in the
Layers palette.
3.
Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Match Color.
The Match Color dialog box shown in Figure 26-3
opens. Notice the upper area of the dialog box,
labeled Destination Image. This area is used for
target settings. The bottom area, labeled Image
Statistics, is used to select source settings.
Swapping Colors
For this example, I’m selecting an area of one image
as the color source and applying this color source to
a target image. The color source is going to be the
selected area in Figure 26-1, the lighter portion of the
man’s face. The color cast in his face is rather red.
This photograph is saved as Man.psd.
• Figure 26-1: The selected area of the man’s face is going
to be used as the color source.
The target image that will receive the colors from
the selected source area is going to be the rather
dark photograph of a woman shown in Figure 26-2.
The woman’s face is obscured by shadow and the
color cast of the entire photograph is rather bluish.
This photograph is saved as Woman.psd.

• Figure 26-3: The Match Color dialog box is divided into
two areas: Target settings are on the top,
and source settings are on the bottom.
When the Match Color command is selected,
the mouse pointer automatically changes to
the Eyedropper tool if you need to sample
colors from an image.
4.
In the Image Statistics area, select the color
source by using the various drop-down lists
and check boxes.
 Use the Source drop-down list to select an
image as the color source.
 Use the Layer drop-down list to select a layer
as the color source.
 If you selected an area in a different image as
the color source, enable the Use Selection in
Source to Calculate Colors check box.
 If you selected an area within the target image
as the color source, enable the Use Selection
in Target to Calculate Adjustment check box.
Because I’m using a selection in the Man.psd
image as the source image, I selected the image
by using the Source drop-down list and selected
the Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colors
check box. After I’ve selected the source, the col-
ors in my target image, Woman.psd, change dra-
matically. (See Figure 26-4.) However, the color
cast is way too red and overly bright. I fix these
problems in the next step.

and check box to modify the color adjustment.
 Drag the Luminance slider to the left to make
the target image darker. Drag it to the right to
make the image brighter.
 Drag the Color Intensity slider left to decrease
the saturation of the target image. Drag it right
to increase the saturation.
 Drag the Fade slider to fade the amount of
the color adjustment.
 Select the Neutralize check box to bring the
color cast to a more neutral tonal range area.
This reduces excessive color casts.

1.
After you finish adjusting the target image
settings as described in the previous section,
“Swapping Colors,” click Save Statistics at the
bottom of the Match Color dialog box.
2.
Use the Save dialog box that opens to move to
the folder where you want to keep the Match
Color information.
3.
Enter a name for the information in the
Name text box (Windows) or the Save As
text box (Mac).
4.
Click Save.
The Save dialog box closes and you return to the
Match Color dialog box.
5.
Click OK to close the Match Color dialog box.
After you’ve saved Match Color settings, you can
easily apply them to any image or photograph by
following these steps:
1.
Open the image to which you want to apply the
Match Color settings.
2.
Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Match Color.
3.
At the bottom of the Match Color dialog box,
click Load Statistics.
4.
Use the Load dialog box to locate the folder
where the Match Color information is stored
and select the file.
5.
Click Load to load the color information, close
the Load dialog box, and return to the Match
Color dialog box.
The saved Match Color settings are applied to
the image that you opened in Step 1.
6.
Use the Destination Image area in the Match
Color dialog box to modify the color adjustment.
Take a look at the previous section, “Swapping
Colors,” for more information about these
settings.
7.
Click OK to close the Match Color dialog box.
For my example, I selected the Neutralize check
box to reduce the reddish cast of the target image.
Then, because the image looked a little washed
out, I lowered the Luminance slightly (to 84) and
adjusted the Fade to 20. Figure 26-5 shows the
finished target photograph. Quite a difference
from its original color and tone as it originally
appears in Figure 26-2.
• Figure 26-5: After the color and tone in this image are
adjusted, the photograph looks quite
different.
6.
When you’re finished adjusting the target
image settings, click OK to close the Match
Color dialog box.
Saving and Loading Match
Color Settings
If you want to apply the same color adjustment
settings to several photographs, the best thing
that you can do is save the Match Color settings
and then load them when you need them later.

Recoloring with
Gradients
I
n Photoshop, a gradient is a smooth transition from one color to
another, or from a color to transparency. For instance, gradients
can contain one color that fades to transparency, two colors such
as black and white where the transition area between the black and
white are various shades of gray, or many colors that blend from one
color to the next.
One way that you can change the color of an image in Photoshop is by
using gradient maps. Gradient maps recolor an image by looking at the
image as if it were set in grayscale mode, finding the lightest and darkest
pixels in the image, and then assigning colors (or mapping them) to the
pixels based on the lights and darks.
This technique focuses on recoloring images by using gradient maps.
First, you adjust image color by applying a gradient map directly to an
image. You can check out the results and see if they’re something that
you think you could use. Then, you take a look at applying gradient maps
to layers and using blending modes to blend image pixels. You might be
surprised at the sometimes subtle, oft times wacky results that can hap-
pen. Check out Color Plate 27-1 to see the different colorful results.
Applying a Gradient Map
You can apply a gradient map to a colored image to recolor it with new
color tones and hues. Or, you can apply a gradient map to a grayscale
image to colorize it. This can result in an image that looks something like
a duotone or tritone depending on the number of colors in the gradient
that you use. (To find out how to create actual duotones, turn to
Technique 35.)
You don’t have to recolor an entire layer or image. You can always
select a portion of a layer for recoloring and apply a gradient map to
the selected area only.

• Figure 27-2: My pal the vulture dressed in his original
feathers (left) and recolored with a Copper

• Figure 27-3: Select a gradient library to load from the
bottom of the Gradient picker menu.
To recolor an image by using a gradient map:
1.
Open the image that you want to recolor.
2.
Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Gradient Map.
The Gradient Map dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 27-1.
• Figure 27-1: In the Gradient Map dialog box, the
gradients are selected with the Gradient
picker.
3.
Use the Gradient picker to select a gradient.
4.
Select the Dither check box if you want to add
some noise to smooth the gradient’s colors.
5.
Select the Reverse check box if you want to
change the direction of the gradient.
6.
Click OK.
The Gradient Map dialog box closes and the
image is recolored, as shown in Figure 27-2.
Several gradient libraries ship with Photoshop
that aren’t automatically installed in the
Gradient picker. To load a gradient library
while using the Gradient Map dialog box,
click the tiny arrow at the upper right of the
Gradient Picker and choose a gradient library
from the bottom of the menu, as shown in
Figure 27-3.
Although the Gradient Map command does quickly
recolor an image, the color change shown in Fig-
ure 27-2 is rather crude and doesn’t really resemble
the original’s shading of lights and darks.

Recoloring an Image Using Layers and Blending Modes
183
Recoloring an Image Using
Layers and Blending Modes
Another way to recolor an image with gradient map-
ping is to use layers and blending modes. What you
do is create a copy of the layer containing the image
that you want to recolor, apply a gradient map to the
copied layer, and then use a blending mode to blend
the copied layer’s pixels with the original layer. Find
an image and give this a try:
1.
Open the image that you want to recolor.
I’m using my feathered vulture friend again. (He
was last seen lurking in Figure 27-2.)
2.
In the Layers palette, select the layer contain-
ing the image that you want to recolor.
3.
Choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy.
A copy of the original layer appears in the Layers
palette.
4.
Select the copied layer in the Layers palette.
5.
Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Gradient Map.
6.
In the Gradient Map dialog box that appears
(refer to Figure 27-1), use the Gradient picker
to select a gradient.
7.
Click OK to close the Gradient Map dialog box
and apply the gradient to the copied layer.
8.
In the Layers palette, use the Blending Mode
drop-down list to select a blending mode.
For a first try, I suggest using Color mode. This
blends the colors in the copied layer with the
colors in the original layer. Experiment with the
blending modes to see what kind of results you
get. Some can be quite subtle, but others are
downright bizarre. Check out the vulture’s recol-
oring in Figure 27-4. (He doesn’t look too happy
about it!)
You can also apply a gradient map as an adjustment
layer. To find out more about adjustment layers and
how to use them, take a look at Technique 22.
• Figure 27-4: The vulture is recolored by using various
gradients and blending modes.

checked, Hue blending mode

Technique 27: Recoloring with Gradients
184
To enhance the contrast between the colors
added by the gradient mapped layer, insert a
Posterize adjustment layer between the origi-
nal layer and the copied layer. You can do this
by selecting the original layer and then click-
ing the Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer
button at the bottom of the Layers palette.
Select Posterize from the menu and then
set the number of levels to 4 or 5. (Turn to
Technique 22 for more about adjustment
layers.)

Creating Custom
Patterns
P
atterns are fantastic! You can use them to create backgrounds, add
texture, fill layers, even stamp and paint. You have many ways to
create patterns. You can use filters to create textures that can be
saved as patterns, use the Pattern Maker filter to create a pattern by
using an image, or scan textured or marbled papers for use as patterns.
This technique explores how to create patterns by using various filters,
including the Pattern Maker filter. You also find out how to save and load
pattern libraries. (Did you know that Photoshop ships with several pat-
tern libraries that aren’t automatically loaded into the Pattern picker?)
After creating some great patterns here, turn to Technique 29 to find out
how you can use them!
Downloading patterns from the Web
Many great sites offer patterns for download from the Web. Some of the pattern
sets are free, and some cost a few bucks. To get you started, here are two sites that
offer free downloads: Adobe Studio Exchange at http://share.studio.adobe.
com and Free Photoshop at www.freephotoshop.com/html/downloadables.
html. To find more sites offering patterns for download, type Photoshop patterns
into your favorite search engine.
Creating Patterns by Using
Textures and Scans
You can create patterns by using any kind of textures. If you have access
to a scanner, you can scan cloth, paper, wood, or anything that has a nice
texture. If the color of the scan doesn’t suit you, you can always change it
in Photoshop before turning the scan into a pattern. Filters are also great
for creating textures even if you are just using a solid white layer as the
basis for the texture. (You can, of course, use any colors that you want.)
If you want to scan some paper or cloth to create a texture but need help
with performing the scan, turn to Technique 10.

Creating a texture
For this example, I show you how to create a brick
texture and turn it into a pattern. You can, of course,
substitute any texture for the brick texture. Here’s
how to create the texture:
1.
Choose File➪New to create a new document.
The New dialog box appears.
2.
Select the settings for the new document.
Set the Width and Height to something rather
large (say 3 x 3 inches). Set the resolution
to 300 ppi, the Color mode to RGB, and the
Background Contents to white.
3.
Click OK to close the New dialog box.
The new document appears in the program
window.
4.
Click the Foreground color square in the
Toolbox to open the Color Picker.
5.
Select a dark red color in the Color Picker.
6.
Select the Paint Bucket tool in the Toolbox.
7.
Click in the image window to fill the entire
area with the dark red.
8.
Choose Filter➪Texture➪Texturizer.

use the Texture drop-down list to select Brick.
10.
Set the Scaling to 200% and the Relief to 15.

Working with the Pattern Maker Filter
187
Defining a pattern
After you have a texture, you can turn it into a pat-
tern. Keep in mind that you can use these directions
to turn anything in the image window into a pattern.
For instance, suppose that you have a duck image
open. You could select the duck and turn it into a
pattern.
1.
Use the Rectangular Marquee tool to select a
portion of the image window.
The area that you select can be any size. Pattern
size isn’t limited in Photoshop. However, for a
standard size pattern, stick to a small area such
as 200 x 200 pixels.
2.
Choose Edit➪Define Pattern.
3.
In the Pattern Name dialog box, enter a name
for the pattern in the Name text box, as shown
in Figure 28-3.
• Figure 28-3: Type a name for the pattern in the Pattern
Name dialog box.
4.
Click OK.
Your new pattern appears at the end of the list
in the Pattern picker. (You can check this out by
selecting the Pattern Stamp tool in the Toolbox
and opening the Pattern picker on the Options
bar.) Figure 28-4 shows the brick texture made
in the previous section applied as a pattern to
some type.
• Figure 28-4: The brick pattern applied to type by using
layer styles.
Working with the Pattern
Maker Filter
The Pattern Maker filter uses the image in the image
window as the basis for a pattern. As you use the
Pattern Maker, you can decide whether you want to
use all or only a portion of the image. Also, as you use
the filter, you can generate previews of patterns and
quickly save any that you like in the Pattern picker.
1.
Open the image that you want to use as the
basis for a pattern.
For this example, I’m using the photograph of
fabric shown in Figure 28-5.
• Figure 28-5: I’m using this fabric to create some patterns.

7.
If you want to see where the tiles’ edges are in
the pattern, enable the Tile Boundaries check
box in the Preview area.
This option shows the tile boundaries only while
you’re working in the Pattern Maker dialog box.
The boundaries don’t show when you save the
pattern.
8.
Click Generate.
Pattern Maker goes to work creating the first tile
preview, as shown in Figure 28-7. If you don’t like
the pattern, click Generate again to see another
rendering.
• Figure 28-7: The rendered pattern appears in the
Preview pane.
9.
To save a pattern rendering that you like, click
the tiny Save Preset Pattern at the lower left of
the Tile History area. (The button looks like a
floppy disk.)
10.
When you finish generating and saving pat-
terns, either click OK to fill the image window
with the pattern currently in the Preview pane,
or click Cancel to close the Pattern Maker dia-
log box without applying the pattern to the
image window.
2.
Choose Filter➪Pattern Maker.
The Pattern Maker dialog box opens, as shown
in Figure 28-6. Notice that the controls are on
the right side, divided into three areas: Tile
Generation, Preview, and Tile History.
• Figure 28-6: In the Pattern Maker dialog box, the
controls are on the right side.
3.
Select the Rectangular Marquee tool at the
upper-left corner of the dialog box.
4.
In the Preview pane, drag to select the area of
the image that you want to turn into a pattern.
5.
In the Tile Generation area, enter a Width and
Height for the tiles in pixels.
If you want to use the size of the image as the tile
size, click Use Image Size.
6.
Choose an Offset setting from the drop-down
list and use the Amount slider to set how much
the pattern tiles are offset.
None leaves the pattern tiles lined up in a grid.
Horizontal shifts every other row horizontally as
specified by the Amount setting. For instance, a
Horizontal shift with a 50% Amount setting moves
every other row to the right the width of half a
tile. Vertical shifts every other column vertically
down the specified Amount setting.

Saving Pattern Libraries
189
Saving Pattern Libraries
When you create patterns that you like, you can save
them in a library. That way, if you reload the Pattern
picker with other pattern libraries, you don’t lose the
patterns that you’ve made. Here’s how:
1.
Choose Edit➪Preset Manager.
The Preset Manager dialog box opens.
2.
Press Ctrl+5 or use the Preset Type drop-down
list to select Patterns.
3.
In the pattern sample area, Ctrl/Ô+click to
select the patterns that you want to save.
4.
Click Save Set.
5.
In the Save dialog box, enter a name for the
pattern set in the File Name text box (Windows)
or Save As text box (Mac).
6.
Click OK to close the Save dialog box and
return to the Preset Manager.
7.
Click Done to close the Preset Manager.
If you save a set of patterns, you can always
e-mail the set to friends or colleagues so that
they can also use your custom patterns.
Loading Pattern Libraries
Several pattern libraries ship with Photoshop that
aren’t automatically loaded into the Pattern picker.
These include Nature, Rock, and Texture pattern
sets, which can be quite useful.
You can load patterns into the Pattern picker by
using either the Pattern picker’s menu or the Preset
Manager.
Here’s how to load patterns with the Preset Manager:
1.
Choose Edit➪Preset Manager.
The Preset Manager dialog box opens.
2.
Press Ctrl+5 or use the Preset Type drop-down
list to select Patterns.
3.
Open the Preset Manager menu and choose a
pattern library from the bottom of the menu,
as shown in Figure 28-8.
If you don’t see the pattern library that you want
to load listed on the menu, close the menu. Then
click Load, select the pattern library in the Load
dialog box, and click Load.
• Figure 28-8: Choose a pattern library from the bottom of
the Preset Manager menu.

Filling and Painting
with Patterns
P
hotoshop is a great tool for generating and applying patterns. You
can apply patterns to layers or selections with the Healing Brush,
Pattern Stamp, and Paint Bucket tools, and the Fill and Layer Styles
commands.
This technique shows you how to apply patterns to your projects in vari-
ous ways. You find out how to use the Fill command to apply a pattern to
a layer or selection. Next, you take a look at applying patterns to type as
a special effect by using Layer Styles. Finally, you use the Pattern Stamp
tool to paint with a pattern. If you don’t have the pattern that you need
for a project, take a look at Technique 28 for directions on creating pat-
terns and downloading them from the Web.
If you want to create pattern tiles for use as a background for a Web
page, turn to Technique 61 for directions.
Filling with Patterns
You have three ways to fill areas or selections with patterns in Photoshop:

Using the Paint Bucket tool is really straightforward. Select an area or
layer that you want to fill, select a pattern by using the Pattern picker
on the Options bar, and also set a blending mode and opacity, if you
want. Then, click within the selection. Done deal.

The Fill command also lets you fill a layer or selection with a pattern.
While selecting a pattern by using the Fill dialog box, you can also
select an opacity and blending mode. I don’t recommend setting a
blending mode or opacity by using the Fill command because after
you apply the command, that’s it. You can’t change it. Instead, use
the Layers palette to set blending modes and opacity; you can change
either setting later.

Technique 29: Filling and Painting with Patterns


Creating a fill layer is an infinitely flexible way
to apply a pattern. A fill layer is used to apply a
pattern to a layer or selection by using another
layer instead of applying the pattern to the actual
image, altering the image pixels forever. Because
the fill layer is a separate layer, you can set blend-
ing mode and opacity at any time. Also, you can
change the selected pattern and if you decide
that you don’t like the effect, delete the fill
layer altogether. I discuss fill layers in detail
in Technique 21; if you want to apply a pattern
by using a fill layer, turn to the directions there.
Here’s how to fill a layer or selection with the Fill
command:
1.
Use the Layers palette to select the layer to
which you want to apply the pattern.
If you want to apply the pattern to an area on the
selected layer, use the selection tools to create
the selection.
2.
Choose Edit➪Fill or press Shift+F5.
3.
Select a pattern with the Pattern picker in the
Fill dialog box, as shown in Figure 29-1.
• Figure 29-1: Select a pattern in the Fill dialog box.
4.
In the Blending area, use the Mode drop-
down list to select a blending mode and use
the Opacity slider to set the pattern’s trans-
parency, if you want.
5.
Select the Preserve Transparency check box if
portions of the selected area or layer are trans-
parent and you don’t want the pattern to fill
those areas.
6.
Click OK.
The pattern fills the selected area or layer.
Applying Patterns to Type
You can apply patterns to type in several ways. One
way, which is rather roundabout and not very flexi-
ble, is to rasterize the type layer, and then use the
Paint Bucket tool to fill each character with a pat-
tern. Although this method does work, it has a few
serious minuses: After rasterizing a type layer, you
can no longer edit the type with the Type tools. Also,
if you want to add drop shadows, bevels, or any
other special effects, you have to jump through a
few hoops.
The easiest and most versatile way to apply a pat-
tern to type is to use layer styles. Using layer styles,
you can fill the type with a pattern and add any
other effects that you need at the same time. (To
find out more about working with layer styles, turn
to Technique 20.)
Here’s how to apply a pattern to type by using layer
styles:
1.
Create the type that you need by using the
Type tool.
2.
With the type layer selected in the Layers
palette, click the Add Layer Styles button at
the bottom of the palette and choose Pattern
Overlay from the menu, as shown in Fig-
ure 29-2.

Applying Patterns to Type
193
• Figure 29-3: The Layer Styles dialog box opens with
Pattern Overlay selected.
4.
Use the Scale slider to size the pattern.
5.
Set the pattern’s transparency by using the
Opacity slider.
6.
To blend the pattern’s pixels with the type’s
pixel color, use the Blend Mode drop-down list
and choose a blending mode.
(To find out more about blending modes and
how they affect pixels, turn to Technique 17.)
7.
Use the Layer Styles dialog box to add any
other special effects that you want, such as
a bevel or drop shadow.
8.
Click OK.
The pattern (and any other special effects that
you chose) is applied to the type, as shown in
Figure 29-4.
Even after you apply layer styles to a type
layer, you can still edit the text with the Text
tools.
• Figure 29-2: Choose Pattern Overlay from the Add Layer
Styles menu.
The Layer Styles dialog box opens with the
Pattern Overlay style selected, as shown in
Figure 29-3.
3.
In the Pattern area, use the Pattern picker to
select a pattern.
Several pattern libraries that ship with
Photoshop aren’t loaded into the Pattern
picker. You can load them into the picker by

Painting with Patterns
Did you ever think that you could paint with pat-
terns? Well, you can! Here’s a very interesting tech-
nique to turn an image, scan, or photograph into a
pattern, and then use the pattern to paint.
1.
Open the image that you want to use for the
painting.
For this example, I’m using a heart paperweight
and some fabric that I scanned, as shown in
Figure 29-5.
2.
Choose Select➪Select All or press Ctrl/Ô+A.
A selection marquee appears around the entire
image.
3.
Choose Edit➪Define Pattern.
The Define Pattern dialog box opens.
4.
Enter a name for the pattern, and then click OK.
5.
Click the Create New Layer button at the bot-
tom of the Layer palette.
A new empty layer appears above the image. You
can rename the layer to something meaningful, if
you want. For this example, I renamed the layer
Noise Speckle.
• Figure 29-5: For this painting example, I’m using a scan
of some fabric and a heart paperweight.
6.
Select white as the Foreground color.
A fast way to do this is to press D, and then
press X.
7.
Select the Bucket tool from the Toolbox and
click in the image window.
The layer is filled with solid white, obscuring the
image below.
8.
With the white layer still selected in the Layers
palette, choose Filter➪Noise➪Add Noise.
The Add Noise dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 29-6.
9.
Select the noise settings.
Set the Amount to 20%; under Distribution,
select Gaussian; and select the Monochromatic
check box.

• Figure 29-6: Use the Add Noise dialog box to create a
speckled appearance.
10.
Click OK to close the Add Noise dialog box and
apply the filter to the white layer.
The layer is now speckled.
11.
With the white speckled layer selected in the
Layers palette, use the Blending Mode drop-
down list in the Layers palette to select Soft
Light.
Soft Light mode blends the white speckled layer
with the image layer below, giving a grainy appear-
ance. When you paint, this white speckled layer
helps show your strokes and add texture.
12.
Click the Create New Layer button at the bot-
tom of the Layers palette.
A new empty layer appears above the speckled
layer. This is the layer you’re going to paint on.
You can rename it, if you want. For this example,
I’ve renamed the layer Pattern Painting, as shown
in Figure 29-7. You now have three layers and your
canvas is prepared. Get ready to paint!
• Figure 29-7: You should now have three layers: the
image layer, noise layer, and painting layer.
13.
Select the Pattern Stamp tool from the Toolbox.
14.
On the Options bar, choose Mode: Normal,
Opacity: 100%, and Flow: 100%.
15.
Select the pattern of your image that you cre-
ated in Step 4 by using the Pattern picker.
16.
Select the Aligned check box.
17.
If you want to give your painting an impression-
ist feel, select the Impressionist check box.
As I painted this example, I selected Impressionist
for the large washed areas, and deselected
Impressionist when I needed to paint in some
detail.
18.
Select a brush tip by using the Brush Preset
picker on the Options bar or the Brushes
palette.
For my example, I loaded the Wet Media brush
library into the Brush Preset picker, and used
Oil Medium Brush Wet Edges and Oil Heavy
Flow Small Tip. (To find out more about brushes
and how to load brush libraries, take a look at
Technique 23.)

Enhancing Tone
and Color
N
ot every photograph is perfect. Some are underexposed, others
are overexposed, while some are a tad too red or blue. Whatever
you see as the problem with a photograph can be quickly and
expertly fixed in Photoshop. Depending upon how much of a “hands on”
person you are, you can adjust the tonal corrections yourself or let
Photoshop do the work.
This technique covers several ways that you can enhance the tone and
color by adjusting the light and dark values in your photographs. Using
various commands on the Image➪Adjustments menu, you can automati-
cally correct color or tone, or make more precise corrections using Levels
or Curves. These corrections can be applied to an entire image, an indi-
vidual layer, or a selected area of a layer; you can even apply corrections
as an adjustment layer for more flexibility. (Turn to Technique 22 to find
out more details about adjustment layers and how they work.) 
So pull out your favorite digital photographs and give them a brighter,
clearer appearance using some of the commands described here!
Going to the Automat
Three commands are on the Image➪Adjustments menu that do all the
work for you: Auto Levels, Auto Contrast, and Auto Color. While they may
not give the more perfect results that you could get if you hand adjusted
levels or curves, they are quick and work pretty well most of the time.
The Auto Levels command enhances contrast in an image by clipping
(throwing away) a portion of the darkest shadows and brightest high-
lights and redistributing the lights and darks throughout the image on a
channel-by-channel basis. (Take a look at Technique 52 if you want to
find out more about channels.) To apply the Auto Levels command to an
image, choose Image➪Adjustments➪Auto Levels.
Auto Contrast, like Auto Levels, enhances contrast in an image by clip-
ping a portion of the shadows and highlights in an image and redistribut-
ing the lights and darks. Where it differs from the Auto Levels command

and highlights. You can apply levels to an entire
image, an entire layer, or a selected area on a layer.
is that Auto Contrast does not work on a channel-by-
channel basis but instead uses the composite (com-
bined) channel made up of all the channels in the
image. To apply the Auto Contrast command to an
image, choose Image➪Adjustments➪Auto Contrast.
The Auto Color command adjusts contrast and color
by searching the image and assigning 50% gray as
the neutral midtone color, and then redistributing
the highlights and shadows out from that midpoint.
To apply the Auto Color command to an image,
choose Image➪Adjustments➪Auto Color.
If the tone or color of the image still isn’t quite
right after using one of the Auto commands,
complete the correction using the Levels dia-
log box, as described in “Setting Levels to
Adjust Tone and Color.”
You can also apply the three Auto commands as
adjustment layers, though you do need to go
through a few hoops to get there. An adjustment
layer uses the same commands found on the Image➪
Adjustments menu, but they work as layer-based
corrections, giving you an amazing amount of flexi-
bility. Layer-based corrections are not permanent
and you can modify them at any time. Turn to
Technique 22 to find out more about adjustment
layers. 
To apply the Auto Levels, Auto Contrast, or Auto
Color command as an adjustment layer:
1.
In the Layers palette, select the layer you want
the adjustment layer to appear above.

button at the bottom of the Layers palette and
choose Levels from the menu.

You can also apply a level as an adjustment layer.

shown in Figure 30-2. (To apply levels as an adjust-
ment layer, click the Create New Fill or Adjustment
Layer button at the bottom of the Layers palette and
choose Levels from the menu. The dialog box shown
in Figure 30-2 appears on-screen.) 
• Figure 30-2: Use the sliders in the Levels dialog box to
adjust highlights, midtones, and shadows.
Notice how the Levels dialog box is set up. At the top
is a Channel drop-down list that lets you select an
individual channel or the composite channel for cor-
rection. Below that is the histogram, which shows a
graphical representation of how the lights and darks
in the image are distributed. When you adjust levels,
you use the Histogram palette as a guide. Take a look
at the sidebar “How do you read a histogram?” for
details on how the histogram works.
Directly below the histogram are the really impor-
tant sliders in this dialog box: Input Shadow,
Midtone, and Highlight. Here’s how they work:

Move the Shadow slider to the right to increase
the dark tones in the image, making all the pixels
darker. As the Shadow slider moves right, so
does the Midtone slider.
Midtones
Highlights
Shadows

Slide the Midtone slider to the left to make the
midtones lighter. Move the slider to the right to
make the midtones darker.

Move the Highlight slider to the left to increase
the highlights, making all the pixels lighter. As
the Highlight slider moves left, so does the
Midtone slider.
Below the input sliders are the output Shadows and
Highlights sliders at the bottom of the Levels dialog
box. Use these sliders (very judiciously) when you
finish color correcting the image and just want to
heighten the overall intensity of the shadows and
highlights.
You can always reset the settings in the Levels
dialog box and start over by pressing Alt/
Option and then clicking Reset.
Take a look at Color Plate 30-1 to see the amazing
changes levels can make.
Curves Are Levels on Steroids
After you adjust the overall tonal range of a photo-
graph by using the Auto commands and the Levels
dialog box, you can use curves to adjust particular
portions of the tonal range without affecting other
parts of the range.
As the section title states, curves are levels on
steroids. Instead of adjusting just three tonal areas —
shadows, midtones, and highlights — as you do with
levels, you can adjust up to 14 areas along the entire
tonal range.
You can apply curves to an entire image, layer, selec-
tion, or as an adjustment layer. Open an image and
try using curves to adjust the tones in your image.
While the Curves dialog box looks a bit scary at first,
as you become familiar with it, you may find yourself
using it frequently for precise adjustments.

Technique 30: Enhancing Tone and Color
202
How do you read a histogram?
As you probably know, the tonal ranges in levels are
divided into three parts: shadows, highlights, and midtones.
The histogram shows a graphical representation of where
these tonal ranges are concentrated in an image. 
Take a look at the three images shown in the following
figure. Superimposed on each image is the image’s
histogram. Notice how the tonal range for the top photo,
which is underexposed, is concentrated on the left side of
the histogram in the shadows area. The tonal range of the
middle photo, which is overexposed, is concentrated at the
right side of the histogram in the highlights area. And, the
bottom photo, which is properly exposed, shows a pretty
even distribution along the length of the histogram.
Open the Histogram palette by choosing Window➪
Histogram. As you adjust the levels in an image, look at the
Histogram palette to see how the lights and darks are bal-
anced. As you move the Shadow, Midtone, and Highlight
sliders, notice how the lights and darks redistribute in the
palette, helping you to create a more tonally balanced image.
To adjust the tones in your images with curves:
1.
Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Curves or Press
Ctrl/Ô+M to directly correct a layer or selection.
Or if you want to apply curves as an adjustment
layer, click the Create New Fill or Adjustment
Layer button at the bottom of the Layers dialog
box and choose Curves from the menu.
The Curves dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 30-3.
2.
Select a channel using the Channel drop-down
list, if you want.
The default selection is the composite channel
that represents a blending of all the channels in
the image.
3.
Position the mouse over the graph area and
click the plotted line to create a point.
You can create up to 14 points on the plotted
line. By the way, the plotted line is also called the
curve, hence the name for this type of adjustment.
You can change the graph from a 4 x 4 grid
to a 10 x 10 grid by Alt/Option+clicking the
graph.
4.
Drag the point to adjust the tone and color.
You can delete a point by Ctrl/Ô+clicking it.
5.
Continue adding points and adjusting the curve
until you get the results you need.
Keep an eye on the Histogram palette to see how
your corrections are going. To find out how to
read the Histogram palette, take a look at the
sidebar, “How do you read a histogram?” earlier
in this technique.

Click OK to close the Curves dialog box and
apply the adjustments to your image.

o one has perfect skin. No one has a perfect body. Not even the
perfect looking models in magazine ads. Take a really close look at
almost any ad showing a serious amount of skin — whether a face,
leg, or other body part — and you probably can detect some telltale sign
of image doctoring. Perhaps an edge looks slightly mushy or the skin
tone or texture doesn’t quite match. In the ads, image manipulation can
be pretty obvious where the photographs have been quickly (and
cheaply) doctored.
Because our skin and bodies are less than perfect (whatever perfect is!),
having Photoshop to help fix the wrinkles and tighten tummies is a good
thing. Photoshop comes with some really super tools that let you profes-
sionally retouch any photograph you have. Some of this plastic surgery
can be quite time consuming, but if you take the time, there won’t be any
telltale signs in your photos to give your retouching away.
This technique zeroes in on fixing physical irregularities. First, you find
out how to brush away the years as you remove wrinkles, blemishes, and
brown spots. Then, you go to medical school and learn how to smooth
noses. So, pull out your best (or worst!) photographs and start retouching!
Ridding Your Photos of Wrinkles
and Blemishes
The tools you use most when performing plastic surgery include the
Clone Stamp and Healing Brush tools. Both of these tools copy areas
using cloning, but the Healing Brush tool is the Clone Stamp tool’s
smarter cousin. While the Clone Stamp tool copies the hue and bright-
ness of an area, the Healing Brush tool also copies the texture of an area,
which is particularly important when dealing with skin. Copying skin tex-
ture helps the cloned areas blend in more seamlessly.

Ridding Your Photos of Wrinkles and Blemishes
205
Another handy Photoshop feature is the Dust &
Scratches filter. Use this filter when you want to
even out skin texture. If the subjects in your photo-
graph have some irregularities or pitting on their
cheeks or chin, this filter can quickly smooth things
out.
My likely candidate for wrinkle and blemish removal
is the woman shown in Figure 31-1. As you can see,
she has a few wrinkles around the eyes, some slight
blemishes on her nose, and some skin texture prob-
lems that look like old pitting scars from acne. With
Photoshop, the Clone Stamp tool, Healing Brush, and
the Dust & Scratches filter, I can erase a few years in
a few minutes.
• Figure 31-1: Even though she doesn’t know it, this
woman is going to have her wrinkles and
blemishes removed and her skin texture
smoothed out.
The real trick when retouching a photograph is to
use a different layer for each type of retouching
activity, such as removing blemishes, removing wrin-
kles, and defining eyes. That way, you never touch
the original photograph and if you go a little too far
with the retouching or don’t like something you do,
you can always start over.
Instead of creating one long list of steps covering
blemish and wrinkle removal, and skin smoothing,
I’ve divided the directions into the three sets so that
you can find what you need more easily.
To remove blemishes, follow these steps:
1.
Open the photograph you want to retouch.
If you need to scan the photograph and import it
into Photoshop, take a look at Technique 10. The
photograph I’m using in this example is shown in
Figure 31-1.
2.
Select the layer containing the photograph if it
isn’t already active.
3.
Click the Create New Layer button at the bot-
tom of the Layers palette.
A new, empty layer appears above the photo-
graph. This is the layer you are going to use to
remove blemishes, so rename the layer some-
thing appropriate such as Blemish Removal.
4.
Select the Clone Stamp tool from the Toolbox.
5.
Use the Options bar to select the Clone Stamp
tool settings.
Select Normal blending mode using the Mode
drop-down list, set Opacity to 75%, uncheck
Aligned, and check Use All Layers.
6.
Select a small, soft brush using the Brush
Preset picker.
For this example, I used a 5 pixel diameter brush
with a 0% Hardness setting.

2.
Select the layer containing the photograph if it
isn’t already active.
3.
Click the Create New Layer button at the bot-
tom of the Layers palette.
A new, empty layer appears above the photo-
graph. This is the layer that you use to remove
blemishes, so rename the layer something appro-
priate such as Wrinkle Removal.
4.
Select the Healing Brush tool from the Toolbox.
5.
Use the Options bar to select the Healing Brush
settings.
Select the Replace blending mode using the
Mode drop-down list, set Source to Sampled,
uncheck Aligned, and check Use All Layers.
If you don’t want some layers in the image
included in the wrinkle removal, click the eye
icon to the left of each layer in the Layers palette
to hide them.
6.
Select a small, soft brush using the Brush
Preset picker.
For this example, I used a 9 pixel diameter brush
with a 10% Hardness setting.
7.
Hold down the Alt/Option key and select a
clone source near the wrinkles.
8.
Use small strokes to remove the wrinkles.
Be careful not to overdo it. You want to remove
some wrinkles but not all the character in the
person’s face. Also, because you want to match
skin tone and texture as much as possible,
resample the clone source frequently (see 
Step 7).
Figure 31-3 shows the example photograph
minus a few of the wrinkles originally shown in
Figure 31-2.
7.
Hold down the Alt/Option key and select a
clone source near the blemish.
8.
Stroke over the blemish to remove it.
As shown in Figure 31-2, the Clone Stamp tool
removed the dark spots and blemishes from her
cheek, chin, and nose.
• Figure 31-2: The Clone Stamp tool works really well for
removing spots and blemishes.
Follow these steps to remove wrinkles:
1.
Open the photograph you want to retouch.
If you need to scan the photograph and import it
into Photoshop, take a look at Technique 10. The
photograph I’m using in this example is shown in
Figure 31-2.

into Photoshop, take a look at Technique 10. The
photograph I’m using in this example is shown in
Figure 31-3.
2.
Select the layer containing the photograph if it
isn’t already active.
3.
Choose Filter➪Noise➪Dust & Scratches.
This filter is very powerful, so small changes in
the Radius setting can make for big results. For
my example, I slightly smoothed the woman’s
skin by using a Radius setting of 2 and a Threshold
setting of 1. That’s all it took to smooth the skin
areas along her cheeks and chin, as shown in
Figure 31-4.
• Figure 31-4: The Dust & Scratches filter is great for
smoothing skin texture.
Getting a Nose Job
Not everyone can be a plastic surgeon, but with
Photoshop you don’t need to go to medical school in
order to perform a few nips and tucks. 
The following steps describe how to make a nose
smaller, but you could use these steps for many body
parts. All you have to do is select the area you want
to change and then use one of the transformation
commands, such as Distort, Skew, or Perspective, to
reshape the selected area. After that, any mismatched
shadows or areas can be deftly corrected using the
Healing Brush.

nose area, as shown in Figure 31-5. 
• Figure 31-5: Select a wide area around the nose.

With the copied nose layer selected, choose
Edit➪Transform➪Distort.
A bounding box with handles appears around the
copied nose layer, as shown in Figure 31-7.

Drag the upper corner handles toward each
other to make the top of the nose slimmer.
Don’t drag the handles too far or the nose ends
up looking out of place.

Getting Rid of 
Red Eye
H
ow many times have you taken a wonderful photograph, only to
see a red glow coming from the eyes of your subject? No, the per-
son or animal in the photograph doesn’t have any demonic traits;
the red eyes are caused by light from a flash bouncing off the back of the
subject’s eye. (Actually, animals tend to get “yellow-eye” or “green-eye”
because of the shape of their eyes, but all those flashing eyes are still
referred to as “red eye.”)
Understanding the Color Replacement Tool
Correcting red eye in Photoshop is really easy when you use the Color
Replacement tool. This technique shows you how to correct red eye in
your photographs. You find out what settings to use and what kind of
brush works best. If you want to correct a real-world photograph, follow
the directions in Technique 10 on how to import images into Photoshop
using a scanner.
Here’s how this tool works. First, you use the Eyedropper tool to sample
the color you want to replace in the Toolbox’s Background color square.
Then, you choose the color you’re using as the replacement in the
Foreground color square. After that, you select various settings on the
Options bar, select a brush, and stroke on the new color while the old
sampled color is automatically replaced.
If you removed red eye using various methods in previous versions
of Photoshop, you know how time consuming this process can be.
The new Color Replacement tool in Photoshop CS removes red eye so
quickly you’ll be amazed!
Brushing Away the Red
To demonstrate how the Color Replacement tool eliminates red eye, I’m
using a snapshot of my little son, Nicholas, shown in Figure 32-1. Even in
a grayscale image, the red eye is pretty obvious.

 Use the Limits drop-down list to select
Contiguous. This setting paints the replace-
ment color only to neighboring pixels.
 Set the Tolerance to 10%. This setting limits
the range of colors that are replaced.
 Check Antialiased. This option blends the
edges of the painted pupil with the iris.
12.
Open the Brush Preset picker and select a
small, slightly soft brush.
For this example, I’m using a brush set at a 5
pixel diameter and 90% Hardness.
13.
Stroke on the pupil to replace the red eye.
Don’t worry if you slip a little and the mouse cur-
sor slides out to the iris area. Because the
Tolerance setting is so low, the iris color isn’t
replaced.

eyes look just the way they should.

Adding Professional
Photo Filter Effects
P
rofessional photographers use filters — thin lenses that fit over a
camera or enlarger lens — to correct lighting conditions, enhance
specific colors, and create special effects such as fog, vignettes, and
cross stars. (Have you ever wondered how cameramen created those
wonderful soft vignette shots of actresses in old black and white movies
from the 1940s? The photographer actually smeared Vaseline around the
outside edge of the lens to diffuse the light on the edges of the image but
keep the center sharp, creating a portrait with a “halo” effect. Stretching
a black stocking over the camera lens sometimes created soft focus
effects.)
You can apply photographic-style filters in Photoshop using the Photo
Filter command. The Photoshop photo filters recolor photographs by
enhancing warm or cool colors, or by completely retinting the photo-
graph to a specific hue such as yellow, magenta, brown, or blue.
In this technique, you find out how to apply Photoshop’s photo filters to
recolor your photographs. Also, you discover how to make your photo-
graphs look like old-time sepia-toned photos. So, find an interesting 
photograph and experiment with photo filters!
Take a look at Color Plate 33-1 to see the results of recoloring a photo-
graph using the Photo Filter command.
Recoloring with Photo Filters
You can apply photo filters directly to a layer or as an adjustment layer. If
you apply a photo filter directly to a layer, the layer’s pixels are perma-
nently altered. But, if you apply the photo filter as an adjustment layer,
you can always change the photo filter being used, modify its effect by
lowering opacity or changing blending modes, or completely remove the
photo filter without changing any image pixels. (Turn to Technique 22 to
find out more about adjustment layers.)

Creating Old-Time Sepia Photos
You can create a sepia-toned photograph in
Photoshop in several ways:

Apply a sepia-toned photo filter.

Use the Hue/Saturation command to colorize the
photo.

Use an action that ships with Photoshop that
automatically creates a sepia-toned look for you.
Which works best? Well, which method you use
depends upon the qualities of the photograph you’re
using and the look you’re after. Open a photograph
and try these different methods.
If you want to apply a sepia photo filter, follow the
directions for applying a photo filter in “Recoloring
with Photo Filters.” In Step 4, choose Sepia from the
Filter drop-down list. When you apply a sepia-toned
photo filter, the results are a brighter brownish-
yellow cast, but retain the original colors in the
photograph.
The Hue/Saturation command produces a monotone
brownish-red sepia look. Here’s how:
1.
In the Layers palette, select the layer you want

Creating Grayscale
Images: Your
Choices and
the Results
F
ine black and white photographs can be truly wonderful. If you’ve
ever seen some of the great Ansel Adams photographs of Yosemite
Valley, you know what I mean. While few of us walk around with black
and white film in our cameras these days (actually, I can’t remember when
I last used film), you can convert color images into good-looking black and
white images in Photoshop.
Black and white images in Photoshop are called grayscale. Because these
images are made up of 256 levels of gray, from black (0) to white (255),
calling them grayscale makes a certain amount of sense.
You need to know, however, that the easiest road to grayscale is not nec-
essarily the best way to create a fine-looking grayscale image. You can
use several methods to convert a color image to grayscale in Photoshop: 

Converting a color image by switching from a color mode, such as
RGB or CMYK, to Grayscale color mode. This method is indeed the
easiest of the three. However, the results sometimes aren’t optimal.
Many times the finer details of the image’s darker areas lose definition
and can become muddy.

Selecting one of the grayscale channels that make up a color image.
This method can work quite well because you retain fine details.

Using the Color blending mode and a solid black fill layer. This
method usually creates a great grayscale image.
Which method you decide to use depends upon your image and the
amount of time you have to test results. Comparing the figures in this
technique to see the difference between grayscale conversions may help
you decide which method to use.

218
Selecting a Channel
Another way to convert an image to grayscale is to
select one of the channels that make up the image.
Each color image has three or four color channels
(depending upon if the image is set in RGB or CMYK
mode). Each one of these channels contains specific
color information. For instance, an image set in RGB
mode has red, green, and blue channels. Channels
are themselves grayscale images. (If you’re inter-
ested in finding out more about channels, take a look
at Technique 52.)
Take a look at the Channels palette shown in 
Figure 34-2. The Arches National Park photo that
I’m using for these examples is set in RGB color
mode, so you see three individual color channels.
(At the top of the Channels palette is the composite
channel that shows the three channels combined.)
• Figure 34-2: You can select a channel for use as a
grayscale image.
To select an individual channel for use as a grayscale
image, click each channel in the Channels palette to
view it in the image window. When you decide on the
channel you want to use, drag the other channels to
the trashcan icon at the bottom of the Channels
palette.
Figure 34-3 shows the three channels that make up
the Arches National Park photograph. I like the
If you’re interested in adding a bit of color to your
grayscale images, take a look at Technique 35. There
I give you directions on how to colorize grayscale
images to accent and emphasize important features
in your photographs.
Converting Color Modes
By far the easiest way to convert an image to gray-
scale is to change color modes. To do so, choose
Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. With the Grayscale mode
conversion, Photoshop throws away the color infor-
mation in the image and converts the brightness of
the pixels in the image to 256 levels of gray.
The resulting grayscale image is pretty good, but the
finer areas can become a bit fuzzy and the overall
cast can be a bit dark. Figure 34-1 shows a lovely
photograph of Arches National Park converted from
RGB mode to grayscale.
• Figure 34-1: Converting a color image to grayscale using
color modes works pretty well, but the
overall cast can be a bit dark.
When you convert an image with more than
one layer to grayscale color mode, Photoshop
asks whether you want to merge the layers. If
you want to keep the layers separate, select
Don’t Merge.

green channel best, so I’ll discard the other chan-
nels. Notice how fine the channel detail is in the
green channel in Figure 34-3 when compared to the
grayscale conversion in Figure 34-1. Also, the overall
cast of the green grayscale channel is brighter than
the grayscale conversion.
• Figure 34-3: The three channels that make up the Arches
National Park photograph.
Red channel

Applying the Color 
Blending Mode
You can also convert a color image to grayscale
using the Color blending mode. This method of con-
version tends to produce the finest results. Details
remain crisp and dark areas don’t lose definition like
they do when an image is converted using color
modes.
The following directions show how to apply the
color blending mode using a fill layer. You can also
just fill a regular layer with black using the Paint
Bucket tool, and then change the blending.
Here’s how:
1.
Open the image you want to convert to
grayscale.
2.
Select the layer containing the image in the
Layers palette.
3.
Click the Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer
button at the bottom of the Layers palette and
choose Solid from the menu.
4.
Select black in the Color Picker.
5.
Click OK to close the Color Picker and create
the fill layer.
The fill layer appears in the Layers palette, as
shown in Figure 34-4. Your image in the image
window disappears behind the solid black fill
layer.
6.
Use the Blending Mode drop-down list at the
top of the Layers palette to choose Color.
The image colors blend with the black fill 
layer to create a grayscale image, as shown in
Figure 34-5.
You can now flatten the layers, if you want,
and convert the image to grayscale color
mode by choosing Image➪Mode➪Grayscale.
None of the fine quality of the image is lost
during the color conversion.

Coloring and Tinting
Black and White
Photographs
E
ver since photography was created, folks have been painting or tint-
ing black and white photographs to make them look like they were
in color or to emphasize particular elements. With Photoshop, you
can tint black and white photographs to add color or make color photo-
graphs look like tinted black and whites. Any way you want it, you can
do it.
This technique focuses on how to add color to black and white (or
grayscale as they are called in Photoshop) images. You find out how to
layer color on top of a grayscale photo, apply overall tints using photo
filters and the Hue/Saturation command, and paint in color using the
History palette. Then, you explore the world of duotones, tritones, and
quadtones, which mix two, three, or four colors to create the necessary
range of tones — shadows, midtones, and highlights — for your image
while creating a special look.
Because these pages are printed in black and white, I can’t show these
tinting and painting techniques here. However, look at Figure 35-1 here
and then at Color Plate 35-1. Figure 35-1 shows the original grayscale
image and Color Plate 35-1 shows several of the coloring techniques
that I describe here.

222
Tinting Photographs
Two ways you can apply an overall tint to black and
white photographs is to apply either the Photo Filter
or Hue/Saturation commands. You can apply both
of these commands directly to the layer containing
the grayscale image or as adjustment layers. I dis-
cuss each of these tinting methods in detail in
Technique 33.
Here’s a quick rundown for applying the Hue/
Saturation command as an adjustment layer:
1.
Open the grayscale photograph you want to use.
2.
Choose Image➪Mode➪RGB.
This command sets the photograph up for
accepting color.
3.
Select the layer containing the grayscale 
photograph.
4.
Click the Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer
button at the bottom of the Layers palette and
choose Hue/Saturation from the menu.
The Hue/Saturation dialog box, shown in 
Figure 35-2, opens.
• Figure 35-2: The Hue/Saturation dialog box is used to
colorize the black and white photograph.
• Figure 35-1: This photograph was originally in color.
Here it’s reproduced as a grayscale image.
Layering with Color
Superimposing layers of transparent color images
over a grayscale image can be quite effective and
easy to boot. Open the grayscale image you want to
use and be sure to convert it to RGB color mode by
choosing Image➪Mode➪RGB. That way, the image is
ready to accept color. Open other color images con-
taining the colored elements that you want to layer
over the grayscale image, and copy and paste them
onto new layers above the grayscale image. Lower
the Opacity setting of the colored layers and voila!
The grayscale image now contains interesting color-
ful elements.

5.
Put a check in the Colorize check box.
6.
Adjust the Hue and Saturation sliders to the
color you want to use.
Some settings you can use are (with the
Saturation set to 25): Hue at 25 for sepia, Hue 
at 130 for cyan, Hue at 225 for blue, and Hue at
300 for magenta. Of course, these settings are
approximate and may need to be slightly differ-
ent for your photograph.
7.
Click OK to close the Hue/Saturation dialog box
and apply the tinting to the photograph.
Another way to tint a photograph is to apply a
gradient map as an adjustment layer and then
try different blending mode and opacity set-
tings using the Layers palette. To find out how
to apply a gradient map, turn to Technique 27.
Painting in Color with History
You can paint color back into a grayscale photo-
graph using history only if you start with a color
photograph. The History Brush uses a previous his-
tory state as the source to paint. For this example, 
I show you how to create a snapshot of the original
color image to use as the color source. (If you want to
find out more about snapshots, turn to Technique 7.) 
Here’s how:
1.
Open the color photograph you want to use.
2.
Open the History palette by choosing Window➪
History. 
By default, the History palette is grouped with
the Actions palette at the right of the program
window.
3.
Click the Create New Snapshot button at the
bottom of the History palette.
A new snapshot labeled Snapshot 1 appears in
the History palette, as shown in Figure 35-3.
• Figure 35-3: Click the Create New Snapshot button.
4.
Double-click the snapshot’s name and rename
it Color.
Making a duplicate of the image before con-
verting it to grayscale is always a good idea.
That way, you have the color image to refer
to when painting the colors back into the
grayscale image. (How many times have I
thought to myself, “Which leaves do I want to
paint? I can’t remember!”) To create a dupli-
cate of the image, choose Edit➪Duplicate.
5.
Choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale.
This command converts the color photograph to
black and white.
6.
Choose Image➪Mode➪RGB Color.
This command sets the black and white photo-
graph to accepting color (but it doesn’t revert
the photograph back to color).

Technique 35: Coloring and Tinting Black and White Photographs
224
Creating Duotones
A duotone is a grayscale image or photograph
printed with two different colored inks. Actually, if
you think about it, a grayscale (or black and white)
image is a monotone because it’s printed with only
one color, usually black (though you can always
print with any other color). You can add a third ink
color to create a tritone, and then also add a fourth
ink color to create a quadtone.
Printing an image with two (or more) specific inks
gives the image more depth because the two ink col-
ors combine to heighten highlights, midtones, and
shadows. The image in Figure 35-5 shows stone
arches reproduced in grayscale. Now compare
Figure 35-5 to Color Plate 35-2 to see the same image
reproduced as a duotone, tritone, and quadtone.
• Figure 35-5: This grayscale image is ready for
transformation into a duotone.
7.
In the History palette, click in the left column
next to the Color snapshot you created in 
Step 3, as shown in Figure 35-4.
Don’t select the snapshot because that reverts
the photograph to the previous color state.
• Figure 35-4: Click the column to the left of the 
Color snapshot.
8.
Select the History Brush tool from the Toolbox.
9.
Use the Mode drop-down list on the Options
bar to select a blending mode.
If you’re trying this technique for the first time,
select Normal. To find out more about blending
modes, turn to Technique 17.
10.
Use the Opacity and Flow sliders to select those
settings.
For a first try, set both options to 100%.
11.
Use the Brush Preset picker to select a brush tip.
12.
Stroke the color back into the black and white
photograph in the areas you want to emphasize.
If you’re worried about painting beyond an area
when you don’t mean to, use the selection tools
to select the area you are going to paint in before
actually painting. That way, the selection limits
your painting to only the selected area.

The Duotone Options dialog box opens, showing
that the image is currently set as a monotone.

3.
Use the Type drop-down list to select Duotone,
Tritone, or Quadtone.
Depending upon which type you choose, 2, 3,
or 4 ink swatches become available in the
Duotone Options dialog box.
4.
Click the ink color swatch next to each avail-
able ink option.
The Color Picker opens.
5.
Use the Color Picker to select a color.
Or click Custom in the Color Picker to switch to
the Custom Colors dialog box and select a
matching system color swatch, such as Pantone
Yellow 012C. (To find out more about custom
color systems, turn to Technique 14.)
As you select ink colors, you can preview the
color combinations in the image window.
If you choose custom inks, such as Pantone,
Trumatch, or TOYO, what you see on-screen
may not exactly match the ink color. To be
sure you are selecting the ink colors you need,
select them from a color swatch book. You can
buy swatch books from the ink manufacturers
or better art supply stores. Or if you are work-
ing with a commercial printer, the printer may
have a swatch book you can borrow.
6.
Click OK to close the Color Picker and return
to the Duotone Options dialog box.
7.
Repeat Steps 4 through 6 for each ink color.
8.
Click the Curve box to the left of the ink color
swatch to set how the inks blend together.
The Duotone Curve dialog box opens as shown
in Figure 35-7.
• Figure 35-7: Drag the curve to adjust how much ink

Options dialog box.
Creating “full color” duotones
Powertone 2.0 by Creo is a Photoshop plug-in that creates
“full color” duotones. Using an RGB or CMYK image and
two ink colors that you select, Powertone creates the best
match it can based on the original colors in the image. The
duotones created by Powertone have more color depth
than duotones created with the Photoshop Duotone color
mode. If you’re going to use a duotone for any commercial
job, such as a brochure or advertisement, visit www.creo.

Stitching Photos to
Create Panoramas
H
ave you ever taken several photographs across a wide panorama
and wanted to seamlessly put them together? If you ever tried this
in previous versions of Photoshop, matching the photos and then
blending them together took time and a bit of skill. This process is called
photo stitching. It’s kind of like piecing a quilt together.
Well, no more tedious stitching! Photoshop CS has a completely amazing
plug-in that does most of the work for you. The first time I ever used the
Photomerge command, I was astounded, “Geez, this thing is smart!” It put
all my photos together into a single image without too much fuss or
bother — no need to blend between spliced photos. What a timesaver!
This technique shows you how to use this great plug-in. If you’ve been
to the Grand Canyon and want to put a whole canyon’s worth of photos
together, give this a try. Or, take your digital camera outside and snap a
few pictures across the horizon, import the photos into Photoshop, and
then use Photomerge to put them all together. 
Getting to Know Photomerge
Photomerge attempts to match similar areas from different photographs
and then puts them all together into one large panorama or photomural.
I use the word “attempts” because while Photomerge does give it a good
try, sometimes it can’t match areas. But, anything Photomerge cannot
match, it leaves for you to place in the correct area. This placement is
really easy. As soon as you drag and drop a photograph onto a matching
area, Photomerge snaps the two together. So no exact matching skill is
needed.
You can also use Photomerge to create photomontages. For instance,
you can create a great grouping of family photos using Photomerge.

Amazing Fast 
Filter Effects

Accenting with
Sharpening or
Blurring
F
olks are always surprised when I suggest blurring portions of an
image to bring out a specific detail. Sure, sharpening makes sense.
After all, it adds to the detail. But, blurring? Trust me; sometimes a
technique that you think of as a complete opposite can create your
desired effect.
In this technique, you use the powerful Unsharp Mask filter to precisely
sharpen images. You also experiment with the Unsharp Mask to increase
the detail in an image until the edges start to glow. This can be used to
create interesting effects. From there, you use the Blur filters to selec-
tively blur portions of an image in order to emphasize the sharp areas.
This technique has been used since the invention of photography and
film.
Sharpening Effects
Four sharpening filters dwell on the Filter➪Sharpen menu, but the first
three (Sharpen, Sharpen Edges, and Sharpen More) don’t give you any
control over the sharpening process. All they do is click and sharpen.
Sometimes you can use them sparingly as a quick fix, but I don’t really
recommend them. The sharpening filter to use is the fourth item down
on the menu, Unsharp Mask.
The Unsharp Mask works by accenting the differences at the edges of ele-
ments in an image. These edges are usually high-contrast areas — for
instance, the sudden shift from dark pixels to light pixels which the edge
of an object can create. To see the Unsharp Mask filter at work, take a
look at Color Plate 37-1.

Technique 37: Accenting with Sharpening or Blurring
234
• Figure 37-2: The Unsharp Mask dialog box is your key to
sharper images.
3.
Use the sliders to set the Amount, Radius, and
Threshold.
 The Amount sets how much the edges in
the image are enhanced and defined (that
is, sharpened). The higher the setting, the
more sharpening.
 The Radius sets how contrast is increased
from the edges. Higher settings make thicker
edges.
 The Threshold sets how precisely the edges
are recognized. Lower settings sharpen more
pixels. Higher settings sharpen fewer pixels.
Experiment especially with the Amount and
Radius settings. Find out where the settings go
off the charts and create an undesired effect for
you. Take a look at Figure 37-3, which shows the
image from Figure 37-1 sharpened with various
settings.
If it sharpens so well, why is it called the
“Unsharp” Mask?
The name seems like a contradiction, doesn’t it? The best
sharpener in Photoshop is termed unsharp. Hmph. The term
unsharp mask actually comes from photography, where a
negative and a faint positive created by using a special film
(called masking film) are sandwiched together to increase
contrast and sharpness. The faint positive created by using
masking film is called an unsharp mask. I guess some of the
programmers at Adobe are real photography buffs.
Here’s how to use the Unsharp Mask filter:
1.
Open the image that you want to sharpen.
For this example, I’m using the wagon wheel
pasta shown in Figure 37-1. As you can see, the
photograph is distinctly blurry.
• Figure 37-1: This blurry pasta is going to become clearer.
2.
Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask.
The Unsharp Mask dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 37-2.

• Figure 37-3: Different settings create more contrast at

Amount: 200%, Radius: 3
Amount: 500%, Radius: 5
4.
Click OK when you finish adjusting the sliders
to apply the sharpening to the image.
After applying the Unsharp Mask, you can always
apply other filters to accentuate the edges. Fig-
ure 37-4 shows two filters applied to the pasta
wheels after extreme sharpening with the Amount
set at 500% and the Radius set at 5. First, the
Plastic Wrap filter was applied (top). Then, the
Glowing Edges filter was applied (bottom).

• Figure 37-5: I’m blurring the bicycle area to make the
viewer immediately look at the girls face.
3.
Choose Select➪Inverse or press Ctrl+Shift+I/
Ô+Shift+I.
This inverts the selection to select the area of
the photograph that you want to blur. For my
example, this selects the bicycles shown behind
the girl.
4.
Choose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur.
5.
Use the Radius slider to set the amount of blur,
as shown in Figure 37-6.
Radius can be set from 0.1 to 250. A Radius set-
ting below 1 creates a very slight softening blur.
Radius values between 1 and 5 create moderate
blurs. Values above 5 blur the areas so much that
they become unrecognizable. Experiment with
the slider and see which results you like best.
For my example, I chose a Radius setting of 3.
6.
Click OK to close the Gaussian Blur dialog box
and apply the blur.
Take a look at Figure 37-7. Notice how the girl’s
face is really the focus of attention.
You can also apply the Unsharp Mask to indi-
vidual channels. Experiment with this and see
how sharpened channels can create colored
edge glows. (For that matter, you can apply
any filter to individual channels.) Take a look at
Technique 52 to find out more about working
with channels. Turn to Color Plate 37-1 to see
these channel effects.
Sometimes applying the Unsharp Mask
several times with lower settings works
better than applying the filter once with
higher settings.
Blurring for Emphasis
Blurring portions of a photograph makes the viewer’s
eye immediately travel to the sharp areas of the pic-
ture. This technique has been used for years in pho-
tography and motion pictures.
Photoshop has eight different blur filters (count ’em!).
The first three blur commands on the menu —
Average, Blur, and Blur More — give you no control.
They are one-shot filters that let you only click and
blur. I don’t use them very often. Instead, I usually
head for the Gaussian Blur command, which gives
control over the amount and quality of a blur.
Here’s how to create a slight blur around a face to
emphasize it:
1.
Open the image to which you want to add a
blur.
For this example, I’m using the photo of the girl
shown in Figure 37-5.
2.
Use any of the selection tools to select the face
or faces in the photograph whose details you
want to preserve.
For this example, I’m using the Lasso tool to
select the girl’s face.

Blurring for Emphasis
237
• Figure 37-6: Move the Radius slider to adjust the blur.
• Figure 37-7: Instead of just being another part of the
photograph, the girl’s face is really the 
focal point now.
Instead of blurring the entire background of
an image as I did with the preceding example,
you could select a channel and blur only that
channel. This method can create a blurring
effect that creates a slight glow around objects,
almost like a very subdued star filter. Fig-
ure 37-8 shows the photograph of the girl
with only the Red channel sharpened using a
Radius setting of 10. Compare it to the blur-
ring in Figure 37-7. The effect is rather subtle,
but can be quite nice.
• Figure 37-8: Blurring only one channel creates the effect
of a slight glow.

Painting
Watercolors
with Filters
F
ilters are one of Photoshop’s great features. They give you so much
with just a few clicks of the mouse. When I started using Photoshop
(I won’t tell you how long ago!), I was immediately enchanted with
filters, and those early impressions still remain.
Photoshop CS comes with more than 100 filters that you can combine to
create interesting and beautiful results. This technique takes a look at
creating watercolor paintings by using filters. No painting is involved
(unless you want to add a few highlights or details). Of course, you use
the Watercolor filter, but this technique doesn’t stop there. You use two
other filters, the Underpainting and Note Paper filters, to enhance the
results of the Watercolor filter, highlighting detail and adding luminosity.
So, open a photograph or an image that would make a good watercolor
and have a go. If you want to use a photograph that isn’t saved in digital
form, turn to Technique 10 to find out all about scanning images and
importing them into Photoshop. Color Plate 38-1 shows how the
Watercolor filter looks when applied to a photograph.
Creating an Enhanced Watercolor
This method of creating a watercolor painting uses three filters: the
Watercolor, Underpainting, and Note Paper filters. You apply each filter
to a separate layer. Then, you adjust the layers’ blending modes and
opacities to blend them together.
1.
Open the image that you want to change into a watercolor painting.
For this example, I’m using the photograph of a Maine coastal town
shown in Figure 38-1.
2.
Select the layer containing the image in the Layers palette.
3.
Press Ctrl+J/Ô+J or choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy two times.
This creates two copies of the selected layer. So, you should have
three identical layers, as shown in Figure 38-2.

Creating an Enhanced Watercolor
239
• Figure 38-1: This photograph could certainly make a nice
watercolor painting.
• Figure 38-2: You should have three identical layers in the
Layers palette.
4.
In the Layers palette, rename the layers.
I’ve renamed the layer at the top of the list Note
Paper, the second layer down Underpainting,
and the bottom layer Watercolor, as shown in
Figure 38-2. I’m using these names to identify the
different layers throughout the rest of the steps.
5.
Select the Watercolor layer in the Layers palette.
6.
Choose Filter➪Artistic➪Watercolor.
The Filter Gallery opens with the Watercolor fil-
ter selected, as shown in Figure 38-3. Notice that
the settings for the filter are located at the right
side of the dialog box.
• Figure 38-3: Use the settings at the right side of the
dialog box to adjust the Watercolor filter.
7.
Move the sliders to adjust the Watercolor
settings.
 Brush Detail sets the width of the brush being
used to create the watercolor. The lower the
setting, the smaller the brush and the greater
the detail. For my example, I set it to 12.
 Shadow Intensity deepens shadows in the
image. The higher the setting, the more shad-
ows. This option can darken the image consid-
erably, so keep the setting low. For the
example, I set it to 0.
 Texture enhances edges and adds more water
droplets. The higher the setting, the more tex-
ture. For this example, I set it to 1.
8.
Click OK to close the Filter Gallery and apply
the Watercolor filter to the Watercolor layer.
You don’t see the effect of the Watercolor filter
unless you hide the two layers above the
Watercolor layer. If you want to take a peek,
Alt+click/Option+click the eye icon to the left
of the Watercolor layer. (The other layers are
hidden.) Afterwards, Alt+click/Option+click the
eye icon to make the other layers visible again.
Figure 38-4 shows the Watercolor layer of the
Maine town with the Watercolor filter applied.
Notice that although the Watercolor filter did its
job, the photograph is rather dark and a lot of
the detail has been lost. This detail is returned in
the following steps.

Technique 38: Painting Watercolors with Filters
240
11.
Use the Brush Size and Texture Coverage slid-
ers to adjust these settings.
 Brush Size sets the width of the brush. Lower
settings create more detail. For this example, I
set it to 3.
 Texture Coverage sets how much texture is
applied to the image. Higher settings make for
more texture, but lower the amount of detail.
So, for my example, I set it to a pretty low set-
ting of 5.
12.
Use the Texture drop-down list to select Burlap.
Burlap texture imitates watercolor paper.
13.
Set Scaling to 50% and Relief to 2.
14.
Use the Light drop-down list to select the
direction that the light is coming from for
your image.
For the Maine coast photograph, the light from
the setting sun is coming from the lower-right
portion of the photo. So, I chose Lower Right as
the setting.
15.
Click OK to close the Filter Gallery and apply
the filter to the Underpainting layer.
16.
In the Layers palette, use the Blending Mode
drop-down list to select Soft Light and set the
Opacity to 50%.
You may need to fiddle with the Opacity slider
to get this setting just right. If you hide the upper
Note Paper layer and view the other two layers,
you see that much of the detail is restored, as
shown in Figure 38-6. (If you hide the Note Paper
layer, don’t forget to make it visible again.)
17.
Select the Note Paper layer in the Layers
palette.
18.
Choose Filter➪Sketch➪Note Paper.
The Filter Gallery opens with the Note Paper fil-
ter selected. Figure 38-7 shows the settings for
this filter. The Note Paper filter adds more tex-
ture and detail and lightens the image overall.
• Figure 38-4: Now that I have a watercolor “base,” I’ll use
other filters to restore the detail.
9.
Select the Underpainting layer in the Layers
palette.
10.
Choose Filter➪Artistic➪Underpainting.
The Filter Gallery opens showing the
Underpainting settings at the right of the
dialog box. These settings are shown in Fig-
ure 38-5. The Underpainting filter is going to
be used to add saturation and depth to the
image.
• Figure 38-5: Use the settings to adjust the Underpainting
filter.

19.
Set the Image Balance to 25.
You may need to play with this slider a bit to get
the best results for your image. Lower settings
show more highlight area; higher settings show
more relief area. The balance between the high-
lights and relief shows the most details.
20.
Set Graininess to 7 and Relief to 20.
21.
Click OK to close the Filter Gallery and apply
the filter to the Note Paper layer.
22.
With the Note Paper layer still selected in the
Layers palette, use the Blending Mode drop-
down list to select Soft Light.
Your watercolor painting is now complete! As
shown in Figure 38-8, the texture and detail in
the Maine photograph looks really good. 
• Figure 38-8: The completed watercolor painting.
Adding Highlights to 
Your Painting
If you want to add some highlights, select the Brush
tool in the Toolbox, pick a watercolor brush tip by
using the Brush Preset picker, and use either the
Eyedropper tool or Color Picker to select colors.
You can paint highlights on a separate, empty layer.
That way, if you make a mistake, it doesn’t affect any
of the filtered layers.

Making Images
Look Like
Pressed Tin
B
ack in the early part of the previous century, pressed tin ceilings
were very popular. Sometimes they were left their natural silver
color; other times they were painted white or other colors.
This technique shows you how to filter an image so that it takes on the
appearance of silvery pressed tin. You use the Emboss and Bas Relief fil-
ters blended by using the Overlay blending mode to achieve these results.
This technique may look a bit tricky because of the many steps, but don’t
worry! It’s really quite simple. Just follow along and you can be pressing
tin in no time.
Pressing Tin
Though you can turn any image into pressed tin, simple images or homey
ones are the most appropriate. Fleur-de-lis, hearts, and household objects
really come to mind. For this example, I’m using a scan of the handmade
doily shown in Figure 39-1.

Creating Photo
Silkscreens
A
ndy Warhol created a revolution in the art world when he took the
photo silkscreen process, normally used for commercial mass print-
ing, and used it to create fine art. You may be familiar with his
Campbell’s Soup series, the Gumby silkscreens, and perhaps the best-
known Marilyn Monroe photo silkscreens.
This technique takes you step-by-step through the entire process of
creating your own silkscreens in a virtual Photoshop fashion. So pull
out an image (perhaps a photo of Marilyn?) and create your own photo
silkscreens. Color Plate 40-1 shows the colorful results of this technique.
How Did Andy Do It?
Photo silkscreens are produced by taking a high-contrast photograph
and transferring the image onto silk fabric that is stretched over a frame.
The silk is first coated with a light-sensitive solution. The photograph is
projected onto the solution-covered silk, and the solution hardens where
it is exposed to light. To produce a print, ink is pushed through the silk
onto paper by using a squeegee. Any solution-hardened areas don’t let
the ink pass through.
Even though you don’t use silk and ink in Photoshop, you can create
really interesting photo silkscreens by using the High Pass and Median
filters applied to individual channels.

You may need to fiddle a little with this setting to
get the best balance between black and white.
• Figure 40-3: In the Threshold dialog box, set the
Threshold Level to 125.
Making Your Silkscreen
The steps here are pretty straightforward, but they
do take some knowledge of the Channels palette.
For instance, you need to know how to select multi-
ple channels. If you need a refresher on channels,
turn to Technique 52.
Several of the steps involve selecting a specific
channel, but you may want to experiment with
a different channel depending on the colors
in your image. Run through the steps a few
times, selecting a different series of channels
each time.
Here’s how to turn your image into a photo
silkscreen:
1.
Open the image that you want to use.
For this example, I’m using the four lizards
shown in Figure 40-1.
• Figure 40-1: These lizards are going to be silkscreened.
2.
In the Channels palette, choose the Green and
Blue channels.
3.
Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Equalize.
4.
In the Channels palette, choose the Red
channel.
5.
Choose Filter➪Other➪High Pass.

10.
Click OK to close the Threshold dialog box and
apply the command to the Red channel.
The four lizards now look like those shown in
Figure 40-4.
• Figure 40-4: After applying the Threshold command to
the Red channel, the lizards are starting to
look like a silkscreen.
11.
In the Channels palette, select the Blue channel.
12.
Choose Filter➪Noise➪Median.
13.
In the Median dialog box, set the Radius to 5, as
shown in Figure 40-5.
Setting the radius to 4 makes the Blue channel
very smooth looking.
14.
With the Blue channel still selected, choose
Image➪Adjustments➪Threshold.
15.
In the Threshold dialog box, set the Threshold
Level to 40.
You may need to play with this setting to get a
good balance between black and white.
After adding a black background, the four lizards
look just like a Warhol silkscreen, as shown in
Figure 40-6 and Color Plate 40-1.
• Figure 40-5: Set the Radius to 5.
• Figure 40-6: The lizards definitely look reminiscent of a
Warhol silkscreen.
Another way to create a photo silkscreen
effect is to apply the Stamp filter to one of
the channels. If you want to experiment, open
an image and apply the Stamp filter to the
Red channel first and see what kind of results
you get.

Technique
Sketching with
Filters
S
everal of the filters on the Sketch menu imitate different drawing
media, including charcoal, chalk and charcoal, and graphic pen.
These filters work surprisingly well, turning images into black and
white sketched renditions.
When layered with the original image and blended together with a blend-
ing mode, these filters can produce even more interesting images: colored
sketches. Another appealing method that produces an interesting image
is to apply color to a sketch by using gradient maps, photo filters, or the
Hue/Saturation command. (Take a look at Techniques 33 and 35 to find
out more about these features.)
This technique is going to explore these areas. First, you find out how
to use the Charcoal, Chalk and Charcoal, and Graphic Pen filters. Then
you experiment with blending sketched layers and also apply color to a
sketch. These techniques are quite straightforward, so have some fun
and try them out! Take a look at Color Plate 41-1 to see what these col-
ored sketches look like.
Applying Sketch Filters
The three sketch filters that I discuss here — Charcoal, Chalk and
Charcoal, and Graphic Pen — all work in the same fashion. Before you
even select one of these filters from the Filter➪Sketch menu, be sure
to select Foreground and Background colors in the Toolbox. These colors
are the ones that will be used by the sketch filters. The Background set-
ting determines the color of the “paper” that the sketch is done on, and
the Foreground setting determines the color that is used for the actual
“ink” of the sketching.
When the colors are set, you can access the Charcoal, Chalk and Charcoal,
and Graphic Pen filters. To do so, open the Filter Gallery by choosing
Filter➪Sketch➪Charcoal, Chalk and Charcoal, or Graphic Pen. The

The settings for each filter are pretty much the same.
They include Thickness, Detail, Light/Dark Balance,
and possibly Light Direction. Adjust these settings
as you like to achieve a good balance between the
light and dark elements. Figure 41-2 shows an origi-
nal photograph and the rendering by each of the
three filters.
Overall, these filters do a great job of creating char-
coal and graphic pen sketches by using different
drawing methods. The following sections show
you how to enhance the filter effects by layering
or recoloring.
Blending Layers
Using layer techniques, you can create beautiful col-
ored sketches. Think of them as mixed media — for
instance, a graphic pen sketch colored with water-
colors, or a pastel sketch outlined and defined with
charcoal.

Pen filter in Step 4 to get the blended results
shown in Figure 41-4.
• Figure 41-4: The same photo with the Graphic Pen filter

You can apply a filter to the lower layer (the
original photograph) to create a mixed media
illustration. Figure 41-5 shows a blend of the
Charcoal filtered layer on the top with the
Rough Pastels filter applied to the lower layer.
The following directions show you how to filter lay-
ers and then blend them. Which filters you use is up
to you. Use your imagination when combining filtered
layers. You may be surprised at some of the great
results that you get. If you’re trying these steps for
the first time, stick to the directions so that you can
get an idea of what’s going on.
1.
Open the image that you’re going to use.
For this example, I’m using the boat photograph
shown in Figure 41-2.
2.
Select the layer containing the image in the
Layers palette.
3.
Press Ctrl+J/Ô+J or choose Layer➪New➪
Layer via Copy.
A copy of the selected layer appears in the
Layers palette.
4.
With the copied layer selected, choose Filter➪
Sketch➪Charcoal (or one of the other two
filters).
5.
Use the Filter Gallery dialog box that appears
to adjust the filter settings.
For the boat photograph, I set Charcoal
Thickness to 3, Detail to 5, and Light/Dark
Balance to 62. You may need to adjust these
settings to suit your image.
6.
Click OK to close the Filter Gallery and apply
the filter to the copied layer.
7.
In the Layers palette, select an option from the
Blending Mode drop-down list.
For my image, I selected the Soft Light option.
You may also want to try the Overlay blending
mode. As shown in Figure 41-3, the upper char-
coal filtered layer blends with the lower layer to
fill in detail and color. Use your imagination
because this book is in black and white!

Applying Color to Sketches
251
• Figure 41-5: When the Rough Pastel filter is applied to

Applying Color to Sketches
You can apply color to sketches by using the com-
mands on the Image➪Adjustments menu. In particu-
lar, the Gradient Map, Hue/Saturation, and Photo
Filter commands work really well.
When applying any of the adjustment commands to
a sketch, I recommend applying them as adjustment
layers. Adjustment layers are infinitely flexible. You
don’t change any pixels on the sketch layer, and you
can change the command’s settings at any time. If
you want to find out more about adjustment layers,
take a look at Technique 22.
Use the following directions to apply any of the
adjustment commands by using an adjustment layer:
1.
Use one of the sketch filters to turn an image
into a sketch.
Refer to the earlier section, “Applying Sketch
Filters.”
2.
In the Layers palette, select the layer contain-
ing the sketch.
3.
Click the Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer
button at the bottom of the Layers palette.
4.
Choose either Hue/Saturation, Gradient Map,
or Photo Filter from the menu.
The dialog box for the command that you
selected opens. (To find out more about gradi-
ent maps, take a look at Technique 27; for photo
filters and Hue/Saturation, turn to Technique 33.)
5.
Use the dialog box to adjust settings, and then
click OK.
The selected color is applied to the sketch layer.
You can always change the settings of the
adjustment layer by double-clicking the adjust-
ment layer’s thumbnail in the Layers palette.

Technique
I’ve Been Framed!
F
rames add the finishing touch to any image, be it a real-world photo-
graph or painting, or a Photoshop image. Frames smooth out the
edges, and add focus and definition to any image.
Creating frames in Photoshop is really quite easy. In this technique, you
use a layer mask to delineate the area that you want to frame and then
apply a filter to the layer mask to blur edges, add texture, or create some
other effect. In addition, you use a fill layer to color the frame with a solid
color, gradient, or pattern.
If the terms fill layer and layer mask are completely new to you,
take a look at Technique 21 to find out about fill layers, and see
Technique 49 to read about layer masks. If you have some familiarity
with these Photoshop features, just follow the steps; I tell you exactly
what you need to do.
Creating Frames
When you create the selection that becomes the layer mask (and even-
tually the frame) in Step 4, remember that not all frames are rectangular.
They can be elliptical, triangular, or even shaped like a heart. Besides
using the selection tools as I describe in Step 4, think about what other
tools you could use to create interesting selections. For instance, you
could use the Custom Shape tool to create a path in the shape of a star
or musical note, and then change the path into a selection by clicking
the Load Path as Selection button at the bottom of the Paths palette. You
could also use the Type Mask tool to create a type-shaped selection. The
shape of the frame can be anything — use your imagination!
Here’s how to create a frame with a layer mask:
1.
Open the image that you want to put a frame around.
For this example, I’m using the photograph of the sock monkeys
shown in Figure 42-1. If the image is contained on the Background
layer, convert the Background to a regular layer by selecting Layer➪
New➪Layer from Background.

2.
Click the Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer
button at the bottom of the Layers palette and
choose either Solid, Gradient, or Pattern from
the menu.
This fill layer is going to be used to color the
frame. If you select Solid, use the Color Picker
to select a color. If you select Gradient, use the
Gradient picker in the Gradient Fill dialog box
to select a gradient. If you select Pattern, use
the Pattern picker in the Pattern Fill dialog box
to select a pattern.
If you decide later that you don’t like the color,
pattern, or gradient that you select in this step,
you can always change it. Just double-click the
layer thumbnail to access the dialog box. To
find out more about how flexible fill layers are,
turn to Technique 21.
3.
In the Layers palette, drag the new fill layer
that you just created to below the layer con-
taining the image that you want to frame.
You should now have two layers, the fill layer
on the bottom and the image layer on the top,
as shown in Figure 42-2.
• Figure 42-2: Two layers should be in the Layers palette:
the image layer on top and the fill layer on
the bottom.
4.
Use any of the selection tools to select the area
that you want to place the frame around.
You could use the Rectangular Marquee tool
to create a rectangular selection, the Elliptical
Marquee tool to create an oval selection, or
even the Lasso tool to create a freeform selec-
tion around the image area. Figure 42-3 shows
the sock monkeys selected. If the selection isn’t
centered, don’t worry about it. You can correct
that later.
5.
At the bottom of the Layers palette, click Add
Layer Mask.
A layer mask appears linked to the layer contain-
ing the image in the Layers palette, as shown in
Figure 42-4.

ere it is. The big kahuna of filter techniques. You have to get through
lots of steps, but it’s worth it! This technique uses the Channels and
Layers palettes, levels and curves, and the Gaussian Blur, Emboss,
and Plastic Wrap filters to submerge an image in liquid. Don’t think that
this effect is only for images; you can create some type and drop it in
water, too.
If the number of steps seems daunting, don’t freak out! All the steps are
really pretty simple, so you shouldn’t have any trouble with them. Because
this technique does use the Layers and Channels palettes, you may want
to brush up on them by visiting Technique 15 (for layers) and Technique 52
(for channels).
Create an action
Because this technique involves a long series of steps, repeating it over and over
when you want to use it can be quite tedious and time consuming. If you like the
effect and want to use it again, why not create an action — a mini-program that does
all the steps for you? To find out how to record an action, turn to Technique 8. 
Ready, Get Set, Dunk!
This technique works best on simple images containing an object or type
layer. For the demonstration here, I’m using a photograph of an old key,
shown in Figure 43-1. Complex images add too much in the way of shad-
ows and detail, detracting from the finished effect.
This technique uses many steps, so I’ve broken them up into three sec-
tions. The first section sets up a custom “Liquid” channel. Section two
builds on section one and shows you how to create a “Water” layer. The
third and final section takes you through putting the custom channel and
layer together to create the full liquid effect. Make your way sequentially
through each section and soon your image will be dripping with liquid!

Super Type Effects

Shadow Type
W
hen you see type on a page or in an image, it’s often filled with
some color, perhaps red or black. It may have a drop shadow to
give it a three-dimensional look, but usually it’s the color inside
the type that defines each character’s shape.
This morning I woke up and thought to myself, “What if the type is trans-
parent? How could I read it?” Then the answer came to me: Define the
shape of the type’s outline by using a drop shadow and an inner shadow.
And, voilà, here you are.
This technique works really well on any image because the type itself is
transparent — no color matching is needed to fill the type because the
shadows do all the work. This method works best when an image displays
a lot of contrast. In the following steps, I use black for the drop shadow
and white for the inner shadow, which works well on any area that isn’t
too dark. But if you want to use this method on a black area, for instance,
you should change the drop shadow’s color to red or white. The shadows’
contrasts are the key to defining the shape of the type.
Shadow Dancing
Creating type by using shadows is really easy thanks to layer styles and
the Fill slider on the Layers palette. What you need to do is create some
type, which automatically appears on its own type layer, and then apply
a drop shadow and an inner shadow using layer styles. The final step is
to lower the type layer’s Fill opacity to 0% making the type’s fill (but not
the shadows) transparent. Here’s how:
1.
Open the image that you want to add type to.
For this example, I’m using the hearts image shown in Figure 44-1.

Jazzing Up Your Shadow Type
Experiment with the other layer styles that are avail-
able. For instance, you could add a bevel to the type
or an inner glow. I took the shadow type created in
the preceding steps and added a pattern overlay with
the Multiply blending mode, as shown in Figure 44-7.
The pattern picks up the red of the hearts under-
neath and adds a fun touch to the type.

Knock-Out Type
I
’m sure that you’ve seen advertisements in newspapers or magazines
where some large type looks like it is filled with an image, pattern, or
texture. This effect is really easy to create by using a layer mask. (I give
you a quick run-down here of how a layer mask works, but to find out the
full score, turn to Technique 49.)
Imagine that you have an image with two layers. The lower layer contains
a photograph of trees, and the upper layer is filled with a solid color. Both
layers are set at 100% opacity. This means that you can see the upper, solid
color layer, but you can’t see the tree layer below it. Now, you link a layer
mask to the solid color layer and paint with black on the layer mask. The
black areas of the layer mask hide the corresponding areas of the solid
color layer, letting you see the tree layer underneath. The white areas of
the layer mask leave the corresponding areas of the solid color layer visi-
ble. Basically, a layer mask is used to hide portions of the layer that it’s
linked to, revealing the layer underneath.
In this technique, you find out how to use a layer mask to create knock-
out type — type shapes filled with an image or color. What really makes
this easy are the Type Mask tools, which create type-shaped selections.
After creating your knock-out type with a layer mask, why not experiment
with applying a filter to the layer mask to enhance the type effect? Using
filters, you can come up with some really interesting results. For starters,
try applying the Sponge or Craquelure filter.
Cookie Cutting and Knock-Outs
I was making cookies with my kids the other day, using alphabet-shaped
cookie cutters, when I realized that we were creating type knock-outs.
After pressing down with the cookie cutter and removing the cut out 
letter, we were left with a letter-shape cut on the sheet of cookie dough
that let the table underneath show. Nothing like life imitating art.

Toolbox.
9.
Use the Options bar to select a type font and
size.
For this example, I’m using Bard set at 65 points.
10.
Click in the image window and type some text.
Because you’re using the Horizontal Type Mask
tool, Photoshop automatically switches you to
quickmask mode, and a translucent red overlay
appears on your screen. This overlay disappears
when you’re finished using the tool.
Layer mask
Creating type knock-outs is really easy even if you’ve
never worked with layer masks before. Just follow
the directions and you can have knock-outs in no
time. (I’ve avoided the urge to be a punster and
include “Your type will be a knock-out” or “Your type
will be able to go five rounds with Mohammed Ali,
ready for a knock-out.” Real groaners, huh?)
Here’s how:
1.
Open an image that you want to use as the fill
for the knock-out type.
You could also create a new document and fill it
with a solid color, gradient, or pattern. Whatever
you want. For this example, I’m using the zebra
photograph shown in Figure 45-1.
• Figure 45-1: For this example, I’m using a zebra photo
for the knock-out type filler.
2.
Click the Create New Layer button at the bot-
tom of the Layers palette.
A new layer appears selected above the fill layer.
3.
Rename the new layer.
I’ve renamed mine Type Cut-Out. This is what 
I call this layer for the rest of the directions.
4.
Fill the new layer with a solid color.
For my example, I’ve filled the layer with 
brick red.

create a fade out effect above and below the
type, as shown in Figure 45-5. To find out how 
to create fade outs, turn to Technique 50.

Technique
Pouring Liquid
Metals
R
eal world metal is shiny, reflective, and lustrous. It has depth and
can even look heavy. How do you create the appearance of metal
when you’re dealing with a two-dimensional object like a type
character on a flat screen?
The real trick to making a two-dimensional object look like metal is in the
extreme contrast of lights and darks that give the impression of reflec-
tion, shine, and depth. This technique focuses on two different methods
for creating metals. The first method shows you how to create what I call
super chrome by using a custom gradient and curves. The second method
takes you into pouring molten copper into type with the Bas Relief filter,
curves, layer styles, and the Chrome filter.
Even though this technique uses type as the object for these liquid
metal effects, you can use any kind of simple image (such as a styl-
ized company logo or nav bar) for a Web site.
Creating Super Chrome
I’ve seen lots of techniques that create the look of chrome, but many fall
short when it comes to the shininess and reflective qualities of highly
polished chrome. The secret to this super chrome method is applying
two curves adjustment layers at the end. Here’s how:
1.
Choose File➪New to create a new document.
Make it rather large, say 3 inches high by 5 inches wide, and set it in
RGB color mode with a white background.
2.
Set the Foreground color to light gray and the Background color to
white.
For this example, I used the Color Picker to set the HSB text boxes to
H: 0%, S: 0%, and B: 70% for the light gray Foreground color.

3.
Use the Horizontal Type tool to create some
type.
The type needs to be large for this effect to work
best. For my example, I’m using the Wingdings
font set at 250 points, as shown in Figure 46-1.
You should now have two layers: a white
Background layer and a type layer.
• Figure 46-1: I’m turning this bomb into chrome.
4.
With the type layer selected in the Layers
palette, click the Add Layer Style button at the
bottom of the palette and choose Bevel and
Emboss from the menu.
5.
In the Structure area of the Layer Style dialog
box, use the drop-down lists and sliders to
select settings, as shown in Figure 46-2.
 Use the Style drop-down list to select Inner
Bevel.
 Use the Technique drop-down list to select

 Set the Depth slider to 100%.
 Select the Up Direction radio button.
 Set the Size to 10 pixels.
 Set Soften to 0 pixels.
6.
Click the words Gradient Overlay to view those
layer style settings and put a check mark in the
Gradient Overlay check box.
The default settings shown in Figure 46-3 work
fine, but you need to create a custom gradient
for this effect (not hard!).
• Figure 46-2: Use the settings in the Structure area to
create the bevel.
• Figure 46-3: Use the default Gradient Overlay settings,

Editor shown in Figure 46-4.
8.
In the Presets swatch area at the top of the dia-
log box, click the Foreground to Background
gradient swatch. (It’s the first swatch in the
upper left.)
You use this swatch to create the custom gradi-
ent. Figure 46-5 shows the Custom Gradient Bar
(below the Smoothness text box) that you use to
create the custom gradient. At the bottom of the
bar are color stops. Notice that the color stop on
the left contains the Foreground color (gray),

final application of the Chrome filter really makes
this metal shine. Take a look at Color Plate 46-1 to
see how ordinary black type turns into copper type.
Here’s how to pour some molten copper into your
type or logo:
1.
Choose File➪New to create a new document.

wide, and set it in RGB color mode with a white
background.
2.
Set the Foreground color to black.
The quick way to do this is to press D.
3.
Use the Horizontal Type tool to create some
type.
The type should be large for this effect to work
best. For my example, I’m using the Wingdings
font set at 250 points, as shown in Figure 46-12.
You should now have two layers: a white
Background layer and a type layer.
• Figure 46-12: I’m turning this phone from black to
copper.

urn, baby, burn! Fire is such a primeval force. Volcanoes erupt
spewing rock that’s so hot it’s literally on fire. Lava and fire glow
red and yellow; they radiate heat. Lava drips, oozes, and melts
things.
What can you do to create type that looks like it’s on fire or dripping with
lava? You can’t make type literally radiate heat (unless your computer CPU
is having a meltdown!), but you can make the type glow and look like it’s
flickering like flames.
This technique takes a look at creating two kinds of hot type: type that
looks like it’s on fire and type that appears to be melting under the heat
of dripping lava. First, you create fiery type by applying the Neon Glow
and Sprayed Strokes filters, and then you add a red glow by using layer
styles. Next, you move on to creating type that drips and oozes with lava.
You use the Liquify filter to stretch the type, and then add a lava layer by
creating a path with the Freeform Pen tool. After filling the path with red,
you apply layer styles to make the lava lumpy and the type glow. To see
the full effect in color, take a look at Color Plate 47-1.
So pull out your fireproof mitts and start handling burning type!
This technique isn’t only for type — you can also use it to light up
graphic logos and images. After seeing what you can do with type,
open an image and experiment with it! 
Setting Your Type on Fire
You don’t have to sing as well as the Doors to set your type on fire. This
method is really quite simple and easy. All you use are filters and the
Outer Glow layer style, so just follow the steps and you won’t get burned!

On the Options bar, click the Paths button.
In order to make the type look like it’s melting, you
need to use the Liquify filter, which is accessible by
choosing Filter➪Liquify. If you haven’t used it before,
don’t be intimidated by the huge dialog box and many
controls. All you really need to know about the dialog
box is that the tools are located along the left side,
the Work Area in the middle is where you stretch and
pull the type, and the settings at the upper-right con-
trol the size of the brush tip that you’re using. If you
have a few minutes, play with Liquify before trying
this technique. If you don’t have a few minutes, just
follow the steps — I’m sure you’ll do great!

Going Translucent:
Clear Type and
Jelly Type
S
ome of the most powerful graphic effects with type involve manipu-
lating clear — or translucent — effects. Undoubtedly, you’ve seen
many examples of type or graphics such as logos created by using
these effects in magazines and other print media.
The great thing is that it’s really easy to create powerful and smashing
translucent type effects with Photoshop. As a general matter, creating
these effects involves using layer styles and a few select filters.
In this technique, first I show you how to create generic clear type. This
is the basic form of the translucent type effect. After you see how it works,
you can use it as the springboard for more elaborate effects. Try adding
another layer and applying a filter or adding a little color to the type by
using a layer style such as Color Overlay.
Next, you find out how to create type that looks like jelly. Have you
looked at a bowl of gelatin lately? (I have; my kids are 6 and 2!) It wiggles,
it jiggles, and I’m not sure how appetizing it is, but it certainly has a dis-
tinctive graphic appearance. You can pretty easily create type that looks
like gelatin by using layer styles. Best of all, you don’t even have to eat it.
You can see each of these effects in full living color if you turn to Color
Plate 48-1.
This technique also works for graphic logos and simple images. For
instance, you can create buttons for a Web page. So don’t feel limited
because the title says “type.” Use your imagination and try applying
these great effects to a special image.
Creating Clear Type
The trick to clear type is defining it with shadows, highlights, and bevels.
Because if the type is really clear, how can you see it?

For this effect, you’re using the Drop Shadow,
Inner Shadow, and Bevel and Emboss layer
styles.
4.
In the Drop Shadow Structure area, use the
Blend Mode drop-down list to select Soft Light.
The rest of the default settings work just fine, so
there’s no need to change them.
• Figure 48-2: The type layer appears above the
background image.
5.
Click the words Inner Shadow to select the
Inner Shadow check box and to view those
settings.
6.
In the Inner Shadow Structure area, use the
Blend Mode drop-down list to select Pin Light.
The rest of the default settings work well, so
there’s no more fiddling here.
7.
Click the words Bevel and Emboss to select the
Bevel and Emboss check box and to view those
settings.
8.
In the Bevel and Emboss Structure area, move
the Depth slider to 50% and set the Size to 40
pixels, as shown in Figure 48-3.
This sets the shape of the bevel. You may need
to fiddle a bit to get the best results for the type
that you’re using. Ultimately, you’re looking for a
pretty rounded shape.
This type effect is most visible with an image or
patterned background behind it. The shape of the
type is initially defined by using Inner Shadow and
Drop Shadow layer styles. Then, it’s given a three-
dimensional shape by applying a Bevel and Emboss
layer style. Finally, a second layer is added above
the type layer and the Plaster filter is applied to
give the appearance of thickness.
Here’s how to jellify your type:
1.
Open the image that you want to use as the
background for the type.
For this example, I’m using the pink stone back-
ground shown in Figure 48-1.
• Figure 48-1: Select a background image or pattern for
the type.
2.
Use the Horizontal Type tool to create some
type, as shown in Figure 48-2.
The type appears on its own type layer above
the background image. For this example, 
I selected AdLib BT set at 110 points.
3.
With the type layer selected, click the Add
Layer Style button at the bottom of the Layers
palette and choose Drop Shadow from the
menu.

In the Bevel and Emboss Shading area, use the
Highlight Mode drop-down list to select Hard
Light and the Shadow Mode drop-down list to
select Pin Light.
The settings affect how the highlights and shad-
ows blend with the background image layer.
10.
In the Shading area, click the down arrow
next to the Gloss Contour swatch to open the
Contour picker, as shown in Figure 48-4.
• Figure 48-4: The Gloss Contour affects how the

12.
Click OK to close the Layer Style dialog box
and apply the effects to the type.
13.
With the type layer still selected, lower the Fill
Opacity to 0% in the Layers palette.
The fill disappears and the type becomes clear,
as shown in Figure 48-5.
• Figure 48-5: The clear type looks really great.
And that’s it — you’ve created clear type. If you
want, you can stop after completing the preceding
13 steps. However, if you want to add extra definition
to the shape of the type, continue with these steps:
1.
With the type layer still active, click the Create
New Layer button at the bottom of the Layers
palette.
A new empty layer appears selected above the
type layer.
2.
Rename the new layer if you want.
For this example, I’ve named the layer Definition.
I refer to the layer by this name for the rest of
the steps.
3.
Ctrl+click/Ô+click the type layer’s thumbnail to
create a selection shaped like the type.
Don’t select the type layer. The Definition layer
should still be selected.

13.
Use the Fill slider to lower the Definition
layer’s fill opacity to 40%.
You may need to fiddle with this setting to get
the Definition layer to blend just right with the
background image that you’re using. The fin-
ished clear type should look like the type shown
in Figure 48-8.
• Figure 48-8: The clear type has a slight white sheen for

Making That Jelly Roll
This technique is the layer style blowout! You use six
layer styles to create jelly-like type, and then add a
layer on top that adds brightness and shine with the
Chrome filter. Take a look at Color Plate 48-1 to see
the metamorphosis from flat type to red jelly.
The steps may look rather complicated, but they’re
not! Even if you’ve never used layer styles before,
you can use these directions to create some super
type. Just follow along and you can have jelly type in
no time. (If you want to find out more about layer
styles, take a look at Technique 20.)

Using Channels and
Masks (It’s not as hard
as you think!)

Working with
Layer Masks
L
ayer masks are great! They’re simple to use and very powerful, but
people don’t use them enough. For some reason, many Photoshop
users tend to think that layer masks are hard to use or that they
somehow work by magic. Not so! This technique is here to debunk the
myths — I condense years of explaining layer masks into a couple pages.
Here’s the definition: A layer mask hides or reveals parts of a layer. Period.
End of mystery. I’ve heard so many confusing, over-complicated explana-
tions about layer masks that I’m setting it all out in black and white (liter-
ally) with clear, simple explanations.
So open Photoshop, grab an image to play with, and try your hand at layer
masks. At first, they may seem a bit counterintuitive, but after you get a
handle on layer masks, you won’t be able to live without them! 
Layer Masks 101: How They Work
I’m sure that you’ve worked with layer opacity by now. For instance, if
you move the Opacity slider on the Layers palette down from 100%, the
layer starts to become translucent. Lower the Opacity slider all the way
to 0%, and the layer disappears altogether.
But, how to you hide one part of the layer and leave another part of the
same layer visible? Do it with layer masks.
For my demonstration today, the friendly looking alien in Figure 49-1 has
volunteered to help me. (Cute, isn’t he? I especially like the jaunty hat
over one eye.)

Click the Add Layer Mask button at the bottom
of the Layers palette.
A layer mask appears linked to the layer, as
shown in Figure 49-2.
A layer mask can be added to any layer
except the Background layer.
The tiny link icon that appears to the left of
the layer mask thumbnail indicates that if you
move or transform the layer, the layer mask
will be transformed at the same time. 
• Figure 49-2: The layer mask appears linked to the layer.

Select black as the Foreground color.
A quick way to do this is to press D.
5.
Select the Brush tool from the Toolbox and
select a simple brush tip from the Brush Preset
picker on the Options bar.
For this example, I’m using a brush tip with a 50
pixel diameter and a 100% Hardness setting.
6.
In the Layers palette, click the layer mask to
select it.

Click here
• Figure 49-1: This happy looking fellow is going to help
with the layer mask demonstration.
Here’s the layer mask demonstration:
1.
In the Layers palette, click Create New Layer
and fill the layer with white.
A quick way to do this is to press D, and then
press X, and then press Alt+Backspace/
Option+Backspace. A new layer appears
above the layer containing the alien, so the
alien disappears, and all you can see is the
white layer. (I omit the figure here because
I’m sure that you can imagine a white layer.)
2.
In the Layers palette, select the layer that you
want to add the layer mask to.
For this example, select the white layer.

Layer Masks 101: How They Work
301
7.
Stroke with the Brush in the image window.
As you paint with black on the layer mask, the
areas that you cover hide the white layer that
the layer mask is attached to and reveal the alien
below, as shown in Figure 49-3.
• Figure 49-3: Painting with black reveals the layer below.
Notice where the black area is on the layer
mask and the corresponding area in the
image window.

Revealed layer underneath
Following the preceding steps, you discover that

White on a layer mask leaves the attached layer
visible, hiding the layer underneath.

Black on a layer mask hides the attached layer,
revealing the layer underneath.
But, what about gray? Painting on a layer mask with
gray is like using the Opacity slider on the Layer
palette. Gray makes a layer mask translucent. You
can vary the opacity by using lighter or darker grays.
Lighter grays leave the layer mask more opaque, and
darker grays make the layer mask more transparent,
as shown in Figure 49-4.
• Figure 49-4: Painting with different shades of gray makes
the layer mask more or less transparent.

Technique 49: Working with Layer Masks
302
• Figure 49-5: Under the hood, a layer mask is really a
grayscale channel.
Layer mask channel
Another way to make the layer mask translu-
cent is to use the Opacity slider on the Options
bar. You can use just black or white (instead of
gray) and lower the Opacity to partially reveal
or hide portions of a layer. The advantage is
that you don’t need to select different shades
of gray, and Opacity percentages are absolute
and easy to replicate.
Layer Masks 102: What 
Are They Really?
Under the hood, a layer mask is actually a grayscale
channel. If you take a look at the bottom of the list
in the Channels palette, you see the layer mask you
create in the previous section, “Layer Masks 101:
How They Work,” as shown in Figure 49-5. If you click
the layer mask channel in the Channels palette, it’s
displayed in the image window.
Because the layer mask is a channel, it gives you all
the flexibility of a channel. You can use the channel
to create a mask-shaped selection, you can edit the
layer mask to reshape it, and you can view the layer
mask either by itself in the image window (where
it appears in grayscale) or as a colored overlay
superimposed on the image. (To find out more
about channels and what they’re capable of, turn
to Technique 52.)

Creating Layer Masks by Using Selections
303
Creating Layer Masks
by Using Selections
Layer masks can also be created by using a selec-
tion. Of course, you can create the selection by
using any of the selection tools available in the
Toolbox. However, you have another way to create
very precise selections: using the Pen tool.
With the Pen tool, you can create an exact path
around the object that you want to select. For
instance, take a look at Figure 49-6. I selected the
woman’s face and hair with the Pen tool. Because the
Pen tool uses Bezier curves with points and direction
points, you can shape the path exactly the way that
you want it. After that, all you need to do is turn the
path into a selection by clicking the Load Path as
Selection button at the bottom of the Paths palette.
• Figure 49-6: The Pen tool can be used to create precise
selections.
Layer masks can’t be added to the Background
layer. You must first convert the Background
layer to a regular layer by choosing Layer➪
New➪Layer from Background. Then you can
use the Pen or selection tools to create a selec-
tion and turn the selection into a layer mask.
Here are the rest of the directions for turning a selec-
tion into a layer mask:
1.
Create a selection by using any of the selection
tools or the Pen tool.
Figure 49-7 shows the woman’s face selected.
You can feather the selection by choosing
Select➪Feather. This softens the transition
from the selected area to the unselected area.
2.
Choose Layer➪Add Layer Mask to open the
Add Layer Mask menu.
• Figure 49-7: Select the area that you want to mask.

Corel KnockOut 2
KnockOut 2 by Corel is an amazing product. It helps
you quickly create complicated masks that include difficult
areas — such as hair, eyelashes, and shadows — in a selection.
When you install KnockOut 2, it’s automatically loaded
onto the Filter menu. To access KnockOut, choose Filter➪
KnockOut 2➪Load Working Layer. The KnockOut 2 pro-
gram loads, showing the selected layer in the Work Area.
All you need to do to create a selection is to use the Inside
Object and Outside Object tools to quickly create rough
outlines that indicate to KnockOut where the inside and
the outside areas are. (KnockOut also provides Inside Shadow
Object and Outside Shadow Object tools to roughly outline
shadowed areas to include in the selection.) 
From there, choose Edit➪Process and KnockOut creates
the complex selection for you, as shown in the following
figure. (Notice how the strands of hair are selected!)
If you need to create complicated masks, I highly recom-
mend KnockOut 2. You can find it at www.corel.com;
choose Products➪All Products.
3.
Choose one of the Add Layer Mask menu items.
 Reveal Selection creates a layer mask that fills
the selected area with white and the unselected
area with black. This hides the unselected area
of the layer and leaves the selected area visible.
 Hide Selection creates a layer mask that
fills the selected area with black and the
unselected area with white. This hides the
selected area of the layer and leaves the
unselected area visible.

Add Layer Mask➪Reveal Selection is chosen.
• Figure 49-8: After choosing Reveal Selection, only the
woman’s face is visible.

Editing Layer Masks
305
Editing Layer Masks
You can change the shape of a layer mask if you need
to. For instance, suppose you decide that the layer
linked to the layer mask doesn’t show enough of a face
down in the left corner. You can paint with white on the
layer mask to reveal more of the layer and the face.
You can edit a layer mask in three ways:

Display the layer mask by itself in the image
window and modify it that way.

Select the layer mask thumbnail in the Layers
palette and modify the layer mask by painting on
the image in the image window. (The layer mask
isn’t visible.)

Display the layer mask as a color overlay super-
imposed on the layer’s image and modify the
layer mask by using the image as your guide.
Although all three of these options are useful 
at some time or another, I find myself selecting
Door Number 3 — displaying the layer mask as an
overlay — the most often. This method is handy
because you can see the layer mask on the layer
and use the layer as a guide.
Here’s how to edit a layer mask:
1.
Select an editing tool, such as the Brush tool,
from the Toolbox.
For a complete list of tools that you can use to
edit layer masks, take a look at the sidebar
“What tools can you use to modify layer masks?”
2.
Display the layer mask to edit it.
 Alt+click/Option+click the layer mask thumb-
nail in the Layers palette to view only the
layer mask in the image window. (If you want
to use the shape tools to edit the layer mask,
you need to use this method.)
 Click the layer mask thumbnail in the Layers
palette to select it (but not to view it).
 Alt+Shift+Click/Option+Shift+Click the layer
mask thumbnail to view the layer mask as a
color overlay superimposed on the layer.
Figure 49-9 shows this method. In the figure,
the overlay appears as light gray.
3.
On the Options bar, choose Normal from 
the Mode drop-down list and set the Opacity
to 100%.
If you want to partially hide or reveal a layer, use
a lower Opacity setting.
• Figure 49-9: Viewing the layer mask as an overlay lets
you see exactly what is masked.


Select the layer mask in the Channels palette and
apply a filter to the layer mask to create a special
effect. For instance, you could use the Gaussian
Blur filter to soften the edges of the mask.

Disable the effect of a layer mask by Shift+click-
ing the layer mask thumbnail in the Layers
palette. To restore the layer mask, Shift+click
again.
Final Thoughts
To cap off this technique, I created a multi-layer image
to show you several layer masks in action. Figure 49-10
shows the individual layers in the image in their order
in the Layers palette from top to bottom.
My idea with this image is to place the Morning Glory
layer on the moon in the background image. This
means that I need to use a layer mask to hide the
areas of the morning glory that would go beyond the
edges of the moon. Then, I want to place the goats
among the alien landscape, as if they were just walk-
ing around there. This also requires a layer mask to
hide the shrubs around the goats.
After adding the layer masks and using the Soft Light
blending mode on the Morning Glory layer to blend
it into the moon, the goats look pretty happy in their
new environment. (See Figure 49-11.)
You can see the goats in color by turning to Color
Plate 49-1.
What tools can you use to 
modify layer masks?
You can use the Brush, Burn, Dodge, Eraser, Gradient,
Pencil, Sharpen, Smudge, Sponge, and Paint Bucket tools. If
you want to create exact shapes on a layer mask, you can
use the shape tools. However, the layer mask must be dis-
played in the image window. (Alt+click/Option+click the
layer mask thumbnail.)
4.
Paint in the image window with black, white,
and/or gray.
 Select black as the Foreground color and paint
with it to hide the layer (revealing more of the
layer underneath).
 Select white as the Foreground color and
paint with it to view more of the layer (hiding
more of the layer underneath).
 Select gray as the Foreground color to make
the layer mask translucent, partially revealing
the layer underneath.
Some Layer Mask Tricks
You can do a few more things with layer masks to
enhance your Photoshop prowess:

Ctrl+click/Ô+click the layer mask thumbnail in
the Layers palette to create a layer mask-shaped
selection.

Click the layer mask thumbnail in the Layers
palette to select it, and then choose Image➪
Adjustments➪Invert to reverse the effects of 
the layer mask. Visible areas become hidden
and hidden areas revealed.

combined into one image with layer masks.
• Figure 49-11: The goats look pretty happy — they don’t
even need extra oxygen.

Technique
Using Layer Masks
to Create Fade Ins
and Outs
U
sing the Opacity or Fill slider on the Layers palette can make an
entire layer translucent or even invisible. But, how do you make
only part of a layer fade out? By using layer masks, of course!
This technique is a quick study in adding gradients to layer masks to cre-
ate fade outs (or fade ins depending on how you look at it). The outlined
steps are really simple, so open an image and give this a go. After you get
the hang of it, I guarantee that you can find interesting ways to employ
this method in your images.
Checking Out Layer Masks
If you’ve worked with layer masks before, you know that white areas of a
layer mask leave the attached layer visible, hiding the layer underneath.
Black areas on a layer mask hide the attached layer, revealing the layer
underneath. Gray areas make the layer mask translucent, partially reveal-
ing the attached layer and the layer underneath. (If you’ve never used
layer masks, take a look at Technique 49 for a complete demonstration.)
So, if you apply a gradient made up of white and black (with a gray transi-
tion area) to a layer mask, the image on the layer linked to the layer mask
fades out.
Fading Away
Because layer masks work only in grayscale, the gradients that you use to
create the fade out effect have to be in grayscale also. Grayscale includes
256 levels of gray. Black and white are part of the grayscale spectrum in
Photoshop because they’re at the extreme opposite ends of the spectrum.
(Black is designated as 0, and white is designated as 255.)

Fading Away
309
Here’s how to create a fade out by using a gradient:
1.
Open the image that you want to use.
For this example, I’m using the statue shown in
Figure 50-1.
A layer mask cannot be added to the
Background layer. If your image is contained
on the Background, convert the Background
layer to a regular layer by choosing Layer➪
New➪Layer Via Background.
• Figure 50-1: I plan to use a layer mask to fade out this
image.
2.
With the image layer selected in the Layers
palette, click the Add Layer Mask button at the
bottom of the palette.
A layer mask appears linked to the image layer.
3.
Click the Create New Layer button at the 
bottom of the Layers palette.
4.
Move this new layer below your image layer
and fill it with white.
You should now have two layers, and the upper
one should have an attached layer mask, as
shown in Figure 50-2.
• Figure 50-2: You should have two layers in the Layers
palette.
5.
Click the layer mask thumbnail in the Layers
palette to select it.
6.
Select white as the Foreground color and black
as the Background color.
The quick way to do this is to press D, and then
press X.
7.
Select the Gradient tool from the Toolbox.
8.
On the Options bar, use the Gradient picker to
select the Foreground to Background gradient
(the first option in the swatch list).
9.
On the Options bar, select Normal from 
the Mode drop-down list and set the Opacity
to 100%.
10.
In the image window, click and drag from left
to right to create the gradient on the layer
mask.
When you release the mouse button, the image
in the image window fades out to white, as
shown in Figure 50-3. Take a look at the layer
mask thumbnail in the Layers palette to see 
the gradient. Notice how the white area on the
layer mask corresponds to the area in the
image window where you can see the image.

Technique 50: Using Layer Masks to Create Fade Ins and Outs
310
Of course, the gradient doesn’t have to be
drawn from left to right. It can be drawn in
any direction. Experiment with gradients on 
a layer mask, remembering that you can use
selections to limit the area where the gradient
is applied.
• Figure 50-3: The gradient on the layer mask makes the
image layer fade out.

Grouping Layers
into Clipping Masks
Y
ou’ve probably seen a matted picture in a frame. The opening in
the matting can be shaped like a rectangle, or if it’s fancy, like an
oval or heart. When the mat is placed over the image in the frame,
it limits the area of the image that you can see. The matting acts like a
mask.
Clipping masks (formerly called clipping groups) work in the same way. A
clipping mask contains several layers, and the bottom layer acts like the
matting. The outline of the bottom layer clips the other layers in the group,
so only the pixels contained within the outline are shown in the image
window. The finished effect actually looks like a knock-out.
This may seem a bit counterintuitive because the matting layer is on the
bottom (it would make more sense if this layer were above, right?), but
after you’ve used clipping masks a couple of times, it will seem natural.
This technique shows you how to create clipping masks. You can use any
kind of shape for the masking layer, including type. First, you create a clip-
ping mask by using a shape on a layer to define the clipped area, and then
you create a clipping mask with type to define the clipped area.
Creating a clipping mask is easier than it may seem in the steps that fol-
low. After you’ve created a few clipping masks, you’ll see how it works
and get the hang of it. What other ways can you think of to incorporate
clipping masks into your projects?
You need to know one thing when using a shape to clip the other
layers in the clipping mask: The area around the shape outline needs
to be transparent. So as you follow the steps, notice how the area
around the heart is transparent. If it were filled, the clipping mask
effect wouldn’t work because the other layers wouldn’t be clipped.
(This transparency issue doesn’t apply when a type layer is used to
clip the other layers.)

then press Ctrl+G/Ô+G again.
Continue adding as many layers as you want.
You can remove a layer from a clipping mask by
choosing Layer➪Release Clipping Mask.
Using a Shape to Define 
Your Knock-Out
Here’s how to use a shape to define the knock-out:
1.
Open a multi-layered image.
For this example, I’m using a heart shape as the
lower clipping layer and a photograph of tulips for
the upper layer, as shown in Figure 51-1. Notice
that the area around the heart is transparent. This
is represented by the checkerboard pattern in the
Heart layer thumbnail.
Layers joined together in the clipping mask
must be listed consecutively in the Layers
palette.
• Figure 51-1: To create a clipping mask, you need at least
two layers.
2.
Click the upper layer to select it.
3.
Press Ctrl+G/Ô+G or choose Layer➪Create
Clipping Mask.
The two layers are combined into a clipping
mask, as shown in Figure 51-2. Notice that in the
Layers palette the upper layer in the clipping
mask is indented and a tiny down-pointing arrow
points to the layer below.

Using Type to Define Your Knock-Out
313
Even though layers are combined in a clipping
mask, you can still select the lower layer in the
clipping mask and apply layer styles, as shown
in Figure 51-3.
• Figure 51-3: Applying layer styles to the lower layer in
the clipping mask can add a finishing touch.
Using Type to Define 
Your Knock-Out
Here’s how to use a type layer to define the 
knock-out:
1.
Open an image that you want to use in a 
clipping mask.
2.
Use the Horizontal Type tool to create some
type.
It doesn’t matter what color the type is. For this
example, I’m using type set in Lithograph Bold at
90 points, as shown in Figure 51-4.
• Figure 51-4: Create the type that you want to use as the
mask when the layers are grouped together.
3.
In the Layers palette, move the type layer
below the image layer, as shown in Figure 51-5.

Because the type is still contained on a type
layer, you can always edit it and apply layer
styles.

image layer in a clipping mask, the type acts
as a cut-out.

Working with
Channels
M
any folks who use Photoshop think that channels are somehow
mysterious, dangerous, and not for them. You may not know it,
but you use channels all the time. Here’s a secret: Even though
Photoshop can create gorgeous, rich colors in fabulous images, those
colors are actually created by using grayscale pixels in channels.
“What?!” you exclaim. It’s true.
Depending on the color mode that an image is set in, each pixel in an
image can contain up to four grayscale color channels — channels that
contain the information that colors images. Any selections or masks that
you create are saved as alpha channels.
Often forgotten, many times ignored, channels can give you more control
over your image editing. This technique focuses on how channels work,
where you can find them, and how you can use them to improve your
images. So, if you’re ready for a mind-expanding session that will definitely
increase your knowledge of Photoshop and its capabilities, check out
channels. They’re worth the time!
Understanding Channels
Three types of channels can store information in Photoshop. Color channels
contain the color information for an image, alpha channels store masks
or selections that are used to edit parts of an image, and spot color chan-
nels store ink color information for high-end color printing. (You can find
out how to create and use spot color channels in Technique 14.)
Color channels
Color channels are actually grayscale images that store specific color
information. Each channel can contain up to 256 shades of gray — black
and white are at the opposite ends of this grayscale spectrum. Channels
can be viewed with the Channels palette, which is shown in Figure 52-1.

are listed first along with a composite color channel
that shows all the color channels mixed together.

Using the Channels Palette
317
Every pixel in an image can contain up to four color
channels depending on the color mode that the
image is set in.
By default, color channels are viewed in grayscale in
Photoshop. For an experiment, you can take a look
at the color channels in their respective color by
choosing Edit/Photoshop➪Preferences➪Display &
Cursors, and then selecting the Color Channels in
Color check box in the Preferences dialog box.
Viewing the channels in color can be educa-
tional. However, when you’re finished check-
ing them out in color, be sure to return them
to the default grayscale. If you apply any filters
or tonal adjustments to individual channels, it
can be very hard to see the effects when the
channels are shown in color.
You may be wondering how a grayscale image fits
into this channel scheme. Any image with less than
256 colors is displayed as a single channel. So, a
grayscale image contains only one channel.
Table 52-1 shows how many channels exist per color
mode.
TABLE 52-1: HOW MANY CHANNELS IN A COLOR MODE?
One Channel
Three Channels
Four Channels
Bitmap
RGB
CMYK
Grayscale
LAB
Duotone
Multichannel
Indexed Color
Multichannel mode is a bit of an oddball because it
can have from one to four channels depending on
the color mode conversion. If an RGB image is con-
verted to Multichannel mode, it still has three chan-
nels. A CMYK image that’s converted to Multichannel
mode still has four channels. Likewise, when a color
channel is deleted from an RGB or CMYK image, the
image is automatically converted to Multichannel
mode.
Alpha channels
Just like color channels that store the color informa-
tion for an image, alpha channels are also grayscale
images. However, alpha channels are used to store
layer masks or selections. They’re located at the
bottom of the list in the Channels palette. (Refer to
Figure 52-1.)
You can view an alpha channel at any time in two
ways: as an overlay superimposed on the image or
load it as a selection.
Saving a complicated selection as an alpha
channel is so handy. You can always reload
the selection in an instant instead of having
to create it from scratch.
Using any shade from the grayscale spectrum
(including black and white), you can paint on an
alpha channel to enlarge or reduce the protected
(selected or masked) areas. (If you want to find out
how to work with and edit layer masks, turn to
Technique 49.)
Using the Channels Palette
You can apply any filters or tonal adjustments to
individual channels. What does this mean for you?
You get super control over the various color ele-
ments in an image. In fact, many filters work better
when they’re applied to each channel individually,
instead of to all the channels at the same time as a
composite image. (Technique 53 delves into this
interesting topic.)
If you’ve never really used the Channels palette
before, the following list can give you an idea of (and
the directions for!) working with the channels in the
Channels palette:

Technique 52: Working with Channels
318

Create a copy of a channel by right-
clicking/Control+clicking the channel and then
choosing Duplicate Channel from the menu. In
the Duplicate Channel dialog box that opens,
enter a name for the copy and choose whether it
appears in the image that it was copied from or
as a new image.

Delete a channel by dragging it to the trashcan
icon at the bottom of the palette. If you delete a
color channel, the image automatically converts
to Multichannel mode. Multichannel mode is typ-
ically used for specialized offset printing.

Select an individual channel by clicking the
channel’s name. When a channel is active, you
can apply tonal adjustments such as levels or
curves, or filters effects to the individual 
channel.

Select more than one channel at a time by hold-
ing down the Shift key and clicking the channels’
names.

Hide a specific channel by clicking the eye icon
in the column to the left of the channel. View the
channel again by clicking in the column.

Rename an alpha channel by double-clicking
the alpha channel’s name and typing a new
name. (Color channels cannot be renamed.)

53
Individual Channel
Adjustments
S
ometimes adjusting the tone or color in an image just doesn’t seem
to work no matter what you do. In many such cases, if you tackle
each channel individually (instead of applying the adjustment to all
the channels at the same time), you can achieve superior results. The
same goes for filters: Applying filters channel by channel can create a
sharper overall image with much cleaner results.
This technique shows you how to improve images by modifying channels
individually. You find out what typically needs to be adjusted when tone
or color is off. Also, I show you the difference that applying a filter to
each channel can make.
I’ve got one more tantalizing treat for this technique: Because you can
apply adjustments and filters to channels individually, why not try creat-
ing some interesting effects by modifying only one channel (instead of all
of them)? You may be surprised at the cool looks that you achieve when
you quickly apply a filter to just one channel.
Performing Individual Channel Adjustments
Suppose that your Aunt Marge hands you a disk containing a digital pho-
tograph of your cousin Eddy, and she asks you to pretty it up for a holi-
day card. Because Aunt Marge is a nice lady and also has included you in
her multi-million dollar will, you say, “Sure, no problem.” You take the file
home (how hard can this be?), open it in Photoshop and find . . . a mess.
The photo has too much blue, the flash created some nasty reflections
that make highlighted areas look white hot, and little Eddy’s nose looks a
bit like a squashed tomato.
So you get to work trying to adjust the tone by using Levels, apply the
Unsharp mask in an attempt to add definition to Eddy’s nose, and even
try adjusting the image by using the Brightness/Contrast command
(always a mistake — that command has wrecked more images than it
ever helped). You start to get a bit nervous because sharpening the nose
also added to the white hot highlight mess, and even though the blue is
out of the photo, Eddy’s skin has taken on a sun-burnt hue. You don’t
want to get written out of Aunt Marge’s will, so what can you do?

Technique 53: Individual Channel Adjustments
320
• Figure 53-1: An interesting photograph of the Brooklyn
Bridge needs some adjustments.
If I apply Levels to all the channels at once (the com-
posite), the best results that I can get without over-
brightening the highlights are shown in Figure 53-2.
To my eye, the photograph looks a bit washed out
and it doesn’t have enough definition.
I went back to the starting board and adjusted the
Levels of each channel individually. After fiddling for
only five minutes, I was able to adjust the shadows
and add the definition that I was looking for. As
shown in Figure 53-3, the texture of the footpath has
more definition and the bridge columns aren’t lost in
the background anymore.
So anytime that you’re looking at a photograph and
it just doesn’t have the clear quality that you want,
the colors are dull, or overall it looks washed out,
try adjusting each channel individually. You may be
surprised at the great results that you get.
Upon reflection (and some serious use of the History
palette to undo all the previous attempts at correc-
tion) you think to yourself, “Hmm, too much blue,
what about the Blue channel?” That leads you to take
a look at the Blue channel in the Channels palette.
You find that the Blue channel looks horrible — the
edges aren’t sharp, some odd pixels are hanging
around, and overall it’s way too dark. (This is a
typical result when photographs are taken with 
lower-end digital cameras.)
You start adjusting the photograph channel by chan-
nel, and voilà! Little Eddy’s picture (and your place
in Aunt Marge’s will) is restored.
Adjusting the channels individually in an image gives
you several advantages:

If a particular tonal area is off (for instance, the
blue mentioned in the Aunt Marge story), you
can target the problem color by using a specific
channel — there’s no need to correct the Red
and Green channels when the Blue channel is off.

Adjustments are more precise because you cor-
rect each channel’s problem individually, not the
collective problems of the combined channels,
which are different.

You control how the tonal values mix when the
image is viewed with its composite channels. You
can adjust the colors that you think need correc-
tion (instead of letting Photoshop do this for you
automatically, which can lead to poor results).
The color and tonal adjustments commands (found
on the Image➪Adjustments menu) that you can
apply to individual channels include Levels, Curves,
Brightness/Contrast, Shadows/Highlights, and all the
one shot tonal commands: Invert, Equalize,
Threshold, and Posterize.
For example, Figure 53-1 is an interesting photo-
graph of the Brooklyn Bridge. The photograph is
way too dark — the bridge columns in the back-
ground are almost indistinguishable from the shad-
ows, and the sky looks murky.

Filtering Individual Channels
321
• Figure 53-2: Although the Levels adjustment helps, it
doesn’t add enough definition.
• Figure 53-3: Applying Levels to each individual channel
adds the definition that I’m looking for.
Filtering Individual Channels
If you need to apply a filter to an image (for instance
the Unsharp Mask filter), and the correction that you
are going to make is very slight, you may want to try
applying the filter to each channel individually. This
can give you more precise and satisfactory results.
For an example, I’m using this great photograph of a
Manhattan office building under construction, shown
in Figure 53-4. As you look at the photograph, notice
how it looks a bit blurry. The edges can really use a
good sharpening.
• Figure 53-4: This photograph looks a little blurry.

Technique 53: Individual Channel Adjustments
322
• Figure 53-6: Applying the Unsharp Mask to each channel
really sharpens the photograph.
You can also create some really cool effects by
applying a filter to only one channel. Take a look at
Figures 53-7 and 53-8. In each figure, the upper image
shows the filter applied to the entire photograph. In
the lower image, the same filter has been applied to
only one channel.
After applying the Unsharp Mask filter to all the
channels at once, Figure 53-5 shows the best results
that I can get. (You may have to look closely because
these filter corrections are very slight.)
• Figure 53-5: The photograph is better, but it’s not good
enough.
So instead of sharpening all the channels at once, 
I turned to applying the Unsharp Mask filter to each
channel individually. Figure 53-6 shows the great
results with sharp edges.

Technique
Mixing Color with
Channels
I
f you ever wanted to recolor an image but found that you lost detail
when using the Photo Filter, Gradient Map, or Hue/Saturation com-
mands, recoloring an image by using channels may work for you.
This technique focuses on recoloring images by using two channel
methods. First, you swap channel information by copying and pasting
from one channel to another. Although the results of this method can
be unpredictable, they can also be excellent — a true case of “you never
know until you try.” Details are preserved as some colors are pumped up
and other colors are toned down. The second method involves changing
how the channels blend together by using the Channel Mixer command.
The Channel Mixer adjusts the output of each channel by making the
grayscale image in a channel whiter or blacker. The whiter a channel is,
the more output color from that channel.
Recoloring images by using channels is really unpredictable. The results
can be wild or subtle depending on how much adjustment you make. If
other methods of recoloring haven’t worked to your satisfaction, give
channels a try. You may be surprised at the great results. Take a look at
Color Plate 54-1 to see the effects — in color — of channel swapping and
channel mixing.
Swapping Channels
You can use a fantastic channel technique to recolor an image: Simply
swap the contents of the color channels. It works by literally copying and
pasting the contents of one color channel to another. Open an image and
experiment with this. Some of the results may be wild, but others may be
downright lovely.
The following directions swap the contents of the Red and Green chan-
nels, but you can exchange any combination:

Swapping Channels
325
1.
Open the image that you want to recolor.
For this example, I’m using the photograph of a
white peacock, shown in Figure 54-1.
• Figure 54-1: This white peacock is going to have his
feathers recolored.
2.
In the Channels palette right-click/Control+click
the Red channel and choose Duplicate Channel
from the menu.
3.
Click OK in the Duplicate Channel dialog box
that opens.
A duplicate of the Red channel, named Red Copy,
appears at the bottom of the Channels palette.
4.
In the Channels palette right-click/Control+click
the Green channel and choose Duplicate
Channel from the menu.
5.
Click OK in the Duplicate Channel dialog box
that opens.
A duplicate of the Green channel, named Green
Copy, appears at the bottom of the Channels
palette. You should now have two duplicated
channels, as shown in Figure 54-2.
6.
Select the Red Copy channel in the Channels
palette.
7.
Choose Select➪All or press Ctrl+A/Ô+A.
• Figure 54-2: You should have two copied channels at the
bottom of the Channels palette.
8.
Choose Edit➪Copy or press Ctrl+C/Ô+C.
9.
Select the Green channel in the Channels
palette.
10.
Choose Edit➪Paste or press Ctrl+V/Ô+V.
This copies the contents of the Red Copy chan-
nel to the Green channel.
11.
Select the Green Copy channel in the Channels
palette.
12.
Choose Select➪All or press Ctrl+A/Ô+A.
13.
Choose Edit➪Copy or press Ctrl+C/Ô+C.
14.
Select the Red channel in the Channels palette.
15.
Choose Edit➪Paste or press Ctrl+V/Ô+V.
This copies the contents of the Green Copy chan-
nel to the Red channel. You’ve now swapped the
contents of the Red and Green channels. How did
the colors change in your image? In the peacock
photograph, the peacock’s feathers changed to a
bright violet.

Technique 54: Mixing Color with Channels
326
• Figure 54-3: Use the sliders in the Channel Mixer dialog
box to recolor an image.
4.
Use the Output Channel drop-down list to select
the channel that you want to adjust.
5.
In the Source Channels area, use the sliders to
adjust the blend of the channels and recolor
the image to get the results that you need.
Notice that when one color channel (say, Red) is
selected in the Output Channel drop-down list,
that color is set to 100%, and the other two col-
ors (for this example, Blue and Green) are set 
to 0%.
6.
When you’re finished adjusting the color 
of your image, click OK to close the Channel
Mixer dialog box and apply the color 
modifications.
You can also use the Channel Mixer to create
fine grayscale images. With the Channel Mixer
dialog box open, select the Monochrome
check box to convert the image to grayscale.
Then, use the sliders to adjust the amount of
detail and contrast in the image.
You can see the results of some channel swapping in
Color Plate 54-1.
Working with the Channel Mixer
By adjusting channel output with the Channel Mixer
command, you can quickly recolor an image without
losing any detail.
The Channel Mixer command can be used in two
ways. It can be applied directly to a layer by choos-
ing Image➪Adjustments➪Channel Mixer or it can be
applied as an adjustment layer. Adjustment layers
don’t permanently change a layer’s pixels and are
very flexible. For instance, you can always come
back later and adjust the Channel Mixer settings if
you need to. When I have the choice, I always use an
adjustment layer. (Turn to Technique 22 to find out
more about adjustment layers.)
Here’s how to use the Channel Mixer:
1.
In the Layers palette, select the layer that you
want to recolor.
2.
Make sure that the composite color channel is
selected in the Channels palette.
3.
Apply the Channel Mixer command by using an
adjustment layer. At the bottom of the Layers
palette, click the Create New Fill or Adjustment
Layer button and choose Channel Mixer from
the menu.
or
Apply the Channel Mixer command to the
selected layer. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Channel Mixer.
The Channel Mixer dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 54-3. Notice the Output Channel drop-down
list at the top of the dialog box. This is where you
select the channel that you want to modify. The
sliders adjust the brightness of the grayscale
image in each channel. Higher settings make a
channel lighter and whiter; lower settings make
a channel darker and blacker.

Getting to Know
ImageReady
I
mageReady, Photoshop’s sister program, is the place to go when you
want to create and save Web graphics. With the introduction of the
Creative Suite, ImageReady CS and Photoshop CS are much more tightly
integrated than before. You can create graphics in Photoshop, jump to
ImageReady to get them ready for the Web, and jump back to Photoshop
for any last minute touch-ups.
This technique is a quick introduction to ImageReady. You find out about
the program interface, along with available tools and palettes. Then, I show
you how to preview your graphics in ImageReady or a browser to see how
they look in the environment in which you’ll really use them. Finally, you
take a look at saving your Web graphics with the best balance between
small file size and good visual quality. 
If you’ve never used ImageReady before or you need a refresher, take a
look at this technique before moving on to the other Web techniques in
this part. After you’re acclimated, you’ll be creating super Web graphics
in no time!
Looking at the Program Window
Launch ImageReady and take a look around the program environment.
The ImageReady program environment is organized just like the
Photoshop environment. You find a Menu bar and Options bar at the top
of the screen, the Toolbox is on the left side, and palettes are located on
the right side. Figure 55-1 shows the ImageReady environment with the
various items labeled for quick reference.

As you expect, just as in Photoshop, any time a tool
is selected in ImageReady, the Options bar changes

Tear-off toolbars
A super feature of the ImageReady toolbar is the
ability to tear off toolbars from the Toolbox. If you
open a fly-out menu on the ImageReady toolbar, you
notice that a tiny downward-pointing arrow is at the
bottom of the fly-out, as shown in Figure 55-3.
• Figure 55-3: In ImageReady you can tear off the Toolbox
fly-out menus to create mini-toolbars.
If you drag the mouse down over that arrow, and
then release the mouse button, a mini-toolbar con-
taining the tools of the fly-out menu appears. You
can drag the mini-toolbar anywhere you need it in
the program window. When you finish with the
mini-toolbar, just click the Close button to make it
disappear.
Release mouse here
Jumping back and forth between ImageReady
and Photoshop
When you’re working on Web graphics, you can
leave both Photoshop and ImageReady open. That
way, you can quickly jump back and forth, making
changes to the same open file.
To jump between the programs, just click the Jump
To button at the bottom of the Toolbox, or select
File➪Edit in Photoshop or File➪Edit in ImageReady
(depending upon the program you’re using).
When you jump to Photoshop from ImageReady,
perform some edits, then jump back to ImageReady,
the Photoshop edits are shown in the ImageReady
History palette as a history state named “Update
from Photoshop.” Likewise, when you jump to
Photoshop, any changes made in ImageReady are
listed in Photoshop’s History palette as “Update
from ImageReady.” Because these “Updates” are
history states, you can undo them at any time by
selecting an earlier history state.
Picking Palettes
ImageReady contains several palettes that you
already use in Photoshop, including the Layers,
Swatches, Colors, and History palettes (just to name
a few). These palettes work, of course, just like they
do in Photoshop. So, if you’re unsure of any palette,
turn to the appropriate technique in this book that
covers it.
ImageReady also includes several Web graphic
palettes that are used to create animations, manage
image maps and slices, and optimize file size and
quality. Figure 55-4 shows some of the ImageReady
palettes that you’ll be using in the Web techniques
included in this part.

Technique 55: Getting to Know ImageReady
332
Previewing Your Graphics
ImageReady provides several features you can use
to view file size, estimated download time, and pre-
view what an image will look like if it’s saved in a
specific way.
You can access these features using either the Status
bar at the bottom of the image window or the Pre-
view tabs at the top of the image window.
Viewing image size and download times
If you’ve ever surfed to a Web site and found your-
self going nuts waiting for images to appear (also
called build) on-screen, then you have an idea of how
important managing image file size and figuring out
how long images will take to load is.
Using ImageReady’s Status bar, you can find out
estimated times based on file size and connection
speeds. Figure 55-5 shows two slots on the Status
bar that you can use to view image size and down-
load times. You can use these slots to compare two
possible download scenarios and see how long each
image takes to load depending upon the connection
speed.
Using ImageReady previews
At the top of the ImageReady image window are four
tabs: Original, Optimized, 2-Up, and 4-Up. These tabs
show different views of the Web graphic you’re work-
ing on, as shown in Figure 55-6.
Here’s a quick look at what the tabs do:

The Original tab displays the image without any
optimization. Optimization is the process that
saves files with specific file sizes and formats.

The Optimized tab shows the image using the
current settings in the Optimize palette. The
Optimized preview updates every time a setting
on the Optimize palette changes. To find out
more about optimizing files and using the
Optimize palette, turn to Technique 57.
• Figure 55-4: These palettes are just for working with
Web graphics.

The 2-Up tab displays two versions of an image.

would view if you selected the Original tab. The

would see if you selected the Optimized tab.

The 4-Up tab shows the original image, an opti-
mized image based on the settings in the
Optimize palette, and two other previews based
on setting variations from the Optimize palette.
Previewing your graphics in a browser
You can preview your Web graphics right from Image-
Ready. You can check out image maps, rollovers, or any
animations that you create to make sure that they’re
working without leaving ImageReady. Previewing your
images is great for checking out things and making any
necessary adjustments.

Previewing graphics
After you add all the browsers you want to use to
the Browser List, previewing your graphics in a
browser is easy. Simply click the Preview in Default
Browser button in the ImageReady Toolbox. 
To view a graphic in another browser, click the tiny
arrow next to the Preview in Default Browser button
and select a browser from the fly-out menu, as
shown in Figure 55-8.
At the bottom of the browser fly-out menu in
Figure 55-8 is a tiny downward-pointing arrow.
Drag your mouse over the arrow, and then
release the mouse button to create a mini-
browser toolbar. You can use this mini-toolbar
for quick previews in different browsers.
• Figure 55-8: Choose a browser from the fly-out menu.
Adding browsers
When you launch ImageReady for the first time,
ImageReady finds the default browser installed on
your computer and uses this browser to generate
the preview. But, if you want to view your graphics
in other browsers to see how they look (and they
can look quite different from browser to browser),
you need to add the browsers to the Browser List.
Here’s how:
1.
Choose File➪Preview In➪Edit Browser List.
The Edit Browser List dialog box opens (shown
in Figure 55-7).

Slicing Web
Graphics
S
lices are a really important part of creating Web graphics using
ImageReady. You can use slices to speed up image load time, 
create image maps, and other fancy graphics such as rollovers 
and animations.
This technique tells you about the kinds of slices that you can create in
ImageReady. Then I show you how to create slices manually, using layers
or guides, and even automatically. From there, you find out how to convert
slices, divide them, assign Web addresses to them, and even delete them.
If you want to create great Web graphics, start slicing up your images
because slices are the springboard from which most Web graphics are
made.
I’ll Take a Slice
A slice of pizza, a slice of cherry pie, a slice of life — a lot of slices are out
there. The type of slice that ImageReady and Photoshop creates is a
mechanism for dividing up graphics for the Web.
Depending upon what you’re going to do with an image, dividing it into
slices has different benefits and uses. Some of the ways you can use
slices include the following:

Speeding up load time: By dividing a large image into many smaller
sections, a graphic is processed by browsers as many small images
instead of one huge one. Slices can let you put large images on the Web
without making folks who visit your Web page wait too long.

Creating image maps: Image maps allow users to click an area of an
image and be transported to another specified Web location. (Take a
look at Technique 58 to find out how to create image maps.)

several ways:

Generate slices using guides
When you finish slicing an image and you want
to publish it to the Web, save the image using
the optimization directions in Technique 57.
Then, upload the image and associated HTML
file that ImageReady creates to your Web serv-
ice provider. This HTML file contains the code
that slices the image. If you don’t upload the
HTML file, your image won’t be sliced.


Creating rollovers: Rollovers are areas of a Web
page that change when the mouse passes over
them or performs an action such as clicking.
(Technique 59 shows you how to create
rollovers.)

Creating animated GIFs: If you surf the Web, no
doubt you’ve seen some type of animation — a
penguin hops across the Web page, a volcano
appears to blow up — you can create animations
using ImageReady. (Turn to Technique 60 to find
out how to make animated GIFs.)
Slices are really an integral part of creating many
types of Web graphics using ImageReady.
You can create three different types of slices: user
slices, auto slices, and layer-based slices. User slices
are created manually using the Slice tool. Layer-based
slices are created by using (what else?) layers. And,
auto slices are the left over areas that Photoshop or
ImageReady automatically turn into slices when user
or layer-based slices are created. If an area isn’t
included in a user or layer-based slice, it is auto-
matically turned into one or more auto slices.
You can create, select, and edit slices in
Photoshop, but ImageReady offers more slice
options. Thus, creating and managing slices in
ImageReady is usually best. But, if you do use
the Slice tool in Photoshop to create slices, you
can jump to ImageReady and be assured that
all slices and slice settings are preserved.
Figure 56-1 shows the three different types of slices
in use. Notice that each slice is numbered and has a
special icon marking it as a user slice, auto slice, or
layer-based slice.

Automatically creating slices
Automatically creating slices works especially well if
you have a large image that you want to slice up for
quicker downloading in Web pages. Using this method,
you specify how many vertical and/or horizontal slices
you want, and ImageReady does the work for you.
Here’s how:
1.
Open the image to which you want to add slices
in ImageReady.
2.
Choose Slices➪Divide Slice.
The Divide Slice dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 56-2.
• Figure 56-2: Use the Divide Slice dialog box to create
horizontal and/or vertical slices.
3.
Select the Divide Horizontally Into check box if
you want to create horizontal slices.
If you select this option, enter the desired num-
ber of horizontal slices in the Slices Down,
Evenly Spaced text box, or enter a pixel value in
the Pixels Per Slice text box. When you enter a
value in either text box, the horizontal slices
appear as a preview in the image window.
4.
Select the Divide Vertically Into check box if
you want to create vertical slices.
If you select this option, enter the desired num-
ber of vertical slices in the Slices Across, Evenly
Spaced text box, or enter a pixel value in the
Pixels Per Slice text box.
5.
Click OK.
A user slice label appears in the upper-left corner
of each slice, as shown in Figure 56-3.
• Figure 56-3: The number of vertical and horizontal slices
you entered appears in the image window.
After creating slices using the Divide Slice dia-
log box, all the slices are selected. To select
only one slice, choose the Slice Select tool in
the Toolbox, and then click the slice you want
to select. You can then reshape the slice, if
necessary, or assign a URL to the slice, which I
describe in “Working with Slices.”
Manually slicing an image
The Slice tool works just like the Rectangular Marquee
tool in Photoshop. Drag the tool to enclose a rectangu-
lar area to create a slice (instead of a selection). As
you create user slices, ImageReady automatically
generates auto slices, dividing up the leftover area.
1.
Open the image to which you want to add slices
in ImageReady.
2.
Select the Slice tool from the Toolbox.
3.
Position the mouse where you want to start the
slice, press the mouse button, and then drag
diagonally to create the slice.

Technique 56: Slicing Web Graphics
338
Working with Slices
After you create slices, you can resize them, link them
together, align and distribute them, put them into
slice sets, and much more. Also, you can optimize
individual slices based on the needs of the image
contained within the slice. For instance, one slice on
a Web page could contain a photograph optimized as
a JPEG. Another slice on the same Web page could
contain an animated figure optimized in that file for-
mat. (Turn to Technique 57 to find directions.)
Here’s a kitchen sink list of things you can do with
slices:

Convert an auto slice or layer-based slice into a
user slice: Choose the Slice Select tool from the
Toolbox and select the slice you want to convert
in the image window. Then, choose Slices➪
Promote to User Slice.

Combine auto slices and/or user slices into a
larger user slice: Select two or more slices in the
image window using the Slice Select tool, and
then choose Slices➪Combine Slices.

Resize a user slice: Select the Slice Select tool
from the Toolbox, select the slice in the image win-
dow, and then drag the slice boundary handles.

Optimize a slice in a specific file format: Use
the Slice Select tool to select the slice in the
image window; then use the Optimize palette to
select optimization settings. Turn to Technique
57 for more about optimization.

Copy optimization settings from one slice to
another: Use the Slice Select tool to select the
slice whose optimization settings you want to
copy, and then drag the Create Droplet button
from the Optimization palette onto the slice you
want to copy the settings to. Take a look at
Technique 57 for details.

Link slices together for optimization: Use the
Slice Select tool to select a slice in the image
window. Then, Shift+click to select other slices
that you want to link together. Choose Slices➪
Link Slices for Optimization.
When you release the mouse button, a numbered
user slice label appears in the upper-left corner
of the slice.
4.
Continue to create as many slices as you need.
If you need to divide an auto slice or user slice
into smaller slices, select the slice using the Slice
Select tool, and then choose Slices➪Divide Slice.
Use the Divide Slice dialog box to set the num-
ber of slices, and then click OK. 
Creating slices using layers
A layer-based slice contains all the visible pixels on
a layer. If you modify the layer in some way (move,
transform, add layer effects to the layer, and so on)
then the layer-based slice automatically resizes to
include any new pixels. Layer-based slices work very
well for creating rollovers that contain effects, such
as a drop shadow, which may increase layer size.
(Technique 59 shows you how to create rollovers.)
To create a layer-based slice, select the layer you
want to turn into a slice in the Layers palette in
ImageReady, and then choose Layer➪New Layer
Based Slice.
Generating slices using guides
Using guides to create slices lets you plot out
where the slices are before you create them. Be a
bit cautious when creating slices using this method,
however, because any slices you previously created
are deleted.
1.
Open the image you want to add slices to in
ImageReady.
2.
Choose View➪Rulers or press Ctrl+R/Ô+R to
display the rulers.
3.
Drag guides from the rulers into the positions
you want to use for the edges of the slices.
4.
Choose Slices➪Create Slices from Guides.

Working with Slices
339

Unlink slices: Use the Slice Select tool to select
the linked slice you want to unlink, and then
choose Slices➪Unlink Slice.

Assign a URL to a slice: Use the Slice Select tool
to select the slice in the image window, and then
enter a Web address in the URL text box in the
Slice palette, as shown in Figure 56-4. When the
slice loads on a Web page, any user who clicks
the slice is redirected to that Web address.

Align slices: Select the slices you want to line up
using the Slice Select tool, and then click one of
the alignment buttons on the Options bar. You
can align slices vertically by their upper or lower
edges or centers, or horizontally by their left or
right edges or centers. When you align slices,
only the slices move, not the images inside them.

Distribute slices: Select the slices you want to
distribute using the Slice Select tool, and then
click one of the distribution buttons on the
Options bar.

Delete a slice: Select the slice by using the
Slice Select tool, and then choose Slices➪ 
Delete Slice. This command deletes only the
slice, not the image inside the slice.
• Figure 56-4: In the Slice palette, type a Web address in
the URL text box.

Optimizing and
Saving Images 
for the Web
W
hen you create an image that you want to save for the Web, you
need to keep several key issues in mind: image dimensions, the
number of colors that an image has (including the image’s color
depth), and the file format that the image is saved in.
Working with each of these is like balancing on a tightrope. (Well, maybe
it’s not quite that perilous.) When dealing with the number of colors in an
image and color depth, there’s a balance between reducing the number
of colors (thus reducing the file size) and maintaining image quality. When
considering what file format you should use for an image, remember that
not all file types are created equal. The GIF file format is great for saving
animations; JPEG is great for saving photographs, but loses a bit of image
data each time it’s saved; and the PNG file format can handle transparency
like a GIF file and can save photographs like a JPEG, but it doesn’t com-
press as much.
This balancing act is called optimization, which basically translates to get-
ting as much visual quality as you can out of as little file size as possible.
What’s a Web graphic artist to do? ImageReady can help you make the
right choice when saving graphics for the Web and even lets you preview
the image before saving.
This technique discusses the ins and outs of saving Web graphics —
what’s important, what’s not, and how to squeeze an extra smidgen of
image quality out of the last compressed file bit. You find out what type
of file format works with what kind of image and how to use these for-
mats to create great quality graphics. Then, you find out exactly how to
optimize and save your Web images.
Web Graphics Considerations
When creating an image for the Web, I use a basic formula:

features that Photoshop has to offer.

2.
Save the image in Photoshop. (Who wants to lose
work?)
3.
Jump to ImageReady and create any special 
animations or effects that you need.
4.
Save the image for Web output by using the
Optimize palette settings.
So, when I create an image for the Web, I keep a cou-
ple things in mind: What dimensions should I make
the image, how few colors can I get away with
(before the image quality starts degrading), and in
which Web file format is it best to save the image?
Image size
The first consideration is purely practical and based
on real world measurements. What are the maximum
dimensions of the computer screen area? After all,
you don’t want to create a graphic (or a Web page)
that’s too large. If you do, your users have to scroll
around to see it all.
Here’s a formula that you can use to figure out how
large the image area is that you can design for:
View area width ÷ image resolution = Max pixel width
View area height ÷ image resolution = Max pixel height
When selecting view area width and height measure-
ments, use the most common computer monitor 
resolution setting: 800 x 600 pixels. Then consider
that a browser takes up some screen real estate, so
the width and height of the viewing area should be
reduced by about an inch to 720 x 530 pixels.
Graphics created for the Web should be set at 96 ppi.
A higher image resolution just makes for bigger file
size and it doesn’t increase image quality.
Mac monitors view images at 72 ppi, and
Windows monitors view images at 96 ppi.
Creating Web graphics set at 96 ppi lets both
types of monitors view the graphics equally
well and doesn’t increase file size by very
much (only a few bits).
So, if you plug the numbers into the formula:
720 pixels wide ÷ 96 ppi = 7.5 inches wide
530 pixels high ÷ 96 ppi = 5.5 pixels high
So, what does this all mean for you as a Web graph-
ics designer? The most important thing to remember
is that the combined widths and heights of the
design elements on a Web page have to be smaller
than these dimensions. For instance, suppose that
you want to create a navigation bar that runs across
the top of your Web page. From the formula, you
know that the nav bar should be less than 720 pixels
wide (and even smaller than that if you want to cen-
ter the bar and have a bit of space on each end).
Color depth
Color depth (also called bit-depth) sets how much
color information is available in each pixel in an
image. The lower the color depth, the fewer colors
available to the image. Fewer colors and a smaller
color depth translates to reduced file sizes, which
make the Web graphics load faster.
Drastically reducing the number of colors and
the color depth in an image can result in
grainy-looking edges and colors that are less
vibrant. So, when you reduce the number of
colors that an image has, you have to keep in
mind the balance between file size and image
display quality.
You can reduce the number of colors and the color
depth in an image by using the ImageReady Optimize
palette. When reducing the number of colors,
ImageReady lets you see a preview, letting you
decide whether the image quality is good enough
before saving the image. I discuss the Optimize
palette and color reduction in detail in “Optimizing
Web Graphics.”

Technique 57: Optimizing and Saving Images for the Web
342
JPEG file format
The JPEG file format can contain millions of colors.
This format works best with photographs and con-
tinuous tone images that display subtle color
changes such as lighting effects.
You should know about two trade-offs when using
this file format:

The compression formula that the JPEG format
uses can compress a huge file way down. However,
when a JPEG file is loaded into a browser, the file
has to be decompressed, which can take time.

This format uses lossy compression, meaning
that tiny bits of file information are lost every
time a JPEG is opened, edited, saved, and closed
in ImageReady. So, when creating an image for
JPEG format, finish all the editing and save the
file as a PSD or TIFF image. Then create a copy of
the original and save it as a JPEG.
PNG file format
The PNG file format was originally created to replace
the GIF format because of patent disputes. It is actu-
ally an improvement on the old GIF standard, but it
does have a few drawbacks.
Two PNG file formats exist: PNG-8 and PNG-24. PNG-8
can contain up to a maximum of 256 colors, and
PNG-24 can contain millions of colors. In addition,
the PNG format can save transparent pixels. Because
both PNG formats use lossless compression, no data
is lost when images are saved and resaved.
Here’s the downside of the PNG file format:

You can’t save animations in PNG format.

PNG-24 files don’t compress as much as JPEG
files, so the file size is bigger.

The PNG format is supported only by later file
browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and
later, Netscape Navigator 6 and later, and Mac’s
standard browser, Safari.
Dithering and anti-aliasing
The terms that you see used when reducing colors
in an image are dithering and anti-aliasing:

Dithering: Mixes two available colors from an
image’s color palette to create an approximation
of a color that isn’t available in the color palette.
Dithering is used to make images with fewer col-
ors look like they have more colors and shades.

Anti-aliasing: Describes the blending that occurs
between an object’s edges and the background in
an image. When an image is anti-aliased, increas-
ingly transparent pixels are added to edges to
help smooth transitions.
Web-safe colors
ImageReady and Photoshop offer a Web Safe Color
palette that’s made up of the 216 colors that Windows
and Mac browsers have in common. When selecting
colors for a Web graphic, I surely recommend using
this palette. That way, your graphics end up looking
just as colorful in a browser as they did when you
designed them.
Loading the Web Safe Color palette is easy: In either
Photoshop or ImageReady, choose Window➪Swatches
to open the Swatches palette. Open the Swatches
palette menu and choose Web Safe Colors.
Web file formats and compression
Three Web graphic file formats exist: GIF, JPEG, and
PNG. Each format uses a mathematical compression
formula to reduce the file size of an image and make
it load faster on the Web.
GIF file format
The GIF file format can contain up to 256 colors. 
This format is best for high-contrast images with
sharp edges including type. The GIF file format is
used to retain transparency and save animations.
(Turn to Technique 60 to find out how to create GIF
animations. Fun!)

Optimizing Web Graphics
343
Optimizing Web Graphics
The ImageReady Optimize palette lets you select
from an array of Web file formats and settings to suit
the needs of your Web projects. Using the Optimize
palette, you can compare different optimized ver-
sions of an image side-by-side to maximize display
quality while minimizing file size.
Save for Web command
Photoshop does offer the File➪Save for Web com-
mand, which uses a slightly stripped-down version
of the Optimize palette in ImageReady. Because
you’re saving an image for the Web, I really recom-
mend using the full features that the Optimize
palette has to offer in ImageReady. Also, working in
ImageReady has the fringe benefit of all those great
Web tools and features.
Optimizing a GIF
The steps in this section walk you through optimizing
an image in the GIF file format with the ImageReady
Optimize palette:
1.
Open the image that you want to optimize and
save in ImageReady.
2.
Choose Window➪Optimize to view the
Optimize palette, as shown in Figure 57-1.
Take a few seconds to look over the Optimize
palette. It’s packed with settings!
3.
Click the 2-Up tab in the image window, as
shown in Figure 57-2.
This view displays the original image on the left,
and the preview of the optimized image on the
right. As you select optimization settings, the
optimized preview changes to reflect the settings
that you’ve selected.
4.
Use the Preset drop-down list to select an opti-
mized GIF preset combination.
Figure 57-1: The Optimize palette contains optimized
presets.
Even if you want to select custom settings, start
with a preset combination to get you going.
If you like the preset as it is, stop here and move
on to the later section “Saving Your Graphics.”
To select custom settings, continue with Step 5.
5.
Use the Reduction drop-down list to select a
color reduction method.

In addition, you can increase the amount of
dithering by using the Amount slider in the
Dither area.
7.
Select the Transparency check box to preserve
any transparent pixels in the image.
If Transparency is left unchecked, any transpar-
ent pixels are colored with the currently selected
Matte color. You can select a Matte color in the
next step, if you need to.
8.
Select a Matte color in the Transparency area
to control how partially transparent pixels
along the edge of an image blend with the
background of the Web page.
If you know the color of the Web page’s back-
ground, you can use the Matte drop-down list to
select the color. Other options that you can
select include None, Foreground Color, and
Background Color.
9.
In the Options area, select the Interlaced check
box if you want to display the image in succes-
sively greater detail as it downloads on the
Web page.
You can now save your Web graphic as described
in “Saving Your Graphics.”
Optimizing a JPEG
These steps take you through optimizing an image in
the JPEG file format with the ImageReady Optimize
palette:
1.
Open the image that you want to optimize as a
JPEG in ImageReady.
2.
Choose Window➪Optimize.
The Optimize palette shown in Figure 57-3 opens.
If you haven’t used this palette before, take a look
at it. It has lots of settings, but it helps you to
quickly optimize your image.
3.
Click the 2-Up tab in the image window, as
shown in Figure 57-4.
• Figure 57-2: View your image as a 2-Up so that you can
see the original and optimized versions.
The GIF file format uses mathematical formulas to
reduce the number of colors (and the file size).
Here are the settings that you can choose from:
 Perceptual: Creates a color table based on
the colors in the image and how the eye per-
ceives color.
 Selective: Creates a color table by using the
flat colors and Web-safe colors in the image.
 Adaptive: Creates a color table based on the
part of the color spectrum that contains most
of the colors in the image.
 Restrictive: Creates a color table that shifts
the colors in the image to the 216 standard
Web-safe colors that Windows and Mac Web
browsers have in common.
The Web Snap slider is used to set how wide a
range of colors is automatically set to their Web-
safe equivalents. The higher the percentage, the
more Web-safe colors are used. Higher settings
can result in more dithering and graininess.
6.
Use the Method drop-down list in the Dither
area to select a dithering method.
You can choose from four options: No Dither,
Diffusion, Pattern, or Noise. The Diffusion option
creates the most subtle results. (To find out
more about dithering, turn to “Dithering and anti-
aliasing” earlier in this technique.)

5.
Use the Quality drop-down list to select a com-
pression quality for the optimized image.
You can also use the Amount slider to set the
exact amount of compression.
The higher the Quality setting, the lower the
compression. This means that you end up with
a higher display quality and a larger file size.
Fiddle with the settings to see how low you can
go before the image quality starts to degrade.
6.
In the Transparency area, select a Matte color
to set how partially transparent pixels blend
with the background of the Web page.
The JPEG format doesn’t support transparency,
so if you know the color of the Web page back-
ground, use the Matte drop-down list to select
the color. If the None setting is selected, trans-
parent pixels are automatically colored white.
7.
In the Options area, select the Progressive
check box if you want to display the image in
successively greater detail as it downloads on
the Web page.
You can now save your Web graphic as described
in “Saving Your Graphics,” later in this technique.

Technique 57: Optimizing and Saving Images for the Web
346
Here’s how to create a Droplet:
1.
Use the directions in either “Optimizing a GIF”
or “Optimizing a JPEG,” earlier in this tech-
nique, to select the optimization settings that
you need.
2.
Drag the Droplet icon from the Optimize palette
onto the desktop, as shown in Figure 57-5, or
into a folder window.
Alternatively, you can double-click the Droplet
icon and use the Save Optimized Settings As
Droplet dialog box to enter a name for the Droplet
and select a folder where you want the Droplet to
reside.
The Droplet is now ready for use.
• Figure 57-5: Drag the Droplet from the Optimize palette
onto the desktop.
After you create Droplets, you can use them to opti-
mize individual files or a folder of files. Simply drag
an image file or folder onto the Droplet icon on the
desktop. If ImageReady isn’t running when you use
the Droplet, the Droplet automatically launches
ImageReady and opens the file(s) in the program.
You can also copy optimization settings from one
slice to another. Here’s how:
1.
Select the slice containing the optimization 
settings that you want to copy with the Slice
Select tool.
Optimizing a Web page that contains 
both GIFs and JPEGs
With ImageReady, you can optimize GIFs and JPEGs
separately even if they are contained within the
same Web page.
In order to do this, you must create slices around
the different graphic elements on the Web page,
select the slices that you want to optimize as GIFs or
JPEGs, and then perform the optimization. (To find
out how to create slices, turn to Technique 56.)
1.
Shift+click with the Slice Select tool to select
the slices containing the graphical elements
that you want to optimize.
You should select only slices containing graphic
elements that need to be optimized as GIFs or
only the graphical elements that you want to
optimize as JPEGs. (You can optimize only one
type of graphic at a time.)
2.
If you’re optimizing the selected graphics as
GIFs, turn to the section “Optimizing a GIF,”
earlier in this technique, and follow the direc-
tions. If you’re optimizing the selected graphics
as JPEGs, turn to “Optimizing a JPEG,” earlier
in this technique, and follow the directions.
Working with Droplets
Droplets are handy little mini-programs that you can
quickly create to automate the optimization process.
A Droplet saves the settings that you select in
the Optimization palette. You can then drag an
image or a folder of images over the Droplet
icon in order to apply the optimization settings.
If you need to optimize many Web graphics
with the same optimization settings, Droplets
can be a real timesaver.
Droplets can also be used to quickly copy optimiza-
tion settings from one slice to another.

Saving Your Graphics

2.
In the Optimization palette, drag the Droplet
icon onto the slice to which you want to copy
the settings.
The settings are automatically copied to that slice.
Droplets and platform compatibility
Droplets are cross-platform compatible. Any Droplet cre-
ated on a Mac can be used on a Windows machine and
vice versa. However, a little conversion needs to be per-
formed before a Droplet created on one platform can be

When a Droplet created on a Windows machine is
copied to a Mac, drag the Droplet onto the ImageReady
program icon. ImageReady launches (if it isn’t running
already) and opens a dialog box asking whether you
want to convert it to a Mac Droplet (see the following
figure). Click Yes.

After copying a Droplet created on the Mac to a
Windows machine, rename the Droplet with an .exe
extension. Then, drag the Droplet onto the ImageReady

running) and opens a dialog box asking whether you
want to convert it for Windows use. Click Yes.
Saving Your Graphics
After you optimize your Web graphics, it’s time to
save them and publish them to your Web site.
Here’s how to save Web graphics in ImageReady:
1.
After optimizing your image, choose File➪
Save Optimized As to save the file.
2.
In the Save Optimized As dialog box, enter a
name for the image in the File Name/Save As
text box and select a location where you want
to store the file.
3.
Click Save.
When you save images in ImageReady by
using the File➪Save Optimized As dialog box,
ImageReady also generates HTML files associ-
ated with the image files. These HTML files are
necessary for making Web graphics, such as
rollovers and image maps, work. To find out
more about these HTML files, take a look at
the sidebar “ImageReady and HTML.”
ImageReady and HTML
By default, ImageReady saves HTML files along with
graphic files for the Web. These files contain the HTML and
JavaScript code necessary to make features, such as
rollovers and image maps, work.
When you use the File➪Save Optimized As command in
ImageReady, the program also creates a folder structure
where the image files referenced by the HTML are placed.
By default, the folder for image files is named images. 
Take a look at the structure that ImageReady creates when
you publish these files to a Web site or when you want to
combine the HTML created by ImageReady with your own
HTML code. When you publish image maps and rollovers to
a Web site, you must also upload the accompanying HTML
files. Otherwise, the image maps and rollovers don’t work.
In the Save As Type drop-down list in the Save Optimized As
dialog box, you can tell ImageReady to save only image files
(as opposed to HTML and image files, which is the default).
In addition, you can use the various dialog boxes associated
with the File➪Output Settings command to change the
way that HTML files are saved and named. You can also
use these same dialog boxes to set the names of the folders
where image and HTML files are stored.

Technique
Creating Image
Maps
I
mage maps designate where specially selected areas, or hotspots,
appear on an image in a Web page. Each hotspot is linked to a URL.
When folks browse a Web page that contains an image map, they can
click a hotspot and be redirected to the assigned URL.
ImageReady includes tools and commands that make it easy for you to
create image maps containing hotspots. This technique shows you how
to create image maps with tools that enable you to create hotspots by
hand. Then, you find out how to create image maps with layers.
So grab a Web image and add an image map! This type of Web functionality
is sure to make your Web site more professional and easy to use.
Using Tools to Map Hotspots
Creating an image map with the tools supplied by ImageReady is really
quite simple. The Rectangle Image Map and Circle Image Map tools work
just like the marquee selection tools in Photoshop. And the Polygon
Image Map tool works in a fashion similar to the Pen Tool — just click to
create the hotspot boundary.
Here’s the lowdown on designating hotspots by hand:
1.
Select either the Rectangle Image Map, Circle Image Map, or
Polygon Image Map tool from the Toolbox.
2.
Create the hotspot around the area.
If you selected the Rectangle Image Map tool or Circle Image Map tool,
click and drag a rectangular or circular area in the image window.
If you selected the Polygon Image Map tool, click where you want the
hotspot boundary to start, and then continue clicking around the con-
tour of the area. When the area is surrounded, double-click to close
the image map, or click the starting point to close the boundary.
Figure 58-1 shows the Polygon Image Map tool in action, creating an
irregularly shaped hotspot around the middle fish.

In the Image Map palette, enter a Web address
in the URL text box, as shown in Figure 58-2.
When you enter the Web address, be sure to type
http:// before the Web address. Also, enter the
alternate text in the Alt text box. This text appears
when someone browsing the Web page passes
the mouse over the hotspot. It also appears as a
placeholder while the viewer waits for graphics
to load.
• Figure 58-2: Enter the Web address in the URL text box.
4.
Repeat Steps 1 through 3 to create another
image map hotspot.
If you preview the image in a browser by clicking
the Preview in Browser button in the Toolbox, you
can test the image hotspots that you’ve created.
You can also optimize and save the image with
its image map as described in Technique 57. Be
sure to upload the image and associated HTML
file that ImageReady generates to your Web serv-
ice provider. Without the HTML file, your image
doesn’t have an image map.
Creating an Image Map 
by Using Layers
When you create an image map by using layers,
ImageReady does most of the work for you, creating
a hotspot around the colored pixels on each selected
layer. In addition, if you ever edit a layer containing a
layer-based hotspot — if you move the layer, trans-
form it, or edit it in any way — ImageReady automati-
cally updates the layer-based image map.
1.
In ImageReady, use the Layers palette to select
a layer.
The layer that you use to create a layer-based
image map must contain transparent areas.
Otherwise, the entire layer will be turned into
one giant hotspot.
2.
Choose Layer➪New Layer Based Image Map
Area.
3.
In the Image Map palette, use the Shape drop-
down list to select a shape for the hotspots.
You can choose from Square, Circular, or
Polygonal hotspots. Figure 58-3 shows polygonal
hotspots around the fish.

ice provider. Without the HTML file, the layer-
based image map doesn’t work.
• Figure 58-4: The pointing finger icon indicates that the

Working with Image Maps
After you create image maps, you can reshape
hotspots, convert layer-based image maps to tool-
based image maps, hide image maps if you need to
work on another aspect of a Web page, or (of course)
delete the image maps. Here’s the list from the
kitchen sink:

Reshape tool-based hotspots by choosing the
Image Map Select tool from the Toolbox. Then,
select the hotspot that you want to reshape in
the image window and drag the hotspot bound-
ary handles to reshape the hotspot.

Convert a layer-based image map to a tool-based
image map by using the Image Map Select tool to
select the image map that you want to convert.
Then, choose Promote Layer Based Image Map
Area from the Image Map palette menu, as shown
in Figure 58-5. Because only tool-based hotspots
can be reshaped, you must convert a layer-based
image map before you can reshape hotspots.
• Figure 58-3: The fish on the layer are surrounded by
polygonal hotspots.
4.
In the Image Map palette, enter a Web address
in the URL text box. (Refer to Figure 58-2.)
When you enter the Web address, be sure to type
http:// before the Web address. Also, enter the
alternate text in the Alt text box. This text appears
when someone browsing the Web page passes
the mouse over the hotspot. It also appears as a
placeholder while the viewer waits for graphics
to load.
When the URL is entered in the Image Map
palette, a tiny pointing finger icon appears near
the layer name in the Layers palette, as shown in
Figure 58-4. This pointing finger icon indicates
that the layer contains a layer-based image map.
5.
Repeat Steps 1 through 4 to create hotspots on
any other layers.
Preview the image in a browser by clicking 
the Preview in Browser button in the Toolbox.
Previewing the image lets you test the hotspots
that you’ve created.
When you’re happy with the image map, you can
optimize and save the layered image with its

Technique
Making Your
Graphics 
Rollover
A
lmost any Web page that you visit on the World Wide Web these
days has some kind of rollover. A rollover is a Web page event that
happens when the mouse moves over a graphic or clicks an area
of a Web page. (For instance, when the mouse passes over a button, the
button changes from gray to another color.) Rollovers make a Web site
look professional and add interactivity for viewers.
Creating super rollovers with ImageReady is easy. Image Ready gives you
all the tools that you need. Follow the directions in this technique to cre-
ate a few rollovers, and then let your imagination take over. After you get
the hang of creating rollover Web effects, use any of the Photoshop filters,
effects, transformations, or other features to create your own custom
rollovers.
Getting to Know Rollovers
If you’ve surfed the Web, no doubt you’ve seen rollovers. When your mouse
passes over a button or a hotspot on a Web page, the appearance of the
graphic changes. For instance, a button changes from gray to another
color, or a light bulb appears to turn on. These rollovers are created by
using rollover states.
The six rollover states are associated with the six actions that a mouse
can perform. The mouse actions work as triggers, activating the rollover
state. The six rollover states are

Over: Activates when the user passes the mouse over a slice or image
map area. In the Over state, the mouse button is not pressed.

Down: Activates when the user clicks and holds down the mouse but-
ton over a slice or image map area. This state is active as long as the
user keeps the mouse button pressed down and doesn’t release it.

Getting to Know Rollovers
353

Click: Activates when the user clicks the mouse
button while the mouse is over a slice or image
map area.

Selected: Activates when the user selects a slice
or image map area. The rollover remains active
until the user selects another slice or image map
area. For instance, a button changes color
because the user selects it. The button doesn’t
change back to its original color until the user
selects another button.

Out: Activates when the user moves the mouse
out of the slice or image map area.

Up: Activates when the user releases the 
mouse button while the mouse is over a slice 
or image map.
The default sequence of rollover states that
ImageReady assigns is Over, Down, and Click. First,
the user passes the mouse over the slice or image
map, activating the Over state. Then, the user presses
the mouse button down, activating the Down state.
Finally, the user releases the mouse button, triggering
the Click state.
You can use the following three ways to create
rollovers by using rollover states:

Change an image area. For instance, a color
changes or a drop shadow appears. In Figure
59-1, a drop shadow appears.

Substitute one image for another. In Figure 59-2,
a new image is substituted for the original image.

Make text or another image appear in a different
area of the browser window. In Figure 59-3, text
appears in a nearby area of the browser window.
• Figure 59-1: Changing the image area.
To create a rollover, an image must be divided into
slices first. Only user slices and layer-based slices
can be assigned rollover states. If ImageReady has
automatically generated auto slices surrounding an
area that you want to use in a rollover, you need to
convert the auto slices to user slices by using the
Slices➪Promote to User Slices command. (To find
out more about creating slices and converting them,
turn to Technique 56.)

Creating a Rollover 
by Using Slices
When creating a rollover by using a slice, you use
the Web Content palette to create the rollover states
and the Layers palette to hide and display the layers
associated with the rollover states. This example
uses only the Over state. When the example is com-
plete, a mouse passing over the slice triggers the
Over state, changing the way the sliced area looks.

In version 7 of ImageReady, rollovers were 
created by using the Rollover palette. With
ImageReady CS, the Rollovers palette is gone
and the new Web Content palette has all the
functionality of the old Rollovers palette. So, to
create rollovers in ImageReady CS, you use the
Web Content palette to assign rollover states
and the Layers palette to hide and display layers.
Mouse Off
Mouse Over

Creating a Rollover by Using Slices
355
The following steps show how to create a rollover by
using slices:
1.
In ImageReady, open the image that you want
to use for the rollover.
Take a look at the Web Content palette shown in
Figure 59-4. At the top of the palette, a thumbnail
of the image is labeled Normal. ImageReady uses
the Normal state to display the entire image
without any slices or rollover states. Along the
bottom of the palette are five buttons (from left
to right): Create Layer-Based Rollover, Group
Slices into Tabs, New Slice Set, Create Rollover
State, and Delete.
To make the rollover, you create a slice to let
ImageReady know which area to assign to a
rollover state.
• Figure 59-4: When you first open an image, a thumbnail
of the image appears in the Web Content
palette.
2.
Select the Slice tool from the Toolbox.
3.
Create a slice around the area that you want to
use to make the rollover.
As shown in Figure 59-5, a slice is created around
the top of the glass. Notice that a thumbnail of
the slice appears in the Web Content palette.
• Figure 59-5: When you create a slice, a thumbnail of the
slice appears in the Web Content palette.
4.
Choose Select➪Create Selection from Slice.
A selection marquee appears around the slice
boundary.
5.
Choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy or press
Ctrl+J/Ô+J.
A copy of the selected area is pasted into a new
layer. The new layer appears in the Layers
palette above the original layer.

Technique 59: Making Your Graphics Rollover
356
When you click the button, the rollover state
labeled Over appears in the Web Content palette
below the original slice, as shown in Figure 59-7.
Over is the default rollover state. If you want to
change to a different rollover state, double-click
the word Over and select a state from the Rollover
State Options dialog box. For this example, I use
the Over state.
• Figure 59-7: The Over rollover state appears with a
thumbnail below the slice in the Web
Content palette.
10.
In the Layers palette, click the eye icon next to
the Rollover layer to hide it.
11.
Select the Cup layer.
This is the layer that you need to modify to make
the image look different when the mouse passes
over the sliced area.
12.
Use a filter, layer effect, or other feature to mod-
ify the appearance of the selected Cup layer.
In this example, the Watercolor filter is applied
to the Cup layer.
Notice that when you alter the Cup layer, the layer
thumbnail in the Layers palette changes to reflect
the modification, and the thumbnail next to the
Over state in the Web Content palette changes also.
6.
Rename the copied layer.
You can name the layer anything you want, but
I’m using Cup in this example. You modify this
layer to make the image look different when the
mouse passes over the rollover.
7.
Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer or Press
Ctrl+J/Ô+J.
A duplicate of the new layer created in Step 5
appears in the Layer palette, as shown in 
Figure 59-6.
• Figure 59-6: The duplicated layer appears at the top of
the stack in the Layers palette.
8.
Rename the duplicate layer that you created in
Step 7.
You can name the layer anything you want, but
for this example I’m using the name Rollover.
Before performing the next step, make sure that
the Rollover layer is selected in the Layers
palette and the slice that you created in Step 3 is
selected in the Web Content palette.
9.
Click the Create Rollover State button at the
bottom of the Web Content palette.

Creating a Rollover 
by Using Layers
Using the Create Layer-Based Rollover button at the
bottom of the Web Content palette, you can quickly
turn a layer into a layer-based slice and create a new
rollover state all with the click of one button. When
you create a rollover by using a layer, the only way
that you can create changes between the rollover
states is to use layer styles.
1.
In the Layers palette, select a layer.
2.
At the bottom of the Web Content palette, click
the Create Layer-Based Rollover button.
The layer is instantly turned into a layer-based
slice. This change is indicated in the Layers
palette by the tiny Slice tool icon that appears
next to the layer’s name. Simultaneously, the Over
rollover state is generated by using the slice in the
Web Content palette, as shown in Figure 59-9.
Over is the default rollover state. If you want to
change to a different rollover state, double-click
the word Over and select a state from the Rollover
State Options dialog box. For this example, I use
the Over state.
• Figure 59-9: When you click the Create Layer-Based
Rollover button, the selected layer is used
to create a layer-based slice, and the Over
rollover state is assigned to the slice in the
Web Context palette.

Creating a Rollover by 
Using a Layer Style
When you create a rollover by using a layer style,
you don’t have to duplicate layers and assign them
to rollover states like you do when creating a
rollover by using a slice. Instead, different layer
styles can be applied to the same layer for each
rollover state.
1.
Open the image that you want to use for the
rollover.
2.
Use the Slice tool to create a slice around the
rollover area.
3.
In the Web Content palette, click the Create
Rollover State button.
3.
In the Layers palette, click the Add layer style
button at the bottom of the palette, and then
choose an effect from the menu.
Use the Layer Style dialog box to create an inter-
esting effect, such as a drop shadow, bevel, or
gradient overlay. In this example, I used a drop
shadow. To find out more about layer styles, take
a look at Technique 20.
When you’re finished creating the layer effect,
click OK to close the Layer Style dialog box.
Notice that the rollover state thumbnail in the
Web Content palette changes to reflect the layer
style that you applied.
That’s all there is to it! You just created a rollover
by using a layer style. To preview the rollover in
ImageReady, click the Preview Document button
in the Toolbox. To preview the rollover in a
browser, click the Preview in Browser button in
the Toolbox. Figure 59-10 shows the rollover in a
browser window.
Creating preset rollover styles
If you come up with a layer-based rollover effect that you really
like, you can save it as a preset, and (here’s the great part)
apply the rollover effect to any other layer with just one click!
Here’s how to save your preset:
1.
Create a layer-based rollover following the steps in the
section “Creating a Rollover by Using Layers.”
2.
Make sure that the layer that was used to create the
layer-based slice is selected in the Layers palette.
3.
In the Swatches palette, choose New Style from the
palette menu.
4.
Enter a name for your rollover style in the Style
Options dialog box and make sure to select the
Include Rollover States check box.
5.
Click OK to close the Style Options dialog box.
Your custom rollover style appears as a swatch at the
bottom of the Swatches palette.
To apply your custom rollover style to another layer, just select
the layer, and then click the swatch. Preview the rollover in a
browser. Cool!

Substituting Another Image
359
The Over rollover state automatically appears
with a thumbnail of the sliced area in the Web
Content palette.
Over is the default rollover state. If you want to
change to a different rollover state, double-click
the word Over and select a state from the Rollover
State Options dialog box. For this example, I use
the Over state.
4.
Make sure that the rollover state that you just
created in Step 3 is selected.
5.
In the Layers palette, click the Add Layer Style
button at the bottom of the palette, and then
choose an effect from the menu.
Use the Layer Style dialog box to create a fun
effect, such as a drop shadow, bevel, or gradient
overlay. I used a texture for this example. To find
out more about layer effects, turn to Technique 20.
When you’re finished creating the layer effect,
click OK to close the Layer Style dialog box.
Notice that the rollover state thumbnail changes
to reflect the layer style that you applied.
Preview the rollover in ImageReady by clicking
the Preview Document button in the Toolbox, or
preview the rollover in a browser by clicking the
Preview in Browser button in the Toolbox.
Substituting Another Image
Creating a substitution rollover is easy. All you need
is two layers containing different images. One image
is active in the Normal state, when the mouse is off
the image. The other image is the substitution image,
which replaces the original image when the Over
state is triggered by a mouse action, such as passing
over the slice area.
Use the following steps to create a substitution
rollover:
1.
Create a document with two layers.
On one layer is the original image, which you’ll
attach to the Normal state. The user sees this
image when the mouse is off the sliced area. The
other layer contains the substitution image. The
user sees the substitution image when the mouse
passes over the sliced area. (It doesn’t matter
which layer is on top in the stacking order.)
Figure 59-11 shows two penguin layers, one
labeled Standing and the second labeled Flying.
• Figure 59-11: I’m using two penguin layers, Standing and
Flying, to create a substitution rollover.
2.
Select the Slice tool from the Toolbox.
3.
Create a slice that encompasses the larger of
the two layers.
Notice that when you create the slice, it appears
in the Web Content palette.
4.
In the Layers palette, select the layer that you
want to use as the Normal state (when the
mouse is off the image).
For my example, the Standing layer is selected,
as shown in Figure 59-12.
5.
In the Layers palette, hide the substitute layer
(in my example, the Flying layer) by clicking
the eye icon.
Figure 59-12 shows that the Flying layer is hidden.

• Figure 59-13: When you create the Over rollover state,
the thumbnail contains the same image as
the Slice thumbnail.
• Figure 59-14: When you make the substitution image
visible, it appears in the Over rollover state
thumbnail in the Web Content palette.
• Figure 59-12: Use the Layers palette to hide the layer
that you don’t want to see when the 
mouse is not over the image.
6.
In the Web Content palette, click the Create
Rollover State button at the bottom of the
palette.
The Over rollover state appears below the slice
with the same image in the thumbnail as the
slice, as shown in Figure 59-13.
7.
With the Over rollover state selected in the
Web Content palette, use the Layers palette to
make the substitution image visible and the
Normal state image hidden.
In this example, the eye icon next to the Flying
penguin layer is clicked to make it visible and the
Standing penguin layer eye icon is clicked to hide
the layer, as shown in Figure 59-14.
When you hide one layer and make the other
layer visible, the Over state thumbnail in the
Web Content palette changes to display the visi-
ble layer.
And that’s it! Try out the rollover by previewing
it in ImageReady or in a browser.

Making GIF
Animations
W
hen you make a GIF animation, images contained in frames play
back in a specific order and speed, creating the impression of
motion. It’s just like creating a mini-movie. You see many types
of animations, but you can create two basic types easily with ImageReady:
text or an image moves across a Web page, and text or an image fades in
or out.
Create animations in ImageReady using the Animation palette shown in
Figure 60-1. This palette contains all the tools necessary to mark the first
and last frames of the animation, create the frames in between (called
tweening), and play back the animation for testing.

This technique takes you through creating two types
of GIF animations: The first uses layers to create the
animation, and the second uses the Layer palette’s
opacity slider to make text fade in and out. So, pull
out a Web graphic, launch ImageReady, and create
an animation. Animations are really quite easy. After
you get the hang of it, use your imagination to come
up with variations and your own ideas.
Creating an Animation 
Using Layers
When you run the animation created with the follow-
ing steps, it looks like an image is moving from one
side of the browser window to the other side. This
type of GIF animation uses an image on a transpar-
ent layer with another layer behind it that contains a
background color or background texture. Here’s
what you need to do:
1.
Create an image that has two layers. 
The bottom layer contains a background color or
texture and the upper layer contains the image
that will move from one side of the window to
the other.
For my example, shown in Figure 60-2, the image
contains a White layer that is used for the back-
ground and a Puffer layer containing an ornery
looking puffer fish.
2.
Choose Window➪Animation to display the
Animation palette.
3.
In the Layers palette, select the layer that con-
tains the image that will move.
In this example, I selected the Puffer layer.
4.
Using the Move tool, move the image to the left
side of the image window.
In the Animation palette, Frame 1 updates to dis-
play the moved image.

Click OK to close the Tween dialog box.
ImageReady automatically generates the frames
in between Frame 1 and Frame 2. In this example,
I added three frames, so Frame 2 is automatically
renumbered Frame 5, as shown in Figure 60-4.
That’s it! You’ve just created an animation. Click
the Play button on the Animation palette to
watch your animation in action.
• Figure 60-4: ImageReady creates frames between Frame
1 and Frame 2. Because three frames were
added between Frame 1 and Frame 2 in this
example, Frame 2 is renumbered Frame 5.
Making Text Fade In and Out
You can use ImageReady to create animations that
make text fade in and fade out. The way to do this
animation is to set the opacity for the text using two
frames. Using the following steps, the first frame
opacity is set to 0% and the second frame opacity is
set to 100%. Then using the Tween dialog box, add
frames between the two frames that step the opacity
first up, and then back down.
1.
Create a new image that you will use to make
the text fade in and out or open an image that
you want to add text to.
2.
Using the Text tool, add type to the image.
When you create the type, it appears in the Layers
palette on its own type layer. In this example, I
added type around the teakettle, as shown in
Figure 60-5.
• Figure 60-5: I added type on either side of the teakettle.

 In the Parameters area, select the items that
the frames in between will modify: Position,
Opacity, and/or Effects. (Effects are layer
styles applied to the image. For more about
applying layer styles to an image, turn to
Technique 20.) For this example, I made sure
that Opacity is checked.
7.
Click OK to close the Tween dialog box.
ImageReady automatically generates the frames
in between Frame 1 and Frame 2. In this example,
I added three frames, so Frame 2 is automatically
renumbered as Frame 5, as shown in Figure 60-7.
Notice that the type becomes more visible as the
frames progress.
• Figure 60-7: As the frames progress, the type becomes
more opaque and visible.
Great work! You’ve created the fade in for the
first part of the animation. For the second part of
the animation, you need to add more frames to
make the type fade out again. Using the Tween
dialog box makes this task easy.
8.
With the last frame still selected, click the
Tween button at the bottom of the Animation
palette.
In the Tween dialog box, use the Tween With
drop-down list to select First Frame. Enter the
number of frames you want to add after the
selected frame.
9.
Click OK to close the Tween dialog box.
ImageReady automatically generates frames and
places them after the selected frames. Notice
that the new frames fade out the type, as shown
in Figure 60-8.
3.
With the type layer selected in the Layers
palette, set the layer’s opacity to 0%.
When you set the type layer opacity to 0%, the
type becomes invisible. Notice that type in the
Frame 1 thumbnail in the Animation palette
updates also become invisible.
4.
With the type layer still selected, click the
Duplicate Current Frame button on the
Animation palette.
You now have two frames in the Animation palette
with invisible text with Frame 2 currently selected.
5.
In the Layers palette, set the type layer’s opac-
ity to 100% to make the type visible.
The Frame 2 thumbnail updates, showing the
text, as shown in Figure 60-6.
• Figure 60-6: You now have two frames in the Animation
palette. The type in Frame 1 is invisible and
the type in Frame 2 is visible.
6.
With Frame 2 still selected, click the Tween
button at the bottom of the Animation palette.
Use the Tween dialog box to create the frames in
between selected frames in the Animation
palette. In this example, I added three frames
between Frame 1 and Frame 2.
 Use the Tween With drop-down list to select
Previous Frame. This option sets ImageReady
to create frames with progressive opacity
from invisible to visible.
 Enter a number of frames in the animation in
the Frames to Add text box. In the Layers
area, select whether to copy All Layers (even
layers that don’t change) or to copy Selected
Layers to copy pixels from the currently
selected layers.

Working with Animations
365
Check out your fading type by clicking the Play
button at the bottom of the Animation palette or
by clicking the Preview in Browser button in the
Toolbox to preview the animation in a browser.
• Figure 60-8: After adding the final set of frames, the type
fades out again.
Another great text effect is creating warped
text. To create a warped text animation, create
the regular type as the first frame, and then
warp the type for the second frame. Use the
Tween dialog box to add frames between the
two frames and, voilà! You have an animation
using warped text.
Working with Animations
After creating an animation, you can set how long
each frame plays and how many times the animation
loops. Also, you can copy frames, move them around
in the Animation palette to change their order, re-
verse the entire frame order, and even delete a frame
or an entire animation. Here’s the lowdown:

Set frame play time: Click the tiny downward-
pointing triangle below the frame you want to
change in the Animation palette, as shown in
Figure 60-9. Select a preset amount of time from
the menu or click Other to specify the number of
seconds in the Set Frame Delay dialog box.

Set how many times an animation loops: Click
the Select Looping Options button at the bottom
left of the Animation palette, and then select
Once, Forever, or Other from the menu. If you
select Other, use the Set Loop Count dialog box
to enter the number of times you want the ani-
mation to loop.
• Figure 60-9: After clicking the tiny arrow under the frame,
select an amount of time delay using the
menu.

Copy a frame: Select the frame you want to copy
in the Animation palette, and then click the
Duplicate Current Frame button at the bottom of
the palette.

Move a frame to another position in the
Animation palette: Drag the frame across the
palette to a new location. As you drag, a dark 
line appears between the frames indicating the
position.

Reverse frame order in the Animation palette:
Select the frames you want to reverse by Shift+
clicking. Alternatively, you can select one frame
to reverse all the frames. Open the palette menu
and choose Reverse Frames.

Delete a frame: Select the frame you want to
delete, and then drag it to the trashcan icon at
the bottom of the Animation palette.

Creating
Background Tiling
for Web Pages
W
hen you use a tile to create a background in a Web page, the
small tiles are placed next to one another in a checkerboard pat-
tern, creating a seamless background. Background tiles are fre-
quently used on Web pages as decoration and for added visual interest.
Because it consists of only one small tile, whose file size is quite small, a
tiled background loads very quickly on a Web page.
This quick little technique shows you how to create a background tile
using the Tile Maker filter and how to view the tile as a Web page back-
ground right in ImageReady. Grab an image, pull out your virtual trowel,
and get tiling!
Creating Tiling
You need to be aware that when creating background tiling, you should
use a tile that is rather plain with little color change or texture. A back-
ground made from a tile that has a lot of color makes any text on a Web
page hard to read. Also, any text you add to a Web page with a back-
ground should be created using a color that contrasts sharply with the
background. For instance, text on a dark gray background should be
rather light, perhaps cream or white. (Imagine how hard it would be to
read black text placed on a dark gray background!)
Using a small tile for a background instead of one large image really
pays off because the small tile loads much faster. In addition, a tiled
background fills a user’s entire browser window no matter how large
or small the browser window is.
Here’s how to create a tile for a background:
1.
In ImageReady, open an image that you want to use to create a 
background tile.
I’m using the image in Figure 61-1 to create a tile for a tiled background.

you preview in a browser appears in the 
background.
• Figure 61-1: This little marble tile will be used to create

If the image contains slices, remove the slices
by choosing Slices➪Delete All.
If you want to use only a portion of the image 
to create the tile, use the Marquee tool to select
the area you want to use, and then choose
Image➪Crop.
3.
Choose Filter➪Other➪Tile Maker.
The Tile Maker dialog box opens.
4.
Select the Blend Edges check box to make the

Installing Plug-Ins
P
lug-ins extend the functionality of Photoshop in a seamless way.
Plug-ins are integrated right into the Photoshop environment and
are activated from within Photoshop. In fact, you have probably
already used plug-ins many times, even if you didn’t know it. Filters are
the most common plug-in type, the same filters that you find on the Filter
menu. Other plug-ins include all the commands on the File➪Import,
Export, Automate, and Scripts menus — such as PDF Presentation,
Contact Sheet II, and Picture Package.
This technique takes a look at where you can find plug-ins on the Web and
where you need to install them on your computer so that you can access
them in Photoshop. Plug-ins are really easy to install, so if you need to cre-
ate a special effect, but none of the filters that come with Photoshop quite
do it for you, download some plug-in filters and give them a spin.
Finding Plug-Ins on the Web
Oodles of Web sites offer plug-ins. Typically, plug-ins are filters. Some
plug-ins are freeware, but others are available for a fee.
I mention several plug-ins offered by third-party vendors throughout this
book. They include

KnockOut 2 by Corel, a super, easy-to-use masking interface
(Technique 49)

penPalette by nik multimedia, used for recoloring and enhancing
images (Technique 12)

Color Efex Pro by nik multimedia, which offers many filters that create
special effects such as imitating an old photo, adding saturation, and
converting images to black and white (Technique 30)

Dfine1.0 by nik multimedia, which reduces noise and other imperfec-
tions in images (Technique 31)

Powertone 1.5 by Creo, a duotone image enhancer (Technique 35)

Photo/Graphic Edges by Auto FX, which quickly lets you create super
frames and borders around any image (Technique 42)

Downloading and Installing
Plug-Ins
When you find a plug-in that you want to download
from a Web page, most often you can simply click a
link to download the file, as shown in Figure 62-1.
Because plug-in files can be rather large, they’re usu-
ally compressed as .Zip (Windows) or .Sit (Mac) files.
After downloading the compressed file, double-click it
to decompress it. Your computer takes you through
the decompression steps, as shown in Figure 62-2.
Decompression software comes with Mac OS X.
If you’re running a Windows machine and you
need the WinZip decompression software, you
can download it from www.winzip.com.

Downloading and Installing Plug-Ins
373
Next, place the file in the proper folder, as listed in
Table 62-1.
I list the default folder for actions, which you
can also download from the Web. Actions are
mini-programs that perform long series of
commands that modify images. (To find out
more about actions, turn to Technique 8.)

relaunch it. Then, look on the Filter menu for the new
filter (see Figure 62-3) or on the File➪Scripts menu.
(Actions can be found by using the Actions palette.)
• Figure 62-3: The new filter is located on the Filter menu.
Creating your own filters
If you like a good challenge and are mathematically inclined,
you might want to try your hand at creating your own cus-
tom filters.
You can create custom filters by using Filter Factory, a plug-in
created by Joe Ternasky. Using a programming language
that resembles C, you can create your own filters and effects
and compile them into filter files.
One of the best resources for the Filter Factory is Werner D.
Streidt’s Filter Factory Web site at mitglied.lycos.de/
filterfactory. There you can find an extensive Filter
Factory manual and other resources.

Enhancing Your
Images with Auto
FX Software
A
uto FX Software has created some amazing products that you can
use to expand Photoshop’s capabilities. These software programs
work as standalone applications or as filters inside Photoshop.
After you install them, they’re a dream to use. So many presets are avail-
able that you can start with one and modify it for your needs.
This technique takes a look at two Auto FX Software programs: Mystical
Lighting; and Mystical Tint, Tone, Color. (I discuss another great Auto FX
program, Photo/Graphic Edges, in Technique 42.)
If you like the effects you see here (and I can only show a morsel of the
entire feast!), then check out the great software offered by Auto FX at its
Web site, www.autofx.com. You can download free trial versions of many
Auto FX products.
Installing the full version software isn’t a problem; just insert the CD-ROM
and follow the installation instructions. After the installation is complete,
a handy shortcut (Windows) or alias (Mac) is automatically placed on the
desktop. Double-click the shortcut/alias to launch the standalone program.
To access the programs within Photoshop, open the Filter menu and look
at the bottom of the list, where you find the programs listed on an Auto FX
submenu.
Applying Mystical Lighting
Mystical Lighting is used to enhance the lighting in your Photoshop
images. You can choose from softening effects, modifying color casts,
and adding edge lighting to rainbows, fairy dust, and sunrays.
The program comes with many presets, so you can experiment with dif-
ferent looks to get as close as you can to the results you want. Then you
can use various controls to adjust the settings and get the mystical light-
ing effect just right.

Applying Mystical Lighting
375
Here’s a quick demo of Mystical Lighting:
1.
In Photoshop, open an image you want to add
lighting effects to.
For this example, I’m using the photograph of
Arches National Park shown in Figure 63-1.
• Figure 63-1: I’m adding a ray of sunlight to this
photograph.
2.
Choose Filter➪Auto FX Software➪Mystical.
The Mystical Lighting program dialog box opens,
as shown in Figure 63-2. (Depending upon the
speed of your computer, the program may take a
minute to load.)
Take a minute to look around the program win-
dow. On the left are File, Edit, View, and Special
Effects buttons. On the right is a floating Layer
Options palette that lets you choose from layer
presets, create new layers, and clone and delete
layers.
3.
Click the Special Effects button to choose from
the menu of effects, as shown in Figure 63-3.
For this example, I’m using LightCaster to add a
ray of sunlight to the photograph.
Depending upon the special effect you select, a
set of tools and settings appears at the left side
of the program window, as shown in Figure 63-4.
• Figure 63-2: The Mystical Lighting program window
opens full screen.
• Figure 63-3: Choose a lighting effect from the Special
Effects menu.
4.
For the LightCaster effect, drag the T-shaped
path to set the width and direction of the light
cast on the image, as shown in Figure 63-5.
5.
Using the sliders at the left side of the program
window, set the Cast Color, Spread, and Fade
Out of the sunbeam.

Technique 63: Enhancing Your Images with Auto FX Software
376
6.
Click OK to apply the lighting effect to the
image and return to Photoshop.
As shown in Figure 63-6, the LightCaster adds a
lovely sunbeam to Delicate Arch.
• Figure 63-6: The sunbeam adds a glow to Delicate Arch.
Adjusting Tint and Tone
Mystical Tint, Tone, Color is used to modify the tint
and tone of images to give them special looks, such
as antique photographs, bleaching (to create a sun
blasted look), cooling, and increasing color depth
and saturation.
You can apply most effects in this program in two
ways: over the entire image or brushed onto specific
areas.
Color tint and tone corrections can be applied using
Effect layers or Correction layers. Both of these
layer types work like Photoshop adjustment layers,
recoloring the pixels of the original image, but not
permanently changing them. You can also apply
masking layers to protect areas of an image that you
don’t want to modify.
• Figure 63-4: The LightCaster tools and settings appear at
the left side of the program window.
• Figure 63-5: Drag the T-shaped path to set the width and
direction of the sunbeam.

Adjusting Tint and Tone
377
Here’s a brief look into adjusting tint and tone using
Mystical Tint, Tone, Color:
1.
In Photoshop, open the image you want to 
modify.
For this example, I’m using the cottage shown in
Figure 63-7.
• Figure 63-7: I’m giving this picture of a cottage the
appearance of an old photograph.
2.
Choose Filter➪Auto FX Software➪Mystical TTC.
The Mystical Tint, Tone, Color program window
opens, as shown in Figure 63-8. (Depending upon
the speed of your computer, you might need to
wait a minute.)
Take a minute to look around the program window.
On the left are File, Edit, View, and Special Effects
buttons. On the right is a floating Layer Options
palette that lets you choose from layer presets,
create new layers, and clone and delete layers.
3.
Click the Special Effects button to choose from
the menu of effects shown in Figure 63-9.
For this example, I’m using Antique Photo to
make the cottage image look old.
Depending upon the special effect you select, a
set of tools and settings appears at the left side
of the program window, as shown in Figure 63-10.
• Figure 63-8: The Mystical Tint, Tone, Color program
window includes a Work Area showing
the image.
• Figure 63-9: Choose a special effect from the menu.
4.
Using the drop-down lists and sliders at the left
side of the program window, select the Antique
Style, Sepia Tone, Brightness, and Contrast.
The Dreamy slider controls the Sepia setting’s
highlights, giving the image a softer appearance.

5.
Click OK to apply the settings and return to
Photoshop.
Figure 63-11 shows the results of antiquing the
cottage photo.
• Figure 63-11: The cottage photo now has an old, diffused
appearance.
• Figure 63-10: The Antique Photo tools and settings
appear at the left side of the program
window.

Loading New
Libraries
P
hotoshop ships with many libraries — such as brushes, styles, and
gradients — that aren’t automatically loaded into the appropriate
palette or picker. Adding and using these libraries while working in
Photoshop can really enhance your ability to modify images and effects.
In addition, many Photoshop artists have created custom libraries that
are available on the Web. Downloading these libraries and using them in
Photoshop is easy and fun.
This technique takes you through the ins and outs of loading libraries by
using palettes and pickers. I reveal how the Preset Manager — the ultimate
Photoshop library clearinghouse — loads and even creates libraries. Also,
I list a few Web sites that offer libraries for download to get you started.
From there, you can use your favorite Web search engine, such as Google,
Yahoo!, or AltaVista, to quickly find more.
Loading Libraries by Using 
Palettes or Pickers
You can load libraries by using either palettes or pickers. No matter
which palette or picker you use to load a library, they all fundamentally
work in the same way. Here’s how:
1.
Depending on the tool you’re using, open the appropriate palette or
picker.
For instance, if you’re working with the Gradient tool, open the
Gradient picker on the Options bar, as shown in Figure 64-1. Or, if
you’re working with the Horizontal Type tool, open the Tool Preset
picker on the Options bar.

You can always restore the default presets to
any palette or picker by choosing Reset from the
picker or palette menu and then clicking OK.
Working with the 
Preset Manager
The Preset Manager works like a big filing cabinet
for all the available tool presets. Using the Preset
Manager, you can load new libraries, create your
own libraries, and delete libraries that you don’t
want anymore.
Here’s how to load new libraries by using the Preset
Manager:

The Preset Manager opens, as shown in 
Figure 64-3.
2.
Use the Preset Type drop-down list to select the
type of preset library that you want to add.
Your choices are Brushes, Swatches, Gradients,
Styles, Patterns, Contours, Custom Shapes, and
Tools.
• Figure 64-1: Many extra gradient libraries ship with
Photoshop.
2.
Click the tiny arrow button at the upper-right
corner of the palette or picker. A menu opens.
3.
Choose a library from the bottom of the menu,
as shown in Figure 64-1.
Photoshop opens a dialog box that asks whether
you want to append the new library to the pre-
sets already shown in the picker or palette. (See
Figure 64-2.)
If you don’t see a library at the bottom of the
menu but you know that it’s available on your
computer (perhaps you downloaded it from the
Web), choose Load from the menu to view
the Load dialog box. Then locate the library
in the folder where you saved it, and click Load.
