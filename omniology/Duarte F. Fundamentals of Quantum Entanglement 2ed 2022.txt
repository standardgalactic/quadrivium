Entanglement (Second Edition)

IOP Series in Coherent Sources, Quantum Fundamentals, and Applications
About the Editor
F J Duarte is a laser and quantum physicist based in the USA. His career has
spanned three continents while contributing in the academic, industrial, and defense
sectors. Duarte is editor/author of 15 laser optics books and sole author of three
books: Tunable Laser Optics, Quantum Optics for Engineers, and Fundamentals of
Quantum Entanglement. Duarte has made original contributions in the ﬁelds of
coherent imaging, directed energy, high-power tunable lasers, laser metrology, liquid
and solid-state organic gain media, narrow-linewidth tunable laser oscillators,
organic semiconductor coherent emission, N-slit quantum interferometry, polar-
ization rotation, quantum entanglement, and space-to-space secure interferometric
communications. He is also the author of the generalized multiple-prism grating
dispersion theory and pioneered the use of Dirac’s quantum notation in N-slit
interferometry and classical optics. His contributions have found applications
in numerous ﬁelds, including astronomical instrumentation, dispersive optics,
femtosecond laser microscopy, geodesics, gravitational lensing, heat transfer, laser
isotope separation, laser medicine, laser pulse compression, laser spectroscopy,
mathematical transforms, nonlinear optics, polarization optics, and tunable diode
laser design. Duarte was elected Fellow of the Australian Institute of Physics in 1987
and Fellow of the Optical Society of America in 1993. He has received various
recognitions, including the Engineering Excellence Award and the David Richardson
Medal from the Optical Society.
Coherent Sources, Quantum Fundamentals, and Applications
Since its discovery, the laser has found innumerable applications from astronomy to
zoology. Subsequently, we have also become familiar with other sources of coherent
radiation such as the free electron laser, optical parametric oscillators, and coherent
interferometric emitters. The aim of this book series Coherent Sources, Quantum
Fundamentals, and Applications is to explore and explain the physics and technology
of widely applied sources of coherent radiation and to match them with utilitarian
and cutting-edge scientiﬁc applications. Coherent sources of interest are those that
offer advantages in particular emission characteristics areas, such as broad tuna-
bility, high spectral coherence, high energy, or high power. An additional area of
inclusion are those coherent sources capable of high performance in the miniaturized
realm. Understanding of quantum fundamentals can lead to new and better coherent
sources and unimagined scientiﬁc and technological applications. Application areas
of interest include the industrial, commercial, and medical sectors. Also, particular
attention is given to scientiﬁc applications with a promising future such as coherent
spectroscopy, astronomy, biophotonics, space communications, space interferom-
etry, quantum entanglement, and quantum interference.

Series preface
The laser, the brightest child of the quantum era, awesome emitter of coherent
radiation, has given humankind solutions in a vast array of scientiﬁc and industrial
disciplines. Fields from astronomy to medicine to nanoscience have beneﬁted
enormously from the laser. Concurrently, additional sources of coherent radiation,
such as the free electron laser, optical parametric oscillators, and interferometric
emitters, have increased the freedom of choice for scientists and engineers searching
for the perfect match between source and application. The aim of this book series on
Coherent Sources, Quantum Fundamentals, and Applications is to explore and
explain the physics and technology of sources of coherent radiation and to match
them with utilitarian and cutting-edge applications. Coherent sources of interest are
those that offer particular advantages in speciﬁc emission characteristics areas such
as broad tunability, high energy, and high power. Additional areas of interest are
miniaturized coherent sources in the micro and nano realms. Understanding of
quantum fundamentals can lead to novel coherent sources and unimagined scientiﬁc
and technological applications. Application areas of interest include the commercial,
industrial, and medical sectors. Also, particular attention is given to scientiﬁc
applications such as astronomy, biophotonics, coherent spectroscopy, quantum
entanglement, quantum interference, space communications, and space interferometry.

Book preface
Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement (second edition) is a monograph, including

is the probability amplitude, or state, that describes the polarization entanglement of
two quanta (

graph’s initial approach is from a chronological perspective and explains both the
philosophical path, initiated by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR), and the
alternative physics path, initiated by Dirac, Wheeler, Pryce, and Ward, to what
eventually became the ﬁeld of quantum entanglement. As the subject matter
progresses attention is paid to the hidden variable theories that led to the
formulation of Bell’s theorem, which highlights the incompatibility of such theories
with quantum mechanics. Experiments designed to test for these ‘hidden theories’ in
light of Bell’s inequalities are also described. Attention is then focused on a clear and
transparent interferometric derivation of the ubiquitous quantum entanglement
probability amplitude for

3, 6, 9 situations. This direct non-philosophical
interferometric approach, à la Dirac, removes much of the mystery associated with
this subject matter and explains quantum entanglement without paradoxes. Next, the
equations of quantum entanglement are presented and explained in matrix form
which facilitate a straight-forward approach to the subject in an engineering style.
Following a description of applications of the quantum entanglement probability
amplitude to cryptography, teleportation, and quantum computing, the focus
returns to the essence of quantum mechanics and matters of interpretation. In this
regard, the pragmatic approach to quantum mechanics associated with Born, Dirac,
Feynman, Dyson, Lamb, and Ward, is reinforced. Following the success of the ﬁrst
edition, this second edition is a revised and enlarged version of the original that
includes new chapters (22 and 29). Chapter 22 is titled ‘Quantum entanglement via
matrix notation’. This chapter will enable the reader to understand and to work
with, quantum entanglement equations entirely in matrix form. The second new
chapter (29) is titled ‘Quantum interferometric principles’. Finer issues on the
understanding of quantum mechanics brought forward in the ﬁrst edition are treated
in more depth and ﬁnesse in this new version. In this second edition, 25 of the
chapters and 8 of the appendices include problems.

Author biography
F J Duarte
Francisco Javier Duarte is a Chilean-born laser and quantum
physicist based in the USA. He studied mathematics and physics
at Macquarie University (Sydney, Australia) where he was, as an
undergraduate, a student of the quantum physicist John Clive
Ward. At Macquarie he was awarded First Class Honors in
physics for his thesis titled ‘Excitation processes in continuous
wave rare gas–metal halide vapour lasers’. Immediately following
his honors degree he completed his PhD research, within three
years, on optically pumped molecular lasers. During his doctoral research Duarte
discovered new multiple-prism grating narrow-linewidth tunable laser oscillator
conﬁgurations and the generalized multiple-prism grating dispersion theory. From
Macquarie he went to the University of New South Wales, as a Postdoctoral Fellow,
where he built UV narrow-linewidth tunable lasers for high-resolution IR–UV
double-resonance spectroscopy.
Duarte has worked and contributed professionally in the academic, industrial,
and defense sectors and has practiced physics in Australia, the Americas, and
Europe. Notable in his career path is his prolonged industrial tenure at the Imaging
Research Laboratories of the Eastman Kodak Company, in Rochester, NY, where
he directed the company’s optical metrology laboratory. Duarte is the author of
numerous archival physics papers and an inventor in lasers and optics. He has made
original contributions in the ﬁelds of coherent imaging, directed energy, high-power
tunable lasers, interferometric imaging, laser metrology, liquid and solid-state

by-chapter description of this book and its aims.
1.1 Introduction
Few subjects in physics evoke the interest and wonder created by quantum entanglement.
The interest is intrinsic, fueled by inherent curiosity in everything ‘quantum’. Authors and
writers, within and outside physics, trying to explain quantum entanglement effects using
words such as ‘strange’, ‘mysterious’, and even ‘weird’, add to the mystique.
The aim of this monograph is to illuminate, and elucidate, the physics and the
fundamentals of quantum entanglement to scientists, engineers, and even physicists.
All that is required is a good background in ﬁrst year physics and ﬁrst year
mathematics, matrix algebra in particular.
This second edition of Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement offers a revised,
improved, and enlarged version of the original (Duarte 2019) with a total of 30 chapters
and 10 appendices. A distinction with the ﬁrst edition is that now not all chapters are
brief since some chapters have been extended as needed. Two new chapters are included,
chapters 22 and 29. Chapter 22 is titled ‘Quantum entanglement via matrix notation’
and presents a utilitarian exposition on the matrix and tensor representation of the
quantum entanglement probability amplitudes as developed since 2019 (Duarte et al
2020, Duarte and Taylor 2021). Chapter 29 is titled ‘Quantum interferometric
principles’ and provides a transparent exposition of quantum mechanical principles
from an interferometric perspective in the complete absence of mysteries or paradoxes.

All chapters have been revised and extended when appropriate. Twenty-ﬁve of the
chapters include problems directly related to the material presented. Eight of the
appendices include problems.
1.2 Foundations of quantum mechanics
Quantum mechanics was discovered around 1900 by Max Planck. It was the result
of an experimental discovery in the macroscopic domain. Planck was attempting to
understand the energy distribution of light sources as a function of frequency. In this
endeavor he introduced, in the absence of derivation, one of the most momentous
equations in the history of physics (Planck 1901):
ν
=
E
h ,
(1.1)
where E is the energy in units of joules (J), ν is the frequency of light in units of hertz
(Hz), or s−1, and
=
×
−
h
6.62607015
10 34 Js is Planck’s constant. This equation links
high frequencies, or wavelengths toward the blue end of the spectrum, with high
energies. On the other hand, low frequencies, or wavelengths toward the red end of
the spectrum, are associated with low energies. Planck’s energy equation and h are
discussed further in appendix J.
There are several equivalent ways to approach quantum mechanics, the most
prevalent being:
1. Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics (Born and Jordan 1925, Born et al 1926,
Heisenberg 1925)
2. Schrödinger’s equation (Schrödinger 1926)
3. Dirac’s bra ket notation (Dirac 1939)
4. Moyal’s statistics (Moyal 1949)
5. Position, momentum, and energy operators (Dirac 1958, Feynman et al
1965)
6. Feynman’s path integrals (Feynman and Hibbs 1965)
The presentation in this monograph is entirely based on Dirac’s bra ket notation
(Dirac 1939, 1958). This notation is explained in chapter 2.
1.2.1 The mathematical bases of quantum mechanics
Following Feynman’s lead and using a minimum of words, here the essential
quantum mechanical principles necessary to understand quantum interference and
quantum entanglement are presented:
1. Theorem: The probability amplitude for a single quantum is mathematically
identical to the probability amplitude for an ensemble of indistinguishable quanta.
2. The probability amplitude for a single quantum, or an ensemble of r
indistinguishable quanta, is given by the Dirac–Feynman interferometric
principle (Feynman et al 1965)

〈∣〉〈∣〉

The N in this superposition series means that every propagation path
must be incorporated in the calculation.
3. The principle of superposition: ‘Any state may be considered as the result of a
superposition of two or more other states… conversely any two or more
states may be superposed to give a new state’ (Dirac 1958). Feynman refers to
the j states as base states… ‘any quantum mechanical state can be described
completely by the amplitude 〈∣〉
j s to go into the base states… any state in the
world can be expressed as a superposition… of base states’ (Feynman et al
1965). The Dirac–Feynman interferometric principle, expressed in equation
(1.2), is inherently linked to the principle of superposition.
Further examples of superposition are the interferometric probability

Probabilities and polarization are also measurable quantities.
These laws, and/or principles, of quantum mechanics provide the
foundations of the knowledge needed to quantify generalized quantum
interference and quantum entanglement.
1.2.2 The photon from a quantum perspective
The concept of a single photon, or quantum, is extraordinarily important to the
ﬁeld of quantum entanglement. Equally important are correlated pairs of
photons or correlated pairs of quanta. In this subsection relevant thoughts and
reﬂections on the photon by three of the brightest luminaries in the ﬁeld of
quantum physics are included in an effort to provide a manifold of useful
concepts on the photon:
• ‘The wave function gives information about the probability of one photon
being in a particular place and not the probable number of photons in that
place… Each photon then interferes only with itself. Interference between two
different photons never occurs.’ (Dirac 1958)
• ‘Newton thought that light was made up of particles, but then it was discovered
that it behaves like a wave… We say: It is like neither.’ (Feynman et al 1965)
• ‘Photons cannot be localized in any meaningful manner, and they do not
behave at all like particles, whether described by a wave function or not.’
(Lamb 1995)
Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement (Second Edition)
1-4

In regard to Dirac’s dictum on interference it should be clariﬁed that in quantum
mechanics two indistinguishable quanta are the same quantum, or photon.
Indistinguishable photons are photons of the same frequency and linewidth. In this
regard, indistinguishable quanta emitted by two distinct lasers, can interfere.
The concept of nonlocality of the photon, brought up by Lamb, is of paramount
importance to quantum optics and can be intuitive to experienced experimentalists:
‘All the indistinguishable photons illuminate the array of N slits, or grating,
simultaneously. If only one photon propagates, at any given time, then that
individual photon illuminates the whole array of N slits simultaneously’ (Duarte
2003). The property of nonlocality is highlighted because this concept of nonlocality
is essential to quantum entanglement.
In more quantitative terms: a single photon moves, in vacuum, at the speed of
light
=
c
2.99792458 m s−1. It has a wavelength λ and a frequency ν, so that
λ
ν
= c .
(1.16)
As already mentioned a photon is related to a quantum energy
ν
=
E
h , or
ω
= ℏ
E
,
(1.17)
where
π
ℏ= h/2
and ω
πν
= 2
. A single photon exhibits a quantum ‘momentum’ of
(de Broglie 1924)
= ℏ
p
k,
(1.18)
where
π λ
=
k
2 /
is known as the wave number.
As mentioned by Dirac (1958) a single photon is associated with complex wave
functions of the form
ψ
ψ
=
ω
−
−
x t
e
( , )
i
t kx

(
)
and these complex wave functions are used to provide a mathematical representa-
tion of the probability amplitudes.
Furthermore, it can be established from Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
Δ Δ
≈
p x
h (Dirac 1958) that single photons can be extremely non-local and can
exhibit enormous coherence lengths as described by
ν
Δ Δ
≈
x
c.
(1.19)
The extreme nonlocality comes from the fact that a single quantum can exhibit an
extraordinarily narrow-linewidth
ν
Δ . As it will be seen further in this monograph,
this condition of nonlocality is central to quantum entanglement.
Also, ‘ensembles of indistinguishable photons exhibiting very narrow-linewidth
ν
Δ originating from nearly monochromatic sources, such as narrow-linewidth lasers,
approximate the behavior of a single-photon’ (Duarte 2014).
Nonlocality and quantum entanglement co-exist as described in the following
statement: ‘the two photons are entangled and according to local realism, their
polarizations planes should become independent… a typical EPR situation. Already

in 1948, observations agreed with quantum mechanics… not with local realism’
(Dalitz and Duarte 2000).
1.3 Ward’s observations

(

) … was my ﬁrst lesson in quantum mechanics, and in a very real
sense my last, since all the rest is mere technique, which can be learnt from books.’
(Ward 2004)
‘The inner mysteries of quantum mechanics require a willingness to extend one’s
mental processes into a strange world of phantom possibilities, endlessly branching
into more and more abstruse chains of coupled logical networks, endlessly extending
themselves forward and even backwards in time.’ (Ward 2004)
In addition to these observations Ward was silent on issues of interpretation and
highly skeptical, even dismissive, of experimental efforts aimed at testing hidden
variable theories (Duarte and Taylor 2021). This theme is explored further in
chapter 30.
1.4 History of quantum entanglement
‘If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants’ wrote Newton in
1675.
This sentence is relevant to physics as it was then and as it is now. It underscores
beautifully the importance of accurate history in physics. More speciﬁcally it can be
interpreted as a visionary call from the master to stimulate proper and meaningful
referencing in the ﬁeld of physics.
The vast majority of works published in the ﬁeld of quantum entanglement
present an incomplete version of history heavily biased toward the philosophical
while neglecting the physics origin of quantum entanglement. Even though the
philosophical perspective is extraordinarily enthralling, and has served well quan-
tum entanglement by attracting the attention of the public at large, the less
glamorous physics needs to be a participant in order to provide a complete, and
transparent, exposition of the subject.
In this monograph, both the philosophical and the physics aspects of quantum
entanglement are presented and discussed. This presentation is a revised extension of
previous ideas and discussions on the subject (Dalitz and Duarte 2000, Duarte 2012,
2013a, 2013b, 2014, 2016).
1.4.1 The philosophical path
The philosophical path to quantum entanglement is well known to those familiar
with the literature on the subject. It all started with a paper written by Einstein et al
(1935) that became one of the most cited papers in physics. In this paper, that
became known as the ‘EPR paper’, using the initials of the surnames of the three
authors Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, questions were formulated on the complete-
ness of quantum mechanics while introducing the notion of a ‘possible’ more
complete formulation of the subject. At the same time Einstein corresponded with
Schrödinger who also published on the subject and introduced the word
Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement (Second Edition)
1-6

entanglement to describe the ‘action at a distance’ introduced by the thought
experiment considered by Einstein and colleagues (Schrödinger 1935, 1936). As it
turns out the EPR paper eventually generated an enormous citation following while
the Schrödinger papers languished uncited in the archives.
Key in deciding the chain of events that followed EPR was a paper by Bohm and
Aharonov (1957) that discussed the EPR paper in the context of developments from the
physics side of things, notably the work of Wu and Shaknov (1950), while also
introducing a discussion on hidden variables. An additional salient contribution was a
famous paper by Bell (1964) that referenced Bohm and Aharonov while providing a
transparent proof that quantum mechanics was incompatible with hidden variables.
Incompatibility was determined by a probabilistic argument culminating in a probabilistic
inequality. Violation of this inequality meant incompatibility of quantum mechanics with
hidden variables. Here, it should be mentioned that hidden variable theories were thought
to provide a possible deterministic explanation of quantum experimental measurements.
In fairness to history it should also be mentioned that the concept of incompat-
ibility between quantum mechanics and hidden variables was introduced as early as
1932 by von Neumann, however, it was claimed that the proof leading to the von
Neumann (1932) conclusion was found ‘wanting’ (Bell 1964). This is discussed in
chapter 10 and also in chapter 30.
Post-Bell came a paper by Clauser et al (1969) that made the use of Bell’s theorem
applicable to optical experiments and introduced modiﬁed Bell inequalities. Next
came the use of those modiﬁed Bell inequalities by Aspect et al (1981, 1982a, 1982b)
in optical experiments that demonstrated violation of Bell’s inequalities. This chain
of events is illustrated in ﬁgure 1.1.
Figure 1.1. Philosophical path to quantum entanglement: solid arrowed lines indicate a direct citation path in
the literature. The main citation path runs vertically downwards. For instance, von Neumann’s contribution
was cited by Bell but not necessarily by other authors in the direct vertical path. The papers by Schrödinger
received almost no attention for many years and only began to be cited regularly in the 1990s. The assigned
years refer to literature emergence dates.
Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement (Second Edition)
1-7

Following the Aspect experiments the citation trail of published papers in the ﬁeld
was tailored almost exclusively by the philosophical path that can be summarized as
→
→
EPR
Bohm and Aharonov
Bell.
The label ‘philosophical path’ does not mean that it was all pure philosophy.
There was also physics but the researchers were interested and motivated by a deeper
meaning of quantum mechanics framed in a deterministic way of thinking compat-
ible with classical notions. The fact that quantum mechanics denied that deeper
understanding apparently made this philosophical avenue quite irresistible.
An important note of clariﬁcation here is that albeit the derivation of Bell’s
theorem does not utilize quantum principles, the computation of the probabilities in
the inequality statement does depend on quantum entanglement probabilities of the
type discovered by Pryce and Ward (1947). However, these quantum probabilities
are introduced ‘ad hoc’.
1.4.2 The physics path
The physics path is a pragmatic, measurement driven, avenue to quantum
entanglement. It began with a paper by Dirac on pair theory (Dirac 1930) and
some sixteen years later was followed by a transparent and profound statement by
John Wheeler that captures the very essence of quantum entanglement: ‘if one of
these photons is linearly polarized in one plane, then the photon that goes off in the
opposite direction with equal momentum is linearly polarized in the perpendicular
plane’ (Wheeler 1946-). Wheeler made his statement in reference to a positron–
electron annihilation process,
γγ
→
+ −
e e
1 2, that leads to the emission of two quanta in
opposite directions.
Wheeler’s paper was soon followed by a publication that correctly predicted the
quantum mechanical cross section for γ ray scattering in experiments designed to test
Wheeler’s prediction (Pryce and Ward 1947). The quantum scattering equation of Pryce
and Ward was corroborated theoretically by Snyder et al (1948) and experimentally by
Hanna (1948), Bleuler and Bradt (1948), and Wu and Shaknov (1950).
The Pryce and Ward (1947) approximately half-page disclosure titled ‘Angular
correlation effects with annihilation radiation’ was crucial for two fundamental
reasons. It disclosed the very ﬁrst diagram of a quantum entanglement experiment
and it calculated the scattering cross section annihilation which has a form of

as part of his dual-topic doctoral thesis (Ward 1949). It should be noted that this
probability amplitude is essential for the correct derivation of the ﬁnal quantum
probability for the quantum scattering equation published by Pryce and Ward
(1947).
It should also be stated categorically that ψ

includes and
contains all the physics relevant to quantum entanglement experiments. All this
physics was done pre-Bell theorem in a complete vacuum of philosophical
discussions and in the total absence of concern, or preoccupation, with hidden
variable theories.
In the physics path to quantum entanglement, illustrated in ﬁgure 1.2, it is
apparent that after the Wu and Shaknov (1950) experiments, Wu and co-workers
revisited the entanglement arena this time utilizing cross-ﬁeld fertilization from the
philosophical path, namely with knowledge of Bell’s theorem (Kasday et al 1975).
As it turns out, practitioners in the philosophical path doubted the relevance of the
Wu experiments from a local hidden variable perspective (Clauser et al 1969,
Clauser and Horner 1974).
Following this line of thought Aspect et al (1981) wrote: ‘the experiments agree
with QM predictions. However, because of the lack of efﬁcient polarizers for
0.5 MeV photons, strong supplementary assumptions are necessary to interpret these
results via Bell’s theorem.’ This was despite the initial favorable reception given by
Bohm and Aharonov (1957) to the experiment by Wu and Shaknov (1950).
Figure 1.2. Physics path to quantum entanglement: solid arrowed lines indicate a direct citation path in the
literature. The main citation path runs vertically downwards. The paper by Wu and Shaknov (1950) inﬂuenced
the paper by Bohm and Aharonov (1957) in the philosophical avenue while the papers by Kasday et al (1975)
and Wilson et al (1976) were inﬂuenced by Bell’s theorem. The assigned years refer to literature emergence
dates.

What should be kept in mind is that even though today all of the developments
in the ﬁeld of quantum entanglement revolve around the probability amplitude
for quantum entanglement ψ
∣〉= ∣

2 , there is almost no acknowl-
edgement of its origin or the physics path that led to its discovery. This
monograph is designed to provide a perspective on quantum entanglement
from the philosophical and the physics perspectives by including all the relevant
literature. This approach removes the ‘cloud of mystery’ that surround quantum
entanglement.
In conjunction with ﬁgures 1.1 and 1.2, an overall approximate perspective of the
ﬁeld is given in ﬁgure 1.3.
1.5 The field of quantum entanglement
The emergence of the combined words quantum entanglement, in the open literature,
appears to go back to the mid-late 1980s (Ghirardi et al 1987). This was a few years
after the optical experiments on quantum entanglement by Aspect et al (1981, 1982a,
1982b).
Today the ﬁeld of quantum entanglement is enormous and it is divided roughly
into three main subﬁelds as outlined in ﬁgure 1.3: quantum cryptography, quantum
teleportation, and quantum computing. Quantum communications is part of
quantum cryptography. On paper, judging by citations, these subﬁelds have been
heavily inﬂuenced by the ideas and concepts derived from the philosophical path to
quantum entanglement (ﬁgure 1.1).
On the other hand, also judging from citations, the acknowledgement of the
physics path (ﬁgure 1.2) has been utterly minuscule. This almost non-existing
recognition has persisted albeit the all-important probability amplitude for quantum
entanglement, which was discovered in a vacuum of philosophical arguments:

Bell’s theorem.

further details are given in chapter 15.
In other words, although equation (1.24) began to be used heavily in quantum
cryptography and quantum teleportation, almost no mention has been made of its
origin back in 1947. Quite a remarkable situation.
In ﬁgure 1.3 quantum cryptography is dated as having been initiated in 1991 since
that is the date applicable to the introduction of entangled photon pairs to the ﬁeld
(Ekert 1991).
However, quantum cryptography as a concept goes back to the early–mid 1980s
(see, for example, Bennett and Brassard 1984). Quantum teleportation was intro-
duced by Bennett et al (1993).
The ﬁrst discussion of quantum logic is due to von Neumann (1932). In a more
contemporaneous setting quantum computing received the attention of Feynman
(1985, 1986) and reﬂecting on Feynman’s independence, his approach to quantum
computing was his own and thus it did not follow a pre-established literature path.
The term qbit, short for quantum bit, was introduced by Schumacher (1995).
Schumacher’s approach, although it does not mention the EPR →Bohm and
Aharonov →Bell philosophical path, does touch on issues of quantum interpreta-
tion, thus it might also qualify as a step in the philosophical path. A subsequent
paper by Steane (1998) deals directly with EPR–Bell notions. The dates 1985–1995
associated with quantum computing in ﬁgure 1.3 takes into account the pre-

The approach taken to explain the physics is a generalized interferometric

The style of presentation is, by and large, a series of dedicated brief chapters,
albeit in this second edition some chapters are more extensive. The aim is to convey
in a focused style the essence of the subject at hand so as to offer the reader the
opportunity to contemplate the subject matter before moving to another topic. In
the ﬁrst part of the book the presentation is chronological.
Next, the titles of the chapters, beyond this introduction, are listed with a brief
explanation of their content.
Chapter 2, ‘Dirac’s physics’, provides a very brief description of Dirac’s pair
theory (Dirac 1930) followed by an introduction to Dirac’s bra ket notation (Dirac
1939). Both of these Dirac contributions went on to impact the ﬁeld of quantum
entanglement.
Chapter 3, ‘The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paper’, reviews the contribu-
tion of Einstein et al (1935) that was the genesis of the philosophical path to
quantum entanglement.
Chapter 4, ‘The Schrödinger papers’, reviews the Schrödinger papers that ﬁrst
mentioned the words entanglement and disentanglement in a quantum mechanical
framework (Schrödinger 1935, 1936).
Chapter 5, ‘Wheeler’s paper’, reviews the paper that provided the ﬁrst lucid and
transparent description, in words, of the iconic quantum entanglement experiment
(Wheeler 1946).
Chapter 6, ‘The probability amplitude for quantum entanglement’, introduces the
Pryce–Ward probability amplitude, ψ

Chapter 9, ‘The Bohm–Aharanov paper’, reviews the ﬁrst paper that brought
together the philosophical path, including aspects of local hidden variable theories,
and the physics path. This paper became an additional point of origin, apart from
EPR’s work, for the mainstream literature on quantum entanglement (Bohm and
Aharonov 1957).
Chapter 10, ‘Bell’s theorem’, reviews the paper that provided a modern trans-
parent proof that local hidden variable theories are incompatible with the predic-
tions of quantum mechanics (Bell 1964).
Chapter 11, ‘Feynman’s Hamiltonians’, it outlines Feynman’s contributions that
lead to equations of the form ψ

of the probability amplitude for quantum entanglement (Feynman et al 1965).
Chapter 12, ‘The second Wu quantum entanglement experiment’, reviews a paper
that recasts the quantum entanglement gamma ray scattering experiments in light of
Bell’s theorem (Kasday et al 1975).
Chapter 13, ‘The hidden variable theory experiments’, mentions efforts to extend
Bell’s theorem to make possible testing for local hidden variable theories in the
optical domain (Clauser et al 1969, Clauser and Horner 1974).
Chapter 14, ‘The optical quantum entanglement experiments’, describes the
experiments of Aspect et al (1981, 1982a, 1982b) that were initiated in an effort to
test for local hidden variable theories.
Chapter 15, ‘The quantum entanglement probability amplitude 1947–1992’,
reviews the various formats of ψ

amplitudes for

3, 6 from the N-slit interferometric perspective while using
Hamilton’s quaternions (Duarte 2015, 2016).

1.7 Intent
Today, there are many young engineers working on many of the aspects, and
applications, of quantum entanglement. Quantum mechanics works, the technology
works, and this is a wonderful quantum world. However, many questions persist on
the origin of and ‘mysteries’ of quantum entanglement. These ‘mysteries’ even
torment seasoned physicists. Albeit various books and reviews expose the subject,
they do so from a philosophical perspective, and they do so while introducing the

Chapter 2
Dirac’s physics
The little known contributions of Dirac to quantum entanglement are highlighted.
The Dirac bra ket notation, used throughout the monograph, is then introduced
from an interferometric perspective together with the Dirac identities relevant to
quantum entanglement and coherent emission.
2.1 Introduction
Paul Dirac made various titanic contributions to the development of quantum
mechanics (Dirac 1926, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930a, 1931). In addition to those well
known and celebrated contributions he also made two other contributions that would
eventually impact the physics of quantum entanglement tremendously, albeit at the
time of their disclosure the notion and the words quantum entanglement were neither
mentioned nor discussed. In other words, these were contributions silent on quantum
entanglement but destined to have a signiﬁcant future impact on this very ﬁeld.
In this chapter a brief description of Dirac’s pair theory is given while most of the
chapter is devoted to introduce quantum interference à la Dirac. The reason for this
approach will become self-evident in the main body of the book as it will become
evident that interference is at the foundations of quantum entanglement.
More on Dirac can be found in Kragh’s biography (Kragh 1990), Farmelo’s
biography (Farmelo 2009), and in a wonderful tribute book written by his
contemporaneous colleagues (Kursunoglu and Wigner 1987).
2.2 Dirac’s pair theory
In 1930 Dirac published a paper titled ‘On the annihilation of electrons and protons’
(Dirac 1930b). The theory based on this paper helped to elucidate Anderson’s
discovery on the creation of pairs of electrons and positrons by electromagnetic
radiation (Anderson 1932).
Dirac’s paper discusses the emission of two quanta as the result of an

(Dalitz and Duarte 2000), or

(Dombey 2021). In this regard, Dirac provided explicit expressions for the probability
of emission for a pair of quanta with orthogonal polarizations relative to each other.
Dirac refers to these quanta, with orthogonal polarizations, as the r-photon and the s-
photon and he describes the emission as ‘double spontaneous emission’ (Dirac 1930b).
This paper introduced the theoretical bases of what became known as the pair theory.
For quantum entanglement two quanta, γ1 and γ2, propagating in opposite directions,
each of which exhibit orthogonal linear polarizations, are necessary. That these two quanta
have orthogonal polarizations relative to each other was further highlighted by Wheeler
(1946) and was theoretically described by Pryce and Ward (1947) and Ward (1949).
2.3 Dirac’s notation
Dirac introduced a notational alternative to quantum mechanics in a paper titled ‘A
new notation for quantum mechanics’ (Dirac 1939). In this notation a ket vector is
denoted by ∣〉, and a bra vector is denoted by 〈∣. These vectors are mirror images of
each other. Thus the probability amplitude to go from the s plane to the d plane is
described by the bra ket 〈∣〉
d s which is a complex number. It is important to note that
the propagation from the s plane to the d plane is expressed in reverse by 〈∣〉
d s .
If the propagation of a single photon from plane s to plane d involves the passage
through an intermediate plane j then the probability amplitude becomes (Feynman
et al 1965)
〈∣〉= 〈∣〉〈∣〉
d s
d j
j s .
(2.1)
If there are N alternatives for j as in the case of a transmission diffraction grating,
that is
=
j
N
1, 2, 3...
, then an N-slit interferometer is conﬁgured (as illustrated in
ﬁgure 2.1) and the corresponding probability amplitude becomes

d s

Figure 2.1. Schematic conﬁguration to describe single-photon propagation from plane s to d, via the transmission
interferometric plane j . Plane j is conﬁgured by an array on N-slits. Interference takes place between plane j and the
interferometric, or detection, plane d. The intra-interferometric distance from plane j to x is denoted as
〈∣〉
D d j . This
schematic is also applicable to illumination by a population of indistinguishable photons.

At this stage it should be indicated that equation (2.2) represents far more than a
notational alternative. It is a highly utilitarian and profound statement in statistical
physics as will become apparent in later chapters of this book. In this monograph
equation (2.2) is referred to as the Dirac–Feynman interferometric principle.
The distance from the plane s to j is denoted as
〈∣〉
D j s while the interferometric distance
from plane j to d is denotes as
〈∣〉
D d j . If a further intermediate plane k, in addition to j, is
introduced, as illustrated in ﬁgure 2.2, then the probability amplitude becomes

Mathematical terminology: it is often said by mathematicians that the space
formed by bra and ket vectors is a Hilbert space. However, as pointed out by Dirac
himself, ‘the bra and ket vectors that we now use form a more general space than a
Hilbert space’ (Dirac 1958). From a pragmatic perspective what is important is that
the probability amplitudes conﬁgured by the bra ket notation are imaginary
numbers and also obey vector rules (see chapter 22 and appendix E).
Figure 2.2. Schematic conﬁguration to describe single-photon propagation from plane s to d, via the
transmission interferometric planes j and k. Planes j and k are conﬁgured by N-slits arrays. Measurable
interference takes place between plane k and the interferometric, or detection, plane d. The intra-interfero-
metric distances are denoted by
〈∣〉
D k j
and

2.4 Dirac’s notation in N-slit interferometers
In his book Dirac refers directly to practical, workable, macroscopic interferom-
etry using quantum principles. He refers to a monochromatic beam composed of a
large number of photons. A single photon in this beam is ‘split’ and then they are
made to interfere. It is in this discussion that he made his famous statement ‘each
photon then interferes only with itself’ (Dirac 1958). His description is perfectly
applicable to a population of indistinguishable photons as would be the case of
interference using a single-transverse-mode single-longitudinal-mode narrow-line-
width laser (Duarte 2003).

The reader should note that the interferometric equations (2.5), (2.12), and (2.14)
are completely equivalent. These interferometric equations are probabilities.
Equation (2.5) is directly applicable to single-photon propagation whilst equations
(2.12) and (2.14), although applicable to single-photon propagation, are also
applicable to the propagation of populations of indistinguishable photons or ensem-
bles of indistinguishable photons. Populations of indistinguishable photons are
available from highly coherent sources such as single-transverse-mode single-
longitudinal-mode narrow-linewidth lasers. The reader should also be aware that
of this interferometric trinity, equation (2.14) is sometimes confused with the
equations of intensity used in classical interference optics since (2.14) does not
display complex notation given the use of identity (2.13). This topic is elucidated
further in appendix appendix B.
On illumination: ‘all the indistinguishable photons illuminate the array of N-slits,
or grating, simultaneously. If only one photon propagates, at any given time, then

that individual photon illuminates the whole array of N slits simultaneously.’
(Duarte 2003).
The application of the Dirac notation to practical interferometric systems is
described by Duarte (1993). Explicit and extensive discussions in a review style are
given by Duarte (2014, 2015).

It should be re-emphasized that this explicit series of interferometric probabilities or
the generalized superposition quantum probabilities given in equations (2.5), (2.12), and
(2.14) can be applied to either explain measured interferometric proﬁles or to predict
interferometric measurements well in advance. This has been amply demonstrated with
populations of indistinguishable quanta (Duarte 1993, 1995). This also extends to
illumination with a single photon where the pixels, or charges, will develop within the
proﬁles allowed by these superposition quantum probabilities. The generalized inter-
ferometric probability equations have been programmed in Fortran 77, Visual Fortran,
and Matlab (Duarte 1993, Duarte et al 2013). For calculations involving large numbers
of slits, up to
=
N
2000, Fortran is preferred for its superior computational speed. For
measured and predicted interferometric proﬁles see chapter 27 and references therein.
2.6 The interferometric probability in 2D and 3D

Note: the book by Dirac titled The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, which is
extensively used as a reference in this book, was ﬁrst published in 1930. The bra ket
notation was incorporated in its third edition (1947). Here the fourth edition (1958)
is being used. It is interesting to note that in his introductory paper on the subject,
Dirac does not explain the origin of his bra ket notation. In the year 2000 I asked
Richard Dalitz, a noted particle physicist who took lectures from Dirac at
Cambridge and interacted with him for years, if Dirac ever explained how he
came about his quantum notation. His answer was… ‘no’ (Dalitz 2000).

2.7 Semi-coherent interference
Equations (2.5), (2.12), and (2.14) apply to single-photon interference and interfer-
ence using a population of indistinguishable photons which is equivalent to
interference whilst utilizing a narrow-linewidth laser. As discussed by Duarte
(2014, 2015) semi-coherent interference can be mathematically represented by

Physically, the meaning of a semi-coherent measurement is that the detector
registers an interferometric pattern for a given photon of a deﬁne wavelength, λ1 lets
say, and then a different patter for λ2, and so on. The overall measurement is a
cumulative interferometric pattern corresponding to λ

(also, see chapter
30). This explains why the interferograms derived from semi-coherent illumination
are broader and less deﬁned than the sharp interferograms recorded using highly
coherent radiation such as narrow-linewidth laser illumination (Duarte 2015).
2.8 From quantum probabilities to measurable intensities
In quantum mechanics probability amplitudes, and wave functions, exist in the
mathematical realm. Dyson called this the ﬁrst layer of quantum mechanics (Dyson
2007). The second layer of quantum mechanics deals with probabilities, polar-
izations, and intensities. These are the measurables.
It should be re-emphasized that the generalized interferometric equations, as
given in equations (2.5), (2.12), (2.14), (2.20), and (2.21), are probabilities. As
explained in the literature (Duarte 2004, 2014) these equations correspond to spatial
probability distributions that determine the spatial boundaries for the arrival of
quanta at the interference plane or detection surface. The arrival of an individual
photon, with an energy
ν
=
E
h , is registered at the detector by the creation of a
charge within the spatial boundaries of the probability distribution 〈∣〉〈∣〉
⁎
d s d s . For
the case of populations of indistinguishable photons a cumulative charge distribu-
tion within the spatial boundaries of 〈∣〉〈∣〉
⁎
d s d s
is registered at the detector (Duarte
2004). This cumulative charge distribution is what the experimenter observes as the
spatial pattern of the photon count or the spatial distribution of the intensity.
Furthermore, following Feynman et al (1965) and Lamb and colleagues (Sargent
et al 1974) it can be shown that the spatial intensity distribution, at a given frequency
ν, is proportional to the spatial probability distribution〈∣〉〈∣〉

2.9 Interferometric calculations and quantum coherence
As mentioned previously there is ample experimental evidence of excellent agreement
between measured N-slit interferograms and predicted interferograms via equation (2.27)
in the
⩽
⩽
N
2
2000 range under illumination via ensembles of indistinguishable photons
(Duarte 1993, 2014, 2016). Coherent emission characterized by highly directional
emission and high-visibility interferograms has been observed from electrically pumped
organic semiconductors, as documented in ﬁgures 2.4 to 2.7 (Duarte et al 2005). The
active medium in the organic semiconductor is Alq3 doped with the laser dye coumarin
545 tetramethyl (Duarte et al 2006, Duarte and Vaeth 2018, Chen et al 1988).
Using the probabilistic version of equation (2.27), that is equation (2.14), the
predicted interferograms for
=
N
2 is given in ﬁgure 2.8. In this theoretical
interferogram the separation of the two secondary peaks is Δ
≈

490 μm which
should be compared to Δ

The measured visibility from the electrically pumped organic semiconductor

laser, at λ = 543.30 nm it is

this high coherence is explained in the next section.
2.10 Dirac’s identities
In this section a few of Dirac’s notational identities, useful to the subject at hand, are
listed. Notation was an extraordinarily important topic in Dirac’s physics and he was
meticulous and highly precise in the equations he wrote. Here, these identities are
collected from various sections of Dirac’s book and are compiled roughly in the same
order as presented by Duarte (2014) where a more complete set of identities is presented.
In the best style of Dirac, no attempt is made to explain any of this:

Indistinguishability is highlighted, albeit in Dirac’s description they are labeled
with distinct numbers

as (2.49), by ﬁrst considering a single photon in different states. More explicitly,

An extension of Dirac’s identities lead directly to the description of ensembles
of indistinguishable quanta in an identical state of polarization. For instance, the

Hence, Dirac-type identities can be applied to describe single-transverse-mode
single-longitudinal-mode coherent emission of indistinguishable quanta including
both ∣〉
x and ∣〉
y states of polarization.
These identities describe precisely and elegantly what coherent emission is at a
very fundamental level: ensembles of indistinguishable quanta in a given state of
polarization (Duarte and Taylor 2022). This perspective is in line with Dirac’s
assertion that ‘with Bose statistics the probability of two particles being in the same
state is greater than with classical statistics’ (Dirac 1958). In the case of optical
quantum entanglement the word particles should be replaced by quanta. The
detection statistics of states with n indistinguishable bosons, in other words n
indistinguishable quanta, is discussed by Feynman et al (1965). Understanding this
concept allows one to provide a transparent explanation of highly coherent emission
from electrically excited organic semiconductors integrated within interferometric
conﬁgurations (Duarte et al 2005, Duarte and Vaeth 2018, Duarte and Taylor 2022).
Duarte and Taylor (2021) observe that Dirac did not provide a derivation for the
determinant (2.50). However, an array of

Chapter 3
The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paper
The famous Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) paper, suggesting that quantum
mechanics is an incomplete theory, is discussed in the context of quantum
entanglement. The EPR argument is examined directly under the premises of p ±
Δp measurements and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle Δx Δp ≈h. Also,
Einstein’s deﬁnition of a correct theory is quoted.
3.1 Introduction
The EPR paper titled ‘Can quantum mechanical description of physical reality be
considered complete?’ (Einstein et al 1935) is one of the most cited papers in physics.
In it Einstein and colleagues question the suitability of the wave function, which is
synonymous to the probability amplitude, to provide a complete description of
physical reality.
The EPR paper is also the most cited paper in the ﬁeld of quantum entanglement.
Therefore, in this chapter the EPR paper is revisited and its main questions and
teachings are restated in an effort to transparently highlight its signiﬁcance.
It should be noted that in the EPR paper no mention is made of the words
‘quantum entanglement’. The genius of the EPR paper was to consider two quantum
systems that interact in an initial
⩽
⩽
t
T
0
time frame and cease to interact at times
>
t
T. As it will be explained in the following chapters the association of EPR with
the polarization entanglement of two quanta propagating in opposite directions
would come later via Bohm (1951) and Bohm and Aharanov (1957).
3.2 EPR’s doubts on quantum mechanics
By far the main concern of Einstein as expressed in the EPR paper was that the wave
function ψ did not provide a complete description of the physical reality. Since ψ has
the same physical meaning as the probability amplitude then it is reasonable to
assume that Einstein’s doubts also extended to the probability amplitude.

The EPR paper is divided in two segments. In the ﬁrst segment EPR conclude:
‘when the momentum of the particle is known, its coordinate has no physical
reality…’ (see ﬁgure 3.1) and next they pose the alternative that either ‘(1) the
quantum mechanical description of reality given by the wave function is not
complete or (2) when the operators corresponding to two physical quantities do
not commute the two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality’ (Einstein et al
1935).
The second section of the EPR paper which is directly relevant to quantum
entanglement situations can be succinctly summarized via their argument that as a
result of two sequential measurements performed on a ﬁrst system the second system
is left in two different states. They then emphasize that since the systems were not
interacting with each other no ‘real change’ can be induced over the second system
by the measurements conducted on the ﬁrst system (Einstein et al 1935).
Furthermore, EPR consider two systems while assigning the quantities P and Q
to the second system. Here, their conclusion is that P and Q depend on the
measurements performed in the ﬁrst system which is decoupled from the second
system, see ﬁgure 3.2. Hence they conclude: ‘No reasonable description of reality
could be expected to permit this’ (Einstein et al 1935).
In summary, Einstein et al (1935) articulate a clear and explicitly skepticism on
the predictions of quantum mechanics.
Figure 3.1. The EPR argument: ‘when the momentum of the particle is known, its coordinate has no physical
reality…’ (Einstein et al 1935). In other words this means that when the uncertainty in the measurement of p is
inﬁnitesimally small, that is Δ
≈
p
0, the uncertainty in x, that is Δx, is unmeasurably large.
Figure 3.2. The quantities P and Q in system II depend on measurements MP and MQ performed in system I:
‘No reasonable description of reality could be expected to permit this’ (Einstein et al 1935). Note: in this
chapter x is used to denote distance since it is compatible with Δ Δ
≈
x p
h. In other chapters x is used to
describe polarization in the ∣〉
x state. Distance is assigned by parameters such as
〈∣〉
D d j .

3.2.1 EPR’s deﬁnition of a correct theory
Beyond the discussion of the effect of one quantum system up on a second separated,
and even distant, quantum system, EPR provides a lucid and landmark deﬁnition of
what a theory should be: ‘The correctness of the theory is judged by the degree of
agreement between the conclusions of the theory and human experience. This
experience… in physics takes the form of experiment and measurement’ (Einstein
et al 1935). In this book this deﬁnition will be referred to as ‘EPR’s deﬁnition of a
correct theory’.
3.3 Transparent resolution of the EPR ‘paradox’
Albeit Einstein did not refer to the EPR paper as the ‘EPR paradox’; this is post-
EPR terminology that became widely used in the literature following the work of
Bohm (1951).
The contents of the EPR paper (Einstein et al 1935) were challenged by Niels
Bohr also in a paper titled ‘Can quantum mechanical description of physical reality
be considered complete?’ (Bohr 1935). In that six page paper Bohr centered his
argument on Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (Heisenberg 1927)
Δ Δ
≈
x p
h
(3.1)
and on the complementarity principle. The Bohr argument, albeit extensive,
apparently failed to convince sectors within the physics community that continued
to doubt the completeness of quantum mechanics for decades. Nevertheless, Bohr
invoked the two crucial words that lead to the one equation that can be applied to
neutralize the EPR argument: the uncertainty principle.
In this regard, it should be mentioned that Dirac already in the 1947 edition of
his celebrated book included a hint of extraordinary signiﬁcance: ‘it is evident
physically that a state for which all values of q are equally probable, or one for
which all values of p are equally probable, cannot be attained in practice’ (Dirac
1958).
Alternative forms of the uncertainty principle are (Duarte 2003)

(3.3)
In the next section a direct and straightforward resolution of the ‘EPR paradox’ is
provided.
3.3.1 EPR and the uncertainty principle
There is a key sentence in the ﬁrst part of the EPR paper: ‘When the momentum of a
particle is known, its coordinate has no physical reality’ (Einstein et al 1935), see
ﬁgure 3.1. A direct and transparent confrontation of this central concept with the
uncertainty principle leads to a crucial result. The explicit argument that follows is
based on concepts previously articulated by Duarte (2014).
Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement (Second Edition)
3-3

Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle Δ Δ
≈
x p
h stated in its alternative fractional
form (Feynman et al 1965) is
Δ
≈Δ
x
h
p .
(3.4)
Measurement of the momentum of a particle p can only be performed according to
± Δ
p
p.
(3.5)
An absolutely exact measurement of momentum p with Δ
=
p
0 is physically
impossible (Duarte 2014). In this regard, it should be mentioned that uncertainties and
errors in measurements have been known to exist since the dawn of physics (Newton
1687, 1704). The EPR sentence ‘when the momentum of a particle is known, its
coordinate has no physical reality’ (Einstein et al 1935) implies an exact and perfect
measurement of momentum p with Δ
=
p
0, which is a physical impossibility.
A real non-idealized measurement of momentum leads to
± Δ
p
p with a speciﬁc
and real non-zero Δp. Once Δp is available then Δx can be found according to
Δ
≈Δ
x
h
p .
In this regard, the ‘all values’ spread in the coordinate, as feared by Einstein et al
(1935), is not allowed. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 3.3. Removal of the ‘all values’
spread in the coordinate x immediately neutralizes the claim of ‘no physical reality’.
Hence, the EPR conclusion that ‘the quantum mechanical description of physical
reality … is not complete’ can be dismissed.
Here, it has been shown that Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle can be effectively
applied in a direct and transparent manner to counter EPR’s ‘all values’ argument
for Δx that led those authors to the conclusion that the description of reality as given
by wave functions, or probability amplitudes, ‘is not complete’. In this regard, ‘the
uncertainty principle protects quantum mechanics’ (Feynman et al 1965).
The dismissal of the EPR argument, or the ‘EPR paradox’, as referred to by many
authors, has a profound meaning since it was the EPR argument that led to the
formulation of ‘hidden variable theories’ as presented by Bohm and colleagues
(Bohm 1952, Bohm and Bub 1966) and the eventual introduction of Bell’s theorem
(Bell 1964). This theme is given further latitude in chapters 10, 29 and 30.
Figure 3.3. When the momentum of the particle is measured, it is measured as
± Δ
p
p with a ﬁnite non-zero
value for Δp. Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle Δ Δ
≈
x p
h then leads to a ﬁnite ‘non all values’ spread in the
coordinate x, that is Δx. The ‘all values’ Δx, as feared by EPR, does not occur.

Chapter 4
The Schrödinger papers
The Schrödinger papers that introduced the words ‘entanglement’ and ‘disentangle-
ment’, in the context of quantum mechanics and the EPR paper, are discussed.
4.1 Introduction
In 1935 and 1936 Schrödinger wrote two sequential papers on separated systems in
reference to the EPR paper (Einstein et al 1935). It is in his ﬁrst paper that
Schrödinger introduced the concept of entanglement and the word itself: entangle-
ment (Schrödinger 1935). The second paper is a follow up to the ﬁrst paper
(Schrödinger 1936). Neither paper refers to entangled polarization states of
counter-propagating quanta.
4.2 The first Schrödinger paper
The ﬁrst Schrödinger paper is titled ‘Discussion of probability relations between
separated systems’ (Schrödinger 1935). In it, Schrödinger provides a philosophical,
and also physical, discussion of two separated systems that are entangled and does
reference the EPR paper. In this regard, he uses the word ‘disconcerting’ to describe
the fact that there is no independence between systems that were initially entangled
and that are no longer in physical proximity: ‘after re-establishing one ψ-function…
the other one can be inferred simultaneously’ (Schrödinger 1935). Lack of inde-
pendence is associated with the fact that measurements in one system determine the
wave function in the other system. And then Schrödinger adds: ‘It is rather
discomforting that the theory should allow a system to be steered or piloted into
one or the other type of state at the experimenter’s mercy in spite of his having no
access to it’ (see ﬁgure 4.1).
This 1935 Schrödinger paper makes no mention of entangled polarizations of two
counter-propagating quanta.

4.3 The second Schrödinger paper
The second Schrödinger paper is titled ‘Probability relations between separated
systems’ (Schrödinger 1936). In it, Schrödinger extends and reafﬁrms the nature of
the discussion initiated in his ﬁrst paper and points to the current interpretation of
quantum mechanics that ‘obliges’ physicists to accept that, in a situation involving a
system with two separated parts, performance of an experimenter’s measurement on
one part (part I) determines the state or wave function of the other part (part II) of
the system. He further highlights the fact that the effect described above occurs in the
absence of a direct interaction (‘non-interference’ as he writes†) with part II by the
experimenter performing the measurement on part I. Speciﬁcally, the effect alluded
by Schrödinger is that the state or wave function at part II of the system depends
directly on the measurement performed by the experimenter on part I. Thus he states
that the experimenter conducting measurements at part I ‘controls [the] future state’
of part II of the system without ‘touching’ it (Schrödinger 1936). He continues to
add: ‘In this paper it will be shown that the control, with the indirect measurement, is
in general not only as complete but even more complete’.
Furthermore, this 1936 Schrödinger paper makes no mention of entangled
polarizations of two counter-propagating quanta.
Figure 4.1. (a) According to Schrödinger, at ﬁrst systems I and II are entangled. (b) Following disentangle-
ment, once the wave function in system II, ψ
+

, is determined, the wave function in system I, ψ
−
(
)
II
, can be
‘inferred simultaneously’, or vice versa.
† Note that the word interference has a deﬁnite and crucial meaning in quantum physics (Feynman et al 1965).
In the reasoning by Schrödinger the word ‘non-interference’ is being utilized as synonymous of ‘non-
interacting’ and in the absence of physical contact and not in the context quantum interference as deﬁned
by Dirac (1958) and Feynman et al (1965).

Chapter 5
Wheeler’s paper
The 1946 paper by Wheeler, based on Dirac’s pair theory, is introduced. Wheeler’s
paper provided the ﬁrst clear and transparent written description of what quantum
entanglement really is and it did so without using the word ‘entanglement’.
5.1 Introduction
John Archival Wheeler was familiar with Dirac’s pair theory (Dirac 1930) and he
was the ﬁrst to elucidate in clear and transparent English what quantum entangle-
ment is. Wheeler’s paper is a signiﬁcant contribution to what would eventually
become the ﬁeld of quantum entanglement even though he did not did use the word
‘entanglement’ in his paper. He was also the ﬁrst to suggest, in prose, an
experimental conﬁguration to test Dirac’s pair theory (Wheeler 1946). In this regard,
Wheeler’s paper was essential to initiate the purely physical developments of
quantum entanglement, devoid of philosophical arguments, that would lead to the
discovery of the correct probability amplitude for quantum entanglement (Pryce and
Ward 1947, Ward 1949).
5.2 Wheeler’s paper significance to quantum theory
Wheeler’s paper was titled ‘Polyelectrons’ (Wheeler 1946). In his paper on electron–
positron annihilation Wheeler explained that the dominant mechanism of annihi-
lation was
γγ
→
+ −
e e
involving singlet states. A further important condition is that
the pairs, prior to annihilation, should have zero relative angular momentum.
Wheeler added that there is an analogous polarization phenomenon in the γγ pair
created by the
+ −
e e annihilation. Following this preamble Wheeler added the crucial
and transparent paragraph that describes the pure essence of quantum entangle-
ment: ‘According to the pair theory, if one of these photons is linearly polarized in
one plane, then the photon that goes off in the opposite direction with equal
momentum is linearly polarized in the perpendicular plane’ (Wheeler 1946). This
concept is illustrated in ﬁgure 5.1.
doi:10.1088/978-0-7503-5269-7ch5
5-1
ª IOP Publishing Ltd 2022

Here it should be noted that the explicit theory behind Wheeler’s statement had
not been disclosed. Also, it was that crucial statement that guided Pryce and Ward to
derive the probability amplitude for quantum entanglement and to correctly
calculate the superposition probability for quantum entanglement of two quanta
(Pryce and Ward 1947, Ward 1949).
It should also be mentioned that Wheeler’s paper did not refer to the philosoph-
ical arguments being developed in parallel, on quantum entanglement, by Einstein
and Schrödinger (Einstein et al 1935, Schrödinger 1935).
5.3 Wheeler’s paper significance to quantum experiments
Furthermore, the Wheeler paper provided a non-schematic guide to a proposed
annihilation-scattering experiment to test Dirac’s pair theory. In it he describes a
source that generates simultaneous quanta, with energy mc2, in opposite directions
via the annihilation of positrons. At the end of each emission channel a selective
photon scatterer is deployed prior to a photon counter. The angular position of the
counters can be varied at will and coincidences are recorded when the angular
orientation of the counters are identical and orthogonal to each other (Wheeler
1946).
The description above served as an explicit guide to Pryce and Ward (1947) to
provide the ﬁrst experimental diagram to compare the theory of quantum entangle-
ment to experimental data (Pryce and Ward 1947). All subsequent optical experi-
ments followed the same conﬁgurational strategy except that the scatters are
replaced by polarization analyzers and it is the polarizer analyzers that are rotated
rather than the photon counters.
5.4 A theoretical opportunity
Starting from the
γγ
→
+ −
e e
1 2 concept, Wheeler did perform the calculation for the
cross sections scattering ratio of γ1 and γ2. He calculated an optimum ratio of 1.1 at a
scattering angle of 74°3′ (Wheeler 1946). As will be explained in chapter 6, Ward re-
did the calculation and arrived at an optimum ratio of 2.82 at a scattering angle of
82° (Pryce and Ward 1947). The discrepancy in these calculations were the result of
Wheeler’s omission of the ‘interference terms’ (Ward 1949).

emitted in the +k and −k directions. If γ1 is polarized in the ∣〉
x state, then γ2 is polarized in the ∣〉

other words, the emitted quanta exhibit polarizations orthogonal to each other.

6.1 Introduction
This chapter focuses on the works of Pryce and Ward (1947) and Ward (1949). The
work of these physicists was inspired by the paper of Wheeler (1946). A relevant
historical note here is that John Clive Ward was the doctoral student of Maurice
Henry Lecorney Pryce, who was a student of Ralph Howard Fowler. Fowler was
also the doctoral supervisor of Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac. This note hints at the
quantum mechanics knowledge path that greatly beneﬁted a young J C Ward born
in 1924.
The background to this historical development begins, as explained by Dombey
(2021), with Pryce asking Ward to verify Wheeler’s calculation (Wheeler 1946) on
the scattering probabilities of a pair of correlated quanta.
6.2 The Pryce–Ward paper
The Pryce–Ward paper, inspired by the previous work of Wheeler (1946), is a
remarkable and succinct publication about half a page long, on the emission from
positron–electron annihilation yielding two quanta (γ1 and γ2), with orthogonal
polarizations, emitted in opposite directions (+k and −k) (Dirac 1930). This process
can be best illustrated by (Dalitz and Duarte 2000)

The Pryce and Ward paper came from the Dirac–Wheeler route in the complete
absence of philosophical concerns and without using the word entanglement. The
work was initiated when Pryce asked Ward to verify Wheeler’s calculation (Ward
2004, Dombey 2021).
Here, the theoretical and experimental signiﬁcance of this paper are examined.
The Pryce–Ward contribution is analyzed from a historical perspective in appendix A.
6.2.1 Theoretical legacy of the Pryce–Ward paper
The Pryce–Ward paper is all about providing a theoretical expression to predict the
angular correlation of the polarizations of quanta γ1 and γ2 propagating in the
opposite directions +k and −k, as illustrated in ﬁgure 6.1. For completeness it
should be indicated that this condition of counter propagation, on the same optical
axis, fulﬁls the condition of having opposite momenta via ∣∣= ℏ
p
k, where k is the
wave number.
Since this was not an experiment in the visible-near-infrared region of the
electromagnetic spectrum, scatterers rather than polarizers were used thus making
the experimental–theoretical interaction far more complex than the optical experi-
ments of this class that followed in the 1980s and afterwards. In reference to
ﬁgure 6.1 Pryce and Ward derived the differential double cross section as

It should be emphasized that it is the superposition probability for quantum
entanglement, that is equation (6.6), that provides the numerical probability of
quantum entanglement experiments and the numerical values entered into Bell’s
inequality. Very few realize that this physics was provided by Pryce and Ward
(1947).
The ﬁnal theoretical result for the scattering quantum entanglement experiment,
that is equation (6.3), depends on an intermediate step. It is this intermediate
equation, absolutely necessary to arrive at equation (6.3), that gathers the attention
of physicist today. In the absence of further comments that equation is the
superposition probability amplitude of two quanta (γ1 and γ2) propagating in
opposite directions with entangled polarizations in the states ∣〉

For some reason, Pryce and Ward chose not to disclose this intermediate step in
their 1947 paper and Ward never bothered to dedicate a paper to this subject which
was one of several topics in his doctoral thesis (Ward 1949).
The theoretical result of Pryce and Ward was quickly conﬁrmed by the
independent work of American physicists Snyder et al (1948) and was also
independently reproduced by a young Australian physicist, Richard Henry Dalitz,
a recent arrival to England at the time (Ward 2004), who would later become known
by his contributions to particle physics including the early research on quarks, the
Dalitz plot, and the Dalitz pairs.
6.2.2 Experimental legacy of the Pryce–Ward paper
The three experiments that veriﬁed the quantum scattering theory of Pryce and
Ward (1947) adopted experimental conﬁgurations derived from the schematics

disclosed by these authors that in turn were inspired by Wheeler’s written proposal
(Wheeler 1946). It is also apparent that since this experimental approach involved
scattering prior to detection, it depends on four angular quantities θ1, θ2, φ1, and φ2.
An experiment in the optical domain, in the absence of scatterers, would only
depend on two polarization angles, φ1 and φ2, measured on the plane perpendicular
to the propagation axis. This modiﬁcation requires a simpliﬁed apparatus as
outlined in ﬁgure 6.2.
6.3 Ward’s doctoral thesis
J C Ward wrote a ‘47 page’ doctoral thesis that was divided in two parts and
included a total of eight chapters and three appendices. Two of the chapters and two
of the appendices in the ﬁrst part refer to the topic at hand.
Ward adopted a heuristic approach, based on conservation of momentum
arguments, toward his derivation of the probability amplitude for two counter
propagating quanta, along a common optical axis, with entangled orthogonal
polarizations in the states ∣〉
x and ∣〉
y
(Ward 1949). The concept of singlet states,
probably adopted from Wheeler’s description (Wheeler 1946), was also important.
In this regard, Ward initiates his exposition by stating: ‘Wheeler proceeded to
calculate… But through the neglect of interference terms he derived an incorrect…
far too small value for the angular correlations…’ (Ward 1949).
In his explanation on the derivation of equation (6.3) Ward wrote: ‘it is essential
to derive correctly the state vector which properly describes the state of the two
quanta’ (Ward 1949). Thus in his own approach Ward began by listing polarization
state alternatives for the x and y polarization axes related to two counter
propagating photons:

Attaching the numeral 1 to the photon associated to the ﬁrst coordinate x and the
numeral 2 to the photon associated with the second coordinate y then these states
can be rewritten as

are the polarization angles measured on a plane perpendicular to the propagation axis while d1 and d2 are the
corresponding detectors.

Ward then explains that the ‘combined system then split up into a single state
antisymmetrical in both polarization and momenta coordinates’. He then considers
the triplet states and concludes that ‘only the singlet state and the zero angular
momentum state from the triplet conﬁguration are admissible’. In summary, Ward
settles for the antisymmetrical singlet state

7.2 The quantum entanglement experiment
The Pryce–Ward probability amplitude equation describes the following physics:
1. Two quanta are involved: quanta 1 and quanta 2 which for historical reasons
are assigned as γ1 and γ2.
2. These two quanta, γ1 and γ2, propagate collinearly along the z-axis in opposite
directions.
3. Albeit these quanta are labeled as γ1 and γ2, they are indistinguishable in the
frequency domain.

Polarizers and detectors only serve as necessary, yet secondary, elements to verify
the physics of the quantum entanglement probability amplitude. As will be seen in
the next chapter, the ﬁrst experiments and measurements in the ﬁeld of quantum
entanglement were performed using gamma rays. The utilization of gamma rays
forced the experimenters to rely on Compton scattering to measure the polarization
coincidences.
7.3 Historical notes
The following observations are in order:
1. Albeit this is the essence of quantum entanglement, the word ‘entanglement’
was not used in the Pryce–Ward writings (Pryce and Ward 1947, Ward
1949).
2. The essential features of the schematics of ﬁgures 7.1 and 7.2 can be also
distilled from the outlines including scattering features disclosed by Pryce
and Ward (Pryce and Ward 1947, Ward 1949).
3. As it turns out, historical developments relegated equations (7.1) and (7.2) to
the background for a long time, as most of the attention focused on the EPR
argument, hidden variable theories, and Bell’s theorem.

The annihilation quantum entanglement
experiments
The ﬁrst quantum entanglement experiments (1948–1950) utilizing quanta pairs
created in the
γγ

e e
1 2 annihilation process and Compton scattering detection are
described. These experiments yielded reasonable to good agreement with the
quantum theory results predicted by Pryce and Ward (1947).
8.1 Introduction
This chapter focuses on the positron–electron annihilation experiments

performed in the 1948–1950 period, in the United States and England, by Bleuler
and Bradt (1948), Hanna (1948), and Wu and Shaknov (1950). These were all very
brief communications, or letters, contained in one page or less. Two of these papers
refer to Wheeler (1946) and all three refer to Pryce and Ward (1947).
Gamma rays demand special propagation and detection optics given their
extremely high frequency, ν ≈
×
300
1018 Hz (or λ ≈
×
−
1
10 3 nm). One additional
observation is that the gamma rays emitted in the
+ −
e e
annihilation, γ1 and γ2, are
labeled as such to indicate that they are a pair integrated by two quanta, propagating
in opposite directions. Given perfect correlation these quanta have identical, or
nearly identical frequencies so that ν

2. In other words, perfect
correlation in the frequency domain implies that these two quanta are indistinguish-
able in their emission frequency.
8.2 The first three quantum entanglement experiments
Soon after the publication of the Pryce–Ward theory, and their experimental
schematics, two experimental conﬁrmations followed in Nature. The ﬁrst conﬁrma-
tion was by Bleuler and Bradt (1948) and the second was by Hanna (1948).

A third paper on this subject matter, including a more decisive agreement between
the polarization-correlation theory and measurements, would be published by Wu
and Shaknov (1950).
Common to the three experiments was the use of a Cu64 annihilation radiation
source, λ ≈
×
−
2.42
10 3 nm (Dumond et al 1949), prepared by deuteron radiation.
The gamma ray quanta (γ1 and γ2) thus produced were incident on aluminum
scatterers. In addition to aluminum scatterers, Hanna (1948) also utilized brass
scatterers. As detectors, Bleuler and Bradt (1948) and Hanna (1948) used Geiger
counters. Wu and Shaknov (1950), on the other hand, used scintillation counters
known to have an efﬁciency ten times better than Geiger counters.
All three experiments were slightly different in their measurement conﬁgurations.
They used the Pryce–Ward cross section equation, slightly re-expressed as

subsequent literature these quantities appear again and again without reference to its

The aim of the early quantum entanglement experimetalists was to measure the

generic depiction of these experiments is given in ﬁgure 8.1.
Table 8.1 lists the results reported in these experiments while using aluminum
scatterers. Listed theoretical values apply to the respective geometrical conﬁgura-
tions used in each of the experiments.
The better agreement between theory and experiment reported by Wu and
Shaknov (1950) is most likely due to the signiﬁcant superiority of scintillation
counters over Geiger counters for this class of experiment.

It is signiﬁcant to point out that following the publication of these results there
was a long silence in the physics community on this subject. Perhaps an implicit
agreement that this issue had been settled and that experimental measurements of
counter-propagating quanta with polarizations orthogonal to each other did agree
with quantum mechanics. More on this in the discussion on interpretations of
quantum mechanics (chapter 30).
One further point is that the three experiments considered here utilized exper-
imental conﬁgurations derived from the schematics disclosed by Pryce and Ward
(1947), which in turn was inspired by Wheeler’s written proposal (Wheeler 1946). It
is also obvious that since this experimental approach involved scattering prior to

detection, it depended on four angular quantities θ1, θ2, φ1, and φ2 as illustrated in
ﬁgure 8.1. A straightforward experiment in the optical domain, in the absence of
scatterers, would only depend on two polarization angles, φ1 and φ2, and thus would
lead to a simpliﬁed apparatus as already described in chapter 7. The reader should
note that in the literature, as time progressed, φ1 and φ2 also began to be assigned as
θ1 and θ2 to indicate the polarization angles measured on the plane perpendicular to
the propagation axis. A generalized simpliﬁed experimental schematics applicable to
these observations is outlined in ﬁgure 8.2. It should also be mentioned that for
maximum correlation the frequency of the two quanta should be the same
frequency, or ν

8.3 Further significance of the annihilation experiments
Beyond the experimental signiﬁcance outlined above, these three homologous
experiments had a more profound effect on the physics of quantum entanglement:
they pioneered experimental efforts in quantum entanglement measurements and
provided an experimental avenue to researchers interested in EPR situations.
Indeed, Bohm and Aharonov (1957) include the paper by Wu and Shaknov (1950)
in their section titled ‘Experiment verifying the paradox of ERP’ (note that due to
an apparent typo they wrote ERP rather than EPR). In this paper Bohm and
Aharonov discuss verifying whether the two counter-propagating quanta are
polarized orthogonal to each other. In this regard they refer to the Wu and
Shaknov (1950) paper as measuring ‘essentially for this point, but in a more
indirect way’ (Bohm and Aharonov 1957). This topic is discussed further in
chapter 9.
One interesting caveat relevant to the annihilation experiments is that the ﬁrst two
experiments were largely ignored in the subsequent literature on the subject and only
the Wu and Shaknov experiment continued to be cited. Furthermore, the nature of
these citations was unenthusiastic and focused on perceived limitations of the
scattering approach. More speciﬁcally, it was stated that even though the Wu and
Shaknov results were ‘compatible with quantum mechanics’ the same results had not
‘produced evidence against hidden-variable theories’ (Clauser et al 1969).

Chapter 9
The Bohm and Aharonov paper
The signiﬁcance of the Bohm and Aharonov (1957) paper in bridging the
philosophical path and the physics path to quantum entanglement, by focusing
attention on the Wu and Shaknov (1950) paper, while also discussing hidden
variable theories, is made explicit.
9.1 Introduction
The Bohm and Aharonov (1957) paper played a crucial role in the ﬁeld of quantum
entanglement by presenting together the philosophical arguments developed by
Einstein et al (1935) and Schrödinger (1935) and the physics developed via the
Dirac–Wheeler–Pryce–Ward route (Dirac 1930, Wheeler 1946, Pryce and Ward
1947). However, of the papers mentioned above, it only referred to Einstein et al
(1935) and did not use the word ‘entanglement’.
Bohm and Aharonov’s paper was titled ‘Experiment verifying the paradox of
ERP’ and as its title suggests its main focus of interest was to advance a resolution of
what by then had already become known as the ‘EPR paradox’. Besides a discussion
of the philosophy of the situation, Bohm and Aharonov concentrate their attention
on the theoretical work of work of Snyder et al (1948) and the experimental results of
Wu and Shaknov (1950). The works of Pryce and Ward (1947), Bleuler and Bradt
(1948), and Hanna (1948) were not mentioned.
In their paper on spin physics Bohm and Aharonov (1957) consider a two-atom
molecule with total spin zero described by a probability amplitude of the form
ψ

ψ
=

Following dissociation of the atoms a component of the spin of atom 1 is measured:
‘because the total spin is still zero, it can be immediately be concluded that the same
component of the spin of the other particle (2) is opposite to that of 1’ (Bohm and
Aharonov 1957). These authors go on to indicate that, from their perspective, the
experimenter is ‘free to choose’ even before the measurement has taken place.
doi:10.1088/978-0-7503-5269-7ch9

ª IOP Publishing Ltd 2022

It should be noted that in the original manuscript A and B are used to designate the
particles rather than 1 and 2. The numbers 1 and 2 are used here since that is the
nomenclature used in equation (9.1).
Since the description given above does not ﬁt the classical perspective of
measurements on separate systems these authors advance the notion that: ‘per-
haps… there is some hidden interaction between 2 and 1, or between 2 and the
measuring apparatus’ (Bohm and Aharonov 1957).
Next they mention that there is an experiment, that of Wu and Shaknov (1950),
that shows that their proposed interpretation of the EPR paradox is ‘untenable’
(Bohm and Aharonov 1957).
As an editing note it should be mentioned that what Bohm and Aharonov call
‘ERP’ is in fact EPR, that is, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen.
9.2 Significance to the development of quantum entanglement
research
The paper of Bohm and Aharonov (1957) was signiﬁcant in that it, for the ﬁrst time,
brought together the philosophical perspective on quantum entanglement, as
articulated by Einstein et al (1935) and Schrödinger (1935), with the quantum
mechanics of the effect as presented by Snyder et al (1948) and Wu and Shaknov
(1950). In this regard, they refer to probability amplitudes of the form of equation
(9.1) and probability amplitudes of the form

On the experimental side Bohm and Aharonov refer to the EPR paradox and the
Wu and Shaknov (1950) experiment in their abstract: ‘there already is an experiment
whose signiﬁcance in regard to this problem has not yet been explicitly brought out’
only to moderate their stance later by expressing that the Wu and Shaknov
experiment provided relevant measurements ‘essentially for this point, but in a
more indirect way’ (Bohm and Aharonov 1957). Their discussion of the Wu and
Shaknov experiment went further and in the only experimental diagram of their
paper a reduced and stylized version of the Compton-scattering experimental
conﬁguration is provided.
What Bohm and Aharonov did not mention was the fact that the Pryce–Ward
probability amplitude (Ward 1949) is an essential step towards the derivation of the
cross section equation for scattering published by Pryce and Ward (1947) and
utilized by Wu and Shaknov in their comparison of their polarization coincidence
measurements with theory. If the measurements are done properly then they are a
correct validation of

Ward wrote: ‘it is essential to derive correctly the state vector which properly
describes the state of the two quanta’ (Ward 1949). That state vector is given in
equation (9.4).
One further contribution of the Bohm and Aharonov paper is the suggestion to
alter the settings of the measuring apparatus ‘even while the atoms are still in ﬂight’
(see ﬁgure 9.1).
9.3 Philosophy and physics
Bohm and Aharonov (1957) succeeded in shining a light on the fact that the
proposed resolutions of the EPR paradox invoking ‘hidden interactions’ (see, for
example, Bohm 1952) were at odds with ‘current quantum theory’. Indeed, John S
Bell (1964) would focus his attention on this very Bohm and Aharonov paper while
deriving his celebrated Bell inequalities, see chapter 10.
For the sake of completeness it should also be mentioned that Bohm, in his book
Quantum Theory (1951), did advance a direct one page argument titled ‘Proof that
quantum theory is incompatible with hidden variables’. In it, Bohm suggests that
hidden variables are incompatible with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.

Chapter 10
Bell’s theorem
Bell’s famous theorem is reviewed and presented in a straightforward style using
Bell’s notation. The signiﬁcance of Bell’s theorem reafﬁrming the incompatibility of
local hidden variable theories with quantum mechanics is highlighted.
10.1 Introduction
John S Bell’s paper, titled ‘On the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox’, was a
breakthrough in the interpretational arena of quantum mechanics. Bell’s paper
provided a mathematical mechanism that would transparently show that hidden
variable theories were incompatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics. In
his introduction Bell refers immediately to Einstein et al (1935) and their claim that
quantum mechanics was incomplete and should be ‘supplemented by additional
variables’. He then continues ‘that idea will be formulated mathematically and
shown to be incompatible with the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics’
(Bell 1964). In other words, hidden variable theories would be shown to be
incompatible with quantum mechanics. This mathematical statement became
known as either Bell’s theorem or Bell’s inequality.
He also mentions in his introduction that a hidden variable interpretation of
quantum mechanics had already been formulated by Bohm (1952). In the next
section of his paper he refers to the Bohm and Aharonov (1957) paper as providing
an outline to test the EPR argument in a quantum mechanical framework.
Two observations are in order here: ﬁrst, as already exposed in the previous
chapters, the outline considered by Bohm and Aharonov (1957) did include knowl-
edge from the ‘physics path’ history. Second, neither Bohm and Aharonov nor Bell
mentioned the word ‘entanglement’ introduced by Schrödinger (1935).
10.2 von Neumann’s prediction
As a preamble to a discussion on Bell’s work it should be mentioned that as early as
1932 John von Neumann wrote about quantum mechanics and hidden variables

theories. In his book titled Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics right
at the onset, in its preface, von Neumann alerts the reader that ‘hidden parameters’
are incompatible with the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics (von
Neumann 1932). About three quarters into the text, in a section titled ‘Proof of
statistical formulas’ he tackles the issue of hidden variables head-on and writes: ‘It is
therefore not, as is often assumed, a question of re-interpretation of quantum
mechanics, the present system of quantum mechanics would have to be objectively
false, in order that another description of the elementary processes than the
statistical one be possible’ (von Neumann 1932). However, Bell reconsidered von
Neumann’s work and arrived at the conclusion that von Neumann’s proof was
‘wanting’ (Bell 1964). He then proceeded to offer his own proof on the incompat-
ibility of hidden variables with quantum mechanics.
In the interest of fairness it should be mentioned that Bell’s dismissal of von
Neumann’s proof has been questioned by Bub (2010) who concludes that von
Neumann’s work still excludes two classes of hidden variable theories. The
eigenvalue observation used by Bell,

Neumann’s proof is mathematically described in appendix E. Bub (2010) explicitly
considers Bell’s eigenvalue observation in his ‘re-appraisal’ of von Neumann’s work
and refers to Bell’s interpretation as ‘misleading’.
von Neumann’s original book is difﬁcult to read given its archaic mathematical
symbolism using what appear to be typewriter symbols of the epoch. Bub (2010) re-
expresses von Neumann’s argument utilizing contemporaneous symbol technology
that adds signiﬁcant transparency to von Neumann’s original arguments.
As a footnote it should be added that von Neumann in his preface indicates that
his book was, in part, motivated to provide a description of quantum mechanics
different from that of Dirac and based on mathematical rigor. In this regard he was
referring to Dirac’s papers and to the ﬁrst edition of Dirac’s book which was
published in 1930 (Dirac 1958). Albeit von Neumann criticized some aspects of
Dirac’s mathematical approach he used the following words so sum up Dirac’s
book: ‘brevity and elegance’.
10.3 Bell’s theorem or Bell’s inequalities
Bell begins his exposition by recasting in his own words, and terminology, the
quantum mechanical ideas ﬁrst pioneered by Wheeler (1946), albeit he does not
reference him. For consistency and clarity, Wheeler’s statement is reproduced here:
‘According to the pair theory, if one of these photons is linearly polarized in one
plane, then the photon that goes off in the opposite direction with equal momentum
is linearly polarized in the perpendicular plane’ (Wheeler 1946). Bell begins to add
his own originality to the argument by adding: ‘it follows that the result of any such
measurement must actually be predetermined… this predetermination implies the
possibility of a more complete speciﬁcation of the state’ (Bell 1964).
Here, a succinct exposition of Bell’s theorem is given using a slightly different
notation to the original work. This presentation follows a modiﬁed exposition of
that used by Duarte (2014, 2019) and as introduced by Duarte and Taylor (2021).

Bell deﬁnes a hidden variable λ, or hidden variables, as having a probability density
ρ λ( ) such that its normalized probability is (Bell 1964)
∫ρ λ
λ =
d
( )
1,
(10.1)
then the correlation between observables, which are a function of this hidden
variable,
λ
A x
( ,
) and
λ
B y
( ,
) is stated by Bell as
∫
λ

( ,

(10.2)
where x and y are ‘setting directions’ and the condition of locality requires that A
depends only on x and B depends only on y. The variables ′
x and ′y are assumed to be
‘alternative settings’ in the two measuring instruments. The experimenter freely
determines these settings. Furthermore, the following assumptions are made (Bell 1964):

Bell provides at least two approaches to derive his theorem (Bell 1964, 1971). The
approach exposed here begins by following Bell but then it is inﬂuenced by the
discussion of Mandel and Wolf (1995).

10.5 An additional perspective on Bell’s theorem
Often, in the literature the probability amplitudes of quantum entanglement, that is
ψ
∣〉+, ψ
∣〉−, ψ
∣〉+, and ψ
∣〉−, are called ‘Bell states’ albeit Bell did not participate in their
development. Also, Bell’s theorem is completely disconnected from the physics
leading to the derivation of ψ
∣〉+, ψ
∣〉−, ψ
∣〉+, and ψ
∣〉−and to the quantum probabilities
calculated from these probability amplitudes (see chapters 17, 18, and 19).
The main signiﬁcance of Bell’s theorem was to reinforce that hidden variable
theories were incompatible with quantum mechanics thus neutralizing much of the
criticism and discomfort, within some academic circles, toward quantum mechanics
for being ‘incomplete’.
A main assumption in Bell’s theorem is the locality postulate. This assumption
means that for two separate apparata the experimental settings in one apparatus (A)
Figure 10.1. The sum of ordinary probabilities which are a function of a hidden variable. λ have a maximum
value of 2 (Bell 1964). The corresponding probabilistic sum where the probabilities are quantum entanglement

have no effect on the settings on the other apparatus (B). If these settings are x, y, ′
x ,
and
′y , then, if the postulate of locality holds, the inequality

is true. On the other hand, if locality does not hold then Bell’s inequality is violated
as observed experimentally.
In regards to locality: ‘the two photons are entangled and according to local
realism, their polarizations planes should become independent… a typical EPR
situation. Already in 1948, observations agreed with quantum mechanics… not with
local realism’ (Dalitz and Duarte 2000).
A further assumption in the derivation of Bell’s theorem is the assumption of free
will exercised by the experimenters in the ‘settings’ of their detectors.
10.6 More philosophy and physics
The impact of Bell’s theorem on the physics community interested in a deterministic
interpretation of quantum mechanics was enormous. Bell’s work neatly reinforced
that the notion of hidden variables and quantum mechanics were incompatible. In
this regard it should be mentioned that the assumptions utilized to develop Bell’s
theorem, such as locality and free will, have attracted fresh attention from some
researchers interested in developing supposedly ‘viable’ new hidden variable
theories. As noted previously Bell’s theorem is completely disconnected from the
physics leading to the derivation of ψ
∣〉+, ψ
∣〉−, ψ
∣〉+, and ψ
∣〉−(Duarte 2014). This
topic will be revisited in the chapter on the interpretation of quantum mechanics
(chapter 30).
An utilitarian contribution of Bell’s theorem has been its use in the ﬁeld of
quantum cryptography where Bell’s inequality is applied to determine if the
transmission and reception of quanta pairs is free from third party intrusion (see
chapter 23). An alternative all-quantum measurements protocol is also introduced in
chapter 23.

11.1 Introduction
The heuristic route to the probability amplitude for quantum entanglement, that is,
the Ward approach, has already been described in chapter 6. There are two other
approaches: the interferometric approach and the Hamiltonian approach. The
Hamiltonian approach is examined here and follows Feynman’s discussion of
differential equations including the Hamiltonian matrix Hij (Feynman et al 1965).

advanced enough, in his discussion of two-state systems, so that the desired
probability amplitude could be derived with a few more steps while utilizing some
of Dirac’s identities (Duarte 2014).
Historical note: W R Hamilton contributed to optics and mathematics
(Hamilton 1866) long before quantum mechanics was ever discovered. Feynman
et al (1965) explains that the Hamiltonian is really the energy matrix in quantum
mechanics.
11.2 Probability amplitudes via Hamiltonians à la Feynman
The following description on two-state systems follows the style adopted by Duarte
(2014) and is based on the physics presented by Feynman in the now famous
Feynman’s Lectures on Physics (Feynman et al 1965). In his description Feynman
begins with the differential equation describing the dynamics for a two-state system
(see ﬁgure 11.1)

where Hij is the Hamiltonian. From this Hamiltonian approach it is found that the
sum of the probabilities that the system will be found in states ∣〉

and he uses these equations to refer to the ‘Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox’ while
concluding that ‘the paradox is only a conﬂict between reality and your feeling of
what reality ought to be’. While introducing the physics of equation (11.23) Feynman
uses the cryptic phrase ‘theoretical physicists have shown’.
A detailed scrutiny of the published literature indicates that the superposition
quantum entanglement probability amplitude depicted in equation (11.22) is the
equation that found its way into the quantum entanglement literature of the 1990s
while referencing neither Ward nor Feynman. In most of the contemporaneous
literature equations corresponding to the probability amplitude of quantum entan-
glement, such as equation (11.22), are labeled as ‘Bell’s states’.
11.5 Discussion
The arrival to the equation for the probability amplitude of two counter propagating
quanta, with entangled polarization states ∣〉

and ∣〉
y , equation (11.19), via the
Feynman route is rather abstract and does not illustrate the underlying physics of
quantum entanglement (Duarte 2014). This topic will be revisited from an trans-
parent interferometric perspective in chapter 17.
Furthermore, the Hamiltonian matrix Hij in
∑

can give rise to the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz, and I (Feynman et al 1965). These
matrices, in turn, can be applied to derive the complete set of superposition
amplitudes of quantum entanglement as shown by Duarte et al (2020) and Duarte
and Taylor (2021). This is explained in detail in chapter 22.

once again reafﬁrming the Pryce and Ward probability amplitude, and in light of

12.1 Introduction
In chapter 8 the positron–electron annihilation
γγ
→
+ −
e e
1 2 quantum entanglement
experiments of Bleuler and Bradt (1948), Hanna (1948), and Wu and Shaknov (1950)
were considered and described. In this chapter the attention is focused on the second
annihilation experiment conducted by Wu and colleagues (Kasday et al 1975).
12.2 Salient features
Following the publication of Bell’s theorem (Bell 1964), Wu and colleagues revisited
the positron–electron annihilation experiments (Kasday et al 1975). In these writings
Wu and co-authors address directly the relevance of their measurements to the EPR
argument (Einstein et al 1935), an exercise that was not done while discussing the
original experiment (Wu and Shaknov 1950). In this regard they refer to ‘the belief
of Einstein and others that it is possible to ﬁnd a theory which provides more than
the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics’ (Kasday et al 1975).
These authors continue to explain that Compton scattering, for gamma rays, is
analogous to a linear-polarization analyzer (Kasday et al 1975), as already hinted in
chapter 8.
Wu and co-workers then refer to the pre-scattering probability amplitude

analyze their experimental measurements.

ª IOP Publishing Ltd 2022

Next, reference is made to Bohm and Aharonov (1957) as expressing that the
previous scattering measurements in the annihilation experiment (Wu and Shaknov
1950) ‘were sufﬁcient to rule out certain hypothetical modiﬁcations of quantum
mechanics’ derived from the EPR argument (Kasday et al 1975).
These authors devote several pages to thoroughly describe their new and
improved experimental apparatus, see ﬁgure 12.1, and scattering measurements.
The agreement between their scattering measurements and quantum theory, via
equation (12.1), is within a margin of error of ~2.1%.
12.3 Bell’s theorem and hidden variables
Kasday et al (1975) dedicate their discussion to the relevance of Bell’s theorem to the
Compton-scattering conﬁguration. In this regard, relying partly on third party
references, they conclude that their scattering conﬁguration is not suitable for a
rigorous test of Bell’s theorem. However, they also speciﬁcally articulate that their
γγ
→
+ −
e e
1 2 quantum entanglement experiments ‘are thus evidence against local
hidden-variable theories’ (Kasday et al 1975).
To question the claim of the scattering experiments as the ﬁrst observations of
quantum entanglement is to question the impact of all other physics experiments that
rely on more than one direct and immediate observation to deduce a valid result.
Here is the essence of what is known about the scattering experiments:
1. The scattering angle was set at θ
π
≈
/2, near the optimum angle θ =
∘
82
suggested by theory (Pryce and Ward 1947).
Figure 12.1. A simpliﬁed rendition of one of the experimental conﬁgurations considered in the second Wu
experiment. The circular surface area of the detector d1, deployed in the +z direction, faces directly toward the
scatterer.
Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement (Second Edition)
12-2

2. The electron in the scatterer vibrates along the direction of the polarization
axis of the incident quanta. The direction of the scattering is perpendicular to
the polarization axis of the incident quanta (Kasday et al 1975).
3. With the scattering angle set at θ
π
≈
/2 then the detectors were positioned at
the azimuths φ1 and φ2 as illustrated in ﬁgure 12.1.
This scenario is not an overly complicated multiple-step process. It is a two-stage
measurement process rather than a single-stage measurement process. According to
van Kampen’s theorems on quantum measurements: ‘quantum mechanics is
concerned with macroscopic phenomena, which are not perturbed by observation’
(van Kampen 1988). As long as no observational attempts are made to intrude in the
measurement process, consisting of the incidence of the entangled gamma ray
quanta and the scattering of the radiation towards the detector, there is no
pragmatic motive to doubt the validity of the measurements from the scattering
experiments.
The second Wu experiment yielded results in agreement with quantum mechanics
within 2.1% (Kasday et al 1975). For their particular conﬁguration the count ratio
for relative perpendicular polarizations is 2.33 ± 0.10. A previous experiment by
Langhoff (1960) reports on a relative orthogonal polarization ratio of 2.509 ± 0.030
which was within 1.2% of the corresponding theoretical prediction of 2.48 ± 0.02.
An additional experiment was also performed by Wilson et al (1976). These
researchers used the optimum angle of scatter θ =
∘
82 (Pryce and Ward 1947) and
their conclusion was: ‘there appears to be no evidence for spontaneous localization
of the quanta and, irrespective of their separation, their properties are accurately
described by a pure state’ (Wilson et al 1976).
It is reasonable to assume that improvement in γ-ray scatterers and scattering
detection technology should allow experiments to approach the theoretical optimum
of 2.82 (Pryce and Ward 1947) that has yet to be reached (Caradonna et al 2019).
Finally, as will be seen in the coming chapters, regardless of Bell’s theorem, the
published hidden variable theories depart from the characteristics of quantum
mechanics in important aspects (Duarte and Taylor 2021) and to use them as a
criterion to determine the validity of quantum measurements is inappropriate and
ill-informed.

13.1 Introduction
The annihilation

→

e e
1 2 quantum entanglement experiments of Bleuler and
Bradt (1948), Hanna (1948), and Wu and Shaknov (1950) are described in chapter 8.
The experiment of Kasday et al (1975) is described in chapter 12. In this chapter, and
chapter 14, attention is focused on a series of second generation quantum entangle-
ment experiments: the optical experiments.
The experiments considered here were motivated by the notion that the
annihilation experiments with gamma rays were not sufﬁcient to rule out hidden
variable theories. Thus began a series of experiments, in the optical domain, based
on the writings of Bohm and Aharonov (1957). These experiments are mentioned,
and some are described, here.
13.2 Testing for local hidden variable theories
In a paper titled ‘Proposed experiment to test local hidden variable theories’, Clauser
et al (1969) wrote in reference to the work of Wu and Shaknov (1950): ‘Although the
polarization state of the pair is suitable… their high energy requires the use of
Compton polarimeters. Thus instead of directly examining the polarization corre-
lations, Wu and Shaknov examined the polarization-dependent joint distribution for
Compton scattering of the pair.’ This paper was followed by a paper titled
‘Experimental consequences of objective local theories’ (Clauser and Horner 1974)

Clauser et al (1969) also proposed modifying an experiment reported by Kocher and
Commins (1967) in which a H2 arc lamp is used to produce UV excitation leading to
the population of an upper lying level in 40Ca that results in the emission of two-step

conﬁguration of this optical experiment consists simply of an optical axis with the
source at the center and a detector at each end, of the optical axis, preceded by a
polarization analyzer, see ﬁgure 13.3. This appears to be the initial stage for optical
versions of the Wheeler–Pryce–Ward quantum entanglement conﬁguration. In this
regard, Clauser et al (1969) include an interesting line in their paper: ‘neither of the
experimental realizations (Wu and Shaknov 1950, Kocher and Commins 1967) of
Bohm’s gedanken experiment has produced evidence against local hidden variable

theories, even though the results of both are compatible with quantum mechanical
predictions.’ The reference to Bohm is to his book Quantum Theory (Bohm 1951).
This statement is not corroborated by the literature since the Wu and Shaknov
experiment dates back to 1950 and follows the Dirac–Wheeler–Pryce–Ward route
(Wheeler 1946, Pryce and Ward 1947).
The search to ﬁnd a measurable effect from local hidden variable theories
continued and in a paper by Freedman and Clauser (1972) an experimental
conﬁguration based on the Kocher–Commins experiment was utilized. These
authors produced a generalized version of Bell’s theorem (Bell 1964) and found
that the measured linear polarization correlations agreed with the quantum
mechanical predictions, in violation of their new version of Bell’s inequalities.
Their conclusion was that there was ‘strong evidence against local hidden-variable
theories’ (Freedman and Clauser 1972).
Clauser and Horner (1974) highlighted the incompatibility of a broad class of
hidden variable theories, named as ‘objective local theories’ with quantum mechan-
ics and experimental measurements. Of particular interest in this paper is a footnote
that refers to the second Wu experiment (Kasday et al 1975) as conﬁrming the
quantum mechanical predictions, however, the Compton scattering detectors are
said to be ‘too inefﬁcient’ to rule out local theories. On the other hand, Wu and
colleagues stated that their
γγ
→

1 2 measurements ‘are thus evidence against local
hidden-variable theories’ (Kasday et al 1975).
13.4 Observations and discussion
Albeit Wu and colleagues (Kasday et al 1975) did refer explicitly to both Bell’s
inequalities and the Pryce–Ward probability amplitude, this connection was absent
in the publications of Clauser et al (1969), Freedman and Clauser (1972), and
Clauser and Horner (1974). It is also illustrative to point out that the main quantum
result exposed by Clauser et al (1969) depends on the term
φ
cos 2 , where φ is an
angular difference. In other words, this appears to be the term

From a historical perspective, none of the publications listed here incorporated
the word entanglement in their description. Their main motivation appears to have
been the interaction between hidden variable local theories and Bell’s theorem.

1 2 quantum entanglement experiments of Bleuler and
Bradt (1948), Hanna (1948), Wu and Shaknov (1950), and Kasday et al (1975) are
described in chapters 8 and 12. As described in chapter 13 the measurements in those
experiments were deemed by some as ‘too inefﬁcient’ to rule out local hidden
variable theories (Clauser and Horner 1974).
Judging from the titles of the papers considered in this section, it is clear and
transparent that the subject matter motivating this series of experiments was to test
hidden variable theories in light of Bell’s theorem. This is quite interesting because
an even more powerful reason for these experiment would have been to re-do the
original quantum entanglement experiments (Bleuler and Bradt 1948, Hanna 1948,
Wu and Shaknov 1950, Kasday et al 1975) previously performed in the gamma-ray
domain, in the visible domain of the electromagnetic spectrum.
14.2 The Aspect experiments
The Aspect experiments are summarized in two papers: the ﬁrst paper was titled
‘Experimental tests of realistic local theories via Bell’s theorem’ (Aspect et al 1981)
and the second paper was titled ‘Experimental realization of Einstein–Podolsky–
Rosen–Bohm Gedankenexperiment: a new violation of Bell’s inequalities’ (Aspect
et al 1982a).

In his ﬁrst paper on this subject Aspect does refer to Wu’s second experiment
(Kasday et al 1975) and states that the ‘experiments agree with QM predictions.
However, because of the lack of efﬁcient polarizers …strong supplementary
assumptions are necessary to interpret these results via Bell’s theorem’ (Aspect
et al 1981).
14.2.1 The ﬁrst Aspect experiment
The ﬁrst Aspect experiment also utilized 40Ca as the active atomic medium emitting
the two quanta in opposite directions. As seen previously the transitions involved
are two cascade transitions in
40Ca:

(λ = 422.7

colleagues was that instead of using a UV arc lamp as the excitation source, they
used two lasers to cover the excitation transition

. This two-photon
laser excitation, illustrated in ﬁgure 14.1, was accomplished using a single-mode
krypton ion laser emitting at λ

nm and a tunable dye laser emitting at
Figure 14.1. Approximate energy level diagram for 40Ca relevant to the Aspect experiments. Aspect et al
(1981) replaced the UV arc lamp by two counter-propagating lasers at λ

and λ

nm.

λ
= 581
e2
nm. The two lasers are said to have ‘parallel polarizations’ (Aspect et al
1981). The two lasers were focused on the calcium atomic beam in a counter-
propagating conﬁguration perpendicular to the optical axis conﬁgured by the 40Ca
emission. On each side of the emission axis a lens is used to focus the radiation on to
a polarizer, followed by a ﬁlter, prior to the detector. A generic rendition of this
experimental conﬁguration is provided in ﬁgure 14.2.
Aspect et al (1981) utilized the generalized Bell inequalities mentioned previously

Aspect and colleagues report a ‘perfect agreement with quantum mechanics’ and
a strong violation of their applicable Bell inequality (Aspect et al 1981). An
interesting result from these experiments is that the strongest violations of the
generalized Bell’s inequalities were found when the polarizers were set at interval
angular segments of
°
22.5 (Aspect et al 1981) as predicted by Clauser et al (1969).
14.2.2 The second Aspect experiment
The second Aspect experiment replaced the straightforward polarizer analyzer by a
polarizing beam splitter in conjunction with two detectors (Aspect et al 1982a), as
illustrated in ﬁgure 14.3. This type of detection arrangement has become ubiquitous
in current quantum entanglement experiments.
Again using Ca as the emission medium, and the same excitation conﬁguration as
in the ﬁrst experiment, Aspect and colleagues again relied on the

ics’ (Aspect et al 1982a).

analyzers p1 and p2 are replaced by polarizing beam splitters.

14.2.3 The third Aspect experiment
Up to now all the experiments considered here have involved static conditions in
which the polarizing analyzers are maintained stationary, in their angular settings,
while experimental runs are conducted. These static experiments do not satisfy the
conditions of the gedanken experiment proposed by Bohm and Aharonov (1957) in
which the polarization settings are changed during the propagation of the quanta.
An experiment including time-varying polarization analyzers was reported by
Aspect et al (1982b). In this experiment, each detection station was composed of an
electro-optical Bragg grating, which acts as a time dependent beam splitter, followed
by two polarizers: one polarizer along the original optical axis and a second
polarizer along the path of the diffracted beam. The Bragg grating operates at a
frequency of ~ 50 MHz (Aspect et al 1982b). In this experimental conﬁguration the
predetermined angles φ1 and φ ′
1 are at one measuring station with φ1 at the polarizer
analyzer deployed orthogonal to the main optical axis and φ ′
1 at the polarizer
analyzer deployed orthogonal to the diffracted beam. The angles φ2 and φ ′
2 are at
the complementary measuring station with φ2 at the polarizer analyzer deployed
orthogonal to the main optical axis and φ ′
2 at the polarizer analyzer deployed
orthogonal to the diffracted beam. See ﬁgure 14.4.
Again, Aspect et al (1982b) utilized the generalized Bell inequalities mentioned
previously as extended by Clauser et al (1969) and Clauser and Horner (1974)

which represents a violation of the inequality by 5 standards of deviation. The
applicable quantum mechanical coincidence ratio is quoted as 0.112 (Aspect et al
1982b).
This third Aspect experiment might be regarded as one the ﬁrst attempts to close a
so called ‘loop-hole’ in this class of experiments. Here, in reference to Bell (1964),
Aspect and colleagues write: ‘the locality condition would then become a conse-
quence of Einstein’s causality, preventing any faster than light inﬂuence’ (Aspect
et al 1982b).
14.3 Observations and discussion
Albeit Wu and colleagues (Kasday et al 1975) did refer explicitly to both Bell’s
inequalities and the Pryce–Ward probability amplitude, this connection was absent
in the publications of Clauser et al (1969), Freedman and Clauser (1972), Clauser
and Horner (1974), Aspect et al (1981), and Aspect et al (1982a, 1982b). It is also
illustrative to point out that the main quantum result exposed by Clauser et al
(1969) depends on the term
φ
cos 2 , where φ stands for ‘an angular difference.’ This
should be compared with the term
φ
φ
−
cos 2(
)

2
derived by Pryce and Ward
(1947).
From a historical perspective, none of the publications listed here incorporated
the word entanglement in their description. Their main motivating factor appears to
have been the interaction between hidden variables local theories and Bell’s theorem.
However, by the second Aspect experiment the emphasis had clearly evolved to an
agreement of experimental results with quantum mechanics and the strong violation
of Bell’s inequalities (Aspect et al 1982a, 1982b).
One observation due here is that in the Aspect experiments there is a deviation
from one of the initial requirements suggested by Wheeler (1946) and utilized
by
Ward
(1949)
in
his
derivation

and the idea that ∣

λ = 551.3

and λ = 422.7

nm.
Leaving the issue of hidden variable theories aside, the real value of Aspect’s
contributions is that they were the ﬁrst quantum entanglement experiments
performed in the visible spectrum and as such they were key to shift the attention
into a new era of quantum entanglement physics in the visible.

The ﬁrst time that the quantum entanglement probability amplitude was set on
paper was done, using Dirac’s notation (Dirac 1939, 1958), by Pryce and Ward
(1947), as an intermediate step in the derivation of the correct quantum cross-section
for scattering measurements applicable to the polarization quantum entanglement of
two indistinguishable gamma-ray quanta propagating in opposite directions (see
chapter 6). In this regard, the probability amplitudes prior to normalization can be
written as

and once the usual normalization is performed can be immediately expressed as

his doctoral thesis (Ward 1949).

15.3 Observations and discussion
In the mid to late 1990s the probability amplitude represented by equation (15.1), in
its various formats, became a widely used equation in the armamentarium of
quantum entanglement physicists, undoubtedly, a true icon. Its origin, however, is
almost never discussed (Duarte 2012). It was, and largely still is, as if everyone knew
were it came from, and its meaning is assumed to be obvious. Perhaps it might be

quantum equations such as (Born et al 1926)

damped the interest of the quantum entanglement community to ﬁnd out the origin
of equation (15.1). However, that is a tenuous analogy at best and there is no
published evidence to support this conjecture.
Furthermore, as has been seen in previous chapters of this book the superposition

was not even mentioned in the mainstream literature in the crucial 1957–1982 period
when the main attention was focused on EPR arguments, hidden variable theories,
and Bell’s theorem.
This will go down as one of the most strange episodes in the history of physics,
where the crucial and essential equation for the most important branch of quantum
optics vanished for a period and then re-emerged, out of thin air, more than 40 years
later… while the inventors, or discoverers, of the equation were apparently unknown
to the users and beneﬁciaries of the equation. Indeed, an ineffable omission.

16.2 The GHZ probability amplitudes
A probability amplitude beyond the fundamental case of
=
=
n
N
2 was introduced
by Greenberger et al (1990). This probability amplitude is known in the literature as
the GHZ probability amplitude after the initials of the three original co-authors
(Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger).
The GHZ probability amplitude deals with four propagation channels (
=
N
4)
and four particles (
=
n
4) as illustrated in ﬁgure 16.1. The GHZ equation was
originally developed for spin-1/2 particles and is presented by Greenberger et al
(1990) as

The reader should be able to discern that the ﬁrst term, within the parenthesis, refers
to particles 1 and 2 with spins up and particles 3 and 4 with spins down. Along the
same lines the second term in this equation refers to particles 1 and 2 with spins
down and particles 3 and 4 with spins up. In summary, this probability amplitude
applies to the case of
=

n
N
4 (see ﬁgure 16.1). A relevant observation here is that
for a four-quanta four-channel experiment, that is

should have been expected on the rhs and with these two extra terms the normal-
ization factor should have been

16.3 Observations and discussion
The signiﬁcance of the work by Greenberger et al (1990) was three-fold:
1. They reintroduced the original probability amplitude for quantum entangle-
ment, albeit in a slightly modiﬁed notation, squarely onto the platform of the
EPR argument (Einstein et al 1935) and Bell’s theorem (Bell 1964).
2. They proved the rotational invariance of the probability amplitude for
quantum entanglement for the case of
=
=
n
N
2 (equations (16.1) or (16.2)).
3. They were able to recast Bell’s theorem without the need of inequalities.
4. Moreover they found that the EPR program ‘contradicts quantum mechan-
ics even for the case of perfect correlations’. And these authors go on to claim
that for

=

than that observed for

This equation is written yet again since it is utterly crucial to the ﬁeld of quantum
optics. Up to now this equation has been extensively applied in a nameless fashion. In
this monograph it is called the Dirac–Feynman probability amplitude because it was
Feynman who presented it, and championed it, in his famous lectures (Feynman et al
1965). Also, at the same time, Feynman’s presentation was heavily inﬂuenced by
Dirac’s bra ket notation and Dirac’s principles as outlined in his book (Dirac 1958).
The meaning of this equation is quite succinct and yet profound:
1. It says that: ‘all the indistinguishable photons illuminate the array of N slits,
or grating, simultaneously. If only one photon propagates… then that
individual photon illuminates the whole array of N slits simultaneously’
(Duarte 2003).
2. It also says that in order to obtain the correct result the interaction of the
probability amplitude via every slit, under illumination, with the probability
amplitude via every other slit in the array must be included in the calculation.
For example, if an array of 2000 slits is under illumination this means that the
interaction of the probability amplitude of slit number 1 with all the other 1999 slits
must be accounted for, and so on. In other words all the probability amplitudes are
interconnected in accordance with Dirac’s superposition principle (Dirac 1958).
17.3 The derivation of the quantum entanglement probability
amplitude
The experimental diagram applicable to the fundamental conﬁguration of quantum
entanglement is depicted in ﬁgure 17.1. Here, s is a photon source of ν1 and ν2
emitted in the +z and −z directions, respectively. The quanta propagate along the

emitted in the +z and −z directions, respectively. The two linear polarization axes are indicated as x and y
which are perpendicular to each other. The angles φ1 and φ2 are the polarization angles measured on a plane
perpendicular to the propagation axis while d1 and d2 are the corresponding detectors.

toward the detectors d1 and d2, respectively.
The ﬁrst essential, and experimentally sound, assumption is that the quanta

There is nothing in Dirac’s rules, for bosons, that would prevent states such as ∣〉

That is, all the indistinguishable quanta comprising ensemble I are polarized in
the ∣〉

state whilst all the indistinguishable quanta comprising ensemble II are
polarized in the ∣〉
y
state. Ultimately this means that ensembles ∣〉
x I and ∣〉
y II are
themselves entangled. This opens the possibility of designing sources of entangled
laser emission, thus vastly improving the signal to noise conditions for quantum
communications. The detection statistics of states with n indistinguishable bosons is
discussed by Feynman et al (1965). It should be noted that identities (17.23) and
(17.24) explain beautifully the coherent emission from electrically pumped organic
semiconductors at a very fundamental level (Duarte and Taylor 2022).
Tunable narrow-linewidth laser sources randomly emitting ∣〉
x I and ∣〉
y II states in
opposite directions, via the use of intracavity elements driven by quantum random
number generators (QRNG), have been suggested by Duarte (2018). This class of
laser source has yet to be demonstrated experimentally.
17.6 Discussion
The probability amplitude for quantum entanglement was ﬁrst put down on paper in
1947 by Pryce and Ward and its semi-heuristic derivation made public in 1949 by
Ward (Pryce and Ward 1947, Ward 1949). Since Ward’s effort, and until 2013, there
is no record in the open literature of additional derivations. As has already been
documented in previous chapters, all of the research related to quantum entangle-
ment in the post Bohm–Aharonov epoch (Bohm and Aharanov 1957) centered
around the EPR arguments (Einstein et al 1935) and Bell’s theorem (Bell 1964). As
explained in chapter 11, in 1965 Feynman wrote down the physics, via a two-level
Hamiltonian, that leads to equation (17.2) but stopped there and did not consider
the Dirac identities and the additional steps that would have led explicitly to the
probability amplitude quantum entanglement (Feynman et al 1965). Indeed when he
considers the issue of quantum entanglement he brings in an equation of the relevant
form in an ad hoc manner and true to his honesty he wrote ‘theoretical physicist
have shown’ (Feynman et al 1965).
The derivation detailed here shows that the Dirac–Feynman interferometric
principle

highlight is that the derivation of the quantum entanglement probability amplitude,
à la Dirac, ﬂows naturally, it is transparent and straightforward. There are no
‘paradoxes’ in the physics of quantum entanglement.

2017).
18.2 The quantum entanglement probability amplitude for n = N = 4
The experimental diagram applicable to the
=

n
N
4 conﬁguration for quantum
entanglement is depicted in ﬁgure 18.1. Here, s is the photon source of two pairs of
quanta emitted in opposite directions relative to each other: (ν1, ν2) and (ν3, ν4).

In terms of conventional axis labeling (ν1, ν2) are emitted in the +z and −z directions
while (ν3, ν4) are emitted in the +x and −x directions, respectively. In order to
simplify the notation and axis labeling, in reference to ﬁgure 18.1, traditional axis
labels are obviated and only polarization alternatives are assigned in pairs, in this
case x y
( ,
) along the +z and −z directions, and φ φ′
( ,
) along the corresponding
orthogonal direction.
Again the ﬁrst essential, and experimentally sound, assumption is that the quanta
emitted by the source are indistinguishable, then assuming

18.3 The quantum entanglement probability amplitude for n = N = 8
The experimental diagram applicable to the

8 conﬁguration of quantum
entanglement is depicted in ﬁgure 18.2. Four axes are involved, each adjacent axis at
θ

8 channels of propagation are available. Here, s is the photon source of four
pairs of quanta emitted in opposite directions relative to each other. Again, in order
to simplify the notation and axis labeling, in reference to ﬁgure 18.2, axis labels are
obviated and only polarization alternatives are assigned in pairs, in this case x y

along the +z and −z directions, and φ φ′

π

polarizations and the axis orthogonal to it involves the ϑ ϑ′
( ,

Equations (18.26)–(18.33) describe quanta pairs (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8) in a
particular polarization order as outlined by ∣〉
C 1. Next, within pairs, polarization
are interchanged as given in ∣〉
C 2. In ∣〉
C 3, the second pair moves to the position of
the ﬁrst pair which is displaced to the position of the last pair. Transposition of the
polarizations follows as indicated in ∣〉
C 4, and so on (Duarte 2018). The only
constant is the position of the quanta 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

18.5 The quantum entanglement probability amplitude for
n = N = 21, 22, 23, 24, … 2r
First, the probability amplitude∣〉s can generally be expressed as (Duarte 2016, 2018)
∑
∣〉=

=
+ −

and for notational consistency the normalized probability amplitude is expressed as
ψ
∣〉=
∣〉
−
N
s
(18.46)
R

that means
∑
ψ

and the sign alternative ±
( ) means that every possible sign alternative in the series is
allowed.
Next, using the Dirac’s identity for ‘similar particles’, the individual path
probability amplitudes ∣〉+ −
C N
j

are expressed in a generalized form as (Duarte
2016, 2018)
∏

Equation (18.49) is a mathematical expression for series of probability amplitudes
beginning at ∣〉+ −
C N
j
1
with
=
j
1, and ending at ∣〉
C 1 which is reached when
=
j
N.
In this notation, n is the total number of quanta which is an even number since
quanta participate in pairs. For each pair,

on (Duarte 2018).
Explicitly, for

equation (18.49) yields:

Chapter 19
The interferometric derivation of the quantum
entanglement probability amplitudes for
n = N = 3, 6
The interferometric derivation of probability amplitudes for
=
=
n
N
3, 6, 9 are
discussed using the Dirac–Feynman interferometric principle and Dirac’s identities.
This approach requires the use of Hamilton’s quaternions. Here, n is the number of
quanta and N is the number of propagation channels.
19.1 Introduction
In chapter 17 the interferometric derivation, à la Dirac, of the probability amplitude
for quantum entanglement applicable to two quanta (
=
n
2) and two propagation
channels (
=
N
2) is described. In chapter 18 the same derivational approach utilized
in chapter 17 is applied to the cases of
=
=

=

=

. In this chapter the
interferometric derivation, à la Dirac, of the probability amplitude for quantum
entanglement applicable to three quanta (
=
n
3) and three propagation channels
(
=
N
3) is described. The same approach is then extended to
=
=

N

The material presented in this chapter is a summary and extension of previous
publications (Duarte 2015, 2016).

The experimental diagram applicable to the

entanglement is depicted in ﬁgure 19.1. Here, s is the photon source of three quanta
emitted in three direction at a relative angle of π
2 /3 although this orientation is not
mandatory.

3, 6 conﬁgurations lead to the following conclusions:
1. Each individual probability amplitude includes
=

N terms.
2. The normalization factor for a quantum entanglement conﬁgurations
including N propagation channels is
−
N 1/2.
3. In order to satisfy the normalization condition the use of Hamilton’s
quaternions is necessary.
4. For a given

amplitudes.
By observing equations (19.14)–(19.16) and (19.28)–(19.33) the equations appli-

which is the probability amplitude for double-slit interference (Feynman et al 1965).
As seen previously, equation (20.11) is derived from the Dirac–Feynman interfero-

The process described here, from equation (20.1) to equation (20.12), is the
derivation of the probability amplitude for quantum entanglement (Duarte 2013a,
2013b, 2014) in reverse.
20.3 Schematics
The schematics applicable to
=
=
n
N
21 quantum entanglement is illustrated in
ﬁgure 20.1(a). As mentioned previously the crucial assumptions in the derivation of
equations (20.1) and (20.2) are:
1. The quanta emitted by the source are indistinguishable, that is ν
ν
ν
=
=
1
2
.
2. The detectors are assumed to be identical so that
=
=
d

.
These two characteristics are incorporated in the optical equivalent diagram
depicted in ﬁgure 20.1(b) where the two mirrors are assumed to be 100% reﬂective
non-polarizing surfaces. In essence this is a dual beam path of indistinguishable

and φ2 while their entangled behavior is described by

The comparison is carried further in ﬁgure 20.2 where the equivalent entanglement
diagram, applicable to equations (20.1) and (20.2), is shown next to a double-slit
experiment. In ﬁgure 20.2(a) indistinguishable quanta, that quantum mechanically is
the same quantum, propagate toward the detector via two polarizer analyzers set at
angles ϕ1 and ϕ2. In ﬁgure 20.2(b) a single photon, or a population of indistinguish-
able photons, is spatially expanded (Duarte 2015) to illuminate slit 1 and slit 2
simultaneously and they lead to interference via

The derivational path (20.14) indicates that quantum interference is the essence of
quantum entanglement whilst the derivational path (20.15) indicates that quantum
entanglement is the essence of quantum interference.
20.4.1 Experimental perspective
From the experimental perspective there is a strong sense of history. The phenom-
enon of the interference of light has been documented since at least the early 1800s
(Young 1802). In addition, interference as an experimental phenomenon is not only
conﬁned to optics but is also present in acoustics and hydraulics. In fact, the ﬁrst
experience this physicist had with interference was as a child observing, from
altitude, wave patterns over the majestic Paciﬁc Ocean. Hence, there is an innate

bias to favor interference as being the fundamental phenomenon that gives rise to
quantum entanglement. If the Dirac–Feynman principle

and these two different states, of the same photon, can be thought of as not just
being entangled but utterly entangled. This situation can arise in an ensemble of
indistinguishable quanta where the quanta can be in different sates. This subject is
discussed further in chapter 29.

… was my ﬁrst lesson in quantum mechanics, and in a very real sense
my last, since the rest is mere technique, which can be learnt from books’ (Ward
2004).
From a broader perspective, however, two further observations introduce further
stimulus for thought:
1. Ward’s comment following the Pryce–Ward publication in 1947: ‘Wheeler
proceeded to calculate… But through the neglect of interference terms he
derived an incorrect… far too small value for the angular correlations…’
(Ward 1949).
2. Feynman’s assertion in his lectures that interference is ‘in the heart of
quantum mechanics’ (Feynman et al 1965).

20.4.3 Derivation of the Dirac–Feynman principle
Since the publication of the ﬁrst edition of this book (Duarte 2019) it has been shown
that the probability amplitudes of quantum entanglement can be derived from the
Pauli matrices (Duarte et al 2020) so that the path

is revealed (Duarte and Taylor 2021). This is the ﬁrst time that it has been shown
that the Dirac–Feynman interferometric principle is not just a brilliant dictum but it
has deeper roots going back to the Hamiltonian. At this stage all that can be said is
that quantum entanglement and quantum interference are interconnected at the
most fundamental level of quantum mechanics.

21.1 Introduction
A concept that has prevailed over the fear of possible local hidden variable theories
is Bell’s theorem. This is the theorem, in a contemporaneous context, that proved
that local hidden variable theories were incompatible with quantum mechanics.
Since Bell’s theorem or Bell’s inequalities are widely applied in the ﬁeld of quantum
cryptography, in this chapter a further exposition of the probability amplitudes for
quantum entanglement in the context of Bell’s theorem is given.

essential for the accurate representation of the physics at hand. Any modiﬁcation
to the physics, regardless of how insigniﬁcant it might seem, must be represented in
the probability amplitude. However, probability amplitudes are not ‘measurables’.
The probability amplitude must be multiplied with its complex conjugate, according
to the Born rule (Born 1926), to yield a probability that then becomes the
measurable. That is, for instance, using the probability amplitude given in equation

equation (21.37) and considering the situation in which quanta 1 is incident on the

which is obviously not true thus demonstrating that Bell’s inequality is violated when
using the quantum probabilities computed via the Pryce–Ward probability ampli-
tude for quantum entanglement (Pryce and Ward 1947, Ward 1949). An additional
example is given in chapter 10.
21.6 All-quantum approach
Hidden variable theories (Bohm 1952a, 1952b, Bohm and Bub 1966) include
intrinsic non-quantum features (Duarte and Taylor 2021). Therefore, the incom-
patibility of hidden variable theories with quantum mechanics becomes self evident.
In this regard, a simple all-quantum protocol, to verify the security of quantum
entanglement, that is independent of Bell’s theorem has been formulated by Duarte
and Taylor (2021) which is largely reproduced in this section with some minor
modiﬁcations.
Consider a basic quantum entanglement conﬁguration for

rating intruding intra-communication path beam splitters, identiﬁed as i, as
illustrated in ﬁgure 21.3. Following the interferometric approach described in

The beauty of this all-quantum approach is that it does not invoke any of the
assumptions utilized by Bell to derive his theorem. It solely rests on the sum of the
absolute value of the four alternative quantum superposition probabilities. This is
directly applicable to quantum cryptography as described in chapter 23.
21.7 Discussion
The results of quantum entanglement experiments are fully characterized by their
corresponding probability amplitudes and measurable probabilities. However, in the
way and manner that this subject has evolved, Bell’s theorem and corresponding
Bell’s inequalities have become widely used as an avenue to ensure that the quantum
mechanical communications have not been compromised by possible third party
intrusions.

Quantum entanglement via matrix notation
The probability amplitudes, or states, for quantum entanglement for

expressed in matrix form. The mathematical nexuses between the probability
amplitudes for quantum entanglement with Pauli matrices and the Hadamard
matrix are described. Furthering this approach, a series of additional
×

quantum matrices are introduced.
22.1 Introduction
In this chapter the complete set of probability amplitudes for quantum entangle-
ment, also known as Bell states, is expressed in matrix form. These are
×
2
2
matrices that provide information about the polarization of the quanta, that is, the
states ∣〉
x and ∣〉
y .
Particular attention is given to the mathematical nexuses between the probability
amplitudes for quantum entanglement and Pauli matrices as well as the link between
these probability amplitudes and the Hadamard matrix. A subsequent set of
Hadamard-type matrices is introduced and their properties examined.
The content in this chapter is based on a review version of the paper by Duarte
et al (2020) and the discussion given by Duarte and Taylor (2021). For the basics on
vector, tensor, and matrix notation please refer to appendix E.

of an ordinary beam splitter and a polarization rotator (Duarte and Taylor 2021).
22.7 Polarization rotators for quantum entanglement
The physics of polarization rotators is discussed by Robson (1974) and Born and
Wolf (1999). An experimental perspective is given by Duarte (2014, 2015).
Polarization rotators inducing a θ
π
=
/2 rotation of linearly polarized light are
mathematically described by the matrix

R

(22.76)

⎛

Experimentally this θ
π
=
/2 rotation polarization rotation is performed by half-
wave plates, rhomboid rotators, and multiple-prism collinear polarization rotators.
These optical elements are described in appendix D.
22.8 Quantum mathematics with polarization rotators
Polarization rotators can be used to perform quantum operations relevant to
quantum computing. If the entangled photons are made to be incident on a
generalized θ
π
=
/2 polarization rotator represented by the matrix

This demonstrates the inherent capability for mathematical operations utilizing polar-
ization rotators and entangled states. This simple concept means that beams of entangled
photons interacting with optical apparata conﬁgured with optical elements capable of
transforming the entangled states can be used to perform optical quantum computations.

amplitudes for quantum entanglement yield the following mathematical identities

23.1 Introduction
Cryptography is a word based on Greek that conveys the concepts of hidden writing
or secret writing. Traditionally, cryptography has involved a secret key or code
shared between two parties, the interchange of coded messages between the parties,
and the subsequent decoding of the messages using the key or code. The weak link in
this arrangement is the key or code that can be captured and deciphered or
decrypted by a third party, spy, or eavesdropper.
Quantum cryptography is the application of the physics of quantum entanglement,
and quantum technologies, to enable the secure creation, transmission, and
reception of characters, words, or messages. According to Bennett (1992) quantum
key distribution is ‘the classically impossible task of distributing secret information
over an insecure channel whose transmissions are subject to inspection by an
eavesdropper’.
Quantum cryptography was ﬁrst discussed, as a concept, by S Weisner in the
1970s. A scheme to implement quantum cryptography was subsequently introduced
in the open literature by Bennett and Brassard (1984) in what became known as the
Bennett–Brassard approach. Further developments were published by Bennett et al
(1992a). The Bennett–Brassard approach utilizes the straightforward polarization
properties of propagating quanta such as

The focus of this chapter is on free-space quantum cryptography derived from the
the physics of the quantum entanglement probability amplitude. For an extensive
review of quantum cryptography, and the various approaches to implement it, the
reader may refer to Gisin et al (2002).

From this set of probability amplitudes equations (23.5) and (23.6) were implicitly
introduced to the ﬁeld of quantum cryptography by Ekert (1991). This author
described a cryptographic methodology applicable to fermions. The technique is
based on Bell’s theorem (Bell 1964) via the Bohm–EPR perspective (Einstein et al
1935, Bohm 1951). It should be noted that the use of Bell’s inequalities implies the
calculation of quantum probabilities using the probability amplitudes given in
equations (23.5)–(23.8) even if not stated explicitly. Here it should be clariﬁed that
albeit probability amplitudes (23.5) and (23.6) apply to fermions, equations (23.5)–
(23.8) describe the physics of bosons.
The Ekert (1991) approach is based on the ‘completeness of quantum mechanics’.
In other words, it is the violation of Bell’s inequalities that ensure security.
Bosonic rather than a fermionic realizations of the Ekert approach were
published by Naik et al (2000), Jennewein et al (2000), and Tittel et al (2000).
These experimenters utilized their own version of the Ekert approach but the
following features provide a fair summary.
In an adaptation of the Ekert approach for bosons the researchers ﬁrst select the
source to be used and identify this source with one of the corresponding probability
amplitudes given in equations (23.5)–(23.8). For instance, for a source that emits
quanta pairs as described by equation (23.7) each communicating party, A and B,

then proceeds to conduct a set of measurements using states such as (Naik et al

A and B can disclose the settings used for the measurements but not the results of
the measurements. Measurements fall into three categories: one portion include
errors and has to be discarded, the second category of measurements is error free and
can be used to calculate the corresponding violation of Bell’s inequalities. The
settings corresponding to this second category are made public. The third category,
related to a small fraction of the measurements, correspond to the polarizations that
are completely correlated, yielding φ

, and it is these measurements that
are used to provide the quantum key. In the Ekert protocol once the quantum key
has been established communications proceed via an open conventional channel
(Ekert 1991). In this methodology it is the violation of Bell’s inequalities that implies
that the measurements are secure.
Bennet et al (1992b) indicate that the Ekert approach and the Bennet and
Brassard approach are equivalent. These authors also argue that neither the EPR
effect (Einstein et al 1935) nor Bell’s inequalities (Bell 1964) are ‘an essential part’ for
security certiﬁcation. Furthermore, it should be indicated that the Pryce–Ward
probability amplitude (Pryce and Ward 1947, Ward 1949), indeed an essential
component of entanglement based quantum cryptography, was conceived in a total
vacuum from philosophical considerations (Duarte 2012, 2014, 2019).
An additional historical note is that the probability amplitude equations given in
equations (23.5)–(23.8) became known as Bell states even though Bell was absent in
their development.
23.2.1 Experiments
The basic apparatus for quantum cryptography key distribution, using photons or
quanta, is based on the original experimental conﬁguration introduced by Pryce
and Ward (1947) and modiﬁed by Aspect et al (1982) for the testing of Bell’s
inequalities in the visible spectrum. A relevant generic linear experimental
conﬁguration is illustrated in ﬁgure 23.1. For instance, a source of entangled
photon pairs emits quanta 1 in the +z direction, towards experimenter A, and
quanta 2 in the −z direction, towards experimenter B. In addition to the random
emission of photons pairs with polarizations orthogonal to each other, the
Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement (Second Edition)
23-3

analyzers are also set randomly at angles φj
A and φj
B, as outlined in the previous
section.
In contemporaneous optical conﬁgurations the photon pair sources can either be
emitted via an optically pumped spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC)
source or quantum dot emitters. SPDC type II sources emit the photon pairs not
collinearly in opposite directions but at an angle relative to each other, see
ﬁgure 23.2. Type I SPDC sources, using two BBO crystals in series, have been
reported to emit nearly collinear photon pairs (Villar et al 2020). Quantum dot
sources for this application are described by Kuroda et al (2013). Also, it should be

A and φ j
B are
randomized (see the text).
Figure 23.2. Generic schematics of a quantum key distribution experiment utilizing spontaneous parametric
down conversion (SPDC). In this case, an appropriate pump laser is used to excite a type II crystal
conﬁguration often comprised of BBO crystals. Prior to the polarizing beam splitter (PBS) an appropriate
polarizer analyzer capable of providing randomized settings for φ j
A and φ j
B is deployed. In some experiments
the source of entangled photons is located near one of the communicating parties such as A.

noted that researches employ varied methods to achieve the random settings for φj
A
and φj
B.
The quantum entanglement probability applicable to two quanta propagating in
opposite directions, while exhibiting orthogonal polarizations, is calculated from the

which is clearly distinct to the probability equation given by Bell (1964) and included
previously as equation (23.12). The use of equations (23.16)–(23.19) and the overall
superposition probability, equation (23.20), is completely free of the assumptions
used to arrive at Bell’s theorem.

Duarte and Taylor (2021) introduced a straightforward all-quantum measurement
protocol for secure quantum entanglement communications that includes the
following steps:
1. Perform a series of measurements, in free space, while actively and
continuously monitoring that no third party intruders are present. Thus
arrive at an experimentally determined intrinsic quantum superposition

24.1 Introduction
Quantum teleportation, as described by Bennett et al (1993), consists in the
disintegration of one quantum state, at the emitter’s site, and the subsequent
reintegration, or reassembling, of that quantum state at the receiver’s site. In other
words, what is teleported is a mathematical statement.
This teleportation of a quantum state, from one site to another site, is based on
the physics made possible by the Pryce–Ward probability amplitude

subsequent reassembling of the same quantum state at the receiver’s site is described.

The mechanics of teleporting one quantum state from the transmitter’s site to the
receiver’s site can be illustrated using the scheme hinted by Kim et al (2001).

the state to be reassembled at the receiver’s site. This is what constitutes the action of
teleportation.
The emitter can generate an entangled state of the form of any of the probability
amplitudes given in equations (24.8)–(24.11). Assume that the entangled state
selected to perform the teleportation operation is that given in equation (24.8).

Following the multiplication of ϕ

s 23 , the original state to be teleported has
been disassembled and now photon 3 is projected on the original input state.
In this methodology if the emitter measures the probability corresponding to ∣〉
+
s 12 ,
the qbit communicated to the receiver is ϕ
∣〉+
3 . In this case, the only unitary trans-
formation needed is the identity matrix I. If, on the other hand, ∣〉

s 12 is communicated
then the receiver must apply the appropriate unitary transformation on ϕ
∣〉−
3 to recover
the original quantum state. In each case the necessary unitary transformation is
communicated classically by the emitter to the receiver (Kim et al 2001).

using any of these states the receiver can recreate the original state ϕ

represented by photon 3 using the appropriate unitary transformation.
24.3 Technology
An interesting aspect of quantum teleportation is the unitary transformations. These
unitary transformations are performed using electro-optical modulators (EOM) (Ma
et al 2012). From a wider perspective, however, the quantum teleportation experi-
ments integrate a variety of technologies including lasers, spontaneous parametric
down conversion, half wave plates, quarter wave plates, polarizing beam splitters,
ﬁber beam splitters, prisms, mirrors, telescopes, and single-photon detectors. For
instance, the experiment performed by Ma et al (2012), over a distance of 143 km,
included more than 60 optics and electro-optics components. Indeed, it is remark-
able that despite the elaborate and complex nature of the experiments these
researchers report teleportation ﬁdelities in the
−
0.76 0.80 range. An additional

formation, i.e. ϕ

25.1 Introduction
The ﬁrst discussion of quantum logic appeared in the von Neumann book titled
Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics. In this book a quantum quantity
is associated with the values of 0 and 1. The value of this quantity is 1, if it is veriﬁed,
and 0, if it is not veriﬁed (von Neumann 1932).
In a more contemporaneous setting, quantum mechanics began its open literature
association with computers, or computing, in the mid 1980s (Feynman 1982, 1985,
1986, Zurek 1984, Deutsch 1985, Peres 1985).
Among the topics that drove initial interest in this subject were the search for a
Hamiltonian suitable for a universal computer, computational reversibility, and
energy dissipation (Feynman 1985). The concept of quantum bit or qbit was
introduced in the mid 1990s (Schumacher 1995).
In addition to improvements in computational speed, reduced power consump-
tion, and size minimization, quantum computing includes computations based on
quantum superposition and quantum entanglement which are totally beyond the
scope of classical ‘universal’ computers. In this regard, the real universal computers
are the quantum computers.

using an optimally programmed classical computer takes

corresponding physical interferometric computer, which is analogous to a quantum
computer, takes approximately

3 s (Duarte 2003, 2014). This represents
an improvement in computational time better than

indicate that the vast majority of the time taken in the
≈
×
−
t

3 s is due to the
electronic processing needed to record and display the quantum interferometric result.
Initially, quantum entanglement was not the focus of attention in the quantum
computer research ﬁeld. These concepts were explicitly brought together around
1994 when equations of the form

were highlighted and discussed along concepts of quantum computing (Zeilinger
et al 1994).
One further observation is that toward the year 2000, and beyond, in addition to
the insertion of quantum entanglement, via equations of the form of the Pryce–Ward
probability amplitude, the ﬁeld of quantum computing began to reﬂect concepts
originating in the philosophical path via the introduction of terminology such as
‘Bell states’ and ‘EPR pairs’ (see, for instance, Nielsen and Chuang 2000).
The ﬁeld of quantum computing, or quantum computers, is rather extensive with
well over 200 000 articles published with the words ‘quantum computing’ by early
2022. In addition to being the focus of a multitude of researchers, quantum
computing is a rapidly evolving ﬁeld with emerging technical advances aimed at
achieving practical working quantum computers. The aim of this chapter is simply
to provide a brief perspective on the presence of quantum entanglement principles in
the area of quantum computation. For reviews of basic concepts in optical quantum
computing the reader may consult Steane (1998) and Kok et al (2007).
25.2 Entropy
An important characteristic of quantum computers can be described from the
perspective of the von Neumann entropy
ρ
ρ
ρ
= −
S
Tr
( )
[ ln ],
(25.2)
where ρ is the density matrix describing an ensemble of states of a relevant quantum
system and Tr is the trace of the matrix ρ
ρ
[
ln ] (von Neumann 1932). This means
that the larger the number of states involved… the larger the entropy. According to
Schumacher (1995) ‘the entropy
ρ
S( ) of a signal ensemble of pure states can be
interpreted as the number of qbits per signal necessary to transpose it with near-
perfect ﬁdelity’. Transposition with high ﬁdelity is central to quantum computing,
thus making the reduction in computational noise crucial.
25.3 Qbits
Richard Feynman (1985, 1986) introduced the nexus between the concept of the bit
and the quantum states ∣〉
1 and ∣〉
0 . He then went on to propose that one bit can be
represented by a single atom being either in the ∣〉
1 state or the ∣〉
0 state.

Equation (25.6) is a general principle that means that a single state, or probability amplitude,
can be expressed as a linear combination of two other states (Feynman et al 1965).
In the case of the ∣〉

0 states the combined probability amplitude of interest
can be expressed as

where C1 and C2 are themselves probability amplitudes and therefore complex numbers.
This is an example of a superposition. Once normalized this probability amplitude

terminology was introduced by Schumacher (1995).
The∣〉

can be expressed via equations such as

These four states have become known as ‘fully entangled Bell bases’ (Zeilinger et al

Thus demonstrating an inherent capability for mathematical operations. This simple
concept has signiﬁcant practical implications. It means that beams of entangled
photons interacting with optical apparata conﬁgured with optical elements capable
of transforming the entangled states can be used to perform optical quantum
computations.
In addition to the polarization rotator, other optical components of interest in
optical computers are the beam splitter and the Mach–Zehnder interferometer.
These are considered in appendix C.

These identities show yet an additional avenue to derive the quantum entanglement
probability amplitudes provided that the Pauli matrices are arrived at independently
and from ﬁrst principles. For further insights see chapter 29.

probability amplitude of quantum entanglement are introduced.

In other words, a polarization rotator behaves mathematically exactly as the σx Pauli
matrix. Indeed, the Pauli σx matrix is the mathematical realization of a quantum
NOT gate whose truth table is given below:
′
a a
0 1
1 0.
Using the Feynman approach the quantum NOT gate is illustrated pictorially in
ﬁgure 25.1. Furthermore, the observation summarized in equation (25.43) implies
that any optical element that can be related to one of Pauli’s matrices is capable of
implementing a gate for a quantum computer.
It should be noted that in practice an optical element that induces a π/2
polarization rotation can be realized using a half wave plate, a wavelength speciﬁc
Fresnel rhomb, or a broadband collinear prismatic rotator (Duarte 1989, 2014).

A quantum NOT gate was demonstrated by Pelliccia et al (2003) via polarization
methods.
In classical universal computers logical gates such as AND, NAND, OR, NOR,
and NOT form the bases for logical operations. In quantum computing a gate that
was of particular interest to Feynman (1985) was the controlled NOT gate or CNOT
gate. The truth table for the CNOT gate is given by (Feynman 1985)
′ ′
a b a b
0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1
1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0.
In the truth table of the CNOT gate the value of b′ is changed if and only if the value
of
=
a
1. The pictorial representation of the CNOT gate is illustrated in ﬁgure 25.2.
The interest on the CNOT gate arrives from the fact that this is a fundamental
gate for the generation of quantum entanglement states. The ﬁrst realization of a
quantum CNOT gate was reported by Wineland and colleagues (Monroe et al
1995).
25.6.1 Pauli gates
There are three Pauli gates (Moore and Nilsson 2001, Childs 2005) and they are
identiﬁed as depicted in ﬁgure 25.3. Each Pauli matrix (σx, σy, σz) provides the
mathematical representation for each of the corresponding gates. Each of the Pauli
gates act on a single qbits. The Pauli-X gate is equivalent to the NOT gate and
physically, as already indicated in equation (25.43), it induces a polarization rotation
of π/2 radians.

25.9 Technology
It has been known for a while that quantum-optics based computing techniques can
perform interferometric calculations in the millisecond regime that take hours to be
performed in optimally programmed conventional universal computers (Duarte
1993, 2003). Certainly, the promise of quantum computing is beyond enormous.
Two important areas of technological development in optical quantum comput-
ing are high-ﬁdelity computations, based on either quantum superposition or
quantum entanglement, and the capability to handle large numbers of qbits. The
aim here is to generate large numbers of qbits,103,106, or higher in an extremely low
noise environment so that single-photon registrations can be identiﬁed with high
ﬁdelity. This ﬁeld is rapidly evolving while incorporating new single-photon-pair
sources and improved single-photon detection technology. Once a large number of
qbits, in the
⩽
⩽
N
10
10
3
qbit
6 range, are generated routinely with high ﬁdelity, the
task will be a meaningful effort in miniaturization that will translate the technology
to an on-chip realization (Duarte 2019).
At present, this ﬁeld is rapidly advancing with numerous competing approaches.
This exciting, and fast moving, state of development renders any attempt to
summarize the technology obsolete almost as soon as it is written. Non-optical
‘big-tech’ approaches to quantum computing have garnered a lot of media attention.
However, optically based quantum computing should not be dismissed in its ability
to handle large number of qbits in the
⩽
⩽
N

10
3
qbit
6 range, or even more.

Chapter 26
Space-to-space and space-to-Earth
communications via quantum entanglement
Space-to-space and space-to-Earth communications in the context of the probability
amplitude for quantum entanglement are discussed.
26.1 Introduction
The physics of quantum entanglement led to quantum cryptography, and quantum
cryptography led to the concept of long-distance secure communications and
eventually to long-distance free-space secure communications and space-to-space
cryptographic communications. This is a subject still in its early infancy.
From a historical perspective it is indicated that one of the ﬁrst explicit links
between quantum entanglement and space-to-space communications was made by
Aspelmeyer et al (2003). More recently, this subject has been addressed, from an
alternative perspective, by Duarte and Taylor (2015) and Duarte (2016). For an
introduction and review of the concepts of space-to-space laser communications the
reader may refer to Lambert and Casey (1995).
Important parameters for space-to-space, space-to-Earth, and Earth–space–
Earth optics communications include (Duarte and Taylor 2021):
∙conﬁgurational compactness
∙detection efﬁciency
∙mechanical ruggedness
∙optical ruggedness
∙orbital altitude: either low Earth orbit (LEO: ~200−1000 km) or geosta-
tionary orbit (GEO: ~35 786 km)
∙pointing and tracking errors
∙power consumption
∙propagation losses
∙radiation ruggedness

∙signal-to-noise ratio
∙system reliability
∙system weight. In this chapter a brief introduction to salient features of space-
to-space and space-to-Earth quantum entanglement communications is given.
26.2 Space-to-space configurations
The beauty of space-to-space laser, or optical, communications is that physicists and
engineers do not have to deal with atmospheric turbulence. In this regard, the
vacuum of space is an ideal propagation medium. However, due to the large
distances involved the technologies of acquisition, tracking, and pointing assume an
augmented importance.
For reviews on these technologies the reader is referred to Lambert and Casey
(1995) and Kaushal and Kaddoum (2017). In this section attention is limited to
simple space-to-space conﬁgurational arrangements inherently relevant to the
optical architectures of quantum entanglement systems. The main concern in these
long-distance arrangements, which will not be quantiﬁed here but are considered by
Aspelmeyer et al (2003), are losses which increase as the aperture diameter of the
transmitter and receiver optics decreases.
First,
communications
between
two
parties,
A
and
B,
are
considered.
Traditionally in communications systems the transmitting party A, creates, gen-
erates, and transmits the message and thus it is close to the transmission source. The
receiving party B can be either a passive receiver, as outlined in ﬁgure 26.1, or could
also have transmitting capabilities, as outlined in ﬁgure 26.2. In cryptographic
quantum entanglement arrangements B needs some sort of transmitting capability
so that the quantum code, or key, can be veriﬁed. Also, in quantum entanglement
conﬁgurations the source S can be remote to both A and B as illustrated in
Figure 26.1. Diagram depicting laser, or photon, communications between a transmitting satellite A and a
receiving satellite B.
Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement (Second Edition)
26-2

ﬁgure 26.3. This is a feature that became apparent from the very ﬁrst schematics on
quantum entanglement (Pryce and Ward 1947, Ward 1949).
A likely scenario that will have to be met by quantum entanglement cryptography
satellites is that of a series of satellites intercommunicating with each other either in
LEO or GEO, as outlined in ﬁgure 26.4. Depending on the orbit, inter-satellite array
separation distances D of interest are in the
×

(Duarte 2016). Quantum entanglement cryptography systems will have to adapt
to satisfy satellite network array conﬁgurations and practical inter-satellite distan-
ces. Duarte and Taylor (2021) provide a series of calculations, in graphical format,

giving the number of detected quanta as a function of source brightness, source
wavelength, and number of satellites in a given satellite constellation.
26.3 Experiments
In this section two relevant experiments are considered: the Delingha–Lijiang
experiment (Yin et al 2017) and the experiment based at the International Space
Station (Villar et al 2020).
26.3.1 The space-to-earth experiment
The Delingha–Lijiang experiment (Yin et al 2017) took place at an altitude of
~500 km. This experimental conﬁguration followed the pattern outlined in
ﬁgure 26.3 with the difference that both A and B were located on the ground. The
terrestrial distance between A and B is reported to be 1203 km while the distance
between S and A is reported to vary in the
⩽

1700

km range while the
distance between S and B is reported to vary in the
⩽
⩽
D

km range.
The source at the satellite is a 30 mW diode laser emitting at λ ≈405 nm, with a
linewidth of
ν
Δ = 160 MHz, utilized to excite a KTiOPO4 (PPKTP) crystal within a
Sagnac interferometer conﬁguration capable of generating
×

106 photon pairs
per second with a reported ﬁdelity of
±
0.907
007 at λ ≈810 nm (Yin et al 2017).
The two entangled beams are emitted via 300 mm and 180 mm aperture Cassegrain
telescopes. The receiving telescopes were also of the Cassegrain class with apertures
of 1200 mm and 1800 mm (Yin et al 2017). Overall, this experiment included some
130 optics and electro-optics components.
The entangled polarization state generated by the emitter was of the form

Following the 810 nm quanta pair source there is an optical set composed of QWP
−QWP−HWP plates used ‘for polarization compensation’ (Yin et al 2017).

transmitting and receiving capabilities.

An additional set of QWP−QWP−HWP plates is installed prior to the entrance of
both receiving telescopes on Earth.
The integrity of the transmission was corroborated using Bell’s inequality (Bell
1964), as expressed in chapter 10

(Yin et al 2017), thus violating Bell’s inequality.
It is interesting to note the apparent minimal adverse effects from atmospheric
turbulence and absorption on these reported measurements. However, this is not
entirely unexpected as minimal turbulence effects on the transmission of interfero-
metric signals have been previously reported from measurements in terrestrial
environments noted for their average high humidity and turbulence (Duarte et al
2011).
26.3.2 The International Space Station experiment
A ‘nanosatellite’ in-orbit quantum entanglement experiment launched from the
International Space Station (Villar et al 2020) took place at an altitude of ~408 km.
This experiment included only about 13 optical and electro-optical parts. The
emission source is a diode-laser pumped BBO conﬁguration in series that yields pairs
of quanta with orthogonal polarizations which are nearly collinear. The CW pump
diode laser emits a power of 17 mW at λ ≈405 nm with a linewidth of
ν
Δ ≈160
MHz. The type I spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) emission is
reported as

indicate that this type I SPDC source produces entangled quanta pairs described by

26.4 Further horizons
The physics of quantum entanglement has been known since 1947 (Pryce and Ward
1947) and experimental conﬁrmations have been forthcoming since 1948 (Bleuler
and Bradt 1948, Hanna 1948, Wu and Shaknov 1950). In this regard, the ﬁeld has
moved beyond physics and into the realm of engineering.
From a practical and technological perspective, space-to-space, space-to-Earth,
Earth-to-space, and Earth–space–Earth quantum cryptography communications
require tangible advances in two speciﬁc areas: source brightness and conﬁgura-
tional compactness. Improved electro-optics integration is needed in order to

minimize the number of components necessary to achieve secure communications in
an efﬁcient and reliable fashion. Conceptual advances in the physics of quantum
entanglement should lead to optics system simpliﬁcation and conﬁgurational
improvements.

communications by using (Duarte and Taylor 2021)

Chapter 27
Space-to-space quantum interferometric
communications
Space-to-space communications based in the generation of N-slit quantum inter-
ferometric characters (QICs), originating from the Dirac–Feynman probability
amplitude principle, are described. It is emphasized that the security integrity of
this approach is inherently protected by the probability amplitude principle and does
not require the generation of a key, or a code, nor does it need to use Bell’s theorem.
27.1 Introduction
Previously, in chapter 17, it has been shown how the probability amplitude for two
quanta propagating in opposite directions, with entanglement polarizations (Pryce
and Ward 1947, Ward 1949)

In this chapter it is shown how the generalized N-slit probability equations derived from
this principle can be used to generate quantum interferometric characters (QICs) for
long-distance communications and how quantum mechanics inherently protects these
interferometric signals from being harvested by a third party intruder. In contrast to
quantum entanglement methodology, this approach does not require a key, or code, and
the meaning of the QICs can be made public if the communicating parties, A or B, so
desire. There is also no need to use Bell’s theorem (Bell 1964) to verify security. An
additional advantage over quantum entanglement communications is that albeit

communications can use single-photon sources, the equations equally apply to
ensembles of indistinguishable photons as available from single-transverse-mode
single-longitudinal-mode narrow-linewidth lasers. This improves enormously the efﬁ-
ciency of the communications and the signal-to-noise ratio thus relaxing the require-
ments on detection technology. One disadvantage of the interferometric approach is
related to beam divergence characteristics which might limit its applicability over very
long deep space-to-space distances. Also, this approach is only applicable to free-space
communications and is not suitable to transmissions via optical ﬁbers.
This approach to free-space communications was ﬁrst mentioned in the literature
by Duarte (2002) and further details have been published in Duarte (2005, 2014,
2016), Duarte et al (2010, 2011), and Duarte and Taylor (2015).

27.3 The generation and transmission of interferometric characters
The N-slit interferometer is comprised of a single-transverse-mode narrow-linewidth
laser capable of generating populations of indistinguishable photons. The laser is
then followed by a one dimensional non-focusing beam expander such as a multiple-
prism beam expander (Duarte and Piper 1982, Duarte 1987, Duarte 2015). This
combined laser-beam–expander system becomes the source of indistinguishable
photons s. The expanded narrow-linewidth laser beam then illuminates an array of
N-slits ( j). The transmitter A controls the number of slits being illuminated and thus
the interferometric character to be transmitted. The receiver B is at the interfero-
metric plane d. The intra-interferometric distance between j and the interference
plane x is denoted as
〈∣〉
D d j and the whole system is depicted in ﬁgure 27.2.
Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement (Second Edition)

The interferometric characters are generated by assigning a number of slits to a given
alpha-numerical character. For instance,

N
2 is a,
=
N

=
N
4 is c…
=
N
26 is
z (Duarte 2002, 2015). Any attempt by a third party to obtain information from the
propagating interferometric character has a catastrophic effect on the character and
destroys the information being sent from A to B and also renders useless the information
received by the intruder or eavesdropper (Duarte 2002). There is no need for a quantum
key or code. If spying is detected, the only action needed is for B to communicate to A
that an interception has occurred. The simplicity of the system also allows B to have
interferometric transmitting capabilities. A protocol to detect possible interception, and
re-transmission, of the QICs by cloaked intruders is discussed by Duarte (2016).
27.4 The inherent quantum security mechanism
Probability amplitudes are inherently extremely sensitive to even minute physical
transformations. If a further intermediate plane such as a beam splitter k, is
introduced between j, and d as illustrated in ﬁgure 27.3, then the probability
amplitude undergoes a severe alteration and becomes

This probability amplitude introduces two propagation distances

than just

microscopic ﬁber, such as a spider web silk ﬁber, the probability amplitude is transformed to

Certainly, these transformations to the probability amplitude transform the prob-
ability and ultimately the measured spatial intensity that depends directly on the
probability distribution.

The effect of inserting very thin high-surface-quality beam splitters, in an attempt
to extract information from the propagating interferometric character, demolishes
the propagating interferogram and has been documented amply in the literature
(Duarte 2002, 2005, 2016).
Even attempts to utilize extremely subtle non-demolition methods of interception,
via the use of microscopic transparent spider web silk ﬁbers, transforms the
propagating interferogram as documented by Duarte et al (2013). These authors
documented the very ﬁrst diffraction pattern superimposed on one of the ‘wings’ of a
propagating interferogram. The interferogram corresponds to the IQC b (

N
3),
and is illustrated in its original form in ﬁgure 27.4. The intercepted IQC b obtained

directly applied to N-slit interferometry (Duarte 2013a, 2013b, 2014). This imme-
diately implies that the core physics for phenomenology derived from either
equation is subject to identical quantum principles (Duarte and Taylor 2015).
This means that the transmission of information, or communications, based on
either equation are intrinsically shielded from in-transit observation.
From a technological–engineering perspective, communications based on quan-
tum entanglement physics appear to be more suitable to long range communica-
tions, that is in the

5 km range. On the other hand communications based on
QICs generated via N-slit quantum interferometry do not require quantum key
distribution (QKD), offer very attractive signal-to-noise ratios, and are based on an
extremely simple optical conﬁguration. These qualities are technologically attractive
for satellite arrays in LEO requiring links in the

a 10 cm single slit illuminated by an expanded beam. For the calculation
assume that the 10 cm slit is comprised of 1000 equally spaced imaginary
slits. Note: examples of these types of diffractive calculations are given in
Duarte (1993). A program to perform this type of calculations is given in
Duarte (2014).

Quanta pair sources for quantum entanglement

The principles of the various sources applied to generate polarization entangled
quanta pairs are brieﬂy reviewed. These include the

64Cu sources used in
the early Compton scattering experiments, the optically pumped 40Ca source used in
visible spectrum experiments, and type I and type II spontaneous parametric down-
conversion. Possible future sources are also considered.
28.1 Introduction
In this chapter a brief description of the important features of various sources used
to generate quanta pairs, exhibiting orthogonal polarizations relative to each other,
is provided.

was utilized by Bleuler and Bradt (1948), Hanna (1948), and Wu and Shaknov
(1950), to generate gamma rays from 64Cu at a wavelength compatible with an
energy of ~ 1 MeV (Kasday et al 1975). This energy translates into a wavelength of
λ ≈

wavelength originating from annihilation radiation in
64Cu indicates that the
corresponding wavelength is λ ≈

The three original experiments utilized deuteron bombardment to activate
the 64Cu source which was conﬁned at the center of a narrow cavity conﬁgured
within a solid block of lead as outlined in ﬁgure 28.1. The geometrical disposition
of the 64Cu emitter within the cavity restricts emission in the +z and −z directions,
which is one of the central requirements of the original theory (Dirac 1930,
Wheeler 1946, Pryce and Ward 1947, Ward 1949). It is reasonable to assume that
the +z and −z emission, originally labeled as +k and −k, is within the λ
Δλ
±
distribution.
The correlation features of this emission are the following:
1. Both quanta are emitted collinearly in the +z and −z directions to satisfy the
pair theory which is articulated by Wheeler’s dictum: ‘if one of these photons
is linearly polarized in one plane, then the photon that goes off in the
opposite direction, with equal momentum is linearly polarized in the
perpendicular plane’ (Wheeler 1946).
2. The emitted quanta have correlated polarizations as explained above. In this
annihilation emission the conservation of momenta and the emission of
quanta with orthogonal polarizations are inherently related.
3. Originating from the same 64Cu decay transition both quanta are assumed to
have the same frequencies (ν
ν
=
1
2) and are, therefore, indistinguishable in
the frequency domain.
4. Both quanta are emitted from the same active volume.
28.3 Atomic Ca emission
The use of 40Ca as active medium was introduced by Kocher and Commins (1967).
These authors used a H2 arc lamp for UV excitation. This optical pumping leads to
the population of an upper lying level in 40Ca that results in the emission of two-step
sequential

in ﬁgure 28.3, utilized a single-mode krypton ion laser emitting at λ

and a tunable dye laser emitting at λ

nm. The two excitation lasers are said
to have ‘parallel polarizations’ and the emission photons ν1 and ν2 have ‘correlated
polarizations’ (Aspect et al 1981).
The correlation features of this emission are the following:
1. The quanta pair is emitted collinearly in the +z and −z directions.
2. The emission of both quanta originates from the same

28.4 Type I spontaneous parametric down-conversion
Type I spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) as a source of pairs of
entangled photons was demonstrated by Shih and Alley (1988). This approach takes
advantage of the phase matching conditions

where ω is the frequency of the pump laser while ω1 and ω2 are the frequencies of the
two quanta, emitted in divergent directions, from the nonlinear crystal. Similarly, ˆk
is the wave vector of the pump laser while ˆk1 and ˆk2 are the wave vectors of the two
quanta, emitted in divergent directions (see ﬁgure 28.4(a)). For an extensive review
of type I parametric down-conversion the reader is referred to Orr et al (2016).
In their work, Shih and Alley (1988) utilized the fourth harmonic of a Nd:YAG
laser, at λ ≈266 nm, as the excitation source for a KD*P crystal. The emission was
at λ ≈532 nm. Since ˆk, ˆk1,and ˆk2 must be in the same plane, coplanar irises were

employed as spatial ﬁlters for ω1 and ω2. The emission for ω1 and ω2 was inherently
polarized in the ∣〉

state. Following each iris a λ/4 wave plate was deployed to
produce two left-hand circularly polarized beams∣〉
L , one of those beams underwent
two further reﬂections to produce a right-hand polarized beam ∣〉
R . Thus the
entanglement was examined using pairs of photons in the ∣〉
L and ∣〉
R states (Shih
and Alley 1988).
It should be pointed out that with ω1 and ω2 polarized in the ∣〉
y state the simple
deployment of a π/2 polarization rotator in one of the beams should produce the
desired ∣〉
x and ∣〉
y states. The correlation features of this emission are the following:
1. The emitted quanta, ν1 and ν2, have correlated identical polarizations. This
feature requires the use of external optics to obtain ∣〉

R states or ∣〉

y states.
2. The emitted quanta have the same frequencies (ν
ν

2) and are, therefore,
indistinguishable in the frequency domain.
3. The emission of both quanta originates from the same active volume.
An alternative collinear, non-degenerate, type I SPDC conﬁguration has been
demonstrated by Villar et al (2020). In this conﬁguration CW pump diode laser

emits a power of 17 mW at λ ≈405 nm with a linewidth of Δν ≈160 MHz. This
type I SPDC emission is reported as generating
×
5.9
106 photon pairs per second at
λ ≈800 nm.
The use of subwavelength nonlinear ﬁlms, such as LN and GaP, have been
recently demonstrated as miniaturized sources of entangled photon pairs in the near
infrared. The emission of the pairs is collinear and the generation process is
identiﬁed as SPDC (Santiago-Cruz et al 2022).
28.5 Type II spontaneous parametric down-conversion
Inherently entangled ∣〉
x and ∣〉
y states, or ∣
〉
H and ∣

V states, can be produced from
type II SPDC as reported by Kwiat et al (1995). In type II SPDC the orthogonal
states of polarization are generated from a single nonlinear crystal via ordinary and
extraordinary polarization. The emission axes are at an angle to each other and the
emission occurs distributed within two propagation cones. Conical refraction in
crystals is described by Born and Wolf (1999).
According to Kwiat et al (1995) the emission of ω1 and ω2 is inherently entangled

β-barium borate (BBO) crystal which emitted at λ ≈702 nm and the ω1 and ω2
photons were guided towards their respective detectors via coplanar irises as in the
type I arrangement of Shih and Alley (1988), see ﬁgure 28.4(b).
In an alternative experimental arrangement Yin et al (2017) report on the use
of a PPKTP crystal within a Sagnac interferometer. The pump laser was a
30 mW diode laser emitting at λ ≈405 nm with a linewidth of Δν = 160 MHz.
The emission is reported as

appendix C.
The correlation features of this emission are the following:
1. The emitted quanta, ν1 and ν2, have correlated polarizations with the
polarization of one quanta ∣〉

quanta ∣〉

2. The emitted quanta have the same frequencies (ν

from parametric down-conversion photon pair sources can be described as follows:

Hence, the complete normalized probability amplitude can be written as (28.8)

28.7 Alternative quantum pair sources
Given its solid-state status and its compactness, SPDC has become by far the most
pervasive avenue to achieve emission of polarization entangled photon pairs.
Limitations of this methodology include the use of an indirect method of excitation,
via optical pumping, and very low conversion efﬁciencies as it becomes apparent
from the ﬁgures provided by Yin et al (2017): only

One area of alternative emission device development that has received attention
are quantum dot biexiton sources. For instance a InAs quantum dot embedded in a
p–i–n heterostructure planar microcavity is reported to yield circularly polarized
photons in the state

Again, no information on the net number of entangled photons is given. However it
is indicated that the biexiton emission yields, on average, about 1000 counts per
second. This type of photon count per second, from semiconductor emitters, can be
consistent with peak powers in the nanowatt range (Duarte et al 2005). Efforts to
generate indistinguishable photons from multiple quantum dots have also been
reported (Singh et al 2019).
28.8 Further horizons
Quantum mechanics not only describes single photons or quanta pairs. As taught by
Dirac (1958) the same physics applies to ensembles of indistinguishable photons or
indistinguishable quanta. As already discussed in chapter 2, the Pryce–Ward
probability amplitude of quantum entanglement can be written as (Duarte and
Taylor 2021)

That is, all the indistinguishable quanta comprising ensemble I are polarized in the

in the ∣〉

and ∣〉
y II are themselves entangled. This opens the possibility of designing sources of
entangled laser emission thus vastly improving the signal-to-noise conditions for
quantum communications. The detection statistics of states with n indistinguishable
bosons is discussed by Feynman et al (1965). Coherent ensemble states described by

states in opposite directions, via the use of intracavity elements driven by quantum
random number generators (QRNG), have been suggested by Duarte (2018).
Other proposed avenues to generate high-brightness sources for quantum
entanglement experiments include Raman based devices in the visible (Little et al
2021)

a departure from the original requirement introduced by Wheeler (1946).

Chapter 29
Quantum interferometric principles
Fundamental principles and ideas applicable to quantum interferometry and
quantum entanglement are discussed. These concepts include the Dirac–Feynman
interferometric principle, quantum superposition, Dirac’s identities, the photon
nonlocality, and quantum measurements.
29.1 Introduction
The transparent and straightforward quantum principles applicable to interferom-
etry and quantum entanglement are described and discussed.
29.2 Fundamental principles of quantum mechanics
As mentioned in chapter 1, from an interferometric perspective the very basic
quantum mechanical framework needed to make the physics work can be based on a
series of fundamentals laws, or principles. For convenience, these principles are
restated here:
1. Theorem: The probability amplitude for a single quantum is mathematically
identical to the probability amplitude for an ensemble of indistinguishable
quanta.
2. The probability amplitude for a single quantum, or an ensemble of r
indistinguishable quanta, is given by the Dirac–Feynman superposition
interferometric principle (Feynman et al 1965)
∑
〈∣〉=
〈∣〉〈∣〉
=
d s
d j
j s .
(29.1)
i
N
1
The N in this superposition series means that every propagation path must
be incorporated in the calculation.
3. The principle of superposition: ‘Any state may be considered as the result of
a superposition of two or more other states… conversely any two or more
doi:10.1088/978-0-7503-5269-7ch29
29-1
ª IOP Publishing Ltd 2022

states may be superposed to give a new state’ (Dirac 1958). Feynman refers
to the j states as base states… ‘any quantum mechanical state can be
described completely by the amplitude 〈∣〉
j s to go into the base states… any
state in the world can be expressed as a superposition… of base states’
(Feynman et al 1965). The Dirac–Feynman interferometric principle,
expressed in equation (29.1), is inherently linked to the principle of
superposition.
Further examples of superposition are the interferometric probability

8. Nonlocality: ‘Photons cannot be localized… and they do not behave at all
like particles’ (Lamb 1995). This is totally compatible with Heisenberg’s
uncertainty principle.
9. Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (Heisenberg 1927):
Δ Δ
≈
p x
h.
(29.12)
10. Born’s rule: the probability is given by multiplying the probability ampli-
tude with its complex conjugate (Born 1926)
∣〈∣〉∣= 〈∣〉〈∣〉∗
d s
d s d s .
(29.13)

Probability amplitudes such as 〈∣〉
d s are complex numbers. The straightfor-
ward multiplication of the probability amplitude with its complex conjugate
via Born’s rule 〈∣〉〈∣〉〈∣〉∗
d s d s d s
provides a probability less than or equal to
one. This step opens the door into the measurements realm.
11. Measurables: the measured intensity, at a given frequency, is proportional
to the quantum probability
∝〈∣〉〈∣〉∗
I
d s d s .
(29.14)
Probabilities and polarization are also measurable quantities. Intensity is
given in units of energy per meter square per second (J m−2 s−1). The energy
of a single photon is given by Planck’s quantum energy equation (Planck
1901) which gave birth to quantum mechanics
ν
=
E
h .
(29.15)
For a population of r indistinguishable photons
ν
=
E
rh .
These straightforward laws, and/or principles, of quantum mechanics
provide the foundations of the knowledge needed to quantify generalized
quantum interference and quantum entanglement.
29.3 Nonlocality of the photon
In chapter 1 it was mentioned that from Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
Δ Δ
≈
p x
h
(29.16)
the space–frequency identity
ν
Δ Δ
≈
x
c
(29.17)
can be derived (Duarte 2003). This is quite real to any observant experimental physicist
that has played with Mach–Zehnder interferometers, for instance. If such interferometer
is built with a narrow-linewidth laser exhibiting a linewidth of
ν
Δ then the overall linear
space of intra-interferometric distance for which interference will be observed is
ν
Δ
≈Δ
x
c .
(29.18)
Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement (Second Edition)
29-3

Single photons exhibit extremely narrow linewidths and correspondingly can exhibit
enormous coherence lengths.
In a quantum entanglement experiment two indistinguishable, extremely narrow-
linewidth photons, are emitted in opposite directions. This extremely narrow
linewidth allows an extremely large coherence length determined by the analogous
expression of the uncertainty principle
ν
Δ Δ
≈
x
c. Hence, it is not difﬁcult to observe
that the emitted quanta will continue to interact after emission from their common
source. The overall implications of photon nonlocality have yet to be fully explored
experimentally.
Following the Lamb doctrine on the nonlocality of the photon (Lamb 1995) the
interferometric statement ‘All the indistinguishable photons illuminate the array of
N slits, or grating, simultaneously. If only one photon propagates, at any given time,
then that individual photon illuminates the whole array of N slits simultaneously’
(Duarte 2003) becomes clear.
Nonlocality of the photon is a remarkable quantum feature completely at odds
with ‘classical expectations’. The best way to think about the photon is as a form of
coherent energy with nonlocal properties.
29.4 Indistinguishability and Dirac’s identities
As highlighted in chapter 17, and previous publications (Duarte 2013a, 2013b,
2014), crucial to the development of the quantum entanglement probability
amplitude is the Dirac identity (Dirac 1958)
∣
〉= ∣〉∣〉∣〉…∣〉

(29.19)

which means that indistinguishable quanta
…n
1, 2, 3,
can be in different states.
When referring to this ‘curious phenomena… having no analogue in classical
theory’, Dirac is writing about quanta of the ‘same kind’ and ‘absolutely indis-
tinguishable from one another’. At the same time he is also contemplating arrays of
identical quanta in different sates such as ∣〉
∣〉

and so on, that apply to the very same, utterly indistinguishable, quanta in different
states.
This leads to the concept of a series of indistinguishable quanta in different states
of polarization, for instance (see chapter 20). More speciﬁcally, these Dirac identities
are applicable, for example, to a single-transverse-mode single-longitudinal-mode
laser beam of indistinguishable quanta including both, ∣〉
x
and ∣〉
y , states of
polarization. For ∣〉

These concepts have been applied to describe highly coherent directional emission
from electrically pumped organic semiconductors within an interferometric conﬁg-
uration (Duarte and Taylor 2022).
29.5 Quantum measurements
Here, quantum measurements are considered using probability amplitudes and
quantum probabilities in an interferometric environment. The discussion is appli-
cable to single-photon propagation and the propagation of ensembles of indistin-
guishable quanta. The discussion is extended to quantum entanglement situations.
From the perspective of this monograph the measurements and the ‘measurables’
deﬁne the experiment and hence reality itself.
Implicit in this discussion is the concept that quantum measurement principles
apply to nanoscopic as well as macroscopic situations (Feynman and Hibbs 1965,
van Kampen 1988).
29.5.1 Probability amplitudes
In quantum mechanics the physics is described via probability amplitudes. In other
words, the physics of the experiment must be correctly described via probability
amplitudes. This is a mathematical realm referred to, by Dyson, as the ﬁrst layer of
quantum mechanics (Dyson 2007).
The most fundamental form of probability amplitude describing quanta prop-
agation, in free space, from j to d, is represented in bra ket notation as
〈∣〉
d j .
(29.24)
Since the photon propagates in space from j to d, through a spatial distance
〈∣〉
D d j ,
at the speed of light
=
×
c
2.99792458
108 ms−1, this probability amplitude
inherently includes information about time and space. The issue of quantum time
is discussed in subsection 29.5.5.
The physics of interferometric propagation from a source s to the interferometric
plane d, via an array of slits j is accurately described by the Dirac–Feynman
principle

Considering all the alternatives is strongly emphasized by Feynman (Feynman and
Hibbs 1965).
If, however, the physics is modiﬁed via the insertion of an a single strand of a
transparent microscopic ﬁber, as illustrated in ﬁgure 29.1, the probability amplitude
is transformed to (Duarte et al 2013, Duarte 2019)

This probability amplitude introduces three intra-interferometric propagation
distances
〈∣〉
D j s ,
〈∣〉
D k j , and
〈∣〉
D d k rather than the originals
〈∣〉
D j s and
〈∣〉
D d j . The ﬁber
allows information to be extracted from the propagating interferogram. Thus, the
original propagating interferogram described by equation (29.1) ceases to exist and
immediately a new interferogram, described by equation (29.26) is observed (Duarte
et al 2013, Duarte 2019). Even the slightest alteration of the physics described by
〈∣〉= 〈∣〉〈∣〉+ 〈∣〉〈∣〉+ 〈∣〉〈∣〉… + 〈∣

space, leads to a new
probably amplitude as described by equation (29.26). Comparison between theory
and measurement is provided in ﬁgures 29.2 and 29.3.
In the case of

and it is this superposition probability that determines whether the measurer measures

entirely compatible with Dirac’s discussion on superposition: whilst considering the
superposition of two states, A and B, Dirac emphasized that the result of a measure-
ment on the superposed state is determined by the probability ‘depending on the
relative weights of A and B in the superposition’ (Dirac 1958).

As stated by Duarte and Taylor (2021), in both cases, quantum interference and
quantum entanglement, the ﬁnal weight of the states comprising the superposition is
entirely decided by the indeterministic, or statistical, nature of quantum mechanics.
Further, it is the whole superposition, the superposition mathematically conﬁg-
ured by all the states, that determines the correct mathematical conﬁguration of the
probability (Duarte 1997, 2014).
29.5.2 Quantum probabilities
The ‘measurables’ in quantum mechanics include probabilities, intensities, and
polarizations. This measurement realm is referred to, by Dyson, as the second layer
of quantum mechanics (Dyson 2007).
In this realm the superposition probability amplitudes described by equation
(29.1) or (29.25) become a quantum probability via Born’s rule 〈∣〉〈∣〉

its energy, the phenomenon manifests as a single triggered pixel in an array of un-
triggered pixels. That is, a single charge is created within the allowed probabilistic

probabilistic intensity distributions, such as equations (29.29) and (29.31), which are
a direct function of the superposition quantum probability 〈∣〉〈∣〉

To illustrate this point Duarte and Taylor (2021) consider a transmission grating
with

However, in the far ﬁeld, at a time

, is indicative of a higher regime of entropy. Hence, these interferometric
intensity distributions can be used to characterize the degree of entropy, or the arrow

Albeit time is observed from 〈∣〉〈∣〉

calculations, this does not necessarily
mean that in the quantum interferometric domain time is an ‘emergent’ quantity
since space and time are crucial and inherent to the very deﬁnition of the probability

approximately reproduce the propagation physics. Thus, as indicated by Duarte and
Taylor (2021), a series of high to low to high to low entropy regimes can be created.
The word approximately is used since losses in the beam shaping optics reduce the
illumination intensity slightly each time a beam transition is executed, thus ensuring
that the overall entropy keeps ascending. The concept of entropy reduction appears
to have been ﬁrst introduced by Schrödinger in his book What is Life?, where he
links biological life with the concept of ‘negative entropy’ (Schrödinger 1935). That
entropy can be subdued, even temporarily, should be reason for optimism.
29.5.5 The quantum measurer
As discussed by Duarte and Taylor (2021) quantum measurements are directly
inﬂuenced by the experimentalist, the measurer, or the observer:
1. The measurer decides what to measure: a quantum entanglement measure-
ment or a quantum interferometric measurement.
2. The measurer decides what tool to be used in the measurement: rotating
polarizer analyzers or ﬁxed detector conﬁgurations via polarizing beam
splitters.
3. The measurer plays a direct role in the measuring process since the recorded
probabilities depend on the surface quality of the optics selected by the
measurer, the electronic noise of the system built by the measurer, and the
ability or skill of the measurer to optimally align the optics.
4. As in the classical case, the measurer can affect signiﬁcantly the uncertainty
(i.e. errors) and reliability of the measurements. The skill of the measurer is
reﬂected in how little bias he, or she, introduces in the measurement.

5. The quantum situation is far more susceptible to the measurer’s decisions
since the results of the measurements can be severely altered, even cata-
strophically demolished, if the measurer, for instance, tries to intrude in a
measurement in progress (Duarte 2002, 2014).
6. It is the implicit freedom of thought, or ‘free will’, of the experimentalist that
leads to innovations, inventions, and discoveries.

This observation lends support to Feynman’s assertion that interference ‘has in it

sentence in his lectures even though he was perfectly aware of the physics of
quantum entanglement. Furthermore, as outlined in chapter 22

other words this probability amplitude inherently includes time and space. At this
stage we have to think that the Dirac–Feynman principle describes how Nature
works at its most fundamental level.

be used to derive the probability amplitudes of quantum entanglement independ-

are also of fundamental stature. Feynman said ‘no one has been able to deﬁne the
difference between interference and diffraction satisfactorily’ (Feynman et al 1963).
Well… it is all in equation (29.42). In 1993 it was shown that diffraction via a single
wide slit (3 mm wide) can be beautifully represented by subdividing the 3 mm slit into

In other words, no new information is gained going from

interferometric array of

600. Or from a slit width of Δ
=

5 μm to a narrower

2.5 μm. Albeit there are no limitations, in principle, on the ﬁnesse
of the calculations Nature appears to be very efﬁcient and there is indeed an
optimum ﬁnesse determining the smallness necessary to gain a full and complete
representation of the interferometric reality. Beyond the necessary smallness no
further measurement information is gained. For the case at hand the optimum
ﬁnesse appears to be reached at

Going back to Feynman’s comment: ‘no one has been able to deﬁne the difference
between interference and diffraction satisfactorily’ (Feynman et al 1963), it is all in
equation (29.42): this is essentially an interferometric equation. Interference rules!
For as long as the situation remains a zeroth order phenomenon it is pure
interference. Once higher orders begin to appear, such as ±
±
±
1,
2,
3,..., then it is
‘convention’ to use the term diffraction (Duarte 2003). But the physics is all
interference.
29.7.2 Further reﬁnements
As mentioned in the previous section the Dirac–Feynman superposition interfero-
metric principle applies to extraordinarily small dimensions. For instance, a nano-
scopic N-slit interferometer for gamma-ray quanta (γ) can be readily designed and its
performance predicted via the interferometric probability equation (29.42). As an
example, for this interferometer the transmission grating can have
=

spaced slits each of which is Δ

10 13 m wide. That is, the overall width of

The calculated interferogram displays over a distance, perpendicular to the
propagation axis, of ~0.5 nm and is shown in ﬁgure 29.9.
Another possible reﬁnement, in interferometric calculations, consists in represent-
ing each slit in the series

human attempts to reﬁne calculations beyond the optimum ﬁnesse allowed by
Nature.
Note: it should be mentioned that treatment of the N-slit conﬁguration, from a
completely independent quantum ﬂuctuations perspective, yield results compatible
with those obtained via equation (29.42) (Madrid et al 2020).
29.8 Discussion
Quantum mechanics, from an interferometric perspective, is based on a series
transparent mathematical principles. Central to the correct prediction of measure-
ment outcomes is the correct description of the experimental conﬁgurations via
superposition probability amplitudes. Once the probability amplitude has been
derived, application of Born’s rule 〈∣〉〈∣〉

On the interpretation of quantum mechanics
A pragmatic perspective on the interpretation of quantum mechanics, unbound by
pre-existing philosophical prejudices, is advocated following the approach and
attitude to this subject of luminaries such as Born, Dirac, Feynman, Dyson,
Lamb, and Ward. The crucial importance of the Dirac–Feynman superposition
probability amplitude is emphasized while the suggestion of this being a quantum
world, as hinted by Lamb, is adopted.
30.1 Introduction
Much has been written on the interpretation of quantum mechanics. In addition to
the original orthodox interpretation known as the Copenhagen interpretation,
outlined mainly by Bohr and Heisenberg, there exist a plethora of additional
interpretations. A perspective on the Copenhagen interpretation is given by Bohr
(1935) using the principle of complementarity, which rests on Heisenberg’s uncer-
tainty principle, while responding to the arguments of Einstein et al (1935). In this
regard, it is useful to quote from another of the quantum originals: ‘the laws of
quantum mechanics were found by the slow and tedious process of interpreting
experimental results’ (Born 1949).
It is certainly not the intention of this monograph to provide an overview of this
vast subject matter, and the numerous interpretations available, except to exhibit the
very basic principles that make quantum mechanics work and serve as a highly
practical theoretical framework, particularly in the areas of quantum interferometry
and quantum entanglement. In this regard, it is certainly relevant to quote from one of
Dirac’s last papers: ‘The interpretation of quantum mechanics has been dealt with by
many authors, and I do not want to discuss it here. I want to deal with more
fundamental things…’ and he added towards the end of the same paper: ‘The
foundations of the quantum mechanics of Heisenberg, which are very sound and
beautiful, should not be changed’ (Dirac 1987). This line of thought reinforces Born’s
statement: ‘I think that its indeterministic foundations will be permanent’ (Born 1949).

It is also relevant to recall Ward’s observation: ‘ ∣
〉−∣
〉
x y
y x
(
,
,
) … was my ﬁrst
lesson in quantum mechanics, and in a very real sense my last, since all the rest is
mere technique, which can be learnt from books’ (Ward 2004).
In all fairness it should be mentioned that physicists such as Dirac and Ward are
two of those physicist that, according to Bell, had quantum mechanics ‘in their
bones’ and that in regard to the issue of interpretations would respond: ‘Why
bother?’ (Bell 1990).
The argument on the ‘incompleteness’ of quantum mechanics put forward by
Einstein et al (1935) initiated the philosophical path towards quantum entanglement
and had the unintended consequence of ultimately bringing about Bell’s theorem
(Bell 1964), that reinforced the incompatibility of ‘local hidden variable theories’
with quantum mechanics and that today is widely applied as a tool to verify the
integrity of quantum cryptography communications.
However, as explained in chapter 3, the EPR argument of ‘incompleteness of
quantum mechanics’ can be neutralized via the measurement reality of
± Δ
p
p and
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (Duarte 2014). Knowing that there is a physical,
non-philosophical, path towards quantum entanglement, this observation might
explain why Willis Lamb classiﬁed the EPR paradox as a ‘misunderstanding’ and
Bell’s theorem, or Bell’s inequalities, as ‘unnecessary’ (Lamb 2001).
30.2 Philosophical aspects of quantum entanglement
In this sections relevant opinions of EPR and Schrödinger that led to the hidden
variable theories of Bohm, and ultimately to Bell’s theorem, are examined.
Background material on this discussion is provided in chapters 3, 4, 9, 10, and 13.
30.2.1 The perspectives of EPR and Schrödinger on quantum entanglement
It was EPR (Einstein et al 1935) who inspired Schrödinger (1935, 1936) to write his
two papers on quantum entanglement. In this regard, EPR argued that ‘making
predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another
system’ was a ‘problem’ (Einstein et al 1935).
In his ﬁrst paper on quantum entanglement Schrödinger (1935) wrote: ‘after
reestablishing one ψ-function… the other one can be inferred simultaneously’ and
followed up with: ‘It is rather discomforting that the theory should allow a system to
be steered or piloted into one or the other type of state at the experimenter’s mercy in
spite of his having no access to it’ (Schrödinger 1935).
The ﬁrst part of his analysis is correct, since following a polarization measure-
ment on photon 1 the experimenter can infer the polarization state of photon 2.
However, this is strictly an statistical outcome since prior to the measurement the
experimenter has no information or control on the polarization state of photon 1.
The second part of Schrödinger’s argument as to ‘steering or piloting’ the polar-
ization state of photon 2 is exaggerated since the photon 1 experimenter can only
measure according to the quantum probability

30.2.2 Hidden variable theories
Hidden variable theories began to surface apparently, in a shadowy unspeciﬁed
form, in the late 1920s or early 1930s. This is known with a fair degree of certainty
because John von Neumann does refer to them explicitly in his book: ‘the hidden
parameter… has been proposed more than once’ (von Neumann 1932). These
hidden variable theories assume ‘dispersion free states’ (von Neumann 1932, Bell
and Nauenberg 1966). In this regard, von Neumann is adamant: ‘dispersion free
ensembles, which would have to correspond to actual states… do not exist’ (von
Neumann 1932). In fact, from a pragmatic perspective it can be observed that the
concept of ‘dispersion free states’ is incompatible with Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle. Nevertheless, the interest on ‘dispersion free states’ resurfaced with
renewed vigor in the 1950s (Bohm 1952a, 1952b, Bohm and Bub 1966).
At this stage it should be made clear that hidden variable theories—‘hidden
because… we can only conjecture their existence and certainly cannot control them’
(Bell 1971)—have not led to any practical physics and their only application appears
to have been their questionable use as a platform to project doubts towards
legitimate quantum entanglement experiments utilizing positron–electron annihila-
tion sources (
γγ
→

e e
1 2), that is, the experiments of Bleuler and Bradt (1948),
Hanna (1948), and Wu and Shaknov (1950). Here, it is relevant to mention that
Feynman dismisses the concept of ‘inner variables’, using the sentence ‘this is the
way nature really is’ while discussing quantum interference (Feynman et al 1965).
Lamb (2001) also catalogued hidden variable theories as ‘unnecessary’.
As discussed by Duarte and Taylor (2021) at least two hidden variable theories
(HVTs) have been proposed: those of Bohm (1952a, 1952b) and Bohm and Bub
(1966). The HVT introduced by Bohm (1952a) concludes that ‘the probability
density of particles will cease to be equal to∣Ψ
∣
x
( ) 2’ (Bohm 1952a). It also introduces
the concept of precise measurements of position and momentum, thus violating
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (Bohm 1952b). The second HTV introduces an
irreversible set of equations (Bohm and Bub 1966). Since Born’s rule (Born 1926)

is a crucial principle of quantum mechanics, then it can be concluded that a theory
that does not observe Born’s rule is not a quantum mechanical theory. The same can be
said about a theory that allows the violation of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.
Thus, it is logical to conclude that the HVT introduced by Bohm (1952a, 1952b) is
not a quantum mechanical theory. The same conclusion applies the HVT of Bohm
and Bub (1966) since reversibility is a key feature in the ﬂow of quantum mechanical
equations (von Neumann 1932, Duarte 2019).
As pointed out by Duarte and Taylor (2021) it should have been recognized, as
early as 1952, that the hidden variable theories proposed by Bohm and Bub are not
quantum mechanical theories. However, the non-quantum nature of those hidden
variable theories was not mentioned by Bell when he published his paper (Bell 1964).

In 2006 a two-slit experiment using silicon droplets, rather than quanta, was
found to produce interference patterns. The authors interpreted this result as lending
support to the 1952 Bohm’s HVT (Couder and Fort 2006). A follow up double-slit
experiment also using droplets did not ﬁnd evidence of interference thus casting
‘strong doubt’ on the Couder and Fort experiment and its interpretation (Andersen
et al 2015).
Relevant to this argument is also the statement: ‘the two photons are entangled
and according to local realism, their polarizations planes should become independ-
ent… a typical EPR situation. Already in 1948, observations agreed with quantum
mechanics… not with local realism’ (Dalitz and Duarte 2000).
30.3 Quantum critical
Criticism is good and it should be welcomed, in particular when it is formulated with
the intention of improving the subject matter at the center of the criticism. Here, two
papers critical of quantum mechanics are considered while focusing on some speciﬁc
issues raised in these papers.
In 1990, a cleverly written essay sharply critical of quantum mechanics, and its
orthodox interpretation, was published by none other than J S Bell. The article was
titled ‘Against “measurement”’ (Bell 1990). In it, Bell criticized Dirac for having a
‘why bother’ attitude towards the possibility of an ‘exact’ formulation of the theory.
This was not Bell’s only critical piece on quantum mechanics. Previously Bell had
co-authored an article titled ‘The moral aspects of quantum mechanics’, in which he
concluded that the theory is ‘at best, incomplete’ and that ‘it carries in itself the seeds
of its own destruction’ (Bell and Nauenberg 1966).
Criticisms of quantum mechanics were nothing new at the time of Bell’s writings,
indeed as described in chapter 3, the notion of quantum mechanics as an incomplete
theory was advanced early on by EPR (Einstein et al 1935) and these criticisms were
almost immediately seconded by Schrödinger (1935, 1936) in the context of
quantum entanglement. These were the criticism that eventually might have given
origin to the hidden variable theories of Bohm (1952a, 1952b) and Bohm and Bub
(1966), albeit von Neumann had already written in 1932: ‘the hidden parameter …
has been proposed more than once’ (von Neumann 1932).
The genius of Bell is that he brought a whole new level of expressional cleverness
to the criticisms of quantum mechanics. Bell’s eloquence and subtlety were clearly
highlighted in a reply to his ‘Against “measurement”’ essay by one of his
contemporaries (Gottfried 1991).
30.3.1 On ‘The moral aspects of quantum mechanics’
This co-authored Bell paper is a seven and a half page long publication. It deals with
the notion of morality in quantum mechanics as related to ‘the reduction of the wave
packet’ (Bell and Nauenberg 1966).
This particular subsection, although it includes the word ‘moral’ in its title, does
not deal at all with issues of morality. It only focuses on one aspect of Bell’s paper
and on its ﬁnal conclusion, that quantum mechanics ‘carries the seeds of its own
Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement (Second Edition)
30-4

destruction’. The aspect of this Bell paper that is worthy of attention appears in its
sixth page and deals with the double-slit, or Young’s, interferometric experiment.
Here Bell invokes the ‘de Broglie–Bohm pilot wave’ or ‘hidden parameter’
interpretation of quantum mechanics (Bell and Nauenberg 1966). Bell’s interpreta-
tion of the two-slit experiment is not only unnecessary but it is at odds with the lucid-
transparent description given by Dirac, ‘each photon goes partly into each of the two
components’ (Dirac 1958), and with the nonlocal nature of the photon. An
additional description of the two-slit experiment, as extended to an N-slit interfer-
ometer, explains that: ‘all the indistinguishable photons illuminate the array of N
slits, or grating, simultaneously. If only one photon propagates at any given time,
then that individual photon illuminates the whole array of N slits simultaneously’
(Duarte 2003). As a relevant footnote it should be added that recent experimental
evidence points against the ‘pilot wave’ interpretation (Andersen et al 2015).
Towards the end of the sixth page Bell and Nauenberg (1966) arrive at the
opinion that quantum mechanics is at ‘best incomplete’. As indicated by Duarte
(2014), see also chapter 3, the initial claim of incompleteness originated with EPR
(Einstein et al 1935) and this claim can be classiﬁed as incompatible with

measurements and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (Heisenberg 1927)
Δ Δ
≈

h.
(30.3)
However, Bell’s opinion appears to be based on his own thoughts and premises.
One of those thoughts is his understanding of the double-slit experiment via the
‘pilot wave interpretation’. However, as discussed previously, this interpretation can
be classiﬁed as either unnecessary or erroneous. In conclusion, from a pragmatic
perspective, it appears that quantum mechanics does not carry ‘the seeds of its own
destruction’.
30.3.2 On ‘Against measurement’
This solo Bell paper is also a seven and a half page long publication. It presents a
strong criticism of the use of the word measurement in quantum mechanics (Bell
1990).
Cleverly written, it was Bell’s last paper. Again, the purpose of this subsection is
not to criticize the whole essay but to focus on a couple of interesting aspects. In the
second page of this essay Bell suggests that it would be good to replace the word
measurement by the word experiment (our italics). Then he goes on ‘A serious
formulation will not exclude the big world outside the laboratory’ (Bell 1990). In this
regard, it should be indicated that experiments with very large N-slit interferometers,
utilizing ensembles of indistinguishable photons and measurement predictions based
on Diracian probability amplitudes have taken place within the laboratory at an
intra-interferometric distance of

m (Duarte et al 2010, 2011). Also, space-to-Earth quantum entangle-
ment experiments, utilizing the quantum entanglement probability amplitudes, have
been reported over a propagation distance of 1200 km (Yin et al 2017).
Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement (Second Edition)
30-5

On the third page Bell considers the book of Landau and Lifshitz (1977). Albeit of
a more marginal relevance, this criticism is nevertheless included here since it
illustrates Bell’s critical ﬁnesse. Bell criticized Landau and Lifshitz for the statement
‘It is in principle impossible… to formulate the basic concepts of quantum
mechanics without using classical mechanics’ (Landau and Lifshitz 1977). Given
the use of the word ‘impossible’, this is debatable. On the one hand, as discussed in
chapter 1, quantum mechanics most basic equation
ν
=
E
h
originated from an
entirely classical macroscopic experiment. On the other hand, as illustrated in
chapter 17, the probability amplitude for quantum entanglement is derived entirely
from quantum interferometric concepts.
According to Bell, the problem with the Landau and Lifshitz’s formulation of
quantum mechanics was its ambiguity in regard to ‘what is microscopic, what is
macroscopic, what [is] quantum, what [is] classical’ (Bell 1990). Here it should be
indicated that from the perspectives of Lamb and van Kampen, quantum mechanics
does apply to large scale phenomena (see section 30.7). Also, Feynman and Hibbs
(1965) applied quantum path integrals to the description of macroscopic diffraction
and Duarte (1997, 2003) derived the physics of diffraction, refraction, and reﬂection
from quantum interferometric principles. In this regard, it could be argued that
Landau and Lifshitz’s ambiguity is not a detrimental issue and it highlights the
applicability of quantum mechanics both in the micro and macro domains.
30.3.3 On Bell’s criticisms of quantum mechanics
At this stage it should be mentioned that all of Bell’s criticisms of quantum
mechanics (Bell 1990, Bell and Nauenberg 1966) were of a philosophical nature.
At no stage did Bell point towards an equation of quantum mechanics in conﬂict
with experimental evidence. Nor did Bell introduce his own physics that would
overcome his own criticisms. Bell’s efforts to postulate an ‘improved’ quantum
mechanics were largely limited to describing and explaining methods based on
hidden variables and the ‘pilot wave’ approach (Bell 1987).
30.4 Conceptual ‘problems’ in quantum mechanics
Perhaps following Bell, contemporaneous critics of quantum mechanics always
return to ‘the measurement problem’ to argue that quantum mechanics needs to be
replaced by a better theory. In this section it is indicated that the so called
‘measurement problem’ in quantum mechanics is a conceptual problem, of those
who think there is a problem, and certainly not a tangible practical problem.
Furthermore, the particle–wave duality is discussed from an interferometric per-
spective involving indistinguishable quanta.
30.4.1 The ‘measurement problem’
Contemporaneous criticisms of quantum mechanics fail to mention that, in praxis,
there is no measurement problem in quantum mechanics. ‘Quantum mechanics
works’ says van Kampen (1988) in his ﬁrst theorem. Indeed, quantum mechanics

accurately (Duarte 1993, 2014). In other areas of quantum mechanics the agreement
between theory and experiment is quite remarkable. Take, for instance, the electron
magnetic moment measured to be
=
g
( /2)
1.00115965218073 in Bohr magnetons
(Hanneke et al 2008) and predicted to be
=
g
( /2)
1.0011596 (Petermann 1956). Here
it should be noted that Petermann’s 1956 prediction includes only two Feynman
diagrams. The agreement goes much higher today using large numbers of Feynman
diagrams in computerized calculations. The point is that an agreement to the
seventh decimal place between theory and experiment is not indicative of a
‘measurement problem’, in particular for a theory based on ‘indeterminacy’.
Conceptual criticisms of quantum mechanics often link the measurement problem
to ‘the collapse of the wave function’ (Albert and Vaidman 1989, Namiki and
Pascazio 1992, Penrose 1996). However, as indicated by Duarte and Taylor (2021)
the collapse of the wave function is absent from the discussion of quantum
superposition in Dirac’s book (Dirac 1958) and in Feynman’s lectures. Feynman
dedicates two sections in his lectures to wave functions but neither section refers to
nor discusses ‘the collapse of the wave function’ (Feynman et al 1965).
In our framework, using N-slit interferometry as a vehicle, the concept of the
collapse of the wave function would have to be described in terms of a sudden

A signiﬁcant problem with this way of thinking is that it opens the door to the
concept of a ‘localized’ single photon which is incompatible with the quantum
principle of the non-localized photon. The nonlocality of the photon is beautifully
corroborated by the
ν

c version of the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
and reafﬁrmed experimentally by linewidth measurements using Mach–Zehnder
interferometers (Duarte 2003, 2014).

measurements can be neatly described in the absence of this collapse directly via

In summary: quantum measurements, in the interferometric and polarization
domains, can be described without resorting to the concept of the collapse of the
wave function or the collapse of the probability amplitude. These measurements can

Interferometric quantum measurements and quantum entanglement measure-
ments are described in chapter 29.
30.4.2 Particle–wave duality
Adherence to the concept of the photon as an extremely nonlocal quantum entity
described by
ν
Δ Δ
≈
x
c makes discussions of wave–particle duality unnecessary.
The nonlocality of the photon applies to interferometry, quantum entanglement,
and any other experimental discipline utilizing quanta either as single photons or as
ensembles of indistinguishable photons.
As far as quantum entanglement is concerned: ‘the two photons are entangled and
according to local realism, their polarizations planes should become independent…
a typical EPR situation. Already in 1948, observations agreed with quantum
mechanics… not with local realism’ (Dalitz and Duarte 2000).
These concepts apply to quanta and quanta propagation and they might not
necessarily extend to other quantum entities such as the electron where wave–
particle duality should manifest itself.
30.4.3 Quantum reality
Reality is deﬁned by measurements. Reality is set by quantum probabilities such as

. Reality emerges from the measurables such as
probability, intensity, and polarization.
Of course those who maintain that there is a ‘measurement problem’ also imply that
quantum mechanics does no provide an adequate description of reality. In this section the
‘measurement problem’ has already been dismantled. As far as reality is concerned:
‘Already in 1948, observations agreed with quantum mechanics… not with local realism’
(Dalitz and Duarte 2000). In this regard, it is clear that reality at the nano level, and below,
differs from the macro reality humans are mostly familiar with. This statement is perfectly
ﬁne since it is based on the nonlocality of the photon which in itself is an experimental reality.
30.4.4 Unnecessary concerns
Contemporary emphasis on hidden variable theories appears to continue. This effort
has been reframed under new titles such as ‘superdeterminism’. In this regard, it is the
‘measurement problem’ and the premises of Bell’s theorem, particularly that of ‘free
will’, that appear to provide the fuel (Hossenfelder and Palmer 2020). The ‘measurement
problem’ has already been dealt with in subsection 30.4.1. As far as Bell’s theorem is
concerned, it is quite clear, see chapters 17–19, that Bell’s theorem is irrelevant to the
physics of quantum entanglement (Duarte 2019, Duarte and Taylor 2021) . Therefore,
issues concerning the derivation of Bell’s theorem have zero effect on the physics of
quantum entanglement. The main impact of Bell’s theorem is from a philosophical–
historical perspective: it reinforces, outside the physics of quantum entanglement, the
incompatibility of hidden variable theories with quantum mechanics.
The freedom of thought and action allowed to the measurer, or experimentalist,
and described in chapter 29, is not a premise in the physics leading to the derivation
of ψ

30-8

The principles of quantum mechanics, and the interferometric perspective of
quantum mechanics, are silent on predetermined philosophical issues. This is
consistent with the opinions expressed by Feynman in his book The Meaning of it
All (Feynman 1998).
However, this perspective should not preclude the emergence of new natural
philosophies based on quantum principles. At its most basic level this is a quantum
world and quantum mechanics is based on indeterminism. In this regard, Born’s
statement ‘I think that its indeterministic foundations will be permanent’ (Born
1949) neutralize conceptual concerns based on non-existing experimental data.
30.5 Quantum luminaries
As discussed in detail by Duarte and Taylor (2021), quantum luminaries that
provide elements for the foundations towards a pragmatic perspective on quantum
mechanics include Max Born, Paul Dirac, Freeman Dyson, Richard Feynman,
Willis Lamb, and John Ward.
30.6 The pragmatic perspective
A pragmatic perspective on quantum mechanics means a perspective based on
experimental facts observed in Nature. The measurement reigns supreme. The measure-
ment deﬁnes reality. Pre-established philosophical views have no place in this approach.
From a pragmatic perspective, which is the perspective of this monograph, the
following observations are relevant:
1. A theory should be criticized if it fails to reproduce experimental results. This
is not the case with quantum mechanics.
2. A theory should be criticized if it fails to predict experimental results. This is
not the case with quantum mechanics.
3. A theory should be criticized if it fails to predict measurable phenomena.
This is not the case with quantum mechanics.
4. A theory should even be criticized if it leads to ugly and messy equations.
This is not the case with quantum mechanics, at least not in the cases of
quantum interferometry and quantum entanglement.
With the advantage of elapsed time it can now be said that quantum mechanics
beautifully fulﬁls the deﬁnition of a correct theory as outlined by Einstein himself:
‘The correctness of the theory is judged by the degree of agreement between the
conclusions of the theory and human experience. This experience… in physics takes
the form of experiment and measurement’ (Einstein et al 1935).
30.7 The Dirac–Feynman–Lamb doctrine
There is a portion of the quantum optics community that considers only single photon
events to be quantum events. This is a very limited, and myopic, perspective that ignores
epic historical developments in quantum physics. First of all, it was an experimental
event in the very macroscopic domain that led Planck to discover the quantum energy
equation
ν
=
E
h
(Planck 1901) that indeed was the discovery of quantum mechanics.

Second, it was Dirac’s discussion on macroscopic two-beam interference, in
reference to beams of populations of indistinguishable photons, that led Dirac to his
famous dictum ‘Each photon then interferes only with itself. Interference between
two different photons never occurs’ (Dirac 1958). A dictum that even today leads
some into confusion. Note that Dirac’s dictum does not exclude interference
between two distinct laser sources as long as the emission from these lasers is
indistinguishable, that is ν

2. Third, Feynman selected macroscopic
beam divergence to illustrate the application of his quantum path integrals
(Feynman and Hibbs 1965). This recitation of quantum facts should be integrated
to van Kampen’s second theorem on quantum measurements: ‘Quantum mechanics
is concerned with macroscopic phenomena which are not perturbed by observations’
(van Kampen 1988) even though the words applicable to rather than concerned with
would give this theorem a more universal usage.
Finally, the doctrine being introduced here is not complete without the wisdom of
the great Willis Lamb. This ‘rare theorist turned experimentalist’ (Kaiser 2005)
stated categorically: ‘in principle we could apply quantum descriptions to large scale
phenomena, but, in general, we can’t because we are unwilling or unable to adhere
to the rules of the game… it is high time that we realize that this is inevitable and
learn to enjoy it’ (Lamb 1987).
The quantum mechanical description of interference applies equally well to
situations involving either single photons or populations of indistinguishable photons
(Duarte 1993). In other words, the quantum mechanical description of N-slit
interference for either single-photon propagation or the propagation of indistin-
guishable quanta, à la Dirac, is indeed quantum mechanics, and paraphrasing Lamb,
it is time we ‘learn to enjoy it’. The concepts introduced by Dirac, Feynman, and
Lamb, which are integrated here as the Dirac–Feynman–Lamb (DFL) doctrine,
provide the inspiration to apply quantum mechanics to physical processes involving
the interaction of ensembles of indistinguishable photons with macroscopic appa-
rata. In this regard, the realm of laser interference is particularly apt to the
application of quantum physics (Duarte 1993, 1997, 2003). The DFL doctrine
strongly hints that ours is a quantum world and encourages the search for new
applications of quantum mechanics.
30.8 The all-important probability amplitude
The concept of the probability amplitude is utterly crucial in quantum mechanics. In this
regard, it is the probability amplitude that must faithfully express the physics at hand.
Albeit this concept has already been treated in chapters 2 and 29 of this monograph, it is
considered once again whilst observing that repetitio est mater studiorum.
For single-photon propagation, and the propagation of ensembles of indistin-
guishable photons, an N-slit interferometer is faithfully described by the Dirac–
Feynman superposition probability amplitude

〈∣〉=

(Duarte 1993). If an extra transmission plane k is introduced, between the N-slit array
j and the interferometric plane d, then the probability amplitude immediately becomes

If that extra plane is reduced to a single microscopic, and transparent, ﬁber f then the
probability amplitude is reduced to

The point here is that any attempt to observe, or to gauge, the original interferogram
represented in equation (30.7) immediately results in an entirely new probability
amplitude thus irrevocably altering the original probability amplitude and hence the
measured interferogram.
In order to transition from a purely mathematical probability amplitude to a
probability then 〈∣〉
d s must be multiplied with is complex conjugate 〈∣〉⁎

to Born’s rule (Born 1926), that is

In this regard, it should be emphasized that equations (30.10)–(30.12) are completely
equivalent. Furthermore, equation (30.10) is utterly quantum and has no equivalent
whatsoever in classical optics.
Equations (30.10)–(30.12) accurately describe N-slit interference for single-photon
propagation and the propagation of ensembles of indistinguishable photons. Here the
single photon, or the population of indistinguishable photons, refer to a single-frequency
ν, or single-wavelength λ, that in practice can be obtained from a very narrow-linewidth,
or a highly-monochromatic, laser. That is, lasers exhibiting a very narrow

For semi-coherent radiation, it is this probability distribution that determines the
measured intensity distribution, as outlined in chapter 2 (Duarte 2004). In this
regard, the spatial detector (either a photographic plate, CCD array, or CMOS
spatial detector), records an interferometric distribution corresponding to each
wavelength in the λ

array and provides a cumulative intensity distribu-
tion. Ample examples of excellent agreement between these equations and measured
interferograms, for N in the

N
2
2000 range and for numerous propagation
distances, from the near to the far ﬁeld, are available in the literature (Duarte 1993,
2015, 2016).
The message here is that quantum mechanics not only beautifully, efﬁciently, and
accurately, describes macroscopic interference phenomena but, beyond this feature,
the same physics describes single-photon interference that is completely beyond the
scope of classical descriptions of interference. This is one transparent example of the
DFL doctrine at work. The differences between classical and quantum interference
are explained in appendix B.
As discussed by Duarte and Taylor (2021) superposition probability amplitudes such
as 〈∣〉
d s
are the ‘mathematical tools of Nature’ that describe the physics. Quantum
superposition probabilities, such as 〈∣〉〈∣〉
⁎
d s d s
and ψ ψ
∣〉∣〉
⁎, provide the measurables.
The mathematical transition between
ψ
∣〉and
ψ ψ
∣〉∣〉
⁎, that is, the →in
ψ
ψ ψ
∣〉→∣〉∣〉
⁎, is a mathematical step at the boundary between the complex
mathematical realm and the measurables realm. This mathematical transition is
perfectly in line with the classical mathematical rules of complex numbers. That is,
ψ ψ
∣〉∣〉
⁎ is the square of the absolute value of ψ
∣〉, or
ψ
∣∣〉∣2. The multiplication of
complex numbers with their respective conjugates probably goes back to Euler’s
time, circa 1748 (Euler 1748). There is no mystery here: the multiplication of
complex quantities with their respective complex conjugates is a routine exercise in
standard electromagnetic theory (Lorrain and Corson 1970, Born and Wolf 1975),
wave physics (Crawford 1968), and circuit theory (Feynman et al 1964, Smith 1973).
Furthermore, as every one knows, complex numbers are widely applied in
mathematical ﬁelds including calculus (Flanders et al 1970), vector calculus
(Williamson et al 1972), Fourier theory (Churchill 1963), differential equations
(Boyce and DiPrima 1969), and partial differential equations (Weinberger 1965).
Feynman referred to the beautiful

as ‘our jewel’ (Feynman et al 1963). Physics is about the mathematical description
and prediction of Nature. Imaginary and complex numbers are crucial for a complete
and efﬁcient description of Nature. More on complex numbers in appendix I.

Beyond this pragmatic perspective it should be added that equation (30.10) has
been applied to accurately predict single-slit diffraction (Duarte 1993, 2015) and to
describe interference →diffraction →refraction →reﬂection (in that particular
hierarchy and order) in a uniﬁed, succinct, and rational approach (Duarte 1997,
2015). That is, interference →diffraction →refraction →reﬂection, in a few
mathematical statements, from the Dirac–Feynman interferometric probability!
Certainly, once refraction is accounted for then generalized dispersion follows
(Duarte 1985, 2019). For details see appendix H.
30.9 The quantumness derived from the nonlocality of the photon
The nonlocality of the photon is the all-important non-classical physics principle
that allows quantum interference and quantum entanglement. Indeed the Dirac–
Feynman superposition probability amplitude
∑
〈∣〉=
〈∣〉〈∣〉

depends on a single photon illuminating a whole array of N slits.

depends on photon 1 interacting with photon 2 even though they might be separated
by a great distance. This nonlocality of the photon is completely consistent with
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle Δ Δ
≈
p x
h.
It can be said that all the intrinsic non-classical properties of quantum mechanics
can be traced back to the nonlocality, or omnipresence, of the photon: ‘the two
photons are entangled and according to local realism, their polarizations planes
should become independent… a typical EPR situation. Already in 1948, observa-
tions agreed with quantum mechanics… not with local realism’ (Dalitz and Duarte
2000) . In this regard, it should be noted that in 1947 there was already a strong hint,
on the nonlocality of the photon, issued by Dirac when he associated his probability
amplitudes with ‘the wave functions of ordinary wave optics’ (Dirac 1958).
30.10 The best interpretation of quantum mechanics
Writings on the interpretation of quantum mechanics are rich in philosophical
terms, sophisticated words, and uncommon words. In this regard, it should not be
forgotten that quantum mechanics was born from the depths of the macroscopic
experimental observations of Planck. Observations that led to
ν
=
E
h . It should also
be remembered that Born emphasized the importance of experimental measure-
ments in the ‘tedious’ crafting of the laws of quantum mechanics. Also relevant are
the words of Dirac: ‘I owe a lot to my engineering training because it did teach me to
tolerate approximations’ (Dalitz 1987). This Dirac acknowledgement should be
added to Feynman’s observation: ‘already in classical mechanics there was inde-
terminability’ (Feynman et al 1965). This indeterminacy can be traced all the way
Fundamentals of Quantum Entanglement (Second Edition)
30-13

back to Newton’s Principia, where experimental errors are neatly listed in measure-
ment tables (Newton 1686)†.
After contemplating the concepts expressed above and Feynman’s thought ‘this is
the way Nature really is’ (Feynman et al 1965), it eventually becomes transparent
that the ‘least action’ approach to interpretational matters, in addition to the laws
and principles given in chapter 29, is a pragmatic posture devoid of philosophical
prejudices. Better still, it can be argued that the most efﬁcient and practical
interpretation of quantum mechanics is… no interpretation at all (Duarte 2014).

The transition between these two probability amplitudes is quite natural and does
not require any mysterious steps or strange concepts. More speciﬁcally, it does not
invoke any hidden theories. Hence, it can be stated that, from an interferometric
perspective, there are no mysteries… and no paradoxes… in the physics of quantum
entanglement. At its most basic level‡ ours is a quantum world and quantum
mechanics is based on indeterminism, on uncertainty, on superposition, on non-
locality. It has been shown that quantum physics can give origin to deterministic
classical optics principles (Duarte 1997). In this regard, it should be emphasized that
interference, diffraction, refraction, and reﬂection in the classical domain are ‘more
deterministic’ (as compared to their quantum counterparts) rather than ‘strictly
deterministic’ since they are still subject to measurement uncertainties.
The perspectives expressed in this chapter are entirely consistent with a Nature-
based pragmatic approach, free of pre-established philosophical prejudices, to the
interpretation of quantum mechanics and even with the more minimalist principle of
no interpretation at all.
Corollary:
There are two classes of theories: transitional theories and limited theories. There are
no ﬁnal theories. The concept of a ‘ﬁnal theory’ is unscientiﬁc. Newtonian mechanics
is an example of a beautiful highly-practical limited theory. Quantum mechanics
might be transitional and will eventually lead to a super quantum mechanics. And
yet, as hinted by Born, it might still remain indeterministic.
†The indeterminacy in classical physics can be illustrated by considering Newton’s second law F = ma. In practice
this is not an ‘exact equation’ since the measured force F ± ΔF depends on the mass and its uncertainty (m ± Δm)
and on the acceleration and its uncertainty (a ± Δa) . However, it is customary to simply write F = ma.

Appendix A
Revisiting the Pryce–Ward probability
amplitude for quantum entanglement
The
work
of
Pryce
and
Ward
leading
to
the
probability
amplitude,
ψ
∣〉= ∣〉∣〉−∣〉∣〉
x y
y x
(
), is examined from a historical perspective. Ward’s parallel
interests, at the time, in quantum electrodynamics, are presented.
A.1 Introduction
Some readers may wonder why neither Maurice Pryce nor John Ward published a
separate dedicated journal paper on the probability amplitude for quantum
entanglement, ψ
∣〉= ∣
〉−∣
〉
x y
y x
(
,
,
), thus leaving Ward’s doctoral thesis as the
only explicit contemporaneous record of this development. Concurrently, some
readers may also wonder why they never championed, or exploited, the ownership of
this most crucial equation, as most physicists would do today confronted by similar
circumstances. These are questions that apparently were never asked of John Ward
and one aspect of his physics that he never discussed, at least not in the written
record. In this appendix, an attempt is made to ﬁnd an explanation for this apparent
ineffable set of affairs. This discussion is based on measured speculation, personal
knowledge of the man, and the published record.
A.2 Exciting times and extreme succinctness
According to John Ward, he was introduced to ψ
∣〉= ∣
〉−∣
〉
x y
y x
(
,
,
) via discus-
sions with Maurice Pryce (Ward 2004). These discussions were generated by interest
in the perpendicularity of the polarization states of two quanta moving in opposite
directions as presented in Dirac’s pair theory (Dirac 1930). At the time John Ward
was working on his doctorate under the supervision of Maurice Pryce at Oxford
(Pryce and Ward 1947).
However, this was not the only focus of Ward’s attention at the time. As his
doctoral thesis already hinted at in its title, ‘Some properties of the elementary
particles’ (Ward 1949), he was also already attracted to particle physics and to

quantum electrodynamics in particular. Perhaps the only other human thinking
about quantum optics at the time was Dirac himself.
An additional preamble forces a departure from physics to introduce some
aspects of John Ward’s personality that might be relevant: he was a master of
succinctness and always got to the point in the most direct possible way. It is as if he
were a living demonstration of the principle of least action. He was a fairly distant
man with few close friends, physicist Richard Dalitz among them. By today’s
standards he was honest in the extreme, modest, and hated corruption and the
practitioners of corruption. The reader can ﬁnd further details on Ward in his
autobiography (Ward 2004) and in writings about him (Fraser 2008, Close 2011,
Dombey 2021).
The following facts reinforce and add to the concepts already expressed:
1. His paper with Maurice Pryce titled ‘Angular correlation effects with
annihilation radiation’ (Pryce and Ward 1947) is slightly longer than half
a page. Ward says that Pryce initially refused being a co-author and that he
only accepted upon Ward’s insistence (Ward 2004).
2. His doctoral thesis ‘Some properties of the elementary particles’ (Ward 1949)
was a mere 47 pages long and dealt with two subjects. The ﬁrst section was
titled ‘Polarization effects of annihilation radiation’ and the second section
was titled ‘Some higher order effects in covariant quantum electrodynamics’.
3. His landmark paper on renormalization theory titled ‘An identity in
quantum electrodynamics’ (Ward 1950a) was less than half a page long.
The importance of this paper to quantum ﬁeld theory can be summarized via
the statements of experienced practitioners in the ﬁeld: ‘the Ward identity…
ensures the universality of the electromagnetic interaction’ (Greiner and
Reinhardt 2009) and ‘The proof that QED can be renormalized relied on
Ward’s Identities… Ward’s Identities lie at the very foundations of renorm-
alization theory’ (Close 2011).
4. Another of his papers on renormalization theory titled ‘A convergent non-
linear ﬁeld theory’ (Ward 1950b) was about a third of a page long.
The evidence above suggests the following as factors that may have
prevented publication of a sole and dedicated journal disclosure on
ψ
∣〉= ∣
〉−∣
〉
x y
y x
(
,
,
):
5. In the paper that he wrote with Pryce what mattered at the time was the ﬁnal
scattering result useful to experimentalists interested in testing Dirac’s pair
theory.
In
this
regard,
Pryce
and
Ward
most
likely
considered
ψ
∣〉= ∣
〉−∣
〉
x y
y x
(
,
,
) only as a necessary intermediate step to reach that
ﬁnal result. Adhering to the principle of succinctness most likely dissuaded
them from disclosure.
6. Ward’s attitude appears to express increased appreciation towards this
discovery by the time he presented his thesis since he wrote: ‘it is essential
to derive correctly the state vector which properly describes the state of the
two quanta, including their relative polarization’ (Ward 1949). However, it is
quite possible that Ward considered his thesis as a publication, as good as
any other, and thus considered the subject closed. He was a very reluctant

A-2

author. As a matter of fact he would author and co-author a mere 20 papers
in his entire career.
7. A dedicated disclosure on the subject would have had to have been a joint
paper with Pryce but their paths began to diverge around 1949.
8. In reference to items 2–4 above it is also quite obvious that the attention of
the young physicist quickly shifted from quantum optics, a futuristic subject
almost not existent at the time, to quantum electrodynamics and renormal-
ization theory which were the focus and attention of the physics community
of the epoch. Indeed, Ward would go on to co-author some of the papers that
became central in the development of the Standard Model (Salam and Ward
1959, 1961, 1964a, 1964b).
9. In the 1970s when teaching quantum mechanics, via the Feynman Lectures
on Physics (Feynman et al 1965), he would acknowledge with a shy smile and
few words his rendezvous with equations of the form ψ
∣〉= ∣〉−∣〉
R
L
(
). No
further details were added.
A.3 Conclusion
The matter of ψ
∣〉= ∣
〉−∣
〉
x y
y x
(
,
,
) did resurface between the current author and
Ward in early 2000. His attitude was that ‘everybody knew’ the score and that
eventually it would be recognized as the work of Pryce and Ward.
What did eventually transpire was that those who knew the score were old
physicists of his generation, such as Richard Dalitz, Paul Dirac, Willis Lamb,
Maurice Pryce, and C-S Wu, but there was a new score being written by a new
generation vastly unaware of the origin of
ψ
∣〉= ∣
〉−∣
〉
x y
y x
(
,
,
).
In this regard, it is ﬁtting to mention a pertinent quote on Ward’s physics: ‘… he has
drawn attention to fundamental truths, and has laid down basic principles that
physicists have followed in subsequent decades, often without knowing it, and
generally without quoting him’ (Dunhill 1995).
In summary: succinctness, renormalization, the Standard Model, and a belief in
the honesty of physics were probably factors in preventing a unique, dedicated
journal disclosure of ψ
∣〉= ∣
〉−∣
〉
x y
y x
(
,
,
), beyond his thesis, by John Ward.
Championing his own work was certainly not part of his ethos.

Classical and quantum interference
The distinctions between classical interference and quantum interference are
emphasized.
B.1 Introduction
In this appendix a description of classical interferometry (Steel 1967, Born and Wolf
1999) and quantum interferometry (Feynman et al 1965, Duarte 1993) is given. This
is done via classical N-slit interference and quantum N-slit interference. Here it is
shown that albeit N-slit interference can be described classically, this description is
only an approximation of the subtle experimental interferometric phenomenon.
B.2 The classical interference equation
From Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory, Born and Wolf (1999) derived the
interference equation for two-slit interference, or Young’s interference, as

The following observations are applicable to these classical equations:
1. These are intensity equations.
2. These are not probability equations.
3. These equations are not applicable to single-photon interference.
B.3 The N-slit quantum interference
As already discussed in chapters 2 and 29, the N-slit interferometer is perfectly

These are three equivalent equations that apply to single-photon propagation or to
the propagation of ensembles of indistinguishable photons. Equations (B.5) and (B.6)
are obtained from (B.4) while using complex wave forms to represent the probability
amplitudes (Duarte 1993, 2003) following Dirac’s lead (Dirac 1958).
These equations can also be expressed in two and three dimension as given in
chapter 2 (Duarte 1995).
The following observations are applicable to these N-slit quantum probability
equations:
1. These are probability equations.
2. These are not intensity equations.
3. These equations describe single-photon interference and interference of
populations of indistinguishable photons.
For an ensemble of r indistinguishable quanta the quantum probabilities are
related to measurable intensities via (Duarte 2019)

comprised of hundred of imaginary sub-slits thus giving rise to a diffraction pattern
(Duarte 1993), see chapter 29.

Appendix C
Interferometers and their probability amplitudes
The probability amplitudes applicable to the Mach–Zehnder interferometer, the
Michelson interferometer, the Sagnac interferometer, the N-slit interferometer, the
Hanbury Brown–Twist interferometer, and the HOM interferometer are given in
Dirac’s bra ket notation. The transition from probability amplitudes in ket notation
to matrix notation is also highlighted.
C.1 Introduction
In this appendix the probability amplitudes for the Mach–Zehnder, the Michelson,
the Sagnac, and the N-slit interferometer are given via Dirac’s notation (Dirac 1939,
1958).
The description is also extended to the Hanbury Brown–Twist interferometer and
the HOM interferometer. This treatment follows the notation given by Duarte
(2003, 2014). Excellent classical discussions on these interferometers can be found in
Michelson (1927) and Steel (1967).
C.2 Interferometers
The Mach–Zehnder, the Michelson, and the Sagnac interferometers are comprised
of beam splitters and mirrors. Here, the beam splitters are assumed to exhibit perfect
50% reﬂectivity and 50% transmission while the mirrors are assumed to be perfect
100% reﬂectors.
For a single beam splitter, as described in ﬁgure C.1, the probability amplitude is
given by

C.2.1 The Mach–Zehnder interferometer
Of particular interest to quantum computing is the Mach–Zehnder interferometer
which is comprised of an input beam splitter, an output beam splitter, and two
mirrors M1 and M2 as illustrated in ﬁgure C.2. It provides two interferometric
outputs, one at d and the other at
′
d . The interference mechanics of the counter-
propagating beams can be described via the following probability amplitude (Duarte
2003, 2014)

where j and k refer to the beam splitters in the reﬂective mode while ′j and ′

and M2 mirrors, equation (C.7) is equivalent to (Duarte 2003, 2014)

and ultimately to an equation of the form of (C.15). It should be noted that if the
mirrors M1 and M2 are not abstracted the ﬁnal result is still given by equation (C.15).
Equation (C.15) is the probability amplitude that describe single-photon prop-
agation, or the propagation of an ensemble of indistinguishable photons, in Mach–
Zehnder interferometers.
One ﬁnal observation is that equation (C.15) can be directly derived from the
generalized Dirac–Feynman superposition probability amplitude

However, physically speaking a Mach–Zehnder interferometer is very different
to a double-slit interferometer. In the double-slit interferometer the single photon,
or the population of indistinguishable photons, undergoes violent diffraction
at the slits. This diffraction makes the physics between the two interferometers
quite different. The only similarity between the two interferometers is that
they are both two-path interferometers, that is,

2. However, while the
Mach–Zehnder interferometer is a two-beam interferometer the double-slit,
two-slit, or Young, interferometer is a parallel diffraction interferometer (Duarte
2019).
C.2.2 The Michelson interferometer
The Michelson interferometer (Michelson 1927) is comprised of one beam slitter and
two mirrors M1 and M2 in an L conﬁguration as depicted in ﬁgure C.3. In reference
to the schematics the probability amplitude describing single-photon propagation
from the source s to the detector d is given by

A straightforward non-polarizing beam splitter is a partial mirror. The

deployed at θ

continue its straight path or that it will be reﬂected onto a path orthogonal to its
initial direction of propagation. No change in polarization is experienced. Going
back to the simple beam splitter, see ﬁgure C.1 with one input and two outputs, as

Twist (1956) interferometer which utilized light emitted from the star Sirius as the
light source (see ﬁgure C.7). Starting from the Dirac–Feynman probability ampli-
tude it can be shown that the interferometric superposition probability is given by

It should be noted that an approximate equivalent optical diagram of ﬁgure C.7 is
that of a single beam splitter with one input and two outputs as illustrated in
ﬁgure C.1. Assuming two identical detectors, this situation leads to a probability

Polarization rotators for quantum entanglement
This is a brief introduction to the matrices used to describe polarization rotators
such as wave plates, rhomboids, and broadband prismatic rotators.
D.1 Introduction
Polarization rotation devices are widely utilized in quantum optics. Here, an ultra-
brief introduction is given with attention to the matrices governing the rotation. For
an excellent theoretical review the book by Robson (1974) is recommended along
with Born and Wolf (1999). A more experimental perspective is given by Duarte
(2014). Here, the matrix representation for wave plates, rhomboids, and multiple-
prism rotators is presented.

Half-wave plates perform the θ

extend their wavelength performance it is necessary to use achromatic designs
incorporating multiple crystal materials.
D.3 Rhomboid polarization rotators
Another useful polarization rotator is the double-Fresnel rhomb, which is illustrated
in ﬁgure D.2. This polarization rotator is wavelength speciﬁc and it rotates polarized
light by θ
π
=
/2 so that its polarization matrix RFR is
=
R

Fresnel rhombs work by total internal reﬂection. Born and Wolf (1999) show that
there is a phase difference between the two components of polarization that is a
function of the angle of incidence on the rhomb and the refractive index of the
rhomb. This phase difference leads to the rotation of linearly polarized light. Two
rhombs can be combined into a double-rhomb to achieve θ
π
=
/2 rotation of
linearly polarized light as illustrated in ﬁgure D.2 (Duarte 2015).

D.4 Multiple-prism broadband collinear polarization rotators
One additional polarization rotator is the broadband collinear multiple-prism
rotator (Duarte 1989, 1992) displayed in ﬁgure D.3. It also rotates linearly polarized
light by θ
π
=
/2 so that its polarization matrix RMP is given by
=
R
0 1
1 0 .

This broadband collinear multiple-prism rotator has demonstrated high-ﬁdelity trans-
mission, for θ
π
=
/2 rotation, at efﬁciencies approaching 95% (Duarte 1992). Also since
the prismatic conﬁguration can be held in place mechanically, thus offering only air to
glass interfaces, it is particularly apt to rotate the polarization of high-power laser beams.
Problems
D.1 Use equation (D.2) to provide an explicit matrix for a quarter-wave plate.
D.2 Prove that transmission through two θ
π
=
/2 polarization rotators lead to
the identity matrix
=
I
1 0
0 1 .

Appendix E
Vectors, vector products, matrices, and tensors
for quantum entanglement
Vector products, matrices, and tensor elements applicable to quantum entanglement
are reviewed in a direct and succinct style. This review includes the vector and tensor
products relevant to quantum entanglement probability amplitudes. Matrix algebra
techniques directly applicable to quantum optics are described. Pauli matrices are
utilized to illustrate the mathematics of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Matrix unitary
properties are also described.
E.1 Introduction
In this appendix aspects of vector basics, vector products, matrix algebra, and tensor
products relevant to quantum entanglement are described.
This chapter is a review that brings together various subjects of interest previously
treated in separate publications by Duarte (2014, 2019), Duarte et al (2020), and
Duarte and Taylor (2021).

E.3 Vector products
Vector products are widely used in quantum entanglement calculations. This section
begins with the description of widely used vector products such as the dot product
and the cross product and continues with the quantum speciﬁc bra ket product, the
vector direct product, and the vector outer product.

E.3.4 Vector direct product
The vector direct product is of crucial signiﬁcance to the matrix description of
quantum entanglement (Duarte 2019, Duarte et al 2020). Albeit the notation of the
vector direct product also uses a dot in its nomenclature, it is different from the usual
dot product. The vector direct product is deﬁned as (Ayres 1965)

E.6 The tensor product
This section is based on the brief introduction given by Duarte (2019) and it is
speciﬁcally tailored to deal with tensor elements applicable to the mathematics of the
probability amplitude of quantum entanglement.
The tensor product, also known as the Kronecker product
⊗
U
W, is a vector–
matrix multiplication in which each element of the product vector or matrix is
comprised of each of the elements of the U vector or matrix, umn, multiplying the
whole W vector or matrix.
Thus, the ﬁrst element of the tensor product is u11W, and the last element is umn W
(Zehfuss 1858). This means, for example, that the Kronecker product of two
×
2
2
matrices yields a
×
4
4 matrix. For two-dimensional vectors this product can be
expressed as
∣〉⊗∣〉=

E.7 Equivalence in vector notation for entangled polarizations
Here, for the sake of transparency, a clariﬁcation in the deﬁnition of vector notation
is made explicit. In the notation utilized in this monograph the polarization ∣〉

(E.100)

However, in the contemporaneous literature (see, for example, Nielsen and Chuang
(2000)) the convention
∣〉= ∣〉=

long as consistency is maintained.
To illustrate the validity of the previous statement, ﬁrst the deﬁnition expressed in
equations (E.99) and (E.100) is used in

More on quantum notation
Further aspects of ψ

(

) and quantum notation, as per Dirac’s
identities, are explored.
G.1 Introduction
Here, the quantumness of equations such as ψ
∣〉= ∣

x y
y x
(
,

) is examined
further in addition to further aspects of Dirac’s notation and Dirac’s identities.

(G.1)
surfaced, for the ﬁrst time, in a discussion he had with Pryce whilst working on the
scattering quantum probability calculations from the positron–electron annihilation
γγ

∣〉= ∣

y x
(
,
,
),
in the ﬁrst place, remains unknown albeit some possible hints, as discussed next,
were available at the time. Already in 1926 Born, Heisenberg, and Pascal had
brought to the physics world their amazing discovery, succinctly expressed as (Born
et al 1926)

which is known as the commutation rule. This equation, discovered by Heisenberg,
Born, and Pascal, illustrates rather dramatically that in the quantum world
expressions such as

In this equation

G.3 Multiplication of probability amplitudes
In chapter 2 of his book, in a section titled ‘Dirac’s identities’, an introduction to the
commutative axiom of multiplication associated with ket vectors (Dirac 1958) is
given. In particular Dirac introduces the identity
∣〉∣〉= ∣〉∣〉
a b
b a .
(G.8)
Dirac does so using the preamble ‘We assume that they have a product ∣〉∣〉
a b for
which the commutative and distributive axioms of multiplication hold’. Here, a
subtlety arises: Dirac’s commutative axiom applies perfectly if ∣〉
a
and ∣〉
b
are
probability amplitudes represented by complex wave functions. For instance,
ψ

thus clearly showing that ∣〉∣〉= ∣〉∣〉

However, the same commutative axiom does not apply if the kets are associated
to vectors. For instance, if

thus conﬁrming the previous result. The conversion from a
×

1 vector to a
×

2 is
performed via the ‘vec function’ (Neudecker 1969).
Going back to complex probability amplitudes, and assuming that ∣〉∣〉= ∣〉∣〉
a b
b a
applies, then some unusual effects in notation can arise. For instance, since
∣
〉−∣
〉= ∣〉∣〉−∣〉∣〉≠
x y
y x
x y
y x
(
,
,
)
(
)
0
(G.17)
also implies that
∣〉∣〉−∣〉∣〉≠
x y
x y
(
)
0
(G.18)
since the second term in parenthesis can be expressed as
∣〉∣〉= ∣〉∣〉
x y
y x ,
(G.19)
thus establishing a complete equivalence between equations (G.18) and (G.17) when
using ‘complex wave functions’ à la Dirac.

was introduced in the absence of further details. Here, a justiﬁcation for this identity

Then Dirac makes the crucial statement that for fermions ‘two particles cannot
occupy the same state’ (Dirac 1958). This restriction means that once state ∣〉

assigned to quantum 1, thus giving rise to ∣〉
a 1, no other quantum can assume the
same state. Hence the overall matrix reduces to a diagonal matrix of the form

For bosons the situation is different: ‘with Bose statistics the probability of two
particles being in the same state is greater than with classical statistics’ (Dirac 1958).
This means that for bosons the assembly depicted in matrix (G.25) can also give
rise to combined states such as

Appendix H
From quantum principles to classical optics
The Dirac–Feynman principle is utilized to derive the generalized interference
equation that can then be applied to explain interference, diffraction, refraction, and
reﬂection in a succinct, hierarchical, and uniﬁed manner. The uncertainty principle
and the cavity linewidth equation are also explained in interferometric terms.
H.1 Introduction
In chapter 29 the idea articulated by Lamb (1987), essentially advocating that this is
a quantum world, was endorsed via the introduction of the Dirac–Feynman–Lamb
(DFL) doctrine. Dirac’s name was incorporated since he was the ﬁrst to describe
macroscopic interference using quantum principles (Dirac 1958). Feynman’s name
was also incorporated since he used quantum path integrals to describe ‘classical’
beam divergence (Feynman and Hibbs 1965). Here it is shown that the generalized
quantum interference equation can be applied to describe, in a uniﬁed, cohesive, and
hierarchical approach, interference, diffraction, refraction, and reﬂection (Duarte
1997, 2003).

These three equivalent probability equations apply to single-photon propagation
or to the propagation of ensembles of indistinguishable photons (Duarte 1993).

Since the cavity linewidth equation

equations of intracavity dispersion applicable to multiple-prism grating assem-
blies. Precise knowledge of the overall intracavity dispersion is essential for the
design of optimized high-power pulsed tunable lasers. For instance, a high
peak-power optimized multiple-prism grating solid-state dye laser, as illustrated
in ﬁgure H.2, can yield diffraction-limited beam divergence at a linewidth
of

Previously, it has been established that the measured laser linewidth

approach the limit impose by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. For laser pulse
compression the reverse is desired. That is, since
ν
Δ Δ ≈
t
1, a very broadband laser
emission can lead to a very narrow temporal pulse, the least amount of intracavity
dispersion is required. This requires detail knowledge of the ﬁrst, second, third, and
even higher derivatives of the intracavity dispersion. A typical double-prism laser
pulse compressor is depicted in ﬁgure H.6. Using the identity (Duarte 1987)

and representing the probability amplitudes with complex wave equations, as
encouraged by Dirac, the equations for generalized diffraction, generalized refrac-
tion, and reﬂection can be arrived to in a coherent and uniﬁed manner. The
traditional way to present these equations, via classical optics, is in reverse and in the
absence of cohesiveness. It was also shown that Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
can be derived from quantum interferometric principles thus again demonstrating
the enormous signiﬁcance of interference at the foundations of quantum optics.
Other equations long thought to be entirely classical in nature and origin can be
traced back to quantum interferometric principles. Such is the case for the cavity
linewidth equation and multiple-prism grating dispersion a subject that has been of
interest since the times of Newton (1704). These are further examples that reinforce
the Dirac–Feynman–Lamb doctrine: the foundation of optics is quantum and as
Willis Lamb implied… it is time we ‘learn to enjoy it’ (Lamb 1987).

Introduction to complex conjugates and
Hamilton’s quaternions
Here an introduction to Hamilton’s quaternions, as utilized in the development of
the quantum entanglement probability amplitudes for
=

N
3, 6, is given. For
completeness a section on complex numbers is also included.
I.1 Introduction
Imaginary numbers (i) are intrinsically connected to quantum probability ampli-
tudes. Hamilton’s quaternions (i, j, and k), are utilized in the development of the
probability amplitudes for
=
=
n
N
3, 6 in quantum entanglement. Hamilton’s
quaternions were introduced by the mathematician of the same name around the
mid-1800s (Hamilton 1866). A more recent review of this subject is given by
Koecher and Remmert (1991).
It should also be mentioned that Hamilton’s methods in geometrical optics ‘have
been considered to be analogous to those of quantum mechanics’ (Buchdahl 1970,
Duarte 1997).
I.2 Complex conjugates
As pointed out by Feynman (Feynman et al 1963) imaginary numbers are necessary
in the ﬁeld of mathematics to solve simple equations such as
= −

+

.
In other words, the ﬁeld of mathematics is unable to provide a complete description
of Nature without imaginary numbers.
An imaginary number is denoted as i

Note: imaginary numbers can be visualized via a simple geometrical extension of
the numerical system. Doing mathematics and physics without imaginary numbers
would be going back to ancient history. In ancient times humans were even afraid of
negative numbers.

Appendix J
Some open ended quantum questions
Some open ended quantum questions are discussed brieﬂy. These include the origin
of Planck’s constant h and the ﬁne structure constant α.
J.1 Introduction
There are some questions of enormous importance in quantum mechanics that remain
unanswered. Two of these are the origin of Planck’s constant h and the theoretical origin
of the ﬁne structure constant α. These are hard interrelated physics questions which were
the focus of Dirac’s attention throughout his life (Dirac 1938, Kursunoglu 1987).
Brief discussions on the weakness of gravity in the quantum domain and the
quantum nature of consciousness are also included.
Some of the material in this appendix is based on previous discussions in Duarte
(2014, 2019) and Duarte and Taylor (2021).
J.2 Planck’s constant
As mentioned in the introduction of this monograph, quantum mechanics was born
via a macroscopic experiment that yielded (Planck 1901)
=
ν
E
h
(J.1)
where the quantum energy is given in joules (J), ν is the measured frequency in s−1,
or Hz, and
=
×
−
h
6.626 070 15
10 34 Js is Planck’s constant. This constant is the
most important constant in the whole of quantum physics and perhaps the most
important constant in Nature. Planck’s constant is derived via measurements but it
is also related to the ﬁne structure constant as will be described in the next section.
Planck analyzed his emission experiment from a thermodynamics perspective and
eventually arrived at an expression for the entropy of the system. Just prior to
writing the expression for the entropy of the system Planck observed that ‘the energy
element ε should be proportional to the frequency ν’ (Planck 1901) so that

then using

where kB is Boltzmann’s constant given in units of J K−1 and the temperature T is
given in kelvins (K).
In his experiment, Plank arrived at

h
6.55
10 34 Js. In this monograph the
current NIST value of
=
×
−
h
6.62607015
10 34 Js is used. It should be noted that up
to 2014 the accepted value was
=
×
−
h
6.62606957
10 34 Js. An excellent review on
the history of measurements for h is given by Steiner (2013).
Note: it should be apparent that using quantum theory it is not straightforward to
arrive at an independent derivation of
=
ν
E
h
since this expression and h are deeply
engrained in the theory.
Since Dirac probability amplitudes, such as 〈∣〉
d j , originally depend only on wave
functions of the form

(

perhaps a careful re-derivation of transition and emission probabilities might open a
path forward to ﬁnd an expression for the quantum energy in the absence of ad hoc
assumptions.
J.3 The fine structure constant
At the beginning of his Lectures on Physics, Feynman highlights the existence of the
mysterious number ‘1/137’ (Feynman et al 1963) and he goes on to explain its crucial
relevance, via the coupling of the photon to ‘all charged particles’, in quantum
electrodynamics (QED).
While discussing cosmology, Dirac (1938) deﬁned various expressions of time (s).
One such time is t1 (s)

Dirac was intensely interested in the origin of α . It is said that once he was told
about a new theory, Dirac proceeded immediately to ask if the new theory could
‘calculate α’ and went on to express the hope that his own work would do so in the
future… ‘In the future, I might be able to’ (Kursunoglu 1987). So far, no known
theory can ‘calculate α’ as desired by Dirac. This is a recurring issue at the
foundations of physics that also interested Feynman deeply.
J.4 The extreme weakness of gravity in the quantum domain
Quantum gravity is a topic of intense interest and has generated a gigantic body of
literature. From a measurements perspective one of the key questions is related to
the type of measurement sensitivity needed to detect gravity effects on quantum
particles in the framework of a terrestrial laboratory. Here, h also plays a crucial
role. The following conjectural and brief heuristic discussion takes advantage of the
wave nature of the atom (Adams et al 1994) and is provided to highlight an
impressive measurements challenge.

itself would involve the use of high-vacuum techniques and laser cooling. Next,
consider a single atom laser oscillating at a frequency ν : from Schrödinger’s

the enormous challenges facing experimentalists in this ﬁeld.
J.5 Quantum consciousness
This ﬁnal section is a conjectural discussion within the principles framework
provided in this monograph. This particular discussion is about a probable
application of quantum mechanics: consciousness. For a review on the quantum
nature of consciousness and the debate surrounding this concept, readers should
refer to Hameroff and Penrose (2014).
Following these authors, it is assumed that microtubules, within neurons, are
capable of performing computations and storing information. Thus, microtubules
are analogous to beam splitters and polarization rotators in optical quantum
computers.

other quantum processes such as ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (ASE) (Duarte and

Penrose’s original suggestion linking ‘the collapse of ψ’ to ‘gravity.’

trajectory of consciousness. Certainly, this is an extremely minimalist representation
of the integral process that might ultimately lead to what we experience as
consciousness and even understanding. In this regard, superposition probability
amplitudes should represent a vast spectrum of phenomena from simple quantum
entanglement states to highly sophisticated states yet to be observed. We already
