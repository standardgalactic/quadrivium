Introduction to Semantic 
Analysis

Semantic Analysis 
• Lexical analysis 
– Detects inputs with illegal tokens 
 
• Parsing 
– Detects inputs with ill-formed parse trees 
 
• Semantic analysis 
– Last “front end” phase 
– Catches all remaining errors 

Alex Aiken 
Semantic Analysis 
• Parsing cannot catch some errors 
 
• Some language constructs not context-free

Checks of many kinds . . . coolc checks: 
1. All identifiers are declared 
2. Types  
3. Inheritance relationships 
4. Classes defined only once 
5. Methods in a class defined only once 
6. Reserved identifiers are not misused 
And others . . .

The requirements depend on the language
