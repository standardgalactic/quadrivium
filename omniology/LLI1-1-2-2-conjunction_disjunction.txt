§1-2-2 Negation, Conjunction, and Disjunction

Truth, Falsity and Negation
Propositions are the sort of things that are true or false.
We write 1 for ‘true’ and 0 for ‘false’.

Truth, Falsity and Negation
Propositions are the sort of things that are true or false.
We write 1 for ‘true’ and 0 for ‘false’.
If a proposition A is true, then since the proposition ∼A and A
can’t be true together, we know that ∼A is false.

Propositions are the sort of things that are true or false.

This is called a truth table for the formula ∼A. It shows how the
truth or falsity of ∼A depends on the truth or falsity of A.

Truth table for conjunction
Conjunctions are true when both of the conjuncts are true.
And they’re false the rest of the time.

Truth table for disjunction
Disjunctions are true when at least one of the disjuncts is true.
And they’re false the rest of the time.

Exercise: Truth Tables
Suppose we define (A ⋆B) as “neither A nor B.”
Complete the truth table for the ⋆connective: for 1, mark the
check-box, and for 0, leave the check-box unmarked.

Conjunction, Disjunction and Negation
We can evaluate one or more complex formulas in a single table,
starting from inner-most atomic propositions and working
outwards.
