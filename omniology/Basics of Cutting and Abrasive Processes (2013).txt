Preface
‘‘The principal part of a chisel is the cutting edge. If there is a single principle on
which our business rests—it is that.’’, Henry Ford wrote in his memoires ‘‘My life
and work’’. A contemporary of Henry Ford was Frederick Winslow Taylor. We
know him as the ﬁrst engineer, who worked scientiﬁcally in the ﬁeld of cutting
technology. His work ‘‘On the art of cutting metals’’, published in 1907 was the
ﬁrst scientiﬁc contribution in the ﬁeld of manufacturing which was able to describe
parts of the cutting process qualitatively as well as quantitatively.
The signiﬁcance of cutting and abrasive processes has grown substantially
during the last century with the development of the automotive, aircraft and
machine building industry. Therefore, the theory of these processes and knowledge
about their application in industrial practice are a prerequisite for the studies of
manufacturing science and an important part of the curriculum of the master study
in German mechanical engineering.
The basis of this book is our lecture ‘‘Basics of cutting and abrasive processes’’
(4 semester hours/3 credit hours) at the Leibniz University Hannover, which we
offer to the diploma and master students specializing in manufacturing science. We
present the knowledge of modern manufacturing in these technologies. Compre-
hensive research in the laboratory of Production Engineering and Machine Tools
of our institute introduces the newest results in the relevant ﬁelds.
The introductory chapter explains the signiﬁcance of cutting and abrasive
processes to manufacturing science using examples of industrial practice and gives
criteria to evaluate cutting and abrasive processes with respect to economic and
ecological issues. General material removal principles are presented in the next
chapter. Large strains and strain rates and the moving of material with its
instantaneously generated new surface over the tool faces under high load, are the
speciﬁc characteristics of cutting in general. However, there is a broad variety of
processes requiring a systematic taxonomy.
The following chapters discuss the four basic criteria, i.e. chip formation, forces
and power, wear and surface generation. We see an important impetus on our work
in a scientiﬁc and analytical approach to cutting and we have tried to describe the
phenomena and their dependencies on input variables based on physical models
and perceptions rather than presenting mere empirical equations. A particular
chapter on modelling and simulation was written due to the fact that meanwhile,
v

there is a large variety of highly productive options to determine process and
effective variables, not only in a momentary recording but also on the basis of
kinematic or motion studies, which are adapted to actual machining processes, i. e.
illustrate the ongoing process. It is the concern of this chapter to enable the reader
to ﬁnd his way around the various approaches and their limits. Dr.-Ing. Böß with
his mathematical competence, took over the generation of this section to a large
extent.
The progress of cutting and abrasive processes is strongly based on the
development of cutting materials. Therefore, the different materials and their
speciﬁc application domains described are followed consequently by new tech-
nologies, e.g. hard machining, high speed and high performance cutting.
New ﬁndings concerning the inﬂuence of the micro-geometry of the cutting
wedge on the wear behavior of a tool, on the force and performance requirements
in cutting and not least, on the surface inﬂuence have been included. The chapter
‘‘Surface and surface zone properties’’ contains the latest status of measurement
possibilities, based on the work of Dr. rer. nat. habil. Breidenstein.
We owe some valuable information about new processes for the dressing of
grinding wheels, which have just recently been put into practice, by Prof. Dr.-Ing.
T. Lierse and the company Kaiser GmbH, Celle. Numerous co-workers of the
institute have helped to accomplish this edition. Therefore, we would especially
like to thank Dr.-Ing. V. Böß, Dr. rer. nat. habil. B. Breidenstein, Dipl.-Ing.
J. Henjes, Dipl.-Math. A. Schindler and Dipl.-Ing. V. Sellmeier for their com-
mitted and competent co-operation. We would also sincerely like to thank Birte
Fischer and Julia Körber, who carried out the translation.
Your suggestions and corrections will be appreciated.

Introduction to the Technology of Cutting
and Abrasive Processes
1.1 Economic Relevance
It stands to reason that manufacturing and assembly play an essential role in the
industrial production process: They represent the transfer of planned products into
real products by the fabrication of components, units and aggregates. Manufac-
turing processes can be divided into six main groups [TÖN94, DIN8580]:
• primary shaping
• forming
• separating
• joining
• coating
• changing material properties.
Cutting and abrasive processes are part of the main group of separation pro-
cesses. They are mainly used for metallic materials and are fundamental steps in
the production processes in machine and vehicle manufacturing, in the aerospace
industry, in equipment and drive technology, in biomedical engineering and in
many other industrial sectors. They provide an unsurpassed range of options for
adapting qualities and shapes as well as the productivity. Compared to related,
partly competing manufacturing processes like casting and forging, they stand out
due to the large range of producible designs and shapes as well as their high
accuracy. However, they are inferior to these processes regarding efﬁciency and
productivity, i.e., the number of parts produced per unit time, at least in the
production of larger quantities. Furthermore, in cutting and abrasive processes
chips are removed from a workpiece, which includes material loss; therefore,
cutting and abrasive processes are also inferior regarding sustainability, i.e.,
stewardship of energy and material resources. Figure 1.1 shows a rough qualitative
comparison of cutting and abrasive processes with casting and forging.
Cutting and abrasive processes provide accuracies within the ISO tolerance
grades of IT2 to IT10. They are used for the individual production of single pieces
or small numbers of pieces, e.g., for the production of customized endoprostheses;

for the production of small or medium series, e.g., for racing vehicle engine
components and for mass production, e.g., in automotive engineering. Because
they provide high accuracies, they are often placed at the end of a sequence of
several manufacturing processes, which means that additional emphasis has to be
put on the process reliability. As mentioned above, cutting and abrasive processes
can be used to produce a nearly unlimited variety of shapes. This is mainly due to
the fact that they are generating (in the sense of kinematically controlled) pro-
cesses (in contrast to copying processes): the necessary tool geometry is inde-
pendent from the ﬁnal shape of the product. In other words, the product is not an
image of the tool shape, but its shape is produced by a controlled movement and
interaction between the tool and the workpiece (Fig. 1.2). This means that the
movement of the tool can be directly computer-controlled using path variables.
This provides high ﬂexibility: Different components can be produced within a
continuous sequence or clamping and a lot size of 1 is feasible.

Introduction to the Technology of Cutting and Abrasive Processes

Figure 1.3 shows that cutting and abrasive processes are of decisive relevance
in serial production, e.g., in automotive engineering.
1.2 Taxonomy
Cutting and abrasive processes represent manufacturing by means of material
separation, particularly of material removal. Material in the form of chips is
mechanically removed from a raw part/workpiece by one cutting edge (in turning),
several cutting edges (in milling) or numerous cutting edges (in grinding). In
cutting processes, the number of cutting edges, the shape of the cutting edges and
their position in relation to the workpiece are known and describable (Fig. 1.4). In
contrast, in abrasive processes, only statistical parameters are known regarding the
geometry and the number of the cutting edges in the abrasive material.
According to the most comprehensive taxonomy of cutting and abrasive pro-
cesses [TÖN94b, CIRP04, DIN8589-0], the groups of cutting processes respec-
tively abrasive processes can ﬁrst be further divided regarding the speciﬁc process
(1st digit: separation, 2nd digit: cutting, abrasive processes, 3rd digit: e.g., turning,
milling), and then according to
• the geometry of the surface to be produced (4th digit: plain/slab, cylindrical/
circular, thread/helical, hobbing, proﬁle, form)1
• the feed direction (5th: orthogonal, longitudinal) or tool characteristics
• the position of the surface to be produced (6th digit: external, internal)
Typical examples of turning processes are presented in Fig. 1.5.

1.3 Motions, Angles at the Cutting Edge and Engagement
Parameters
In cutting processes, a cutting edge penetrates into the workpiece material. The
relative movement between the tool and the workpiece can be described by means
of the primary motion (cutting motion) with the cutting speed vc and the feed
motion with the feed speed vf (Fig. 1.6). The depth of cut and the feed speed
determine the cross-section of the undeformed chip A.

Introduction to the Technology of Cutting and Abrasive Processes

The vectors of the feed speed and the cutting speed span the working plane
(Fig. 1.7). The vectorial sum of the cutting speed and the feed speed is the
effective cutting speed ve. The cutting speed and the effective cutting speed form
the effective cutting speed angle g. The cutting speed and the feed speed form the
feed motion angle u. In turning and drilling (in all processes with a helical or
linear effective cutting motion) g and u are constant (u = 90), while in milling,

tool (independently from the real actions in the process), thus pretending that the workpiece is
ﬁxed in position and that the tool performs all motions. In most real turning processes (but by no
means all), the tool performs the feed motion while the workpiece performs the rotary motion)

circular sawing and grinding (in all processes with a cycloidal effective cutting
motion) they are variable and time-dependent.
In all processes with a constant feed motion angle of u = 90 (turning, drilling,
broaching), i.e., all processes with a linear, helical or spiral effective cutting
motion, the material removal rate Qw (the volume of material removed per unit
time) is
Qw ¼ ap  f  vc;
ð1:1Þ
while in processes with a time-dependent feed motion angle (milling, grinding,
circular sawing), it is
Qw ¼ ap  ae  vf:
ð1:2Þ
It might be surprising that (according to Eq. 1.1) the material removal rate for
turning processes is calculated using the cutting speed, whereas according to
Eq. 1.2, the feed speed is used for milling processes. Figure 1.8 illustrates that
turning can be regarded as a special case of milling and consequently with a ﬁxed
tool, the primary motion actually is a feed motion.
The relevant angles at the cutting edge are located within different planes. In the
tool orthogonal plane (i.e., the plane orthogonal to the tool reference plane and the
cutting edge plane), these are the clearance a (a [ 0 in every case), the rake
angle c (c [ 0 if the tool tip is preceding) and the wedge angle b = 90 -
(a ? c). In the cutting edge plane the relevant angle is the tool cutting edge
inclination k (k [ 0 if the tool tip is proceeding). The tool cutting edge angle j
and the tool included angle e are located in the tool reference plane (Fig.1.9). The
cutting edge itself is deﬁned by the corner radius re, measured in the tool reference
plane and by the cutting edge rounding, measured in the tool orthogonal plane
using the cutting edge radius rb.
The undeformed chip cross section A can be described using two different
systems of parameters: either by coordinates derived from the relative movement
between the tool and the workpiece, i.e., the engagement parameters ap (depth of

1.4 Cutting and Abrasive Processes as Black Box Systems
From a system-oriented point of view, cutting and abrasive processes can be
described as black boxes with input variables and output variables (Fig. 1.11). The
input variables can be divided into system variables and manipulated variables (set
variables). System variables describe process conditions which are either com-
pletely ﬁxed or at least constant over a relatively long period of time. They depend
on the machine tool (static and dynamic stiffness, temperature response), the
workpiece (strength, shape of the raw part, chemical composition, structure) and
the tool (material, shape, mechanical properties) (Fig. 1.11).
The manipulated variables or set variables for each workpiece or job order are
usually assessed and adjusted manually or using a program memory. They include
the rotational speed or cutting speed, feed speed (depth of cut) and width of cut
(infeed of the tool towards the workpiece). Furthermore, they can include the
cutting liquid supply and the clamping force applied to ﬁx the workpiece.
The output variables are divided into process and effect variables. Process
variables like resultant forces, powers, temperatures in the chip formation zone,
vibrations caused by the process and acoustic emissions are only perceivable
during the actual process. They can be used for monitoring or diagnosing purposes
[TÖN01]. Effect variables can be measured at the workpiece (deviations in
dimension, shape and position, micro-geometry, inﬂuence on the external surface
zone), at the tool (wear), at the machine tool (temperature rise, wear) and in the
cutting ﬂuids (temperature rise, contamination and chemical properties).
In the process the input variables are converted into output variables. The
transmission behavior of the process can be characterized by a comparison of the
Fig. 1.11 Cutting and abrasive processes as a black box system

Introduction to the Technology of Cutting and Abrasive Processes

input and output variables. The following four criteria are used for evaluating a
process and deﬁne the machinability:
• resultant force
• tool wear
• surface properties of the workpiece
• chip form.
It is assumed that the input variables are predetermined, because the main
technology and the productivity (e.g., the material removal rate) are determined by
the process, the machine tool and the corresponding movement control [TÖN94a].
The resultant forces inﬂuence
• the design of the machine tool drives
• the design of the machine tool frame, respectively the deformation of the
machine tool frame
• the power requirement
• the elastic deformation of the workpiece and the tool
• the requirements on the clamping systems for the workpiece and the tool.
The tool wear has a crucial inﬂuence on the economic efﬁciency of the process.
The deviation of the surface properties from the ideal target values (dimensions,
shape, position, roughness, physical properties of the external zone) determines the
workpiece quality. The chip form is important for the tool design (ﬂutes or gullets
for chip removal), for the design of the working space of the machine tool and for
an disturbance-free process (process reliability).
1.5 Process Types and Engagement Parameters in Drilling
Drilling is a cutting process with a rotational primary motion. Common drilling
processes are shown in Fig. 1.12. The tools usually have a complex design. The
following general characteristics of drilling processes can make their use
problematic:
• The cutting speed is dependent on the radius, i.e., it is proportional to the radius
from the axis of rotation of the drill and has a value of zero at the axis itself. As
a result, no material separation can take place at this part of the drill. This
inﬂuences the necessary forces and torques.
• Chips have to be removed from the drilled hole. The respective travel distance
increases with the drilling depth, which can cause problems in the chip removal.
• The supply of cutting liquid also becomes increasingly difﬁcult with an increase
in the drilling depth, which sometimes makes additional measures necessary
(internal cutting liquid supply).
• Drilling tools can only produce holes of ﬁxed dimensions, so that the drilling
diameter cannot be adjusted by means of the process control.

In the following, two technological parameters that make up essential manip-
ulated variables will be deﬁned using the example of drilling processes: the cutting
speed vc and the feed per cutting edge fz. They are each limited by a characteristic
process limit. The cutting speed is limited due to the thermal load and thus by the
wear behavior of the tool, while the feed per cutting edge is limited due to the
mechanical load. The derived manipulated variables like the rotational speed nt
with the drilling radius r and the feed speed vf with the cutting edge number z
depend on these technological parameters as follows:
nt ¼ vc= 2  p  r

material removal rate in drilling from the solid is

with the feed f of the drill:
f ¼ z  fz
ð1:8Þ
The twist drill consists of a shank (cylindrical or conical) and a cutting part. The
terminology for drills, the engagement parameters and the angles at the cutting
edges are illustrated in Fig. 1.13. The drill is clamped and guided by the shank. As
a result the shank particularly serves the purpose of torque transmission. By means
of the complex cutting edge geometries of the different drills, the tool can be
adapted to each speciﬁc drilling task. On the one hand, the proﬁle of the twist drill

has to possess large ﬂutes in order to provide sufﬁcient space for chip removal; on
the other hand, the drill must exhibit appropriate torsional rigidity (polar moment
of inertia) and torsional strength (shear modulus). The helix angle d of the ﬂutes
inﬂuences both the chip removal and the rake angle at the cutting edges.
The rake angle at the drill has an essential inﬂuence on the deformation and the
forces at the cutting edges. We distinguish between the rake angle at the chisel
edge cq, which can by all means be highly negative due to geometrical reasons and
the rake angle at the major cutting edge ch (Fig. 1.14).
Near the center of the drill, cq is -r/2. Further along the chisel edge it rises
slightly but remains within the range of

Figure 1.15 illustrates the signiﬁcant change in the rake angle along the radius
of the drill, by means of a cross-section through the chip formation zone in front of
the cutting edges.
The drill-point shape of the twist drill has an essential inﬂuence on the cutting
ability, because it determines the clearance angle. Attention has to be paid to the
fact that the ratio of the feed speed to the cutting speed and thus the effective
cutting speed angle g along the cutting edges, vary with the drill radius (Fig. 1.14).
Taking this speed ratio into account, the clearance angle has to be increased—if
only for kinematic reasons—in order to avoid pressure generation (for a detailed
derivation, see Sect. 7.1). Because the cutting edge is inclined by a lead angle of
j = -r/2, the minimum clearance angle amin can be calculated regardless of
elastic ﬂattening as:

assuming that the cutting edge is not preceding (s = 0).
Vice versa, if the minimum clearance angle at the outer radius of the web rq is
given, the maximum permitted feed across the radius fmax/2ra can be calculated as

ð1:13Þ
With common values (r = 118, rq/ra = 0.2) and assuming a minimum
clearance angle of amin = 2, the maximum permitted feed related to the outer
diameter is fmax/2ra = 0.026. Considering ﬂattening and wear, the value used in
the process should never exceed half this calculated value.
The drill-point is ground considering the following conditions:
• The drill should have appropriate centering properties.
• The clearance angle should be adequately large along the whole length of the
cutting edge.
• However, the cutting edge should be as stable as possible.
• The chisel edge should be as short as possible because of the disadvantageous
chip formation processes.
The most common drill-point shape for HSS twist drills is the conical point. It
is produced by grinding the drill using a grinding face, revolving the drill around
an axis that is inclined by a certain angle towards its center axis, e.g., with a tilt
angle of 20. The clearance angle is thus part of a cone surface. It increases
towards the axis of rotation. The conical point can be ground using a simple
kinematic process on a point grinding machine.
There is also a range of special drill-point shapes which are partly standardized
(DIN1412) and partly manufacturer-speciﬁc. Depending on the speciﬁc applica-
tion, particular signiﬁcance is attached to one of the conditions mentioned above.
Some special drill-point shapes are presented in Fig. 1.16.
To produce shape A the chisel edge is reduced to about half its initial length by
web thinning, with the shape of the thinned chisel edge adjusted to the ﬂute proﬁle.
The shortening of the chisel edge reduces the feed forces, while it has almost no
inﬂuence on the torque.
To produce shape B out of shape A, the rake angle is corrected at the major
cutting edges. Thus, the rake angle is no longer dependent on the helix angle of the
ﬂutes. Such corrections can increase the stability of the cutting edges and have a
positive effect on the chip form.
The split point (shape C) can be regarded as a special kind of web thinned point.
The length of the chisel edge is reduced to about 6 % of the outer radius. Hence,
even positive rake angles can be produced at the chisel edge.
In boring out and countersinking processes, a previously produced hole is
enlarged. It is difﬁcult to guide the tool on a coaxial path, because there is no

center point in the workpiece material, so the tools generally have three or multiple
cutting edges. However, chip removal is easier than in drilling from the solid.
Therefore, bore holes with a high diameter are often predrilled using a smaller
twist drill and then enlarged within several steps, until they reach the nominal
diameter. This procedure is also called for, if the maximum permitted feed force,
respectively the maximum permitted torque of a machine are not sufﬁcient to drill
the hole within one stroke. The material removal rate in drill out processes with the
inner radius ri is

Center drilling is necessary, if the surface to be drilled is rough, uneven or
inclined. It can be avoided by using a very stiff guidance for the drill (drill clamped
with a short projecting length, stiff spindle) or by using drill bushings.
Trepanning is used for large bore hole diameters. An annular cut is produced
instead of cutting the whole bore diameter. This reduces the required torque and
power. However, trepanning can only be used for through holes.
Tapping is used to produce internal threads. The tap feed must be adjusted to
the thread pitch. In machine production, this can be achieved by exact guidance
using an NC machine tool or by ﬁrst using a starting taper and then a tap holder.
The rotational direction has to be reversed to remove the drill from the hole. If
multi spindle bar machines are used, special devices are needed for this purpose
(disconnecting the spindle and reversing the rotational direction or using a second
spindle which is attached to the tool and outruns the workpiece spindle). To avoid
having to reverse the rotational direction, large internal threads can be produced by
thread chasing, which is proﬁle turning within several strokes. This can also be
done using controllable collapsible taps.

Introduction to the Technology of Cutting and Abrasive Processes

Reaming is a ﬁnishing process corresponding to a boring out process with a
multiple edged tool and a small depth of cut. It is used for bore holes with high
dimension and shape accuracy. The position accuracy cannot be inﬂuenced. Tol-
erance grades of IT 7—with an increased effort even IT 6—can be achieved. The
surface roughness Rz is about 5 lm. Conventional HSS reamers are used at low
cutting speeds of 10–20 m/min and low feed rates of 0.08–1.25 mm. If clocked
automated systems are used, this kind of reaming has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
clock cycle. Therefore, alternative processes and tools have been developed.
1.6 Process Types and Engagement Parameters in Milling
In milling, the necessary relative movement between the tool and the workpiece is
achieved by a rotational cutting motion of the tool and a feed motion orthogonal or
at a certain angle to the rotational axis of the tool. The feed motion can be
performed by the tool or the workpiece or by a combined movement of the two.
The cutting edges are not permanently engaged. The feed motion angle and the
effective cutting speed angle are time-dependent (see Sect. 1.3). The most
important milling processes are shown in Fig. 1.17. They are classiﬁed according
to the produced shapes, which are determined by the feed motion. In face milling
the rotation axis of the tool is orthogonal to the produced surface, while in
peripheral milling it is parallel to the surface. Side milling is a combination of
these two processes and is used to produce two surfaces that are orthogonal to each
other. Helical milling and hobbing produce helical or gear surfaces. In proﬁle

milling the tool shape is reproduced on the workpiece, making its shape and
dimensions dependent on those of the tool. The largest variety of shapes can be
produced by form milling, even though the range of producible shapes depends on
the number of controllable feed axes on the milling machine. A milling machine
usually possesses three linear feed axes, which can be controlled both simulta-
neously and independently (continuous path control), enabling the tool to follow
any three-dimensional path. In special machines, two rotational axes are added to
these three linear axes (ﬁve axes milling), so that the rotational axis of the milling
cutter can be positioned in any direction at any point of the path.
If we focus on the productivity of the milling process in roughing processes,
i.e., on removing large volumes of workpiece material as fast as possible, we have
to determine the material removal rate Qw:
Qw ¼ ap  ae  vf
ð1:15Þ
If we want to cut a large surface by a ﬁnishing process, the productivity is
determined using the area cut per time unit _Aw (applicable for face milling; for
peripheral milling, ae is replaced by ap):
_Aw ¼ ae  vf
ð1:16Þ
At any point of time each cutting edge of the milling cutter is engaged by a
maximum of 180 or less, leading to an interrupted cut. The chips produced in the
process are comma-shaped. The engagement parameters are dependent on the
penetration angle/feed motion angle u (Fig. 1.18).
The milling process is often characterized using the mean chip thickness hm. It
is the average chip thickness across the engagement path.

According to the approach type, we distinguish between down milling and up
milling (Figs. 1.19, 1.20).
In the down milling process, the cutting edge enters the workpiece at the thicker
end of the comma-shaped chip and builds up a shock-type resultant force.
Therefore, the machine tool must exhibit appropriate dynamic stiffness (against
vibrations). In the up milling process, the chip formation starts at the thinner end,
thus pressure forming takes place at the beginning. This results in unfavorable chip

formation conditions, because the chip thickness is below the minimum value in
the beginning and instead of chip formation only high normal forces and friction
forces occur, leading to an increased wear compared to that in the down milling
process. If the machine tool and the workpiece allow for it, down milling should be
used. In particular, the machine tool must not allow for any backlash in the feed
drive—a condition which is met by all modern NC machine tools anyway. In down
milling, one force component is orthogonal to the produced surface and thus the
workpiece is automatically pressed against the supporting surface. This also makes
down milling convenient for the cutting of long, slender workpieces, which, in up
milling would be pulled away from the supporting surface. In face milling, the
process mode changes between up and down milling, depending on the position of
the rotation axis towards the workpiece, as illustrated in Fig. 1.18.
According to Eq. 1.17, the mean chip thickness is calculated as the average
value of the chip thickness across the engagement path. In literature this is sim-
pliﬁed by using the value of the chip thickness across the average value of the
engagement path. Equation 1.17 shows that the relation between the path and the
chip thickness is nonlinear. Thus these two deﬁnitions are not identical. However,
there is only a slight difference in the calculated chip thickness for both up and
down milling.

Chip Formation
In cutting and abrasive processes, the cutting edge penetrates into the workpiece
material, which is thus plastically deformed and slides off along the rake face of
the cutting edge. This is called chip formation. The processes in chip formation
can be examined within the orthogonal plane (Fig. 1.9), because essential parts of
the material ﬂow take place within this plane (Fig. 2.1). We can assume that the
deformation is two-dimensional. The two-dimensional deformation is only dis-
turbed at the edges of the cross section of the undeformed chip, at the free surface
and in front of the cutting edge corner, as there is material ﬂow at an angle towards
the orthogonal plane, which is caused by linkage to the undeformed material by the
free surface respectively.
Depending on the deformation behavior of the workpiece material, there are
different mechanisms of chip formation with either continuous or discontinuous
chip ﬂow.
2.1 Mechanisms of Chip Formation
Depending on the workpiece material and the cutting conditions, the following
mechanisms of chip formation can be distinguished (Fig. 2.2):
• continuous chip formation
• lamellar chip formation
• segmented chip formation
• discontinuous chip formation.
In continuous chip formation the chip slides off along the rake face at a constant
speed in a stationary ﬂow. Continuous chip formation is promoted by a uniform,
ﬁne-grained structure and high ductility of the workpiece material, by high cutting
speeds and low friction on the rake face, by positive rake angles and a low
undeformed chip thickness (Fig 2.3).

Lamellar chip formation is a continuous, periodic chip formation process
similar to pure continuous chip formation. However, there are variations in the
deformation process that cause more or less signiﬁcant cleavages or even con-
centrated shear bands. The lamellae are produced due to thermal or elastome-
chanical processes with a high formation frequency within the kHz range.
Lamellar chips occur with highly ductile workpiece materials with an increased
strength, especially at high cutting speeds (q. v. high speed cutting).
Segmented chip formation is the discontinuous formation of a chip with still
more or less connected elements, yet with signiﬁcant variations in the degree of
Fig. 2.2 Mechanisms of chip formation
Fig. 2.1 Undeformed chip cross section and the cutting edge

Chip Formation

deformation along the ﬂow path. It primarily occurs with negative rake angles,
lower cutting speeds and a higher chip thickness.
Discontinuous chip formation occurs if the plastic ductility of the workpiece
material is very low or if predeﬁned slide paths are formed due to high inhomo-
geneities (e. g. if cast iron with lamellar graphite is machined). Parts of the
workpiece material are ripped out of the compound material without signiﬁcant
deformation. The workpiece surface is then rather produced by the ripping out
process in the chip formation than by the tool traces.
With continuous chip formation, built-up edges can occur (Fig. 2.4). They are
formed by particles of the workpiece material, which adhere to the rake face and to
the cutting edge. These particles have been subject to high deformation and have

Fig. 2.4 Formation of built-up edges
2.1
Mechanisms of Chip Formation
23

been strain-hardened. They are much harder than the base workpiece material.
Built-up edges only occur if
• the workpiece material promotes strain-hardening,
• the chip formation is stable and largely stationary,
• there is a stagnant zone in the material ﬂow in front of the cutting edge,
• the temperatures in the chip formation zone are sufﬁciently low and do not allow
for recrystallization.
Built-up edges inﬂuence the cutting edge geometry. They generally facilitate
chip formation (lower forces). When they move off, they can drag along workpiece
particles (adhesive wear). Sometimes strain-hardened parts of the built-up edges
are integrated into the newly formed workpiece surface. Therefore, the formation
of built-up edges is generally undesirable. However, it does not occur at higher
cutting speeds and resulting higher temperatures in the chip formation zone,
because there is no strain-hardening if the recrystallization temperature is excee-
ded during the deformation process.
The process for continuous chip formation can be described using a model of
ﬁve deformation zones (Fig. 2.5). The main part of the plastic deformation takes
place in the primary shear zone in the form of shear deformation. In the secondary
shear zones in front of the rake face and the ﬂank face, the workpiece material is
additionally deformed under the inﬂuence of high friction forces. A stagnant zone
(zone with high pressure from all sides) develops in front of the cutting edge. The
actual separation of workpiece material also takes place in this zone. Furthermore,
Fig. 2.5 Chip formation zones [WAR74]

Chip Formation

minor plastic deformations occur in the preliminary deformation zone. This zone
has an essential inﬂuence on the penetration depth of plastic deformations in the
workpiece and so on the external workpiece zone.
2.2 Chip Root Analysis
Several methods have been developed to visualize the deformation process in front
of the cutting edge and to analyze the chip formation process and the material
behavior in the working zone. The most important methods are
• interrupted cut
• micro-cinematography
• the ﬁnite element method (FEM).
The analyses provide information on the mechanisms of chip formation, the
plastic deformations in the chip formation zone and the position of the shear plane.
They provide the basis for a calculation of the kinematic, mechanical and thermal
conditions in the chip formation zone.
The basic principle of the interrupted cut is an abrupt separation of the tool
from the workpiece. The current status in the deformation process is thus ‘‘fro-
zen’’, can be subject to metallographic preparation and analyzed under the
microscope. Although the process is interrupted in an abrupt manner (quick–stop),
the process has to be slowed down from the initial deformation speed until it
actually comes to zero. Therefore, the cutting process is not frozen at the normal,
stationary cutting speed, but at an unsteady phase while slowing down. In spite of
this, the interrupted cut method is widely accepted. It should however be con-
sidered problematic for highly time-dependent processes, like thermally domi-
nated processes or processes with fast, unsteady deformation.
The cutting speed at which the chip root is to be frozen determines the design of
the devices used for the interrupted cut. Especially with high cutting speeds, the
process has to be interrupted within a minimum time interval to.
Figure 2.6 is a highly simpliﬁed illustration of the speed ratios for the inter-
rupted cut method. We assume that the constant acceleration a is negative
(deceleration), thus
vrel ¼ vc  aT  t
ð2:1Þ
With vrel = 0 m/min after t0, the necessary braking distance Dx is
Dx ¼ 1
2 vct0
ð2:2Þ
These equations can be used to determine the necessary deceleration a for the
maximum permitted braking distance:
2.1
Mechanisms of Chip Formation
25

aT ¼

2Dx
ð2:3Þ
This shows that the deceleration value has to be very high, even with low
cutting speeds and a maximum permitted braking distance of up to 10 % of the
undeformed chip thickness. Please note that the second order value of the cutting
speed is used in Eq. 2.3. In order to keep the necessary deceleration forces within
acceptable limits, especially with high cutting speeds, it is important to keep the
decelerated masses at a minimum (Fig 2.6).
Different methods can be used to interrupt the cut (Abb. 2.7). Generally, either
the tool or the workpiece can be accelerated or decelerated.
Part (a) of Fig. 2.7 illustrates the principle of interrupting the cut by acceler-
ating the tool [KLO93]. Usually, the whole tool unit is accelerated via the tool
holder. The necessary potential energy which has initially been stored is trans-
ferred into kinetic energy within a few milliseconds. The energy is stored using

springs, compressed air or explosive materials. The tool can also be accelerated by
means of mechanical cut-off devices [BAI88]. For this purpose, a mechanical
barrier initially rotates with the tool and is then within one revolution, brought to a
position where it accelerates the tool out of the workpiece.
In part (b), the tool (a double-sided cutting insert) is ﬁxed on a low-mass slide.
For example, the slide is accelerated using compressed air and hits the workpiece.
A short length of material is cut (by planing), and the tool on the slide is decel-
erated by the workpiece, which works as an impact ring.
The method illustrated in part (c) relates to a set-up for high cutting speeds
developed by Ben Amor [BEN03] based on an approach by Buda [BUD68]. This
method can only be used for very low masses. Some details of this method are
illustrated in Fig. 2.8. A predetermined breaking point is introduced into a bar,
which is then cut by radial grooving. The remaining cross section at the prede-
termined breaking point is ﬁnally reduced to an extent where the break stress is
exceeded and the segment breaks off from the workpiece. This segment including
adhesive chips, is then accelerated away from the workpiece by means of the
cutting force and is used as a chip root for the analysis of the chip formation
process. The following exemplary values demonstrate that this method is very
effective. The given parameters are as follows:
h  b ¼ 0:2  3 mm2; vc ¼ 300 m=min; C45 steel; Fc ¼ 1800 N; m ¼ 3 g:
We assume that the initial accelerating force is applied throughout the whole
separation process and that accordingly, the acceleration is constant. As a result,
aT ¼ Fc=m
ð2:4Þ

Chip Root Analysis
27

According to Eq. 2.3, the corresponding acceleration distance is 21 lm.
Figure 2.9 shows a chip root obtained by this method at a high cutting speed.
Although the accelerating distance is higher than 10 % of the undeformed chip
thickness, the image is well-suited for analyzing the deformation mechanisms in
front of the cutting edge.
Part (d) of Fig. 2.7 illustrates the method of accelerating a low-mass workpiece
in a slideway by means of compressed air and then, after a short length of material
has been cut, rapidly decelerating it by making it hit an impact plate. The chip
roots in Fig. 2.10 have been obtained using a similar method with an initial cutting
speed of 2,400 m/min and a braking distance of less than 20 lm [HOW05].
In contrast to the interrupted cut method, micro-cinematography allows for
examining the chip formation while the process is still running [WAR74]. For this
purpose, a polished and etched specimen (black-and-white structure) is pressed
against a fused quartz glass plate (Fig. 2.11) and cut by orthogonal turning. The
process can be observed through the fused quartz glass plate and magniﬁed using a
microscope. However, the image of the process is only an approximation because
of the free surface of the workpiece. Images without motion blur can only be taken
at cutting speeds of up to 1 m/min.
2.3 Shear Plane Model
Several theories for the calculation of parameters in cutting and abrasive processes
make use of a shear plane model, assuming that all plastic deformations take place
within the shear plane. Depending on the deformation behavior of the workpiece

material and on the process conditions, this model can be adequately true to
reality. If we assume that the shear plane model (Fig. 2.12) is applicable and that
the deformation is two-dimensional (orthogonal cut), the shear velocity v/ can be
calculated as

the dimensional changes in the transverse and axial direction (Poisson’s ratio v): D V/V = (1–2

Chip Formation

The compression of the chip thickness kh (chip thickness ratio) can be deter-
mined by measuring the chip thickness or the chip length (with an interrupted cut)
and by means of the manipulated variables, so that the shear angle / can be
determined experimentally.
In plastomechanics (the mechanics of plastic deformations), deformations are
treated as relative parameters. Figure 2.13 shows the mechanisms of compression,
tension and shearing.
In literature, two different notations are used for the numerical description of
plastic deformations of the overall shape. The notation used in English-speaking
countries and in material science in general is based on the relative dimensional
change or strain e, with eC for compression and eT for tension.

In plastomechanical calculations for cutting and abrasive processes, the focus is
on the extent of the deformations within the workpiece material. If the following
assumptions are valid, the shear cS can be calculated as the tangent of the
deformation angle v3 (Fig. 2.14):
• shear plane model
• constant volume
• homogeneous workpiece material
• isotropic workpiece material
• two-dimensional deformation.

The volume segment in Fig. 2.14 is parallel to the shear plane, so that the shear
deformation tan v is directly visible. To relate the deformation process to a ref-
erence deformation, we have to determine the relative deformations, the maximum

passed through the shear plane. For this purpose, we use an unsigned volume
element, i. e. a circular element, which is deformed into an ellipse behind the shear
plane (Fig. 2.15).
The ratios of the long axis (2a) and the short axis (2b) to the diameter (2r) of the
circular element correspond to the maximum tension and compression respec-
tively. Thus, the tension and compression are

Figure 2.16 shows the progression of the tension eT and the shear cS across the
shear angle / for a rake angle of c = 0. The shear angle, the tension and the shear
decrease with higher rake angles.
The calculations of deformations and their conversion are only based on geo-
metrical relations. Forming technology usually uses comparative hypotheses to
convert multiaxial deformations and strains into uniaxial reference values
[DOB07, S.153 f]. Tresca uses the shear stress hypothesis for his calculation, while
von Mises uses the strain energy hypothesis. We can also deduce the reference
deformations using an energy approach.
The shear cS in Eq. 2.21 can be converted into the uniaxial reference defor-
mation u. We obtain

Chip Formation

Chapter 3
Chip Control
The chip form is one of the four criteria which determine the machinability (see
Sect. 1.4). An undisturbed chip ﬂow is especially important in automated processes
in order to spare the human operator the tedious and often dangerous task of
monitoring the chip ﬂow (which would tie him to the machine tool and the pro-
cess; man-environment criterion). The problem of chip control does not apply to
processes in which an interrupted cut is inherent to the functional principle
(milling, circular sawing, grinding). In continuous processes like turning and
drilling, the chip control can be dominant compared to the other machinability
criteria, because it has an essential inﬂuence on the process safety. The chip form
is the ﬁnal shape of the chip after the machining process. It is the result of the chip
formation and the chip ﬂow from the material separation zone. To quantify the
chip control, a chip form classiﬁcation and the chip volume ratio have been
introduced [STA90, CIR04].
3.1 Chip Volume Ratio and Chip form Classiﬁcation
Depending on the chip form, the bulk chip volume can be much higher than the
volume of the initial workpiece material. The ratio between the two volumes or
volumetric ﬂow rates is the chip volume ratio RZ
RZ ¼ Qch
QW
ð3:1Þ
It indicates the bulkiness of the chips and is used for the dimensioning of the
machine tool working area, of the open space in the tool to accommodate chips
(ﬂutes in milling and drilling) and of the transport devices for the chips. Depending
on the chip form, the values of the chip volume ratio can vary signiﬁcantly
(Fig. 3.1).
The maximum feasible and most economical cutting speed (see Sect. 7.1) and
the maximum feasible material removal rate have been increased considerably
thanks to enhanced cutting tool materials. On average, an increase by the factor 2

has been achieved each decade. The chip volume ratio tends to decrease with
increasing cutting speeds. For example, the material removal rate in turning pro-
cesses has been increased to such an extent that the chip control can become a
major limiting factor in the process. This is supported by the trend towards
stronger and tougher workpiece materials.
Eight chip form classes have been introduced to characterize the different chip
forms (Fig. 3.1) [STA90]. Each of them relates to different chip volume ratios. Long
chips, like ribbon chips, snarled chips and ﬂat helical chips, are disadvantageous and
can endanger persons, tools, workpieces and the machine tool. Short chips, like
discontinuous chips and spiral chip segments, can cause problems in the transport
from the material separation zone (e.g., in drilling) or if the operator is not adequately
protected (eye injuries). Spiral chips and helical chip segments are most favorable.
To obtain favorable chip forms, the chip has to be broken down to segments.
This can be done by primary chip control or by secondary chip control.
Primary chip control is obtained by discontinuous chip formation. Workpiece

with a low copper content and eutectic or hypereutectic aluminum-silicon alloys, i.e.,
brittle materials with low plastic ductility which already break during the chip for-
mation process. They are called short-chipping materials. With segmented or con-
tinuous chip formation, secondary chip control has to be enforced after the actual chip
formation process. The corresponding materials are called long-chipping materials.
3.2 Chip Guidance
With long-chipping materials, i.e., with continuous or segmented chip formation
and with an adequately high feed, favorable chip forms can be obtained by chip
guidance. The chip is removed from the chip formation zone in its natural direction

Chip Control

of ﬂow. There are two main ﬂow directions, parallel or normal to the rake face; the
ﬂow direction of the chip is determined by the plastomechanical processes at the
cutting edge and can lie between the two main directions (Fig. 3.2). To illustrate
this, Okushima and Minato have developed a simple model which divides the
cross-section of the undeformed chip into a series of increments and adds up the
incremental ﬂow vectors to form a resultant using a link polygon method [OKU59]
(Fig. 3.3). For this purpose, each increment is weighted according to its surface
area. This is a purely graphical method which can only provide an approximation
of the plastomechanical processes. Methods that provide a more realistic image of
the processes are based on FEM calculations [MÜL93]. A further disadvantage of
the Okushima/Minato method is that the link polygon method does not account for
chip guidance by the inclination of the rake face (by the rake angle c and the
wedge angle b). Due to developments in powder metallurgy, especially the rake
face shape on indexable inserts is used to inﬂuence the chip ﬂow direction. By
means of an appropriate rake face shape, the moving chip can be guided towards
the cut workpiece surface, the uncut workpiece surface or the tool ﬂank face
(Fig. 3.4). The consecutive ﬂow of material bends open the chip which has been
stopped by the obstacle. This subjects the chip to additional plastic deformation.
The upper surface of the chip, which has mostly already been notched and jagged
in the chip formation process, is tensioned and thus breaks when the chip is bent
open.
Chips can be guided either by ground-in or sintered-in chip breakers or by
attached breakers which have been integrated into the clamping system of the
indexable insert (Fig. 3.5). Many shapes of sintered-in chip breakers have been
developed. Their geometry has to be adapted to the setting conditions, especially
to the feed, the cutting speed and the depth of cut (Fig. 3.6).

Chip Control

At low feeds, chip control by means of chip guidance is hardly feasible, because
the plastic tension which can be achieved by bending the chip open is not high
enough to break it. Figure 3.7 shows that the tension of the chip edge eR of a bent
chip with a given bend radius r
0 is proportional to the chip thickness h
0. Thus with
thinner chips there are only minor plastic tensions, which the workpiece material
can resist without breaking.
An effect similar to that of an increased chip thickness can be obtained by a
curvature of the chip cross section along the cutting edge (Fig. 3.8). This increases
the strain of the chip edge partially and the chip becomes stiffer, which increases
its tendency to break. Parting-off tools and grooving tools also have bent rake faces
to avoid the chips from being trapped in the groove between the cut faces.

3.3 Inﬂuence of the Workpiece Material
In the chip formation process the workpiece material is subject to high plastic
deformations. The deformability mainly depends on the composition of the
workpiece material. Therefore, the chip control mode (primary or secondary) also
mainly depends on the workpiece material. In general, we distinguish between
short-chipping and long-chipping materials. Lamellar graphite cast iron (gray cast
iron), brittle brass and cast aluminum alloys are examples of short-chipping
materials, which tend towards discontinuous chip formation. Steels, coppers and
wrought aluminum alloys are long-chipping materials.
With steels, the deformability can be inﬂuenced by means of alloying elements
to achieve more favorable chip forms. However, these elements mostly have a
negative effect on the toughness of the steel.
Carbon is the most important accompanying element to iron (Fig. 3.9). Carbon
steels contain ferrite (a-solid solution) and perlite, which is a eutectoid consisting

material structures

Chip Control

of cementite (iron carbide Fe3C) and ferrite. Ferrite is a soft material with good
deformability, while cementite (orthorhombic crystalline) is hard, brittle and
barely deformable. With an increase in the carbon content from [0.2 % C up to
the eutectoid composition (perlite) of 0.8 % C, the deformability of the steel
decreases. Case-hardened steels (\0.2 % C) like C15, 16MnCr5 and 18CrNi8 tend
towards forming ribbon chips and snarled chips. Steels with a higher perlite
content produce more favorable chip forms (Fig. 3.10).
Sulfur is hardly soluble in iron. Depending on the other alloying elements,
sulﬁdes can be produced. Iron sulﬁde forms an eutectic (FeS). Within the tem-
perature range of 800–1,000 C, this makes the material red short. Oxygen
decreases the temperatures of the sulﬁde eutectic and thus increases its tendency
towards red shortness. With manganese, which has a higher chemical afﬁnity to
sulfur than iron, manganese sulﬁde is formed (MnS). Its melting point is higher
than that of FeS. This eliminates the risk of red shortness. Subsequent to the rolling
process, manganese sulﬁdes are elongated and arranged in rows. They form dis-
continuities within the steel structure and so improve the chip form. However, this
also decreases the transverse toughness of the steel. Free cutting steels are alloyed
with high sulfur contents (9S20 or 45S20) of about 0.2 % S. Besides providing
other positive effects on the machinability (wear, forces), this consistently leads to
favorable chip forms. Steels with especially low sulfur contents can be produced
by newly developed steelmaking processes (blowing processes). They lead to
unfavorable chip forms (Fig. 3.11).
Phosphor leads to signiﬁcant phase separation (segregation) within the steel
which can hardly be eliminated by heat treatments. Phosphor increases the ten-
dency towards brittle fracture at room temperature as well as the temper brittle-
ness. Therefore, it is considered as a steel parasite. Depending on the steel grade,

Inﬂuence of the Workpiece Material
43

the content is limited down to 0.05 % P or less. However, due to ferrite embrit-
tlement, phosphor leads to favorable chip forms.
Lead is practically insoluble in iron. The critical points of iron (in the iron-
carbon system) are not affected by lead. Lead submicroscopically attaches itself to
the grain boundaries, leading to short-brittle chips.
A heat treatment of the steel inﬂuences the deformability via the material
structure and thus also has a signiﬁcant effect on the chip formation and chip
control [WIN82, PAT87]. In general, the chip form becomes more favorable with
an increasingly inhomogeneous and coarse-grained workpiece material. With heat-
treated steels (e.g., C45, 42CrMo4, 36CrNiMo4), controlled cooling from the
forging temperature (Fig. 3.12) has a positive effect.1 This treatment saves further
heat treatments (heating for hardening and tempering, truing), in consequence
reducing the costs for the rough part production by forging. It leads to a coarse-
grained structure with perlite grains surrounded by a closed ferrite network
structure. The chip forms are more favorable than those produced with a tempered
or normalized structure. Other heat treatments inﬂuence speciﬁc physical prop-
erties and are not primarily used to enhance the chip control.
Soft annealing (A) of steels with an increased C content or of alloyed steels is
used to decrease the high hardness in order to increase the machinability (forces,
wear). The chip forms become less favorable due to an increase in the ferrite
content.
Normalizing (N) of steels with C contents below 0.9 % leads to a crystalline
transformation of the structure (normalizing temperature slightly above the GOS

Chip Control

line of the iron carbon diagram), leading to ﬁner, more evenly distributed grains.
The process has hardly any inﬂuence on the chip control. If anything, the inﬂuence
is negative.
Quenching (Q) increases the strength of steels by forming martensite in a
hardening process. Subsequent tempering signiﬁcantly decreases the hardness of
the steel, but also makes it tougher. Quenched and tempered steels (high tough-
ness) lead to generally favorable chip forms. With an increase in the tempering
temperature, the strength decreases and the deformability rises. Correspondingly,
the chip forms become less favorable.
3.4 Inﬂuence of the Cutting Conditions
The cutting conditions inﬂuence the chip form through the chip formation (cutting
speed and rake angle) and through secondary effects (secondary chip control: feed
and depth of cut).
The feed inﬂuences the chip compression ratio, i.e., the chip thickness, and thus
the chip deformability (see Sect. 3.2). Therefore, the chip forms highly depend on
the feed (Fig. 3.13). With adequately designed chip breakers, favorable chip forms
can be obtained at high feeds (roughing), but not at low feeds.
The depth of cut only has a minor inﬂuence on the chip form. With high depths
of cut, the chip is less inclined to break when running up against an obstacle.
The cutting speed has an essential inﬂuence on the temperatures in the chip
formation zone due to heat conduction and convection (see Chap. 5). Higher
cutting speeds lead to higher chip formation temperatures. Most steels are more

Inﬂuence of the Workpiece Material
45

deformable at higher temperatures, so that they are less damaged in the chip
formation process. Up to about vc = 400 m/min, higher cutting speeds lead to less
favorable chip forms. With heat-treated steels, the chip formation above this speed
range is irregular, changing between periods of higher and lower plastic defor-
mation. This can lead to signiﬁcant lamellae as well as a ﬁne segmentation of the
chip (adiabatic shear).
The rake angle inﬂuences the shear in the chip formation process. Negative
rake angles lead to high deformations, which cause prior damage to the chip and
thus increase its tendency towards secondary breaking.
A comprehensive inﬂuence analysis (Fig. 3.14) has been conducted by
Nakayama [NAK92]. He links the chip formation process with the chip control via

the shear angle (A), the shear strain (D) and the cold work hardening (G). The
inﬂuence of the workpiece material is represented by the toughness (B), the chip
temperature (C) and the cracks in the chip (E). The shape of the cutting edge (F, H)
and the inﬂuence of the tool wear are also included.
3.5 Questions

the two terms connected?
2. Why is the chip volume ratio an important parameter?
3. Name and describe the most important chip forms. How favorable are they?
4. Which methods of inﬂuencing the chip form do you know? Explain their
advantages and disadvantages.
5. Explain the functioning principle of chip breakers.
6. What effect do the most important accompanying elements to iron have on the
chip control for steel workpieces?
7. Why is a high chip thickness linked with favorable chip forms?
8. What is the effect of crater wear respectively cutting edge wear on the chip

9. In practice, a common chip control method for turning processes is the use of
chip breakers which guide the chip towards an obstacle in its ﬂow direction
and make it break due to the additional stress. In a turning process with the
workpiece material C45, do sintered-in chip breakers (Fig. 3.15a) ensure the
breaking of the chip if we assume that the chip is bent from an initial bending
radius R to R = ? (Fig. 3.15b)? The tool cutting edge angle is j = 90, the
feed f = 0.1 mm, the rake angle c = 10 and the shear angle / = 35

Forces and Powers in Cutting
and Abrasive Processes
Knowledge of the forces and power involved in cutting and abrasive processes is
essential for the design of machine tools, tools, clamping devices and the process
in general. Therefore, several approaches have been developed to predict these
process parameters. These are approaches using
• empirical models based on experimental results
• analytical models based on elementary plastomechanics
• the ﬁnite element method (FEM).
Empirical models can be used to predict forces and powers with adequate
accuracy but within a limited range of validity. Although the determination of the
validity limits generally causes some problems, the parameter calculation based on
this method is largely common in practice because it is easy to handle. However,
close attention must be paid to the question if the model is used within the range of
validity.
Analytical models based on elementary plastomechanics can usually make no
claim to provide exact results in individual cases. However, they express the
relationships between the most important input parameters of a process by means
of equations. These can be used to determine the overall conditions for the process
control, i.e., to carry out a trend analysis.
The ﬁnite element method can be used for a largely exact prediction of forces
and powers—and also of other parameters like displacements, path speeds, strains,
stresses and even temperatures. However, the corresponding modeling of a process
and—depending on the model—the computation can be very complex and time-
consuming. Thanks to very efﬁcient calculation software which reduces the
modeling effort, and thanks to more efﬁcient computers which also reduce the
computation time, FEM is becoming more and more common in industrial
development departments and in scientiﬁc research. However, the results are only
reliable if the material behavior of the workpiece material and the contact con-
ditions between the workpiece and the tool are modeled with adequate accuracy.

4.1 Empirical Models
The initial resistance of the workpiece material against the penetration of the
cutting edge has to be overcome by means of the resultant force Fz. In general, this
resultant force is oriented at a certain angle within the space (Fig. 4.1). Due to
practical reasons, it is divided into several vectors within a rectangular coordinate
system with one axis in the direction of the primary or cutting motion and one in
the direction of the feed motion. Thus, the corresponding forces and powers can be
directly related to the components and drives of the machine tool.
The active force Fa, i.e., the vectorial sum of the cutting force Fc and the feed
force Ff, lies within the working plane (which is spanned between the vectors of
the feed speed and the cutting speed):
~Fa ¼ ~Fc þ ~Ff
ð4:1Þ
The passive force Fp is orthogonal to the active force, thus
~Fz ¼ ~Fa þ ~Fp
ð4:2Þ
The passive force does not contribute to the process power, because there is no
relative movement between the tool and the workpiece in its direction. However,
depending on the stiffness of the components within the ﬂow of forces, it can have
an essential inﬂuence on the deﬂection of the tool and the workpiece and thus on
dimension and form deviations.
The necessary power for the cutting process is the product of the speed com-
ponents and the components of the resultant force in their direction. Thus we
obtain:
Fig. 4.1 Components of the resultant force in turning [ISO3002-4]
50

Forces and Powers in Cutting and Abrasive Processes

cutting power: Pc ¼ Fc  vc
ð4:3Þ
feed power: Pf ¼ Ff  vf
ð4:4Þ
In general:
Fc [ Ff and
vc  vf ;
thus
Pc  Pf
This makes clear that the cutting power and the cutting force are important for
the determination of the necessary drive power of the machine tool. The cutting
force is usually higher than the feed force. As the cutting speed is also higher than
the feed speed, the product of the cutting power and the cutting speed, i.e., the
necessary cutting power, is signiﬁcantly higher than the feed power.
However, the necessary cutting and feed power only play a minor role in the
design of modern machine tools. Machine tool operators call for short downtimes
and so for short acceleration times of the drives. Therefore, the installed accel-
eration power often exceeds the calculated powers Pc and Pf (Eqs. 4.3 and 4.4)
many times over.
The cutting force is usually related to the cross section of the undeformed chip
A = apf (respectively bh) and is then called the speciﬁc cutting force kc;
Fc ¼ kc  A
ð4:5Þ
The cutting force depends on numerous inﬂuences, including
• the workpiece material properties (strength, deformability, ﬂow curve)
• the cutting speed
• the shape of the undeformed chip cross-section (ratio of ap/f respectively b/h)
• the angles at the cutting edge
• the contact conditions between the workpiece and the cutting edge
There are also considerable interdependencies between several of these
parameters and the cutting force. The general functional relationship between the
speciﬁc cutting force and the inﬂuencing parameters is put down as
kc ¼ kc0  W0ðkc0; h; b; c; vc; l. . .Þ
ð4:6Þ
where kc0 is the speciﬁc cutting force for predeﬁned reference values of the
inﬂuencing parameters h, b, c, vc, l etc.; W0 is a dimensionless function used to
include the effects of these inﬂuencing parameters and their interdependencies.
To separate a material volume unit Vw from the workpiece, the cutting energy
Wc has to be performed. The corresponding speciﬁc cutting energy ec is
ec ¼ Wc
Vw
¼ Pc
Qw
¼ Fc  vc
Qw
¼ kc  b  h  vc
b  h  vc
¼ kc
ð4:7Þ
This equation shows that the speciﬁc cutting force kc is an energetic parameter,
which corresponds with its physical deﬁnition. In fact, kc is not a force acting on
the cross section of the undeformed chip, i. e. a stress, but the energy per volume

unit; respectively a power per material removal rate measured in J/mm3. Often, the
dimension N/mm2 is used, but this should not lead to the misinterpretation of ec or
kc being a stress or even a pressure.
kc depends on the shape of the undeformed chip cross section, which is
determined by the undeformed chip parameters h and b respectively the cutting
parameters ap and f (for tools with multiple cutting edges: ap and fz). The fact that
the tool cutting edge angle j is not explicitly included in Eq. 4.6 goes down to an
approach by Kienzle [KIE54] that bases cutting processes on idealized plasto-
mechanical mechanisms.
Figure 4.2 illustrates the approach by O. Kienzle: It shows that the width of the
undeformed chip b is in good approximation proportional to the cutting power,
because the deformation processes in front of the cutting edge do not change with
a change in b as long as b  h and the effects of the chip formation on the external
zone of the free workpiece surface and of the undeformed workpiece material are
negligible. Accordingly, a change of the undeformed chip width b does not affect
the speciﬁc energy. Thus, the undeformed chip width b can be treated as a pro-
portional inﬂuencing parameter to the cutting force. The tool cutting edge angle is
without inﬂuence as far as h and b are used to determine Fc, see Fig. 4.2.
In contrast, the undeformed chip thickness h has an immediate inﬂuence on the
deformation processes. For example, the chip compression ratio changes with the
undeformed chip thickness. This means that the curve of the undeformed chip
thickness is not a straight proportional. In fact, experiments proved that the fac-
tor kc is in good approximation independent from the undeformed chip width b,
but non-linearly dependent to the undeformed chip thickness h, which has been
proven for a wide range of values and for different cutting and abrasive processes
(Fig. 4.3; with logarithmic axes).
The graph of the experimental results in the double logarithmic diagram
(Fig. 4.4) can in good approximation be treated as a ﬁtting straight line (at least for
different sections), so that we can assume a power function1:

e. g. with hx = 0,5 mm, kc1,0.5 = kc1.1 (1/0,5)-mc
The speciﬁc cutting energies for the reference value h = 1 mm and the expo-
nent -mc for common workpiece materials are presented in Table 4.1.
Based on the speciﬁc energy equation according to Kienzle, the basic equation
for the calculation of the cutting power in cutting and abrasive processes can be
put down as:

Using a multiplication approach for W0, we can include further parameters:

ð4:11Þ
The angle at the cutting edge with the most signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
deformation is the rake angle c respectively cr. This means that the power
requirement also depends on the rake angle. For the cutting of steel and cast iron,
Table 4.1 Speciﬁc resultant forces in turning processes (according to Dubbel) [DIN6584,

Forces and Powers in Cutting and Abrasive Processes

experiments proved that within the common range of rake angles, it can be
assumed that the power is in good approximation linearly proportional to the rake
angle (Fig. 4.5).
For Ck 45 steel, we can assume in good approximation:
wc ¼ ð1:11  0:11  c

and for lamellar graphite cast iron:
wc ¼ ð1:03  0:03  c

ð4:13Þ
A comparison of the straight lines in Fig. 4.5 shows that the inﬂuence of the
rake angle on the speciﬁc energy increases with the deformability or the expansion
at failure.
Experiments have also been conducted on the inﬂuence of the cutting speed vc.
The studies on high-speed cutting [BEN03] showed that the power at high cutting
speeds above a certain speed vcc (see also Chap. 9) is in a ﬁrst approximation
proportional to the cutting speed, thus, Wv is constant. With a decreasing cutting
speed, Wv rises. At vc = 0, we assume Wv = Wv0. Figure 4.6 shows a simpliﬁed
inﬂuencing parameter graph across the cutting speed.
These ﬁndings can be used to derive an approximation for the inﬂuence of the
cutting speed:

ð4:14Þ
with the increase of the speciﬁc energy a ¼ wv0
wv1 ;
for vc  vcc: wv ¼ 1
ð4:15Þ
The contact conditions can for instance be affected by different friction con-
ditions. Experiments showed that the inﬂuence of the cutting liquid (emulsion or

mineral oil) is not signiﬁcant, in contrast to the coating of the cutting edges. The
friction coefﬁcient of coated cemented carbide can be completely different from
the coefﬁcient lu of the uncoated material. There is frictional contact between the
workpiece and the tool at the ﬂank face and at the rake face. The predicted
inﬂuence of the frictional contact is
wl ¼ 1 þ ðl=luÞ  R
1 þ R
ð4:16Þ
where R ¼ ec=eU is the ratio of the friction energy to the deformation energy, lu is
the friction coefﬁcient for uncoated materials and l is the lower friction coefﬁcient
for coated materials (see also Chap. 7: cutting tool materials). In literature, the
ratio values lie between R = 0.15 and 0.3. With R = 0.15, wl reaches its maxi-
mum. The inﬂuence on the speciﬁc power is relatively low. It is in the order of
±0.10.
By approximation, Eq. 4.11 can be reduced to the factors wc; wv and wl: The
remaining factor W1 in Eq. 4.11 is negligible because the accuracy of the exper-
imental results is limited anyway.
According to Eq. 4.3, the cutting force can be directly calculated using the
power. It is
Fc ¼ Pc=vc
ð4:17Þ
O. Kienzle initially aimed at determining the cutting force and not the necessary
power for the process. kc has been determined according to Eq. 4.5 as

Kienzle and Victor conducted experiments to evaluate the cutting force using
the setup in Fig. 4.7. The torque is measured by strain gauges, and the cutting force
Fig. 4.6 Inﬂuence of the
cutting speed
56

Forces and Powers in Cutting and Abrasive Processes

is derived from this torque. Today, the components of the resultant force are
mostly measured by piezoelectric sensors.
When subjected to mechanical strain, piezoelectric materials like certain
crystals—e.g., quartz (SiO2)—or ceramics produce electric charge as a result of
elastic deformation. This charge is converted into a voltage signal using appro-
priate ampliﬁers. Frequently used sensors are thin quartz crystal plates that are
either pressure—sensitive or shear—sensitive, depending on their crystallographic
orientation. If three correspondingly oriented plates are positioned and clamped on
top of each other (to measure shear forces by means of friction contact and also
tensile forces by means of the preload), they can be used to measure force com-
ponents within three directions in space. These sensor units have a compact design,
are very stiff and so have a high natural frequency, which is important for dynamic
experiments. In Fig. 4.8, two shear—sensitive quartz plates are arranged above
respectively and below a pressure—sensitive quartz plate. The Kistler Instrumente
AG, Winterthur/Switzerland, which manufactures sensors of this type, states that
the measuring errors due to crosstalk of its products are below 1 % [KIS09].
If four of the units described above are adequately connected (Fig. 4.9), three
force components and up to three torques can be measured. If the presented type of
circuitry is used, the forces can be measured largely independently from their
effective direction, which signiﬁcantly reduces the efforts for measurement and
evaluation.
The circuitry of the four units S1 to S4 (which each measure three force
components Fx, Fy and Fz) leads to the following equations for the global
parameters [KIS09]:

The values can be calculated using a sum calculator (analog) or a digital

torque measurement [KIS09].
4.2 Modeling of the Feed Force and the Passive Force
The two remaining components of the resultant force are primarily relevant for the
design of machine tool units. The feed force Ff can be relevant for the design of
feed drives, although with modern automated machines, the necessarily high
accelerations are mostly dominant compared to the feed forces required by the
process. If we assume linear system performance, the elastic tool and workpiece
deﬂections are proportional to the passive force Fp, which determines the
dimension and shape deviations. While for instance in turning, the generally higher
cutting force leads to second—order deviations,

the passive force leads to ﬁrst—order deviations:

The thrust force Fd is the vectorial sum of the passive force and the feed force:
F!
d ¼ F!
f þ F!
p:
ð4:28Þ
With common setting conditions (h  b; the outer chip cross section does not
inﬂuence the external workpiece zone), the thrust force is orthogonal to the major
cutting edge due to reasons of symmetry. Thus, the ratio of the passive force to the
feed force is
Ff ¼ Fd  sin j

Analogous to the modeling of the cutting force Fc, we can deﬁne power
functions for the feed force and the passive force, however assuming that the

appropriate than in the case of the cutting force.

The principal values and the further progression of the speciﬁc feed forces and

As explained in Sect. 4.1, we can also use other reference values than
h0 = 1 mm and b0 = 1 mm. Eq. 4.8 is applicable in this case.
4.3 Surface Forces at the Cutting Edge
The presented measurement setups can only be used to determine the integral of
the resultant forces. The measurements do not provide information on the surface
forces, i.e., on the distribution of the forces across the contact surfaces. However,
the resultant force is actually transmitted via the rake face and the ﬂank face, and
the forces are distributed across the surfaces. Figure 4.10 shows the distribution
across the rake face and the ﬂank face, assuming a quasiorthogonal cutting pro-
cess. The following methods can be used to measure the surface forces:
• photoelastic study of stresses (cutting edge made of active material)
• variation of the contact surface areas
• separated cutting edges.
The characteristic distributions across the rake face for orthogonal grooving
given in literature [ZOD67, KAT57, UST60] are presented in Fig. 4.11.
Ziebeil uses a separated cutting edge, so that different components of the forces
on the rake face can be measured at different contact lengths CL in the orthogonal
cut [ZIE95]. He assumes that the cutting force is only transmitted via the rake face.
Partial forces in the direction of the cutting force at the ﬂank face are neglected.
Figure 4.12 shows curves of normal stresses at different cutting speeds for an
aluminum alloy.

Forces and Powers in Cutting and Abrasive Processes

An alternative to this complex measurement method for the determination of
partial forces at the rake and ﬂank face is a simple consideration of discrete forces
(Fig. 4.13). This method makes use of common friction laws (e.g., Amonton’s
friction law) which apply for both the ﬂank face and the rake face:
FaT ¼ l  FaN
ð4:35Þ
FcT ¼ l  FcN
ð4:36Þ

61

From the sum of the forces follows
FcN þ FaT ¼ Fc
ð4:37Þ
FaN þ FcT ¼ Fd
ð4:38Þ
Using the measured forces Fc and Ft, the partial normal forces at the rake and
ﬂank face can be determined as
FcN ¼

and
FaN ¼

The tangential partial forces are calculated according to Amonton by inserting
the values into Eqs. 4.35 and 4.36.
Example: for a roughing/ﬁnish turning process, the given values are

l ¼ 0:3 and Ft ¼ 0:7 Fc
The corresponding partial forces are
FcN ¼ 0:9 Fc; FaN ¼ 0:33 Fc or FaN ¼ 0:56 Ft; FcT ¼ 0:27 Fc or FcT ¼ Ft and
FaT ¼ 0:1 Fc
These values are in good approximation equal to those given by Denkena
[DEN92, SPA67].
4.4 Analytical Approaches in Plastomechanics
In plastomechanics, the determination of forces and powers is based on basic
material properties and the general material behavior in plastic deformation pro-
cesses. The basic theory, for which two examples will be presented in the fol-
lowing,
uses
highly
simpliﬁed
models
from
kinematics
(deﬂections
and
deformations) and kinetics (stresses and force actions). These approaches do not
actually provide exact descriptions of forces and powers, but are nonetheless of
value because they describe relevant input and process parameters and their
interdependencies.
4.4.1 Theory by Ernst and Merchant
The theory by Ernst and Merchant [ERN41] is based on the following
assumptions:
• the deformation is two-dimensional (orthogonal cutting)
• the resultant force is transmitted to the cutting edge on a linear contact
orthogonal to the working plane
• Amonton’s friction law applies
• the deformation only takes place in the shear plane (shear plane model)
• the stress on the shear plane is constant.
In Fig. 4.14, the resultant force acting between the tool and the workpiece is
divided into orthogonal components in the form of three right triangles (circum-
circle over Fz, Thales’ theorem). These force components can be used to calculate
the shear stress in the shear plane s/:
s/ ¼ Fz
b  h  cosð/ þ q  cÞ  sin /
ð4:41Þ
4.3

The shear plane is located at the point of the maximum shear stress. The
corresponding shear angle / is calculated by setting the ﬁrst derivation of the
function s/ð/Þ equal to zero:
ds/
d/ ¼ 0
ð4:42Þ
After several conversions,
cosð/ þ q  c þ /Þ ¼ 0
ð4:43Þ
where only values of / \ 90ˆ are feasible. Accordingly, the shear angle relation-
ship according to Ernst and Merchant is:
/ ¼ p
4  q
2 þ c

ð4:44Þ
4.4.2 Hucks’s Theory
Hucks’s theory also bases on the assumptions of orthogonal cutting, the shear
model, Amonton’s friction law (friction coefﬁcient l) and constant shear stress in
the shear plane [HUC54]. Furthermore, he assumes that the chip ﬂow across the
rake face is undisturbed, i.e., that there is no normal stress at the rake face ðrTc ¼
0Þ: Hucks’s determination of the shear angle relationship is based on the rela-
tionships illustrated in Fig. 4.15.

The shear angle can be used to determine the cross section after shear defor-
mation A/ ¼ b  h=sin/: Using the shear stress s/ ¼ smax; we can calculate the
shear force FT/ whereas the known angles / and q can be used to calculate the
resultant force and its components. The shear stress can be determined by basic
plastomechanical experiments [DOE86, ELM04].

4.5 Flow Curves and Constitutive Equations
The stresses required to achieve plastic deformation or ﬂow of a workpiece
material are mostly determined by basic uniaxial experiments (tensile tests or
compression tests), less frequently by torsion tests or by experiments with tech-
nological conditions more similar to those of cutting and abrasive processes
[ALS01]. The yield stress is primarily affected by the temperature, the strain
(tension, compression or shear) and the strain rate. While in forming technology,
e.g., in forging, extrusion or deep drawing processes, it is common to use quasi-
stationary strain rates of up to _u ¼ 50 s1; cutting and abrasive processes work
with strain rates of up to 104 s-1 or even, in high-speed cutting, of up to 106 s-1.
Therefore, the ﬂow curves designed for forming technology analyses cannot be
transferred to cutting and abrasive processes. Flow curves for high speeds can be
found in literature [e.g., TÖH05]. For CK45 N carbon steels, exemplary ﬂow
curves of up to
_u ¼ 5:000 s1; umax ¼ 0:7and hmax ¼ 1:000 C are available.
Figure 4.17 illustrates the inﬂuence of temperatures and strain rates on the yield
stress. Due to dynamic strain hardening, the yield stress of the material increases
signiﬁcantly from 250 to 400 C.
Figure 4.18 shows the yield stress across the strain at temperatures of 300 and
900 C and a strain rate of 5,000 s-1. Expectedly, the yield stress at 900 C is
lower than that at 300 C. It decreases with an increasing strain as the temperature
in the deformation zone rises due to the roughly adiabatic deformation.
For numerical calculations, the relationships between the yield stress, strain
rate, strain and temperature are expressed by complex functions. This is an
Fig. 4.16 Comparison of three shear angle relationships

intricate task because of the interrelationships between the parameters and because
of the irregular progression of the functions. These functions are called constitu-
tive equations or ﬂow laws. They are frequently integrated into commercial pro-
gram systems for the numerical calculation of plastic deformations, like MARK or
Deform. The most commonly used constitutive equation is the one by Johnson/
Cook, particularly because it is relatively simple [JOC85]. El-Magd and Trepp-
mann [ELM04] gives constitutive equations for cutting at high speeds with alu-
minum alloys, steels and titanium.
Flow curves/constitutive equations are used to determine the ﬂow stress or yield
stress kf, i.e., the yield point under uniaxial stress. By means of a yield criterion,
multiaxial normal stresses or shear stresses can be converted into the uniaxial
reference stress kf. Considering energies the ﬁndings can also be used to determine
strains.

4.6 Numerical Theory
The ﬁnite elements method, which will be presented in Chap. 6, can be used to
calculate stresses, forces and temperatures in cutting and abrasive processes.
Because of the numerical approach, complex constitutive equations can be used, as
indicated in Sect. 4.4. Two constitutive equations will be presented by way of
example. The approach by Johnson/Cook already includes a dynamic component:

Forces and Powers in Cutting and Abrasive Processes

The ﬁve parameters are material-speciﬁc and are determined by using a series
of ﬂow curves. e and _e are plastic strain and strain rates; _e0 is the reference strain
rate with _e0 ¼ 1s1; #
 is the speciﬁc temperature with a reference temperature of
#0 ¼ 293 K and the melting point of the workpiece material #m:: For Ck45 N steel,
we have A = 500 MPa, B = 693 MPa, C = 0.0114, n = 0.36, m = 1 and #m ¼
1808 K [JOC83].
The constitutive equation according to El-Magd [ELM04] has a similar struc-
ture. It is especially suitable for the numerical evaluation of cutting and abrasive
processes, because it covers high ranges of strain rates, strains and temperatures.
As mentioned above, the strain rates in cutting and abrasive processes are by two
or three orders of magnitude higher than those in the mostly macroscopic forming
processes in rolling, drawing, thermal cutting or deep drawing. The strains are
within the same order of magnitude and the temperature range of a material
particle throughout the chip formation process varies between room temperature
and 500 C or can even, under special conditions, reach the melting point.
Numerical calculations using FEM are generally also based on the assumption
of an isotropic continuum that is homogenous, at least towards the beginning of the
process. We can also assume that the volume is constant because there is signif-
icant plastic deformation.
According to the constitutive equation, the ﬂow stress kf depends on the strain e;
the strain rate _e and the temperature #: In El-Magd’s equation, it is a product of an
isothermal component riso and a factor Wð#Þ which accounts for the increasingly
adiabatic behavior with an increase in the strain rate:
kf e; _e; #
ð
Þ ¼ riso e; _e; #0

ð4:58Þ
The isothermal ﬂow stress has to be indicated for a speciﬁc reference tem-
perature. A frequently used value is #0 ¼ 273 K: By means of comprehensive
experiments, it can be determined that, in good approximation,
riso e; _e

Þ ¼ K  en  _em þ g_e:

K [MPa] is the material strength; the exponents n and m represent the hardening
dependent on the strain respectively on the strain rate. g ½MPa  s is a viscosity
parameter that makes up the main part of the inﬂuence of the strain rate.
The energy imparted to the process, which is almost completely converted into
heat, is restricted to the chip formation zone. The deformation process is nearly
adiabatic and increasingly so with an increasing cutting speed and a decreasing
thermal conductibility of the workpiece material. The deformation is variably far
from the isothermal state. El-Magd includes this variation by means of the tem-
perature function Wð#Þ:

factor Ax and the exponent l. These parameters have to be determined by means
of experiments for each workpiece material. However, tables with values for
numerous workpiece materials are available [ELM04]. Admittedly, the total
number of eight parameters in the presented constitutive equations leads to time-
consuming and complex procedures, but this can be justiﬁed by the high range of
validity. The parameters for Ck45N steel are K = 1341 MPa, n = 0.17,
m = 0.01, g = 0.0242 MPas, #1 ¼ 1300K; #2 ¼ 700K; Ax ¼ 0:33 and l ¼ 7:
The ﬂow curves determined by El-Magd are presented in Fig. 4.17.
The necessary data for the models by Johnson/Cook and El-Magd are deter-
mined by means of compression or shear tests. An interesting approach for the
ﬂow curve determination was developed by Altan. His basic idea is to adapt the
data acquisition as closely as possible to the process for which the data will be
needed. Therefore, he does not include conventional basic material tests, but uses a
peripheral milling process and derives the parameters for the constitutive equation
from resultant force components measured in a reverse simulation. The start values
(A0, B0, C0, D0, E0, m0 and n0) are determined using the constitutive equation
approach by Johnson/Cook,

kf is determined by means of the measured forces using Oxley’s algorithm
[OXL89]. The procedure is repeated iteratively until the measured forces and the
forces determined by means of the model are in appropriate accordance [ALS01].
In connection with the constitutive equations, FEM can be used to determine
forces and stresses in the chip formation zone. An example is presented in
Fig. 4.19. The reference stresses at speciﬁc moments in the chip formation process
according to von Mises are presented in the left upper part of the Figure. The nodal
points on the continuous lines represent areas of equal stress. In the upper right
part, the forces in the cutting direction are presented across the time or across the
path length due to primary motion after the penetration of the cutting edge into the
workpiece. The lower right part shows the forces at one nodal point across the time
(using the example of the nodal point N in the upper left part of the Figure).
Finally, the force components in the cutting direction (x) and orthogonal to the
cutting direction (y) along the path of nodal points x0 ? xn are presented in the
lower left part of the Figure.
4.7 Powers, Torques and Forces in Drilling
The necessary power input in drilling depends on the shear or deformations and
friction in the process. As described in Sect. 1.5 in drilling from the solid (with a
double edged twist drill), two major cutting edges and two chisel edges each
remove one chip, but with differences in the workpiece material deformation. In
front of the major cutting edges, the chips are similar to those produced in turning

processes. However, they are produced at varying cutting speeds and with varying
rake angles along the cutting edge. The chisel edges have highly negative rake
angles (Figs. 1.14 and 1.15). Towards the center of the drill, the cutting speed
decreases down to zero and the removed material in the form of a chip must be
displaced in the transverse direction (in addition to its movement orthogonal to the
cutting edge) in order to ﬂow off the web of the drill into the ﬂute. The corre-
sponding shear and squeezing processes are more similar to extrusion [SHA84]
than to the free chip formation in turning. The chip formation and displacement
take place under high hydrostatic pressure in front of the cutting edges.
As in the turning process, friction occurs at the rake and ﬂank faces. Addi-
tionally, the margins of the minor ﬂank faces rub against the bore wall, while the
chips formed by the major cutting edges and the chisel edges also rub against the
ﬂutes as well as the bore wall. As a consequence, the forces and moments in
drilling processes are not constant along the drilling depth, but they increase. This
increase is roughly proportional to the drilled depth while the drill point enters the
workpiece and then rises more slowly in accordance with the increasing friction.
The contributions of the major cutting edges and the chisel edges to power,
forces and torques in the process because of shear and friction can by approxi-
mation be determined using the principle of decomposition. For this purpose, the
drilling process is divided into several parts (Fig. 4.20). In the ‘‘free drilling’’
process (B), a tubular workpiece with an outer diameter below the drilling
diameter and an inner diameter above the radius of the drill web is used. Only the
major cutting edges are engaged. The chips can ﬂow off freely. The necessary

cutting power, the torques and the forces in the cutting and feed direction are in
good approximation equal to those in turning (A).
The corresponding cutting power Pch can be determined using the basic Eq. 4.8:

In the drill out process (C), the chips cannot ﬂow off freely. Additional friction
forces occur. By comparing the process to drilling from the solid (D), we can
determine the inﬂuence of the chisel edges. It leads to an additional cutting power
component according to the effect of the chisel edge Pcq, thus
Pc ¼ Pcq þ Pch
ð4:63Þ
However, this decomposition would only be valid if the different parts of the
process were independent from each other, which is strictly speaking, not the case,
e.g., the chips produced by the chisel edges contribute to the chip friction.
The different process power components can be determined by torques mea-
sured in experiments according to Fig. 4.20. Mch is the torque for the engagement
of the major cutting edges, Mcq is that for the chisel edges, and the ratio between
the two is tc = Mch/Mcq. Drilling of C45 steel leads to a measured torque ratio of
about tc = 11. This shows that the contribution of the chisel edge to the cutting
torque and to the cutting power is low. With

Figure 4.21 shows the drill point and the applied forces, which are assumed to
be discrete. The forces are transmitted as surface forces via the contact surfaces in
the form of normal and shear stresses. For the following calculations these stresses
are summarized as linearly distributed loads. Figure 4.22 is a schematic illustration
of these linearly distributed loads, which are composed of the cut load pc and the
feed load pf with the chisel edges and major cutting edges folded into one plane.
The inﬂuence of the radius on the speciﬁc cutting force is low, therefore, x we can
assume that the distributed load is constant within sections of the radii 0 \ r B rq
and rq \ r B ra. Accordingly, the drilling torque is
Mc ¼ 2 

with the load ratio sc = pcq/pch and the radius ratio q = rq/ra. For type N twist

The ﬁrst value in Eq. 4.77 represents the feed force at the chisel edge. The
second value represents the feed force at the major cutting edge. This shows that
the inﬂuence of the chisel edge is of the same order of magnitude as that of the
major cutting edge. Please note that due to wear of the chisel edge and, to a smaller
extent of the major cutting edge, the feed force in drilling from the solid can be
increased by a factor of up to 2. Shortening the chisel edge by means of different
methods (see Fig. 1.16) can reduce the feed force signiﬁcantly, as evident from the
reduction in the cutting edge ratio q in Eq. 4.76.
The speciﬁc feed force at the major cutting edge can be determined using the
Kienzle equation. We obtain

The presented derivations all refer to drilling from the solid. In contrast, for drill

In all derivations presented above, the inﬂuence of the chip and margin friction
(case C in Fig. 4.20) has been neglected. In fact, the drilling torque increases with
the drilling depth by about 10 % per depth of 2 ra. To limit the friction at the
margin and to prevent it from being jammed, twist drills are slightly conical
towards the shank (by 0.2–0.8 % of the drill diameter) to reduce the heating of the
tool during the drilling process.

also valid for milling processes.

Equation 4.84 includes the undeformed chip thickness h that has to be deter-
mined for a milling tool with multiple cutting edges as indicated in Fig. 1.18.
Evidently, in all processes with a varying feed motion angle u (i.e., milling plus
related processes and grinding), the undeformed chip thickness is not constant.
Correspondingly, the instantaneous power and the instantaneous resultant force are
not constant either.
Thus, to determine the average drive power as the minimum value that has to be
supplied at the milling spindle, we have to average the power over the contact arc.
To simplify matters, we assume that the factor kc0 (Eq. 4.8) sufﬁciently accounts
for the inﬂuence of the undeformed chip thickness h on the speciﬁc energy kc, so
that this inﬂuence is negligible in the correction function W0: We obtain:

Equation 4.85 includes an integral which cannot be solved analytically.
Therefore, the average power is most commonly determined by means of the
average chip thickness hm according to Eq. 1.17, which is assumed to be constant
over the penetration angle uc.

However, this is only an approximation because the average was not taken over
the speciﬁc energy, but over the chip thickness. The error resulting from this
approximation can be determined numerically, e.g., using MATLAB. The errors
for an exponent of mc = 0.25 are presented in Fig. 4.23.
e ¼ P

ð4:87Þ
It can be observed that, admittedly, the power determined by the approximative
method is too low (e [ 0), i.e., that the value calculated over the average chip
thickness is below the integral for all combinations of entrance ðuEÞ and ðuAÞ exit
angles, but that this error is by all means very insigniﬁcant.
To determine the necessary drive power for the machine tool, we have to
include the degree of efﬁciency for the drive section and an addition of 15 % to
account for the deviations of the instantaneous power from the calculated average
power.

The average torque that has to be provided at the milling spindle results from
the average cutting power and the angular speed x of the milling spindle as
Mc ¼ 1

ð4:88Þ
For the design of machine tool components, tools and clamping devices, the
focus is not on the average of the torque and the resultant force, but on their
maximum values. Therefore, we do not use the average chip thickness, but its
maximum value. For

However, to determine the total sum of forces acting on the spindle, we have to
include the action of force of all engaged cutting edges.
Because of the rotating tool, measuring the forces applied to the milling cutter
teeth is more difﬁcult than the determination of forces in turning. Frequently, the
resultant force components (Ff, Fp, FfN) between the machine table and the tool are

measurement platform (see Fig. 4.9) [LAP02]. The coordinates then have to be

However, the subtraction of components with high values can lead to an

forces piezoelectrically by means of three three-component load cells, which are

be used for the direct determination of the resultant force components Fc, FcN and

Energy Conversion and Temperature
5.1 Conversion Effects
Mechanical energy is introduced to the cutting process.
Pc ¼ kc  Qw
ð5:1Þ
The power from the feed motion is negligible and not considered here (see
Chap. 4). The mentioned cutting power is converted to thermal or potential energy
by the following physical effects:
• plastic deformation, shearing,
• friction,
• material separation,
• change of material ﬂow,
• residual stresses.
Below, these power fractions are referred to the removal rate or equivalently,
the energy fractions to the removed material volume. In an energy balance the
speciﬁc energy kc equals the sum of the energy fractions of the plastic deformation
k/; of the friction kc; of the material separation kT, of the change of material ﬂow
kM and of the spring energy or the energy by residual stresses kel.
kc ¼ k/ þ kc þ kT þ kM þ kel
ð5:2Þ
The energy components are estimated qualitatively so that their main inﬂuences
are apparent. For this purpose the shear plane model is used, which can be
described analytically. This model postulates that the total plastic deformation
takes place only in the shear plane. With the preconditions described in Sect. 4.4 it
implies that a constant shear stress s/ acts in the shear area A/. The shear power
referring to on the material removal rate is thus,

For the friction fraction only the energy conversion on the rake face is con-
sidered. Amontons’ law is assumed with l ¼ tan q (l: friction coefﬁcient, q:
friction angle). The tangential force, which acts on the rake face according to Sect.
4.4.1 is:

ð5:5Þ
For the material separation, i.e. generating new surfaces, surface energy is
applied. This energy follows from the surface tension T of the removed material
against the surrounding medium. The energy is proportional to the area of the
generated surface. The area related to the unit of time of these surfaces at the chip
and at the workpiece is
_Aw ¼ b  vc
ð5:6Þ
and
_Ach ¼ b  vc

Furthermore, there is an energy fraction from the change of the material ﬂow.
To determine this fraction the chip formation is seen as a pipe ﬂow, which is
deﬂected by the rake face. The impulse on the rake face is then
~FM  Dt ¼ m  D~v/
ð5:9Þ
with the impulse force FM in the direction of the shear speed v/ and the time
increment Dt, the mass m and the density q (attention: q is the density here and not
the friction angle). Thus follows

As a ﬁnal point, the energy fraction has to be estimated, which is stored as
spring energy kel—a consequence of residual stresses. This fraction is stored as
elastic energy (potential energy) in the surface zone of the workpiece as well as in
the chip.
An estimation of the stored maximal energy in the chip and in the workpiece
can be achieved via the yield stress of the material. As a consequence it is simply
assumed that
• the residual stresses cannot exceed the yield stress, because otherwise they are
cut down by plastic ﬂow
• for the load release, Hook’s law is applied and
• the estimation is done for the uniaxial state of stress.
Figure 5.1 shows the stress–strain curve for the uniaxial elastic–plastic state
and the speciﬁc spring energy kel.
The maximal energy stored in the chip and in the surface domain of the
workpiece per volume unit is then

The order of magnitude for the energy fractions shall be determined by a
numerical example for common conditions: Normalized carbon steel is machined
by carbide tools. With that the following parameters are given:
E = 210,000 N/mm2,
q = 7.8 g/cm3,
kf = 2
s/ = 660 N/mm2,
l = 0.2,
T = 40 mN/m
The cutting conditions should be: Qw = 250 cm3/min with vc = 250 m/min,
h = 0.3 mm and b = 3.3 mm

From Eq. 2.9 follows for kh ¼ k

Thus, the following energy fractions can be determined:
k/ = 760 N/mm2,
kc = 658 N/mm2,
kT = 134 9 10-3 N/mm2,
kM = 0.155 N/mm2, kel = 1.4 N/mm2
This energy analysis leads to a numerical result that is approximately 40 %
lower than that for the Kienzle formula (see Kienzle equation in Chap. 4), which is
due to the different approaches. But it can be seen that the fractions kT, kM and kel
for common cutting conditions are by orders of magnitude smaller than the
fractions k/ and kc: However, kT and kM gain weight considerably in ultra-pre-
cision cutting with undeformed chip thicknesses of h & 10 nm or in high speed
cutting with cutting speeds of vc & 104 m/min. Previous investigations by Vier-
egge show results in similar fractions in the order of magnitude (Fig. 5.2).
5.2 Heat Flow
The cutting power, which is transformed by the dominant effects (k/ and kc) is
generally removed by heat. Smaller fractions are stored as elastic energy (potential
energy by residual stresses) in the surface layers of the workpiece and in the chip.

cutting energy [VIE53]

Energy Conversion and Temperature

The removed heat is distributed by the chip, by the workpiece and by the
environment (convection). The heat ﬂux in the environment is low, unless liquid
coolant is applied. The distribution of the heat ﬂuxes is strongly dependent on the
cutting speed (Fig. 5.3).
This is due to the ‘‘solid body convection’’, to the heat removed with the chip
and to the limited heat conduction into the tool and the workpiece. The model in
Fig. 5.4 is applied to estimate the fractions of the heat ﬂux. The heat ﬂux into the
tool is small if the tool is permanently engaged, because of the high temperature
level in the tool. The heat ﬂux into the workpiece is dependent on its heat con-
ductivity and on the relative speed between tool and workpiece, i.e. of the cutting
speed.
The model in Fig. 5.4 is based on the assumption of a stationary process. The
heat source kc Qw is in the chip generating zone. Three ﬂuxes ﬂow from the source
volume q1 into the tool, q2 into the workpiece and q3 into the chip. A fourth ﬂux
into the coolant and the environment is neglected here. The partial ﬂuxes q1 and q2
are based on heat conduction. They follow the general equation
qi ¼ k  Dx  ð1
dÞ  ‘‘1’’  ðh0  hiÞ
ð5:14Þ
where k is the heat conductivity, Dx  ‘‘1’’ the area which the heat ﬂux is lead on to
(the extension perpendicular to the ﬂux shall be ‘‘1’’), with the width of the heated
layer d; the temperatures in the source volume h0 and in the adjoining body hi: The
heat ﬂux with the chip is based on convection, it is
q3 ¼ cp  q  Qw  h0
ð5:15Þ
with cp as heat capacity, q as density and h0 as the temperature of the source
volume, from which the heat ﬂuxes q1 and q2 ﬂow in the adjoining bodies and
whose contact surfaces have the temperatures h1 and h2.
Thus are

ð5:14bÞ
And ﬁnally following from the heat balance
kc  Qw ¼ q1 þ q2 þ q3
ð5:16Þ
Some simpliﬁcations are carried out at this point. With modern cutting mate-
rials the cutting wedges heat up so strongly that there is practically no temperature
gradient between the source volume and the cutting wedge, i.e. h1 ¼ h0 and
q1 = 0. The undeformed cutting width is set for the heated layer, which is an
assumption: Dx2 ¼ kh  h:
So out of Eqs. 5.14 and 5.16 follows
h0 ¼

ð5:17Þ
With practically common data for steel DIN C45N (AISI 1045)
kc = 2,500 N/mm2, vc = 240 m/min, kh = 1.5, cp = 0.465 9 103 J/(kg K),
q = 7.8 g/cm3 and k2 = 50 J/(K m s), d = 0.1h, h = 0.1 mm results
h0 ¼
2; 500  106
3:63  106 þ 1:25  106 ¼ 512 K
ð5:18Þ
that means 512 K higher than environmental temperature.
It can be seen from Eq. 5.18 that the fraction of the total cutting power
kcQw = 1,000 J/s—which ﬂows into the chip by ‘‘solid body convection’’—is
bigger than the ﬂux, which ﬂows into the workpiece. For this example, it is
q3 ¼ cp  q  Qw  h0 ¼ 744 J/s
ð5:19Þ
and accordingly the fraction, which ﬂows into the workpiece q2 = 256 J/s.
However, the assumption of the layer thickness in Eq. 5.14 is very critical. This
value strongly inﬂuences the calculation. Therefore, the consideration can only

give the tendency of the relationship. But the energy partition correlates to Fig. 5.3
(in Fig. 5.3 the related energy is given by u), at least approximately.
5.3 Temperatures of Cutting Wedge and Workpiece
The temperatures in the cutting wedge are essential for the wear. Oxidation and
diffusion, which partly cause the tool wear, are strongly accelerated at higher
temperatures. The temperature distribution in the surface layers of the workpiece is
decisive for surface integrity effects such as changes of hardness, residual stresses
and alterations of the material structure.
5.3.1 Temperature Measurement
Therefore, various temperature measuring methods have been developed, which
nevertheless all have process-speciﬁc disadvantages. Measuring is difﬁcult due to
small dimensions of the heated zone (only tenth of a mm2), high temperatures (ca.
500 C), steep temperature gradients (d /ds [ 500 K/mm), high mechanical load
(more than 1,000 MPa) and high speed of heating up (d /dt C 106 K/s).
Figure 5.5 gives an overview of the currently applied measuring methods.
Following the kind of heat transformation at the measuring device or sensor, it is
possible to distinguish between heat conduction and heat radiation. The different
methods have diverse properties, which make them suitable for different appli-
cations. Table 5.1 gives a comparison of the most important methods under dif-
ferent criteria.
The measurement of electric resistance is based on the effect that the electric
conductivity of a conducting medium or of semiconductors changes with tem-
perature and pressure. Metals (conducting media) change their conductivity almost

if limited temperature or pressure domains are considered, even though the sen-
sitivity to pressure is much less than to temperature.

with the measuring temperature h; the room temperature h20; the measured
resistance R, the resistance at room temperature R20 and the coefﬁcient of resis-
tance for room temperature a20: For larger temperature ranges the coefﬁcient has
to be adapted. The linear dependency is not valid for semiconducting materials
(thermistors).
Basically, all metals can be applied to measuring by resistance. Noble metals
are used to avoid disturbing oxidations, but above all Platinum is applied.
Resistance thermometers based on Platinum can be used up to 900. Commercially
they are available as wire from 0.9 to 4 mm. Their time constants are in the
domain of 2–20 s for these dimensions and because of their size and their large
time constants, such elements are only applied for nearly stationary cutting pro-
cesses. The disadvantage of long time constants can almost be rectiﬁed, if thin
foils or isolated layers are applied as resistance elements; obviously because the
heating time and the time constant depend on the cross section of the heat con-
ducting element.
To determine the temperature distribution in the contact zones between
workpiece material and cutting material sensors in thin ﬁlm technology were
developed [TÖN94]. The thickness of the sensor is 0.2 lm, the width is 20 lm. To
avoid short circuit with the ﬂowing chip the current conducting layers are coated
with a protective Al2O3 layer of 2 lm thickness. It is possible to measure the

temperature distribution over the rake face or the ﬂank by arranging several
resistance elements in a dense pattern during cutting. The measuring principle and
a ready sensor with elements on the rake face are shown in Fig. 5.6.
Thermocouple elements work according to the Seebeck effect. The principle
can be identiﬁed in Fig. 5.7. The bases of the thermo electricity are free movable
electrons, which are able to drop off the surface of a metal, if their kinetic energy is
at least equal to the separating energy. This energy depends on the material.
Electrons pass over, if the surfaces of two materials touch each other closely. Thus,
a contact voltage is generated whose magnitude is temperature dependent. A
thermocouple has two of these touching points. If there is no temperature differ-
ence between these points, these contact voltages even out. If these touching points
have different temperatures, a thermo current ﬂows as a consequence of the thermo
voltage. Its magnitude depends on the circuit resistance as well as on the involved
materials, i.e. workpiece and tool material, and on the temperature difference. For
limited measuring ranges the following thermo voltage is approximately

with k as Seebeck coefﬁcient, which is dependent on the material matching and on
the average working temperature. Typical material combinations are Pt and Pt/Rh
with k = 10 lV/K or NiCr and Ni with 40 lV/K. Some applications of the See-
beck effect are shown in Fig. 5.7.
The single-tool method uses tool and workpiece directly as measuring elements.
Thus, the two materials form the thermocouple. As the Seebeck coefﬁcient of these
metals is unknown, the sensitivity has to be determined by calibration, preferably
in the temperature measuring range. Figure 5.8 shows a conﬁguration in a turning
machine.
The main difﬁculties with the single-tool method is the insulation of the
potential carrying parts conducting the thermo current against the surrounding and
the calibration of the thermocouple [OPI52]. Characteristically the measuring
method used for and according to the single-tool principle, delivers only an
average temperature reading over the contact area. It is not possible to determine
the kind of averaging. Another problem is that the calibration has to be made for
every material combination. So, if new work material is investigated or if another
cutting material is applied, the system has to be newly calibrated respectively.
The calibration necessity of every material combination and the problems of
conducting the thermo voltage from the rotating part, have led to the development
of the two-tool method. This means cutting with two tools of different cutting
materials and under equal conditions Between the two tools, which is the ther-
mocouple, the thermo voltage is measured. Further variants of the thermo electric
principle work with discrete thermocouples, which are built into the tool (Fig. 5.9)
or the workpiece. It is also possible to place isolated wires in the workpiece. The
wire then represents the thermocouple together with the chip or the workpiece. The
deﬁned positioning of the thermocouple makes it possible to determine the tem-
perature distribution ﬁeld in the tool or the workpiece.

Energy Conversion and Temperature

The phenomenon that almost all materials change their structure with deﬁned
temperatures and by that, also their physical and chemical properties is the basis of
further temperature measuring methods (structure conversion). The energy, which
is necessary for these structural alterations, is taken from or given to the envi-
ronment. Thus, temperatures have to affect certain time durations onto the mate-
rials to ensure reproducible values by the energy transport. Normally, short time
temperature changes are not sufﬁciently captured and consequently, these mea-
surements are limited to stationary temperature ﬁelds. Temperature sensitive
colors, liquid crystals and thermo graphic chalks are available commercially. In
the meantime, these transformable materials have been developed for a tempera-
ture range up to 2,000 C [DAV07].
The energy radiated by a body is a measure of its temperature (heat radiation).
According to Planck’s law the radiated power per unit of area depends on the
wavelength of the radiation k and the temperature of the radiating surface. A
‘‘black body’’ radiates the energy per unit of area and per wavelength ESk,
according to Wien’s law (Fig. 5.10):
ESk ¼ r  h4
ð5:23Þ
In Eq. 5.23 r = 5.67 9 10-8 W/m2 K4 is the radiation coefﬁcient. Real bodies
emit less power than a black body. That means the emission parameter e has to be
taken into account:
E ¼ e  ESk
ð5:24Þ
The difﬁculty is ﬁnding out the emission parameter, which has to be known for
all bodies participating in the process.
Radiation thermometers are known as pyrometers. With a total radiation
thermometer, the maximum radiation power over a large receiving cone is
received in addition to the overall wavelengths. They can be applied to a wide
range of temperatures varying between 200 C and up to 1,800 C. Band radiation
thermometers receive radiation only over a deﬁned range of wavelengths. They are
often applied to temperature measurements for cutting processes, because they are

the turning tool

easy to handle. Quotient thermometers receive radiations of two wavelengths and
are thus able to eliminate the inﬂuence of the material dependent emission
parameter with the help of setting the quotient of the received radiation energies
and thus cancelling down the emission parameter. This implies that the emission
parameter is independent of the wavelength. However, by using only two wave-
lengths the radiation energy is small and thus the sensitivity of the measurement is
limited. This method is also used for temperature measurements of cutting
processes.
The principle of typical radiation thermometers is shown in Fig. 5.11. Such
temperature measurements have several advantages. The measurement is very
fast—it takes 1–10 ls depending on the device. The possible measuring range is
large. It lies between 300 and 3,500 C. The measuring object is not inﬂuenced
and temperatures of moving objects can also be determined. It is a disadvantage,
however, that the emission parameter depends on the material, on its surface
structure, on the received wavelength and on the temperature itself.
Nowadays, infrared detectors (photo-resistance (photoresistance with an upper
cut-off wavelength) are often used as radiation receivers. Figure 5.12 schemati-
cally shows a measuring device for infrared thermography.
It is possible to get moving pictures during cutting with the help of this method.
Figure 5.13 is an infrared thermo-gram of the band chip generation during the
orthogonal turning of AISI 1045 (DIN C45E). In 1933, Schwerd and Kramer from
Hannover had already made the ﬁrst measurements using this method to determine
temperature ﬁelds when cutting [SCH33]. It is possible to overcome the problem
of the temperature dependency of emission parameters with pointwise measure-
ments, if the possible error is eliminated by calibration [DEN92].

5.3.2 Temperature Fields
With the method shown in Fig. 5.12 temperatures on the rake face of a tool can be
measured in interrupted cutting. It is possible to calculate the rake face tempera-
ture with sufﬁcient accuracy from the cooling curves and by using a model of
transient temperature distribution when the tool leaves the workpiece. Figure 5.14
shows temperature–time curves for turning processes with different ceramic cut-
ting materials. Depending on the heat conductivity different exit temperatures are
calculated.
The extension of the heated zone, as well as the temperature distribution in this
domain and the temperature maximum are dependent on the properties of the
cutting material, on the cutting conditions and due to different chip formation
mechanisms, on the workpiece material. A distribution according to Fig. 5.15

results with an Al2O3/ZrO2-ceramic tool on grey cast iron. The temperature
maximum is in the middle of the contact zone between tool and workpiece.
The inﬂuence of cutting speed and feed on the rake face temperature of different
cutting ceramics can be seen in Fig. 5.15 for cast iron and in Fig. 5.16 for steel.
The diagrams show that temperatures increase with the cutting speed and the feed.
For the dispersion ceramic (Al2O3/ZrO2) the temperature grows by an average of
100 K for 200 m/min up to 800 m/min speed difference, by 150 K for 0.1 mm up
to 0.32 mm feed difference.
For the mixed ceramic and the Silicon–Nitride ceramic the temperatures are
considerably lower as already shown in Fig. 5.13.
The comparison of grey cast iron with temperable steel shows a temperature
increase of 50–100 K dependent on the process parameters, which can be seen in

Figs. 5.16 and 5.17. The temperature raise for Si3N4-ceramic is remarkable, which
is an explanation why this kind of ceramic is not suitable for steel. Very high wear
rates follow the high thermal loading.
The temperature distribution on the minor ﬂank face of the tool could be taken
by an IR-camera [BAR88]. The minor ﬂank face is always visible, so there is
sufﬁcient time to take a total image (Fig. 5.18). The inﬂuence of cutting speed of
feed and of workpiece material on the temperature ﬁeld at the minor ﬂank face can
be taken from Fig. 5.19. When comparing Figs. 5.17 and 5.19, it has to be
observed that feeds are different.

the major cutting edge, was determined by introducing thermocouples in the holes
of the tool [KUE56].
The highest temperatures are generated on the rake face of a cutting wedge, as
can be seen in Fig. 5.20. This is caused by friction between rake face and chip.
Since these temperatures are of great importance for the wear behavior of the tool,
an analytical estimation is introduced, which shall show the most important
inﬂuencing variables [BAE94; BEN03].
The cutting wedge is considered as a unidirectional inﬁnite body. According to
Baehr, the temperature of the rake face hc is

5.4 Optimization of the Cutting Wedge
The wedges of cutting tools have to be matched with the speciﬁc application. This is
particularly true for the angles of the wedge. The consideration of the solid angle X,
which is formed by the rake face, the major and the minor ﬂank face, gives an
indication for the optimization of the cutting wedge (Fig. 5.22). For thermal and
mechanical reasons, this solid angle is to be maximized so as to obtain a robust and
stable cutting edge, which in addition, rapidly dissipates the heat from the cutting
wedge via the wide solid angle and thus decreases the temperature level of the tool.
A large solid angle X is reached by decreasing the rake angle c, the ﬂank (clearance)
angle a and the cutting edge angle j and by increasing the tool included angle e,
respectively. But there are limits by counter-directional inﬂuences:
Fig. 5.21 Rake face temperature and cutting speed (acc. Ben Amor)
100
5
Energy Conversion and Temperature

• rake angle c: decreasing c increases the forces and the necessary power.
• ﬂank (clearance) angle a: a should not fall below a minimum value of
amin = 5–6, otherwise the friction forces at the ﬂank increase considerably
and leads to higher power, which means higher temperatures in the tool due to
the same reason.
• cutting edge angle j: j is usually chosen no lower than 45—apart from
increasing passive forces—the power determining cutting force gets higher for
the same cutting cross section, because the undeformed chip thickness
decreases.
• tool included angle e: e should be as large as possible with the application
conditioned cutting edge position. The minor cutting edge angle jN may not fall
below a minimum value, because of cutting stability to prevent chatter.
These limit considerations show, that a cutting wedge can be optimized
according to its application (roughing or ﬁnishing, continuous or interrupted cut,
predominantly thermal or mechanical load). Thus representing a compromise
between favorable heat ﬂux and large mechanical load capacity, a great variety of
producible workpiece is shaped with the help of a small tool included angle e and
low friction load by enough ﬂank (clearance) angle a and minor ﬂank angle aN.

Modeling and Simulation
The use of simulations in the ﬁeld of machining is generally based on the com-
bination of numerical methods or on the algorithmic geometry with the manu-
facturing processes, which are dealt with in this book. Therefore, not only the input
data of the simulation, but also and especially the underlying models are crucial for
the value and the expressiveness of the simulation.
On the other hand, the computer aided methods offer the possibility to calculate
data in many variations and in speeds and resolutions, which would be unthinkable
without them. The resulting consequences are opportunities for new models, which
avoid previously necessary simpliﬁcations and therefore have a considerably
increased signiﬁcance. It should not be forgotten however, that despite the striking
and illustrative moving pictures simulations always imitate reality—based on the
view of reality ﬁltered by the models. Before a conclusion on the basis of simu-
lation results, it is therefore necessary to examine the applicability of the used
models to each situation and to verify it, if necessary, by means of real experi-
ments. So, the target of a simulation must always be to apply and to understand a
model by the systematic running through numerous variants.
When executing a simulation, one has to distinguish between the time repre-
sented by the simulation—the simulation time—and the time actually required for
the necessary calculations—the real time. These times are identical only in the
rarest cases. If one examines, for example, how much material in one rotation of a
milling cutter with a speed of 6.000 min-1 is removed, the simulation time for this
is a one-hundredth second, regardless of what real time has passed in the
meantime.
Two essential approaches are followed in the ﬁeld of simulation of machining
processes, which differ in their objectives and their degrees of detailing. Geometric
simulation of material removal or kinematic simulation determines the shape of
the removed area on the workpiece in discrete time steps and from this, the
particular shape of the workpiece. Modern systems of computer aided process
planning (Computer Aided Manufacturing, CAM) often contain simple variants of
such simulations to visualize and to check the planned machining processes. In
addition, specialized, commercial systems are offered to provide virtual images of

machine tools including kinematics, control and simulation of material removal.
The objective of these systems is also the visualization and veriﬁcation of process
planning to date. In more recent times however, the determined geometric infor-
mation is more frequently used to calculate technological quantities, such as
process forces or temperatures.
The kinematic simulation distinguishes itself through the ability to map com-
plex tool and workpiece shapes and is also able to model complicated movements
of the components involved.
In contrast, the numerical simulation of machining processes is based on the
Finite Element Method (FEM) or the Molecular Dynamics (MD). These
approaches consider the operations in a much more detailed way, but cover a much
smaller time interval and a smaller geometric range because of this. At this, the
calculation for a single cutting pass may take up to several days. It is obvious that
the choice of an appropriate simulation approach depends on the objective of the
desired research. Thus, for any kind of application one must proceed according to
the principle: as detailed as necessary but with as little effort as possible.
6.1 Kinematic Simulation
Geometric models of workpiece and tool as well as the description of the per-
formed movement are prerequisite to pattern the removal of material on the
workpiece by a computer. Appropriate formats to describe the form of the
involved components can be found in the area of Computer Aided Design
(CAD). In fact, these formats are already used in the planning of the machining
processes by means of CAM and are suitable as input data for the simulation. It is
an obvious method to pattern the shape of a machined work piece in a simulation,
to modify the existing CAD model of the workpiece in the initial state by the
continuous application of geometric cutting operations with the tool and to adjust
it to the progress of the machining process. Basically, this can be done through the
same mechanisms used in the CAD. But in most cases it makes sense to use a
customized model on the objective. Here, the simulation time is divided into
intervals that are considered only approximately, but are short enough to look at
the respective change precisely enough. Since only the state at the beginning and
the end of the time interval is considered for the calculation, we talk about time
steps or time discretization.
Two essential criteria for the suitability of a model for a speciﬁc application are
the expected calculation time and the memory consumption. Subsequently, it is not
the absolute magnitude for a concrete simulation which is important, but the
performance of the model with a growing degree of detailing. Depending on the
model, the necessary storage requirement may grow by eight times by decreasing
the maximal error to half (doubling in each space direction) or not increase at all.
The same applies to the required computation time.

Modeling and Simulation

Direct interactive input or the existing NC code for programming the machine
can be used for the description of movements, depending on the complexity.
Within the simulation this format is transformed into the resulting movement of
the tool relative to the workpiece. Both the model of the workpiece as of the tool
consist of points, edges, faces and bodies, each described related to a local
coordinate system. For cutters, the zero point is usually set to the top, with ori-
entation of the Z axis along the rotation axis and is called tool coordinate system.
The local coordinate system of the workpiece is called workpiece coordinate
system. To describe the position of a component it is sufﬁcient to set the position
and orientation of the local coordinate system (Fig. 6.1). This is done by a spatial
transformation matrix that describes the image of each point or vector in the target
coordinate system. To represent a movement, such a matrix is set for each time t.
In case the NC program for the machine tool is used as input data, a mathe-
matical model of the machine kinematics and a replica of the machine control must
be used to calculate the actual motion to calculate the transformation matrix. The
task of the machine control is to implement the described movements in the real
machine. To work around the thus occurring physical restrictions, it is necessary to
make modiﬁcations to the trajectories. A sudden change of direction is replaced,
for example, with ﬁllets, because the acceleration of the physical machine axes is
limited. In addition, a machine deviates from the ideal path because of compli-
ances and vibrations. The investigation of these deviations is often the target of the
performed simulations. The more inﬂuences have to be patterned, the higher the
necessary effort. Moreover, the objective of kinematic simulation is often focused

on the use of the results in other simulations that mimic the behavior of the
machine [WEI08, DEN06]. At this point, however, only the functionality of the
calculations of the workpiece shape at every moment is to be described. Therefore,
a given description of the motion function is assumed below.
To describe the spatial shape of tool and workpiece a suitable computer internal
format is necessary, a so-called volume model. Regardless of the numerous data
formats known from CAD, the methods of representation can be divided into three
classes. Volumetric models apply small, easy-to-describe, contiguous, but not
intersecting cells to combine these to a comprehensive model. In connection
models, spatial objects such as spheres, cuboids, cylinders etc., which can be
described by formulas, are combined by Boolean operations, i.e. by aggregation,
penetration, or difference of the respective enclosed subset of the Cartesian space.
In the boundary representation model (B–Rep), the objects are described by the
enclosing and adjacent surfaces [STR06]. These can be complex parameterized
surfaces as well as a large number of triangles. For the simulation of material
removal, different partly specialized variants of these classes are considered, which
shall be described below.
6.1.1 Representation of the Workpiece
Before commenting on the representation of the requirements of the workpiece, a
look should be taken at the requirements from the user’s perspective. The
requirements depend—as already mentioned—on the objectives of the planned
investigations. Therefore, the following questions, according to which the models
need to be evaluated, must be asked before selecting a model.
1. What accuracy is the shape of the workpiece to be determined with? The
answer to this question inﬂuences not only the choice of the model as such—
but using an approximated shape—the number of elements or the resolution of
elements as well. Depending on the application, it can be sufﬁcient to meet only
a statement of the moment of contact between workpiece and tool or—on the
other hand—to calculate the exact surface with high resolution. Higher accu-
racy typically results in a higher demand for disk space and adversely affects
the speed of the simulation.
2. Is the entire workpiece or only a detail considered? Sometimes not the
machining of the whole workpiece is of interest. Furthermore, possibly only
one side of the workpiece has to be analyzed with high accuracy.
3. What time resolution and what time interval will be investigated? As already
with the delineation of the kinematic simulation against FEM and MD, this
question plays a role here as well. In general, a higher time resolution results in
a longer calculation time. The memory requirement for the model does not
increase, but more output data is generated.
108

Modeling and Simulation

4. What real time has the simulation been performed in? It is to be checked
whether there are time restrictions for the duration of the calculations. This is
especially the case for simulations, which run parallel to the real process to get
additional information or to interfere by feedback control. In simulations for
checking purposes of NC programs, it is naturally desirable to wait for the
result only as shortly as possible.
5. What kind of motion of the tool is expected and what does that mean for the
generated shape? A 3-axis milling process is limited in most cases from the
outset on the surface of one side of a box. Choosing a suitable model can
improve the value of the simulation or reduces the consumption of resources.
The same applies to many processes that are composed of translational and
rotatory movements. In particular, this can mean that the workpiece is rota-
tionally symmetrical, at least in ideal shape, for example, in a turning or cir-
cular grinding process.
6. How shall the resulting geometric data be further processed? Depending on the
aim of a geometrical simulation and speciﬁc processes different information
shall be identiﬁed. This can be, for example, forces, temperatures, etc. The
input data for the used technological calculations must be generated as simply
as possible and with little losses from the simulation results. Under certain
circumstances, they should be input data for other simulations. Conversely, the
results of other simulations are the input data for the applied material removal
model. For some applications, even a continuous exchange between different
simulation systems is carried out to illustrate dynamic effects. The data
exchange then heavily inﬂuences the choice of workpiece model.
6.1.1.1 Voxel Models
A voxel model is the simplest form of a volumetric representation of spatial objects.
It is similar to bitmap formats for graphics. A discrete image of the workpiece is
generated by three dimensional elements of small cuboids (building blocks)
(Fig. 6.2). The blocks are called Voxel, an artiﬁcial word for volume element
(in some references also volumetric pixel). Since a voxel has only two states, that is
to say ‘‘material existing’’ and ‘‘no material existing’’, it requires only one bit of
memory. The location of a voxel is deﬁned by the position in a three-dimensional
matrix. At best, the accuracy of a voxel is given by the smallest mesh spacing and at
worst by the length of the space diagonal of the voxel. As three-dimensional data
ﬁelds are used, the memory requirement increases to third power, i.e. in doubling
the resolution of any main direction the eightfold amount of memory is required.
Thus, for a cube of 200 mm edge length and a mesh spacing of 0.1 mm a storage
allocation of 1 Gigabyte is needed (2,0003 Bit). The huge storage consumption of
the voxel model can be weakened by a ﬂexible variation of the resolution in
different domains of the workpiece—for example by a so called octree structure—
though this signiﬁcantly increases the complexity of the calculations.

Overall, it is worth noting that voxel models are quickly applicable due to their
simplicity and reach a very high computational speed at low resolutions. However,
with an increasing number of voxels this procedure quickly reaches its limits.
6.1.1.2 Dexel Models
A very similar approach to the voxel model, the so called dexel model, represents
the particular height of the top and the bottom of the workpiece on a two-
dimensional matrix of equidistant, discrete X and Y positions. The resulting small
rods at the matrix position are called dexel (depth element) [WEI02]. This is
graphically similar to rectangular-arranged parallel pins on a board that are cut by
the process (Fig. 6.3).
There is no material, so apparently not a pin for the case that the height values
for both sides are identical.

voxel model

block
110

Modeling and Simulation

The limitation of one dexel per position results in a constraint of the repre-
sentability of any spatial object. In the direction of the dexels, no gap in the
material is allowed. This can be avoided by an extension with a locally variable
number of dexels, however it leads to higher memory consumption and a more
complex data structure.
Compared with voxel models dexel models have the advantage that the memory
requirements grow only by the second power. In addition, the accuracy in the dexel
direction is much higher, because the height values can be represented with
ﬂoating point accuracy instead of integer values. Any point on a surface approx-
imately perpendicular to the direction of the pins can be very accurately deter-
mined by interpolation between the height values of adjacent grid points. But if the
considered direction is on the level of the grid matrix, no higher accuracy is
reached than by the voxel model. For a generally applicable material removal
model it is not satisfying, if the computational accuracy relies strongly on the
considered direction. This difﬁculty can be avoided by building up a speciﬁc dexel
ﬁeld for each main axis of the Cartesian workpiece coordinate system. However,
this approach has the disadvantage that for further processing, for example, for
visualization, three redundant data sets must be combined to a total model, a
procedure which is quite elaborate.
The storage requirement of the example already used with the voxel model of a
cube with 2,000 elements per direction is—implying single ﬂoating point accuracy
(32 bits) in the three spatial directions—at 2,0002 elements à 192 bits, which
results in 96 Mb. Even with a more complex representation of the dexel and for
this magnitude of workpiece and this resolution, a considerable lower memory
requirement is to be expected than with the voxel model.
6.1.1.3 Polyhedron Model
Polyhedron models belong to the group of boundary surface models, i.e. a body is
completely described by its surface. In the case of the polyhedral model, this
surface consists only of ﬂat polygons (facets), covering the surface to be repre-
sented with a maximal deviation, which has to be speciﬁed in advance (Fig. 6.4).
To insure a consistent function the surface has to be closed, i.e. must not have
openings or gaps.
Explained descriptively, this means that the described area is ‘‘waterproof’’. To
achieve this, the data structure for the model is often built as a hierarchical tree of
bodies, surfaces, edges and nodal points. A surface is described within this tree by
references to the boundary edges. These consist of references to start and end
nodes. With multiple references to common elements, the risk of gaps is reduced
and the testability of consistency of the model is eased. Two adjacent surfaces, for
example, reference the same edge. To simplify graphic representations and the
computer operations with the described bodies a normal vector is assigned to any
surface, which points out of the body.
6.1
Kinematic Simulation
111

Cut operations between bodies can be reduced in the polyhedral model to a
number of cut operations between the facets of both bodies in contact. Separated
by the traverses of the two surfaces of the bodies, four or more shell fragments are
generated, which are joined according to the operation to the resulting body. In
practical use, one often does without polyhedrons with more than three corners or
sides respectively. This reduces the number of different conﬁgurations to be dis-
tinguished while intersecting. Elements with more corners can easily be decom-
posed into triangles.
The computational accuracy of the polyhedron model depends on the accuracy
of the approximation. To carry out cutting operations it is somewhat difﬁcult to
identify two identical points as such, since identical coordinates do not exist—only
two very close values because of calculation errors. This is avoided by introducing
a threshold value, which deﬁnes two points below a minimal distance as being
identical. However, for unfavorable conﬁgurations inconsistent data may occur,
which have to be avoided either by case discrimination or corrected after sub-
sequent review.
The computational time required for a cutting operation depends on the number
of faces of the participating bodies. A doubling of the number of surfaces qua-
druples the number of necessary comparisons. The memory requirement is not
directly predictable as is the case with the volumetric models. The example of the
cube with an edge length of 200 mm can easily be represented as a polyhedron
model—a cube is actually already described by the six sides with polyhedrons,
namely squares. Only diagonals in the sides must be inserted for a representation
with triangular surfaces. The resulting representation of the cube is in every
respect mathematically correct and without errors and always requires the same
memory space, regardless of the size of the cube. The more complex the shape of a
workpiece, the larger the number of ﬂats necessary. With this, a disadvantage of
the polyhedron model becomes evident. By using each intersection operation with
the tool normally more polyhedrons are added than removed. So the memory
requirement grows with the progression of the simulation. The beneﬁt of this
approach is that locally very different accuracies can be created according to the
needs in different areas of the workpiece.

6.1.1.4 CSG Models (Constraint Solid Geometry)
CSG models [WEI08] are formed by applying set operations on a basic set of
simply describable spatial elements, the so called primitives, and are thus part of
the link models. In contrast to the previously described models, the intersection
operation is not carried out at the time of deﬁnition but the used bodies and
operations are stored (Fig. 6.5). The data storage is carried out as a binary tree,
whose leaves are formed by the individual primitives and its nodes by the
respective set operation. In this structure, a cutting operation is very easy to add, as
occurs in machining processes. In addition, the resulting shape of the workpiece is
described exactly and analytically, depending on the accuracy of representation of
the basic elements. During further processing, for example, for the graphical
visualization or for the calculation of process variables, the tree of operations must
however be analyzed again each time and converted into another model, because
CSG models are only suitable for direct usage to a very limited extent. The cube,
which has already been used as an example several times, creates a tree with a
single node in the CSG model.
The tree grows with the number of operations. By that, the memory requirement
and the calculation time grow for further evaluation. The storage of the cutting
operation itself, however, can take place very quickly.

6.1.1.5 Level Curve Model
Another model based on boundary representation is the level curve model
(Fig. 6.6) [DEN07]. Similar to the depiction of landscape surveys in maps the
workpiece is usually sliced with parallel planes, commonly parallel to one of the
coordinate planes, and the intersection line is stored as a two-dimensional model.
The intersectional line can be created either as polygon with appropriate con-
straint for the maximum deviation or as analytic description by parametric curves.
In the case of polygonal lines one obtains a special case of a polygon model,
because the nodal points of adjacent planes easily add to triangles. To intersect
the represented workpiece with a tool it is sufﬁcient to determine the section of
the tool in the respective plane and to intersect the resulting section line with the
respective level curve. This operation can be carried out much more easily than
with the general polyhedron model since it is a two-dimensional intersection
operation.
Another advantage of the level curve model is the lower effort for the reusing of
the results. The volume removed during one time step is split into elements by the
planes, which are limited by parallel planes in one direction, which simpliﬁes
further calculations.
6.1.2 Tool Model
Each of the described models for the workpiece is designed to be modiﬁed by a
suitable model of the tool by geometric intersection operations. The model applied
for the tool is not necessarily built up in the same way as the workpiece. In fact, it
is of beneﬁt to use a speciﬁc tool model, depending on the situation which is
adapted on machining the workpiece model.
At this, it has to be especially observed that using a workpiece model with
analytically described shape the advantage of high accuracy is nulliﬁed by
Fig. 6.6 Level curve model
114

Modeling and Simulation

discretized tool models. As a whole, it is necessary to adapt the accuracy of the
tool model on the accuracy of the workpiece representation. The same applies to
the choice of the temporal resolution.
Still it is often useful to make simpliﬁcations for the tool model depending on
the objective of the simulation. For most applications with rotating tools it is
sufﬁcient to look at the tool body resulting from the rotation as the movement of
individual cutting edges is not considered in the time steps of the simulation.
Therefore, CAD models of the real tool with a detailed representation of the
discrete cutting edges are not applied. Instead, the tools are often speciﬁed via the
contour curve of the rotational body. A representation with seven parameters is
shown in ISO3592, which most of the milling tools can be speciﬁed by [ISO3592].
Despite the reduction of the tools on their rotational body, the rotational
direction and speed or the concrete shape of the cutting edges can incidentally be
reconsidered for the evaluation of the results.
Regardless of the used format or the level of detail of the tool model, for the
intersection of the workpiece model not the tool model at a speciﬁc moment has to
be considered but the space passed through by the tool—the trace—even at very
high temporal resolving discretization. Therefore, a so-called swept volume has to
be created from the tool model and the data of the applied movement by a further
operation. This is especially not trivial for tool motions, which are combined by
translational and rotational motions. However, for many models algorithms
already exist, which can produce trace volumes.
Another important consideration when choosing a suitable tool model is the
convexity. In the calculation of intersections between tool and workpiece, most of
the procedures consider only the visible area of the tool surface from different
views and make the intersection by this tool model. If there are undercuts in the
considered view, i.e. the ray in line of the view would penetrate the material more
than once, the hidden domain would not be recognized. This case can occur, for
example, when grinding with a proﬁled grinding wheel (Fig. 6.7), with cup wheels
or for the detailed examination of milling processes including speciﬁc cutting
edges. Not only because of this, it is important to be familiar with the functionality
of the models and the respective algorithms for the design of a kinematic
simulation.
6.1.3 Determination of Process Values
So far it has been described how the shape of the removed material can be
determined for a predeﬁned time interval on the basis of purely geometric con-
siderations. The input data of the analytical methods, as described in previous
chapters contain no detailed information of the shape of the removed material, but
have to make generalizations. In contrast, the simulation offers the possibility to
determine a representation of the actual shape of the material removed per time
step. On the one hand, this requires the obtained data to be processed for further
6.1
Kinematic Simulation
115

use and on the other hand, this offers the possibility to get a much more detailed
picture of the ongoing process by integrating knowledge of other process
parameters.
Some of the most important geometric input data in cutting are the cross section
of the undeformed chip, the contact area between tool and workpiece and the
removed volume per time unit. Especially for variable engagement conditions, the
considered domain can be divided into smaller parts so as to be able to determine
these values with higher precision. The different procedures for the calculation of
other parameters, such as process forces, can then be applied separately, each with
adapted parameters in the partial domains. As a consequence the parameters
varying locally in practice such as the cutting speed, can be taken into better
account.
As an example of an application to determine the shape of the undeformed chip
cross section, a coupling of the calculated forces to a simulation of dynamic
vibration behavior of the used machine tool shall be discussed. The objective is to
simulate the stability behavior for the groove milling and to determine the inﬂu-
ence on the workpiece surface by this effect. Due to the process force action the
tool is deﬂected and pushed aside, which again inﬂuences the engagement of the
tool and leads to varying forces. In connection with the vibration behavior of the
machine dynamic effects are caused, which appear as irregularities on the surface
of the workpiece.
To determine the forces under the varying engagement conditions purely
analytic considerations are not sufﬁcient. Also, a simpliﬁcation of the material
removal process by a mere intersection of the rotational body of the tool with the
workpiece does not deliver a sufﬁcient temporal resolution of the force course. In
fact, it is necessary to include the position of the speciﬁc cutting edges of the cutter
into the simulation and to compute the force course for the rotating tool. Figure 6.8

shows the material removal of two cutting edges of a torus milling cutter. The
domains machined by both edges are colored differently to illustrate the areas
processed by the two cutting edges.
To calculate the cutting forces for the process conditions of each time step, the
geometric shape of the machined range is ﬁrst determined from the used part
model. It corresponds to the intersection of the trace body of the tool from the start
to the end position of the current time step with the shape of the workpiece before
the start time. It should be noted that each time interval contains an interval in the
rotational movement of the milling cutter too. The time steps have to be taken
small enough to be able to neglect the chord error resulting from building the trace
body. In the application, a maximum increment of 10 of the tool rotation has
proved to be suitable.
In the next step, the cross section of the undeformed chip is determined from
the resulting volume element. The hereby relevant information for each particular
point is the position in the reference system stretched from the milling cutter axis
and the radius. Therefore, a projection of the body is taken in the space of the
cylinder coordinates of these axes on the plane spanned by the radius and the tool
axis.
The so resulting surface is decomposed into partial areas and for these the
respective part of the force components are calculated (see Chap. 4).1 The sum of
the fractions results in the force component to be determined (Fig. 6.9).
Another application example, where less the cross section but rather the contact
area between tool and workpiece plays a decisive role, is the adjustment of
Fig. 6.8 Simulation of the material removal of single inserts in the rotating tool system

determine the forces. See also [ALT00].

grinding processes for the manufacturing of milling cutters and drills of tungsten
carbide [DEN08]. The ﬂute in the workpiece—in this case the milling cutter or the
drill—are produced by a proﬁled grinding wheel, which moves on several helix
trajectories around the cylindrical workpiece (Fig. 6.10). Due to the hard material
and the aimed high metal removal rate high process forces arise. This results in
deviations of the set shape—as in the ﬁrst example—in this case, however, by
deﬂection of the workpiece. If the kind and size of this deﬂection is known, the
error can be compensated by adapting the depth of the wheel.
The analytical view on geometric input values (see Sect. 12.7) ascribes
grinding processes to surface grinding by transforming the individual values to

equivalent ones. For example, the equivalent radius req or the equivalent chip
thickness heq.
For this purpose, a generalization is made by replacing the actually locally
varying values with average quantities. Since the axis of the grinding wheel is
skewed against the feed direction, not only the cutting speed but also the contact
length and the chip thickness vary over the contact area. Thus follows a non-
uniform force distribution, which inﬂuences the deﬂection of the workpiece over
time and position. An investigation by geometric simulation delivers the necessary
data for a detailed consideration. For the evaluation the (not plane) contact area
determined in the simulation is broken down into smaller fractions.
The removed volume in the speciﬁcally viewed time interval is assigned to each
partial area by the calculated shape of the removed domain as determined in the
ﬁrst example. From this, the equivalent chip thickness heq and the equivalent chip
width beq and the equivalent cross section Aeq = beq  heq can be determined
respectively. These quantities are used for each partial area as input value for the
calculation of the forces so as to obtain the normal stresses on the contact areas
(Fig. 6.11).
With this distribution as input for a simulation of the deﬂection of the work-
piece much more precise information about the defection can be derived. If the
computation of the forces is coupled to a suitable model, dynamic effects can be
patterned—similar to the ﬁrst example [DEI10].
6.2 Numerical Simulation by FEM
With the upcoming of powerful computers simulations based on numerical cal-
culations have become possible. All of them are also based on models, which
represent the real behavior of the system to be analyzed only in abstractions
(Fig. 6.12). However, one is more independent in the choice of the included
effects—subject to the effort—than using the closed analytical methods. But it
should be realized: these numerical simulations also have to be veriﬁed in
experiments. The occasionally used term ‘‘numerical experiment’’ is therefore
mistaken.

Among the numerical methods the Method of Finite Elements has been intro-
duced in many ﬁelds of mechanics, thermodynamics and especially in continuum
mechanics, as well as in the mechanics of large plastic deformations and for some
years, also in cutting theory [STR90, MEI88].
FEM simulations are based on two fundamental principles, on the Lagrange-
and the Euler-formulation. The Lagrange-formulation can be further distinguished
into the implicit and the explicit mode. Simulations of cutting processes are run
chieﬂy two dimensionally because of the high computing time. This approach
corresponds to the orthogonal cutting.
A difﬁculty in the simulation of the cutting process after Lagrange is to pattern
the extreme strain at the cutting edge. Two ways have been developed:.
In the implicit Lagrange’s formulation (ILF), a parting line d is introduced
(Fig. 6.13). A separation of the FE net is allowed only on this parting line. Chip and
workpiece are represented by their own nets, which are connected until the actual
separation by linking elements. The separation path is set as a parallel line to the
workpiece surface on the height of the tool tip. Each linking element consists of two
nodal points, which have the same coordinates, since the original length d is equal

to zero. They have two states, the connection or the separation. These states are
each subject to the distance D between the tool tip and the next element of the
separation line. If D reaches a predeﬁned value or less than that, the element is
dissolved and chip and workpiece are separated. With the progression of the tool
with cutting speed vc the chip continues to be formed. The procedure of chip
generation is considered purely geometrically. The inﬂuence of the cutting speed is
hereby neglected. Initially, purely geometric sizes were adopted also in determining
the timing of the network separation. Only later, material speciﬁc parameters
(for instance maximal strain) were used as a separation criterion [LIN93].
In the explicit Lagrange’s formulation (ELF), the equations of motion are
integrated directly and explicitly. No global stiffness matrix is used in contrast to
the implicit methods, where the FEM solution via the stiffness matrix is achieved.
The stresses are directly calculated in the integration from the element stresses
after each single time step. The advantage of this formulation is that no separation
line has to be deﬁned. To ﬁnd the location of material separation in the model the
maximal stresses are compared with a maximum value in a dedicated routine at
every nodal point of the FE net—when this value is exceeded a separation by
doubling the nodal points is carried out. Here, it becomes obvious that the strain
energy density is a realistic criterion for the nodal point separation [MEI88].
The third possibility of simulation is a consideration according to the Euler-
formulation, in which the structure to be investigated is viewed as a controlled
volume. In this approach, the nodal points are stationary and not ﬁxed to the
physical material of the investigated structure. This has the advantage that the net
can be intensely reﬁned at the tool tip, where the highest stress and strain gradients
occur as is necessary for a sufﬁcient accuracy. It is important that there is no
separation criterion in the Euler formulation in this method, since the stresses and
velocities in the workpiece are calculated as a function of the spatial position and
not as a function of the individual material particle. Given that the chip geometry
in the Euler’s representation is not known from the beginning and the material
properties are partly dependent on the strain rate and on the changing temperature,
the equations for the cutting model have to be solved iteratively [STR90]
(Fig. 6.14).

A comparison of the different formulations shows:
Properties of the Euler formulation:
• visco-plastic ﬂow process,
• no separation criterion necessary,
• forces and temperatures at the contact of tool-workpiece are realistically
represented,
• a locally ﬁxed net is applied, whose boundaries have to be known in advance,
• only stationary processes can be represented, i.e. no lamination or shear
localizations,
• there are no extreme distortions in the cutting edge domain so that a constant
computation mesh can be used.
Properties of the Lagrange formulation:
• elastic–plastic starting procedure,
• separation criterion necessary,
• at the cutting edge, extreme distortions of the net occur, which make remeshing
necessary,
• chip geometry during or immediately after the chip generation results from the
simulation and does not need to be provided in advance,
• transient processes can be patterned, i.e. the simulation is not limited to pure
chip ﬂow processes. This is especially interesting for shear localizations at chip
compression or for the representation of segmented processes and variable cross
section of undeformed chips,
• Lagrange simulations are considerably more complex than Euler computations
because of the necessary remeshing and the link to material spots. However,
they offer the chance to recognize material inhomogeneities in the ﬁrst place,
which is interesting especially in micro domains.
Most of the FE models described in literature are based on the Lagrange-
formulation. Combinations of Lagrange and Euler formulations have been
developed, which want to combine the advantages of both kinds of calculation
[STR90].
During the FE analysis, considerable deformations of the net structure occur.
Geometrically heavily distorted elements have a low quality of results and can lead
to an interruption of the calculation, if the Jacobi determinant of the displacement
vector becomes negative [MAR98]. Especially in the contact domain, where
generally large deformations take place, state variables may adopt unrealistic
values because of the element distortions. Thus, wrongly larger state variables are
obtained by these analyses with a distorted net than by using repeated remeshing.
Therefore, for a realistic process simulation a robust automatic remeshing pro-
cedure is essential, which generates a new net according to predeﬁned criteria
without intervention of the user.
There are several FEM programs applicable to chip building simulations. From
among these, the following programs are often applied: SFTC/Deform, MSC/
Superform, Thirdwave AdvantEdge and ABAQUS. SFTC/Deform and MSC/
122
6
Modeling and Simulation

Superform are FEM programs to solve metal forming problems. ABAQUS is a
FEM program to handle structure–mechanical, thermodynamic or acoustic prob-
lems. The above mentioned programs have to be adapted to cutting simulations.
Third wave AdvantEdge was speciﬁcally conﬁgured for cutting simulations. The
mentioned programs are based on the Lagrange’s approach. They differ in software
architecture, in programming and the use of different algorithms for the remeshing
of strongly distorted material domains.
A characteristic problem of the simulation of chip building, which does not
exist for metal forming problems, is the material separation. It is different in
Lagrange’s approaches:
• either the separation takes place alongside the element edges also providing the
direction of separation by precisely these edges,
• or elements are removed from the net.
The example demonstrates the application of the FEM for chip formation
processes, i.e. the deformations or the chip formation kinematic. Figure 6.15
shows the snapshot of a chip root simulated by FEM. A special advantage of the
FEM is that by this method it is also possible to compute stress distributions and
with that contact stresses, force and power requirements, heat ﬂuxes, temperature
distributions and in appropriate modeling, also alterations of surface layers, i.e.
surface integrity effects.
6.3 Molecular Dynamic Modeling
The previously mentioned considerations were made phenomenologically on
isotropic and homogeneous material. In the meantime, it has become possible to
handle deformation and also wear problems on molecular or atomic basis
(molecular dynamics (MD), minimum potential simulation (MPT)) [IKA92]. The

interactions of atoms or molecules are modeled. Thus, mechanical and thermal
states of an atomic lattice can be patterned.
Figure 6.16 shows the general concept of chip modeling by the MD method
[REN95], Obviously, orthogonal cutting is assumed, which is indispensable for
two-dimensional analyses. The material properties, the interactions between the
components, the contact and interface conditions between cutting wedge, tool and
chip, as well as the environmental properties have to be deﬁned in the model.
Furthermore, the boundary conditions inside the model (surface to the base
material) and the system boundaries to the not-modeled surrounding are of
interest. The core of the MD method is the particle-to-particle interaction. This
interaction is described by the potential energy between the particles. Figure 6.17
shows the potential energy as a function of the atomic spacing and derivation for
the distance. Rentsch points out that the pair function cannot represent technical
metals properly. For this, models based on multi-body interactions are needed,
which cannot be addressed in detail here [REN09].

Modeling and Simulation

Cutting needs a relative motion between tool and workpiece, speciﬁed by the
cutting speed vc, which has to be introduced into the model. Furthermore, forces
and moments introduced by the contact areas between tool and workpiece have to
be supported by appropriate responses to avoid non-realistic movements of the
system. Normally, the deformation process in front of the cutting edge is of
interest. To limit the complexity the tool is mostly taken as rigid. In principle
however, appropriate partial models can also be introduced to enable the simu-
lation of wear caused by friction and thermal effects. Since energy is transformed
into heat in the process, the temperature of the material increases. To maintain
realistic conditions in the chip forming zone temperature controlling atoms are
placed at the boundaries of the modeled body.
From the above it becomes obvious that these simulation calculations are very
time consuming. Therefore, only limited sizes of volume or area can be modeled
and simulated respectively. On the other hand, the volume must be large enough to
keep artifacts negligible from the sides of the boundaries and as a consequence of
elastic effects (Fig. 6.18).
However, with greater computing power this type of modeling can include the
potential to pattern realistic scenarios of cutting. It is also interesting that
approaches are pursued to combine MD models with FE models [HEI09].
Thereby, a part based on atomic view, considering local elastic and plastic
deformations is complemented. A surrounding FE part takes care of elastic pro-
cesses as it is indeed the case in the reality of cutting with a fading effect in the
further surrounding of the effective point.
In any case, it was possible to show [REN09] that already today, the MD
method is able to give interesting details on the deformation process in front of the
cutting edge, on the thermal processes in the cutting zone and on the stress dis-
tribution in the workpiece material in micro machining in the nanometer regime of
a crystalline material.

Chapter 7
Wear
7.1 Wear Forms
Cutting tools wear during operation. Typical wear forms develop at the cutting
wedge. These wear phenomena depend on the materials of tool and workpiece and on
the cutting conditions. The mechanisms of wear (also called wear causes) have to be
distinguished from the wear forms. Thus, the following chain of effects results:
loading ! wear mechanisms ! wear forms:
The most important wear forms are shown in Fig. 7.1 together with the
parameters which describe them quantitatively.
Flank wear develops at the major and minor ﬂank of the tool. The just gen-
erated cut surfaces of the workpiece slide at these wear faces. Signiﬁcant marks are
formed. Their extension in cutting direction is called width of ﬂank wear land VB.
Since different ﬂank wear marks may form alongside the cutting edge, one dis-
tinguishes wear at the corner rounding VBC (maximum value at the corner
rounding, C for corner), VBB (average value) at the straight part of the cutting edge
and VBmax as maximum heights and VBN (N for notch) with the formation of a
notch (notch wear) at the end of the active cutting edge in the area of interaction
with the uncut surface.
The ﬂank wear is normally monotonic. The volume removed from the cutting
wedge VT referred to the cutting edge length, depends on the clearance angle of the
tool a (assuming constant wear development alongside the cutting edge) as
follows:
VT ¼ 1
2 VB2 tan a
ð7:1Þ
A small clearance angle a causes a stable cutting wedge. However, a small
clearance angle enlarges the friction area and so intensiﬁes the friction effect
between the tool and the workpiece. Generally, a clearance angle is indispensable,
because otherwise the tool would only push and not be able to cut. From the
hodographs in Fig. 7.2 follows

For kinematic reasons the clearance angle a has to be greater than the effective
cutting speed angle g0. However, this consideration does not yet regard any elastic
deformations of the effective pair (i.e., tool and workpiece). Therefore, the
clearance angles are in practice by 4 greater than calculated, according to the
above relation.
Figure 7.3 shows that the ﬂank wear increases at very small clearance angles
due to the increasing friction, but this occurs also for higher loading and a large
clearance angle because the cutting wedge is then weakened.

Wear

It is interesting that you can reach a signiﬁcant reduction of wear in the initial
phase by only a small reset of the ﬂank according to Fig. 7.4 [DEN08]. In addition,
the contact length between ﬂank and workpiece is kept nearly constant over a
certain cutting time. This is important, for example, for hard machining as this
inﬂuences the passive force and the residual stress state in the surface layer of the
workpiece (for this, see also Chaps. 10 and 11).
The crater wear forms as a crater of removal of tool material on the rake face
(Figs. 7.1 and 7.5). It is described by the crater depth KT or the crater ratio
K = KT/KM as a quotient of crater depth and crater center distance KM. The crater
ratio is a measure of the weakening of the crater lip which could result in the risk
of it breaking out.
Further wear phenomena such as plastic deformation of the cutting wedge,
formation of cracks, slate-like wear and fracture are discussed with the wear
mechanisms.

7.2 Loading
The active parts of cutting tools- the cutting wedges- are mechanically, thermally
and chemically loaded (Fig. 7.6). This loading may be temporally constant
(turning in continuous cut or drilling). The loading for milling or turning in
interrupted cut is transient, i.e., temporally changing.
The mechanical loading of the cutting wedge follows from the introduction of
forces via the contact areas on the rake face and the major and minor ﬂank faces.
The so caused stresses may be computed, for instance, by the method of ﬁnite
elements (FEM). Prerequisite is that the distribution of surface forces on the
contact areas is known. From measurements and analytical calculations generally

only the global force components can be speciﬁed, whose vectorial sum is the
resultant force and the surface forces (distribution of contact stresses) are difﬁcult
to determine (Sect. 4.5).
The procedure of calculation and the necessary assumptions shall be explained
by the example of a milling process [DEN92]. From the resultant force or its
components taken in a measuring coordinate system, the force components
referred to the cutting wedge, i.e., the force components acting normally and
tangentially on the contact areas have to be calculated. This is carried out by the
values and angles shown in Fig. 7.7 by a coordinate transformation.
ðFx; Fy; FzÞT ¼ TFS  ðFc; FcN; FpÞT
ð7:3Þ
where TFS is the transformation matrix, which contains the trigonometric functions
of the tool angles j, ca and cr. The forces for milling of steel AISI 1045
(DIN Ck45N) with a ceramic cutting tool change with the engagement angle u as
illustrated in Fig. 7.8. From the thus determined components the fractions acting
on the rake and ﬂank faces have to be derived (Sect. 4.7). For this purpose the
investigations of Spaans [SPA67] can be applied, who determined the following
partial components for the ﬂank Fa

Fcx ¼ 0:6  Fx
The force shares transmitted over the minor cutting edges are negligible in
roughing-ﬁnishing conditions.
Now, the distribution of discrete normal and tangential forces on the contact
surfaces has to be determined according to Chap. 4. The width of the contact

surface corresponds to the width of cut b; the contact length in direction of the chip
ﬂow is about 2.5 times the undeformed chip thickness h. However, the contact
length can double towards the end of the tool life [DEN92]. Therefore, an
experimental determination by means of the contact imprint at the cutting wedge is
recommended. Hence, the surface stresses are derived which have to be known as
boundary conditions for a FEM calculation.
Figure 7.9 shows the main stresses on the basis of selected points of the insert
based on the load given in Fig. 7.8. The calculated stresses are not critical for the
investigated cutting material, but once the force increases, for example due to
wear, the stresses could reach critical values.

Wear

The thermal loading of a cutting wedge can also be determined by FEM if
the heat ﬂux, which enters the cutting wedge and its distribution are known. The
power transformed at the cutting edge leads to heat ﬂuxes via the chip, the
workpiece, the tool and the environment. The cutting wedge is permanently in
the heat ﬂux—different from the other three elements. Consequently, the tem-
perature rises considerably and steep temperature gradients are generated depen-
dent on the thermo-physical properties of the tool material. To determine them the
following assumptions and steps are necessary:
• The supplied mechanical power is almost totally transformed into heat.
• The fraction of heat dissipated via the tool is only 5–20 %. Knowledge about
this is consequently critical for the determination of thermal stresses.
• From the heat ﬂux, which goes through the contact surface of the cutting wedge,
temperature distributions can be determined, for instance by the ﬁnite elements
method. Prerequisite for this is the knowledge of the thermo-physical data and
of the heat dissipation via the tool surface into the environment and into the tool
holder. The measurement of the temperature distribution was dealt with in Chap.
5. Due to the difﬁcult data situation, one generally cannot do without
measurements.
• The thermal stresses in turn can be calculated by FEM from the temperature
distribution knowing the thermal expansion coefﬁcient and the elastic constants.
Thermal stresses have to be superimposed to the stresses resulting from
mechanical loads. As far as there is no plastic ﬂow or cracks nor nonlinear effects,
mechanical and thermal stresses can be added. Figure 7.10 shows temperature and
stress distributions by thermal load of a ceramic insert.
Fig. 7.10 Temperature and stress distribution perpendicular to the major cutting edge [DEN92]
7.2
Loading
135

The transient case is of particular interest for thermal stresses, because it can
lead to stress inversions due to the temperature alternation. In Fig. 7.11, the
contact temperature by milling is shown for a point on the rake face. After a short
time, alternating heating and cooling phases lead to an increase of the average
temperature until a steady state has been reached. For the considered point on the
rake face the stress curves of a heating and cooling period follow (Fig. 7.12).
The main stress r3 is proportional to the tool temperature. During the heating
phase its value increases depressively to the stress maximum at the end of this
phase, then the value decreases exponentially according to the temperature
characteristic.

Wear

The other main stress r1 is signiﬁcantly different. During the total heating phase
the stress value remains nearly constant. With the beginning of the cooling phase,
the stress value changes from compression to tension, where the stress maximum
r1 = 90 MPa lies about 4 ms behind the beginning of the cooling. The correlation
of the normal and main stresses shows that r3 basically corresponds to rzz,
whereas r1 corresponds to rxx [DEN92].
For the development and selection of cutting tool materials the inﬂuence of the
thermal constants such as the heat capacity cp, the heat conductivity k and the
temperature diffusivity a or the density q respectively are of interest. With the
example of one-dimensional heat conduction, when a rod with the cross section
A is thermally loaded at its front face by the heat ﬂux Q0, the temperature inside
the rod can be estimated as follows:

with the surface temperature 00,1 and the temperature inside the rod #k;1. Fig-
ure 7.13 shows the surface temperature over the temperature diffusivity a, where
in one case k is varied (qcp = const.) and in the other case qcp is variable
(k = const.).
The heat transport is accelerated by increasing the heat conductivity k; the
surface stresses are reduced. The heat capacity qcp is a measure of the imple-
mentation of heat in temperature. An increase of the heat capacity therefore also
causes temperature reduction [DEN92].

7.3 Wear Mechanisms
Depending on the load and its temporal characteristic, different wear causes with
different wear mechanisms appear (Fig. 7.14).
Abrasion occurs due to sliding between the active partners through hard con-
stituents of the work material (Fig. 7.15) [VIE70]. It is a purely mechanical pro-
cess, comparable to micro cutting (micro ﬁling): This process is supported by high
surface temperatures of the cutting wedge on the rake and ﬂank face and the linked
softening of the cutting material. Under the effect of normal and shear forces,

Wear

softer parts of cutting material are taken away. A ﬁne ﬁnished surface of cutting
the wedge can become rougher with the operating time. Its micro geometry affects
the wear progress only initially, later there is no inﬂuence.
Adhesive wear occurs, if particles of the cutting material are transported to the
chip or to the cut face of the workpiece by adhesion, i.e., by atomic boundary
forces at micro contact spots. Adhesion in cutting is supported by the fact that the
faces of the cutting wedge are kept free from passivized layers by a permanent
passing-by of material, which itself is of high purity because it is in statu nascendi.
Basically, two mechanisms of adhesive wear can be distinguished:
• It comes to cold welding (pressure welding) on the cutting wedge. The thus
formed deposits are later disrupted—after further growth—out of the cutting
material, which means material loss or wear.
• Particles of cutting material weld directly with the cut face and the bottom of the
chip and are thereby separated.
Both of these effects decrease with higher sliding speed, i.e., with the cutting
speed.
Tribo-chemical wear in cutting results by diffusion. With growing temperature
of the material the movability of its atoms and molecules increases. Thermally
activated migration of constituents of the cutting material into the work material or
migration in the opposite direction can occur. Chemical reactions of the immi-
grated particles with the cutting material or the separation of constituents can
cause the development of soft layers, which are removed. During the cutting of
carbon steel by tungsten carbide tools, consisting of WC and Co, the following
reactions take place:
• Fe diffuses into the bindery phase Co. It comes to the formation of Fe-Co-mixed
crystals.
• Co migrates off the tungsten carbide towards the Fe and forms mixed crystals.
• C migrates from the steel via the cobalt phase into the cutting material and leads
to the decomposition of the WC by forming softer iron-tungsten-mixed carbides.
A further cause of tribo-chemical wear is oxidation. It can occur at the edges of
the contact zones, if the surface temperature and the tendency of oxidation are high
enough. As illustrated in Fig. 7.16, the oxidation wear is negligible for stellites due
to a low tendency to oxidation and for not alloyed tool steels and high speed tool
steel because of softening even at low temperatures.
Schematically, the importance of the different types of wear mechanisms on the
total wear in steel cutting depending on the cutting speed and thus on the cutting
temperature is shown in Fig. 7.17.
The partition of the different types of wear mechanisms cannot be generally
indicated. Depending on the matching of work material—tool material and
depending on the cutting edge temperature and cutting speed, the one or the other
type can be dominant.
Cracks occur especially under transient cutting edge loading. Parallel cracks
(lateral cracks) and cracks perpendicular (normal cracks) to the cutting edge can be
7.3

139

distinguished (Fig. 7.18). Normal cracks often occur with regular distances. They
are called comb cracks and are of thermal origin [BAR88].
For these cracks, elastic or—depending on the deformability—elastic–plastic
mechanisms can be dominant. Perpendicular to the rake face, a sloping tempera-
ture characteristic occurs (Fig. 7.19). By cooling from the outside the temperature
near the cooled surface decreases, ﬁnally resulting in tension thermal residual
stresses. If plastic compression (e \ 0) takes place during cutting, tensile stresses
in the surface follow after cooling. Both effects can lead to cracks. The regularity
of the comb cracks follows from the fact that the critical tensile stresses of volume
changes are dependent on distance.
7.4 Tool Life
Tool life is the time T, during which a tool cuts from the ﬁrst cut up to the
achievement of a previously set wear limit under given conditions.

Wear

The tool life of a tool depends on the tool material-work material matching, on
the machining conditions, under which the tool is applied and on the cutting wedge
geometry. Different tool life criteria are applied to assess the temporal alteration of
the tool and to determine the end of the tool life.
The appropriate effort to determine the tool life criterion is dependent on the
type of operation and on the batch size to be machined. Generally the following
applies:
• large batch production ) test for the given conditions
• piece or small batch production ) empirical values.
Maximum values for the size of ﬂank wear land are given in Table 7.1. For the
crater wear the following critical values are generally assumed:
crater depth:
KTtol = 1.0–1.5 mm
crater ratio:
Ktol = 0.4

cutting edge

Tool Life
141

However, the tolerable crater depth according to ISO3685 depends on the set
feed.
Tool life times refer to a certain criterion, for instance TVB04 means a tool life
time up to a ﬂank wear land of VB = 0.4 mm. The typical temporal development
of the ﬂank wear is shown in Fig. 7.20.
On the one hand, the wear depends on ﬁxed or optimized parameters which are
generally no longer inﬂuenced during the operation:
• cutting material,
• work material,
• tool geometry,
• cutting ﬂuid, dynamic behavior of tool, workpiece and machine,
• and, on the other hand, on parameters to be set:
• cutting speed vc,
• feed f,
• cutting depth ap.
The cutting speed has the strongest inﬂuence on continuously progressing wear
such as ﬂank and crater wear. Similar but differently steep wear curves over
cutting time are plotted in Fig. 7.21. At the tool life criterion, the tool life times
assigned to each cutting speed can be metered [TAY07].
F.W. Taylor (USA, 1856–1915) detected an exponential correlation between
cutting speed and tool life for a given criterion as ﬂank wear VBtol or crater wear

with T0 = 1 min and the Taylor coefﬁcient C (related cutting speed for 1 min of
tool life). The relationship is generally written as a numerical value equation:
vc ¼ T1=k
ð7:7Þ
This equation can be plotted as a straight line in double logarithmic coordinates.
These lines are called ‘‘Taylor lines’’ (Fig. 7.22). The constants k and C may be
taken from tables (Table 7.2)
The slope of the straight line indicates the sensitivity of a tool material-work
material combination against cutting speed increase. The width of the scattering
band allows to conclude on the reliability of the tool life or respectively the
probability of the tool life criterion happening (see Sect. 7.5). Thereby, the ﬂank
face or the crater wear may be critical depending on the tool material-work
material combination and on the machining conditions. If both wear forms occur,
the wear of ﬂank face generally determines the tool life in the lower speed domain,
whereas the crater wear determines in the higher speed range. The Taylor line for
the wear of the ﬂank face is shallower than for the crater wear.
Figure 7.23 indicates the inﬂuence of the work material on the position of the
Taylor line. Higher strength reduces the tool life as the comparison of globular cast
iron EN-GJS-700-2 and EN-GJS-600-3 shows. On the other hand, the composition
and the structure have a decisive impact, which can be taken from the Taylor lines
of globular cast iron EN-GJS-700-2 and micro alloyed steel 49MnVS3 of equal
strength.

Tool life and cutting speed may be optimized according to economic aspects.
Optimizing criteria may be:
• minimum machining time,
• minimum costs per piece or,
• minimum period costs.
The optimum of machining time, of machining costs or of period costs follows
from opposed time or cost fractions related to the tool (increasing with vc) on the
one hand and the machine occupancy (decreasing with vc) on the other hand
(Fig. 7.24). For the piece cost optimization the following applies:

The cutting speed for minimum period costs vc,Popt lies between vc,Copt and
vc,topt. The minimum period costs result from an optimization of piece time and
piece costs. The following relationships between the different criteria of optimized
cutting speeds exist (Table 7.3).
In a weak economic situation, it is reasonable to reduce the cutting speed in
order to minimize the tool costs since the machine is not fully exploited anyway.

So other cost fractions such as the energy costs also decrease. Yet it has to be
observed that this may lead to a possible increase in staff costs.
A cost optimum is reached by minimizing the tool change time and the tool
costs per tool life. This strategy is generally followed in balanced markets. The
illustrated relationship cannot simply be generalized, especially if a cost com-
parison with geometrically complex tools is concerned. In Fig. 7.25, the direct cost
comparison between two different turning tools is shown. The cutting insert
technology enabled a decrease of costs.
Beside the cutting speed, the set feed also inﬂuences the tool life although in a
far less sensitive way. The feed, however, may not be freely chosen for many
applications, for example, if the surface roughness is required.
7.5 Tool Life Scatter and Process Reliability
In operational practice, it must be noted that the wear development and thus the
tool life underlies heavy scattering, even if work materials of the same standard
designation are machined with the same tools under identical cutting conditions
[VOS76]. The causes are ﬂuctuations of the input parameters (Fig. 7.26).
The set values as input parameters are generally kept constant in narrow limits,
if the same machine is applied. Important disturbing quantities are geometric

The tool life is thus a random variable. Experiments showed that this variable

The tool life line, whose position is described by Cl, means a reliability of

Wear

the melting procedure, the forming processes and the heat treatment (Fig. 7.28)
[VIE70, WIN83]. The inﬂuences on the wear are illustrated by examples of
hypereutectoid and low alloyed carbon steel.
7.6.1 Work Material Composition
The most important companion of steel is carbon. Carbon exists mainly in a
bonded form in iron carbide, cementite (Fe3C). Cementite with a C content of
6.67 % is rhombic crystalline and has a high hardness of HV & 1,000. The other
basic component is the a-mixed crystal, ferrite, with a C content of less than
0.02 %. Ferrite is body-centered and only has a low hardness around HV & 90.
The eutectoid perlite (0.86 % C) consists of a ﬁne mixture of ferrite and cementite.
Hypo-eutectoid steels consist of a mixture of ferrite and cementite, hypereutectoid
ones of secondary cementite and perlite.
The percentage of hard components provides an indication to the wear tendency
of steels. The force components increase with the C content. Though some steels
with a low C content (\0.02 %), such as softly annealed case hardening steels,
have a tendency to sticking and to adhesion, which again worsens the
machinability.
Oxygen gets into the steel during manufacturing. It is found only as oxide
inclusions, such as manganese oxide, silicon oxide (silicates) and aluminum oxide.
All oxides have wearing effects, particularly alumina [WIN83].
Silicon easily combines with oxygen and yields hard silicate inclusions. It leads
to an increase of the strength of ferrite and increases the tool wear.

Sulfur has a low solubility in steel, forming stable sulﬁdes. Its binding ability to
metals increases in the order of nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), iron
(Fe), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), zirconium (Zr), and titanium (Ti). Which
sulﬁdes arise therefore depends on the alloying constituents of the steel. Iron
sulﬁde is undesirable, because it has a low melting point and is deposited at the
grain boundaries. Red or hot shortness may occur during hot forming. Manganese,
which has a greater afﬁnity to sulfur than iron, can lead to the development of
manganese sulﬁdes (MnS), which have a higher melting point than iron sulﬁdes
and thus red or hot shortness can be avoided. Manganese sulﬁdes act in a wear
reducing manner.
Manganese binds sulfur and so also helps steel to achieve better mechanical
properties. For a manganese/sulfur ratio greater than Mn/S = 1.7 the entire sulfur
is set to manganese sulfur with the melting point at 1,600 C or to other manga-
nese-containing sulﬁdes. In ﬂow chip formation, manganese sulﬁdes can moreover
apply a covering and lubrication effect on the cutting wedge (see melting proce-
dure, Sect. 7.6.2).
A phosphorus content of up to 0.1 % beneﬁts the machinability with the fact
that the steel becomes brittle and thus more advantageous chip forms occur.
However, the increase in hardness can reduce the tool life. Figure 7.29 shows an
overview of the effects of the steel composition on the tool wear or the tool life
respectively.

Wear

7.6.2 Melting Procedure
By adding deoxidizing agents such as aluminum, silicon or manganese which have
a high afﬁnity to oxygen, a strong gas development is suppressed during the
solidiﬁcation of the melt. The released oxygen gets bound. Alumina and silicon
oxides are hard inclusions and not formable. Tool wear is especially increased, if
the oxide inclusions exist in large quantities or in line form in the steel. The choice
of suitable deoxidizing agents can favorably inﬂuence the wear. Steels deoxy-
genated with calcium-silicon or ferro-silicon generates wear-inhibiting oxide and
sulﬁde protective coatings on tungsten carbide and ceramic cutting edges. In
Fig. 7.30, the mechanism of the wear-reducing effect of the coatings is shown.
The coating consisting of (Mn,Ca)S (thickness ca. 1 lm) has a separating and
lubricating effect, which especially diminishes crater wear clearly. The reduction
of the friction generated at the cutting edge results in a lower thermal load of the
tool. The coating can also act as a diffusion barrier between tool and work
material. Figure 7.31 shows the tool life depending on the cutting speed for a
calcium-treated and an untreated steel.
The gains in tool life due to the treatment are considerable. EDX analyses show
that in the crater zone of Ca treated steel deposits with Ca concentration exist and
especially in the zone of notch wear accumulations of sulfur and manganese occur
(Figs. 7.32 and 7.33) [TÖN89]. A comparison of the EDX analyses of iron and
silicon shows that in the domain covered by calcium almost no iron exists.
Therefore, the direct contact between iron and the tool insert is inhibited.
A high concentration of iron exists in the ﬂank wear zone, in the crater ramp
and in the notch wear zone when machining untreated steel. The existence of a
cover of (Ca,Mn)S cannot be proved so that a direct contact of steel and incor-
porated carbides (and also aluminum oxides) occurs here, which results in a higher
wear at the ﬂank and at the crater zone.

7.6.3 Heat Treatment
By means of the heat treatment the texture of steels can be inﬂuenced to a large
extent. The following components inﬂuence the wear unfavorably in rising order:
• ferrite
• perlite with mould-in cementite
• course perlite
• ﬁne perlite

Wear

• bainite
• martensite
• cementite.
In addition, a considerable decrease of wear can result at equal strength from
the coarseness of work material grains such as a BY-treatment (controlled cooling
from forging heat), i.e., precipitation hardening ferritic-pearlitic steel (Fig. 7.33).
The coarse structure of the texture is seen as the cause [WIN83].
7.7 Rounding of the Cutting Edge
In addition to the macro geometry of a cutting tool (rake angle, clearance angle,
etc.), it is the micro geometry of the cutting edge, which determines the perfor-
mance and the wear characteristic. The cutting edge shape, for instance, is of
special importance for hard turning operations when high demands exist at the
workpiece surface. Above all, cutting a workpiece surface of high quality requires
a well-deﬁned cutting edge. The cutting edges endure high force and temperature
loads. Hyper sharp cutting edges cannot meet these requirements and have only a
short life time. Despite the low strength of the cutting edge, small break-outs of
hard carbide particles out of the bonding are causal due to the grinding process
[DEN02] (Fig. 7.34, left upper part). The targeted rounding or chamfering of the
cutting edge allows a uniform quality of the machined part and an increase of
performance and tool life.
Fig. 7.33 Distribution of elements after the machining of non-treated steel
7.6
Inﬂuence of Work Material on Wear
153

For the rounding or chamfering of the cutting edge, it is subjected to an
additional processing step after grinding. Different methods are applied for this
preparation. Among these are brushing, abrasive blasting or polishing as well as
several grinding processes [FRI02].
A rounding of the cutting edge is not necessarily circular. As a matter of fact it
can be expected that due to the oriented indentation of the cutting wedge into the
work material, deviation from circular shape brings beneﬁts. However, a broader
deﬁnition of the edge geometry is needed. To come to a more detailed charac-
terization of the cutting edge, four parameters are introduced: Dr, u, Sa, Sc. The
procedure of measurement is shown in Fig. 7.35. The parameter Dr describes the
size of the rounding, the angle u (not to be confused with the feed motion angle)
describes the displacement of the cutting edge either to the rake or to the ﬂank face
and the parameters Sa, and Sc describe the sharp or blunt course to the rake or the
ﬂank face. These parameters can be measured automatically with little effort by
means of a mechanical stylus and a measuring program or optically. The so
measured values allow a deﬁned characterization of the cutting edge geometry and
a systematic identiﬁcation of the inﬂuencing values for an optimized cutting
process.
Commonly-practiced edge roundings for the machining of steel are in the
domain of Dr = 10–30 lm. The machining of titanium requires a sharp edge as far
as possible, i.e., Dr  0: Tests of orthogonal grooving, where different edge shapes
have been processed in a targeted way, show that the uniform rounding with
u = 0 results in the maximal machining forces in all cases (Fig. 7.36). It also
shows that cutting edges with unequal forms—whether in a positive or negative
direction (+ or -u)—result in lower machining forces.

Wear

With smaller feeds the force alterations by changes of the angle u are greater
than with larger feeds. It can be recognized from this, that the inﬂuence of the
micro-geometry of the cutting edge is greater in ﬁnishing – which was to be
expected. The machining forces can be reduced by unequally rounded cutting
edges. Thus an increased quality of the surface and reduced wear can be achieved.

Cutting Materials
Cutting materials determine the economic viability of a cutting process to a great
extent. The development of the cutting technology is therefore directly linked to
the development of the cutting materials. Figure 8.1 shows the hour cutting speed.
That is the cutting speed applicable for one hour of tool life, which has become
possible due to new developments since the last turn of the century. Per decade,
the possible cutting speed is approximately doubled.
In addition to the still often applied high speed steels the following hard cutting
materials can be named, classiﬁed according to DIN ISO 513:
• tungsten carbide
• cutting ceramics
• diamond
• boron nitride.
8.1 Requirements on Cutting Materials
Cutting materials have to be wear resistant (hard) and sufﬁciently tough to ensure a
long tool life and high process reliability. Both requirements cannot be fulﬁlled
simultaneously for the reason that hard materials are generally not tough and vice
versa (Fig. 8.2). The loads and the wear mechanisms (see Chap. 7) require the
following properties [VIE70, TÖN90]: Hardness, hot hardness, toughness and
chemical stability (Table 8.1).
Hardness: Hardness is a measure of the wear resistance of the cutting material.
It counteracts abrasive and adhesive wear. Cutting materials can take their hard-
ness from the base material, from hard particles incorporated in a binding matrix or
exclusively by hard crystallites, which are directly connected by grain boundaries.
The hard material content is accordingly different (Fig. 8.3).
Hot hardness: Even under high temperatures of the cutting wedge, the hardness
has to be maintained to counteract abrasive wear and plastic deformations
(Fig. 8.4).

Toughness: The ability of materials to withstand the propagation of cracks is called
toughness. The fracture mechanics deliver a measure for the toughness by the stress
intensity factor, the KIc-value (also called the fracture toughness). The KIc-value is
determined with a technological test procedure with prescribed sample geometry after
a numerical value equation. According to Fig. 8.5, a sample with deﬁned initial
fracture incipient crack (for instance a fatigue crack introduced by a tension pulsating
stress) is loaded in a tension or 3-point bending test so far that the crack is unstable, i.e.
abruptly propagating. The applied fracture stress is rb; a is the length of the crack; Y is
a calibrating factor, that takes the sample geometry into account.
Fig. 8.2 Cutting materials and their wear resistance and toughness [KLO08]
Fig. 8.1 Development of cutting materials
160

Cutting Materials

The stress intensity factor KIc of cutting materials lies between 13 and
30 MPa m1/2 for high speed steels, 8 and 18 MPa m1/2 for tungsten carbide and
2 and 7 MPa m1/2 for cutting ceramics.
For ceramics, which show brittle behavior, the bending fracture strength also
gives an indication on the toughness. Its numerical value given in MPa is 100–200
times as much as the KIc-value. The toughness affects the fracture tendency of the
cutting material and the wear resistance in transient mechanical and thermal
loading. For instance, the latter loading is called thermo shock. The resistance
against temperature change is called temperature change resistance or thermo-
shock resistance.
Chemical stability: To counteract tribo-mechanical wear cutting materials
should be inert against work materials and environmental agents such as air and
cutting ﬂuids. Chemical stability is a prerequisite for the use of a cutting material
under high temperatures. A measure for the chemical stability is the bond

enthalpy. A large negative bond enthalpy of an alloy corresponds to high chemical
stability, which means a large amount of heat energy has to be introduced to cause
a chemical reaction.
There is no ideal cutting material, which fulﬁlls all demands named above. For
all cutting materials the fundamental dualism applies to be either hard and wear
resistant or tough and resistant against transient loads.

8.2 Tool Steels
One distinguishes between unalloyed and alloyed tool steels. Unalloyed tool steels
(Carbon steels) contain 0.6–1.3 % carbon. They get their hardness and wear
resistance by hardening, which generates a martensitic structure. Alloyed tool
steels for higher loads additionally contain up to 5 % shares of Cr, W, Mo and V.
Compared to unalloyed tool steels they have an elevated wear resistance (additive
of carbides generating elements) and a greater hardness (carbon passed into
solution). Due to the limited hot hardness of tool steels (Fig. 8.4) only lower
cutting speeds can be applied so that tool steels are hardly used on machine tools
for the machining of metals. They are primarily applied for cutting manually-
driven tools, for hand tools such as ﬁles and hand-reamers and for woodworking
tools.
8.3 High Speed Steels
High speed steels (HSS) are ledeburitic, highly alloyed tool steels with alloy
contents of up to 35 %. They are used as tools for drilling, milling, reaming,
sawing and turning. In contrast to the tool steels mentioned above they have a
higher annealing temperature and a hot hardness of up to 600 C (Fig. 8.4).
The alloy elements bound as carbides do not determine the higher annealing
stability, but therefore the alloy elements in the matrix do. The hardness and the
high wear resistance also arise from the martensitic matrix as well as from the
incorporated W, W-Mo, Cr, and V carbides.
The properties of high speed steel are primarily governed by the alloy elements
W and Mo. The tungsten and molybdenum contents are therefore used to classify
the high speed steels according to [DIN EN 10027-1] into four groups (Table 8.2).

They are marked by HS for high speed steel and the percentage contents of the
alloying elements W-Mo-V-Co. The universal type HS6-5-2 covers more than
50 % of the totally manufactured high speed steel. The varieties mentioned in the
6 % W and 5 % Mo-classes cover approximately 90 % of the manufactured
quantity [HAB88].
The alloying elements affect speciﬁc properties of the high speed steels:
C
Carbon is essential for the hardness and necessary for the formation of
carbides.
W
Tungsten is a carbide former and increases the tempering resistance and the
wear resistance.
Mo
Molybdenum increases the ability of through-hardening and the toughness;
it can replace tungsten. Due to the half density lower mass contents are
required compared to tungsten.
V
Vanadium, similar to tungsten, is a carbide former and increases the wear
resistance.
Co
Cobalt is able to raise the hardening temperature. Thereby, more alloy
contents of carbide formers can be solved, i.e. the hot hardness and the
tempering resistance increase.
High speed steels are produced by melting processes. The hardening temper-
ature (1,180–1,280 C depending on alloy elements) and the immersion time
during the tempering procedure are chosen so that the largest possible fraction of
carbides is solved but no coarseness of grains is generated. The remaining part of
austenite can be reduced by repeated annealing (540–580 C). The precipitation of
carbides works against the decrease of hardness by collapsing martensite con-
nected with the annealing. The decrease of hardness, however, is connected with
an increase of toughness.
In the melting process, the high speed steels tend to segregation during the solidi-
ﬁcation phase, which is detrimental on the wear resistance. To avoid these disadvan-
tages, electro slag remelting processes (ESU) and powder metallurgy manufacturing
(PM) are applied. Either method leads to a more uniform structure and ﬁner grains. PM
steelshavebetteredgestrengthandcuttingedgedurability.Theyare usedforthreading
and reaming tools. With higher carbide fractions they are better grindable than molten
high speed steel. The higher manufacturing costs are detrimental.
Longer tool life and higher cutting speeds can be reached with high speed steel
by coating with titanium nitride (TiN). The layers have a thickness of 2–7 lm.
Friction between tool and work material and thus the adhesive wear can be
reduced by TiN. The lower friction leads to a reduction of the necessary cutting
power and the cutting forces by 10–20 %.
The rake face is heated by friction especially at higher cutting speeds. The
greater part of the power transformation takes place in the chip formation zone
(see Chap. 5), the shearing energy contributes but little to the temperature at the
tool surface. Therefore, a reduction of the total power as a result of lower rake face
friction has the following effect:

 ða  1Þ
ð8:3Þ
The total speciﬁc energy kc divides itself into the friction share on the rake face
kc and the shearing share (plus the friction at the ﬂank face) kU. With a coating, the
total energy decreases to akc as a result of the lowered friction at the rake face to
bkc. With the values from Chap. 5 for the shearing and the friction energy and
a = 0.8 (i.e. reduction of the cutting power to 80 %) follows b = 0.2 of the
original value without coating. The temperatures in a high speed tool can be
lowered signiﬁcantly by a TiN coating, which results in a considerable gain in the
possible cutting speed or the tool life respectively. In addition, the abrasive wear is
reduced by the higher hardness of the TiN layer in the range of HV05 = 2,400
compared to the substrate with the hardness of HV05 = 900 at room temperature.
Due to the lower process temperatures during the vapor deposition of layers
high speed steels are coated by physical vapor deposition (PVD). Typical coating
temperatures in this process are lower than 500 C. Thereby, hardly any annealing
effects occur. For chemical vapor deposition (CVD) the process temperatures are
900–1,000 C, which is far above the annealing temperature of high speed steel.
CVD-coated tools therefore have to be post-hardened. Because of the connected
risk of warpage this is achieved only for simple shapes such as cutting inserts.
Section 8.5 gives further explanations concerning the various vapor deposition
methods.
Coated tools have a signiﬁcantly longer tool life. Even reground tools still show
a clear effect. The causes are the supporting and protecting effects by TiN-car-
ryovers. Beside others, twist drills, milling cutters, hobs, taps, broaches and
reaming tools are coated. They can then be used for partly decisively higher
cutting and feed speeds. Figure 8.6 shows the recommended cutting and feed
speeds of differently coated twist drills of high speed steel and of solid tungsten
carbide for a drill diameter of 6 mm.
8.4 Stellites
Stellites are cast hard alloys (not to be confused with hard metals, which are
sintered). They are naturally hard so they need not be hardened. They were
developed for the ﬁrst time by E. Haynes in 1915. Stellites have the following
composition: 42–53 % Co, 24–33 % Cr, 11–22 % W and 1.8–3 % C. Cr and W
form carbides. Stellites have a hardness of HV0.5 = 700–750 at room tempera-
ture. At low cutting speeds they are inferior to high speed steel, at higher cutting
speeds they are inferior to tungsten carbide materials (Fig. 8.4). The possibilities
8.3
High Speed Steels
165

of shaping by casting can be beneﬁcial for large proﬁle tools. The high oxidation
resistance of stellites can be of interest for materials, which tend strongly to
oxidation wear.
8.5 Cemented Carbides
Cemented carbides are two- or multi-phase powder metallurgically produced
alloys of a binding metal (b-phase) which determines the toughness -, and metal
carbides or -carbonitrides as the hardness carrier [KIE53]. As hard materials,
tungsten carbide (WC, called a-phase), titanium-, tantalum- or niobium-carbide
(TiC, TaC, NbC, called c-phase) or titanium carbonitride or other titanium mixed
carbides are used. The ﬁrst basic patent on a WC–Co cemented carbide was
granted to K. Schroeter of the Osram-Studiengesellschaft in 1923. The beneﬁcial
combination of properties is due to the fact that tungsten carbide is very well
wetted by cobalt (b-phase) and that cobalt is able to solubilize larger shares of
tungsten carbide. The good wettability is such that tungsten carbide never breaks
interfacially alongside the bonding metal-carbide boundaries. The solvent power
causes high internal binding forces and a good edge strength of the carbide.
By variation of the a- and b-phase shares the cutting material can be tailored to
a certain extent. Tough carbides contain up to 15 % Co, wear resisting in contrast
only up to 5 % Co (Table 8.3). The diffusion tendency of WC carbide can be
reduced by titanium carbide, which leads to better hot wear resistance of cemented
Fig. 8.6 Recommended cutting speeds and feed speeds of various coated twist drills (acc. to
Guehring)

Cutting Materials

carbides in spite of the higher hot hardness of WC (HV05 = 1,800 at room
temperature, HV05 = 800 at 1,000 C) compared to TiC (HV05 = 3,000 at room
temperature, HV05 = 400 at 1,000 C). However, the binding capacity and hence
the toughness and edge strength is reduced. Additions of TaC and NbC counteract
this tendency by grain ﬁning and thereby increase the toughness.
The most important new developments to increase the hardness of WC–Co
carbides are the ﬁne grain and the ultra-ﬁne grain cemented carbides with a WC
grain size of 0.5–0.8 lm and 0.2–0.5 lm respectively with a cobalt content of
6–16 % by mass. These ﬁne powders have a nearly round grain shape in contrast to
standard materials, which not only has a positive inﬂuence on the homogeneity of
the microstructure generated by sintering but also on the reachable density.
A recent development in the ﬁeld of carbides is a functional gradient set into the
surface zones of cutting tools (FGH, functionally graded hard metal). Such a
functional gradient is a precise, ﬁnely varying distribution of phases and/or
composition of elements, which provides a resistant surface zone, able to with-
stand the interactions between workpiece and tool under high temperatures. So, for
example, the Co content is increased in the surface area to selectively enhance the
toughness and to reduce cutting edge breakages [BOE02].
According to [DIN ISO 513], the cemented carbides are classiﬁed into three
groups. The so-called cutting application groups, P, K and M. The WC- (TiC,
TaC-, NbC-) Co alloys in the P group (P for plastic) are used to machine long chips
forming ferrous materials as steel. The TiC-/TaC- alloys, largely free of WC–Co,
of the K group are applied for the machining of non-ferrous metals, ferrous cast
iron materials, AlSi alloys, plastics and wood. The transition between the P and K
groups form the cemented carbides of the M group, which are used for alloyed
austenitic and ferritic steels respectively and for alloyed cast iron. Toughness and
wear resistance are marked by appending digits within each application group.
With increasing numbers the toughness increases and the wear resistance is
reduced. Table 8.3 lists typical compositions and properties of cemented carbides.
The characteristic and at the same time limiting dualism for cutting materials, to
have a high hardness and wear resistance on one hand and a high bending strength
and toughness on the other, can be overcome largely by coatings of the substrate.
This principle of functional separation combines wear resisting layers with tough

base material. Due to great temperature differences which occur in cutting tools,
the control of temperature cracks as a result of different thermal expansion coef-
ﬁcients is a prerequisite for durable and crack free coatings.
Titanium carbide (TiC), titanium nitride (TiN), titanium carbonitride (TiCN)
and titanium aluminium nitride (TiAlN) still have a large proportion of the coating
materials. Selected properties of some of these materials compared to tungsten
carbide are shown in Table 8.4. The properties of these hard materials are mainly
determined by the kind of chemical bond. Good layer adhesion, for example, is
best achieved by metallic bonding since it has the greatest adhesion forces. High
hardness for optimal wear resistance is best achieved by covalent bonding. The
also required chemical stability is predominantly due to ionic bonding. TiN holds
shares of all three types of bonding. Therefore, it was successfully used as the ﬁrst
layer [BOB08].
New PVD layers consist of systems of TiN/TiAlN or hard-soft combinations
such as TiAlN ? WC/C in several folds or multiple fold layers. Nano-structured
layers of TiSiN, TiAlN, TiAlSiN or TiAlBN have already been in use for several
years. CrAlN, CrAlSiN or Al2O3 are components of multilayers coatings, which
are successfully used for the machining of hard materials [BOB08].
Additionally in the CVD coating of multiple layers, coatings with oxide cera-
mic shares affect beneﬁcially. Combinations of TiC, TiN, TiCN, and Al2O3 were
advantageous. For the turning of steel and cast iron materials a layer package of
TiN, TiCN, Al2O3 and ZrCN proved value. Improvements of performance of CVD
coatings can be achieved by quaternary coating materials like (T,Zr)(C,N) or
(Ti,Hf)(C,N) [DRE01].
Titanium carbonitride coatings can be built up on TiC with a monotonous
transition of the shares up to pure TiN. TiN is chemically inert and therefore
counteracts the wear by diffusion and oxidation. In addition, it has a low adhesion
tendency and reduces the respected wear. Aluminum oxide is also inert. It serves
as a protection against oxidation.
(Ti,Al)N beneﬁts at high process temperatures and forms a thin, passive layer
on the tool surface, which prevents fast growing wear by diffusion and oxidation.
High ionization pulse processes allow the production of non-conducting nitride
layers with a high content oxide forming components such as (Al,Ti)N super
nitride layers with more than 65 mol
% of aluminum nitride. This further
development of tool coatings aims at an improved wear behavior. Figure 8.7
shows the basic structure of different layer concepts in principle.
The single or multi-layer coatings are 2–10 lm thick in total. They are gen-
erated by vapor deposition. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) works with process
temperatures of 900–1,000 C. Figure 8.8 shows the process of the deposition of
TiC layers according to the following reaction formula

located. At the heated surface of the substrate, the gases decompose into the
respected solid material (TiC) and into volatile by-products (HCl). The layers
grow up granularly (TiC, Al2O3) or ﬁbrously (TiN). First, the growth of TiC occurs
with a high coating rate. With a growing coating thickness the coating rate slows
down, while the grain size of the layer increases. With CVD tensile stresses occur
in the layers because of the different thermal expansion coefﬁcients and because of
the cooling down after coating. These stresses can exceed tensile strength and thus
generate cracks.

Cutting Materials

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) works at lower temperatures of about 500 C.
Ion plating or cathode sputtering is applied (see Fig. 8.9). The layers develop by
the acceleration of loaded particles and by the bombardment of the substrate.
Geometric limitations result, which can be partly neutralized by rotating the
samples, because the faces to be coated have to be accessible. Residual stresses
also develop in the coatings. However, they are hardly caused by the differences in
thermal expansion, but rather by the ion bombardment. Compressive stresses are
generated, which possibly beneﬁts transient thermal loading, since the compres-
sive residual stresses compensate the thermal stresses in the layers.
The plasma-CVD process avoids the limitations of the CVD and the PVD
procedure (Fig. 8.10). The procedure no longer uses only thermal energy to
activate the chemical reactions, but the process is activated by a plasma in the
reactor. On the one hand, the plasma has a catalytic effect. On the other hand, its
task is energy coupling. Thus, the reactions can occur at lower temperatures or
only become due to them.
The PACVD can generate nitride, carbide or also carbonitride layers depending
on the gas feeding. The coating according to the PACVD process implements
substrate temperatures below 500 C.
In contrast to the CVD coating diffusion actions, phase transforming and
replacement reactions as well as the connected embrittlement effects between
substrate and layer are therefore excluded. In contrast to layers generated by PVD,
which are also superimposed under lower temperatures, the PACVD layers show
high adhesion strengths and lower residual stresses as well as a smaller inﬂuence
on the bending strength of the substrate. Furthermore, the adjusting and charging
necessary with the PVD process to obtain a uniform layer thickness is omitted.

Very hard layers of diamond can be applied on cutting inserts and on shank
tools by means of the CVD process. As substrate materials ﬁne grained tungsten
carbides or silicon based ceramics are suitable. The cobalt content is responsible
for the strength of the CVD-diamond coated carbide tools [UHL04].
First successful trials with CBN coatings have also been documented [WIE07,
UHL04]. Improvements to PVD coating techniques and plasma-assisted CVD
resulted in CBN layers with more than 1 lm thickness deposited on carbide
inserts. These layers are more than twice as hard as TiN layers and show more than
a tenfold resistance to abrasive wear, where the coefﬁcient of friction against steel
is only half the size. Application attempts when turning steel, partially hardened
and cast materials show the potential of the CBN layers but also the great amount
of research to be done [UHL04].
Thin amorphous carbon layers were successfully synthesized 40 years ago,
reminding of diamond as far as transparency, refraction index, insulation, hardness
and chemical resistance is concerned. They are therefore called diamond-like
carbon (DLC) [AIS71]. This material allows a wide variety of properties by means
of the insertion of hydrogen, metallic or nonmetallic elements, which allows a
signiﬁcant determination of its properties. DLC coated tools are used to cut Al-
and AlSi-alloys [SAN07, FUK04]. The tendency to build up edges is suppressed
and the surface roughness of the workpiece is reduced.
Nowadays, 80 % of the carbide tools are PVD or CVD-coated [BOB08]. But
they did not prove worthy for the machining of non-ferrous metals, highly nickel
containing steels or nickel based alloys and austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. It
also has to be noted that coated carbides have larger cutting edge radii by principle
(equidistant, process necessary rounding). For very small undeformed chip
thicknesses this leads to highly negative rake angles with the result that coated

Cutting Materials

tools are not usable for ﬁne ﬁnishing operations. For the rest coated carbides are
clearly superior to non-coated inserts as far as the wear behavior is concerned
(Fig. 8.11). Besides, an economic reduction of grades is achievable due to the
coating because a close adaptation to the machining conditions or to the machined
material is no longer necessary.
Coated carbides wear slowly and show a characteristic wear development
(Fig. 8.12). Even if the layer is penetrated, there is still a protective effect as can be
seen in the moderate wear progress. It is explained by retain effects and a con-
tinuous plating by adhesion. After further use the typical steep wear occurs.
To assess the wear status of tools the cater depth KT can be applied beside the
width of ﬂank wear land. Figure 8.13 indicates the wear behavior of a TiC-Al2O3
carbide.

A change of the properties of carbides, particularly of hardness, toughness and
wear resistance is possible due to the change in the grain size and the shape of the
carbides. This led to the development of ultra-ﬁne grain hard metals. By using ﬁne
grain carbides (grain size \ 1 lm) hardness, fracture toughness, compressive
strength, wear resistance and edge strength are increased. Due to the small grain
size and the material properties, particularly sharp and highly loadable cutting
edges can be achieved with ultra-ﬁne grain carbides. Accordingly, ultra-ﬁne grain
carbides are applied in ﬁnishing and ﬁne ﬁnishing operations as well as for drills.
Advantages exist for drill operations particularly when cutting with low cutting
speeds (vc \ 60 m/min). Here, the high toughness of the cutting material comes
into play. So, clear tool life improvements have been achieved compared to
conventional hard metals (Fig. 8.14).
8.6 Cermets
Hard metals without free tungsten carbide are called Cermets (from the word stem
‘‘ceramics’’ and ‘‘metals’’) [ETT88]. They are multi-component hard metals based
on titanium carbonitrides with tantalum, niobium and vanadium in the hard phase.
The binder contains nickel and cobalt. Mixed crystal hardening can increase the
wear resistance from the binder side, also by means of molybdenum, titanium, and
aluminum. In contrast to tungsten carbides the cermets have a signiﬁcantly higher
chemical stability at high temperatures, i.e. less diffusion and oxidation wear. In
addition, cermets offer a far higher edge stability. The sustainable cutting speeds
are higher than those of coated tungsten carbides (Fig. 8.15).

Cutting Materials

The fracture toughness of cermets is lower (Table 8.4) than that of tough WC
hard metal. Large differences exist in the thermal expansion coefﬁcient and in the
heat conductivity, which affects the application behavior in transient loading (see
Chap. 7).
Cermets can be used for ﬁnish turning, thread turning and milling of steel and
cast iron. The tendency of the batch production to use formed and molded parts
with little allowance (near net shape technology) complies with the use of cermets.

8.7 Ceramics
Cutting tools of ceramic materials are manufactured by sintering metal oxides,
nitrides and carbides [FRI88, MOM93]. The ceramic base materials are divided
into oxide and non-oxide ceramics. Aluminum and zirconium oxide belong to the
most important oxide-ceramic cutting materials, silicon nitride, titanium carbide
and nitride to the non-oxide ceramics (Fig. 8.16). Compounds and mixed crystals
(for instance SiAlON) are used to combine the advantageous properties of various
base materials.
The most important properties of ceramics are their great hardness and their
wear resistance. With increasing temperature the hardness of ceramics decreases
more slowly than that of cemented carbide, whose hard particles are embedded
into a metallic binder phase. Thus, ceramic cutting materials have a very good
wear resistance even at high cutting speeds (Fig. 8.17). Their chemical inactivity
reduces material adhesions and crater wear.
The toughness of ceramic cutting materials is limited. Ceramics break in a
brittle way at mechanical overload, practically without any preceding plastic
deformation. Compared to metals the expansion of a crack in ceramic materials
requires only little energy. Therefore, ceramics are very sensitive towards external
kerfs and internal material defects, where stress superelevations take place. The
strength of a ceramic part is determined by the size of its biggest defect. Since the
sizes of texture and surface defects are subject to statistic distributions, the fracture
strength of ceramics varies in wide limits. It can be described by the Weibull
distribution (Fig. 8.18). These relationships can affect the process reliability of
applying ceramic cutting materials.
It was Osenberg who applied ceramic material for the ﬁrst time as cutting tool
in 1938. But he was unsuccessful, because he used pure aluminum oxide (alumina)
which is a very brittle material [OSE38]. Enhanced oxide ceramic cutting

materials have been available since the 1960s. They contain 5–15 % zirconium
oxide or up to 40 % titanium carbide and nitride (‘‘black’’ mixed ceramic) besides
the 60–95 % of the hardness carrier alumina.
The addition of ﬁnely distributed zirconium oxide (ZrO2) enhances the fracture
toughness. This dispersion strengthening is based on three mechanisms: the stress
inducing, the crack deﬂection and the crack furcation (Fig. 8.19).
Under mechanical load in the neighborhood of a crack from its metastable
tetragonal high-temperature phase, the ZrO2 converts into the monocline low-
temperature phase. Since monocline ZrO2 has a 4 % lower density than tetragonal
ZrO2 the particles tend to increase their volume. At this, they generate stress ﬁelds

in the Al2O3 matrix. Cracks are deﬂected onto ZrO2 particles and stop there (crack
deﬂection). However, local stress ﬁelds are already generated in Al2O3-ZrO2
ceramic during the cooling of the sintering temperature. They are the result of the
different thermal expansion coefﬁcients of the two materials (thermal misﬁt
stresses). These stresses can be adjusted by the grain size of the zirconium oxide in
such a way so that they generate a great number of micro cracks (0.01–0.1 lm)
around the ZrO2 particles. Because of their small size these cracks do not reduce
the strength of the cutting ceramic. If an external crack encounters such a micro-
crack network, its surface is greatly enlarged and the necessary energy to spread
further increases correspondingly (crack furcation).
Dispersion-reinforced aluminum oxide ceramic is applied for the rough and
ﬁnish turning of steel and cast iron up to a hardness of 48 HRC or 400 HV
respectively. To cut aluminum alloys aluminum oxide ceramics are not suitable
due to the chemical attack.
Titanium carbide and titanium nitride increase the hardness and abrasive wear
resistance of the pure alumina. Their predominant covalent bondings give these
materials a particularly high hot hardness compared to the predominant ionically-
bonded alumina. This means that hardened steels up to 64 HRC can also be
machined. The main application area of Al2O3-TiC/TiN ceramic is ﬁnishing at
high cutting speeds. The signiﬁcantly elevated heat conductivity allows the use at
rapidly varying thermal loads of interrupted cutting.
Silicon nitride (Si3N4) was introduced to machine cast iron and highly heat
resistant materials at the beginning of the 1980s. The hardness of these non-oxide
ceramics depends little on temperature. Due to beneﬁcial thermal properties and a
higher toughness, the silicon nitride ceramic is much less sensitive to thermal
shock than pure oxide ceramic so that it can also be used in interrupted cutting.
However, silicon nitride reacts at temperatures above 1,200 C with iron forming

Cutting Materials

ferro-silicides. Therefore, it is not applicable for cutting steel, if such high tem-
peratures are reached.
All cutting ceramics are produced by the sintering of ﬁne powders. Thereby, the
operational steps for cutting materials on the base of alumina and silicon nitride
differ substantially. Figure 8.20 indicates the possible process steps for oxide
ceramics. As precursors and in the form of powders, the intended basic materials
and small shares of sintering additives are used, then weighed together in the
required portions and ﬁnally subjected to a crushing and grinding procedure in a
ball mill. This destroys the agglomerates of ﬁne powder particles, which otherwise
would lead to sintering defects. The grain size is set by the powder production
(precipitation, gas phase reaction) and is generally not reduced any further here.
The processed powder mixture can now be processed to solid ceramic bodies in
different ways. The older procedure includes a compacting of the powder at room
temperature and pressure of several hundred bar in a press form and then a non-
pressure sintering of the semi-solid green body between 1,500 and 1,800 C. These
two process steps are combined in one single operation by means of the hot
sintering mode. In both cases, the cutting insert is individually pressed and not cut
from a larger sintered body. For particularly higher demands concerning pore free
products and strength, the completed tools can be repressed isostatically at a high
gas pressure and high temperatures. Prerequisite for this is an already closed
porosity, at least at the surface. The sintered tools must ﬁnally be set to the
required form and dimension by diamond grinding and polishing. The required
high surface quality is also produced in this process step.
Figure 8.21 explains the cutting ceramic on the base of silicon nitride. Raw
materials can be silicon nitride as well as silicon powders. The latter reacts only
when sintering at the nitrogen atmosphere of the furnace to a- and b-silicon nitride
(reaction bonded Si3N4). All silicon nitride ceramics must be sintered under high
nitrogen pressure, because Si3N4 dissolves into its elementary constituents at

normal pressure and high temperatures. Furthermore, sintering aids (yttrium-
manganese- silicon-oxides) have to be added to build a silicate glass phase, which
binds the needle-shaped silicon nitride crystals to a dense, pore-free structure.
Because glasses have no ﬁxed melting point but soften at elevated temperatures,
the high temperature strength of silicon nitride cutting materials is reduced by the
glass phase. The result is creeping, i.e. slow plastic deformation follows under
mechanical load. The Si3N4- crystals slip against each other alongside the grain
boundaries. To increase the maximum applicable temperature of usage, the glass
can be totally or partly crystalized out by subsequent tempering (aged at elevated
temperature). Thus, between the Si3N4-needles a matrix of garnet crystals is built
with a high melting point temperature, which is far more creep-resistant.
Cutting inserts of hot pressed silicon nitride are sintered in the form of large
plates and subsequently separated by laser. In contrast to oxide ceramic, laser
cutting is unproblematic in this case as silicon nitride has no melting phase but
sublimes at 1,900 C. To achieve form, dimension and surface-quality the silicon
nitride inserts are also ﬁnished by diamond grinding. Due to the high hardness and
the relatively high toughness, the grinding of ceramics is very expensive and
causes a high partition of the total manufacturing cost of cutting tools.
The new developments of ceramic cutting materials aim towards an increase in
process reliability. Therefore, the ceramics are strengthened by ceramic ﬁbers, high
strength ﬁber-shaped single crystals (whiskers) and platelets. They increase the
bending strength and particularly the fracture toughness by means of crack
deﬂection, crack bridging and thus stress reduction at the crack front. However,
these measures complicate the grinding processes and increase the cost of the
ceramic tools. In the case of whiskers there are health hazards in handling the
powder, which is why the production was abandoned in Germany for the time being.

8.8 Diamond
Diamond and cubic crystalline boron nitride belong to the super hard cutting
materials. Diamond is the hardest known substance. It consists of pure carbon.
Elemental carbon co-exists in the stable modiﬁcation, i.e. graphite and in the
unstable high pressure modiﬁcation, i.e. diamond. Diamond solidiﬁes cubic
crystalline, where each carbon atom is surrounded by four neighboring carbon
atoms in the lattice. The C-atoms are tetrahedrally linked by covalent bonds. The
high hardness of the diamond follows from the high binding energy of the atoms.
Diamonds are found and mined in nature. Since the 1950s [BUN55], diamonds
are also being produced synthetically. Both modiﬁcations may exist as mono-
crystalline or poly-crystalline diamonds.
8.8.1 Mono-Crystalline Diamond
Diamonds found in nature are mostly applied as single crystals, namely where
cutting edges of highest sharpness and lowest chipping are required. Typical
application domains are the ultra-precision cutting and the shine cutting of non-
ferrous metals such as aluminum, copper and their alloys. Using the crystallo-
graphic orientation of the diamond, the crystal can be shaped by means of grinding
and polishing to the minimum cutting edge radius rb * 1 lm. The cutting edges
are ground in a facetted way, i.e. with several major cutting edge angles and small
minor cutting edges of 1–3, or as arc edge (large radius re). The mono crystals
are soldered or clamped in a holding element. Mono-crystalline diamond has
strong direction-dependent physical properties (anisotropic material behavior), for
instance hardness, strength, Young’s modulus and heat conductivity. This
anisotropy is used to modify diamond by cleaving, grinding and polishing. For its
application as a tool it is orientated as far as possible into its hard, wear resistant
directions. Basically, large mono-crystalline diamonds can also be produced
synthetically. So far, however, due to the high cost of equipment and of tools for
the production of large crystals for the application in geometric deﬁned processes
(for cutting in contrast to abrasive processes), natural diamonds as large mono-
crystals are more economic.
8.8.2 Polycrystalline Diamond
The ﬁrst diamond synthesis is said to have been successful in 1953 at ASEA,
Sweden. In 1955, the synthesis was published in Nature by Bundy and others
(General Electric, USA) [BUN55]. The ﬁrst patents for industrial application were
granted in 1960 [HAL60]. At that time, the production of smaller diamonds
8.8
Diamond
181

directly from graphite at high temperatures of 3,000 C and high pressures of 10
GPa was initially successful. Adding solvents and catalysts (for instance cobalt,
nickel, silicon, boron, beryllium and iron) can reduce the conditions of synthesis to
6 GPa and 1,500 C. Cobalt, for example, has dissolving properties for carbon
depending on pressure and temperature. Under conditions of synthesis in the
metastable diamond-range cobalt is liquid. With increasing pressure and temper-
ature the liquid solubility for carbon decreases, diamond is segregated. Repeated
cyclic traversing of the synthesis range can enhance the conversion. This kind of
synthesis generates single crystals, whose growth rate can be changed by sys-
tematical pressure and temperature control as well as by the quantity of seed
crystals (density of nucleuses). The size of the crystallites can thus be inﬂuenced in
a well-targeted way. To generate the necessary pressures for the diamond synthesis
presses as shown in Fig. 8.22 are used.
Diamond synthesis generates grains in the range of 2–400 lm, which can be
combined to a poly-crystalline matrix (PCD) after sorting in a further process by
means of high-pressure-liquid-phase sintering. In this second process, the catalytic
effect of the metallic companion is used again (Fig. 8.23). An adhesion
enhancement can be achieved by means of a cobalt rich intermediate layer. If
metallic phases are used as sintering aids, their liquidus line will lie below the
sintering temperature even in the high pressure domain.
The properties of the poly-crystalline diamond layers can be controlled by the
size of the applied grit and by the kind and quantity of the metallic phases. Grain
sizes of 2–60 lm can be achieved in the ﬁnal state, whereupon the grain size
decreases during the sintering process. The Co-content after sintering decreases
with the growing grain size of the base material [SIE91]. Consequently, it can be
assumed that larger grits have higher shares of covalent bonds. That is the reason
why PCD with coarser structures has the highest wear resistance but also the lower
edge quality (possible sharpness).

Cutting Materials

Polycrystalline diamonds are largely isotropic because of the non-directed
allocation they are composed of. They are, however, less hard than mono-crystals.
They are much tougher than mono-crystals because of their isotropy, their grain
boundaries and metallic inclusions.
Their application domain is the roughing-ﬁnishing machining of non-ferrous
metals at set conditions, which no chemical wear and cutting wedge temperatures
above 700 C occur at. The tolerable temperature is not limited by the temperature of
graphitizing at 900 C but already at 650–800 C. The reason is the enrichment of
cobalt occurring in this temperature range resulting from the volume expansion of
cobalt compared to diamond. However, this effect depends on the disposition time
[SIE91]. Metallic materials such as aluminum, copper and their alloys, non-metals
such as plastics, wood and graphite can be beneﬁcially machined by PCD. PCD is
particularly applied for highly abrasive material such as hypereutectic aluminum–
silicon alloys (pistons, cylinder blocks), glass ﬁber reinforced plastics and wood-

plastic-ﬁlling compound material seeing as very long tool lives can be reached in
contrast to high speed steel, cemented carbides or ceramics (Figs. 8.24 and 8.25).
For soft materials declining to adhesion such as forgeable aluminum alloy, it may
be of interest that adhesion and pseudo-chip building can be prevented or delayed by
PCD because of its good cutting edge resistance (geometrical effect, delay of cutting
edge rounding) and because of its low friction co-efﬁcient (tribo-effect).
8.9 Boron Nitride
Cubic crystalline boron nitride (CBN) is the hardest cutting material beside dia-
mond (Table 8.1). Unlike diamond, CBN is chemically resistant towards iron and
other carbide building materials. It is stable up to temperatures of 1,400 C. In the
normal atmosphere, a protective layer of boron oxide (B2O3) prevents oxidation up
to 1,300 C. Therefore, CBN tools can be used to cut hardened steels, hard cast
iron, nickel base alloys and to machine sputtered or welded hard layers.
Boron nitride naturally exists only in the hexagonal crystalline form, having a
similar consistency as graphite. Boron and nitrogen are the elements directly next to
carbon in the periodic system. Boron nitride can be transformed into the cubic
crystalline modiﬁcation as diamond through high-pressure- high-temperature syn-
thesis. This kind of structure has a covalent binding. There is also a further lattice type
of high hardness (but not as hard as the cubic type), the wurzite-modiﬁcation.
Hexagonal boron nitride is obtained by pyrolysis from boron-halogen compounds.

Cutting Materials

Boron nitride can be produced in various ways, differing in the number of
process steps and in the use of additives. With the one-step process polycrystalline
CBN is directly produced from the hexagonal modiﬁcation and with the two-step
process the CBN is ﬁrst synthesized and in a subsequent sintering process the grit
is treated to poly-crystalline material [KRE07].
For the pyrolysis metallic catalysts are mostly applied, where lithium is most
frequently used, which leads to brown to black CBN. The further processing of the
CBN grit produced in the pyrolysis to abrasive tools occurs in the same way as
with the synthesized diamond.
Cubicboronnitridewasﬁrstproducedin1957[WEN57].Thesynthesisrequiresthe
same arrangement as the synthesis of diamond. Pressures of 5–9 GPa and temperatures
of 1,500–2,000 C have to be applied [WEN61]. Alkali metals serve as catalysts,
which allow the reduction of the synthesis temperature to the speciﬁed range.
Similar to diamond the CBN grit can be processed to thick poly-crystalline layers
(layer thickness 0.5 mm) on cemented carbide or to solid CBN bodies by means of
high-pressure-high temperature synthesis (Fig. 8.22). This poly-crystalline boron
nitride (PCB) is available in two types of cutting material. One type being PCB with a
high content of hard substance and strong penetration of the grains and the second
type, with small content of hard substance and without grain penetration. The binder
phase contains titanium carbide or titanium nitride. PCB with a lower hard substance
content has a much lower heat conductivity (k = 40 W/mK compared with
100–200 W/mK for the material with larger hard substance content).
PCB wears signiﬁcantly less than cemented carbide (Fig. 8.26). Thus, higher
cutting speeds can be reached for equal tool life by orders of magnitude [HER91].
When machining high strength materials with slender tools or workpieces of high
compliance, it is of interest that lower cutting forces occur due to geometric (sharp
cutting edges) and tribological (less friction) reasons (Fig. 8.27).
PCB is of great importance for the hard machining of steel, particularly under
instable machining conditions or for interrupted cuts. For appropriate machining
operations grinding can be replaced by turning, milling or drilling with PCB (see
Chap. 10). Appropriate machining operations mean:
• small faces to be machined to keep form errors within limits
• limited demands on the dimensional and form accuracy
• compact, stiff workpieces, which are not inadmissibly deﬂectable by passive
forces
If these conditions are met, considerable rationalization effects are achievable
by means of higher material removal rates and shorter operation sequences.

High Speed Cutting
9.1 Deﬁnition
Cutting at high speeds has gained great importance in recent years after the
technical prerequisites were met by cutting materials, main spindles of machines,
feed drives and control. The term ‘‘high speed cutting’’ or ‘‘HSC’’ is used in this
context without having a clear deﬁnition on physical principle basis. ‘‘High speed’’
or ‘‘high power’’ are indeﬁnite, upwardly open concepts. There have been several
approaches to give a deﬁnition, going back to the 1930s (Fig. 9.1).
Salomon [SAL31] thought to have discovered a fundamental change in chip
formation mechanisms at very high speeds. He pointed out in his patent that the
load and the wear of tools are greatly reduced in this speed range. This assumption
could not be proved. Already in 1932, motion pictures made by Schwerd/Han-
nover [SCH36] showed that the chip formation mechanisms at high speed are not
fundamentally different compared to standard speeds. Icks [ICK81] showed that
high speed cutting is dependent on the kind of machining process. Schulz [SCH94]
deﬁned high speed domains connecting them to the material properties to be
machined. Ben Amor [TÖH05, BEN03] succeeded for the ﬁrst time, to develop a
physically based deﬁnition due to experimental force and power measurements.
It was observed that a characteristic force curve is given for almost all materials
depending on the cutting speed (Fig. 9.2).
Thereafter, cutting and feed force drift asymptotically against a constant value,
which in the case of the cutting force is marked with Fc?. Ben Amor was able to
show that the variable part of the cutting force can be well described by an
exponential decaying function.

Thereby, a limit speed vHSC was introduced. vHSC is apparent according to
Eq. 9.1. vHSC is seemingly the speed, which the variable part of the cutting force
was dropped at by 86.5 % (exponent-2). A plausible explanation is achieved
through the power fractions (Fig. 9.3).

According to Fig. 9.3 there is a cutting speed, which the function of the variable
power Pcvar has an inﬂection point at and thus the deviation of Pcvar over vc adopts
a minimum. This cutting speed is referred to as limit speed. According to Ben
Amor’s deﬁnition it marks the beginning of high speed cutting. This limit speed
can be correlated with the tensile strength of many practically important metals
(Fig. 9.4). The function of approximation

with vHSC [m/min] and Rm [MPa] describes the dependency on the strength with a
high degree of certainty (R = 0.984). Only some of the investigated metals like
cast iron, brass CuZn37 and manganese AZ91D make an exception.

9.2 Chip Formation
When machining at high speeds, a signiﬁcant change in the chip formation occurs.
Visible or measurable phenomena are:
• the decline of the cutting force and the other force components for all the other
previously investigated ductile metals,
• an increase of the shear angle and thus a reduction of the chip compression,
• a clear segmentation of the chip and a concentration of plastic deformations in
shear localizations, although this phenomenon strongly depends on the material,
• an unstable formation of highly concentrated shear bands, depending on the
material and the texture.
The distinct decrease of the cutting force is observed consistently as long as no
brittle discontinuous chips are formed and ripped out of the material. Baeker has
named possible causes, as they are also divergently proposed in literature
[BÄK03]. He can explain conclusively by simulation that it is neither the seg-
mentation nor the alteration of the friction coefﬁcient, which can interpret these
experimental observations but that an adiabatic decline of the deformation strength
dependent on the strain rate can fully explain the experimental observations
[ELM05]. This is followed by an increase of the shear angle as can be seen for
carbon steel in Fig. 9.5.
Independently of that, a characteristic chip segmentation occurs for metals of
sufﬁcient strength. For titanium alloys this happens at all, even very low, cutting
speeds. Ductile steels of elevated strength show chip segmentation only with
higher speeds, for particularly soft steels segmentation does not occur at all. Shear

bands can be observed in metallographic sections (Fig. 9.6) and with micro
hardness measurements (Fig. 9.7)
Figure 9.8 represents a model distinguishing compressive and shearing phases
during the chip formation. These phases alternate nearly periodically. Such peri-
odicities can also be seen on the workpiece surface, which also means periodic
force courses between workpiece and tool.
9.3 Application
According to previous experimental results, high speed cutting is not fundamen-
tally different from cutting in conventional speed domains. Nevertheless, some
effects can be used which are of interest for practical application.
With higher cutting speeds the material removal rate initially increases for all
cutting processes, if the chip cross section remains constant. This can especially be
used when machining with rotating tools. For processes and machines, where the
workpiece is rotated, limits mostly occur due to the clamping technology because
the centrifugal forces, pushing the clamping jaws outward, counteract the
clamping forces and reduce them with the 2nd order of the rotational speed (rpm).
In addition, for heavy workpieces and clamping devices the accelerating and
breaking times can become so long—and they grow also with the 2nd order of the
rpm—that thereby the idle times question the economic success. High speed
cutting for rotating workpieces is thus limited by

• the inﬂuence of the workpiece clamping with the 2nd order of the rpm,
• the necessary strengthening of the safety devices against release of rotating
elements,
• the increase of idle times for accelerating and breaking phases.
When cutting with rotating tools, these disadvantages have less effect or none at
all. As a rule, the rotating masses or the moments of inertia are considerably lower

so that acceleration and breaking procedures have less effect on the increase in idle
time, although the effect must not be neglected as the material removal rate grows
with the ﬁrst order and the acceleration/breaking durations with the second order
of the rpm or the speed respectively. Special precautionary measures also have to
be observed for the clamping of tools under high speed conditions as clamping by
hollow shaft cones.
The advantage of cutting with high speeds is that cutting and feed forces are
considerably reduced. Filigree parts with small wall thickness can thus be
machined with less elastic deformations caused by the force components (for
example in aircraft manufacturing). However, the effect of minimizing the chip
cross section is stronger for ﬁnishing operations, where this effect alone is inter-
esting; since it is (see Chap. 4)

decreases with evc=vHSC whereas A is proportional in Eq. 9.3
The power converted in the chip forming zone increases with the cutting
speed—although sub proportionally due to the decreasing cutting force. The
powers converted at the contact areas (index a for the ﬂank face, and index c for
the rake face) result with the tangential forces FTc and FTa to

and
Pa ¼ FTa  vc
ð9:4Þ
Accordingly, the temperatures rise in the contact zones and thus in the cutting
wedge. It should be noted that the energy per time unit (i.e., the power) is relevant
in the heat balance with respect to the tool, since the cutting wedge is engaged
permanently or for longer durations. The heat balance, however, is different
considering the work material, e.g., the surface integrity of the newly generated
surface or the average temperature in the chip. In this case the energy per removed
volume is relevant.
A strong increase of the thermally induced wear occurs due to the temperatures
in the contact zones and in the cutting wedge, increasing with the cutting speed.
Thus, the cutting speed is economically limited when machining steel and other
materials of higher strength. Only with materials of relatively lower melting
temperatures, such as aluminum-and magnesium-alloys, is the thermal loading
uncritical. Cutting speeds of more than 3,000 m/min are achievable.
However, such high temperatures cannot be often reached in interrupted cut-
ting, because of the cooling effect when the cutting edge is not engaged, for
instance in milling, which would then result in non-economical tool life. There-
fore, high speed milling is also used with good results when machining casings
made of steel or cast iron or in die and mold manufacturing. For ﬁnishing
9.3

operations it can be useful not to utilize the totally possible speed increase to
enhance the metal removal rate, but to use a part of the gain to optimize and reduce
the undeformed chip thickness. This allows high surface qualities particularly
useful in die and mold manufacturing or in circular milling when machining bore
holes of a bigger diameter. In die and mold manufacturing it can thus be achieved
that the share of the manual bench work for ﬁnishing and ﬁne ﬁnishing of milled
surfaces is considerably reduced and at the same time the dimensional and form
accuracy is signiﬁcantly enhanced. Circular milling of holes in the domain of IT 7
and IT 6 is advantageous because dimensionally independent tools can be used. If
a hole is drilled by conventional techniques, a dimensionally dependent tool has to
be used. In contrast, circular milling can cover a larger diameter range with the
same tool. This eliminates downtime tool cost for tool change and reclamping.
9.4 High Power Cutting
Beside the speed, the torque or the power may also be limitations of a cutting
process. Consequently, the concept of high power cutting was developed
[AND02]. High power cutting is based on four process boundaries,
• the maximum machine power,
• the maximum torque and the maximum feed force,
• the maximum tool load and
• the maximum feed speed, which can be achieved due to the drives and control
system.
The dependencies are shown in Fig. 9.9 using an example of the power limi-
tation and of machining of an aluminum alloy as used in aircraft manufacturing.
Power losses increase with growing cutting speed and thus growing rpm of the
spindle. So there is less power available at the working spindle at high speeds.
However, this is counteracted by the fact that the speciﬁc energy decreases (see
above).
Finally, it is to be noted that for a given power limit the speciﬁc energy
increases by reducing the undeformed chip thickness. These factors mean that
there is an optimum in the per kW achievable material removal rate as has been
shown theoretically and experimentally [AND02]. This optimum, however,
depends on the boundary conditions of the machine, the tool and the material.
9.5 High Power Drilling
The material removal rate cannot be arbitrarily raised by increasing the cutting
speed for drilling either. The limited accelerating ability of the spindle and feed
drives are decisive for this, apart from the technological reasons [AND02].

High Speed Cutting

Figure 9.10 shows the feed speeds (left part of the ﬁgure) achievable by the limits
for the acceleration and the jerk of a high speed milling machine. The achieved
average speeds and the drill times were measured for a given drill travel (right part
of the ﬁgure). It therefore also follows here that the rpm can be optimized
according to the given conditions (Fig. 9.11). Thereby, the spindle run-up time can
have a substantial part of the total drill time. Consequently, the number of holes
has to be regarded, which is obtainable without a spindle stop.

Chapter 10
Hard Machining, Process Design
The cutting of hardened ferrous materials and hard coatings with hardnesses above
47 HRC is referred to as hard machining (more precisely: cutting with geomet-
rically deﬁned cutting edge). These hard materials have been machined—apart
from repair cases—exclusively by grinding and brought into their ﬁnal shape until
this technology came up [TÖN81, TÖN86]. The development of cutting materials
of high hardness and heat resistance made hard turning, hard milling and hard
drilling, which are mentioned here and also hard broaching, hard shaving and hard
reaming both possible and economical. Table 10.1 gives an overview of the
conditions, under which these processes can be performed.
In many areas of mechanical engineering, automotive and machine manufac-
turing, components are exposed to higher force and power density. Therefore, they
have to be ﬁrmer, harder and more wear resistant. Where materials, particularly
steels with merely moderate strength were previously sufﬁcient, increasingly
highly-tempered or hardened materials are now used. For a number of components
the spectrum of the rough and ﬁnish machining processes can be extended by
methods of hard machining besides grinding [KLB05]. In addition to the strength
and hardness the quality requirements for highly-stressed components have grown
signiﬁcantly at the same time (Fig. 10.1). These requirements must also be met by
hard machining with geometrically deﬁned cutting edges, i.e. by cutting [KAN04].
10.1 Hard Turning
In turning the cutting edge is usually continuously engaged. The energy density
implemented in the chip formation zone is high, which leads to a high thermal load on
the cutting wedge [Sch99]. Therefore, cutting speeds must be limited with respect to
the tool wear (Table 10.1). Cutting ceramics (mixed ceramics of Al2O3 and TiC) are
applied at 150 m/min and poly-crystalline boron nitride (PCBN) up to 220 m/min,
at lower levels of hardness higher speeds can also be used [HER91]. Usual
cutting depths are in the range ap = 0.05–0.3 mm. Feeds signiﬁcantly determine the

surface quality. Depending on the requirements of the surface roughness,
feeds off = 0.05–0.2 mm are set. The tool life depends signiﬁcantly on the hardness
of the material, as shown in a tendency illustration referring to hardened steel
materials in Fig. 10.2. The maximum achievable speeds are also visible. In addition
to hardened steels basically hard cast iron, nickel-based alloys and sintered
and hardened steels can be machined by PCB [KLB05]. Figure 10.3 shows the
dependency of tool life and cutting speed in a Taylor diagram for the use of
poly-crystalline boron nitride. From the atypical curves, if comparedwith the straight
lines in soft material cutting, it can be found that a limited window of cutting speed
must be maintained.
In Fig. 10.3, in addition to the cutting speed the hardness of the material was
varied [KOC96]. Here you can see a strong inﬂuence of the hardness, with the
hardness of the martensitic 100Cr6 and the hardness of martensite and carbides in
high speed steel which tend to similar effects. For practical purposes it is appli-
cable that a slight lowering of the hardness brings a signiﬁcant gain in tool life.
In hard turning one usually works with relatively low feed rates and large
corner radii re of the cutting edge. This allows the keeping of the cutting edge load
within limits. Figure 10.4 shows the engagement conditions in hard turning, where
f, ap, re and rb are shown to scale. It can be seen in the top view on the rake face
that the actual cutting edge angle along the engagement arc changes heavily and
that the nominal cutting edge angle does not come into effect. To estimate the load

For h C rb the rake angle given by the rake face applies, although an additional
chamfer is mostly intended to strengthen the cutting wedge. With a negative rake
angle of c ¼ 6 (negative cutting insert), for example, and a chamfer of cn ¼ 20, a
resultant rake angle c ¼ 26 follows.
As a ﬁnal machining process, hard turning is aimed at the substitution of grinding
operations. In Fig. 10.5, a best practice is shown, where hard turning is signiﬁcantly
more favorable [BRA95]. A friction disc of bearing steel 100Cr6 is precision-turned
on three surfaces, an outer cylinder, a ﬂat surface and a short inner cylinder. The
economic and environmental beneﬁts are indicated in the ﬁgure.

However, a comparison between grinding and hard turning depends strongly on
the machining task and certainly not without ambiguity In addition, different
criteria can be applied to the process such as manufacturing costs per part, ﬂexi-
bility, component quality or ecological compatibility. A comparison of the
material removal rates Qw (removed volume per time) and the surface rate Aw (the
machined surface per time) is shown in Fig. 10.6. It is apparent that especially for
the surface rate signiﬁcantly larger values are in favor of grinding. The advantage
exists only where large surfaces have to be machined. It is also important that

when turning and generally when hard cutting a minimum undeformed chip
thickness exists, which must not be under-run, otherwise no cutting takes place.
This means that not any optionally small depth of cut can be used. In contrast, in
grinding the process can be set so far by spark-out till the normal force disappears.
Consequently, hard cutting processes are hardly applicable, if long, slender and
pliable workpieces must be machined because then the higher surface rates of
grinding can be generally used (Fig. 10.6).
An advantage of hard turning, which is advantageous in many cases, is the form
ﬂexibility of the process. The workpiece is machined via the control system,
whereas when using grinding it is mostly machined by plunge grinding or at least
by copying the proﬁle of the grinding wheel onto the workpiece. In turning,
workpieces can be machined by one or several tools, which are easily changeable.
This often leads to a considerable shortening of the process chain in the sense of a
complete machining, to less complexity costs and to lower investment.
Material and energy ﬂows are compared from an ecological point of view. An
example for manufacturing a center gear for a friction transmission shows the
material ﬂows for grinding and hard turning from the production of 5,000 parts
(Fig. 10.7). On the basis of the allowance of the parts a mass of 50 kg of chips is
generated per year. The grinding ﬂuid used in the required 4 grinding machines
adds up to 8 t per year, if a bi-annual change is used. In addition 20 cm3 of
abraded wheel material (depending on the wheel material) accumulate, caused by
the grinding process, is accumulated by dressing and by additional ﬁlter materials.
It is especially critical when the material ﬂows mix, so that generally the entire
material ﬂow has to be disposed of. There are technologies to dry generated chips
to a residual level of 3 % so that they are recaptured, but this requires an additional
energy effort [WOB96].

In contrast, for hard turning a more favorable picture emerges since machining
can be performed in a dry way, the chips can be recaptured without further
treatment in the material cycle. The small additions of tool material abrasion are
irrelevant for the recycling process. The used and worn tools can be disposed of

according to their substrate (ceramics) or it is possible to rework them (PCB).
Thus, the balance of the material ﬂow is more advantageous for hard machining,
resulting from the lower pending disposal quantities and the higher purity.
A comparison of hard turning and grinding was made for the production of
roller bearing rings in terms of energy demand. Compared with the conventional
production sequence, 34 % of primary energy and 15 % material can be saved on
the hard turning of the hardened bearing rings, which are directly hardened out of
the forming heat by an optimized working process sequence. In addition to the
clearly reduced energy consumption, more signiﬁcantly reduced processing times
and easily recyclable metal waste are the beneﬁts [WIN96].
To reach the common tolerances in the range of IT 6 and improved special
demands on turning machines are often provided. This applies to the dimensional
and form accuracy, the achievable surface quality and the minimum undeformed
chip thickness, dependent on the stiffness of the machine. In addition to conven-
tional turning machines with special construction as far as static and dynamic
stiffness and resolution of the position measuring systems are concerned, precision
turning machines (also called high precision machines) are used. These machines
have a machine bed of granite to improve the dynamic and thermal behavior. The
headstock can also be made of granite. To reduce thermal displacements the
electrical, pneumatical and hydraulical supply units are arranged separately from
the basic structure of the machine, which consists of frame, bed and slides with
drives, bearings and guideways.
Figure 10.8 shows to what extent the surface quality can be improved when
using precision turning machines in comparison to conventional turning machines.
In particular, surfaces in ﬁnish grinding and honing quality (Rz \ 1 lm) can only
be reliably achieved with precision turning machines using feeds of f \ 0.1 lm.
This result is due to the hydrostatical spindle bearing and thus a high run-out
accuracy of 0.1 lm, whereas in the conventional machine the achievable rough-
ness is limited because of the spindle concentricity in the range of about 1 lm.
However, applying higher feeds causes the quality ranges for both types of
machine to overlap, because the inﬂuence of the theoretical roughness, dependent
of the feed and the cutting edge radius, predominates.
10.2 Hard Drilling
Holes also have to be regularly brought into turned parts. Regardless of whether
hard workpieces are manufactured by grinding or turning/milling, such parts must
be machined by hard drilling. For case-hardened workpieces, i. e. parts with a
0.5–1.5 mm thick layer and tough base material, the additional difﬁculty often
arises that one has to drill in the hard as well as the soft texture.
Figure 10.9 shows that a limited process window should be met when drilling.
Solid carbide drills are generally applied. Thus, ﬁne grain carbides have been
especially proven. Drilling tools with cutting inserts are only used for large

diameters. For this purpose, tools coated with titanium nitride have been intro-
duced. They offer the advantage of minimizing the friction between the drill and
the bore wall and between the chip and the ﬂute in addition to wear reduction.
Under ﬁnishing conditions, dimensional accuracies in the range of IT 7–IT 9 and
surface qualities of Rz = 2–4 lm, in special cases also Rz = 1 lm, can be reached
by hard drilling with solid carbide drills. The manufacturing sequence can be
signiﬁcantly reduced precisely for case-hardened parts. It is exceptionally inter-
esting that the split heat treatment (carburizing and hardening) or the necessary
covering while carbonizing may be omitted (Fig. 10.10).

Hard Machining, Process Design

The heat dissipation is particularly unfavorable when hard drilling. On the one
hand, high power density because of the hardness and strength is generated and on
the other hand, the heat dissipation from the drill point is disabled. Therefore, the
tool heats up heavily during the drilling operation, expands and can be heated up
additionally by the wall friction and consequently it clamps. Therefore, it has been
proven to form the drilling tool with a shallow conical taper onto the shaft [SPI95].
10.3 Hard Milling
Hard milling is applied in mechanical engineering and tool making. The ﬁnishing
of sliding guide way surfaces for machine tools requires elaborate guide way
grinding machines, representing signiﬁcant investments, because of their large
working area. Therefore, it is interesting to substitute grinding by milling. An
alternative is the development of hardened strips on a machine bed of soft cast iron
or steel. However, such strips must be ﬁnished in the hardened state too.
Figure 10.11 shows wear over the feed travel of a milling tool of PCB. A
carbon steel Cf53 was machined, which is appropriate for guideways because of its
low tendency to distort. It is striking, that compared to turning and drilling sig-
niﬁcantly higher cutting speeds and feed rates (here feed per tooth fz) were used.
This can be explained by the fact that a milling cutting edge is engaged only
timewise, which does result in the thermal and mechanical loading occurring
shockwise, but the temperature level in the cutting wedge is signiﬁcantly lower.
For the choice of feed the required surface quality is determining in addition to the
form of the cutting edge. Surface roughnesses of Rz = 2–5 lm are quite

accessible. For the dimensional and form accuracy needs one has to consider that
by heating the component, by inserting or/and releasing residual stresses and due
to the temperature variation of the machine systematic errors can occur, which
partly compensate each other, however (Fig. 10.12) [BUS91].
In the die and mold industry, hollow tools are manufactured for molding and
forming. Such cavities are partially hardened to reduce wear. After hardening, they
have to be brought into their ﬁnal shape, where partially substantial material
volumes of the workpiece have to be removed by cutting due to unavoidable
hardening distortion. Here lies another application ﬁeld for hard milling [HER91,
FAL98]. Figure 10.13 shows the use of different cutting materials on a hot
working steel as used for die forging and die casting tools.

10.4 Materials
Tribologically-loaded components can experience damaging, due to contact
deformation (plastic deformation of surface near layers) by friction and wear.
Where high energy densities or mass or volume reductions produce higher area-
dependent loads, sufﬁcient strength and hardness are required to avoid damage.
Coating with wear-resistant protective layers or—for ferrous materials—hardening
are common measures to improve their tribological behavior. As far as thick layers
(casings) of hard metals such as stellites are applied the surfaces have to be
machined. This also applies to functional surfaces of hardened components,
because the necessary dimensional and form accuracy and the surface quality are
lost due to the heat treatment. The more the risk of distortion by a coating or a heat
treatment, the larger the allowance has to be provided on the surfaces to be
machined for them to become completely ‘‘clean’’.
Steels and other ferrous materials can be brought to higher hardness by trans-
formation in the martensitic region and by insertion of carbides. Dahl distinguishes
between the ability of intrinsic hardening and hardness penetration [DAH93]. The
external hardening determines the highest achievable hardness given by the carbon
content. The hardness penetration features the depth of hardening. It is mainly
determined by the alloying elements. The following heat treatment techniques are
applied to increase the hardness: case hardening, tempering, nitriding and surface-
near zone hardening. Depending on the application scope the standards differen-
tiate the following material groups: tool steels, bearing steels, carbon steels and
case-hardening steels. The tool steels include high speed steels, hot work and cold
work steels [TÖA00]. Figure 10.14 gives an overview of the material groups
according to their hardening abilities. The hardness ranges usually mentioned in
practice are speciﬁed for the material groups. At this, the underlying hardening
mechanism, namely by martensite formation or by the formation and insertion of

hard carbides, resulting from the compound of carbon with alloying elements in
steel are to be distinguished.
10.5 Chip Formation, Forces and Temperature
As pointed out in Chap. 2, high plastic deformations occur during cutting. In hard
cutting, the question rises as to whether the hard materials or the hardened metals
can endure such high deformations or whether there is a risk of cracks occurring in
the newly-generated surface due to insufﬁcient deformability. The theory of
hydrostatic pressure gives an explanation for a crack-free chip formation process
[TOEN93]. Large compressive stresses with a high proportion of hydrostatic
pressure occur in the chip forming zone due to the low undeformed chip thickness
and at the same time strong negative rake angle. The critical ﬂow shear stress is
reached without material cracks by means of the tri-axial pressure state. With these
considerations the ﬁndings of von Kármán, namely that under the inﬂuence of high
compressive stresses even brittle materials such as marble are plastically
deformable, are transferred onto the occurrence involved in ﬁne turning. In a
simpliﬁed way, the mechanism can be represented at the Mohr’s circle for the bi-
dimensional case. Using the extended stress hypothesis after Mohr, different
limiting stress states arise, whose exceedance leads either to brittle fracture,
gliding fracture or plastic deformations (Fig. 10.15).
While the occurrence of brittle fracture is determined by the tensile strength
(circle No. 1), the material breaks down by reaching the shear strength limit by
gliding fracture (circle No. 2). The shear stress necessary for this is lower if there
is tension at the same time. If, however, the compressive stress exceeds a material-

212
10
Hard Machining, Process Design

dependent threshold, a further increase of stress is prevented not by breakage but
by plastic ﬂow.
As a result of the small undeformed chip thickness, the chip formation takes
place entirely in the region of the rake face chamfer or the cutting edge radius
respectively. This leads to the already described severe negative rake angles.
Therefore, the passive force Fp becomes the dominant force component in hard
turning. Furthermore, using tools with a large corner radius leads to a large contact
length, which also contributes to high passive forces. It also turns out that the
resulting force components very much depend on the tool wear, which almost
linearly rises with the cutting time (Fig. 10.16). This leads to extremely high
pressings in the contact area between workpiece and ﬂank face of the tool resulting
in a high mechanical and thermal load of the workpiece surface-near zones of the
workpiece.
The hardness of the material has great impact on the force components or the
speciﬁc forces (Fig. 10.17). Here, the passive force is also particularly concerned
as hard milling tests show [BUS91].
A comparison of the force effects when machining soft and hard steels shows
that the global loads in hard machining are not particularly large because the
undeformed chip sections are comparably small. The conditions when looking at
the force related to the contact length FZ/lc or the force related to the contact area
FZ/AC show a different situation as illustrated in Table 10.2.
With some assumptions one can make conclusions concerning the distribution
of the forces on the cutting wedge from the heavy dependence of the forces of the
wear. It is assumed that the energy transformation and the force effect are com-
posed of two mechanisms, the forming or shearing process in the primary shear
zone and the friction and plastic deformations near the rake face and the ﬂank face
of the major and minor cutting edge, which result from the friction. These
assumptions reﬂect the real situation as a good approximation.

It is also assumed that only the wear at the ﬂank face has to be considered and
that this does not affect the deformation situation in the primary shear zone and on
the rake face. It is therefore assumed that the effect of ﬂank wear alone affects the
force shares in front of the ﬂank face. This assumption is less secured, because the
stress and strain states in the primary shear zone may also change due to strong
friction effects on the ﬂank face. However, a sufﬁcient approximation seems to be
given. Finally, it is assumed that the friction on the ﬂank faces can be described by
Amonton’s law and that the coefﬁcient of friction does not change with the pro-
gressive wear. The balance of the energy input to the energy transformed can then
be described as follows:
Pc ¼ P/ þ Pc þ Pa ¼ P/c þ Pa
ð10:4Þ
In Eq. 10.4, the power fractions P/ and Pc are composed to P/c. Here, P/ and Pc
are independent of the wear according to the assumption. At this, the thrust force

acts on the ﬂank face.
In the unworn state, i.e., sharp condition, so when tc & 0, Fd0 is effective. With
progressive wear, Fd0 grows with the rate fd as shown by the tests (Fig. 10.16).
Fd = Fd0 + fd  tc
ð10:6Þ
The parameters Fdo and fd are determined from experiments using linear
regression.
With the approach for the power follows
Pc = Pc0 þ pc  tc

Pc0 contains P/c and the time-independent part of Pa. The parameters are
determined from experimental results. With the friction law follows

Herewith, the power transformed at the ﬂank can be determined.
The cutting force Fc can also be taken as composed of a part following from
forming or shearing F/c and another part following from friction at the ﬂank face

Below, it is further assumed that the same conditions of friction exist on the
rake face and the ﬂank face, i.e., the same coefﬁcient of friction. The thrust force
and the cutting force can then be written from the normal and tangential parts, the
latter via the friction coefﬁcient from the normal force

As explained above, the power introduced into the process is by far mostly
converted into heat. With thermographic measurements the temperatures at the
workpiece surface during turning can be recorded. It turns out that the contact
determining parameters, corner radius and chamfer of the rake face, have greater
inﬂuence on the workpiece temperature than the power affecting parameters,
cutting speed and feed. The course of the workpiece temperature shows a good
correlation with the course of the frictional power related to the length of cutting

The friction power related to the contact length was derived as an indicator for
the turning of hardened steels in order to quantify the mechanical and thermal
effects. They are particularly inﬂuenced by the shape of the cutting edge and the
wear state of the tool. Figure 10.18 represents the maximum surface temperatures
in hard turning [SCH99].

10.6 Cutting Materials and Tool Wear
While hard cutting, a tool is subjected to high loading causing abrasive and
adhesive wear. Here, the workpiece structure is very important. For instance,
deposited hard carbides, as they typically exist in cold working steels lead, to
increased abrasive wear. The cutting materials have to have a high hot hardness
due to this kind of loading. High speed steels and conventional tungsten carbides
are therefore not suitable for hard cutting. However, applicable are ﬁne and super
ﬁne tungsten carbides as well as mixed ceramic and polycrystalline boron nitride
(PCB) [TÖN93].
Hard turning is largely covered with mixed ceramics Al2O3/TiC and with PCB.
Both materials can be used in continuous cutting. If, however, interrupted cuts
make higher demands on the fracture toughness of the cutting material, PCB has to
be used. For hard drilling, especially titanium nitride-coated ultra-ﬁne tungsten
carbides are signiﬁcant, as for this application PCB or ceramic tools are not
available or are too expensive [TÖN93]. Hard milling can be carried out with ﬁne
tungsten carbides or PCB.
Flank wear and crater wear are the dominant forms of wear using PCB or
ceramic cutting materials in hard turning. Figure 10.19 shows scanning electron
microscopic images of worn tools of PCB, which had different starting cutting
edge radii. The formation of the distinctive cratering is primarily determined by
abrasion. The tool life-decisive criterion is the wear at the major ﬂank face VBC or
at the minor ﬂank face VBN respectively.

Chapter 11
Hard Machining, Component Quality
For the application of components under tribological, corrosive or dynamic
operational loads, the properties of their surfaces and subsurface zones are of
crucial relevance. These are the areas of the workpiece where property alterations
will arise due to the impact of a manufacturing process. This affects the geometric
as well as the physically-material condition. Surface topography and roughness are
mainly consulted for the description of the geometric surface properties, whereas
the physical properties are described based on the features residual stress, crys-
talline structure and hardness. Thus, the hard machining alters the component
quality. We differentiate between alterations of
• macro geometry,
• micro geometry and the
• physical properties of the subsurface zones.
11.1 Macro Geometrical Deviations
When using conventional lathes, dimensional accuracies of ISO qualities IT6 to
IT7 are achievable. The roundness deviations in cylindrically shaped components
are below 2.5 lm. The cylindricities achieve values below 2 lm [WEL98]. The
average depths of surface roughness lie between Rz = 2 and 6 lm.
Hard turning on especially designed precision lathes permits dimensional
accuracies in the ISO quality ranges IT5-IT6. Circularities of 0.2 lm and cy-
lindricities below 1.0 lm are achievable. The average depth of roughness Rz of the
hard turned surfaces is approximately 0.5 lm.
Impacts on the macro geometrical deviations meaning deviations of form,
dimension and position (see Chap. 16), thus component alterations which are
generally undesired, can be ascribed to all the partial systems involved in the

process. The following sources for alterations can be assigned to the partial sys-
tems workpiece, tool, machine and environment:
Workpiece
• deviations of dimension, form or position of the raw part,
• variations in material strength,
• activation and/or introduction of residual stresses,
• locally and temporally variable temperature ﬁelds.
Tool
• compliance of the tool/tool holder,
• tool wear,
• deviations of position during tool change.
Machine
• geometrical deviations,
• kinematic deviations (feed, control),
• compliance of the machine in force ﬂux,
• thermically-caused deformations,
• load alterations during the machining.
Environment
• external heat sources (radiation),
• alterations of the environmental temperature (convection),
• alteration of the cutting ﬂuid.
In part, there is interaction between the inﬂuences. For example, the increase in
cutting force resulting from deviations in the material strength has an increased
impact the higher the compliance of the machine. Tool wear alters the position of
the cutting edge and can thus directly result in deviations of dimension and form.
Yet, the wear also generally leads to increased cutting forces and thus to deviations
of dimension and form via the compliance of the machine.
The forces active in the process as well as the connected heating of tool and
workpiece inﬂuence the accuracy of form and dimension considerably. In this
context, the tool wear which rises approximately linearly with the cutting time (see
Fig. 10.16), shows a dominant inﬂuence. All three force components increase
steadily, whereas the passive force shows signiﬁcantly higher values than the
cutting and feed force. Since the system workpiece-tool-machine only possesses a
ﬁnite stiffness, which also differs along the feed travel according to the workpiece
(correspondingly to a bar on 2 supports), the passive force results in relative
displacements between cutting edge and workpiece, which have a direct effect on
the accuracy of dimension and form. The left side of Fig. 11.1 illustrates the
deviation in dimension dx in radial direction at differing system stiffnesses cx and
passive forces Fp. In addition, the displacement of the cutting edges which rises
with increasing tool wear, also results in a dimension error.

Hard Machining, Component Quality

While the resultant force components, especially the high passive force, mainly
lead to dimension deviations, the heat ﬂux into the workpiece brings about form
errors. The temperature increases in the workpiece, which occur during the usual
dry machining, are causes of this form error. In cylindrical workpieces, a form
error arises along the axial length. This form error can be attributed to an inho-
mogeneous heating with elastic deformation of the workpiece. The radial expan-
sion which increases together with the feed travel causes an increased material
removal at an ideal tool motion so that a residual form error exists after cooling off
(Fig. 11.1, right image section).
Concerning the set diameter, a heating on the outer surfaces (shafts) leads to a
diameter reduction and on inner surfaces (holes) to a diameter expansion. At this,
the measurement of the form deviation is mainly dependent on the wear and can
rise from three to ﬁve times its original value at a ﬂank wear land of
VBc = 200 lm.
Even if dry machining is often aspired due to ecological reasons, the use of
cutting ﬂuid can compensate the form errors generated by the heating of the
workpiece. Air cooling is another means of considerable improvement compared
to dry machining [BOR01]. Should there be tolerances of 0.01 mm during hard
turning and the use of cutting ﬂuid is unwished for, then it is recommendable to
primarily process the close-tolerance functional surfaces so as to minimize the heat
ﬂow into the workpiece. A compensation by controlling the machine tool repre-
sents another option to avoid form errors. For this purpose, the form deviation
resulting from the workpiece heating has to be allocated with the support points for
the feed motions of the axes in the controlling of the machine tool.

11.1
Macro Geometrical Deviations
223

The inﬂuence of the heating is especially critical in the case of components,
which are machined asymmetrically, e. g. ﬂat prismatic workpieces such as guide
ways. The removal of residual stresses caused by hardening, the thermic expansion
during the process, the generation of residual stresses resulting from the plastic
deformations underneath the machined surface, the displacement of the cutting
edge and the increase in passive force as a result of wear interact. Form mea-
surement of the machined workpiece can serve as a form error analysis according
to [BUS91] by using them to try to separate the individual causes. A similar
procedure for the machining of thin, hardened rings is being developed in
[SÖL10].1
11.2 Micro Geometrical Properties
The surface roughness after hard turning is fundamentally inﬂuenced by the choice
of the cutting angle radius, the cutting speed and the feed (see also Chap. 16).
Figure 11.2 illustrates the inﬂuence of the manipulated variables feed and cutting
speed at roughness of Rz (mean peak to valley height) at a given corner radius re. It
is initially surprising that roughness increases with a lower speed, since the
dynamic effects decrease, e. g. due to imbalance incitement. The explanation is
that lower speeds increasingly lead to irregular segmented chip formation and thus
higher roughness.
The development of the roughness Rz at a variation of the feed f, illustrated on
the right side of Fig. 11.2, shows that for reasons of surface quality it is not
sensible to set the feed smaller than f = 0.05 mm. In this area, the theoretical
roughness Rth merely speciﬁes the conditions in an insufﬁcient way. This is to be
attributed to an underrun of the minimum undeformed chip thickness before the
contact bow along the cutting edge, which occurs especially in the case of small
feeds. The underrun of the minimum undeformed chip thickness leads to pinches
and deformations by compressions on the newly generated surface, which results
in an increase of the roughness depth Rz.
In Fig. 11.3, weightings of the inﬂuences feed, cutting angle radius, machine
and tool wear are registered based on experiment. Even if this illustration has no
universal validity, we can gather tendencies from it [KLB05].

11.3 Physical Inﬂuence
Along with the geometrical shape of technical surfaces, the physical properties of
the subsurface zones are relevant for the functional behaviour of the components.
Metallographic and X-ray examinations on hard-turned workpieces prove that hard
turning can procreate considerable inﬂuences of subsurface zones. These manifest
in altered residual stress conditions, in the development of rehardened zones as
well as in areas of tempered structure.
The reason for this behaviour are the high stresses and temperatures during
cutting as well as the high stress and temperature gradients, due to the outer
subsurface zone being exposed to considerable plastic deformations, structure
alterations and other thermic inﬂuences.
The tool wear on the ﬂank face decisively inﬂuences the properties of the
subsurface zones. The thermo-mechanic loads of the subsurface zones rise with an
increased tool wear. A cohesive rehardened layer, which appears white in the
polished section and a tempered zone located below, which appears dark in the
grinding pattern in Fig. 11.4, develop. The degree of structure inﬂuence is inde-
pendent of the used cutting material at an equal geometrical construction of the
tool. The rehardened layer, where hardness values of up to 1,000 HV (0.025) are
measured, appears white because it is difﬁcult to etch during the metallographic
preparation. Therefore, it is often called the ‘‘white layer’’. The basic structure
shows hardnesses of approx. 800 HV (0.025). The tempered areas show lower
hardnesses of approx. 600 HV (0.025).
As a consequence of the thermic inﬂuence, tensile residual stresses occur at the
subsurface. These continue to rise with increasing tool wear. The occurring

inﬂuences on the subsurface zones then correlate with an increase in the passive
forces.
This effect of the process can be explained using the following model: The high
passive forces and the accompanying frictional power lead to a strong heating of
the surface layer. The material expends; high compressive stresses and plastic ﬂow
occur. The heat source, i. e. the ﬂank face contact, abandons the regarded place at
cutting speed. The material is cooled down rapidly by means of auto-chilling. The
previously compressed surface layers are extended and residual tensile stresses
with gradients develop. The stronger the friction, i. e. the ﬂank wear land and thus
the passive forces, the more pronounced the effect (Fig. 11.5). The stresses can
additionally be aggravated or weakened by superposed transformation-dependent
stresses, if phase transformations linked with volume alterations occur during the
machining.
Figure 11.6 shows an estimate of the power ﬂux into the surface of a compo-
nent and thus the thermic load for a hard turning and a grinding process, based on
measured forces and tool wear [TÖK97].
11.4 Rolling Fatigue Strength
Structure alterations, residual stress distributions and hardness alterations can
affect the component behaviour depending on the operational load. A multitude of
hardened surfaces underlie rolling fatigue loads in practical use. Whether hard-

turned surfaces are convenient or inconvenient for this case of application depends
on the fatigue strength. The factors of inﬂuence are roughness, residual stress
condition after hard turning and after rolling fatigue load, surface quality and
structure pattern. The plastic deformation of the surface arising under usual con-
ditions of mixed friction in the rolling contact leads to a reduction of the residual
tensile stresses, which exists after hard turning on the workpiece surface. This was
detected in experiments [BOR01, LIE98]. Thus, they have no negative inﬂuence
on the rolling strength. The structural texture is basically maintained after the
rolling load, even though a removal of the white layer is noticeable at very high
load cycles. However, this is normal wear and not to be regarded as failure. For a
defect development, the surface quality is of primary relevance. A lower roughness
is especially necessary under slip compared with slip-free conditions to avoid the
formation of pitting. The formation of pitting is a fatigue of the material in rolling
contact, which is accompanied by a progressive defect development with shell-
shaped ﬂakings of the workpiece.
Life cycle analyses of hard turned inner rings of cylinder roller bearings show
that at a similar arithmic average roughness Ra, hard-turned bearings achieve a life
cycle comparable with that of ground and honed bearings. The mathematically
established life cycles of the rolling bearings are conﬁrmed on the test stand, even
if subsurface zone damages in form of white layers in the surface zone occur.

Hard Machining, Component Quality

11.5 Fatigue Strength
Another decisive component characteristic, especially for hardened workpieces, is
the fatigue strength. It reacts extremely sensitive to alterations in the subsurface
zone, since fatigue tears generally start at the surface [SIG93].
Fatigue strength is of special relevance for components with strongly-
pronounced constructive notches. Large cross-section transitions, grooves, un-
dercuts and recesses which can be found as form elements for example in gear
shafts, crank shafts or axle journals, represent constructive notches. A stress
exaggeration in the notch groove, which can lead to a weakening of the compo-
nent, is a result of the geometric notch effect. In addition, a micro geometric notch
inﬂuence occurs due to the surface roughness.
In contrast with the fatigue load, in the case of torsion and bending loads the
maximum stress appears directly at the surface, which is also where the hard
turning has caused the critical alterations in the condition of the subsurface zone.
To examine the fatigue strength of components it is common to carry out stress-
cycle experiments under a vibratory load. A number of trials sufﬁcient for the
application of statistic methods undergo a test cyclus up to breakage at different
amplitudes of the bending load. As schematically illustrated above on the right in
Fig. 11.7, the obtained number of stress reversals is applied logarithmically above
the amplitude of the bending load. The result is a straight line with a negative
gradient, which kinks to a horizontal at a certain stress value and a certain number
of stress reversals. Below this horizontal line, the components are considered
fatigue endurable.

Fatigue Strength

When loading hard-turned components by bending cycles with loads consid-
erably smaller than the fatigue limit of the material, the residual stress condition
after hard turning will have a decisive inﬂuence on the fatigue strength.
Figure 11.7 illustrates the fatigue strength of hard-turned components compared to
a ground reference component. If medium–high residual tensile stresses at approx
150–350 MPa are detected after hard turning with worn tools (VBc = 100 lm),
the fatigue strength will decrease noticeably compared with components machined
with a sharp-cutting edge. Hard-turned and ground (afﬂicted with residual com-
pressive stresses) surfaces achieve almost the same fatigue strengths at a com-
parable surface roughness Rz & 3 lm. At very high residual tensile stresses after
hard turning with even more worn tools (VBc = 200 lm) a fatigue strength
decrease of approx. 8 % can be detected compared with the ground reference. The
highest fatigue strengths are achieved by the hard-turned samples, which were
machined with a sharp cutting edge. An increase of the feed from f = 0.1 mm to
f = 0.18 mm leads to a higher mechanical load in the surface zone of the work-
piece. This causes higher residual compressive stresses of -630 MPa at the
workpiece surface. However, compared with the lower feed f = 0.1 mm with
residual compressive stresses of -260 MPa, there is no signiﬁcant difference in
the achievable fatigue strength [BOR01].
11.6 Sealability
The quality of the shaft surface is of decisive importance for the sealing function
of a radial shaft sealing ring. The usage of radial shaft sealing rings, as a dynamic
sealing element on a large number of power train components, requires certain
roughness values for a safe sealing function. The corresponding standards stipulate
average surface roughnesses from Rz = 1–4 lm and maximum surface rough-
nesses of Rmax = 6.3 lm [DIN3761]. In addition to the requirement for the sur-
face quality, there is a total absence of twist in the grinding structure of the counter
surface. Therefore, the grinding structure has to lie in peripheral direction und
must not possess any superposed periodic and regular undulation parts.
Twist occurs during grinding, due to the dressing process of the grinding wheel
or due to parallelity deviations between the axes of the grinding wheel and the
workpiece. The dressing and zero twist are to be assigned to the undulation
according to their speciﬁcation and superposed to the grinding structure. The
course of a twist constantly rotates around the circumference. The continuity is
given as long as the undulation part of the twist is at least as strongly pronounced
as the surface roughness of the grinding structure. The bigger the twist angle and
the bigger the cross-section of one or more drifts, the more the twist speciﬁcation
will inﬂuence the sealing function of the surface [KER92].
The counter faces for radial shaft sealing rings are manufactured conventionally
by means of plunge grinding. According to the current state of knowledge,
grinding in the plunge is the least problematic process. Due to the process, a twist
230

structure occurs during longitudinal turning which means also during longitudinal
turning of hardened functional surfaces. The feed motion of the tool causes a
helical twist structure, which practically shows a drift on the shaft surface.
Therefore, for a long time longitudinal turning was considered inappropriate as a
machining process for seal seats.
Meanwhile it has become clear that processes such as hard turning and hard
turning with subsequent hard roller burnishing are generally appropriate for the
machining of counter faces for seal seats [RAA99]. The hard-turned shafts are
advantageously used in aggregates, which are predominantly operated in only one
direction, e. g. engine, entrance of gear drive with restriction drive exit, axis
entrance.
However, for an unproblematic use there is still a lack of experience concerning
the inﬂuences of machining parameters. For instance, more recent tests have
shown that the different inclinations of the helical twist structure caused by dif-
ferent feeds, have no inﬂuence on the delivery rates. The delivery rate of a seal
system is a characteristic parameter for the description of the leakage proneness of
the system radial shaft sealing ring-counter surface. Higher delivery rates point at
possible leakages. The delivery rates for hard-turned seal seats actually rise with
increasing tool wear, but still turning does not reach resp. surpass comparable
delivery rates through grinding.
11.7 Post-Treatment Processes
One possibility to inﬂuence the workpiece subsurface zone appearing after the
hard machining is the post-treatment process by means of cutting, forming or other
processes that alter properties. The application of an additional process does not
necessarily have to be assessed negatively under the aspect of proﬁtability. For
instance, in the meanwhile there is a multitude of industrial applications, that
process combinations have established due to the more convenient component
behaviour, such as grinding/honing of bearing races [SCH76], grinding/rolling of
crank shafts or grinding/shot peening of gears. In the post-treatment process of
hard-turned workpieces, especially the process hydro-static rolling or water pe-
ening have a larger spreading.
11.7.1 Hard Roller Burnishing
Using tools especially adapted to the requirements of high-tensile materials for
roller burnishing, the machining of hardened steels with hardnesses of up to
62 HRC is possible. In this context, we talk about hard roller burnishing. Typical
applications of roller burnishing are the post-processes of sliding components such
as bearing studs, valve rods, shaft seal seats, guideways and brake cylinders. The

economic advantages of hard roller burnishing result from short essential operating
times, comparable with turning, a low use of cutting liquid, long component
durability and the possibility of machining in a clamping [ECO99]. The hard roller
burnishing tool can be applied both in conventional and CNC-controlled turning
machines at which the tool can be clamped into standard tool holders using a
clamping strip.
The mode of operation of the hard roller burnishing tool is based on the
hydrostatic principle. A ceramic hard roller sphere is pushed through a pressur-
izing medium against the workpiece surface. At this, roller pressures of up to
50 MPa are reached. The sphere swims on a pressurizing capping and is thus
supported at a low friction. As shown in the left image area of Fig. 11.8, the
kinematics of hard roller burnishing is characterised by a rotatory motion of the
workpiece (roller speed vw) and a feed motion of the tool along the longitudinal
axis of the workpiece (roller feed fro) analogue to turning.
In hard roller burnishing, due to the low diameter of the ceramic sphere, com-
paratively low forces already cause high Hertz pressings, which lead to the sur-
passing of the yield strength and to a levelling of roughness peaks. At a roller
pressure of 30 MPa, for instance, a maximum Hertz compression of approx.
7.500 N/mm2 is reached. At this, a roller force of about Fro = 850 N acts on the
workpiece surface via the roller sphere.
Due to the plastic deformations in the subsurface zone, tensile stresses after
hard turning with worn tools are conveyed into the compressive stress zone.
Surface roughness variations resp. the increase in surface roughness resulting from
tool wear can be reduced by hard roller burnishing.

Hard Machining, Component Quality

The comparison of the roughness proﬁle after hard turning and subsequent
roller burnishing, illustrated in the top right image section of Fig. 11.8, shows a
noticeable levelling of the roughness peaks. The characteristic proﬁle of a turned
surface remains intact.
The bottom right section of Fig. 11.8 illustrates the dependence of achievable
surface quality after roller burnishing from the level of the original roughness after
hard turning. For this purpose, different original roughnesses were adjusted
depending on feed and tool wear.
If the original roughnesses are above an average surface roughness of
Rz = 2 lm, it is possible to achieve an improvement of the surface quality of
between 40 % to almost 50 %. At an original roughness of below Rz = 2 lm, a
reduction of the roughness value of up to 30 % is still possible. This can be
attributed to the fact, that an increasing proﬁle depth also means an increased
material volume which has to be plastically deformed. As demonstrated, surface
qualities between Rz = 1 and 2 lm are achievable even in roller burnishing.
The mechanical load in roller burnishing does not only lead to an alteration of the
surface quality, but also to a modiﬁcation of the residual stress condition. The very
high residual tensile stresses existing on the workpiece surface after hard turning can
be almost abolished by roller burnishing at a rolling pressure of pro = 20 MPa. At a
rolling pressure of pro = 30 Mpa it is possible to achieve a complete shift of the
residual stress distribution at surface into the pressure area. With increasing
workpiece depth, roller burnishing induces very high and pronounced compressive
residual stresses, which reach maximum values of -900 MPa in tangential direc-
tion. The structure transformations in form of white layers resulting from the hard
turning are not inﬂuenced by the hard roller burnishing.
11.7.2 Water Peening
High pressure water peening has been known as a separating process for a long
time. However, water drops can also increase the strength of steel materials, if they
hit the surface with a correspondingly high kinetic energy. Based on this knowl-
edge, water peening has also developed into a process of surface treatment in the
last years [KRO95]. A considerable advantage compared with shot peening is the
applicability for a large spectrum of component geometries. The strength-
increasing effect of water peening lies in the insertion of residual tensile stresses,
as well as the increase of the hardness.
The cause for the development of residual tensile stresses close to the surface
zone, due to water peening is the impact of liquid particles on the solid material
surface with high local pressure peaks. A plastic deformation of the material zones
close to the surface zone takes place, with parallel strain hardening. After the
treatment with water peening, the workpiece surfaces show no traces of visible
plastic deformation. In contrast to the processes rolling and shot peening, the
surface topography and the roughness depth are not altered in this case [KRO95].
11.7
Post-Treatment Processes
233

Preconditions for the use of water peening as a surface layer-hardening process are
sufﬁciently high peening pressures and suitable nozzle geometries. When water
peening case-hardened materials which are machined by hard turning with worn
tools, the typical course of residual stresses underneath the surface with residual
tensile stresses in surface-near areas is signiﬁcantly shifted into the compressive
stress area due to the water peening (Fig. 11.9). The effective dwell time with
water peening represents ts = 15 s for hardened materials at a peening pressure of
ps = 100 MPa. The effect of the peening treatment is at its highest directly at the
surface and decreases continuously with a growing distance from the surface. At a
depth of approx. 15–20 lm, the stress course is no longer inﬂuenced. Thus, the
basically lower penetration depth compared with the use of shot peening does not
represent a disadvantage when using high pressure water peening in the process
chain hard turning/water peening, since the critical effects of hard turning do not
generally reach greater depths.
For case-hardened, ground rotary bending samples, a signiﬁcant increase in the
bending cycle strength of approx. 30 % appears after high pressure water peening.
For hard turned samples, machined with worn tools the fatigue strength drop,
resulting from high pressure water peening, can be compensated again [BRA95].
To mention further advantages of the process: minimal costs for the supply and
processing of the peening material, ﬂexible applicability to a large variety of
workpiece geometries and simple quality control by process parameters easily to
be monitored.

Broaching
12.1 Broaching Process
Broaching is a productive cutting process of serial production. Functional surfaces
of high surface quality at a high dimension and form accuracy can be generated by
a single tool stroke. The process is characterised by a high material removal rate.
A broaching tool, which carries out a straight cutting motion, is composed of
several/many offsetwise positioned cutting edges (Fig. 12.1). Special variants
(rotary broaching, gear shaving of involute surfaces) cut with rotary cutting
motions. Broaching is the only cutting process, which works without feed motion
given that the engagement from cutting edge to cutting edge is achieved by their
grading or offset. Thus, the undeformed chip thickness is predeﬁned by the tool.
One must differentiate between internal and external broaching. During internal
broaching, a tool is pulled or pushed through a prefabricated hole [DIN8589-5].
Internal broaching is typically applied for the manufacturing of proﬁled holes
such as quadrangular, polygonal and spline proﬁles, internal gearing and grooves
(Fig. 12.2). Since the tools which are bound to the proﬁle and due to the offset
(undeformed chip thickness) mostly also to the material, are very elaborate
because of their complex construction, internal broaching is only applied either in
serial production or for the manufacturing of standardised proﬁles, if an elaborate
tool can be amortised by means of a higher number of orders or different appli-
cations (example: standardised spline proﬁles). External broaching is used for the
manufacturing of plan or proﬁled surfaces. Frequently, it is the more productive
alternative to milling. Yet, a sufﬁcient serial size should also be required in this
case (Fig. 12.2).
During a tool stroke, roughing, ﬁnishing, ﬁne ﬁnishing and sizing processes are
generally carried out. The undeformed chip thicknesses can be adapted accord-
ingly by varying the offset. The strongest forces occur during the roughing phase.
High dimension and form accuracies up to IT7 (normal IT8) can be achieved by
broaching. It is also possible to generate high surface qualities of Rz up to 5 lm
(normal Rz = 6, 3–25 lm, with special effort up to 1 lm). However, the position

accuracy during internal broaching may be critical, since the workpieces are mostly
supported aﬂoat and the slender tools possess only a low transverse stiffness.
Broaching tools are mostly manufactured from high speed steel. The cutting
materials HS 6-5-2, HS 6.-5-2-5 or HS 2-9-2 with hardnesses of 64 HRC to
66 HRC are common. Due to the percussion-type load of the cutting edges, the
cutting material has to be tough enough. The broaching tools can be coated with
titanium nitride (TiN) or titanium carbonitride (TiCN) so as to increase the tool life

Broaching

travel path. Only coating processes with working temperatures below the
annealing temperature can be applied because of the hardened high speed steel.
These are PVD processes at 480–500 C. Due to their high value, the broaching
tools are reground repeatedly. This occurs at the rake face, at which the ﬁrst
coating is lost. Nevertheless, the coating has a supportive effect on the ﬂank face
and delays the wear. So as to limit the regrinding depth, it is advantageous to work
only up to a ﬂank wear land of 0.2 mm. In some cases broaching tools with
cemented carbide elements are used for high volume production. The proﬁtability
for the choice of the cutting material is to be considered.
Materials with strengths in a wide area of 400–1,000 N/mm2 can be broached.
However, it has proved of value to hold steel workpieces at strengths of
500–900 N/mm2, so as to avoid overstressing the cutting edges (high strength of
material) or smearing and unfavourable long chips (low strength).
A linearly distributed, spatially inclined resulting force acts at every cutting
edge. It can be summarised in one discrete force Fz and broken down into three
components: the cutting force Fc in cutting direction; perpendicular to it and
normal to the created surface, the normal cutting force FcN and vertical to both
components, the passive force Fp (Fig. 12.3).
Only if the cutting edges are inclined against the cutting direction (k = 0), does
the passive force Fp not disappear. The cutting force can be determined with the
approach of Kienzle via the speciﬁc cutting force kc—as stated before:

ð12:2Þ
In Eq. 12.2, the cutting width bj is given by the length of the engaged cutting
edge j. For example, if a circular hole is broached that is then the circumference.
The undeformed chip thickness hj results from the graduation and z is the number
of cutting edges. The factor gj considers whether the corresponding cutting edge is
in the engagement or not and is accordingly either 1 or 0. The tool tooth pitch ls
determines the length of the broaching tool, which is limited by the maximum
stroke of the broaching machine, via the offset. The minimum tooth pitch ls,min
results from the necessary cutting space to be provided between the single cutting
edges, an addition for the regrinding at the cutting surfaces of the cutting edges and
a rest thickness of the cutting wedge (see Fig. 12.1). A common experience for-
mula is [SCH80]

with the undeformed chip thickness h, the cutting path lw and the chip space factor c
(see Table 12.1). Depending on the material (Table 12.1), the chip space factor is
determined.
The positioning of the cutting edges is generally adjusted to generate an offset
in depth. That means that the cutting edges are placed parallel to the ﬁnal contour.
In lateral offset, the material is broached diagonally to the ﬁnal contour (Fig. 12.4).
Lateral offset is applied so as to avoid excessive wear on the casting or forging
skin of a workpiece. The undeformed chip thicknesses are determined by the offset
of the broaching tool. Table 12.1 provides some reference values, at which we
must differentiate between roughing and ﬁnishing [LAN05].
The periodical cutting edge engagement leads to force ﬂuctuations and thus to
the vibrational excitation of the machine. Figure 12.5 illustrates the force–time
course for a straight-grooved (k = 0) and a diagonally-grooved (k = 0) tool. For
internal broaching, straight-grooved tools are generally used, because diagonal
grooves are more difﬁcult to manufacture. Whereas during external broaching, a
ﬁnite inclination angle arranges for a smoother force increase, so that the dynamic

ð12:6Þ
On the other hand, all the following elements of the series are considerably
higher with a steep gradient. This means that the acceleration is several times
stronger at k = 0 and higher natural frequencies are also stimulated to a consid-
erably higher degree. In this case—that means especially for internal broaching—
the dynamic behaviour of the machine and the broaching tool with its clamping are
especially critical.
12.2 Machine Development
Most internal broaching machines work with pulled tools. So the unloaded part of
the broaching tool is long and tends to considerable bending vibrations, especially
in the initial or roughing phase. Some internal broaching machines therefore work
with pushed tools. This constellation may have the advantage that the tool is well-
guided after its clamping, but it also has the disadvantage that the tools are loaded
at buckling, which can be critical.
A constellation of interest in this context is the pull–push-broaching machine.
The tool is tightly clamped at both ends by means of a thrust rod, both clamping
bridges are tightly connected with each other and jointly driven. The principle and
a spring representation are shown in Figs. 12.6 and 12.7.
Dependent on the design of the broaching tool, this can be the most compliant
element in the force ﬂow. In a mechanical sense, the force-penetrated components
of a broaching machine can be understood as a chain of springs connected in series
from the point of action, where the tool and the workpiece are in contact, over the
broaching tool, the broaching slide(s), the base frame of the machine up to the tool
bridge. The total stiffness kges results from

That means that the total stiffness is always lower than the lowest stiffness of
one of the components.
As visible in Fig. 12.6, the broaching tool is clamped between an upper and a
lower bridge, after having been inserted into the workpiece. Both bridges are moved
concurrently.

Broaching force F acts between the tool and the workpiece. This force is
determined by the cutting process. On the one hand, the broaching force is sup-
ported by the workpiece bridge and, on the other hand, transmitted into the base
frame of the machine by the mobile slides, i. e. the push-and pull-bridge. The
system is symmetrically designed. Thus, no tilting or bending moments occur,
which develop in an unsymmetrical constellation and then have to be supported by
the guideways of the broaching slide against the base frame of the machine.
How the broaching force is introduced into the driven pushing bridge via the
mobile part, i. e. what pull and push forces develop in the broaching tool, depends
on the stiffnesses of the transfer elements. The spring representation illustrated in
Fig. 12.7 is used to determine the force distribution. The compliance of the push
and pull bridge (bending) and the ball bearing spindle as well as the connecting
rods (pressure) is reproduced by the spring constant ks. The springiness of the
upper and lower part of the broaching tool is characterised by the spring constants
ko (upper part) and ku (lower part).
Thus, only the forces F and -F act on the spring system from the outside. On
the inside of the system, Fu (lower part) and Fo (upper part) act in the broaching
tool. The forces are transferred onto the pushing bridge (upper part) via the ball
bearing spindles. Thus, the following applies:
F  Fo  Fu ¼ 0
ð12:8Þ
Under the inﬂuence of these forces, their points of action are displaced by the
small dislocation x1 at the point of action of the broaching force and xu at the
pushing bridge (lower part).
Therefore, the following applies:
F  Fu ¼ ko  x1
ð12:9Þ
and
Fu ¼ ks  xu
ð12:10Þ
Since Fu also acts in the thrust rod as well as in the lower part of the broaching
tool, the following also applies:
Fu ¼ ku  ðx1  xuÞ
ð12:11Þ
The spring constants ks, ku and ko can be calculated from the sizes and the
elastic properties of the force penetrated components. So after a force balance, the
following applies:
Fo ¼
ko  ðku þ ksÞ
koku þ koks þ kuks
 F
Fu ¼
ku  ðku þ ksÞ
koku þ koks þ kuks
 F
ð12:12Þ
So as to simplify the calculation, it is to be assumed that ks is much larger than
ko and ku
ks  ko; ku

The Eq. 12.12 will then become
Fo ¼

Fo ¼

ð12:13Þ
In principle, this simpliﬁcation is not necessary for the calculation.
For an elastic calculation, the broaching tool is understood as a cylindric bar.
Furthermore, it is assumed that the stiffnesses of the push and pull bridge are
irrelevant for a comparison, regardless of their type of drive. They are, however,
loaded by bending and therefore deﬁnitely contribute to the total compliance.
The spring constants ko and ku are variable along the travel x with the E-module
E, the cross-section A and the bar length l. Thus, the following applies:
ku ¼ E  A
x
ko ¼ E  A
l  x

With Eq. 12.7, the following results:
Fo ¼ x
l  F
Fu ¼ l  x

 F
ð12:15Þ
The force course is illustrated in Fig. 12.8.
So one can recognise that the pressure force in the broaching tool is low, if the
free buckling length is big and vice versa. As a consequence, the danger of
buckling is considerably reduced in spite of the proportionate pressurisation of the
tool. Then again, the tool is actively guided at both ends. Practical experiments
have shown that the tool life quantities at internal broaching on the machines,
according to the push and pull principle can be increased considerably, compared
with conventional machines [TÖN03].
Characteristics for broaching machines are the maximum broaching force and
the maximum broaching length. Internal and external broaching machines with
broaching forces of up to 1,200 kN and broaching strokes of up to 3,000 mm are
on offer. The drives can be carried out electro-mechanically or with hydraulic.
Broaching is a difﬁcult cutting process with high technological requirements. For
internal broaching, the pilot holes have to lie within tight tolerances, which have to
be lower than the maximum undeformed chip thickness. Too small pilot holes
make broaching impossible. If the pilot holes are too big, drifts and strong position

stiffnesses

245

deviations are to be expected. This error can also lead to the jamming and tearing
of the tool. In addition, the contact surface of the workpiece has to be at a right
angle to the pilot hole. If special position or angle tolerances are predetermined,
the internal broaching operations should be carried out ﬁrst before the external
machining. Even if that means clamping in the broached surfaces and considering
these tolerances, which are not easily complied with. Hardened workpieces can
also be broached. In that case, hard metal or cubic crystalline bornitride (PCB) is
used as a cutting material. Machines and tools have to be apt for hard broaching. In
view of the technological difﬁculties of the process broaching, all precautions have
to be made so as to avoid tearing or badly damaging the complex tools.

13.1 Cutting with Geometrically Undeﬁned Cutting Edges
The process of the group ‘‘abrasive processes’’ or ‘‘Cutting with geometrically
undeﬁned cutting edges’’ is structured according to DIN8589-0 (see Sect. 1.2), in
the processes grinding with rotating tools, belt grinding, stroke grinding, honing,
lapping, free abrasive cutting and abrasive blast cutting (Fig. 13.1). Processes with
ﬁxed and loose abrasive particles can be distinguished. These processes are mainly
ﬁnishing processes. But nowadays, the development of high power grinding pro-
cesses permits the economic realisation of high material removal rates, so that the
areas of application of the processes with a geometrically undeﬁned cutting edge is
no longer limited to ﬁnishing.
The removal of material can be a path-linked manner (grinding, honing), force-
linked (lapping) or energy-linked (blasting). The cutting edges of the abrasive
particles are thereby moved tangentially (e.g., in grinding) or normally (e.g., in
lapping) to the existing surface (Fig. 13.2). This effective motion determines the
effective mechanism: During the normal penetration of the single cutting edges
material is displaced and as a consequence of these wedge-type, plastic deforma-
tions is also tangentially shifted. Several or many such displacement processes
[SIM88] in one place, e.g., during lapping, lead to the disruption and separation of
material parts. The abrasive particles roll off on the workpiece driven by the lapping
wheel and are thereby continuously pressed, normally into the workpiece surface.
When the single cutting edges penetrate tangentially e.g., during grinding, the
process generally resembles cutting with a geometrically deﬁned cutting edge. In
principal, the same separating mechanisms occur during the processes of both
groups (Fig. 13.3). In grinding, however, the cutting edges are formed by hard
material abrasive particles at which one abrasive particle can have several active
cutting edges. In general, the dimensions of the elements involved are consid-
erably smaller than in cutting with geometrically deﬁned cutting edges. Cutting
with bond abrasive particles generally occurs with a strongly negative cutting
angle. When cutting with rotating tools, the paths of the cutting edges correspond
to epicycloids (by means of cutting and feed motions). The form of the cutting

wedges and thus the cutting angles, the cutting thickness at each single cutting
edge and also the process variables active on the single abrasive particle, such as
forces and temperatures, can only be described statistically, e.g., by means of
averages, variances and distributions.
The cutting thicknesses during grinding are so small that elastic shares in the
deformation are not to be disregarded. Figure 13.4 illustrates the different phases
in chip formation. During the cutting edge penetration, after a purely elastic
deformation (1), the plastic ﬂow of the material occurs (2). The actual chip
formation takes place after another penetration of the cutting edge into the
material (3). Apart from the shearing of the chip (4), this area is characterised by
elastic as well as plastic deformations. Compared with this, immediately before
the abrasive particle leaves the material, there are only elastic deformations and

the shearing of the chip (4). Despite the similarity between grinding and the
processes of cutting with geometrically deﬁned cutting edges, several basic dif-
ferences do exist: In grinding, lateral material ﬂow occurs in front of the cutting
edge, the deformation status is triaxial in contrast to a mainly biaxial ﬂow in
cutting with a geometrically deﬁned cutting edge [HAH63].

13.2 Grinding Materials
The usual hard materials for grinding are aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, cubic
crystalline boron nitride, and diamond. Nowadays, these hard materials for
grinding purposes are exclusively produced synthetically, because that way
favourable material properties can be reached within tight limits. The grinding
materials differ considerably in their degree of hardness and thus in their wear
resistance (Fig. 13.5). However, there are also large differences in the other
physical characteristics (Table 13.1) [DOW72]. Here, the hardness of diamond has
been converted into Knoop resp. Vickers hardness. A direct measurement of
diamond hardness is not possible with this process, in fact the hardness is deter-
mined indirectly via Young’s modulus (E module).
Apart from the hardness, the friability of grinding materials is of interest with
regard to the wear behaviour. The friability is determined in a technological—not
standardised—process by ball milling coarse grains (particle size 12 US mesh),
under determined conditions (ball mass, milling time, etc.,). The process goes back
to the ‘‘friatester’’ developed by the company DeBeers [ANSB7418]. The friability
index (breakage index) of the grinding material is determined by the proportion of
the particles that fall through a mesh with particle size 16 US mesh. Since the
process of meshing only uses one mesh width, it is hardly possible to make a
statement about the distribution of sizes and thus about the ﬁne friability of interest
for the splintering.
In addition, the index numbers for different sizes of abrasive particles are not
comparable because smaller sizes generally generate a smaller index number.
Friability indices for aluminum oxide of different degrees of hardness were entered
in Fig. 13.6 as an example.

13.2.1 Corundum
Corundum is a crystalline aluminum oxide (also called alumina) (Al2O3). The
mechanical properties are determined by the purity degree to a large extent. We
differentiate between regular or brown, white and modiﬁed aluminum oxide.
In the production of corundum, bauxite serves as a raw material for all qualities,
a mixture of different aluminum oxide hydrates which is polluted with ferric
hydroxides, silicates and titanium alloys [SAL82]. In the most frequently used
Bayer process, ground bauxite with an Al2O3 content of 55–60 % is treated with
caustic lye at approx. 250 C under a pressure of 4 MPa. The aluminum oxide

hydrates dissolve as sodium aluminate, the pollutions are separated as so-called
red mud. The sodium aluminate lye is stowed with ﬁnely dispersed aluminum
hydroxide, which as a crystallisation seed, leads to the growth of Al(OH)3 crystals.
The calcination of the aluminum hydroxide in ﬂuidised-bed furnaces at
1,200–1,300 C produces Al2O3 (alumina) [SAL82].
Melting the alumina in an electric furnace at temperatures of approx. 2,000 C
generates corundum (Al2O3). With this process, it is possible to obtain a high
purity degree. The sizes of abrasive particles required for the grinding materials
are produced by means of controlled crushing in crushers. Chemical post-treatment
process by means of calcination and washing in lyes and acids lead to an improved
surface structure of the abrasive particles and targets an increase in their adhesion
within the bond.
A very ﬁne original abrasive particle is obtained by means of the sol-gel pro-
cess, which emanates from a liquid or easily soluble compounds. The sol-gel
process allows the production of ceramic and glassy compounds at low temper-
ature. The process is characterised by the changeover of a liquid or colloidal
solution (smallest particles of the dimension 103–104 atoms, mixed with molecules
of the solvent) into a solid gel.
For the production of Al2O3 with the sol–gel process, a solution of aluminium
and an organic ester (Al(OC3H7)3) is hydrolysed with H2O and then condensed
under dehydration, which generates a very ﬁne gel well suitable for sintering.
A performance increase of corundum grinding materials can be obtained by
altering the structure and shape of the abrasive particles (Fig. 13.7). During the
grinding process, the number of sharp cutting edges per abrasive particles can be
increased, thus improving the tool life and the power conversion compared with
untreated melted corundum. On the other hand, an increase in wheel porosity at

Grinding

unaltered wheel strength allows an easier removal of the chips from the effective
zone. In addition, the feed of cutting ﬂuid to the contact zone is better at an
increased wheel porosity.
During the grinding process, suitably distributed abrasive particles may wear to
such a degree that extensively sharp cutting edges are generated. This resharpening
or self-sharpening process can be obtained by using compact abrasive particles or
particles with a micro crystalline structure. The compact abrasive particles consist
of a multitude of small grains, which have been clinkered into a large abrasive
particle by means of a bond. The process-related wear on each small grain leads to
a local increase in the speciﬁc grinding force on the worn abrasive particle. When
the bonding forces are surpassed, the blunt abrasive particle detaches itself from
the compound of the compact abrasive particle and exposes a new sharp abrasive
particle located underneath. This type of resharpening process of abrasive particles
is preferably used for abrasives on backing materials, e.g., belt grinding processes
[ARG00].
Resharpening is also transferable to each single grain by producing micro
crystalline Al2O3 according to the sol-gel process. At this, grain fracture and thus
sharp cutting edges can occur during the grinding process. In contrast with the
coarsely crystalline melting corundums, this mechanism leads to a considerably
reduced wear with decreased grinding force and temperature at the same time. This
results in longer wheel life, longer dressing intervals and allows an increase of the
material removal rate [UHL87, BRU98, MÜL01]. At this, different micro crys-
talline corundums differ considerably in the height of the initial force required for
resharpening [STA02].
In grinding processes with a high material removal rate, grinding wheels with
high pore proportions are applied. The maximum porosity readily accounts for
about 50 %. A further increase leads to a lower strength, which limits the maxi-
mum cutting speed and increases the wear rate. By inserting hollow ball corun-
dum, a hollow corundum grain, into the grinding wheel structure, the porosity can
mount to 60 % [MAH00]. Special machining processes can produce grains with
large length/diameter relations (aspect ratio) of up to 8. In comparison, the normal
corundum grain has an aspect ratio of 1. An advantage of elongated particles is the
extension and improvement of the natural packing porosity of the particles.
Grinding wheels with a porosity of up to 80 % can be produced without artiﬁcial
pore builders.
13.2.2 Silicon Carbide
Silicon carbide is one of the important ceramic materials. It is also used as a
grinding material. The technical production of SiC takes place according to the
Acheson process from quartz sand (SiO2) and petrol coke at a temperature of
2,000–2,300 C after the stoichiometric reaction
13.2
Grinding Materials
253

SiO2 þ 3 C ! SiC þ 2 CO:
ð13:1Þ
At this, the reactions also occur via intermediate reactions following the
presence of gasiform silicon and carbon compounds. The silicon carbide gained by
means of the Acheson process occurs at a purity of 98–99 %. The pollutions (Fe,
Mg, Ca) are accumulated at the grain edges or in the pores. The material is
crushed, cleaned and separated by meshes according to the particle sizes. A multi-
step washing process allows the cleaning of the SiC. An acid treatment loosens
existing iron residues. Free silicon and silicon compounds are separated with soda
lye and graphite with water.
The colour allows the differentiation of the two qualities of SiC, which are
characterised by their chemical composition. Black SiC (&98 %) compared to
green SiC (&99.5 %) shows greater pollutions of free carbonate and elements
such as Fe, Al, Ca, Mg and free silicon. The pollutions show no inﬂuence on the
hardness. However, the ductility of black SiC is higher than that of green SiC.
13.2.3 Cubic Crystalline Boron Nitride and Diamond
Grinding materials made of cubic crystalline boron nitride, also called Cubic
Boron Nitrides (CBN) and diamond are extremely hard grinding materials, which
are summarised under the term ‘‘superabrasives’’ in English language use. The
structure and production process are illustrated in Chap. 8 [BUN55, HAL60].
While the production of CBN is only synthetic, diamond can be differentiated into
natural and synthetic. As grinding materials in grinding wheels, exclusively syn-
thetic diamond is used nowadays. CBN has a cubic face centred crystal lattice of
nitrogen and boron atoms similar to diamond, which also has a cubic face centred
lattice with four additional carbon atoms [KEL80]. Different crystal forms can
occur due to the different sliding planes (Fig. 13.8). For synthetic diamond, these
range from the octahedron (111 plane) to the cube (100 plane). The diamond is
anisotropic, e.g., the hardness is higher in the 111 plane than in the 100 plane
[RAM78]. Because of the slightly different crystal structure, CBN crystals can take
up further shapes from the octahedron to the tetrahedron.
Due to their crystal structure, the grains contain cleavage planes, which they
preferably split along. During the grinding, the abrasive particles blunt. Thus, they
are loaded more strongly and split. This generates new cutting edges, which is
called self-sharpening. According to the type and number of cleavage planes, one
can differentiate mono, macro and micro crystalline structures.
Diamond is the hardest known material. In connection with its high wear
strength, it is predestined for the use as a cutting material for the machining of hard
materials such as glass, hard metal and ceramic. However, at temperatures above
650 C in the air, diamond transforms into the energetically more convenient
modiﬁcation of graphite with iron and nickel acting as catalysts and shifting the
transformation point to lower temperatures [MAR01]. Carbon also shows a high
254
13
Grinding

afﬁnity to iron so that chemical wear occurs at higher temperatures—thus at higher
cutting speeds. Both effects, the graphitisation and the chemical wear lead to the
fact that diamond is not used as a grinding material for the machining of steel
materials. In contrast, CBN shows no reaction of this kind and is stable at an
atmospheric pressure of up to a temperature of 1,400 C and thus suitable for the
machining of ferrous workpieces.
The friability test is a recognised method for the strength determination of
diamonds. It is based on the measurement of the impact strength of a deﬁned
number of diamonds of a certain abrasive particle size. The number of diamonds
that resist the ‘‘crushing effort’’ is a measure for the strength of the examined type
of diamond (TI) (also see Sect. 13.2). To determine their thermal stability, dia-
monds are thermally loaded under protective gas at 1,100 C for 20 min and then
again submitted to the friability test (TTI). The difference between the strength
before and after the thermal load is a measure for the thermal stability of the
material. This thermal stability is relevant for the application of the tool, but also
in the manufacturing of a grinding wheel by sintering [VOL00].
13.2.4 Grain Sizes of Grinding Materials
Abrasive particles are characterised by physical properties, such as hardness,
elastic modulus, density, heat conductivity and heat capacity but also by geo-
metrical properties, such as grain size and grain shape. The abrasive particle size in
grinding materials from aluminum oxide and silicon carbide up to grit size 220,
which corresponds to a medium abrasive particle diameter of about 58 lm, results
Fig. 13.8 Possible crystal forms of CBN and diamond (Source Element six)

from meshing. For this, standardised wire sieves are used [DIN ISO8486-1]. Due
to the heterogeneous grain shapes, there is a statistic distribution of the abrasive
particle diameter after meshing, so a classiﬁcation of the permitted deviations was
carried out. This classiﬁcation is standardized by the FEPA.1 A grain mixture, for
example generated by crushing and milling, is routed to increasingly tighter
aperture by means of sieves. In the case of aluminum oxide and silicon carbide, the
grain size is deﬁned by the number of meshes per inch of the meshing sieve at a
determined wire diameter. A grit size of 60 is removed from the grain compound
with a sieve of 60 meshes per inch, which corresponds to a mesh distance of
0.42 mm. Grain sizes ﬁner than 220 are determined by optic sedimentation from a
suspension. The sieve analysis entails that the abrasive particles occur in fractions
with typical distributions, which also depend on the grain shape.
The super hard grinding materials diamond and CBN are marked according to
the clear mesh width of the sieves, i.e., the index correlates directly with the grain
diameter. Figure 13.9 contrasts the classiﬁcation system used in Europe with the
US system (mesh). To extend the ﬁeld of tolerance, one can differentiate between a
narrow (1) and a wide dispersion area (2). Both systems are only deﬁned up to a
medium grain diameter of dg = 46 lm. Smaller grain sizes are deﬁned by the
producers of grinding materials themselves.

13.3 Bonding
The abrasive particles are bonded by bonding materials or bonds in the grinding
tool. The most important bonds are vitriﬁed bonds, synthetic resinoid and metal
bonds.
Vitriﬁed bonds consist of kaolin, clay, quartz, feldspat and ﬂux material
[KLO86, PAD93, COL81]. Magnesium oxide or borosilicate containing glasses
are used as ﬂux materials to reduce the calcination temperature. The charges ﬁred
together with the abrasive particles to grinding tools, at temperatures of
1,100–1,400 C maximum for corundum and silicon carbide wheels, below
1,000 C for boron nitride and below 700 C for diamond. The choice of the
charge materials allows the attainment of melting with different viscosity and
surface tension. Thus, the structure resp. the porosity of the vitreous-bound
grinding wheels can be adjusted.
Synthetic resinoid bonds mainly consist of thermosets, i.e., phenolic resin or
compounds with phenolic resins with other resins. They are converted into
grinding tools together with the abrasive particles by means of hot pressing. The
pressing temperatures are between 150 and 170 C.
Metal bonds are produced by pressing and sintering bronze, steel or hard metal
powders or applied by the galvanic coating with nickel or nickel compounds.
Bonds created on the basis of metal powder are sintered under pressure at tem-
peratures of 700–900 C. Metal bonds are applied for extremely hard grinding
materials. They offer a good heat removal from the active grinding layer, have
good form stability and show a high adhesion to the abrasive particles. They are
often used for proﬁle grinding. Electro-plated grinding wheels mostly feature only
one grain layer and are generally not dressed (see Sect. 13.5). By crushing
(pressing), dressable metal bonds have been developed by means of inserting
brittle ﬁllers.
Other bonding materials are employed for special purposes, e.g., mineral bonds
(silicate, magnesite bonds), glue or rubber bonds. The rubber bond based on
synthetic rubber is used for especially temperature-sensitive processing tasks
(knife sharpening), for example.
An important characteristic of a grinding tool is its hardness, which is deter-
mined as the resistance opposed by the bond to the quarrying out of abrasive
particles. Thus, the hardness of a grinding wheel is basically deﬁned other than
usual, since generally the hardness of indentation is determined. The hardness of
the wheel or bond is of great relevance for the grinding process. It determines how
long a worn abrasive particle is kept in the bonding formation. A soft bond releases
abrasive particles at an early stage; the grinding wheel remains sharper compared
with a wheel with a hard bond. The practical rule resulting from this: soft, less
wearing materials are processed with hard wheels and hard materials with soft
wheels. Harder wheels are also recommended for low chip thicknesses, i.e., in
short contact lengths or low speed conditions.
13.3
Bonding
257

For vitriﬁed-bond grinding wheels, the hardness is mainly determined by the
abrasive particle size and the thickness of the bonding bridges (Fig. 13.10).
Stronger bonding bars maintain the abrasive particles within the structure more
strongly and thus provide a higher degree of hardness of the grinding wheel.
Figure 13.11 illustrates the areas of common conﬁgurations for grinding wheels.
13.4 Grinding Wheels
The material classiﬁcation of conventional grinding wheels takes place according
to [DIN ISO 525] (Fig. 13.12). It contains eight codes including two free codes,
i.e., they can be freely chosen by the producer.

Fig. 13.11 Volume shares of vitriﬁed grinding wheels

13
Grinding

The hardness of a grinding wheel is classiﬁed according to the Norton scale
with code letters from A (extremely soft) to Z (super hard). The area from E and G
(very soft) till P and S (hard) is actually used in practice.
The manual scratch test with a stylus and the comparison with known wheels is
subjective and offers no absolute data. A variant of this manual test developed for
research purposes is the scratch test according to Peklenik [PEK57], at which a
scratching tool is pulled over the surface of the active grinding wheel surface
under deﬁned normal load and abrasive particles or parts of them break off in this
test. The emerging tangential forces are a measure for the hardness of the wheel.
This test comes as close as possible to the deﬁnition of hardness, however it is not
suitable as a shop testing process.
The hardness test of grinding wheels by means of the shot blasting process
according to C. Zeiss and M. Mackensen (tester of Mengringhausen company,
Iserlohn) is deﬁned in guideline 102 of the German Grinding Wheel Committee. In
this process, a deﬁned volume of a certain sand grit is blown onto the surface of the
grinding wheel with pressurised air at a determined static pressure and deﬁned
blast cross-section. Figure 13.13 illustrates the structure of a blast tester. The depth
of the developing calotte, the so-called blowing depth, is consulted as a measure
for the hardness of the grinding wheel. A disadvantage of this process is that it
does not work without damage and that the kind of load on the abrasive particles
and the bonding is not identical with the hardness deﬁnition.
Concerning the load, it is similar to the crushing process (Fig. 13.14). At this, a
steel wheel with deﬁned pressure is pressed against the grinding wheel to be tested.
Grinding wheel and roller roll against each other. The rolling depth reached after a
certain number of rotations is correlated with the wheel hardness. From the

ISO 525:2000)

perspective of the load on abrasive particles and bonding, the hardness test B
according to Rockwell (ball groove test), which mainly tests very ﬁne-grained
grinding tools (honing and oil stone tools), is comparable with the rolling process.
A test process, which provides a physical value, is the eigenfrequency mea-
surement (grindo-sonic process) according to R. Snoeys [PET68]. At this, the ﬁrst
eigenfrequency of the grinding wheel is determined by striking in the attenuation
test (Fig. 13.15). The eigenfrequency is proportional to the root of the apparent E
module of the grinding wheel. With the diameter of the wheel da and the hole di,
the wheel thickness bs, the average (apparent) density qs and the Poisson’s ratio m,

The specimen, which consists of several components, can be described only as
an apparent E module. The thicker the bonding bars, the bigger the E module. This
provides a correlation between the E module determined that way and the hardness
of the wheel.
The testing process of conventional grinding wheels is transferable to super
hard grinding wheels only to a limited extent. There are ﬁrst method approaches to
do determine the fracture behaviour (bonding, abrasive particle) resp. the com-
pliance of super hard vitriﬁed-bound grinding wheels. They apply test loads to
single abrasive particles [KLO02] or groups of abrasive particles with a deﬁned
tester [DEN03].
13.5 Burst Safety of Grinding Wheels
Grinding wheels run at high circumferential speeds. As a consequence, they are
submitted to high radial accelerations, which in turn cause high stress through the
centrifugal effect. These stresses can lead to the destruction of the grinding wheels,
which is to be avoided. So the loads as a result of the centrifugal forces and their
parameters of inﬂuence have to be determined.

Figure 13.17 shows that the maximum load of a grinding wheel occurs as a
consequence of centrifugal forces at the internal edge. In fact, wheels, which are
operated above their burst speed, are dispersed into segments with radial breaking
faces.
For a full wheel, which would then be held to a holding adapter [GRE58] for
example, a totally different stress course results theoretically (holelessness). In
Eqs. 13.9 and 13.10, the following limit has to be generated according to the law

In Fig. 13.17, the stress course of a full wheel has been entered in a dotted way.
It is recognisable that the tangential and radial stresses in the middle change
discontinuously compared with the holed wheel. They are equal, the tangential
stress reduces to half of the value of the holed wheel. However, it remains
questionable whether ‘‘holelessness’’ can actually be assumed in a porose wheel
such as in a vitriﬁed bound one.
The bursting is critical, especially in the case of vitriﬁed bound wheels. In
contrast to this, the trend is to increase the grinding speed. The following measures
are suitable to increase the burst rpm of the grinding wheel:
• Fitting of reinforcements in the highly-loaded zones (stronger bonds, ﬁber
reinforcement).
• Insertion of a steel ring into the wheel hole and creation of a pull-loadable
connection, e.g., by gluing.
• Dissolving the wheel into segments, who do not transfer tangential stresses;
however, this requires a safe radial clamp of the segments.
• Double-cone-shaped construction of the wheel so that the stress is reduced
against the internal edge.
Due to the high energy content of the grinding wheels or their fragments at high
grinding speeds (the speed effects in the 2nd order), special safety requirements are
to be observed. In grinding machines (stationary machines), only grinding wheels
authorised according to DIN ISO 13236 and according to DIN ISO 12413 for
conventional grinding wheels are allowed for operation. The inscription and col-
oured mark indicate the permissible maximum working speeds. This maximum
speed vs is considerably lower than the bursting speed vbr determined in the
experiment depending on the safety factor Sbr. Due to the square connection with
the turning energy, the following relation applies:
Sbr ¼
mbr
ms


ð13:13Þ
For machine-operated grinding with a closed working area (safe covering of the
workspace) Sbr = 1.75, without covering Sbr = 3 has to be complied with. When a
wheel is ﬁrst introduced into a clamp (mostly clamping ﬂanges), the following
tests have to be carried out by the specialised staff:
• Visual test for tears, bursts or other damages.
• Ring test (only sensible for vitriﬁed-bound wheels) for clear sound (ok) or
rattling resp. dull sound (not ok).
• Clamping in special ﬂanges.
264

Grinding

• Test run in the machine with the maximum drive of the grinding spindle,
maximum speed of the wheel, duration 1 min.
For the operation it is to be observed that porose grinding wheels are not
allowed to be ﬂooded by cutting liquid when stopped due to the risk of imbalance.
13.6 Grinding Processes
The grinding process can be described by input, process and output variables from
a system-technical point of view (see also Sect. 1.3). The input variables are
divided into system and manipulated
or set variables (Fig. 13.18). The system
variables are described by the workpiece (physical, chemical properties, original
and machined part form and dimensions), the grinding wheel speciﬁcation, the
machine (type, static and dynamic properties), the dressing tool and the cooling
lubricant system. The manipulated or set variables are cutting speed, depth of cut,
feed and dressing result as well as the set pressure and the ﬂow rate of the cooling
lubricant. In contrast with the system variables, the manipulated variables can be
adjusted to the process quickly. The evaluation of the grinding process occurs via
process variables by means of the cutting forces, power, energies, temperatures,
vibrations as well as the grinding time. Workpiece-speciﬁc variables such as form
and dimension accuracy, surface quality as well as surface zone properties, which
have considerable inﬂuence on the functional performance of the component, are
used to describe the output variables. Further output variables are wear, micro-

topography and the loading-up of the grinding wheel as well as the pollution and
alterations of the grinding ﬂuid.
13.6.1 Input Variables
The productivity of the grinding process is described by the material removal rate Qw
(material ﬂow rate, which is separated from the workpiece) [SAL91]. Figure 13.19
shows the variables required for the peripheral and side surface grinding to calculate
the material removal rate. It follows at
Qw ¼ ae  ap  vft
ð13:14Þ
from the working depth of cut ae and the width of cut ap, which add up to the
engagement cross-section Aw = ae ap and from the tangential feed speed vft,
which stands normally to the cross-section. The depth of cut ae is measured in the
working plane (spanned between feed and cutting speed vector), the width of cut
ap is measured normally to the working plane. Figure 13.20 contains information
on the material removal rates for other grinding processes than the peripheral and
side surface grinding. Generally, the following applies to other surface grinding
processes,
Qw ¼ Aw  vf;
ð13:15Þ
where Aw
2 is the engagement cross-section normal to the main feed speed vf.
The geometrical and kinematic engagement conditions are of relevance to the
chip formation in the effective zone. The geometric contact length lg is entered in
Fig. 13.19. Together with the width of cut, the geometric contact surface
Ak = ap  lg results from this. The geometric contact length can be determined
from the grinding wheel radius rs and the depth of cut ae at

For a determination of the contact length and the contact surface independently
from the tool and workpiece measurements and, in addition, independently from
the process, the equivalent (equivalent to surface grinding) radius req resp.
diameter deq is deﬁned. The following applies

internal cylindrical grinding at different radius conditions.

The geometric contact length is a calculation variable, which contains several
simpliﬁcations as an approximation. It does not consider
• the entire kinematic of the effective partners, i.e., the cycloidic cutting path of
the tool against the workpiece,
• the elastic deformation of the bodies involved as a consequence of the grinding
forces,
• the fact that the surfaces of the grinding wheel and the workpiece, which are in
contact, are not geometrically smooth but actually very rough and
• that the real contact surface only represents a fraction (in an order of 1 %)
compared with the total surface of the workpiece engaged due to the contact of
only single grains or cutting edges of the grinding wheels.
The kinematic contact length lk considers the feed and cutting speed and
assumes smooth effective partners. At a good approximation, it is
lk ¼ lg 1  1
q


; þ : down grinding;  : up grinding
ð
Þ
ð13:19Þ
at which the speed relation is q = vs/vf (Fig. 13.22). At this, the addition stands
for the up grinding, the subtraction for the down grinding. So in common grinding
processes with q = 60, lk and lg differ from each other by 1.6 %. In creep feed
grinding (vft  vc), the difference is considerably lower. Noteworthy differences
can only occur in speed stroke grinding, i.e., very high feed speed.
So far, it has not been considered that the actual contact between grinding
wheel and workpiece only takes place via the active abrasive particles. So the real
Fig. 13.21 Description of the equivalent radius

Grinding

contact surface is far smaller than calculated so far. A rough estimation of the
relation between the real and the so-far mathematically determined contact area
Ae/Ac is possible by considering the yield strength of the material [ROW93]. If the
average pressing under the abrasive particles tolerable until material ﬂow is pmax,
the following applies:
Fn ¼ Ae  pmax;
ð13:20Þ
and thus
Ae

ð13:21Þ
Tests show an order of Ae/Ac \ 0.01.
Since the grinding width or the depth of cut is generally large compared with
the occurrence at the single grain, it is assumable with sufﬁcient approximation
that the same chip formation conditions apply along the width of cut. Thus, the set
and process variables are sensibly related to the width of cut, such as e.g., the
related material removal rate
Q0
w ¼ Qw
ap
ð13:22Þ
Forces, energies or powers, such as wear volumes are purposefully divided by
the width of cut so as to make them technologically comparable.
The material removal rate is established by externally determined variables. So
Qw is also called the external material removal rate Qwa. This external material
removal rate has to be identical with the volume, which is cut per time unit by the
cutting motion—marked by the cutting speed vc—and the engagement of the
single cutting edges. The volume rate produced by the cutting motion is indicated
as the internal material removal rate Qwi. If, according to Kurrein [KUR27], one
assumes that a ‘‘material band’’ of the thickness heq is separated from the work-
piece with the cutting speed, the following results (Fig. 13.23).

the equivalent chip thickness results at

ð13:25Þ
or with the speed relation q = vc/vft
heq ¼ fr
q
ð13:26Þ
heq is a mathematical variable, which does not indicate the actual cutting thickness
but a far smaller one, since a continuous band is not cut from the workpiece, only
single grains or cutting edges are effective.
According to M. C. Shaw [REI56], the average chip thickness at the grain resp.
the cutting edge hc can be determined from the number of grains resp. cutting
edges NA per unit area of the active grinding surface. If NA is detected by counting
the grains in the top view of the grinding wheel, the following assumptions are
made:
• every grain participates in the cutting,
• every grain lies at the same height in the external diameter,
• every grain separates the overlapping volume that it penetrates on the work-
piece. Elastic deformations and plastic displacement (ploughing) or chipping of
material does not occur,
• every grain has a free contact length without any cutting overlapping with grains
moving before or after (no path overlappings) occurring.

Obviously, the assumption that all grains participate equally in the grinding
process, i.e., with the same cross-section Ag, is actually not fulﬁlled; since the
abrasive particles are generally arranged without rules within the bonding (except
in a galvanic bonding). A further-going theory therefore considers the distribution
of the grains perpendicular to the active grinding plane. Büttner and Triemel
determined the grain distribution from the concentration of the grinding material in
the volume of the grinding wheel [BÜT68, TRI76].

with the grinding material volume Vg, the bonding volume Vb and the pore space

At this it is pre-assumed that the volume-related grain density Nv is constant,
independently from z. This does not apply to z \ dg. In fact, the area-related grain
number NA increases linearly with z in this domain. In addition, the limit value
NA0 is already reached at a low penetration depth z into the grinding layer due to
inﬂuences of the free edge. Figure 13.25 illustrates the gradient of the grain
number per area unit above z

It was possible to determine the grain density by measurement with a thermo-
electric method [KAI75]. According to this, we can actually assume a constant
grain density co in the active cutting edge space (Fig. 13.26), which reaches down
to a cutting edge space depth of z & 0.3 dg. The cutting edge space depth
decreases with an increasing cutting edge density, i.e., higher grain concentration,
ﬁner grains and higher grain holding capacity of the bonding.
The determination of the grain density resp. grain number per area unit from the
grinding material concentration presumes that every grain has only one cutting
edge. Depending on the dressing process and the type of bonding and the grinding
material, a grain can develop several cutting edges [WER71, LOR75]. But even in
that case, it is possible to assume with sufﬁcient approximation that the cutting
edge density is constant, i.e., the number of cutting edges per area unit increases
linearly with the penetration depth into the cutting edge space. The chip thickness
hc can then be determined with the grain resp. cutting edge distribution.
With this knowledge of the cutting edge resp. grain distribution over the pen-
etration depth into the active grinding space, an extended chip thickness model can

be developed, based on the considerations of Büttner [BÜT68], Triemel [TRI76],
Kassens [KAS69] and Lortz [LOR75].

in any case, this bears no advantage. The number of engaged grains results from
the grain distribution with

13.6.2 Process Variables
The mechanical energy applied during the grinding process is almost totally
transformed into thermal energy. This amount of heat can evoke geometrical
deviations on the workpiece, alter its surface zone and accelerate the tool wear.
Thus, the contact zone temperature represents an important process variable. It is,
however, difﬁcult to measure due to the rapid temperature changes and the
resulting steep temperature gradients. In addition, the contact zone is not readily
accessible and mostly surrounded by cutting liquid. In principle, the temperature
measuring process can be differentiated into heat conduction and heat radiation.
The most common methods are illustrated in Fig. 13.28 [KAR01].
Due to the necessity to measure as closely as possible to the contact point, the
workpiece or the grinding wheel has to be prepared for all methods, which use heat
conduction, and for the pyrometer measuring process. Therefore, the listed mea-
suring methods are only applied in research. A direct temperature measuring method
applicable in practise for process supervision does not exist until now. It is possible,
however, to indirectly draw conclusions concerning the surface zone inﬂuence in the
workpiece as described in Chap. 15. The temperatures mentioned in Fig. 13.29 are
recorded during external plunge grinding with a minimum quantity lubrication
(MQL) and without any kind of cutting lubrication with a thermographic system at a
distance of 30 mm from the contact zone. The tests include different combinations of
cutting and feed speed and material removal rates during the grinding process of ball
bearing steel 100Cr6 with micro-crystalline Al2O3 and CBN grinding wheels.
In Fig. 13.29, the X-ray-measured workpiece residual stresses are set at the
measured temperatures 0M. The result is a uniform transfer function for different

to Karpuschewski)
276

tools and engagement conditions. Workpiece residual stresses between -400 and
500 MPa can be assigned to the temperatures. An increase of the temperatures and
thus of the residual stresses can be detected at an increase of the material removal
rate with any kind of grinding material. An increase of the measured temperatures
is detectable at an increasing cutting speed and using the micro-crystalline Al2O3
grinding wheel. In CBN grinding, the variation of the cutting speed does not
inﬂuence the temperature. A decrease of the workpiece temperature can be reached
by increasing the workpiece speed (tangential feed speed). The differences
between the two grain types can be explained with the different properties. CBN
grains have a high wear resistance and heat conduction. Accordingly, the heat
amount, which arrives inside the workpiece is lower, which results in lower
workpiece temperatures [BRU98].
The mechanical power Pc is fed into the grinding process.

Apart from a negligible rest of (1 - k1) \ 0.03, which is transformed into
dislocation energies and lattice distortion, i.e., residual stresses, this power is
transformed into heat. The heat ﬂow is L = k1 Pc. This heat ﬂow drains off via the
tool Ls, the workpiece Lw, the chips Lch, the cutting ﬂuid L1 and the environment
Lr. The main proportion is absorbed by tool and workpiece [CHO86].

A simpliﬁed consideration of both parts is useful to explain the different
thermal surface zone inﬂuences in the case of conventional grinding materials and
boron nitride (Fig. 13.30). At this, a unidimensional, stationary heat conduction is
pre-supposed and that the same temperature 01 prevails in the media involved at a

This means that when grinding with corundum, the 17-times heat amount ﬂows
into the workpiece compared with boron nitride. The grinding wheel based on
boron nitride quasi acts as a scoop wheel for the heat energy due to the good heat
conduction.
13.6.3 Output Variables
Grinding wheels wear. Grain and bonding wear occurs. The following types of
wear can be differentiated for grain wear:
Pressure softening: This phenomenon can occur with corundum, which does
have a melting point of 2,050 C, but whose strength already drops to a sixth of its
compression strength at 1,200 C compared with room temperature [STA62]. As a
consequence of the pressure softening, high friction forces and rounded cutting
edges occur, which additionally increases the chip formation temperatures. An
unstable condition may be the consequence, which leads to a failure of the
grinding wheel. The volume or radius wear is low.
Abrasion: As a consequence of the friction between grain and workpiece,
mechanical abrasion occurs (Fig. 13.31). The grain is continuously removed and
also produces undesired, because friction and shear force increasing, rounded
cutting edge in this case. The volume or radius wear is low.
Splintering: Due to the thermal load and following rapid cool-off, but also due
to mechanical load at a sufﬁcient splintering capacity of the abrasive particle, parts
Fig. 13.31 Types of wear and sharpening in the grinding process
13.6
Grinding Processes

of the grains splinter and thus produce new cutting edges. This type of wear is
therefore favourable, since the volume and radius wear is actually higher com-
pared with the pressure softening and the abrasive wear, but still sufﬁciently low
and sharp cutting edges develop nevertheless. The capacity of splintering can be
marked with the friability test (see Sect. 13.2).
Breaking out: In this type of wear entire grains break out of the compound. The
holding force of the bond is not enough, the bond is too soft. Strong volume and
radius wear occurs. The grinding wheels do, however, maintain their grindability.
The wear of a grinding wheel is recorded numerically by the volume wear Vs or
the radius wear Drs. The volume wear is directly included in the grinding ratio or
the performance factor.
G ¼ Vw
Vs
¼ Qw
Qs
ð13:61Þ
The G-ratio is dependent on the material of the workpiece, the grinding tool, the
engagement variables, the conditioning and the grinding ﬂuid among others. It
therefore deviates within wide limits. When grinding with corundum on hardened
steel 100Cr6 under average conditions and emulsion as grinding ﬂuid, a G-ratio of
80 can be expected. When using CBN and under mineral oil, the G-ratio can be
increased to 3,000 and more [GRA87].
In dimension and form precision grinding, the radius wear is mostly more
considerable. That is the local abrasion of the grinding wheel after a certain
grinding task or grinding time. The average radius wear speed is correlated with
the grinding ratio, which results from a volume balance:

Fine machining processes such as grinding generally produce surfaces for their
ﬁnal and usage condition. As explained in Chap. 16 about surface properties, the
function properties of components, are fundamentally determined by geometrical
and physical properties of their surfaces. Here, it is the question whether and how
these properties can be achieved by means of the grinding process and its input
variables.
The micro-geometrical surface formation can be described by different
parameters such as the roughness parameters Rz and Ra, the bearing contact area
ratio and others (see Chap. 16), depending on which function of the surface is
essential. Often, the average roughness Rz is speciﬁed. In Fig. 13.32, the inﬂu-
ences of some input parameters on the surface quality are stated concerning
quality. Basically, the surface produced by grinding is connected with the micro-
topography of the grinding wheel and the kinematic conditions, which the cutting
edges are moved at on the workpiece. A ﬁrst approximation as a dimension for the
surface formation is the cutting thickness resp. the penetration depth of the cutting
edges, as modelled in Sect. 13.7.1.

Grinding

With regard to the wear behaviour Fig. 13.32 differentiates between conventional
and super hard grinding materials, at which the same trends can be determined for
both, although with CBN, the alterations of the roughness parameters are consid-
erable stretched time-wise [HEU92]. The schematic illustrations show that the
roughness increases with increasing feed speed, which can be ascribed to the
increase in cutting thickness. For the inﬂuence of the cutting speed the corresponding
is valid: when it is increased, the cutting thickness decreases. The grinding time resp.
the cutting volume V0w has an ambivalent effect according to the original micro-
topography of the grinding wheel, as Weinert demonstrated [WEI76] (see also
Sect. 13.7.2). With a rough wheel, a smoothing effect shows after an originally
higher roughness. Vice versa, with a very smooth wheel, a roughing and thus an
increase of the roughness occurs on the workpiece due to wear effects.
Apart from this kinematic approach, the material behaviour is to be considered,
namely whether the material tends towards ductile or brittle deformation and
separating behaviour under the given process conditions (cutting thickness, tem-
perature distribution). Investigations on one-grain-scratching brittle-hard materials
have demonstrated that below a certain scratching normal force, any number of
long, tear-free, plastically deformed scratching traces show on the component. At
higher scratching normal forces resp. cutting thicknesses, directly after the
scratching process load relief tears break open in the area behind the cutting edge
due to residual tensile stresses and increasingly lead to brittle material separation
(Fig. 13.33). In principle, these conclusions can be transferred to the grinding
process, where a large number of abrasive particles is engaged [ROT94]. At this,
the size of the average single grain cutting thickness has a decisive inﬂuence on the
occurring material separation. Lower single grain cutting thicknesses—e.g., pro-
duced by using ﬁne-grained grinding wheels—cause a rather ductile material
separation, whereas the use of coarse-grained grinding wheels increasingly leads to
brittle material separation [LIE98].

The quality of ground components not only depends on the compliance with
dimension and form tolerances and a required surface quality, but also on the
physical properties of the workpiece surface zone. The physical surface zone
properties are determined as the structure condition and the residual stresses in the
surface near layers of the machined workpiece [BRI82]. Hardness alterations can
also provide information about the structure of the surface zones. High thermal
inﬂuences can lead to the loss of hardness or—under extreme conditions—even to
new hardening zones with underlying soft skin. Such structure alterations signif-
icantly deteriorate the usage properties of the components, in addition, steep
hardness gradients in connection with surface residual stresses can cause cracks in
the component [BRI91] (see Chap. 16).
The superposition of thermal and mechanical effects on the development of
residual stresses is explained by Brinksmeier by applying residual stresses above
the contact area-related grinding power P00
c [BRI91]. The power results from the
product of the relative speed between workpiece and grinding wheel and the
tangential force Ft. It is referred to the contact surface formed by the engagement
width ap and geometrical contact length lg.

Grinding

At very low grinding power, at ﬁrst only thermally-conditioned residual stresses
by means of external friction are to be expected. Plastic deformations caused by
mechanical load lead to the development of residual compressive stresses. The
temperatures, which rise with increasing grinding power, reduce the residual
compressive stresses maximally induced by mechanical effect and, at the same
time, lead to a continuously growing dominance of the terminally-conditioned
residual tensile stresses. The thermal and mechanical inﬂuences overlap in a highly
non-linear way so that a simple superposition is inadmissible and the illustration
can only by schematic. A lower thermal load of the component leads to a more
favourable course of the resulting residual stresses. This effect can be obtained by
exchanging the grinding material or cutting liquid or by reducing the cutting speed
or the material removal rate [BRI91].
Heuer [HEU92] demonstrates the limits of this model notion. An increase of the
tangential feed speed at a constant cutting speed can lead to higher contact surface
related grinding powers at a parallel lower residual stress level. Karpuschewski
therefore considers the heat penetration time and deﬁnes a path energy (energy per
unit path) as the effect referring to a cutting volume unit and describes the resulting
residual stress condition as follows (k: transfer coefﬁcient) [KAR95]:

Another approach for the description of the energies converted in the grinding
process and their effects on the residual stresses remaining within the component is
proposed by Lierse [LIE98]. He applies observations from the welding and laser
technology, at which the contact time on the surface is directly considered for the
calculation of a contact area-related energy and uses the parameter

during his investigations on mechanic and thermal effects in grinding of technical
ceramics.
The thermal workpiece damage in grinding machining is inﬂuenced by the
settings of the adjustment and system variables. Not only the primary process
variables inﬂuence the thermo-physical processes while grinding. Also variables,
which inﬂuence the grinding wheel topography decisively and thus also the
described elementary processes during cutting, act on the development of thermal
damages [BRI91]. This is also detectable for the used cutting ﬂuids and their
adjustment variables [GRA87, HEU92].
Basically it can be determined that any change in the contact zone between
grinding wheel and workpiece affects the developing surface zone inﬂuence. Each
one of these factors inﬂuences either the heat produced by cutting or the occurring
forces resp. the heat distribution and thus causes a different inﬂuence, which can be
determined by the developing residual stresses [BRI91]. For the layout of a
13.6
Grinding Processes
283

grinding process, it is necessary to avoid residual tensile stresses so as not to
inﬂuence the functional behaviour of the components negatively (see Chap. 14).
In the following, the inﬂuence of important adjustment variables of the grinding
process on the residual stress development in the machined workpiece will be
described. At this, exclusively residual stresses parallel to the grinding direction
will be consulted, since these mostly show bigger amounts in the direction of
residual tensile stresses and are therefore considered more critical for the com-
ponent behaviour [HAU80]. In Fig. 13.34, the residual stresses at the workpiece
surface are illustrated for different related material removal rates via the cutting
speed and the residual stress depth curves for different speed ratios. In the case of
both large related material removal rates illustrated, an increase in the cutting
speed leads to a drop of the measured residual stresses. For the low set material
removal rate, residual compressive stresses exist for all conditions. The formerly
discussed reduction of the cutting thickness and thus of the grinding forces at an
increase of the cutting speed leads to a reduction of the residual stresses remaining
on the workpiece surface for high related material removal rates. Although
the cutting power necessary for cutting increases together with the increase of the
cutting speed, the higher thermal power apparently does not have an effect on the
residual stresses in the considered area.
The thermal and mechanical inﬂuence on the component material due to the
grinding is not only limited to the immediate surface. According to the type and
extent of the load, it has a varying depth effect [TÖN65]. For the evaluation of a
grinding process, an analysis of this effect is of special interest, since higher
residual stresses might exist below the surface, which means a strong damage of
the component. For the interpretation of grinding processes it is necessary to

Grinding

possess knowledge of the depth effect of the adjustment variables. The inﬂuence of
different speed conditions at a constant material removal rate can be gathered from
the right part of Fig. 13.34. A higher speed ratio is achieved by reducing the
workpiece rpm at the same cutting speed. As a consequence, the residence time of
the heat produced by cutting is shorter than in the case of low speed conditions.
The effect is clearly visible in the picture. The longer heat effective time leads to
higher residual compressive stresses with a higher depth effect in the workpiece
[CZE99].
The residual stress depth courses of different related material removal rates are
illustrated in Fig. 13.35. At a low material removal rate of Q0w = 2 mm3/mms,
residual compressive stresses occur at the surface. The depth effects of these
mainly mechanically-conditioned residual stresses are but very low and amount to
approx. 15 lm. The stress course shows a high gradient until the surface zone
inﬂuenced by the compressive stress and then adopts the residual stress parameters
of the basic compound. The hardness depth course and the grinding pattern of this
sample also correspond to that of the undamaged basic compound.
At an increase of the related material removal rates to Q0w = 10 mm3/mms, the
inﬂuence of the thermal load prevails compared with the mechanical load compo-
nent. Only residual tensile stresses in the material are measured. The residual stress
course drops from about 200 MPa residual tensile stresses at the surface about
linearly to the condition of the basic compounds. The higher temperature introduced
into the workpiece at this material removal rate leads to residual tensile stresses at
the workpiece surface with a depth effect of 20 lm. In the micrograph, some
annealing texture is recognisable at the workpiece edge and the measured hardness
variables in the edge zone are lower than that of the undamaged original texture.
By means of an additional increase of the heat generated in the grinding process
by a material removal rate of Q0w = 20 mm3/mms, the heat effective depths and
the maximum values of the residual tensile stresses increase considerably.

13.6
Grinding Processes
285

The radial spreading of the annealing texture rises analogically to the heat
development. Due to the temperature effect, an annealing of the hardened texture
occurs, which loses hardness because of the temperature-conditioned texture
transformation. The temperature produced by the grinding process reaches values,
which lead to the development of rehardening zones. An increase in hardness due
to the rehardening is not detectable in the hardness course, since this zone is
limited to few lm of depth. A measurement of the material hardness in this small
area is not feasible.
13.7 Conditioning of Grinding Tools
13.7.1 Basics
Wear by splintering or break out of particles or wear caused by bonding erosion
leads to the resharpening of grinding tools. This effect may be desired for rough
grinding so as to avoid a conditioning of the tool. However, in ﬁnishing and ﬁne
grinding, conditioning is generally indispensable (E. Saljé: ‘‘If you cannot con-
dition, you might as well not even start grinding’’.). The conditioning can serve
three purposes (Fig. 13.36) [SPU89].
Proﬁling: This is about the restoration or new generation of a grinding wheel
contour. If the cylindricity or the concentricity get lost or waves develop on the
active grinding surface due to the wear of a grinding wheel, proﬁling becomes
necessary, i.e., in this case a cylindric surface is generated. By proﬁling, even non-
cylindric tool shapes can be generated for proﬁle grinding. Proﬁling acts macro-
geometrically.
Sharpening: If grinding tools are no longer suitable for grinding due to rounded
cutting edges or loading (clogging of the chip spaces), sharpening can generate a
new layer of particles or cutting edges. Sharpening acts micro-geometrically.

grinding wheels (according to
G. Spur)

13
Grinding

Cleaning: Cleaning removes residue consisting of workpiece and tool material
or cutting liquid deposits. Cleaning does not alter the topography of the grinding
tool; neither the particles nor the bonding are removed.
Proﬁling and sharpening together are also called dressing. Since in ﬁnishing or
ﬁne grinding the chip formation all the resulting effective parameters depend
decisively on the dressing, i.e., the type and the adjustment parameters of this
process, a grinding process can never be regarded by itself but must always be seen
as a combination of conditioning/dressing and grinding.
Figure 13.37 illustrates dressing processes, which are distinguishable according
to their kinematic resp. form generation [KAI09].
Grinding wheels can be dressed with rotatory and non-rotatory, ﬁxed tools
(Fig. 13.37). A second aspect of order is the type of shape generation. We dis-
tinguish form dressing, i.e., the controlled operation of the dressing tool, and
proﬁle dressing, at which the dressing tool receives the contour of the proﬁle by
copying.
Dressing tools can be handled with one or several cutting edges (consisting of
one or several particles) (Fig. 13.38). The illustration shows the typical application
of the Diaform process, at which the proﬁle of the grinding wheel is generated by
the controlled dressing of single diamonds.
The cutting elements consist of artiﬁcial or natural diamonds and are cased in a
metal matrix. These diamonds can be coarse, form-cut or exist in another geo-
metrically deﬁned condition. They can be arranged in a stochastic distribution or
according to a deﬁned pattern on cylinder-, board- or slice-shaped carriers.
Form rolls are rotating dressers studded with diamonds at the circumference
(Fig. 13.39). They are bi- or triaxially controlled so as to generate the wheel
proﬁle. Due to their multi-studding with diamonds, their durability is considerably
higher than that of a single diamond. An additional advantage is that they are
Fig. 13.37 Dressing process (according to Dr. Kaiser GmbH, Celle)
13.7
Conditioning of Grinding Tools
287

largely independent from the proﬁle to be generated. Therefore, they are suitable
for small and medium-sized series. For large series, rotating proﬁle tools, diamond
proﬁle rolls are used (Fig. 13.40). They bear the contour of the wheel proﬁle. Due
to the mostly necessary high-precision machining of such proﬁle rolls and because
of the entirely circumferential diamondization they are expensive, but do have a
high durability and permit short dressing times, since only a short radial infeed is
required.

Grinding

Further differentiating factors for dressing tools are the deployed bonding
systems (electro-plating or sintering bonds), the possibilities of diamondization
(stochastic distribution by spreading, regular distribution by hand setting and one-
or multi-layer tools) and the number of diamonds on the dresser in carat per cubic
millimeter determined by the coating density. The properties of dressing tools, the
inﬂuences of the adjustment parameters during dressing and practical deployment
recommendations are clearly compiled by Minke [MIN99].
Basically, dressing corresponds to turning (Fig. 13.41). With the dressing feed
fad and the intervention width apd, an overlapping ratio Ud can be deﬁned as
Ud ¼ apd

The effective parameters can be inﬂuenced in large areas with the degree of
overlapping (overlap ratio) (Fig. 13.38), since the effective roughness of the active
grinding surface and thus the number of active cutting edges of the grinding tool
are strongly altered. The effective roughness Rts is used to describe the cutting
edge space topography of a grinding wheel. To determine this parameter, a test
workpiece with ﬁxed parameters is machined with the grinding wheel. The
maximum roughness measured on the test workpiece produce the effective
roughness of the grinding wheel [SCH68]. The effective roughness Rts of the
grinding wheel is
Rts ¼ f2
ad

ð13:71Þ
A higher degree of overlapping generates more active cutting edges with lower
roughnesses on the workpiece. The forces and required power rise.
13.7.2 Conditioning of Conventional Grinding
Conventional grinding tools can generally be proﬁled and sharpened at the same
time by the dressing tools shown in Fig. 13.37. The inﬂuence of the set conditions
continuously gets lost with increasing grinding duration. The active cutting space
of the grinding wheel changes due the occurring wear. The connected effects on
the effective roughness of the grinding wheel at differently related material
removal rates and dressing conditions for a ﬁxed dresser are illustrated in
Fig. 13.42. Depending on the initial effective roughness Rt,s0 of the grinding wheel
caused by the dressing, with increasing grinding time, the grinding wheel tends
towards a stationary roughness, which is independent from the dressing conditions.
The upper part of the picture shows that at a constant roughness of the grinding
wheel, with deployment time, different ﬁnal roughnesses develop due to a wear-
conditioned alteration of the cutting area. Vice versa, the lower part of the picture
shows that, with deployment time, the initial roughness is altered and tends
towards a stationary value. The cutting area of the grinding wheel quasi loses its
memory [WEI76]. For the practical use in serial production it is of interest that a
290
13
Grinding

steady grinding result can be obtained by means of the dressing strategy by hitting
the stationary roughness already when dressing. On the other hand, very different
roughnesses can be achieved in small batch production with the same wheel (grit
size) due to the dressing [VER79].
The dressing of conventional grinding wheels with rotating tools is frequently
used to condition proﬁle wheels. At this, it is possible to work with a diamond
studded dressing wheel analogue to the dressing with a single-grain diamond, at
which the wheel has to be path-controlled in at least two axis or the proﬁle to be
generated contained in a diamond proﬁle roll. The latter process is generally
deployed in large serial production due to the high costs for the proﬁle roll.
Figure 13.43 illustrates the dependence of the initial effective roughnesses Rt,s0 of
the grinding wheel proﬁle achievable when dressing with proﬁle rolls depending
on the two parameters dressing speed ratio and radial dressing feed per rotation of
the grinding wheel.
During the dressing process, the diamonds of the roll move in relation to the
grinding wheel on cycloidic paths. At this, the shape of the curves depends on the
speed ratio. If the diamond grains penetrate more steeply into the grinding wheel,
the roughness of the grinding wheel increases. In same direction (qd [ 0), strongly
bent paths develop in the area of the contact point, whereas the paths are elongated
in the counter direction (qd \ 0). Analogue to these bends, greater effective
roughnesses appear in the counter direction than in the same direction [SCH68].
With rising parameters for the radial dressing feed, the initial effective roughness
also increases, whereas the roughness course maintains its basic tendency above
Fig. 13.42 Effective roughness depending on the related cutting volume for different adjustment
parameters (according to K. Weinert)
13.7
Conditioning of Grinding Tools
291

the feed speed ratio. In the case of the dressing speed ratio qd = 1, a rolling-off
(crushing) takes place between the grinding wheel and the diamond roll. At this,
the abrasive particles and the bonding at the circumference of the grinding wheel
are crushed and the initial roughness reaches a maximum parameter. In contrast, at
the ratio qd = 0, the diamonds of the roll cause pronounced marks, which only
cover each other slightly in axial direction. A high waviness appears in axial
direction, which is the cause for the roughness increase [SCH73].
13.7.3 Conditioning of Super Hard Grinding Wheels
While proﬁling and dressing is carried out in one step with conventional grinding
materials, super hard grinding wheels frequently require consecutively operated
processes, because generally a sufﬁcient exposure of abrasive particles concerning
the bonding level of the grinding wheel cannot be achieved due to the proﬁling
process [TÖN79].
The processes for proﬁling are partitioned into proﬁling tools, which can either
contain diamonds or not (Fig. 13.44) [FRI99]. For the proﬁling of linear proﬁles,
proﬁling with silicon carbide (SiC) roll is a common and economic process. The
relative speed between proﬁling roll and grinding causes a mechanical abrasion. At
this, the drive of the SiC roll occurs either by friction of the effective partners and
is decelerated by means of a centrifugal force brake or the proﬁling unit possesses
its own drive. In crushing, a steel or hard metal roll is deployed as a form or proﬁle
tool. The crushing roll is then pressed against the grinding wheel axially parallel
and carried along by friction, at which no relative speed vrel should occur between
Fig. 13.43 Inﬂuence of the dressing conditions on the initial effective roughness in case of
diamond proﬁle rolls (according to Schmitt)
292
13
Grinding

the effective partners. Vitriﬁed or especially crushable (sufﬁciently brittle) metal
bondings are necessary for this process. The use of tools containing diamonds
allows a proﬁle-representing (diamond proﬁle roll) as well as a path-controlled
(diamond form roll) proﬁling. Since the contact with the grinding wheel bonding
reduces the durability of diamond dressing tools, it is generally recommendable to
sharpen the grinding layer at the same time [TÖN75]. Point-crushing is a process,
which is based on the engagement conditions of dressing with a form roll and the
effective mechanisms of crushing. At this, the abrasive wear on the dressing tool is
reduced by directing the relative speed between the effective partners towards zero
or at least to a minimum.
Nowadays, rotating diamond dressing tools are increasingly used for the
dressing of grinding wheels with vitriﬁed bonding. The deployment of ﬁxed
dressing tools is irrelevant for super hard grinding wheels (especially diamond)
due to the high wear. The dressing processes for super hard grinding wheels can be
differentiated into abrasive processes and processes, which are based on the effect
of electric current (Fig. 13.44).
The functional principle of dressing with a dressing block, also called block
dressing, is based on the use of a bar-shaped dressing tool made of corundum or
silicon carbide in vitriﬁed or synthetic resin bonds. At this, the bonding material is
set back due to the abrasive effect of the dressing material and the outermost
abrasive particles are exposed.
In the so-called blast dressing process, a blasting material made of loose
corundum or silicon carbide grain is blast onto the grinding surface with a bearing
liquid (generally cutting liquid). At this, the targeted grain exposure occurs via the
type and amount of dressing material as well as through the effective angle of the
abrasive jet [UHL93].
Fig. 13.44 Proﬁling and dressing processes for super hard grinding wheels
13.7
Conditioning of Grinding Tools
293

Apart from the abrasive processes, dressing with electrolyte is becoming
increasingly important for the dressing of very ﬁne-grained diamond grinding
wheels. For in-process dressing, it is called ELID-grinding [TIO90, OHM95]. The
basic principle is based on the anodic ablation of bonding material in an elec-
trolytic reaction. The grinding wheel, which is charged with a direct current via a
brush system, represents the anode in this process. The gap between anode and
cathode is ﬁlled with an electrolytic liquid and by means of the applied high-
frequently pulsed operating current, electro-chemical ablation of the bonding
material in the grinding layer takes place.
Another process based on the effect of electric current is contact erosion or
electric erosion. The basic requirement for the deployment of dressing technology
is an electrically-conductive bonding material. An electrode of conductive mate-
rial, which is cut by the embedded grains, is fed to the grinding layer. Due to the
applied stress, an electric ﬁeld extends between the electrode and the grinding
layer [FAL98], at which ﬁeld distortions occur due to the cut electrode particles.
Field exaggerations develop, which allow for a spark discharge between the
electrode and the bonding material of the grinding wheels and, at this, cause a
thermal ablation of the bonding material [FRI99].
Considering the timely order, we can differentiate between pre- and in-process
dressing, i.e., the dressing takes place at the same time as the grinding process. The
effects of the in-process dressing by means of a dressing block are illustrated in
Fig. 13.45 in the machining of ceramic. The dressing process without the
deployment of in-process dressing technology is characterised by increasing
dressing forces, which can be attributed to the effective wear mechanisms such as
clogging and grain blunting.

Grinding

The use of in-process block dressing can minimise the inﬂuences of the wear
mechanisms. Depending on the selected block dressing material removal rate QdsB,
stationary dressing force courses develop after an infeed phase. An increase of
QdsB and thus an increase of the dressing intensity lead to a reduction of the
dressing force level.
13.8 Grinding Costs
Grinding is a ‘‘twin process’’, i.e., apart from the actual grinding process, the
dressing also has to be considered regarding the costs.
The grinding costs per unit are then
KF ¼ Kmach þ KT þ Kd
ð13:72Þ
with
Kmach
machine costs incl. wages (space costs)
KT
costs of grinding tool per piece
Kd
costs for dressing calculated per piece.
The machine costs result from the machine time rate plus labour costs [TÖN95]
(space costs per time unit ksp) and the total time ttot. = th ? tn from main and
secondary time [DEN10]
Kmach ¼ ksp  ðth þ tnÞ
ð13:73Þ
The main time/operating time th can be detected via the radial feed speed (in
plunge grinding) and the oversize or from the volume to be ground Vw and the
material removal rate Qw. Subsequently, the wheel volume worn during the
grinding process Vs results from the grinding ratio G = Vw/Vs deﬁned above
KT ¼ Vs  ks
ð13:74Þ
with the wheel costs per volume unit ks. Then the dressing costs Kd are added.
These are
Kd ¼ ðkpl  ttot;d þ Vs;d  kdÞ=n þ KT;d=n
ð13:75Þ
with the total dressing time ttot,d, the wheel volume lost by dressing Vs,d, and the
dressing material worn due to the dressing KT,d. To collect the proportion falling
upon one piece, we must divide by the quantity n, that means by the number of
pieces up to the next dressing cycle.

295

in a two-step operation (roughing at vfr = 1.5 mm/min, ﬁnishing at vfr = 0.25
mm/min) The wheel life quantity up to the dressing is to be 15 pieces.
Together with practical data, the following costs result per workpiece:
KF = 4.10 € with the portions: Kmach/KF = 0.90, KT/KF = 0.08, Kd/KF = 0.02.
If the same task is machined with a super hard grinding wheel on CBN basis,
the cost for the tool rises to approx. 15 %, the grinding time and thus the machine-
dependent costs Kmach decrease, possibly over-proportionally less.

Chapter 14
Gear Grinding
14.1 Introduction
The hard ﬁnishing of gears with involute ﬂanks is examined here as an example for
the ﬁnishing of highly-loaded complex surfaces. Gears are among the most
important machine elements in engineering and vehicle construction. They are
produced in several steps. Soft machining, which includes turning, hobbing or gear
shaping processes, is followed by a heat treatment because the speciﬁc loads of
gears are increased due to space and mass reduction and so the hardness and
strength of the functional surfaces have to be increased. The hardness distortions
resulting from the heat treatment as well as the required surface zone and surface
properties lead to the fact that the hardening process is followed by a ﬁnishing,
mostly a grinding process (Fig. 14.1).
The quality of a tooth is mainly determined by the generation of the involute
ﬂank. In batch production, hard ﬁnishing processes are becoming increasingly
important for the completion of the gear. The reasons for this are
• apart from the higher speciﬁc load and the increased requirements concerning
strength,
• the rising signiﬁcance of a reduced noise emission by the gear as well as,
• the enhancement of near-net-shape technologies by means of forming and pri-
mary shaping (e.g., casting) processes [BEH97].
Among others, the most frequent forms of damage to gears are surface damages
of the tooth ﬂank, such as gray spots or pit marks. They develop over a longer
period of time and can generally be attributed to material fatigue. At this, material
particles break out of the tooth ﬂank. With an increasing damage to the surface,
cracks can occur resulting in a tooth breakage. The so-called fatigue fracture
develops as a consequence of repetitive changing loads. At this, a slight crack
appears at the point with the highest load (mostly the tooth root), which grows with
continued load up to the point where the remaining rest cross section is no longer
able to transfer the load [DIN3979]. Tooth breakages often lead to a total gear
failure and may be connected with enormous costs.

The described damage developments can be inﬂuenced by grinding in a tar-
geted way. Investigations have shown that high residual compressive stresses and
low roughness values in the entire tooth gap as well as large bending radii in the
tooth root range have a positive effect on the fatigue life of the gears. Production-
conditioned damages to the gear, which are often accompanied by residual tensile
stresses and crack development in the surface zone of the tooth gap, can be
avoided by a precise process design [STE04, SCH07, HER08, BRE08, KAG02].
When designing the grinding processes, the points of maximum material
removal rates have to be observed, since the material removal rate directly affects
the important output parameters of the process in gear grinding, too. At a rising
material removal rate, the roughness Rz decreases. This is to be attributed to
increased wear and a blunting of the abrasive particles. Accordingly, the grinding
power also increases. The converted energy per removed volume and thus the
temperature in the surface zone of the tooth ﬂank rises with the smoothing of the
micro-topography of the grinding wheel. The consequence is generally a reduction
of residual compressive stresses as illustrated in Fig. 14.2 as an example for dis-
continuous proﬁle grinding. At a further increase of the material removal rate, the
abrasive particles splinter and break out, which leads to an increased roughness.
This in turn, is accompanied by an alteration of the grinding wheel proﬁle and
leads to geometrical deviations on the workpiece.
After it has become possible to considerably reduce engine noises in a vehicle
by means of primary and secondary noise reduction measures, gear noises are now
in the foreground. Customer demands concerning comfort, force the tooth man-
ufacturers to further increase the gear quality. This can be reached with the
grinding process (Fig. 14.3) [SCH94]. Apart from the reduction of deviations and
wavinesses along the involute, the targeted generation of tooth ﬂank modiﬁcations
bears a special signiﬁcance. The established corrections include convexities in
Fig. 14.1 Production sequences of gear production in large batch production (according to
Bausch)

Gear Grinding

height and width direction of the tooth ﬂank as well as upper edge chamfering and
tooth root relief-cutting (protuberance). They are generated by targeted alterations
of the tool proﬁle as well as the machining kinematic.
In connection with the noise emission, the micro-structure of the tooth ﬂank
also gains a high signiﬁcance. While the surface roughness is primarily inﬂuenced
by the speciﬁcation of the grinding wheel (grain, bonding), the arrangement of the
grinding grooves is to be attributed to the process-innate kinematic. For example,
the grinding groove proﬁle typical for crossed helical grinding is ascribed an
especially beneﬁcial noise behavior. In industrial practice, strategies have been

developed to interrupt the continuous grinding grooves in continuous generating
grinding and thus achieve a reduction of the operating noises.
Near net shape forging (precision forging) allows the production of tooth raw
parts, which no longer require any soft machining of the gear because the tooth
gaps are already preformed with sufﬁcient precision. They are heat-treated and
then hard machined immediately [DEN03]. Chapter 15 deals with the design of the
process chain for the gear production as well as the advantages of precision forging
in detail.
The processes for the hard ﬁnishing of gears can be divided into proﬁle and
generation grinding processes. In proﬁle grinding, the desired gear geometry is the
negative of the tool proﬁle, while in generating grinding, the target geometry is
generated by a kinematic linking of tool and workpiece motion [TÜR02, NEW91].
Each one of these process groups in turn can be subdivided into continuous and
discontinuous processes. On the generating grinding side, there is the discontinuous
proﬁle grinding with dish grinding wheels, the continuous proﬁle grinding with
cylindrical grinding worms as well as the gear honing. On the proﬁle grinding side,
there is the very widely spread discontinuous proﬁle grinding and the continuous
proﬁle grinding with globoidal grinding worms. Figure 14.4 shows the classiﬁcation
of hard ﬁnishing processes for gears according to [DIN8589].
This chapter concentrates on the discontinuous proﬁle grinding, the continuous
generating grinding with cylindrical grinding worms as well as the continuous
crossed helical grinding with grinding rings due to the broad application of these
processes in industrial practice. Fundamental process characteristics of these
processes are contrasted at the end of this chapter (Fig. 14.18).
First, however, some basic correlations of involute gears have to be clariﬁed.
The involute of a spur-toothed wheel develops by rolling a tangential line at the

base circle of the gear. The parallel shifting of the involute in direction z generates
an involute face (Fig. 14.5).
With the aid of the operating parameter s in direction z, this face can be
described by

Corresponding relations can be provided for helical toothed gears, if it is
considered that a generatrix on the tangential plane is not inclined parallel to the
wheel axis but by the helix angle b. This caused the generation of the tooth ﬂanks
by involute helicoids [LOO59, TÜR02].
Gear ratio, force and moment transmission as well as running smoothness are of
central signiﬁcance when designing the gear. Thus, sizing and calculation of the

gears are primarily carried out via the determination of the tooth number z, the
normal module mn, the normal pressure angle an as well as the helix angle b. These
variables are standardized and form the core of the tooth calculation, which is not
explained in more detail at this point [DIN3960].
When machining helical gears with the copying process, it must be observed
that the pitch diameter and the base diameter are mathematically related to the
base data mentioned above. For example, the alteration of the pitch diameter at a
constant tooth number and normal module leads to an alteration of the helix angle.
The curvature conditions along the tooth ﬂank directly depend on the base circular
radius, which in turn can be inﬂuenced by an alteration of the tooth number of the
gear, for example [DIN3960, DIN8000]. It is to be attributed to this fact that the
involute of a gear with few teeth is strongly curved, whereas that of a gear with
many teeth appears almost straight at otherwise constant gear base data. The
helical gears include cylindrical gears as well as worm and hollow gears. The
consequences of the above-mentioned observations for each corresponding hard
ﬁnishing process are also explained in the following sections.
14.2 Discontinuous Proﬁle Grinding
In discontinuous proﬁle grinding both ﬂanks are mostly machined simultaneously
with correspondingly proﬁled tools. For this, vitriﬁed grinding wheels with melting
or sintering corundum, boron nitride as well as galvanically coated boron nitride
grinding wheels are employed.
The grinding wheel is placed in the helix angle b corresponding to the gear axis.
At ﬁrst, the infeed occurs radially, then axially so as to grind the tooth ﬂanks above
the gear width (Fig. 14.6).
In helical gearing, the axial motion along zw and the turning motion of the
wheel around zw have to be kinematically linked for this purpose. Nonproductive
times accumulate during the run-in and run-out of the tool from the tooth gap, for
the indexing of the gear in the next gap and for the return into the original position.
Therefore, the process is time-consuming compared with continuous processes.
Thus, a lower productivity results for proﬁle grinding. On the other hand, with an
exact design of the wheel proﬁles [TÜR02] high gear qualities of up to quality 1
according to [DIN3961, DIN3962, ISO1328] can be achieved [WOB95]. With this
process, the tooth root can be machined in a process-safe manner, which inﬂuences
the fatigue life of the gear positively [KLK00, KÖN94].
The related material removal rate Q0
w is calculated from the difference of the
effective wheel proﬁle and the raw part proﬁle. From this, an average value above
the involute results at
Q0
w ¼ ae  vf

In fact, depending on stock ae above the proﬁle, Q0
w can differ from the average
value considerably. Figure 14.7 illustrates the ﬂuctuating related material removal
rates Q0
w for normal and radial equidistant stocks Ds and ae. One can recognize that
at a normal equidistant stock, high depth of cut values occur especially in the range
of the tooth root, which leads to high material removal rates via Eq. 14.3. This is to
be considered in the proﬁle grinding of the gears pre-toothed by hobbing.

Discontinuous Proﬁle Grinding
309

A special characteristic of proﬁle grinding is the continuous machining of a
tooth gap at relatively large contact lengths compared with generating processes.
This condition beneﬁts the heat ﬂux in the workpiece and makes the process prone
to grinding burn effects.
As explained in the previous chapter, grinding is a combined process composed
of conditioning and the actual grinding process. Proﬁle grinding wheels are also
dressed for the application preparation. For this, the tool is to be proﬁled in such a
manner that the face determined by Eq. 14.1 develops. For helical gears it has to
be taken into consideration that the helix angle b and the spatial engagement of the
tool cause a proﬁle distortion, which has to be provided when dressing [TÜR02].
The grinding wheel proﬁle is directly dependent on the gear data. Workpieces with
different tooth numbers or helix angles can therefore only be produced with the
same tool proﬁle with quality loss. The manufacturing of high-quality gears thus
requires differently proﬁled tools. Concerning the tool supply and storage costs,
this bears a disadvantage for galvanically coated grinding wheels. In contrast, the
corundum grinding wheels, which are optionally dressable due to the line dressing,
have proven to be very ﬂexible.
Figure 14.8 demonstrates the kinematic of the path-controlled dressing of a
proﬁle grinding wheel. The right and left proﬁle sides of the gap are advanta-
geously proﬁled in two contour strings. Therefore, both parts can be dressed
concordantly either by pushing or pulling, which avoids different forces between
the effective partners. The pulling cutting is preferable [TÜR02]. At this, the
conditioning is carried out by means of a rotating dressing tool, which is furnished
with special diamond sticks at the circumferential outer edges [LIE02].

Gear Grinding

Apart from the macro-geometrical proﬁle generation of the grinding wheels it is
the target of the dressing process to adjust the micro-topography to the case of
application. The dressing result with a powered form roll is determined by the roll
geometry, the type of diamond as well as their allocation and also fundamentally
by the manipulated variables overlap ratio Ud, effective dressing depth of cut aed
and speed ratio qd. The signiﬁcance of these variables in the dressing of proﬁles is
illustrated in Fig. 14.9.
As previously mentioned, the overlap ratio is the relation between the width of
cut of the dresser apd to the dressing feed fd. This dimensionless variable is a
measurement as to how close to each other the different lanes of the feed spiral
generated during the dressing are located. Thus, a smoother wheel surface
develops at a high overlap ratio compared with a low one. While the overlap ratio
and the effective depth of cut aed acting normally to the surface remain constant in
the dressing of linear proﬁles, these variables change depending on the proﬁle
angle a in the dressing of curved proﬁles. With the variables deﬁned in Fig. 14.9
the overlap ratio results at

The course of the overlap ratio Ud and the effective depth of cut aed over the
grinding wheel proﬁle are exemplarily illustrated in Fig. 14.10. Due to the reasons
mentioned, the roughness at the gear decreases with an increasing overlap ratio,
whereas the grinding power increases noticeably.

14.3 Continuous Generating Grinding
with Grinding Worms
Continuous generating grinding works with a cylindrical grinding worm, which
can be approximate by a gear rack proﬁle in its normal section. The worm depends
on module m and pressure angle a of the gear. It is therefore applicable for gears of
the same module and pressure angle independent from the helix angle. Worms are
used in ceramic bonding with fused corundum, sintering corundum or CBN as a
grinding material as well as in galvanic bonding with CBN allocation. As gal-
vanically coated grinding worms, worm sets of roughing and ﬁnishing worms are
often used to achieve high removal rates and high surface qualities at the same
time. High gear qualities can be reached in continuous generating grinding. Pitch
and concentricity errors are small due to the continuous process. Continuous
generating grinding is preferred in the batch production of medium-sized and large
batches of workpieces up to module 5 mm. The machining of gears up to module
10 mm, however, is currently already feasible.
When machining the gear, the grinding worm is pivoted opposite the workpiece
axis by the angle u = b - c0 (c0: helix angle of the worm) (Fig. 14.11). The tool
and workpiece axes are linked to each other so that the tooth and the worm rotate
in a constant rotation speed ratio. The ﬂank stock is removed by means of a radial
depth of cut. For the machining of the tooth width, the grinding worm or the gear
carries out an axial (differential process, Pfauter-process) or a feed motion in the
direction of the tooth helix (Grant-process).
Fig. 14.10 Inﬂuence of the overlap ratio and the depth of dressing on the roughness
312
14
Gear Grinding

Due to the generating kinematic, the tooth ﬂank stock on the right and left tooth
ﬂanks are removed in a different way to each other. One gear ﬂank is machined
with a worm ﬂank, which generates from the tooth tip to the tooth root, whereas
the stock on the opposite ﬂank is abraded simultaneously from the tooth root to the
tooth tip. Due to the continuous process, tool approaches and idle times are
omitted. The stock is removed in ﬁne strips per workpiece revolution. This leads to
the process-typical waviness along the ﬂank line. The resulting generating feed
therefore occurs along the proﬁle line and not in the direction of the tooth width.
While the workpiece tooth is out of engagement and revolves, no material removal
takes place. The interrupted gap machining resulting from this enables a better
cooling of the workpiece compared with discontinuous proﬁle grinding.
In continuous generating grinding, several right and left tooth ﬂanks are always
in engagement. At this, altering engagement conditions and a varying number of
engagements on the right and left tooth ﬂanks occur. The consequences are
periodical force deviations between tool and gear. Figure 14.11 illustrates the
kinematic and the geometrical contact relations between grinding worm and gear.
The average related material removal rate can be calculated from the geo-
metrical variables and the feed speed. It is

The proﬁle formation length lP results from the distance of the engagement

a value averaged over the entire grinding process, i.e., the summarized material
removal rate of all engagement points. The locally related material removal rate
Q0
wl; which regards the material removal rate existing at a point of the tooth ﬂank,
differs strongly from it. It is calculated as follows

At this, the running variable above the radial extension of the ﬂank is given by
the diameter of the contact point dy. Figure 14.12 shows an example of the courses
of averaged and locally-related material removal rates. The courses of Q0
wl make it
clear that at an increase of the averaged material removal rate Q0
wm via an increase
of the depth of cut Ds, the corresponding maximum related material removal rate
Q0
wl rises considerably more weakly than at an increase of the feed speed vf.
Furthermore, the difference between both variables can be recognized. For
example, the locally related material removal rate Q0
wl can be higher at the tooth tip
by factor 2.5 than the averaged related material removal rate Q0
wm.
A higher material removal rate in the workpiece tip range leads to deviations in
the workpiece proﬁle and can be interpreted as an indicator for a stronger proﬁle
loss, especially in the root range of the grinding worm. Investigations on the
inﬂuence of the number of worm threads on the tool wear and residual stresses in
the workpiece have shown that the proﬁle loss can be observed especially in the
case of multi-thread worms. At the same time, multi-thread tools show better
residual stress results [STI09].
Technological characteristic values, such as the geometrical contact length or the
single grain chip thickness, have already established themselves in process design for
other hard ﬁnishing processes, i.e., surface or external grinding. A description of
these characteristic values for continuous generating grinding occurs with [STI09]

At this, the index 0 characterizes a tool related variable, while f stands for the

Copying processes are mainly used for the dressing of grinding worms. For this,
the tool proﬁle of a diamond proﬁle roll is derived from the grinding worm
geometry. The dressing tool is placed at a helix angle and lead along the worm,
while the latter turns. This process corresponds to a thread grinding process. The
geometrical relations are illustrated in a simpliﬁed manner in Fig. 14.13.
Attention should be paid to the fact that the proﬁle of the rotating dressing tool
does not correspond to the gap proﬁle in the normal section of the worm. In fact, one
has to consider that the contact line between dressing tool and grinding worm is not
representable in a plane. Similar to the grinding of gears with proﬁle grinding
wheels, an alteration of the worm data also leads to alterations of the required
dressing tool proﬁle in this case. These alterations can occur during the process
adjustment to a different number of threads of the grinding worm as well as fol-
lowing the dressing related diameter alteration of the grinding wheels. In industrial

practice, the ﬂanks of the dressing tools are produced with a radius so that
approximated worm ﬂanks are generated when dressing an involute surface. A
mathematical illustration of the dressing proﬁle, which also considers possible
machine axes compositiones, was developed by [TÜR02]. Line dressing strategies
offer more ﬂexibility in the proﬁle generation. However, due to the merely punctual
contact they are accompanied by longer dressing cycles and therefore, are less
attractive from an economic point of view.
14.4 Continuous Crossed Helical Grinding
In continuous crossed helical grinding, the effective partners are positioned like a
worm gear with crossed (skew) axes. The process is mathematically similar to
tooth shaving (Fig. 14.14) [BAU94]. However, grinding tools are used here. At
this, the tool is mostly an internal toothed ring for reasons of beneﬁcial contact
ratios. In practice, this process is also called gear honing, pitch honing, shave
grinding or also coroning (brand name of KAPP). It is, however not a honing
process in the sense of [DIN8589]. In fact, it is a grinding process. Within the gear
grinding processes, it can be classiﬁed as continuous generating grinding (see
Fig. 14.14) [SCH99].
Tool and gear roll off at the pitch cylinders. The axis crossing angle causes an
axial motion of the grinding wheel opposite the gear. This produces a cutting
motion on the pitch circle. As is generally known above and below the pitch circle,
at every tooth matching and in this case a ‘‘sliding’’, i.e., cutting motion takes
place, which superposes the axial motion as a resulting cutting speed, depending

on the contact point and whether it is an arriving or a departing ﬂank (Fig. 14.15).

From Fig. 14.15 (top) it can be deduced that the radial speed over the distance

ratio zs/zw can be determined.

Thus, the resulting cutting speeds illustrated in Fig. 14.16 result from the
involute of the gear, in fact, differing according to arriving and departing ﬂanks.
Consequently the typical grinding groove proﬁle for this kind of ‘‘ﬁnishing
results.’’ Various sources [KOC83, BAU93, STA96, WRI97, AMI99] ascribe an
especially beneﬁcial noise behavior to this surface structure. Due to the consid-
erable efforts to reduce the running noise, crossed helical grinding has become
considerably more important lately.
The cutting speeds are far below those usual in grinding. The motion resulting
from the kinematic of the crossed helical grinding gear is superposed by a second
motion in the form of a linear oscillation in the direction of the workpiece axis in
many cases. Its purpose is to further reduce the tooth ﬂank roughness. The tooth
ﬂank removal enabled by crossed helical grinding is currently set at 0.1 mm by the
leading machine and tool producers. The increase of the removal values can be
attributed to a new drive and machine concept, which permit higher rpm and thus
higher cutting speeds.
The tools are internally toothed rings of different grinding materials. Diamond
rings need not be dressed and can be deployed economically especially in large batch
production. However, dressable rings of aluminum oxide are mainly used for
workpiece hardnesses below HRC 63, silicon carbide for workpiece hardnesses
above HRC 63 or micro-crystalline aluminum oxide in usual grain sizes of
80–100 lm. The usual bonding types are artiﬁcial resin compounds and vitriﬁed
bonds, the latter showing a higher degree of stiffness but with a greater tendency to
tool wear. To unite the positive properties of both types of bonding artiﬁcial resin-
ceramic-mix bondings have been developed. For the dressing of the grinding ring,
Fig. 14.16 Cutting speeds and grinding grooves in crossed helical grinding
318
14
Gear Grinding

diamond dressing gears are deployed whose geometry is identical to that of the gears
to be machined. The dressing gears represent steel cores galvanically coated with a
single layer of diamond grains. The axis distance between tool and workpiece is
increased as a consequence of the grinding ring wear after each dressing process. At
this, the axis crossing angle is to be updated so as to compensate the alteration of the
pitch diameter. According to the current state-of-the-art, dressing intervals of up to
400 workpieces and total tool life quantities of 60,000 gears can be realized.
It is interesting that diamond grinding wheels can also be used for this process
when machining steel. The process is known with the brand name ‘‘coroning’’
[NN00]. This possibility results from the fact that, only a very low grinding speed
develops between tool and workpiece. A strong chemical wear only occurs at a
higher temperature level due to the afﬁnity between diamond and steel. Therefore,
the high degree of hardness of the diamond can be put to beneﬁcial use at low
process temperatures in this case.
The typical mechanical and very low thermic load of the gear surface in the
process leads to the fact that an especially beneﬁcial residual stress condition can
be achieved in the subsurface of the tooth ﬂanks, whereas deeper lying layers are
barely inﬂuenced. This is illustrated in Fig. 14.17 by means of several residual
stress-depth courses.
The surface roughness of the tooth ﬂanks after grinding is also relevant for the
component life time. Therefore, the system and manipulated variables of the
process were varied in tests, resulting in different component topographies. The
test gears of the HD1 series showed the lowest roughness with values around
Rz = 2 lm. The low ﬂank roughness was achieved by using a ﬁne grain size. In
addition, an oscillating tool motion was superposed to the machining process. The
highest ﬂank roughnesses of up to Rz = 4.1 lm occurred with the HD3 series. At
this, a rougher grain size and no oscillation motion were deployed [MAR01].

Process Layout and Integration
into the Process Chain
A process, such as the manufacturing of a component by cutting or abrasive
machining is system-technically deﬁned as the transformation of input variables of
a system into corresponding output variables in the sense of system engineering.
At this, the transformation represents a development relative to the reference
criterion ‘‘time’’. The cutting process is already described as a system in Sect. 1.4.
This chapter begins with explaining deﬁnitions and correlations around the term
‘‘process chains’’. On that basis, the theoretical basics of process and process chain
layout are described by means of simple examples. Section 15.5 ‘‘process moni-
toring’’ demonstrates ways to monitor the process quality and take inﬂuence on the
machining process.
15.1 Basics of Process Chain Layout
To understand the approach in process chain layout, it is initially necessary to
delimit the terms ‘‘process’’, ‘‘process chain element’’ and ‘‘process chain’’ con-
tentwise. The PEC model shown in Fig. 15.1 gives an overview of the terms used
in the following.
The PEC model is divided into three levels. At this, the process (P) represents
the smallest and thus indivisible unit of a process chain. Input and output variables
are part of a process. A manufacturing operation such as, for example the gen-
eration of a hole with a tool, is called a process.
The process chain element (E) is deﬁned as a sequential line up of single
processes. A parallel conﬁguration of processes to a process chain element is not
permissible. The term process element is also used as a synonym for the term
process chain element. For example, a process element is the workpiece machining
on a machine, such as the grinding of all the main and pin bearings of a crank
shaft.
If more than one process element is necessary to manufacture a product, their
line-up is called process chain (C). The single process elements are either put into

sequential or parallel order or a mix of both. Thus, a process chain can be deﬁned
as an orderly line up of process elements with the target of transferring certain
transformation objects from an input condition to a corresponding output condi-
tion. In the sense of production technology, transformation objects are raw or half-
ﬁnished parts, but in general, they can also be other material and immaterial
objects such as energies, information or services.
15.1.1 Technological Interfaces
For the layout of a process chain, it is important to know about the hand-over
variables between the process elements. At the same time, the hand-over variables
represent output and input variables of two subsequent process elements (n) and
(n ? 1). Some examples for hand-over variables of production-oriented processes
are:
• measurements and oversize,
• surface structure or
• temperature of a component.
The totality of the hand-over variables between two process elements is the
hand-over condition. In production-oriented systems, this condition is called
technological interface. Figure 15.2 illustrates technological interfaces between
process element (n - 1) and process element (n), as well as between process
element (n) and process element (n ? 1).
Process elements are displayed in a timely correlation. Per process element, the
process time tn incurs. Technological interfaces, however, can only be assigned to
one point of time. A corresponding time interval does not exist. The total of all
sequential processes of a process chain makes up the total time ttot.

15.1.2 Process Chain Layout
Improved cutting material, more efﬁcient and more accurate machines as well as
increased requirements towards a cost-efﬁcient, rapid and environmentally sound
manufacturing contribute to the fact that cutting processes have further developed
to a high degree. Especially the processes of hard ﬁnishing with geometrically
deﬁned cutting edge can be named here as examples. They can make a consid-
erable contribution for the shortening of process chains and thus to the reduction of
processing times and to the reduction of production costs.
To optimise existing process chains by using new technologies or to conﬁgure
new process chains optimally, a process chain layout is carried out. The tasks to be
passed through for this purpose are subdivided into two steps, which depend on
each other [BRA08]. At the beginning of the process chain layout, the processes
are identiﬁed, which allow the generation of the product in their order, which is to
be determined. This step is called process chain design. Based on this, it is pos-
sible to conﬁgure the process parameters and technological interfaces.
The target of the process chain design is to identify suitable processes so as to
allow a most efﬁcient production. The assessment factors are, for example, eco-
nomically-logistic target variables such as processing times, work cycle times and
machining costs. Complex process chains, however, rapidly let the production
planner reach his limits due to the high number of design variants. This problem
can be confronted with the use of process chain simulation. The technological
basis of a process chain simulation are the locally optimised single processes such
as sawing, turning/milling, hardening or ﬁnishing. The result of a simulation cycle
gives an indication concerning the proﬁtability of the reviewed process chain.
Rationalisation potential for the process chain can be exploited by redesigning.
The development of new process chains as a medium to improve the proﬁt-
ability and quality must not only be applied on single work or production steps, it
must be targeted at the total optimum [TÖN07]. The ASI method represented in
Fig. 15.3 offers support for the implementation of a holistic process chain layout.
Fig. 15.2 Technological interfaces within a process chain
15.1
Basics of Process Chain Layout
327

The basis is the redesign of production-oriented process chains by adaption,
substitution and/or integration of single production steps.
Adaption is the adjustment of two subsequent processes, e.g., the production of
raw parts by forging and the following cutting. In the ﬁgure, process B is adapted
to processes A and C. In the development of tools and tool machines or as a
reaction to altered cost structures, the substitution of a production process can be
sensible. One example for such a substitution is the substitution of a grinding
process by hard turning. In Fig. 15.3, process B is substituted by the further
developed process D. The integration of manufacturing steps shortens the oper-
ation sequence. This is often connected with direct process-conditioned cost
savings or indirect cost savings based on shortened through-put times and reduced
controlling effort. A current example for this is the complete machining of com-
ponents by integration of different manufacturing processes on a multi-axial
turning machine or a machining centre. In the illustration, process B is integrated
into the course of production step A.
15.2 Process Model Generation
In technology, the term model stands for an image of reality. The VDI guideline
3633 deﬁnes model as a simpliﬁed reproduction of a system [VDI3633]. In this
context, simpliﬁed reproduction means the reduction to only those characteristics
relevant for the modelling target. Here, model generation is to be all the necessary
steps for the generation of a model.
The analysis of complex technical processes such as cutting processes requires
the set-up of process models. For this purpose, all single process steps are
abstracted ﬁrst so as to achieve a reduction of the complexity and a concentration
on the main characteristics. Toenshoff deﬁnes the term ‘‘process model’’ as an
abstract presentation of a process, which serves to link up the causes and effects
Fig. 15.3 ASI method for process chain design
328
15
Process Layout and Integration into the Process Chain

with each other [TÖP92]. The target of the process model generation is to
understand the correlations and interactions within a process better as well as being
able to predict resp. optimise future process results. The application of process
models is often called ‘‘simulation’’.
The process model depicts the correlations between input and output variables
of a process. It thus describes the static and dynamic behaviour of a process.
Figure 15.4 clariﬁes the correlations between real process and process model.
During the model generation, an abstraction of the initial question takes place to
begin with. It is fed into the process model. The application of the model supplies
an outlook of the behaviour of the real system. Before using the process model, its
functioning has to be veriﬁed using known input and output variables.
The generation of process models can occur in different ways, depending on the
application and the information at hand. Toenshoff and Paul distinguish between
three types of process models [TÖP92]:
• heuristic models, which can be obtained by means of the sophisticated
description of know-how,
• physical/empiric models, which rely on physical, mathematical basics and
• information-oriented data models.
Figure 15.5 illustrates the mutual relations between these types of models.
Heuristic models depict know-how, e.g., the process understanding of a
machine operator in production. For instance, the experienced operator of a CNC
turning machine is often able to draw conclusions for the layout of the machining
process from process noises or the shape of the generated chips. This knowledge,
however, often gets lost with a change of workplace. On the other hand, the ﬁling
and guarantee of a permanent availability of know-how, e.g., from the manufac-
turing area are of great importance for the success of a company. The supply and
maintenance of such knowledge is referred to as knowledge-management. The
modelling of know-how occurs by means of simple production rules (if/then
relations), class or object structures (ER or UML diagrams) [OES98] or by means
of fuzzy quantities (fuzzy logic) [PAU94].
Technological dependencies, for example as between cutting force Fc and
cutting power Pc (Sect. 5.1), can be illustrated in mathematical algorithms.

real system
15.2
Process Model Generation
329

The thus resulting process models are determined as physical or empiric models—
depending on their type of retrieval [PRO77]. While physical process models are
based on physical laws, empiric process models are detected by means of mea-
surements in the process experimentally (Fig. 15.6).
For the generation of physical process models, relevant physical processes are
selected and transformed into a qualitatively model, based on the target of the
process. The mathematical representation of the model—the physical process
model—is detected on the basis of physical laws. It represents the quantitative
dependencies between technological input and output variables, the correlation
between adjustment variables and work result, for example. Empiric process
models are, as mentioned before, determined by measurements in the process
Fig. 15.5 Levels of model generation
Fig. 15.6 Physical and empiric process model generation
330
15
Process Layout and Integration into the Process Chain

experimentally. For example, in the cutting technology, grinding tests are carried
out, at which relevant input and output variables are to be recorded. The test results
are evaluated, a type of model is selected (correlation function), the coefﬁcients
determined and the empiric process model veriﬁed by means of further tests. The
beneﬁt of physical process models is a process-independent process understanding
and the connected simple transferability to altered machining conditions. For
cutting processes, however, a purely physical model generation is unrealistic
because the existing physical laws are not sufﬁcient and therefore have to be
completed by experimental investigations empirically.
Apart from the heuristic and physical/empiric models, Fig. 15.5 illustrates data
models as the third level of process model generation. Data structures are deter-
mined in data models so as to ensure a holistic description of the entire relevant
production-oriented information. Data modelling includes the development of an
object-oriented relationship model in the form of class diagrams. These can also be
illustrated as sequence, condition or activity diagrams for further use [OES98].
The data models are deposited, i.e., ﬁled in relational, object-relational or purely
object-oriented data banks.
15.3 Process Layout Using the Example
of ‘‘Hard Finishing’’
The result of a cutting process is determined by the input, process and output
variables. The setting of these variables, considering the mutual dependencies is
called process layout. The starting point of a process layout is the determination of
target variables. These target variables represent speciﬁcations for the result
variables generated by the machining process. Generally, we distinguish between
quality-relevant, economic and ecological targets of a machining process.
The quality of a cutting process is judged according to the resulting component
quality. For this, characteristics are macro-geometry, micro-geometry and surface
zone inﬂuence. Figure 15.7 shows the quality characteristics of an external
grinding process in an exemplary way. Analogically, the relevant characteristics
are assigned for the economic and ecological targets. In the design process or
production planning, component-speciﬁc target values or target intervals are
detected for the single characteristics of a process. These targets are illustrated in
Fig. 15.8 for an external grinding process in an exemplary way.
In the following, the approach to the layout of machining processes is explained
by means of the above described external grinding process. The difﬁculty of a
process layout is the weighting of the target variables compared with each other.
What is for example, the signiﬁcance of the ecological targets of the machining
which are the quality-determining ones? A proven and tested method to determine
these weightings is the target tree process. In design methodology it is applied to
carry out an evaluation of different concept variants [ZAN70]. For the layout of the
15.2
Process Model Generation
331

exemplary grinding process it is used to calculate the mutually corresponding
priorities from the weightings of the single target variables.
Figure 15.9 illustrates a target tree for the above mentioned target variables.
This one is subdivided into four levels. The target function to be determined is
located on the ﬁrst level. The second level organises the target variables in the
group’s quality, economy and ecology. A detailing in partial groups is shown on
the third level and the targets variables themselves on the fourth level. Weightings
Fig. 15.7 Quality characteristics in external grinding
Fig. 15.8 Exemplary target variables for external grinding
332
15
Process Layout and Integration into the Process Chain

are assigned to each branch of the target tree. The weight of the group quality
amounts to 3 in this example, the group economy is weighted with 2 and the group
ecology with 1. In practice, this means that for the grinding process to be designed,
the quality of the manufactured components is exactly 3 times as important as the
ecological target variables. The weightings are carried out the same way on the
lower levels.
Priority factors are determined from the weighting factors for each element of
the target tree. For this purpose, the weighting factors of a level are added to begin
with. For the second level, this adds up to 3 ? 2 ? 1 = 6. A priority factor is
represented as a fractional rational number. The sum of the priorities is in the
denominator of this fraction, the priority of the element concerned in the
numerator. So the priority factor for the quality amounts to 3/6, which equals 1/2.
In the lower levels the priorities are determined in a similar way. However, the
determined single priorities of the third and fourth level additionally have to be
multiplied with the priority of the group located above. The sum of the priorities of
a level is generated as a test. It should always be 1.
After having deﬁned the priorities of all target variables, the target function for
the layout of the machining process is compiled (Eq. 15.1). In target function Z,
the standardised variables for the target variable ~xi enter apart from the priority
factors pxi.

The standardisation is necessary so as to be able to compare the target variables
with each other independently from their different values and dimensions. As a

standardisation interval, the variable area (0.1–0.9) is selected. The approach to the
standardisation is clariﬁed in the example in Fig. 15.10:
After the standardisation of all target variables these can be either positive
(x [ 0) or negative (x \ 0). A uniform orientation is necessary, however, to
ensure the comparability. Thus, Eq. 15.1 generates the value of the standardised
variables.
In addition, in Eq. 15.1 it must be observed which values of the standardised
target variables ~xi lead to an improvement of the target function Z. If evaluations
criteria are mainly used as in the example from Fig. 15.8, which have an advan-
tageous effect for smaller values, (example: roughness or costs), the standardised
and weighted target variables are to be subtracted from 1. If, on the contrary,
evaluation criteria are considered which have an advantageous effect for higher
values (example: efﬁciency factor), the term pxi xi
j j from Eq. 15.1 is not to be
subtracted from 1. The result of the target function is called evaluation code Z. The
machining result is better, the higher Z.
In the so-generated target function, technological models (so-called basic
model) are introduced to describe the target variables. For example, the following
model is used for the roughness Rz illustrated in Fig. 15.10 [CZE00]:

The constants and exponents c0 to c3 required to determine the roughness Rz are
model-speciﬁc values and can adopt different variables according to the combi-
nation of workpiece, tool and machine.

15.4 Process Chain Layout Using the Example ‘‘Gear
Production’’
In practice, cutting machining processes cannot be regarded alone. Generally, the
machining occurs in several subsequent partial steps as so-called multi-step pro-
cess conduct. This multi-step process conduct (example: roughing and ﬁnishing a
function area) represents the layout of a process chain element according to the
PEC model. The layout of different process chain elements to each other is called
process chain layout. The target of a multi-step process conduct is a preferably
high correlation of the machining result with previously determined target vari-
ables. For example, a high material removal rate in the roughing process allows a
more rapid material removal. In contrast, high surface qualities as well as
dimension and shape accuracies are achieved with a lower material removal rate
and consequently lower ﬁnishing forces.
The following example (Fig. 15.11) demonstrates the effects of two-step grinding
on the workpiece surface zone. Generally, the surface zone state is characterised by
residual stress course, hardness and structure condition. It is very signiﬁcant for
highly-loaded components. A faultless functional behaviour of the components is
only achievable by reaching certain quality targets. At this, it is especially important
to avoid residual tensile stresses in the surface zone of the terminated components, so
as to counteract crack formation among other. Figure 15.11 shows how critical
residual tensile stresses caused by grinding can be avoided for an external plunge
grinding process by means of multi-step machining.
The high material removal rate of roughing causes a relatively high thermal
inﬂuence in the workpiece surface zone. The resulting residual tensile stresses can

15.4
Process Chain Layout Using the Example ‘‘Gear Production’’
335

be removed by adapting the oversize in the ﬁnishing process. In addition, a mainly
mechanical inﬂuence of the workpiece surface occurs due to the low material
removal rate in the ﬁnishing process. This causes residual compressive stresses,
which mostly balance the residual tensile stresses remaining in the deeper layers of
the workpiece surface and often has a positive effect on the component fatigue life.
Complex technical components, e.g., gears, are generated by different manu-
facturing processes. They develop complex process chains consisting of different
process chain elements such as forming, cutting and hardening. A process chain
layout is carried out so as to obtain an optimum result from such process chains. In
the following paragraph the necessary process for this purpose will be explained
using the example of a gear production.
The top of Fig. 15.12 illustrates a conventional process chain for the manu-
facturing of gears for automobile transmissions. The single process chain elements
are locally optimised concerning time and costs. The interfaces of the process
elements are impenetrable for an iterative information ﬂow towards the layout of
the process chain.
The bottom part of Fig. 15.12 shows a further developed process chain where
the generation of raw parts, cutting soft machining and heat treatment have been
substituted by precision forging with integrated heat treatment. The background of
substitution is the intention to exploit the economic advantages of forging, which
occur at high lot sizes. In addition, the integrated heat treatment supersedes the
repeated heating before hardening, which considerably reduces the energy need of
the process chain. The process chain layout and optimisation takes place consid-
ering economic-logistic targets and technological interactions between the process
chain elements. At this, the approach is according to the ‘‘method for the
Fig. 15.12 Process chain design by substitution and integration of single processes
336
15
Process Layout and Integration into the Process Chain

positioning of technological interfaces’’ (design of technological interfaces—
DTI-method) [BRA08, DEB03].
During the process chain layout, two questions have to be answered as a matter
of principle:
1. Where in the process chain do technological interfaces occur?
2. What level are technological hand-over parameters planned at?
The answer to the ﬁrst question occurs during the process chain design. As tools
for this, a process chain simulation with subsequent application of the ASI method
is described in Sect. 15.1. In connection with the DTI method, this ﬁrst phase of
the process chain optimisation is called ‘‘qualitative positioning’’ (see below). The
problem of the second question can be illustrated for the exemplary process chain
for the manufacturing of gears as follows:
• Generation of a high component quality by means of precision forging and a
resulting lower effort for the hard ﬁnishing or
• Generation of a lower component quality by means of precision forging at a
higher effort in hard ﬁnishing.
The target is to determine an optimum between these two layout variants. For
this purpose, the technological hand-over values at the interfaces of the process
chain have to be analysed and quantitatively conﬁgured. The DTI method
describes this phase as ‘‘quantitative positioning’’. The necessary approach is
explained below. The following Fig. 15.13 illustrates a schematic image of the
approach when positioning technological interfaces.
Target of the qualitative positioning of technological interfaces is the process
chain design using suitable manufacturing technologies. At this, an increase in the

Process Chain Layout Using the Example ‘‘Gear Production’’

productivity and proﬁtability is always aspired. This is achieved, e.g., by reducing
the production steps and the technological interfaces within the process chain. The
reduction of the number of production steps aims for a decrease of the throughput
time and thus of the manufacturing costs. In addition, a reduction of the interfaces
decreases the computing time for the layout of the hand-over variables to the
technological interfaces.
To carry out the qualitative positioning, an analysis of the production steps and
cycles required for production is carried out. Based on this, manufacturing pro-
cesses which allow a preferably efﬁcient component production are identiﬁed. An
evaluation of the single production processes acts in accordance with the degree of
added value, for example. So during the process chain design, attention must be
paid to combine processes with a low degree of added value with ones that
considerably increase the workpiece value (?process integration). As tools for the
subsequent process chain design, the ASI method (see above) or methods of
process substitution, process combination, process elimination and process
exchange recommended by Koenig [KÖN87] are used. The result is different
process chain variants based on alternative manufacturing processes.
Figure 15.14 illustrates different technological variants for the design of the
process chain for the production of gears with high accuracy requirements. In all
three variants demonstrated, the input material is a rod-shaped semi-ﬁnished
product.
The quantitative layout of technological interfaces describes the dimensioning
of the technological hand-over values between the single process steps. The pro-
cess models for all process elements are determined based on physical and empiric
models (see above). The next step is the deﬁnition of the prevailing boundary
Fig. 15.14 Alternative process chains for the manufacturing of gears
338
15
Process Layout and Integration into the Process Chain

conditions for each production process. The resulting functions (speciﬁc process
model) are merged to target functions for the layout of single technological
variables. The determination of the target functions and the identiﬁcation of
weightings for each target variable occur according to the target tree process (Sect.
15.3).
First, the detected target functions for the single production steps are weighted
and then merged to a total target function. The calculation of the target function
produces the degree of layout of the process chain under the given boundary
conditions. Varying the boundary conditions for the process chain (e.g., cycle
time) or for single processes (e.g., amount of cutting ﬂuid) can inﬂuence the layout
result of the process chain positively or negatively. The determination of the basic
conditions and the weights of the target variables depend decisively on the know-
how of the planner.
Process chains consisting of few subsequent process steps can easily take the
planner to his limits, if the process chain is to be designed holistically at an
optimum. Not only the multiple process parameters of all production processes,
also the mutual correlations seem to make a layout based on the cognitive tasks of
the planner impossible. The linkage of the single process models of the entire
process chain for an optimum determination of the interfaces do not allow the
deterministic identiﬁcation of a solution in an acceptable period, not even with
modern data processing systems. Therefore, one must resort to heuristic solution
methods (e.g., genetic algorithms) or methods such as ‘‘design of experiments’’
DoE [DEH09]. At this, the use of simulation systems allows an automated
application of the test plans and under stochastic conditions, ﬁnding a sufﬁciently
good solution for an optimum dimensioning of the technological interfaces.
In the following, an example for the layout of a technological interface is
explained. For this purpose, the process chain for the production of highly-loaded
gears for automobile transmissions by means of precision forging is consulted
[DER07]. In this new process no soft machining of the gearing takes place.
Between the process elements precision forming and hard machining, research has
shown that the workpiece oversize and its alteration in serial production are the
main hand-over variables between the process steps. It has decisive inﬂuence on
the economic targets, i.e., the production costs of the gears. To demonstrate these
correlations, Fig. 15.15 illustrates the different wear behaviour of the forging dies
and the grinding wheel.
The left side of the image shows a forging process. At each press stroke, the
dies ﬂare due to wear—the generated components become bigger in the course of
time. If a tight diameter tolerance of the forged part has been determined (oversize
tolerance), only few components can be manufactured with one set of dies. The
image on the right shows a grinding process. The used grinding tool wears during
the grinding process. The bigger the absolute forging oversize at this (planned
machining oversize plus oversize tolerance of the forging process) has been set,
the higher the grinding wheel wear per generated component. This is due to the
increased workpiece volume, which has to be removed by grinding in the case of a
worn set of dies. It becomes clear that the grinding oversize itself has little effect
15.4
Process Chain Layout Using the Example ‘‘Gear Production’’
339

on the layout of the forging process. In fact, it is the oversize increase of the
generated half-ﬁnished parts caused by the wear of the forging dies, that has a
negative effect on the following production steps.
Figure 15.16 illustrates the qualitative courses of the process costs depending
on the oversize increase for a precision forming process and a multi-step hard
ﬁnishing process. The target of the comparison of both curve progressions is the
determination of a value for the optimum oversize increase Daopt.
The life time of a forming tool can be prolonged to be a high oversize tolerance.
If in contrast, only a very low oversize tolerance is permitted, the process costs for
the precision forming process will rise due to lower tool life. For hard ﬁnishing, on
the other hand, an increase of the process costs occurs due to the increased

workpiece oversize after forging, since a higher Da is accompanied by an
increased oversize a and the process time increases as well as the tool wear. The
discontinuous course of the cost function illustrated in image 15.16 results from
the multi-step structure (roughing/ﬁnishing) of the grinding process.
15.5 Process Monitoring
The process monitoring represents an important task within the framework of
manufacturing, so as to achieve the target variables determined in the process and
process chain layout. In its course, input, process and result variables are analysed
and compared with each other. This is how, on the one hand, the basis for an active
intervention in the process via controlling mechanisms and, on the other hand, the
basis for the development, evaluation or veriﬁcation of empiric process models is
generated (Sect. 15.2). The process monitoring represents the testing of deﬁned
process characteristics and parameters. In Fig. 15.17, the qualitative test (per-
ception) and quantitative test (measurement) are distinguished.
A direct perception, for example, is taste of a medium. The appearance, on the
other hand, is only perceived indirectly via reﬂected light. The evaluation of these
perceptions is based on implicit, i.e., unstructured know-how. A measurement,
however, complies with explicit, i.e., structured and documented knowledge. At
this, the compilation of a length by means of a comparative normal represents a
direct measurement. Temperatures (e.g., in a thermometer) are deduced from the
length expansion of a comparative normal. It is therefore an indirect measurement.
In production technology, especially in cutting, the measurable variables are
differentiated after the time of their development. Variables which occur during a
process, are called process variables. Variables which exist as a permanent result at
the end of a process, are called result variables or output variables (Fig. 15.18).

Further information on this topic is delivered by Toenshoff [TÖI01] and Kar-
puschewski [KAR01].
A comparison of the measured process and result variables with the corre-
sponding target variables generally provide deviations from the set values. So
disturbances are affecting the process. According to whether the deviations
resulting from the disturbances are within a determined tolerance, a regulatory
intervention in the process will become necessary. The causes for such an inter-
vention can be of stochastic origin, e.g., temperature alterations, but also sys-
tematic alterations of the boundary conditions, e.g., grinding wheel wear during
the grinding process.
Figure 15.19 introduces different quality control loops. The target of quality
control is the reduction of the mentioned disturbances variables on the resulting
component quality. The control loops are differentiated according to the type of the
underlying measurement variables (process variables or result variables) and the
time delay of the intervention in in-process, process-near and superior control. For
the execution of the quality control, a process layout takes place ﬁrst. For this
purpose, the primary (e.g., cutting speed) and secondary manipulated variables
(e.g., cutting force) have to be determined. As input information for this, existing
process models and process data, as contained for example in a quality information
system [TÖC96] are used.
During a machining process, process signals such as forces, powers or sound
emission can be recorded by sensoring. These process signals allow the gaining of
process variables by means of data reduction and parameter generation. They can
be deployed for an in-process control. The adaptive control (AC) for the grinding
process can be mentioned as an example [TÖF02].
The in-process quality control occurs on the basis of process variables. In the
process-near and superior quality control, result variables are considered addi-
tionally. The target of the process-near quality control is to balance a lack of
process quality as quickly as possible. In a best case, this can be regulated from
component to component. A superior quality regulation acts during the entire
production period of a component. This kind of control is carried out, for example,
by collecting process data about different components and production lots. The
underlying process data are updated with these data and a new process layout and

optimisation takes place. The statistical process control SPC can be mentioned as
an example.
Systematic disturbance variables (e.g., grinding wheel wear), as illustrated in
Fig. 15.20, are detected and balanced by control loops.
The core element of the illustrated control loop is the process-near quality
check, for example in a ﬂexible measuring cell immediately after machining.
Target variables of machining such as roughness or the residual stress state of the
component represent the target variables in the represented control loop. These are
compared with the result variables (actual values) detected in the measuring cell.

Via the determined offset, an altered adjustment variable is deﬁned for the next
component [CZE00]. In addition, the framework of a process-near control offers
the possibility of carrying out a component-speciﬁc optimisation of the process
chain of the subsequent machining steps. Based on the process models, which have
already been used for the process chain layout, the technological interfaces of the
following processes can again be conﬁgured at an optimum while considering
correlations. This is necessary because distributions can lead to component-
speciﬁc result variables, which differ from the previously considered optimum
value determined for the entire process chain, after every machining process. At
this, it has to be ensured that a layout of all technological interfaces can be
conﬁgured individually for each component without causing a delay of the com-
ponent production. The current methods do not allow this sufﬁciently yet.
In the illustrated ﬂexible measuring cell (Fig. 15.21), micro-magnetic, laser and
scatter light sensors are deployed. The micro-magnetic sensor analyses machining-
conditioned alterations in the component surface zone. These are detected by the
so-called Barkhausen noise (volatile alteration of the magnetisation), the over-
lapping permeability (reversible alteration of the magnetisation) and the harmonic
analysis (Fourier analysis of the magnet ﬁeld) [KAR01]. In addition, the mea-
suring cell contains a laser scanner for the compilation of macroscopic quality
characteristics (component geometry, concentric runout) and a scatter light sensor
for the touch-free registration of the micro-geometries (roughness). The results of
the component checking in a ﬂexible measuring cell represent result variables,
which are deployed in the process-near or superior quality control (Fig. 15.19).
In summary, the course of a process monitoring in principle can be described as
follows. Based on a functional process, an entity (detector) compiles and maps all
arising problems. According to whether the underlying data basis consists of
explicit knowledge (facts) or implicit knowledge (experience), different analysis
processes (measurement or perception) are deployed. Once the problem is phrased,

different strategies for problem solving resp. for optimisation are applied
depending on the underlying data basis (explicit/implicit). The target of the pro-
cess monitoring is to regain control over the process, which is problem-afﬂicted
due to a malfunction. If this succeeds lastingly, it becomes necessary to consider
setting the process limits more tightly. This means a permanent improvement of
the process quality (reduction of the standard deviation r).

Chapter 16
Surface and Subsurface Properties
Cutting processes are employed to generate functional components. Finally, the
surface and subsurface properties of the components are decisive for the func-
tioning and durability. It is not always possible to draw a sharp line between
surface and subsurface as shown by the deﬁnition of the terms. In a general sense,
the surface describes the outer limitation of a body. In mathematics, the surface
determines the mass of all the boundary points of a body. In science, the surface is
the limit between two media. In production technology, a further speciﬁcation of
the term becomes necessary. The [DIN 4760] differentiates between various
deﬁnitions:
• Real surface: surface, which separates the object from the medium it is sur-
rounded by (exception: the inner surface of porous materials)
• Nominal surface: measurably collected, approximated image of the real surface
of a shape element. Different measuring processes can produce different real
surfaces
• Geometrical surface: ideal surface, whose desired size is deﬁned by the
drawing and/or other technical documents.
However, in the analysis of surfaces it is not always sensible to assume a
thickness of zero. When characterizing certain surface properties, thicknesses of
approx. 1 nm to approx. 10 lm (10-9 to 10-5 m) are regarded. This means that a
surface can consist of a single atom layer (mono layer) or of 10,000 mono layers.
In addition, within this thickness the surface is not necessarily homogeneous. The
chemical composition and structure as well as physical properties often manifest
differences. For the analyst the surface must always be the area, which is decisive
for the required property.
The subsurface
is the volume area of the material, whose properties were
altered by the machining process. The consequence of the application of this
deﬁnition is that, strictly speaking, statements about ‘‘surface residual stresses’’ or
‘‘surface hardness’’ are impossible because the determination of these variables
always also requires information from the surface-near subsurface. According to
the deﬁnitions mentioned here, surface properties can only be geometrical

properties. However, as the deﬁnition of the surface shows, surface and subsurface
often fade into each other seamlessly [BRE11].
By far, not all connections between cutting processes and the functional
properties of a component are known yet. However, it has proved itself to dif-
ferentiate between surface and subsurface properties of a component. These
properties can be described and measured by variables. The designer of a com-
ponent can stipulate such variables. The production technician has to know which
process and which input variables of the process allow the achievement of the
required surface and subsurface properties.
16.1 Surface Properties
The component surface is the part which makes contact with the surrounding
medium, a further component or the observer’s view. Not only the requirements
concerning technical components are diverse, even certain parts of the surface of
one single component can fulﬁll different tasks. For example, we can differentiate
between surfaces without technical function such as visible or reverse surfaces
(internal sides), surfaces with technical function for clogging, adhering or joining
or surfaces with different technical functions and occurring friction. Based on the
loads, in [DIN 4764] technical surfaces in engineering and in precision engi-
neering are divided into three groups, only taking the mechanical load as a basis:
• surfaces with no or low mechanical load
• stress-loaded surfaces mostly without relative motion to the counter surface
• friction-loaded surfaces with relative motion to the counter surface.
The micro geometry of the surface is mainly responsible for the component
behavior during mechanical loads of different types. Thus, the production process
of a certain component surface has to ensure that a certain micro geometry, in the
form of roughness, is not surpassed or underrun. Functional surfaces such as
visible, clogging, adhering or planing surfaces for example, have to manifest the
lowest possible roughnesses. Substrate surfaces, on the other hand, require a
process-dependent minimum roughness so as to enable the layer adherence.
The requirements concerning surface roughness have to be fulﬁlled by suitable
cutting processes. One single process is not always able to generate the surfaces in
the required quality. If nothing else due to economic considerations, two processes
of the same cutting method often have to be carried out one after the other
(roughing, ﬁnishing). In some cases, the cutting process alone is not enough to
obtain the required surface quality so that a second, different process has to be
connected in series (e.g., drilling and rubbing, milling and roller burnishing).
However, if cutting processes are planned to fulﬁll the roughness requirements
towards the component, it has to be taken into account that in practice, the nominal
surface differs from the geometrical surface by shape deviations of different orders.
These are deﬁned in [DIN 4760] and proven with examples (Fig. 16.1) [BRE11].

Surface and Subsurface Properties

Cutting processes which show a distinctive cutting direction, consistently cause
aligned, groovy surfaces. Non-groovy surfaces are generated by spark eroding,
pressure shot peening, forming or primary shaping (casting), for example. Aligned
surfaces generally manifest higher roughnesses transversely to the cutting direc-
tion than in the cutting direction.
16.1.1 Determination of Surface Properties
The most frequently encountered roughness characteristics in the area of cutting
technology are the arithmetic mean roughness Ra, the average surface roughness
Rz and the maximum scallop height Rmax. The arithmetic mean roughness Ra can
quantify gradual alterations of the surface as caused by tool wear. Peaks and
grooves however, cannot be differentiated, neither can different proﬁle shapes. If
Ra is used as a surface characteristic, the character of the roughness should also be
known from other tests. Ra is regarded as a robust variable, since it only shows
light reactions to single disturbances. In principle, Ra can be determined with all
kinds of stylus instruments. The results of single metering points only scatter to a
rather low degree, since the determination of Ra is based on a strong averaging
[VOL05]. Ra describes the average deviation of the proﬁle from the centerline
(Fig. 16.2). The calculative determination takes place according to [DIN 4768]:

with:

z
distance of the roughness proﬁle from the centerline within the metering
distance
The two surface characteristics average surface roughness Rz and maximum
scallop height Rmax are frequently used together. In this combination, single
outliers can be detected: if Rmax is considerably higher than Rz, this means that the
measured proﬁle section contains a single especially high peak. A measurement at
another place on the specimen can clarify whether it is actually a single outlier.
To determine Rz and Rmax, the measured surface proﬁle with the selected cutoff
wave length kc, which delimits roughness and waviness from each other is ﬁltered.
The metering distance ln is generally determined so that it can be divided into ﬁve
equal sections lr, each with the length of the cutoff wave length kc. The maximum
height value zi is taken from each section and the arithmetic average generated
from these values (Fig. 16.2). Thus, Rz results from:
Rz ¼ 1

Rmax is the largest distance from the highest peak to the deepest groove within a
metering segment. The highest roughness value within the metering segments 1–5
is deﬁned as Rmax (Fig 16.2) [VOL05].
The measurement process for micro-geometrical characteristics of a surface can
act with or without direct contact. Basically, three measuring principles are
distinguished:
Fig. 16.2 Some important roughness characteristics [VOL05]
352
16
Surface and Subsurface Properties

• tactile methods
• optical methods
• scanning probe microscopic methods.
The classical measuring processes all place a proﬁle section into the surface, so
they are two-dimensional processes. Nowadays, by scanning the surface with a
point sensor or also by using two-dimensional sensors, it is possible to determine
the roughness of surfaces within justiﬁable time periods. It is therefore necessary
to differentiate between two- and three-dimensional processes [BRE11]. Even
today, most roughness proﬁles are still registered with mechanical styluses,
transformed into electrical signals, pre-processed (ﬁltered) and passed off in the
deﬁned measurement variables or as a proﬁle diagram. Due to depiction reasons,
the proﬁle diagrams are mostly recorded in a strongly exaggerated way (e.g., at the
ratio of 100:1). So, they can be the reason for misinterpretations. Figure 16.3
shows typical proﬁle diagrams for turning and grinding in exaggerated and
straightened (1:1) illustration.
On the one hand, the micro geometry of the newly generated surface by the
cutting process is determined by the cutting edge geometry, on the other hand it can
be considerably inﬂuenced by the variation of machining parameters. In the turning
process, i.e., the shape of the tool is reproduced in the surface so that the feed is the
most important roughness determining parameter. For example, if the cutting edge
radius re and the feed f are known, it is possible to determine the roughness depth
Rth which a turning process would generate on the surface of a non-deformable
material by machining on an ideally stiff machine tool according to:

with:

So, the thus determined theoretical surface roughness Rth increases quadrati-
cally with the feed and decreases linearly with an increased cutting edge radius
[PAU08, BAU34]. The effect of the elastic material deformation, which shows in
the system-dependent minimum cutting thickness hmin among others and gains
inﬂuence with a decreasing feed, is considered in an extended surface roughness
formula [BRA61, BRE11].

The theoretical surface roughness can be regarded as a lower limit for Rz.
Because, due to the vibrations between tool and workpiece, the generation of built-
up edges and the wear-conditioned alteration of the cutting edge, additional
roughness proportions arise which superimpose Rth. For the ﬁshing process, the
surface rate _Aw (generated surface per time unit) applies:

ð16:7Þ
At a speciﬁed surface roughness, the surface rate thus depends on the cutting
speed and the edge radius. The cutting speed is delimited by wear (see Chap. 6).
The edge radius cannot be optionally increased either, because with re the friction
between the effective partners increases and thus also wear, and because chatter
occurs and the process becomes unstable with a greater length of the secondary
cutting edge [NED75]. These are also the limits for wiper-ﬁnish turning (broad
ﬁnishing), which achieves a high cutting rate with a high feed and a low tool
cutting edge angle of the main or secondary cutting edge, if the system stiffness is
large enough (Fig. 16.4).
These questions are highly up-to-date in the development of special broad-tool
turning or milling tools, which are equipped with broad-tool or drag cutting
edges—also called wipers.

Surface and Subsurface Properties

16.2 Subsurface Properties
Not only the surface but also the subsurface is exposed to multiple loads in the
usage phase of the component. At this, the mechanical loads are the most obvious.
An overload of the component can mean the end of its life time or the reduction of
its life cycle. Apart from the mechanical loads, the thermal loads are also decisive
for the component life cycle. In action many components are exposed to high
frictions, which can lead to their warming. At this, high temperatures can be
reached (e.g., for cutting tools) so that the component in action may have totally
different properties than at room temperature.
Apart from the mechanical and thermal loads, many components are also exposed
to chemical attacks. Because of this, the material combinations of the components in
action can cause corrosion or diffusion, which can lead to the alteration of com-
ponent properties. During the course of the aspired life cycle, the properties of the
subsurface are only allowed to change due to load to such an extent that the func-
tioning of the component is ensured [BRE11].
In the case of components machined by cutting, the following subsurface
properties illustrated in Fig. 16.5 can be measured or detected:
• microstructure alterations
• plastic deformations
• hardness alterations
• residual stresses
• textures
• cracks.

16.2.1 Determination of Subsurface Properties
Microstructure alterations can be proved by means of metallographic polished
sections. Grinding, polishing and suitable etchings show the ﬁne structure of the
subsurface and allow the recognition of crystallite transformations. This method is
also suitable to determine plastic deformations as a consequence of cutting. The
deformation of the crystals (Fig. 16.12) serves as an indicator. However, due to
their irregular shape the resolution of the degree of the plastic deformations and
their penetration depth is low. Thus, the line process has proved itself at which a
test body is divided and line structures are applied on its dividing plane. The
deformation can be quantitatively determined from the curving of these lines after
machining.
Hardness alterations due to cutting only occur in thin layers of but some
1/100 mm. The hardness gradients can also be very steep. Therefore, these sub-
surface alterations can only be proved by means of micro or low load hardness
tests [TÖN80]. In principle, testing is possible normally to the machined surface or
in a cutting plane vertical to it. In any case, the test surface has to be treated with
electro polishing, so as to eliminate preparation inﬂuences.
The sloping process was developed to assimilate a course of the hardness
alteration above the penetration depth (Fig. 16.6). At this, the surface generated by
cutting is cut at a soft (e.g., 1:200) slope on which the hardness is measured. The
inﬂuence of underlying layers of different hardnesses can be corrected.
For special investigations, for example hardness courses in segmented chips
[TÖN05], ultra micro hardness determinations with very low test loads (e.g.,
F = 0.016 N) are carried out. The resulting small indentations allow high local
resolution in hardness determination.
Residual stresses can be determined using an indirect or direct method. In both
cases, the strains are measured and the stresses calculated accordingly. The indi-
rect method, also called spring-back method separates small parts or layers from
the stress-afﬂicted test body and measures the deformation of the remaining body
by means of strain gauges or optical interference (Fig. 16.7) [TÖN65]. With
algorithms of elasto-mechanics, the surface forces resp. stresses are counted back,

Surface and Subsurface Properties

which must have reigned in the separated part or layer and whose release caused
the measured deformation of the remaining body. This process is called an indirect
method due to the ‘‘detour’’ via the spring-back of the remaining body. Only
residual stresses with macroscopic distribution (residual stresses 1st order) can be
detected.
In the case of the direct method, the lattice strains in the crystallites of a
material which are caused by residual stresses, are determined. This can be done

by using X-ray diffraction. Other processes use electro-magnetic effects or ultra-
sonic sound. The X-ray method employs a diffractometer, which records the
intensity distribution of the diffracted ray (Fig. 16.8).
So as to determine stresses in the direction of interest parallel to the specimen
surface it is necessary to determine the lattice strains depending on the inclination
angle w of the lattice planes to the surface normal (Fig. 16.9). From an X-ray
elasticity constant s2 (XEC) (s2 = (1 ? m)/E; with m = Poisson’s ratio,
E = elasticity module), which is material-dependent and the slope of a connecting
straight line e(u,w) above sin2w, the stress in direction u results at

The borehole method occupies a leading position with the processes for the
determination of residual stress, which do not work non-destructively. At this,
users often call it a ‘‘part destroying’’ process, because the relatively small drilling
is not supposed to inﬂuence the properties of some component negatively. The fact
is however, that the process does not work non-destructively.
The borehole method is being applied since the 1930s [MAT33]. The principle
of this process is based on the measurement of residual stress-conditioned defor-
mations in the environment of an inserted blind hole. It is therefore an indirect
measuring process. Generally, the measurement of the deformations takes place
using a deformation gauge rosette, especially designed for this process. These
measuring gauges consist of three strain measuring slats twisted by 45 towards
each other located radially to the drilling, which are positioned centrically to the
so-called drilling circle.

Surface and Subsurface Properties

When inserting the drilling step by step, a new residual stress balance occurs
after each step so that it becomes possible to determine the residual stress depth
courses when applying suitable evaluation processes. Various processes for the
generation of blind holes were examined, because if possible, no new residual
stresses should be induced into the workpiece during drilling and the borehole
should ideally have a cylindrical shape. The most suitable and therefore most
widely spread drilling process nowadays is the so-called high speed drilling
technique. At this, the material removal takes place by means of a cemented
carbide face milling cutter, which is powered by a compressed air turbine with up
to 300,000 revolutions per minute. This should lead to a negligible induction of
new residual stresses due to the drilling process [SCH96].
Texture is a property of poly-crystalline materials and thus of most metallic
materials, many synthetics, ceramic material and of stones. Texture (crystallo-
graphic texture) describes the arrangement of the single crystallites towards each
other and a workpiece coordinate system, which orients itself mostly by the sur-
face or a determined direction of the workpiece. At the existence of random
textures, the material properties behave in a quasi-isotropic manner, whereas
oriented textures result in an anisotropic material behavior. Figure 16.10 sche-
matically illustrates a random texture in the upper part and an oriented texture with
a preferred direction. Such preferred directions are called orientations or texture
components and described with the indices (hkl)[uvw]. At this, (hkl) describes the
crystallographic surface, which is adjusted parallel to the specimen surface and
[uvw] describes the crystallographic direction, which is adjusted parallel to a
determined direction, e.g., the rolling direction for sheet metal. In the case of the
longitudinal turning of steel, certain analogies to a rolling texture have been
detected [PLÖ02].

Subsurface Properties

The determination of textures generally takes place by means of diffraction
experiments using electrons, neutrons or X-rays. Intensity measurements at dif-
ferent azimuth and pole distance angles are carried out on low-indexed diffraction
peaks. The measured intensities are then projected into the equator plane via a
stereographic projection where they show certain intensity patterns at the existence
of an oriented texture. This type of illustration is called pole ﬁgure. By means of
extensive arithmetic operations, the orientation distribution function ODF can be
determined based on the measured pole ﬁgures. Another possibility for the
determination of crystallographic textures is the evaluation of the information from
the diffraction experiments with back scattered electrons (EBSD). Compared with
the X-ray texture determination, this is a relatively new technique. An advantage
of electron diffraction experiments over X-ray diffractometry is the high local
resolution.
Cracks can be proven with different methods, the most important of which will
be brieﬂy introduced in the following. The possibility of proof is limited for each
method. Position, geometry and orientation of the cracks have to be considered for
the choice of a suitable method.
Just like the light and scanning electron microscopic methods, the color pen-
etration test is limited to such cracks which have a connection to the surface. The
process is based on the capillary effect towards liquids. The liquid which is colored
or furnished with ﬂuorescent materials and has penetrated into the cracks, is
extracted with acceleration by a contrast medium and thus makes the cracks
visible.
The crack test with magnetic powder is exclusively applicable to ferromagnetic
workpieces, because a magnetization of the specimen has to be carried out. The
basis of this method is the magnetic leakage ﬂux measurement. The workpiece is

magnetized so that the magnetic ﬂux lines run parallel to the surface. In a
magnetically badly-conductive area, e.g., a crack, the lines split up into those
which are lead into the material, those which ﬂow through the material separation
and ﬁnally those which are crowded out of the surface and bypass the ﬂaw in the
air. The latter are called magnetic leakage ﬂux [BRI91]. At this point, there is an
increased addition of particles of magnetic powder which is applied to the spec-
imen for the detection of cracks [TÖN87] (Fig. 16.11).
The ultrasonic sound methods applied for the workpiece testing are based on
correlations of the material with irradiated acoustic waves [BRI91]. Different
testing procedures have been developed, the impulse echo method being the most
important [SCH92]. It allows the proof of cracks even far below the surface. For
the examination of metals, testing frequencies between 0.5 and 10 MHz are mostly
used, since this allows the bundling and adjustment of higher frequencies and
smaller defects are more easily detected. The impulse echo method makes use of
the reﬂection of acoustic waves at boundary surfaces, such as can be found in
cracks.
Eddy current methods are also applied for the detection of defects (cracks,
cavities, pores). An inductor ﬂown through by high-frequency alternating current
generates eddy currents in the electrically-conductive specimen. Defects in the
workpiece lead to an alteration of the eddy current distribution and thus of the
magnetic ﬁeld, which overlaps the generating inductor ﬁeld. The resulting mag-
netic ﬁeld is measured. It contains information about material defects [ROO05].
For some years, induction and conduction-thermographic processes have been
successfully employed which are capable of detecting even hidden cracks. The

component is selectively heated via an electro-magnetic stimulation. Disturbances
of the electric conductivity as caused by cracks alter the thermal image locally. This
condition is documented by a high-resolution thermography-camera [VRA08,
KRE05].
16.2.2 Effects of Cutting Processes
Subsurface inﬂuences can have mechanical or thermal causes, often a combination
of both. Mechanical inﬂuences result from the penetrations of one or several
cutting wedges and the connected plastic deformations in the subsurface of the
workpiece. As explained in Chap. 2 for the cutting with geometrically deﬁned
cutting edge, the deformation preliminary zone and the secondary shearing zone
before the ﬂank face, penetrate the zones below the newly developing surface of a
component and generate permanent deformations. Quite similar processes occur
during grinding (Chap. 13), only the dimensions of the mechanically-inﬂuenced
areas are smaller.
The plastic deformations of the subsurface mainly develop due to shear
deformation as a consequence of shearing before the cutting wedge and friction
between the ﬂank face and the material. These deformations are clearly recog-
nizable

materials

deformations
(Fig. 16.12).
The alterations of grain shape and orientation can also be made visible by
measuring the pole ﬁgures for texture determination. In longitudinal turning of
steel C45 (SAE 1045) it was shown that cutting produces a texture similar to
rolling, but with an orientation of the crystallites tipped towards the surface
[PLÖ02] (Fig. 16.13).
The line method allows the quantitative registration of the deformations
(Fig. 16.14). The impact depth is at 40–80 lm. The deformation is direction-

dependent and is determined by the cutting direction. The material is strongly
stretched as a consequence of the mechanical inﬂuence.
The plastic deformation is also accompanied by strain hardening, which causes
an increase in hardness just as a consequence of mechanical inﬂuence. In cutting,
generally mechanical and thermal inﬂuences act at the same time, therefore this
strain hardening cannot be proven in an isolated manner. In the case with a high
pressure water jet the situation is different. The hardness increase on a case-hardened
material consisting of the microstructure components martensite and—retained

austenite illustrated in Fig. 16.15 can therefore be attributed entirely to the
mechanical effect. In this case there is no mentionable heating only the mechanical
inﬂuence. A hardness increase due to strain hardening and stress-induced transfor-
mation of the retained austenite into martensite in the subsurface has been proven
[TÖN95].
Due to the subsurface deformation, residual stress sources [TÖN65] in the
surface-near layers of a component are induced which generate residual stresses in
the entire component for equilibrium reasons. In the surface itself only a biaxial
stress condition can arise. Normal and shearing stresses normal to the surface
disappear. The principal stress directions depend on the cutting direction. In
peripheral grinding they coincide with the grinding direction to reasons of sym-
metry. The same also applies to orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal cutting. However,
generally the principal stress directions do not coincide with the cutting direction.
Due to mechanical inﬂuence, residual compressive stresses occur in cutting
direction as a consequence of the plastic strains in the surface-near layers.
Figure 16.16 shows a model for the development mechanism. The course of the
elastic and plastic strains and the stresses in cutting direction are displayed. When
the cutting wedge advances, ﬁrst elastic and then plastic compressions occur.
Immediately after the tool contact, elastic and plastic strains occur which partly
spring back. The stress course ﬁrst shows compressive and then tensile stresses
under load. They rise up to the yield strength. Residual compressive stresses
remain after load relief. The permanently stretched layers are quasi too long and
have to be compressed by the residual stresses, so as to create the material
coherence.
Thermal inﬂuences result from the power conversion into heat (Chap. 5). The
workpiece subsurfaces are heated strongly for a short time. A quick cooling off
Fig. 16.15 Hardness increase in the subsurface by water peening

16
Surface and Subsurface Properties

occurs due to self-quenching of the material and heat abstraction via the cutting
liquid. This temperature course can be connected to structure alterations, hardness
increases by secondary quenching and also annealing effects, i.e., hardness
decreases. Figure 16.17 shows a hardness course of a ground bearing steel 100Cr6
(SAE 52100). The inﬂuenced zone is recognizable. At the hardness course, the
new hardening zone also becomes clear. The hardness courses as illustrated in
Fig. 16.17 were registered according to two different analysis methods: one
according to the previously explained slope method (marked with slope material
removal) and one by hardness indentations on a surface normal to the ground

surface (marked with transverse micro section). With the slope method, it is
possible to measure directly until the surface.
The thermal effect of cutting also causes typical residual stresses. The sub-
surface layers stretch when the temperature rises. Thermal compressive stresses
occur whose effect causes the subsurface layers to deform plastically at reduced
yield strength. They are compressed. After cooling down to room temperature, the
shortened subsurface layers are quasi too short and have to be lengthened by
means of residual tensile stresses, so as to ﬁt into the material coherence
(Fig. 16.18). This effect of thermal deformation can be superimposed by a contrary
process, if materials with low transformation temperatures and a volume increase
with transformation from high to low temperatures are machined. Carbon steel
with 12 % nickel, for example, deforms from austenite to ferrite (A3 point) at
330 C. As a consequence of the rapid self-quenching, residual compressive
stresses occur which are called residual phase transition stresses.
Since mechanical and thermal inﬂuences act simultaneously in cutting, they
superimpose each other in a high-grade non-linear way. A simple superposition is
not admissible. A formal superposition can, however, give indications concerning
the thermal and mechanical situation in the chip formation zone. Figure 16.19
shows residual stress courses in components machined by surface grinding with
corundum and CBN wheels. The strong deviations can be attributed to the different
heat ﬂow referred to in Chap. 13.
Due to its high heat conductivity, CBN is able to dissipate essential parts of the
energy transformed into heat via the grinding wheel; whereas in grinding with
Al2O3, whose heat conductivity is several times lower than that of CBN, con-
siderably larger parts of the transformed energy enter the component and produce
higher temperatures (compare Chap. 13).

Surface and Subsurface Properties

Figure 16.20 demonstrates that the level of the surface-near residual stresses
strongly depends on the material removal rate (volume rate) and thus on the
cutting power fed in total. Finishing conditions cause residual compressive stresses
or only low residual tensile stresses. The tensile stress level rises at a high material
removal rate, until overheating of the component surface occurs, causing cracks or
structure deformations which in turn cause lower stresses.

Cutting with geometrically-deﬁned cutting edges generally generates unsym-
metrical residual stress conditions, i.e., main stress directions no longer correspond
to the motion directions of cutting. Residual stresses, which are produced by
means of a heat treatment process, for example, are dominantly overlapped by a
cutting process such as milling.
Figure 16.21 shows residual stresses in hard turned workpieces of case-hardened
steel 16MnCrS5 (SAE 5115). After machining with new cutting edges, low residual
compressive stresses exist in the surface of the workpiece. Below, a compressive
stress maximum develops. A higher feed and the connected higher mechanical
loads cause the residual compressive stresses to rise considerably and the maximum
shifts to greater depths.

Chapter 17
Cooling Lubrication
Tool wear is a consequence of mechanic, thermal and chemical loads. These loads
can be reduced by feeding suitable cooling lubricating ﬂuids. This may reduce tool
wear. In addition, the heat removal from the chip formation zone can inﬂuence the
surface integrity of the workpiece beneﬁcially. The force and power requirement for
the cutting process can be reduced and increase surface quality achieved by reducing
friction and adhesion between tool and workpiece [BRI04a, BRI95]. These are
beneﬁcial effects among all four criteria of the cutting process (see Sect. 1.4). On the
other hand, cooling lubricating systems produce considerable costs, at which dis-
posal costs are becoming increasingly signiﬁcant. Cooling lubrication also has to be
considered critically under workplace and environmental aspects. The right choice
and layout of cooling lubricating processes and systems is therefore primarily a
manufacturing problem.
17.1 Requirements
The requirements concerning cooling lubricating systems can be divided into
primary and secondary functions [BAR78, ZWI79]. Main functions are:
• Cooling Heat removal from the tool, the workpiece and the machine.
• Lubricating Reduction of the friction between tool and material and reduction of
the forces and powers, reduction of adhesion tendency between cutting and
workpiece material.
The requirements concerning the two main functions depend on the cutting
process to a high degree. Figure 17.1 provides a schematic overview, at which in
each single case further criteria can be important.
There is interdependency between the two main functions: The reduction of
the power transformed into heat by means of good lubrication directly affects the
cooling function, less heat has to be conducted. Inversely, a stronger coolant in the

chip formation zone can lead to an increase of the yield strength of the materials
and thus to an increase of the force and power requirements.
Apart from this, cooling lubricating ﬂuids (CLFs) can take over various
additional functions which lead to further requirements. Additional functions and
the necessary properties are:
• Transport of the chips and bonding of cutting particles:
In some processes such as drilling and deep drilling, chips have to be trans-
ported away from the cutting zone, at which liquids are often used for cooling.
CLFs are also often used for the removal of chips and cutting particles from the
work space of a machine. Grinding wheels are often cleaned by high pressures of
CLF above 10 bar.
• Surface protection of the workpieces:
Cutting generates new surfaces on the workpiece, which do not possess any
passivating protective layers at the beginning. Such surfaces are chemically highly
active and can react in undesired ways according to the medium. For this, liquid
CLFs have to be sufﬁciently alkaline (pH value[7, if possible, pH = 8–9.5) so as
to prevent corrosion.
• Human compatibility:
In general, skin contact of the machine operator with the CLF is inevitable even
if the working space of the machine is well capsuled. Therefore, the media has to
be skin tolerable. The alkalinity should not surpass the value pH = 9.5. Steams
and gases which escape from the working space, have to be tested on their
harmfulness and suctioned safely.
Fig. 17.1 Requirements on cooling lubricans and their dependence on the requirements on the
machining process on cooling lubricating ﬂuids
372

Cooling Lubrication

• Protection of the machine parts:
It has to be ensured that liquid CLFs do not corrode any machine components,
such as coats of paint, sealing, scrapers or covers of synthetic material.
• Ageing durability:
Liquid CLFs should be chemically and physically stable and not change due to
environmental inﬂuences. They should be durable. This characteristic is in direct
competition with biological degradability.
• Biological degradability:
The disposal of CLFs containing carbon hydride, additionally with different
additives, is difﬁcult. Therefore, biologically degradable CLF are prefered. At this,
however, it must be considered that lubricating media (lubricating oils or greases)
escape at the machine tools and thus load the liquid media [HOW91].
17.2 Cooling Lubricating Fluids
According to the aggregate condition, the media which possess cooling, lubri-
cating or combined effects can be differentiated into:
• mono-phase media such as gases and ﬂuids and
• bi-phasic media such as solid body suspensions and ﬂuid-gas mixtures.
Liquid cooling lubricating ﬂuids (CLFs) have the greater practical signiﬁcance.
They can be divided into not water-mixable (mineral oils) and water-mixable CLFs
(Fig. 17.2). The code letters are shown in Table 17.1. The DIN51385 classify three
groups of additionally regarding the water-mixed CLFs SEW as an own group.
However, this classiﬁcation is technologically not sensible but is rather oriented
towards the CLF trade. For practice it is sensible to classify the two groups SN and SE
as shown in Fig. 17.2.
17.2.1 Not Water-Mixable Cooling Lubricating Fluids
Due to the high pressure between material and tool, a hydro-dynamic lubrication
effect cannot occur during cutting. Therefore, separation layers are used to reduce
the friction.
The basic oils for not water-mixable CLFs are mainly mineral oils. The use of
oils is, however, linked with special efforts:
• The machines have to be capsuled against the escape of oil, oil mist and oil vapor.
• The machines have to be equipped with a suctioning installation for the removal
of oil mist.
• Workpieces generally have to be degreased after machining.
17.1
Requirements
373

As a principle, mineral oils with and without friction-reducing and/or EP
(Extreme Pressure) additives are differentiated, at which they are additionally
subdivided into chemically active and inactive additives (see Table 17.1).
In principle, mineral oils show a high lubricating and corrosion-protective effect
but a relatively low cooling effect. The dependence of the properties on the types
of mineral oil is illustrated in Table 17.2. Since mineral oils are sterile they can
generally do without corrosion inhibitors and preservation. A negative effect is
however, the foaming behavior so that foam inhibitors are usually added.
The optimum viscosity of the CLFs is determined by effects in the opposite
direction: It should be large enough to ensure a good adhesion and low oil mist
generation, but it should also be kept low with regard to a better cooling effect
because thinner oils ﬂow to the cutting zone more easily. At the same pumping
power, a larger oil quantity is fed and the penetration in capillaries is facilitated.
The durability of not water-mixable CLFs is generally high. It strongly depends on
the maintenance of the circulating system and the cleaning of the oils. It is a
precondition that no polluting external oil, e.g., from lubricating or hydraulic oil
circulations, can penetrate. Such leakage oils are totally mixable with the CLFs, so
they cannot be removed from the CLFs in the circulating facilities. Therefore, the
circulating facilities have to be protected from such leakage oils.
Table 17.3 illustrates thermo-physical characteristic values of a mineral oil
used in cutting compared with water.

17.2.2 Water-Mixable Cooling Lubricating Fluids
Due to their higher heat capacity, their heat conductivity and their vaporization
heat water-mixable CLFs show better cooling effects than mineral oils. Water-
mixable CLFs can be deployed for almost all machining on steel, cast iron and
aluminum alloys. Approximately 90 % of the production facilities are operated
with water-mixed CLFs [ZWI79].
We differentiate between emulsiﬁable and water soluble CLFs.

tinuous phase of an oil-in-water emulsion. In emulsions, one ﬂuid (here mineral oil
or ester as the lubrication carrier) is dispersed in another (here water), i. e.

distributed in form of drops. In the thermodynamic sense, a cooling lubricating
emulsion is a metastable system, which returns to a condition of low energy even
in the case of MQL disturbances. Thus, for the dispersion of oil in water, energy
has to be fed which corresponds to the surface energy of the droplets to be
generated [GOT53]. This can occur by means of strong agitation, which however,
only creates an unstable system. Stable emulsions can be generated by feeding
surface active agents (emulsiﬁers). Emulsiﬁers considerably reduce the surface
energy. They mainly recharge at the boundary surfaces and thus generate a ﬁlm
around the oil droplets, which prevents them from being merged. The type and
amount of emulsiﬁers is determined by the size of the oil droplets. We differentiate
between coarse (low emulsiﬁer content) and ﬁne-particle emulsions. In practice,
the cooling lubricating emulsions are sometimes incorrectly called ‘‘cutting oils’’.
Coarse-particle emulsions have a droplet size of approx. 9 lm, for ﬁne-particle
emulsions it is 5 lm and less. The latter have an opalizing to still transparent

appearance. Due to their high degree of dispersion (MQL droplets, high surface
energy) they are less wettable to workpieces than coarse-particle emulsions. On
the other hand, they are generally more stable. Therefore, they are deployed where
high lifetimes are necessary. The precondition for a long use of this emulsion type
is, however, that they are kept clean even with longer operating times, by effective
ﬁlter facilities resp. separators [ZWI73].
Fine-particle emulsions have a higher tendency to foaming than coarse-particle
emulsions. The latter can precipitate air better and faster due to the bigger droplets.
In addition, their cooling and lubrication effect is stronger than that of ﬁne-particle
emulsions [ROE95].
The lubrication effect of emulsions is mainly determined by the oil proportion.
It is also decisive for the corrosion protection of the workpieces, the tools and the
machine tool. The minimum concentration is therefore 2 %. A rising oil proportion
improves the anti-corrosive protection and the lubricating proportion. The fol-
lowing has to be considered for an optimum adjustment of the oil content [ZWI79,
JAC88]:
• The oil content has to be high enough to ensure sufﬁcient lubrication.
• The emulsion should have a high water proportion for a high cooling effect.
• The costs of the emulsion increase with a higher oil proportion.
The durability of cooling lubricating emulsions also depends on the hardness of
the water used. A high content of hardness components can lead to reactions with
the anionic emulsiﬁers. At this, the water soluble calcium and magnesium com-
pounds of the hardness components are converted into insoluble compounds. They
fall out as lime soaps. The consequence is a segregation of emulsiﬁers and linked
to this, a destabilization of the emulsion [LIN86, GÜN84].
Emulsions are sensitive to infestation with micro-organisms, e.g., aerobic and
anaerobic bacteria and fungi. Of these, especially the anaerobic bacteria are dis-
turbing, because they act under air exclusion and generate hydrogen sulﬁdes and
thus the so-called ‘‘Monday morning odor’’. In addition, emulsiﬁers are degraded
by micro-organisms. The consequences are oil precipitations, decrease of the pH
value and decrease of the anti-corrosive protection. Effective media against the
infestation with micro-organisms are bactericides and fungicides, which are often
already contained in the concentrate. However, too high concentrations can lead to
skin diseases.
During use the concentration and the droplet size of emulsions can change due
to the drag-out of oil and emulsiﬁers by the chips. Therefore, it should be moni-
tored continuously. An alteration of the concentration can be determined optically
by measuring the refraction index in a refractometer. The refraction index depends
concordantly on the density of the mixture and the droplet size. In many cases, a
more exact determination of the concentration by means of a titration process is
necessary due to the increasing droplet size. The durability of emulsions can by
extended by additivating with biocides, surface-active agents and stabilizers and
by targeted monitoring and maintenance measures [KNO86].

The disposal of emulsions is expensive. For reasons of environmental protec-
tion, oil and water have to be separated for disposal.
17.2.2.2 Water Soluble Cooling Lubricating Fluids
Cooling lubricating ﬂuids which result in water-mixed solutions, are called cooling
lubricating dilutions. The contents are solute in water or even more ﬁnely spread
than in ﬁne-particle emulsions. These ﬂuids are generally more stable. They
contain only little (or no) amounts of mineral oil. Their advantages are the strong
cleaning and cooling effect as well as the good stability and transparency. Aqueous
solutions are generally saline solutions. They are among others, loaded with
organic corrosion protection substances against corrosion infestation of the
machine parts and workpieces and surface-active agents so as to improve the
wetting capacity. Furthermore, cooling lubricating dilutions may contain surface-
active substances (EP additives) [BAR81]. Polymer (e.g., on the basis of poly-
valent alcohols and polyglycol), ester and similar materials are used as organic
ingredients. The lubrication effect and pressure stability is improved with a higher
content of these materials. Due to their synthetic production these solutions are
also called synthetic CLFs.
17.2.3 Additivation of Cooling Lubricating Fluids
Feeding additives can alter the properties of CLFs considerably. Additives are
synthetic compounds or their mixtures. The latter permit property combinations as
‘‘multi-purpose additives’’ [VAM84, ROE95].
To increase the lubrication effect of CLFs they are fed additives, which can
develop adsorption and reaction layers. EP (extreme pressure) additives are sup-
posed to prevent welding and fretting under high pressures and temperatures.
Mostly they are fatty acid or chlorine, sulfur and phosphor compounds which
generate reaction layers from metal soaps resp. chlorides, sulﬁdes and phosphides
on metal surfaces. These chemically active materials cause an increase of the
friction coefﬁcient at low temperatures, because the reaction layers are still solid.
Above a certain temperature, the layers macerate and thus reduce the friction
coefﬁcient. The layers of the metal soaps resp. salts break down after having
surpassed the melting point [BAR81, LAN73]. Figure 17.3 illustrates the effective
areas of the different reaction products.
The EP additives generally contain not just one active element. Combinations
of several effective substances are often used. When selecting the additives one has
to consider that they can also mutually inﬂuence each other in their effect. If and
which additives are used depends on the type of load. The more difﬁcult the cutting
conditions, the higher-alloyed CLFs are deployed.
378
17
Cooling Lubrication

The concentration of the EP additives is critical. A too low content reduces the
separating effect and a too high content increases the tool wear (wear lubrication)
[ROE95]. The additives are consumed by reacting with the metal surface. Their
concentration in the basic oil decreases.
Chloric additives (e.g., chloroparafﬁns) have lower reaction temperatures, high
pressure resistance and are almost universally deployable. Therefore, they were
frequently used in the past. However, environmental requirements and the con-
nected disposal difﬁculties have led to the fact that meanwhile chloric cooling
lubricating materials are hardly being deployed. Chlorinated ﬂuids are treated as
hazardous waste [HÖR87]. Meanwhile, combinations of other additives with
comparable results are being used.
Oil-in-water emulsions are stabilized by adding emulsiﬁers. Emulsiﬁers reduce
the surface energy of the water. They thus determine the distribution and size of
the oil drops in the water and their durability. The effect is based on the fact that
the oil drops are enclosed by a soap coat (Fig. 17.4). By this means, stabilization
and an adhesive effect (polar orientation) are achieved on the effective partners
[ROE95]. We differentiate between anion and cation active as well as not iono-
genic emulsiﬁers [ZWI79, BAR81, MÜL87].
Corrosion inhibitors are deployed to improve the corrosion protection of the
machined workpiece. They are used to develop covering layer against the pene-
tration of water and air [BAR81]. Amine salts, sulfonates and benzotriazoles are
deployed for this purpose.
The lubrication effect of oils is negatively inﬂuenced by a development of foam.
In addition, their oxidation is encouraged by a more intensive mixing with air.
Foam inhibitor or anti foam products are used to prevent the generation of foam.
These are higher fatty alcohols and silicon oils. However, silicon oils are difﬁcult
to wash off so that they can have a disturbing effect on the ﬁnal treatment of the
machined parts (e.g., varnishing, enamelling) [ZWI79].
Adhesive agents serve to improve the adhesive capacity of CLFs on workpieces.
They have a positive effect on the cooling lubrication by increasing the viscosity of

the CLFs at the boundary layer to the material [ZWI79]. Polymeric hydrocarbons
such as polymethacrylates and polyisobutylenes are used as adhesive agents.
Conservation agents are biocides. They are meant to protect the CLF from
infestation with micro-organisms. Bacteria, fungi and yeasts can use water-mixed
CLFs as nutrient media and decompose the ingredients of the CLFs biochemically
by means of their metabolism. Thus, they have a disadvantageous effect on the
cooling lubricating properties and den hygienic status of the CLFs (toxins can
develop as metabolic products). Formaldehyde releasing ﬂuids or mercury com-
pounds can be added as suitable conservation agents [BAR81]. Such emulsions
have to be continuously monitored to prevent skin damages and waste water
problems.
17.3 Use of Cooling Lubricating Fluids in Geometrically
Determined Cutting
Cooling lubricating ﬂuids (CLF) cause additional costs and can burden the oper-
ator, the environment and parts of the machine [SCH04]. Due to the costs and
disposal problems, CLF have to be deployed in an economically and ecologically
sensible way since they are indispensable for a series of processes. The recycling
of used CLF is being worked on increasingly [ÖST03]. The cost and environ-
mental situation has led to the development of the minimum quantity lubrication
(MQL) which has facilitated the reduction of the CLF consumption [WEI99]. In
MQL we basically differentiate between the external feed of CLF via spray
throttles (generation of aerosols) and internal feed via channels introduced into the
tool [AUR06, STÄ04, LOI04]. Figure 17.5 shows the exit openings of the cooling
channels of a twist drill. The minimum quantity lubrication represents a com-
promise between ecology, work hygiene, business economics as well as machining

quality, productivity and effectiveness compared with dry machining. Since these
lubricating ﬂuids evaporate more quickly due to their large surface, it is also
important to use substances with no health threat.
The use of biologically degradable lubricating ﬂuids such as synthetic esters is
being researched so as to do without environmentally burdening cooling lubrica-
tion systems in production. When using synthetic ester in external longitudinal
turning processes, the lack of additives leads to a different weighting of the wear
mechanisms. Novel PVD coatings are being developed to compensate this and
nevertheless achieve an optimum separation of the effective partners in the tri-
bological contact. Multi-Layer coatings TiAlN/c-Al2O3 increase the lifetime of the
tool and improve the tool wear pattern while turning X5CrNi18-10 and
42CrMo4V. In the case of the material 42CrMo4V, it might even be possible to
machine without cooling lubrication [KLO04]. In the case of Inconel 718, drilling
processes with multi-layer TiAlN coatings, TiN/TiAlN layers in nano-composite
design as well as TiAlN with a WC/C covering layer of the tools are being carried
out. Compared with the use of cooling lubricating emulsion (6 %) a signiﬁcant
lifetime gain of the tools was achieved with synthetic ester [KLO06a].
In micro-milling, oil based CLFs show better results compared with water
based ones. Minimum quantity lubrication can also ensure the chip removal from
the working area. The viscosity of the CLF has to be low enough to reach the
working area. However, it must not be too low to allow the development of a
lubricating ﬁlm. This shows that the cooling lubricating conditions always have to
be designed process-speciﬁcally for an optimum effect in cutting processes
[KLO06b].
For example, in spite of a reduction of the use of CLF, an almost continuous
drilling quality can be achieved when drilling C45E steel [WEI97]. Considerably

reduced drilling moment and feed force values are possible, especially in mini-
mum quantity lubrication. This underlines the signiﬁcance of the targeted and
process adapted use of CLF. The deployment of emulsion reduces the diameter
deviations compared with other CLF concepts. Concerning the roundness devia-
tions and the surface roughness, the minimum quantity lubrication is a very good
alternative. The machining of holes with a L/D ratio of above 2 with a reduced use
of CLF is only possible with the support of chip removal, e.g., by means of
compressed air supply, because otherwise plastic deformations of the hole wall can
occur as a consequence of the interaction with the chip.
New ﬁndings for steel machining, which are meanwhile already in industrial
application, resulted from the inﬂuencing of the chip form in turning by ultra-high
pressure coolant, for example [DAH05]. Mixing a 2-component CLF directly at
the machine tool has been successfully substituted by using a CLF with sulfur
additive [BAU05]. Investigations in the cutting of stainless steel have shown that
an exact adjustment of the machining parameter and the use of a MQL lead to
better machining results [DEV05]. A beneﬁcial lubricating effect of silver nano-
particles in a PVD tool coating has also been proven [ALB07].
Methods for the deployment of solid lubricating ﬂuids have been successfully
tested. In the turning of hardened steel, tools were used which had been prepared
with molybdenum disulﬁde MoS2 by means of eroded cavities in the rake resp.
ﬂank face (diameter D & 200 lm) [JIA09]. The lubricating ﬂuid is directly fed
into the process zone via this channel. The process forces and the tool wear are
considerably inﬂuenced by the use of these tools. A lubricating cavity on the ﬂank
face causes a lower ﬂank face wear of the tool, compared with the unprepared
cutting edge. A cavity on the rake face leads to a signiﬁcant reduction of the
process forces and the friction coefﬁcient. The cause for this is the development of
a MoS2 lubricating ﬁlm between tool and workpiece resp. chip. This underlines
that the targeted supply of cooling and lubricating materials can cause a signiﬁcant
improvement of the tool use behavior.
High pressure cooling lubricating systems have been analyzed concerning their
effectiveness [SHA09]. In such systems, the CLF is speciﬁcally supplied into the
contact zone between workpiece and tool so that a ﬂuid pressure develops between
the friction partners. Experimental cutting investigations in the turning of the
material TiAl6V4, which is difﬁcult to cut, have demonstrated that this achieves a
better cooling and lubricating effect. This causes a signiﬁcant reduction of the
built-up edge development and the diffusion wear of the tool, as well as an
improvement of the surface roughness and the chip breakage and ﬁnally an
extension of the tool lifetime. Similar signiﬁcant effects are obtained with MQL
lubrication resp. oil mist with the use of compressed air in turning. At this, the
process temperature is reduced, which in turn allows the increase of the cutting
speed. In this case, dominant adjustment variables are the type of oil mist gen-
eration as well as the orientation of the supply throttles [TAK06].

Cooling Lubrication

17.4 Use of Cooling Lubricating Fluid in Grinding
Cooling lubricating is of special signiﬁcance for grinding. The comparatively large
contact area between grinding wheel and workpiece makes the supply of the
cooling lubricating ﬂuid (CLF) into the grinding gap difﬁcult. The speciﬁc energy
in grinding—that is the required energy per cut volume—is relatively high
(compare Chap. 4). This is due to large friction proportions and very small cutting
thicknesses in grinding. Also in this case, the supplied energy is almost completely
transformed into heat. High temperatures develop in the grinding gap, which
damage the surface zone of the workpiece (Chap. 13) and can cause an increased
wear of the grinding tools and a clogging of the active grinding space.
The type and composition of the CLF as well as the cleaning and processing of
the CLFs, inﬂuence the cooling and lubricating effect in the contact zone. The
supply of CLFs with degrees of freedom such as throttle design, nozzle position,
size of the supply volume ﬂow and CLF pressure provide the edge conditions
concerning if and how much CLF can reach the contact zone.
Different throttles for different grinding tasks have been developed to achieve a
high effect. Those most widely spread in practice are the ﬂooding throttles. At this,
we differentiate between free jet throttles and throttles without free jet. There are
free jet throttles with rigid tube systems and with segmented pipe systems. The
advantages of free jet throttles are their simple installation and handling. In
addition, they are relatively well-priced. A disadvantage is that mostly the air ﬁlm
cushion around the grinding wheel cannot be overcome with these throttles. To
ensure the wetting of the grinding wheel with CLF it is possible to use air cushion
fenders, which can weaken the wall ﬂux of the air, the so-called air coat [BRÜ96].
The beneﬁt of air cushion fenders becomes especially noticeable in high speed
grinding [OKU93, INA98]. Figure 17.6 clearly illustrates that an air coat is gen-
erated in front of the working area.
Mostly the relatively high CLF volume ﬂow does not achieve the optimum
cleaning effect. In addition, the position of the throttle cannot be adjusted in a way
to be reproduced when using segmented pipe systems.
Throttles without free jets, the so-called shoe throttles, offer some advantages.
They are able to break through the air cushion. Their better cooling effect causes less
damage to the subsurface integrity zones of the component. The CLF ﬂow and
pressure are lower than with free jet throttles, the effectiveness can even be increased
by means of leading elements. However, the installation of shoe throttles requires
considerably more effort than with free jet throttle. Shoe throttles should not be used
for strongly wearing grinding wheels or complex grinding wheel geometries.
Considerably less CLF is required by not ﬂooding throttles, which include point
and needle jet throttles as well as spray throttles. Point and needle jet throttles can
be individually adapted to the proﬁle of the grinding wheel. They then provide a
steadily directed jet with low loss volume ﬂow. However, a higher pump power is
necessary and the installation is linked to the proﬁle of the grinding wheel. The
spray throttles, which supply the CLF to the working area in a ﬁnely sprayed
17.4
Use of Cooling Lubricating Fluid in Grinding
383

condition, require very little CLF because they lubricate via an aerosol of CLF and
air (MQL). Problems caused by the jointly rotating air cushion and the low chip
removal have to be considered. Spray throttles are only conditionally deployable
for grinding processes, since the cooling effect is often not sufﬁcient.
Further solutions, e.g., an internal coolant at which the CLF ﬂows out through
the wheel or segmented grinding wheels, are still exceptions.
The advantages and disadvantages of different cooling lubricating ﬂuid supply
throttles have been summarized in Table 17.4 as an overview.
The attempt of covering the requirement of cooling and lubricating ﬂuids by an
excessive supply of CLF before the engagement zone is useless. The maximum
volume ﬂow, which ﬂows through a grinding gap is geometrically limited.
Excessive amounts are thrown back by the grinding wheel [MAL92].
Higher volume rates have further disadvantages. Rising forces between tool and
workpiece and an increase of the necessary spindle power are the consequences of
an increased offer of CLF [BRI93, TRE95, BRÜ96]. Here, pressure generating,

hydrodynamic effects are active and have an impact in the contact zone. Figure 17.7
illustrates the effect of the volume rates on the normal force, which develops due to
the ﬂuid pressures for different cutting speeds in external plunge grinding. The
forces were measured during spark-out, i. e., a radial feed motion did not take place.
It can be detected that stationary values for the ﬂuid pressure forces can be achieved
independently from the cutting speed. The ﬂuid pressure force rises strongly with
the CLF volume ﬂow. The thus resulting normal force is added to the force resulting
from the process. Especially in high speed grinding it is therefore impossible to
reach a grinding force reduction [TRE95]. This strong action of force can lead to
deformations of the workpiece and negative inﬂuences on the dimensional and form
accuracy.
The necessary spindle power is also strongly increased with the increased
volume rate of the CLF. At this, the drag effect of ﬂuid has an impact by means of
the grinding wheel rotation. The loss power conditioned by this can amount to
80 % of the total power [BRI93, KLO97, TAW90] (Fig. 17.8).
17.4.1 Methods to Determine the Cooling Lubricating Fluid
Effect in Grinding
To analyze the effect of the cooling lubrication in grinding, different laboratory
methods were developed by Brinksmeier and co-workers (Fig. 17.8). For this
purpose, the pressure in the grinding gap, the amount of the CLFs transported

on the ﬂuid pressure force [TRE95]
17.4
Use of Cooling Lubricating Fluid in Grinding
385

through the contact zone and the cooling effect are measured. The ﬂux within the
CLF throttles is made visible in a suitable manner.
A sensor is mounted in the workpiece in one or several measurement bores for
pressure measurement. Pressure proﬁles can be recorded by using several sensors
along the generatrix of the grinding wheel. The time and location proﬁle is rec-
ognizable when over grinding the sensor row (see Fig. 17.9, top left). An inte-
gration of the pressures above the contact surface allows the determination of the
normal force, which is caused by the ﬂuid pressure [HEI99].
The upper right illustration in Fig. 17.9 shows the measuring setup behind the
grinding gap in surface grinding, with which the CLF can be captured. The cooling
effect can be determined with a very ingenious method (Fig. 17.9, bottom left).
The workpiece is ground-in with the grinding wheel. The workpiece is heated up
by a constant heat source and the temperature in the workpiece is measured via
thermocouples. These thermocouples show the cooling effect at different supplies
of CLF [BRI04b].
Figure 17.9, bottom right, illustrates the possibility of ﬂux visualization with
the aid of a light-intersection process. The ﬂow distribution can be followed by
means of encased tracer particles. This is how back ﬂow or ﬂow detachments in
the throttle, which affect the effectiveness of the CLF supply, can be detected. It is
also possible to examine the interface between grinding wheel and throttle in more
detail in this manner. Air bubbles which lower the cooling effect in the contact
zone and have been introduced by the rotating grinding wheel, can be observed
like this [HEI99].

Cooling Lubrication

17.4.2 Applications and Effects
Generally liquid CLFs are used in grinding so as to avoid damages in the surface
zone of the workpiece (see Chap. 13). Mineral oils, emulsions and dilutions are
deployed. They differ considerably concerning their effect. Figure 17.10 illustrates
the inﬂuence of unalloyed mineral oil and of 5 % emulsion on the radial wear in
external plunge grinding. The tests were carried out with CBN grinding wheels.
Similar results have been obtained using corundum grinding wheels. The
assumption that CBN grinding materials wear due to hydrolytic processes does not
seem sustainable. In fact, the major inﬂuence can be explained with the strong
bonding wear, which occurs due to stronger friction between chip and bonding in
the case of water-mixed CLFs and leads to a premature release of the grains. This
is also conﬁrmed by the roughness shown in the image. Emulsions cause con-
siderably higher roughnesses, because grains constantly break out and therefore
lower grain numbers lead to higher averaged cutting thicknesses per cutting edge
[HEU92].
The noticeably improved lubrication effect of oil compared with emulsions also
shows in the level of the grinding forces (Fig. 17.11). The friction is reduced, at
the same time however the number of active cutting edges is higher. The typical
force course results from these inﬂuences running in opposite directions. The
increased forces which occur during the initial phase of the grinding are linked
with a resetting of the bonding level and a break out of the loosened grinding and
ﬁlling grains. This leads to the fact that the number of active grains drops strongly,
Fig. 17.9 Laboratory methods for the examination of the cooling lubricating ﬂuid effect in
grinding [HEI99, BRI01, BRI04b]
17.4
Use of Cooling Lubricating Fluid in Grinding

above all in the case of emulsion coolant. As a consequence the grinding forces
decrease, especially at the beginning. The strong bonding wear linked with
emulsion coolant causes a stationary condition, at which a considerably lower
number of active grains exist than with oil coolant. Therefore, lower normal forces

occur than when using oil. However, the better lubricating properties of oil lead to
a lower friction ratio so that with oil, there are lower tangential forces despite a
higher number of active cutting edges than with emulsion [HEU92].
In the following, the inﬂuence of different throttle geometries will be illustrated
by means of tests concerning CBN external plunge grinding with three tangential

ﬂows [CZE99]

Use of Cooling Lubricating Fluid in Grinding

throttles and with an exit cross section of 30, 45 and 60 mm2. For the evaluation of
the cooling effect, surface residual stresses are measured depending on the amount
of CLF Q0KSS (Fig. 17.12). At a given throttle cross section, the jet speed increases
with the ﬂow. Apparently greater jet speeds improve the adhesion of the CLF to
the grinding wheel and the surrounding air cushion is overcome more easily.
Larger proportions of the total amount of supplied CLF reach the contact zone
[CZE99], the thermal load of the workpiece is lower. This is linked with the
reduction of residual tensile stresses which—as explained in Chap. 13—is typical
for thermal inﬂuence.
A comparison of the inﬂuence of tangential and shoe throttles on the distri-
bution of residual stresses at the workpiece surface is illustrated in Fig. 17.13.
Using shoe throttles apparently facilitates a more effective supply of the CLF into
the contact zone between grinding wheel and workpiece, which improves the
cooling and lubricating effect. Under otherwise identical adjustment conditions, a
thermal inﬂuence can be almost completely eliminated with the shoe throttle.
Residual compressive stresses occur which suggest dominant, mechanical sub
surface effects.
Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) or pure dry machining allow a drastic
reduction of the amount of CLF in grinding or it is possible to do without CLF
altogether. These conditions were compared with conventional ﬂooding cooling
lubrication, so to investigate the inﬂuence of the MQL and dry machining in
internal grinding with micro-crystalline aluminum oxide. MQL reduced the
amount of CLF from QKSS = 11 l/min to QKSS = 0.4 l/min. For MQL, a synthetic
ester was deployed, in conventional ﬂooding it was an unalloyed mineral oil.
With increasing grinding time resp. increasing cutting volume dry machining
leads to a strong increase of the process forces (Fig. 17.14). Already after a related
cutting volume of V0w = 160 mm3/mm, that corresponds to a grinding time of less
than 3 min, the test had to be discontinued due to the clogging of the active
grinding space. In ﬂooding cooling lubrication, the force rise at ﬁrst but then
remain constant. It is interesting that the force level with MQL is fundamentally
minimal. The reasons for this are the lack of a hydrodynamic force effect and the
better lubricating effect of the used ester compared with mineral oil [BRU98].
The grinding wheel wear with MQL is between that of ﬂooding cooling
lubricating and that of dry machining (Fig. 17.15). This is to be attributed to the
reduced resp. missing cooling effect. A higher wear occurs due to the increased
thermal load of grinding grain and bonding. The workpiece roughnesses achiev-
able with MQL are only slightly above those after grinding with ﬂooding cooling
lubrication. The roughness values after dry grinding are considerably higher.
Apart from the micro-geometric development of the surface, the inﬂuence of
the MQL and dry machining on the workpiece surface zone was analyzed and
compared with conventional cooling lubrication. Figure 17.16 illustrates structure
micrographs of the workpiece surface zone, transverse to the machining direction
and the surface residual stresses parallel to the grinding direction depending on the
cutting volume resp. on the grinding time. In dry machining, thermal damages in

the form of annealing and new hardening zones occurred (development of white
layers). Residual stress measurements showed that the surface values for the dry
machining are offset by more than 100 MPa in the direction of the residual tensile
stresses compared with the other two conditions. The surface residual stress values

with MQL and ﬂooding cooling lubrication cannot be signiﬁcantly differentiated
from one another. Even tests with an increased material removal rate of
Q0w = 2.5 mm3/mms showed no damages to the workpiece structure.
It can thus be determined that by using a minimum quantity lubrication, lower
process forces are achieved compared with a conventional ﬂooding cooling
lubrication. The grinding wheel wear and the workpiece roughness are marginally
above the comparative values. The surface zone inﬂuence corresponds to the
ﬂooding cooling lubrication. In internal grinding without liquid CLF it was only
possible to work with low material removal rates over a limited grinding time resp.
cutting volume. However, dry grinding is economically possible in a process
combination of hard turning and grinding (see Chap. 11).

h0 ¼ cosð/  cÞ:
Since the fracture strain of the chip amounts to eb ¼ 7:1 %; the chip does not
break under the given conditions.
2. The strain inside the chip has to be larger than the fracture strain. This can be
achieved by increasing the chip thickness respectively the feed.

This allows the derivation that the inﬂuence of the shear angle is low con-
cerning the cutting speed increase.
3. The yield criterion of Tresca (Eq. 4.5) implies:
kf; konv: ¼ 77:5 MPa and kf; HSC ¼ 73:5 MPa:
The speciﬁc shearing energy can be determined with Eq. 5.3 and with Eq. 5.11
