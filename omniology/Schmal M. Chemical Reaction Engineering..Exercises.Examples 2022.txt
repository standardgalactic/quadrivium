Preface
The first English edition of this book was published in 2014. This book was originally
intended for undergraduate and graduate students, its one major objective: to teach the
basic concepts of kinetics and reactor design. The author’s motivation was the fact that
students frequently encounter great difficulty trying to explain the basic phenomena
that occur in the practice of reactor design. So, instead of discussing specific projects of
the industry, central concepts along with examples and many exercises are presented
for each topic. The main objective then was to prompt students to observe and think
about kinetic phenomena. Indeed, reactors cannot be designed and operated without
knowledge of kinetics.
In the present edition, the empirical nature of kinetic studies is recognized; analyses
related to how experimental errors affect kinetic studies are performed and illustrated
with actual data. Particularly, analytical and numerical solutions are derived to rep-
resent the uncertainties of reactant conversions in distinct scenarios and are used to
analyze the quality of the obtained parameter estimates. Consequently, the present
edition includes new topics that focus on the development of analytical and numerical
procedures for more accurate description of experimental errors in reaction systems
and of estimates of kinetic parameters.
Finally, kinetics requires knowledge that must be complemented and tested in
the laboratory. Therefore, practical examples of reactions performed in bench and
semi-pilot scales are discussed in the final chapter.
We decided to organize this version of the book in two parts. In the first part, a
thorough discussion regarding reaction kinetics is presented. In the second part, basic
equations are derived and used to represent the performance of batch and continuous
ideal reactors, isothermal and non-isothermal reaction systems and homogeneous and
heterogeneous reactor vessels, as illustrated with several examples and exercises.
In closing, we would like to thank all of our undergraduate and graduate students
for giving us the opportunity to discuss the subjects presented in the present book and
to teach chemical kinetics in the classroom and in the lab. We also thank FAPERJ
(Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Apoio à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro),
UFRJ (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro) and Synergia Editora for supporting
the previous two editions of the book.

Definitions and stoichiometry
A chemical process involves not only chemical reactions but also involves surface
and mass/energy transport phenomena. The chemical reactions are defined by the
stoichiometry, in which reactants are directly related to the products of the reaction.
Therefore, once defined the stoichiometry, the measurement of the composition of
one of the components allows to relate it with the composition of other components.
However, the order to the reaction rate does not always follow the stoichiometry. In this
particular case, the kinetics of the reaction is not simply represented by a single step
but involves several intermediate steps. In order to differentiate them, the reactions are
divided as follows:
Irreversible reactions: those which are carried out in a single direction A + B →R + S.
Reversible reactions: those which are carried out in both directions (direct and reverse).
Elementary reactions: those which are carried out in a single step.
Non-elementary reactions: those which are carried out in several elementary steps,
and whose resultant reaction may not be elementary.
A + B →AB
elementary
AB →R
A + B →R
non-elementary
Simple reactions: those which are carried out in a simple step or not. If the reaction
order follows the stoichiometry, then the reaction is simple and elementary.
Complex reactions: those which correspond to several reactions carried out simulta-
neously, either in series or combined.

MEASUREMENT VARIABLES
The description of the reaction rate represents the variation of the consumption of
reactants or the formation of products as the reaction takes place. It can be graphically
represented by a kinetic curve. The tangent to this curve indicates how the reaction
rate as well as the consumption of reactants or formation of products varies as the
reaction takes place. The reaction rate is observed to be high in the beginning of the
reaction and gradually decreases as the reaction takes place, tending to zero when
the equilibrium is reached or when the reactants disappear completely.

Figure 1.1 Kinetic curves for batch and continuous systems.
The kinetic curve of a reaction can be monitored by measuring the concentration,
pressure, or other intensive variable, which is proportional to a characteristic property
of the reaction (e.g., conductivity, wavelength, and binding energy). For a defined
stoichiometric reaction, the variable of a component is followed with time or position
in the reactor, depending on the system where the reaction is run. The concentrations
of the other components can be calculated from this measured variable.
In a closed system, such as a batch reactor, the characteristic property varies with
the reaction time. In an open system (such as continuous reactor), it varies with position
or space time. In this case, the space time is defined as the ratio between the volume
or mass of the reactor system and the inlet mixture flow. The schematic representation
of the two systems is displayed in Figure 1.1.
The most important fact is that these are experimental measurements and depend
on the type of reactor and on the analysis of reactants and products. In a batch reactor,
several small samples are collected in different time intervals and the concentrations
of reactants and products are measured. On the other hand, in a continuous reactor,
the concentrations of reactants and products are measured along the reactor. The most
used techniques for analysis are:
Titration: the samples are titrated with a neutralizing agent and with a chemical indi-
cator. The titration is conducted with an acid or a base which indicates the extent
of the reaction. This analysis is simple, but subject to errors and inaccuracy and
therefore should be repeated several times.
Gas or liquid chromatography: a measurement which is performed by thermal con-
ductivity or by flame ionization. Each compound has its thermal or ionic properties

Chemical reaction engineering
defined, which are detected and measured in the chromatograph after separa-
tion in appropriate columns. The selection of the separation chromatographic
column depends on the components present. The conductivity and ionization are
proportional to their concentrations and hence they can be related to each other.
Spectroscopy: detection of components through the measurement of their wavelengths
in characteristic bands. The most frequently used instruments are infrared, ultravio-
let, diffuse reflectance, etc. These properties are proportional to the concentrations
of the components and may be related to their respective conversion factors.
Electrical conductivity: solutions containing H+ and OH−ions have electrical con-
ductivity. In this solution, the substitution of an ion by another with different
conductivities allows for determination of the reactant ion concentration.
Spectrophotometry: According to Beer’s law, the absorbance, which is proportional
to the concentration, is determined through spectrophotometry.
Dilatometry: in this technique, the mass variation is measured in a microbalance or
through the dilatation of a quartz spring and the weight change is monitored as a
function of the reaction time.
Total pressure: very simple method, in which the variation of the total pressure in a
gas system kept at constant volume is measured. The pressure is monitored through
a manometer.
1.2
CALCULATION OF MEASUREMENT VARIABLES
In general, it is recommended to determine a new variable which relates the concentra-
tions of the reactants and products. Thus, it is possible to calculate the concentration
of all components. We therefore define the extent of the reaction and the conversion
of a particular component. If the reaction in a closed or open system is reversible, then
the initial number of moles and the moles after a given time or position will be:
aA + bB ⇔rR + sS
(1.1)
Initial moles: nA0
nB0
nR0
nS0
Final moles: nA
nB
nR
nS
where n is the number of moles; the indexes 0 and i represent the initial and instanta-
neous (or local) conditions, respectively, with A and B corresponding to the reactants
and R and S corresponding to the products.
1.2.1
Extent of the reaction
α is defined as the extent of the reaction, indicating how much of reactant has been
transformed or how much of product has been formed. Therefore, it can be generally
represented by:
α = nA0 −nA
a
= nB0 −nB
b
= nR −nR0
r
= nS −nS0
s
(1.2)
where a, b, r, and s are the respective stoichiometric coefficients of the reaction.

Definitions and stoichiometry
7
Note that in this case the extent of the reaction is an extensive variable and is
measured in moles. If α is known, the instantaneous or local number of moles of each
component can be determined:
nA = nA0 −aα
nB = nB0 −bα
nR = nR0 + rα
nS = nS0 + sα
(1.3)
Example
The reaction: 4PH3 →P4 + 6H2
From 1 mole of phosphine, after a certain time, we can find:
nPH3 = 1 −α
nP4 = (1/4)α
nH2 = (6/4)α
When the reaction is performed in a constant volume system, the extent of the
reaction is directly determined as a function of the concentration, since:
C = n
V
moles
l

Therefore,
CA = CA0 −aα
CB = CB0 −bα
CR = CR0 + rα
CS = CS0 + sα
(1.4)
1.2.2
Conversion
The conversion is the most used variable. It is defined by the number of moles trans-
formed or formed at a given time or local in relation to the initial number of moles.
The conversion should always be defined for the limiting reactant of the reaction. The
conversion has no unit, ranging from 0 to 1 for irreversible reactions or from 0 to
XAe for reversible reactions. So, for irreversible reactions in which A is the limiting
component, we have:
XA = nA0 −nA
nA0
(1.5)

8
Chemical reaction engineering
For reversible reactions, we have:
XAe = nA0 −nAe
nA0
(1.6)
where nAe is the number of moles in the equilibrium, and thus XAe < 1.0.
In a constant volume system, the conversion can be expressed as a function of
concentration and thus,
XA = CA0 −CA
CA0
(1.7)
If the conversion and reaction stoichiometry are known, the number of moles or
the concentration of each component can be determined. Thus, in analogy to the extent
of the reaction, we have for a reaction of the type like:
aA + bB ⇔rR + sS
nA = nA0(1 −XA) →V = Const →CA = CA0(1 −XA)
nB = nB0 −(b/a)XA
CB = CB0 −(b/a)XA
nR = nR0 + (r/a)XA
CR = CR0 + (r/a)XA
nS = nS0 + (s/a)XA
CS = CS0 + (s/a)XA
(1.8)
Note that for a variable volume system, the total change in the number of moles
should be considered. Thus, for example, in a reaction of the type like A + 3B →2R,
the total number of moles of reactants and products are 4 and 2, respectively. Therefore,
there is a volume contraction. In this case, to express the concentrations in terms of
the conversion, it is necessary to take into account the volume change. Using the ideal
gas law, the total number of moles can be determined:
n = PV
RT
(1.9)
From the sum of the number of moles of each component, according to Equation
1.3, we can determine the total number of moles as a function of the extent of the
reaction (α):
n = n0 + (r + s −a −b)α
(1.10)
Considering that (r + s −a −b) = ν, it is possible to know whether there is vol-
ume contraction or expansion. Note that r, s, a, and b are the stoichiometric coefficients
of the products and reactants, respectively, and n0 = nA0 + nB0 + nR0 + nS0 is the total
number of initial moles. Thus,
n = n0 + ν · α
(1.11)

Definitions and stoichiometry
9
Substituting Equation 1.9 into Equation 1.11, we have:
PV
RT = P0V0
RT
+ ν · α
(1.12)
As a function of the conversion, replacing α by Equation 1.2 and rearranging, we
obtain:
ν · α = νnA0 −nA
a
· n0
n0
· nA0
nA0
ν · α = ν
a · XA · yA0 · n0
where XA is the conversion (Equation 1.5) and yA0 is the initial molar fraction of A.
The term
ν
a · yA0
is defined as the factor of contraction or expansion, known as εA. It indicates the
volume change in the reaction system.
Substituting να in Equation 1.12 and considering that
n0 = P0V0
RT ,
We obtain, for a system at constant pressure and temperature, the variation of the
system volume as a function of the conversion, i.e.,
V = V0(1 + εAXA) at P and T = constant
(1.13)
Therefore, the factor εA will be defined as the ratio between the total change of
the reaction volume and the initial volume. Thus,
εA = VXA=1 −VXA=0
VXA=0
(1.14)
If in gas-phase reactions εAis positive, there will be expansion, otherwise there
will be contraction. When εA is zero, no volume change will occur. In liquid-phase
reactions, εA = 0.
The volume change in nonisothermal conditions must be corrected for tem-
perature. For non-ideal conditions, the compressibility factor z is corrected. Thus,
Equation 1.13 becomes:
V = V0 (1 + εAXA) T
T0
z
z0
(1.15)
Note that the volume varies with the conversion of the limiting reactant A but
may also vary with any other component. Only under equimolar conditions, we have

10
Chemical reaction engineering
that εA = εB. However, for any other condition, they are different. For the same total
volume, it is known that:
V = V0(1 + εAXA) = V0(1 + εBXB)
Thus,
εAXA = εBXB

1.3
CONTINUOUS SYSTEMS
Most of the reactions are carried out in continuous systems, for which other variable
is used. In particular, we used the molar flow F (moles/time) in an open system:
Products
Reactor
The local molar flow in relation to component A is defined as FA = CAv (moles/h),
where v is the volumetric flow rate (L/h). The molar inflow rate will be FA0 = CA0v0. For
any other component, reactant, or product, we analogously obtain FB, FR. However,
note that the local volumetric flow for a variable volume system is not constant and
varies with the factor of contraction or expansion. In this case, for a system at constant

Definitions and stoichiometry
11
pressure and temperature, we have an expression analogous to Equation 1.14 for the
volumetric flow, i.e.,
v = v0(1 + εAXA)
(1.17)
Therefore, considering that the local concentration varies with εA, since, we have:
FA = nA
V · v = nA0(1 −XA)
v0(1 + εAXA) · v0(1 + εAXA) = FA0(1 −XA)
where FA0 = CA0v0.
Therefore, for a system at variable (εA) or constant volume (εA = 0), we have the
general definition:
FA = FA0(1 −XA).
(1.18)
The conversion can therefore be defined as a function of the molar flow, i.e.,
XA = FA0 −FA
FA0
(1.19)
This is similar to the definition given by Equation 1.5.
Therefore, for the extent of the reaction, we have an analogous relation to
Equation 1.2:
α = FA0 −FA
a
= FB0 −FB
b
= FR −FR0
r
(1.20)
The molar flows of the other components can be determined as a function of the
conversion. We then obtain the following relations, which are valid for the reactions
at variable or constant volume:
FA = FA0(1 −XA)
FB = FB0 −(b/a)FA0XA
FR = FR0 + (r/a)FA0XA
(1.21)
1.4
PARTIAL PRESSURES
From the gas law, it is known that the partial pressure is a function of the total pressure,
pA = yAP.
Therefore, if the molar fractions of an open or closed system are known, the
partial pressures of each component can be determined. Considering again the chemical
reaction:
aA + bB →rR

12
Chemical reaction engineering
The balance of the number of moles will be:
Initial moles:
nA0 nB0 nR0
n0 (initial total)
Moles at any t:
nA nB nR
n = n0 + να
Reacted moles:
nA0 −aα nB0 −(b/a)α nR0 + (r/a)α
We have the molar fractions:
yi ⇒nA0 −aα
n0 + ν · α
nB0 −(b/a)α
n0 + ν · α
nR0 + (r/a)α
n0 + ν · α
(1.22)
We can also determine the molar fractions as a function of the conversion by using
Equation 1.2, and the molar flow, knowing that:
α
nA0
= nA0 −nA
a · nA0
= XA
a
(1.23)
or
α
FA0
= FA0 −FA
a · FA0

a
(1.24)
Consequently, the partial pressures of each component can be calculated.
1.5
METHOD OF TOTAL PRESSURE
In a gas-phase system at constant volume, the reaction is monitored through the for-
mation of products and change of total pressure. The pressure is a direct measure in a
closed system. If the partial molar fractions are known, the partial pressure can also be
determined as a function of the total pressure. For a gas-phase reaction of the type like:
aA + bB →rR
The partial pressure of A will be:
pA = yAP
From the ideal gas law,
pA = nA
V RT = nA0 −aα
V

Using Equation 1.1 and substituting α ⇒n = n0 + να and knowing that pA0 =nAo

the partial pressure of A can be calculated:

Definitions and stoichiometry
13
Since the total initial pressure and pressure at time t are P0 and P, respectively, we
have:
pA = pA0 −a
ν(P −P0)
(1.25)
Regarding the product, only the sign is changed from (−) to (+), i.e.,
pR = pR0 + r
ν(P −P0)
(1.26)
1.6
GENERAL PROPERTIES
As seen, the reactants have specific properties, such as conductivity, wavelength,
binding energy, resistivity, polarized light, and others. These properties are directly
measured by chromatography, spectroscopy, and other methods and must be related
with the usual measure, concentrations, or conversion.
Consider again a generic reaction of the type:
aA + bB →rR
and, considering GI as a characteristic property of each component. Thus,
G = GAnA + GBnB + GRnR
(1.27)
But considering the number of moles as a function of the extent of the reaction
(Equation 1.3), we have:
G = GA(nA0 −aα) + GB(nB0 −(b/a)α) + GR(nR0 + (r/a)α)
We have:
G = G0 + Gα
(1.28)
Considering that:
G0 = GA0nA0 + GB0nB0 + GR0nR0
and
G = GR(r/a) −[GAa + GB(b/a)]
In a reversible reaction in equilibrium, we have that α = αe and, thus, G = Ge. So,
by replacing this term into Equation 1.28, we obtain G:
G = Ge −G0
αe

14
Chemical reaction engineering
By replacing G in Equation 1.28, we determine α as a function of the property
G, as follows:
α
αe
= G −G0
Ge −G0
(1.29)
or as a function of the conversion:
XA
XAe
= G −G0
Ge −G0
(1.30)
If the reaction is irreversible and the property is related to the reactant, it is known
that XAe = 1 and Ge = G∞= 0. Therefore, for irreversible reactions, we simplify to
get:
XA = G0 −G
G0
(1.31)
or Ge = G∞and G0 = 0 when it is related to the product:
XA = G
G∞
(1.32)

SOLVED PROBLEMS
E1.1 A reaction of the type A →nR is carried out in gas phase. The reactant A is
introduced with an inert I in a batch reactor at constant volume. The initial pressures
of the reactant and inert are 7.5 and 1.5 mmHg, respectively.
The reaction is irreversible and the total pressure reaches 31.5 mm Hg after a long
time.
(a)
Determine the stoichiometry n and calculate the conversion after 20 min of
reaction, knowing that the pressure was 19 mmHg.
(b)
What would be the final volume considering that we have plug-flow reactor at
constant pressure (equal to the initial pressure) and the reactor reached the same
conversion of the previous system? It is known that the initial volume is 0.5 L.
Solution
(a)
For a system at constant volume, the partial pressure of the reactant can be
calculated as a function of the total pressure P by means of Equation 1.25:
pA = pA0 −a
ν(P −P0)
(1.33)
The initial pressure is P0 = pA0 + pI = 9 mmHg.

Definitions and stoichiometry
15
When the time is long enough, all the reactant is converted. The initial pres-
sure of the reactant A is zero when the final pressure of the system is equal to
31.5 mmHg. Therefore,
0 = 7.5 −1
ν(31.5 −9)
thus,
ν = 3 and n = 4
(1.34)
Therefore,
A →4R
(1.35)
Considering that both the volume and temperature are constant
pA = CART,
thus, from Equation 1.7, we obtain:
XA = CA0 −CA
CA0
= pA0 −pA
pA0
(1.36)
Substituting pA from Equation 1.33,
XA = 1
3
P −P0
pA0
(1.37)
Substituting the values of P0 and P after 20 min, we obtain:
XA = 0.44
(1.38)
(b)
Considering P = 9 mmHg and the conversion XA = 0.44, the volume change can
be calculated according to Equation 1.13,
V = V0(1 + εAXA)
(1.39)
therefore,
V = V −V0 = V0εAXA
(1.40)
The molar fractions can be calculated:
PA = yAP ⇒yA = 0.83
⇒yI = 0.16
Thus, the value of εA can be calculated since,
A →4R

V = 1.05 L
E1.2 A gas-phase reaction of the type like 2A + 4B →2R is conducted in a continuous
system at a constant pressure of 10 atm and temperature of 727◦C. The reactants
are introduced with equal initial concentrations and volumetric flow of 2.5 L/min.
Calculate the molar flow of each component when the conversion reaches 25%.
P = 10 atm, T = 727°C
X = 0.25
v0 = 2.5 L/min
Solution
Calculation of the initial concentration: for R = 0.082, P = 10 atm and T = 1.000 K
CA = pA0/RT = yA0P/RT = 0.0609 moles/L
CB = pB0/RT = yB0P/RT = 0.0609 moles/L
And considering that, yA0 = yB0 = 0.5,
since the initial concentrations of the reactants are equal.
The reactant B is the limiting reactant and, therefore, we need to calculate XB.
The initial molar flows are:
FA0 = CA0v0 = FB0 = CB0v0 = 0.0609 × 2.5 = 0.152 moles/min
The molar flows of the other components are calculated according to the following
equations:
FB = FB0(1 −XB) = 0.114 moles/min.
FA = FA0 −FB0(b/a)XB = FB0(1 −X B/2) = 0.133 moles/min.
FR = FR0 + FB0(r/a)XB = FB0(0 + X B/2) = 0.019 moles/min.

ACCURACY AND PRECISION
An important point everyone involved with measurements must consider is that mea-
surements are subject to errors and disturbances. This is particularly important in the
field of reaction kinetics, given the empirical nature of activities performed in this field.
For the sake of clarity, ‘empirical’ is used here to emphasize that the kinetic behavior
of chemical systems cannot be unveiled without the support of experiments and mea-
surements. As a matter of fact, kinetic behavior of real chemical systems is normally
observed first through experimentation, followed by the proposal of reaction mech-
anisms and afterwards by the development of kinetic rate expressions, such as those
the reader will see in the following chapters. Although it may be true that the current
development of theoretical chemistry and simulation tools allow the analysis of cer-
tain relatively simple chemical systems a priori, in fact the field of chemical kinetics
cannot dispense with the use of experiments for understanding real chemical reaction
systems yet.
Many various factors can disturb the measurements used to characterize the
behavior of an experimental system. For instance, all measuring devices possess finite

18
Chemical reaction engineering
capacity for describing the measured variable. For example, the ordinary ruler most
students use can measure the length of objects in millimeters but is unable to determine
any fraction of length smaller than one millimeter. Indeed, regardless of the measure-
ment being analyzed, the real property of the measured entity can never be known,
with its infinite number of decimal places. Besides, it is often necessary to infer the
value of a certain variable based on another variable’s available measurements. For
example, temperature measurements made with a mercury thermometer rely on the
variation of the mercury volume, as measured in a graduated cylinder. Since the volume
of mercury changes with temperature, its measured volume can be related to system
temperature. So a function that relates volume to temperature must be built, named
as the calibration model. However, this leads to the problem of determining the best
calibration model and guaranteeing that it be valid in all conditions of interest. These
facts introduce additional uncertainties to the measurement process and measured val-
ues, since calibration models are not perfect and can perform differently depending
on experimental conditions. Additionally, measuring systems combine equipment and
experimental procedure and are, therefore, subject to failure. For example, a plastic
ruler can deform when it is poorly packed in students’ backpacks, introducing addi-
tional inaccuracies in the measurement process. Similarly, the existence of a bad electric
contact in an electrical circuit can generate noise and deviations in the measurements
provided by a piece of equipment. The significant problem is that such deviations and
deformations are not always noticed by the experimenter. Finally, the analyst usually
does not know all the variables that describe a given problem, so fluctuations can be
expected due to the unknown variations of all the uncontrolled variables that affect
a certain measurement. For example, due to thermal expansion, the millimeter of the
above mentioned ordinary ruler changes with temperature.
As a consequence of the previously discussed facts (and many more!), some degree
of uncertainty always exists in all real measurements, so it is not possible to guarantee
with absolute certainty what the value of a real variable is. In addition, measurements
performed with different devices and by different analysts can lead to different values
for the same measured variable. Obviously, some systems are more liable to process
disturbances than others. For instance, it is easier and simpler to measure the length
of a sheet of paper than to measure the velocity of a seagull that flies in the sky.
Hence, it is necessary to introduce some concepts related to the quality of the available
measurements.
First of all, let us introduce the concept of accuracy, which is usually related to
the ideas of correctness and exactness. The accuracy of a measurement is related to its
distance from the true (usually unknown) value. The more accurate a measurement,
the closer it will be to the unknown value. It is difficult to characterize the accuracy
of a measurement because to do so requires knowledge of its true value, which is
unknown in a real experiment – otherwise, measuring would not be necessary! For
this reason, accuracy is usually associated with the instrument or procedure used to
make the measurements. In this case, a standard (or entity with known properties) can
be used to evaluate the accuracy of the measuring system. Standards can be obtained
from respectable organizations and providers (for example, mass standards) or can
be prepared by the analyst (for example, by mixing known quantities of pure com-
ponents). In order to guarantee the accuracy of obtained measurements, companies
and laboratories are obliged to comply with standardized procedures that establish the
periodic evaluation of standard properties (often a blank or reference experiment) with

Definitions and stoichiometry
19
available measuring systems; whenever unacceptable deviations from reference values
are detected, the available measuring system must be replaced or sent to maintenance.
Now, let us introduce the concept of precision, which is usually related to the
ideas of reproducibility and variability. The precision of a measurement is related to
its distance from other measurements performed for the same entity and using the
same experimental procedures. The more precise a measurement, the closer it will be
to previously measured values. Therefore, while accuracy is a concept that can be used
to characterize a single value, precision is a concept that necessarily involves a set of
multiple measurements. As with accuracy, to guarantee good precision of obtained
measurements, companies and laboratories are obliged to comply with standardized
procedures that establish the periodic evaluation of standard properties (often a blank
or reference experiment) with available measuring systems; whenever unacceptable
deviations among the obtained values are detected, the available measuring system
must be replaced or sent to maintenance.
Figure 1.2 explains graphically the meanings of accuracy and precision, where one
can see that the two concepts are independent from each other, although in the ideal
experimental scenario measurements must be simultaneously accurate and precise.
Despite that, one should see that precision imposes a limit on accuracy, as the accuracy
of available measurements cannot be better than the precision of these very same
measurements (this is apparent when one of the experimental values is replaced by the
standard value). For this reason, the two are often confused, which can be dangerous,
as precise measurements can be quite inaccurate.
As discussed in the following sections, both the accuracy and the precision of
experimental measurements used to carry out quantitative evaluations of system per-
formances affect the quality of the proposed analyses. For this reason, accuracy and
precision of experimental data must be carefully characterized by the analyst, as
described throughout this book.

MEASUREMENT ERRORS AND PRECISION
As variable measurements are contaminated by disturbances, as described in Section
1.8, it becomes necessary to evaluate simultaneously the variables that affect a prob-
lem and the precision and accuracy of the measured values. In order to convey the
importance of this point, Figure 1.3 illustrates graphically the effect of measurement
variability on the information content of experimental data. As one can observe in
Figure 1.3, as the variability increases it becomes more difficult to observe the under-
lying linear relationship between variables X and Y; therefore, the occurrence of
measurement disturbances leads to deterioration of the information content of avail-
able data, which is why measurement variability must be properly characterized by
the investigator.
In order to characterize the precision of actual experimental measurements, the
best strategy consists in replicating the experiment as many times as possible (Schwaab
and Pinto, 2007). Assuming that a sufficiently large number of experimental measure-
ments are available through replication (x1, x2, …, xN) the most popular quantitative
characterization of precision is the sample variance s2
X, defined as:
s2
X =
N
i=1

xi −X
2
N −1
(1.9.1)
where X is the sample average, defined as:
X =
N
i=1xi
N
(1.9.2)
and N is the number of replicates.
Some questions related to the calculation of s2
Xmust be considered at this time. First
of all, the term ‘replication’ here refers to repetition of the whole experimental proce-
dure being analyzed. For instance, if an experiment involves many steps (such as the
manufacture of a catalyst; the preparation of a reactor bed; the conduction of the exper-
iment through manipulation of pressures, temperatures and flowrates; the withdrawal
of samples; and the characterization of samples with the appropriate experimental
technique), then replication requires the repetition of the entire experimental proce-
dure. The reader must observe that the withdrawal of N samples and analysis of the N
resulting measurements cannot evaluate the precision of the whole experimental pro-
cedure, but only of the combined sampling and characterization techniques. If process
variability is concentrated in one step, such as the catalyst manufacture process step
(which it frequently is!), replication imposes the preparation of distinct catalyst loads
and the use of different catalyst samples for conducting of the experiments; otherwise,
the analyst will underestimate the level of uncertainty of the available experimental
values and overestimate the information content of the data
The second point regards the random nature of both s2
X and X As experimental
measurements are uncertain to some extent due to the measurement disturbances,
both s2
X and X are also contaminated by these disturbances, as they are calculated

with uncertain measurements. In other words, if N new experiments are performed,
both s2
X and X change. Example E1.4 illustrates this particular point.
Example
E1.4 The function random of the Excel spreadsheet provides random numbers uni-
formly distributed in the interval [0,1]. This function is used here to simulate the
disturbances that affect a measurement. In order to do that, numbers were generated
in the form:
xi = 0.5 + 0.2 ∗(random −0.5)
(1.9.3)
so that measured values fall in the interval [0.4, 0.6]. Ten sequences of N = 10 values
were then generated and used for calculation of s2
X and X, as shown in Table E1.4.
One can see in Table E1.4 that both s2
X and X were different in the distinct sequences,
illustrating the random nature of these variables.

The third point regards the levels of uncertainty of the calculated s2
X and X values,
as these variables are subject to unknown disturbances. In order to solve this problem
rigorously, it is necessary to know exactly how disturbances affect the measured values,
which is usually impossible, as this would require the execution of infinitely many (or
a sufficiently high number of) experiments or the derivation of a theoretical expression
that links measurements and possible disturbances, which is rare. For this reason, the
commonest approach makes use of the gaussian assumption, which allows the devel-
opment of analytical solutions for the proposed problem (Schwaab and Pinto, 2007).
According to the gaussian approach, it is assumed that the probability of observing a
value of x in the interval [x1x2] P(x1 ≤x ≤x2), follows the function:
P (x1 ≤x ≤x2) =
x2

where µx is the unknown mean value (or unknown true value) of the variable x,
around which the measured values fluctuate, and σ2
x is the unknown variance of the
fluctuations. If s2
X and X were determined with perfect accuracy, they would be equal
to σ2
X and µ. The difference ε, given by:
ε = x −µx
(1.9.6)
is a measure of the experimental disturbance. In this case, the uncertainties can be
described in the form (Schwaab and Pinto, 2007):

where X is the uncertainty of the calculated sample average; x is the uncertainty of
individual measurements; s2
x,min and s2
x,max are the limits of the confidence interval of s2
x;
and t, χ2
max, χ2
min and c are reference numbers that depend on the number of samples N
and on the confidence level. In short, the confidence level describes the fraction of times
that the disturbances will fall inside the confidence interval. When one says that the
confidence level is equal to 95%, one simultaneously says that accepts to be mistaken
one time out of 20. As the gaussian reference is defined in the infinite real interval, the
only possibility to be correct 100% of the times is to admit that disturbances can be
infinitely large, which is useless for practical use.
t values in Equation (1.9.7) can be obtained with help of the Student’s
t-distribution. Table 1.9.1 presents t values for different sample sizes and degrees
of confidence. Values of χ2
min and χ2
min in Equation (1.9.8) can be obtained with help
of the χ2 distribution. Tables 1.9.2 and 1.9.3 present values of χ2
min and χ2
min for dif-
ferent sample sizes and degrees of confidence. c values in Equation (1.9.9) can also
be obtained with help of the Student’s t distribution of Table 1.9.1, by assuming that
c values are approximately equal to t values in most practical situations. Example 2
presents an illustrative explanation about the use of Equations (1.9.7–9) and Tables
1.9.1–3 for characterization of confidence intervals.

E1.9.2 It is assumed that triplicate experiments were carried out to characterize the
activity of a certain catalyst, leading to the following conversion values of the main
reactant: x1 = 0.90, x2 = 0.95 and x3 = 0.98. In this case:

Therefore, the calculated values are:
0.73 < x1 = 0.90 < 1.07
0.78 < x2 = 0.95 < 1.12
0.81 < x3 = 0.98 < 1.15
0.84 < X = 0.94 < 1.04
4.33 × 10−3 < s2
x = 1.63x10−3 < 64.51 × 10−3
As one can see, the confidence intervals can be too large (and precision too low) when
only few samples are available. Besides, one can also see that the gaussian approach fre-
quently leads to calculation of unfeasible confidence intervals (for instance, conversions
cannot be larger than 1).
The gaussian distribution frequently leads to calculation of highly imprecise confi-
dence intervals, particularly when the number of samples is small, as shown in Example
1.9.2. This happens for many reasons, including: (i) the actual disturbances do not
necessarily follow the gaussian distribution of Equations (1.9.4–5); (ii) the gaussian
distribution is symmetrical and actual phenomena can present skewed behavior, with
unequal numbers of positive and negative deviations; and (iii) the gaussian distribution
is defined in the infinite real interval, while real measurements are normally constrained
within well-defined limits (for instance, conversions must fall within the [0,1] interval).
Consequently, one might wonder why one should use the gaussian approach for cal-
culation of confidence intervals and experimental precision; possible answers are: (i)
the behavior of actual disturbances is usually unknown; (ii) the gaussian distribution
allows the analytical computation of confidence intervals; (iii) the gaussian distribu-
tion is simple and depends on only two parameters, σ2
x and µx; (iv) the very important
central limit theorem states the sum of infinitely many disturbances leads to a signal
that follows the gaussian distribution (in other words, if a measurement is subject to
an infinite number of individual disturbances, the effective resulting disturbance will
follow the gaussian distribution).
Based on the previous paragraphs and on Example 1.9.2, it is possible to conclude
that the gaussian distribution should not be regarded as the formal theoretical descrip-
tion of the experimental variability problem, but as an approximation of experimental
fluctuations that can be useful for characterization of the experimental precision, par-
ticularly when the number of samples is large. For this reason, there are reasons for
more involving and precise characterization of experimental errors in reaction kinetic
problems, as described by Pacheco et al. (2018). The interested reader is encouraged
to download and read the proposed manuscript.
Finally, it is important to emphasize that it is very difficult to evaluate the accuracy
of a measurement, as the true value is normally unknown (with exception of stan-
dards used for evaluation of instruments and measuring procedures). For this reason,
Equations (1.9.7) and (1.9.9) can be regarded as inferior limits for the accuracy of
sample averages and individual measurements, respectively. Therefore, if the differ-
ence observed between the reference standardized value and the sample average falls

26
Chemical reaction engineering
within the confidence interval defined by Equation (1.9.7), the sample average can be
regarded as accurate. Similarly, if the difference observed between the reference stan-
dardized value and the individual measurements fall within the confidence interval
defined by Equation (1.9.9), the individual measurements can be regarded as accurate.
On the other hand, if Equations (1.9.7) and (1.9.9) are not satisfied by the differences
observed between the reference value and the analyzed experimental measurement, the
measurement is assumed to be biased and corrective actions should be considered by
the analyst to enhance the performance of the measuring system.

Chapter 2
Chemical equilibrium
For choosing the conditions of a chemical process, we should know the thermody-
namic properties and particularly the conditions of the chemical equilibrium. Before
determining the reaction kinetics, it is necessary to verify if the reaction is thermody-
namically possible. The pressure and temperature conditions are important to calculate
the conversion of a reversible or irreversible reaction. For reversible reactions, we need
to determine the chemical equilibrium constant, which is temperature dependent. With
this constant, it is possible to predict what is the maximum equilibrium conversion
of a reversible reaction. Therefore, the reversibility of the reaction imposes serious
limitations.
By means of thermodynamics, it is possible to predict whether a chemical reaction
occurs and determine its composition. The thermodynamic equilibrium conversion
represents the maximum conversion that can be achieved, regardless of the catalyst
and reaction rates. However, the rates and conversions depend only on temperature,
pressure, and inflow composition.
When a reaction occurs at constant temperature and pressure, it proceeds spon-
taneously varying in the direction of the increase in entropy. Once the equilibrium is
reached, this entropy does not increase further. Consequently, from the first law of
thermodynamics, the total change of the free energy of the system is always negative
for any spontaneous reaction and zero at the equilibrium.
In a reaction of the following type:
aA + bB ⇔rR + sS
The variation of free energy with temperature and pressure for an open system
will be:
dG = −S dT + V dP +

µj dnj
(2.1)
where µj is the chemical potential j and nj is the number of moles of the component.
At constant temperature and pressure, we have:
dG = 0
Therefore:

µj dnj = 0
(2.2)

The chemical potential for ideal gases expressed as a function of the partial pressure
is defined by:

If the entropy of the system is known, we can determine the equilibrium constant

the equilibrium constant with temperature can also be determined by differentiating

(2.12)
For reversible reactions, an increase or decrease in temperature tends to directly
influence the equilibrium constant, but depends on whether the reaction is exothermic
or endothermic. When the reaction is exothermic (H0 < 0), an increase in tempera-
ture favours the reverse reaction, since K << 1. For endothermic reactions, the opposite
is valid.
The enthalpy of the reaction varies with temperature and depends on the spe-
cific heat of each component. For ideal gases, the specific heat varies according to a
polynomial function, namely:
cpj = αj + βjT + γjT2
(2.13)
where αj, βj, and γj, are constants of each gas component under ideal conditions.
The enthalpy of each component varying with the temperature will be:

In order to obtain the values of the conversion and the composition of species j

In the thermodynamic study of the reaction, one can also use the HYSYS ® soft-
ware version 3.1, particularly the Gibbs reactor module, with the thermodynamic
package Peng–Robinson and the method of minimization of the Gibbs free energy (G)
of the system, given by the following equation:
G =

where nj is the number of species and Gj is the partial molar Gibbs energy of the species
j, which is dependent on temperature, pressure, and composition. The mass balance
for the species j is represented by Equation 2.17, in which k symbolizes the elements
(H, O, C), nj is the number of molecules of the species j present in the system, ajk is the
number of atoms of the element k present in the molecule of the species j, and, finally,
Ak is the total numbers of atoms of the element k:

Solution
Since the solution is diluted with excess of water, we can assume a direct first order
reversible reaction, i.e.:
By making CH3–CH2–CH2–COOH = A

we have:

CAe = 0.049 mol/L

E2.3 To exemplify the use of the software HYSYS®, we will do the analysis for the
partial oxidation of methane, which generates the following main products: CH4, O2,
CO2, H2O, CO, and H2. This reaction is conducted at atmospheric pressure, since

Chemical equilibrium
33
for higher values of temperature, the conversion of CH4 and selectivity to CO and H2
decrease, as suggested by York et al. (2003). Moreover, higher hydrocarbons such as
ethane, ethylene, and others were not taken into account because their concentrations
are very low in the wide temperature range studied (200–1000◦C).
Different gas compositions in the inflow were evaluated and the results for the con-
version of CH4 as a function of the temperature are shown in Figure E2.2. Between
500◦C and 700◦C, there is a considerable increase in the conversion of CH4. At tem-
peratures higher than 800◦C, more than 90% of conversion is reached. If an inert gas
(e.g., He) is assumed as the diluent of the system in a CH4/O2/He ratio of 2/1/8, the
conversion of CH4 increases in the temperature range of 400 to −800◦C in comparison
to the CH4/O2 system without inert gas.
For ideal gases, the presence of any inert does not affect the thermodynamic equi-
librium. However, for situations involving real gases, investigations concerning the
effects of variations in pressure and temperature revealed that the disturbance results
are not predicted by the expression of ideal gases and by the Le Chatelier’s principle.
When taking into account the deviations from ideality in real systems, in which inert
gases are present, the equilibrium is affected, although the changes become significant
only at moderate pressures. Whether the equilibrium is shifted in the direction of the
products or reactants depends on the system constituents and the inert gas present
(e.g., He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe).

indicates that the reaction most likely to occur is the highly exothermic total oxida-
tion of methane. However, other substoichiometric oxidation reactions can occur.
It is also important to note that the mole fraction of O2 is zero throughout the
temperature range studied, since the conversion of this reactant in the equilibrium
is 100%.

REACTION RATES—DEFINITIONS
When a mass or energy balance is carried out for a chemical reactor, one must consider
the chemical reaction in which the reactants are transformed into products. These
transformations are represented by the reaction rates.
In an open system, a molar balance is carried out for all the components of a
chemical reaction of the type A + B ⇔R + S. Generically, we can represent the system
as follows:
Open
system
(reactor)
Molar flow of 
reactants A and 
B that enters V
Fj (moles/h )
Fj (moles/h )
Molar flow of formed 
products R, S, or not 
consumed reactants that 
leaves V
Moles of reactant that were transformed
into products:
Rate of transformation or formation of
product: rj (moles/h.vol.) 
Variation in time of the
number of moles of the
component in the system
Different from other
systems, it only exists when 
a reaction take place
A + B  
R + S
The reaction rate is defined as the rate of formation of product or disappearance of
reactant per unit of volume and represents the variation of the number of moles formed
or disappeared per unit of time and volume, respectively. The rate of formation of any
component j is represented by rj and the rate of disappearance of the component A is
represented by (−rA).

38
Chemical reaction engineering
Since the rates of formation or disappearance are intensive properties, it is conve-
nient to relate them to a reference system. In a homogeneous phase system, the unit of
volume (mol/L h) is used as reference. On the other hand, in heterogeneous systems,
we used as reference the superficial or interfacial area (mol/m2 h).
Homogeneous systems:
rj = rate of formation of component j/unit of volume (mol/L h)
Heterogeneous systems:
rj = rate of formation of component j/unit area (moles/m2h)
1
Reactions in homogeneous phase
The homogeneous reactions are very common in liquid and gas phases. For
example, Gas phase—Cracking of ethane to obtain ethylene and hydrogen:
C2H6 →C2H4 + H2
2
Heterophase reactions
Several reactions are carried out in heterogeneous phase:
Gas/solid (fixed or fluidized bed).
Gas/liquid (fluid bed).
Liquid/liquid (fluid bed).
Gas/liquid/solid (three-phase slurry bed).
The oxidation of ethylene is conducted in gas phase with the presence of a catalyst.
Therefore, it is a heterophase reaction.
Examples
1.
Ethylene oxidation
C2H4 + 1/2O2 →C2H4O
C2H4 + 3O2 →CO2 + H2O
2.
Coal gasification
The solid–gas reactions occur when a solid reacts in the presence of a gas, such
as coal gasification:
C + H2O →CO + H2
3.
Hydrogenation of oils
The reactions in gas–solid–liquid phase can be represented by the hydrogena-
tion of oil, in which small particles of Raney–Nickel are used as a catalyst and
hydrogen is bubbled:
Soy oil (HCunsaturated) + H2
Ni Raney

Figure 3.1 Homogeneous and heterogeneous models.
Reactions in homogeneous and heterogeneous phase are schematically shown in
Figure 3.1.
Several times, it is difficult to know the interface area due to the presence of pores
and irregularity of the external contour or modification of the interface, as in the case
of a bubble through a liquid. Thus, in the case of solids, particularly catalysts, the
mass of the solid is used as reference and consequently the rate is expressed as:
r′′
j = rate of formation of component j/unit of mass (mol/g h)
The defined rates are intrinsic properties which depend on concentration, temper-
ature, and pressure of the system. In a batch reactor, the concentration varies with the
reaction time, and, in an open system, the concentration varies with the position.
A positive sign is conventionally used when the rate is related to the formation of
products. When the rate is referred to the disappearance of a reactant, a negative sign
is used.
In a system at constant volume, the rates can be expressed in terms of concentra-
tions. In an open system, the rate depends on the variation of moles or on the molar
flow Fj per volume, area, or mass. In general, we have:
rj = f (Fj)/V(mol/(L h))
where f (Fj) represents the flow of reactants and/or products in any position and V is
the reaction volume.

40
Chemical reaction engineering
Note that this is the reaction rate or activity. However, this definition takes into
account the reaction medium, be it volume, surface, or interface, and not exactly the
active sites. Not all mass or surface is active, but part of its outer surface has active
sites, which are truly the sites where the chemical reaction occurs. Therefore, rj in fact
represents the apparent rate. An important example of reaction that allows to differ-
entiate the apparent from the true rate is the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide to
form methane, which is conducted with different catalysts. With iron and cobalt cata-
lysts, the rate per unit of mass of catalyst, used as reference, has shown controversial
values. The activity of the catalysts in the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis to form hydro-
carbons would decrease according to the order Fe > Co > Ni. However, when the rate
per active site was defined, the order of activity was different, i.e., Co > Fe > Ni. This
controversy was resolved by Boudart, who defined the intrinsic activity, i.e., the rate
per active site. To make it more clear, the turnover frequency (TOF) was defined. Thus,
the intrinsic activity is determined, knowing the active sites, i.e.:
TOF = Rate of formation of componet j/active site.
TOF = FjNA
Si
(s−1)
where Fj = molar flow (mol/s) NA = Avogadro’s number = 6.023 × 1023 molecules
Si = active site = [L] × [S] [L] = atoms density—(atoms/m2) [S] = superficial area (m2).
This measurement gives us an idea of how many cycles a molecule reaches the
surface and reacts to form the product or how many cycles per second the molecule
collides with the active sites and reacts. In fact, not all molecules that collide with the
active sites react. Some of them only collide but return without reacting. However,
when they have enough energy to react, part of these molecules which collide with the
surface reacts and are transformed into products, according to the theory of collisions.
In this case, active sites are understood as the surface which presents sites with
specific characteristics. Thus, in a platinum supported catalyst, it is assumed that the
outer surface has a collection of atoms, representing the density of the platinum atoms,
i.e., the number of atoms that occupy an area of 1 m2. Many solids have different types
of sites, such as the acid sites in the surface of zeolites. For more complex systems such
as liquid–gas and gas–liquid–solid interface, the rates per unit of surface or mass are
conventionally used.
The difference between the two definitions is that the rates vary with time or
position, while the TOF only depends on the availability of the sites present. The
activity of the catalysts and the selectivity of the reaction depend on the characteristics
of the material. Some important features of these reactions should be remembered. The
first one is related to the sensitivity of the chemical reaction to the catalyst structure.
According to Boudart’s theory, the supported catalysts consist of metal particles of
different and variable sizes. With the increase of particle diameter, the concentrations of
metal atoms and exposed sites vary significantly, indicating that no changes in surface
structure have happened. The structure sensitive reactions (SSR) are those in which the
intrinsic reaction rate relative to the number of surface active sites, i.e., the frequency of
the reaction varies with the particle sizes, which does not happen in structure insensitive
reactions (SIR). This means that in the structure sensitive reactions, the frequency of

the reaction significantly depends on particle size, dispersion of the metals, or structure
of the catalyst active sites. On the other hand, in structure insensitive reactions , the
activity is independent of these parameters, according to Figure 3.2.
In the dehydrogenation, the activity of the catalyst, TOF, is independent of the
particle size of the metal or the catalyst used. Therefore, the reaction is insensitive to
the structure.
In hydrogenations or hydrogenolysis, the intrinsic activity (TOF) depends on the
structure. It depends on the particles size and the surface structure of the catalyst. The
rate is not proportional to the type of surface site.
The intrinsic activity therefore depends on the type of site and the nature of the
external surface. Generally, Figure 3.2 shows this behavior.
3.2
REACTION RATE
The reaction rate depends on concentration, pressure, and temperature of the reactants
and products of the reaction. It is an intensive property because it has specific units
and applies for any closed or open system. Since the concentration varies with time in
a batch system or with position in a continuous system, the reaction rate also depends
on these variables. This rate decreases with time or position, and tends to zero when all
the reactant is consumed or in the equilibrium. The rate of the reaction is defined as a
function of a component, and for a reversible reaction of the type aA + bB ⇔rR + sS,
the resulting reaction rate is expressed as follows:
r = kCa′
ACb′
B −k′Cr′
RCs′
S
(3.1)

42
Chemical reaction engineering
where the first term on the right-hand side represents the direct rate of transformation
of the reactants and the second term corresponds to the reverse rate of decomposition
of the product in a reversible reaction.
Note that the direct rate is proportional to the concentration of the reactants, and
the factor of proportionality is the rate constant of the direct reaction k. Analogously,
we define the rate constant of the reverse reaction as k′.
The exponents of the concentrations a′, b′, r′, and s′ represent the orders of the reac-
tion in relation to the respective components and are different from the stoichiometric
coefficients of the reaction. They coincide if the reaction is elementary.
Summarizing:
k, k′ ⇒specific rate constants of the direct and reverse reactions.
a′, b′ ⇒Reaction order in relation to the reactants A e B.
r′, s′ ⇒Reaction order in relation to the products R e S.
If a = a′, b = b′, r = r′, s = s′ ⇒it is an elementary reaction
(3.2)
The specific rates have units and depend on the order of the reaction. When the
order of the reaction is integer, we have some particular cases:
•
Zero order ⇒r = kC0
AC0
B ⇒k(mol/L h)
•
First order ⇒r = kCA ⇒k(h−1)
•
Second order ⇒r = kC2
A ⇒k(L/mol h)
Or ⇒r = kCACB ⇒k(L/mol h)
•
Third order ⇒r = kC3
A ⇒k(L/mol)2 h−1
If we have a fractional order reaction, the units of k and k′ have the corresponding
units.
At the equilibrium, the resulting rate of a reversible reaction is zero. Thus, for a
constant temperature, we have r = 0 and, consequently:

The rates of complex reactions involve the rates of the components which partici-
pate in the several reactions in series, parallel, or combination of both. For simplicity,
we will consider the rates of elementary reactions with integer order, i.e., when the sto-
ichiometric coefficients coincide with the order of the reaction. There are three classic
cases:

The corresponding rates of each component are given by:

−rA = k1CACB + k2CACP
(3.8)
In reversible reactions, the reverse rates should be considered, i.e., the decomposi-
tion of the products in their respective components, whose respective specific reverse
rates would be k′
i of each reaction i.
Examples
1.
In the coal gasification, two main reactions take place:
C + H2O →CO + H2
H = 118.5 kJ/mol
CO + H2O ⇔CO2 + H2 H = −42.3 kJ/mol
This is series–parallel reaction, in which the carbon monoxide reacts with
water, known as a shift reaction. It is reversible, depending on the pressure and
temperature conditions. The first reaction is endothermic, and thus thermody-
namically unfavorable, and only reacts when heat is supplied, while the second
is exothermic, and thus thermodynamically favorable (spontaneous). The rates
corresponding to each component in both reactions are indicated above. The
reversible term should be added.

Utilization of the synthesis gas
Methanation:
CO + 3H2 →CH4 + H2O ⇒H = −206.6 kJ/mol
Fischer–Tropsch synthesis:
CO + 2H2 →[CnH2n]n + H2O ⇒H = −165.0 kJ/mol
Synthesis of methanol:
CO + 2H2 →CH3OH ⇒H = −90.8 kJ/mol
Shift reaction:
CO + H2O ⇔CO2 + H2 ⇒H = −39.8 kJ/mol
These reactions may occur simultaneously or not, depending on the thermody-
namic conditions and especially on the catalyst. In the methanation Ni , catalysts
are used, while in Fischer–Tropsch reactions, Fe or Co catalysts are employed.
In the reactions for methanol synthesis, mixed oxide catalysts of CuO/ZnO are
used, and for the shift reaction, Ni supported catalyst.
The reaction of methanation occurs around 300◦C, whereas the Fischer–
Tropsch synthesis occurs at lower temperatures, between 250◦C and 280◦C. Both
reactions can occur simultaneously in this temperature range.
The corresponding rates can be written as Equation 3.8, considering the
reversibility or not.

Hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to butanol
This transformation can be represented by a reaction in series of the type:
CH3 −CH2 = CH2 −HC = O + H2 →CH3 −CH3 −CH3 −HC = O + H2
Crotonoaldehyde
Butyraldehyde
→CH3 −CH3 −CH3 −HCOH
Butanol
The corresponding rates are shown in Equation 3.7, considering all the limiting
components, since the reaction occurs with excess of hydrogen, and, therefore,
the rate is independent of the concentration of hydrogen.
3.2.1
Kinetic equations
The reaction rates are kinetic equations, written in terms of measurement variables,
such as concentration, partial pressure, and particularly, conversion or extent of reac-
tion. The rate of product formation or transformation of the reactant is expressed in
relation to the concentration of the limiting reactant and is valid for any closed or open
system, at variable or constant volume.

46
Chemical reaction engineering
3.2.1.1
Irreversible reaction at constant volume
Consider the reaction, A + B →R + S, in which A is the limiting reactant. Thus, the
rate will be, according to Equation 3.5:
r = kCa′
ACb′
B ⇒irreversible reaction
(3.9)
By defining the conversion in relation to the limiting component A, we have:
CA = CA0(1 −XA)
CB = BB0 −(b/a)XA = CA0(M −(b/a)XA)
where
M = CB0
CA0
is always ≥1,
relating the initial concentration of the reactants, with A as the limiting reactant. When
B is the limiting reactant, the reaction is inverted, because M is always ≥1. When the
initial concentrations are equal, we have M = 1.
By substituting the concentrations CA andCB into Equation 3.9, we have:
−rA = Cn
A0(1 −XA)a′(M −(b/a)XA)b′
(3.10)
where
n = a′ + b′ ⇒global order
We can define the rate of formation of the products rR, but one must be careful
when relating it with the rate of transformation of reactant. From the proportionality
law, we always have the relationship:
(−rA)
a
= (−rB)
b
= rR
r
(3.11)
Therefore, the specific rates are also defined in relation to each component. By
choosing the reactant A we have kA, and according to Equation 3.11, we can relate it
with any other component, either a reactant or a product:
kA
a = kB
b = kR
r
(3.12)
We will use the specific rate without subscript in order to implicitly correspond to
the rate defined in relation to a particular component.

Kinetic of reactions
47
Particular cases
In most cases, the reactions are irreversible and of integer order, at maximum until the
third order. One must be careful when the stoichiometry is different from the reaction
order, as in the below example:
Reaction : A + 3B →products
Kinetics: Second order and first order in relation to each component. Therefore, the
reaction rate will be:
−rA = kC2
A0(1 −XA)(M −3XA)
(3.13)
where
(b/a) = 3
Pseudo-first-order
The concentration of a particular reactant is much higher than the concentration
of another component. This happens in liquid phase reactions, where one of the com-
ponents, generally water, participates as a reactant and diluent simultaneously. In this
case, the reaction of second order is simplified to pseudo-first-order:
−rA = kC2
A0M(1 −XA)
(3.14)
where:
M ≫1 ⇒CB0 ≫CA0
The rate is represented as a function of the apparent constant k∗= kC2
A0M, i.e.:
−rA = k∗(1 −XA)
(3.15)
Generic order n
When there is a stoichiometric proportionality in the reaction, we can simplify the
global equation. So:
CA
a = CB
b = · · ·
(3.16)
By expressing the concentration CB as a function of CA in Equation 3.9:
−rA = kCa′
ACb′
B
We obtain:
−rA = k∗Cn
A
(3.17)

48
Chemical reaction engineering
where:
k∗= k
b

b′
n = a′ + b′
We also can write this Equation as a function of the conversion (Equation 3.10),
and then we obtain:
−rA = k∗Cn
A0(1 −XA)n
(3.18)
3.2.1.2
Reversible reactions at constant value
The reversible reactions are generically represented by three types:
1.
Reaction of generic order:
aA + bB ⇔rR + sS
whose resultant rate will be:
r = k



r = k

where: K is the chemical equilibrium constant.

Kinetic of reactions
49
By expressing the rates as a function of the conversion, the concentrations are
replaced:
CA = CA0(1 −XA)
CB = CA0(M −(b/a)XA)
or products,
CR = CA0(R + (r/a)XA)
By replacing for the case 2, we have:
r = kCA0

(1 −XA) −1
K(R + (r/a)XA)

(3.19)
However, at the equilibrium, the resulting rate is zero. Thus, from Equation 3.3
and considering the simplest stoichiometry (a = r = 1), we have:
k
k′ = (R + XAe)
(1 −XAe) = K →equilibrium
(3.20)
By replacing K of Equation 3.20 into Equation 3.19, we obtain the rate as a
function of the equilibrium conversion (XAe). The equilibrium conversion can be deter-
mined from the thermodynamic equilibrium constant (knowing G0), or from the
experimental data of the kinetic curve, knowing that when t →∞, the conversion
XA →XAe.
Thus,
r = kCA0(R + 1)
(R + XAe) (XAe −XA)
(3.21)
where k (min−1) is the direct specific rate and R is the relation between the initial con-
centrations of the product CR0 and of the reactant CA0. Starting from a pure reactant,
which is the most common case, we have that R = 0.
The rate varies with the conversions. Initially, it is maximum when XA = 0, decreas-
ing thereafter until the equilibrium is reached and zero when XA →XAe. However, by
differentiating Equation 3.21, it is observed that the rate variation will be:
dr
dXA
= kCA0(R + 1)
(R + XAe) (−1) < 0
(3.22)

50
Chemical reaction engineering
Therefore, the rate decreases negatively and the curve is always concave, yielding
a variation of the type:
dr/dXA
XA
3.2.1.3
Irreversible or reversible reactions at variable volume
A reaction system at constant pressure can be open or closed and can occur in liquid,
gas, or vapor phase. When the reactions are carried out in gas or vapor phase in an open
system and there is variation of the number of moles, there will be volume expansion or
contraction. In a closed system, consider a piston moving without friction, according
to the schemes:

Kinetic of reactions

There are two ways to express the equation of the reaction rate:
1.
As a function of the partial pressures for an irreversible reaction of second order,
in which A is the limiting reactant:
−rA = kCACB ⇒irreversible reaction
(3.23)
Since the concentrations in a system at constant volume are:
CA = pA
RT , CB = pB
RT
we have:
−rA =
k
(RT)2 pApB
(3.24)
It is also possible to express it as a function of the molar fraction and total pressure
of the system, because:
yA = pA
P , yB = pB
P
Thus:
−rA =
k
(RT)2 yAyBP2
(3.25)
In this case, the molar fraction can be expressed as a function of the extent of
reaction (α), by using Equation 1.22, for a reaction of the type:
aA + bB →rR
or
−rA =
k
(RT)2
(nA0 −aα)(nB0 −(b/a)α)
(n0 + ν · α)2
P2
(3.26)
2.
As a function of the molar flows in an open system, for an irreversible reaction
of second order, we start from the same Equation 3.23:
It is known that the molar flows are, respectively:
FA0 = CA0v0
FA = CAv
FB = CBv
By replacing the concentration in Equation 3.23, we have:
−rA = k
FA
v
 FB
v


52
Chemical reaction engineering
The molar flows and the volumetric flow v are known as a function of the
conversion, for reactants or products, by means of Equations 1.21, displayed
below:
FA = FA0(1 −XA)
FB = FB0 −(b/a)FA0XA
Therefore, the final rate will be:
−rA = kC2
A0
(1 −XA)(M −(b/a)XA)
(1 + εAXA)2
(3.27)
Generically, for an order n and partial orders a′, b′ and with temperature variation,
we should take into account the volume variation with temperature, correcting
the previous expression. Under these more general conditions, we have:
−rA = kCn
A0
(1 −XA)a′(M −(b/a)XA)b′

Examples
E3.1 Consider a second order reversible reaction of decomposition A →rR, carried
out in gas phase. Initially, a test I was conducted in a batch reactor, introducing pure
A, at 300 K. After 10 min, the pressure was 3 atm. After a sufficiently long time, the
pressure reached 5 atm, remaining constant afterward.
Subsequently, a test was carried out in a closed system with a piston without
friction, but at constant pressure of 1 atm. The final volume was doubled. Determine
the equation of the rate and calculate both the rate for a conversion of 50% and the
initial rate at such conditions. It is known that k = 003 L/(mol min).
Solution
The first part of the solution is equal to the Problem E1.1.
If the volume is constant, the partial pressure will be 1.25:
pA = pA0 −a
ν(P −P0)
Since
a = 1
for t = ∞⇒pA = 0, pA0 = P0 = 1, and P = 5, we have:
ν = 4 ⇒r = 5

53
But
for t = 10 min ⇒pA0 = 0, P = 1, and P = 3
XA = 1

P −P0
P0
= 0.5
For the second condition, in a plug-flow, the conversion is the same at constant
pressure. But the volume change is:
V = V0(1 + εAXA)
Since:
V = 2V0
we obtain:
2V0 = V0 + V0εAXA
V0εA = 2
With the same conversion, XA = 0.5 ⇒εA = 4.
The rate is of second order and irreversible, and for the batch system this will be:
−rA = kC2
A0(1 −XA)2
or for the plug-flow, at variable volume, this will be:
−rA = kC2
A0
(1 −XA)2
(1 + εAXA)2
(3.29)
But:
CA0 = pA0
RT = P0
RT =

0.082 × 300 = 4.06 × 10−2 mol/L
By replacing the values in Equation 3.29, for XA = 0.5, we have:
Batch
(−rA) = 1.23 × 10−5mol/L min
Plug-flow:
(−rA) = 1.37 × 10−6mol/L min
The initial rate is equal for both cases:
(−rA)0 = 4.95 × 10−5mol/L min

INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON THE REACTION RATE
It was observed experimentally that an increase of 10◦C in temperature can double
the rate in an exothermic reaction. This empirical observation greatly depends on the
reaction. But the fact is that the reaction rate is very sensitive to temperature variation.
A general law of dependence of the rate with the temperature was therefore needed.
It is known that the potential energy varies as the reaction occurs and presents an
energy barrier which should be surpassed for the occurrence of the reaction. Starting
from the different energy levels of the reactants and products, which characterizes the
transformation reaction enthalpy of a chemical reaction, the potential energy curve
varies according to Figure 3.3.
The energy barrier is related to the activation energy, inherent to each reaction. If
the activation energy is higher than the energy barrier, the reaction will occur. Thus,
Arrhenius defined a reaction rate constant which depends mainly on the temperature
and is a function of activation energy E. The Arrhenius equation shows that the reaction
rate constant varies exponentially with the temperature, according to Equation 3.30.
k = k0 · exp(−E/RT)
(3.30)
In this expression, the pre-exponential factor k0 represents a factor proportional
to the number of collisions of the molecules and can be considered constant.

Figure 3.4 Influence of temperature on the rate constant.
According to Figure 3.4, it is possible to observe the influence of the activation
energy on the reaction rate constant and the effect of the temperature.
If the activation energy is constant, the reaction rate constant k varies exponen-
tially with temperature and is very sensitive in a small temperature range but depends
on the order of magnitude of the activation energy. If the activation energy is high,
small changes in temperature significantly affect the constant k. On the other hand,
for low activation energies, the constant k is little sensitive in a wide temperature
range.
The frequency factor k0 is apparently constant. It depends on the probability of
collisions of the molecules and on the temperature. The probability of collision of the
molecules in a space depends on the system energy and reaction medium. In an empty
space, the probability of collision of the molecules is relatively small compared to a
space which is filled with particles.
In this case, the contact surface is much larger and the approach of the molecules
with the surface increases the probability of collision between the molecules. Thus, for
example, for different values of k0 and the same activation energy E = 60 kcal/mol,
at constant temperature of 600 K, very different values of k are obtained, which can
reach up to 100 times higher.
⇒for k0 = 1020 ⇒k = 1.164 × 10−2 min−1 ⇒(empty volume)
⇒for k0 = 1022 ⇒k = 1.164 min−1
⇒(volume with particles)

56
Chemical reaction engineering
The effect of temperature on k0 is small and, according to the theory of collisions,
varies at the maximum with a power m. Admitting that:
k0 = k′
0Tm
(3.31)
The reaction rate constant will be:
k = k′
0Tm · exp (−E/RT)
(3.32)
Taking the natural log and differentiating with respect to temperature, we have:
d ln k
dT
= m
T +
E
RT2 = mRT + E
RT2
(3.33)
The numerator of the last term of this expression shows that the value of mRT
is much smaller when compared to E. By assigning a maximum value of m to 2,
R = 1.98 cal/mol and considering the average activation energy of about 25000 cal/mol,
for a temperature of 300 K, we have:
mRT ≈2370
This value is 20 times smaller than E = 25,000, and therefore, we can neglect
the term mRT in Equation 3.33, and, consequently, the frequency factor k0 can be
considered constant. The variation of the reaction rate constant k with the temperature
will be:
d ln k
dT

RT2
(3.34)
3.3.1
Reversible reactions
In reversible reactions of the type, there are two reaction rate constants (direct and
reverse), with the corresponding activation energies. Thus:
Direct reaction ⇒rd = kf (CA, CB), k = k0 e−(E/RT)
Reverse reaction ⇒rr = kf (CR), k′ = k′
0 e−(E′/RT)
We have seen that the chemical equilibrium constant for the same temperature is
given by eq. 3.20:
K = k
k′ .

Kinetic of reactions
57
Taking the natural log of both sides of the equation, we have:
ln K = ln k −ln k′
The variation of the constants with temperature will be:
d ln K
dT
= d ln k
dT
−d ln k′
dT
By substituting the first term by the Van’t Hoff equation (2.12)
d ln K
dT
= H0
RT2
and the other terms by the Arrhenius equation (Equation 3.34) for the two constants,
we have:
H0 = E −E′
(3.35)
This equation relates the enthalpy of the reaction, which is a thermodynamic
property, with the direct (E) and reverse (E′) activation energies. If the reaction is
exothermic, the enthalpy H0 < 0 and, therefore, E < E′. Therefore, the direct activa-
tion energy is always lower than the reverse, and, consequently, the direct reaction is
facilitated because the lower the activation energy, the easier the reaction occurs. The
opposite happens with endothermic reactions, in which the enthalpy H0 > 0, and,
therefore E < E′. In this context, the reverse reaction is easier.
The effect of temperature on the resulting rate is generally represented by:
r = k0 · exp (−E/RT) · f (CA, CB) −k′
0 · exp (−E′/RT) · f (CR)
Differentiating with respect to the temperature and considering that the first term
corresponds to the direct rate rd and the second to the reverse rate rr, we have:
d ln r
dT =
E
RT2 rd −
E′
RT2 rr
(3.36)
Note that the direct (rd) and reverse (rr) rate increase with the increase in temper-
ature and are always positive. Moreover, the direct and reverse activation energies are
always positive. Therefore, the variation of the rate with the increase in temperature is
always positive. However, depending on whether the reaction is exothermic (H0 < 0
and E < E′), the variation of the resulting rate will depend on the difference Erd–E′rr.
Therefore, the resulting rate increases and is always positive, and when the reverse
rate increases, the resulting rate reaches a maximum value and decreases positively
(according to Figure 3.5). Thus:
d ln r
dT > 0

Interpretation remarks
1.
Order of magnitude of the activation energy
By expressing the Arrhenius equation in logarithmic form (Equation 3.37) and
representing it graphically as shown in Figure 3.6, a straight line is obtained,
whose angular coefficient is

−E
R

:
ln k = ln k0 −E
RT
(3.37)
The slopes are different and from the graph, we can note that the activation
energies are constant, but E1 < E2. This means that depending on the reaction,
the activation energy changes. Through this graph, it is possible to determine
the activation energy of the reaction by measuring the rates or specific rates at
different temperatures. It is recommended to carry out at least three experiments
or three measurements at different temperatures.
2.
Intermediate steps
The nonelementary reactions consist of several steps of elementary reactions.
They are recognized by the change in activation energy. Thus, if the form of
Arrhenius plots is a curve, one can recognize two or more intermediate steps, as
shown in Figure 3.7.
The activation energy varies with the temperature during the reaction, indicat-
ing that there was a change of mechanism or compensatory effect.
3.
Diffusive effects
The activation energy at high temperatures is lower than at lower tempera-
tures, according to Figure 3.8, which means that the kinetic regime changed.

The activation energy at lower temperatures represents the kinetic regime. The
behavior at high temperatures is influenced by the diffusion or mass trans-
fer. Therefore, there are diffusive effects hampering the determination of the
“real’’ chemical reaction in the kinetic regime. An “apparent’’ activation energy
is obtained. Therefore, it is essential to choose the temperature range for the

determination of the activation energy, ensuring the kinetic regime. It is also a
way to check if the experiment was conducted without diffusion effects and an
indication of the validity of a kinetic experience.

3.3.3
Reparameterization of the Arrhenius equation
Commonly, mathematical models contain variables that cannot be measured directly.
The values of these variables, called model parameters, can be estimated from
experimental data with the help of parameter estimation procedures, which consist
in minimizing some sort of objective function that takes into account the dif-
ference between model responses and experimental observations, as described in
Chapter 11. A common model used to describe the temperature dependence of
reaction rates in kinetic problems is the Arrhenius equation, described in previous
sections:
k = k0 exp

−E
RT

(3.38)
where k is the reaction rate constant (or the specific reaction rate), T is the absolute
temperature, R is the ideal gas constant, k0 is the frequency (or pre-exponential) fac-
tor and E is the activation energy. Both k0 and E are the parameters of the Arrhenius

equation, usually estimated from available experimental data. However, the intrinsic
mathematical structure of the Arrhenius equation introduces a very strong dependence
between the parameters k0 and E (called ‘parameter correlation’), making the esti-
mation of the parameter values difficult. To overcome this difficulty, many authors
(Box, 1960; Himmelblau, 1970; Pritchard and Bacon, 1975) suggested the repa-
rameterization of the Arrhenius equation by introducing a reference temperature in
the form:

The introduction of reference temperature into the Arrhenius equation allows for
reduction of the parameter correlation and, consequently, for reduction of the com-
putational effort required for estimation of model parameters (Espie and Macchietto,
1988; Schwaab and Pinto, 2007). The reference temperature is usually defined as a
suitable average temperature of the analyzed experimental data. For instance, Veglio
et al. (2001) suggested the use of the inverse average:
1
Tref

NE

i=1

(3.46)
where NE is the number of experimental temperature values and Ti is the temperature
of the individual experiments i. Particularly, Schwaab and Pinto (2007) showed that the

62
Chemical reaction engineering
proper definition of the reference temperature can eliminate the parameter correlation
in kinetic models containing a single kinetic constant. It was shown both analytically
and numerically that proper definition of reference temperature allows for elimina-
tion of the parameter correlation and simultaneous improvement of the precision of
parameter estimates. For this reason, in the following sections the reparametrized form
of the Arrhenius equation will be used frequently for quantitative analyses of kinetic
data, as described in detail in Section 11.8.

Chapter 4
Molar balance in open and closed
systems with chemical reaction
The kinetic experiments are carried out in reactors in closed or open systems. There
are three common cases:
Batch.
Continuous.
Semicontinuous.
For kinetic purposes, the variation of the concentration or the pressure with reac-
tion time is accompanied in a batch reactor. In a continuous or open system, the
pressure is constant and the concentrations or molar flows of the reactants and prod-
ucts are accompanied in the course of the reaction or along the reactor. The time
is substituted by an equivalent variable called space time. The space time takes into
account the inlet volumetric flow of the reactants and the volume of the reactor, and,
thus, has unit of time, here designated by:
τ = V
v0
(h)
The inverse is the space velocity.
The molar balance in an open system and for any reaction of the type, initially at
constant temperature, is shown in Scheme 4.1, in which j is a component, reactant, or
product:

Considering Fj the molar flow of the component j, Gj the rate of generation of

have the following molar balance:
Fj0 −Fj + Gj = dnj

(4.1)
Note that the balance is carried out to any component, reactant, or product of the
reaction, and has the unit of mol/time.
Schematically, it is shown in Figure 4.1.
The rate of generation of products or consumption of reactants in the system is
represented per unit of volume, within each element of volume V. So:
Gj = rjV
where: rj (rate) ⇒(mol/time·volume)

(4.2)
This is the general equation of the molar balance for any component j.
Thereafter, one can make several simplifications.
4.1
BATCH
In this case, there is no flow, and, therefore, the terms referring to flow disappear. We
then obtain the equation for the batch reactor:

rj dV = dnj
dt
(4.3)
If the volume is constant, we have:
rjV = dnj
dt
(4.4)
An expression equal to the rate already defined is obtained, representing the varia-
tion of the number of moles of a component, reactant, or product, per unit of volume,
in a closed system. We should remember that if the rate corresponds to the formation
of the product, it has positive sign (rj). On the other hand, if the rate corresponds to
the transformation of the reactant, it has negative sign (−rj).
Consider the reaction of the type:
A →products
If the reaction is of first order, we have as a function of the conversion:
nA = nA0(1 −XA)
From Equation 4.4, we have:
(−rA) = −1

CONTINUOUS STIRRING TANK REACTOR
Consider as the starting point the general equation (Equation 4.2) for any component
of the reaction. In general, the regime is considered to be permanent. When there
is disturbance of the system, the term of the Scheme 4.1 is included. Otherwise, the
respective term is not included. In most cases, this type of reactor is used for reactions
in liquid phase, and, therefore, the volume is constant. If gas phase reactions occur,
we should consider the variation of the volume, according to Equation 1.13. Thus:
Fj0 −Fj + rjV = 0
(4.8)
For a reactant A or B of the reaction of the type:
aA + bB →rR
we have:
FA0 −FA + rAV = 0
(4.9)
Considering the molar flow as a function of the conversion, according to Equation
1.21, i.e.:
FA = FA0(1 −XA)
And substituting FA in Equation 4.9, we have:
FA0XA = (−rA)V
(4.10)
Hence, we can determine the rate (−rA) with the conversion, reactor volume, and
inlet molar flow.
If the molar balance is carried out in relation to the product R or S:
FR0 −FR + rRV = 0
(4.11)
Thus, by using the relation shown in Equation 1.20:
FA0 −FA
aFA0
= FB0 −FB
bFA0
= FR −FR0
rFA0
We obtain:
FR −FR0 = (r/a)FA0XA

(4.12)
Note the positive signal corresponding to the formation rate of R. This rate can
be determined, knowing the conversions, the reactor volume, and inlet molar flux of
the reactant.
4.3
CONTINUOUS TUBULAR REACTOR
The concentration and therefore the molar flows and reaction rate vary along the
reactor. The differential balance is performed, starting from Equation 4. Considering
a permanent regime for simplification, as in the previous case, we obtain Scheme 4.2:
Fj0
Fj
Fj + dFj
dV
z
By performing the balance in the element dV, considering that the cross section of
the tube is constant, we obtain:
Fj −(Fj + dFj) + rj dV = 0
(4.13)
Therefore:
dFj = rj dV
(4.14)
Analogously, for a reaction of the type:
aA + bB →rR
The molar balance in relation to the reactant A (or B), considering that:
FA = FA0(1 −XA)
⇓
dFA = −FA0 dXA
Thus:
FA0 dXA = (−rA) dV
(4.15)
or in relation to the product R, by using the relation 1.20:
FA0 dXA = (rR)dV
(4.16)

68
Chemical reaction engineering
Again, note that in the transformation of the reactant, the rate has negative sign,
and in the formation of the product, the rate has positive sign, in accordance with the
definition initially adopted.
In any case, we can integrate with respect to the total volume of the reactor V and
the final conversion reached XA. If we use the definition of space time t, which relates
the volume of the reactor with the volumetric flow:
τ = V

We obtain:
τ = V

where: ⇒

In this case, it is important to note that the conversion is defined in relation to the
limiting reactant A.
For kinetic purposes, when the objective is to determine the reaction rate as
a function of the concentration, pressure, or conversion, we use these systems in
ideal conditions at constant temperature. Diffusive or mass transfer effects should
be minimized or eliminated.

Part II
Kinetics


Chapter 5
Determination of kinetic parameters
The kinetic parameters of the reaction rate are the rate constants k and the orders (a′,
b′, n) of the reaction in relation to each component. The effect of the temperature is
incorporated in the reaction rate and in order to determine it, the activation energy E
and the frequency factor k0 should be determined.
There are two methods: integral and differential. The integral method has an
advantage of having an analytical solution. The differential method has an approxi-
mate or numerical solution. For all cases, experimental data obtained in laboratory
are necessary, both for batch and continuous systems.
INTEGRAL METHOD
There are four successive steps:
1.
Selection of the kinetic model: a reaction with defined order (integer or fractional),
and the appropriate reaction rate is written:
rj = kCa′
ACb′
B = kf (Cn
j ) = kCn
A0 f (XA)
where rj is the rate of the component j of the reaction, reactant, or product; A
is the limiting reactant, f (XA) is a function of the conversion XA for irreversible
and reversible reactions.
Generally, we assume an integer order. Therefore:
rj = kCn
A0 f (XA)
(5.1)
2.
Selection of the system: batch or continuous (tubular). For both cases, the
expression of the rate is substituted, and we obtain a solution of the type:
Batch (Equation 4.7):

Mathematical solution: In general, the integral is solved analytically when the
order of the reaction is an integer. When the order is fractional or the model is
more complex, the integral is solved numerically. Figure 5.1 illustrated the integral
solution.
Note that the area under the curve is equal to the integral represented in Equa-
tions 5.2 and 5.3, according to Figure 5.1. If we represent the areas by F(XA), for
each value of XA, we have a linear equation of the type:
F(XA) = Cn−1
A0 kτ
(5.4)
This equation is graphically presented in Figure 5.2, where k is a constant.
4.
Experimental verification: The laboratory experiments provide the measurements
of the concentration as a function of time or space time, for a constant temper-
ature. The conversions, the function f (XA), and finally the specific rate (rate
constant) k are calculated. If the experimental values of F(XA) versus t or τ are
on the line, it can be concluded that the proposed model is correct. Otherwise,
we would have to choose other model. In Figure 5.2, we can see the gray dots
that follow the model. The black dots indicate that the model is not appropriate.

IRREVERSIBLE REACTION AT CONSTANT VOLUME
Reaction of the type: A →products

(5.5a)

74
Chemical reaction engineering
5.1.2
Kinetic model of second order (global)
This model represents the reaction of the type:
Case (a) 2A →products
Case (b) A + B →products
The corresponding rates, according to Equation 1.5a:
For irreversible reactions of second order:
⇒a′ = 1, b′ = 1 ⇒(−rA) = kCACB = kC2
A0(1 −XA)(M −XA)
⇒a′ = 2, b′ = 0 ⇒(−rA) = kC2
A = kC2
A0(1 −XA)2
In this case, we have a reaction which is first order in respect to each component
and presents global second order. We assume that the stoichiometric coefficients are
also equal, which characterizes an elementary reaction. However, the coefficients can
be different, as for example:
Case (c) A + 2B →products
With respect to the component B, the reaction is first order (b′ = 1). Thus:
⇒(−rA) = kC2
A0(1 −XA)(M −2XA)
Substituting the expressions of the rates in Equation 5.3 for a continuous tubular
system, we obtain the following solution (case (b)):
1
(M −1) ln (M −XA)
M(1 −XA) = kCA0τ
(5.6)
Or for a batch system (Equation 5.2):
1
(M −1) ln (M −XA)
M(1 −XA) = kCA0t
(5.6a)
where:
M = CB0
CA0
, when A is the limiting reactant
For a continuous stirred tank system, the solution will be different, because when
substituting the rate (−rA) in Equation 4.10, we obtain:
XA
(1 −XA)(M −XA) = τkCA0
(5.7)
Therefore, the choice of the reactor is very important in order to determine the
kinetic parameters and use the specific kinetic expressions.

Determination of kinetic parameters
75
If we have an irreversible reaction of second order in which the initial con-
centrations are equal (thus, M = 1), we cannot simplify Equation 5.6, because it is
undetermined. We should then start from another kinetic model, i.e.:
(−rA) = kC2
A = kC2
A0(1 −XA)2
The solutions for the batch or tubular tank are, respectively:
(tubular or batch)
XA
(1 −XA) = kCA0τ
or
XA
(1 −XA) = kCA0t
or
(5.8)

(5.8a)
Example
E5.1 A reaction A →4R is carried out in a batch reactor. A is introduced with 50%
(vol) of inert.
The reaction is irreversible and the reaction order is integer. However, it is not
known if the reaction is first or second order. Do a test and show the difference. The
reaction is carried out at constant temperature at 27◦C. The final pressure measured
was 10 atm, which remained constant. It was observed that after 8 min the total
pressure was 8 atm.
Solution
It is observed that the final pressure of 10 atm was reached when all the reactant was
transformed into product. However, the initial total pressure is unknown, and 50%
corresponds to the inert. Therefore, by applying the law of partial pressures, we have:
pA = pA0 −a
ν(P −P0)
In this case, pA = 0, pA0 = 0.5, and P0, = 1/3. Thus, when P = 10 atm, we have
P0 = 4 atm.
With these values, we can calculate the conversion after 8 min, since:
XA = pA0 −pA
pA0
= 1

(P −P0)
0.5P0
= 0.67
Considering a first-order reaction: Equation 5.5a:
−ln(1 −XA) = kt
(5.6a)

76
Chemical reaction engineering
Thus:
k = 0.11 min −1
Considering a second-order reaction: Equation 5.8:
XA
(1 −XA) = kCA0t
Since:
CA0 = pA0
RT =
0.5P0
0.082 × 330 = 7.39 × 10−2 mol/L
we obtain:
k = 2.74 L/mol min
Note that values of k are different. It is therefore necessary to verify experimentally
and observe if the value of k is constant. Since in the present case there is only one
experimental data, it is not possible to conclude what is the true order of the reaction
and the reaction rate constant.
5.2
IRREVERSIBLE REACTIONS AT VARIABLE VOLUME
The typical reaction at variable volume can be represented as follows:
Case (a) A →R + S
⇒with volume expansion
Case (b) A + B →R
⇒with volume contraction
Case (c) 2A →R
⇒with volume contraction
5.2.1
Irreversible of first order
Consider initially a first-order reaction. From the expression of the rate (3.9), when
a′ = 1, b′ = 0 and n = 1, together with Equation 1.17. Thus, for a constant T, we have:
(−rA) = kCA0
(1 −XA)
(1 + εAXA)
For a tubular reactor (Equation 5.3), the expression of the rate is substituted, and
after the integration, we obtain the following equation:
−(1 + εA) ln(1 −XA) −εAXA = kτ
(5.9)
This solution is different from that of Equation 5.5 for a system at constant volume.
The solution is the same when εA = 0.

For a batch reactor, the expression change, since we start from the expression at
variable volume (Equation 4.6), i.e.:

(4.6)
For gas-phase reactions, such as in a plug-flow batch reactor at constant pressure,
the volume varies according:
V = V0(1 + εAXA)
Substituting the rate and volume expressions, we obtain:
−ln(1 −XA) = kt
(5.10)
This expression is equal to the batch or tubular systems at constant volume.
Therefore, if the volume varies, this variation will be:
V = V −V0 = V0εAXA
Thus:
XA = V

Substituting in Equation 5.10, we obtain:

When M = 1, we can simplify for the case (b).

Example
E5.2 A reaction A →2R + S is carried out in a tubular reactor, and the reactant A is
introduced with 30% of inert. The reaction is irreversible and of second order. The
reactor of 0.2 L is isothermal, and the reaction occurs at 800 K and pressure of 10 atm.
It is known that the outflow of the product R is 0.034 mol/s and the conversion was
10%. Calculate the reaction rate constant. If this reaction would be further carried
out in a batch reactor, calculate the reaction time for the previous conditions.
Solution
Since we have a second-order irreversible reaction, the rate is:
(−rA) = kC2
A
and consequently as a function of the conversion we have:
(−rA) = kC2

(b) If the reaction is conducted in a batch system at constant volume, we have that
εA = 0.
Thus, we calculate the time necessary to reach the same previous conversions, by
using the expression for the batch system, i.e., Equation 5.8:
XA
(1 −XA) = kCA0t
Thus,
t = 0.107 s
When comparing with τ = 0.124 s−1, we can observe a difference due to the expansion
of the gas-phase continuous system.

IRREVERSIBLE REACTIONS OF ORDER
n–HALF-LIFE METHOD
There are processes with reactions that is not well defined and with several components.
Several elementary or intermediate reactions can occur, which cannot be classified in

Chemical reaction engineering
the simple models of integer order. In the pyrolysis of naphtha or bituminous com-
pounds, it is known that some major component is transformed, with the formation
of several nonidentified products simultaneously. A main component is chosen as a
reference for the kinetic study and we assume a global order n. Schematically, we
have:
aA + bB →products
or
aA →R + S + T
The rate is generically represented in relation to the principal component A:
(−rA) = kCn
A
(3.17)
in which k is the apparent constant and n is the apparent global order.
In a batch reactor, the volume is constant; therefore, starting from Equation 5.2
as a function of the concentration:
t = CA0

(−rA) = −

Integrating, we obtain:

(5.14)
Or as a function of the conversion of A, we obtain:
C1−n
A
[(1 −XA)1−n −1] = (n −1)kt
(5.15)
Note that there are two unknowns, k and n, and hence the solution must be
iterative. In general, we simplify by choosing a concentration and the corresponding
time. It is difficult to follow reactions which have too low or too high rates, since they
take too long or too short to occur, respectively.
In this method, it is proposed to set a time and determine the concentration at that
moment. However, the experiment also changes, since it is necessary to start it with
a new initial concentration. The concentration is then measured as a function of time
for different initial concentrations and for a certain time t.
Usually, we adopt the half-life criterion, considering the half-life time (t1/2), which
corresponds to a conversion of 50% or half of the initial concentration (Figure 5.3).
Note that it is possible to choose any conversion and determine the corresponding
time. As an example, for XA = 0.7, the corresponding time is t0.7.
In the case of half-life, Equation 5.15 becomes:
C1−n
A0 [2(n−1) −1] = (n −1)kt1/2

There are special cases in which the specific rate can be determined directly through
a single measurement, knowing the initial concentration and the half-time life. Exact
solutions are obtained. However, when the reaction is of first order (n = 1), Equation
5.16 is undetermined. So, we start from Equation 5.5, making XA = 0.5. For a reaction
of zero order, in which the rate is independent of the concentration, the expression
above is simplified.
Therefore:
For n = 0 :
k = CA0

For n = 1 :
k = 0.693

Graphically, we have the following representation as shown in Figure 5.4.

E5.3 A reaction A →R + S is carried out in a batch reactor (constant volume). The
experiment was started with several initial concentrations and when half of the con-
centration was reached, the corresponding time was measured. The following table
gives the values for two different temperatures. Determine the order of the reaction,
the specific rate, and the activation energy.

Equations 5.19 and 5.20. Note that only one value was provided for the temperature
of 110◦C. The order n is constant and it will be determined with the first data set.
Therefore, we can obtain the order n and the constant k through Equation 5.20, i.e.:

Therefore:

n = 2.16
with a mean standard deviation of 0.99.
Thus:
(−rA) = k∗C2.16
A
The constant k∗can be calculated by substituting the value of n in the equation
above and by using an experimental value, for example, the first value of the table:
CA0 = 0.025 when t1/2 = 4.1.
We obtain from equation 5.21:
k = 16.5 min−1

The solution is simplified to an exact solution (considering n = 2), and comparing
with the previous case. In this case, we start from the Equation 5.8 (for a batch system):

with XA = 0.5 and t = t1/2, we obtain:

CA0t1/2
(A)
(5.22)
Thus:
k100 = 9.76 L mol−1 min −1
error is 17%, and, therefore, not neglegible.
With this consideration, we may calculate the value of k, assuming a second-order
reaction, and using the values of the table for 110◦C in Equation 5.22. We then obtain
for CA0 = 0.025 and t1/2 = 2.0:
k110 = 16.0 L min −1
Note that the value of k is doubled. Moreover, we can see from the table that, or
the same initial concentrationCA0, the half-life time at 110◦C was exactly half of the
value at 100◦C. Consequently, the constant k is expected to double. Note that with a
variation of 10◦C, the constant doubled, indicating a significant effect of temperature
on the reaction rate.
We can now calculate the constant k for any temperature, determining the
activation energy E and the constant k0 of the Arrhenius equation (Equation 3.30):
k = k0 exp(−E/RT)
Taking the natural log on both sides of the equation, we have (Equation 3.37):
ln k = ln k0 −E

REVERSIBLE REACTIONS AT CONSTANT VOLUME
In the reversible reactions at constant volume, we have to determine two reaction
rate constants, i.e., the direct constant (k) and the reverse constant (k′), which are
temperature dependent and the units depend on the order of reaction of the reactants
or products. The determination of these constants follows the same procedure. We will
use here the two simplest cases, i.e., the integer order and constant volume.

It is assumed that the reactants A and B enter the system as pure components and

the value of the k∗from Equation 5.29 and the thermodynamic constant K are the

Example
E5.4 The reaction A R will be carried out in a tubular reactor (PFR) at 87◦C. Pure
reactant is introduced isothermally at 1.0 L/min and 10 atm. However, the specific rates
are unknown. Therefore, experiments were separately conducted in batch reactor. Pure
reactant was introduced at 1 atm and 27◦C. It was observed that after 100 min, the
conversion was 40%. When the conversion reached 90%, no change was observed
anymore. In another experiment at 107◦C, the same conversion of 40% was obtained,
but in less time (20 min). After reaching a conversion of 60%, there was no more
change. Determine the volume of the PFR under the specified conditions, knowing
that the outflow of the product R was 0.20 mol/min.
Solution
(a) Determination of the direct (k) and reverse (k′) specific rates.
For a reversible reaction that is first order in both directions, we have:
r = kCA −k′CR
The specific rates are k and k′. The batch reactor was chosen in order to determine
these constants. Therefore, substituting the rate in the equation of the batch reactor
and integrating, we obtain the expression already deduces previously (Equation 5.24):
−ln

1 −XA
XAe

= k(1 + R)
(R + XAe)t
(5.30)
In this case, since the reactant is only present in the beginning, R = 0. Thus, if the
equilibrium conversion XAe= 0.90, and the conversion XA = 0.40 after 100 min, we
can determine the constant k:
K27 = 5.29 × 10−3 min −1
In the equilibrium, the resulting rate is zero and the constant K can be determined.
Therefore, since the equilibrium conversion XAe = 0.90, we have:
K = k
k′ =
X2
Ae
(1 −XAe) = 9
Thus, the reverse specific rate will be:
k′
27 = 5.87 × 10−4 min −1
The specific rates were calculated for a temperature of 27◦C (300 K). In order to
know the specific rate at 87◦C, we need to calculate the activation energy E. For this,
we use the data at 107◦C. By using the same equations described above, we have:
k107 = 3.29 × 10−2 min −1
k′
107 = 2.19 × 10−2 min −1

90
Chemical reaction engineering
We then calculate the activation energy, using the two values of k and of k′:
E = R
ln k107/k27
(1/T27 −1/T107)
and analogously the reverse activation energy E′. Note that the temperatures are given
in kelvin.
Therefore:
E = 5.135 cal/mol
E′ = 10.211 cal/mol
These data show that the direct rate is greater than the reverse rate, since K is
higher. Furthermore, since the reverse activation energy is greater than the direct one,
the barrier energy of the reverse reaction is higher than that of the direct reaction.
From the Arrhenius equation, we have to determine the frequency factor k0, which
are independent of the temperature. Thus:
k = k0 exp ( −E/RT)
For T = 300 K, k27 = 5.29 × 10−3 min−1. Thus:
k0 = 30.0 min −1
The same procedure is valid for determining the constant k′
0 = 1.71 × 104 min−1.
With these values, we have the following equations valid for any temperature:
k = 30e−5135/RT
k′ = 1.71 × 104e−10211/RT
We finally can calculate the specific rate at 87◦C. Substituting the values, we have:
k87 = 2.25 × 10−2 min −1
k′
87 = 1.03 × 10−2 min −1
The equilibrium conversion can be determined:
K87 = k87

If we have the molar flow in the reactor outlet, we can calculate the conversion:

FR = CRν0 = CA0ν0XA
The initial concentration can be calculated through the general gas law:
CA0 = P
RT =
10
0.082 × 360 = 3.38 × 10−1 moles/L
Thus:
FR = CA0v0XA = 3.38 × 10−1 × 1.0 × XA = 0.20
XA = 0.59
Substituting these values in Equation 5.24, we obtain:
τ = 60 min
And the volume of the reactor will be:
V = 60 L
Example
E5.5 The reversible second-order (direct and reverse) reaction 2C2H5NCO→C2H5N2
(C = O)C2H5 is conducted in a 5 mL continuous reactor (PFR) at 25◦C. Under these
conditions, the equilibrium constant is 0.125. Pure reactant with a concentration of
0.2 mol/L is introduced at 0.36 L/h and the final conversion is 70% of the equilibrium
conversion. Calculate the direct and reverse specific rate.

5.5
DETERMINATION OF THE KINETIC PARAMETERS BY THE
DIFFERENTIAL METHOD
In the differential method, we have two approaches:
1.
Using the concentration data as a function of time obtained experimentally, the
rates are determined by approximation from the kinetic curves.
2.
Determining the rates directly, using the data from a differential reactor.
Therefore, for a reaction of the type:
A →R + S + T
The rate can also be generically represented as a function of the principal
component A, with the general order:
(−rA) = k∗Cn
A
where k∗is the apparent constant and n is the global order.
In a system at constant volume, the rate will be:
(−rA) = −dCA
dt
Thus, taking the natural log on both sides of the equation, we have:
ln(−rA) = ln

From the kinetic curve (Figure 5.6A) obtained from the experimental data, we
have the corre3sponding rate for each concentration (tangent of the curve). We can
then calculate the valued of the table and the graph corresponding to Equation 5.33.

With the experimental data shown in Figure 5.6 and with the table, we can obtain
the graph displayed in Figure 5.7 corresponding to Equation 5.33. Thus, we can
directly determine the order of the reaction n and the apparent constant k*.
When the order in relation to each component is different and not an integer, we
use the same methodology. However, in this case, we would have to carry out different
experiments.
When the reaction involves several components, we should determine the order of
the reaction in relation to each component. This is only possible if the reaction can be

controlled in such a way that the concentration of only one component varies. There
are three possibilities:
(a)
The concentration of the principal component varies, and the other components
are not consumed during the reaction.
(b)
The concentration of the principal component is monitored, maintaining the
concentrations of other components constant and adding reactant in a proportion
that compensates its consumption during the reaction.
(c)
The concentration of the principal component is monitored, maintaining the
concentrations of other components constant and introducing them in excess,
relative to the concentration of the principal component. The variation in the
concentration of the reactants in excess is negligible.
(d)
Both concentrations vary, and we should proceed in the same way, as shown in
the following example. This is method of the partial rate.
For an irreversible reaction at constant volume of the type:
A + B →products
The corresponding rate will be:
(−rA) = kCa′
ACb′
B
Therefore, keeping the concentration of B constant, the expression can be
simplified:
(−rA) = k∗Ca′
A
where:
k∗= kCb′
B
By proceeding analogously, we can calculate k∗and a′. Subsequently, we now keep
the concentration of A constant. Thus, we obtain the new rate:
(−rA) = k′′Cb′
B
where:
k′′ = k∗Ca′
A
Analogously, we can determine the exponent b′ and the constant k′′. We have the
following situations, as shown in Figure 5.7.
Finally, knowing the rate (−rA) for the defined concentrations and the orders a′
and b′, we can directly calculate the specific rate k∗, since:
k∗= (−rA)

ACb′

The kinetic curves may have opposite behavior. When the reaction is fast, con-
centration drops sharply with time, whereas when the reaction is very slow the
concentration drops slowly with the reaction time. In both cases, the rates obtained
by the tangents to the curve are very imprecise.
Another way is to determine only the initial rates (t = 0) and proceed in the same
way. The downside is that several experiments should be carried out, starting from
different initial concentrations. It is not necessary to stop the experiment. With the
initial values, we can determine the kinetic curve and the reaction are interrupted.
Furthermore, it is more accurate. Therefore, we use Equations 5.33 and 5.34, but with
the initial values, i.e.:

5.5.1
Differential reactor
To determine the kinetic parameters, we use the differential reactor. In this continuous
flow system, the variation in concentration between the inlet and outlet of the reactor
should be small and finite. The conversions should be around 5–10%. Under these
conditions, the diffusive and mass transfer effects are avoided, assuring a kinetic regime
for the determination of the kinetic parameters. Unlike the case of the batch system,
the spatial time and consequently, the inlet flow and the mass or volume of the reactor
are varied. Therefore, the reaction rate is directly determined.
In a continuous system, the differential molar balance in a finite volume ·V will
be as follows:
The molar flow in the reactor inlet and outlet will be FA0 and FAs, respectively.
Therefore (Equation 4.13):
FA0 −FAs + rAV = 0
Considering that V = V, we have:
(−rA) = FA0 −FAs
V
[mol/L min]
(5.39)
If the reaction takes place at constant volume, we can approximate the rate for
concentration, i.e.:
(−rA) = (CA0 −CAs)v0
V
(5.40)
where v0 is the volumetric flow and V is the reactor volume.
Figure 5.10 Differential reactor—initial rates.

Determination of kinetic parameters
101
Note that when the reactor volume is small, the space velocities are high, but the
space time is very small, and consequently, the conversions are very low. Thus, the rate
practically corresponds to the initial rate, i.e.:
(−rA) = (−rA)0
(5.41)
This is the rate measured experimentally and to determine the reaction rate con-
stants, we need a kinetic model, which may be of integer or fractional order, as has
been done previously. The difference here is that the rate was obtained experimentally,
thus avoiding problems of extrapolation and the use of approximation approaches in
the determinations of the tangents to the kinetic curves seen in the differential method.
Furthermore, complex integrations are avoided, as in the case of the integral method.
Taking the natural log on both sides of the equation, the parameters are determined
according to Equation 5.35, i.e.:
ln (−rA0) = ln k∗+ n ln CA0
(5.42)

E5.7 The hydrogenation of octene to octane was performed in a reactor differential,
by measuring the initial rates as a function of the respective concentrations of the
reactant B. It is known that the reaction order of hydrogen is 1. However, the order in

performed at 1 atm and 500◦C. Under these conditions, the following experimental

stituting n = 1.4 in the equation above and the values corresponding to a particular
experimental data, the reaction rate constant is calculated. Therefore:

UNCERTAINTIES OF KINETIC PARAMETERS
An important point to consider during the determination of kinetic parameters is the
fact that experimental measurements can only be obtained with finite precision because
of the unavoidable occurrence of experimental fluctuations, as discussed in Section 1.8
and Section 1.9. Consequently, as kinetic parameters must be obtained with help of
uncertain experimental data, they are also subject to uncertainties and fluctuations.
For illustrative purposes, let us consider the first-order kinetic rate equation used to
describe the batch reaction system presented in Example E5.1. Based on the proposed
example:
k = −ln (1 −XA)
t
(5.44)
where
XA = 2

Besides, it was assumed that experimental measurements were available, as P0 = 4
atm and P = 8 atm after t = 8 min. However, the information presented in Example
E5.1 was not complete, because the pressure and time measurement systems were cer-
tainly subject to uncertainties and the intrinsic precisions of the measuring devices were
not reported. Thus, let us assume that the pressure and time measurements were sub-
ject to fluctuations that presented sample variances s2
P and s2
t , respectively, as defined
in Equation (1.9.1) of Section 1.9. Then, if one additionally assumes that measurement
fluctuations were small (and they often are large!), it becomes possible to write:
dk =

Equation (5.46) shows very clearly that uncertainties in k (dk) result from the
intrinsic uncertainties of the measuring devices (dP, dP0 and dt). The mathematical
operation performed to obtain Equation (5.46) is the well-known error propagation
procedure, valid when the fluctuations are small and can be somehow represented by
the differential of the analyzed variable or expression. In other words, if k can be
obtained as a complex mathematical transformation f () of other variables x1, x2, …,
xNX in the form:
k = f (x1 · · · xNX)
(5.47)
then
dk =
NX
i=1
∂f
∂xi

(5.48)
Finally, if it is assumed that the error measurements are independent and do not
affect each other (and real measurements are frequently correlated!!!), then it becomes
possible to write (Schwaab and Pinto, 2007):
s2
k =
NX

Now, using the available data and assuming that the sample standard deviations
are equal to sP = 0.1 atm and st = 0.1, Equation (5.50) becomes:

(5.51)
0.01 = 1.98 × 10−4 min−2
Therefore, in this particular case, k= 0.11 min–1 and s2
k = 1.98 × 10−4 min−2, so
that sk = 0.014 min−1. If it is assumed that the kinetic parameter follows the normal
distribution (and model parameters mostly do not follow this particular distribution!),
then it is possible to write Equation (1.9.9) in Section 1.9:
k = (0.137 ± 2 ∗0.014) min−1 with 95%confidence
k = (0.137 ± 2.5 ∗0.014) min−1 with 99%confidence
which shows that the uncertainty of k is in the second decimal place and is of order
0.03 min−1 with 95% confidence or 0.04 min−1 with 99% confidence. Therefore, it
is more appropriate to describe the kinetic parameter in the form:
k = (0.14 ± 0.03) with 95%confidence
k = (0.14 ± 0.04) with 99%confidence
As one can see in Equation (5.49), the estimation of parameter uncertainties can
be quite laborious, although very important for practical reasons, as these parameters
are expected to be used for design of large reaction vessels. Therefore, the accuracy and
precision of the reactor design depends on the quality of available kinetic parameters,
justifying all efforts made to evaluate the precision of the obtained parameter. How-
ever, derivation and use of Equation (5.49) in real problems can be infeasible, given
the large number of variables involved, the nature of the mathematical functions that
transform the measured variables into the model parameters and the fact that measure-
ments can be correlated to each other and sufficiently large to render the differential
procedure useless. In these cases, the combination of parameter estimation procedures
and stochastic simulation tools can provide much simpler numerical strategies for
computation of parameter uncertainties, as described in detail in Chapter 11.
In order to illustrate how a stochastic procedure can be used to evaluate the pre-
cision of the calculated parameters, let us assume that Equations (5.44) and (5.45)
should be combined to generate the kinetic parameter k, by assuming that experimental
measurements are allowed to vary in the form:
P0 = 4 + (random() −0.5)

12s2

where the function random of the Excel spreadsheet provides random numbers uni-
formly distributed in the interval [0,1]. The radicand term is used to correct the variance
of the simulated data, as the variance of the uniform distribution is equal to 1/12. The
following procedure is then repeated 1000 times: (i) random numbers are generated;
(ii) values of P0, P and t are calculated; (iii) k is calculated and saved. Finally, the aver-
age value of k and respective sample variance are calculated as usual and described
in Equations (1.9.1) and (1.9.2) of Section 1.9. These numerical tasks can be easily
performed in a standard spreadsheet. The obtained results for one realization were
k = 0.139 min−1, s2
k = 2.14 × 10−4 min−2 and sk = 0.015 min−1, which were very simi-
lar to the results obtained previously. Based on the uniform distribution and discarding
the 2.5% (25) smallest values of k and 2.5% (25) largest values of k values of k, to
respect the confidence level of 95%, it was possible to obtain:
0.114 < k = 0.139 < 0.167 min−1 with 95% confidence
One must observe that the confidence interval of the kinetic parameter calculated
with the stochastic procedure was not symmetrical, as predicted by the normal assump-
tion, because of the many nonlinear transformations of the measured variables that
were needed to generate the value of k. Based on the uniform distribution and discard-
ing the 0.5% (5) smallest values of k and 0.5% (5) largest values of k to respect the
confidence level of 99%, it was possible to obtain:
0.110 < k = 0.139 < 0.172 min−1 with 99% confidence
As the uncertainty of the kinetic parameter is located in the second decimal place,
it is better to write:
0.11 < k = 0.14 < 0.17 min−1 with 95% confidence
0.11 < k = 0.14 < 0.17 min−1 with 99% confidence
which are very similar to the ones calculated previously, although the confidence inter-
vals were a bit larger when the normal assumption was used because the normal
distribution admits that measurements can be infinitely large, whereas the uniform
distribution admits the existence of well-defined boundaries for maximum allowed
fluctuations.
5.7
REPARAMETERIZATION OF POWER-LAW RATE EQUATIONS
Existence of high correlations among the parameter estimates of a mathematical model
can cause significant numerical problems during estimation of model parameters (as
discussed in detail in Chapter 11), since minimization of the objective function may
become inefficient (Espie and Macchietto, 1988) and the statistical characterization
of the final parameter estimates may lack significance (Watts, 1994). For example,
some of these difficulties can be observed during estimation of parameters of power-
law rate equations, utilized throughout Chapter 5, because of the usually very high

106
Chemical reaction engineering
correlations among the obtained parameter estimates. As discussed in the previous
sections, power-law rate equations are commonly used in kinetic problems to describe
rate expressions and equilibrium conditions. Some examples are the Freundlich equa-
tion, used to describe adsorption of gases and liquids onto solid surfaces (Guo et al.,
2006), and the well-known nth-order reaction rate models:
y = kxn
(5.7.1)
where x and y are the independent and the dependent measured variables, and k and n
are two power-law model parameters. The correlation between the parameter estimates
for k and n are usually very high because they exert similar effects over y, which tends
to increase with x when either k or n are increased. In order to minimize the correlation
between the two parameter estimates, Equation (5.7.1) can be rewritten in the forms
(Schwaab and Pinto, 2008):
y = kref
 x
xref
n
(5.7.2)
y = exp

Aref + n ln
 x

(5.7.3)
where xref is the reference variable. One must observe that model responses are
not affected by reparameterization, since inclusion of the reference variable leads to
redefinition of the model parameters, kref and Aref , as:
kref = kxn

(5.7.4)

(5.7.6)
It is important to note that Equation (5.7.6) depends only on the available exper-
imental data and can be computed before the estimation of the model parameters,
as also discussed previously for the Arrhenius equation in Section 3.3.3. Besides, after
determination of parameters Aref and n, the kinetic parameter k can be easily computed
in the form:
k = eAref

ref
.
(5.7.7)
The introduction of the reference variable xref into the power-law rate equa-
tion allows for elimination of the parameter correlation and, consequently, for
reduction of the computational effort required for estimation of model parameters

(Espie and Macchietto, 1988; Schwaab and Pinto, 2008). Particularly, Schwaab and
Pinto (2008) showed that the introduction of the reference variable can simultaneously
improve the precision of parameter estimates. For this reason, in the following sec-
tions the reparametrized form of the power-law rate equation will be used frequently
for quantitative analyses of kinetic data.

SIMPLE REACTIONS IN SERIES
Consider here the simplest irreversible and first-order reactions. If the reaction is
consecutive or in series of the type:
A
k1
−−−−→R
k2
−−−−→S

110
Chemical reaction engineering
The corresponding rates for each component in a system at constant volume are:
−dCA
dt = k1CA
(6.1)
dCR
dt = k1CA −k2CR
(6.2)
dCS
dt = k2CR
(6.3)
Considering that in the beginning of the reaction there is only pure reactant, we
have:
CA + CR + CS = CA0
(6.4)
Defining new variables:
ϕA = CA
CA0
(6.5)
and analogously ϕR and ϕS, the initial concentration CA0 is always used as a reference.
Making the time dimensionless (θ = k1t) and substituting these new variables into
Equations 6.1 and 6.4, we obtain the following solutions:
ϕA = e−θ
(6.6)
ϕR =

(κ −1)[e−θ −e−χθ]
(6.7)
ϕS = 1 +

Considering that

where χ is a parameter of the specific rate.
By solving Equations 6.6–6.8, we obtain ϕA, ϕR, and ϕS as a function of θ and
hence the concentrations of each component as a function of the time, represented by
the kinetic curves shown in Figure 6.1. The curves show that the concentration profile
of A decreases exponentially, and A totally disappears when θ →∞. On the other
hand, the concentration of R increases initially and then decreases, since R will be
formed over time and transformed into S. Note that the curve of R shows a maximum
and depends on the parameter χ, relating the specific rates of the reactions. The time
corresponding to this concentration can be determined as follows:
dCR
dt = 0
or
dϕR
dθ = 0

Differentiating Equation 6.7, we obtain:

(κ −1)[χ e−χθ −e−θ] = 0
(6.10)
Consequently, we can determine the time corresponding to this maximum, i.e.:
θmax =
ln χ
(χ −1)
(6.11)
Substituting θmax into Equation 6.7, we obtain the maximum concentration of R:
ϕR max = exp(−χθmax)
(6.12)
Substituting θmax (Equation 6.11) into Equation 6.12, we finally obtain:
ϕR max = χ[χ/(1−χ)]
(6.13)
or
CR max
CA0
= χ[χ/(1−χ)]
(6.14)
Observe that ϕRmax or the maximum concentration of the intermediate CRmax
changes, when the parameter χ is varied. This means that if the specific rate k2 of

112
Chemical reaction engineering
reaction is higher than the specific rate k1of formation of R( · ), the maximum concen-
tration of the intermediate product R and the corresponding time tmax decrease. Figure
6.1b shows the behavior of the concentration of R as a function of χ.
We can experimentally determine the specific rates of the two reaction steps
through the kinetic curves. Upon reaching the maximum concentration of R (CR max)
and the corresponding time tmax, the parameter χ is calculated through Equation 6.13
or 6.14. Returning to Equation 6.11, θmax is calculated. By the definition of θmax = k1t,
the specific rate k1 is directly determined. Knowing χ, the specific rate k2 is calculated.

From Equation 6.13, we have:

θmax = 2.23
Consequently, the reaction rate constants are determined as:
k1 = 1.0 min−1
k2 = 0.15 min−1
6.2
SIMPLE PARALLEL REACTIONS
The parallel reactions occur when the initial reactants make part of more than one
reaction. The reactant A is transformed into several different products.
When there is only a transformation of reactants into products through two
irreversible first-order reactions, we obtain:

(6.16)
whose rates are, respectively:

(6.17)

(6.18)
rS = k2CA
(6.19)
If the reactions occur in gas or liquid phase at constant volume or in a batch
reaction, we have:
−dCA

(6.20)
dCR
dt = k1CA
(6.21)

dt = k2CA
(6.22)

Chemical reaction engineering
Using the same variables defined previously (Equation 6.5) and solving the
equation, we obtain the following solutions:
CS = χCR
(6.23)
and
−ln ϕA = −ln CA
CA0
= (1 + χ)k1t
(6.24)
where
χ = k2
k1
From Equations 6.23 and 6.24, we can directly obtain the values of χ and k1 as
shown in Figure 6.2.
Figure 6.2 shows the influence of χ on the concentration of each component. For
small values of χ, the specific rate k1 is higher than k2, i.e., the transformation of
reaction A
k1
−→R is faster than that of A
k2
−→S. Consequently, the concentration of R
is much higher than that of S, since the reaction slows down the process and thus
is the controlling step. By increasing the value of χ, the transformation of reaction
A
k2
−→S is faster than that of A
k1
−→R. Therefore, the accumulation of S, as well as its
concentration, is much higher than the concentration of the product R. Note also that
the concentration of A decreases rapidly.
The experimental data of concentrations as a function of the time are used to
calculate the specific rates k1 and k2. χ can be directly determined through the con-
centrations of the products R and S (if known) or through the angular coefficient of
Figure CS versus CR. On the other hand, the specific rate k1 can be determined by using
Equation 6.24 or through the angular coefficient according to Figure 6.2. Knowing k1
and χ allows for determination of k2.

CONTINUOUS SYSTEMS
In most cases, a continuous reactor is used and the reactions are carried out in gas
phase. Under these conditions, volume change may occur due to expansion or con-
traction of volume. Analogously, we can use the integral or differential methods. For
the determination of kinetic parameters, a differential reactor is used.
Consider two gas-phase reactions of the type:
A
k1
−−−−→R + S
(6.25)
A
k1
−−−−→2T
(6.26)
The rates are, respectively:
(−rA) = k1CA + k2CA
(6.27)
rR = k1CA
rT = k2CA
(6.28)
Defining the conversion XA1 of the first reaction and XA2 of the second reaction,
we obtain the corresponding molar fluxes:
FR = FA0XA1
(6.29)
FS = FA0XA1
(6.30)
FA = FA0 −FA0XA1 −FA0XA2
(6.31)
The total molar flow will be:
FA = FA0 + (1 −2XA)
(6.32)
Knowing that
CA = FA
v
(6.33)
where v is the volumetric flow (L/h) in which the volume variation ε is considered.
Therefore:
CA = FA
v =
FA0(1 −2XA)
v0(1 + εA1(XA1 + εA2XA2) + εA2XA2)
(6.34)
Thus, the corresponding rates in Equations 6.27 and 6.28 are transformed into:
rR = k1
FA0(1 −2XA)
v0(1 + εA1XA1 + εA2XA2)
(6.35)
rT = k2
FA0(1 −2XA1)
v0(1 + εA1XA1 + εA2XA2)
(6.36)

118
Chemical reaction engineering
The rates in a differential reactor in relation to R and T are:
dFR
dV = rR
(6.37)
dFT
dV = rT
(6.38)
Substituting the rates rRand rT in Equations 6.37 and 6.38 and considering that:
dFR = FA0 dXA1
(6.39)
dFT = 2FA0 dXA2
(6.40)
Two differential equations are obtained.
In the differential reactor, the experimental rates are determined directly.
In the integral reactor, the system is solved by integrating the expressions above
and determining the kinetic curve of the conversions as a function of the space time.

The reaction was conducted in a tubular reactor at 673◦C. m-X was introduced
with 25% of inert, with a concentration of 0.05 mol/L and flux of 2.4 L/min. The
reactor has a volume of 1 mL. In the outlet, the measured molar flux of p-X was equal
to 0.077 mol/L. Calculate the specific reaction rates.

From the reactions, we can see that εA2 = 0. So the value of εA1 should be calculated,

Thus:
XA2 = 0.64
and

KINETICS OF COMPLEX REACTIONS
The irreversible and reversible complex or multiple reactions have a different behavior
and as such cannot be solved by simple integral methods. In most cases, numerical
methods are employed. These reactions can occur in series, parallel, or a combination
of both. The goal is to determine the rate constants for reactions of any order. Although
the order of these reactions is not integer, we can assume that it is entire in the different
steps. In such cases, an analytical solution can be obtained. The most complex solutions
of generic order will not be studied in this chapter. Consider the three cases as follows.
6.4.1
Decomposition reactions

−−−−→P1
k2

Consider Pn as a final polymeric product and k1, k2, and kn are unknown.
The rates are, respectively:
−dCA

(6.44)

(6.46)
Defining the new variables:
ϕA = CA
CA0
(6.47)
And, analogously, always considering the initial concentrationCA0 as a reference,
the dimensionless time (θ = k1t) should be used in this case. Substituting these new
variables and considering the boundary condition that in the beginning of the reaction
there is only pure reactant, we obtain the following integrated solutions:
ϕA = e−θ
(6.48)
ϕP1 =

(κ1 −1)[e−θ −e−κθ]
(6.49)
and
ϕP2

(6.50)
where:

where κi is the measurement parameter of the rates of transformation in each step.

The solutions for these systems show that there are maxims for P1 and P2 and the
corresponding maximum times, θ1 and θ2, which can be obtained by differentiating
the rates and making them zero. We then obtain:
θP1 max =
ln κ1
(κ1 −1)
(6.52)
θP2 max =
ln κn
κ1
(κn −κ1)
(6.53)
Therefore, if the experimental values of the concentrations P1 and P2 are known,
the corresponding values of ϕP1 max and ϕP2 max are determined and the values of κ1 and
κ2 are calculated. Consequently, the values of θP1 max and θP2 max and finally the con-
stants are determined. Note that the maximum values depend on the relation between
the reaction rate constants and therefore on the values of κ2 and κ1, according to
Table 6.1.
The results show that if k2 > k1, as in the first case, the maximum concentration
of P2 is lower, indicating that the transformation of P2 is fast and that the limiting
step of the reaction is the transformation of P1 into P2. In the second case, both
steps are limiting and the transformation of A into P1 is the only fast step. The time
that corresponds to the maximum concentration depends on the reaction rates in the
different steps.
6.4.2
Parallel reactions

A + B2 →P2
Consider that P1 and P2 are the final products and that the constants k1, k2 are
unknown.
The corresponding rates are:

Chemical reaction engineering
By making dimensionless, dividing and integrating Equations 6.56 and 6.57, we
obtain:
ϕA = (1 −N) + ϕB2 + (R/κ1) ln(ϕB2/N)
(6.59)
where:
κ1 = k2

To determine κ1, we can use Equation 6.59 from the product concentrations P2

CB2 = NϕP2
With this relation, we can express the above equation as a function of: ϕP1.
Considering θ = k1t and knowing the concentration of the products P1 and P2, we
can determine κ1. The constant k1 can be determined by Equation 6.61.

E6.4 Consider a reaction of the type in dilute solution. The concentrations of the

The data allow us to calculate κ through Equation 6.60.
The concentration of [P2] for t →∞will be in the dimensionless form as follows:

Thus, by using Equation 6.60:

using the integral method will be shown here. This is the easiest way to identify the
kinetic parameters involved and indicate a general solving method for complex reac-
tions of this type, although the numerical solution is more appropriate. We should start
from a batch system (constant volume), whose equations for the rates of reactants and

Considering that:

(6.66)
Since for each molecule of P1 a molecule of B is consumed and for each molecule
of P2 two molecules are consumed and so on, the global balance for B will be:
CB + CP1 + 2CP2 + · · · + (n −1)CPn−1 + nCPn = CB0
(6.67)
Using the same dimensionless variables defined previously, ie, ϕA = CA

etc.
A generic parameter is also defined for the relation between the rate constants, i.e.:
κi = ki

where i = 1, 2, . . . , n −1.

Knowing the concentration ϕPi as a function of the concentration of the component

where C is a constant. Therefore, to determine the reaction rate constants, we proceed
as in the case for reactions in series, in which the concentration of Pi increases, reaches
a maximum and afterward decreases. From the condition of maximum concentration,
ϕPi+1 is differentiated and equaled to zero.
For P1, the maximum concentration will be:
ϕP max = κ1

We observe that ϕPi max depends on the relation between the reaction rate constants

Knowing the experimental values of CA, CPi as a function of the time tmax, we
can separately calculate ϕP max and consequently the rate constants. To determine the
reaction time t, we should start from Equation 6.68 and substitute ϑB as a function of
ϕPi. We finally obtain:
τ =

In this expression, we only have the distribution of the reactant A as a function of
the other components.

Chapter 7
Non-elementary reactions
Nonelementary reactions can be identified when the order of reaction rate does not
match the stoichiometry of the reaction. An apparent elementary reaction does not
show the actual mechanism that may involve several intermediate reactions, which
in turn are elementary reactions. The overall reaction can have different intermediate
mechanisms. To understand the kinetics of this reaction is necessary to know the
intermediate steps, and, consequently, indicate which of these steps are crucial to the
overall process.
There are several classical examples:
1.
2NO + 2H2 →N2 + 2H2O
The kinetics is:
rN2 = k[NO]2[H2]
where [. . .] represents the concentrations of the component.
2.
H2 + Br2 ↔2HBr
The kinetics is:
rHBr = k[H2] [Br2]n [HBr]m
where n and m are not integer and, therefore, do not match the stoichiometry of
the reaction.
3.
N2 + 3H2 ↔2NH3
The kinetics is:
rNH3 = k[N2][H2]n[NH3]m
If the exponents are not an integer and does not match the stoichiometry of the reaction.
What is the explanation? Stable molecules hardly react, only when they form free
radicals, carbenes or complex intermediates, ions, or valences. These very reactive
species combine easily with molecules or other intermediate species, reacting in suc-
cessive or parallel steps. These intermediate mechanisms should be known to determine
the reaction kinetics. This proves that the overall reaction rate constant is not always
true but includes several other constants relative to different intermediate steps of the
mechanism.

128
Chemical reaction engineering
These constants depend on the energy barrier or activation energy. Each step of
the mechanism has a different energy barrier. The higher the energy barrier, the more
difficult the particular step occurs. This implies that the energy involved in the process is
determinant to the reaction mechanism. The activation energy of the overall reaction is
not an average of the energies of each step, but a summation of all the energies involved.
For an initial analysis, we present some general hypothesis to deduce a kinetic model
of a nonelementary reaction.
Hypothesis
(a)
All steps are assumed to be elementary and irreversible.
(b)
One of the steps in slow and, therefore, determinant.
(c)
The concentration of the intermediate is very low, since your formation and
decomposition are very fast (close to 10−9 s).
(d)
The resulting rate of the intermediate is very fast and, in this case, we assume a
pseudo-equilibrium state.
(e)
The resulting rate of the intermediate species is the sum of the intermediate rates,
i.e.:
rj =
n

1
rji
(7.1)
where j in the intermediate species and i is the reaction of the intermediate step of the
global mechanism.
We can also demonstrate that the resulting rate is composed by several series and
parallel intermediate steps, analogous to the resistivity:
rj =
1
(1/r1 + 1/r2 + · · · + 1/ri + · · ·)
(7.2)
If either step is slow, the resulting rate is equal to the rate of this slow step, i.e.:
rj = rRLS
(7.3)
A pseudo-equilibrium state is defined when the resulting rate of the intermediate
species is zero, i.e.:
rj = 0
(7.4)
To compose a reaction mechanism involving intermediate species is necessary to
know some general rules:
(a)
Establish the mechanism with all possible intermediate reactions, composed by
elementary steps.
(b)
Know the electronic and atomic structure.
(c)
Identify the products and intermediates.
(d)
The intermediates are highly reactive.
(e)
Know the chemistry of the intermediate steps.

Non-elementary reactions
129
Consider the classic case as follows:
The reaction:
2NO + 2H2 →N2 + 2H2O
(a)
The observed rate was:
rN2 = k1[NO]2 [H2]
(b)
where the symbol [Ij] represents the concentration of the component Ij.
Note that the reaction does not match the stoichiometry, and, therefore, we have
a non-elementary reaction.
There are two mechanisms:
1.
2NO + H2
k1
−−−−→N2 + H2O2 slow step
H2O2 + H2
k2
−−−−→H2O
(c)
2.
2NO ←

(d)
N2O2 + H2 ←
k5
−−−−→N2 + H2O2
slow step
(e)
H2O2 + H2 ←
k6
−−−−→2H2O
(f)
For the mechanism (1), the slow reaction is the one and, therefore, determinant
step (c). Thus, by hypothesis, the resulting rate is equal to the limiting reaction rate:
rN2 = k1[NO]2[H2]
(g)
This rate is in line with the observed rate (b).
For the mechanism (2), the limiting reaction is the second one (e) and, therefore:
rN2 = k5[N2O2][H2]
⇓
unknown
(h)
An intermediate compound that appears in the reactions (e) and (f) is formed.
The resulting rate of this intermediate is unknown, but by the hypothesis of pseudo-
equilibrium should be zero. Therefore:
rN2O2 = k3[NO]2 −k4[N2O2] −k5[N2O2][H2] = 0
Thus:
[N2O2] =
k3
(k4 + k5[H2])[NO]2
rN2 =
k3k5
(k4 + k5[H2])[NO]2[H2]
(i)

130
Chemical reaction engineering
Substituting (i) into (h), we have:
rN2 =
k3k5
(k4 + k5[H2])[NO]2[H2]
(j)
The constant k5 of the slow step is compared with the constant k4. In this case,
we assume that k5 < k4 and k5 is neglected. In these conditions, the rate (Equation j)
is simplified to:
rN2 = k3k5
k4
[NO]2[H2]
(k)
This rate coincides with the observed rate (b). However, in this case, the reaction
rate constant includes the constants of all intermediate steps.
7.1
CLASSICAL KINETIC MODEL
Based on the classical kinetic theory and focusing on the previous example, it is possible
to foresee a reaction mechanism for activated molecules.
It consists of three steps. In the first one, a collision of molecules occurs to an
energy level that allows the formation an activated molecule activated A∗. In turn, this
molecule does not have enough energy to be transformed into product and therefore
loses energy and is decomposed to the original molecule. This process is known as the
deactivation step of the activated intermediate molecule. Finally, part of these activated
molecules acquires enough energy to be transformed into product or be decomposed
into one or more products, undergoing a chemical reaction. The molecules surpassed
the kinetic energy barrier to react or be transformed into product. Summarizing we
have:
1.
Activation of the molecules:
A + A
k1
−−−−−→A + A∗
(7.5)
whose rate relative to the activated molecule is represented by:
rA∗= k1[A]2
2.
Deactivation of the activated molecules:
A∗+ A
k2
−−−−−→A + A
(7.6)
The corresponding rate will be:
rA∗= k2[A∗][A]
3.
Transformation of the activated molecule:
A∗
k3
−−−−−→R + S
(7.7)

Non-elementary reactions
131
With the following formation rate of S:
rS = k3 [A∗]
(7.8)
As an example, we have the following overall reaction:
(CH3)2N2 →C6H6 + N2
Showing the following intermediate steps:
(CH3)2N2 + (CH3)2N2 →(CH3)2N2 + [(CH3)2N2]∗
(CH3)2N2 + [(CH3)2N2]∗→2(CH3)2N2
[(CH3)2N2]∗→[C3H6] + N2
To determine the rate of product (S or R) formation, according to Equation 7.8, it
is necessary to know the concentration of intermediate species A∗. Thus, the resulting
rate of A∗will be equal to the sum of the rates in each intermediate reaction and, by
the hypothesis of pseudo-equilibrium state, will be zero:
rA∗= k1 [A]2 −k2 [A∗] [A] −k3 [A∗] = 0
Therefore:
[A∗] =
k1 [A]2

k3 + k2 [A]

(7.9)
Substituting this expression into Equation 7.8, we obtain the formation rate of the
product S, i.e.:
rS =
k1k3 [A]2

k3 + k2 [A]

(7.10)
This expression is equal to the equation of the rate (k), shown in the example
above.
The rate of formation of S can be simplified for certain conditions of concentra-
tions, as in the following cases:
(a)
If the concentration of [A] is low: k2 [A] ≪k3
Thus:
rs = k1[A]2
(7.11)
In this case, the reaction kinetics is of second order.
(b)
If the concentration of [A] is high: k3 ≪k2 [A].
Thus:
rS = k1k3
k2
[A]
(7.12)

132
Chemical reaction engineering
In this case, the reaction kinetics is of first order, with an apparent constant which
includes the three constants of the intermediate reactions.
Therefore, depending on the experimental conditions, the nonelementary reaction
can be represented by a simple kinetics of first or second order. Herewith, we have
apparent reaction rate constants.
For a wide concentration range, we should use the expression of the overall
rate (Equation 7.10). It is observed that if the concentration of [A] appears in the
denominator, it is accompanied by constant k2, indicating that this species is deac-
tivated (intermediate) and that the molecules did not reach enough energy to be
transformed into product, returning to the initial state. On the other hand, if the
constant k3 appears both in the numerator and in the denominator, there was a
transformation of the intermediate species into the final product, indicating that part
of these species has reached a minimum energy level that which exceeds the energy
barrier.
7.2
CHAIN REACTIONS
In the beginning of the last century, Bodenstein observed that when the molecules of
H2 and Cl2 were subjected to absorption of one photon, they reacted to form HCl.
This reaction hardly occurs in the gas phase, since the energy required to transform the
reactants would be of the order of 200 KJ/mol. Nernst (1916), at the same time, also
explained that this is a chain reaction, in which radicals are initially formed and then
react with the molecules forming new radicals and subsequently forming products.
Bodenstein showed that with the absorption of one photon, it is possible to form 106
molecules of HCl and this would only be possible by lowering the energy barrier. The
following steps occur:
(a)
Initiation:
Cl2
hv
−−−−−→2Cl∗(radical)
(b)
Propagation:
Cl∗+ H2 →HCl + H∗
(radical)
H = 25 kJ/mol
H∗+ Cl2 →HCl + Cl∗
H = 13 kJ/mol
.......(cycle of 106 times)
(c)
Termination:
2Cl∗→Cl2
If we compare the energies needed to form HCl from the radicals with the total
energy required for the formation of HCl from Cl2 and H2 molecules, we found
that the first is much lower due to the high reactivity of radicals. The radicals are

Non-elementary reactions
133
unstable and readily combine with other radical or molecules due to their lower
energies.
7.3
THEORY OF THE TRANSITION STATE
To explain the kinetics of the mechanism of chain reactions, we use the theory of
the transition state. According to Eyring, Evans, and Polaniy, a transition state with
energy Eb is formed. In this case, there is only one degree of freedom corresponding
to the energy of vibration, due to the dissociation of the molecule. However, some
observations should be made and the following assumptions should be taken into
account :
According to the theory of Boltzman, there is a collision between molecules,
forming an intermediate state A∗with energy Eb.
If the molecule has energy lower than the energy barrier, it is deactivated and
returns to the initial state of the molecule A.
When the molecule exceeds the energy barrier, it does not return to original state.
The activated complexes are in equilibrium with the reactants, satisfying the Boltz-
man distribution. The movement of molecules causes an increase of energy and hence
an increase in temperature of the environment.
To overcome the energy barrier, several other independent products can be formed.
The mechanism can be represented as follows:
A ←
k2,k1
−−−−→A∗
k3
−−−−→R
(7.13)
Energetically, the following sequence of steps is represented:
(a)
Formation of radical:

In the initial state, there is a formation of radicals due to the collision of molecules
with energy E < Eb.
In the second stage, there is equilibrium between the molecules and the radicals
formed. The resulting rate in the equilibrium is zero. Therefore:
r = k1[A] −k2[A∗] = 0
Thus:
[A∗] = k1

[A] = K∗[A]
(7.14)

Where the equilibrium constant is:
K∗= k1
k2
Formation of the product:
rR = k3[A∗]
(7.15)
Substituting Equation 7.14 into Equation 7.15, we have:
rR = K∗k3[A]
Note that K∗is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, whereas k3 is a rate
constant. This rate constant can be calculated from theory of collisions and depends
on temperature, on the constants of Boltzman kB and of Planck hv, i.e.:
k3 = kBT
hν
(7.16)
From the thermodynamics, the equilibrium constant is given by:
K∗= K∗
0 e−G0/RT
(7.17)
Considering that:
G0 = H0 −TS0
(7.18)
Substituting this expression into Equation 7.17, we have:
K∗= K∗
0e−H0/RTe S0/R
(7.19)
In this case, the pre-exponential factor depends on the entropy of the system, i.e.:
K0 = K∗
0e S0/R
(7.20)
We define, therefore, a constant of the transition state: as:
kTST = kBT
hν
K0e −H0/RT
(7.21)
When compared with the Arrhenius equation :
kArr = k0e −E∗/RT
(7.22)
We can conclude that the activation energy E∗is equal to the energy of formation
of the activated intermediate state and, therefore, is lower than the energy barrier.
Herewith, the final state can be directly reached.

136
Chemical reaction engineering
Thus, the rate of formation of product R or S, expressed as a function of the
constant kTST will be:
rR = kTST[A]
(7.23)
This equation explains the kinetics from the point of view of the concept of
transition state.

(c)

Solution
The rate of formation of HBr will be:
rHBr = k3[H
∗][Br2] + k2[Br
∗][H2] −k2[HBr][H
∗]
(7.24)
If the concentrations of the radicals [H*] and [Br*] are unknown, the rates in
relation to the radicals are determined separately:
rH∗= k2[Br
∗][H2] −k′
2[HBr][H

(7.26)
Summing up the two expressions, we obtain:
[Br∗] =
k1
k4
1/2
[Br2]1/2
(7.27)

Non-elementary reactions
137
Substituting Equation 7.27 into Equation 7.25 and rearranging, we have:
[H∗] = k2[H2] · (k1/k4)1/2[Br2]1/2
k′
2[HBr] + k3[Br2]
(7.28)
Substituting Equations 7.28 and 7.27 into Equation 7.24 and solving, we obtain
the rate:
rHBr = 2k2k3(k1/k4)1/2[H2][Br2]3/2
k′
2[HBr] + k3[Br2]
(7.29)
Where
k∗= 2k2k3(k1/k4)1/2
Then, dividing by [Br2], we obtain the usual expression:
rHBr =
k∗[H2][Br2]3/2
k′
2[HBr] + k3[Br2]
(7.30)
Example
E7.2 The formation of HBr is not elementary, as seen in Equation 7.24. Moreover, the
rate expressed in Equation 7.30 was confirmed experimentally. However, in order to
check this expression, some experimental observations were taken into account. The
following experimental observations were made (adapted from Fogler):
1.
In the first experiment, it was observed that the rate is independent of the concen-
tration of [H2]. In this experiment, the concentrations of the other components
were kept constant.
2.
In the second series of experiments, two observations were made:
For low concentrations of [HBr], the rate is independent of its concentration.
When the concentration of [HBr] is high, the rate increases inversely with its
concentration.
3.
In the third series of experiments, two other observations were made:
For low concentration of [Br2] the rate varies proportionally to the concentra-
tion of [Br2]3/2.
If the concentrations]are high, the rate varies with the concentration of [Br2]1/2.
Verify the expression of the rate in Equation 7.30.
Solution
From the kinetic model, according to Equation 7.10 for each component separately,
we have:
rHBr =
k1k3[Aj]2
(k3 + k2[Aj])

138
Chemical reaction engineering
In relation to [H2]:
From experiment 1, we can say that the rate is directly proportional to [H2] or of
first order in relation to [H2].
In relation to Br2
From experiment 3 for low concentrations, the rate,r ≈[Br2]3/2 and therefore,
is in the numerator. For high concentrations, we can say from Equation 7.10 that
k3 ≪k2[Br2]. Thus, the resulting rate:
r ≈[Br2]3/2
[Br2]
≈[Br2]1/2
(7.31)
From experiments 1 and 3, the rate can be expressed as follows:
rHBr = k1k2[H2] [Br2]3/2
(k3 + k2[Br2])
(7.32)
In relation to [HBr], we have:
rHBr =
1
(k + k′ [HBr])
(7.33)
From experiment 2, if the concentration is low, then and the rate is independent of
its concentration. On the other hand, if the concentration of [HBr] is high, then and,
consequently, the rate is inversely proportional to its concentration, i.e.:
rHBr ≈
1
[HBr]
(7.34)
Gathering Equations 7.32 and 7.34, the following rate is obtained:
rHBr = k1k2[H2] [Br2]3/2
(k3[HBr] + k2[Br2]
(7.35)
Dividing by [Br2], we obtain the expression of the rate which confers to the one
deduced theoretically, i.e., Equation 7.30:
rHBr = k∗[H2] [Br2]1/2
k3 + k2
[HBr]
[Br2]
(7.36)
where k*, k2, and k3 are the values determined experimentally.

REACTIONS OF THERMAL CRACKING
These reactions are known in industrial processes and occur simply by decomposition
and in gas phase. However, it is a nonelementary chain reaction and occurs in different
elementary steps. For reactions such as thermal cracking in gas phase, there are several

Non-elementary reactions
139
kinetic models, but the most interesting one is the model of Rice–Herzfeld. The main
idea is that in the first step of the reaction, the abstraction of the H from the reactant
molecule occurs and subsequently there is decomposition with formation of a new
radical. The process takes place through the steps of initiation, propagation, and
termination.
(a) Initiation:

The most common radicals are CH∗

5, H∗, etc.
The corresponding rates are written:
(−rA) = k1[A] + k2[R∗
1][A]
Since the initiation rate is low, we can neglect the first term.
(−rA) = k2[R∗
1][A]
(7.37)
The corresponding rates to the radicals are, respectively:
rR∗
1 = 2k1[A] −k2[R∗
1][A] + k3[R∗
2] −k4[R∗

2] = 0
rR∗
2 = k2[R∗
1][A] −k3[R∗

2] = 0
(7.38)
Summing them up, we have:
[R∗
2] = k1[A]
k2[R∗
1]
(7.39)
Substituting Equation 7.36 into Equation 7.35, simplifying and considering that
the initial rate is low compared to the rates of propagation and termination, we obtain
the following expression:
[R∗
1]2 = k1k3
k2k4
(7.40)

Chemical reaction engineering
Substituting Equation 7.40 into Equation 7.37, we obtain:
(−rA) =

k1k2k3

[A]
(7.41)
The rate of conversion of A is of first order in relation to the concentration of [A],
but the reaction rate constant encompasses the four specific rates of the mechanism.
The apparent constant is determined experimentally, i.e.:
ka =

k1k2k3
k4
(7.42)
Note that the specific rates depend on the temperature and have their own
activation energies t, satisfying the Arrhenius equation, i.e.:
kj = k0 exp(−Ej/RT)
(7.43)
Thus, substituting Equation 7.43 into Equation 7.42 and taking the natural log
on both sides of the equation, we can obtain the apparent activation energy:
Ea = E1 + E2 + E3 −E4

(7.44)
The apparent frequency constant will be:

The corresponding rates to the radicals:

rCHO∗= k1[A] −k3[CHO∗][A] = 0
Summing up the two expressions, we obtain:
[CHO∗] = k1

Substituting into Equation 7.47, we have:
[CH∗

Substituting them into Equation 7.10 and neglecting the initiation term, we have:

Thus, the decomposition rate of acetaldehyde is of order 3/2. The rate constant
encompasses the specific rates of the reaction step.
The rate of formation of ethane will be:
rC2H6 = k4[CH∗
3]2
(7.51)
Substituting Equation 7.13, we obtain:
rC2H6 = 2k1[A]

i.e., is of first order in relation to A, where A = CH3CHO.


Chapter 8
Polymerization reactions
Polymerization reactions are of great industrial interest, and their advancement in the
last 50 years has been significant. Particularly, Ziegler and Natta created the most
important commercial polymerization reactions, starting from olefins and generating
oligomeric products with the formation of carbon chains of high molecular weight,
using Ti-based catalysts for this purpose. With these catalysts, polymers of varying
degrees of polymerization can be produced. The first important outcome is that prod-
ucts having a certain range of hydrocarbons can be obtained; to this end the catalyst
plays a crucial role. As a matter of fact, new catalysts that are highly selective to the
desired carbon range have already been developed.
In order to comprehend the behavior of most polymerization systems it is nec-
essary to know the kinetics of the polymerization reactions, which involves different
steps and are somewhat similar to that seen in nonelementary reactions. The kinetic
rate expressions depend on the mechanism of polymerization, which constitutes a fun-
damental chemical problem. For this reason, the composition and structure of the
different involved steps should be known. Once this mechanism is established, the
reaction kinetics and the involved reaction constants can be determined. And although
the polymerization reactions are nonelementary, they can be identified when the order
of the kinetic rate expression does not match the stoichiometry of the reaction itself.
As a whole, polymerization reactions are those that lead to manufacture of
macromolecular chains (or polymers). The small molecules that react to form the
polymer chains are usually called monomers, and the small segments that constitute
the macromolecular chains and that are derived from the monomers are referred to
simply as mers. Polymers can be found naturally in living tissues (such as proteins,
polysaccharides, DNA and RNA) or can be manufactured through many different
chemical mechanisms. Particularly, synthetic polymers can be obtained through chain
(or addition) polymerization (such as free radical, ionic and Ziegler–Natta) and step
polymerization (such as polycondensation). In chain polymerizations, the meric seg-
ments are inserted into the polymer backbone according to a one-by-one mechanism,
in the form
Pi + M→Pi+1
(8.1)

144
Chemical reaction engineering
where Pi represents a growing chain of size i, and M represents the monomer. On the
other hand, in step polymerizations the meric segments are inserted into the polymer
backbone in lumps, in the form:
Pi + Pj→Pi+j
(8.2)
Usually, chain reactions depend on the existence of an active species, normally pro-
vided by a catalyst or an initiating compound. On the other hand, step reactions are
normally dependent on the reactivity of organic functions, such as hydroxyl and car-
boxyl groups in the case of polyesters or amino groups and carboxyl groups in the case
of polyamides. Typical chain polymers are polyvinyl compounds, such as polystyrene,
polyethylene, polypropylene and poly(vinyl chloride), among others. Among typical
step polymers are polyesters (such as PET, poly(ethylene terephtalate)) and polyamides
(such as nylon). Additional information about polymer materials and detailed discus-
sion about chain and step polymerizations can be found in standard polymer text
books (Odian, 2004).
Importantly, the final macromolecular structure of the produced polymer material
can be quite complex. As it may not be possible to control the reactions described by
Equations (8.1) and (8.2), the produced chains can be of different sizes, leading to
products that present distinct molecular weight distributions and, therefore, distinct
properties. Additionally, when more than one monomer takes part in the reaction,
the polymerization is usually named copolymerization and the manufactured products
can present distinct copolymer compositions and composition distributions, since the
composition can change along the polymer chain. Further, different monomers can
form blocks of different sizes and lead to formation of chain branches (due to presence
of lateral chemical functions). Additionally, the molecular structure of the final prod-
uct depends not only on the chemical nature of the reacting monomers but also on
polymerization mechanism, polymerization process and reactor configuration, defin-
ing the end-use properties of the final product. More interestingly, in order to facilitate
the manipulation of the polymer material and the operation of the polymerization pro-
cess, heterogeneous polymerization processes are widely employed for production of
polymer particles (including emulsion, dispersion, precipitation and suspension poly-
merizations) (Dowding and Vincent, 2000). Each process has peculiar characteristics,
which allow for production of different resins with distinct properties, enabling dif-
ferent applications of the produced polymer materials. Manufacture of polymers in
dispersed media is almost always advantageous, because the viscosity of polymer solu-
tions grows exponentially with the average chain size, making infeasible the mixing
and pumping of these solutions under mild temperature conditions. On the other
hand, when these materials are dispersed in a heterogeneous medium, the viscosity of
the heterogeneous system approaches the viscosity of the continuous system, making
manipulation of the mixture much simpler.
For all the reasons discussed in the previous paragraphs, it is impossible to review
the entire field of polymerization in the present chapter, so the reader is encouraged
to consult specialized textbooks for detailed discussion about polymerization mech-
anisms, kinetics and processes (Odian, 2004). Still, the most fundamental points of
polymerization kinetics are described in the following sections, assuming that reactions
are performed in batch reactors and in solution, according to some relatively simple
kinetic mechanisms. Although the presentation here is somewhat restrictive, we believe

Polymerization reactions
145
it will be useful, introducing the reader to the wonderful world of polymerization
reactions.
8.1
FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF STEP POLYMERIZATIONS
Typical step polymerization reactions involve monomer molecules that present multiple
organic functions that can react with each other, such as the hydroxyl and carboxyl
groups that can react to produce an ester group and a short byproduct molecule (in this
case, water). Multiple chemical functionalities are needed to generate a macromolecule,
as chain growth implies that reaction must take place at both sides of the monomer
molecule. For instance, assuming that a monomer molecule contains two chemical
functions A and B that can react, the following mechanism can be proposed:
A −(R)i −B + A −(R)j −B↔A −(R)i+j −B + C
(8.3a)
Pi + Pj↔Pi+j + C
(8.3b)
where R represents a repetitive mer and C is a reaction byproduct. One must observe
that Equation (8.3) represents infinitely many reaction steps, as i and j can vary from 1
to infinity. Therefore, despite the simple representation of Equation (8.3), the polymer-
ization mechanism is indeed very complex! In addition, one should observe that typical
organic reactions are slow and reversible, which means both the direct polymerization
step and the inverse depolymerization reaction must be considered. This explains why
the byproduct molecule must be removed from the reaction vessel, so high monomer
conversions can be achieved. This also explains why step polycondensations are usu-
ally performed at high temperatures and under low pressures (vacuum conditions), to
enhance the reaction rates and the rates of removal of byproducts. These characteristics
are the reasons for the peculiar designs of the vessels used in polymerization reactions.
Based on the proposed reaction mechanism, it becomes possible to write the
following set of mass balance equations:

where kp represents the kinetic rate constant of polymerization (esterification) and kd
stands for the kinetic rate constant of depolymerization (hydrolysis). Many important
points regarding Equation (8.4) should be observed:
1.
Equation (8.4) describes an infinite set of coupled mass balance equations that
must be solved simultaneously, with i varying from 1 to infinity;
2.
The first term on the right-hand side of Equation (8.4) represents the formation
of chains of size i as a consequence of polymerization reactions between chains
with size smaller than i;

146
Chemical reaction engineering
3.
The first term on the right-hand side of Equation (8.4) is divided by 2 because of
the inherent symmetry of the proposed problem, as reactions between chains of
size k and i −k and between chains of size i −k and k are the same and should
not be counted twice;
4.
The second term on the right-hand side of Equation (8.4) represents the consump-
tion of chains of size i when they react with other chains to form new chains of
larger size;
5.
The third term on the right-hand side of Equation (8.4) represents the consump-
tion of chains of size i due to depolymerization;
6.
The third term on the right-hand side of Equation (8.4) is multiplied by (i – 1)
because chains of size i contain (i – 1) chemical groups that were the result of
polymerization reactions and therefore subject to depolymerization;
7.
The fourth term on the right-hand side of Equation (8.4) represents the formation
of chains of size i because of the depolymerization of larger chains;
8.
The fourth term on the right-hand side of Equation (8.4) is multiplied by 2/(k −1)
because only two of the (k– 1) chemical groups of a chain of size k > i can produce
a chain of size i after depolymerization;
9.
The volume V is explicitly represented in Equation (8.4) to remind the reader that
the density of the reaction system can change during the reaction course, leading
to volume changes that should not be neglected a priori.
For all the reasons presented above, the system of equations represented by Equa-
tion (8.4) does not present a closed analytical solution and should be solved almost
always with help of advanced numerical tools. In order to develop simple closed
solutions that can be used for analytical interpretation of the reaction effects, some
additional assumptions must be made. Initially, to avoid the necessary handling of
infinitely many mass balance equations, it may be necessary to monitor the evolu-
tion of the concentration of reactive chemical groups, which leads to the functional
modeling approach. In this case, Equation (8.3) can be represented in the form:
A + B↔AB + C
(8.5)
In this case, only four mass balance equations are needed to describe the course of
the reaction, in the form:

then:

Figure 8.1 illustrates the effect of the feed excess on the course of polymerization
for a particular set of conditions. It can be observed that the increase of F leads to
acceleration of the reaction rates, as one might already expect when A0 is kept constant.
As it might also be expected, the concentration of reactant A approaches zero as time
evolves, while the concentration of B approaches a value that depends on the feed
excess.

8.1.1 The most probable Schulz-Flory distribution
It must be observed that a significant amount of information is lost when the full set
of mass balance equations presented in Equation (8.4) is replaced by the functional

Polymerization reactions
149
balances presented in Equations (8.6–9). For instance, Equation (8.4) allows for the
calculation of the full molecular weight distribution of the produced polymer material,
whereas this is impossible with the functional model. For this reason, it becomes
necessary to perform a more involved analysis of the reacting system in order to provide
information about the quality of the material that is manufactured when the functional
approach is employed. Such an analysis was originally carried out by Wallace Carothers
and Paul J. Flory in some of the most fundamental publications of the field (Flory,
1936).
In order to comprehend Flory’s approach, it is initially necessary to recognize that
the number of molecules in the reacting system decreases continuously when the poly-
merization reaction takes place. As Equation (8.3) indicates, the number of reacting
species present in the reacting mixture is reduced by one unit when a reaction between
the chemical groups A and B take place, assuming that the condensate byproduct is
properly removed from the system. Therefore, it is possible to write that:
N0 =
M

i=1
Ni0 = A0 + B0
f
(8.22)
f =
M
i=1fiNi0
M
i=1Ni0
(8.23)
where N0 is the total number of molecules inside the reacting system at the beginning
of the reaction, M is the number of different chemical species that contain the reactive
chemical groups, Ni0 is the total number of molecules of the reactive chemical species i
at the beginning of the reaction, fi is the functionality of the chemical species i (number
of reactive functional groups of chemical species i) and f is the average functionality
of the system. Therefore, if a single reactive chemical species that contains the reactive
groups A and B is added to the mixture, then M= 1, f1 = 2 and f = 2. Assuming that
reactant A is the limiting one, whenever it is consumed in a polymerization step the
number of molecules decreases, so that:
Nt = N0 −(A0 −A)
(8.24)
where Nt is the number of molecules in the reacting system at time t. If the number
of molecules decreases, as the molecular segments remain the same inside the reaction
vessel, the average size (or mass) of the molecules must increase. As a matter of fact,
it becomes possible to write:
¯i = N0
Nt
=
N0
N0 −(A0 −A)
(8.25)
where ¯i is the average size of the molecules inside the reactor as a function of the
reaction time or of the conversion. Finally,

Chemical reaction engineering
which is a beautiful equation that clearly shows that the average size of the produced
polymer material is a function of the feed excess, of the average functionality of the
molecular species and of the conversion of the limiting species. In the ideal case, when
F = 0 and f = 2, then
¯i =
1
1 −x
(8.27)
which shows that the average molecular size increases with x and approaches infinity
as the conversion approaches the limiting value of 1. However, Equation (8.27) also
shows that molecular chain size grows very slowly with x in the beginning, reaching the
value of 10 (therefore, a mixture of short molecules, or oligomers) when the conversion
reaches the value of 90%. This reinforces the previous observation that condensate
byproducts must be removed from the reacting mixture to allow the preparation of
large molecules, as very large conversion values must be attained to produce long
polymer chains.
Example
E8.1 The average functionality of the feed mixture is rarely equal to 2 for many impor-
tant practical reasons. First, monomers cannot be produced with purity of 100% and
are often contaminated with compounds of different functionalities. Besides, as shown
in Equation (8.27), conversions must be too high to allow the production of large
molecules, which encourages the addition of multifunctional molecular species in the
initial reacting mixture to increase the value of f and allow the manufacture of large
molecules with lower conversion values. Besides, it may be necessary to compensate for
possible variations of F, as preparation of the feed mixture is subject to perturbations
due to the finite precision of actual equipment and the monomer feed can be impure.
For these reasons, Figures 8.2 and 8.3 show the effects of f and F on the average sizes
of produced polymer chains.

Polymerization reactions
151
Initially, Figure 8.2 shows that the feed excess exerts a highly deleterious effect
on produced chain size, leading to dramatic modification of the maximum attainable
molecular size and making the manufacture of large polymer chains more difficult.
As a matter of fact, when f = 2, the maximum attainable chain size predicted with
Equation (8.26) becomes equal to
¯imax = (2 + F)
F
which is equal to 201 when F = 0.01. This illustrates the enormous sensitivity of ¯imax
to variations of F.
On the other hand, Figure 8.3 shows that the increase of the average molecular
functionality leads to an increase of the average molecular chain sizes, as one might
already expect, since the molecules can grow in more than two directions. This can
indeed lead to formation of molecular chains of extremely large sizes at relatively low
conversion values, which can cause the formation of gel (polymer material that cannot
be dissolved in organic solvents). The formation of gel constitutes a major technological
problem in many polymerization systems, as is well discussed in many papers published
in the open literature (Nogueira et al., 2005). Particularly, the denominator of Equation
(8.26) becomes equal to zero when the conversion attains the gel point, as shown below:
xgel = 2 + F
f
Therefore, the gel point presents a physical significance whenever f > 2 + F and
xgel < 1.

Chemical reaction engineering
From a statistical point of view, if one assumes that all A chemical groups can
react with B chemical groups with equal probability, PA, then the following set of
probabilities, Pi, can be assigned to formation of chains of size i in the reacting system:
Pi = Pi−1
A (1 −PA)
(8.28)
as (i −1) bonds must be formed to produce a chain of size i. As a matter of fact,
Equation (8.28) does define a consistent set of probabilities, as:

which is simply equal to x when the ideal case is considered, with f = 2 and F = 0. Based

and f = 2 as a function of conversion. It must be observed that the distribution has
an exponential shape and is not symmetrical, thus making it meaningless to represent
polymer chain size distributions with the normal distribution.

FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF CHAIN POLYMERIZATIONS
Typical chain polymerization reactions involve monomer molecules that present unsat-
urated double bonds (vinyl groups) that can react with active species, including free-
radical species (free-radical polymerizations), metal complexes (as in Ziegler–Natta
polymerizations) or unstable ionic species (such as carbocations and carbanions in
ionic polymerizations). The sequential insertion of monomer molecules into the grow-
ing polymer chains characterizes this large set of distinct polymerization mechanisms,
in the form:
I −(R)i ∗+ M↔I −(R)i+1 ∗
(8.34a)
Pi + M↔Pi+1
(8.34b)
where I represents a fragment of the original active species, R represents a repetitive
mer and * describes the propagation of the chain activity after monomer insertion;
otherwise, polymer chains would not be formed. As discussed previously, one must
observe that Equation (8.34) represents infinitely many reaction steps, since i can
vary from 1 to infinity. Therefore, despite a very simple representation of Equation
(8.33), once more the polymerization mechanism is indeed complex! Unlike typical step
polymerizations, chain reactions are usually extremely fast and essentially irreversible,
making it possible to neglect the inverse depolymerization step in most practical cases.
This explains why chain polymerizations are usually performed at milder temperatures
than are most step polymerizations.
So, chain polymerizations can involve many reaction steps, including chain initia-
tion, chain propagation, chain termination and chain transfer to other chemical species
(Odian, 2004). For this reason, the most important reaction steps are presented in the
Sections 8.2.1–5.

154
Chemical reaction engineering
8.2.1
Initiation
Initiation consists in the formation of primary active species that can initiate the chain
polymerization reaction. Initiators can be provided by manufacturers as active species
(for instance, as active Ziegler–Natta catalysts) or they can be produced in situ during
the reaction (as in free-radical polymerizations). Therefore, the initiation step may be
absent in reactions that make use of previously prepared active compounds to initiate
the polymer chains. The interested reader should consult standard polymerization
textbooks for comprehensive presentation of the very large number of initiators used
commercially in polymerization technologies (Odian, 2004).
The most common families of initiators used to initiate polymerization reactions
are Ziegler–Natta complexes (frequently titanium complexes containing alkyl groups
and chlorine atoms, supported on inorganic materials such as silica and MgCl2)
and free-radical initiators (unstable compounds that are subject to homolysis when
excited thermally, magnetically, electromagnetically or through ultrasound, among
other sources of excitation). The commonest free-radical generators used commer-
cially are peroxides, such as benzoyl peroxide (BPO), and azo compounds, such as
azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN).
Initiation reactions can usually be described in the form:
I( + Cocat)→2R∗
(8.35)
R ∗+ M→P1∗
(8.36)
where P1 is a growing chain of size 1. Equation (8.35) indicates that a cocatalyst
can be eventually used to provoke the generation of the active species, as in redox
initiation mechanisms and Ziegler–Natta reactions (Odian, 2004). The active species
then initiates the polymer reaction through addition of a monomer molecule into the
polymer chain. When typical thermal initiation is performed, the use of a cocatalyst is
not necessary and it becomes possible to write:
dI
dt = −kdI
(8.37)
so that
I = I0e−kdt
(8.38)
where kd is the kinetic rate constant for the initiator decomposition. Equation (8.38)
describes the characteristic exponential decay of free-radical initiators(and of other
catalysts that are subject to deactivation or contamination). The half-life time (t1/2) of
the initiator is the time required for the initiator concentration to reach half the initial
concentration, which is equal to:
t1/2 = ln (2)
kd
(8.39)
Therefore, the half-life time of an initiating species is also a measure of the stability
of the analyzed species, decreasing with the increase of kd.

Polymerization reactions
155
The mass balance for the active species R∗can be written in the forms:
dR∗
dt = 2kd[I]V −k1[R∗][M]V
(8.40a)
dR∗
dt = −k1[R∗][M]V
(8.40b)
depending on whether the active species is generated in situ or fed in the active state. k1
is the kinetic rate constant for initiation. When radicals are generated in situ, the activ-
ity is usually so high that active species generate polymer chains almost immediately,
allowing the utilization of the quasi-steady state assumption in the form:
dR∗
dt ≈0⇒2kd[I]V = k1[R∗][M]V
(8.40c)
so that the rate of initiation can be assumed to be equal to the rate of generation of
active species.
8.2.2
Propagation
This certainly is the most important reaction step of all chain polymerization
mechanisms, because it describes the growth of the polymer chains.
P∗
i + M→P∗
i+1
(8.41)
As infinitely many reaction steps are represented simultaneously in Equation (8.41),
the rate equations related to the propagation step can be written in the form:
RpPi = kp[Pi−1][M]V −kp[Pi][M]V
(8.42)
RpM = −kp
 ∞

i=1
[Pi]
	
[M]V = −kp[PT][M]V
(8.43)
as chains of size i are formed through propagation of shorter chains and consumed
through reaction with the monomer, while monomer molecules can react with all
growing chains of all sizes. kp is the kinetic rate constant for propagation and represents
the total concentration of active growing chains in the reacting mixture. An important
assumption in Equations (8.42—43) is that the propagation rate constant does not
depend on the size of the growing species, a controversial idea that has been refuted
by many studies in the literature (Odian, 2004; Smith et al., 2005; Heuts and Russell,
2006). However, if kp is assumed to depend on the chain size, the number of kinetic
parameters can become too high to be of practical use.

156
Chemical reaction engineering
8.2.3 Termination
The termination step describes the loss of activity of the growing polymer chains
and leads to formation of inactive (or more commonly dead) polymer chains. Many
different reaction steps can lead to inactivation of the growing chains, as shown below:
Pi ∗+ Pj ∗→Di + D=
j
(8.44a)
Pi ∗+ Pj ∗→Di+j
(8.44b)
Pi ∗+ X→Di
(8.44c)
Pi ∗→Di
(8.44d)
Equation (8.44a) describes the termination by disproportionation and is usually
associated with the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from active species, leading to for-
mation of unsaturated dead chains (or macromers, which eventually can be involved in
other mechanistic steps and affect the chemical and thermal stability of the final mate-
rial). This termination mechanism is predominant in polymerizations of vinyl acetate
and methyl methacrylate and leads to dead chains that are similar to the growing active
chains. Equation (8.44b) describes termination by combination and is predominant in
free-radical styrene polymerizations, leading to dead chains that are larger than the
original growing chains. Equations (8.44c–d) describe termination steps provoked by
smaller molecules (usually a contaminant) and by spontaneous rearrangements of the
active center of the growing active chain, respectively, being predominant in ionic and
coordinated polymerizations of olefins.
The occurrence of termination steps necessarily causes the appearance of at least
one additional family of polymer molecules: the dead polymer chains. For this reason,
the kinetic modeling of this reacting system can become quite complex, requiring
detailed modeling of infinitely many reacting species of multiple families of polymer
chains. For these reasons, closed analytical solutions of the mass balance equations are
almost always unavailable. In spite of this, termination rate equations can be written
for the species Pi in the form:
RtPi = −ktd[Pi]
 ∞

k=1
[Pk]
	
V −ktc[Pi]
 ∞

k=1
[Pk]
	
V −ktX[Pi][X]V −kts[Pi]V
(8.45)

Polymerization reactions
157
where ktd, ktc, ktX and kts stand respectively for the rate constants for termination by
disproportionation, termination by combination, termination by X and spontaneous
termination. Similarly, for species Di and the rate equations become:
RtDi = ktd[Pi]
 ∞

(8.46)
RtD= = ktd[Pi]
 ∞

k=1
[Pk]
	
V
(8.47)
In some reaction mechanisms, the termination steps may be absent, leading to so
called living polymerization reactions (Odian, 2004). Besides, as discussed previously,
the proposed analysis relies on the assumption that termination rate constants do not
depend on the size of the growing species, an idea that also constitutes a controversial
subject and which also has been refuted by many studies in the literature (Odian,
2004; Smith et al., 2005; Heuts and Russell, 2006). However, if ktd, ktc, ktX and kts
are assumed to depend on the chain size, as said previously the number of kinetic
parameters can become too high to be of practical use.
8.2.4
CHAIN TRANSFER
Among the many parallel reaction steps that can occur during chain polymerizations,
chain transfer to other molecules are certainly the most important ones. The chain
transfer step describes the transfer of activity from the growing polymer chain to
another molecule, leading to formation of a dead polymer chain and a short active
species that reinitiates polymerization. Although this reaction step exerts little effect
on the overall rates of polymerization (as the number of active species is not changed),
it can significantly affect the quality of the obtained material (as it interrupts the growth
of a polymer chain), being of great importance at industrial sites for the manufacture
of distinct polymer grades with different properties. Chain transfer reactions can be
represented in the general form:
Pi ∗+ X→Di + P1∗
(8.48a)
Pi ∗→Di + R∗
(8.48b)
with rate equations given in the form:
RtrPi = −ktrX[Pi][X]V −ktrs[Pi]V
(8.49a)
RtrDi = ktrX[Pi][X]V + ktrs[Pi]V
(8.49b)
where ktrX and ktrs are kinetic rate constants for chain transfer to Xand spontaneous
chain transfer. Typical chain transfer agents (X) for free-radical polymerizations are
mercaptans and alcohols, while hydrogen is the most important chain transfer agent in
coordinated polymerizations. Besides, ionic and coordinated polymerizations are also

158
Chemical reaction engineering
subject to spontaneous chain transfer reactions. Monomer and polymer can also be
important chain transfer agents in many reacting systems. For instance, the monomer
vinyl chloride is a natural chain transfer agent in vinyl chloride polymerizations, while
poly(vinyl acetate) is an important chain transfer agent in vinyl acetate polymerizations.
Particularly, occurrence of chain transfer to polymer leads to formation of branched
macromolecules, with great impact on the final properties of the obtained materials.
8.2.5
QUASI-STEADY STATE BALANCES
When the active growing species is very active, produced in situ and subject to termi-
nation reactions, accumulation in the reacting mixture is not likely to occur. This is
exactly the case of the vast majority of the free-radical reaction mechanisms. In this
case, the sum of all reaction rates is expected to be very close to zero, allowing the
proposition of quasi-steady state balances in the form:
RpPi + RtPi + RtrPi = 0
(8.50)
If Equations (8.42), (8.45) and (8.49) are added, one can obtain the following quasi-
steady state balance equation:
kp[Pi−1][M]V −kp[Pi][M]V −ktd[Pi]
 ∞

k=1
[Pk]
	
V −ktc[Pi]
 ∞

k=1
[Pk]
	
V
−ktX[Pi][X]V −kts[Pi]V −ktrX[Pi][X]V −ktrs[Pi]V = 0
(8.51)
which can be written in the form
[Pi] = q[Pi−1]
(8.52)
q =
kp[M]
kp[M] +

ktd + ktc

[PT] +

ktX + ktrX

[X] +

kts + ktrs

(8.53)
q is normally named as the propagation probability, as it is a positive number
constrained in the interval [0,1] and represents the frequency ratio of the propagation
reaction, when compared to the remaining mechanistic steps. Equation (8.52) leads to
a very simple iterative equation, that can be written in the form:
[Pi] = qi−1[P1]
(8.54)
that indicates that the molecular weight distribution of growing polymer chains also
follows the Schulz—Flory distribution! It is amazing that the Schulz—Flory distribu-
tion appears in both the analyzed polymerization mechanisms by way of such different
reasonings. However, one should not be tempted to conclude that all polymerization
mechanisms lead to Schulz–Flory size distribution, although it is true that it appears
naturally in many different problems.

Polymerization reactions
159
Equation (8.54) is inadequate because it depends on [P1] and because Equation
(8.53) depends on [PT]. Therefore, it is necessary to provide closed solutions for these
two values. Initially, it is simple to show that:
[PT] =
∞

i=1
[Pi] = [P1]

i=1
qi−1 = [P1]
1 −q
(8.55)
so that
[Pi] =

1 −q

qi−1[PT]
(8.56)
Finally, if Equation (8.51) is summed for all values of i ranging from 1 to infinity,
one gets (and note the fact that when i= 1 some additional rate equations are needed
because of the mechanistic steps described in Equations (8.36) and (8.48)):
2kd[I] =

ktd + ktc

[PT]2 +

ktX + kts

[PT]
(8.57)

ktX + kts
2 + 8

ktd + ktc

kd[I]
4

ktd + ktc
2
(8.58)
Because ktX and kts are usually equal to zero in most free-radical polymerizations,
and since part of the active free-radical generated by the initiator are consumed in
lateral reactions with impurities, solvents and reactants, Equation (8.58) is usually
presented in the form:
[PT] =

2fIkd[I]
ktd + ktc
(8.59)
where fI is the initiator efficiency, a positive number in the interval [0,1], usually in
the interval [0.6, 0.8], that indicates the fraction of active species that actually initiate
growing polymer chains.
Finally, Equation (8.59) can be combined with Equation (8.43) in the form:
RpM = −kp

2fIkd[I]
ktd + ktc

(8.60)
to provide the rate of polymerization of free-radical polymerizations and other poly-
merization mechanisms that are subject to bimolecular terminations. In this case, it
becomes possible to write the monomer balance equation in the form:

It is important to observe that the rate of polymerization depends on many distinct

Based on Equation (8.54) it is possible to conclude that the average chain-length

∞
i=1[Pi] =
[PT]
(1−q)
[PT] =

1 −q

(8.66)
As q usually is very close to 1 (typically above 0.99), living chains are very large
from the very beginning of the reaction (conversion equal to zero), constituting a major
difference with respect to step polymerizations, as average molecular weights increase
with conversion in the last case and become large only when conversions are high.
8.3
DIFFUSIVE LIMITATIONS
The viscosity of the reacting mixture can become so high during polymerizations that
the diffusive movement of the chemical species, and particularly of the larger molecules,
can become limited, leading to significant reduction of reaction rates. As a matter of
fact, in most polymerization processes, all elementary reaction steps can be eventually
affected by diffusional limitations when the polymer concentration is high. Therefore,

Polymerization reactions
161
the increase of the medium viscosity caused by the increase of the polymer concen-
tration can greatly affect overall reaction rates and molecular structure of the final
material.
The gel effect (or Trommsdorff effect) occurs typically when monomer conversion
(or, more precisely, polymer concentration) reaches a range between 20 to 40 wt%
and the mobility of the longer chains is reduced by the high viscosity, leading to dras-
tic reduction of bimolecular termination rates, resulting in accumulation of growing
radicals and the auto-acceleration of the rate of polymerization (Odian, 2004). Par-
ticularly, the final properties of the produced polymer materials can be significantly
affected by this phenomenon. Moreover, this can also lead to production of resins
with broad MWDs and cause the sudden elevation of the reactor temperature and
development of thermal runaway conditions. (Hui and Hamielec, 1972; Pollaco et al.,
1996; Alexopoulos and Kiparissides, 2007). Additionally, the gel effect can induce
the development of relevant nonlinear behavior in the dynamics of free radical poly-
merizations, especially when the increasing viscosity also causes the reduction of the
effective heat transfer coefficient between the reactor walls and the coolant fluid in the
reactor jacket. This can lead to a significant decrease of the heat removal capacity of
the reactor, resulting in thermal runaway, development of self-sustained oscillations
and appearance of multiple steady states (Pinto, 1995; Pinto and Ray, 1995a, 1995b,
1996).
The glass effect occurs when the bimolecular reaction steps that involve small
molecules, such as the propagation and chain transfer steps, are also affected by the
increasing viscosity of the reaction medium, causing the subsequent reduction of the
reaction rates and average molecular weights of the formed chains. As in the previous
case, these phenomena lead to enlargement of the MWD and strongly affect the final
properties of the produced polymer. The glass effect occurs when the reaction tem-
perature is below the glass transition temperature of the polymer, usually at monomer
conversions (or, more precisely, polymer concentrations) above 80 wt%. The conse-
quence of this phenomenon is the “freezing’’ of the reaction mixture and attainment
of a maximum conversion limit.
Modeling of diffusional limitations in polymerization reactions still constitutes
a technical challenge and most of the models that have been published in this field
are empirical or semi-empirical, depending on model fitting to available experimental
data. The proposed models usually have the general form:
k = k0g(w)
(8.67)
tabulation k is a generic kinetic rate constant, k0 is the kinetic rate constant
when the polymer concentration is null and is an empirical or semi-empirical func-
tion that corrects the kinetic rate constant when the polymer concentration changes.
For instance, Freitas Filho et al. (1994) showed that the expression:
g(w) = (1 −w)γ
(8.68)
where γ is an adjustable parameter that characterizes a certain reaction step and poly-
merization system, might be used to fit many experimental data sets available in the
literature.

Chemical reaction engineering
8.4
DEPOLYMERIZATION
Although the assumption of irreversible reaction steps in most polymerization studies
is reasonable when temperatures are mild and condensate byproducts of step polymer-
izations are absent, the fact is that this assumption can be bad when temperatures are
high and condensate products are present in the reaction medium. For this reason, it is
useful to define the ceiling temperature as the temperature when rates of polymeriza-
tion and depolymerization are equal at typical polymerization conditions, preventing
the growth of the polymer chains. In this case:
G = H −TcS = 0⇒Tc = H
S
(8.69)
As the polymerization reaction is usually quite exothermic and leads to significant
reduction of entropy (as molecules get bonded in the macromolecular chain), Tc values
are generally high, above 200 ◦C. Despite this, some exceptions include the well-known
polymerization of α-methyl styrene, whose ceiling temperature is close to 40 ◦C, posing
many technological challenges to performing polymerization under normal industrial
conditions (Odian, 2004).
Interest in depolymerization reactions has increased steadily over the years. This
interest has been boosted by the increasing worldwide production of plastic goods and
the necessity to develop environmentally correct technologies for management and
disposal of plastic wastes. Chemical recycling techniques constitute possible solutions
for recycling of plastic wastes, converting plastic wastes into raw materials that can
be used commercially in other industrial processes, reducing the potentially harmful
effects of discarded materials. The most popular route for chemical recycling of plastic
wastes is thermal degradation, which can be accomplished through pyrolysis, partial
oxidation or gasification. Essentially, when submitted to high temperatures, polymer
chains depolymerize (usually though free radical mechanisms) into lighter fractions,
like that which is performed in typical petrochemical processes. However, thermal
degradation of macromolecules can be significantly affected by the treated material.
For instance, thermal treatment of polyolefins produces hydrocarbons in the range of
gasoline, whereas poly(methyl methacrylate) decomposes almost completely into the
original monomer above 400◦C, offering an alternative for feedstock recycling (Braido
et al., 2018; Ros et al., 2019; Monteiro et al., 2019). Solvolysis and hydrolysis are
also popular chemical routes for depolymerization of step polymers, while enzymatic
enhancement of depolymerization mechanisms has evolved rapidly (Monteiro et al.,
2019).
Depolymerization reactions usually follow the random scission mechanism:
Di→Pk + Pi−k
(8.70a)
Di + C→Pk + Pi−k
(8.70b)
or the depropagation scheme:
Di→Di−1 + M
(8.71)

Polymerization reactions

although depolymerization mechanisms normally comprise many distinct parallel reac-
tions that take place simultaneously, leading to a broad mixture of products that must
be purified for end use, as is well-known in the oil industry.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this chapter, the fundamental aspects of typical polymerization reactions were pre-
sented. It was shown that step polymerization reactions can be described with help of
the functional modeling approach, revealing that the final properties of the produced
material are quite sensitive to modification of the feed composition and functional-
ity of the reacting monomers. Particularly, it was also shown that obtained polymer
materials are mixtures of chains of different sizes, following the Schulz–Flory size
distribution. It was also shown that chain polymerization reactions involve many dif-
ferent chemical species and reaction steps, although the adoption of the quasi-steady
state assumption, valid when the active growing chains are very reactive and subject
to termination, indicates that living polymer chains also follow the Schulz–Flory dis-
tribution. As the propagation probabilities of chain reactions usually are very close
to 1, living chains are very large from the very beginning of the chain polymeriza-
tion reaction, while average molecular weights increase slowly with conversion in step
polymerizations and become large only when conversions are high. Moreover, it was
shown that polymerization reactions can be subject to diffusive limitations, which can
significantly affect the course of the polymerization and the behavior of industrial
reactors. Finally, it was discussed that depolymerization reaction steps can be very
important when temperatures are high or condensate products are present, an idea
that has been explored in the chemical recycling of plastic wastes.

Chemical reaction engineering
It is known that the reaction mechanism occurs in the following steps:
(a)
Dissociation of the inhibitor into radicals.
(b)
Addition of the monomer M to the radical.
(c)
Chain propagation of radicals.
(d)
Termination by addition of radicals.
Analyzing the data from the table, is it possible to propose a polymerization rate
of the monomer including the different stages of the process?
With the data presented in the table, is it possible to determine the apparent
reaction rate constant?
Solution
The problem data allow us to verify some of the reaction rate expressions derived
previously, assuming that the initiation rate varies little with time.
Analyzing the effect of initiator concentration on the rate, we see that:
1.
Choosing the same value of the concentration of M:
[M] (mol/m3)
[I2] (mol/m3)
(−rM) (mol/m3) s−1

0.130
From the first data set, we observe that for the same concentrations of [M],
when the initiator concentration drops 1.63 times, its square root decreases 1.27
times. This approximately corresponds to a decrease in the rate of 1.3 times. In the
second data set, we can see that when the initiator concentration is increased by
2.5 times, its square root increases by 1.57 times. This corresponds to an increase
in the rate of 1.49 times. These data show that the rate is directly proportional to
[I2]1/2. This in agreement with Equation (8.60), which can be written in the form:
(−rM) = kP[M]

γk0[I2]
kt
(8.72)
2.
Effect of the monomer concentration:
Choosing approximately the same concentration value of [I2], we observe how
the rate varies with the concentration [M].

In this example, for both cases, maintaining the same concentration of [I2], the
concentration of the monomer [M] is varied. In the first data set, the concentration
[M] increases by 2.1 times while the rate increases by 2.2 times. In the second data set,
the concentration of [M] decreases by 2.2 times and the rate also decreases by about
2.3 times. This shows that the rate is directly proportional to the concentration of [M],
as described in Equation (8.60).

Substituting the values
(−rM) = k∗[M]
(8.72)
Then, one can obtain:
k∗= 0.0213 s−1
Substituting the values of k* and [I2] into Equations (8.72) or (8.73), one can also
obtain:
ka = kP

E8.3 In the previous example, the values of the constants were calculated as:
k0 = 10−8 s−1
kp = 10−2 L/mol s−1
kt = 5.107 L/mol s−1

166
Chemical reaction engineering
It is then proposed to calculate the concentration of the monomer after 7.2 min,
starting from the following values and assuming that 1% of the initiator has been
consumed:
[M] (mol/m3)
[I2] (mol/m3)
(−rM) (mol/m3) s−1
9.04
0.235
0.193
Solution
Starting from Equation 8.64a or 8.72:

where
k∗= 2kP

2γk0[I20]
kt

Thus,
−ln M
M0
= 0.822
But
[M] = 3.97 (mol/m3)
And
XM = M0 −M
M0
Thus, the conversion is equal to 0.56 or 56%.

9.1
ENZYMATIC REACTIONS
The enzymatic reactions are of great interest and have great prospects for the future
of biotechnology. In general, the enzymatic processes are well known in the alcohol
fermentation and biological processes (e.g., physiology). The enzymatic fermenta-
tion processes can be promoted by microorganisms, such as bacteria and must, or
by enzymes which are produced chemically.
Generally, a fermentation process is represented by the transformation of organic
matter, which in the presence of enzymes or bacteria forms noble products of great
utility in food, pharmaceutical, and alcohol production industries.
The main types of enzymatic and fermentation reactions that occur are:
Soluble enzyme + insoluble substrate
Insoluble enzyme + soluble substrate
Soluble enzyme + soluble substrate
The reactions with both soluble enzyme and substrate occur in homogeneous liquid
phase in biological reactions, mainly used in the pharmaceutical industries. When the
enzymes are insoluble, the reactions are heterogeneous and the great advantage is that
these enzymes are not lost. In general, enzymes are anchored on solid materials with
high surface area and low pore volume. Insoluble substrates and soluble enzymes are
commonly used in the detergent industry.
Currently, biological reactions with animal cells are being studied. The kinetics
of these particular reactions is equally complex but also belongs to the same reaction
category.
The action of enzymes is also explained by the energies involved and by the tran-
sition state theory, as described before. Intermediate complexes are formed, which in
turn have lower energy barrier, thus allowing its transformation into products.
The kinetic model can be represented schematically following the same approach
as in Chapter 7, i.e.:
S + E
k2/k1
←→ES∗k3
−→P + E
(9.1)

168
Chemical reaction engineering
where
S = substrate (reactant)
E = enzyme
ES∗= enzymatic complex.
Note that the presence of water in these reactions is essential.
Equation 9.1 is represented by the following sequence:
(a)
Formation of the complex:
ES∗
(b)
Equilibrium state:
S + E
k2/k1

(9.2)
(c)
Decomposition of the complex into products:
ES∗(+H2O)
k3
−→P
(9.3)
ES∗(+H2O)
k4
−→S
Figure 9.1 shows the potential energy over the course of the reaction. Without
the enzymes, the energy barrier (or activation energy) is high and the complex ES∗
formed is unstable and quickly deactivates. This energy barrier is drastically reduced
in the presence of enzymes, facilitating the transformation of the complex ES∗into
final irreversible products P and S. This behavior is explained by the transition state
theory.
9.1.1
Kinetic model
The reaction rate relative to the substrate is obtained by Equation 9.1, i.e.:
(−rS) = k1[E][S] −k2[ES∗]
(9.4)
rP = k3[H2O][ES∗]
(9.5)
where [·] represents the concentration.
In relation to the complex ES∗, we also have:
rES∗= k1[E][S] −k2[ES∗] −k3[ES∗][H2O] = 0
(9.6)
However, not all enzymes are consumed and the complexed enzymes are partly
recovered. In this context, the free enzymes are those which participate in the initial
reaction. From the balance of enzymes, we have:
ET = E + ES∗
(9.7)

Figure 9.1 Different energy profiles involved in the enzymatic reactions.
From Equations 9.6 and 9.7, the concentrations of the complexed enzymes are
determined:
[ES∗] =
k1[ET][S]
k1[S] + k2 + k3[H2O]
(9.8)
Substituting Equation 9.8 into Equation 9.5 and considering that (−rs) = rp, we
have:
(−rS) =
k1k3[ET][S][H2O]
k1[S] + k2 + k3[H2O]
(9.9)
However, the amount of water is too large and its concentration practically does
not vary compared to the variation of substrate and enzyme concentrations. Therefore,
it is assumed that its concentration remains constant. Thus, we can also consider the
term k3[H2O] = constant = k∗
3
Thus:
(−rS) =
k1k∗
3[ET][S]
k1[S] + k2 + k∗
3
(9.10)

170
Chemical reaction engineering
The Michaelis constant is obtained by dividing the equation by k1:
KM = k2 + k∗
3
k1
(9.11)
tabulation the other hand, it is known that the maximum rate is obtained when all
enzymes are complexed. Therefore, by making:
Vmax = k∗
3[ET]
(9.12)
Substituting these new parameters in the Equation 9.10, we obtain:
(−rS) = Vmax[S]
[S] + KM
(9.13)
There are special cases that simplify the expression of the rate.
(a)
If the concentration of S is low, we can simplify the equation which expresses the
rate by considering that S ≪KM.
We then obtain a rate which is directly proportional to the substrate concentra-
tion, and a linear variation is observed, i.e.:
(−rS) = Vmax[S]
KM
(9.14)
(b)
If the substrate concentration is high, we obtain the inverse, and the equation
which expresses the rate can be simplified since KM ≪S. In this case, the rate of
disappearance of the substrate is equal to the maximum rate. Thus:
(−rS) = Vmax
(9.15)
(c)
It is very common to use the half-life method, assuming that half the maximum
rate is reached. This is extremely convenient, since the experiment can be stopped
after reaching the concentration corresponding to half of the maximum rate. By
adopting this method, we have:
(−rS) = Vmax
2
and substituting into Equation 9.13, we have:
KM = [S]1/2
(9.16)
The three cases can be seen in Figure 9.2.

9.1.2
Determination of the kinetic parameters
For determination of kinetic parameters, we use both the differential and integral
methods. In the integral method, the experimental rates are directly determined by
using small variations of the concentration. In the case of batch reactors, a strong
agitation of the reaction system should be conducted, avoiding problems of diffusion
and promoting a homogeneous mixture of the reaction system with no temperature
gradient. For low conversions, as we have seen, the rate is directly proportional to the
concentration of the substrate.
9.1.2.1
Differential method
In the differential method, Equation 9.13 is generally transformed in a more convenient
format, i.e.:
1
(−rS) =
KM
Vmax[S] +

Vmax
(9.17)
When placed on a graph (Figure 9.3), this expression gives a straight line, whose
slope can be used to determine the Michaelis constant.

9.1.2.2
Integral method
In the integral method, we start from the equation of the rate and the system is chosen.
The experiments are usually conducted in batch reactors, and, consequently, we use
the equation of the batch reactor (Equation 4.7) as a function of the substrate:
t = −

We can observe from Equation 9.22 that the rate of this reaction involves a zero-
order (first term) and first order (second term) kinetics. For longer times, it satisfies
the first order kinetics. On the other hand, for shorter times, the zero-order kinetics
predominates.

The angular coefficient is –0.56. Therefore, since [H2O2]0 = 0.02, we have:

The linear coefficient is equal to 0.018, therefore:
Vmax = 6.37 × 10−4 (mol/L) × min −1
If the enzymes are triplicated, we have:
Vmáx = k3ET = 3 × 6.37 × 10−4 = 1.911 × 10−3 (mol/L min)
Thus, the time necessary to reach a conversion (XS) of 0.95 will be:
t = 15 min
9.1.3
Effect of external inhibitors
Enzymes can be competitive and noncompetitive and affect the reaction rate. In certain
cases, they work as a blocker, which is advantageous in medicine. On the other hand,
it can significantly reduce the capacity of active enzymes.

176
Chemical reaction engineering
In the case of competitive enzymes, the substrate competes with the external
blocker in the same active enzyme. Therefore, it depends on the adsorption capacity
of active enzymes. In the opposite case, both the substrate and the external inhibitors
do not compete with the same activated enzyme and the capacity of the reaction will
depend on the adsorption strength in the active enzymes.
Note that the kinetic models are different but can be deduced in the same manner.
In the competitive model, we have the following system:

Kinetics of biological fermentation
In biological fermentation, the substrate is in contact with bacteria and therefore the
microorganisms grow. Living cells comprise a series of reactions of large application
in the health sector, such as insulin, antibiotics, and food production. In the processes
with biomass, there are cells which consume nutrients for energy generation and cell
growth.
The most common examples are:
Substrate (S) + Cell (C) →Cells (C) + Product (P)
[Fruits] + Bacteria →Bacteria + alcohol
[Organic matter] + Bacteria →[More bacteria] + [Product + CO2, H2O]
To monitor the growth of the cells or bacteria, we can use the graph displayed
in Figure 9.6, which shows the variation of cell concentration over time. This graph
shows the different phases that appear and disappear in a kinetic process.
1.
In phase I, there is an induction period in which the cells get adapted to the
culture medium. The function of this phase is to transfer nutrients (proteins) for
the cells, thus forming enzymes and new substrates and causing a multiplication

of new cells. This largely depends on several factors such as the reaction medium,
substrate concentration, and pH.
2.
In phase II, there is a period of cell growth. This means that there are enough
nutrients and cells enabling rapid cell growth.
3.
In phase III, there is a stable period and there are not enough nutrients for cell
growth. In this stage, equilibrium between the formation of cells and transport
of nutrients is established.
4.
In phase IV, a period of cells deactivation (death) occurs, since there are no more
nutrients. Products and subproducts are formed, and they can alter the properties
of the reaction medium, especially the pH, which may cause cell deactivation or
death.
The rate of cell growth practically follows the same expression of the rate, accord-
ing to Michaelis equation. However, we must also take into account the concentration
of cells, as follows:
rC = k[S][C]
[S] + KM
(9.32)
These constants must be determined. In most cases, empirical rates of cell growth
are used, and according to Monod equation, we have the following expression:
rC = µ[C]
(9.33)
where µ is an empirical coefficient and the unit is given in s−1, since the concentration
is measured in g/dm3. This coefficient was determined by Monod equation:
µ = µmax
[S]
[S] + KMonot
(9.34)
where:
KMon = Monod constant.
Thus:
rC = µmax
[S][C]
[S] + KMonot
(9.35)
Therefore, this is similar to the Michaelis equation.
There are several other empirical expressions, as the Moser equation:
rC = µmax
[C]
(1 + k[S]−λ)
(9.36)
where
k and λ are the empirical constants.

Mass balance
Note that the mass balance in the reactors should take into account the rates of living,
generated, and dead cells. Both in the batch reactor and in the CSTR, we have the
following expression in relation to cells mass flow:
[Ginlet] −[Goutlet] + [rproduced] = [raccumulated]
(9.37)
However, the resulting rate will be:
[rgeneration of live cells] = [rgenerated] −[rdead] = (rg−rm)
(9.38)
Therefore, from Equation 9.37, we have:
[G]0 −[G]s + (rg−rm) = [ra]
(9.39)
In a liquid-phase continuous system, we have the following expression as a function
of the cells concentration:
([C]0 −[C]s)v0 + (rg −rm) = dC
dt
(9.40)
Since there is no flow in a batch reactor, we have:
(rg −rm) = dC
dt
(9.41)
The same balance should be done in relation to the substrate, but in this case, the
rate will be the transformation of the substrate, i.e.:
(−rS)V = d[S]
dt
(9.42)
With these equations, the rate constants can be determined by using the differential
and integral methods (Chapter 5).

substrate S and different concentrations of cells, according to the following table:

LIQUID-PHASE REACTIONS
Liquid-phase reactions are very important because they occur in different forms. The
presence of ions in solutions can significantly affect the dielectric constant of the sol-
vent. These reactions are very fast due to energy transfer efficiency, primarily due to
collision between the molecules and the small distance between the molecules in the
liquid phase.
There is also the effect of the acidic medium on the solvation due to the formation
of complexes and transfer of protons. A classic example is presented as follows:
CH3I + Cl−→CH3Cl + I−
This reaction is 106 times greater in a solution of dimethylacetamide than in ace-
tone. The collision between the molecules is very intense due the approximation of the
molecules with ions in solution, influencing other molecules.

Kinetics of liquid-phase reactions
185
The major problem is how to calculate the kinetics of these reactions. There are
several proposals and one of them is gas collision theory, because they are of the same
order of magnitude. Collisions occur repeatedly with high frequency, so they constitute
multiple collisions. It is estimated that the distances between the molecules in the liquid
phase are approximately equal, whereas in the gas phase are quite different. Moreover,
besides the attractive forces, there are also repulsive forces, but the important thing
is that for the reaction to occur it is necessary to overcome the energy barrier Eb.
Differently from the reactions in the gas phase, the collisions in the liquid phase are
10–1000 times higher, but depend on other properties such as the viscosity.
The formation of radicals is also important since they are not in equilibrium and
therefore have a great energy capacity and a greater degree of freedom that allows
overcoming the energy barrier, but is much lower when compared to the equilibrium
state. The collision of the molecules favors the formation of these radicals which are
far more numerous in the liquid phase. On the other hand, diffusional problems exist
and, in certain cases, may be limiting in the process.
We saw earlier that in the photochemical reactions, an initiation step occurs due
to absorption of a photon, favoring the homolytic breaking and forming two free
radicals. In the liquid phase, these radicals are neighbors and can recombine themselves
or combined with other radicals or molecules.
9.2.1
Liquid solutions
It is a common practice to try to relate the activity coefficients of ions with the com-
position and dielectric constant under certain conditions of temperature. The most
indicated theory is that of Debye–Huckel, for dilute solutions. This theory is not valid
when the concentrations are high.
A certain analogy is made with the transition state theory to predict the influence
of ionic strength on the reaction rate constant. The model is the same as for the theory
of transition state presented previously. An intermediate complex is formed (Figure
9.7), according to the reaction:
A(l) + B(l)
k2/k1
←→AB∗k3
−→R
(9.43)
We will not make the deduction, and details can be found in Hill’s book. According
to this theory, the rate constant for a bimolecular reaction would be given by:
k = k0
γAγB
λAB∗
(9.44)
where:
k0 = constant when it is infinite
γA and γB = activity coefficients of A and B, respectively
λAB∗= activity coefficient of the activated complex.
In general, these activity coefficients are not thermodynamically known and can be
determined by analogy with the existing data for the compounds, with the exception

This ionic strength depends on the concentration of the reactants and the charge

This is known as the equation of Brönsted–Bjerrum for dilute solutions.
It is observed that the rate constant depends on the ionic strength, which in turn,
can vary substantially from one solution to another. Experimental results showed that
depending on the ionic charges, the rate constants may vary positively or negatively
with the ionic strength, as shown in Figure 9.8:
There are other important variables that can affect the rate constants. One of them
is the pressure. When the pressure is low, it does not affect, but when it is high, the
rate can increase or decrease, depending on the volume of the system.
Example
E9.4 The reaction (Adapted from Hill):
H2O2 + 2H+ + 2I−→2H2O + I2
We observed the following rate at 25◦C:
r = k1[H2O2][I−] + k2[A∗] −k3[H2O2][I−][H+]
And the following experimental data:
Check if these results are consistent with the kinetic model?

We start from Equation 9.46:

Note that
Case (a)—the first term contains only the constant k1.
Thus, in this case, the equation of Brönsted–Bjerrum contains only a negative ion
zI−= −1.
Therefore:
zH202.zI−= 0
In this case, the constant k1 is independent of ionic strength, i.e., for any value
of µ the constant k1 has the same value. Table E9.1 gives that the values of k1 are
approximately the same.
Case (b)—the second term k2 contains the ions [I−][H+]
Thus:
z[I−]z[H+] = −1
thus, the equation becomes:
log10k = log10k0 −2 × 0.509√µ
Substituting the values, we have:
When µ = 0, k2 = 19. Thus, k0 = 19k0.
Therefore:
log10 k = 1.278 −1.018√µ

Acid—base reactions
These reactions occur by proton transfer. The protonated or nonprotonated species
or perhaps the intermediate species react with the other components of the reaction.
According to Brönsted, the following reaction scheme occurs:
HX + Y →HY + X
(9.47)
Brönsted + Conjugated base
Conjugated acid + Acid
Unlike the previous case, this reaction does not involve electrons, and, therefore,
there is no repulsion. The molecules get polarized and have a high degree of solvation
in a polar solvent.
The rate or rate constant follows the theory of Bronsted–Lowry and is a function
of the ions, in particular of hydronium ion, which is a combination of the proton with
water. It also depends on the concentrations of conjugate acids. Its expression is [Hill]:
k = k0 + kH+[H3O+] + kOH−[OH−] +

kHX[HXj] +

kXj[Xi]
(9.48)

This constant depends on the temperature and mainly on the pH of the solution.
When weak acids and bases are involved, we can simply have,
k = k0 + kH+[H3O+] + kOH−[OH−] + kHA[HA] + kA−[A−]
(9.49)
The contribution of the terms depends on the experimental conditions and,
depending on the case, may be discarded and simplified. Thus, when an acid is weak,

have in the equilibrium:

(9.50)
In this case, we can simply have the expression above, i.e.:

(9.51)
where

REPARAMETERIZATION OF THE MICHAELIS-MENTEN
EQUATION
As seen in Section 3.3.3 and Section 5.7, and discussed in detail in Chapter 11, nonlin-
ear models may rely on parameters that present high correlations among themselves,
which can cause significant numerical problems during estimation of model parame-
ters, as the minimization of the objective function may become inefficient (Espie and
Macchietto, 1988), and the statistical characterization of the final parameter esti-
mates may lack significance (Watts, 1994). Some of these difficulties can be observed
during the estimation of parameters of rate equations that are based on the Michaelis–
Menten equation, utilized throughout Chapter 9, because of usually high correlations
among obtained parameter estimates. As discussed in the previous sections, rate equa-
tions based on the Michaelis–Menten expression are commonly used in enzymatic and
fermentation problems to describe rate expressions and equilibrium conditions.
Initially, the Michaelis–Menten equation can be written in different forms,
including:
RS = −
K1[S]
1 + K2[S]
(9.53)
RS = −
[S]
K3 + K4[S]

Using the approach developed originally by Schwaab and Pinto (2007, 2008) to
perform the reparameterization of the Arrhenius equation (see Section 3.3.3) and of
the power-law rate model (see Section 5.7), and consequently to remove the undesir-
able correlation between model parameters and improve parametric precision, it is
necessary to understand that the covariance matrix of parameter uncertainties (Vα)
can be calculated in the form (see Chapter 11):

of these equations have always the same sign and the sum of the derivatives cannot
become equal to zero. This explains mathematically why the respective model parame-
ters are correlated strongly and the final parameter estimates frequently lack statistical
significance. On the other hand, when Equation (9.56) is used as reference:

One criticism that can be raised regarding Equation (9.62) is the fact that reaction
rates are usually not measured in the lab. As a matter of fact, experimental proce-
dures usually provide concentrations or mass values, so that the dynamic mass balance

tabulation sampled in the interval [0, 2] h with sampling times of 0.01 h (201

culate the values of [S]ref, which were shown to be equal to 0.684787 mol/L, 0.685421
mol/L and 0.691386 mol/L, indicating that the reference parameter is not very sensitive
to modification of the sampling frequency. A similar exercise was performed through
manipulation of the final reaction time, which was made equal to 1 h (11 points), 10
h (101 points) and 100 h (1001 points), keeping the sampling interval equal to 0.1 h.
In this case, the reference values were respectively equal to 0.830011 mol/L, 0.532027
mol/L and 0.532026 mol/L, indicating that the reference value changes with experi-
mental batch time (because it is an average of measured concentrations) but converges
fast to an asymptotic value (because it is an average that is weighted by the reaction
rates that converge to zero if the reaction time is too long). As a matter of fact, the
following empirical and very simple equation can be suggested for [S]ref:
[S]ref = [S]0 + [S]NE

tabulation [S]0 is the initial concentration and [S]NE is the last experimental point of
the batch. In the analyzed cases, these values would be equal to 0.634624 mol/L in the
first three numerical experiments (constant batch time) and 0.780604 mol/L, 0.5000
mol/L and 0.5000 mol/L in the remaining three numerical experiments (constant
sampling time).

Heterogeneous reaction kinetics
Heterogeneous reactions occur in gas or liquid phase or in both phases in the presence
of a solid as a catalyst or as reactant, which depends on the process in use. Usually,
the reactions in gas–solid phase or gas–liquid–solid phases depend on the industrial
reaction conditions. In catalytic processes, the catalyst promotes the reaction rate in
the gas or in the liquid phase.
The ammonia synthesis N2 + 3H2 →2NH3 is a classic example of a catalytic
reaction in gas phase, as shown in Figure 10.1.
The ammonia synthesis is one of the most important processes in the production of
fertilizers. The reaction is exothermic (H = −46 kJ/mol NH3) and runs at relatively
low temperatures (≈400◦C) and high pressures (≈60–100 atm). The kinetics is an
example of a heterogeneous system occurring on iron-based catalyst.
The limiting step of the kinetics is the chemical reaction occurring at the surface.
However, there are diverse physical and chemical phenomena, besides mass transfer
and internal diffusion inside pore particles affecting the global reaction rate. There are
different steps:
1.
Diffusion of reactant molecules through the fluid in the direction of the surface.
2.
Diffusion of molecules from the surface through pores.
3.
Chemical reaction on surface sites.
4.
Diffusion of molecules (not reacted and products) from the sites through pores in
the direction of the external surface.
5.
Diffusion of molecules (not reacted and products) from the surface in the outflow
direction.
However, the main question is what reaction kinetics occurs on the surface sites?
What is the expression of the total reaction rate and what parameters or variables are
involved?

ucts flow through the reactor containing solid particles but the reaction occurs at the

There are mass transport in the fluid flowing in the direction to the surface and
diffusion inside pores, as shown in Figure 10.3, with concentration varying along this
path.

Heterogeneous reaction kinetics

The film at the surface and its thickness depend on the hydrodynamics in the
reactor. Reactants reaching the surface react forming products that must return in the
outflow.
There are two possibilities:
1.
The mass transfer through the film is facile. In this case, the global reaction rate is
determined by the chemical reaction rate at the surface of the catalyst. Therefore,
the chemical reaction is the limiting step of the process.
2.
The mass transfer through the film is slow and, therefore it is the limiting step. In
this case, there is a diffusional barrier in the film surrounding the surface of the
catalyst.
This latter case is unwanted for kinetic data acquisition and must be eliminated or
avoided. Experiments must run at high velocity or high Reynolds number, diminishing
the film surrounding the surface.
To verify experimentally the mass or diffusion phenomena, one measures the con-
version by varying the molar flow rate or mass, changing height and diameter of the
reactor, as illustrated in Figure 10.4.
In the first case, one fixes the dimensions (L/D) by varying the mass (m) or molar
flow rate (F), and measure the conversion. If for successive experiments the conversion

changes, there occur mass transfer effects. However, if conversion did not change, these
effects are negligible. In the second case, we change the linear velocity by modifying
the diameter, keeping the ratio W/F, and if conversion varies there are mass transfer
effects.
Figure 10.5 illustrates the concentration gradients formed in the film surrounding
the solid for different cases.
10.2
INTERNAL DIFFUSION PHENOMENA
Catalysts contain active sites which are located inside the pores. Therefore, molecules
must first diffuse into the pores. Figure 10.6 shows reactant A diffusing in the pores
until reaching the sites before reaction.
The internal molecular diffusion inside pores can be the limiting step and therefore
it is unwanted. Basically, there are three forms of diffusions occurring in the pores of
the catalyst:
1.
Molecular diffusion: may occur in big pore diameters (1–10 µm) where the mean
free path of the molecules is small compared to the pore diameter.
2.
Knudsen diffusion: exists in middle pore diameters (10–1.000 Å) where the mass
transport happens by collision between the molecules and the wall.
3.
Configuration diffusion: exists in pores where the diameter of molecules is of the
same order of the pore diameter.

How can we verify diffusion in pores and when it is the limiting step of the process?
There are two experimental procedures:
1.
Measuring the conversion as a function of the particle size—the reaction is per-
formed by varying the particle sizes dP, keeping constant all other variables
(temperature, pressure, flow rate, and total mass of the sample). If diffusion
limitations exist, the conversion increases with successive decreasing particles dP,
until attaining a constant value, as shown in Figure 10.5. Any diameter less or
equal is free from diffusion resistance and hence, the kinetic regime is the limiting
step of the process.
2.
Measuring the activation energy of the reaction from the kinetic constants at differ-
ent temperatures—graph ln(k) versus 1/T, which allows to calculate the activation
energy. If the energy of activation is lower at higher temperatures compared to
the value at lower temperatures, there are diffusional limitations, which must be
eliminated or avoided as shown in Figure 10.8.
Therefore for kinetic measurements, high temperatures are not recommended to
avoid diffusional effects. Table 10.1 presents the different possibilities that may occur
in a gas phase catalytic reactions.

ADSORPTION–DESORPTION PHENOMENA
Aggregated systems (solids, liquids, and gases) have two energy types:
1.
Kinetic energy, EC, or thermal energy–inducing particles (atoms or ions) with
different possibilities of motions such as translation, rotation, and vibration.
2.
Interaction energy between particles, Ei, such as van der Waals and electrostatic
forces.
The order of magnitude of these energies defines the system.
(a)
When EC ≫Ei, the molecules have maximum freedom, since the distance between
molecules varies. The volume of the system is a function of the temperature,
pressure, and number of molecules. It is classified as an ideal gas system.

Chemical reaction engineering

Figure 10.9 Interaction between particles in a condensed system (solid or liquid).
(b)
When EC ≈Ei, the molecules or atoms have less degree of freedom. Molecules
move but the distance between them varies little. The volume of the system is
a function of the temperature, number of molecules, and ions, independent of
pressure. It represents the liquid state.
(c)
When EC ≪Ei, the volume depends only on the number of molecules. Molecules
and atoms have only vibration-free movement, and the kinetic energy is attributed
to the vibration of molecules around the same position. It represents the
adsorption of molecules on solids.
Systems (b) and (c) are called condensed matter state, since the volumes are defined
and less sensible to pressure variation. For condensed systems, the molecules on the
surface or at the interface of another system present different situations:
1.
Particles located inside the system are susceptible to forces in all directions and
the resultant force is zero.
2.
Particles at the surface have forces deriving only from inner particles.
Figure 10.9 shows the different systems.
Therefore, as shown in Figure 10.9, particles at the surface have an excess of energy,
denominated as superficial energy, ES. This energy is responsible for the surface tension
of the liquid and adsorption of fluid over solids.
A catalytic reaction involves physical–chemical phenomena of adsorption and
desorption besides chemical reaction. As shown in Figure 10.10, the energy barrier
or activation energy of a catalytic reaction is lower than the activation energy of a
noncatalytic reaction due to the adsorption and desorption phenomena.
The adsorption in a catalytic reaction is an exothermic phenomenon. However,
either the adsorption of molecules at the surface or desorption from the surface occurs
under different strengths, decreasing the degree of freedom that facilitates the reaction.
The energy of activation of a catalytic reaction is, therefore, lower than the energy

barrier. Thus, it is necessary to determine the adsorption and desorption rates in a
catalytic process.
Thermodynamically, we do explain the adsorption phenomenon of a fluid at the
surface from the Gibbs free energy. It should be spontaneous and, thus, Gads < 0.
However, the final entropy of the system diminishes too, since the disorder is lower
when molecules are adsorbed, or S < 0.
G = H −TS
(10.1)
Adsorption:
Hads = Gads + TSads
(10.2)
Since Gads < 0 and S < 0, then the enthalpy change of the system is less than
zero, and thus the adsorption is an exothermal phenomenon.
Depending on involved nature of forces, there are two types of adsorptions.
10.3.1
Physical adsorption or physisorption
Its characteristic is low interaction between molecules and solid surfaces. The result-
ing forces are of the same order of the van der Waals forces, and the enthalpy of
adsorption is in the same range of the condensation enthalpy or evaporation gases

208
Chemical reaction engineering
(−0.5–5 kcal/mol). In this kind of adsorption, several layers of molecules can be formed
and the adsorption force decreases with increasing layers.
The physisorption occurs at low temperatures and is more intense if the temper-
ature is near the condensation. Since the interaction energy with the surface is small
and due to the inexistent activation energy of adsorption, the physisorption attains
quickly the equilibrium, and thus it is reversible. However, materials having very small
pores (zeolites, carbons) exhibit slow physisorption, which indicates that the diffusion
in pores is the limiting step of this process.
The physisorption of gases on solids is frequently used for textural analyses of
catalysts and solids, such as surface area and pore distribution and sizes.
10.3.2
Chemical adsorption or chemisorption
The chemisorption characteristic is the strong interaction between molecules and sur-
faces. The chemisorption enthalpy (−Hads) is of the order of 10–100 kcal/mol, thus,
of the same order of the reaction involved in chemical bindings.
Different from the physisorption, the chemisorption is irreversible and occurs at
higher temperatures than the condensation temperature, and since the interaction is
specific between molecules and solids, the adsorbed molecules form a monolayer.
The chemisorption processes need longer times to attain the equilibrium condition,
in particular at low temperatures. There are two types of chemisorptions:
–
Activated chemisorption: The adsorption rate varies with temperature and with
self-activation energy. It follows the Arrhenius equation.
–
Nonactivated chemisorption: This occurs quickly and indicates very low energy
of activation or zero-activation energy.
10.3.3
Comparing physical and chemical adsorptions
The adsorption phenomena can be illustrated by the potential energy curve, as shown
in Figure 10.11. When a gas approaches the surface of a metal, occurs dissociative
adsorption of a diatomic gas X2 over the metal M.
Curve F shows the physisorption pathway of a gas X2 toward the metal and curve
Q the chemisorption pathway when the gas molecule is first dissociated as X–X. One
may conclude that when the gas approaches the surface, the physical adsorption is
important for the next step, the chemical adsorption. In reality, all molecules are ini-
tially physisorbed approaching the surface with less energy. If not, it is necessary to
activate the gas molecule, providing high energy for dissociation. However, molecules
firstly physisorbed must overcome an energy barrier and then chemisorb. The bar-
rier is located at the intersection of both curves F and Q. When this intersection is
located above the axis, according to Figure 10.10, then the activation energy is Ea,
and adsorption follows reaching the maximum adsorption state with an adsorption
enthalpy Hads, highly exothermic, but when located below the axis, it is not activated.
Noteworthy is that the energy barrier of activation is much lower than the enthalpy
needed for direct dissociation of the molecules.
Chemisorption of gases over solids is often used for metallic surface area and
dispersion of particles on supported catalysts analyses. Table 10.2 presents some
properties comparing the physical and chemical adsorptions.

ADSORPTION ISOTHERMS
The amount of gas adsorption in a solid is proportional to the mass and depends on
the temperature, pressure, solid, and gas nature. Thus, the number of moles of gas
adsorption at the surface is:
n = f (P, T, gas, solid)
(10.3)

Chemical reaction engineering

Figure 10.12 Adsorption isotherms.
For constant temperature, the equation is simplified as:
n = f (P)T,gas,solid
which is called “adsorption isotherm,’’ relating the amount of gas adsorbed with the
equilibrium pressure at constant temperature.
The experimental results are classified into six different types of adsorption
isotherms and are shown in Figure 10.12.
The isotherm of type I indicates chemisorption, where saturation occurs at rel-
atively low pressures, with the formation of a complete monolayer. These isotherms
represent microporous material. Isotherms classified as type II and VI represent the
physical adsorption. Isotherms II and III indicate infinite adsorption as P/P0 →1,
corresponding to physical adsorption on multilayers occurring on nonporous or
macroporous materials.
Isotherms IV and V are equivalent to isotherms II and III but with finite adsorption,
which indicates pore fill of the macro- or mesoporous materials.
The last isotherm type VI (in steps) occurs on nonporous uniform surfaces and
indicates the adsorption layer by layer, where each step corresponds to the maximum
adsorption capacity of a monolayer.

10.5
ADSORPTION MODELS
Some models have been proposed interpreting the adsorption–desorption phenomena.
The most important models are described by the isotherms introduced by Langmuir,
Freundlich, and Temkin.
10.5.1
Langmuir model
The first quantitative theoretical model of gas adsorption in solids was proposed by
Langmuir in 1916. Langmuir assumed the following hypotheses in this model:
1.
The solid surface has a finite number of adsorption sites.
2.
Each site can only adsorb one molecule.
3.
All sites have equivalent energies or equal adsorption enthalpies.
4.
The adsorption is independent of neighboring adsorbed species or the enthalpy is
independent of the surface coverage.
5.
The adsorption and desorption rates are equal at equilibrium.
6.
At equilibrium and constant temperature and pressure, the number of adsorbed
molecules at the surface is nA. The fraction of sites occupied by A molecules is θA:
θA = nA
nm
(10.4)
7.
At constant temperature, the adsorption rate of A molecule varies with the partial
pressure PA and the number of nonoccupied sites. The desorption rate varies with
the number of occupied sites.
10.5.1.1
Adsorption of a single molecule
Assume the adsorption of a single molecule Aat the surface. The fraction of sites
occupied and unoccupied are:
θA = fraction of occupied sites of A molecules.
(1 −θA) = fraction of unoccupied sites or free sites.
where
θA = nads
nm
and
nm = number of molecules of a monolayer.
Schematically,
( –

212
Chemical reaction engineering
The adsorption rate of A is directly proportional to the partial pressure of A and to
the fraction of free surface sites. This proportional factor is called adsorption constant
ka. Thus,
rads = kapA(1 −θA)
(10.5)
However, simultaneously occurs desorption of adsorbed A on surface sites. The
desorption rate of A is directly proportional to the fraction of occupied sites or adsorbed
A molecules, and kd is the desorption constant. Thus,
rdes = kdθA
(10.6)
Of course, the resulting rate is the difference of adsorption and desorption rates;
however, it is assumed that they are in equilibrium, which means that molecules are
constantly adsorbed and desorbed allowing the adsorption of new molecules and free
sites. Thus, at equilibrium, we have:
rads = rdes
Hence, we can determine the fraction of occupied sites of A molecules, according
to the equation:
θA =
kapA
kd + kapA
This equation can be written as function of the equilibrium adsorption–desorption
constant, which is a thermodynamic property. Defining,
KA = ka
kd
Thus,
θA =
KApA
1 + KApA
(10.7)
It is the Langmuir equation of a single adsorption molecule. Note that the fraction
of surface sites can be determined experimentally by measuring adsorbed volumes in
a system of constant pressure and temperature, according to the ideal gas law, since
θA =
Vads
Vmonolayer
(10.8)
The order of magnitude of the equilibrium constant KA indicates the affinity of the
gas with the solid. For high KA values, the equilibrium is shifted toward adsorption
and vice versa. There are two extreme cases to be considered:
1.
If KApA ≈0, the equation becomes θA = KApA, i.e., the surface coverage is propor-
tional to pressure A. This situation occurs when pA ≈0, i.e., on the initial stretch

Heterogeneous reaction kinetics
213
of the isotherm, or when KA ≈0, i.e., when the gas affinity with the solid is very
small.
2.
If KApA ≫0, the equation becomes θA = 1, or, the coverage is a complete mono-
layer. It occurs when pA ≫0, i.e., near the vapor pressure of A, or when KA ≫0,
i.e., when high affinity of gas with the surface.
10.5.1.2
Dissociative adsorption
Assuming the adsorption of a molecule A2 on the site * which occurs according to:
A2(g) + 2∗(s) ⇄A∗
(ads)
(10.9)
In this case, the adsorption and desorption rates are, respectively:
rads = kapA(1 −θA)2
(10.10)
rdes = kdθ2
A
(10.11)
The dissociation of molecules occurs on two sites simultaneously.
At equilibrium, we have:
rads = kapA(1 −θA)2 = kdθ2
A
Since
KA = ka
kd
Rearranging, we determine the fraction of occupied sites due to dissociation, thus,
θA =

KApA
1 +

KApA
(10.12)
This is the Langmuir equation for dissociative adsorption.
10.5.1.3
Adsorption of n-molecules
Going on, adsorption–desorption of several molecules, reactants or products, we have
similar situation, as shown in the following scheme:
Agas
Bgas

Then, the fraction of free sites is:
θv = (1 −θA −θB −θR . . . )

214
Chemical reaction engineering
where θB and θR are the fractions of occupied sites by reactant B and product R,
respectively.
If the adsorption and desorption rates are similar to the rates presented in Equa-
tions 10.5 and 10.6, for each component and considering the equilibrium constant
similarly, we get the following system:
θA = KApAθv
θB = KBpBθv
θR = KRpRθv

(10.14)
Therefore, we can determine the fraction of occupied sites of each component
from Equation 10.14, since
θi = Kipiθv
Thus, for example, for component A, we get:
θA =
KApA
(1 + KA · pA + KB · pB + KR · pR)
(10.15)
If one of the components is dissociated, we substitute the corresponding term by
square root. For example, if A is dissociated, then
θA =

KApA
(1 +

KApA + KB · pB + KR · pR)
(10.16)
These expressions of occupied fraction sites by associated or dissociated molecules
are important for the determination of the adsorption and the desorption rates, as
shown in Equations 10.5 and 10.6. Moreover, they are also important for the determi-
nation of the reaction rates occurring simultaneously with adsorption and desorption,
as presented in the next sections.

Heterogeneous reaction kinetics
215
10.5.2
Other chemisorption models
The Langmuir adsorption model fails because:
•
Not all sites are active.
•
The adsorption enthalpy depends on the surface coverage degree. Adsorbed
molecules may interfere on the adsorption of neighboring sites.
The dependence of the surface coverage with the heat of adsorption was accounted
on two other models. The Freundlich model presents the coverage surface as:
θ = kP1/n
(10.17)
where k and n are constants and assume values higher than one. Freundlich’s equa-
tion was originally introduced as an empirical correlation from experimental data.
However, it can be derived theoretically with following considerations.
The heat of adsorption decreases logarithmically with the surface coverage,
Hads = A ln θ
(10.18)
where θ assumes values varying between 0.2 and 0.8.
Temkin’s model assumes a decreasing linear relationship of the heat of adsorption
with the surface coverage:
Hads = H0(1 −βθ)
(10.19)
where H0 is the initial heat of adsorption. The degree of surface coverage is, in this
case, given as follows:
θ =
RT
βH0
ln (aP)
(10.20)
where a is the constant related to the enthalpy of adsorption and β is constant.
Noteworthy is that despite of all limitations, the Langmuir model is used in
majority for kinetic models.
10.6
MODEL OF HETEROGENEOUS REACTIONS
Molecules are bonded at the surface (on active sites) by both physical and chemical
adsorption processes. The nature and strengths of molecular bindings at the surface
sites are of fundamental importance for the occurring reaction. The catalytic activity
depends on the adsorption strengths, as shown in Figure 10.13. The activity is low
when the adsorption strength is weak, which indicates the presence of van der Waals
forces. However, for strong adsorptions bindings (chemical bonds), the activity is also
very low. Therefore, intermediate adsorption strengths favor higher activity.
Moreover, products which are strongly bonded may make the desorption-freeing
sites for the adsorption of new molecules difficult.

This model consists of sequential steps which depend on the molecular or dissoci-
ated adsorption forms and the nature of one or more active sites at the surface. One
determines the rates for each step and assumes what the rate limiting step is.
Irreversible mono- and bimolecular reactions
For the decomposition reaction of a reactant over one kind of surface active site where
both reactant and product are likely adsorbed, the reaction occurs with the adsorbed
species.
A
k
−→R
Neglecting external mass transfer and diffusion effects, and assuming the chemical
reaction as the limiting step, there are three main steps:
1.
Adsorption of A at the surface
A + ∗ka/kd
←→A∗
where * = surface active site, A∗= adsorbed molecule at the surface, ka and
kd = adsorption and desorption constants, respectively.

Heterogeneous reaction kinetics
217
2.
Surface chemical reaction
The decomposition occurs with the adsorbed reactant species transforming into
product adsorbed species on free site. Thus,
A∗
k
−→R∗
where k is the specific rate constant of a monomolecular irreversible reaction,
where the unit is square meters per mole time, and R∗is the product adsorbed
species.
3.
Desorption of the product
The adsorbed R∗species is desorbed, releasing one active site and producing R
gas molecule.
R∗ka/kd
←→R∗+ ∗
Schematically we obtain:
R*
Surface
A*
There are three possibilities:
(a)
Adsorption of A is the limiting step.
(b)
Chemical reaction is the limiting step.
(c)
Desorption of R is the limiting step.
Here, we illustrate one possibility:
(b) Chemical reaction as the limiting step
Assuming that the surface chemical reaction relative to step (2) is irreversible, first
order, and the limiting step. Then, the reaction rate is:
r = kθA
(10.21)
But,
the surface fraction of adsorbed A species was calculated assuming
adsorption–desorption rates of reactant A and product R in equilibrium, according
to Equation 10.15. Then, by substituting we obtain:
( −rA) =
kKApA
(1 + KA · pA + KR · pR)
(10.22)

218
Chemical reaction engineering
For a bimolecular reaction we proceed similarly, with a second component B
reacting with A and the formation of a product R, or
A + B
k
−→R
Assuming that both reactants and products are adsorbed and in analogy, we obtain
the surface coverage of each adsorbed species.
If the adsorption–desorption rates of species are in equilibrium, we can calculate
the corresponding surface fractions from Equation 10.15.
If the bimolecular reaction is irreversible and limiting step, then the reaction rate
is proportional to the surface fractions of adsorbed species A and B. Thus,
r = kθAθB
(10.23)
The fractions of adsorbed species A and B were calculated considering all adsorbed
species, according to Equation 10.15. Thus,
( −rA) =
kKAKBpApB
(1 + KA · pA + KB · pB + KR · pR)2
(10.24)
This expression is valid only for case (b), when the surface chemical reaction is the
limiting step. When the adsorptions or desorptions either of reactant or products are
the limiting steps, then the corresponding rates are not in equilibrium.
When the adsorption of A is the limiting step, then:
rads ̸= rdes(adsorption-desorption of A)
rreação = 0
rads = rdes
Equations 10.22 and 10.24 are similar and thus generalized in the following form:
r =
(Kinetics) 
potencial strength


adsorption −desorption term
n
Thus,
1.
The numerator contains the kinetic constants and the potential strength of a
catalytic reaction.
2.
The exponent n in the denominator represents the number of active sites, or the
number of sites involved in the reaction.
3.
The denominator represents the contribution of adsorption–desorption steps in
equilibrium.

Figure 10.14 Eley-Rideal model.
10.6.2
Eley–Rideal model
This model derives from the previous one. For example, the catalytic reaction in the
gas phase is:
A(g) + B(g) →P(g) + R(g)
For this model, we assume that one of the reactants (products also) is adsorbed at
the surface site while the other is not, as shown in Figure 10.14.
Thus, B and R do not adsorb and Equation 10.23 becomes:
r = kθApB
(10.25)
where
KB = 0
KR = 0
Thus, similar to Equation 10.24, we obtain:
(−rA) =
kKApApB
(1 + KA · pA + KR · pR)
(10.26)
10.6.3
Effect of the temperature and energies
As already known, both the kinetic constants and equilibrium adsorption–desorption
constants depend on the temperature. However, the kinetic constant is also a function
of the activation energy, following the Arrhenius equation, while the adsorption–
desorption constants depend on the heat of adsorptions or desorptions, respectively,
both exothermic. Thus, starting from Equation 10.26, we obtain:
k = k0 · exp(−E/RT)
Ki = Ki0 · exp(Hi/RT)

220
Chemical reaction engineering
where Hi < 0.
For a catalytic reaction, the rate is given by:
rcat = kcat · exp(Ecat/RT)
(10.27)
Equating 10.26, after substitution of the corresponding kinetic and adsorption–
desorption constants, we obtain the apparent activation energy:
Ecat = E −HA + HR
(10.28)
As seen, the apparent activation energy involves the kinetic activation energy as
well as the adsorption–desorption enthalpies of adsorbed species. The rate of a catalytic
reaction is easier than for a noncatalytic reaction since the energetic barrier is lower,
increasing the activity of the reaction which explains the catalytic effect.
10.7
DETERMINATION OF THE CONSTANTS
For determining the rate constants, we use similar methodology as presented pre-
viously: the integral or differential methods. The differential method is frequently
used and easily visualized in the graphic solution after transforming the rate equation.
For example, for a monomolecular, irreversible, and first-order reaction, the rate is
expressed in Equation 10.22. It was deduced assuming that the reaction rate is the
limiting step and both reactants and products adsorbed. Thus,

E10.1 Experimental results of a catalytic reaction are presented in the following table.
The conversion was kept around 5%, and therefore, it should be considered as a
differential reactor. Mass or diffusion effects were eliminated. The reaction is:
Cyclohexanol −−−→cyclohexene + water
It suggests a reaction rate, where adsorption–desorption and reaction occur, and
the reaction is the limiting step. Try to estimate the constants with the following data,
assuming that the adsorption–desorption constants of the products are approximately
similar [Hill].

Note that if PCH−= PH20 = 1 then:
•
Increasing the pressure five times, the rate decreases three times.
•
Increasing (experiments 2 and 3) pressure 1.2 times, the rate falls ≈2 times.
•
Increasing (experiments 1 and 3) pressure six times, the rate falls ≈6 times.
In fact with increasing pressure, the rate is not directly proportional to the
partial pressure but inversely proportional, although not equal, which suggests
adsorption–desorption of A in the denominator term. Therefore, A is strongly
adsorbed.

ments we observe:

It suggests that component R is adsorbed; however, compared with adsorption
of A its adsorption is weak, although greater than that of S.

We observe that all components are adsorbed and that the adsorptions of the
products are almost of the same order, weakly adsorbed. Therefore, assuming
that the reaction is irreversible, first order, and the limiting step, we obtain from

NONCATALYTIC HETEROGENEOUS REACTIONS
Noncatalytic heterogeneous reactions are reactions of gases reacting with the solid.
These reactions are very important in the regeneration of catalysts, elimination of
coke or carbons at the surface blocking pores after the deactivation process. Also, for
the combustion of particulates from exhaust gases which are eliminated by trucks,
due to the incomplete combustion of diesel, releasing huge amounts of fine carbon
particles, and therefore causing environmental problems.
There are several other cases of solid reactions, such as elimination of H2S using
ZnO solids, which transforms the oxide into sulfte that are discarded after completion
of reaction. Some typical examples are as follows:
1.
Burning coke from catalysts
C + O2 →CO2
(10.32)
2.
Elimination of sulfur compounds forming H2S
ZnO + H2S →ZnS + H2O
(10.33)
The question here is to know the kinetics of these reactions involving diffusion
phenomena during the reaction. The solid particle is consumed due to the chemical
reaction, but as it proceeds transforms the material into ashes or inert material whereby
gas flows and diffuses until reaching the surface for reacting. Thus, there is another
limiting step which is the diffusion of gas through the solid. On the other hand, the
adsorption–desorption phenomena of gases may occur at the surface and can also be
limiting or not. In general, the surface is nonhomogeneous and these phenomena occur
on different surface sites.
For simplifying, we disregard the adsorption–desorption phenomena, focusing
mainly the diffusion and surface reaction steps. Evidently, time is an important vari-
able, since we want to know how long it takes for total consumption of the solid or
transformation of the solid. An example is shown in Figure 10.16.
There are two important steps:
1.
Diffusion of gas (O2) through the inert layer (ash) until the interface.
2.
Reaction at the interface with the formation of products and diffusion.
From the mass balance of gas (O2), we get:

REPARAMETERIZATION OF THE LHHW EQUATION
As seen in Section 9.3 and discussed in detail in Chapter 11, nonlinear kinetic models
may rely on parameters that present high correlations among themselves, leading to sig-
nificant numerical problems during the estimation of model parameters and prejudicing
the statistical characterization of the final parameter estimates (Espie and Macchietto,
1988; Watts, 1994). Some of these difficulties can also be observed during the estima-
tion of parameters of LHHW rate equations, utilized throughout Chapter 10, because
of the usually high correlations among the obtained parameter estimates. As discussed
in the previous sections, LHHW rate equations are based on reaction mechanisms that
explicitly consider adsorption steps and occurrence of chemical interactions between
the active catalyst sites and the reacting chemical species. In its simplest form, reac-
tion rates can be controlled by adsorption phenomena, often described in terms of the
Langmuir equation as:

As a matter of fact, Equations (10.50–5) are quite similar to the ones described and
studied previously in Section 9.3, when the Michaelis–Menten equation was used to
represent the rates of substrate consumption in enzymatic and fermentation problems.
Therefore, very similar numerical approaches can be used for reparameterization of
the Langmuir equation and estimation of more precise model parameters.
Example
E10.3 Using the approach developed originally by Schwaab and Pinto (2007, 2008)
to perform the reparameterization of the Arrhenius equation (see Section 3.3.3) and
of the power-law rate model (see Section 5.7), it was shown in Section 9.3 that the
Michaelis–Menten equation could be better described in the form:

reaction rate equation. In spite of that, reparameterization can be performed iteratively
with the help of appropriate numerical procedures, as discussed by Schwaab et al.
(2008). In this case, a suitable objective function must be proposed (for instance, the
summation of the absolute values of all parameter correlations) and then the reparame-
terizing values (for instance, the reference concentration used in Equations (10.56–60))
must be manipulated in order to reduce the value of the proposed objective function
iteratively, until attainment of the minimum possible correlation values. This is exactly
the procedure illustrated in Figure 10.50, which shows parameter correlation values
as a function of reference concentration.

Parameter estimation and experimental

Chapter 11
Determination of kinetic parameters
through parameter estimation
As we had the opportunity to observe in the previous sections, in order for reaction
rate expressions to be used for kinetic analyses and design of chemical reactors (as
discussed in detail in the following chapters), it is necessary to determine first the
kinetic rate constants with the help of available experimental data. Formally, this
numerical procedure that transforms available experimental data into useful model
parameters that can be used to perform simulations and equipment design is named
parameter estimation.
Parameter estimation procedures are important in many different chemical engi-
neering fields, and particularly in the field of chemical kinetics, for development of
mathematical models (such as reaction rate expressions), since design, optimization
and advanced control of chemical processes (and chemical reactors in particular) usu-
ally rely on mathematical models, which in turn depend on parameter values obtained
with the help of available experimental data. For this reason, the parameter estimation
problem is discussed in this section more formally.
Before initiating the presentation of mathematical details, it is important to recog-
nize that chemists and engineers frequently search for correlations among the variables
involved in a problem in order to develop and implement model-based process simu-
lation and process design strategies. As a matter of fact, accurate models can be very
useful for simulating experimental responses under the desired experimental condi-
tions and to design process equipment of distinct sizes without incurring the expensive
costs of experimentation. For these reasons, mathematical models find ample use in
most engineering areas, especially to control, design and optimize process operations.
Models can be developed based on theoretical grounds (for instance, detailed reac-
tion mechanisms and mass balance equations) or on empirical premises (for instance,
power-law rate expressions), and they are useful if they can accurately represent the
actual experimental behavior of the analyzed system. Consequently, theoretical mod-
els are not necessarily better than empirical models, as theoretical assumptions can
be incorrect or incomplete to describe the considered problem. Thus, in the present
section both theoretical and empirical reaction rate expressions are equally valued.
Moreover, mathematical models are usually classified, in terms of time dependence, as
dynamic (when the model can be used to follow changes during the simulation time) or
stationary (when model responses do not change with time). Analyses of batch reaction
problems usually make use of dynamic reaction rate models, while design of chemical
reactors normally employ stationary versions of the reaction rate models. Most times,

238
Chemical reaction engineering
numerical procedures are also needed to solve the model equations and calculate the
output model responses, so that the mathematical model can be defined less strictly
as the set of equations and numerical tools that are needed to solve the mathematical
equations and describe the analyzed experimental problem.
Almost always the mathematical model depends on variables that cannot be mea-
sured experimentally and must be determined with the help of experimental data,
like the kinetic rate constants and respective activation energies. These variables are
generically called model parameters and must be estimated before there can be any
meaningful use of the mathematical model. For this reason, the fundamental aspects
of the parameter estimation problem are discussed in the next sections.
11.1
DEFINITION OF THE PARAMETER ESTIMATION PROBLEM
During the proposition of mathematical models, two distinct entities must be defined:
the model structure (the mathematical relationship that correlates output model
responses, y, and model inputs, x) and the parameters of the model. For example,
linear and exponential models are presented in Equations (11.1) and (11.2):
y = α · x + β
(11.1)
y = α · exp (β · x)
(11.2)
In reaction rate problems, x and y involve pressures, concentrations and tem-
peratures at distinct times, the parameters α and β usually are reaction rate constant
and activation energy, respectively. As one can see in Equations (11.1–2), the model
structure can only be used when the parameter values are also known.
A very simple linear model can be obtained when a reaction mechanism comprises
two parallel reactions of the form:
0
A
k1
→B
A
k2
→C
(11.3)
where A, B and C are chemical species and k1 and k2 are kinetic rate constants. If
reaction conditions are kept constant, the relative amounts of reactants B and C are
correlated to each other in the form:
CC = k2
k1
CB
(11.4)
where CC and CB are the molar concentrations of the reaction products C and B, and
the parameter:
α = k2
k1
(11.5)

is a measure of the selectivity. Whereas CC and CB can be measured experimentally, α
must be estimated through proper manipulation of CC and CB as the slope of Equation
(11.4), as illustrated graphically in Figure 11.1.

Figure 11.1 Measured concentrations and estimation of parameter α in Equations (11.4–5). α is the
slope of the experimental data. Experimental data were generated by assuming that
CC= 2CB and adding a random noise of amplitude ± 0.1.
As illustrated in Figure 11.1, the estimation of the model parameters involves the
determination of the parameter values that lead to the smallest difference (or highest
similarity, or likelihood) between the values predicted by the model and the val-
ues observed experimentally. Therefore, the parameter estimation procedure should
manipulate the parameter values in order to minimize the difference between the
model responses and the experimental data, leading to a definition of an optimiza-
tion problem. However, in order to minimize the difference between model responses
and observed data, it is necessary first to define how this difference can be calculated.
In the area of parameter estimation, this difference (or distance) is normally named as
the objective function.
One must observe that measurement uncertainties, as defined in Section 1.9, must
also be considered during the parameter estimation procedure, because unavoidable
experimental fluctuations can affect the experimental data and therefore the obtained
parameter estimates. Besides, due to unavoidable experimental uncertainties, param-
eter estimates will also be uncertain to some extent, leading to uncertain model
predictions. In order to show this, Figure 11.2 reproduces the information content
of Figure 11.1, assuming the occurrence of much larger experimental fluctuations.
As one can observe, proper identification of the slope in this case can be much more
difficult.
Based on the above, the parameter estimation procedure can usually be divided
into three main steps: (i) definition of the objective function that evaluates the distance
between model responses and experimental observations; (ii) determination of the
parameter values that minimize the objective function (usually performed with the help

of a suitable numerical procedure); and (iii) statistical interpretation of the obtained
results. These three steps are discussed in the following sections.
11.2
THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
The definition of the objective function is important and must provide an unambiguous
measure of the distance between the values calculated with the model, y∗, and the values
obtained experimentally, ye. From a mathematical standpoint, the distance between y∗
and ye, d(y∗, ye), must satisfy the following axioms (Kreyszig, 1978):
(i)
d(y∗, ye) ∈R and d(y∗, ye) ≥0
(11.6)
so that distance is a real and positive number;
(ii)
d(y∗, ye) = 0 iff y∗= ye
(11.7)
so that distance equals zero if and only if elements y∗andye are equal;
(iii)
d(y∗, ye) = d(ye, y∗)
(11.8)
so that distance is commutative; and
(iv)
d(y∗, ye) ≤d(y∗, z) + d(z, ye)
(11.9)
so that the triangle inequality is satisfied, indicating that the shortest trajectory between
two points is the one that connects the points directly.
It must be observed that in real problems y∗and ye contain many values, so that
d(y∗,ye) must be computed with vectors containing NE data points. It must be observed

Determination of kinetic parameters through parameter estimation
241
that any distance function that satisfies the axioms (i–iv) of Equations (11.6–9) is
suitable for proposition of the parameter estimation problem, so that it is not possible
to say that one objective function is better than another if both satisfy the axioms.
However, the objective function should also contain statistical meaning, which can be
regarded as a fifth technical requirement for function d(y∗, ye).
In order to introduce statistical meaning into the objective function it is convenient
to formulate some hypotheses. The first hypothesis is the perfect model assumption,
which considers that the proposed mathematical model explains the relationships
among the variables accurately. Based on this assumption, observed experimental
data and values calculated with the model are not equal because of unavoidable
experimental fluctuations, represented in the form:
ye = y∗+ ε
(11.10)
where ε represents the unknown experimental fluctuations. In fact, ε also contains
modeling errors and variability associated with the model predictions, which are
neglected at this point because model inaccuracies cannot be defined a priori with-
out meaningful comparison with available experimental data, and because there is no
reason to believe that the investigator is interested in a model that is known to be inad-
equate or incorrect. Therefore, although a perfect model does not exist, the perfect
model assumption seems to be appropriate for purposes of model building.
The second hypothesis is the perfect experiment assumption, which considers that
the collected experimental data represent accurately and precisely the real behav-
ior of the analyzed system. Therefore, the perfect experimental hypothesis assumes
that experimental fluctuations observed during the measurement stage are due to the
unavoidable uncertainties associated with the measurement process only, as discussed
in Section 1.9. Also, this assumption considers that the probability of finding the mea-
sured experimental values is maximum and that no other alternative set of experiments
would represent the analyzed system better.
Combining the perfect model and the perfect experiment assumptions, it becomes
possible to write:

y∗2

(11.11)
where E{■} represents the average of ■, so that the variance of the experimental data
can be written as:
s2
ye =
NE
i=1(ye
i −y∗
i )2
NE −NP
(11.12)
where NP is the number of estimated parameter values, in accordance with Equations
(1.9.1–2) of Section 1.9. The denominator of Equation (11.12) is related to the loss
of degrees of freedom when one uses an additional parameter to adjust available data
with a mathematical model (Himmelblau, 1970; Bard, 1974; Schwaab and Pinto,
2007). In Equation (11.12), s2

becomes natural to propose:
Fobj = d

NE −NP
(11.13)
or simply
Fobj =

i=1
(ye

(11.14)
Equations (11.13–14) satisfy the four previously proposed axioms of the distance
(objective function) and contains significant statistical meaning, as minimization of
Fobj is equivalent to assuming experimental fluctuations should not be higher than the
maximum admissible value, given the proposed hypotheses. Equation (11.14) is known
generically as the least-squares function, and estimation of parameter values through
minimization of Equation (11.14) is called as the least-squares estimation problem.
Example
E11.1 The widespread use of the least-squares procedure is associated with the fact that
it allows the development of analytical solutions when the model is linear in respect
to its parameters. For example, let us assume that:
y∗(x, α) =
NP

j=1
αjfj(x)
(11.15)
where fj(x) are functions of the input variables x (commonly named variable effects)
and αj are the model parameters. In this case:

The reader can observe that, although the estimated value of was close to the true
value of 2, the obtained parameter estimate was perturbed by the experimental errors.
When the least-squares procedure is considered, there is an implicit assumption
that experimental measurements are independent (that is, the uncertainties that affect

244
Chemical reaction engineering
a certain measurement do not simultaneously affect a second measurement) and con-
stant throughout the experimental region; otherwise, the use of Equations (1.9.1–2) of
Section 1.9 and of Equations (11.12–14) would not be possible (Schwaab and Pinto,
2007). However, actual measurement systems can provide data values that correlate
and be subject to errors that change with the experimental condition. In other words,
the uncertainties of temperature and pressure measurements can be correlated if, for
example, the measurements are affected by a common heat source placed at the sam-
pling process lines, for instance. Furthermore, high temperature values may be more
prone to measurement fluctuations than low temperature values due to heat dissipa-
tion to the environment. Therefore, there are many incentives for the formulation and
proposition of more involving objective functions, ones that can take these important
statistical effects into account (Larentis et al., 2003; Alberton et al., 2009; Da Ros
et al., 2017).
Although the development of distinct objective functions based on rigorous sta-
tistical principles falls beyond the scope of the present text, it is important to point
out that the maximum likelihood method can be used to formulate objective functions
that present different statistical properties for data measurements subject to uncertain-
ties (Schwaab and Pinto, 2007). Among the infinitely many objective functions that
can be formulated and adjusted to the characteristics of the particular measurements
being analyzed, those based on Gaussian behavior (or normal behavior) are the most
common. Skipping some formal aspects of the derivation, if the hypothesis of normal
behavior is added to the previous perfect model and perfect experiment assumptions,
then the following objective function can be proposed:
Fobj (α) =

ye −y∗(α)T V−1
y

ye −y∗(α)
(11.23)
where α is the vector of parameters (with dimension NP), ye is the vector of experimen-
tal measurements (with dimension NY × NE, where NE is the number of experiments
and NY is the number of responses at each individual experiment), y∗(α) is the vector
of model responses (with dimension NY × NE), and Vy is the covariance matrix of
measurement fluctuations, which has the general form:
Vy =

involved in the chemical reaction system being analyzed. The experimental data col-

Therefore, one can see that the calculation of Vy in Equation (11.23–25) is sim-
ple when replicated experiments are available. As one can also see above, matrix
Vy is not necessarily diagonal (that is, measurement fluctuations are not necessarily
independent and variables tend to fluctuate together, in response to similar sources of
perturbations, such as the unavoidable fluctuation of catalyst activity) and can contain

significantly different covariance values. For this reason, the hypothesis of independent
measurements and constant variances should always be evaluated carefully, especially
if convincing experimental replicates are not available.
Despite the results shown in Example 11.2, if it is assumed (or shown experimen-
tally, as advised) that measurement fluctuations are independent and not correlated to
each other, matrix Vy becomes diagonal and Equation (11.23) can be written in the
form:

(11.26)
which has the form of a weighted least-squares function whose weights are the exper-
imental variances of the obtained experimental responses. According to Equation
(11.26), the importance of the experimental response for computation of the objec-
tive function diminishes with the increase of the experimental variance, a fact that
makes a lot of sense. According to Equation (11.26), the most important experimental
points are the ones measured more precisely. Therefore, proper characterization of
experimental variances is extremely important when one is interested in explaining
available experimental data with help of a kinetic model. More interestingly, if a single
experimental response is considered (NY = 1) and all experimental variances are equal
(when all experiments are measured with the same precision), then Equation (11.26)
can be reduced to Equations (11.13–14), indicating that the least-squares procedure
is equivalent to the maximum likelihood procedure when measurement uncertainties
follow the normal behavior, sample variances are equal, measurement fluctuations
are independent, and perfect model and perfect experiment assumptions are good.
This clearly shows that the least-squares procedure should be used only after care-
ful thought about the statistical nature of available measurements! And, Equations
(11.23–26) explain why proper characterization of experimental uncertainties is so
important for quantitative analyses of actual kinetic data.
Example
E11.3 In order to illustrate the importance of proper characterization of experimen-
tal errors for quantitative analyses, a simple exercise is proposed below. Let us first
consider that a chemical reaction can be described in the form:
A
k1
→B
(11.27)
Assuming that the reaction is carried out in solution and in batch mode, then the
following set of mass balance equations can be written:
dCA
dt = −k1CA⇒CA = CA0e−k1t
(11.28a)
dCB
dt = k1CA = k1CA0e−k1t⇒CB = CA0

(11.28b)

where CA0 is the initial concentration of reactant A, and it is assumed that the initial
concentration of product B is equal to zero. It is also considered here that the following
set of experimental data are available:

The reader should observe that the sum of CA and CB is not CA0, due to the
unavoidable measurement fluctuations. In addition, the reader should observe that
the standard errors of the distinct measurements are not equal, due to the variation of
measurement performances in the experimental grid, and that the second experimental
point is measured with higher precision than the first. Based on the available data, the
following objective function can be proposed:
Fobj

(11.29)
Then, minimization of Equation (11.29) (which must be performed with help of
numerical methods, as discussed in the following sections) leads to k1 = 1.07 h−1.
Interestingly, if the experimental data are changed as:
t (h)

then minimization of Equation (11.29) leads to k1 = 0.72 h−1. One may wonder why
the parameter value changed if the concentration values remained the same. The
answer is provided by Figure 11.3. Although concentration values remained the same,
measurement precisions were different in both analyzed cases and the kinetic model
attempted to remain closer to the most precise experimental values, which makes a lot
of sense! Therefore, one should not neglect the proper characterization of experimen-
tal measurements during quantitative kinetic analyses, as obtained results can be quite
sensitive to variations in measurement precision.

in order to allow the derivation of an analytical solution for the problem proposed in
Example 11.3. As a matter of fact, similar strategies were suggested by many investi-
gators in the past, when computer resources were not so well developed as they are
today. In the case analyzed in Example 11.3, this “analytical’’ approach would prob-
ably lead to formulation of the following objective function and set of transformed

and leads to k1 = 1.03 h–1, which is different from both the values obtained in Example
11.5 and is not consistent with the measurement precision of observed experimental
responses.
As a matter of fact, for many reasons no one should feel compelled to transform
experimental data nowadays. First of all, computer resources and numerical techniques
have seen tremendous developments recently, so that the use of analytical solutions
that are based on gross approximations of the experimental scenario are no longer
necessary in many mathematical problems and therefore should be avoided. Besides, it
must be clear that the statistical nature of the measurement system can be completely
modified when experimental data are transformed. To illustrate this, let us assume that
a transformation of the measured data is proposed in the form:
z = f

y

(11.33)
where y is the measured experimental value (CA, for example) and z is the transformed
measured response (ln



, for example). f represents a mathematical function that
maps y into z (z = ln

y

, for example). Assuming y is subject to small fluctuations
of order dy (and this is an important assumption, as the likely occurrence of large
measurement deviations may render the proposed analysis even more complex), then
it becomes possible to write:
dz = df
dydy
(11.34)
tabulation can be used to interpret the transformation of statistical responses in
the form:

2

(11.35)
In other words, the function f transforms simultaneously the experimental data and the
respective statistical characteristics of the measurement system, leading to a completely
different estimation problem and to a distinct set of parameter estimates. This explains
why Equation (11.32) leads to a different kinetic rate constant value, when compared
to the results presented in Example 11.3. In the analyzed case:
dzA = 1

zA =

so that the uncertainty of the transformed variable zA increases when the measured
value of CA diminishes, while the opposite behavior is observed for the transformed
variable zB. Therefore, large absolute zA and zB values are not informative for purposes
of parameter estimation and should be properly weighed during numerical calculations.
Unless this artificial transformation effect is taken into consideration (which is very
rare in the field), as a rule of thumb the reader should always avoid the artificial manip-
ulation of experimental data and instead make use of available numerical procedures
for quantitative analyses whenever necessary.

lems is the transformation of the Arrhenius equation in the form:
z = ln

tabulation z and x are the transformed experimental variables and A and B are the
estimated model parameters. However, the real experimental variables are k and T,
which can be obtained with different error contents. Using simple error propagation

tabulation clearly show that the uncertainties of both z and x change considerably
in the experimental range, even when the precision of both k and T measurements
can be considered constant in the analyzed experimental grid. Therefore, the use of
Equation (11.37) and of estimation procedures based on Equation (11.37) should be
avoided whenever possible.
11.4
NUMERICAL MINIMIZATION OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
According to the definition of the objective function, Fobj(α) must be minimized
through manipulation of parameter values (α). Thus, it becomes necessary to choose a
suitable optimization method to determine the unknown value of α that leads Fobj(α) to
its minimum value. However, this can constitute a complex numerical task: the num-
ber of experimental data values (NE × NY) and model parameters (NP) can be large;
the proposed mathematical model can comprise a large set of nonlinear equations; the
model parameters can be highly correlated (as discussed afterwards); and the objective
function can present multiple local minima. For all these reasons, different numerical

251
approaches have been proposed for minimization of the objective function and esti-
mation of model parameters, as discussed in many scientific articles and textbooks
(Himmelblau, 1970; Bard, 1974; Schwaab and Pinto, 2007).
It is not intended to review this very wide area of knowledge in the present text.
Nevertheless, it is important to understand that the numerical methods employed most
often for estimation of kinetic parameters are based on derivative-based procedures
such as the Newton and the Gauss–Newton methods. According to these methods, min-
imization must be performed along a direction in the parameter space that combines
a gradient vector (the vector of first derivatives with respect to the model parameters,
which indicates the direction of fastest variation of Fobj(α)) and the Hessian matrix
(the matrix of second derivatives in respect to model parameters, which indicates the
curvature of Fobj(α) and is used to evaluate the point of minimum along the descend-
ing direction). On the other hand, direct search methods perform the minimization
of the objective function based only on sampling of Fobj(α), without calculation of
derivatives. Both gradient and direct search methods may be classified as local deter-
ministic search procedures, since the search starts from an initial parameter guess and
then evolves to a minimum, following an iterative trajectory that is determined by the
initial guess. For this reason, it must be emphasized that proper selection of a good
initial guess can be of fundamental importance to achieve convergence, which can
be a serious drawback of this class of numerical methods, since good initial guesses
are often unavailable in real kinetic problems. Additionally, these methods are not
able to discriminate between local and global minima, making it necessary to perform
the minimization several times, using different initial guesses in order to verify if the
calculated minimum point represents a global character.
The Newton method is based on the quadratic approximation of the objective
function and can be presented in the form:
αk+1 = αk −H−1
αk ∇fαk
(11.39)
where
∇fαk =

(11.41)
are respectively the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix of the objective function.
At the point of minimum of Fobj(α), the gradient vector is equal to zero, so that the
size of the gradient vector can be used as a convergence criterion to evaluate the rate
of convergence and the quality of the approximation. Given an initial guess for the
optimization variables, α0, Equation (11.39) must be employed recursively until the
convergence criterion is attained.
The main advantage of the Newton method is the fast rate of convergence when
the initial guess is sufficiently close to the unknown desired solution, something that

252

is unfortunately rare. Additionally, the method requires the calculation of first- and
second-order derivatives of Fobj(α) with respect to the NP searched parameters and the
inversion of the Hessian matrix at each numerical iteration. Even when the compu-
tation of the derivatives is performed numerically, through small perturbations of the
optimization variables around the analyzed guess, the calculation of derivatives can be
computationally expensive. This explains why many numerical procedures have been
developed to circumvent the calculation of derivatives and inversion of the Hessian
matrix. A popular alternative numerical approach consists in sampling the objec-
tive function around the initial guess and selecting the next guess as the sample that
provides the lowest value for the objective function. Additional information regard-
ing derivative-based and direct search methods can be found in standard parameter
estimation textbooks (Himmelblau, 1970; Bard, 1974; Schwaab and Pinto, 2007).
An additional group of optimization procedures that can be used for estimation
of kinetic parameters is formed by stochastic optimization algorithms. This group
includes many distinct techniques, including Monte Carlo procedure, genetic algo-
rithm, simulated annealing, differential evolution and particle swarm optimization
(PSO), among many others (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983; Goldberg, 1989; Kennedy and
Eberhart, 1995; Storn and Price, 1997; Schwaab et al., 2008; Schwaab and Pinto,
2007). These algorithms are characterized by the random character of the search and
the large number of evaluations of the objective function, which assure a high prob-
ability of finding the global point of minimum. Plus, these algorithms do not require
the definition of initial guesses for parameter values and do not use derivatives, mak-
ing the numerical performance more predictable and less dependent on the model
structure and experience of the analyst (Schwaab and Pinto, 2007). Despite that, it
is important to emphasize that stochastic optimization algorithms do not ensure that
the global minimum will indeed be attained and that these techniques can lead to very
low rates of convergence. This explains why hybrid optimization algorithms have been
proposed often (Schwaab et al., 2008). Hybrid algorithms associate the global search
characteristics of the stochastic algorithms (usually in the first stages of the iterative
numerical procedure) with the fast convergence features of the local search algorithms
(usually in the last stages of the numerical search, when good guesses are expected
to be available for parameter values). Nevertheless, the main advantage of stochastic
procedures is the fact that these techniques allow more rigorous statistical analyses of
parameter estimates, which can be very important in kinetic problems for reasons that
are discussed in the following sections.
According to typical stochastic procedures, the optimization process starts with the
random generation of Npt candidates in the parameter space. Each candidate is then
used for computation of Fobj(α) and afterwards the obtained results are ranked with
respect to the obtained objective function values (the best candidates are the ones that
lead to the smallest values of the objective function). Finally, the best set of candidates
is used to update the full list of candidates and the search region. The criteria used for
updating the list of candidates and search region constitute the main characteristics of
each considered stochastic procedure.

E11.5 A very simple and useful stochastic procedure is the Monte Carlo algorithm.
According to this technique, candidates must be initially generated within the search

i is the ith parameter candi-
date at iteration k, random () is a function that generates random numbers uniformly
in the interval [0, 1] and Ncand is the total number of candidates generated by the
numerical scheme. According to Equation (11.42), the parameters that characterize
the numerical procedure are α0
min, α0
max and Ncand, which define the search region and
the refinement of the numerical search. Then, the objective function must be computed
for each parameter candidate, resulting in an ordered list of Ncand parameter values
and respective objective function values. If the best candidate (αk
opt, the one that leads
to the smallest objective function value) is used as reference, then the search region

tabulation r is an additional numerical parameter (0 < r < 1) that characterizes the
contraction of the search region and controls the speed of convergence. Typically, r is
close to 0.9, as larger r values lead to slow convergence, while smaller r values lead to
inefficient exploration of the search region. After calculation of the new boundaries
of the search region, the procedure must be repeated. The iterative procedure must be
interrupted when the search region is sufficiently small or when the objective function
values stop changing significantly, according to an additional numerical parameter that
specifies the tolerance of the iterative scheme.
11.5
STATISTICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF MODEL ADEQUACY
After finding the minimum of the objective function, it becomes necessary to evaluate
the statistical significance of the obtained results. This evaluation must consider model
ability to explain available experimental data, quality of estimated model parameters
and uncertainty of model prediction.
As discussed in the previous sections, an important assumption considered the
model to be perfect. The quality of this hypothesis should be verified a posteriori, at
the end of the parameter estimation phase, by comparing the experimental data with
the model predictions. In short, the model cannot be discarded if differences between
model predictions and available data are comparable to the unavoidable fluctuations of
the experimental measurements. Once more, the reader should observe that the appro-
priate characterization of experimental fluctuations is of fundamental importance for

254

final evaluation of obtained results. For example, if the least-squares objective function
of Equation (11.14) is used to perform the estimation of the model parameters, then:
ˆs2
y =
Fobj
NE −NP
(11.44)
tabulation ˆs2
y is a measure of prediction variance, which can be compared with the
experimental variance, s2
y, with the help of the standard statistical F-test, as illustrated
in Equation (11.14) (Himmelblau, 1970; Bard, 1974; Schwaab and Pinto, 2007):

(11.45)
where 1 −ϕ represents the confidence level (for 99% confidence, ϕ = 0.01) and NE∗
NY – NP and NR – 1 represent the degrees of freedom of prediction variance and exper-
imental variance, respectively. The limits of the cumulative F distribution in Equation
(11.45) can be calculated with the help of standard functions provided by the vast
majority of commonly used spreadsheets. For example, in the Excel spreadsheet the
reader will find the functions DIST.F and INV.F, which can be used for computation
of the limits of Equation (11.45).
If the ratio between variances should fall within the acceptable interval, meaning
the variances are not considered statistically different within the specified level of
confidence, one may conclude that the perfect model assumption cannot be ruled out
and that the model is good. On the other hand, if the ratio between the variances
should fall outside the acceptable interval, meaning both variances can be considered
statistically different within the specified level of confidence, one may conclude that
two cases are possible.
When prediction variance is higher than experimental variance, it is possible to
conclude that the model is not able to explain the available data within the experimen-
tal precision, so that additional efforts should be made to improve model performance
(for instance, changing the kinetic rate equations). However, it can also indicate that
experimental errors have been underestimated (especially when a small number of repli-
cates is considered) and that efforts should be made to characterize the experimental
fluctuations more accurately. When model prediction variance is lower than experi-
mental variance, it is possible to conclude that model performance is unexpectedly
good, suggesting the model is possibly overparameterized and that efforts should be
made to improve model performance (for instance, reducing the number of parameters
in the kinetic rate equations). However, this result can also indicate superestimation
of experimental errors (especially when a small number of replicates is considered)
and that efforts should be made to characterize the experimental fluctuations more
accurately.
If the maximum likelihood function of Equations (11.23–26) is used to perform
the estimation of the model parameters, then the objective function can be interpreted
as the χ2 function in the form:
χ

2 )
NE∗NY−NP < Fobj < χ
2(1−φ
2 )
NE∗NY−NP
(11.46)

Determination of kinetic parameters through parameter estimation
255
The limits of the cumulative χ2 distribution in Equation (11.46) can also be calcu-
lated with help of standard functions provided by the vast majority of commonly used
spreadsheets. For example, in the Excel spreadsheet the reader will find the functions
DIST.CHI and INV.CHI, which can be used for computation of the limits of Equa-
tion (11.46). If the final objective function value falls within the acceptable interval,
meaning the differences between model responses and experimental data are accept-
able statistically within the specified level of confidence, then one may conclude that
the perfect model assumption cannot be ruled out and that the model is good. On the
other hand, if the final objective function value falls outside the acceptable interval,
then differences between model responses and experimental data are not acceptable
statistically within the specified level of confidence, so two cases are possible.
When the final objective function value is higher than the acceptable limit, it is
possible to conclude that the model is not able to explain the available data within the
experimental precision, so that additional efforts should be made to improve model
performance (for instance, changing the kinetic rate equations). However, as in the
previous case this outcome can also indicate that experimental errors have been under-
estimated (especially when a small number of replicates is considered) and that efforts
should be made to characterize the experimental fluctuations more accurately. When
the final objective function value is lower than the experimental variance, it is pos-
sible to conclude that the model performance is unexpectedly good, suggesting that
the model is possibly overparameterized and that efforts should be made to improve
model performance (for instance, reducing the number of parameters in the kinetic
rate equations). However, once more this can also indicate superestimation of exper-
imental errors (especially when a small number of replicates is considered) and that
efforts should be made to characterize the experimental fluctuations more accurately.
It is also common to report the correlation coefficient between model responses
and respective experimental outputs in the form:
ρ =
NE
i=1
NY
j=1(ye
i,j −¯ye
j )(y∗

(11.47)
The correlation coefficient ρ is a normalized form of the covariance (as defined
in Equation (11.47)), varying inside the interval [–1, 1]. When experimental and cal-
culated data are similar, ρ is close to 1 (in other words, experimental and calculated
data are correlated to each other). For this reason, when ρ is higher than 0.9, it is
normally assumed that the model is adequate; when ρ is lower than 0.7, it is normally
assumed that the model is poor. However, it must be observed that the correlation coef-
ficient does not take into account experimental fluctuations or the number of model
parameters, meaning that it must be employed with care. For example, high correla-
tion coefficients can indicate the occurrence of superparameterized models (and the
model should thus be regarded as poor). Additionally, low correlation coefficients
can indicate the occurrence of large measurement fluctuations (and the model thus
should not be blamed for the lack of fit). For these reasons, the correlation coefficient
should not be employed as a universal criterion for specification of model adequacy

256
Chemical reaction engineering
and should preferentially be combined with the other statistical analyses to provide a
more conclusive evaluation of model adequacy.
11.6
THE CONFIDENCE REGION OF PARAMETER ESTIMATES
Generally speaking, a good kinetic model should be able to explain the available exper-
imental data within the precision of the measurements and simultaneously rely on
parameters that are statistically significant (in other words, are statistically different
from zero) and independent from each other (in other words, parameters whose val-
ues can be determined independently from the values of the remaining parameters).
As shown in Section 5.6, parameters can be subject to uncertainties because of the
unavoidable occurrence of experimental fluctuations; however, in some cases param-
eter uncertainties can be so large that the model parameters can be confused with
the null value. In other cases, estimated parameter values can be correlated strongly,
meaning that modification of one parameter of the model can be compensated by the
manipulation of the remaining model parameters, making the proper understanding of
variable effects uncertain. Furthermore, the existence of high correlation between some
of the model parameters can introduce severe numerical difficulties into the parameter
estimation problem, usually resulting from an inappropriate mathematical represen-
tation of the model, poor experimental design or the intrinsic nonlinear nature of the
system (Schwaab et al., 2007; Schwaab and Pinto, 2008).
In order to evaluate the points raised in the previous paragraph, it is necessary to
determine first the confidence region of the parameter estimates; in other words, the
region of the parameter space where parameter values can be regarded as statistically
acceptable. The parameter estimates are significant when the confidence region (within
the specified confidence level) does not contain the null value.
Parameter uncertainties and parameter correlations can be calculated with the
help of the covariance matrix of the parameters estimates, Vα. The meaning of Vα
is similar to the meaning of the covariance matrix of measured model responses, as
defined in Equation (11.24), replacing the experimental measurement fluctuations by
the parameter uncertainties (caused by the experimental uncertainties). Omitting the
technical details, the covariance matrix of parameter uncertainties can be shown to
present the approximate form (Himmelblau, 1970; Bard, 1974; Schwaab and Pinto,
2007):
Vα = 2H−1
α
(11.48)
tabulation Hα is the Hessian matrix defined in Equation (11.41). Therefore,
Equation (11.48) establishes a clear connection between the characteristics of the esti-
mation problem (objective function, model, experimental errors) and the precision of
the model parameters. Even more interestingly, when model sensitivity to variation
of model parameters increases (derivatives become larger), parameter uncertainties
decrease (as Vα is proportional to the inverse of Hα). Therefore, Equation (11.48)
reinforces the importance of having a proper definition for the objective function and
indicates that the functional representation of the model affects the quality of the
obtained model parameters, as proposed by distinct reparameterization techniques. It
must be emphasized that the main diagonal of the covariance matrix Vα contains the

Determination of kinetic parameters through parameter estimation
257
variances of the parameter estimates, while the off-diagonal elements of Vα characterize
the covariances between pairs of parameters, which measure the degrees of dependence
among the parameter estimates. In an ideal estimation problem, the obtained covari-
ance matrix of parameter estimates, Vα, should be diagonal, as model parameters
are expected to be independent of each other. However, Equation (11.48) shows that
this ideal result is rarely obtained. As a matter of fact, the correlation ρij between
parameters i and j can be defined as:
ρij =
vij
√viivjj
(11.49)
tabulation vij is the element of the ith row and jth column of matrix Vα. The closer
the absolute value of ρij is to 1, the worse the quality of the obtained model parameters
is. It can be proposed heuristically that absolute values of ρij lie below 0.7.
Calculation of Hα and Vα at the end of the estimation process also allows the
determination of confidence intervals for the parameter estimates with the help of the
Student’s t-distribution, as shown in the form:
αi ± t
1−ϕ
2
NY·NE−NP (vii)
1
2
(11.50)
where t
1−ϕ
2
NY·NE−NP is the t value of the Student’s t-distribution, defined for NY·NE −NP
degrees of freedom and cumulative probability of 1 −ϕ
2. As reported before, 1 −ϕ
represents the confidence level (for confidence of 99%, ϕ is equal to 0.01). The limits of
the Student’s t-distribution in Equation (11.50) can be calculated with help of standard
functions provided by the vast majority of commonly used spreadsheets. For example,
in the Excel spreadsheet the reader will find the functions DIST.T and INV.T, which
can be used for computation of the limits of Equation (11.50).

Equations (11.52–53) show explicitly that the uncertainties of the model param-
eters depend on the available data points, on the mathematical structures of the
proposed objective function and kinetic model and also on the experimental preci-
sion. As one can see, the calculations associated with the determination of parameter
uncertainties can be quite complex even in very simple kinetic problems; therefore,
investigators involved with kinetic modeling and determination of kinetic parameters
should be encouraged to develop fundamental programming skills and to rely on the
support of appropriate computer software.
In order to illustrate how the formulation of the estimation problem can affect
the calculation of parameter uncertainties and distort the statistical significance of the
obtained estimates, Equation (11.31) is also used to calculate Vα. In this case:

The differences between Equations (11.52) and (11.55) are enormous!! This
shows once more that the estimation problem should not be manipulated only to
allow the derivation of analytical expressions, without sound comprehension of
the consequences for interpretation of the statistical significance of the obtained
parameters.
Finally, for the sake of completeness, in case 1 of Example 11.3, 0.548 h–1 < k1=
1.072 h–1 < 1.596 h–1; in case 2 of Example 11.3, 0.126 h–1 < k1= 0.715 h–1 < 1.304 h–1;
and in the case of Equation (11.31), 0.022 h–1 < k1= 1.028 h–1 < 2.034 h–1. To perform
the calculations, it was necessary to define the confidence level (assumed to be equal to

Determination of kinetic parameters through parameter estimation
259
95%, so that ϕ = 0.05) and the degrees of freedom (NE ∗NY −NP = 2 ∗2 −1 = 3).
Thus, in this case the t value becomes equal to 3.18, as calculated with the cumulative
Student’s t-distribution in the Excel spreadsheet. The reader must observe that the
parameter estimate is significant in all cases within the established confidence level of
95%, as the confidence intervals do not include the null value.
Although the computation of confidence limits for model parameters can be
important for statistical interpretation of the actual physical meaning of the obtained
parameter estimates, confidence limits calculated with Equations (11.48–50) are rough
approximations of the real confidence limits of the parameters. This is because deriva-
tion of Equation (11.48) assumes that measurement fluctuations are small and because
Equation (11.50) neglects the correlations among the many possible model parameters
(Himmelblau, 1970; Bard, 1974; Schwaab and Pinto, 2007). For these reasons, param-
eter uncertainties can be characterized better when confidence regions, rather than
confidence intervals, can be computed. The confidence region of parameter estimates
can be defined as the set of all parameter values that can provide model predictions
comparable to the available experimental data, within the specified statistical level of
confidence.
Assuming the objective function can be approximated around the point of mini-
mum by a quadratic function, as described in Equations (11.56–57), where represents
the parameter estimates:
Fobj(α) ∼= Fobj(ˆα) + (α −ˆα)T ∂Fobj
∂α
+ 1
2(α −ˆα)THˆα(α −ˆα)
(11.57)
Fobj (α) −Fobj(ˆα) ∼= (α −ˆα)TV−1
α (α −ˆα)
(11.58)
The right-hand side of Equation (11.57) represents an ellipsoid in the parameter
space, justifying the usual assumption that the confidence region of parameter estimates
has the shape of an ellipsoid (which can only be confirmed when Equations (11.56–
57) provide good local approximations of the objective function, which is usually
not the case!). If one assumes that parameter values follow the Gaussian distribution
(which must not be true either!), the right-hand side of Equation (11.57) defines the
chi-square variable computed with NP degrees of freedom (Himmelblau, 1970; Bard,
1974; Schwaab and Pinto, 2007). Consequently, the confidence region of the parameter
estimates can be calculated in the form:
(α −ˆα)TV−1
α (α −ˆα) ≤X2(1−φ)
NP
(11.59)
After minimization of Fobj(α) and calculation of ˆα, V−1
α
and X2(1−φ)

, parameter values
that satisfy Equation (11.58) can be obtained, reported and plotted. However, as the
covariance matrix of experimental fluctuations Vy is usually characterized poorly (or
is even unknown) and the covariance matrix of parameter estimates represents only
a rough approximation of the true matrix Vα, Equation (11.58) is usually presented

in alternative forms, such as (Himmelblau, 1970; Bard, 1974; Schwaab and Pinto,

(11.61)
The use of Equations (11.58–60) is facilitated tremendously by stochastic proce-
dures, such as the Monte Carlo algorithm presented in Example 11.4, as many samples
(often thousands of samples) of Fobj (α) and respective values of α become available
after convergence. This can be regarded as a major advantage of most stochastic algo-
rithms employed for estimation of kinetic parameters. Additionally, it is important
to emphasize that Equation (11.60) does not make use of the quadratic approxima-
tion of Equation (11.56), which allows the computation of more realistic nonelliptical
confidence regions of parameter estimates than the ones computed with Equations
(11.58–59). The reader must observe that the continual development of computer
resources is promoting the fast and simultaneous development of numerical tech-
niques used for characterization of kinetic parameters, so that this particular area
of knowledge now constitutes an effervescent field of investigation.
Example
E11.7 The estimation problem proposed in Example 11.3 was solved once more with
help of a Monte Carlo procedure. The parameter k1 was searched in the interval [0, 2]
and 1000 candidates were used at each iteration to perform the numerical search.
The adopted absolute numerical tolerance was set to 0.001 both for the size of the
search region and the modification of the objective function. Finally, the contraction
rate was set to 0.9. Based on the data reported in Example 11.3, NE ∗NY −NP = 3
and NP = 1. Assuming a confidence level of 95% (ϕ = 0.05), then according to the
cumulative F-distribution available in the Excel spreadsheet:

approximation.

UNCERTAINTIES OF MODEL PREDICTIONS
After evaluation of model adequacy and quality of model parameters, it becomes nec-
essary to characterize the intrinsic uncertainties of the predictions provided by the
model. Given the uncertainties of the parameter estimates and the use of the param-
eters for calculation of model responses, it seems clear that model responses are also
uncertain to some extent. In particular, if one assumes that parameter uncertainties are
small (and Figure 6 shows that uncertainties can be large), it is possible to write:
ˆVy = BVαBT + Vy
(11.63)
where ˆVy is the covariance matrix of model responses and
B =

(11.64)
so that matrix B contains model sensitivities to changes of parameter estimates (Him-
melblau, 1970; Bard, 1974; Schwaab and Pinto, 2007). Based on the covariance matrix
of model responses, the confidence intervals of model predictions can be defined as:

Chemical reaction engineering
As described previously for the parameter estimates, Equations (11.62–63) assume
that measurement fluctuations are small, while Equation (11.64) neglects correlations
among the many possible model responses (Himmelblau, 1970; Bard, 1974; Schwaab
and Pinto, 2007). For these reasons, the uncertainties of model responses can be charac-
terized better when confidence regions (rather than confidence intervals) of parameter
estimates are considered. In this case, if stochastic parameter estimation procedures
are used, execution of this task becomes relatively simple, as all parameter candidates
that satisfy Equation (11.60), for instance, can be used to calculate the respective
model responses, which are statistically meaningful model outputs that belong to the
confidence region of model predictions.
Example
E11.8 The estimation problem proposed in Example 11.3 and solved in Example 11.7
with help of a Monte Carlo procedure led to the confidence regions of parameter
estimates shown in Figure 11.4. The parameter values shown in Figure 11.4 were then
used for computation of the model outputs, leading to the model prediction boundaries
presented in Figure 11.5, which constitute the confidence regions of model responses
for cases 1 and 2.

and E is the activation energy. Tref is an arbitrary reference value that can be used to
normalize the Arrhenius equation.
Using the numerical tools presented in the previous sections, Schwaab and Pinto
(2007b) and Schwaab et al. (2008) investigated the estimation of A and E in different
temperature-dependent kinetic problems. Particularly, A and E were estimated for the
problem presented in Example 11.3, assuming that concentrations of species A were
available at different reaction temperatures and using the usual least-squares objective
function of Equation (11.14). The authors were able to show both analytically and
numerically that there always is an optimum value of Tref that allows the estimation
of model parameters with minimum correlation and maximum precision and that
this Tref value is placed inside the interval [Tmin, Tmax], where Tmin and Tmax are the
minimum and maximum experimental temperatures used to generate the experimental
data employed in the estimation procedure.
In order to illustrate the points raised in the previous paragraph, Figure 11.6 shows
the effect of Tref on the parameter correlation between A and E in Equation (3.3) for a
certain set of experimental data, clearly showing that the parameters can be estimated
independently if Tref is selected appropriately. In other words, Figure 11.6 clearly shows

the point where the error contents of both parameters are minimum, showing that

more precise model parameters, which is certainly important for practical purposes,
as parameters are expected to be as precise as possible. Furthermore, Figures 11.8 and

provided by a stochastic parameter estimation procedure. Particularly, Figure 11.8
shows that the elliptical approximations can indeed provide poor approximations of
the real confidence regions of the parameter estimates, as discussed before. However,
Figure 11.9 shows once more that proper manipulation of the parametric form of the
model can allow the estimation of smaller and well-behaved confidence regions of
model parameters, reinforcing the possible benefits of investigating the use of different
parameterized versions of kinetic rate models.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
In Chapter 11, the parameter estimation problem was presented and used to estimate
kinetic rate constants in kinetic problems. As discussed in previous sections, the param-
eter estimation procedure comprises three main stages: (i) definition of the objective
function; (ii) minimization of the objective function; and (iii) statistical analyses of the
obtained results. Mathematical tools were then developed and used to perform the
tasks of the different estimation steps. Particularly, the maximum likelihood method
was presented as a powerful technique to estimate kinetic rate parameters, combining
experimental data, model equations and statistical characteristics of the measuring
system. As a matter of fact, it was shown that the precise determination of experi-
mental fluctuations is of fundamental importance for model building, evaluation of
model adequacy, characterization of parameter quality and determination of confi-
dence regions for both model parameters and model responses. Finally, it was shown
that proper manipulation of the parametric form of the model can allow the estimation
of independent and more precise model parameters, encouraging the development of
different parameterized versions of kinetic rate models.


Chapter 12
Experimental design
In Chapter 11, the parameter estimation problem was presented and discussed. Partic-
ularly, it was assumed in Chapter 11 that both the experimental kinetic data and the
kinetic model were available. Nevertheless, the mathematical structure of the model
and the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variables are usually
unknown during the earlier stages of an experimental kinetic study. At these initial
stages, very frequently it is not even known which variables in a set can indeed affect
the analyzed process responses. In these cases, the use of statistical techniques for pro-
posal of experimental designs can be quite helpful (Box et al., 1978; Montgomery and
Runger, 2002; Schwaab and Pinto, 2011).
Statistical experimental design constitutes families of experimental design pro-
cedures that attempt to maximize some sort of metrics that depend on previous
knowledge about the analyzed experimental system and the main result the analyst
seeks. As a consequence, the number of distinct design procedures is enormous, so it is
not possible to review this entire area in a single chapter of one book. Nevertheless, in
the following sections some fundamental aspects of statistical experimental design are
discussed, so that the interested reader will be able to characterize the most important
features of the particularly analyzed kinetic problem and feel encouraged to search for
additional information in the open literature.
In order to organize the presentation of the following sections, four fundamental
experimental design problems are considered:
1.
Problems where the analyst does not know the effects caused by experimental
design variables (x) on response variables (y), so that the investigator wants to
characterize the influence of input variables on response variables with maximum
precision with help of NE designed experiments (x1 x2 . . ., xNE);
2.
Problems where the analyst does know the reference kinetic model that must be
used to describe a particular kinetic problem and wants to design a batch of NE
experiments (x1 x2 …, xNE) that can allow the estimation of model parameters
(α) with maximum precision;

Problems where the analyst has already performed NE experiments (x1 x2 …,
xNE), has selected a reference model to describe a particular kinetic problem
yM(x, αM) and wants to define the most precise set of model parameters through
sequential experimentation and selection of one additional experiment (xNE+1)
Almost certainly, the reader will be able to fit the analyzed problem into one of
these four large families, as described in the following sections.
12.1
FACTORIAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
When the analyst does not know the effects caused by experimental design variables
(x) on response variables (y), the main objective of the investigation probably is the
characterization of influence of input variables on response variables with maximum
precision, with the help of NE designed experiments (x1 x2 …, xNE). In this case, the
main objective of the experimental study is the determination of correlations among
input variables (in kinetic problems, usually temperature, pressure, catalyst composi-
tions, contact time, spatial velocity, time and feed compositions) and process responses
(in kinetic problems, usually reaction rates, selectivities, reaction yields and product
compositions). Therefore, x is a vector of NX inputs and y is a vector of NY responses.
The experimental design procedure must then provide a set of NE experimental con-
ditions (x1 x2 …, xNE) for determination of the influential effects of experimental
variables on outputs. Thus, the main product of the experimental design procedure is
a spreadsheet X that contains a set of experimental conditions of the form:
X =
⎡
⎢⎣
x1,1 . . . x1,NE
...
...
...
xNX,1 . . . xNX,NE
⎤
⎥⎦
NX×NE
(12.1)
In classical factorial experimental designs, experimental conditions (experimental
condition for variable i at experiment j) must be uniformly distributed over the exper-
imental region. Therefore, the analyst must provide the range of feasible experimental
conditions for each variable x(i,min ) and x(i,max ), i = 1, . . . , NX, and the experiments are
selected as all possible combinations among the selected variable levels (experimental
conditions) of the independent manipulated variables. Consequently, the investigator
must also provide the number of variable levels NLi for each input variable.
Example
E12.1 In a certain kinetic problem, the investigator wants to determine how reaction
yield (Y) responds to modification of reaction temperature (T), reaction pressure (P)
and contact time (θ). Therefore, in this case:

Although factorial designs are quite simple and seem somehow natural, the fact
is they rely on a solid theoretical structure, and they can be very helpful. In order
to provide the desired correlations among the analyzed variables, empirical linear
correlation models are normally used to perform the initial correlation analyses, as
described in Example 11.1 of Chapter 11, in the form:
yM(x, α) =
NP

j=1
αjfj(x)
(12.2)

Vα = 2M−1
(12.6)
In Equation (12.2), αj is an empirical model parameter that measures the relative
importance of the experimental effect fj (x). Usually, Equation (12.2) is presented in
the particular form:
yM (x, α) = a0 +
NX

i=1
aixi +
NX

i=1

j>i
bijxixj
(12.7)
where parameter a0 (bias) is associated with the effect f (x) = 1; parameters ai,
i = 1, . . ., NX (linear main effects) are associated with the effects fi(x) = xi; and param-
eters bi,j, i = 1, . . . , NX, j > i (synergetic, interaction or nonlinear effect) are associated
with the effects fi(x) = xixj.
The extremely important property of Equations (12.3–7) is the fact that the design
matrix M (and therefore the covariance matrix of model parameters Vα) is diagonal
in factorial designs, allowing the independent determination of the model parameters
(and respective variable effects). For this reason, factorial experimental designs in the
form of Equations (12.3–7) are called orthogonal designs. However, in order to obtain
orthogonal designs, it is necessary first to reparameterize the model equations in the
form:
yM (z, α) = a0 +
NX

i=1
aizi +
NX

i=1

j>i

(12.8)
with
zi = xi −

 xmax−xmin

(12.9)
Reparameterization of the model can be fundamental for quantitative analyses for
many practical reasons: (i) it allows for calculation of independent model parameters;
(ii) it removes physical units of model parameters and variables, allowing direct com-
parison of obtained parameter values; and (iii) it allows objective ordering of input
variables in terms of relative influence on process responses, as shown in the following
examples.

Chemical reaction engineering
One important problem associated with standard factorial experimental design is
the resulting large number of experiments (NE), equal to:
NE =
NX
;
i=1
NLi
	
NR
(12.10)
tabulation NR is the number of replicates at each experimental point, which must
be equal throughout the experimental grid to assure the orthogonal properties of the
final experimental design. This can lead to explosive growth of NE, as NX and NLi
increase. For instance, in Example 12.1 NE becomes equal to 81 if NL1 = NL2 = NL3
= NR = 3. For this reason, Schwaab and Pinto (2011) recommended the use of NL
= 2, when the investigator is interested in determining the coefficients of Equations
(12.8–9), or NL = 3, when the investigator is also interested in the determination of
quadratic coefficients in the form:
yM (z, α) = a0 +
NX

i=1
aizi +
NX

i=1

j>i
bijzizj +
NX

i=1
ciz2
i
(12.11)
The use of quadratic coefficients can be important in problems that are associ-
ated with the optimization of experimental responses and in which the occurrence
of points of maximum or minimum must be found during the investigation. Particu-
larly, Schwaab and Pinto (2011) showed that the precision of the model parameters of
Equations (12.8–9) increases very slowly with NL, so that the use of NL > 2 is almost
always difficult to explain.
In order to reduce the number of experimental points in the design, it is important
to observe that factorial designs contain fractions that are also orthogonal and that
also allow the computation of independent model parameters. For instance, when
NL = 2, factorial designs can be divided sequentially into two parts of equal size that
remain orthogonal, giving birth to fractional factorial designs, represented in the form
2NX−Nd, where Nd is the number of sequential divisions imposed on the original plan.
The repartition of the original plan is possible while NE = 2NX−Nd > NX (Schwaab
and Pinto, 20011). Obviously, as the number of experimental points is reduced, the
number of model effects that can be observed with the empirical model must also be
reduced, to assure the existence of appropriate degrees of freedom for the estimation
problem and also because some experimental effects become confounded, as observed
in Example 12.3.
Example
E12.3 In Example 12.1, when NL = 2 for all variables, the experimental design
becomes:
NL =

where T is given in ◦C, P in atm and θ in min. In order to obtain a uniform distribution

tabulation NE = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 experiments (or 24, if each experiment is replicated
three times for computation of experimental variances). One must observe that the
original full factorial design can be split into two halves that contain four experiments
(NE = 4 > 3 = NX) of the form:
Z1 =
⎡
⎣
−1

⎦
In the case of the full factorial design, the following empirical model can be used for
quantitative analyses:
yM = a0 + a1z1 + a2z2 + a3z3 + b13z1z2 + b13z1z3 + b23z2z2
tabulation the empirical model used as reference must be much smaller when the
fractional experimental design is proposed:
yM = a0 + a1z1 + a2z2 + a3z3
Therefore, repartition of the experimental design imposes the necessary simplifi-
cation of the quantitative analyses. Besides, it is easy to show that in the fractional
factorial plan Z1, z1 = −z2z3, z2 = −z1z3 and z3 = −z1z2. This means that synergetic
effects are confounded with the linear main effects in the simpler Z1 experimental
design, indicating that the experimenter will not be able to calculate the synergetic

274

effects and that, if they do exist, they will be interpreted as the effect of another dif-
ferent variable. Similarly, it is easy to show that in the fractional factorial plan Z2,
z1 = z2z3, z2 = z1z3 and z3 = z1z2.
As illustrated in Example 12.3, one important issue to consider when proposing
the use of fractional factorial experimental design is the proper characterization of
confounding and understanding which variable effects can indeed be calculated with
the empirical model of Equations (12.8–9). In order to do this, most textbooks, spread-
sheets and statistical applications provide tables and intrinsic functionalities that can
be used to characterize the confounding of variable effects.
Example
E12.4 A simple technique that can be used to characterize confounding is computation
of correlation matrixes. In this case, each analyzed effect must be associated with a
virtual variable, as shown below for plans Z and Z1:

An additional point to be emphasized is the fact that experiments must be repli-
cated to provide experimental precision, as described in Sections 1.8 and 1.9. Although
replication of all experiments constitutes a sound experimental strategy, this can lead to
a significant increase in experimental effort. In order to reduce the number of replicates
and simultaneously keep the orthogonality of the experimental plan, most experimen-
tal designs include the center of the experimental region as an additional experiment
that must be performed and replicated. In this case, the experimental errors are nor-
mally assumed to be the same throughout the experimental grid and equal to the value
provided by the replicated central condition, which frequently constitutes a strong
simplifying assumption about the behavior of experimental variances and should be
considered carefully by the analyst.

Before finishing this section, it is important to observe that, whenever possible,
the experiments in experimental design should be performed in random order to avoid
confounding with uncontrolled external effects and the undesired capturing of external
effects by estimated model parameters.

276
Chemical reaction engineering
Example
E12.6 In Example 12.5, let us assume the experiments are performed in the exact order
in which they are presented. Let us also assume that contamination of the feed lines
takes place after the fifth experiment and goes unnoticed by the investigator. Then,
as reaction yields decrease after the fifth experiment, quantitative analysis concludes
that reaction yields tend to decrease with temperature, as the last six experiments
are performed at higher temperature levels. This is certainly incorrect and does not
represent the real effect of temperature on yields but rather the effect of confounding
between the reaction temperature and the undesired and unmeasured contamination
effect.
Example
E12.7 One might argue about the necessity to implement factorial design plans instead
of the usual one-variable-a-time plan (or cross design). For instance, in Example 12.1,
let us assume that a cross design approach is used. Then, the following design can be
assumed:

that clearly indicates that synergetic effects cannot be computed and that the proposed
design is unable to capture the existence of nonlinear interaction effects among the
many variables of the system. As a matter of fact, cross designs can only be useful
during the very early stages of experimental analyses, for initial screening of variable
effects, or when determination of individual quadratic coefficients is recommended for
further modeling purposes. As factorial designs explore the experimental region much
more efficiently and allow the determination of synergetic effects, the use of factorial
design approaches is normally much more effective for quantitative analyses than are
cross designs. Despite that, it is typical to combine cross design and factorial design
when determination of individual quadratic coefficients is sought.
The interested reader is strongly encouraged to consult the literature for illustrative
examples of applications of factorial experimental design in kinetic problems (Nele et
al., 1999; Larentis et al., 2001; Bhering et al., 2002; Larentis et al., 2003). Example
12.8 illustrates the use of factorial design for interpretation of kinetic problems.
Example
E12.8 Matos et al. (2001) studied the effects of reaction operation conditions on slurry
propylene polymerizations performed with a standard Ziegler–Natta catalyst. In order
to carry out the experimental study, the authors proposed a 27−4 fractional factorial
experimental design (7 variables at 2 experimental levels, with 4 sequential repartitions
of the original full factorial design) with replicates at the central point, as described in
Table 12.1.
Before using the data for quantitative evaluations, it is important to emphasize
some relevant practical points related to Table 12.1:
1.
Design variables were selected a priori, based on previous knowledge of the
authors, and included P (propylene partial pressure, as propylene is the main
reactant and P reflects variations of the reactant concentration), PH2 (hydro-
gen partial pressure, as hydrogen is known to affect the catalyst activity), T
(reaction temperature), [Ti] (the titanium concentration in the slurry), A/T1 (the
ratio between aluminum and titanium molar concentrations in the mixture, as
provided by a first aluminum compound that activates the catalyst), t (reaction
time, as it is not possible to take samples from the reactor during the reaction
course) and A/T2 (the ratio between aluminum and titanium molar concentra-
tions in the mixture, as provided by a first aluminum compound that activates
the catalyst);
2.
Experimental conditions were defined in accordance with the reparameterized
plan presented in Table 12.2;
3.
Experiment H0 was an industrial reference, included in the plan to allow the
direct comparison with the plant performance and industrial validation of the
obtained results;
4.
All experiments were replicated at least twice, although experiment H6 had to
be interrupted because of excessive production of polymer material, flooding the
reactor and indicating that it should not be repeated;

The reference experiment H0 was used as a blank (which most frequently is the
role of the central point) and was repeated several times during the execution of
the plan to ensure that the catalyst remain active;

6.
Experiments H9 and H10 were used as central points, because hydrogen par-
tial pressure behaved as a discrete variable for experimental reasons (absence
or presence of hydrogen) and could not be manipulated to provide the mean
pressure value of 0.5 kgf/cm2;
7.
Experiment H9 was replicated four times in order to better characterize the
experimental variances;
8.
As recommended, experiments were performed in random order, to prevent the
inclusion of external effects on the quantitative analyses;
9.
The apparent high number of experiments (60) was due to the execution of other
simultaneous experimental studies in the same experimental unit;
10.
The main process response was the polymer yield (y = Pol).
Based on Table 12.1, the variance of the measured polymer yields was calculated
in the form:
s2
Pol =
10
i=1 (NRi −1) s2
i
10
i=1 (NRi −1)

i=1 (NRi −1) NRi
k=1
(yki−yi)
2
(NRi−1)
10
i=1 (NRi −1)
= 371g2
tabulation NRi represents the number of replicates of experimental condition i, and
yki represents the kth measurement available for experimental condition i. Therefore,
assuming measurement fluctuations follow the normal distribution and that the degree
of confidence is equal to 95% (see Sections 1.8 and 1.9):
ε = ±2s = ±39g
As the original factorial plan was partitioned four times, the experimental designs
presented in Tables 12.1 and 12.2 do not allow the independent calculation of syner-
getic effects (total of 21), as they are confounded with the main linear effects (total
of 7). According to the model presented in Equation (12.11):
yM = a0 + a1z1 + a2z2 + a3z3 + a4z4 + a5z5 + a6z6 + a7z7
yM = (342 ± 21) + (35 ± 27) z1 + (−32 ± 21) z2 + (151 ± 26) z3
+ (110 ± 25) z4 + (−76 ± 25) z5 + (137 ± 28) z6 + (−34 ± 25) z7
Therefore, all analyzed variable effects are significant (as the confidence intervals
of model parameters do not include the 0), indicating that the prior knowledge of
the authors was important for proper selection of the input variables. Besides, the
observed effects indicate that P (z1), T (z3), [Ti] (z4) and t (z6) exert positive effects on
the polymer yields, as it might already be expected, as yields normally increase when
reactant concentrations, reaction temperatures, catalyst concentrations and reaction
times increase. On the other hand, the observed effects indicate that PH2 (z2), A/T1 (z5)
and A/T2 (z7) exert negative effects on the process response, so that the operation levels
of these variables should not be kept above levels required to achieve desired process
performances. For instance, PH2 controls the average molecular weight of the product
and must increase when products of smaller molecular weights are desired, imposing
the increase of the catalyst concentration if polymer yields should remain constant.

280
Chemical reaction engineering
On the other hand, as both A/T1 and A/T2 are needed to activate the catalyst system,
some sort of optimization of the catalyst system formulation must be performed to
assure maximum possible catalyst activity. Finally, based on the process responses,
reaction temperature can be regarded as the most influential process variable in the
analyzed experimental region, as the respective model parameter was found to be
the largest one, followed by reaction time and catalyst concentration. As said before,
direct comparison of obtained parameters can only be carried out because the model
was calculated in the reparameterized form, after removal of the physical units of the
input variables.
12.2
OPTIMAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN FOR PARAMETER
ESTIMATION
A different family of experimental design comprises techniques that are usually named
as optimal experimental designs. In this case, the analyst normally knows the reference
kinetic model that must be used to describe a particular kinetic problem (perhaps
owing to his or her previous experience in the field) and wants to design a batch of
NE experiments (x1 x2 . . ., xNE) that can allow the estimation of model parameters (α)
of the reference model with maximum precision. In a certain sense, factorial design
can also be regarded as optimal experimental design for Equations (12.8–9), although
these equations lack physical meaning. Besides, optimal experimental designs are more
general than factorial designs, because a smaller number of assumptions are imposed
on the design problem.
From a mathematical point of view, optimal designs search for NE experiments
(x1 x2 …, xNE) that allow the maximization of a certain performance index defined
in the experimental region. Therefore, the experimental design becomes equivalent
to an optimization problem, where the manipulated variables are the experimental
conditions (Box et al., 1978; Edgar and Himmelblau, 1988; Montgomery and Runger,
2002; Schwaab and Pinto, 2011). The performance index is usually related to the
quality of the obtained model parameters, as described by the covariance matrix of
model parameters, in accordance with Equation (11.48) of Chapter 11 in the form:
Vα = 2H−1
α
(12.12)
which can be reduced to the form:

tabulation the standard least-squares objective function is used for estimation of
model parameters and derivatives of higher orders are neglected (Box et al., 1978;
Montgomery and Runger, 2002; Schwaab and Pinto, 2011).
Performance indexes (J) are generally formulated in the form:
J1 = min
x1, . . . , xNE det (Vα)
(12.15)
J2 = min
x1, . . . , xNE trace (Vα)
(12.16)
tabulation propose the minimization of the parameter variances (or maximization
of the parameter precision). Optimization of Equations (12.15–16) can be compu-
tationally expensive, especially when the number of designed experiments (NE) is
large and experimental regions are not regular. However, the ability to handle arbi-
trary NE values and irregular experimental regions constitutes a major advantage of
optimal experimental designs when compared to factorial experimental plans. Fur-
ther, in order to facilitate a design problem, most problems assume that the designed
experiments (x1 x2 . . ., xNE) must be selected from a pool of candidate experiments
(x1 x2 . . ., xNG>NE) selected a priori by the investigator, according to previous expe-
rience and limitations of the experimental setup. This way, optimization must be
performed in a discrete set of candidate design plans (Nplan), whose number is equal
to:
Nplan =
 NG
NE

(12.17)
so that Nplan is the combination of NG candidate experiments in sets of NE exper-
iments. The combinatorial nature of the optimization procedure can constitute a
numerical difficulty that must be tackled when NG and NE values are large, and
this can be regarded as a major disadvantage of the proposed procedure, especially
because factorial designs can be proposed easily. Another disadvantage is the neces-
sity to provide the reference model and to compute model derivatives, which can be
difficult in more involved kinetic analyses.

As the proposed problem involves a single kinetic parameter, performance indexes
presented in Equations (12.15–16) are equal. In this case, minimization of the proposed
performance index is equivalent to maximization of:
J = max

The first equation cannot be satisfied, because all variables are positive, indicating
that the point of optimality is a boundary of the experimental region. In this case,
maximization of J clearly imposes the use of the highest possible values of CA0. This
makes sense, as the increase of CA0 leads to higher rates of reaction and more precise
determination of the kinetic rate constant. On the other hand, assuming that NE = 1,
it becomes clear that the optimum sampling time is:
t1 = 1
k1
tabulation indicates that determination of the optimum sampling time requires
some previous knowledge of the kinetic rate constant. When nonlinear reaction mod-
els are considered, this is almost always true and explains why optimal experimental
designs are not used very frequently for experimental screening and initiation of exper-
imental studies, as it is usually very difficult to obtain good guesses of unknown kinetic

283
rate constant values. For this reason, the use of optimal design plans is more common
in kinetic analyses when empirical linear models in the form of Equation (12.2) are
considered.
12.3
SEQUENTIAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS
As described in the previous section, it can be difficult to propose optimal experimen-
tal designs for real nonlinear kinetic models when some sort of previous knowledge
of the kinetic rate constant values is not available. However, in many problems the
analyst has already performed NE experiments (x1 x2 …, xNE) and has not yet been
able to select the best kinetic model or determine the kinetic parameters with sufficient
precision. In these cases, some models and respective kinetic parameters are indeed
available, although perhaps discrimination of the best model has not been possible,
and the quality of the model parameters must be improved. Therefore, the investiga-
tor still handles a set of NM model candidates to describe a particular kinetic problem
(yM

) and wants to define the best model can-
didate through sequential experimentation and selection of at least one additional
experiment (xNE+1). Otherwise, even if a kinetic model has been already selected, the
investigator may want to improve the quality of the model parameters with the help
of at least one additional experiment (xNE+1). These problems lead to formulation of
sequential experimental design procedures.
According to the sequential experimental design procedure, the available experi-
mental information (due to availability of NE previously performed experiments or to
previous experience of the analyst) can be initially used to provide estimates for the
parameters of the many candidate models under consideration. Then, in the second step
at least one additional experiment (xNE+1) must be designed through maximization of
a certain specified performance index, as discussed in the previous section; however,
as guesses for model parameters are assumed to be available, numerical computa-
tions are indeed possible, and optimization can be performed in a meaningful manner.
Then, in the third step the selected experiments are performed in the lab and the set
of experiments is enlarged. Finally, in the fourth step the researcher updates the model
parameters for the models under consideration and returns to the initial step if the
obtained results are not conclusive and recommend a new round of experimentation.
In most problems it is usually much more difficult to perform the experiments than
to design the experimental conditions. Therefore, the number of designed experiments
depends mainly on the time required to carry out the experiments. If experiments
can be performed fast (for instance in a couple of hours of a couple of days), then
the investigator will find few reasons to select and perform more than one experi-
ment per iteration. However, if the experiments are too long (as in agriculture, for
instance) or a high throughput experimental device is used to perform many experi-
ments simultaneously, the analyst may find it adequate to design many experiments
simultaneously.

12.3.1
Sequential experimental design for model discrimination
Many times, and especially during the first stages of the model development process,
available experimental data can be explained by different kinetic models. This is quite
common in the field of chemical kinetics, as different kinetic mechanisms that lead
to different kinetic models can explain available experimental data with similar sta-
tistical significance (Knözinger et al., 1973; Schwaab et al., 2006; Froment et al.,
2011). Therefore, assuming the investigator considers a set of NM reasonable can-
didate kinetic models to explain the data, Figure 12.1 illustrates how the proposed
sequential experimental design procedure should be implemented (Gonzáles-Velasco
et al., 1991; Schwaab et al., 2006; Schwaab et al., 2008; Froment et al., 2011; Schwaab
and Pinto, 2011; Alberton et al., 2013).

Different performance indexes can be used for design of additional experiments.
For example, a performance index can be very simply formulated to represent the
average discriminating capacity of the experimental plan in the form (Froment et al.,
2011; Schwaab and Pinto, 2011):

(12.18)
where maximization of Equation (12.18) assumes that the best experimental condi-
tions for discriminating between candidate models are those that lead to maximum
differences among respective model predictions. Although the basic reasoning behind
Equation (12.18) is correct, this equation lacks statistical significance. For this reason,

Experimental design
285
many publications have proposed different performance indexes for model discrimi-
nation problems, based on more rigorous statistical arguments (Schwaab et al., 2006;
Schwaab et al., 2008; Alberton et al., 2013). For example, the discriminating capacity
between rival models i and j can be written in the form:
Ji,j(x) = (PiPj)z[yM
i (x) −yM
j (x)]TV−1
i,j [yM
i (x) −yM
j (x)]
(12.19)
tabulation Pi and Pj are the probabilities for the analyzed models to be the cor-
rect models, calculated with help of a chi-square distribution, z is a parameter that
defines the relative importance of the rival model probabilities for the design, and Vi,j
is a matrix that depends on the covariance matrix of model predictions of the form
(Schwaab et al., 2006; Schwaab et al., 2008):
Vi,j = 2Vy(x) + Vi(x) + Vj(x)
(12.20)
where Vy is the covariance matrix of experimental fluctuations and Vi is the covariance
matrix of model predictions calculated for model i (as described in Chapter 11).
Example
E12.10 Let us assume that two models are being considered for representation of a
certain kinetic experiment: a first-order model, of the form:
yM
1 = C(1)
A = CA0e−k(1)
1 t
and a second-order model in the form:
yM
2 = C(2)
A =
CA0
1 + k(2)
1 t
According to Equation (12.18) and assuming that a single additional experiment
must be designed at each iteration:

As shown in Example 12.9, the performance index increases continuously with
CA0, so the initial concentration must be as high as possible. On the other hand, for
determination of the best sampling time for model discrimination, the following design
equation can be proposed:
∂J
∂tNE+1

CA0NE+1e−k(1)

12.3.2
Sequential experimental design for parameter estimation
Even when the kinetic model that best describes the available kinetic data has been
determined, there may still be incentives for improvement of the parameter estimates.
In this case, the investigator normally attempts to reduce the correlations among the

model parameters or to enhance the parameter precision (diminish the parameter uncer-
tainties). Figure 12.4 illustrates the sequential design procedure that can be used in this
phase of the experimental study to increase the precision of the parameter estimates

Different performance indexes have been developed for the sequential design of
experiments for estimation of precise parameters, but they are all based on some sort
of metrics of Equation (2.13–16), as described in Section 12.2 (Pinto et al., 1990; Pinto
et al., 1991; Alberton et al., 2011). The difference now is that previous information is
assumed to be available for the estimable model parameters. For this reason, Equation
(12.13) is usually written in the iterative form (Froment et al., 2011; Schwaab and
Pinto, 2011):

It is important to observe that model discrimination and precise parameter estimation
can be combined and performed simultaneously with the help of information measures,
as described by Alberton et al. (2011).

the parameter accuracy is not significant at these conditions. This is because Equation

CONCLUDING REMARKS
In Chapter 12, statistical design procedures were presented and discussed. The main
features of four families of statistical designs were discussed and illustrated through
examples. The first family of statistical designs comprised factorial designs, used most
often for initial screening of experimental problems and based on empirical mathe-
matical structures. The advantageous aspects of orthogonal designs were presented
and illustrated through simple examples. Then the concept of optimal experimental
design was presented and used to introduce the families of sequential experimental
designs for model discrimination (in which the investigator handles multiple candidate
kinetic models) and for parameter estimation (in which a model has been selected but
the investigator attempts to improve the quality of the model parameters). Finally,
it was shown that the use of the maximum likelihood approach allows for explicit
consideration of experimental measurement errors in experimental planning.

Figure 13.1 shows the Arrhenius plot which does not follow a straight line. How-
ever, between 50◦C and 200◦C, the experimental data fit very well in the Arrhenius
plot (Figure 13.2). From this figure, we calculate the energy of activation equal to
23,400 cal/mol. In conclusion, experiments were carried out under kinetic conditions
in this temperature range. However, for higher temperatures, there are diffusion effects.

The equilibrium constant at 25◦C is equal to 1.25. The conversion is 90% of the
equilibrium conversion. Pure reactant is fed at 0.36 L/h and with a concentration of
0.2 mol/L. The reactor volume is 0.5 L. Assuming a first-order reaction rate for both
direct and reverse reactions, calculate the specific kinetic rate constants.
Solution
As seen this is a reaction type like:

ER.4 The reaction was performed in a batch reactor and in the gas phase. 10% N2
was introduced in the reactor at 2 atm and 450◦C. After 50 min, the pressure was
3.3 atm. The reaction is irreversible and of first order. Calculate the specific reaction

Solution
The reaction is:
A−→R + S
First, the reaction occurs at constant volume, so we calculate the partial pressures.
The initial partial pressures of reactant and N2 (inert) are:
pN2 = 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 atm
pA0 = 1.8 atm
The partial pressure of A is therefore:
pA = pA0 −a
ν(P −P0)

296
Chemical reaction engineering
After 50 min, the total pressure of the system is 3.3 atm and the initial pressure
2 atm. Since, v = 2 −1 = 1 and a = 1, then:
pA = 1.8 −1(3.3 −2) = 0.5
Thus, the conversion is:
XA = pA0 −pA
pA0
= 0.72
The rate is a first-order reaction and for a constant volume it is equal to:
(−rA) = kCA = kCA0(1 −XA)
Substitute the rate equation in the batch reactor equation and integrate. Then,
t = CA0

however, volume changes due to the gas expansion. Thus,

than the previous ones, and therefore we calculate the correct temperature, since the
activation energy is given and constant.
k = k0e−(E/RT)
However, first we must calculate the constant k0. The specific constant at 800 K
is 5.85 × 10−2 (L/mol min). If the activation energy is E = 30,000 cal/mol, then,
k0 = 8.25 × 106
Hence, with k = 5.85 × 10−2, we obtain:
k = k0e−(E/RT) = 5.85 · 10−2 = 8.25 · 106e−(30000/2T)
Thus, T = 912 K or 639◦C.

Thus, the rate equation is:
−rA = k[A][M] = k[A]2

Assuming equal initial concentrations of A and M: [A0] = [M0]
Therefore, comparing these equations, we conclude that the rate expressions are
different:
−rA = k[A]1/2[M]

These values correspond to the initial rates and concentrations. Transforming in
logarithmic form, we obtain:
ln(r0) = ln ka + n ln CA0
where:
k = k0e−(E/RT)

ln(4.9 × 10−4) = −7.62
ln(6 × 10−5) = −9.72
ln(0.2) = −1.60

From Figures E13.1 and E13.2, we obtain the linear and angular coefficients, Model 2.
With these coefficients, we calculated the corresponding constants. Note that the
angular coefficients are similar for both Models 1 and 2.

Show how inhibition occurs in the product rate equation P when compared to
the reaction rate based on the Michaelis-Menten mechanism for a single site.

Solution
(a)
Rate equations for ES and ESS
rES = k1[E][S] −k′
1[ES][S] + k′
2[ESS] −kt[ES]
(13.32)
rESS = k2[ES][S] + k′
2[ESS]
(13.33)
Assuming steady state for [ES] and [ESS], we have:
drES/dt = 0
drES/dt = 0
The total enzyme concentration is:
[E0] = [E] + [ES] + [ESS]
(13.34)
From Equation (13.32):
[ES∗] = k′
1[ES] + k2[ES][S] −k′
2[ESS] + kt[S]
k1[S]
From Equation (13.33):

From Equation (13.34):
[ESS] = k2

[ES] =

where: km = k′

since kp = kr [ES] we have:

(13.35)
where: kr [E0] = Vmax
kp =
Vmax[S]
km + [S] + [S]2
K2
(13.36)
(b)
The nonreactive complex formation promotes inhibition because the amount
of enzymes decreases with increasing product formation. Comparing Equation
(13.30) with the Michaelis-Menten equation, it shows that the term [S]2/K2
is responsible for the decreasing rate formation of the product. The inhibition
depends on km, [S], and K2. (K2 decreases with more [ESS] formation).
(c)
Since:
rp =
Vmax[S]
km + [S] + [S]2
K2
(13.37)
The rate is maxima when: drp

Thus:

Calculation of the polymerization grade XN
From the definition:

kpM · R∗
2γk0[I2] + kt (R∗)2
where: [M] = M.
When the concentration of the initiator does not vary with time ([I2] = [I2]0),
then, Equation 8.36 becomes:
R∗=

Since M = M0(1 −XM) = 3(1 −XM), the expression of XN results:

XN = 1.34 × (1 −XM)
(b) Concentration of the monomer with time:

Thus, the concentration of the monomer with time in a batch reactor is:

Changing the integration interval and substituting expression of (−rM), after

For CSTR:
τ = dXM

Similarly:

Substituting (−rM) results:

Rearranging, the concentration of the monomer with the space time is:

Chapter 14
Ideal reactors
INTRODUCTION
In the first part of this book, we have studied the kinetics of homogeneous and hetero-
geneous chemical reactions as well as the influence of parameters on the reaction rates
not taking into account diffusion and mass effects. These phenomena are caused by
heat and mass transfer limitations. Therefore, the parameters have been determined
under kinetic control regime in the absence of transport phenomena effects. When
these phenomena take place, the observed rate is lower than the intrinsic kinetic rate.
The effects must be determined separately.
Unlike heat or mass exchangers, for reactors we should take into account a gen-
eration term in the mass and heat balance due to the chemical reaction, therefore the
chemical reaction rate.
The conventional chemical reactors comprise batch and tank or tubular reactors.
The batch reactors are used in small-scale processes while tubular reactors have been
preferentially applied in large-scale production. The advantages and drawbacks of
batch and continuous reactors are shown in the table below:

The batch reactor is advantageous for small-scale processes, such as drug produc-
tion and fine chemicals. However, the batch reactor should be constructed in such a
way to avoid preferential paths, with very efficient stirring system so that the mixture
is homogeneous. Samples may be collected intermittently or at the end of the reaction
allowing to obtain the composition of the intermediate or final products. For kinetic
studies, sampling is carried out at different times to monitor reaction system as function
of time.

348
Chemical reaction engineering
The drawbacks depend on the system scale. The reactor has to be loaded, unloaded,
and cleaned, sometimes resulting in longer time than the reaction itself. The batch
reactor requires less labor, however, requires special care to avoid contamination. Batch
reactors are utilized in pharmaceutical industry, fine chemicals, natural products, and
processes little known.
The continuous reactors are mostly used in large-scale industries and in numerous
industrial processes. They may be used to operate homogeneous and heterogeneous
processes for several months or even years producing large amount of products. The
operating conditions are wide but require a continuous control and consequently more
labor.
Reactors face serious problems of flow including heat and mass transfer limi-
tations. The flow regime affects the system, especially heterogeneous ones. The most
important variables such as flow, temperature, and concentration should be monitored
continuously requiring high precision instruments.
The main disadvantage is the occurrence of clogging or overloading demanding
immediate interruption of the reactor, especially in systems with potentially explosive
reactions.
In a continuous tank-type reactor, the flow should not follow preferential paths. In
the continuous tubular reactor, the flow can be in extreme cases: laminar (not desired)
or turbulent (desired), but without dead volume. The type of flow may cause radial
and longitudinal diffusion effects causing radial or axial temperature and concentration
gradients and consequently affecting the chemical reaction.
Dimensioning a reactor can be easy when the flow is ideal. To study the flow, one
invokes the so-called “population balance.’’
Let us consider an irreversible first-order reaction in isothermal conditions, whose
solution is:
−ln (1 −XA) = kt
where XA is the conversion of reactant A, k is the rate constant, and t is reaction
time. Time t is the contact time or residence time of molecules in the reactor. In batch
reactors, the time measured is equal to the average contact time of the molecules. In a
continuous system, the residence time of the molecules may be or not the same for all
molecules since it depends on their distribution in the reactor, which in turn depends
on the fluid flow. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the rate constant without
the “true’’ reaction time.
We can consider the following cases:
(a)
All fluid elements or molecules have the same residence time in the reactor or
the same average contact time, characterizing a perfect mixture—ideal batch or
tank.
(b)
The fluid going through the reactor has uniform composition at any cross section
of the tube characterizing a “plug’’ flow—ideal tubular reactor.
(c)
The fluid flow or distribution of molecules is not uniform in the cross section;
molecules flow with different contact times along the reactor, characterizing the
nonideal reactors.

Figure 14.1 Shapes of tubular reactors.
The flow also depends on the reactor shape. The cylindrical tubular reactor is the
most used but there are other shapes as conical and cylindrical trunk with transversal
flow, which change the velocity profile affecting the flow as shown in Figure 14.1.
The choice of the type of reactor depends on the flow and other factors:
(a)
Residence time.
(b)
Pressure drop in the reactor.
(c)
Type of load in the reactor (catalyst or filling).
(d)
Internal or external heat exchange, which depends whether the reaction is
exothermic or endothermic and consequently if the operation is isothermal or
adiabatic.
The flow in the reactor and also the superficial velocities in a cross section of the
reactor vary with the condition and shape of the reactor. The velocity profile for the
laminar flow in a cylindrical tube can be calculated. It presents a parabolic velocity
distribution, which is a variable in the cross section, causing different contact times
of the molecules along the reactor; this situation characterizes a nonideal reactor. In
turbulent flow, when the Reynolds number is high, the velocity distribution varies in
the cross section: high velocities near the walls and more uniform velocities in the
center of the tube. These velocity profiles can be calculated by Van Karman theory.
The larger the Reynolds number the higher the velocity and more uniform the velocity
profile in the reactor, approaching the ideal flow and favoring a uniform contact,
therefore, allowing an ideal mean residence time of the molecules. The heterogeneous

350
Chemical reaction engineering
reactors, particularly catalytic reactors, have highly variable velocity distribution, and
although it is possible to predict the behavior of the fluid in these systems, it is very
difficult to calculate the voids, which create channeling. The flow depends on the type
and placement of the catalyst particles inside the reactor. On the other hand, reactors
containing catalysts allow higher contact between molecules due to a large contact area
promoted by catalyst particles, which enhances chemical reactions between molecules.
The higher the Reynolds number and therefore the higher the fluid velocity, the more
similar the flow will be to a turbulent flow and to an ideal reactor.
Besides the flow, one should consider the mass and heat transfer limitations. In
reactors without bed, one may calculate the heat and mass exchange and determine
the conditions for an adiabatic or isothermal operation, since the temperature profile
in the reactor is known. For uniform velocities, the heat transfer depends on the heat
capacities; if they are constant, the temperature profile is uniform. Otherwise, there
are considerable deviations and consequently large temperature variations. In catalytic
reactors, there is also the influence of conductive heat of the particles. The temperature
affects substantially the rate constant and consequently the reaction rate. At the same
time, mass transfer limitation may be present due to convection and diffusion inside
the pores of the particles, which depend on the fluid flow and the diffusive proper-
ties of molecules. Mass transfer limitation affects significantly the rate constant and
consequently the reaction rate causing different residence times of the molecules.
These considerations also apply to continuous-tank reactors, batch or semibatch.
However, the manner of contact between molecules also depends on the geometry of
the reactors. One should avoid dead volume and for this purpose strong stirring can
be used. The higher the stirring the better the contact between molecules and the lower
the chance of dead volume. The contact is instantaneous and the concentrations in the
tank or in the batch should be uniform, and if possible equal to the reactor outlet.
One reaches the ideal condition when the mixture is perfectly uniform. Figure 14.2
illustrates the different cases.

14.1
TYPES OF REACTORS
The conditions for classifying ideal reactors are as follows:
Tubular reactor: The contact time is the same for all molecules or fluid elements along
the reactor when the velocity is uniform in the cross section of the tube, satisfying
the plug flow. All molecules have the same velocity. Therefore, the concentration
is uniform in a cross section of the tube and varies only along the reactor. In the
isothermal case, the temperature remains constant in the longitudinal and radial
directions. In the nonisothermal case, the temperature varies along the reactor. This
reactor will be denominated ideal PFR (plug flow reactor).
Tank reactor: The molecules should have the same mean residence time in the tank.
Therefore, the concentration inside the tank should be equal to the concentration
at the reactor outlet, implying in a uniform and perfect mixture. To reach a perfect
mixture, dead volume must be avoided so that the mean residence time is uniform. A
reactor in these conditions will be an ideal CSTR (continuous stirred-tank reactor).
Batch reactor: The mixture must be perfect leading to a homogeneous concentration
throughout the reactor volume. The reactor should be well stirred and dead volume
cannot be present. The temperature is also uniform.
14.2
DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS OF RESIDENCE TIME
As seen previously, the concentration varies with the reaction time or contact time in
the batch reactor.
In continuous reactors, the concentration varies with space time, which is a vari-
able equivalent to time but measured as a function of reactor volume and inlet flow of
the fluid (or inlet velocity of the fluid). The flow is measured experimentally by using
a rotameter or mass flow meters (MFM) through conductor signals. They are concrete
measurements. We can define the new variables as follows:
Space velocity: ratio between the feed volumetric flow and reactor volume. It represents
the feed rate per unit volume to achieve a given concentration or conversion of the
reactant in the reactor outlet. One can interpret the space velocity as the velocity
with which a fluid element or molecules pass through the reactor volume to achieve
a certain conversion. If FA0 (mol/h) is the molar flow, v0 (m3/h) is the volumetric
flow at the reactor inlet, and V (m3) the reactor volume, then:
ve = s = v0
V (h−1)
(14.1)
or
ve = s =
FA0
CA0 × V (h−1)
(14.2)
where CA0 and FA0 are, respectively, the initial concentration and initial molar flow
of the reactant A (i.e., at the reactor inlet).

352
Chemical reaction engineering
Space time: the inverse of space velocity, i.e., the ratio between the reactor volume and
the feed volumetric flow. It represents the time in which a fluid element or molecules
pass through the reactor volume to achieve a final concentration or conversion of
reactant. Therefore, we have:
τ = V
v0
(h)
(14.3)
As an example, ve = 5 h−1 means a feed rate of 5 V h−1 to process the reaction in
order to achieve 80% conversion. On the other hand, τ = 5 min represents the time
required to process a feed rate in the volume V and achieve 80% conversion, or
each 5 min one processes a load in the reactor volume to achieve 80% conversion.
Residence time: the residence time t takes into account the time in which each fluid
element or molecule passes through the reactor and it depends on the molecules
velocity inside the reactor; therefore, it depends on the flow in the reactor. Residence
time is equal to space time if the velocity is uniform in a cross section of the reactor,
as in ideal tubular reactors. This situation is not valid to tank reactors, since the
velocity distribution is not uniform. In most nonideal reactors, the residence time is
not the same for all molecules, leading to variations in radial concentrations along
the reactor; and therefore, the concentration in the tank and at the reactor outlet is
not uniform. That means we need to define initially the residence time and calculate
the residence time distribution for each system.
Tracers: one can determine experimentally the local and mean residence time in sys-
tems where no reaction occurs. One chooses a nonreactive fluid and adds a tracer,
measuring its concentration at the outlet of the reactor. In general, a dye is used
but other alternatives are possible such as conductivity, radioactive materials, etc.
since they can be measured. The nonreactive fluid flows through the reactor and
the tracer is introduced as step or pulse. To simplify, we will use a tank reactor with
volume V and a nonreactive liquid with inlet volumetric flow v0. One introduces
a dye with concentration C0 at the reactor inlet and measures its concentration at
the reactor outlet from the instant t = 0. By the balance, we have:

We obtain:

(14.4)
The tracer concentration at the reactor outlet varies exponentially with time,
indicating that its distribution varies inside the reactor. The molecules have differ-
ent residence times and leave the reactor with a concentration in exponential form.
This is the concentration distribution in an ideal tank reactor.
Generally, one relates the concentration with a residence time distribution func-
tion, assuming that a fraction of molecules has a residence time in between t and
t + dt. At time t, the tracer concentration at the reactor outlet is C. Therefore, one
measures a fraction of molecules that remains in the reactor in a time shorter than t and
another fraction that remains in the reactor in a time longer than t. The first fraction
is represented by the cumulative distribution function F(t) and the second fraction is
represented by the difference (1 −F(t)) which remains for a time longer than t. This
last fraction contains no more C0 at the reactor outlet. A balance at the reactor outlet
leads to:
v0[1 −F(t)] × C0 + v0F(t)C0 = v0C
along with Equation 14.4:
F(t) = C
C0
= 1 −exp (−t/τ)
(14.5)
Therefore, the cumulative residence time distribution function is determined
by measuring the concentration versus time at the reactor outlet. The function is
represented graphically as follows:
We have the mean residence time if residence time is equal to space time (t = τ) or
if Area 1 = Area 2 in Figure 14.4. One can notice that a fraction of molecules in the
first area has a residence time lower than t and another fraction in Area 2 has longer
time. Similar fractions have a residence time corresponding to the mean value, which
we designate t (mean residence time).
In the ideal PFR, the residence time is the same for all molecules, assuming con-
stant and uniform velocity. The outlet concentration of the tracer is equal to the inlet
concentration. Therefore, F(t) = 1 or t = τ. The mean residence time is equal to the
space time.

Any other form of residence time distribution in between ideal CSTR and ideal
PFR behaves as a nonideal reactor.
To determine the function F(t) from experimental data, we use the property G, as
shown in Chapter 1. If G is any property (conductivity, ionization, wavelength, etc.)
proportional to the concentration, in which G1 is the magnitude at the inlet and G2 at
the outlet, then the cumulative residence time distribution function, which remained
in the reactor at an instant shorter than t, will be:
F(t) = G(t) −G1

Another method to determine the residence time consists in introducing the tracer as a
pulse at a short time. The response of tracer concentration at the reactor outlet can be
calculated assuming that a fraction of molecules F left the reactor at an interval of
time t. A fraction of molecules leaves the reactor with concentration C0 and another
fraction leaves without C0 at the outlet. Therefore, at the interval of time t we have

IDEAL REACTORS
The kinetics of reactions has been studied for different reaction systems in liquid or
gas phase, simple and multiple reactions, taking into account volume variation for
different cases, and an important conclusion is that the understanding of kinetics is
fundamental to the design of reactors.
To design reactors, we have to calculate molar and energy balances considering
that reactions can also take place under nonisothermal conditions. These balances
contain always the generation term due to the chemical reaction, which is represented
by the reaction rate.
The conventional ideal reactors are batch, continuous, and semibatch. The condi-
tions established for ideal reactors were shown in the previous section, and recapping,
tanks should have perfect mixture and tubular reactors should have plug flow.
The molar balance in an open system is shown in the following scheme and

Figure 14.7 Accumulation term and reaction term.
We must distinguish clearly the reaction term from the accumulation term. Let us
consider the following schemes in Figure 14.7:
Reactions usually occur in steady state in the continuous tubular and tank reac-
tors, but if there is a disturbance on the system, this disturbance will appear in the
accumulation term (4), since the reaction does not depend on the operation. The reac-
tion manifests through the reaction rate, in the generation term of the molar balance
(3). In case (a) of Figure 14.7, one feeds the reactant A with concentration CA0 and
volumetric flow v0 at the reactor entrance. If the reactor is ideal (perfect mixture),
the concentration of A in the tank (CA) is uniform and equal to the concentration at
the reactor outlet. While in steady state, there will be no variation in the tank height
(h1) or in the outlet concentration. In case (b), the initial concentration in the tank
varied because of a feed with different concentration from CA0, causing a change in
the concentration at the tank outlet; therefore, this disturbance will manifest in the
accumulation term. In case (c), there was variation in the volumetric flow caused by
failure in the pump or leak in the pipe, which leads to a variation in height of the liq-
uid and consequently variation in the accumulation term. All these disturbances cause
variations in the outlet concentrations resulting in a nonsteady state regime.
We will consider systems operating at steady state and therefore the last term will
be null. Then:

14.3.1
Batch reactor
Basically, there is no flow in the batch reactor and we need to determine the total
reaction time to calculate the reactor volume that processes a particular reaction and
achieves a desired final conversion. We also need to know the reaction rate through
the intrinsic kinetics or the opposite: determining the intrinsic kinetics or reaction rate

362
Chemical reaction engineering
from the reactor volume. In the batch reactor, one disregards the terms (1) and (2),
and therefore Equation 14.13 becomes:

rj dV = dnj
dt
In a closed system, the volume is constant, and thus:
rjV = dnj
dt
Therefore, integrating between Cj0 and Cj, we calculate the total reaction time:
t =
Cj

Cj0
dCj
rj
Using the conversion as a variable, we have for liquid or gas systems without
contraction or expansion of volume:
CA = CA0(1 −XA)
t = CA0
XA


dXA
( −rA)
(14.15)
This is the time required to reach a final conversion and it can be calculated by
determining the reaction rate (rj).
In a closed gas system, one assumes a piston that keeps the pressure constant
but allows variation in the gas volume (expansion or contraction). In this case,
Equation 14.15 becomes broader, i.e.:
t = nA0



(14.16)
where:
V = V0(1 + εAXA)
And εA is the factor of expansion or contraction defined previously.
The reaction time depends on the kinetics and therefore on the reaction type. If
the reaction is simple, complex, irreversible, reversible, or multiple, one may integrate
the equation using analytical or numerical methods.

Figure 14.8 Average rate and time in a batch reactor.
To design the batch reactor, one should consider, besides the reaction time tr, the
operation time t0, which takes into account stops, unloading, cleaning, and reloading
of the reactor. The total time will be:
t = tr + t0
Considering the daily capacity of the reactor as G (i.e., the daily mass of desired
product, kg/day), the total number of daily batches as N and the average density of
the mixture as ρ, then the batch reactor volume will be:
Vreactor =
G
ρ · N
(14.17)
Usually one assumes a safety factor to calculate the reactor volume. This factor is
arbitrary and often 100% higher than the calculated volume. However, this consider-
ation is unnecessary since one can predict the reaction time from the reaction kinetics.
The reaction rate is high in the beginning but decreases with reaction time. Thus, the
initial reaction rate is maximum and then decreases inducing the reaction time to be
very long to convert the remaining reactants. If we take into account this time and also
the operation time, the process yield may become not viable. Therefore, it is desirable
to obtain an average rate, i.e., a value in between the initial (maximum) and the final
one. One should choose a rate whose tangent line to the curve in Figure 14.8 has
origin in the point corresponding to the operation time (indicated to the left on the
abscissa axis) and touches the curve at the point corresponding to the reaction time.
The conversion is not complete, but high, remaining little reactant to be converted.
The operation time is estimated. One chooses the final reaction time after reaching the

Example
E14.3 A reaction A + B →2R takes place in liquid phase in a batch reactor. One
introduces the reactants with initial concentrations of 1.5 and 3.0 kmol/cm3, but the
reactor already contains the product R whose initial concentration is 2.25 kmol/cm3.
Calculate the reactor volume aiming a production of 20 ton/day. The final conversion
of reactant A was 80%. The operation time including opening, cleaning, and loading
of reactor was 46 min and the density of the final mixture was 880 kg/m3. The reaction
rate is known and given by the following expression:
r =
k1CACB
k2CR + k3CA
where:
k1 = 0.3 kseg−1
k2 = 0.625 cm3/kmol
k3 = 0.36 cm3/kmol.
Solution
Rearranging the rate expression as a function of conversion (reactant A):
CA = CA0(1 −XA)
CB = CA0(M −XA)
CR = CA0(R + 2XA)
where CA0, CB0, and CR0 are the initial concentrations of reactants A, B, and product R.
rA = k1CA0(1 −XA)(M −XA)
(N + k′XA)
(14.19)
where:
M = CB0/CA0
R = CR0/CA0
N = k2R + k3
k′ = 2k2 −k3.
Substituting the numerical values, we obtain:
M = 2
R = 1.5
N = 1.3

The desired production of R is 20 ton/day. If conversion of A is 80%, it is necessary
to have 25,000 kg of reactant/day. In this case, the mass per batch will be 2687 kg,
i.e., 1343 kg of A and 1343 kg of B. Using the density of the mixture, we calculate the
reactor volume:
V = 3.0 m3

To produce 450 kg/day of product operating under final conversion of 75%, one should
feed the reactor with 604 kg/day of reactant. Considering the total time as 1.51 h, we

M = 38 kg/batch
If the mixture density is 0.21 kg/L, we calculate the reactor volume:
V = 180 L

E14.5 An enzymatic reaction is carried out in a batch reactor according to the reaction:

where CA is the urea concentration.
Calculate the reactor volume considering a daily production of 200 kg, final

The rate equation is given by an enzymatic reaction rate:
r =

KM + CA
where:
Vm = enzyme’s maximum rate
KM = Michaelis constant.
Rearranging the equation as a function of conversion of A:
CA = CA0(1 −XA)
CA0 is the initial concentration of urea (reactant).

tt = 79.0 min = 1.31 h
To produce 200 kg/day of product considering the final conversion of 80%, one
should feed the reactor with 250 kg/day. If the total time for the reactor operation is

M = 11.0 kg/batch
If the density of the mixture is 1 kg/L, the reactor volume is:

14.3.2
Continuous tank reactor
There is flow through the reactor and one aims to determine the total volume of the
reactor in order to achieve a desired final conversion. Usually one knows the reaction
intrinsic kinetics, but additional data such as feed flow and mean residence time are
necessary. The residence time of the molecules is not uniform and there is dead volume
with preferential paths. In this reactor, let us consider the steady state, disregarding
the accumulation term.
From general equation, we will consider the inlet and outlet flows, i.e., terms (1)
and (2), but will disregard the accumulation term, thus Equation 14.13 becomes:

This equation applies for each component, reactant or product. Since, in most
cases, the reactor is used for processing liquid phase reactions, one can consider the

FA0 −FA = FA0XA
We have:

gas-phase reactions and those with varying number of moles. In the particular case, in
liquid phase, we can use the concentration as the main measurement variable, because
FA0 = CA0v0
and
FA = CAv0 = CA0v0(1 −XA)
Therefore, to calculate the reactor volume, we have the following general equation:
V

(14.27)
where τ is the space time.
The reaction rate (−rA) was determined for different cases. We have seen that for
irreversible reactions, first- and second order at constant volume, we have, respectively:
(−rA) = kCA(1 −XA)
or
( −rA) = kCACB = kC2
A0(1 −XA)(M −XA)
where:
M = CA0

k = rate constant
Therefore, to calculate the reactor volume or inlet and outlet flows in the reactor
we should know the rate constants, which are usually irreversible, reversible, multiple,
complex, enzymatic, or polymeric.
14.3.2.1
Mean residence time in the CSTR
The residence time of reactants in a tank reactor has a variable time distribution.
However, it may be calculated directly by means of:
t = Vreactor
voutput
where V is the reactor volume and v is the volumetric flow at the exit of the reactor.
If the system has constant volume, for instance, in case of liquid reactants, the outlet
flow is the same as that of the inlet flow v0, therefore, the mean residence time is equal
to the space time τ. On the other hand, if the reaction occurs in gas phase and there is

372

volume variation (contraction or expansion of volume), the flow rate v varies and the
mean residence time is given by:
t = Vreactor
voutput
=
V
v0(1 + εAXA) =
τ
(1 + εAXA)
(14.28)
In the latter case, the mean residence time t is different from the space time τ.
In short:
If V is constant, t = τ
If V varies (gas), t ̸= τ
Example

rapid and the kinetics has been determined. The rate constant is given by:

where k is the rate constant, L/(mol min).
If the ester concentration is 6 g/L and sodium hydroxide is 5 g/L, calculate the
molar flow at the entrance of a CSTR which has 100 L. The reaction temperature is
40˚ C and the final conversion should be 98%.
CH3CO2C2H5 + NaOH →CH3CO2Na + C2H5OH

The reaction is irreversible, second order, and at constant volume (liquid phase).
Therefore, the rate will be:

The rate constant was calculated by Equation 14.29 and presented in the table

Similar values of k were determined at T = 286 K and one can assume that the
initial hypothesis is true. Since we have values of k at different temperatures, we can
determine the rate constant at any temperature by determining the activation energy E
using the Arrhenius equation. Substituting the values of k and temperature one obtains

From the Arrhenius equation, one determines the constant k0, i.e.:

Therefore, the rate constant at T = 323 K is:
k = 5.4 × 104 exp (5735/(RT)) = 6.89 L/(mol min)
At 50◦C (T = 323 K), the conversion can be calculated directly from Equation

E14.8 The polymerization of a monomer M is made in a CSTR. One introduces 1.2 L/h

kt = Termination rate constant (L/(mol s)) = 5 × 10−7 (L/(mol s)).
Calculate the reactor volume to achieve 80% conversion of monomer.

By replacing the constants into Equation 14.30, we obtain the rate:

This gas-phase reaction was carried out in a reactor with high gas mixing, aiming
to obtain a perfect mixture. One introduces 250 kg/h of reactant with 20% inert, at

According to the reaction stoichiometry 1:2 reactant: products, the gas will

Continuous tubular reactor (PFR)
The ideal tubular reactor presents the velocity constant in the cross section of the tube
with a “plug’’ flow through the reactor. There is no velocity gradient in both radial
and axial directions. However, the concentration varies throughout the reactor and
thus the molar balance should be differential. The molar flow varies throughout the
reactor. Initially, we will assume isothermal PFR reactor.

The equation above is valid for any gas or liquid system. The reaction rate will
depend on the reaction kinetic model. The reaction may be irreversible, reversible,
simple, multiple, elementary or not, enzymatic or polymeric. If the reaction occurs
with varying the number of moles or variable volume, one should take into account
the factor ε defined previously.
For the particular cases:

14.3.3.1
Influence of kinetic parameters
The main parameters of the reaction rate are: reaction order, initial concentrations
(ratio M), and the factor of expansion or contraction (εA). The space time and
consequently the reactor volume depend on these parameters.
14.3.3.2
Effect of parameter M
The space time varies with the initial concentrations (parameter M). Assuming the
same conversion to an irreversible second-order reaction, τ decreases with increasing
M as we can see in Figure 14.11a.
14.3.3.3
Effect of reaction order
Comparing reactions of first and second order by keeping M constant (Equations 14.39
and 14.40) one notes that the relation between the space time τ (τ1/ τ2) decreases with
increasing conversion, as shown in Figure 14.11b. For low conversions, the space
times or reactor volume are almost equal, but for high conversions, these differences
are significant: the reactor volume or space time for a second-order reaction can be
double than a first-order reaction.
14.3.3.4
Effect of reaction volume variation (εA)
Finally for variable volume systems, one should take into account the factor of con-
traction or expansion (εA), as Equations 14.43 to 14.45. Comparing the space times
between reactions of first-order τ1 and second-order τ2 as a function of the factor
εA, given a conversion, one observes in Figure 14.11c that space times significantly
increase with increasing the factor of expansion, achieving values with magnitude 4–5
times higher for higher values of εA, which means that the required volume may be
5 times larger depending on the expansion factor εA. Such a difference is higher for
second-order reactions.
14.3.3.5
Mean residence time in the PFR
The residence time in the tubular reactor depends on the velocity at which the fluid
flows. Assuming “plug’’ flow in the ideal PFR reactor, all molecules have the same
velocity over the cross section. In general, the average residence time in the PFR is
defined as:
t =

(14.47)
But if there is no volume variation (εA = 0), we obtain the same expression for
space time (Equation 14.38), meaning that the mean residence time is equal to the
space time. When there is volume variation (εA ̸= 0), the mean residence time and
space are different. The rate expression depends on the reaction order and the factor
εA for any kind of reaction (irreversible, reversible multiple, etc.). In short:
t = τ →for reactions at constant volume
t ̸= τ →for reactions with variation in the number of mol (variable volume)
Example
E14.11 A gas-phase reaction A →R + S occurs in a PFR reactor. One introduces
the reactant A with inert 30% (molar) operating isothermally at 300◦C and ambient

The rate constant is calculated at 300◦C (573 K):
k = 0.408 s−1
Therefore, if t = 5 s, then:

384

The space time is longer than the mean residence time due to the gas expansion in
the reactor (variable volume system).
In the CSTR, the mean residence time will be:

the CSTR is approximately 21% lower.

C3H6 + Cl2 →CH2 = CH −CH2Cl + HCl

Thus,
M = 1.33
Therefore, the molar flow of A:

FA0 = CA0.v0 v0 = 1.063 m3/h

ER14.14 Acetaldehyde, ethane, and other hydrocarbons are mixed and undergo two
PFR reactors in parallel. The acetaldehyde decomposition into methane and carbon
monoxide occurs preferentially at 520◦C, but at 800◦C ethane decomposes into ethy-
lene and hydrogen. One introduces the mixture containing 9% acetaldehyde, 8%
ethane, and stream as diluent (molar %). The other components are negligible. The
first reactor works at 520◦C and 1 atm and the second one at 800◦C and 1.4 atm. To
achieve 60% conversion, what should be the ratio between the volumetric flow at the
entrance of the reactors, assuming that they have the same volume? The rate constants
are given by:
Acetaldehyde: k = 0.33 L/(mol s) at 520◦C
Ethane: k = 1.535×1014·exp(−70,000/(RT)) s−1
Solution
The acetaldehyde decomposition occurs in the first reactor, since ethane decomposition
is thermodynamically negligible at that operating condition. On the other hand, ethane
decomposition takes place in the second reactor. These components should be included

IDEAL NONISOTHERMAL REACTORS
The kinetics of reactions has been studied for different reaction systems in isother-
mal reactors. The majority of reactions and processes are not isothermal, since the
reactions are endothermic or exothermic. Depending on the extent of exothermicity
or endothermicity, the thermal effects on conversion, selectivity, or yield are quite
pronounced.
The reactions in liquid phase with low heat capacity can be performed in a reactor
operating isothermally. However, reactions with high heat capacity in liquid or gas
phase affect significantly the conversion, selectivity, yield, and/or the reactor features,
as volume (especially volume).
The effect of temperature is observed on the reaction rate, because temperature
affects the rate constant through the Arrhenius constant. The temperature influences
significantly the rate constant due to the exponential term that contains the activation
energy and temperature. The temperature effect is lower on the preexponential factor,
which takes into account the collision between molecules, but it may become important
in catalyzed reactions.
Thermodynamics show that the equilibrium conversion increases exponentially
with increasing temperature in endothermic reactions but decreases in exothermic
reactions.
Figure 14.12 shows the curves of equilibrium conversion XAe for endothermic and
exothermic cases, as well as the conversion with increasing temperature until reaching
equilibrium conversion.
The reactors can operate in three different ways:
(1)
Isothermally: The temperature is constant and uniform in the reactor. If the
reaction is endothermic, one needs to supply heat to keep it isothermal. If the
reaction is exothermic one needs to remove heat to keep the temperature constant.
(2)
Nonisothermally: In this case, the temperature varies throughout the reactor and
also the conversion, depending on if the reaction is endothermic or exothermic.
(3)
Adiabatically: The reactor remains insulated; no heat transfer occurs and both
the temperature and conversion vary throughout the reactor. When the reaction
is exothermic, a rigorous control is necessary because the temperature inside
the reactor can exceed the desired value leading to explosion risks. Usually the
oxidation reactions are highly exothermic.

If the conversion varies with temperature, we have one more unknown variable,
i.e., the temperature, and therefore we need to perform an energy balance.

Chemical reaction engineering
The heat generated due to the chemical reaction depends on the enthalpy of reac-
tion and the reaction rate in a system with volume dV. Thus, we can express this
generated heat as follows:
.
Ggenerated = Hr · rj dV
(14.62)
where:
 Hr = total enthalpy of reaction:

Hproducts =

Hreactants

and
rj = total reaction rate (mol/(L h))
According to thermodynamics, the enthalpy of each component depends on the
temperature. As we have seen:
Hj =
T

T0
cp dT
(14.63)
where cpj is the specific heat of each component, reactant or product, which in turn
depends on the temperature. There are two possibilities:
(1)
The specific heat cpj does not vary with temperature within a certain range, which
is quite normal for most systems.
(2)
The specific heat cpj varies with temperature and it is calculated according to the
following expression, assuming ideal gas systems:
cpj = αj + βjT + γjT2
(14.64)
where the constants α, β, and γ are known and tabulated for several compounds and
mixtures.
There are two different cases that depend on the units. When the unit is expressed
as cal/(g ◦C) one should use directly cpj, but when it is expressed as cal/(mol K) one
should use the nomenclature with bar, i.e., cpj.
Substituting Equation 14.64 into Equation 14.63, we obtain the variation of
enthalpy with temperature.
If the system operates in steady state, the accumulation term is zero. In the transient
system, the energy should be a function of the number of moles and the specific heat
of each component. This term is different from the feed heat flow passing through the
system. Here, we also have two cases:

The enthalpies of components at the inlet and outlet of the system depend on the

considering Equation 14.63:

Hr is constant at the temperature range. If it varies with temperature, one should

cpj is the heat capacity and it is constant for each component. If it varies with
temperature, one should use Equation 14.64.
The energy equation in terms of heat can be seen in Figure 14.15.
The generated heat varies exponentially since it contains the reaction term. In this
term, the rate constant or Arrhenius constant varies exponentially with temperature.
At first, the heat increases smoothly since the conversion is low, but with increasing
temperature and conversion, the heat increases sharply and stabilizes as the reaction
rate decreases at high conversions.
The sensible or flow heat varies linearly with temperature and depends only on the
heat capacity of the components, which is approximately constant at this temperature
range. However, the flow of each component varies with conversion.
Let us consider the irreversible gas-phase reaction:

where:
cpA, cpB e cpR, are the specific heats of components expressed as J/(molK)
The external heat Qexternal depends on the heating (steam) or cooling fluid that
flows through a cooling coil, jacket, or external heat exchanger.
Usually one considers the overall heat transfer coefficient, U which takes into
account the heat transfer coefficients between the cooling/heating fluid and the fluid
inside reactor, the transfer coefficient hfluid, and the thermal conductivity kc of the
material. Therefore,
Qexternal = U · Aarea · (T −Ts)
(14.72)
where T is the temperature of the reaction system and Ts is the temperature of the
external cooling/heating fluid. The external heat varies linearly with the temperature
of the reaction system as shown in Figure 14.15.
Substituting Equations 14.72 and 14.71 into Equation 14.69, we have:

This is the energy balance equation for open systems with external heat transfer,
thus nonisothermal. Along with the molar balance equation of a PFR (Equation 14.38)

or variable volume (gas).
14.4.1
Adiabatic continuous reactor
The isothermal and nonisothermal reactors are the most used when the reactions are
exothermic or endothermic and one can provide or withdraw heat to keep the reactor
isothermal (or not) and also determine how the temperature varies with the progress
of the reaction. The adiabatic reactor is a particular case in which there is no heat
exchange and the reactor is thermally insulated. The temperature and conversion vary
differently within the reactor. The term Qexternal is zero into Equation 14.69 or 14.73.

The temperature varies with the reaction time in the nonisothermal batch reactor. To

14.4.3
Adiabatic batch reactor
The adiabatic batch reactor is completely isolated; therefore, no external heat transfer
occurs. One can determine the temperature variation as a function of the reactant

In the continuous and batch reactors, some parameters allow to perform an analysis

Fjcpj(T −T0) + HrFA0 XA = UAs(T −Ts)

The heat transfer through the cooling/heating coil or jacket is due to the sensible heat.
By definition, Tf 0 is the temperature of the fluid at the entrance of the exchanger, cpf
is the fluid specific heat and v0 is the feed flow rate of the fluid, i.e.:
Qexternal = UAs(T −Ts)
and,
Qexternal = ρf vf 0cpf (Tf −Tf 0)
By equating the equations one can determine the temperature Tf and replacing it,
one obtains the heat removed or supplied:

•
If the heat capacity of the feed flow rate is high, i.e.:
ρf vf 0cpf →∞or

j
Fjcpj →∞
The reaction system will be isothermal, i.e., T →T0
•
If the heat capacity of removal or addition of heat is high due to the overall heat
transfer coefficient or due to the large heat transfer area (coil or jacket), then,
UAs →∞
In this case, the system will be isothermal when T →T0
•
On the other hand, if the heat capacity is very low due to the low overall heat
transfer coefficient or heat transfer area, then:
UAs →0
In this case, there will not be heat transfer and the reactor will be adiabatic.
Therefore, the temperature varies linearly with conversion.
In other nonisothermal cases, the parameters have significant influence on the
temperature profile, especially the parameters: flow rate, heat capacity, heat transfer
coefficients, and heat transfer area.
Let us consider as an example the adiabatic CSTR and an irreversible first-order
reaction at constant volume. The reaction rate is:
(−rA) = k0 exp (−E/(RT)) CA0(1 −XA)
The Arrhenius constant:
k = k0 exp (−E/(RT)) = k0 exp[−γ / (T /T0)]
where γ =


j
Fjcpj T0
(14.82)
where β is a new parameter which we will call the energy parameter, since it has
the enthalpy of reaction in the numerator and the sensible energy of heat flow in the
denominator.
Therefore, the temperature in an adiabatic CSTR or PFR system varies as follows:
T
T0

(14.83)
In a CSTR, the space time will be:
V
v0

XA
k0 exp(−γ/(T/T0)) (1 - XA)
(14.84)
Substituting T of Equation 14.83, we obtain XA:
XA =
τ · k0 exp(−γ/(1 + βXA))
1 + τ · k0 exp(−γ/(1 + βXA))
(14.85)
The results are shown in Figure 14:16 for different values of parameters γ and β. The
variable τ.k0, which is proportional to reactor volume for some feed conditions, is
shown as a function of conversion XA.
If the reactor operates isothermally (β = 0), the volume increases with conversion
since τ ≈V. Comparing to an exothermic reaction, the volume depends on β and γ.
For the same value of β = 0.2 (exothermic) but different activation energies, γ = 1.0
and 5.0, there is a large volume variation. One verifies the same by keeping γ = 5.0
and varying parameter β = −0.2 to 0.5.
More the exothermic reaction (β > 0) the smaller the variation of volume if con-
version is higher than 50%. On the other hand, for endothermic reactions (β < 0) the
reactor volume is higher if compared to isothermal reactions (β = 0).
Similar calculation can be performed to PFR reactors, noting that for an adiabatic
reactor we use the same energy balance equation, but the molar balance equation
should be in the integral form. Thus, using the same rate expressions for an irreversible
first-order reaction,
(−rA) = k0 exp (−E/(RT)) CA0(1 −XA)

PFR reactor is significantly smaller than the volume of an isothermal reactor for the
same reaction, especially if conversions are higher than 50%.

conditions for the particular case β = 0.5 and γ = 5.0 is shown in Figure 14.18. One
notes significant differences especially for conversions higher than 50%, which makes
the adiabatic reactor to be very important.

Solution
The reaction takes place in an adiabatic CSTR reactor in liquid phase. To calculate the
conversion we use the CSTR equation:
V
v0
= τ =
XA
k(1 −XA)
(14.91)
Since the initial concentrations of A and B are respectively 10 and 40 mol/L, the
reactant A is the limiting one.
(−rA) = 33 × 109 exp(−20, 000/(RT))C2
A0(1 −XA)(M −XA)
where:
M = CB0

Therefore:
τ = CA0
XA
33 × 109 exp(−20, 000/(RT))C2
A0(1 −XA)(M −XA)
(14.92)
There is temperature variation into the exponential term of the rate constant.
Therefore, if the reaction occurs adiabatically, we should determine the tempera-
ture variation using the energy balance for the adiabatic reactor, whose solution was
presented in Equation 14.83:

(14.93)
β = 0.407
Then:
T = T0(1 + 0.407XA)
(14.94)
We substitute T into Equation 14.92. To solve and make it explicit as a function
of conversion, we can simplify the equation. Since M = 4.0, M is much higher than
XA. Therefore, we simplify the rate:
(−rA) = 33 × 109 exp(−20, 000/(RT))MC2
A0(1 −XA)

Chemical reaction engineering
Thus, the kinetic expression is considered pseudo first order and by making it
explicit as a function of conversion, we obtain an equation that has already been
deduced (Equation 14.85).

XA = 0.337 and T = 56.7◦C
XA = 0.994 and T = 134.3◦C
Case 2–If v0 = 0.02 L/min
τ = V
v0

0.02 = 75 min
By Equation 14.94, we obtain:
XA = 1.0 →total conversion
k0MCA0 = 9.9 × 1013
Case 3–If v0 = 0.2 L/min, T0 = 50◦C and CA0 = 3.78 mol/L, then:
β = 0.138
γ = 31.2
XA = 0.897
T = 90◦C
One observes that increasing the inlet temperature (T0) and reducing the feed flow rate
(v0), thus increasing residence time, the conversion increases.

Chapter 15
Specific reactors
The kinetics of reactions is specific for different reaction systems and processes and
valid for isothermal and nonisothermal reactors. The effects of the kinetics on the
conversion, selectivity, or yield depend on the reaction and may be quite pronounced.
Liquid or gas phase reactions with high heat capacity can be performed in specific
reactors, which operate isothermally or not. We will study the most common cases
such as semibatch reactors, recycle reactors, fixed-bed reactors, and reactors with
membranes.
15.1
SEMIBATCH REACTOR
The semibatch reactor (tank or tubular) contains a large amount of liquid reactant
that continuously reacts on the addition of a second reactant (liquid or gas), which is
instantly consumed. The kinetics is the same, but consumption increases over reaction
time as the second component is added (Figure 15.1).
The semibatch reactors can be operated by three different manners:
1
The tank contains a liquid reactant B into which the reactant A (liquid or gas) is
continuously added—isothermal system.

The reactant concentration profiles have been represented in Figure 15.2 for
semibatch reactor under isothermal conditions.
The concentration is uncertain because it varies over time. Consider a semiopen
system according to the scheme shown in Figure 15.3.
FA represents the molar flow of reactant A, then:
FA0 −FA + ( −rA) · V(t) = dnA
dt
(15.1)
where (−rA) = reaction rate, FA = molar flow of component A, and V = system volume
which varies over time.
Since FA0 = CA0v0 and the reagent A is completely consumed during the reaction,
there is no outlet flow of A. Therefore,
FA = 0

Figure 15.3 Molar mass balance in the semibatch reactor.
The volume variation over time caused by addition of reagent A into reagent B
(present in the tank) is calculated by means of an overall mass balance taking into
account the average density ρ in the system without chemical reaction. Thus:
ρ0v0 −0 + 0 = d(ρV)
dt
(15.3)
Assuming that the system average density is constant, i.e.:
ρ = ρ0 = constant
We obtain:
v0 = dV
dt
(15.4)
With the boundary condition:
t = 0 →V = V0
We obtain the volume variation over time, i.e.:
V = V0 + v0t
(15.5)
Or dividing by v0,we obtain the following expression as a function space time:
τ = τ0 + t
(15.6)

Let us consider an irreversible second-order reaction:
A + B →products
where the liquid reactant B with concentration CB is present in the reactor of volume
V and the reactant A is added at a constant rate. Therefore, the kinetics may be
represented by:
(−rA) = kCACB
(15.10)
The concentration of reactant B is much higher than A and varies slightly with the
addition of the reactant A, therefore one may assume that its variation is negligible
with respect to A. In this case, one assumes a pseudo first-order reaction.
(−rA) = kCACB0 = k∗CA
(15.11)

k∗= kCB0
Substituting the rate expression 15.11 into Equation 15.9, we obtain:

REACTOR WITH RECYCLE
The reactors with recycle are continuous and may be tanks or tubes. Their main feature
is increasing productivity by returning part of unconverted reactants to the entrance
of the reactor. For this reason, the reactant conversion increases successively and also
the productivity with respect to the desired products. The recycle may also be applied
in reactors in series or representing models of nonideal reactors, in which the recycle
parameter indicates the deviation from ideal behavior. As limiting cases, we have ideal
tank and tubular reactors representing perfect mixture when the recycle is too large,
or plug flow reactor(PFR) when there is no recycle.

where:
CA = CA0(1 −XA)
and:
CA1 = CA0(1 −XA1)
To simplify, we assume an irreversible first-order reaction as follows: A →Products,
whose kinetics at constant volume is represented by:
(−rA) = kCA = kCA0 (1 −XA)
Substituting the rate expression into Equation 15.16 and integrating, we obtain:
τ = −1
k ln (1 −XA)
(1 −XA1)
(15.17)
Conversion XA1 is still unknown and maybe determined by the balance at the
intersection(1)by calculating the inlet concentration CA1 or conversion XA1. Thus, at
the intersection (1), we have:
v01 = v0 + v02
FA01 = FA0 + FA02
CA1 · v01 = CA0v0 + CAv02
(a)
Then, the concentration CA1 will be:
CA1 = CA0v0 + CAv02

τrecycle = −1

(15.21)

424
Chemical reaction engineering
This expression depends on the recycle ratio R and there are two particular cases:
1
If there is no recycle, R = 0, the reactor behaves like an ideal PFR.
τPFR = −1
k ln(1 −XA)
(15.22)
If the recycle is large (R →∞), there will be a mixing effect resulting in a solution
corresponding to the ideal CSTR reactor. In this case, expanding the logarithmic
function in series and neglecting the terms of higher order, one obtains:
τCSTR = 1
k
XA
(1 −XA)
(15.23)
Therefore, depending on the recycle ratio, one obtains solutions that may indi-
cate an increase in the final conversion or productivity and may represent behavior
of nonideal reactor. The recycle ratio would be a parameter that indicates the devi-
ation from ideal behavior. It is equivalent to the average residence time, which also
indicates the extent of deviation from the ideal behavior of a reactor.
Example
E15.2 A liquid phase reaction A →R + S takes place in a system consisting of a CSTR
and a PFR reactor with recycle. One introduces1 kmol/m3 of reagent A into the first
reactor. Both CSTR and PFR operate isothermally at 300◦C and atmospheric pres-
sure. The volume of the first reactor is 0.086 m3 and the inlet flow is 1.6 m3/ks. The
conversion at the outlet of the PFR is 90%.
It is a first-order reaction and the rate constant is (−rA) = 8 CA kmol/(m3 h).
Calculate the PFR volume considering a recycle ratio of R = 1.

PSEUDO-HOMOGENEOUS FIXED-BED REACTOR
In the ideal CSTR and PFR reactors in homogeneous phase, the reactants and products
constitute a single phase. The homogeneous reaction takes place in a liquid or gas
phase whose concentration varies throughout the PFR, while in the CSTR reactor the
concentration is instantaneous.
In a specific case, when the reaction takes place on the catalyst present on the
internal wall of the tube and the flow is uniform, the behavior is equal to a reaction
in homogeneous phase.
If the catalyst consists of particles, one has a fixed or mobile stationary particles
reactor. The flow is no longer uniform and the reaction is considered heterophasic.
In this case, the catalyst consists of solid particles, but the reactants and products
are gas or liquid and may flow through the particle bed in the concurrent or counter
current direction. The reaction may be catalytic or noncatalytic and takes place on
the particle surface and/or within the pores of the catalyst. In this case, the system is
heterophasic and may be solid–gas type, solid–liquid, or solid–liquid–gas taking place
in the respective reactors: fixed or mobile-bed, trickle bed, and slurry bed.
These reactors exhibit complex fluid dynamics. The velocity profile in a cross
section is not uniform due to the influence of the wall and the porosity of the catalytic
bed, causing the nonideality of the continuous reactor.

mechanisms: molecular diffusion, Knudsen diffusion within the particle pores, and sur-
face diffusion, depending on the geometrical characteristics of the pores and particles.
Usually, the effective diffusion is determined combining these three phenomena.
Therefore, there are axial and radial dispersion effects due to mass and heat transfer
phenomena in isothermal and nonisothermal systems.
For mass transfer by convection, the mass flow is given by:
m = kcC
where C = concentration gradient (radial or axial) and kc = mass transfer coefficient.
Fick’s law describes the mass transfer by diffusion within the pores as:
˙m = De
dC
dz
where dC/dz = concentration gradient in the pore (cylinder) and De = effective gas
diffusion in the pore.
The Reynolds number is a flow characteristic, and if defined as a function of
particle diameter, it will be:
Re = udp
ν
u = superficial gas velocity in the cross section
dp = particle diameter
ν = kinematic viscosity.
(15.24)
Moreover the Péclet number(Pé) characterizes radial and axial dispersions, which
represent the convective and diffusive coefficients in the pores (see Chapter 24):
Pé = udp
De
= Convective transport rate
Diffusive transport rate
(15.25)
where u = superficial gas velocity in the cross section, dp = particle diameter, and De=
effective diffusivity.
The radial and axial dispersions generally exist in a particulate catalytic bed reac-
tor, but under certain conditions one can neglect the radial gradients. One can take into
account the uniform velocity over a cross section (ideal PFR) when the ratio between
tube and particle diameters is higher than 30 and when the Reynolds number is high,
characterizing a quasi-turbulent flow, i.e., high superficial velocities (high flows). In
this case, Pé can be calculated according to the empirical equation (Aris,1969):
Pé = 1 + 19.4
dp
dt
2−1
(15.26)
where dt = tube diameter.

428
Chemical reaction engineering
To Pé = 10 and ratio (dt/dp) ≥30, the radial dispersion can be neglected under
isothermal conditions. The superficial velocity is constant and the radial concentration
is negligible.
To Pé ≈2, the axial dispersion can be neglected if the ratio between the reactor
length and diameter tube is higher than 50 (L/dt > 50).
To a very high Pé number, one can consider a fixed-bed reactor as a pseudo-
homogeneous one, therefore, a reactor with ideal behavior. In these conditions, its
superficial velocity is high and/or the effective gas diffusion in the pores (De) is low.
It means that if (1/Pé) →0, the gas residence time in the reactor tends to the average
residence time of an ideal reactor according to Figure E15.6. Figure 15.6 shows Pé
values for different flows and the limits to achieve ideal conditions. The criterion
(1/Pé) = 0.002 is used as a limit for a PFR in ideal conditions.

Therefore, the Péclet number is an important parameter to evaluate if mass transfer
limitations take place, and the Reynolds number to verify if the reactor is in turbu-
lent flow and consequently quasi-ideal conditions in which one may apply the basic
equations for ideal reactors.

E15.3 Hydrogenation of toluene was carried out in a tubular fixed-bed reactor con-
taining a catalyst (ρ = 2.3 g/cm3). The reaction is in gas phase operating isothermally
at 600◦C and pressure of 10 atm. One introduces the reactants as 20% toluene,
40% hydrogen, and balance in inert (%vol.) with a volumetric flow of 400 L/min.

Therefore:

The criterion for a reactor with ideal behavior is 1/Pé = 2 × 10−3.
Therefore, the mass transfer limitations and diffusion effects are negligible.
The Reynolds and Péclet numbers indicate a pseudo-homogeneous reactor behav-
ior, close to an ideal reactor. In such a condition, one can calculate the catalyst mass
using the equations of an ideal PFR.

MEMBRANE REACTORS
The membrane reactors enable one to separate the reaction products increasing the
production capacity and also to shift the reaction beyond the equilibrium under the
same conditions of pressure and temperature. This type of reactor consists of a perme-
able membrane with selective porous walls. The membrane should be able to withstand
high temperatures and sintering without blocking fluid flow.
An example is the use of membrane reactors to generate and separate hydrogen to
fuel cells.
Hydrogen can be obtained by steam reforming and autothermal reforming of
methane which is represented by the following reactions:
Steam reforming:
CH4 + H2O ⇔CO + 3H2
H298 K= 206 kJ/mol
Dry reforming:
CH4 + CO2 ⇔2CO + 2H2
H298 K= 247 kJ/mol
Partial oxidation of methane:
CH4 + 1/2O2 ⇔CO + 2H2
H298 K = −36 kJ/mol
Water gas shift reaction:
CO + H2O ↔CO2 + H2
H298 K = −41 kJ/mol.
Steam reforming and dry reforming are endothermic, but partial oxidation of
methane and water gas shift reactions are exothermic. The autothermal process
becomes exothermic and is thermodynamically favorable.
Two types of membrane reactors are shown in Figure 15.7:
1
Catalytic membrane (active porous wall) and
2
Noncatalytic membrane (inert).
In the first case, the membrane itself contains the catalyst, such as platinum dis-
persed on the membrane. The reaction takes place within the membrane and the
products pass through well-defined pores.
In the second case, the membrane is porous and inert but the catalyst is placed
inside the reactor where the reactions take place. One of the products is usually sepa-
rated by passing through the inert porous membrane, the other passing directly to the
exit of the reactor. Thereby, one increases the yield or selectivity to the desired product,
also increasing the conversion since the reaction shifts toward products.
Let us consider the following reaction:
A + B →R + S

properties.

The equilibrium constant at 227◦C is 0.5. The inlet flow into reactor is 2 mol/min and
its volume is 10 L. Calculate the outlet flow of R assuming kc = 0.3 s−1.

Comparison of reactors
The choice of the reactor is very important and should be carried out on technical
basis. There are three main criteria to distinguish batch, tubular, and tank reactors:
1
Reactor volume
2
Productivity
3
Selectivity
For the first criterion, one compares the reactor volumes based on the average
residence time for a given extent of reaction or final conversion. The average residence
time depends on the reaction kinetics and therefore the reaction rate, which in turn
depends on whether the reaction takes place at constant volume or variable volume.
In a system at constant volume, one obtains directly a ratio between the volumes,
because the average residence time is equal to space time which is defined as the ratio
between reactor volume and inlet volumetric flow in the reactor. For the same con-
version, the ratio between volumes is proportional. Since the average residence time
in a PFR reactor is similar to the reaction time in a batch reactor, we may assume
that they have similar behaviors and then we compare only the ideal tubular reactors
(PFR — plug flow reactor) to the ideal tank reactors (CSTR—continuous stirred-tank
reactor).
16.1
COMPARISON OF VOLUMES
To visualize the difference between the volumes and contact times in the reactors, we
observe Figure 16.1, which shows the inverse of rate as a function of conversion. This
curve represents the kinetic behavior of the reaction irrespective of the reactor type.
The reaction rate decreases with increasing conversion, therefore the inverse of rate
increases and is positive.
The basic equations for the reactors have already been seen as:

Analyzing the equations of PFR, CSTR, and batch reactors represented by Equa-
tions 16.1–16.3, one notes that the area under the curve AC represents the integral
in the PFR equation, whereas the rectangle area ABCD represents the CSTR equa-
tion. The rate related to the outlet concentration in the CSTR is equal to the average
concentration in the tank, because perfect mixture is considered.
For a given constant temperature and reactions taking place at constant volume,
these areas are directly proportional to the space time and also to the average resi-
dence time in the reactors, assuming the same inlet volumetric flow and the same final
conversion. Therefore, the areas represent the reactors volume.
From Figure 16.1, one concludes that the CSTR volume is always greater than
the PFR volume. The space time or average residence time (contact time) in the PFR
is always smaller than in the CSTR. Since the reaction time in the batch reactor is
equal to the contact time in the PFR, we can compare the batch reactor directly to the

Comparison of reactors
439
PFR. If the reaction takes place at variable volume, then the average residence times are
different from the space times and as a consequence, the volumes are not proportional.
Figure 16.1 illustrates that for low conversions, for example, XA1, the CSTR and
PFR volumes are similar, since the respective areas AEFG and under A′F curve are
similar. As the desired conversion is decreased, the areas for the two reactor types
approach the same value. Small reactors lead to small conversions and are useful for
kinetic studies.
Let us consider some cases and compare CSTR and PFR volumes in order to verify
the most significant comparison criteria.
16.1.1
Irreversible first-order reaction at constant volume
The reaction rate expression is:
(−rA) = kCA = kCA0(1 −XA)
Therefore, substituting the rate expression into PFR (16.3) and CSTR (16.2) equations
and integrating, we obtain respectively:
τ = −1
kln (1 −XA)
(16.4)
τ = 1

(16.5)
For the same volumetric feed flow, the space times are directly proportional to
the corresponding volumes. The ratio between CSTR and PFR volumes considering
εA = 0,
VCSTR
VPFR
is shown in Figure 16.2 (curve 1) as a function of final conversion.
For conversions below 20%, the volumes have same order of magnitude, not
varying more than 15%. Calculating the ratio,
VCSTR
VPFR
for XA = 0.20, we obtain the value of 1.12. The CSTR volume is slightly larger than
the PFR volume (i.e., 12%).
However, for conversions above 50%, the CSTR and PFR volumes differ signif-
icantly. For a conversion XA = 0.80, this ratio is 2.5. Therefore, the CSTR volume is
2.5 times larger than the PFR volume.

The ratio of volumes as a function of conversion is shown in Figure 16.2 (curves 2 and
3). The influence of parameter M is significant, especially for high conversions.
The influence of the reaction order on the CSTR and PFR volumes is considerable
for first- and second-order reactions, M = 1 and conversion XA = 0.80. Taking into
account a second-order kinetics, the CSTR volume is about five times larger than for
a first order. On the other hand, this ratio is lower in the PFR, since the PFR volume is
only about 2.5 times larger for a second-order kinetics, compared to a first-order and
admitting kinetic constants of same order of magnitude.

Comparison of reactors
441
16.1.3
Reactions at variable volume
The influence of volume variation during a reaction, where there is contraction or
expansion of fluid, on the CSTR and PFR volumes may be expressed as a function of
the parameter εA, for first- or second-order reactions. The effect of εA on the CSTR or
PFR volume is depicted in Figure 16.2 (curve 4 with M = 1).
Increasing εA (when εA > 0, expansion), the ratio between the reactors volume,
VCSTR
VPFR
increases as well with respect to the reaction whose volume does not change (εA = 0),
for the same final conversion. When contraction occurs (εA < 0), we have the opposite.
For example, for an irreversible second-order reaction with εA = 1 and conversion
XA = 0.80, we obtain:
VCSTR
VPFR
= 5.1
Examples
E16.1 Effect of parameter M
Butanol and monobutylphthalate (MBF) react in the presence of H2SO4 forming
dibutylphthalate and water. Reaction can be carried out in CSTR or PFR reactor.
The reactants are placed in two separate tanks containing 0.2 mol/L of MBF and
1 mol/L of butanol and fed to the reactor under 10 L/h and 30 L/h, respectively.
The reactants are mixed before entering the reactor. The reaction rate constant is
k = 7.4 × 10−2 L/(mol min). Calculate the CSTR and PFR volume separately and show
the relation between the volumes when conversion is 70%.
Solution
Reaction rate expression: −rA = kCACB, where A = Butanol and B = MBF (reactants).
Total volumetric flow in the reactor entrance:
v01 + v02 = v0 = 40 L/h
The concentrations in the reactor entrance:
CA01 · v01 + CA02 · v02 = CA0 · v0
With the previous data, we obtain:
CA0 = 5 × 10−2 mol/L
CB0 = 7.5 × 10−1 mol/L

In the CSTR: for XA = 0.70

PRODUCTIVITY
The second criterion takes into account the yield and productivity for a given reactor
volume.
Definition
The production rate in a system is defined as the number of moles of product, or
converted reactant to main product, per unit of volume and time. It is an overall
average rate, different from reaction rate defined previously, which is local.
Therefore, if αA is the number of moles of reactant A converted to product over an
average contact time or average residence time, one defines the productivity as (Hill,
1977):
W = αA
t = CA0 · XA
t
(16.7)
However, the average residence time previously defined depends on the system used:
if at constant or at variable volume.

If εA ̸= 0

and

In any case:

Therefore, productivity (W) in both cases is given by the following equations:
CSTR:

To illustrate, let us consider a reversible forward and reverse first-order reaction A ↔R.
The resulting rate as a function of conversion is known. Substituting it into Equations
16.10 and 16.11, we obtain the productivity in PFR and CSTR:

The productivity, or average production rate, depends on the final conversion and

inversely proportional to the reactor volume. The ratio between CSTR and PFR rates
and the respective volumes ratio are shown in Figure 16.3.
The unitary production of the CSTR decreases significantly with respect to the
PFR at high conversions, while the CSTR volume increases much more with respect to
the PFR. For instance, at a conversion of 70% of equilibrium conversion, the CSTR
productivity is 50% lower than the PFR, considering the same feed conditions. To
increase the CSTR or PFR productivity, one can make use of reactors in series.
16.3
YIELD/SELECTIVITY
If more than one reaction takes place and a specific product or by-product is desired,
the reactor choice and reaction conditions are very important, since the kinetics of
each reaction depends on the temperature and reaction order.
Initially, let us define yield and selectivity for multiple reactions occurring simul-
taneously, for reactions in parallel, series, or mixed. When there is only one reaction
step, the yield is confused with the conversion.
Considering the reaction system:
A + B
k1
−→R (desired product)
A + B
k2
−→S (undesired product)

Comparison of reactors
447
The definitions follow (Hill, 1977):
Yield:
ϕA = number of mol of A transformed in desired product (R)
number of mol of A reacted (total)
(16.14)
Operational Yield:
ϕo = number of mol of A transformed in desired product (R)
total number of mol fed into reactor
(16.15)
Selectivity:
SA = ϕA
(same definition of yield)
or
SA = number of mol of A transformed in desired product (R)
number of mol of A transformed in undesired product (S)
(16.16)
Since the reactant A is present in both chemical reactions, we take A as a reference.
Let us consider the extent of reaction α1 and α2 (for first and second reactions,
respectively). Then, by definition of yield ϕA or selectivity SA, the mole number of A
transformed in R at the time (t) will be α1 (batch) or position (z) (continuous), and
therefore,
ϕA = SA =
aα1
r(nA0 −nA)
(16.17)
where (FA0–FA) is the molar flow of A reacted in both reactions.
If F0 is the total molar flow fed into reactor (reactants and inert), the operational
yield is as follows:
φo = So = aα1
r · n0
(16.18)
Similarly, the selectivity is defined considering α2 as the molar flow of product S formed
through the second reaction:
SA = a1α1
a2 · α2
(16.19)
where a1, a2, and r are the stoichiometric coefficients of the respective compounds and
reactions.
The yield and selectivity represent a local measure and depend on the feed and
reactor type. In the CSTR, perfect mixing is obtained, which leads the local yield to

be equal to the final yield, i.e., since the reaction is instantaneous, the outlet flow has
the same product concentration as the reactor.
Depending on the residence time or space velocity, the reactor is not suitable for
multiple reactions where the by-products formed depending on the residence time in
the reactor.
In the PFR, the concentration varies along the reactor and the yield as well (there-
fore we have local yields). Depending on the residence time or space velocity, the desired
product formation can be facilitated; on the other hand, undesired by-products might
also take place.
Comparing CSTR and PFR for the same conversion and space velocity, the yield
in the PFR is higher, since the final A concentration is lower and R concentration
is higher. The yields in the CSTR and PFR reactors are high always when the final
product concentration is high, while the reactant concentration is low. Therefore, the
higher the α1 and (nA0–nA) the higher the ϕA.
Depending on the initial concentration, one can design different feed into reactors
in order to obtain a higher yield, as shown in Figure 16.4. With two reactants, A
and B, both with low concentration, the CSTR is the best choice. However, if the
concentrations are high, depending on the residence time, the yield in the PFR will be
higher. If the concentrations have different levels, one can use the schemes (c) and (d)
with intermittent addition in several positions in the PFR reactor or many CSTR in
series.
16.4
OVERALL YIELD
As seen, the overall yield in a CSTR is equal to the local yield, since the reaction
is instantaneous. On the other hand, the concentration in the PFR changes along the
reactor, and therefore, the yield and selectivity are also local, varying along the reactor.

Comparison of reactors
449
In the CSTR, the overall yield will be:

A = ϕA =
aα1
r(CA0 −CA)
(16.20)
In the PFR, the concentration varies (dCA) in a volume dV, and thus, the local yield
in the differential form will be according to Equation 16.17:
dϕA = −a · dα1
r · dCA
(16.21)
where a and r are the stoichiometric coefficients of the chemical reaction.
Therefore, the final concentration of the desired product will be:
α1 = −

(16.22)
Substituting Equation 16.22 into overall yield Equation 16.20, we obtain the following
expression for a system at constant volume (as a function of concentration):

Effect of reaction order
Let us consider the reactions in parallel:
A
k1
−→R,
where R is the desired product
A
k2
−→S,
S is the undesired product
The kinetic equations for systems at constant volume have a generic order, i.e.:
rR = k1 · Ca1
A
rS = k2 · Ca2
A
(16.24)
The number of moles of A transformed into R per unit of volume and time represents
the formation rate of R, while the total number of moles of A reacted, under the same
conditions, represents the consumption rate of A or formation rate of all products,
then the local yield can be written as follows:
ϕA =
rR
(rR + rS) =
rR
(−rA)
(16.25)

(16.27)
The overall yield in the CSTR is equal to the local yield, Equation 16.27, while in the
PFR the yield should be integrated, substituting Equation 16.27 into Equation 16.23,
i.e.:

High yield is naturally desired and as the above equations show, they depend on the
kinetics of each reaction, particularly the reaction order and kinetic constants for each
step.
Analyzing the effect of the reaction order, having in mind that R is the desired
product, by Equation 16.27, we note that if a1 is higher than a2, then the difference
(a1–a2) is negative and therefore, the concentration appears in the denominator. In this
case, to obtain a high yield, the local concentration should be high, i.e., low conversion
so that ϕA →1. Otherwise, if a2 > a1, the concentration remains in the numerator and
the local CA concentration should be low, i.e., high conversion. For high conversions,
the PFR reactor is suggested; while for low conversions, the CSTR is more appropriate.
If a1 is larger than a2, the CSTR is the best solution.
16.4.2
Effects of kinetic constants
The yield also depends on the reaction rate constants or specific reaction rates (k1 and
k2), and therefore depends on the reaction temperature. According to Arrhenius, the
ratio between these constants is:
k2
k1
= k021 e−(E2−E1)/RT
(16.29)
The effect of temperature depends on the activation energy of each reaction. If both
energies are equal, the ratio depends only on the ratio between the frequency fac-
tors k021. If E2 > E1, then we have the difference (E2 −E1) = E > 0, and thus the
exponential term,
e−E/RT

Comparison of reactors
451
increases with increasing temperature and consequently k2/k1 increases. On the other
hand, if E1 > E2, the exponential term decreases with increasing temperature and
k2/k1 also decreases, indicating that the constant k2 diminishes with respect to k1.
Consequently, an increase in temperature enhances the desired product (R) yield if
E1 > E2. However, the yield is more sensitive to temperature variations if E2 > E1. In
this case, the desired product yield is higher by decreasing the temperature.
E16.3 Let us consider a system with two irreversible decomposition reactions at con-
stant volume. The first one is a second-order reaction while the other is a first-order
reaction, as in the following rate expressions:
rR = k1 · C2
A
rS = k2 · CA
(16.30)
This reaction may be carried out in PFR and CSTR reactors separately. Calculate the
local and overall yields as a function of outlet concentration in the reactor, considering
the same space velocity and constant temperature. Obtain the yield and selectivity to
the desired product R from the first reaction.

At low conversions, yields in the CSTR and PFR are similar, but as the reactant A
concentration decreases, or its conversion increases, the yields become quite different.
However, the PFR yield is always higher than the CSTR.
Opposite to the reactors’ volume comparison, in which the CSTR volume is always
larger than the PFR, the yield in the PFR is higher than in the CSTR. The same analysis
is valid for selectivity comparison between CSTR and PFR reactors.

the desired product with the undesired one.

Presence of two reactants
When there is the simultaneous presence of a reactant—in this case B—in two par-
allel reactions, the yield is defined with respect to the reactant participating in both
reactions. For instance,
A + B
k1

B
k2

Assuming generic order for the product reaction rates:
rR = k1Ca1

Chemical reaction engineering
Analogously, if (b2 −b1) > 0, then it is necessary to have low concentrations of B at
the reactor outlet. Therefore, a good scheme is a PFR reactor with A fed at the reactor
inlet while B fed at several positions so that reagent B may be immediately consumed.
This sequential B feeding allows complete consumption of reagent A until the end of
the reactor.
Otherwise (b2 −b1) < 0, both reactants should leave the reactor at high concen-
tration. A CSTR reactor is the best option.
Example
E16.4 The thermal decomposition of butane in butadiene takes place at 650◦C and
1 atm. But then, butadiene cracks and polymerizes according to the following rates:
Butadiene

where:

The feed into reactor comprises 1 mol/L of hydrocarbons distributed in 72.5% butene
and 27.5% butadiene. Determine the final conditions in the CSTR and PFR reactors,
assuming an overall yield of 80% of the maximum yield of dimer.
Solution
Butadiene is the main reactant in the system of parallel reactions, in which the dimer
(R) is the main product. The CSTR yield is given by Equation 16.34:

Then,

= 0.49 ≈0.50
The maximum yield in the PFR for χ∗= 0.50 (Figure 16.5) is 
PFR = 0.67. Assuming
80% of this maximum yield, then the overall yield will be 
PFR = 0.5. Therefore, the
outlet concentration in the CSTR and PFR is 0.65 and 0.35 and conversion 0.35 and
0.65, respectively.
E16.5 Let us consider an example involving two components in the first reaction. The

For 80% conversion of B, the CSTR yield is 85%. What is the PFR yield for the same
conversion?

The consumption rate of B in both reactions is (−rB) = rR + 2rS, therefore the local
yield will be:

REACTIONS IN SERIES
Reactions in series in a system at constant volume, where R is the desired product and
S is the undesired one, are represented by:
A
k1

For this particular case, we determine the concentration profiles CA, CR, and CS
(deduced in Section 6.1), which are dimensionless:
ϕA = e−τ

To determine the maximum yield of R, we calculate its maximum dimension-
less concentration ϕR max (according to Equation 6.13 or Equation 16.40) and the
corresponding time.
ϕRmax = χ(χ/1−χ)
(16.40)

Comparison of reactors
457
The average residence time in the PFR is equal to the reaction time in the batch reactor.
Therefore, the previous equations are valid for the batch and PFR. However, the yield
and selectivity vary along the PFR reactor. The PFR overall yield, taking into account
the outlet concentration, is:

PFR =
1
(1 −ϕA) −


(χ −1)(ϕA −ϕχ

(16.41)
The maximum yield of R is determined by Equation 16.40. Thus,

PFR =
ϕRmax
(1 −ϕA) =
1
(χ(χ/χ−1) −χ)
(16.42)
For the CSTR, the residence time is different from the batch. Therefore, from the
kinetics of reactions, one obtains the following equality for the same space time:
τ = CA0 −CA
k1CA
=
CR
k1CA −k2CR
(16.43)
We make it dimensionless and determine the concentration of R:
ϕR =
ϕA(1 −ϕA)
ϕA + χ(1 −ϕA)
(16.44)
The overall yield in the CSTR will be:

CSTR =
CR
CA0 −CA
=

1 + χ(1 −ϕA)

(16.45)
The results are shown in Figure 16.7. The CSTR yield is always lower than the PFR
and also depends on the χ parameter, which relates the reaction rate constants:
k2
k1
The difference is significant for high conversions of reactant A, i.e., for low values of
its dimensionless concentration (ϕA). When the reaction rate constant for R formation
is higher than its decomposition (k1 > k2), then PFR yield will be much higher in
high conversions, decreasing significantly when (k2 > k1). Finally, the reaction rate
constants depend on temperature and activation energy, which may influence in the
reactor choice.
The maximum yield or selectivity is obtained for the maximum concentration of
product R, by:

With XA = 0.35, we obtain the dimensionless concentration of A, i.e., ϕA = CA/CA0 =

CSTR = 0.68, then we obtain χ = 0.874.

Chapter 17
Combination of reactors
So far we have studied separately the continuous-flow stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and
the plug flow reactor (PFR) each with their distinct characteristics. When comparing
them, we have seen that for the same final conversion, the volume of the CSTR is
always larger than that of the PFR, especially for high conversions. Additionally, the
average residence time in the CSTR is also higher than that in the PFR. It is important
to note, however, that the yield and selectivity are always higher in a PFR as compared
to a CSTR.
The kinetics is the same for any system and the rate depends on concentration
and temperature. The inverse of rate as a function of conversion is displayed again in
Figure 17.1, this behavior depends on the reaction (reversible or irreversible) and also
the order.
As discussed in Chapter 16, the basic equations show that the area under the
kinetic curve ACDA’ represents the integral of the balance equation in a PFR, whereas
the rectangular area ACDF’ represents the balance equation in a CSTR. Both represent
the average residence time of the reactants in the reactors.
Figure 17.1 shows that it is possible to combine reactors and vary their residence
times or volumes so that the final volume is equivalent or equal to the volume of a
single reactor. The main advantage of combining reactors in series or parallel is to
utilize less volume to yield the same efficiency, yield, selectivity, and final conversion
as much as larger reactor yields. Two reactors in series are represented in Figure 17.1.
If one assumes a PFR model for both reactors, the shaded areas under the kinetic
curve ABEA’ and BCDE represent the two PFRs in series. The conversion at the outlet
of the first and second reactors is XA1 and XA2, respectively. Note that the area is
proportional to the volume of each reactor, and therefore the total volume is the sum
of the volumes V 1+V 2= V PFR.
Now consider two CSTR reactors in series. The hatched area ABEE’ is proportional
to the volume of the first one, while the area from BDCF to the second reactor. These
volumes are distinct and their sum differs from that equivalent to a single CSTR that
reaches the same final conversion, which is proportional to the area ACDF’. Therefore,
the combination of two CSTR reactors in series results in a reduction in total reactor
volume, when targeting the same final conversion. There will be different average
residence times in each reactor, increasing the final yield. Note that the combination
of multiple CSTR reactors in series tends to approach a single PFR reactor.

Figure 17.1 Inverse of reaction rate as a function of conversion.
Besides the series combination, reactors may be placed in parallel. Consequently,
the final production increases with reactors of smaller volume compared to a larger
single reactor. Various combinations are possible as illustrated in Figure 17.2.
Figure 17.2c and d shows diagrams of reactors in parallel. For this combination,
it is essential that the conversion at the outlet of the reactors is the same. This leads to
equal residence times in both reactors. If the outlet concentrations are different, then
there will be mixture and the final concentration will be different from that desired.
The schemes (e) and (f) show separately the CSTR and PFR reactors in series. The
residence time in each reactor is shorter and therefore the volumes are smaller. The
sum of residence time or volume for PFR in series is equal to a single PFR with same
final conversion. However, the sum of volume for CSTR in series is not the same for
a single one with same final conversion.
The scheme (g) combining CSTR and PFR in parallel is unusual. This combination
also requires equal conversions at the outlet of each reactor. Note, however, that the
volumes are different from one another.
The schemes (a) and (b) involving CSTR and PFR in series are used when it is
required to increase the final conversion. Note that the reaction rate is an important
parameter in this analysis. In case (a) PFR + CSTR, first consider the PFR. As the
conversion increases, the reaction rate decreases along the PFR. Therefore, it would
take a long time to achieve the desired high conversion. Therefore, a CSTR is connected
in series to complete this reaction. In case (b) CSTR + PFR, first consider the CSTR.
Only a limited conversion may be obtained at the outlet of the CSTR and of course this
is dependent on the space velocity of the reactor. In this case, a PFR is then connected
in series to achieve higher conversions.

The scheme (h) is specific and aims to optimize the volume and yield. The conver-
sion is low at the outlet of the first CSTR, but when a PFR is added in series, a higher
final conversion is achieved. In order to complete the reaction, a CSTR with smaller
volume is connected in series. The contact time or total residence time should be equal
to the sum of the intermediate times (each reactor).
Finally, the scheme (i) shows a reactor with recycle (see Section 15.2) which aims to
increase productivity by recycling unconverted reactants. The conversion at the outlet
of the PFR depends on the recycle ratio, which is the ratio between the recycled flow
and the inlet flow.
17.1
REACTORS IN SERIES
Let us consider two CSTR and PFR reactors in series as shown in Figure 17.2e and
f or in Figure 17.3a. If initial concentration of A is CA0 and volumetric flow is v0,
then the initial molar flow is given by FA0. At the exit of the first reactor, we have the
concentration CA1 and subsequently decreasing concentrations, CAi−1 and CAi−2, until
reaching the final concentration. In a system with constant or variable volume, one
calculates the corresponding molar flows FAi. Conversion is defined with respect to the
limiting reactant at the inlet of the first reactor such that the conversion varies between
0 and XA, at the outlet of the last reactor. One should always take as reference the initial

concentration at the inlet of the first reactor and not in each reactor separately. The
intermediate conversions must always be lower than the final conversion and should
range from XAi−1 to XAi.
Constructing a molar balance with respect to the limiting reactant A in the ith
reactor (with volume Vi), we obtain (Figure 17.3a):
FA −(FA + dFA) + rA dVi = 0
(17.1)
Then,
−dFA = rA dVi
Since conversion is defined as:
XAi−1 = FA0 −FAi−1
FA0
;
XA = FA0 −FA
FA0

XAi = FA0 −FAi

For CSTR reactors in series, we construct the molar balance in the ith reactor as in
Figure 17.3b. Since the concentration in the tank is uniform and equal to the outlet
concentration, we take directly the inlet and outlet molar flows.
FAi−1 −FAi + rAVi = 0
Writing the molar flows as a function of conversion at the inlet and outlet of the ith
reactor (note that conversion increases while the reactant concentration decreases), we
obtain:

tem has constant volume, one can write the balance as a function of concentration

(17.7)
As mentioned before, the sum of the volumes of tanks (CSTR) in series is smaller than
the volume of a single CSTR (see Figure 17.1). Besides, when the reactor volume is
constant, the average residence time is equal to the space time tCSTR = τCSTR for each
reactor in series, but it is different for a single reactor. The reaction kinetics must be
known and it is valid for any reactor in series or parallel.
The main goal is usually determining the required number of reactors in series or
parallel to achieve the maximum desired conversion or productivity and to minimize
the reactor volume.

466
Chemical reaction engineering
It is possible to obtain analytical solutions for reactors in series when dealing with
irreversible first- and second-order reactions at constant volume, as discussed below.
For other cases, the solutions are complex and require computational methods.
17.1.1
Calculating the number of reactors in series to an
irreversible first-order reaction
Let us consider a series of CSTR reactors of equal volumes. That means the average
residence time and space time are the same in each reactor. Then,
τi = Vi
v0
If the volumetric flow v0 is constant in a system at constant volume, we can claim that
the total space time will be τ = nτi.
The rate for an irreversible first-order reaction will be:
(−rA) = kCA = kCAo(1 −XA)
Then, for reactor i (Equation 17.6), we have the following expression:
Vi
v0
= CA0
(XAi −XAi−1)
(−rA)
= (XAi −XAi−1)
k(1 −XAi)
(17.8)
or on rearranging:
(XAi −XAi−1) = τik(1 −XAi)
Since the reactor volumes are equal and therefore ti = constant, we obtain the following
expression after adding the unity (1) on both sides of the equation:
(1 −XAi−1) = (1 + τik)(1 −XAi)
The initial conversion is zero, i.e., XA0 = 0. Then,
(1 −XA1) =
1
(1 + τik)
(17.9)
Substituting into Equation 17.9, one obtains subsequently:
(1 −XA2) =
1
(1 + τik)2
and
(1 −XAn) =
1
(1 + τik)n
(17.10)

E17.1 Consider a cascade of CSTRs in series. Assuming the conversion at the outlet of
the first reactor is 0.475 and of the last reactor is 0.99, calculate the number of CSTR
reactors in series. Note that the kinetics has not been provided, but one may assume
an irreversible first-order reaction.
Solution
Since the conversion in the first reactor is equal to 0.475, we can determine the term
(1 + τik)−1 = 0.525 by means of Equation 17.9. From the information about final
conversion in the last reactor, 0.99, we can calculate the intermediate conversions at
the outlet of each reactor using Equation 17.10. Keep in mind that the conversion
in the last reactor should not exceed 0.99. Then, it is possible to obtain the number
of CSTR reactors required to achieve this conversion. Six reactors in series of equal
volume are obtained.
17.1.2
Calculating the number of reactors in series for an
irreversible second-order reaction
This solution is more difficult because the rate for an irreversible second-order reaction
is given by:
(−rA) = kC2
A = kC2
A0(1 −XA)2
Substituting into Equation 17.10, we obtain:
Vi
v0
= τi = CA0
(XAi −XAi−1)
(−rA)
= (XAi −XAi−1)
kCA0(1 −XA)2
(17.11)
This expression contains a quadratic term, whose solution has two roots. Let us instead
use the inverse of the above method: start from the desired final conversion in the last
reactor and calculate conversion or volume for the previous reactor. Note that the
conversion in the first reactor should be positive. This method enables one to determine
the volumes of the reactors in series using their inlet and outlet conversions. Therefore,
rearranging Equation 17.11, we obtain:
(1 −XAi−1) = (1 −XAi)[(1 + τikCA0)(1 −XAi)]
(17.12)

468
Chemical reaction engineering
E17.2 Considering n reactors in series and having the outlet conversions of the first
and last reactors as 0.40 and 0.85, respectively, calculate the number of reactors even
without the kinetic constants.
Solution
In the first reactor, we have conversion XA1 = 0.40. Substituting into Equation 17.12
for i = 1:
τikCA0 = 1.1
Considering similar reactor volumes, we have ti = t =constant. Starting from the last
reactor whose conversion XAn = 0.85, we calculate the conversions in the previous
reactors using Equation 17.12. The conversion at the outlet of the first reactor cannot
be lower than 40%. Solving, we get:
XAn−7 = 0.241 < 0.40
Therefore, we need n = 7 reactors in series with the same volume.
For more complex reactions, the solutions may be obtained using numerical
methods.
17.1.3
Graphical solution
The graphical method is only useful for displaying a logical sequence during the
determination of volumes and inlet and outlet conditions for reactors in series under
isothermal conditions.
Both volumes and average residence times may be different. One should know the
reaction rate, which is valid for any case as shown in Figure 17.4.
We start rearranging Equation 17.6 (CSTR):
(−rAi) = −1
τi
(CAi−1 −CAi)
(17.13)
This expression represents a straight line that intersects the rate curve (-rAi), to give
the outlet concentration of the following reactor. The slope is:

−1
τi

Through Figure 17.4, if one knows the initial concentration and space time in the
first reactor then it is possible to calculate directly the concentration at its outlet. This
process may be repeated until the outlet concentration of the last reactor is determined.
The points B, D, and F represent the concentrations at the outlet of reactors in series.
Note that ti may be different resulting in different volumes.
This method may be applied to PFR reactors in series as well as other different
combinations of reactors.

17.2
REACTORS IN PARALLEL
Let us consider PFR or CSTR reactors in parallel as illustrated in Figure 17.2c and d
and detailed in Figure 17.5, for both cases. The initial concentration, the volumetric
flow, and volume may be different for the reactors. However, the main condition is that
the outlet concentration or conversion for both reactors should be the same, which
implies that the average residence time and space time must be the same as well.
Therefore, through molar balance we obtain the same expression of a single
reactor, according to the following equations:

It is possible to obtain analytical solutions for reactors in parallel to irreversible
first- and second-order reactions at constant volume. For other cases, the solutions are
complex and require computational methods.
17.3
PRODUCTION RATE IN REACTORS IN SERIES
By definition, productivity (W) is equal to the production rate at the outlet of the
reactor, i.e., moles of reactant A converted into product over time. Both in CSTR or
PFR, this production rate depends on the reaction kinetics and we take into account the
average residence time in the reactor. For several reactors in series, we have different
average residence times.
Figure 17.6 shows the productivity of CSTR and PFR reactors in series and
separated.
The productivity presents higher values for PFR than for CSTR, but decreases with
increasing conversion (XAi) for both reactors. By employing two CSTR in series, the
productivity increases, and the more reactors in series the most it approaches a PFR.
17.4
YIELD AND SELECTIVITY IN REACTORS IN SERIES
The concept of yield in CSTR and PFR reactors has been studied in Section 16.3 and
comparison showed that the yield in the PFR is always higher than that in the CSTR.
The overall yield in the CSTR is equal to the local yield. On the other hand, the overall
yield in the PFR is integrated along the reactor, according to Equations 16.20 and
16.23. For n reactors in series, the overall yield will be equal to the sum of yields in
each reactor.

For any kinetics, the local yield as a function of conversion can be represented by
two cases (a) and (b) as displayed in Figure 17.7 (Denbigh, 1965).
In case (a), the yield decreases with conversion. The overall yield in the PFR is
the integral (Equation 16.26) represented by the area under the curve (HF) to a final
conversion (XAf ) at point C. On the other hand, the overall yield in the CSTR is
represented by the rectangle (ACFG). By comparison, one observes that the yield in
PFR is higher than that in the CSTR.
With two PFR reactors in series, aiming for the same final conversion (XAf ), one
obtains the yields represented by the area under the curves (HD) and (DF), whose
sum is equal to a single PFR that achieves the conversion XAf . With two CSTR in
series, their respective yields are represented by rectangular areas and the overall
yield will be the sum of area of these two rectangles, leading to a higher yield when

compared to a single CSTR. This, however, is still lower than the yield of two PFR
in series.
In case (b), the yield curve shows a maximum F over the conversion at point B. In
a PFR, the overall yield (area under the curve HFD) to a final conversion (XAf ) at C is
higher than the yield in a CSTR for the same conditions (area of rectangle ACDH’).
With two reactors in series we may have two situations:
1.
Two PFR reactors in series, the first with outlet conversion in the maximum
of the yield curve and the second connected in series (area under HF and FD
curves).
2.
The best combination will be a CSTR followed by a PFR. Therefore, the overall
yield would be represented by the areas of the rectangle ABFG and under the
curve FD. Any other combination will present a lower overall yield.
Example
E17.4 Ester is hydrolyzed with an excess of caustic soda. The ester solution is fed to
the first reactor at a rate of 200 L/min and concentration 0.02 mol/L, while the caustic
soda at 50 L/min and 1 mol/L. The reaction rate constant of this irreversible second-
order reaction is 2 L/(mol min). Three CSTR reactors in series are utilized; the volume
of the first is unknown, the second is 2200 L and the third is 800 L. Calculate the
volume of the first reactor and the conversion at the outlet of each reactor. Assume
final conversion of 95% and use the analytical method.

474
Chemical reaction engineering
Solution
(a) Analytical method:
Since we have a second-order reaction, the rate is:
(−rA) = kCACB = kC2
Ao(1 −XA)(M −XA)
(17.21)
where:
A = ester
B = caustic soda
But caustic soda is very diluted and fed separately. Then, the new concentrations
at the entrance of the first reactor are:
CA0 = 0.02 × 200
250 = 0.016 (mol/L)
CB0 = 1.0 × 50
250 = 0.20 (mol/L)
The concentration of caustic soda (B) is higher than ester and therefore the reactant A
is limiting (considering a reaction stoichiometry 1:1 between ester and caustic soda).
The ratio between the initial concentrations will be:
M = CB0
CA0
= 12.5
In the rate equation, the value of M is much higher than the conversion XA. In this
case, one can neglect the second term and consider a pseudo first-order reaction.
(−rA) = kCACB = kMC2
A0(1 −XA)
(17.22)
Then, substituting into Equation 17.7, we obtain an equation similar to Equation 17.9.
(1 −XAi−1) = (1 + τikMCA0)(1 −XAi)
(17.23)
But,
τikMCA0 = V3
v0
kMCA0 = 800
250 × 2 × 12.5 × 0.016 = 1.28
Thus,
XAi−1 = XA2 = 0.86
For the second reactor, we have its volume and the outlet conversion, then we can
calculate:
τ2kMCA0 = 3.52,
XA1 = 0.486
Since the total flow fed to the first reactor is 250 L/min, we obtain the reactor volume:
τ1kMCA0 = 0.94;
τ1 = 2.35;
V1 = 588 L

E17.5 One desires to process a reversible reaction 2A ↔P + Q at constant volume
in a CSTR reactor or several reactors in series. Pure reactant A is fed under flow of
3.5 m3/h and initial concentration of 48 kmol/m3. The forward reaction rate constant is
equal to 0.75 m3/(kmol h) and the equilibrium constant K = 16. If the final conversion
is desired to be 85% of the equilibrium conversion, calculate the volume of a single
CSTR. If the capacity of the available reactors is only 5% of the calculated volume,
how many CSTR reactors in series would be needed?

volume is constant) will be:
τi = 0.0193 h

E17.8 The reaction A

−→R was carried out in three PFR reactors in series. The reactant
was fed at a flow rate of 100mol/min at 25◦C, followed by heating until 100◦C. Has
a reaction taken place in the first reactor during this heating phase?
Then, the reactor operated adiabatically until a temperature of 650◦C. When
650◦C was reached, the reactor operated isothermally releasing heat. The final
conversion was 85%.

The system comprises three PFR reactors in series, the first is nonisothermal, the
second is adiabatic, and the third is isothermal. What are the inlet and outlet

FiCPi = FA0CP = 1.8 × 104 J/min

The third term:

Q = UA × T = 300.60.1.100 = 1.8.106

Combination of reactors

Substituting the values into Equation 17.35, we calculate the outlet conversion in the
first reactor. In this case,
XA1 = 0
Therefore, no conversion occurred during the heating.
In the second reactor, operated adiabatically, the temperature increases but does
not exceed 650◦C = 923K.
With the energy balance in an adiabatic system, we deduce:

If the maximum temperature is 650◦C = 923 K, we obtain:

Therefore, the outlet conversion in the adiabatic reactor is:

Since the third reactor operates isothermally at 923 K, we need to calculate k (specific

k = 4.106.e−8000/T
Thus,
k = 0.688 min−1
Therefore, with Equation 17.29, we calculate:

consequently, the outlet conversion X′

τ1 = 0.0144 h = 51.8 s
Substituting the above rate expression into Equation 17.40 yields:

Thus,

Then, for the PFR, we have the following Equation (15.17):

(17.45)
Substituting the values XA = 0.90 and XA1 = 0.501, we have:

k = 8.19 × 1015 · e−34,222/(RT) (L mol−1 min−1)
The average residence time in the isothermal reactor is 4 min. The other reactor

From the provided molar flow fed into reactors FA0 = 10 mol/min and the initial con-
centration, we calculate the volumetric flow. Then with space time, we calculate the

and with:
τ = V

V = 1.05 m3

486
Chemical reaction engineering
Since the average residence time in the reactors is equal, the outlet conversions in
both reactors are the same and so, we should determine the initial temperature in the
adiabatic reactor. The volume of the adiabatic reactor is the same.
By the energy balance in an adiabatic reactor, we have:
T = T0 + β · XA
where:
β = −HR · FA0

where:

FiCPi = FACPA + FRCPR + FsCPS = FA0(1 −XA)CPA + FA0XACPR + FA0XACPS
Then,

FiCPi = FA0[(1 −XA)CPA + [CPR + CPS)XA = FA0CPA = 170. × FA0
Therefore,
β = 470
And the inlet temperature in the adiabatic reactor will be:
T0 = 377K = 105◦C
E17.11 The local yield involving multiple reactions has been determined without pre-

where XA is the reactant conversion. With this result, one can calculate the yield of a
reactor or several combined ones and find the best combination.

For a space time of 30min, the maximum concentration of m-xylene is 3 × 10−3 and
mesitylene is 2 × 10−2 mol/L at 700 K and 1 atm. Calculate the local yield in the PFR.

INTRAPARTICLE DIFFUSION LIMITATION—PORES
The presence of pores, for which the observed reaction rate is lower than the kineti-
cally controlled intrinsic one, in the particles or pellets affects the reaction rate due to
diffusion limitations. This intraparticle diffusion effect causes a concentration gradient
within the pores. If diffusion is fast, then the concentration gradient is negligible.
Figure 18.1 shows a particle (pellet) with a pore through which the reactant A
diffuses, reaches the active site, and reacts to form the product R, which follows the
reverse path until it reaches the external film. Therefore, the observed rate should take
into account the reaction and intraparticle diffusion, i.e.:
robs = rintrinsicη
(18.1)
The intrinsic rate is defined by the kinetics on the pore surface or at the surface
sites under the reaction conditions and η is called the effectiveness factor. For now, let
us not consider external mass and heat transfer limitations.

k′ is the specific reaction rate constant of a first-order reaction and its unit is (cm3/cm2 s)
Total specific area Sg (cm2/g) is measured by N2 physisorption.
ρs (g/cm3) is the solid density.
De is the diffusivity coefficient.
The Knudsen diffusivity and molecular diffusion coefficients of the components in
gas phase are different and determined by empirical correlations or in most cases they
are tabulated.
Thiele modulus presents limiting cases:
•
When its value is high, the effective diffusion or diffusion rate is very low with
respect to the reaction rate and consequently diffusion is the limiting step.
•
The opposite (low Thiele modulus) represents a low reaction rate with respect to
the diffusion rate and therefore the surface chemical reaction is the limiting step.

or reaction limited. If the rate of diffusion through the particle is very low (presence
of strong mass transfer limitation), the reaction effectively takes place at the external
surface of the particle, i.e., r →R. On the other hand, when the rate of diffusion
through the particle is high, a concentration profile exists within particulate pores.

EFFECTIVENESS FACTOR
The effectiveness factor is a parameter that determines how much the intrinsic rate
(kinetic control) is affected by diffusion limitations. Therefore, this factor measures
the deviation from the real kinetics in the presence of diffusion phenomena. According

η =

It is observed that when Thiele modulus

not diffusion limited. On the other hand, the effectiveness factor varies linearly with
Thiele modulus for

This expression is valid for generic-order reactions with large diffusion effects and
catalyzed by spherical particles. It is observed that the effectiveness factor in isothermal
conditions does not exceed the unit.
On the other hand, the effectiveness factor varies significantly with temperature.
Therefore, for nonisothermal conditions, especially in the exothermic reactions, it will
vary since the temperature varies within the pores or particles due to the tempera-
ture gradient caused by the chemical reaction. It is then necessary to construct an

energy balance that takes the specific geometry of the catalyst particle into account
(sphere, cylinder). It is important to remember that the reaction rate constant depends
on temperature. The solution for the energy balance leads to an energy parameter
defined as:
β = CAs(−HR)De
ktTs
= Tm
Ts
(18.30)
where:
(−HR) = reaction heat (kcal/mol)
kt = thermal conductivity Ts = temperature at the surface of pore or particle
Tm = maximum difference of temperature between the external surface and pore.
The β energy parameter is, by convention, positive if the reaction is exothermic,
and negative if endothermic.
For these conditions, we obtain:
Tm −T∞
T∞
= (−HR)De
keT∞
(C∞−Cm)
(18.31)
where Cm corresponds to the concentration at the maximum temperature.
When Thiele modulus is high, Cm is effectively zero and the maximum temperature
difference between particle center and its external surface is equal to:
Tm −T∞= (−HR)De
ke
(C∞)
(18.32)
The effectiveness factor for nonisothermal reactions as a function of Thiele mod-
ulus can be generically represented by Figure 18.4. Isothermal systems have β = 0.
Considering an exothermic reaction with (−HR) = 20 kcal/mol; thermal conduc-
tivity kt = 2.0 × 10−3 cal/(◦C cm s), De = 0.1 cm2/s and external concentration C∞=
1.0 × 10−4 mol/cm3, one obtains a difference of temperature of 100◦C.
Indeed, the experimental values may be lower, but calculations indicate that if we
do not take into account the temperature gradient, errors can be significant. Figure
4.18 shows the behavior of effectiveness factor when there is temperature gradient in
the particles.
In exothermic reactions, when β > 0, the effectiveness factor exceeds unity. This
happens because the increase in the reaction rate caused by the increase of temperature
within the particle, is higher than the decrease in concentration caused by the concen-
tration gradient within the pores. Furthermore, for low Thiele modulus values, one
obtains two or more corresponding effectiveness factor values, indicating the existence
of at least three conditions where the generated heat inside the particle is equal to the
removed heat; one condition is metastable and the other two conditions indicate that
the rate is limited by chemical reaction at low temperatures and by diffusion effects
within the pores at high temperatures, corresponding to high values of β.

EFFECTS OF INTRAPARTICLE DIFFUSION ON THE
EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS
In the presence of intraparticle diffusion effects, the observed rate differs from the
surface intrinsic rate which is controlled only by the reaction kinetics. Therefore, the
rate must be corrected by the effectiveness factor η.
Under strong diffusion effects, the effectiveness factor is inversely proportional
to Thiele modulus. When the reaction has a generic n-order, one should take care in
interpreting the experimental results, since, according to Equation 18.29, the reaction
order is not the same as the intrinsic rate. The observed rate is as follows:
r′
obs = r′
int · η
Substituting the effectiveness factor as a function of Thiele modulus, the factor is
inversely proportional to Thiele modulus in the presence of strong diffusion effects.

Therefore, we have a measured reaction order n′ (apparent order) which is obtained
by equating Equations 18.34 and 18.35:
n′ = n + 1
2
(18.36)
Consequently, a zero-order reaction will have an apparent order equals to ½, a
first-order reaction will present the same apparent order and a second-order reaction,
an apparent order of 3/2. Therefore, the order of reaction is apparent.
The reaction rate constant and activation energy are also apparent in the presence
of intraparticle diffusion effects. Through Arrhenius equation, we have an apparent
activation energy measured, i.e.:
k′

there are strong diffusion limitations.
Example
E18.1 The reaction (CH3)2C=CH2 + H2O →(CH3)3COH with excess of water is
done in a fixed-bed reactor, using a spherical catalyst with radius 0.213 cm and den-
sity of 2 g/cm3. The reaction is carried out at 100◦C and 1 atm, it is reversible and
the final conversion is 80% of equilibrium conversion. The equilibrium constant at
100◦C corresponds to 16.6. The reaction takes place isothermally, the reaction rate is
1.1 × 10−5 mol/(s gcat) and external concentration of the limiting reactant is equal to
1.65 × 10−5 mol/cm3. The mean effective diffusivity is 2 × 10−2 cm2/s. Determine the
effectiveness factor.

One assumes a reversible first-order forward and reverse reaction, since the solution

EXTERNAL MASS TRANSFER AND INTRAPARTICLE
DIFFUSION LIMITATIONS
In a catalytic reactor, the fluid flows through the catalyst particles and may face a
resistance caused by the concentration gradient between the bulk fluid and the external
particle surface. This resistance (interparticle or external mass transfer limitation) must
be added to intraparticle diffusion limitation.
The overall rate should consider these phenomena along with the chemical reac-
tion. Figure 18.5 shows the concentration profiles resulting from different phenomena
in a gas–solid system or liquid–solid containing porous particles.
The external concentration CA0 is known (it is the bulk concentration), but a
concentration gradient ranging from CA to CAs may exist within the thin film around
the particle, CAs being concentration at the external surface of the particle or at the

gradient (curve I, see Figure 18.5). Therefore, the mass transfer rate in this region is:

(18.49)
where
R′′
A = mass transfer rate (mol/g/s)
km is the mass transfer constant and am is the gas/solid interface area.
Curve II shows a lower concentration gradient outside the particle, compared to
curve I, but followed by a concentration gradient inside the pore due to the intraparticle
diffusion limitation. On the other hand, curve III does not have influence of external
limitations, representing the reaction rate in the presence of pore-diffusion resistance
as shown in the following equation:
r′′ = k′S · f (CAs, T) · η(mol/g/s)
(18.50)
where:
r′′ = rate by mass of solid (mol/g/s)
η = effectiveness factor
k′′ = rate constant by surface area.
The effectiveness factor depends on the Thiele modulus defined by Equation 18.13.

At steady state, the mass transfer rate and reaction rate in the presence of diffusion

(18.53)
As a function of the limiting reactant conversion:
kmam(XAs −XA) = k′SgCA0(1 −XAs) × η

The reaction rate constant is temperature dependent. For nonisothermal systems,
one should take into account the energy balance. Moreover, catalyst properties such
as the specific surface area and the pore volume must be known. In this system, a
spherical particle has been considered.

Chemical reaction engineering
It is very important to know the mass transfer constant (km) and the gas/solid
interface area (am). This information can be obtained from the fluid properties and
characteristic numbers for flow such as Schmidt and Sherwood numbers. It is chal-
lenging to determine the interface area, but usually one tries to obtain kmam together
and not separately.
E18.3 An irreversible reaction is done in a PFR reactor containing catalyst with spher-
ical particles of 3 mm diameter. Pure reactant A is fed under flow of 1000 L/s, pressure
of 1 atm, and constant temperature of 300◦C. The conversion at the outlet of the
reactor is supposed to be 80%. Calculate the catalyst mass that must be placed in the
reactor. Additional data are provided as follows (Fogler, 2000):
k′ = 0.07 (cm3/cm2/s)

Catalyst deactivation
Catalyst deactivation occurs over time during a catalytic process and it is a phenomenon
that invariably takes place in most industrial processes. Catalyst deactivation may
occur via four main phenomena: coke deposition which leads to the blocking of pores
and active sites, poisoning via metals (S, As), sintering, and the loss of catalytic active
phase.
Supported metal catalysts are commonly used in industrial processes. Examples
include nickel at high concentration and low dispersion and palladium at a low metal
concentration and high dispersion. Both catalysts enable high conversion and selectiv-
ity in reforming reactions, gasoline pyrolysis, and hydrogenation processes. However,
these catalysts are prone to deactivation due to coke formation and presence of gums
in the load. Coke is deposited preferentially on the metal sites during hydrogenation
reactions while gum is deposited on both metal sites and support resulting in rapid
catalyst. Thus, it is important to investigate catalyst deactivation on an industrial
scale concerning the extent of deactivation, as well as explore possible strategies for
regeneration.
To do so, one scales down the process to a laboratory scale. This entails using
the same space velocity, pressure, and temperature but a scaled down catalyst mass.
Furthermore, to evaluate the catalysts under kinetic control regime one determines
the appropriate conditions to minimize heat and mass transfer effects. Comparative
evaluations can then be made between the results obtained in laboratory and industry.
Stability is a key criterion when determining the most appropriate catalyst for
industrial use. Among the deactivation phenomena, coke deposition and poisoning
may be reversible but sintering is usually irreversible.
Sintering is a thermodynamically favorable process which decreases the catalyst
surface area. Although the catalyst solid nature and the environment to which the
catalyst is exposed influence the process, the sintering phenomenon is basically domi-
nated by temperature. The minimum sintering temperature can be estimated from the
melting temperature of the solid (Tmelting) expressed in Kelvin:
αν = 0.3Tmelting
(19.1)
The melting temperature of nickel is 1726 K. Therefore, according to Equation 19.1,
nickel sintering may be carried out above 517 K.
Coke is carbonaceous species deficient in H2 which may deposit on the catalyst
surface. Carbon often chemisorbs reversibly. Thus, the catalyst can be regenerated

512
Chemical reaction engineering
by removing the carbon by means of some oxidant such as O2, H2O, or even CO2.
However, the high temperatures necessary for the carbon oxidation can lead to the
metal sintering in some cases, which could decrease catalytic activity for further reuse.

Figure 19.2 displays an interesting result for the ethanol conversion versus time
in catalytic tests at different temperatures on supported nickel catalysts, i.e., samples
tested isothermally over time at 723, 773, 873, and 973 K.
According to Figure 19.2, the initial activity of the catalyst increases with tem-
perature and for the samples tested at 773 and 873 K the deactivation is very high.
Deposited carbon was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), i.e., by oxi-
dation following the mass loss. Figure 19.3 displays the total amount of mass loss
attributed to carbon, obtained by TGA, for the different samples tested in the ethanol
conversion at 723, 773, 873, and 973 K. TGA analysis revealed that the amount of
carbon deposited on the samples ranged from 20 to 45 wt%, suggesting pore clogging
and active sites covered by carbon, causing the constant deactivation of the catalysts.
Figure 19.4 displays a picture obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
for a nickel catalyst deactivated. A large amount of carbon filaments and agglomerates
of coke can be easily identified on the catalyst surface. These filaments do not cause
a direct deactivation since they consist of α-type carbon. They do, however, lead to
reactor clogging.

KINETICS OF DEACTIVATION
The observed rate varies with time and the catalyst activity decreases with all the
variables of the system constant. The activity a is defined as the ratio between the
observed reaction rate and the initial rate (when the catalyst is virgin), i.e.:
a =

(19.2)
where:
a represents activity over the course of reaction

It is assumed that the first-order kinetics, however, considering that the catalyst parti-
cles are porous, there may be diffusion effects. This initial rate or reaction rate of the
virgin catalyst can be represented by:

−r′′

= k′′ · a · Sg · CA
(19.3)
where η is the effectiveness factor which takes into account the diffusion effects. The
reaction rate constant k′ represents the specific reaction rate, depends on the temper-
ature and usually is expressed by cubic centimeters per square centimeters per second
(defined per unit surface area). The reactant concentration in the gas phase varies across
the length in the continuous reactor and with time in the batch reactor. Therefore, the
observed rate will be:

−r′′
A

obs = k′ · a · Sg · CA · η
(19.4)
The reaction rate is given by mass of catalyst, and in this case, the specific surface area
of the particles Sg must be known.

Catalyst deactivation
515
Figure 19.4 Picture of nickel catalyst performed in test at 723 K.
The deactivation rate varies with time and can have a generic order:
rd = −da
dt = kd · an
(19.5)
Generally, it is a first-order reaction rate but it can also be of fractional order, depending
on the deactivation mechanism and whether or not it satisfies power–law kinetics. We
assume the simplest case, i.e., first order:
rd = −da
dt = kd · a
(19.6)
where kd is the deactivation constant that satisfies the Arrhenius equation.
kd = kd(T0)e−(Ed/(RT))
(19.7)
and k0 is the pre-exponential factor.
Integrating Equation 19.6, one obtains the variation of activity with time at a
constant temperature, i.e.:
a = e−kdt

This rate depends on particle size (pellet) and in this case spherical particles. If there is

if diffusion effects take place this factor decreases significantly in a manner that is
dependent on the Thiele modulus. The effectiveness factor varies according to Equation

The observed rate as a function of conversion is given by Equation 19.4, which
also depends on the effectiveness factor and activity:
(−r′′
A)obs = k′ · a · Sg · CA0(1 −XA) · η
Substituting this expression into Equation 14.38 and using Equation 18.24, we obtain
the following expression for a PFR reactor with diffusion effects:

In these cases, one can monitor conversion versus time and determine the deactiva-
tion rate as well as the deactivation rate constant. Figure 19.2 shows an example of
conversion varying with reaction time in the ethanol reforming reaction.
Example
E19.1 An irreversible reaction takes place in a CSTR containing spherical particles
catalyst of 24 mm diameter. Pure reactant A is introduced at pressure of 1 atm and
constant temperature of 300◦C with a space time of 4000 (g × s/m3). Conversion was
measured with time as shown in the table (Fogler, 2000). Calculate the deactivation
rate with and without diffusion, knowing the additional data:
De = 2 × 10−8 m2/s; Sg = 30 m2/kg; ρs = 1500 g/m3
Solution
Let us first consider the case in the absence of diffusion effects:

Then, we calculate the value of k′ using Sg = 30 m2/g and τ = 4000 (g s/m3):

FORCED DEACTIVATION
Catalyst deactivation may be simulated by carrying out forced deactivation experi-
ments at high temperatures. Under some conditions, there is a drastic loss of activity.
Next, we try to determine the regeneration conditions.
Forced deactivation experiments may be performed in two ways:
1.
Inducing the sintering of the catalytic material at high temperatures in order to
verify the extent of deactivation during a short period of time.

Using a high concentration of the main component in the feed in order to increase
cracking and coke formation.
In these experiments, catalytic conversion is monitored over reaction time. Tem-
perature is gradually increased but later the initial condition is taken up. The catalytic
material may then be investigated by TGA to quantify the coke formed.
Example
E19.2 Let us take as an example the hydrogenation of pyrolysis gasoline which contains
as main products styrene, isoprene, dicyclopentadiene, and gums in the load. Catalytic
experiments were performed in a steel reactor with ascendant flow and catalyst bed
volume of 27 cm3. The operating parameters were set according to the plant and the
space velocity is 4.5 h−1. Several α-alumina-supported nickel and palladium catalysts
were tested. After proceeding to pretreatment and reduction used in the industry, tests
were performed at four temperatures, 60◦C, 80◦C, 100◦C, and 120◦C and then the
initial condition (60◦C) was taken up. After this step, the temperature was increased
to 350◦C for 3 h with N2 flow with real and synthetic load, forcing the catalysts
deactivation. The feed flow was reduced to half that used in the catalytic test, increasing
the residence time in the reactor and forcing catalyst deactivation. Next, the deactivated

catalysts were tested at 60◦C and 120◦C under the same initial operating conditions of
the virgin catalyst. Finally, regeneration tests were performed to verify the regeneration
degree or permanent deactivation.
Solution
Table 19.1 shows results of styrene conversion obtained from experiments in which
the catalysts were subjected to forced deactivation at 120◦C and regeneration at 60◦C,
100◦C, and 120◦C. For comparison, the results obtained in step 1 with synthetic load
are shown as well.
One can observe a considerable deactivation with respect to step 1 using syn-
thetic load, especially the catalyst C which practically had not deactivated previously
(around 4%) after hard treatment to 350◦C. The other catalysts A and B, though both
have presented an increased deactivation degree from 65% to 94% and from 54%
to 88%, respectively, one observes recovery in the activity of these catalysts after the
regeneration step.
The results of activity (styrene conversion) at 120◦C in the hydrogenation of
pyrolysis gasoline are shown in Figure 19.8 for selected samples.
For all of the catalysts, the real load (gasoline) led to a stronger deactivation than
employing the synthetic load.
The regeneration step was not enough to recover the catalytic activity of the catalyst
C. For catalysts A and B, despite the high deactivation, there was a reasonable recovery
of the initial activity, reaching 90% of conversion after regeneration.

Example
E19.3 Based on the experimental results above, data from previous example and assum-
ing forced deactivation in the absence of mass transfer limitations, we have calculated
the conversion over reaction time. From Equation 19.12 and data in Table 19.2, we
have also calculated the deactivation rate constants assuming CSTR-type behavior.
XA
1−XA
= 2.99 e−(kdt)
The estimated reaction time was t = 5 h. Therefore, we have calculated the constant
kd using the styrene conversion given in Table 19.2:
XA = 0.35 →→kd(60◦C) = 0.35
After deactivation at 350◦C and new activity test at 120◦C for 5 h:
XA = 0.05 →kd(120◦C) = 0.77
Substituting these values into Equation 19.11 and using the same conversion data of
the previous problem, we vary XA with reaction time and obtain Figure 19.9.
The results reveal that after 6 h, natural deactivation led to a reactant conversion
of 0.38. For this same time frame, forced deactivation led to a significantly lower
conversion of approximately 0.02. Extrapolating the curve of natural deactivating
(non-forced), the time required for complete deactivation would be 11.5 h.

CATALYST REGENERATION
The example in the earlier section shows a catalyst may be sufficiently regenerated
after deactivation. However, this regeneration depends on the type of deactivation.
For example, if sintering is the cause of deactivation, it may be difficult to regenerate
catalytic material as a result of particle agglomeration and the formation of aluminates.
If the deactivation is due to the poisoning of active sites caused by deposition of
compounds coming in the feed, its removal will depend on the type of poisoning. Deac-
tivation due to gums may be reversible depending on the type of regeneration method.
Sulfur compounds or metals, however, are irreversibly adsorbed. Regeneration is pos-
sible when deactivation is caused by cracking and coke deposition on particles or inside
pores. Carbon often chemisorbs reversibly. Thus, the catalyst can be regenerated by
removing the carbon by means of some oxidant such as O2, H2O, or CO2. However, in
some cases, high temperatures for the carbon oxidation can lead to the metal sintering.
Oxidation or combustion in the presence of steam allows removing coke.
The catalyst regeneration process is not simple and involves many parameters that
are directly related to deactivation. It is essential to understand the deactivation mech-
anisms in order to choose the appropriate regeneration conditions. Textural properties
as surface area and pore volume are affected by the regeneration procedures as well
as metal surface phases or acidic properties of the support. Therefore, a regeneration
process will depend on the history of the catalytic process, the feed, the type of process,
and its variables such as pressure and temperature, which are the main deactivation

525
factors. The regeneration makes sense when the deactivation can be reversed or phases
can be recovered. Each situation must be evaluated separately.
The parameters that influence the regeneration process comprise heating rate in
the coke combustion process, regeneration time, and gas flowing during regeneration.
The combustion rate is very critical and the ignition temperature causes uncontrollable
increase in temperature, since combustion reaction is highly exothermic. Heat dissipa-
tion is an alternative to avoid sudden heating due to ignition, which is significant when
the atomic ratio H/C is high. Finally, the time for coke removal is an important param-
eter and several regeneration cycles can be carried out not affecting the process at all.
Carbon is burnt in the process and the following reactions take place:
C + O2 →CO2
H0
298K = −406.4 kJ/mol
2C + O2 →2CO
H0
298K = −246.3 kJ/mol

H0
298K = −83.8 kJ/mol
C + H2O →CO + H2
H0
298K = 118.5 kJ/mol
These reactions are exothermic and thermodynamically favorable, except the last.
Most regeneration techniques are based on coke combustion increasing the
temperature.
The regeneration can be evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),
temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), and catalytic tests.
19.4.1
Differential scanning calorimetry
A first evaluation of the catalytic performance is usually carried out by using DSC.
Samples are heated at a rate of 10 K/min under synthetic air flow (50 mL/min).
Enthalpy of reaction (H) is calculated using the following correlation:
H = K · A
m [cal/g]
where:
K = dimensionless constant (1.06)
m = mass of sample (mg)
A = quantity of heat (mcal) corresponding to the area under DSC curve ((mcal/s) s).
By the Kissinger method (Boudart), one can determine the activation energy (E)
via DSC curves obtained under three different heating rates (β) at least. Once the rates
(β) are known, as well as temperatures corresponding to the maximum on each peak
(TC), it is possible to establish the following linear relationship:

The temperature corresponding to the maximum in the DSC peak is a parameter
widely used in the literature for the evaluation of the catalytic performance. This
parameter is often known as combustion temperature and represented by TC.
19.4.2 Temperature programmed oxidation
The compounds from carbon oxidation are quantified by a mass spectrometer coupled
to the catalytic test unit. The sample is flowed by 5% O2/He under v0 flow and heating
rate of 10 K/min. The combustion is monitored by mass spectrometer as exemplified
in Figure 19.11.

KINETIC STUDY OF REGENERATION
The most widely used model is a gas–solid reaction, assuming a carbon spherical
particle. The most common cases are the regeneration and diesel soot combustion. In
this model, carbon combustion is admitted and a cinder layer remains. Therefore, there
is gas diffusion through the cinder layer and reaction on the carbon particle surface,
which moves inward until total consumption. CO2 is formed during combustion and
must diffuse through the cinder in the opposite direction, as shown in Figure 19.12.
Oxygen (O2) diffuses through the cinder layer, where no reaction takes place,
reaches the interface, oxidizes carbon and then CO2 just formed diffuses through the
opposite direction crossing the cinder layer. Considering a carbon particle radius R0
and interface radius rc, we obtain for each mol of O2 (reactant A) the diffusion rate:

with 50 tubes, each with “½’’ in diameter and 1.0 m of height. 200 kg/h of reactant A
(MW = 80 g/gmol) with 30% inert is introduced at a pressure of 50 bar at 500◦C. The
output conversion is 80%. Calculate the average residence time.

Substituting that rate in PFR equation, we get:

SE.3 The reaction A + B
k
−→R is carried out in the liquid-phase reactor. The compo-
nents A and B are introduced separately at 4 mol/L and 5 L/min, respectively, and they
are mixed together at the inlet to the reactor. This mixture goes into the reactor at
27◦C. There are two types of reactors to choose from:
1
A CSTR with 200 L, which can operate at 77◦C or 0◦C.
2
A PFR with 800 L, which can only operate at 27◦C.
It is known that the reaction is elementary and k = 0.07 L/(mol min) at 27◦C and
the activation energy is equal to 20 kcal/mol.
What reactor would you recommend and under what conditions? Justify.
If the reaction was performed in a batch reactor with 200 L and the final conversion
was equal to the PFR, calculate the time at 77◦C and 0◦C, knowing that the initial
concentrations are equal to 1 mol/L.
Solution
A:5L/min, 4 (mol/L)
10 L/min, 2 mol/L
B:5 L/min, 4 (mol/L)
Since the initial concentrations are equal at the inlet, we have a second-order

At 77◦C:

SE.13 Propylene reacts with water to produce ethylene glycol. A reactant with excess
water is introduced into a PFR at 27◦C and at a rate of 5 L/min with concentration
of 1 mol/L. The reaction rate constant is k = 1.69 × 105 exp (−41, 800/RT)(min−1), E
(J/mol). The reactor is adiabatic, but the maximum temperature cannot exceed a value
of 400 K, then it operates isothermally until the final conversion of 90%. Is it possible
to set the temperature at 300◦C? Explain your answer. What would the temperature be

It is observed that the pressure of compound A of experiments 1 and 2 increases
five times, but the rate is virtually constant. The same is true for the experiments 1
and 3, where the pressure increases 10 times and the rate is constant. This means that
the rate is not directly proportional to the concentration of A, but it falls due to the
terms of adsorption–desorption in the denominator, which are significant. Therefore,
it is adsorbed.
Now let us look at the products. Observing the table, set up the partial pressures
of A (cyclohexanol) and R(cyclohexane).

It is noted that for fixed pressures of A and R, from the experiments 6 and 7, the
pressure of S varies two times and its rate is virtually constant. The same result occurs
with the experiments 7 and 10; the pressure of S decreases by about three times and
the rate is in the same order of magnitude. This suggests that the S component (water),
which should be in the denominator, does not influence significantly on the rate. Thus,
it is not adsorbed.

It is observed from experiments 4 and 5 that an increase of two times the pressure
of cyclohexene (R) does not significantly affect the denominator, indicating that it is
not adsorbed, and you can consider it as negligible.

Solution
It is assumed that all components are adsorbed and the reaction is first order,
irreversible.
Thus,
r =

1 + KApA + KRpR + KSpS
For low conversions and initial rate r0, one can assume that the partial pressures
of R and S are small and insignificant. Therefore,
r0 =

Therefore, the adsorption–desorption equilibrium constant will be
KR(benzene) = kads
kdes

The result shows that the equilibrium constant KR(benzene) ≪KA can be neglected.
SE.16 Considering the same reaction to the previous question, but it is performed in
a PFR, with 40 g of catalyst and operating at 550 ◦C and 10 atm. In this reaction
is introduced 5 mol/min of reactant with 20% inert. The catalyst is spherical and
has a radius of 1 cm, but it is porous and has an area of the 50 m2/g. The effective
diffusion coefficient is 0.23 cm2/s. The density of the catalyst is 2.3 g/cm3. Determine
the effectiveness factor and apparent activation energy. Check the rate ratio with and
without diffusion.
Solution
The rate equation was determined in the previous problem, with
r0 =

As KA, we have KApA > 1. One can simplify the rate constant as
r0 =

SE.19 The dehydrogenation of cyclohexane is conducted in a PFR, according to
reaction:

3H2
Cyclohexane and hydrogen are introduced at 8.0 and 2.0 mol/s, respectively. The
reaction is first order and irreversible at 435◦C and 1.5 atm. What would be the reactor

Data:
k1 = 10−5h−1
k2 = 10−7h−1
k3 = 5 × 10−6h−1 and k4 = 10−7h−1
Solution
The reaction rates that correspond to each step are:
rM = k4[D]
(20.70)
rD = k1[H] −k2[D][H] + 2k2[D][H] −k3[D] −k4[D] = 0
(20.71)
or
rD = k1[H] + k2[D][H] −(k3 + k4)[D] = 0
(20.72)
Neglecting the first term, the initial rate, because it is small if compared to others,
yields:
[H] = k3 + k4
k2
(20.73)
Furthermore:
rH = k3[D] −k2[D][H] = 0
(20.74)
Adding Equations 20.70 and 20.72, we get:
[D] = k1

(20.75)
Therefore, substituting Equations 20.73 and 20.75 into Equation 20.70:

(20.76)

Substituting the values of the rate constants, one obtains:
rM = 5.10 × 10−4 1/h
The rate expression of the [H] is:
−rH = k1[H] + k2[D][H] −k3[D]
(20.77)
Substituting Equation 20.75 into Equation 20.77 and rearranging it, we obtain:
−rH = k1

(k2 −k3 + k4)[H]
Substituting the values obtained previously, the rate of people getting sick is:

Solution
The reaction is irreversible and second order. However, during heating, the initial
concentrations were:

Substituting this value in equation 20.108 we get:

Finally, substituting the value of XAe for finding the concentrations of reactants,
we get:

CA0 = 2 (mol/g) × 90 (g/mol) = 180 g/dm3

The density of the pellet (ρp) can be calculated from the equation of the average

in the liquid and then both reactants diffuse or move toward the surface of the catalyst
for the reaction to occur. In this way, the resistances of transfer through the liquid/gas
interface and the surface of the solid are present in the rate equation. One of the main
advantages of this type of reactor is the control of temperature and heat recovery.
Moreover, they can operate continuously or in batch.
Concentration of A:
CA = P
H = 11.77 mol/m3
Therefore, by comparing the concentrations of A and B, there is an excess of B
(CB = 400 mol/m3).

If we use the catalyst A in the reactor with a concentration of 50 g/dm3, there is
an increased rate. Thus, if we use the catalyst B, minimum amount of catalyst can be
used such that the diffusional resistance is 50% of the total resistance?
Solution
It is considered first-order reaction.
Reaction rate equation: considering the steady state, we get:
˙RA (bubble) = ˙RA (surface) = ˙RA (solid) =
where:
˙RA (bubble): transfer rate from the bubble
˙RA (surface): transfer rate of catalyst
˙RA (solid): reaction rate in the catalyst

The values shown for rb should be equal for both particles as they depend on the
bubble but not the catalyst, the difference between the values found can be attributed
to experimental errors.
From the curves, one can conclude that the particle diameter A is larger than that
of the particle B.
We also know that for small diameters of the particles, the efficiency is equal to
1. While for larger particle sizes, the efficiency is inversely proportional to the Thiele
modulus:
Thus, we conclude that the particle A generates the lowest effectiveness.
In fact, if we consider the transport resistance to surface (rc) negligible:
Particle A:

We have: rT −rb = 6.6 min
Thus, we see that the diffusion resistance is the limiting factor. Therefore, the
measure that increases the dispersion of gas will not be effective.
Comparing with the particle B:
1
m = 0.02dm3

⇒
S
(−ri) = rt = 2
and rb = 1.0 min
Diffusion resistance:rT −rb = 1.0 min

For a diffusional resistance with 50% of total resistance, we will have:
S

S

⇒m = 50g/dm3
Then, the minimum load is 50 g/dm3 (larger loads generate s/—rL and therefore
higher percentages).

Chapter 21
Multiphase reacting systems
The most catalytic or noncatalytic processes involving reactions in multiphase sys-
tems. Such processes include heat and mass transfer and other diffusion phenomena.
The applications of these processes are diverse and its reactors have their own char-
acteristics, which depends on the type of process. For example, the hydrogenation of
vegetable oils is conducted in a liquid phase slurry bed reactor, where the catalyst is in
suspension, the flow of gaseous hydrogen keeps the particles in suspension. This type
of reaction occurs in the gas–liquid–solid interface.
As a second example, we have the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. This process
allows producing liquid hydrocarbons of high molecular mass with long carbon-
chain molecules (such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricant) from synthesis gas
(CO+H2). This process takes place in slurry bed reactors, where the reactant gases
flow through a liquid mixture inert.
The types of reactors commonly used in multiphase processes are represented in
Figure 21.1.

For fluidized bed and slurry bed, the reactant gases keep small particles in suspen-
sion and the reaction occurs in the gas–solid interface. In this set of reactors, the fluid
cracking catalyst (FCC) is the most known. While the three-phase reactor is similar
to the fixed bed, where gas and liquid act in concurrent or countercurrent flow, the
chemical reaction occurs in the gas–liquid–solid interface. For example, the catalytic
hydrotreating of heavy oils, which aims to the elimination of nitrogenous compounds,
sulfur compounds, and oxygenates from petroleum. Among others, one can highlight
the biological applications.
The multiphase reactions are characterized from the following mechanisms:
Gas absorption in the liquid phase as bubbles
Gas diffusion in the liquid phase
Diffusion from liquid to solid surface
Diffusion in porous systems
Reactions at the liquid–solid or gas–solid interface.
These steps are described in Figure 21.2.

In general, for low concentrations, then Henry’s law applies.

Rate of mass transfer from a gas phase to liquid phase:
RA = kbab (Ci −Cb)
(21.2)
where:
Ci = concentration of A in the gas–liquid interface (mol/cm3)
Cb = concentration of A in the gas phase or global concentration
kbab = represents the product of the mass transfer constant in the gas phase (global)
and gas–liquid interface area (cm3/s).

The rate of mass transfer of gas (A) in the liquid to the solid surface:
˙RA = klalm(Cb −Cs)
(21.3)
where:
Cs = concentration of A in the solid surface
Cb = concentration of A in the gas–liquid interface
kl = mass transfer coefficient (cm/s)
al = external surface area of the particle at the liquid–solid interface (cm2/g)
m = mass of solid particles (g).

Diffusion/reaction in porous catalysts:
The reaction rate on the surface of the pores, by considering the diffusion and
represented by the effectiveness factor is
(−r′

(21.4)
where:
η = effectiveness factor
(−r′
As) = intrinsic rate on the surface.
The rate per unit volume is:

(21.5)
Considering an irreversible first-order reaction on the pores’ surface, one obtain:

(21.6)
Where

Equation 21.7 includes the mass transfer, pore diffusion, and chemical reaction.
Figure 21.3 allows observing the effect of each step, represented by Equation 21.7. As
measure parameters, one has the inverse of the mass on the abscissa and the inverse of
the global rate on the ordinate.
It is observed that the resistance to mass transfer in the gas–liquid interface is
independent of the mass of the solid (case a). On the other hand, both the mass
transfer in the liquid phase to the interface as diffusion and the reaction in the pores
depend on the mass of the solid (case b) and particle size. The inverse of the rate ˙RA
represents the resistance to flow mass in the reaction during the passage of reactant
gas from the gas phase to the solid surface.
However, the interface area liquid/solid, al, and the effectiveness factor are depen-
dent on the particle diameter. From Figure 21.3, it can be seen that the overall resistance
varies linearly with the inverse of the solid mass. This demonstrates the dependence
on particle diameter. Thus, the resistance to the rate decreases with the reduction of
particle diameter (cases c and b).

The case d shows that the resistance to mass transfer in the bubble is almost zero,
this indicates that the size of gas bubbles is very small. On the other hand, the larger
the bubble diameter greater the resistance to mass transfer (case e).

If the particle diameter is small, the effectiveness factor is practically independent
of Thiele modulus, i.e., η = 1, as we have seen earlier. In this case, the pore diffusion
does not affect the rate and the resistance is due to the chemical reaction surface, which
is the limiting step of the process. It is known that the product klal depends on the
particle diameter and diffusion, which are usually represented by Sherwood number.
Thus,
Sh = kldp
D
This means that if the particle diameter is small, the resistance to mass transfer in
liquid phase becomes negligible. On the other hand, when analyzing the same expres-
sions for particle diameters is larger, we see that the effectiveness factor decreases and
the Sherwood number increases. Knowing that the effectiveness factor is inversely pro-
portional to the Thiele modulus and Sherwood number is directly proportional to the
diameter of the particle, we obtain such combined effects. Therefore:

a limiting step of the process. With increasing particle diameter, the diffusion becomes
limiting. Thus, the mass transfer controls the system.
Example
E21.1 Hydrogenation of particular oil is performed in a liquid phase catalytic reactor
(plug flow reactor (PFR)) containing catalytic particles (pellets—spherical diameters) of
1 cm. The external concentration is 1 kmol/L and on the particle surface is 0.1 kmol/L
at a superficial velocity of 0.1 m/s. Verify if there are mass effects. There will be a
change if the particle diameter is equal to 0.5 cm? Neglect the effects in diffusive pores
(Fogler, 2000). Additional data:

and external diffusion. The ratio between the resistance to gas absorption and the
resistance to diffusion into the particles and subsequent reaction for mass m will be:

= Linear coeficient
Angular coeficient
(21.12)
As the adsorption in the gas phase is independent of particle size, the intersection
remains constant. With decreasing particle size, both the effectiveness factor and the
coefficient of mass transfer increase. Consequently, the combined resistance to mass
transfer and diffusion decrease (rep). This is shown in Figure 21.5 for both cases.
The angular coefficient for the experiments (C1 and C2) is 330 and the linear
coefficient is equal to 0.9. Whereas for the second set of experiments (C3, C4, and C5),
the slope is equal to 50 and the linear coefficient is 1.
Thus,
rep = rl + rr = 330 for C1 and C2
and,
rep = 50 for C3, C4, and C5
As angular coefficient for the set C1 and C2 is six times larger than C3, C4, and
C5, further the angular coefficient inversely proportional to the effectiveness factor, it
is concluded that the set, C1 and C2, has a lower effectiveness factor.

Heterogeneous reactors
Packed bed reactors can be presented in different ways, such as fixed bed, fluid bed, and
slurry phase. The reaction is characterized as the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst,
which may be fixed or not. The most processes in the petrochemical industry are
heterogeneous. There are several examples in petrochemical industry, such as methane
reforming; synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen, synthesis of methanol
from syngas, and catalytic cracking to produce gasoline.
To evaluate reaction rate of gas–solid systems, one must know the solid surface
properties. Moreover, the rate constant is the most important parameter for a correct
decision about what type of system will be adopted on the problem.
The solid particles in the bed always have a degree of porosity, regardless of
whether the solid is a catalyst or not. The pores contained in each particle may have
different characteristics (size, etc.). Thus, the diffusion of molecules on the solid sur-
face is very important, which has various transport mechanisms, such as intraparticle
diffusion, Knudsen diffusion, or surface diffusion. The latter, for example, depends on
the surface characteristics, such as high or low surface area. Typically, one determines
the effective diffusion encompassing both characteristics.
The apparent rate constant, ka, depends also on the properties of the solid as well
as diffusion and/or mass transfer, in addition to temperature and concentration. The
rate can be calculated as rate per unit volume, rate per unit area, or rate per unit mass.
For example, for a first-order reaction, the rate per unit volume is:
r = (mol/(L s)) = kCA
The ratios of rates for different conditions and for the same reaction order (first
order) is:
rate/volume:
rV = (mol/L s)L = kCAV with k (s−1)
rate/mass:
r′′W = (mol/L s)L = k′′CAW with k′′(Lgas/g s) and W(gsolid)

Therefore, for any system:

The scheme shown in Figure 22.1 allows us to classify reactors according to the mag-
nitude of the rate expression. Assuming a rate that depends on the rate constant k′ for
a first-order reaction. For reactions such as gas–solid and/or gas–liquid–solid, they can
be classified as follows.
For a specific speed k′ the next cases [4] have been:
k′ small →big particles →fixed bed
k′ big →small particles →it cannot be fixed bed
In the solid particles (catalytic or noncatalytic reactions), the main factors that
affect the reaction rate are:
Chemical reaction surface
Resistance to pore diffusion
Resistance to mass transfer in the film surrounding the particle
Temperature gradient in the particle
Temperature gradient in the film.

Heterogeneous reactors
639
There are many different combinations that may be established, depending on the
solid and the fluid, according to the following table (Table 22.1).
Both diffusion coefficients and mass transfer are important, but they depend on the
different solids, drainage (flow), and particles porosity. The effective diffusion involves
Knudsen and convective diffusion, which depends on the phase of fluid (gas or liquid)
and pore size (large or small). These coefficients are characterized by Peclet number
(Pe), which depends on the axial or radial dispersion and diffusivity. Depending on
the velocity profile, these coefficients can vary radially or axially. The diffusion and
dispersion coefficients can also vary due to its dependence on the radial position. If
the coefficients vary along the reactor, as in heterogeneous reactors, for example, the
velocity is not constant. Thus, the axial dispersion occurs.
There are several correlations that represent how the dispersion varies with
Reynolds number in the radial and axial direction, as shown in Figure 22.2.
In this chapter, the Reynolds number is defined in terms of equivalent diameter, i.e.:

where:

(22.1)
εD = dispersion due to diffusion
ε = bed porosity
dt and dp = tube diameter and particle diameter.
For Re > 10, it is observed that the Pe (Per or Pez) is independent of flow. With
Per up to 10 and Pez is ∼1.0 for gases and liquids.
However, for Re < 1, Pe decreases linearly for gases, indicating a molecular diffu-
sion. For flows in liquid phase, the behavior is different. Since for low Re, the radial
and axial variation is greater.
In particulate systems, the order of magnitude of the radial and axial effects is not
uniform. Some hypotheses can be made for simplicity, neglecting the radial and axial
effects, approaching them to the ideal conditions.
The first condition is to choose a Reynolds number such that flow be homogeneous
and uniform radially and axially, i.e., with a good dispersion. The radial gradients may
be insignificant when the ratio of the tube diameter and the particle diameter is large.
This makes the difference between the velocity at any position and the velocity of a
fluid practically negligible.
It is recommended that:
dt
dp
> (10 →30)
(22.2)
By the correlation:
Per =

⎣19, 4

(22.3)
One must calculate the term dt/dp for conditions with number of Per →0. There is
no radial concentration gradient and the radial velocity is uniform in the same direc-
tion. However, in adiabatic systems or with a radial temperature variation, the radial
concentration range changes. Thus, the radial dispersion cannot be neglected.
For systems with Re ≥10 (i.e., Pez ∼2), the axial dispersion cannot be neglected.
That dispersion depends not only on flow, but also from bed concentration gradi-
ents along certain directions. Under isothermal conditions and steady state, it was
established that beyond reason:
dt
dp

It must satisfy the ratio between length and the catalytic bed diameter (or particle
diameter). This ratio must be larger than 50 (Levenspiel, 2001).
Thus:
L
d > 50
(22.4)
Both axial and radial dispersions can be neglected for differential reactor operating
at low conversions.
In summary:
For dt

and under isothermal conditions, the radial dispersion is negligible, but the axial
dispersion is not. Therefore, the basic equation is:

(22.5)
where r is reaction rate (mol l−1 s−1) while ε∗
z is axial dispersion.
For L

one can neglect the axial dispersion. Therefore, considering an ideal PFR reactor:

dz = −rA

FIXED BED REACTOR
In the design of a fixed bed reactor, it is necessary to know the rate of reaction encom-
passing mass and diffusion effects. These effects on the reaction rate can be represented
by the effectiveness factor η, with pore diffusion, besides the effects of mass. This will
be represented by an overall rate r′′ (mol mass−1 h−1) or r′ (mol/area−1 h−1).
There are different types of fixed bed reactors, the most known are:

Not isothermal reactor with axial dispersion.
In some cases, it is assumed a pseudohomogeneous. That is, considering negligible
the radial and axial effects. In other cases, the reaction can occur in the tube wall
(monolith).

Chemical reaction engineering
Besides chemical reaction, it is very important to know the flow even in non-
ideal reactors, determining the pressure drop in the reactor, this latter is given by the
following equation

dz = 2fu2
s ρg
gdp
(22.7)
where:
us = superficial velocity
dp = particle diameter
ρg = gas density
f = friction factor.
From the friction factor, one can find several correlations in the literature on this
variable. We can use the Ergun’s equation (Froment and Bischoff, 1979), which is
usually practiced in the literature:
f = 6.8(1 −ε)1.2
ε3
Re−0.2
(22.8)
The above equation is valid for Re/(1 −ε) < 500, where ε is the bed porosity.
There are other correlations and they can be found in the literature (Froment and
Bischoff, 1979).
Let us consider a special case of adiabatic reactor without dispersion. The reactor
can be considered as an ideal nonisothermal reactor. The heat is generated due to
chemical reaction, i.e., the process is exothermic.

The rate constant forward (k1) is related to the reverse (k−1) through the equilibrium
constant or by equilibrium conversion, according to Equation 22.11. In adiabatic
system, the constant depends on temperature and therefore by the Arrhenius equation.
k = k0 e−(E/RT) = k0 e−(γ/(T/T0))
(22.15)

The energy balance for an adiabatic reactor is:

between T0 and T, we get (see Equation 14.83):

the equilibrium conversion. The influence of these parameters on the conversion and
the reactor volume is shown qualitatively in Figure 22.3 (a–d). Figure 22.3a shows how

how the conversion of equilibrium changes with temperature. And, finally, Figure
22.3c and d demonstrates how the conversion varies with temperature for different
values of rate constants and the solutions to different temperatures, respectively.
22.1.1
Reactors in series
In adiabatic reactors in series, each stage of cooling intermediates can be used from
the knowledge of the rate expression as a function of conversion and temperature. The
main objective is achieving higher conversions at lower temperatures in the output of
the reactor. As an example for a series of three reactors, the temperature T0 represents
the initial value of the first reactor at a rate constant ¯β (Figure 22.4). At the intersection
of straight line (Equation 22.18) and the curve r1, we can reach “B,’’ temperature T1
and conversion XA1. At the exit of the first reactor, cooling the mixture to a temperature
smaller T10in C. Assuming the same rate β and with the intersection of the line and
the curve r2, one can find a temperature smaller T2 and a larger conversion D, as can
be seen in Figure 22.4.
Thus, one can construct a system with three reactors in series, achieving high
conversion efficiencies from smaller values of temperatures.

Example
E22.1 (Coulson and Richardson, 1971) According W.J. Thomas, the production of
SO3 from SO2 is carried out adiabatically. The composition of the mixture at the inlet
of the reactor is: 7% of SO2, 11% of O2, and 81% of N2. The inlet temperature in the
first reactor and the molar flow are 400◦C and 170 mol/min, respectively. Calculate
the mass of catalyst to a conversion of 79% at the outlet of the reactor.

FLUIDIZED BED REACTOR
A typical fluidized bed reactor is characterized by an ascending gas (or liquid by flu-
idizing agents) flow, which keeps or drags small particles located in the reactor. The
reactant gas in contact with the solid particles of the bed facilitates the reaction because
of the high flow velocity and short contact time. However, the velocity of flow may
vary according to the specifications of each process.
These effects are important and facilitate the transport of heat and mass transfer,
in most cases. In general, particles are dragged and they can recirculate within the
bed by a process called regeneration. For example, process for catalytic cracking of
petroleum.
The advantages of the fluidized bed are:
•
Surface area is large, because the particles can be very small, which facilitates heat
transfer and mass;
•
High reaction rates if compared to fixed bed reactors;
•
Increased heat transfer coefficients and mass;

•
Easy to control both heat transfer and fluid flow system;
•
Easiness in flow in pipelines because the solid particles behave like fluid.
The disadvantages are:
•
Backmixing due to particle distribution in dense and dilute phases
•
The calculation of the average residence time is too hard, it was not possible to
predetermine the position of the particle in the bed
•
Possible channeling, slugging, and attrition of catalyst
•
Energy consumption due to high pressure drop (requires high fluid velocity)
•
Possible agglomeration and sintering of fine particles in the dilute phase under
certain conditions (e.g., high temperature).
The starting point to determine the hydrodynamic behavior of the fluidized bed is
to define if the particles remain static or dragged by gas flow. To verify and establish
the flow regime, one must measure the pressure drop as a function of the superficial
velocity, as shown in Figure 22.6.
The pressure drop in the bed is proportional to the superficial velocity (1–2), whose
variation is characteristic of the fixed bed and reaches a maximum value in (3). From
this point, fluidization of the particles begins. At this instant, the minimum fluidization
velocity umf is identified, maintaining constant pressure drop in the fluidized bed (4–6).
Then, particles begin to be dragged out (6) of the catalyst bed, whose pressure drop
decreases until it reaches the point (7).

Heterogeneous reactors
651
The pressure drop can be determined directly, according to the equation below:
p = Lmf(1 −εmf)(ρs −ρ)
(22.20)
where:
Lmf =bed height at minimum fluidization
εmf =void fraction of the bed at minimum fluidization
ρs =solid density
ρg =gas density.
It can be observed that it is possible to calculate the height corresponding to the
minimum fluidizing condition. From the knowledge of the values of solid density, gas
density, and void fraction, one can easily determine the pressure drop.
The minimum fluidization velocity, umf, can be determined directly from experi-
mental data (3), as shown in Figure 22.6. And, similarly, one can determine the terminal
velocity, ut, or drag velocity, ut (7). There are other empirical correlations for these
velocities (Kunii and Levenspiel, 1991).
umf = 1.118 × 10−13 d1.82
p
(ρs−ρ)0.94
ρ0.06µ0.88
(22.21)
where:
dp =particle diameter (µm)
µ =dynamic viscosity (N s/m2).
As the superficial velocity increases, the bed becomes less dense where the par-
ticles are dragged and distributed along the bed. Thus, the terminal velocity may be
calculated from classical empirical equation:
ut =

4dpg (ρs −ρ)
3ρ · CD
(22.22)
CD is called as drag coefficient. For a laminar flow, we can calculate it from
equation below:
CD = 24
Re
where:
Re = dpρut
µ
(22.23)
To obtain a proper fluidization, the actual fluid velocity, ufl, must be consider-
ably greater than the minimum fluidization velocity, umf. However, to avoid excessive
entrainment, ufl should be less than the terminal velocity, ut. Thus, the ratio ut/umf is
a guide to selection of the value of ufl.
However, one must consider that the hydrodynamics of the fluidized bed undergoes
some deviations, as described below.

•
When the diameter of the bubble (gas) has a value of the same order of magnitude
as the diameter of the tube, the fluidized bed will operate in slugging regime, where
the bubble occupies the entire cross section of the bed. Depending on the size of
the bubble, we might have preferred paths in bed. These cases do not contribute to
a good contact of the gas with the suspended particles in the bed, therefore, they
should be avoided. The most suitable solution is the choice of a particular type of
gas distributor in the inlet of the reactor.
•
In the fluidized bed, the effects of mass transfer and heat are benefited, which
may allow a homogenization of the bed temperature and facilitate contact of the
reagent with the solid particles.
Then, it can be affirmed that the fluidized bed does not behave as a reactor ideal.
That is, their behavior differs of the flow in PFR or continuous stirred-tank reactor
(CSTR) ideals. These particulars do not cover the scope of this chapter; hence they will
not be studied here.
The flow of gas bubbles in contact with the particulate phase results in a dense
phase or phase emulsion. The bubble is surrounded by a “dense cloud’’ of particles,
where there is the exchange of flows with heat and mass transfer and chemical reaction.
Figure 22.7 shows this phenomenon.

Heterogeneous reactors
653
In the gas phase (bubbles) (1), the velocity is high and there is no chemical reaction.
In this case, we can admit a flow identical those used in PFR.
While in “phase emulsion’’ (2), the flow is not homogeneous. Therefore, their
behavior undergoes large deviations from ideal behavior of both PFR and CSTR.
Therefore, diffusion effects can occur, as well as preferred paths.
The main problem is the lack of knowledge about the interface between phases (1)
and (2) where the exchange phenomenon occurs. Therefore, the interfacial area, the
diffusion and mass transfer between the gas and the emulsion phase are unknown.
To understand the behavior of the fluidized bed, one can determine the average
residence time or the residence time distribution (RTD) from the tracer technique. For
instance, RTD in fluidized bed dryer is usually carried out by means of the stimulus-
response technique, in which an impulse of solids marked with some appropriate tracer
is fed to the dryer and its time of elution and concentration measured at the exit of
the dryer. The material of the tracer has to be such that it can be detected and does
not react with the substrate material, and its form of application and response are well
known (Levenspiel, 1972).
Besides RTD, other techniques are needed to predict the behavior for the design
of a fluidized bed, using mathematical models with parameters to be adjusted based
on information from experimental data.
The mass balance of the representative diagram in Figure 22.7 for the gas and
emulsion phase, considering continuous and isothermal system, are described below:

There is an interface between the bubble phase (gas) and the dense phase (emulsion)
containing the solid particles. The reaction occurs at the interfacial zone in dense area
within a given volume Vi, where it is assumed that the density of the solid phase,
ρs, must be equal to density of the emulsion phase, ρe. This volume was determined
empirically by Patridge and Rowe (1965) as follows:

where ρe corresponds to the fraction of the total volume occupied by the bubble
in interface zone (emulsion), disregarding the solid mass of the bubble.

Equation 22.25 can be solved admitting a first-order reaction. Thus, a solution of
type conversion versus spatial time is obtained (XA × W/F0), as shown in Figure 22.8,
according to various parameters.
Note that there are significant differences when comparing the fluidized bed
reactors with the ideal reactors. The most important parameters are effective diffu-
sion coefficients, De, and interface transfer coefficients, ki. These parameters can be
determined by Equations 22.30 and 22.31.
The model presented by Kunii and Levenspiel (1991) is intended for a sim-
ple system, which comprises a “bubble + interface’’ phase, called intermediate zone

Solution
To calculate the bed length, we must know the global reaction rate. However, the
mass transfer coefficients at the interface must be determined as a function of reaction
variables. Furthermore, we need to first determine the velocity of the gas bubble.
From the feed stream annual, we can calculate the gas stream daily knowing the gas

INTRODUCTION
Various types of industrial reactors may occur in different phases as applications and
desired properties of the final product, for example, the fixed bed, fluidized bed,
slurry bed, and bed phase reactors. In fluidized bed reactors as in slurry bed, the solid
(catalyst) is composed of very small particles and moving along the reactor. The fluid
flow over these reactors is complex. In these systems, the flow of the fluid phase is
not homogeneous and there are large deviations from the ideal behavior of a CSTR or
plug flow reactor (PFR), characterizing them in nonideal reactors.
On the other hand, there are exceptional advantages in these reactors, such as
improved heat and mass transfer, increased contact between the reactants, and mainly
lower contact time reaction.
As in ideal reactors, the kinetics and reaction conditions are similar. However, the
distribution of products is quite different and to correlate them with the experiments, it
requires a more detailed study of the conditions of nonideality, for example, interfacial
and surface phenomena, heat and mass transfer, and flows types. These phenomena
characterize the axial and radial dispersion, caused by diffusion and convection.
The most known reactors are shown in the Figure 23.1. In the PFR reactor, the flow
can take place in a velocity profile laminar or turbulent. The laminar flow in the PFR
reactor is characterized as not ideal because the velocity profile within a cross section
is not uniform and, consequently, the contact time between molecules is different in
the center and close to the reactor wall. In a turbulent flow, the velocity profile is not
uniform, but generally it behaves like uniform flow and closer to the ideal conditions
of an ideal reactor because the contact time between the molecules of the reactants is
approximately equal.
The flows in catalyst beds are different from those presented in the fixed bed,
fluidized bed, or slurry. The flows are random; they depend on empty spaces within
a fixed bed, through which the gases or fluids flowing, and to the apparent velocity
of the solid within a fluidized bed/slurry. These phenomena are characteristic of the
nonideal reactors.
There are two ways that allow us to characterize the nonideal reactors:
1
From the dispersion effects, which cause deviation from ideal behavior. This
analysis is performed from the determination of the residence time distribution
(RTD) in a system without chemical reaction and determining the effect on the

reaction, comparing the calculated conversions from the experimental conver-
sions. This method is conducted to analyze the systems separately, segregated
models (micromixing) and not segregated (macromixing).
2
From the basic equations of momentum, energy, and mass diffusion effects, and
radial and axial convection, with or without chemical reaction. Additionally, we
evaluate also the parameters that cause the deviation from ideal behavior and
we adopt criteria to estimate the effects of radial and axial dispersion on the
reactor.
For the first item, an analysis is made through the segregated and nonsegregated
models using experimental results of RTD. In the second item, we will use the balance
equations of mass, heat, and momentum.
In studying the ideal reactors, which are limiting cases, no significant influence
of other phenomena caused by the flow, the mass, and heat transfer. Therefore, the
parameters studied so far were determined in kinetic regime and without considering
the effects of transport phenomena. When this happens the actual rate is less than the
intrinsic rate constant.
In CSTR reactors, the flow has preferential paths. In continuous tubular reactors,
the flow may be laminar, turbulent, and have “dead’’ volumes. The flow may cause
radial and longitudinal diffusion effects and therefore to result temperature gradients
and radial/axial concentration. Therefore, the flow may affect the chemical reaction.

Nonideal reactors
663
The recognition of the reactor can be done by using the so-called “population
balance.’’ What does this mean? Consider an irreversible chemical reaction of first
order and under isothermal conditions, whose solution is:
τ = −1
k ln (1 −XA)
where XA = conversion of A, k = reaction rate constant, and t = reaction time.
The time “t’’ is the contact time or residence time of molecules in the reactor. In
the batch reactor, it is assumed that measured time is equal to the average contact time.
However, in a continuous system, this time may or may not be equal to the contact
time, because the distribution of molecules or properties (in the reactor inside) may
not be uniform (or homogeneous), and it depends on the type of flow. Therefore, it
is impossible to determine the kinetic properties without knowing the “true’’ reaction
time.
In fact, the flow of a fluid element formed by a set of molecules is not uniform.
Thus, the residence times are different, which characterizes the nonideal reactors.
As we have seen in previous chapters, the flow depends on the geometry of the
reactor. The cylindrical tubular reactor is the most used, but there are other ways, such
as conical or cylindrical shapes with cross flows.
About the type of reactor to be selected, it depends not only on the stream, but
also on several other factors:
(a)
Flow closer to the ideal conditions and residence time equals;
(b)
Lower pressure drop in the reactor;
(c)
Charge of the reactor (catalyst or filling), which aims a better flow and lower
pressure drop;
(d)
Heat exchange internal or external, which depends on the type of reaction con-
ducted, that is, if it is exothermic or endothermic and if the process is isothermal
or adiabatic.
The flow in the reactor (superficial velocity within the cross section of the reactor)
varies according to the operating conditions and geometry of the reactor.
The velocity profile of the laminar flow into a cylindrical tube, for example, may
be calculated and to provide a variable velocity distribution in the cross section. This
causes a variation in contact time of the molecules along the reactor and therefore
cannot be considered an ideal reactor.
In turbulent flow (high Reynolds number), the velocity distribution varies in axial
and radial direction with higher velocities close to the inner walls of the reactor and
providing greater uniformity in the center of the tube. Thus, the higher the velocity,
the greater the uniformity of its profile in the reactor, favoring a uniform contact and
an average residence time between the ideal molecules. Therefore, in turbulent flow,
there is an approximation to the ideal flow.
The packed bed reactor, particularly catalytic reactors, present a distribution of
velocity quite heterogeneous and is very difficult to predict the void space and prefer-
ential paths, which depend on the type and shape of the packed column, in addition to

the catalyst particles and their positions inside the reactor. However, the contact of the
molecules is higher due to the increased contact area, which facilitates the reaction.
In addition to the flow, one should consider the effect of mass and heat transfer.
In reactors without filling, it is possible to predict the heat exchange and to determine
the conditions for isothermal or adiabatic operation from the temperature profile in
catalytic bed. For uniform flows, the heat transfer depends on the heat capacity. Thus,
temperature profile can be uniform, causing large deviations in conditions where heat
capacity is very high.
In the packed bed reactor, there is also the influence of heat conduction from par-
ticle. As we know, the temperature affects substantially the rate constant and therefore
the reaction rate. In parallel, there are the effects of mass transfer by convection and
diffusion in the pores of the particles. Therefore, these effects change the kinetics
considerably and hence the chemical reaction rate.
The considerations in the previous paragraph are also valid for the flows in tanks
and batch reactors. However, the contact between the molecules also depends on the
geometry of the reactors. To avoid the undesirable “dead volumes,’’ greater agitation of
the system becomes very important, increasing the contact between molecules. Contact
is instantaneous and concentration at the outlet of the tank or batch reactor should be
as uniform as possible. Thus, the ideal condition is achieved when the reaction mixture
is perfect. Figure 23.2 shows some examples.
We will see later that techniques developed to address these issues using concepts
of fluid properties distribution in systems based on probability theory. We will also
see the concepts of RTD for the reactions and fluid flow, and other properties, such as
distribution of solid particles treated by particle population balance.

RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION
The residence time considers the time that each fluid element or group of molecules
remains in the reactor; it also depends on the velocity of the molecules within the
reactor, and therefore the flow in the reactor. The residence time can be equal to the
space time if the velocity is uniform within a cross section of the reaction system, as is
the case of an ideal PFR. However, this situation is not the same for tank-type reactor,
because the velocity distribution is not uniform. In most nonideal reactors, residence
time is not the same for all molecules. This result in variations in concentration along
the reactor radial, i.e., its concentration inside and outlet tank reactors are not uniform.
This means a need to define the residence time and calculate their distribution for each
system.
One can visualize RTD through an experiment with the use of “chemical tracers,’’
introducing them at a particular moment or since the beginning of the reaction. This
chemical tracer should necessarily be a compound not reactive to the system under
study, by measuring its concentration in the reactor outlet. In general, dye compounds
are used, but also other materials can be used with conductive or radioactive material
properties that can be measured quantitatively.
Monitoring the tracer at the outlet of the reactor, one can observe different situa-
tions for the labeled molecules. For instance, an ideal flow, such as a piston, it will be
noted that for an average time all molecules come out in the same instant (Figure 23.3a).
In a reactor tank the opposite occurs, the concentration of labeled molecules decreases
with time at the outlet of the reactor (Figure 23.3b). Nonideal reactors have an inter-
mediate behavior where the concentration of the labeled molecules at the exit of the
reactor will have a Gaussian distribution. At the beginning, a small fraction of labeled

molecules are identified in the output of the reactor; most molecules leave the system
at a given instant and then, a small fraction of molecules leaves the reactor, as shown
in Figure 23.3c.
The “tracer’’ can be introduced into the reactor in the form of step or pulse. For
simplicity, we will use the example of a tank reactor with a volume V and a flow of an
inert liquid (water) v0. At a given instant, a chemical dye is introduced into a stream
in the step-form with a concentration C0, and the concentration C is measured at the
outlet of the reactor from the instant t = 0. Thus, from the mass balance presented in
Figure 23.4, we have:
v0C0 −v0C = V

We get:

(23.3)
The concentration of tracer at the outlet varies exponentially with time, indi-
cating a variation of the distribution in the reactor. Thus, the molecules have
different residence times. This is the distribution of concentration within an ideal tank
reactor.

Nonideal reactors
667
Generally, the concentration is related to a function of RTD and assuming that a
fraction of molecules having a residence time between the time interval t and t + dt.
At the instant t, the concentration of tracer at the outlet is C. Thus, we measured a
fraction of molecules that remained in the reactor in a time less than t and another
fraction that remained in the reactor for a time longer than t. The first fraction is
represented by the cumulative distribution function F(t) and the second fraction is
represented by the difference (1 −F(t)). This last fraction C0 does not contain at the
output of the reactor.
From the mass balance at the output of the reactor, we have:
v0[1 −F(t)]C0 + v0 F(t)C0 = v0C
(23.4)
Thus, relating this equation to Equation 23.3:
F(t) = C

Therefore, the cumulative distribution function of residence times is determined
by measuring the concentrations versus time at the output of the reactor. Graphically,
we can represent it as given in Figure 23.5:
The average residence time will be when t = τ or when the area (1) is equal to area
(2), as shown in Figure 23.5. This figure indicates that a fraction of molecules in the

area (1) has a short residence time and another fraction (area 2) has a time longer than
the average residence time, but the larger fraction has a residence time corresponding
to the average value.
In the ideal PFR, the residence time is the same for all molecules, assuming uniform
and constant velocity such that the output concentration of the tracer is equal to the
concentration of the reactor input. Thus, F(t) = 1 or t = τ. The average residence time
in the ideal PFR is equal to the space time.
Any other form of RTD between the CSTR and PFR reactors (ideal) is not
considered ideal.
To determine the function F(t) from experimental data, we use the G property
already defined in Chapter 1. If G is any one property (such as conductivity, ionization,
and wavelength), it is proportional to the concentration G1 at the entrance and G2 at
the outlet. Then, the cumulative residence time fraction which remains in the reactor
at an instant less than t will be:
F(t) = G(t) −G1
G2 −G1

It is observed that longer times indicate that fraction of molecules leaving the
reactor is larger than the average residence time, where the inverse is also true.
Trace in shape of pulse
Another way to determine the residence time occurs when the tracer is injected in
the form of pulse. The response can be calculated at the outlet of the reactor by
concentration, assuming that a fraction of molecules F came out of the reactor in
the time interval t. This fraction of molecules left the reactor with concentration C0.
Thus, in the time interval t, we have the following mass balance:

Ideal cases
In PFR ideal, the response is immediate in shaped-pulse. For ideal CSTR, the ideal
response will be a distribution of molecules not instantaneous (Figure 23.6).
To determine the RTD of a tracer in shaped-pulse at a volume V and a volumetric
flow v0, it is assumed that N tracer units are introduced. The global balance gives us

Figure E23.3.2 shows t × E(t)
From the area calculation (figure above), we find the average residence time:
¯t = 2.35 min
The space time is 3.25 min. Thus we get a standard deviation of 22%.

23.2.2 Variance
The average residence time is the average time of contact between the molecules within
a fluid element. The RTD function, either by F(θ) or E(θ), reports a range of periods
of contact. Therefore, there is a time variation around the average residence time or
variance of RTD.
Analyzing the distribution curves, it can be inferred that the width of the curve
represents the variance. In the case of PFR, this width is null. While the ideal CSTR, it
is relatively large. Therefore, the width of the peak may indicate deviation of behavior
between the two ideal cases.
Therefore, variance is defined as an RTD around the average value and by
probability theory, it can be represented by:
σ2 =
∞

0
(t−t)2E(t) d(t)
(23.17)
where:
θ = t
t
and
tE(t) = E(θ)
Therefore:
σ2 =
∞

0
θ2E(θ)d(θ) −1
(23.18)
For an ideal CSTR, one obtains a variance σ2 = t2. For any nonideal reactor, one
obtains a variance for the peak width and thereby, deviation from ideal behavior. This
method can also be used to determine the RTD function E(t).
E23.4 From the previous example and by using Equation 23.18, calculate the
variance.
σ2 =
⎛
⎝
∞

0
(θ2E(θ)d(θ)
⎞
⎠−1 = 1.26416 −1 = 0.264
σ2 = 0.264

Or:
t2σ2 =
∞

0
t2E(t)dt −t2
t2 · σ2 = 8.09174 −6.40 = 1.689
σ2 = 0.264
Therefore, by calculating the variance, it can be seen the deviation from ideal
behavior of the reactor using axial dispersion by equation that relates the variance
with Peclet number (Equation 15.25):
σ2 = 2
Pé = 0.264
(23.19)
Pé = 7.6
When the Peclet number is large (Pé →∞), we will have a behavior close to ideal
PFR and when it is too small (Pé →0), it approaches an ideal CSTR.
In this example, we conclude that the reactor has a nonideal behavior.
23.3
NONIDEAL COMPARTMENTAL REACTOR MODELS
In the previous sections, different ideal reactor configurations were described and ana-
lyzed. As a matter of fact, the use of ideal reactors for interpretation of kinetic problems
can indeed be important, because it can allow for capture of the most important fea-
tures of typical reaction vessels and better comprehension about the distinguishing
characteristics of each particular reaction process. Nevertheless, when compared with
the proposed ideal benchmarks, real industrial reactors can present distinct behav-
iors for many reasons, including imperfect mixing (due to high viscosity, as in some
polymerization processes, and existence of geometrical constraints for design of agi-
tated tanks), development of radial velocity profiles (due to small diameters of tubular
reactors)among others, as described in the next chapters. For this reason, there are
many incentives to use simple mathematical tools to represent more complex reactor
vessels with the help of the simple ideal benchmarks discussed in the previous sections.
One of these tools involves the combination of ideal reactors to represent different
compartments of the equipment and to form more complex reaction flowsheets – the
compartmental reactor models.
Compartmental reactor models can be defined broadly as reactor models that are
obtained after combination in series or parallel of simpler ideal reactors that are used to
represent smaller sections of the reaction vessel, in the presence or absence of recycling
streams. This type of modeling procedure has been used extensively in the literature
to represent the behavior of actual reactors with help of the simpler and well-behaved

678
Chemical reaction engineering
ideal reactor benchmark models. Some examples have been provided by Mattos Neto
et al. (2005) and Oechsler et al. (2018, 2019) to represent the complex mixing behavior
of real stirred tank polymerization reactors. In this case, the resulting process flow-
sheets do not represent real physical industrial arrangements, as discussed in detail in
Chapter 14, but realizations of complex mixing patterns through combination of ideal
benchmark models. However, it is not possible to present general rules for building
of such compartmental models, although some useful examples are presented in the
following examples for illustrative purposes.
E23.3.1 The occurrence of shortcuts (reactor bypasses) and dead volumes (stagnant
zones) inside real agitated reaction vessels can be modeled with help of the com-
partmental procedure, as illustrated in Figure 23.3.1. In this case, the shortcut and
deadzone sections can be described with help of standard ideal stirred tank models,
leading to more complex reactor configurations in which the distinct reactor sections
exchange mass (and energy when the reaction is not performed isothermally). This sort
of arrangement emphasizes the fact that a reaction vessel can present distinct mixing
zones and that mixing may not be perfect.

Nonideal reactors

where it is assumed that the volumes of the two reactor sections remain constant
during the operation. As one can see, the behavior of a reactor vessel that presents
different mixing zones can be different from the one discussed in Section 14.3.2 for an
ideal stirred tank. As a matter of fact, the technique can be extended to accommodate
multiple mixing zones, as often performed when the reactor vessel is equipped with a
mixer that is composed of multiple blades (Embiruçu et al., 2000, 2008a, 2008b).

One must observe that the behavior of the ideal reactor depends essentially on
two parameters, as discussed in Section 14.3.2: the residence time, τ = V1/F1, and
the kinetic rate constant (k). On the other hand, the proposed compartmental model
depends on a much larger number of parameters: the residence time of the shortcut

section, τ1 = V1/(F1 + F3), the residence time of the deadzone section, τ2 = V2/F2, the
kinetic rate constant, k and the recycle ratio, φ = F2/F1. Therefore, the behavior of
nonideal reactors can be far more complex than their ideal counterparts. It is also
interesting to observe that some additional constraints must be satisfied:
V = V1 + V2
F1 + F3 = F2 + F4
F2 = F3 + F5
Therefore, when F5 = 0:
F2 = F3 = φF1
F1 = F4
τ = τ1 (1 + φ) + τ2φ
and it becomes possible to specify τ, τ1, φ and k. Particularly,
V1
V1 + V2
= τ1 (1 + φ)
τ
= α
which clearly indicates that global residence time of the reactor, τ, is related to recycle
ratio, φ and the relative volumes of the two compartment sections (that define α and
τ1). Assuming V1 = 1 m3, F1 = 1 m3/h (τ = 1 h), F5 = 0 m3/h, Ce
A = 1000 gmol/m3 and
k = 1 h−1, Figures 23.3.2 to 23.3.3 can be used to illustrate the effects of α and φ on the
concentrations of each compartment and of the output stream (Cout

As one can see in Figures 23.3.2 and 23.3.3, concentrations of the main reactant
A are always smaller in the stagnant section of the reactor, due to the higher effective
residence time and lower feed concentration, when compared to the shortcut section.
One can also observe the asymptotic convergence of concentrations to the reference
value of 500 gmol/m3 in both sections as recycle ratio and volume fraction of the
shortcut section increase. This is because the compartmental model approaches the
ideal stirred tank reactor model when mixing is enhanced and volume segregation is
diminished.

which is a second-order linear differential equation, that leads to distinct dynamical
responses, when compared to the ideal stirred tank reactor. This can be very interesting
for practical purposes, as the ideal reactor is characterized by a single time constant
(that depends on k and τ), while the nonideal reactor is characterized by as many
time constants as the number of compartments that are needed to represent the mixing
pattern. For instance, using the variables defined previously, the equation becomes:

as illustrated in Figures 23.3.4 and 23.3.5. As one can see, the nonideal compartmental
model contains two time constants, while the ideal reactor is described by a single time
constant. Therefore, obtained dynamic responses are different in both cases. As shown
in Figure 23.3.4, the variation of the reactant concentration in the output stream
is faster in the nonideal reactor, because of the shortcut zone. As shown in Figure
23.3.5, the variation of the reactant concentration in the stagnant zone is slower in the
nonideal reactor, because of the second-order process, as feeding of the stagnant section
depends on the previous increase of concentrations in the shortcut section. Therefore,
very complex dynamic patterns can evolve if multiple mixing zones are present in the
reacting system.

responses in reaction systems. For instance, reaction can take place in feed and output
lines, so it can be interesting to investigate the compartmental model illustrated in
Figure 23.36. In this case, the feed and output sections can be described with standard
plug flow reactor models, leading to reactor configurations in which the distinct reactor
sections exchange mass (and energy, when the reaction is not performed isothermally).
Delays associated with transportation of mass and occurrence of undesired reactions
outside the borders of the reaction equipment are not unusual in industrial sites.

Catalysis: Analyzing variables
influencing the catalytic properties
24.1
INTRODUCTION
Catalysts are very important for many applications and different processes, in partic-
ular in the chemical and petrochemical industries, also in energetic and environmental
processes, and nowadays in material developments. Generically, catalytic reactions are
classified into homogeneous and heterogeneous or heterophase systems.
Although most catalytic processes have been solved, there are new processes and
catalyst developments aiming higher efficiency in different industrial applications in
homogeneous and heterogeneous processes. Older processes or catalysts can be opti-
mized with respect to the performance and stability in view of many variables affecting
activity, provoking deactivation, or poisoning. In particular, new and alternative cat-
alysts have been studied and modified for environmental processes, fine chemistry,
hydrotreating of heavy oils, hydrogen generation, C1 chemistry, biomass processes,
and new nanometric materials.
24.2
SELECTION OF CATALYSTS
Reactions are classified into groups or families and catalysts in different solid materials.
For each family of reactions, there are one or more solid groups, like metals, oxides
having particular specific activities. The reactions can be classified by reactivity or
similar functionality and so are materials with specific properties.
In general, empirical developments are limited, focusing global kinetic parameters
of different reaction family groups for specific material groups (metals or oxides) and,
if possible, correlating the activity with material properties.
Table 24.1 shows a general classification of reaction families and materials.

First, is the reaction structure sensitive or insensitive? According to Boudart,4 sup-
ported catalysts have dispersed metallic particles of different sizes d. With increasing
or decreasing particle sizes, the concentration of accessible atoms or sites varies signif-
icantly, indicating surface structural changes. Structure sensitive reactions (SSRs) are
those reactions where the intrinsic reaction rate relative to the accessibility of surface
sites or the turnover frequency (TOF) varies with particle sizes or diameters, but it
does not vary for structure insensitive reactions (SIRs). It means, for SSRs, the TOF
depends on particle sizes, or dispersion of particles or on the accessible surface sites
of the catalyst. On the other hand, for SIRs, the activity or TOF is independent of the
particle sizes.
Dehydrogenation reactions are known as SIRs, while hydrogenolysis reactions are
SSRs. Some reactions include several steps simultaneously with different reactions,
which are structure sensitive or insensitive.
24.3.2
Cyclohexane dehydrogenation
This is an SIR. The reaction rate is directly proportional to the surface active sites,
and the intrinsic activity or TOF does not depend on particle diameters. The cyclohex-
ane dehydrogenation (CHD) reaction forms only benzene and hydrogen as products,
according to Figure 24.1, and occurs under atmospheric pressure and temperatures
varying between 250◦C and 300◦C.
Table 24.2 shows the results of CHD for a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for low concentra-
tions. The Pt dispersion on alumina is almost 100%.

Benzene is the final product for all tests. The activity or TOF values remain constant
around 1 s−1, suggesting that the rate is proportional to accessible active sites. From
the Arrhenius plot, one determines the activation energy which is also constant.
24.3.3
Benzene hydrogenation
The hydrogenation of benzene is a model reaction for characterization of metallic
surface sites which is an SSR. According to Figure 24.2, the final product is only
cyclohexane.
Experiments were performed using palladium Pd0 supported on carbon and were

zene at 373 K and from CO chemisorption measurements. TOF values increase with

CONVENTIONAL PREPARATION METHODS OF CATALYSTS
The most important challenge is to confer desired characteristics to the solid, aiming
to design specific catalysts. In most cases, there are conventional direct procedures

that confer desired properties; however, there are other new and innovative advanced
methodologies in study, searching for more specific properties.
The formulation of a correct catalyst is a compromise between the fluid flowing
system of the reactor and the activity or stability. The relative importance of these
factors depends on the reaction system, the reactor design, reaction conditions, and
economic factors.
Flow distribution and low pressure drop can be achieved selecting particles with
appropriate sizes and formats and good mechanical resistance. The formulation or
fabrication of a catalyst must attend a specific industrial process. The more severe are
the conditions (charge, temperature, and high pressures or space velocities) the more
difficult are the design parameters of the catalyst.
In general, catalyst can be classified into three categories:
1.
Bulk catalyst
2.
Impregnation on preshaped supports
3.
Mixed/sintered materials
The preparation method depends on which application it is used in. In general,
there are different steps as shown in Figure 24.3. The catalysts are formed by:
•
Active phases
•
Supports
•
Promoters

Active phases
The active sites or phases are the most important components and responsible for
reaction occurring. The first choice to design a new catalyst is the selection of the
active component.
Supports
The supported catalyst may have different attributes but the most important are the
specific surface areas and the stability of the catalyst. A support stabilizes the active
phases and is thermally stable. Materials must support high temperatures, in particular
for exothermic reactions. Therefore, these materials must have high melting points
(Table 24.4).

694
Chemical reaction engineering
The ideal and unique function of the support is to improve the dispersion of the
active phases, without reactivity or inert for undesirable side reactions. Indeed, such
characteristics can be achieved with oxides having high melting points.
The simultaneous presence of acid sites may favor reactions involving free rad-
icals. In fact, with γ-Al2O3, there are undesirable site reactions, such as cracking,
isomerization, and coke formations, and the later one favoring the deactivation of the
catalyst.
However, there are cases where the acidity of the support influences positively the
main reaction. In this case, the catalyst is bifunctional, and the best example is the
reforming of hydrocarbons. The main objective of the reforming is the conversion of
naphtha compounds with low octane number (paraffins and naphtenes) into branched
or aromatic compounds with high octane index.
Promoters
The promoter is the third component of the catalyst that when added (in general small
amounts) makes the catalyst more active, selective, and more stable. The aim of the
promoter is to improve the stability of the support and of the active phases. The most
used support is the gamma alumina (γ-Al2O3).
24.4.1
Precipitation/coprecipitation methods
In this section, we present a summary of the principal preparation methods, whose
details can be found and described in several other references.
It is important to remember thermodynamic properties or in particular the solubil-
ity constants, besides the energy involved and verify if the process is thermodynamically
possible. Very important is the precipitation kinetics and how far it is from the
equilibrium which influences the precipitation rate.
There are two kinds of materials resulting from the precipitation: amorphous
and crystalline or mixed materials, with different properties. For crystallites, the
precipitation occurs in two steps (:
1.
Nucleation: germination in a homogenous solution phase. The interaction of ions
and molecules occurs in the solution with the formation of germs and clusters
beginning the crystallization process. If the precipitation occurs in the presence
of a support, it is a heterogeneous process where germination occurs due to the
interaction between ions of the solution and the surface occurring nucleation and
formation of crystallites.
2.
Growth: it is a physical–chemical process where crystallite nucleus grows at the
solid–solution interface; the rate growth depends on the kinetic rate.
Cerium oxide is a good example and one of the most significant materials for
supports or catalyst in the reforming and partial oxidation processes. It is special,
having high oxygen storage capacity, promoting the partial or total oxidation reac-
tions. It is also a good support for metals, like platinum, palladium, and gold. The
cerium oxide was prepared starting with a solution of 0.20 mol/L of cerium nitrate
(Ce(NO3)3 × 6H2O 99.0%, Vetec). Then, cerium hydroxide is precipitated after slow
addition of 1.0 mol/L of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH 99.0%, Vetec) at room tem-
perature. The precipitate was filtered under vacuum and washed with deionized water

under air flux for 10 h. Figure 24.5 shows the diffraction pattern. The specific surface
area was 71 m2/g and Figure 24.6 shows the microanalysis.
24.4.2
Impregnation of metals on supports
This is the most important method for preparation of industrial catalysts, and there
are different methodologies, however, the most important is the impregnation over
frame-shaped solids, like pellet or extruded. The solution with specified metal concen-
tration, varying time, temperature, and pH transfers the active phase to the support,
and after drying and calcination, it is fixed and stable. The support is in general
an inert material or can be partially active; however, the main properties must be
well defined. In this case, the volume of solution must be sufficient to fill all pores,
known as dry impregnation. When the support is in powder form, the volume of
solution needed is higher than the pore volume of the support, and the impregnation
is known as wet impregnation. Thus, the impregnation method can be divided into
two types:
•
Without interaction
•
With interaction
In the first case, the solution contains the active substance and the support is inert
or partially active. The preparation can be dry or wet impregnation (Figure 24.7). In
this method, the solution drops slowly in the Becker containing the solid.
Vpores = Vsolution ⇒volume for dry impregnation
Vsolution > Vpores ⇒volume for wet impregnation

The impregnation occurs by diffusion or wetting. For diffusion, the time
estimated is:
tdiffusion = td = x2
D
(24.1)
where x is the distance in pores and D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2/s).
The impregnation time must be greater than the diffusion time:
timpregnation > td
The impregnation time can also be estimated as follows:
t = 4µ.x2
σ.r
(24.2)
where µ is the viscosity.
In the impregnation with interaction with the solid, there are covalent and ionic
bindings. The pH is the most important parameter and indicates superficial electric
charges. If the resultant electric charge is zero, it is known as zero electric charge and
identified as isoelectric point (IP), where the electric charges are compensated. In this
state, neither the solution nor the colloidal system does transport electric charges.
If pH > IP, then the surface or the solution has positive electric charges attracting
anions, annulling total electric charges. In the colloidal solution, it forms amorphous
aggregates. However, when pH < IP, then the negative superficial charge or the solution
attracts cations which are compensated. In the colloidal solution occurs precipitation.
Each oxide has its IP, or zero electric charge, for example:
Al2O3
PI pcz 8.0
TiO2
PI pcz 5.0 −6.0
SiO2
PI pcz 2.0
Summarizing:
[M+ · · · O2−] + H+ ↔M+ −OH−↔[M+ · · · OH2]+ + OH−
(24.3)
If acid →surface (+) →exchange anions
If surface (−) ←basic →exchange cations
Thus, proton H+ can exchange cations of type Ni2+, Pd2+, Pt2+, and Au3+.
Hydroxyls OH can exchange complex anions.
24.4.3
Ion exchange
The ion exchange occurs between ions A of solid MO with ions B of solution S,
according to the following reaction:
AMO + BS ↔BMO + AS
(24.4)

698
Chemical reaction engineering
The well-known example for ion exchange is Pt on zeolites. The exchange occurs
between ions of solution and ions of zeolite as follows:
[Pt(NH3)2+
4 ]s + 2[NH+
4 ]z ↔[Pt(NH3)2+
4 ]z + 2[NH+
4 ]s
(24.5)
More details can be seen in the literature [Le Page].
Example
For example, we present here the monolithic support (Figure 24.8) which is an inert
material (2MgO × 5SiO2 × 2Al2O3). It is highly resistant and has been used in different
processes. The main advantage is the low residence time or contact time of the order of
milliseconds. It presents 400 cells in−2 (D = 12 mm, L = 8 mm) as shown in Figure 24.8.
First, γ-alumina was deposited by washcoating and then impregnated with the
active phase. The γ-alumina was prepared with a solution which contains urea and
deposited by dipcoating of small pieces. until reaching 10% concentration of Al2O3.
The active phase was impregnated with a solution of Ni(NO3)2 × 6H2O (Vetec) and
concentration of 291 g/L, then dried and calcined and successively impregnated until
reaching 6% concentration of nickel. The metal oxide content on the NiO/Al2O3
coated cordierite monolith catalysts was 5.3 wt. %, based on the total mass of the
monolith support, after three cycles of immersion and heating treatment. The adher-
ence was qualitatively measured by ultrasonic vibration test. The weight losses were
1.3% and 0.3% for /Al2O3 and NiO, respectively, after exposure to ultrasonic vibra-
tion for 30 min, which are extremely good when compared to reported values in the
literature, about 4.0%. These results confirm that the urea method is efficient for
washcoating Al2O3 phase and nickel oxide over a cordierite monolith.

ANALYSES OF VARIABLES INFLUENCING FINAL
PROPERTIES OF CATALYSTS
Variables influencing the preparation by precipitation, coprecipitation, precipitation–
deposition, and impregnation transform chemical and physical properties approaching
the equilibrium conditions. The main variables are:
•
pH
•
Aging time
•
Temperature
•
Precursors
24.5.1
Influence of pH
The pH values influence significantly the formation of intermediate complexes during
the preparation by precipitation or precipitation–deposition. For example, gold cat-
alysts are prepared with a gold precursor (HAuCl4 solution), and pH influences the
formation of gold complexes, the maximum content, and the presence of chlorine.
The ions [AuCl4]−form different complexes, as shown in Figure 24.10. Complexes

Au(OH)3 species which are the precursors of gold nanoparticles.
24.5.2
Autoclaving
Autoclaving is performed in a batch reactor under high pressure and different temper-
atures. There are thermal and hydrothermal transformations in the presence of steam
water, resulting in structural changes. In the presence of a solvent, the precipitated
solid suffers structural and textural modifications, but in principle the main steps are:
1.
Dissolution: part of the solid in the presence of a solvent or water undergoes
solvation of the metallic ions with the rupture of bindings and formation of new
bonds with the solid.
2.
Diffusion: transfer of the solvated ion from the solid to the final solid.
3.
Dissolvation: the inverse phenomena of the first step, where the ion goes to
the solid and then is integrated in the new solid structure occurring again as
precipitation.
The transformations occurring are:
Small crystallites →large crystallites
Small amorphous particles →large amorphous particles
Amorphous solid →crystalline solids
Crystallites (1) →crystallites (2)

702
Chemical reaction engineering
24.5.3
Influence of time, concentration, and impregnation cycles
There are maximum concentrations that can be deposited on the surface. The diffi-
culty is to impregnate high metallic concentrations in one step. When the support is
preshaped, such as cylinders or spheres, the impregnation time is important. For short
times, the metallic distribution is concentrated at the external surface. Long impreg-
nation times improve the metal distribution inside pores of the pellet or extruded, as
shown in Figure 24.11.
For higher metal concentrations, the successive impregnation is employed for sev-
eral cycles until the desired concentration is reached. The metal distribution must
be homogeneous. In practice, higher concentrations can be reached with 3–5 cycles
(Figure 24.12).

THERMAL TREATMENTS
24.6.1
Drying
During the drying process, the residues and solvents are eliminated, transforming gels
into xerogels. The mass loss depends on the heating rate, and involves heat and mass
transfer phenomena.
.m = akm(ps −pg)
(24.6)
.q = a′h(Tg −Ts)
(24.7)
where a and a′ are the interface areas; km, h the mass and heat transfer coefficients,
respectively; and p, T pressure and temperature of the gas (g) and solid (s), respectively.
Figure 24.13 shows the mass loss and drying rates and the temperature of the different
transformation phases.
The rate increases up to the equilibrium temperature at the surface, and then it
remains constant. During this step, the temperature increases. With time, drying pro-
ceeds to the inner cake, and the rate as well as rate mass transfer decreases significantly
with increasing temperature till the final temperature. The heat transfer rate is impor-
tant to obtain a homogenous drying. In the drying processes, usually the rate is of the
order of 10◦C/min.

The drying process is also very important for wet impregnation and for the elimi-
nation of solvents. The higher the heating rate the lesser the contact of the gas with the
surface, which favors the formation of smaller particles and in opposite, the slower the
heating rate the higher the contact time of the drying gas with surface, and consequently
bigger particles are favored, as shown in Figure 24.14.
24.6.2
Calcination
During the calcination with or without gases, there are decompositions of hydrox-
ides, carbonates (gel, xerogel) transforming into oxides which are chemical reactions,
transforming one compound to other compounds. During thermal treatments, there
are following cases:

Phase transformation can be followed by thermogravimetry, measuring the mass
loss and the temperature difference with increasing temperature, as shown in Figure
24.15.
The effects of calcination are significant in modifying textural and morpholog-
ical properties, affecting the surface area, pore volumes, and structures. There are
also differences between bulk and supported materials. In the first case, one observes
from Figure 24.16 that how these parameters change with increasing calcination
temperature.
It shows that the specific surface area decreases with increasing temperature of
calcination.
Starting from precursors, like nitrates or sulfates, the specific surface area increases
drastically reaching high values and then decreases due to structural crystalline rear-
rangement. Starting from crystals, like alumina or silica-alumina, with increasing
calcination temperature, the specific surface area decreases due to sintering or agglom-
eration of crystallites. The classical case is the alumina. Starting from γ-Al2O3 with
a surface area of around 200 m2/g, it is transformed into α- Al2O3 which presents a
surface area of the order of 20 m2/g.
On supported catalysts, the effect of calcination is significant on particle sizes,
dispersions, and crystallite sizes. Measurements of particle sizes or metal dispersions
after calcination and reduction of supported catalysts indicate different situations and
there are three cases that are illustrated below.

24.6.2.1
Effect of calcination and digestion over reduction and metallic
surface area
The first case illustrates how the calcination temperature and digestion time affect
metallic area and degree of reduction of the alumina-supported NiO for different Ni
contents.
Results indicate that the reduction without calcination presented higher reduction
of NiO and higher metallic area for different Ni contents. After calcination, both
reduction and metallic area decreased significantly, independent of the digestion time,
which suggests agglomeration of particles or interaction with the support during the
calcination step. The digestion time did not affect the metallic area and the reduction.
Figure 24.17 displays the effect of calcination and reduction temperature on the
metallic Ni0 area. The precursors were calcined separately at 300◦C and 500◦C and
reduced with H2. When calcined at 500◦C, the metallic area increases with increasing
reduction temperature allowing the reduction of big and small particles at the surface.
However, when calcined at 300◦C, the metallic area indicates two different situations.
In the initial situation between range A and B, there are big NiO particles which
are reduced to metallic Ni0:NiO →Ni0.
In the range B and C, the metallic area decreases because NiO interacts with the
support and the reduction of these particles is more difficult.

In between C and D, the metallic area increases due to the reduction of nickel
particles with strong interaction with the support and the reduction of nickel aluminate
NiAl2O3 →Ni0 + Al2O3. These particles are not easily reduced to metallic Ni0.
Therefore, there are following situations as shown in Figure 24.17.
24.6.2.2
Influence of calcination temperature over dispersion and
particle sizes
The effect of calcination temperature on particle diameters of a Pt/SiO2 catalyst after
reduction is displayed in Figure 24.18. The precursor was calcined and present as PtO2
or PtO. After reduction, it is transformed into metallic Pt0. Figure 24.18 shows the
effect of calcination temperature on dispersion and particle sizes.
The dispersion decreases drastically whereas particle diameters increase with
increasing temperature. It is assigned to crystal growth or strong interaction with
the support or sintering and therefore results in the formation of silicates which are

growth from smaller to bigger particles.
24.7
EFFECT OF REDUCTION TEMPERATURE ON INTERACTION
AND SINTERING
The influence of the reduction temperature on the metal support interaction and par-
ticle agglomeration occurs frequently on supported catalysts and will be illustrated
for nickel-supported catalysts. It depends on the support, the metal concentration,
the calcination temperature, the reducing agent, the H2 concentration, and the pres-
ence of water. When promoted with potassium, lanthanum, or any other promoter, the
reducibility and the metallic distribution improve. After calcination, nickel is converted
as oxide (NiO), also as suboxide (Ni2O3) and as aluminate form.
NiO + Al2O3 →NiAl2O4
(24.12)
The reduction of nickel oxide after calcination occurs as follows:
NiO + H2 →Ni0 + H2O,
H = 0.4 kcal / moles
(24.13)
If the reduction is direct of the precursor nitrate, then the following reactions may
occur:

H = 11.9 kcal / moles
(24.14)

INFLUENCE OF THE SUPPORT AND METAL
CONCENTRATION OVER THE REDUCTION
The supports γ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3 exhibit different structures and have specific sur-
face area of around 200 m2/g and <10 m2/g, respectively. Typical reduction profiles of
supported NiO, with 8% and 16% content are shown in Figures 24.19 and 24.20.
These figures show two reduction peaks of nickel species those Alberton et al.
attributed to the reduction of NiO without interaction with the support for lower
temperatures, while for higher temperature there are reduction of NiO species linked
to Al3+ species of the alumina support formed during the impregnation step.
The α-Al2O3 sample shows shifting of the maximum reduction temperature with
increasing metal content. Comparing the first reduction peak of the supported samples
with the reduction of bulk NiO, it turns out that with increasing metal content, the
reduction is facilitated. Results show the same behavior for the second peak. According
to Li and Chen, the reduction rate of NiO depends, besides other factors from the
nucleation of metallic Ni. Indeed, higher metal concentrations favored the reduction
of Ni species and so the reduction rate.
The degrees of reduction of the 8% and 16%Ni/α-Al2O3 were 59.4% and 22.0%,
respectively. In fact, there is a significant amount of Ni species that is not reduced,

although under H2 atmosphere and temperatures up to 1000◦C. It seems that the
catalyst with higher metal content has lower reducible Ni sites.
The absence of NiO on the supported catalysts γ-Al2O3 is probably due to the
high-specific surface area of the support. It suggests high dispersion of Ni species
which under calcination at 550◦C provoked the formation of NiAl2O4, as detected by
XRD. Indeed, H2 chemisorption measurements do not allow determining dispersions
of Ni particle sizes. TEM or XRD in situ reduction analyses succeeded. Figure 24.21
shows the diffraction of 8%Ni/α-Al2O3. The NiO lines were not more observed above
500◦C, but typical lines of metallic Ni are observable. Thus, only metallic Ni was
detected by XRD above 653◦C. From the diffraction line (1 1 1) at 44.5◦, 0.232 rad,
we calculated the crystallite sizes (dNi) 45 Å and thus the dispersion (DNi) 1.9% of Ni.

INFLUENCE OF THE HEATING RATE
The influence of the heating rate of reduction after calcination and of direct reduction
on the metallic area and dispersion of the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is illustrated in Table 24.7.
As seen, heating rates do not affect the dispersion or metallic area of the calcined
sample, but influence these variables on catalysts after direct reduction, evidencing
higher dispersion with lower heating rates.

INFLUENCE OF VAPOR
The effect of the presence of H2O vapor on the reduction of a 10% nickel-supported
catalysts is shown in Figure 24.22. The reduction was performed with a mixture of

The first peak is associated to the reduction of NiO with low interaction with
the support, while the second and third peaks, which are partially superimposed, are
associated to the reduction of NiO interacting with the support, thus, to the reduc-
tion of nickel aluminates. The reduction degree was 100% and the particle sizes of
200 Å. XRD data confirmed the existence of metallic Ni, aluminates and lanthanum
aluminates in this sample after reduction.

EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE AND REACTION TIME
The reaction temperature, mainly for exothermic reactions, affects the structure and
textural properties of the catalysts which cause deactivation. The consequences are
structural modifications or sintering of the catalyst. The most important identification
of sintering is the analysis of crystal sizes or particle sizes before and after reaction.
Frusteri et al. measured the particle sizes by TEM analysis of a 21%Ni/MgO
sample for ethanol reforming at 650◦C with H2O/EtOH after 20 h reaction, as well
as, the influence of alkaline metals. Figure 24.23 displays the particle size distribution
before and after reaction, showing the presence of big particles evidencing sintering.
When doped with Li and K, the deactivation is less affected.
24.12
STRONG METAL SUPPORT INTERACTION
Transition metal oxides are easily reduced promoting interaction with metals of group
VIII. This phenomenon was designated by Tauster as strong metal support interaction
(SMSI). The main characteristic of the interaction is the lower metal surface exposition,
drastically decreasing the chemisorption capacity of H2 above 500◦C. The TiO2 is
an n-type semiconductor, with defects in the lattice conferring special conditions for
interactions and hence geometrical or electronic effects.
Horsley assigned the SMSI effect of Pt/TiO2 to charge electric transfer from tita-
nium to platinum atoms in the covalent bonding Pt–Ti that becomes stronger than
the bonding between Pt–Pt atoms. When reduced with H2, it forms oxygen vacancies
producing Ti3+ ions which attract platinum atoms, modifying the electronic density.

The reduction profiles of platinum-supported catalyst (1%Pt w/w) are displayed
in Figure 24.24. The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a maximum peak at 250◦C with a
shoulder at 370◦C, in agreement with the literature. The hydrogen consumption is
presented in Table 24.10 and corresponds to the reduction of Pt4+ to Pt0+.
However, the Pt/TiO2 catalyst exhibits reduction at room temperature and at
112◦C, 372◦C, and above 500◦C, besides peak shift to lower temperatures due to
the reduction of PtO. Partial reduction of TiO2 to TiO2−x occurs at higher tempera-
tures which are attributed to SMSI. The presence of Pt atoms promoted the reduction
of titanium which in turn facilitates the reduction of platinum at the surface.
The calculated dispersion of Pt atoms at the surface of alumina was 54%, consid-
ering the reduction degree of 82% of platinum oxide (Table 24.8). On the other hand,
the Pt/TiO2 catalyst has two times more hydrogen consumption than the alumina-
supported catalyst, indicating reduction of TiO2 and thus interaction with metallic
Pt0. The H2 chemisorption is three times less (17%) than the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and
confirms SMSI effect after reduction at 500◦C.
Jiang and collegues claim that the Ti3+ cations may adsorb hydrogen and then
diffuse through the support, decreasing the adsorption rate of hydrogen dissociation.
Table 24.19 presents the mean particle sizes of metallic Pt0 from CO chemisorp-
tion and TEM analyses of these samples. The results are in good agreement and in
accordance with XRD analyses, suggesting mean particles sizes less than 5 nm.

TPR and chemisorption results confirm the SMSI effect after reduction with H2
above 500◦C. Indeed, oxygen vacancies are formed, producing Ti3+ ions, attracting
Pt atoms. This effect is caused by charge transfer of TiO2 atoms to platinum atoms
through the covalent bonding Pt–Ti.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN—INFLUENCE OF PARAMETERS
ON THE CATALYTIC PERFORMANCE
The main goal is to design minimum number of experiments needed for the selection
of variables influencing catalytic properties. The effect of experimental conditions on
the parameters used for evaluating the performance using the minimum number of
experiments (runs) was proposed using a full factorial design of experiments.
Experimental design is an important tool to determine the dependence of vari-
able and to analyze statistically and coherently the experimental results. The classical
method is the full factorial design.
The idea is to design the experiments that provide exact information about the
variables and thus defining the main objectives and selecting the appropriate tech-
niques. For each target, there are associated techniques. Knowing the most important
variables and the effect of these variables on the system and the interactions between
them, then the full factorial design may predict minimum experiments.
In general, the system can be represented by a functional equation containing
correlated factors or variables (entrance) and responses (exit). In particular, the full
factorial design requires specifying the upper and lower limits of each factor. This
method suggests two limits which are maximum value represented by +1 and minimum
value represented by −1.
Besides, it is important to estimate errors for evaluation of these effects. Therefore,
deviation of different factors indicate how experiments are reliable, assuming the same
error for similar experiments. These calculations allow determining the main effects
and the interaction effects.
The main effect (b1) of a factor (x1) is defined as the difference between the average
response when the maximum value is (y(x1+)) and the minimum value is (y(x1−)),
according to equation:
b1 = y(x1+) −y(x1−)
Without interaction between the factors (x1, x2, …, xn), the effect of a specific factor
(xj) is equivalent to the effects in the lowest level, when the other factors are in highest

716
Chemical reaction engineering
level. Therefore, the difference between these effects can be used as a measure of the
interaction xj with the other factors. In fact, consistent with the definition of the main
effect, the interaction effect is defined as the difference between two averages, and thus,
the tests must be separated into two groups, according to the levels of each factor (+1
or −1). For example, the interaction between factors x1 and xj can be calculated
by doing separate tests where both factors assume the maximum (x1+ and xj+) and
minimum (x1−and xj−) levels and where the factors assume these levels alternatively
(x1+ and xj−or x1−and xj+). Therefore, the interaction effect between x1 and xj, or
b1j, can be calculated by the difference between averaged responses of each testing
groups, according to equation:
b1j = [y(x1+, xj+) + y(x1−, xj−)]/2 −[y(x1+, xj−) + y(x1−, xj+)]/2
where y(x1+, xj+) is the response when the factors assume maximum values, y(x1−,
xj−) the responses when the factors assume minimum values, and analogous y(x1+,
xj−) and y(x1, xj+) the responses when these factors assume maximum and minimum
values alternatively.
In fact, the levels are represented as +1 for the highest and −1 for the lowest
level. For calculation of the interaction effect between two or more factors, tests are
grouped and those factors which are significant assume levels that multiplied result in
+1 or −1.
For example, in the selection of a catalyst for soot combustion, the evaluation of the
combustion temperature (TC), the selectivity of CO2 (SCO2), and possible interaction
between these factors can be calculated using inlet variables. The main factors are the
ratio of catalyst and particulates (cat:PM), heating rate, and gas inlet flow rate. From
the experimental oxidation profiles and the amount of CO and CO2, we determined
the combustion temperature TC, as the temperature for maximum CO2 formation, or
selectivity (SCO2), after complete conversion of particulates (PM).
Two levels, maximum (+1) and minimum (−1) values, were attributed for these
three factors and according to the full factorial design resulted in eight tests.
1.
Ratio cat:PM: 2:1 and 95:1
2.
Heating rate: 2 K/min and 20 K/min
3.
Flow rate O2/He: 5 mL/min and 115 mL/min
Therefore, the average values were calculated and following values were obtained:
Ratio cat:PM: 49:1, heating rate: 11 K/min, and flow rate O2/He: 60 mL/min.
Table 24.10 presents the values of combustion temperature (TC) and selectivity of
CO2 (SCO2) according to the experimental design and the averages, deviation values
of TC and SCO2.
Table 24.10 presents also tests with corresponding deviation values and excellent
reproducibility.
The flow rate affected the CO2 profiles as shown in Figure 24.25. As observed,
there are interactions between the rate cat:PM and heating rates when the flow is low,
or for high heating rates, elevated temperatures, while for high cat:PM ratios, the
reaction is not limited and reaction occurs at lower temperature. The oppositeoccurs

for low heating rates and cat:PM ratios. These results are in good agreement with the
expected interaction factors cat:PM and heating rate parameters.
From these results, it turns out that the combustion temperature is an impor-
tant parameter for testing and comparison of the catalytic performance with certain
limitations, since it can be strongly influenced not only by activity tests but also by
experimental measurements. Moreover, it depends on the maximum peak temperature
and precise evaluations.

CONCLUSION
The main goal of this chapter is to present the catalytic properties under the influ-
ence of different variables before and after treatments, after a brief introduction of
the catalyst preparation, with specific examples showing affected differences and not
characterization methods which were reproduced partially from my book on hetero-
geneous catalysis, published before. It shows how industrial catalysts are affected and
modified during pre- and posttreatment or reaction conditions.

Free radical polymerization of styrene
A polymer may be formed by hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of
monomeric units. This material can also be present in natural form, for example,
cellulose and rubber. The characteristics of these macromolecules depend on the
monomer, chain length, and composition of the mixture. The mechanism and kinetics
have been presented. We present the free radical polymerization of styrene (solution
polymerization) as an example.
This type of polymerization is quite simple. We used as an example, an experiment
from an organic mixture of benzene and styrene with azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN).
AIBN is the reaction initiator, which undergoes a thermal dissociation to form free
radicals.

Procedure
Styrene was dried over CaCl2 and purified by two successive vacuum distillations
(50 mbar) over Na. The same procedure was performed with benzene. AIBN was
purified with methanol recrystallization before use and drying in vacuum at room
temperature. The round-bottom flasks must be clean and dried repeatedly. Place the
flask in a water bath (or another heating fluid) at 50◦C. The system was deaerated with
nitrogen gas flow before reaction (to remove O2). The reagents (benzene and styrene)
are introduced into the flask. After the system reached the reaction temperature, the
initiator was introduced. Small samples (∼10 mL) are removed from the system every
2 h for determination of the kinetics. These samples are put into a container which
contains an inhibitor (hydroquinone) and then weighed (by gravimetric method). Dur-
ing the experiment, the reaction solution must be maintained with strong agitation.
After the end of reaction, the material is weighed and then sent to a vacuum oven.

Polymerization of isobutylene
It is intended to study the polymerization reaction of isobutylene. This reaction is
known as one of the most important processes for cationic polymerization, and also
called catalytic reaction Friedel-Crafts. The high reactivity of the polyisobutene is
obtaining a product with high concentration of double bonds.
The aim of this example is to determine a mode of production of polybutene to
obtain a product similar to standard UV-10. This means, to produce a material with
a greater concentration of terminal double bonds from the process variables and a
commercial catalyst.
Initially, the experimental system was designed for adjustment to process, as shown
in Figure 25.2. RAF1 and butane are added continuously to the reactor. After reaching
the reaction volume, the system was maintained under pressure for about 1 h. The
reaction was initiated from the addition of co-catalyst and a HCl gas stream. At the
end of reaction, the product was “washed’’ in a solution of NaOH (1.0 N), separated,
and distilled. Some tests with temperature variation were applied to the system (0 to
Tamb). The reagents used were isobutene pure (AGA 99.0%) and RAF1.

Chemical reaction engineering
Figure 25.3 Polymer obtained by using BF3 as catalyst.
The variables investigated during the process were the temperature and the concen-
tration of co-catalyst (HCl/Cat = 3 and HCl/Cat = 1). The products were characterized
by infrared (FT-IR). The infrared analyzes were conducted at room temperature in a
Perkin-Elmer 2000 FT-IR at a resolution of 4 cm−1.
Due to the formation of HF during the procedure, it was adopted to use a Teflon
reactor. The process is highly exothermic (as well as most of the processes of poly-
merization). After using the Teflon reactor in the first reactions, it was replaced by
a stainless steel reactor with the aim of increasing the safety of the process. Other
variables chosen were the largest volume and a good cooling system, where it was
possible to control the temperature in a better way. For a better understanding one of
the process steps, see Figure 25.3.
One of the conditions used for polymerization reactions is described in Table 25.1.
The pure isobutene and its mixture with RAF1 (from the polybutene) were used
as initial reactants in the process. The addition of reagent is conducted slowly,
avoiding a significant increase in temperature. After the end of the addition of
isobutylene, the temperature remained stable at around 7◦C. In an initial volume
(reactant + ethanol in dichloromethane) of 1000 mL, a yield of 600 mL was obtained,
approximately.

with a K-Type sensor associated to a controller/programmer and coupled to an electric

The experimental system also has a mass flow controller for gases with four chan-
nels. Four-way valves that allow these currents are diverted from saturators (by-pass).
A three-way valve allows to replace the gas (He) through the reaction mixture.

The determination of the volumetric flow rates is easily performed by a flowmeter
and a stopwatch (by soap-film method). It is necessary to consider the pressure drop
when the gas bubbling through the saturator to yield calibration curves as a function
of the soap-film burette method.
To prevent condensation of liquids, gases are maintained at a temperature of 75◦C
by electric resistance heating system, in this case, a VR115 voltage regulator.
25.2.1.1
Chromatographic analysis
Analysis of the results is conducted by a gas chromatograph in series with the experi-
mental unit, in which the chromatograph is equipped with an active phase column
(Hayesep D), thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and flame ionization detector
(FID). The carrier gas used was helium at a flow rate of about 12 mL/min at 20◦C.
The calibration system is made by injection of mixtures-certified standards with
known concentrations (H2, CO, CH4, CO2, and H2O). According to the calibration,
one can calculate the respective conversion factors obtained from the areas of the
chromatographic peaks and subsequently a mathematical treatment is performed to
normalize the data.
Figure 25.6 shows one typical chromatogram obtained, which is observed a low
sensitivity to H2. In Table 25.2 presents the retention times and the calibration factors
for each of the components.

To analyze the feed to the reactor, helium gas is bubbled into saturators containing
the liquid for at least 40 min at desired temperatures. The mole fraction corresponding
to the area of a given component (reactor feed) can be determined from the external
standard, from a simple calculation as shown in Equation 25.3 below:

25.2.1.3
Verification of the kinetic regime
To verify the kinetic regime, two tests are performed, in which the volumetric flow (v0)
is changed and keeping the ratio constant (mcat/v0).
For the system of kinetic regime, the conversion remains unchanged in experiments
that have the same ratio (mcat/v0). If the external mass transfer determines the reaction
rate, an increase in volumetric flow tends to decrease the boundary layer between gas
and catalyst surface, increasing the concentration of gaseous species on the surface and
consequently the reaction rate.
25.2.1.4
Catalytic tests
Tests are conducted at atmospheric pressure. The partial pressures of liquids are deter-
mined by the thermostatic baths (temperature control) and volumetric flow rates
passing through saturators. The methodology of these calculations is described in
detail in Patat and Kirchner (1975).
In general, the catalysts are reduced under flow v0 (mL/min) from a mixture 10%
H2/He and heated to a temperature T (◦C) at a specific heating rate (10◦C/min). For the
adjustment of the reactants partial pressures, the gas flow is stopped. After the system
reached the desired conditions in saturators, several samples from the feed (containing
liquid and water) are analyzed in the chromatograph. Since conditions have stabilized
input, the reactor temperature is raised to the reaction conditions (Tr) and then, the
reaction starts.
To analyze the external and internal mass transfer, the space velocity must be
increased and keeping constant the ratio mcat/FEi (catalyst mass/molar flow of liquid).
These tests are made on the temperature and partial pressure of liquid in reactor feed.
For example, the catalyst mass and volumetric flow rate of the gas used in the first test
are, respectively, 25 mg and 100 mL/min (mcat/v0 = 25 × 10−5 gcat × mL−1 × min−1).
For the second test, the mass and volumetric flow rate are reduced to half to obtain
the same ratio, thus, the conversion is evaluated.
The space velocity is calculated (GHSV) as follows:
GHSV = y0
Ei · v0
mcat
(25.5)
where y0
Ei is the molar fraction of liquid in the reactor inlet, v0 is the volumetric flow
(mL min−1); and mcat is the mass of catalyst (g) used in the test.

Determination of activation energy: dehydrogenation of

This example shows a reaction conducted in a microreactor at 1 atm, from a quan-
tity of 10 mg of catalyst previously dried and under flowing of N2 (30 cm3/min) at
393 K in 30 min. Then, the catalyst is reduced with 1.5 H2/N2 and the same flow at
500◦C in 30 min. After reduction and cooling was introduced, a stream of H2 passes
through the saturator containing cyclohexane (99.9%) at 15◦C (H2/C6H12 = 13.2).
The space velocity (GHSV) used was 170 h−1 to a temperature variation of 250 at
300◦C. The conversion was kept below 10%. The products were analyzed by a chro-
matograph FID. The dispersion was determined by chemisorption of H2 and the TOF
was calculated by the dispersion of the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts.
Benzene was the only product found and the catalysts were not deactivated after
4 h of reaction. The alumina showed no activity. The results are shown in Table 25.3.
Figure 25.7 shows the TOF with the inverse of temperature. The activation energy
found was 24 ± 2 kcal/mol.

Kinetic study—methane reforming with
CO2—heterogeneous reaction
In this practical experimental reports how can we determine the catalytic activity and
reaction kinetics in methane reforming with CO2. A great effort has been directed to
the development of active and stable catalysts for this reaction.
Among the several catalysts tested in methane reforming with CO2, the Pt/ZrO2
catalyst yields good results of activity and stability. The objective is to determine the
catalytic activity of the Pt/ZrO2 systems in different experimental conditions.
25.2.3.1
Experimental part
The tests are conducted on the multipurpose unit, as shown in Figure 25.5. The pre-
treatment of the catalysts consisted of drying up to 150◦C, under a flow of helium gas
for 30 min, followed by reduction at a mixture 10% of H2/Ar (30 mL/min) until the
temperature of 500◦C (10◦C/min). Then, the catalysts are cooled to room temperature

and 10% CO2/He.
The catalytic tests with chromatographic analysis can be performed at atmospheric
pressure in a fixed-bed quartz microreactor. The mass of catalyst used was 20 mg
and a total flow of the reagents of 200 mL/min, with a ratio CH4:CO2:He of 1:1:18
(GHSV = 600,000 cm3/h gcat). The gas flow of gases is monitored by the mass flow
controllers with transducers valves connected to a four channel control panel (MKS),
which allows an accurate dilution of the mixture reagents.

The results for different catalysts (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/ZrO2) are shown in Figure 25.8.
The equilibrium curves were obtained from commercial process package Aspen PlusTM
(Aspen, 2006).

Determination of rates
In order to determine the kinetics in a particular model, one determines initially the
effect of variation of partial pressure of CH4 and CO2 on the rate of consumption CH4

experimental measurement was obtained after 30 min of reaction. When the pressure
of CH4 is kept fixed at 19 Torr, the consumption rate of CH4 shows two different levels,
PCO2 < PCH4 and PCO2 ≥PCH4. When the pressure of CO2 is kept fixed at 19 Torr, the
consumption rate of CH4 increases with increasing pressure until 27 Torr; for pressures
above this value, the rate is nearly constant.

(In this mechanism, p represents the platinum site and z the support site.)
The slow steps of this model are decomposition of CH4 {A} and the reaction of
the CHx fragments with adsorbed species of CO2 {E}. For catalysts that inhibit the
formation of residual carbon (kinetically), the surface concentration of carbon in the
metal surface (as CHx) remains constant, that is, the decomposition rate of CH4 is
equal to the reaction rate of CHx with CO2:
rCH4 = kCH4 · PCH4 · (p) −k−1
CH4 · [CHx−(p)] · P(4−x)/2
H2
= k · [CO2(z)] × [CHx−(p)]
(25.11)
Assuming step {B} in equilibrium, it has been:
KCO2 · PCO2 · [z] = [CO2 −z]
(25.12)
Therefore, two equations are formulated at independent sites. Assuming the
surface concentration of H2 negligible:
(p) + CHx−(p) = 1
(25.13)
(z) + CO2(z) = 1
(25.14)
and substituting Equations 25.12, 25.13, and 25.14 into 25.10, we find the
following equation for the reaction rate of methane:
rCH4 =
k · KCO2 · kCH4 · PCO2 · PCH4

Kinetic constants were calculated using the following procedure:

When the partial pressure of H2 is null and with CH4 at constant pressure, the
reaction rate of methane can be expressed by:
rCH4 =
a · PCO2
b · PCO2 + c
(25.16)
where a, b, and c are as follows:
a = k · KCO2 · kCH4 · PCH4
(25.17)
b = k · KCO2 + KCO2 · kCH4 · PCH4
(25.18)
c = kCH4 · PCH4

(25.20)
where A =

Hence, by plotting PCH4/rCH4 versus PCH4, we obtain the constants A and B.
(b)
When the partial pressure of H2 is null and with CO2 at constant pressure, the
reaction rate of methane can be expressed by:
rCH4 =
a′ · PCH4
b′ · PCH4 + c′
(25.21)
where a′, b′ and c′ are as follows
a′ = k · KCO2 · kCH4 · PCO2
(25.22)
b′ = kCH4(1 + KCO2 · PCO2)
(25.23)
c′ = k · KCO2 · PCO2
(25.24)
This equation can be linearized as follows:
PCH4
rCH4
= A′ · PCH4 + B′
(25.25)
where A′ =
1+KCO2·PCO2
k·KCO2·PCO2 and B′ =
1
kCH4
Hence, by plotting PCH4/rCH4 versus PCH4, we obtain the constants A′ and B′.
(c)
From the constants A, B, A′, and B′, we can calculate kCH4, KCO2, and k.
The kinetics parameters calculated from this procedure are shown in Table 25.4,
as well as the correlation coefficients obtained for the PtZr catalyst at 55◦C.

Experimental practices
735
The proposed model fit well to the data obtained by kinetic tests for the catalysts
containing zirconia. However, the results show that the kinetics can be simplified.
Thus, considering:
1 ≫KCO2 · PCO2
Therefore:
rCH4 = kCH4 · PCH4 = 0.03 · PCH4

PERFORMANCE OF REACTORS
In this section, some practices in batch and continuous reactors are presented in order
to determine the performance in terms of conversion, selectivity, and yield. These
examples were conducted in partnership with some Brazilian industries.
25.3.1
Batch reactor–hydrogenation of sucrose
The evaluation of catalytic hydrogenation was carried out in batch reactor of 450 mL
and under pressure (Parr autoclave). To eliminate the diffusion effects, the reactor was
equipped with double-helix stirring device at specific positions: near the bottom and
on the surface of the reactant (height of the liquid mixture). To visualization of the
system, Figure 25.11 presents the reactor used for this example.
Figure 25.12 shows a schematic representation of the interior of the reactor. We
can see that the system is provided with an inner cooling coil (in case there is a thermal
runaway), one valve for the gas flow, one pressure relief valve, and one for sampling.
From that figure, one can observed the agitation system, input reagent (gas), and
thermocouple.
The analysis of the operating conditions for the hydrogenation of sucrose was
based on industrial conditions to obtain a conversion of approximately 90% to 65 min
of reaction.
The introduction of hydrogen was controlled to maintain the reactor pressure at
40 bar (580 psig), and agitation rate used was 1200 rpm. The heating procedure used
is described in Table 25.5. The concentration of the sucrose solution was fixed at 50%
(w/w) of sucrose diluted in distilled and deionized water.
This procedure was adopted in the production of various experiments by varying
the reaction time to obtain levels of conversion of around 60%, and then compare
the various catalysts used. Thus, we worked with a reaction time of 50 min to reach a
temperature of 130◦C. These conditions are summarized below:
Reactor volume = 450 mL
Mass of the Raney–Nickel catalyst with 6% (pnewcat./psolid) = 10.92 g
Reaction temperature = 130◦C
Total pressure = 40 bar (580 psig)

The results of the hydrogenation reactions at 50 min and 130◦C of the leached cat-
alysts at 100◦C (except commercial) are described in Figure 25.13. The Raney–Nickel
commercial catalyst showed the highest conversion (∼60%) followed slightly below of
the Cr–Mo promoted catalyst. The other additive catalysts showed a conversion level
of about 35%, which was similar to that obtained by the Ni–Raney (100) (leached)
catalyst (manufactured in NUCAT lab) at 100◦C. The order of activity of the catalysts
tested is shown below:

During the isomerization process, ethylbenzene can react in different ways:
O-xylene isomerization;
Disproportionation to benzene and diethylbenzene;
Dealkylation.
Bifunctional catalysts (acid hydrogenation over supported metal) are required for
the isomerization reaction. Under these conditions, reactions of hydrogenation of aro-
matics (reactants and products) and of alkene reactions occur simultaneously as well as
secondary reactions, such as hydrocracking of naphthenic and hydrogenolysis. Due to
the acidic character of the support, the transalkylation reactions, disproportionation,
and isomerization of xylenes also occur in bifunctional catalysts.
o-xylene ↔m-xylene ↔p-xylene
(25.28)
We emphasize that conversion of meta-xylene to ortho-xylene is undesired.
Studies already published in the literature report that a higher activity for platinum
catalysts supported on zeolites compared with γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts (Katzer,
1977). In addition, the reactions of ethylbenzene through routes of isomerization,
transalkylation, and disproportionation are reported as preferred.
In this way, an evaluation of commercial catalysts requires a methodology for
simultaneous monitoring of activity and selectivity, as well as evaluating the catalytic
stability under operating conditions.
The objective is to evaluate commercial catalysts based on platinum (Pt1, Pt2,
and Pt3), comparing them on the activity and selectivity for use in an industrial
isomerization of xylenes.

1
Evaluation of the activity of catalysts based on platinum for the conversion of

2
Determination of selectivity of platinum catalysts for the conversion of ethylben-
zene to xylenes.
3
Performance evaluation of catalysts subjected to forced deactivation.
The catalysts were tested for performance under operational conditions, as shown
in the Table 25.6. The steps of drying, activation, reaction, deactivation, and
revaluation were conducted as shown in Figure 25.14.
25.3.3.1
Drying
The catalyst is dried in a N2 gas stream (24 L/h) with 1% of O2 (1.2 L/h of air) at
400◦C for 10 min (400◦C/h). Then, the catalyst is cooled to 225◦C under the same gas.
At 225◦C, a N2 gas stream (pure) for 5 min is used.
25.3.3.2
Activation
N2 is replaced by H2 and changing the flow rate to 8.3 L/h gcat, simultaneously, the
reactor is heated to 400◦C and maintained for 1 h.
25.3.3.3
Reaction
After the complete reduction, reactor is pressurized and the reactants are introduced.
After introduction of feed, the reactor is heated to 425◦C and kept at this value for
24 h. Thus, the temperature is reduced to 360◦C and the load is introduced.

Deactivation
After withdrawal of the last sample at 360◦C, feeding is interrupted and the reactor
is cooled to room temperature, under H2 flow. H2 is replaced by N2 at 600 mL/min,
increasing the temperature to 450◦C at a rate of 5◦C/min for 3 h. We introduced a
liquid load (1 mL/min). The system is cooled to 385◦C and the load is interrupted, N2
is replaced by H2. And again, the liquid load (2 mL/min) is fed to the system.
The tests were carried out in bench unit, as shown in Figure 25.15.
Samples were removed at 360◦C, 370◦C, and 385◦C and again at 360◦C. The
catalytic deactivation step was performed under nitrogen flow at 450◦C for 3 h. And
again, the experimental points at 385◦C and 360◦C were evaluated.
The load and the liquid phase of the reactor effluent were analyzed by gas chro-
matography and were identified at least for the following compounds: cyclohexane
and carbon chains of up to C7 (nonaromatic), styrene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
meta-, ortho-, and para-xylenes.
The tests were performed using a specific load industry. The results of load
composition and products at 360◦C for the three catalysts are shown in Table 25.7.
For Pt1 and Pt2 catalysts, a large decrease in the products of xylenes at 360◦C was
observed, which were converted into lighter compounds (nonaromatic). The catalyst
Pt3, although it has the highest percentage of ethylbenzene in product composition,
did not show significant change in the stream of xylenes.
25.3.3.5
Activity
The determination of the activity of three platinum catalysts in the isomerization reac-
tion of xylenes was by converting ethylbenzene. As well as the formation of o-xylene,
benzene and nonaromatic and m-xylene the same procedure was used:

These results show that o-xylene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature
for all the catalysts. The selectivity was significantly higher in the presence of the Pt3
catalyst at low temperatures, although at a lower conversion.
The results showed that the Pt3 catalyst had the lowest activity when compared
to the conversion of ethylbenzene and better performance for the selectivity of o-
xylene, further lower formation of nonaromatic compounds. It was observed that this
catalyst remained away from the equilibrium conversion when compared to other cat-
alysts tested; it also showed increased coke formation for samples that have undergone
deactivation forced.
The Pt1 and Pt2 catalysts presented a similar behavior of activity and selectiv-
ity; they are more active in the conversion of ethylbenzene and less selective for the
formation of o-xylene with high formation of nonaromatic in conversions near to
equilibrium.
Under the conditions of this example, the Pt1 catalyst showed to be more resistant
to deactivation processes, maintaining a reasonable selectivity for o-xylene.
