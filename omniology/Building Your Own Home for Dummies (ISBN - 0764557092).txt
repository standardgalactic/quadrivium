services. In addition Kevin wants to thank all the clients, builders, and archi-
tects that shared their experiences.
The authors also want to thank the following people for giving time, energy,

team at Tecta Architects in San Francisco shared their knowledge and draw-
ings for many chapters. Dan Ridings of Stonehenge Builders in Lafayette,
Calif., spent hours of time providing technical information. Thanks go to The
Original Lincoln Logs LTD., John Stetson, and Aaron Rosenbaum for their con-
tributions of photos and Lorin George of Lorelco appraisals for her appraisal
contribution. Thanks to Bud Davis of B. Davis construction for the special

Introduction
A
s you read this book, you most likely have the seed of a dream taking
root in your mind. Your current home isn’t all it could be. You’ve been
daydreaming about a different place — one with more land, one by the water,
or one with a gourmet kitchen. You’ve trolled the open houses in your area,
but none of the homes really light your fire or seem to fit your lifestyle or
your family. You want something that feels more like you.
The only way to get a perfect house “fit” is to design it specifically for you. No
matter if your new home is a month away from completion or ten years down
the road, you need this book.
In our work, we’ve seen plenty of people like you tackle the process of build-
ing a custom home. For some, the process is challenging, but enjoyable. For
others, a custom home project becomes a nightmare that leaves them short
on cash and long on anxiety. We understand the process and what it takes to
move through it with as little stress as possible. In the pages that follow, we
provide you with the very best advice our many years of experience have to
offer.
No matter if your dream consists of a simple $150,000 house in the Midwest
or a multi-million-dollar mansion in California, Building Your Own Home For
Dummies is for you. This book can help you turn your dream of a custom
home into reality without losing your shirt or your sanity. With this book and
with some hard work and perseverance on your part, your dream of building,
owning, and living in your very own custom home can become a reality.
About This Book
Thousands of parts and hundreds of tasks go into a custom home project.
This book doesn’t tell you how to install a toilet or hang a door (other For
Dummies books cover those topics in detail), but it does tell you everything
you need to know about creating a custom home from scratch. Where do you
start? Who is responsible for what? How much will it all cost? These ques-
tions — and hundreds more — are what this book answers — and all in an
easy-to-use reference that you can take with you anywhere.

We divide each chapter into sections, and each section contains information
about some part of understanding the process of building a custom home,
such as
 A comprehensive approach to financing your home project, before,
during, and after construction
 The types of custom homes that are available — from log to timber
frame to stick-built to modular
 A view from the loan officer’s side of the desk
 A complete look at the inspection process during construction and what
the inspector(s) will be looking for
 Thorough and helpful tidbits on how to successfully build your home
and still have money left over
The great thing about this book is that you decide where to start and what to
read. It’s a reference you can jump into and out of at will. Just head to the
table of contents or the index to find the information you want.
Conventions Used in This Book
We use the following conventions throughout the text to make everything
consistent and easy to understand:
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 Bold text indicates keywords in bulleted lists or highlights the action
parts of numbered steps.
We also include spot-checks in the Part III chapters to guide you in conversa-
tions with your contractor and help you make sure the construction process
is going as planned.
What You’re Not to Read
We’ve written this book so that you can easily find and understand informa-
tion about building a custom home. Although you may be stuck on a deserted
island and have plenty of time to read every word in this book, chances are
you’re not. So, we simplify it so you can identify “skippable” material. This
2
Building Your Own Home For Dummies 

information is the stuff that, although interesting and related to the topic at
hand, isn’t essential for you to know:
 Text in sidebars: The sidebars are the shaded boxes that appear here
and there. They share fun facts, but nothing that’s essential to the suc-
cess of your project.
 Anything with a Technical Stuff icon attached: This information is
interesting, but if you skip it, your custom house won’t fall down.
 The stuff on the copyright page: No kidding. You can find nothing here
of interest unless you’re inexplicably enamored by legal language and
Library of Congress numbers.
Foolish Assumptions
We wrote this book with some thoughts about you in mind. Here’s what we
assume about you, our reader:
 You’ve been sketching custom homes on napkins or doodling floor plans
during business meetings. You’ve looked at your current home with a
critical eye and have, at least once, sighed and muttered the phrase,
“Someday. . . .”
 You’re drawn to home-improvement stores, television shows, and books.
 You’re desperately looking for a comprehensive guide that demystifies
the home-building process by focusing on the information important for
you the homeowner to know.
 You’re willing to do some soul-searching in order to get your custom
home right. You (and any significant others you may have) have decided
that the only way to get the perfect home is to start from scratch.
 You don’t live in a “money-is-no-object” world. You want to make edu-
cated financial decisions regarding the budget and long-term financing of
your custom home.
 You want to be involved with the process but you’ll rely on professionals
to help you when you need it. Professional help may come in the form of
a financial advisor or loan officer, an architect or designer, a plumber, or
a landscaper. You’re willing to assess your strengths and weaknesses
and seek help when necessary.
 We assume that you’ll hire a contractor in some capacity, as most
people do. (We do provide some small tidbits of information if you want
to be your own owner-builder, but the majority of this book focuses on
building a custom home with a contractor.)
 You have the ability to keep an open mind and consider new approaches
and information, even when they seem at odds with what you’ve always
been told about the custom home and financing processes.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into five parts. Jump in wherever you want! The follow-
ing sections explain what you’ll find where.
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 
on Custom Home Building
Get up to speed on the basics of building a custom home. In this part, you
figure out how to get your project organized and how to find property to
build on. You start to envision your home and define its style. You get to
know the role of the architect or designer and obtain an overview of the plan-
approval process.
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: 
Financing Your Custom Home
Your project won’t move from dream to reality without money. In this part,
you can find the lowdown on using debt to your advantage and the construc-
tion loan process, including inside information on qualifying for the money
you need to borrow. Read this part to understand why cash is king in getting
your new home built.
Part III: Hammers and Nails: 
The Construction Process
No, we don’t expect you to build your own house with your own two hands.
But wouldn’t having some idea what those people are doing up on your roof
or in your laundry room be nice? Find out the roles of the general contractor
and the teams of subcontractors. Follow the construction process from exca-
vation to framing to mechanical system installations to finish carpentry and
beyond and use the provided spot-checks to make sure your contractor and
subs are doing what they’re supposed to do.
Part IV: All the After Stuff
Just because the house is finished, you’re not. Now it’s time to plant and
install your landscaping and, of course, move in. Also in this part, you see
4
Building Your Own Home For Dummies 

that money is still an issue — you need to consider how to manage the
investment you’ve made in your new home. Your construction loan is closed,
but it may not be too early to consider refinancing.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Like every For Dummies book, this part includes quick resources that provide
plenty of information in an easy-to-digest fashion. Above all, this part shows
that you aren’t alone. Gain wisdom from other homeowners’ trials and errors
in the list of most common custom home mistakes and problems. Discover
the best ways to lower construction costs. Use the list of best custom home
resources to answer lingering questions or help you uncover wellsprings of
useful information. We also provide an environmentally conscious list of ways
to make your project green.
Icons Used in This Book
To make this book easier to read and simpler to use, we include some icons
in the margins that can help you find and fathom key ideas and information.
These tidbits provide expert advice to help you save time and money in the
home-building process.
This icon highlights important information to store in your brain for quick
recall at a later time.
Avoid mistakes by following the sage words of advice that appear under this
icon.
Although this information may be fascinating, it’s not necessarily critical to
your understanding the topic at hand. Feel free to skip it if you must.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
The process of building a custom home isn’t linear. Not everyone starts with
the purchase of a piece of land, for instance. Some people go to an architect
first to help them create a floor plan. Others may jump right in with both feet,
and be halfway through construction before they realize they need to borrow
money in order to finish.
So, to reflect the nonlinear process of building a custom home, this book is
decidedly nonlinear as well. We organize it so that you can dip in wherever
you want and still find complete information. If you’ve already bought land
and met with an architect, but don’t know how you’re going to pay for the
project, for instance, go to Chapter 7 to read up on financing. Not clear who
does what on the job site? Flip to Chapter 11 for information on general con-
tractors and subcontractors.
If you’re not sure where to go first, you may want to start with Part I. It gives
you all the basic information you need to understand the process of building
a custom home. From there, you can skip to sections that cover the subjects
that seem most fuzzy to you now. Rest assured that when you’ve finished that
section, you’ll have a better grip on home-building reality.

C
reating a custom home may be the biggest, most
exciting project you have ever been involved in 
(yes, even more exciting than when you figured out static
electricity in third-grade science class). As excited as you
are though, you don’t want to rush into it. In this part, we
give you a general overview of what you’re getting into.
We also show you how to get organized and help you
acquire land. Lastly, we help you decide on the type of
home to build and walk you through the design and
permit process with architects and designers.

The Custom Home Process
in a Nutshell
In This Chapter
 Getting ready for the custom home process
 Considering the finances
 Figuring out who the players are
 Understanding all the steps and time involved
M
ost people at some time in their lives desire owning a custom home.
Some people are attracted to the thought of designing and creating
something big from scratch. Others want to live in a new home that meets
their specific needs instead of a house that looks like every other home on
the block. Some people begin the custom home process by accident when
they find a piece of land that inspires them.
More than 35 percent of new homes in the United States are custom homes.
That means more than 300,000 custom homes are built every year. For each
person building a custom home, five people are in the process of designing
one. So you’re in excellent company with many people dreaming about moving
into a home designed and built just for them. Because custom homes are so
popular, tons of resources are available to help you through the process.
But, like Rome, your new home won’t be built in a day. The custom home
process is lengthy, emotional, and expensive, without much consistency to it.
Face it; custom homes require custom work and plenty of it! This work makes
building a custom home challenging, and yet that extra work is what makes
your project unique to you. You may feel overwhelmed at times, but by trust-
ing in the experience of the professionals you engage in your project and
keeping this invaluable book by your side, you can have a manageable pro-
ject that delivers the custom home you have been dreaming of.

Where Do You Start? Preparing 
to Build Your Home
Believe it or not, the custom home process really has no standard starting
place. There are some logical entry points such as finding land, but most
often people start with a designed house they’ve had in mind for a long time.
Where you start isn’t important; what is important is for you to make sure
that you have taken all the necessary steps to give yourself the best chance
for success. The following list includes some questions you need to consider
before committing time and money to this project. We discuss some of these
issues extensively in other chapters (which we reference for you here).
 Where do I want to live?
 How long do I want to live in this house?
 How will I find land? (See Chapter 3.)
 How much money do I have to spend on this project? (See Chapters 7, 8,
and 9.)
 How much extra time do I have to put into this project? (See Chapter 2.)
 How do I find the right resources to design my house? (See Chapter 4.)
 How do I find the right resources to build my house? (See Chapters 2
and 11.)
 Is my marriage/relationship strong enough to survive this process? 
(See your clergy or shrink.)
Don’t make the assumption that any one person can give you all the informa-
tion you need to prepare for this process. Contractors have one perspective
on the process, and architects may have a completely different perspective.
Do your homework and interview as many people as you can who are or who
have been involved in the process. By talking to professionals and consumers
and asking them to share their experiences, you can begin to get a clearer
picture of the process ahead.
Kevin recommends to all his clients that they get organized before beginning
the process. Sit down and assess how much time you can put aside each
week to focus on the project. Consider making a specific day each week your
day for working on custom home stuff. Also clear a space in your office or
den to be “Custom Home Central.” This way you always know where to find
what you need for your project. (You can find other organizing tips for your
project in Chapter 2.)

11
Chapter 1: The Custom Home Process in a Nutshell
Money Makes the World Go Round —
Paying for Your Home
We talk a lot about money in this book and with good reason. Custom homes
require plenty of it. Your new home will probably be the most expensive item
you have ever purchased. In fact, it may be the most expensive item you’ll
ever buy in your entire life. Custom homes cost more than production or
tract homes because the materials aren’t bought in quantities and the labor
hired includes individual craftsmen. The results are worth it, however, and
will last lifetimes.
Many people find it a challenge to get past the large checks they’re writing. If
you decide to use an architect, even the first check to the architect will prob-
ably exceed the biggest check you’ve ever written. The key to success with
money in a custom home project is putting it in the right perspective. If your
project costs $500,000, then what each piece costs isn’t important as long as
it equals $500,000 or less.
When you buy a new car, you don’t argue over how much you spent for the
alternator or the exhaust system. You look for the car to meet the price of
your overall budget. Use the same logic when buying your custom home.
Look for the best price on each item, but look at it in perspective to the
entire budget. You’ll do better on some items and worse on others, but if it
fits your finances, then you’re in good shape.
Asking yourself about affordability
Of course you have heard horror stories about custom home projects that
have gone seriously over budget. The projects go over budget for many rea-
sons, but usually the main culprit is that the potential homeowners didn’t
spend enough time determining what they could afford. Obviously, if you’re
building well below your means, then going over budget is easily rectified by
using your own cash. But running out of money is the No. 1 cause of custom
home disasters. Before you start the custom home process, you seriously
need to consider the following:
 What can you physically pay? Take stock of your cash on hand, equity
in real estate, and available cash from other resources. Make a firm deci-
sion how much money you’re willing to put toward the project. Chapter
7 can be a big help. You also need to get a rough idea of how much bor-
rowing power you have to help establish a limit for your budget when
added to your available cash. We provide tools and Kevin’s expert
financing assessments in Chapters 8 and 9.

 What can you emotionally pay? Just because you have the money and
the borrowing power doesn’t mean you really want to spend it all. Think
carefully and discuss with your spouse what your limits are for making
payments and how much liquidity (or cash) you need in the bank to help
you sleep at night when all is said and done. Make sure you take into
account tax deductions and interest earned on investments when analyz-
ing your monthly cash flow. After you have found that emotional limit,
you can design your project to fit your comfort zone.
 What is your cushion and tolerance for risk? Like we say again and
again throughout this book, building a custom home is a complex
process. You need to consider many variables beyond your control, and
then realize that the project can go over budget even if you do every-
thing right. You can certainly get good solid estimates, but ultimately
you won’t know what this home will cost until it’s finished and you total
up the receipts. Make sure you have addressed the “what if?” issues
thoroughly. Talk about how you’ll cover things financially if the market
turns sour — devaluing your property — or the cost of materials rise.
Decide what safety money (such as your 401(k) or retirement fund)
you’re willing or unwilling to tap into.
The more you talk about financial issues related to your custom home project,
the more likely you are to resolve problems before they happen. Optimism in
a custom home project can get you into trouble every time. The best approach
is to examine every possible risk and make contingency plans for every poten-
tial problem.
Them that has the gold makes the rules: If
you finance, the bank will dictate process
Most people don’t have all the money for a custom home sitting in their bank
account. Even if they did, putting it all into the project wouldn’t be a good
idea, as we explain in Chapter 7. Like it or not, you’ll probably have a finan-
cial partner in this project in the form of a construction lender or bank. The
good news is construction lenders have the same objectives you do.
 They want to make loans for custom home projects. (That’s how they
make money.)
 They want the house to be completed on time.
 They want the house to be completed on budget.
 They want the house to be completed in a workmanlike manner.
12
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

Furthermore, the following tidbits can save you some arguments and frustra-
tions when working with construction lenders:
 They don’t believe a house is worth exactly what it costs.
 A larger loan makes you a riskier borrower, not a better customer.
 You aren’t entitled to any loan.
 They aren’t required by law to loan you any money.
 They dictate how the money is handled throughout the process.
Accept the fact that if you want to use a lender’s money, you have to play by
its rules. Most of these rules weren’t made arbitrarily. They’re designed to
protect the financial viability of the project and protect the lender in the
unlikely event of a foreclosure, which is the act of taking back the home in
case you default on the payments or the construction contract. The guide-
lines and procedures are based upon statistical and anecdotal problems and
failures that occurred with the lender in the past. Unfortunately, sometimes
you pay for the sins of those before you.
Put yourself in the lender’s shoes. If you were loaning a friend 80 percent of
the money to build his home, you would want a few protections in place and
a little control over the money as well, right? If you get to know how lenders
see the project, which we explain in detail in Chapters 8 and 9, you can easily
navigate the approval process as well as the funding process (see Chapter 10).
This approach can make for a smoother, happier custom home project.
Introducing the Custom Home Life Cycle
The first step to beginning the process is looking at all the pieces and how
they go together. Your new home has a number of individual projects and
transactions necessary to complete it. Your new home also needs an army of
people with their expert work and services. This section breaks down in an
approximate order each person required to get through the process. Then we
outline each step necessary to go from land to landscaping.
It takes (more than) two to tango — 
A quick guide to the players
The following list is a guide to all the individual players involved in the
custom home process. You may or may not use them all; their roles can vary
13
Chapter 1: The Custom Home Process in a Nutshell

14
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 
depending on your region and your project’s scope. The order of need may
also change depending upon where you start in your process.
 Financial planner and/or certified public accountant (CPA): If possible,
start the custom home process by carefully assessing your finances; a
financial planner or CPA can help make sure you can afford this project.
 Real estate agent: You may need a real estate agent to help you find and
purchase a lot, as we discuss in Chapter 3. She also plays a role when it’s
time to sell your existing home.
 Loan officer: Your loan officer needs to be involved throughout the entire
process. You may need to start with a refinance or credit line to get liquid,
as we discuss in Chapter 7. You want to finance the land (see Chapter 3)
and do it consistent with the construction financing (see Chapters 8 and
9). Finally, you still may need another refinance after the project (see
Chapter 16). Your loan office can help you through these steps. Lucky
for you, Chapter 8 has good advice on picking the right loan officer.
 Developer or landowner: The land you buy has to come from some-
where. If you’re buying in a subdivision from a developer, you may deal
with a sales office. Or you may end up buying from a landowner that has
had the property for generations.
 Escrow officer or attorney: Your state determines who administers the
closing of your escrow, but either way, this person makes sure the title
papers and insurance are all ready for you to take ownership.
 Architect and/or designer: Architects and designers design and draft
plans for the house. Architects are licensed; they’ll coordinate technical
specifications for the house that may be beyond the scope of a designer.
The architect can also guide you through the permitting process. (Chapter
5 can help you decide if you need an architect, and Chapter 6 provides
the ins and outs of the permitting process.)
 Log or timber frame dealer: If you’re building a kit home (see Chapter 4),
you’ll work with your dealer for the design process as well as the pur-
chase of your materials package.
 Contractor/builder: You need to decide whether you need this person
or if you’ll rely on yourself to drive the construction of your new home
(see the “Being an Owner-Builder: More Power to You!” section, later in
this chapter, if you may want to be your own owner-builder). We give
you tools for working with your contractor in Chapter 11.
 Surveyor: This person makes sure you know where your land begins
and ends — a necessity for designing the house.
 Soils engineer: In many states, such as California, your foundation
depends upon the report issued by this person.
 Well/septic engineer: If you’re building in a rural area, you need this
person to design and certify your water and sewage systems.

15
Chapter 1: The Custom Home Process in a Nutshell
 Planning department: Your house needs to meet your neighborhood’s
zoning requirements before you get permits. This department enforces
the zoning. (See Chapter 6 for details.)
 Design review committee: You can’t always build what you want. This
committee dictates what it wants to see in your design. (Look in Chapter
6 for more information.)
 Building department: Everything must meet code, and this department
checks your plans before issuing permits. (See Chapter 6.)
 Appraiser: The lender won’t approve a construction loan without an
appraisal estimating the finished value. (Check out Chapter 9 for more
information.)
 Insurance agent: Chapter 2 spells out all the insurance you need for the
project. This person provides the goods — he’ll be busy.
 Material suppliers: Sticks and stones all have to come from somewhere.
Some projects have many sources. (See Chapter 11.)
 Subcontractors: Each one is an expert . . . just ask them. Artisans and
craftspeople build each different system in your house. Chapter 11 tells
you how to work with them. Chapters 12, 13, and 14 explain what they do.
 Laborers: Somebody has to do the grunt work on the job. These guys
and gals work the hardest and get paid the least.
 Building inspectors: The building department checks up at various
stages of construction to see that you’re building in line with regula-
tions. (Look in Chapter 11 for more details.)
 Disbursement agents: The lender assigns someone to make sure you get
money when you need it or to solve problems with getting money from
the lender. (You can find more on these agents in Chapter 10.)
 Bank inspectors: The bank won’t give you money unless work has been
done. These people come out to the property monthly or at various
stages to make sure the work is complete. (Chapter 11 has more.)
 Landscaper: Usually the last part to go in but sometimes the landscaper
designs the landscaping at the beginning. This person makes the yard
green with your green. (Check out Chapter 17 for more info.)
 Mover: After all this work and trouble, the last thing you want to do is
make 20 trips with the minivan. Let the movers do the work for you.
(Turn to Chapter 15 for specifics.)
 Decorator: If you have any money left at the end, you’ll have plenty of
furnishings to spend it on. An interior decorator can help.
Although your architect or contractor may manage some of these relation-
ships, ultimately you’ll need to coordinate all these people in order to com-
plete the project. You’re going to meet many new people in this process, so
put on your best smile and get ready to shake a lot of hands.

So many tasks, so little time — 
50 steps to a custom home
You’re probably wondering why the custom home process has so many
people involved. The simple answer: A custom home process has tons of
tasks that need to be done. Although each home-building process may have
some variation in the stages based upon factors such as location and
weather, for the most part, the process moves in a step-by-step fashion.
The following list shows how a typical custom home process moves forward.
The chapter references direct you to detailed discussions later in the book.

Patience is a virtue — A true timeline 
for building your home
Asking how long it takes to build a custom home from start to finish is a bit
like asking the question “How long is a piece of string?” The obvious answer
of course is “It depends.” So many factors can affect the time frame that the
overall project can stretch from six months to six years. Kevin often has clients
who come to his office asking if they can move in by Christmas, to which he
always responds, “Absolutely, as long as you don’t care which year!”
Over the years we’ve seen patterns for the time it takes to complete each
phase. The main point is to be flexible. You want to have a house you love for
the rest of your life rather than years of regret because you rushed everything.
Here are some typical rough timelines for the process based on Kevin’s 20
years’ of experience.
 Land acquisition: This step depends upon the availability of land in the
area you desire. Land is hard to find, so pinpointing the exact time is diffi-
cult. Most of Kevin’s clients look for land for three to nine months before
finding something they like. Purchasing the land, including the escrow and
due diligence periods, can take anywhere from 30 days to six months.

19
Chapter 1: The Custom Home Process in a Nutshell
 Home design and approval process: This stage mostly depends on how
picky you are and your financing considerations. Local government effi-
ciencies can play a factor as well. Figure at least three months. The
design and approval process requires that everything goes perfectly and
you can quickly make your choices. Kevin has projects that have taken
more than two years to get through this phase.
 Construction: This stage covers the project’s scope and the availability of
labor. You can use the construction lenders as a guide. Most lenders pro-
vide 12-month construction loans. Smaller houses or kit homes (homes
where all materials are supplied as a kit, such as log homes) may go up in
six to nine months. Large detailed mansions may need 18 months.
 Landscaping and move in: This one is all up to you. After the house is
complete, you can relax, although you may be required to finish land-
scaping in some neighborhoods within a year of completion. Most finish
within six months.
Being an Owner-Builder: 
More Power to You!
When you talk about building a custom home, people often assume you’re
planning on pounding hammers and nails yourself. Hardly anyone does the
actual construction on their own custom home project. Many people, how-
ever, do consider acting as their own general contractor. Still, doing so is
such a large undertaking that only about 20 percent of all custom homes are
managed by owner-builders. In many of these cases, the owner is a contractor
or already has some amount of construction experience. This factor isn’t nec-
essary, but it can make a big difference in the ultimate success of the project.
Even though the primary motivation for considering becoming an owner-
builder may be saving money, the real issues to consider are time and man-
agement experience. This project will be one of the largest undertakings of
your life, even with a contractor. Consider the following questions in explor-
ing the owner-builder subject:
 How is my security at my current job?
 Do I have extra time and a flexible schedule?
 Can I make more money at my job with the time I spend on the home?
 Do I have a good understanding of the construction process?
 Do I have extra time to train myself on the process?
 Am I good at managing people and projects?
 Do I have a good eye for quality of construction?

20
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 
 Do I have access to good resources?
 Am I good at problem solving?
 Am I good with multitasking and constant change?
 Am I well organized?
 Am I good at managing finances and budgets?
 Will my spouse and kids stay with me if I mess up the project?
If you honestly answered no to any of these questions, then you probably
need to hire a contractor (see Chapters 2 and 11). Most owner-builders are
gambling that they can do a job equal to or better than an experienced,
licensed contractor, thereby saving the cost of that contractor. Although an
owner-builder may end up saving money, you need to weigh the risk of that
gamble against the money you might save. If you’re wrong, it could cost you
far more money than you planned to save in the first place.
One option if your answers were somewhat mixed is to hire an owner-builder
consultant. One company called Ubuildit (www.ubuildit.com) offers expert
consulting and procedures to guide you through the construction manage-
ment process. The company charges you consulting fees and offers you prod-
ucts and services that are marked up, but the costs can be significantly less
than a contractor’s fees. Ubuildit is a good alternative for saving money and
shortening the learning curve; however, you still need to have the time and
the management skills to make for a successful project.
Analyzing the truth about savings
The biggest motivation for being an owner-builder is the supposed savings.
Ordinarily, a contractor makes money from charging a percentage on top of
the cost of labor and materials used in the project; this fee or markup can be
anywhere from 12 to 35 percent depending upon what and where you’re
building. Generally, more established contractors work on higher margins
where younger contractors with less experience may work for less.
Where materials are concerned, the discount suppliers such as Home Depot
have made construction supplies available to the consumer at contractor
prices, which can be real savings if you’re satisfied with the selection avail-
able at these stores. If you’re building with more elaborate materials and fix-
tures, the contractor may have access to wholesale pricing that allows him to
make some money without you having to pay more. In some cases he may be
working on a lower margin and may be able to save you some money on
items with a high retail markup.

21
Chapter 1: The Custom Home Process in a Nutshell
With labor, you’ll be subject to the prices and availability of the subcontrac-
tors in the marketplace. If the market is busy, pricing will reflect a direct
supply-and-demand relationship, pushing prices up. If you have no preexist-
ing relationships with any subs, you’ll end up paying the full price for their
time. If they’re unable to work into your schedule, you may have other costs
that come from delays on your project while waiting for the subs to become
available.
Finding and managing subs
Hiring and managing subs is the hardest part of being an owner-builder.
Meanwhile, a contractor has the advantage of having long-term regular rela-
tionships with subs. An experienced contractor has spent years finding
framers, plumbers, carpenters, and others whom he trusts to be timely, effi-
cient, and good craftsmen. If they’ve worked together for a long time, they
know how to work together, and the contractor will know when to ask for
favors.
Hiring each sub is a new experience in negotiation, management, and quality
control. Overcommunicate with everyone on the job to keep it running
smoothly. Keep your eyes open. You probably won’t know if you picked the
right sub until she is finished and she has been paid. (Check out Chapter 11
for more information about working with subs.)
Financing implications
One other challenge with being an owner-builder is the financing. Most con-
ventional construction lenders frown on owner-builder projects. They have
three basic reasons for being concerned:
 The bank is afraid the project might not be managed effectively causing
it to exceed the allotted time frame and budget.
 The bank wants to be sure your job and income won’t be negatively
impacted by the time demands of this project.
 In case of foreclosure, the bank doesn’t want to have to find and hire a
contractor to finish the home.
For these reasons, many banks who lend to owner-builders do so with stricter
requirements than for regular construction loans, such as loaning less money
relative to appraised value or requiring full income documentation. Others

22
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 
allow owner-builder financing only if you’re a general contractor, or at the
very least they require someone with construction experience as a site super-
visor. Private sources for owner-builder construction loans are available, but
they can be expensive and don’t generally have permanent loans attached
like the single-close loans we recommend in Chapter 8.

A
ny time you undertake a multistepped project, you have a greater risk
of something going out of control. The good news is that you can pre-
pare yourself for the chaos and craziness that is bound to happen in your
construction project.
In this chapter, we help you set up some simple systems for managing the
people and tasks involved in the custom home process. We walk you through
a short analysis of your finances so you can create a budget. We take you
through the decision process of selecting a contractor and also help you to
understand your insurance needs for the project. Finally, we provide you with
several tips on how to keep the project a happy experience.
Organizing and Documenting
The custom home process is chock-full of enough paperwork and procedures
guaranteed to give bureaucrats chills. Now is the time to be honest with your-
self. Are you truly an organized person? If so, this section is simply a series of
reminders and ideas for you to embrace. If not, don’t get intimidated by the
challenges ahead of you. Find someone in your family who is organized or
even hire someone to help you prepare for the large organizing task ahead.
One good resource is the National Association of Professional Organizers at
www.napo.net. You can also check out Wiley’s Organizing For Dummies by
Eileen Roth and Elizabeth Miles.

Building a workbook and 
portable file system
To start with a difficult project like you’re thinking of undertaking, you need a
central place to store all the original paperwork you’re about to accumulate.
Because each transaction creates its own set of paperwork, you want to get
organized or else you’ll end up drowning in all that paper. A typical construc-
tion project usually generates enough paperwork to fill a two-drawer file cabi-
net. You not only need to store all this paperwork, but you’ll also need to
easily retrieve it throughout the process. Use the following suggestions for
setting up categories for your filing system:
 Architecture and design
 Contractor communication
 Contracts
 Financing
 Invoices
 Land purchase
 Materials information
 Paid receipts
 Permits and approvals
 Subcontractor communication
 Warrantees
Many people start out with a single notebook and find out it fills up very
quickly. We recommend using a permanent and portable system instead.
Utilize the following efficient, step-by-step method for having pertinent infor-
mation at your fingertips whether you’re at home, in your office, or at your
construction site:
1. Create a loose-leaf binder with dividers for the categories in the previ-
ous bulleted list.
2. Decide after looking at each document whether you may need it at the
site. If so, make a copy.
3. File one copy in your file system at home.
4. Place the other copy in your binder in the corresponding category to
the home file system.
5. Review your binder each day, adding the necessary documents from
your file system.
24
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

More and more people in the construction industry are using e-mail for com-
munication. People collaborating on your project can easily pass along and
share invoices, designs, pictures, and memos via e-mail. The great thing
about e-mails is that they’re easy to store without taking up any space in your
file cabinet. If you use Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Notes, you can set up dif-
ferent folders for all the subjects and people you communicate with. This
way you can easily reference prior communication and share it if needed. If
you don’t currently use e-mail, take the time now to figure it out. Doing so can
make your custom home project run more smoothly. (Check out Outlook 2003
For Dummies by Bill Dyszel, published by Wiley, for help setting up and figur-
ing out how to e-mail.)
Calendar and communication — 
Your PDA is your friend
Keeping your project on schedule is a major project in itself. You and your
contractor need to coordinate all the actions in a construction project. For
example, your electrical systems can’t be installed until the framing is com-
plete, and the house can’t be framed until the foundation is installed. With 
so many people dependent upon the time frame of others, you need a simple
way to keep track of everything, even if your contractor is managing the
schedule.
Proactive communication is probably the single most important factor for a
successful custom home. Make yourself easily available with a mobile phone
so your contractor or architect can reach you when she needs you. Be pre-
pared to respond to messages promptly (otherwise, if your crew runs into 
a snag, the project could sit in limbo while your contractor waits for you to
check in and return messages — costing you time and money). If you’re a
recluse or shy when it comes to dealing with people, you may need to adjust
your lifestyle and contact-management approach until your project is 
completed.
Staying in close contact requires you have immediate portable access to
phone numbers for your contractor, architect, loan officer, and other key
players. For those of you electronically minded, you can utilize great techno
tools to help you. A personal digital assistant (PDA) is a small handheld com-
puter that can store all your phone numbers as well as your calendar. PDAs
cost from $100 to $500 and can transfer information back and forth from your
computer, which helps if you’re communicating by e-mail or managing your
calendar electronically. Both Palm (www.palm.com) and Microsoft (www.
microsoft.com) make software that is compatible with most computers. You
can take time to figure out how to use these devices by reading Wiley’s Palm
For Dummies, 2nd edition, by Bill Dyszel, or Pocket PC For Dummies, 2nd edi-
tion, by Brian Underdahl.
25
Chapter 2: Preparing for the Process

A number of phones are also available today that combine the functions of
PDAs with a fully functional mobile telephone. They’re pricier and bulkier
than regular mobile phones, but they allow you to combine the functions of
two units. Check with your local cellular phone provider for details.
If electronics aren’t your thing, we highly recommend a Franklin Planner from
www.franklincovey.com. They come in many sizes that can also serve as
your planning notebook. You can keep all your contact information, as well 
as your calendar, with a pencil and have it ready whenever you need it. And 
if you use a planner, your batteries will never go dead because — unlike 
PDAs and other portable electronic devices — planners don’t use batteries!
Being the bean counter — Keeping 
track of your finances
Even though you may have a contractor and bank involved, ultimately, the
job of managing the finances falls on you. You need to keep track of every
dollar spent as you go, or you could have a very unpleasant surprise — run-
ning out of money in the middle of the project.
We recommend setting up a separate bank account early on for everything
construction related. Setting up this account can help remove confusion and
allow for easier record keeping. Keeping a file for each vendor and tacking
down invoices and receipts in chronological order also makes life easier
when looking for something later. Loose papers become a nightmare when
you need something quickly. (See the “Building a workbook and portable file
system” section earlier in this chapter for specific tips on keeping the files
organized.)
Managing the finances is an easier task (just like keeping your schedule orga-
nized) if you’re computer literate. You could manage your finances with a
simple bookkeeping ledger book, but you can keep track of money in and
money out in all the different categories of the build smoothly and efficiently
with the help of an accounting software program such as QuickBooks by
Intuit (www.quickbooks.com). QuickBooks offers a special construction ver-
sion designed for contractors that can serve your needs well. The version is a
little pricey at a few hundred dollars, but that’s a small price to pay for effec-
tive money management. Wiley’s QuickBooks For Dummies by Stephen L.
Nelson can guide you through the software quite nicely.

Shopping and sharing — Collecting 
material information
The biggest assignment you have in this project is . . . to go shopping! You
need to choose hundreds of items for this house, and the sooner you start
saving pictures and catalogs the better. (We provide a basic list of choices 
to be made in Chapter 5.) Magazines, catalogs, and the Internet are your 
best bet for finding hardware and fixtures.
Electronic storage of pictures makes for easier communication with your
architect and contractor. A scanner can be a useful tool for cataloguing pic-
tures from magazines to store on your computer. Then you can e-mail the
scanned images to your architect and contractor or burn the images to a 
CD and share the disc with them.
Budgeting Your Project
A budget for a custom home project is a living breathing animal. It will grow
and shrink many times before the house is finished. Okay, it usually grows
more than it shrinks, but the point is that it changes — a lot! You do have to
start somewhere. This section can help you create a preliminary budget to
get started. (We also provide more specific budgeting help in Chapter 9
where we explain how a lender budgets your project. If you’re financing this
project through a lender, then the lender’s budget takes precedence over
yours, so you need to get the two in line as soon as possible.)
Budgeting at the beginning of the custom home process is a bit of a chicken-
and-egg process. You have to balance out the cost of the house with what you
can afford. The problem is that the house may require more money than you
have, which you can’t figure out until you design the house and so on. The
best method is to evaluate the two issues separately and then work to a 
compromise.
Looking at your finances and cash flow
Chances are your lender will heavily influence your budget by determining 
an amount to lend you. But just because the lender says you can afford a mil-
lion dollars doesn’t mean you’re comfortable spending that much money or
making those payments. The best way to create a budget you can live with 
is to work with your certified public accountant (CPA), financial advisor, and
27
Chapter 2: Preparing for the Process

loan officer to assess how all factors will impact your finances. Make sure you
discuss and take into account the following:
 Cash on hand
 Capital gains issues
 Current tax bracket
 Diversification of assets
 Intended length of time owning the home
 Long-term investment strategy
 Property appreciation
 Tax deductions for interest and points
Armed with this information, you need to arrive at a comfortable payment
that a loan officer or loan calculator can translate into a loan amount. You
can find a variety of these calculators at www.mortgage-calc.com.
The mortgage information set out by these calculation sites is basic informa-
tion and doesn’t totally apply to construction loan qualification. These sites
can give you a rough estimate to work within preliminary stages, but you
need to speak to a loan officer that is a qualified construction loan specialist
to be assured you meet construction loan qualification. (You can find specific
information for construction loan underwriting and for finding a loan officer
in Chapters 8 and 9.)
After you have a loan amount, you need to account for the cash available. As
we discuss in Chapter 7, you need a good amount of cash to run this project.
You may not want to spend it all, but cash is your surest way of keeping a
custom home project running smoothly. Don’t forget to include money you
can take out of your existing house through a credit line or refinance. After
you have decided how much of your cash you want to spend without being
reimbursed by the construction loan on your project, add it to your loan
amount estimate for the total estimate of your custom home budget.
Just because you can afford a large budget doesn’t mean that the property
will support the amount you want to spend. Many other factors can impact
your budget later in the process, such as requirements of your property and
sales in your neighborhood. (We discuss these elements extensively in
Chapters 3 and 5.)
Defining “dollars per square foot”
Many different people use the “dollars per square foot” term many different
times during your home-building process. Interestingly enough, however, no
one uses a specific widely accepted definition. A real estate agent may state
28
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

dollars per square foot as the sales price of the home divided by the square
footage, including the land. A contractor may or may not include items such
as permits or financing in his estimates of dollars per square foot. After you
have bids, the term actually becomes meaningless, but during the early
stages of your project, you need a common understanding of what it means.
To decipher your dollars per square foot quotes, you have to define dollars
and square foot the same way for each person you work with. Then you can
make sure everyone is on the same page in every relevant conversation. The
following sections outline the approach Kevin takes with his clients.
Step 1: Define square footage
First, create a definition for “square foot.” Square footage for this purpose
needs to include all living space enclosed by walls that is completely fin-
ished. Your definition of square footage needs to include the square footage
for the following:
 Bathrooms
 Bedrooms/closets
 Den
 Dining room
 Family and great room
 Fully finished basement
 Guesthouse
 Hallways and entryways
 Home theater and/or game room
 Kitchen/laundry room/pantry
Add the square footage together, and this total serves as your definition of
the total square footage. However, your definition of square footage doesn’t
include square footage for the following:
 Attached decks
 Garage
 Patios
 Unfinished basement
 Workshop buildings
Step 2: Define dollars
Now that you have a total square footage number, you need to define the dol-
lars necessary in the budget to define dollars per square foot. You don’t want
29
Chapter 2: Preparing for the Process

to include all the construction costs in this dollar amount; many costs need
to be evaluated independently. The following are the costs that Kevin
excludes from this part of the calculation:
 Financing
 Hardscaping (unattached decks, pools, fences, and so on)
 Land
 Landscaping
 Soft costs (permits, plans, and fees)
So what’s included in your definition of the dollars? Mostly labor and materi-
als construction costs for all the living space we mention in the “Step 1:
Define square footage” section are included plus a few other construction
costs such as the cost of
 Attached decks and patios
 Driveways
 The garage
 Unfinished basement space
 Walkways
Take all your cost estimates and add them together to create a total dollars
number.
Step 3: Calculating dollars per square foot
As soon as you establish the total dollars number, divide the total dollars
from Step 2 by the square footage number from Step 1 to establish your dol-
lars per square foot. Easy, huh?
Alternatively, you can take your total dollars construction budget minus 
the excluded items from Step 2 and divide by the square footage number 
to determine how much per square foot you have available to spend. 
For example, if you have a budget of $350,000 for total dollars available and
your square footage is 2,500 square feet, your budget would be $140 per
square foot. You could then tell a contractor that you can only spend $140
per square foot for construction of the house not including land, soft costs,
financing, hardscaping, and landscaping, but that price must include the
garage, driveways, walkways, attached decks, and any unfinished space.
30

Using a budgeting template
To put all this information together, Kevin’s company, Stratford Financial, sug-
gests a little template to make everything easier. You need to do your own
research to fill in the spaces for your project, but the following is a sample
preliminary budget for a typical custom home project that you can scratch
out on any napkin.
Funds available
Add your available cash and the loan amount for your total budget.
Cash
$175,000
Loan amount
$650,000
Total budget
$825,000
Cost-to-build
Add all your costs together for your total cost.
Land
$200,000
Soft costs (permits 
$40,000
plans and fees)
Hard costs 
$424,000
($160 per 2,650 Sq. Ft.)
Financing
$35,000
Landscaping
$40,000
Hardscaping
$25,000
Total Cost
$764,000
This template can give you a starting point for budgeting, but you do need to
educate yourself on each of these line items to get a real picture of your pro-
ject’s costs. (Check out the table of contents to see where we discuss each
topic for more information.)

Chapter 2: Preparing for the Process

Hiring a Contractor
Most people building a custom home end up hiring a general contractor to 
do the job. In fact, 80 percent of custom home projects have a general con-
tractor involved in some capacity. Many people find great comfort in having
someone with experience manage the job while they earn the money to pay
for the project. If you’re considering being an owner-builder and not using a
contractor, check out Chapter 1 to see if you’re truly up to the task.
Every contractor has a standard contract and practices she uses with her
business. Remember that you have the right to negotiate and compromise on
issues before entering into any contract. Of course, the contractor also has
the right to decline the job.
There is no set time to engage your contractor as long as it’s a minimum of 
60 days before you start construction so she has time to get everything ready
for the build. Many people opt to engage a contractor much earlier in the
process so that the contractor is actively involved during the design process.
After you and your contractor establish a contract and you’re on your way,
you and the contractor need to work as a team to build your custom home. In
this section, we look at the contractor selection process. (You can find more
information on managing your contractor relationship in Chapter 11.)
Understanding the contractor’s role
In most cases, the contractor doesn’t handle the hammer-and-nail part of
your custom home project. Although some contractors may participate in
parts of the actual construction, his primary job is to manage the workflow
and project materials and make sure everything is happening in a timely and
workmanship-type manner. The following list includes your contractor’s
major responsibilities:
 Obtain the final permits
 Manage the production schedule
 Source and buy the materials
 Hire and manage the subs
 Keep the site safe and clean
 Manage the inspections
 Manage the budget
32
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

 Keep the consumer informed
 Effect quality control
 Problem solve
Not every contractor will handle all these items. When you hire your contrac-
tor, discuss with her how much you’ll handle yourself directly and what she’ll
handle. Good communication is the key to making sure that you don’t waste
any time or effort doubling up on tasks.
Getting bids — Comparing 
apples to apples
If you didn’t start the custom home process with a contractor in mind, you’ll
probably give your plans and specifications or specs to a few different contrac-
tors to get an estimate. This process is called putting your plans out to bid. 
Finding contractors to bid on your project is as easy as asking friends and
your architect for referrals. If they aren’t providing names, you can drive
through the neighborhood and look for construction signs on houses being
built. The Internet is also a good resource. Simply type the name of your city
and the word “contractor” into a search engine such as Yahoo! or Google.
Dozens of referral sites pop up for you. If the building market is busy, you
may have to work a little harder to find contractors who can bid in your time
frame. You want at least three contractors to bid on your project if possible.
The trick is making sure you can compare the bids to each other.
The best way to compare the bids is by making sure your plans are as com-
plete as possible. In Chapter 5, we discuss doing all your design work and
material selection before the bid process. This extra work can delay your pro-
ject early on but is crucial for comparing truly accurate bids. For example,
you want to compare prices on the same kitchen sink model numbers to see
which contractor is charging a higher profit margin. Also, make sure the con-
tractor has included his fees in his estimate. He may or may not break out his
margin as a separate line item, but you need to know there won’t be any sur-
prise additions to the costs down the line.
Many contractors substitute an allowance for unspecified materials. So, for
example, if you haven’t picked your bathroom fixtures, one contractor may
offer you a $10,000 allowance. This amount may seem cheaper than a different
contractor’s $15,000 estimate, but you have no way of knowing if the quality 
is comparable or who is taking a higher margin. Also, availability and the diffi-
culty of installing certain materials can impact the time and, subsequently, the
33
Chapter 2: Preparing for the Process

cost of the project. The surest way to make sure that all bids are assuming the
same materials and labor necessary is to specify all the materials required for
the project before you put the plans and specs out to bid. Having all these
decisions clearly made in the beginning helps to avoid ugly misunderstand-
ings and surprises later in the project.
Evaluating a contractor’s 3 Cs — Cost,
craftsmanship, and compatibility
Do you want a quick and easy guide to help you pick the right contractor?
(Yes, of course you do, because you’re reading a For Dummies book.) Kevin
has been advising his clients for years to make their choice by examining the
3 Cs: Cost, craftsmanship, and compatibility.
 Cost: This one is obvious and, although important, it probably weighs
the least in your decision for picking a contractor. The cost comparison
becomes plain when the contractors return the bids. If you have handed
them complete, detailed plans and specs, you need a clear picture who
is working on the lowest margin or who has access to the lowest cost
labor and materials.
 Craftsmanship: This part is important in the long term. You want to
know that the house is built well and will offer you decades of enjoyable
living. Don’t confuse style and design with craftsmanship. A house can
have a horrible floor plan with fantastic artisan work.
What’s the best way to check on work quality? Look at other houses that
the contractors built. Ask the contractor for a complete address list of
homes he has built in addition to a list of references. Make sure you look
at houses built ten years ago as well as newer ones. Remember, just as a
car with 50,000 miles drives much differently than a new one, an older
home lives much differently than a new one. Don’t forget to talk to the
people living in the houses to find out what problems, if any, they have
experienced with their homes. Don’t be afraid to knock on the door of
homes built by the contractor that weren’t on the reference list.
Also, don’t forget to ask the contractor about his workmanship warran-
tees. Warrantees usually last for ten years, but can vary. See Chapter 15
for more on contractor warrantees.
 Compatibility: This “C” is the most important aspect to consider, and
yet the most difficult to identify. The hard part is first assessing who you
are so you can pick the contractor that will work best with your style.
For example, if you’re a micromanager that plans on being involved in
every aspect of the project, then you’ll constantly butt heads with a con-
tractor that also likes to micromanage his projects. You need a more
relaxed contractor willing to let you make the decisions or second-guess
his work. On the other hand, if you don’t have the time to be involved in
34
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

the management, then someone with a relaxed attitude probably won’t
give you the sense of security you need — particularly if he is waiting for
you every day to make decisions. Figure out what sort of experience is
going to make you happiest and find the contractor that can meet your
needs. 
References from people you know are great, but people have different tastes
and perspectives on quality and experience. Ask specific, open-ended ques-
tions about the experience that can paint you a clear picture of the contrac-
tor’s personality. Just hearing that “It was a good experience” doesn’t tell you
much without knowing the reasons why.
Using expert interviewing techniques
If you haven’t hired project managers before, then hiring a contractor will be
a completely new experience for you. Generally, the contractor is trying to
sell you on himself for the job because that is his business. At the same time,
you’re trying to sell the contractor into taking your project because the price
is right and you like his work or maybe the market is really busy right now.
With everyone so anxious to get going, the important issues, such as compat-
ibility, can get passed over — leading to tense problems and unmet expecta-
tions later in the project. You need to make sure you not only ask the right
questions, but also use effective methods to get the answers you want. The
following list includes some tried-and-true interviewing techniques that are
guaranteed to help you find the best contractor for your job:
 Let the contractor do the talking. If you’re doing more than 25 percent
of the talking, then you’re the one being interviewed. Let the contractor
explain to you why he wants this job. Have a standard list of questions
for each interview that allows the contractor to tell you what he’s like to
work with and what services he provides. (We provide just such a list on
the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book.)
 Let the contractor tell you what he wants. If you ask “yes-or-no” ques-
tions about his style and needs, he’ll surely try to answer based on what
he thinks you’re looking for. Instead, ask him open-ended questions about
his ideal project and the worst project he has ever had. Delve into details
about his likes and dislikes. You’ll be working with him for at least six
months on this project, and nothing is worse than an unhappy contractor.
 Give him problem scenarios. Anyone can run a project that goes per-
fectly smooth all the time. You want to know how he deals with problem
situations. Create stories of nightmare situations and ask him how he
would handle them. For example, what if the framer and the plumber get
into an argument, and one walks off the job before the job is finished? If
he quakes in his boots with the questions, you’ll know he doesn’t have
the strength to manage your project.
35
Chapter 2: Preparing for the Process

This project is your home, and your lifesavings are at stake. Compromise is
okay to a point, but you need to have a good building experience to enjoy
your home fully when you finally move in. Don’t assume that contractors are
all the same. Pick the one that makes you feel comfortable and secure and
then communicate, communicate, communicate.
Identifying Insurance Issues
If you arrange outside financing for your project, the lender requires insur-
ance to cover several issues, including at minimum
 Liability
 Workers’ compensation
 Course of construction
Even if you finance the project 100 percent out of your own pocket, you still
want to protect yourself. This section outlines the different insurance poli-
cies necessary to protect your project and yourself. Don’t wait to discuss
these policies with your insurance agent. Not all carriers have these policies
available, so you may need extra time to find a carrier and shop for the best
price.
Liability policy
Lenders require liability insurance, which protects you against someone get-
ting hurt on the property or by the actions of somebody working on the prop-
erty, to be carried by either you or the contractor. If the contractor carries
the policy, the policy needs to meet the following criteria to satisfy most
lenders:
 It must be in the form of a comprehensive general policy for $1 million
or the loan amount, whichever is greater, or be a policy including broad-
form liability endorsement.
 The contractor must be named as the insured.
 You and the lender must be named as additional insured.
 The property address must be included on the certificate.
You may want to carry this policy yourself because in some states it can be
expensive for a contractor to get a liability policy if he doesn’t already have
36
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

one. If you carry the policy, the cost will be added to your budget and consid-
ered for financing as discussed in Chapter 8. Note that policies vary in cost
by state and the size of your home. If you’re carrying the policy or are an
owner-builder, then you can get the liability policy with a few changes:
 The contractor doesn’t need to be named.
 You’re named as the insured.
 The amounts change to $500,000 for each occurrence, extended to both
property and personal injury or the loan amount, whichever is greater.
Workers’ compensation
Ordinarily, the contractor carries a workers’ compensation policy if she has
employees. You can ask to see the certificate because the lender will as well. 
In many cases, however, the contractor doesn’t have her own employees and
hires her labor and subs as independent contractors. If so, then these indepen-
dent contractors fall under your liability policy in case of an accident. Lenders
usually allow for this situation by having you and the contractor sign a waiver
so the lender isn’t held liable for any workers’ compensation violations.
Course of construction policy
This policy protects you in case of theft, fire, weather, or other damage to the
house while it’s being built. So if, for example, your plumber drops his torch
and burns down the framing, this policy pays for the cost of rebuilding the
house to its previous condition before the damage. Lenders absolutely require
this policy to be in place before they fund loans. The cost of this policy varies
depending on your state and the size of your home. The following criteria
needs to be included in a course of construction policy:
 Coverage must be in an amount equal to the estimated replacement
value of the improvements to be built or the loan amount, whichever is
lower. Guaranteed replacement is usually acceptable instead of a spe-
cific dollar amount.
 The borrower is the named insured.
 The lender is named as the “mortgage and certificate holder.”
 There is a 438BFU Lender’s Loss Payable Endorsement naming the
lender as the “Loss Payee.”
 The property address and/or legal description is listed on the insurance
certificate.
 The maturity date on the insurance is at least one day beyond the end of
the construction loan term.

Chapter 2: Preparing for the Process

Managing Your Expectations
One of Kevin’s favorite contractors earned the “favorite” title because he is
the biggest pessimist around. The problem with being optimistic with a con-
struction project is that you’re constantly disappointed. Materials don’t show
up on time or the sub takes longer than you thought to finish; you name it, it
probably will happen. A custom home project is a journey with a life of its
own. You can follow along and guide it, but you can tightly control only a rela-
tively small portion of it. The best approach is to be well prepared, relax, and
enjoy the ride.
Planning a timeline — A custom home 
is forever (So what’s the hurry?)
In Chapter 1, we show you a list of all the actions and people involved in the
custom home process. The actual time frames for this process can vary
based upon the size and scope of the project as well as the city or town you
are building in.
In order to make the planning process go as smoothly as possible, talk to a
couple of architects and contractors early to get a sense of how long every-
thing normally takes in your area. Write down each step and the expected
time frame. Now fold up that paper and stick it in your file. This paper is a
guideline for you to refer to now and again only as a reference. You can fully
expect for some tasks to take longer than you estimated.
A house is built to last decades. You don’t want to rush a complex process,
such as design or construction, to the point where corners are being cut. 
An extra month or so may cause inconvenience and may even cost a little
money, but in the end you’ll have a better-constructed home and you’ll have
forgotten about that delay after you’ve lived in the house for a year or two.
That being said, you definitely need to monitor the schedule and time frames.
Pay special attention to deadlines associated with the building department
and your lender. But use your best judgment and apply pressure only when
it’s necessary. Your project is a working environment filled with plenty of
stress. Overreaction and constant pressure on the workers can make them
less likely to help your project move along smoothly.
Making hard choices — What you can
(and can’t) afford
Most custom home projects go over their original budget — some more than
others. You really have no way of knowing how much your project will cost
38
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

until it’s actually finished. Until then, you have to constantly make choices to
adjust your budget’s expenses. Take a breather when making these decisions.
Think about whether that gold-plated faucet really makes an important differ-
ence in your lifestyle. Sleep on it for a night or two. Find creative ways to
make the home something you will enjoy while spending less money. We
share some of our favorite ideas for saving dough in Chapter 19.
Give yourself a break. Design a house that doesn’t stretch you to your limits.
That way if you’re coming in on budget, you can choose to upgrade and
splurge here and there without worry. (See Chapter 5 for more tips on saving
money when designing your house.)
Patience — Not everything 
must be perfect right away
Many craftsman and artisans participate in the building of your custom
home. If you’ve carefully hired everyone, you need to put your trust in these
skilled workers. Many processes are multistage. Unfortunately, some people
will make mistakes or leave some items partially finished. Don’t panic; this
process is normal. Your contractor and the subs can fix or replace most
everything during the building process, and your contractor and subs do
double-check their work as they go.
We give you spot-checks in the chapters in Part III of this book. Use them as 
a guide to check on everything along the way. Write down any concerns and
problems you see. Rather than pointing out everything every time you have 
a concern, talk with your contractor and set up a meeting with the appropri-
ate sub to share your findings. Doing so allows the subs to do their job with 
a minimum amount of pressure. You may find they had already scheduled 
the repair.

Chapter 2: Preparing for the Process
Keeping an eye on everything — 
Cameras on the property
If you absolutely need to know what is happen-
ing with the property 24 hours a day, you may
consider putting up cameras and broadcasting
the signal to the Internet. Doing so is perfect for
all you gadget geeks building custom homes.
Internet sites such as www.x10.com/cameras
sell cameras and software that allow you to
watch the action at your build site from any com-
puter connected to the Internet. You can expect
to pay a couple of hundred dollars for all the
equipment you need to watch your project 24
hours a day. You may find it isn’t much different
than watching paint dry, but what’s a little bore-
dom where peace of mind is concerned?

Making the process fun
You’re sure to have your share of frustrations and problems before your
custom home is finished. Managing your patience and your temper is difficult
when so many things are beyond your control and so much is at stake. To
help you enjoy the lighter side of the process when everything is looking a
little dim, we give your our top-10 list of ways to make your process extra fun:
 Enjoy a mud football game before the foundation goes in.
 Throw a block party at every completed stage.
 Have an office gambling pool on completion dates.
 Make matching T-shirts for all the workers on the project.
 Create art pieces with scrap lumber and supplies.
 Compile a construction hunk calendar.
 Give out a worker-of-the-month trophy.
 Put your family’s handprints in the cement.
 During framing, fly paper airplanes off the second story.
 Make a photo album/scrapbook documenting the entire process.

The Land Grab: Selecting the
Perfect Site
In This Chapter
 Figuring out what a lot is
 Making sure the property will work for you
 Searching for (and finding) a lot
 Estimating what a property is worth
 Understanding tear-down properties
 Purchasing the land
You can’t have a house unless you have somewhere to put it. Unlike the
pioneers of old, however, individuals today can’t just walk up and squat
on whatever piece of land that catches their eye. If you’re interested in some
land, you have to research, explore, negotiate for, and ultimately purchase a
parcel that you can call home.
In this chapter, we walk you through the entire process of searching for and
finding the perfect site. We provide you with the very best evaluation tips,
and even discuss buying a house in poor condition that you can tear down
and rebuild. Finally, we consider financing options. You have to pay for that
dream property, after all!
Knowing the Difference between 
“Land” and a “Lot”
Differentiating between some land and a lot may seem like an easy distinction.
But not so fast. The two are in fact quite different. All lots can be considered
land but not all pieces of land can be called lots. Are you scratching your
head? If so, read on . . .

 A lot or finished lot is a piece of property that is ready for building a
house. It may or may not have all the utilities (gas, electric, water, sewer,
telephone, and so on) at the site, however, they usually aren’t far away.
 Land is a catchall term that people in the construction industry use for
any piece of property without a finished, habitable structure. Land can
be commercial, residential, or agricultural. Raw land or undeveloped land
is terminology that most people in the construction industry usually use,
referring to land that isn’t ready for building.
If you’re anxious to get your new home built or if your finances are limited,
then plan to buy a finished lot, not raw land. You can find a good loan more
easily with a lot, you’ll likely pay a lower down payment, and you’ll have to
spend less to prepare the property for building — all resulting in major sav-
ings in both time and money.
Raw land can be more difficult or more expensive to finance because it usu-
ally requires additional work (often, significant additional work), such as
putting in roads and utilities, before building can begin. Fewer buyers are
willing to put the time and effort into this type of property, which makes it
less marketable than finished lots. As a result, fewer banks will be willing to
lend you the money you need — you may have to find private financing or
encourage the seller to loan you the money (referred to as having the seller
carry back paper). If you do find a lender, you’ll probably need to make a
larger down payment. In most communities, noninstitutional individuals
invest money in real estate — banks usually know these people. (See “Using
private or hard money” later in this chapter for more information.)
Also, if you buy raw land, plan to allow yourself more time to complete the
entire project because preparing raw land into a finished lot — getting
approvals and permits, building roads, extending utilities to the lot, drilling
wells, if necessary, and more — can take months or even years. Make sure
you consider the extra time when discussing the term of your lot loan with
the seller or private lender.
Location, Location, Location —
Refining Your Lot-Buying Needs
Of course you don’t want to buy just any lot. You want a lot that meets with
your desires and will retain its value, if not appreciate.
Several criteria can affect the sales price of different properties both today and
when your house is finished. Picking the right lot is just like picking a finished
house. Factors such as location and amenities can make a lot undesirable. If a
42
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

lot is undesirable to you, it may be undesirable to others as well, which can
have an effect on the marketability of the property and, ultimately, the resale
value. Consider many factors when deciding on the right location for your lot.
The following sections contain some questions to ask yourself. When answer-
ing them, take into account not only your own lifestyle, but also the factors
that will impact your ability to resell the finished house. Remember, use this
checklist when searching for the right neighborhood as well as when evaluat-
ing a prospective lot for sale.
Lifestyle
You need to decide how you want to live in your home — these elements are
a matter of personal taste. Many of the lifestyle items in the following list may
be important to some of you and unimportant to others:
 Should the lot be in an urban, suburban, or rural area?
 Should the lot be flat or sloped?
 Should the lot have much usable land?
 Will the lot require significant ongoing maintenance?
 Should the lot be in close proximity to the neighbors?
 Should it afford privacy?
 Should it be sunny or shady?
 Should the lot have natural vegetation?
 Should the lot have available on-street parking?
Marketability
The list that follows has a variety of factors that impact value, and you need
to use these factors when evaluating a lot to purchase. Keep in mind that you
may have to sacrifice some of these factors, however, to meet your budget.
Make sure you talk to a real estate professional to understand the market
demand of a particular lot based on these issues.
 Is the lot on a busy street?
 What kind of view does the lot have?
 Does it have waterfront access?
 What is the proximity to power lines?
 Is it next to or near commercial buildings or apartments?
 What’s the noise factor? How close is it to planes, trains, and 
automobiles?
43
Chapter 3: The Land Grab: Selecting the Perfect Site

 Is it on or near an earthquake fault or in a flood plain?
 Are there good schools in the area?
 What type of power, water, and sewage is available?
 What does city planning have in mind for this neighborhood?
Finding a Lot
Acquiring the right lot may be the biggest challenge you’ll face in the custom
home–building process. Property values have been steadily increasing in
most places since World War II, and not every piece of land will suit your par-
ticular needs or be cost effective for building. Finding the right lot isn’t easy,
and you need to plan for a long hunt. Some helpful resources are available,
but not as many as you may think. Finding the right lot requires sleuthing and
persistence. Your best resources are using the Internet, utilizing experienced
real estate agents, and taking your own initiative.
Surfing for turf
Using the Internet is a great way to start looking for your lot. The following
Web sites are our three favorite picks for discovering your dream lot:
 www.lotfinders.com: This site provides educational information on
purchasing lots and connections to real estate agents that sell lots.
Financing information is also available.
 www.realtor.com: Owned by the National Association of Realtors, this
site can show you every piece of land listed on the real estate bible: the
Multiple Listing Service (MLS).
 www.land.net: This site has listings for large parcels of agricultural and
residential land as well as individual lots.
Engaging a real estate agent/lot specialist
Finding a real estate agent that specializes in lots can be difficult and frustrat-
ing. Most agents don’t want to spend the time with a buyer only to sell a piece
of property at a fraction of the price (and a fraction of the commission) of a
completed home; however, a few agents have made dealing with lots their
specialty. Check to see if the real estate agent you’re working with understands
the issues associated with building, planning, and zoning that we reference in
Chapter 5 as well as in this chapter. If your agent doesn’t readily answer your
questions and seems unsure, if you feel like you know more about these
44
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

topics from reading this book than she does, or if she brushes off or blows
over your questions entirely, you may want to look for someone more experi-
enced in lot sales. If your agent seems knowledgeable in lot-only sales, she
can help you assess whether any potential problems associated with building
on a particular lot may surface.
Even if you can’t find an agent who focuses on lot sales, working with an experi-
enced real estate agent at some point still may be in your best interest. Even
though you may have to find the lot yourself, you still need help with the nego-
tiations and transaction management. If the property is listed in the MLS, the
seller is paying a commission of 3 to 5 percent to each agent anyway, so you
may as well have an agent representing your best interest. Otherwise, the list-
ing agent gets the entire commission just for representing the seller. (Check
out Wiley Publishing’s Home Buying For Dummies, 2nd edition, by Eric Tyson
and Ray Brown for more info on real estate agents and their duties and com-
missions structure.)
Doing the legwork on your own
If you want to find your perfect lot, you may have to do some detective work.
Grab your sleuthing equipment and get started.
If you’re looking for large tracts of custom lots, try the outlying areas of your
city. Custom home developments often advertise in the supermarket real
estate magazines, and new golf courses can make for a hotbed of lot subdivi-
sions. Sometimes you can find the right lot simply by spending your Sundays
driving through neighborhoods under development and looking for signs.
Finding a lot when there isn’t one
If you have searched online, worked with an agent, driven the neighborhoods,
and still haven’t found your dream lot for sale, you may need to take a more
aggressive approach. If you find any piece of land you like, then contact the
owner and make an offer! It doesn’t matter that it isn’t listed for sale right
now. Remember, everything is for sale; it’s only a matter of price. Information
on who owns any piece of land is part of the county public record. Through a
real estate agent, mortgage broker, or title company, you can request the
address and phone number of the owner of any piece of land. If your real
estate agent is managing your part of the transaction for a commission, she
should be thrilled to help you with the negotiations and the closing process.
If you’re willing to look at many pieces of land, you can take the shotgun ap-
proach. Have your agent get you a mailing list of all the lot owners in the area
and send them all personal letters explaining your burning desire to own prop-
erty and build in the neighborhood. Perhaps someone will consider selling
his property and, if not, he may know someone in the neighborhood who may.

Chapter 3: The Land Grab: Selecting the Perfect Site

Evaluating a Particular Lot — 
The True Value of Dirt
Although it may be true that the value of something is based upon what
someone is willing to pay for it, land value has other factors to consider when
determining its ultimate usefulness for building a custom home. You need to
take into consideration the cost of getting the land ready for the build. You
also must factor in limitations on the size of the home.
When determining a particular piece of property’s value, a lender’s appraiser
looks at other comparable land sales in the area to create a number for the
lender’s purposes. Keep in mind, however, that this appraisal doesn’t guaran-
tee your ability to resell the land for the same price. Nor does it mean that
your custom home budget will be able to absorb the price of the land. Consider
all the factors associated with your build — especially financing — before
purchasing a lot. Chapters 8 and 9 can help with understanding how lenders
evaluate your land in relationship to the entire custom home project.
Examining amenities and utilities
The relationship between utilities and your lot can have a significant impact
on the lot’s value. A lot requiring a septic system can add costs (which may
decrease its value). The need to drill a well or to add offsite additions, such
as sidewalks and parkways, can also negatively impact a lot’s value. Be sure
to explore the cost of installing utilities and amenities before you buy any lot.

Too bad it’s not 1889!
In 1889, Oklahoma was emerging as a wealth 
of opportunity for settlers looking for land.
Oklahoma Station and Guthrie Station were 
two promising railroad outposts destined for
urban development. In one of the strangest and
chaotic stories of land acquisition, the govern-
ment created an exciting and unprecedented
process for claiming land — a race! Rules were
posted allowing people to gather at the nearby
Arkansas and Texas borders ready to run, ride,
and walk to their desired parcel of land on 
April 22, 1889. Upon arriving at their parcel, they
would claim it by staking a flag and filing a claim
form. People already in the territory (“Legal
Sooners” as they were called) would cheat by
staking their flags early even though prohib-
ited by law. Thousands raced that day and made
Oklahoma land their home. It was exhilarating
and brutal. “It is an astonishing thing,” the New
York Herald observed on the eve of the opening,
“that men will fight harder for $500 worth of land
than they will for $10,000 in money.”

This section contains some “due diligence” items for you to consider when
figuring the ultimate “cost” of your lot. Ask these questions of the seller and
your agent, or research them with the appropriate county or city agency. Then
create a list of all possible costs to prepare for your budget and estimate how
long it will take to work through the permitting or approval process. Here is
short list of questions to ask:
 Does your lot require gravel, asphalt, or concrete for its driveway?
 Will you need to install sidewalks?
 Will you need to install street lighting?
 Will the lot require extensive earth moving or a special foundation?
 How far is the electricity from the build site, and how much will it cost
to extend it to your property?
 What is the cost of connecting to the sewer or installing a septic system?
 Will the property support a required septic system?
 What is the cost of connecting to water or installing a well?
Many people get so caught up in the dream of building a house that they sell
themselves into impractical situations. Keep your cool and do your homework.
Buying a piece of land without researching all the issues and costs can leave
you with a crushed dream and a useless piece of land.
Zoning in on zoning’s limitations
Nearly every city and county attaches building restrictions to land when the
land is first put into development. This is called zoning. Zoning determines
many factors you must consider, including
 The type of building you can put on the land
 The lot’s minimum size
 The number of dwellings or units you can build on the lot
Finding out and understanding the zoning of a particular lot before you
decide to buy is important. The information is readily available at your
friendly, local city hall or county government building; your local government
also has a guide that can tell you what each zoning designation means.
Most urban and suburban lots for houses are zoned residential R-1. If a zoning
designation has a higher number, you can build more units on it (for example,
a duplex or triplex) based on whatever number is designated (R-2, R-3, and so
on). Some commercial lots can be used for residential, but the rules vary
47
Chapter 3: The Land Grab: Selecting the Perfect Site

among municipalities. Most large, rural properties are designated RA for
Residential Agricultural. When the zoning has a number such as RA-5, the
designation means your lot must be at least 5 acres in size. This information
is important to know in case you want to split the property into more than
one lot. If you have 9 acres with RA-5 zoning, you can’t divide the lot in two.
(Remember, each lot needs to be at least 5 acres.) You could split a 10-acre
parcel in two, providing it meets all other county zoning guidelines.
Don’t take today’s zoning for granted — the local government can zone to meet
with the needs of the community on almost a moment’s notice and without
your agreement or even advance knowledge. Although this change happens
mostly in rural areas, check with the local government to see if any zoning
questions for your area are scheduled. While you’re at it, be sure to ask if any
special tax assessments will affect the property. These assessments can add
to your expenses as well.
Even though you can in theory build a single-family residence on a lot zoned
for commercial or apartment use, you may want to take the zoning into long-
term consideration. Often, a property owner may destroy a small house in a
commercial area and build apartments or office buildings, which could change
the neighborhood’s tone for the worse (think noisy neighbors and cars parked
everywhere), reducing your home’s value.
Zoning only affects the general plans for the property. More detailed restric-
tions for building may also be stated in the covenants, conditions, and
restrictions (CC&Rs) that are recorded on the property as well as design
review guidelines. We talk more about CC&Rs and design review guidelines 
in Chapter 5. Ask the homeowners’ association (HOA), your real estate agent,
or title company for a set of CC&Rs and design review guidelines to find out
about other restrictions, such as setback limits, style limitations, and height
limits, before you agree to purchase any lot.
Understanding setbacks and footprints
Setbacks determine how far from the edges of your lot you must build. They’re
generally determined by the property zoning restrictions and the CC&Rs. The
side setbacks are generally closer to the property line than the front and rear
setbacks, but not always. This information is crucial for figuring out where you
can place the house on the lot. Many neighborhoods like to keep the houses
uniform, so look to see how close neighbors’ houses are to the street and
each other to get a feel for the setbacks. In urban areas, the side setbacks
may be as small as only a few feet (Peter’s old house in San Diego had a side
setback of only 3 feet — barely enough room to wheel his trashcan through
to the street every Monday night). Rural areas can require larger setbacks
from the street or other houses, impacting curb appeal.
48
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

Setbacks also apply to outbuildings, not just to the main house. On larger
lots, you may be considering the possibility of guest homes, workshops, and
pool houses within the buildable area. These buildings all have to be within a
certain area defined by the setbacks.
The footprint of the home is the building’s outer perimeter and how it sits
upon the lot, taking into account the setbacks (see Figure 3-1). When looking
at a lot, try to imagine in rough design how positioning the footprint can take
advantage of the following:
 Drainage
 Noise
 Sunlight
 Topography
 Views
 Wind

The combination of footprint and setbacks may dictate whether your house
is one story or more. Significant side setbacks can force you to design a smaller
footprint home, which can make a difference in estimating building costs. A
smaller building area may mean building a second floor is essential. Building

49
Chapter 3: The Land Grab: Selecting the Perfect Site

a second story can work to your advantage, however, because a two-story
house can be less expensive to build than a one-story home. (For example,
building a two-story house with 4,000 square feet is cheaper than building a
one-story house with the same square feet. The two-story house requires 
less excavation, foundation, and roof work than the one-story house.)
Height restrictions spelled out in the CC&Rs have an impact on your house’s
size. If your setbacks force a smaller footprint, then your height restriction
will limit the size of house you can build. Have your real estate agent obtain
this information for you before you purchase the lot to make sure it meets
your needs. You can also contact the local planning department to access the
information yourself.
Size matters — Assessing the 
land’s value with the house
Even though much of the planning for your new home is considered in the
design phase that we discuss in Chapter 5, considering the planned size of
your house when purchasing the lot is important. You can’t build any house
you want on any lot. You’ll probably face restrictions set by the city, county,
and sometimes the market. Doing your homework on the limitations of what
can be built on a lot can keep you from making costly mistakes.
How do you know for sure that the land you want to buy is going to fit within
your budget? You must consider it in the context of the budget for your entire
custom home–building project. (See Chapter 2 for information on budgeting.)
Start by researching the sale prices of houses in the area. If homes in the
neighborhood are selling for $500,000, then buying a comparable lot for
$375,000 isn’t likely to leave you with financial room to build.
Still not sure what to do? Here’s Kevin’s quick-and-dirty four-step process for
getting a rough idea if a lot is too expensive:
1. Contact a real estate agent and get a list of properties that have sold
in the area during the last year.
Make sure the list includes the square footage and room count of each
home.
2. Pick the three sale prices that are most similar to the house in square
footage and room count that you want to build and average the sales
prices.
50
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

Most lenders use at least three comparable sales to establish an
appraised value, so this number helps you evaluate the property from
the lender’s perspective. If no home sales are similar to your desired
home in square footage and room count, then you may need to reassess
your design or your choice of neighborhood.
3. Subtract the land price from the average sales price and divide by the
square footage you want to build.
Doing so gives you a rough number for dollars per square foot. We
explain dollars per square foot in detail in Chapter 2.
4. Call three contractors in the area and ask if they can build for the dol-
lars per square foot number you established in Step 3.
The contractors you call at this point can be referrals or out of the phone
book. Where you locate them doesn’t really matter because you may not
use them for your project anyway, you simply want a rough survey. For
more information on contractor selection, check out Chapter 2.
Taking these steps can give you a rough idea if you’re even close. This
method, of course, does have many variables and unanswered questions,
such as the selection of your fixtures and materials and foundational needs.
However, if all three contractors you contact are rolling on the floor with
laughter, then you’re probably looking at an overpriced lot.
A tale of two lot buyers — How square
footage impacts value
Kevin relates this experience from a custom home project he financed in
northern California.
Ten newly divided lots were being sold for $200,000 in an established neigh-
borhood. Frank Smith looked at one of the lots and was concerned because
he thought the lot was too expensive. He was absolutely right. Mark Jones
came in the same day and looked at the same lot and quickly determined the
lot was a great deal. He was also absolutely right.
How can they both be right if they’re talking about the same lot? The decision
is all about the square footage. Frank wanted to build a 2,500-square-foot
house, which was comparable to other houses in the neighborhood selling
for $400,000. The total cost of the house including the land penciled out to
$450,000, making the project too expensive to build on this lot. Frank wouldn’t
be able to borrow enough money to build his house.
Mark’s house was going to be 4,500 square feet. His cost per square foot was
the same as Frank’s so his total cost for the project including land would be
51
Chapter 3: The Land Grab: Selecting the Perfect Site

$650,000. Houses of this size in the same neighborhood were selling for
$700,000, allowing Mark a $50,000 profit on his house, which allowed Mark 
to borrow plenty of money to build his house.
Your real estate agent can show you the sales from the last year to evaluate
the optimal house for your neighborhood, which can help you make sound
choices for maximum value and the best financing.
Dealing with a Tear-Down Property
Buying vacant land isn’t the only option for locating a custom home. Many
people opt to buy a small or dilapidated house and tear it down or add to it
significantly. Doing so can be an excellent way to move into a new home but
still have all the benefits of an established neighborhood.
Accounting for demolition costs
One immediate cost benefit to a tear down is the fact that all the utilities are
already located on the property and connected, which can be a great cost
savings, but you still have an old house connected to them. Contact a demoli-
tion contractor and get an estimate for the demolition and clearing of the
property before you sign on the dotted line.
Demolishing an older home may have additional costs due to the removal of
hazardous waste such as asbestos (often located in roof, ceilings, or siding).
Professionals need to remove asbestos, which can be costly.
Leaving one or two walls of the old home standing may be cost effective and
worthwhile. Why not tear everything down and start fresh? Because many
cities or counties offer a lower property tax rate for a remodel versus new
construction. Depending on your community’s rules and regulations, leaving
one or two existing walls establishes the project as a remodel and can save
you thousands of dollars a year.
Assessing neighborhood tolerance
When you rebuild in an established neighborhood, you want to make sure the
house conforms to the neighborhood. This action is critical to ensure a mar-
ketable property in the future. If you decide to locate your 3,000-square-foot
home in a tract of 1,500-square-foot homes, you’ll never get the value you
want out of your home. The neighborhood needs to support the value.
Underbuilding can also be a problem because people looking to buy in the
neighborhood will expect a comparably sized house.
52
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

Most established neighborhoods require community approval of any major
remodels. The local planning department generally notifies the community,
and residents have the opportunity to voice their opinions — good or bad.
Some areas have a specific design review committee that has a significant say
in what you can and can’t build.
Do your research and build a house that fits within the neighborhood toler-
ance or find another neighborhood that has houses closer to your desires
and needs. You can find more information on the design review process in
Chapter 5.
Financing pros and cons
You may also encounter financing advantages if you buy a house that needs
to be remodeled instead of buying a lot. If the house is still structurally
sound, you may be able to buy the house with little or no down payment,
while a house with structural problems can create financing problems. Most
banks don’t lend money on a house that is in functional disrepair (if you
default on your loan, the last thing the bank wants is to be the proud owner
of a hunk of junk). Buying such houses requires a lot of cash or private money,
which can be expensive. Even then, a large down payment is necessary.
Small houses on large parcels of land can also be a problem in neighborhoods
where bigger houses are now being built. Lenders want to finance houses for
living. House lenders want a property that conforms to the neighborhood,
even if the borrower is well qualified. Many people, when faced with unwilling
house lenders, look to lenders that lend on land only. If the property has any
structure on it at all, most land lenders won’t provide a land loan. Talk to
your real estate agent and loan officer about the ability to lend on a particu-
lar property before you make an offer. Remember, the finished cost estimates
of your project need to account for the purchase cost as well as the demoli-
tion cost in order to be realistic.
If you have found a structurally unsound house and a willing seller, you may
be able to buy the home with a construction loan, which will finance the pur-
chase of the property and the construction together based on the future com-
pleted value of the property. Chapters 8 and 9 explain in detail the
construction loan process and guidelines. You can apply the same construc-
tion loan information in this book as if you were working with a vacant lot.
Simply have your seller agree to a long escrow that allows you the necessary
time to design and permit your new house. Most construction lenders can
fund the purchase as part of the construction loan provided all their other
guidelines are met.
53
Chapter 3: The Land Grab: Selecting the Perfect Site

Buying Your Land
After you find your dream lot, you need to buy it. Whether you pay cash (a big
no-no — Chapter 7 explains why) or finance, you can’t just write the owner a
check and ask for a receipt. Okay, you could, but you need to follow certain
steps and make specific choices if you want to get the most for your money.
Understanding the purchase process
If you have ever purchased a home, then you’re at least somewhat familiar
with the process of buying real estate. Buying a lot is just like buying a house,
but without all the house stuff. You can find a detailed explanation of the pur-
chase process and the players involved in Kevin’s book What the Banks Won’t
Tell You; How to Get the Most Out of Your Mortgage (Grady Parsons Publishing),
available at www.stratfordfinancial.com. For beginners, here is a general
step-by-step look at the process.
Step 1: Determine your offering terms and price
Using the information in this chapter about evaluating a property, you need
to determine a price in your mind of what you’re willing to pay for the prop-
erty. Your real estate agent can give you additional information on the local
market for land and examples of finished houses in the area. If you aren’t
using an agent, you need to access this information through the local title
company. You also must decide on the length of time until closing as well as
any other necessary terms, such as your desire for the owner to loan you the
money in what is called a seller carry back. This term means the seller, after
transferring the property, retains a note or loan that you must pay him at an
agreed time with interest. We talk more about this topic in the “Finding other
land loan alternatives” section later in this chapter.
Step 2: Present the offer and negotiate
You or your real estate agent has to complete an offer form accompanied with
some sort of good faith deposit check from you. The deposit amount can be
anywhere from 1 to 3 percent of the purchase price. The check is deposited
in an escrow account upon acceptance of the offer and held in escrow until
you close the transaction. The offer and copy of the check are then presented
to the seller and negotiations begin.
You and the seller can negotiate the deal through subsequent documents
called counter-offers. The seller’s willingness to negotiate is relative to how
hot the real estate market is at the time. A hot market usually translates to
less willingness to negotiate. The seller isn’t obligated to accept any of your
54
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

terms and can always choose to say no. Of course, you can always choose to
walk away. Ideally, you’ll each give in a little and come up with a workable
compromise. As Kevin’s mom, a 30-year real estate agent veteran, said, “An
offer is an opening of a conversation.” The less emotions in the conversation,
the easier the negotiations proceed.
If the property is listed with a real estate agent, that agent doesn’t represent
your interests. Make sure you bring your own agent to represent you as the
buyer. Doing so doesn’t cost you any more because the seller pays the com-
mission. If no real estate agent is involved, consult one for guidance. She may
help you with the paperwork for a small fee. You can always check with an
attorney as well, but an attorney generally charges more and sometimes
makes the transaction more complicated than it needs to be.
Step 3: Make an application with your lender
We explain various financing options in the next section. After you have
determined which lending approach is right for you, you’ll fill out a loan
application with the lender of your choice. The lender orders an appraisal
from a certified appraiser. You’ll probably have to pay for this appraisal
upfront. The cost can vary depending upon location and the lot’s value, but
usually it will cost between $300 and $600. You’re entitled to a copy of this
appraisal, which will be based upon comparable lots in the area that have
sold in the last six months to a year. The original appraisal goes to the lender
along with the application and any credit documentation you provide, such
as bank statements, W-2s, and tax returns.
At this time, your lender will give you a good faith estimate (GFE) of all the
closing costs associated with your loan and the purchase transaction. The
costs vary based upon the loan amount and type of loan, but you can antici-
pate a range of 3 to 6 percent of the purchase price as an estimate of all the
costs involved.
You can save the upfront cash for closing costs by offering to increase the
price of the lot by 3 percent and then asking the seller to credit you 3 percent
of the purchase price for nonrecurring closing costs. Most lenders accept
this agreement as long as the appraiser mentions that it has no effect on the
value. Financing the closing costs in this way leaves your cash available for
other important costs along the way.
Step 4: Open escrow with an escrow company or attorney
The term escrow means depositing money and property with a neutral third
party to be disbursed upon completion of all terms of a related agreement.
Each state has its own process for escrow procedure. Some states use attor-
neys to act as the escrow agent and others use title insurance companies. If
you’re in a wet funding state, you, the seller, and the escrow agent all pick a
55
Chapter 3: The Land Grab: Selecting the Perfect Site

day to meet and sign the paperwork at one time. In a dry funding state, such
as California, you each execute the paperwork on your own or with a notary
public over several days before the actual closing date.
The escrow period can be anywhere from 30 days to 6 months depending upon
the needs and negotiations of you and your seller. Your real estate agent helps
guide you through the closing process. If you don’t have an agent, then the
escrow agent will be your best guide. You can find good escrow agents through
referrals from real estate agents, loan officers, and friends. Most are well
trained, so unless your transaction is extremely complicated, you should be
able to go with someone you simply find personable.
Step 5: Do your due diligence
While you’re in escrow, you have a chance to complete any research on the
property that couldn’t be done before the offer. In a hot market, you might
not have had much time to research the property before putting in an offer.
As soon as you have a chance, make sure that the property meets your needs
relative to size and value as outlined in this chapter. If you have concerns
about the land, such as building restrictions or guidelines, you may want to
add contingencies to the offer that allow you to pull out of the transaction if
your research results are unfavorable.
Step 6: Execute the paperwork and bring in the money
As soon as your loan is approved, you need to bring your cash to escrow and
sign the loan documents. You can wire money into escrow or bring it in the
form of a cashier’s check. Bring your pen because you’ll have as many as 100
documents to sign for the escrow and the loan.
Step 7: Close escrow and take title
The title insurance company provides you with a deed to the land and a policy
insuring that it is yours. The title company pays the seller the money due and
records any documents and deeds related to the transfer and new loan.
Using the bank
Most people finance their lot purchase through a local bank or nationwide
lender. A good mortgage broker can help you determine who has the best
programs to meet your needs. Local banks generally have more conservative
criteria for loaning on land because they’re heavily regulated. Large, publicly
held lenders have the ability to offer creative and flexible loan programs
because they mix the risk with other loans in their portfolio.
56
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

Not all mortgage brokers have experience with land and construction loans,
so be picky. Don’t trust the phone book on this one; ask around to find the
experts. Try to find a loan officer that has 100 or more loans of these types
under her belt. The best way to test loan officers is to see if they ask you
more questions than you ask them. If they simply try to sell you on one type
of loan without inquiring about your needs, then look for someone else to
help with your loan needs.
Qualifying
The first thing a lender will ask you is whether you intend to buy the land for
your own personal use. The lot-financing rates and terms for owner-occupied
properties are much better than for investment properties. The lender looks
to see if it makes sense for you to move to this property. If you’re claiming it to
be a second home, the lender will expect it to be in a resort type area or a city
other than your primary residence. Buying the lot in a cheaper neighborhood
on the other side of town from where you currently live will raise eyebrows.
The lender next assesses your qualification on the basis of your credit report,
liquid assets (cash, stock, or other easily accessible forms of money), and
your debt-to-income ratio (the amount of debt you carry in the form of loans
and credit card balances versus your income). Your lender’s approach to
these issues is very similar to how it will underwrite your construction loan;
see Chapter 9 for the specifics. To make its decision, the lender wants to see,
at minimum, the following documentation:
 Appraisal
 Credit report
 Three months’ bank statements
 Two years’ W-2s and recent pay stub
 Two years’ tax returns, if self employed
Banks may loan you a higher percentage of the purchase price based upon
the quality of your other qualifications. Being able to show good credit and
sufficient income can get you a loan for 90 percent of the purchase price.
If you have excellent credit, some institutional banks such as Washington
Mutual and IndyMac offer “stated income” programs for purchasing lots.
These loans don’t require you to show any income documents (pay stubs or
tax returns). Some lenders offer these loans up to 85 percent of the purchase
price; however, the income you state must make sense relative to your job. A
fast-food clerk supposedly making $150,000 a year isn’t likely to get approved.
You may need to show other documentation and meet other criteria neces-
sary for these loans, so make sure you get the info from your loan officer before
you apply. We give specific details on these types of loans in Chapter 8.
57
Chapter 3: The Land Grab: Selecting the Perfect Site

Many lot lenders are the same lenders that finance construction. You apply
for a construction loan some months after you get the land. If the lender sees
conflicting information regarding income or assets, the lender could turn you
down. Therefore, understanding the requirements for lot loans and construc-
tion loans is critically important. (We explain construction loan requirements
extensively in Chapter 9.) Lenders look in their files for any other loans they
made to the same borrower. If the information is inconsistent, the lender
simply rejects the loan.
Stated-income loans are notorious for creating consistency problems.
Because a lot loan is usually a lower loan amount than a construction loan,
less income is required to qualify. If you only state enough income to qualify
for the lot loan, and then when you submit the construction loan application
to the same lender you state a higher stated income amount, the lender will
immediately deny the loan. Work with your loan officer to determine the qual-
ifications necessary for the larger construction loan so you can represent the
land loan file in a way that will match the construction loan needs. Chapters 8
and 9 can serve as a guide for that discussion.
One of the advantages of working with a mortgage broker is that she can act
as a filter. By looking at your documentation, a good broker can determine
which lender fits best with your project. Doing so keeps you from stabbing in
the dark and providing too much information to the lender that may result in
denial.
Picking a loan
The most important criteria for your loan is the loan’s length of time. (We talk
more about timing of lot loans in the section “Making sure the loan period is
long enough” later in this chapter). Generally, your lot loan picks you based
upon your qualifications. You may, however, need to choose between a fixed-
rate loan or an adjustable-rate loan. Some lenders offer only fixed-rate loans
where the interest rate stays the same for the loan’s life. These rates are gen-
erally higher than adjustable-rate mortgages, which have interest rates that
move with a particular monetary index such as government treasury bills.
Some people believe a fixed rate can save you money because it protects 
you from rising interest rates. But if you plan on building in the next few
years, you’ll be taking a construction loan that pays off the land loan. See
Chapter 8 for details. Because you’ll likely pay off the land loan soon with the
construction loan, using a fixed-rate loan isn’t likely to save you much money.
Ultimately, you need to do the math and compare the various loan payment
options over the length of time you anticipate before you start building.
Kevin’s recommendation is to go with the largest amount of money you can
borrow for the longest period of time with the lowest payment. Doing so
gives you the most flexibility for moving into construction financing by keep-
ing the maximum amount of cash in your pocket where you need it most.
58
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

Getting denied — What the banks won’t finance
We can think of several situations that will eliminate conventional financing
as an option. Some are based upon your own situation and some on the prop-
erty. Here is a quick checklist:
 If your credit score is below 620 (see Chapter 9)
 If you have been late on your mortgage in the last 12 months
 If you’re unemployed
 If you have no down payment
 If the property has existing buildings on it
 If the property is more than 50 acres (some banks allow only 20 acres)
 If the property has no electricity nearby
 If the property has no public access
 If the property has multiple parcels (some banks allow two)
If your property or qualifications fall into one of these categories, don’t panic
just yet. Other lending alternatives are available. Some may cost more money
and be more restrictive than conventional lending, but they may be better
than the thought of abandoning your project.
Finding other land loan alternatives
If you find the perfect lot and the bank thinks the property or your credit and
income are less than perfect, you still may be able to buy it without paying all
cash. Some lending alternatives are available if your property or credit doesn’t
meet the bank’s guidelines.
Letting the owner carry the burden
One alternative way to finance a property is to have the property owner loan
you the money or carry back paper. In this case, the seller acts as the lender
and has you (the buyer) execute a note secured by the property for the
amount he doesn’t receive in cash through escrow. Not every owner will con-
sider this option. If the owner carries back the entire amount of the purchase
price, the seller can’t owe any money on the property. Another way a seller
can help is to carry back a second loan so that you can put down a smaller
down payment. The primary lender must agree to this arrangement. In either
case, the seller has the ability to foreclose if you miss payments. You need
your real estate agent or an attorney to draft the note and security instru-
ment to make sure everyone is properly protected.
When is a seller more willing to carry the financing himself? A seller may agree
to carry paper if the property is hard to finance through banks or if he — for
59
Chapter 3: The Land Grab: Selecting the Perfect Site

whatever reason — is anxious to sell. The seller may also want to defer the
taxes due from the sale of the property; carrying paper allows the seller to
pay taxes only as you pay off the loan. You gain no real advantage when the
seller carries the financing unless the loan’s terms are more favorable than
any other lender offers you. Most construction lenders require the seller to
be paid off when they fund the construction loan. Few institutional construc-
tion lenders allow a subordination of a seller carry.
Some sellers want a premium if they’re going to carry paper. Furthermore,
many sellers still want to check your financial wherewithal, so credit and
income can still factor into their decision. Ultimately, you can negotiate the
best deal with a seller if she is getting all the money expected from the
escrow, so having her carry may not be the best route.
Using private or hard money
Hard money comes from private investors who specialize in making loans on
real estate. Hard-money lenders generally aren’t concerned with credit or
income. They hope to make high-interest yields or make money by taking
back your property through foreclosure and selling it at a profit. Typical
hard-money runs a number of percentage points higher interest than the pre-
vailing market rate, plus 5 percent of the loan amount in upfront fees called
points. This high interest seems expensive, but if banks or owners won’t give
you a loan, then this choice may be better than not buying the lot at all.
Because hard-money lenders like equity, they usually want as much as a 50
percent down payment.
Making sure the loan period 
is long enough
Lot loans come in a variety of lengths, but only a couple of banks offer them
for more than five years. Your lot loan needs to be in place until the construc-
tion loan pays it off. Most projects can make it to the construction-loan phase
within two to three years. If you think you’re going to take a long time to
design your home or that you’ll need to save your money for a long time
before beginning construction, then you may want to search for loans that
last more than ten years.
How long it takes to begin the building process can vary wildly. The ultimate
amount of time is based upon your local planning departments, how picky
you are with your plans, how busy the current construction climate is, and
many other factors. Figure out how long you think it will take and double it to
be safe. Most of the delay factors will be beyond your control.

Stop! Don’t pay off your lot yet!
Contractors, consumers, architects, and many others often tell you that you
must pay off your lot before you get a construction loan. This is the biggest
myth in the custom home–construction world. Actually paying off the lot isn’t
a good idea unless it’s absolutely necessary. The following sections explain
several good reasons to keep a loan on your land until you’re ready to build.
You need cash on hand to fund your project
Buying your land is just the beginning of paying people in a construction pro-
ject. The architect, the engineer, the well and septic people — and many
others — need to be paid along the way. The permitting process can suck
your cash as well. These people and processes can add up to tens of thou-
sands of dollars. If you run out of money because you put all your hard-
earned savings into your land, your new home can become a nightmare.
Having cash in your pocket is your best protection for keeping your project
moving along. Check out Chapter 7 for more on this subject.
Money put in is expensive to get out
Few lenders refinance a land loan; most only let you replace an existing loan.
Rarely does a bank give you a loan where you’re taking cash out of a piece of
land. That means that after you put money into the land, it’s gone forever —
at least until your construction loan has started. Your only choice will proba-
bly be hard or private money, which can cost 5 percent of the loan upfront
and 10 percent annually. This increase compared to institutional lot loan pric-
ing is an expensive price to pay for money you already had in your pocket to
begin with.
Cash reserves are required for construction loans
Banks want you to have cash on hand before they give you a loan. The amount
of required reserves varies from bank to bank (see Chapter 9 for specific
details). If you’re short on the bank’s cash requirements, it won’t give you a
loan — even with a paid-off lot.
Fending off the taxman
Real estate interest is one of the few deductions left for the average taxpayer.
As long as you finish the house as a primary residence or second home, you
should be able to deduct the interest and points paid on the loan. That means
the government will pay a good portion of the payments for you to keep cash
in your pocket. Discuss this option with your CPA or financial planner. You
can ignore the tax benefits if you feel paying more than your share is part of
your civic duty.

Defining Your House Style
In This Chapter
 Discovering your style
 Finding out about conventional building materials
 Building with wood
 Contemplating system-built homes
 Exploring alternative building methods
P
eople tend to judge houses just like books — by their covers. Looks
matter: People either fall in love at first sight or think a house is an eye-
sore. What individuals see is the home’s style. That’s why defining your
home’s look is so important, which is exactly what we help you do in this
chapter.
You may have a truly unique home in mind — like one built of log or post-
and-beam construction. This chapter offers more information on buying and
building these specialized homes.
Getting to Know Your Style Preferences
and Limitations
Close your eyes and picture the outside of your ideal home. Often, a definite
look pops into mind: a yellow farmhouse with white shutters and a front
porch, a boxy glass and concrete contemporary, or maybe a brick colonial
with classic trim and an unadorned face. If an image of the perfect house
doesn’t immediately come to you, get off the sofa, find your camera, and get
ready to go hunting.

Educating your eye
Get ready and get set to go on a house safari. It requires just a few hours, so
you don’t need to pack water or hire a guide. As you drive through neighbor-
hoods, take pictures of homes that strike you — the good, the bad, and even
the ugly. After you’re back home with photos of a variety of house styles, you
can consider what appeals to you and what doesn’t.
If you can’t find a variety of homes nearby to photograph or aren’t impressed
by the homes you come across, head to your local bookstore to stock up on a
variety of magazines and books for inspiration. Look for
 General home magazines, such as Architectural Digest, Better Homes &
Gardens, House & Garden, Home, Country Home, and Country Living
 Specialty home magazines, such as Natural Home, American Bungalow,
Old House Journal, Dwell, log home magazines, timber frame home maga-
zines, and Victorian-style magazines
 Regional magazines that cover your area, such as Sunset, Southern
Living, Down East, Midwest Living, or Coastal Living
 Books that help you identify architectural styles, such as What Style Is It?
A Guide to American Architecture by John C. Poppeliers (Wiley) or A Field
Guide to American Houses by Virginia McAlester and Lee McAlester
(Knopf)
As you flip through your new library of magazines and books, rip, clip, or pho-
tocopy photos that illustrate exterior details you like. Take note of what speaks
to you: Is it a particular color or material? Window size, shape, or grouping?
Shutters? Dormers or roof shape? Collect your clippings in a three-ring note-
book or expanding file folder. Soon you can define your own personal style.
Discovering your local style
Now breathe deeply and take a reality check. Maybe you’ve fallen for an
Asian-inspired pagoda-style home with a flat roof. It may not be your best
choice, however, if you plan to build in an area with heavy snowfalls (that is,
unless you enjoy the thought of several tons of wet snow crashing through
your roof). This appeal to common sense will lead you to another rich source
of home style ideas: your area’s traditional (or vernacular) architecture. To
discover this style, take a look around and note how older homes were built.
Regional styles typically evolve as a sensible response to a local climate,
making them wonderful guides for what kind of buildings will work and what
64
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

kind won’t. Think about it: If that 200-year-old farmhouse down your street
didn’t know how to stand up to your region’s weather, it wouldn’t still be
around today.
If you’re moving to a new area to build your home, seek out the old-timers. In
New England, for instance, the compact Cape Cod style home with its steep-
pitched roof sheds snow and provides a snug second story under the roofline.
These buildings offered warm shelter for early Americans living through harsh
winters. Down south, in hotter climates, high ceilings in sprawling plantation
homes lured warm air up and out of the way. Their wide porches gave folks a
place to sit, eat, and often, sleep, outside.
Learning from years of building experience can help make your home easier
to maintain and much more pleasant to live in. Employing vernacular archi-
tecture also provides the added advantage of making your home look like it
belongs. Even if you want your custom home to be unique and make a bold-
style statement, you don’t want to own the neighborhood laughingstock
either, and, at some point, you (or your heirs) will want to sell it. Then, your
home’s classic good looks will be a valuable asset.
Still, it’s a free country, and if you live in Pennsylvania and really want a
Southwest pueblo-style home with a flat roof and adobe walls (and you’ve
ruled out a move to Arizona), you just have to be ready to pay more to build
and maintain your home.
Playing by community rules
If aesthetics or the wisdom of your ancestors doesn’t influence you in defin-
ing your home’s style, your neighborhood might — in the form of covenants,
conditions, and restrictions (also known as CC&Rs). These legalities (which
you must agree to as a part of your real estate contract) can significantly
impact your home, so do your homework before buying land. If you really
want a log home, a barn full of llamas out back, or a three-story home over-
looking a lake, you better read the CC&Rs’ fine print before you buy your lot.
Policies set out by homeowners’ associations or local jurisdictions could
restrict many aspects of your home, such as
 The height and size of your building
 Its proximity to a body of water
 The building materials you can use and your home’s exterior colors
 Your ability to raise livestock
 The types of vehicles that can be parked on-site
65
Chapter 4: Defining Your House Style

Obviously, know upfront what you’re in for. Some associations strictly
enforce their restrictions. Others are more lenient. The upside of these kinds
of restrictions is that they apply both to you and to your neighbors. You can
rest assured your neighborhood will retain its current standards and be free
of worry that some guy across the street will make his front yard a dumping
ground for derelict plumbing fixtures. If you don’t like these kinds of rules
and regulations, you’d better buy your land in a different neighborhood.
If you plan to build in a community with CC&Rs, an architectural review
board may have to approve your home’s design. Because this review process
may take months, add extra time into your construction schedule. (We talk
more about review boards and the plan approval process in Chapter 6.)
Tapping the wisdom of the pros
So, you’ve looked at houses nearby, considered vernacular architecture, and
flipped magazine pages until your fingers were raw, but still can’t decide on a
style. Think back to your house safari and remember the master: Marlin
Perkins from TV’s Wild Kingdom. When things got really dicey, wise old
Marlin sent his sidekick, Jim, out to wrestle the wildebeests, while he stayed
in the safety of the vehicle. Take a lesson from Marlin: Instead of risking a
serious mistake, call for professional help. If you can’t envision a style for
your new home, or you and your spouse can’t agree on a style, ask for input
from an architect or designer. (See Chapter 5 for the specifics of finding and
working with an architect.)
Your design pro will look at the scrapbook you have compiled and ask ques-
tions about your lifestyle. She may suggest a home style that’s common to
your area or make the case for something more unusual. During this design
process, you can help by
 Openly discussing your budget. It wastes your time and the designer’s
if you hedge about how much you want to spend on your home.
 Offering honest feedback. If your designer seems to be veering off
track, say so. The goal for everyone involved should be to create the
best possible home.
 Keeping an open mind. Don’t dismiss an architect’s suggestions without
giving them some consideration.
At some point in the process you’ll wonder if hiring a designer or architect is
necessary or worthwhile. The fees these professionals charge typically fall in
the range of 10 to 15 percent of your project’s total cost. If you can find a plan
in a book that suits your needs as well as your lot and your neighborhood
restrictions perfectly, you don’t need an independent designer.
66
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

But remember those wildebeests: By not using a designer or architect, you’re
facing some wild times all by yourself. An architect or designer often can act
as your advocate in a confrontation with a contractor. Because the designer’s
job is to be knowledgeable about building materials, he can save you from
spending money on a product or material that simply won’t work in your area
or in your home. Furthermore, he can create a home that truly fits on the
land you worked so hard to find. 
Good communication and rapport are essential elements in your relationship
with a design professional. If these two elements evaporate over the course
of your project, you may need to cut ties with your building or design profes-
sional and choose someone new. This action is drastic, however, and should
only be taken if you have honestly tried and simply can’t reconcile your dif-
ferences.
Considering Conventional Construction:
Wood versus Steel
By far, the most popular home construction technique is conventional con-
struction, which uses vertical studs to create the home’s skeletal system of
both exterior and interior walls. Choosing conventional construction allows
for a wide range of styles; the studs are simply the basic ingredient. The
studs in your walls will be either dimensional wood lumber (lumber that has
been cut to specific, standard sizes) or steel.
More than likely your house will be stick-built: It will use good old-fashioned
wooden studs — long, thin boards used throughout the framing process.
Wooden studs are popular because
 Most framers have the necessary tools (hammer, nail gun, saw, and so
on) to work with wood.
 Wood is mass-produced and costs up to 30 percent less than steel.
 Most subcontractors and laborers know how to work with wood.
 You can alter wood-framed walls relatively easily in the future.
A second option — steel framing — has been in use for office buildings for
some time now. For a variety of reasons, steel is finding its way into more res-
idential construction projects. Although steel isn’t for everybody, it does
have a few advantages over wood:
67
Chapter 4: Defining Your House Style

 Steel offers the greatest strength for the lowest price of any building
material.
 Steel is inorganic. Galvanized steel doesn’t burn, warp, rot, split, crack,
creep, or get eaten by termites and other creepy crawlers.
 Steel is dimensionally stable. It doesn’t expand or contract due to 
moisture.
 With steel, you have less scrap and waste (2 percent for steel versus 20
percent for lumber).
For every person singing the praises of steel framing, another is swearing
that wood is the only way to go. The benefits and disadvantages seem about
equal for each method, so it comes down to what makes the most sense to
you and your contractor, the price, the climate, and other considerations.
After you find a contractor you like and who you can afford, ask for refer-
ences and check out his work firsthand. Then we advise that you yield to
your builder’s preferences on the wood versus steel issue.
Enjoying the Warmth of a Log Home
Everyone who has ever watched Bonanza or read a Little House on the Prairie
book (come on, admit it!) has harbored a fantasy of living in a log home. For
some, the fantasy is fleeting; for others it becomes a lifelong obsession.
Building a log home does bring a variety of advantages:
 You have a range of log home styles available to you. Logs can do justice
to country, rustic, Victorian, Arts & Crafts, and even contemporary
styles.
 You’ll end up with a custom home that is distinct and filled with character.
 The thickness (also known as thermal mass) of logs offers good insula-
tion and helps the home retain warmth in the winter and remain cool in
the summer.
 Many log home owners say their homes are quieter inside than conven-
tional homes.
 The rugged good looks of a log home make it fit naturally into a variety
of settings, from prairie to woods and from lakeside to mountaintop.
But if you chose to build a log home, understand that you’re asking for some-
thing out of the ordinary, which may cost you more than a conventionally
built home in terms of time and money.
68
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

The following sections briefly outline how the log home–building process 
differs from the conventional building process and also provides advice on
selecting a log producer if you decide to make your log home dream a reality.
If you’re interested in a log home, we suggest that you continue your search
for more information in several places:
 Use your friendly, local bookstore or library. Look for books and maga-
zines on the subject. On the newsstand, look for Log Home Living, Log
Homes Illustrated, Country’s Best Log Homes, and Log and Timber Style.
 Stop by log model homes in your area. Talk with the sales representa-
tives and ask questions.
 Knock on the doors of log homes you see. Log home owners are typi-
cally quite happy to discuss their home–building experiences.
 Talk to real estate agents, your lender, insurance agents, and local
builders about your desire for a log home. These building profession-
als may be able to point you in the right direction.
 Finally, keep an eye out for the dozens of log home shows that are
held around the country every year. A show is a good place to see first-
hand what various log home producers have to offer. (You can find infor-
mation at www.loghomeliving.com or www.loghomeexpo.com.)
Two ways to skin a log
As you research log home options, you’ll find two basic types of log producers.
Most companies are manufacturers that mill their logs using machinery. The
end result is logs that are uniform in shape and dimension. Manufacturers
typically also use machinery to cut the corner notches that connect the logs.
Many manufacturers offer log siding that can be used on a home’s exterior
(and also on interior walls) to give the look of log construction with a slightly
lower price tag. The remaining log companies call themselves handcrafters.
As the name implies, these companies employ crew members who use chain
saws, or sometimes even hand tools, to shape the logs for homes one at a time.
Which should you choose? As with so many decisions involving custom
homes, the answer is, “It depends.” Consider the following:
 Do you need your home fast? Some handcrafters are tiny operations
that produce only a few homes a year. If you want to build quickly,
choose a larger production handcrafter or a manufacturer. Remember,
though, that even these producers need weeks or months of lead time to
cut your logs.
 Do you prefer a certain style of log? For some people, only square logs
accented with wide bands of white chinking (the material used to seal
69
Chapter 4: Defining Your House Style

the joints between logs) look like a “true” log home. Other people prefer
smaller, rounded logs with no chinking. You can see an example of milled
logs in Figure 4-1. The look you like can help you decide on a producer.
 How much log is enough? Do you want massive, 20-inch diameter logs
for your home and the interior partition walls, too? Most manufacturers’
machinery simply can’t handle oversize logs, so if you think bigger is
better, you’ll most likely choose a handcrafter.
 Will it play in your neighborhood? If you plan to build in an area filled
with log homes, consider following local traditions. Are most of the
homes built with huge, handcrafted logs? Choosing smaller, machined
logs may make your home the odd man out.
 Can you pay for it? Does a handcrafted home cost more than a manufac-
tured home? Again, it depends on whom you ask. Handcrafted homes
are preassembled in the crafters’ log yard, so reerection of the shell on
the construction site may go faster, saving time and money. Still, hand-
crafting a log home is labor intensive; after all, you’re asking someone to
build your home by hand. Manufactured logs may take longer to assem-
ble on-site, but producing them is more mechanized (and less expen-
sive). The only way to find out is to ask plenty of questions and compare
ballpark estimates on your home from both types of producers.

Thinking that logs are a money-saving, do-it-yourself alternative to a conven-
tionally built home? Do your research. Even if you mastered your Lincoln Log
kit at an early age and know which end of a chain saw to point toward a tree,
buying logs from a supplier and planning to cut, notch, and stack them your-
self may provide short-term savings at the cost of long-term headaches.
Unless you have a sound plan (or know a builder who has good experience)
to stack, fasten, and seal the logs into walls that will pass building codes and
stand up to the elements year after year, buy a log package from a reputable
log producer.
Purchasing your log package
Most log manufacturers and some handcrafters sell log packages. A log pack-
age assembled by a log producer will most likely come with fasteners to hold
the logs together, precut notches to interlock the logs at the corners, some
kind of insulating material to place between the logs, sealants for weather-
proofing, and instructions for your contractor (or you) to put it all together.
You can purchase most log packages through a network of dealers or local
sales representatives. Your local representative can help you purchase your
log package and, if she is a general contractor, may also help you build your
home. As your liaison with the log producer, your dealer can help you with
your home’s design, coordinate the logs’ delivery, and walk you through the
purchasing and construction processes.
One major difference in the construction process occurs in the loan process.
Understandably, log producers don’t want to cut and process logs for your
job without knowing that you’re serious about building the home. For that
reason, they ask for a large deposit (typically 50 percent of the package cost)
before they cut the logs. The construction lender you choose must be willing
to advance that sum from your total construction loan early in the process.
(For more information on the construction lending process, see Chapter 10.)
After the log producer delivers the logs to your building site, the producer’s
crew or your general contractor’s crew will stack them into walls. The home
will take shape quickly, because after they’re stacked, the logs create finished
walls, both outside and inside. They don’t need to be insulated, covered with
drywall, or sided on the outside. Log homes do have some unique construc-
tion steps, but generally subcontractors working on a log home will proceed
as they do on a home built with conventional construction.
71
Chapter 4: Defining Your House Style

Highlighting Wood Inside — Timber
Frame or Post-and-Beam
If you love the look of wood but not necessarily log homes, you may opt for a
post-and-beam or timber frame home. Chances are you’ve seen this kind of
building method used in old barns or churches. A frame of substantial, inter-
locking timbers supports timber homes. The timbers may be held together
with pegged joinery cut out of the timbers themselves or fastened with bolts
or metal plates. Unlike log homes, from the outside, timber frame or post-
and-beam homes can look like any other home. Inside, the frame’s beauty is
revealed, adding character and wood tones to interior spaces. (See Figure 4-2.)
Timber framing is a new take on an old tradition that has several benefits:
 Timber framing creates a home with high energy efficiency. The energy
efficiency comes with the method of enclosing the frame. Many timber
frame companies suggest the use of structural insulated panels (SIPs) to
wrap the frame in a continuous envelope of insulation.

72
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

 Timber framing, which has been practiced for centuries, uses large
wood posts and beams that add plenty of character to a home.
 Through the use of trusses, timber framing can create homes with large
open spaces that span great distances and accommodate the open floor
plan that many homeowners desire.
As with log home construction, timber framing may add to a home’s bottom
line. It’s a specialty home, after all. You may be able to recoup the extra money
in energy savings over the life of the home and in a higher price set at resale.
To find out more about timber framing:
 Go to your bookstore or library. Look for books and magazines on the
topic. Look for Timber Homes Illustrated, Timber Frame Homes, and Log
and Timber Style magazines. Tedd Benson’s books, Timberframe: The Art
and Craft of the Post-and-Beam Home and Timber-Frame Home: Design,
Construction, Finishing (both by Taunton Press) are good starting points.
 Search online for timber frame and post-and-beam companies to see
photos and descriptions of their work. Many companies sponsor open
houses, workshops, or frame raisings that are open to the public.
 Visit the companies’ model homes or homes of their previous clients to
see framing in person. Ask the representatives or homeowners questions.
73
Chapter 4: Defining Your House Style
SIP: Building a better sandwich
Structural insulated panels (SIPs), which range
in size from 4-x-8-foot rectangles to large 8-x-
24-foot sheets, are “sandwiches” of expanded
foam between sheets of plywood, oriented
strand board (OSB), or other solid material such
as drywall. SIP manufacturers bond the layers
together using pressure and industrial adhe-
sives. After they’re precision-formed in a fac-
tory, the panels are ready to be shipped as is, or
the manufacturers’ crew can cut the panels to
accommodate windows and doors. The panels’
plywood or OSB surfaces serve as the base for
drywall or paneling in the home’s interior and
any common type of finish on the exterior, such
as siding, brick, or wood shingles. During con-
struction, electricians can run their wires
through chases drilled in the panels’ foam or
simply install wiring behind wall baseboards. To
connect the SIPs to the frame, the installation
crew spikes or fastens the panels to the timber
frame, and then fastens them to each other.
SIPs can be used for roofs and floors as well.
SIP walls may cost a bit more than convention-
ally framed walls, but their increased energy
efficiency should make up for any additional
upfront cost.

 Attend one of the dozens of log and timber frame home shows held
each year around the country. You can find information at
www.loghomeliving.com, www.timberframehomes.com, 
www.timberhomesillustrated, or www.loghomeexpo.com.
As you research timber framing options, you’ll find that several different
kinds of companies offer timber frames and post-and-beam packages. Most
packages contain the timbers for the frame, and oftentimes, the system to
enclose the frame.
The style of the timbers can create or enhance a number of different styles,
from Shaker style to Old World lodge to Arts & Crafts style to something more
rustic. If you’re an antiques lover, you might search out a timber producer
that can supply timbers salvaged from old buildings or a complete frame from
a former barn to give your new home a vintage feel.
If you’re concerned that timber framing will bust your budget, opt for a hybrid
home. In a hybrid, timber framing is used selectively, typically in large public
areas, like great rooms, entryways, or dining rooms. Smaller rooms, utility
spaces, and bedrooms can be built without timber framing to save money.
Along with cutting the timbers, and often raising them on-site, companies may
offer additional services. Make sure you understand if your timber producer
provides these kinds of services, or if you need to hire additional, local help
to work on your project. The companies may
 Enclose the frame with SIPs, conventionally framed walls, or some other
enclosure system
 Have a staff member who can design the frame or the entire home
 Serve as the general contractor for your home’s construction from start
to finish
In your research, you’ll find that timber frame operations range in size. Some
small companies concentrate on handcrafting just one or two frames a year.
Other timber frame and post-and-beam companies produce many more homes
annually and sell packages through sales representatives or dealers. Some of
these representatives live or work in a model home. Your representative can
help you purchase your timber frame or post-and-beam package, and, if he or
she is a general contractor, may build your home. As your liaison with the
company, your dealer can help you with your home’s design, coordinate the
frame’s delivery, and explain the purchasing and construction processes.
One major difference in the timber home construction process occurs in the
lending process. As with producers of log homes, a timber producer doesn’t
cut a frame without knowing you’re serious about paying for it. For that
reason, the producer will ask for a large deposit (typically 50 percent of the
74
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

package cost) before the timbers are cut. The construction lender you choose
must advance that sum from your total construction loan early in the process.
(For more information on construction lending, see Chapter 10.)
After delivering your timbers to your site, your timber producer’s crew will
assemble and raise the frame. The framer’s crew, or your general contractor’s
crew, will then enclose the home and it will be considered “under roof” or
“dried in.” Although timber frame and post-and-beam houses have some
unique construction steps, subcontractors working on these homes generally
proceed as they do on a home built with conventional construction. As with
other types of custom home construction, the general contractor typically
supervises the entire timber home project from start to finish.
Considering a System Approach
When you need new kitchen cabinetry, you usually don’t ask a cabinetmaker
to haul his tools, crew, and raw materials to your home to build cabinets for
you on-site. You pick a style at a cabinet supplier’s showroom and order the
number and size you need. The supplier sends your order to the manufac-
turer, who goes about building your cabinets in a factory. You can apply
these very same methods of production and delivery to building a home.
Homes produced in a factory are called system-built homes.
Before visions of double-wides rusting in trailer parks come dancing into your
head, you need to know that “trailer homes” are now labeled as “manufactured
homes” and are built to a different code (known as “HUD code” for the Housing
and Urban Development agency that writes it) than system-built homes
(which are built to the same codes as site-built homes). System-built homes
include both modular and panelized homes.
Weighing your options
Today’s factory-built or system-built homes come in many forms, but fall into
two broad categories:
 Modular home: Built using preconstructed sections of the house, called
modules
 Panelized home: Built using preconstructed wall, floor, or roofing units,
as well as all other components of the house
Each form uses components that a supplier cuts to fit — and sometimes even
assembles — and then delivers to the building site for completion.
75
Chapter 4: Defining Your House Style

Some companies specialize in creating large “chunks” of homes in their fac-
tories. These companies build panels or wall sections using conventional
construction or SIPs that are made of layers of plywood or oriented strand
board and foam. The panels may contain prehung doors or fully installed win-
dows, and they’re shipped to the construction site to be joined together to
create walls on the foundation.
Why would you choose to have your home prebuilt instead of built on your
property? The question for many is, “Why wouldn’t you?” Some of the bene-
fits include the following:
 System-built home plans are as flexible as conventional construction
homes in that they can have one, two, three, or more levels, gourmet
kitchens, finished basements, brick walls, and fireplaces. And, no, they
don’t have wheels.
 Prebuilding in a factory saves time because workers aren’t delayed by
weather or lack of available materials.
 The volume of building at the factory means workers can be concen-
trated in one place — painters can stay busy in a modular home factory
shift after shift. They don’t have to travel from job site to job site or wait
between jobs.
 Inspectors in the factory ensure that work is done precisely to plan and
with closer tolerances than on a job site.
 Best of all, you’ll likely save money by choosing a modular or panelized
home. Here’s where the savings come in:
• There is less risk that valuable building materials will be stolen or
damaged on the construction site.
• A shorter construction time means fewer interest payments on
your construction loan.
• Design work or drawings may be included in the price of the home
package so you can avoid paying an independent designer or 
architect.
• Because you can’t make changes to the structure after it reaches
your site, you don’t rack up expensive change-order fees.
Still, a modular or panelized home may not work for you for various reasons.
Access to your site might be impossible for large delivery trucks. Your home’s
designer, architect, or contractor may prefer to work with conventional site-
built methods. The level of amenity you want for your home may just be too
high to be efficiently fulfilled by a system manufacturer.
If you’re considering a modular or panelized home:

Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

 Start with the companies’ floor plans. Review them and their list of con-
struction specifications.
 Make sure your site is accessible to the trucks that will deliver your
home’s components. Speak with your representative to make sure your
site is appropriate.
 Begin looking for a general contractor to oversee the building of your
home’s foundation, the installation of the prefabricated components,
and the final finish work. If you want to serve as your own general con-
tractor, ask the manufacturers you’re considering if they have worked
successfully with owner-builders in the past.
 Tour as many system-built homes as possible. You can see firsthand
how the finished structures look and feel.
 Inspect each company’s finished product closely. Ask questions of
people who have lived in the houses for a few years or longer. Have the
homes stood the test of time? Are the homeowners experiencing any
problems with their homes?
 Check out appropriate Web sites. For fast facts about system-built
homes, compiled by the Building Systems Council of the National
Association of Homebuilders, go to www.nahb.org/generic.aspx?
sectionID=455&genericContentID=10216.
Making a purchase
If you have your home system-built, you’ll first contact either a local builder
who has experience putting the houses together or a local system-built home
manufacturer representative. The representative or dealer you purchase your
package from will have specific assembly and construction instructions for
your contractor. Many manufacturers provide training courses for complex
systems, and in some cases, the representative also serves as a contractor.
You need to find a company that can provide you with two things: A home
design that fits your needs, or that can be altered to fit your needs, and a
home built to the level of amenities that you desire.
Not sure what design works best for you? Our advice is to study each manu-
facturer’s stock designs and then ask if the manufacturer has the ability to
customize the plans. To determine the quality of a manufacturer’s homes, ask
to see the company’s specifications. Some areas to take note of include
 Insulation: The manufacturer builds your home to meet the insulation
level required by your local building codes. If you want greater insula-
tion, talk to your manufacturer, and expect to pay more.
 Pitch of the roof: A flat pitch makes the home look more like a trailer-
park model and less like a custom home. Steeper pitches look richer.
77
Chapter 4: Defining Your House Style

 Roofing and siding materials: If a manufacturer can’t provide a certain
type of shingle or exterior finish for your walls, you can have your builder
apply the shingles after the home is on-site.
 Stairs: The standard stairs may be carpet-grade. In other words, you
need to cover the stairs with carpet. If you want exposed wood on your
stairs, ask what options are available. Again, be prepared to pay for an
upgrade.
 Types of appliances: Can the manufacturer accommodate your lifelong
desire for a commercial-size range in the kitchen and a high-end, built-in
refrigerator? Some can, but be prepared to pay extra.
 Windows: Ask about your options for windows, and be sure to see the
window units firsthand. Be sure the windows are easy to open, close,
lock, and tilt for cleaning (if that’s a feature you prefer). For more in-
depth information on comparing window quality and energy-efficiency,
visit the EnergyStar program’s Web site at www.energystar.gov/
index.cfm?c=windows_doors.pr_windows.
If you have firm ideas for your new home, make sure the manufacturer you
choose can supply what you need. For example, do you have your heart set
on a vaulted master bedroom? Because they are limited by what size compo-
nents can be delivered by truck, not every modular manufacturer can build 
a home with ceilings above 8 or 10 feet. Ask questions and be sure to look at
homes the company has previously built.
Perhaps you want to bring your own drawings to the table. Some modular
manufacturers can accommodate custom-drawn plans, but you may find that
panelized manufacturers will more readily accept plans from an architect or
independent designer.
On the line
With modular homes, workers install wiring, plumbing, ductwork, cabinetry,
and some plumbing fixtures in the factory, and also apply certain finishes,
such as paint, flooring, and countertops. After the workers finish, they shrink-
wrap the modules like giant pork-chop packages and load them onto flatbed
trucks for delivery.
Before you hit the road, Jack, be sure you know the rules. Some states limit
the weight of items that can be shipped by truck at certain times of the year.
Imagine that a truck carrying your kitchen jackknifed on an overpass in a bliz-
zard, or worse, overturned. Discuss your construction schedule and any pos-
sible restrictions with your contractor or sales representative well in advance
of your purchase.
78
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

After the house arrives at your lot, workers cut away the heavy-duty wrap-
ping from the modules, and a crane lifts the modules off the trucks and on to
the home’s foundation. Depending on its size, the home may comprise two,
three, or more modules. Under the supervision of your builder or manufac-
turer’s representative, the crew completes the steps necessary to make the
home ready for occupancy.
A modular home leaves the factory pretty close to complete. After the pieces
arrive on the construction site, the homeowners can usually move in within
just a few weeks. Make sure you’re packed and ready to move in.
Panelized homes go up in much the same way, except that the parts that are
delivered to the site are smaller and require more assembly on-site. A crane
may still be needed for lifting large wall or roof sections. After the pieces are
in place, the home is ready for interior finish work. The construction time
may vary from one system to another. Obviously, those systems that leave
the factory in more-finished states require less time and labor on-site.
Unearthing Alternative 
Construction Methods
Does a system-built home sound too buttoned-up for you? If so, then get
earthy with alternative building methods. Some of these methods are ages
old and recently rediscovered; others have become viable and more widely
available by recent technological improvements. Two different options
include
 Straw bale homes: Today, people are rediscovering the ability of straw
bale construction to create highly energy-efficient homes. After the bales
are stacked into walls, they are coated outside with an earth-based
material and inside with plaster, and then finished as any other home.
Straw bale homes usually resemble adobe homes with thick walls and
gently rounded arches. They offer their owners great efficiency and a
quiet interior. An added bonus is knowing that you created something
lasting out of a material that would normally be burned or sent to the
landfill.
In laboratory tests, the bales have resisted damage from fire, mainly
because of their density. Insects don’t seem to be a problem and mois-
ture issues aren’t of great concern as long as the bales are well dried
before construction and kept dry until they are finished on the exterior.
Check with your local municipality and lenders if a straw bale home
sounds like your cup of tea.
79
Chapter 4: Defining Your House Style

 Rammed earth homes: Like straw bale homes, rammed (or stabilized)
earth homes use a natural material to create a cozy home with thick
walls. In this type of construction, your wall contractor mixes screened
(sifted) soil with cement and water, and then pours it into wall forms
built on your site. The crew then uses pneumatic tampers to compress
the earth mixture in the form. After the mixture sets, the forms are
removed and the 18- to 24-inch walls are complete. The walls can be left
as is, colored with pigments, or sealed with stucco.
As with other building forms that create thick, solid walls, rammed earth
homes enjoy increased energy efficiency and quiet interiors. Solid, natural
material walls paired with a heating system that doesn’t require blowing
air provides an ideal home for those with heightened sensitivity to
chemicals or synthetics.
Keep in mind that although the raw materials for a rammed earth 
home — notably dirt — are widely available and, well, dirt cheap, the
labor involved adds to the home’s cost. Knowledge is the best weapon
when encountering setbacks, so visit rammed earth suppliers online or
in person and talk about your plans with homeowners and builders who
have relevant experience.
If you’re interested in an alternative building method or material for your
custom home
 Do as much research as possible. Look for magazines like Natural Home
and books such as The Art of Natural Building by Joseph F. Kennedy,
Michael Smith, and Catherine Wanek (New Society), and Alternative
Construction: Contemporary Natural Building Methods by Lynne Elizabeth
and Cassandra Adams (Wiley).
 Get help. Enlist the aid of experienced builders or suppliers.
 Attend workshops and seminars. Many producers or building schools
offer workshops and seminars, which are particularly valuable if your
home will be a do-it-yourself project. Knowing in advance if you have the
skills and persistence to tackle the job is better than finding out too late.
 Look online. Check out www.greenbuilder.com, www.thelaststraw.
org, or http://oikos.com/index.lasso for further information on an
array of alternative building methods.
Believe it or not, you can find financing for a home built with alternative
building materials. It may, however, take more legwork than finding a lender
to finance your purchase of a regular suburban tract home. Start by talking
with the company that’s helping you build the home. Most likely, the com-
pany’s previous clients have faced the same situation, and they may be able
to offer sound advice. You can also search online for lenders who frequently
make construction loans. Having complete plans for your home, information
on the building system from an experienced builder or home producer, and a
clear idea of the costs of your project can help ease a lender’s mind and make
your project that much more appealing to a loan underwriter.

Living off the grid
For some, the idea of living without public utili-
ties or supplementing those utilities with wind,
water, or solar power sounds like roughing it.
But technological advances in these alternative
power systems make it easier for people who
wouldn’t consider themselves pioneers to make
their own energy.
The use of alternative energy sources proba-
bly won’t affect your home’s style except in 
the instance of passive solar heating. Homes
designed to benefit from solar energy in this
way are carefully sited on their lots. Banks 
of windows bring sunlight into the home and
focus the warmth into the home’s heat sink —
typically a masonry wall or floor that collects
the warmth, and then slowly radiates that
warmth back into the home. Of course, if you
use active solar systems, such as panels of
solar cells for generating electricity or large
solar collectors for heating water, you’ll need to
either hide them or integrate the look into your
home design.
If you’re interested in using alternative energy
to power your home, research your choices
thoroughly. Start with books and magazines,
and then supplement your reading with visits to
the Web sites of suppliers of solar, wind, and
water energy equipment.
Although building a home powered solely by
alternative energy (called off-grid) is good for
the planet, it may cripple your checkbook:
Homes that are built off-grid aren’t eligible for
bank financing. If you need a loan, connect your
home to the grid, and then simply use your alter-
native energy system. Many people who make
their own power, but who are still connected to
the public utility grid, are actually able to “sell”
their excess power back to the utility company.
Rules and regulations on this buy-back of power
vary from region to region. For more information,

Architects and Design: Time 
Spent Is Money Saved
In This Chapter
 Using an architect
 Relying on other design resources
 Placing the house
 Making aesthetic choices
 Defining the details
D
esigning your own home is probably the reason you started on this
custom home journey in the first place. But, guess what? Designing your
own home also is the most complicated and challenging part of the process
(although at the same time it can be the most rewarding). Wondering what
the biggest mistake made in the design process is? Underestimating the time
you need and the sheer amount of decisions you need to make.
In this chapter, we assist you with the multitude of decisions and choices
that you’ll face by giving our insights from our own years of experience. We
start with the discussion of using an architect, relying on a stock plan, or
designing your new home yourself. We give you an introduction to choosing
styles and determining functionality. Finally, this chapter has lists of features
and choices to use when making the necessary decisions for your custom
home. The result is a script for you to follow in conversations with your
architect and contractor.
You’re designing your custom home project. There is no right or wrong way.
But some ways may be easier or less costly than others. Entering into the
design process with open ears and an open mind is better than resisting new
ideas. Be prepared to take extensive notes during the process because it
occurs over an extended period of time, and you may need to refer back to
what you were talking about six months ago.

Arming Yourself with an Architect
Like any other professional consultant, because you’re paying the money,
you have the right to determine how much your architect will be involved in
your home-building project. Architects can serve you in several ways. They
can take a stock plan you have seen in a magazine or on the Internet and
simply modify it to fit your needs, or they can help extract ideas from your
mind and create a whole new home to meet your dreams. Some people
simply want an architect to design a home based upon their thoughts and
needs. Others want to be fully engaged in the entire experience and use the
architect as an interpretive tool, expressing what they see completed in their
own mind.
Deciding whether you even 
need an architect
The question of whether or not you need an architect for your project boils
down to two elements: time and experience. If you’re in no hurry to move
your project forward and are willing to invest the time to figure out all the ins
and outs of the process and make the right choices, then an architect may be
unnecessary. But if you work for a living, are raising a family, or don’t have the
slightest inclination to take the time to figure out design, construction, and
building codes, then an architect will be a welcome addition to your custom
home team of professionals. Here is a list of questions you need to ask your-
self to determine if you’re up to the task of designing your own home:
 Does your state require an architect for submitted plans?
 Will your project require extensive structural engineering?
 Are you extremely picky and difficult when making decisions?
 Are you lacking in aesthetic vision?
 Do you have difficulty understanding home functionality?
If you answer yes to any of these questions, then you’ll probably gain value
from an architect. Despite their seemingly high cost, architects can save you
time and money by bringing their experience to the table. Their insights on
functionality and government bureaucracy can save you months of time and
thousands of dollars.
The biggest question to ask yourself is whether you have the confidence to
take this project to its completion. You may prefer to dabble or play with 
the design aspects, but an architect is a true professional who has spent
years becoming an expert at home design. If you were to go alone without 
84
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

an architect, you might spend a great deal of time and energy gathering the
information that already sits at the architect’s fingertips.
Finding the right architect
Locating an architect is as easy as picking up the phone book or searching on
the Internet. The hard part is figuring out which architect is right for you. You
have several approaches you can take to find the right architect:
 You can drive through neighborhoods of custom homes looking for
houses that strike your fancy. Don’t be afraid to knock on the door and
ask for the architect’s phone number. Most people are happy to share
the information while you’re flattering their home.
 If you’re lucky enough to have many friends with custom homes, you
can ask for referrals from them. What are friends for?
 You can hit the Web. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) has a
list of its members by location at www.aia.org. Click on the “Architect
Finder” option, enter your zip code, and select the “A Home for Yourself”
building type to find architects in your area.
Now that you have a list of prospects, you need to compare them. Cost is
usually the first comparison but by no means the most important. When
choosing the right architect, look for someone that fits the needs of your par-
ticular project and working style. You may want someone who manages the
whole process or perhaps will work with you in a teamlike manner. Plan to
have several discussions with two or three different architects so you can
choose the right one for you. Here are the important issues to address in
those discussions:
 Aesthetics: You need to see if the architect can create something that
suits your taste. Ask to see many of her prior designs. Ask for introduc-
tions to the owners. Go to the completed houses and see if the floor plans
make sense and are comfortable for you. If you don’t like the homes she
previously designed, chances are you won’t like a new one either. A good
architect is also a good listener. Look for someone whose taste is similar
to yours and who will design what you’re looking for. You want your new
home to be a reflection of you — not a monument to the architect.
 Experience: What’s the point in hiring an expert who knows less than
you do? You want an architect that has designed many custom homes
and is familiar with the process. A commercial architect who specializes
in office buildings may be looking for the next new challenge, but his
lack of residential experience could create problems for you down the
line with builders and planning departments. An architect needs to have
a minimum of 15 custom homes under her belt to be considered for your
project.
85
Chapter 5: Architects and Design: Time Spent Is Money Saved

 Local knowledge: Every municipality and planning department is differ-
ent in the way they process custom home plans. Some are more bureau-
cratic than others. Much of the architect’s time may be spent working
your plans through the system. If you’re looking for exceptions (vari-
ances) from the established local guidelines, you could have a fight on
your hands. This fight could cost you time and money. An architect with
local knowledge and experience can save you from costly battles and
exercises in futility. (Check out Chapter 6 for more information on local
design guidelines.)
Managing the architecture process
If you’re lucky, you may find the perfect architect — someone who is atten-
tive to your needs and makes the process easy. In a perfect world, the archi-
tect would come up with the perfect design first time out with a minimum of
communication. Sadly, wake up and smell the coffee: You don’t live in a per-
fect world. Most custom home architects are small businesses; they’re shoe-
string operations without huge profit margins. They tend to be overloaded
with work and less concerned for your time frames than you may be. The
more successful the architectural firm, the busier it will be. You need to
manage your expectations and the process.
Set your initial meeting as a getting-to-know-you session to get a feeling for
how you’ll work together and to see if you have a common vision for the pro-
ject. After everything gets going, stay proactive in driving the process. (To
stay on top of everything, you need to call the architect regularly to check
progress and set the next appointment.) After all, it is your house and your
time frame. The architect’s job is to present you with information and deci-
sions to be made. All the decisions relate to four basic elements:
 Aesthetics
 Cost
 Quality
 Time
Get the facts from the architect and conduct your own research. The more
you take responsibility for educating yourself and making some decisions
upfront, the greater chance you have of eliminating problems, saving some
money, and getting the home you’re looking for. Use your architect as the
high-paid consultant that he is and make sure to set a regular meeting sched-
ule with him. Doing so helps you get a better handle on the time and dollars
involved to design the project. Setting a regular schedule also reduces the
panic or inquiry calls that can cost you more money and frustrate you during
the process.
86
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

What does all this cost?
The architect has the worst position of all the partners you have in the
custom home process — the first position. Most people expect to put out a
substantial chunk of money for the building lot, but the five-figure check
you’ll write to the architect is probably the first one you signed that didn’t
get you a big hunk of steel with tires and headlights. Don’t let the price tag
scare you; during this stage isn’t the time to skimp. If you’ve done a good job
of budgeting (see Chapter 2), you’ll easily make up the initial costs later in
the build.
Architects generally charge in one of three ways (or a combination of all
three for various stages of the project):
 On an overall percentage of the build
 On an hourly basis
 On a fixed-price basis
The following sections provide some vital information you need to know
about each billing program and which one is better for you.
Percentage of the build
The first way of billing is on an overall percentage of the build. This method
can range anywhere from 3 to 10 percent of the total project costs, not
including land. So a typical $500,000 custom project may cost you $15,000 to
$50,000 in architect fees for the plans and the architect’s time in getting the
plans approved. In some high-end projects, architects may charge as much as
20 percent, equaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. This method doesn’t
have a set percentage, so you need to evaluate the value of the architect’s
services that you receive in exchange for your hard-earned money.
Hourly basis
The second way of billing is on an hourly basis. Hourly rates vary widely
depending on the firm you engage, its experience and reputation, and its
location. (A firm in Los Angeles is probably going to cost significantly more
than one in Des Moines.) Expect to pay anywhere from $50 to $350 per hour,
depending on these factors. You’ll pay the architect for the following list of
items to get you to the permitting stage:
 Construction documents
 Landscape plan
 Mechanical and electrical drawings (see Chapter 6)
 Plan copies ($4 per page)
87
Chapter 5: Architects and Design: Time Spent Is Money Saved

 Soils report
 Structural engineering (see Chapter 6)
 Surveyor
 Time for the architect and associates
You can pay all these items directly through the architect, or you can pay for
them separately on your own. Project costs can be more clearly broken down
into time and materials (expenses), and they’ll vary depending on where you
live and on your project’s scope. The consultants and types of reports they
can generate vary due to the scope of work and the requirements of govern-
ing bodies, such as planning and building departments.
When paying by the hour, time is money. Use the architect’s time for providing
information and education. Keep all discussions or disagreements between
spouses or partners at home, not in the architect’s office while the clock is
ticking. Absorb as much information as possible and take detailed notes to
review on your own time. The more you prepare for the meetings with the
architect, the more efficient those meetings will be. Shorter meetings mean
less billable hours and less money out of your pocket.
88
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 
Considering the design-build combo
A number of companies today design the homes
and build them for you. Such companies are
called design-build firms in the industry. Many
custom home companies have added architects
to their staffs so they can provide you with a
seamless process from start to finish. The main
advantage of this approach is consistent com-
munication throughout the process. The builder
has experience building what the architect
designs and the architect designs a home
based on the builder’s expertise. You can take
advantage of the cost savings attached to using
one firm for both the design and the build, but
you need to compare the price and work with
that of independent architects and contractors
before making a decision. You can find an
annual list of leading design-build firms online
at www.designbuildbusiness.com.
Just because they handle both design and build
aspects through one firm doesn’t mean you can
reduce your investigation for finding the right
partners for your project. Design-build can be
something of a conflict of interest because it
doesn’t involve any competitive bidding in the
process. Not only that, but the project’s ultimate
quality is tied up in the firm’s ability to both
design and build in a cost-effective standard.
Pick a design-build firm using the same criteria
we suggest for picking an architect in “Finding
the right architect” section earlier in this chap-
ter, and investigate the builder portion of the
firm using our suggestions in Chapter 2.

Fixed-price basis
The third way of billing is on a fixed-price basis, where your architect quotes
you a firm, all-inclusive price for the entire job. On one hand, this option can
be beneficial to you because you know exactly what your architect will cost,
but an architect may underestimate and you may suffer when he feels he has
already put in too much time.
Always discuss the price with the architect before you sign a contract. Get a
complete estimate upfront with a detailed breakdown of expenses. Set a maxi-
mum price with progress payments based upon certain milestones such as the
preliminary design and design review approval (discussed in Chapter 6). Keep
the communication open along the way so you don’t encounter any surprises.
Looking at Architect Alternatives
Not everyone uses an architect when building a custom home for several 
reasons. For example, aside from money being a factor, you may have 
design skills yourself that you wish to exercise. No problem! Technology has
improved the choices for designing a custom home. You can also utilize alter-
native consultants if you want to save on architecture fees. These resources
require additional responsibility on your part and may still have additional
costs depending upon the design requirements of your local government.
The following sections explore architect alternatives.
Published floor plans — Picking 
a home from books or online
You can purchase thousands of plans from magazines and online resources —
many of them quite good. The choice is endless. The magazine shelves at book-
stores are stocked with more than ten new magazines every month; these plan
books have houses to fit every size and budget. You can buy the preliminary
floor plan and elevations for a few hundred dollars. You can also purchase
complete building plans including the structural drawings from these sources
for a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. (Check out Chapter 6 for a com-
plete explanation of the differences in types of plans.) Even if you don’t buy the
full set of plans, the magazines and online sites make for good conversation
starters with your family and architect. Here are a few of our favorite Internet
resources for plans:

Chapter 5: Architects and Design: Time Spent Is Money Saved

Although buying plans may seem like a less expensive approach than using
an architect, it depends heavily on your situation. Many of these plans don’t
include the foundation or full structural drawings required for permitting.
The plans need to meet all the design and code regulations for your area, and
if they don’t, you’ll have to hire an architect or engineer to make any changes
necessary for permitting. Depending on those costs, you may or may not
save money by using the stock set of plans compared to hiring an architect to
design your home. Buying plans from a book can, however, be a great option
if you’re building on a flat lot with liberal design guidelines. Otherwise you
may be wasting your money.
Software programs — Designing 
your own plans
A number of software programs exist for individuals wishing to design their
own home on a computer. Many of these software tools make it easy with
templates for rooms and architecture choices. For less than a few hundred
dollars, these programs can be excellent tools for discovering the basics of
home design — saving you time and money with your architect even if you
don’t design the entire home. If you find yourself with the time and skill to
design the whole project, you can save significant money. Here are our
favorite software choices available online or at any computer store:
 www.smartdraw.com
 Better Homes and Gardens Designer Suite
 3D Home Architect
The same issues apply when designing your home using software as with
store-bought plans — the need for foundational engineering and structural
drawings. However, in this case you’re now responsible for all the structural
elements of the house construction. Make sure to find a structural engineer
you can work with before heading down this path. You’ll need to search the
phone book or ask architects or local building departments for referrals to
find a good structural engineer. Otherwise your new home may become your
design nightmare.
Hiring a home designer
You can also choose from a growing number of talented home designers who
aren’t licensed architects. They offer you the possibility of significant cost
savings in the design phase of building your new home. They don’t have the
architectural training or certification, so they bill at a lower rate than archi-
tects. These designers may draft the house design for you from scratch or
90
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

help you determine materials. No standard for the services they provide 
exists, so you need to ask them what part of the process they will provide.
Treat them as you would any architect. Investigate their credentials and experi-
ence. Discuss with them the differences in the services they will provide from
architects and other designers and find out where the gaps exist. The best way
to find these designers is in local newspapers and design magazines.
Many states limit designers from designing anything more than a bathroom,
kitchen, or single-story remodel without the plans being approved by an 
engineer with an engineer’s stamp before obtaining permits. In addition, a
designer may not be aware of code complications in a more extensive pro-
ject, creating more cost to fix the plans even with the engineer’s assistance.
Placing the House on the Lot
Before you start designing your new home, you need to figure out how it will
sit on the lot. Lot placement is important because it allows you to take advan-
tage of views, topography, and amenities. Some lots may have special features
or limitations that make this decision a simple one. Others that are large and
flat may have limitless possibilities. We lay out some of the biggest considera-
tions in this section.
Foundation issues
If your house is on a slope, then the engineers are going to give you limited
choices in how to place the house on the lot. You’ll have to follow very spe-
cific requirements for grading, piers, or other specialized foundations. If your
topography is far from flat, you may want to consult an engineer early in the
design process. You can do this through an architect or consult the phone
book.
Constructing a foundation can be complex, and you need to discuss it with
the architect or engineer during the house design process. To understand the
specific process for hillside foundations, look in Chapter 12.
Which orientation is best? 
North, south, east, or west
There are no right or wrong answers for picking direction placement for your
home — it’s a matter of preference. Some people like the sun in the morning
and some in the afternoon. If you’re building in Seattle or Vancouver, the sun
may not be a factor at all.

In North America, the sun shines from the south so a southern exposure
means that the sun will shine on the front of your home for most of the day. A
south-facing house also means your backyard may get little sun until midday,
when the sun is high enough in the sky to shine over your house. Figure 5-1
shows the relative angles for exposure and house placement.
Too little sun can make the house seem dark and dank. Too much sun can be
energy inefficient and weather the house prematurely. You need to consider
other directional factors, such as wind, noise, and city lights, that can nega-
tively impact your home. To decide on the right direction, ask yourself the
following questions:
 What are sun patterns where I live?
 What is my preferred daily temperature?
 How bright do I want my home?
 How much sun do I need in each yard?

 Where does the wind normally come from?
 Where is the closest major city?
 Are there any noise issues in any of the directions?
After you have considered these questions, determining which direction will
benefit your lifestyle and then designing doors, windows, and decks to face
that optimum direction should be easier.
Taking advantage of natural elements
In some suburban neighborhoods, the most natural thing about your lot 
may be the hippie couple living next door. However many people building
custom homes have some natural features that can add to their home’s
beauty. Following are some natural elements to consider in the design and
placement of the home:
 Foliage: If your lot is in a rural area with plenty of natural landscaping,
consider natural growth patterns for beauty and easy maintenance. High
trees and bushes can afford you privacy; however, clearing tall brush
and cutting back trees may give you unexpected views.
 Mountains: If you have a larger lot in a mountainous area, decide to be
on top of the peak or shaded at the foothill. Or you may simply prefer to
stare at the neighboring giant.
 Rocks: Small groups of stones or even large boulders can make for a dra-
matic effect depending on where you place your house. In some rural
and mountainous areas, designers have built spectacular homes with
boulders in the house making the home unique and saving the cost of
demolition.
 Trees: Trees provide shade and beauty. They can also be a nuisance
with dropping leaves and fruit. Like boulders, some old magnificent
trees can be incorporated into the home’s design.
 View: The right view can significantly increase your home’s value and
beauty. Try to optimize views for rooms where romance, relaxation, and
entertainment occur.
 Water: People pay premiums to live by the ocean or near lakes and
rivers. Take advantage of these aquascapes, but be wary of flooding
issues by checking flood maps with your engineer.
Custom home projects tend to run smoother and cheaper when they’re
designed to take advantage of natural elements. Reconstructing landscape
and waterways or removing huge trees and boulders can be costly and in
some cases environmentally damaging. Look for ways to take advantage of
what was naturally provided.
93
Chapter 5: Architects and Design: Time Spent Is Money Saved

When making significant changes to the elements, work with your engineer to
create proper site drainage and insure the soil will remain stable with few
erosion problems. Otherwise your house could slide down the hill or be
buried by mudslides.
Planning the Size and 
Shape of Your Home
Even though building a custom home implies you do it your way, few people
actually have enough money to put everything they want into their first pro-
ject. Unless you recently won the lottery or invented the cure for the common
cold (congratulations if you fall within either of those two categories!), you’ll
probably have some limitations on what you can build. Also, unless you’re in a
position where money has no bearing, you’ll want the house to maintain its
value and potentially appreciate.
So you now have three gods to appease:
 Desire: You want to build a house you want for your needs.
 Taste: You want the house to have aesthetic appeal, particularly to you.
 Value: You want to make sure the house is built in such a way to main-
tain its investment potential.
You must carefully consider all three of them in the design process.

Nothing is as lovely as a tree
One very expensive cost for a new home can be
trees. In new developments, the land is bare
and the cost of transplanting a mature tree can
be as much as $20,000. The expense of mature
trees is the reason why it takes decades for
neighborhoods to have tall trees. If you’re lucky
enough to have mature trees on your property,
take advantage of them in your house place-
ment. In some locations certain trees may be
protected, such as live oaks in California (the
state tree). You can get plenty of information
about types of trees and how to protect them
from the National Arbor Day Foundation (www.
arborday.org).

Size matters — Figuring 
the right square footage
For reference, you’ll often see square feet represented by a number with a
symbol so that it looks like this: 2,000®|. Three major factors dictate the
appropriate square footage for your home:
 You need to establish your family’s needs. For example, do you have
elderly parents living with you who need a downstairs bedroom or does
your wife want her own separate walk-in closet in the master bedroom?
We address this topic more in-depth later in this chapter in “Ten general
floor-plan considerations.”
 You need to adhere to zoning limitations or covenants (neighborhood
guidelines). Many design rules set limits on how big and how small of a
house can be built on a particular lot. You may also encounter limits on
the house’s ground floor. These guidelines may impact other decisions
such as the need for more than one story to meet your square footage
needs. (See Chapter 3 for more on zoning regulations and covenants.)
 Your need to keep in line with your budget. In Chapter 2, we give you 
a method for determining a budget as well as a way to define dollars per
square foot. You’ll need to design a house that not only fits your family
and the lot but also fits your budget as well. Many of these calculations
go in circles, so start with the house you want and see if it fits based
upon local estimates for building costs, which you can get by talking to 
a few contractors. If the going rate seems to be $100 per foot and your
budget allows for $300,000, then a 3,500 square foot house won’t work
and you need to adjust your design.
The more square footage you build, the more the house will cost, so effi-
ciency is important. At the same time, skimping on rooms can reduce utility
and make for unpleasant living. Here are some minimum recommendations
for typical room sizes to give you a general idea of what you need:
 Bedroom: 100 to 200 square feet
 Dining room: 100 to 300 square feet
 Family room: 300 to 800 square feet
 Full bathroom: 60 to 150 square feet
 Great room: 400 to 1,000 square feet
 Kitchen: 150 to 350 square feet
 Living room: 300 to 800 square feet
 Master bedroom: 200 to 600 square feet
 Staircases: 100 square feet per story
95
Chapter 5: Architects and Design: Time Spent Is Money Saved

Calculate the total square feet of the rooms you have picked. You can figure
on adding another 10 percent to account for hallways, cabinets, and closets.
This total can give you a basis from which to start your estimate. Other fac-
tors to consider may include unfinished space like basements and garages.
Garages can vary based upon size, but each car needs roughly 200 square
feet. Generally, a basement matches the square footage of the first floor. If
you’re not going to finish the walls and flooring in your basement or garage,
then you don’t count it in your livable square footage, but you’ll need to rec-
oncile the cost when you get your estimates from contractors. You can esti-
mate its cost now by multiplying the square footage by the dollars per square
foot and dividing by 2.
Designing for resale — Create a 
house everyone wants to buy
When designing your home, you want to remember that a unique house can
create difficulty even in a custom home — particularly thinking ahead to the
future and your new home’s resale value. For whatever reason, most people
prefer houses that are familiar, functional, and comfortable, which means
many people may find your home to be a nice place to visit but they wouldn’t
want to live there. If buyers aren’t interested in your house, lenders will shy
away as well making financing difficult. (We discuss the issues of marketabil-
ity in greater detail in Chapter 7 and the lender’s perspective in Chapter 9.)
Just because you want to design your house with resale in mind doesn’t
mean the house has to be generic. A number of proven theories in home
design create functionality and appeal yet allow for uniqueness. Talk to local
real estate agents and your architect about the expectations of most buyers
in your neighborhood. You don’t have to build your new home exactly for
them, but at least you can consider them in your design decisions as you
move through the process.
Exterior styles — Considering 
architecture examples
Some local guidelines require specific architecture styles for the neighbor-
hood. Some design review committees may actually dictate the type of siding
to be used and colors to be painted. We discuss these committees at length
in Chapter 6. The key is to pick something that suits the neighborhood and
your taste. You can choose from many examples of exteriors in plan books
and on the Internet.
96
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

Knowing the size of the home isn’t enough to get a handle on costs. Not all
exterior designs cost the same. The more complex your exterior is, the more
it will cost in framing (see Chapter 13). Architectural extras such as peaked
roofs, dormers, and balconies can increase costs. Exterior materials have an
impact on cost as well. If the neighborhood guidelines allow it, you’ll have to
choose between siding, stone, or stucco as well as roof material choices like
slate, tile, or metal. We discuss these material choices extensively in Chapter
14. Do your research on these materials now by checking prices and dis-
cussing options with your architect.
Designing Your Home’s Interior
Although design review committees may have a lot to say regarding your
home’s exterior, the interior choices totally belong to you. The floor plan
determines where everything is located in your house. A well thought-out
floor plan can make for a comfortable house whereas a bad floor plan can
create problems and inconvenience.
Several components, such as doorframes and hallway passages, require you
to make decisions about style, size, and location. For example, choosing an
open feel in a house requires open passages and larger hallways whereas pri-
vacy needs may push you to opt for smaller cozier options. These decisions
impact the feel of the house and, ultimately, your enjoyment of it.
Other interior choices on details such as corners and finish trim can add sig-
nificant themes to the look and feel of your home’s interior. You can find hun-
dreds of interior ideas in the multitude of home magazines on the rack at the
bookstore. Interior Design magazine is excellent for ideas and, of course, you
can always find plenty of pictures in the classic Architectural Digest and on
the Internet. 
The best way we have found to search for ideas on the Web is to go to www.
google.com, click on the “Images” button, and search terms such as interior
architecture and interior design. You’ll get hundreds of pictures to look at for
ideas.
Ten general floor-plan considerations
Whether you’re designing the house or using an architect, you need to be
aware of elements of good home design. We lay out these elements in this
section so you can incorporate them into your thought process while design-
ing your home. Our experience shows that most design problems in the flow
97
Chapter 5: Architects and Design: Time Spent Is Money Saved

and functionality of the house result from not addressing one of the following
areas:
 Lifestyle: To be comfortable and relaxed, your home has to fit your
lifestyle. Not every home works for every family. Are you a family living
in a formal style? If so, then maybe you need a formal living room and
dining room. Do you gather around the kitchen? Do you entertain a lot?
Then a home with a big family room open to the kitchen may work for
you. Determine how you want to live and design a plan that fits the
lifestyle you enjoy.
 Foot traffic: Try to project how people move through the house on a
daily basis. Look for problems in the traffic patterns. Some problems
may include issues like tight hallways and people crossing through work
areas of the kitchen, formal areas, or TV-viewing areas. (You don’t really
want Little Johnny racing through your dinner party in his Spiderman
tighty-whities to get to the bathroom.)
 Noise: This factor can be huge in multilevel houses. Remember that bed-
rooms are for sleeping, so any noise above, below, or next to a bedroom
can make for a restless night. Consider carefully the placement of noise-
generating rooms like the garage, home office, laundry room, and bath-
rooms. (For example, if you have a large family, you don’t want to put
the main bathroom by your bedroom. The last thing you want to hear is
a flushing toilet all night.)
 Storage: You can never have enough storage space in any house. 
The longer you live somewhere, the more stuff you acquire. What you
really need is plenty of useful places to put it. Create ample-size closets,
pantries, and cabinet areas. And make sure your storage areas are con-
venient without being obtrusive.
 Door placement: Every room needs a door, but it needs to open in such
a way that it doesn’t bang against walls, obstruct other doorways, or
block closets or windows. Consider the placement and opening space
necessary for each door in the house.
 Window placement: What’s the point of having a view if your windows
don’t take advantage of it? Other window considerations include pri-
vacy, not being blocked by doors, or looking out on the garbage area.
Put plenty of thought into the size and placement of your windows to
the world.
 Accessibility: Can you get to the outside from everywhere that makes
sense? Are bedrooms and bathrooms easy to access from common
areas? Make sure you can easily access important rooms without creat-
ing unnecessary obstacles.
 Convenience: We can think of nothing worse than having to traipse
halfway across the house with food from the kitchen to serve in the
formal dining room. Think about where you may be unloading your gro-
ceries or how to get the food from your barbecue. Bathroom placement
is another major convenience consideration.
98
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

 Utility: Many homes have nooks and cubbies that serve no useful pur-
pose. You’ll pay to build any square footage whether or not it’s useable
space. Make sure all areas serve a purpose.
 Future expansion: Perhaps your new house is perfect for all your needs
at this time, but someday your needs may change. Think about how you
might expand the house should that occur.
Special considerations room by room
We realize many of you are hoping in this section for a detailed list of deci-
sions on design in the various rooms of the house. But if we made all the
design choices for you, then your new home wouldn’t be custom.
In this process of custom building your home, all the decisions are yours –
you’re in charge. Our job is to share our insights on the questions. In this sec-
tion we give you questions and suggestions to analyze when designing the
rooms. You can use it like a checklist. Then you’ll have a good basis for con-
versation with your architect or designer. For those of you designing your
own house, use this section as a template for decision making.
A cook’s tour — Kitchen elements
Isn’t it funny how every party eventually ends up in the kitchen — often one of
the smallest rooms in the house? Think about how much time you spend in the
kitchen. Food is a critical part of family culture, and you want your kitchen to
reflect it. Think about placement for breakfast eating areas. Where are people
going to collect and connect? Although the kitchen is usually the most expen-
sive room in the house, the kitchen also brings the best return on money spent
in any home. For greater detail on kitchens, you can read Kitchen Remodeling
For Dummies by Donald R. Prestly (Wiley). Here are our tips for assessing your
basic kitchen needs.
Cabinets and counters
Your cabinetry sets your kitchen’s tone as well as establishes its conve-
nience. You have three major issues to consider with cabinetry and counters:
 Layout: You need to make kitchen layout choices in the floor plan
including the specific layout of the counters and island. Put your time
into the kitchen design early because making cabinetry and counter
changes can be costly after materials have been ordered. Walk through
as many kitchens as you can at open houses to see what works well for
your lifestyle. The general rule is that you don’t want to have to walk
food over great distances during preparation. You also want to make
sure you have adequate room for those appliances you’ve been lusting
after as well as ventilation for your cooking needs.
99
Chapter 5: Architects and Design: Time Spent Is Money Saved

 Cosmetics: The kitchen design is likely to stay the same for a long time.
You can always change the look of other rooms by painting the walls,
but you’re less likely to change the kitchen cabinets in the near future
for simple aesthetics. Cabinetry is expensive. Make sure you have
chosen a style and color that will suit the house’s style for decades to
come. If you get bored easily, consider paint-grade cabinets so you can
change the look just like walls.
When making a decision about countertops, you have many choices to
consider, but it often comes down to a choice of beauty versus practical-
ity. Tile can be cost effective and attractive, but grout can be difficult to
clean. Granite or marble is gorgeous, but expensive and harder to main-
tain. You can choose from many suitable manmade alternatives such as
Corian that will last almost as long as tile or stone. You can even choose
from other surfaces, such as laminate, wood, zinc, copper, stainless
steel, and even concrete, that have been used for utility and a unique
look. Do your homework to determine which surface is best for you and
your cooking style.
 Size: The size of your counters and cabinetry and how much storage
space you’ll need depends upon your cooking style and equipment.
Many people like to display their pots in pot racks and others prefer a
kitchen that hides everything cuisine related.
The choice of shelving and inserts requires much thought about your
lifestyle and needs in the kitchen. Think about the way you like to cook in the
kitchen. Make an inventory of all your cooking tools and machines. Then plan
in advance and make a map of where they might live. If you’re a kitchen
gadget-hound that needs everything at your fingertips, then you’ll want
plenty of counter space and electrical sockets for your juicer, meat slicer, and
George Foreman grill.

Feng shui — The art of balance
Feng shui has had a huge impact on design,
especially when it comes to housing. Feng shui
is an ancient Chinese system of philosophy, sci-
ence, and art. Its purpose is to connect people
with heaven and earth. It’s based upon the inter-
action of the environment with energy and
intention. The feng shui philosophy seeks to
obtain a balance between opposites in the envi-
ronment. So, for example, feng shui philoso-
phies can determine room placement, window
and door location, and so on. If you make a feng
shui mistake, to maintain good feng shui, you
may need to create fixes such as hanging coins
or mirrors to remove imbalance.
Many people find feng shui suitable for creating
their own interior design guidelines and even
necessary for resale if building in a city with a
large Asian American population. You can find
out more about feng shui in Feng Shui For
Dummies written by David Daniel Kennedy
(Wiley).

Appliances
You can probably expect your oven, stove, refrigerator, and dishwasher to
last a minimum of ten years. More and more people are choosing cosmeti-
cally matching suites of appliances that are matched and installed. Home
shows are the best place to find the appliances that will suit your budget and
your cooking needs. Pick the largest and best you can afford. You can get
great information and compare appliances at www.consumerreports.org.
Beware of deciding on industrial equipment. Some stoves designed for
restaurant use have different power requirements and safety standards than
consumer-designed equipment. Many companies, such as Viking, Wolf, and
GE, make commercial-grade equipment designed for consumers.
Flooring
Aside from its appearance, the main consideration when selecting kitchen
flooring is to remember that it gets the most traffic and requires the most
cleaning. Carpet collects dirt and crumbs and so does tile grout. Smooth tile
can be pretty, but every dish you ever drop will smash to smithereens. Gaining
popularity are waterproof-composite floors such as Pergo or WilsonArt. These
floors come in a variety of textures and styles impressively looking like slate or
wood, making for a well-designed alternative to linoleum or vinyl. Many archi-
tects believe that the best surfaces for kitchens are wood or stone.
Bathroom considerations
After the kitchen, bathrooms are the next most expensive rooms in the house.
The labor necessary for all that electrical, plumbing, and tile work adds up
quickly. Plus you only have to create one kitchen, whereas you may have mul-
tiple bathrooms. Each one can rival the Taj Mahal if you want. You can find
specific details on designing good bathrooms in Bathroom Remodeling For

Custom or prefab?
A big debate rages on about custom cabinetry
versus units that are made in factories. The pre-
fabricated companies claim quality control is far
better and you can’t beat the price. Today’s
technology allows for tremendous customiza-
tion of prefab components suiting most situa-
tions adequately. However if you’re looking to
create something worthy of the museum of
modern art, then you need a custom cabinet
maker. Custom cabinetry can cost more than
three times the amount of prefab, but they make
better use of your kitchen space because
they’re designed to fit exactly. The good news?
These artisans can create incredible pieces of
curvy-grainy-spectacular-laminated art that will
be the envy of kitchen guests for decades.

Dummies by Gene Hamilton and Katie Hamilton (Wiley). Here are the major
considerations for the bathroom:
 Size: A full bath has a sink, a toilet, and a bathtub/shower. For a three-
quarters bath, take out the tub; a room with only a sink and toilet is a
half bath or powder room. Decide what is necessary for each designated
area. Master suites and guest live-in areas generally require more space
with full amenities.
 Surface: Tile has the cost attractiveness as well as decorative versatility,
but grout can be difficult to keep clean. If using pedestal sinks, you can
save on counter work. Complete prefabricated cabinet and counter units
are also available for less formal cost-effective bathrooms.
 Ventilation: Most exhaust fans are installed for code but serve little pur-
pose. Decide on your most desired form of ventilation. An open window
still serves as the most popular and efficient. Be alert to sightlines for
privacy from neighbors.
 Luxury: Big sweeping claw-foot tubs, Jacuzzi tubs, built-in saunas, steam
showers, and the like are available to make your master bathroom your
slice of heaven. Many of these amenities need to be installed early in the
process and require high maintenance, which can be annoying and
costly. Make these choices early and research to see which pieces
appear relaxing but are really more trouble than they’re worth.
Bedrooms and home offices
Most people don’t designate between guestrooms, den, office, or workout
rooms because these rooms change based upon the usage of the family living
there. The most versatile designs give these rooms easy access to bathrooms
and equal appeal as the design allows.
The master bedroom is your reward for paying for this project. You want it 
to have plenty of room for relaxation with a great view for those romantic
moments. A touch of privacy is desirable, so placement of the master bedroom
away from other bedrooms and heavy traffic areas helps provide seclusion.
Also, plenty of room for closet space is a required necessity for shopaholics.
Aside from the master bedroom, the other bedrooms need to be designed for
optimum utility. Take advantage of light and views where you can and make
sure each room has adequate storage space. Each wall needs to have at least
two electrical sockets to accommodate technology.
Closets can gain greater clothes capacity through closet organizers. A wide
variety of companies today manufacture design systems and materials for
creating efficient closets that hold significant amounts of clothes, shoes, 
and stuff. To get an idea of available options, check out www.california
closets.com or for you do-it-yourselfers, try www.closetmaid.com.
102
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

Dining and entertaining
Dining rooms and family rooms often center around food and need to have
reasonable access to the kitchen. Decide whether a television is a critical
part of your food time; otherwise you may find yourself eating on TV trays in
your family room. If you want a home theater, understand that it’ll have its
own special needs in terms of acoustics and technology. You can start that
research with Home Theater For Dummies by Danny Briere and Pat Hurley
(Wiley).
The biggest mistake we have seen in entertaining rooms is people wasting
money on built-in furniture. For storage, your needs will change — and so will
the furniture. Built-in cabinets in dining rooms can go out of style or create
furniture placement problems. Building furniture around TVs and stereos has
proven to be a bigger waste of money as the technology changes make TV
styles obsolete every seven to ten years. For example, yesterday’s bulky pro-
jection TV has given way to the compact, wall-mounted flat screen, making
large cabinets useless and cumbersome.
Running water will be an important consideration for entertaining. Any rooms
with a wet bar need running water, drainage, and power for a dishwasher and
the all-important blender for daiquiris and margaritas. Additional cabinetry
may be necessary as well.
What’s in a garage
Some people may consider the garage as only a home for their vehicles.
However, other people view their garage as a workshop and storage unit.
Your garage can serve all these purposes with a little planning.
When designing your garage, think about storage access as well as the space.
You want to get to everything while avoiding obstacle courses or throwing out
your back. Consider dumbwaiters for storage above. If your space includes a
workshop, take into account ventilation and noise. You may add extra fans and
insulate with soundproofing, which adds to your comfort in extreme weather.
Make these choices early on so you can plan for power and water needs
accordingly.
The Devil Is in the Details
Earlier in this chapter we discuss basics for the house, but really the little
details will make this house something to cherish. For those of you who love
detail work, these projects are just what you’re looking for to personalize
your new home. If you don’t love detail work, take some time to get organized
because you can’t leave out anything. If you’re completely detail-challenged,
you can pay an architect or a designer to help you through this process. 
103
Chapter 5: Architects and Design: Time Spent Is Money Saved

Many people choose to leave the details to the contractor, but doing so often
leads to misunderstandings on types of materials and costs late in the
process. Avoid the headache. Make the decisions in advance and communi-
cate with your contractor what you want.

Make all your decisions now — 
Allowance is a dirty word
Be prepared to put a lot of time into the material selection process. You’ll
have to make all those decisions at some point. It’s never a question of how
much time you’ll have to spend on this shopping process; it’s merely a matter
of when you’ll do it. Our recommendation is to select materials as early in the
process as possible.
Many people spend less time on the small details during the design process
and defer them until their home’s basics are erected. They take their plans to
the contractors who bid based upon estimates for the finish materials they
call allowances. Doing so is a recipe for disaster. Contractors make their own
decisions about the quality of materials you want and their assumptions may
not be accurate. Also, you may not like what they have chosen and it may be
too late to get what you really want.
In our experience, putting off the shopping for materials until the end of the
project is the No. 1 reason for projects going over budget! Spend time at the
beginning to make the decisions or pay your architect extra money if you’re
using one. You need to pick out every hinge, fixture, and appliance before you
get price estimates for your project. This way you insure that all bids from
105
Chapter 5: Architects and Design: Time Spent Is Money Saved

subcontractors are equal, and you can be sure of the availability of materials.
Doing so also removes surprises and gives you the most accurate financial
picture.
The Internet is an awesome place to find materials prices and even unique
hardware. Just go to www.google.com and type in “hinges” or “doorknobs”
(or whatever you’re looking for), and you’ll be delighted with the many
choices available. You can even buy antique lamps and hardware in a cost-
effective manner at auction sites such as www.ebay.com! For a more hands-
on experience, you can go to showrooms, such as Ikea (www.ikea.com) or
Home Depot Expo (www.expo.com), to see kitchens and bathrooms and get 
a feel for functionality. 
Energy efficiency — Saving the 
earth (and your money!)
We can think of several areas in your home that you can enhance to conserve
energy and be more environmentally friendly. We list a few here and provide
additional resources in Chapter 22.
 Doors and windows: Today, advancements with double-pane windows
and gas-filled panels reduce the ability of glass to transfer energy. Check
out companies like Marvin Windows at www.marvin.com, Pella at www.
pella.com, and Anderson at www.andersonwindows.com for the latest
achievements.
 Insulation: A tight house is an efficient house (but keep in mind that 
a house that is too airtight can be an unhealthy house). Houses need
proper ventilation so the air stays fresh and you don’t breathe your own
carbon dioxide. You can research or discuss with your architect meth-
ods and materials that provide maximum insulation at a reasonable cost.
In extreme environments, insulation will be the No. 1 factor for energy
savings.
 Energy-efficient appliances: Many manufacturers make lines that focus
specifically on energy savings. Many local utility companies offer
rebates for choosing appliances with lower energy ratings.
 Solar power: Many people have saved money by supplementing their
energy with solar panels. The technology has improved since people
started using solar power in the 1970s. Panels have become smaller 
and lower profile. Many options are available through sources on the
Internet.

 Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system: Over-
estimating the cost of HVAC happens often because everyone wants a
more efficient air system, a reduction in noise, and comfort, especially
when the weather is extreme. Larger systems may cost more, but you
typically can make up the extra cost in savings when the energy bill
comes around.
Considering technology options
Technology has never been as much a part of individuals’ every day lives 
as it is today. The Internet is a regular part of home life, and more and more
people can work at home because of it. Custom homebuilders often tend to
want to add every new piece of technology offered. Check out Smart Homes
For Dummies by Danny Briere and Pat Hurley (Wiley) for more details about
all the different choices.
Kevin has seen the pros and cons of working with house technology over the
last several years, and he has a few pointers.
The less technology-specific the home the better
Technology changes faster and faster today. Kevin has clients who only five
years ago spent a fortune to run state-of-the-art Cat-5 computer wire through-
out their homes. Today, wireless routers render the wire obsolete.
Design your house to accommodate any new technology by providing tubing
(conduit) and cubbies that give you general access points to rooms in the
house. Mark the access points clearly so you can always add things where
you want them.
Make sure you have ongoing support
Technology companies come and go. Sometimes the most innovative go up in
a ball of fire the fastest. Whatever technology you install in the house needs
to be maintained and serviced. If the manufacturer goes out of business, your
technology may be as useful as that 8-track tape player in your attic.
Watch the budget
Your house project may take years, and new features that are better than
what you install will be available. Buy only what you’re truly likely to use.
Kevin has one client that spent more than $350,000 making his house a smart
house. By the time the three-year project was finished, most of the technol-
ogy could have been installed for a mere $35,000. Talk about one unhappy
client!

 Reading your plans

 Obtaining permits
W
ouldn’t life be great if you could simply sketch your house on the back
of a napkin and the contractor would magically build exactly what you
had in mind? Whether designing a log, stick built, or timber frame home, sadly
the process is a bit more complicated; your project requires outside expertise
and approvals. In this chapter we take the mystery out of looking at blueprints
and plans. We talk about engineering the working drawings. We also explain
the design review process and discuss acquiring and paying for permits.
Understanding Plans and Blueprints
If you have ever built model cars or airplanes, you know how important the
instructions are. Nothing gets you into trouble faster than trying to assemble
that model by looking only at the picture on the box.
Obviously, having instructions when building a new home is essential.
However, because a house is a complex structure made of many different sys-
tems, your instructions (or plans) need to include many different drawings. 
A typical set of plans will include 30 to 50 pages of specific instructions on
how to build your house. The plans first include a set of preliminary designs
or prelims. After these prelims are approved, the engineer prepares the work-
ing drawings for constructing the house. (See “Working drawings: The how-
to-build-it papers” later in this chapter for more on working drawings.)

Architects and engineers often draw plans in quarter-inch scale, meaning that
each 1⁄4 inch on paper represents 1 foot in real life. You can read the drawing
measurements easily with a ruler by measuring any line and dividing the
number of inches by 4 to understand how many feet long any straight line
will be in real life.
Prelims — Floor plans, site 
plans, and elevations
The first designs will be rough sketches and drafts drawn by an architect or
designer. They may include scratch drawings and renderings, which are an
artist’s version of what the house may look like. If you buy plans from a book
or online as discussed in Chapter 5, you can skip the rough sketch phase of
the process. Plan software also discussed in Chapter 5 provides a neat way to
try different floor plans with ease.
As soon as you and your architect, if you’re using one, have made some basic
decisions on style and size, the architect will draft preliminary drawings. These
drawings are necessary to show the house in three dimensions. The prelims
will be used primarily for making initial decisions, such as room placement and
size, with your architect, as well as preparing for the initial design approval
process. (For the nuts and bolts on the design approval process, check out
“Submitting Your Prelims for Approval” later in this chapter.) Creating these
prelims is an ongoing process of reviewing drawings and making changes. If
you’re buying plans, the plan company provides you with the prelims. If you’re
using a software program, the prelim creation is your responsibility.

Why are blueprints blue?
Blueprint is a long-surviving term, more than 150
years old, that comes from the fact that repro-
ductions of plans for construction were always
blue with white lines representing the drawings
and words on the page. The construction indus-
try needed a way to make exact replicas of
large drawings with exact measurements
because the corner Kinko’s was unavailable.
Architects and draftsmen first drew their plans
on tracing paper. The translucent paper was
placed on light-sensitive chemically reactive
paper and soaked in chemicals that turned all
the light exposed areas blue and left the lines
white. This system was a cost-effective method
for creating multiple sets of perfect duplicates
suitable for construction. Later, the process was
reversed to create blue-line prints where the
lines are blue and the paper is white. Although
blueprints and blue-line prints are still used
today, most architects now use Computer Aided
Design (CAD) systems and simply print plans on
large printers. The term blueprint has stuck and
now means any sort of master plan.

These prelims consist primarily of three basic elements:
 Floor plans (see Figure 6-1): Each floor of the house has a layout that
shows the following:
• The location of each room
• The placement of each door and window
• The location of other amenities, such as stairs, fireplaces, closets,
and major fixtures such as kitchen cabinets and showers
 Site plan: The site plan shows how the house and other buildings such
as the garage will sit on your lot (see Figure 6-2). The site plan explains
the position of the house and the direction it faces. It also specifies how
far it sits from the street and neighbors’ houses based upon the required
setbacks discussed in Chapter 3.
 Elevations: The elevation drawings illustrate what your house’s exterior
will look like from the ground up on each side (see Figure 6-3). Most ele-
vation sets show the house from all four directions. The plans illustrate
exterior windows and doors as well as any ornamentation in the design.
From these plans, you can measure the height of the structure and its
elements.

Working drawings: The 
how-to-build-it papers
After the prelims have been finalized and approved, the architect and engi-
neer create working drawings. Working drawings are a series of individual
papers giving explicit instructions on how to build the house. They give you

Chapter 6: Engineering and Plan Approval: Bureaucracy Made Somewhat Easy
Building codes and ABCs
Building codes are rules and guidelines that
specify how construction should be completed
so that buildings will be safe. They address
issues such as the requirements for electrical
wiring, the size of pipes, how far to place fram-
ing posts, and so on. Unfortunately, no one stan-
dard building code exists for the entire country
(or for the entire world), although it would cer-
tainly be easier if there were. Most municipali-
ties have adopted a regional code and then
created variations as required for their area.
In the United States, the basic codes come from
the following published codes:
 The Uniform Building Code (UBC): Widely
used in the West.
 The Standard Building Code (SBC): Widely
used in the South.
 The National Building Code (NBC): Until
recently, widely used by everyone not using
the UBC or SBC.
 The International Building Code (IBC): The
latest code, being adopted by everyone in
all regions.
Your contractor, subs, architect, and engineer
need to be knowledgeable with the codes for
your area. Some regions, such as California,
have more stringent code requirements than
others due to seismic or other environmental
issues. If you want to find out more about build-
ing codes or check a specific code, try www.
codecheck.com.

You can see an example of how these system drawings are isolated in Figure
6-5 so each sub can focus on his or her work.

Working with the Building and 
Planning Departments
Many of the nightmare stories you may hear about custom homes stem from
dealing with local government during the plan approval process. The local
county or city has to approve your designs and make sure the plans fit with
their rules and regulations in a process called plan check. You have to pro-
vide to the local government offices all your plans and anything else they
may ask for, which varies with every department in every municipality.

If everything goes smoothly, then you can be ready to break ground in three
to six months from the time you first call your local planning office. (Of
course, this time frame varies widely depending upon where you live.) If you
hit a snag, then all bets are off. Kevin has clients who have battled building
and planning departments for more than a year. The best way to prevent
problems is to work with experienced architects, engineers, and contractors
(if involved at this time) that know the department you’re submitting to.
These professionals can use their relationships and knowledge of the local
government inner workings to chart the fastest, smoothest course for
approvals and save you from making costly mistakes.
Here are additional pointers to remember to make the process of working
with the building department go smoothly, especially if you have a problem:
 Keep communicating. First and foremost, keep the lines of communica-
tion open. The permitting process is all about passing information back
and forth. Ask a lot of questions so you’re sure you understand how
everything works.
 Be complete. Most building departments hand out or post online the
information required to apply for a permit. Have all your information
together in a nice neat package. Make sure it’s complete when you turn
it in. If you piecemeal the process, you’ll frustrate the clerks, inspectors,
or plan checkers and they won’t be able to make informed decisions —
possibly leading to costly delays.
 Deal with one person. One helpful person can make all the difference in
a building or planning department. Dealing with the same person can
keep you from having to explain your situation again and again. Find a
person that you can work with. If you respect this person and give him
or her a pleasant experience, then he or she is more likely to give you
one.
 Have a single point of contact on your end. Plan-checkers, clerks, and
inspectors get frustrated and confused by getting what can be conflict-
ing information from the architect, the contractor, and the client. Pick a
contact on your side, keep in touch, and trust in your contact. Most
people choose to make the architect or contractor the contact because
they usually have longstanding relationships with the local employees.
 Be persistent. Most building and planning departments are underfunded
and understaffed. They’re busy, and there is always a bigger problem to
take your place. Don’t be afraid to call regularly to get the response you
want. Be careful not to pester needlessly however. Pick your battles, but
when there is something you really need, press the issue. Letting them
know the realistic timelines at stake helps so they can set priorities in
their workload.
115
Chapter 6: Engineering and Plan Approval: Bureaucracy Made Somewhat Easy

 Don’t be intimidated or intimidating. These people are civil servants;
they’re there to help you and want to do so. Don’t be afraid to be igno-
rant of the building process, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. At the
same time, treat everyone in your building department with courtesy.
Even if you hit a roadblock, you’ll get further in the process with calm
discussion than with angry theatrics. Smiling and saying thank you goes
a long way in reminding people that you’re human. A friendly tasteful
joke once in a while may make that civil servant the inside friend you
need.
Submitting Your Prelims for Approval
Before you spend thousands of dollars engineering plans and creating work-
ing drawings, you’ll want to get approvals for the preliminary design of your
house.
Generally, in rural areas, the design approval process is simple and has mini-
mal limitations. In rural areas, houses are typically separated by vast acreage
and the county is seldom concerned about what your house looks like as
long as it meets the safety and building code requirements.
But if you plan to build in a higher density neighborhood or planned commu-
nity, the guidelines can be strict and the design-approval process exhausting,
especially if you’re looking to bend the rules. Keep reading for info about the
design review process.
Addressing grading, septic, 
and well issues
Before you submit your prelims for approval, the county may require special
separate permits for specific items such as grading, well, and septic systems.
These approvals and permits may need to be handled by you, your architect,
or your contractor before the house plans are completed based upon the
needs of the lot. You may encounter some restrictions with grading, well, and
septic systems. For example, the building department may only issue grading
permits at certain times of the year to prevent erosion when grading a hill-
side prone to geological issues.
Find out about any grading restrictions in your area before starting the per-
mitting process. By taking time-sensitive issues into account in the beginning,
you can avoid stopping and starting your project, which can create financing
and labor problems down the line.
116
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

Wells and septic systems need to meet county standards for habitability as
well as environmental concerns. The county may have minimums for water
pressure allowable for the size of the house. A similar issue can exist for
septic systems. If the soil doesn’t support a standard system, the county may
require a more expensive engineered system or restrict the size of the house.
Exploring these issues first with your architect and other professionals who
can certify wells and septic tanks can save you time and money. Otherwise
you may run into a brick wall on your approval and have to redesign the
house from scratch or — worse — find out you can’t build at all.
Understanding design guidelines
Have you ever wondered why all the houses in a neighborhood seem to have a
similar look and feel? The similar look and feel isn’t by chance. Neighborhoods,
cities, and counties often develop specific guidelines that govern what you 
can build and how you can build it. Furthermore, other agencies such as the
Coastal Commission may also have to approve your design if you’re building
near the coast. You can obtain these published planning and building depart-
ment regulations from your local planning and building departments.
You also need to be aware of other guidelines that were put in place when
your lot or neighborhood was created. You can find some of these rules in the
covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs). You should have received a
set of the CC&Rs when you bought the lot. If you didn’t, you can ask the title
company from your purchase to get you a copy for free. Subdivisions older
than 50 years likely have a minimal set of rules. They may not have CC&Rs
that are pertinent.
Newer subdivisions are usually developed with specific themes. Seaside
areas or golf course developments may have very restrictive guidelines to
make sure you’re staying within the theme of the development. No one in a
planned Spanish-style development wants to drive by a giant Cape Cod house
everyday. You can obtain these rules from the homeowner’s association
(HOA). Depending upon your neighborhood, the guidelines may include the
following:
 Architecture style
 Drainage
 Environmental issues
 Exterior finish materials
 Height of the house
 Landscaping restrictions
117
Chapter 6: Engineering and Plan Approval: Bureaucracy Made Somewhat Easy

 Minimum and maximum size of the house
 Paint color
 Types of the following building materials:
• Doors
• Roof
• Windows
Developers and HOAs establish guidelines to ensure that no one house is
imposing upon the pleasure of any other homeowner in the neighborhood.
Most likely, after you have successfully built your house, you too will adopt 
a NIMBY attitude (which stands for Not In My Back Yard) and will become 
a vigorous defender of your neighborhood’s guidelines.
Requesting variances and exceptions —
Don’t be Don Quixote
Some smaller cities and neighborhoods have volunteer design review com-
mittees, whose members may be appointed or elected by the community.
Although such committees may have a government employee involved or in
attendance, most are dominated by residents concerned with the preserva-
tion of their neighborhood’s particular aesthetic feel. Design review commit-
tee members are passionate about determining what other people’s houses
must look like, so you’ll need approval from this committee to build your 
new home. If you’re lucky and careful, the process can be short and sweet; if
you’re not lucky — or worse, careless — the process can take far longer and
be more harrowing than the building of the entire home itself.
Because you’re building a custom home, you have already made a statement
that you’re dissatisfied with the homes already available in your neighbor-
hood or community and want something more unique to suit your taste. As 
a result, design review isn’t likely to be a picnic. For design review, you’ll
submit your preliminary plans to the design review board, neighborhood
association, and/or planning department to get approval for the basic design
of the house. They will review the plans and return them to you with a list of
everything they don’t like. Subjective guidelines such as style and colors may
provide for negotiation for an exception. Objective rules such as exceeding
height limits likely require a variance to the guidelines.
The best way to deal with variances is to design a house that doesn’t require
them. Working with an architect familiar with the community’s regulations
may help. If you’re looking at too many restrictions for what you want to
build, you may want to consider a different piece of land entirely.
118
Part I: Getting Started: The 411 on Custom Home Building 

No one has the right to a variance or exception. You can request it but it may
be turned down. Some people choose to fight restrictions legally by showing
evidence that similar variances have been granted in the past. If you under-
take such a battle, you may win but at a great expense of time and money.
Remember, even if you take your case to court, there’s no guarantee you’ll
win. Furthermore, you may ultimately win a long drawn-out design review
battle and end up losing the war. Don’t forget that the design review board is
comprised of your neighbors. A protracted battle filled with hate and law-
suits can make for a rather hostile housewarming when it’s time to move in.
Not so fast — Acquiring 
neighbor approval
Just because the local design review association or planning department says
they like the house doesn’t necessarily mean you’re home free. In many cities
you still have to get neighbor approval before presenting your project to the
design review board or planning department. Getting neighbor approval most
often occurs when you’re building in a long-established neighborhood, but
not necessarily. This neighbor approval process gives you the opportunity to
inform your neighbors and prepare them for the new addition to the neigh-
borhood before you submit your plans. (The city will tell you if you need
neighborhood approval.)
As a part of seeking this approval, you may be required to erect story poles.
Story poles are wooden boards that outline the perimeter and height of the
house as shown in Figure 6-6. These poles are required to stay in place for 
a designated period of time while your soon-to-be neighbors assess if your
house will block their sun exposure, lake views, and so forth. Your neighbors
will then be given the opportunity to challenge the approval of your building
plans, which can turn into an unpleasant experience.
The earlier you establish a friendly, working relationship with your neigh-
bors, the better your overall custom home experience will be. Just by plan-
ning ahead, you can reduce the stress level when submitting your plans and
possibly start to develop good relationships with your new neighbors.
Consider the following:
 Take into account your neighbors’ sight lines and exposure before
you commit to the design. Ask if you can look through their windows to
see the impact on their property.
 Put yourself in their position. What would you think of living next door
to your planned home?
119
Chapter 6: Engineering and Plan Approval: Bureaucracy Made Somewhat Easy

 Get their feedback and support for your project. Kevin has one client
who threw a wine and cheese party for the neighbors so they could
come and see the plans before submitting. He had rousing support at
design review. This process has been a favorite of architects he has
worked with as well.

Gathering the Permits You Need
After the prelims have been approved, you can start moving down the per-
mitting path. Don’t worry; this process is a lot more cut-and-dry than the
design review. The building permits are there to make sure that your final
plan meets with the minimum standards required by your local city or
county. The rules may be set for reasons of safety, logistics, or for environ-
mental or other reasons. (No one has come up with a code to restrict
teenagers to their rooms yet, but who knows, maybe soon.)
You or your architect will hire engineers to make sure you’re meeting the
needs of your local government and help create the working drawings. The
permitting process isn’t always a short one. If everything goes smoothly, you
may get through it in a few months. Some processes can take more than a
year with complications or bureaucratic difficulties.
Many building departments have a preliminary review process. For a fee,
they look at all your working drawings after design review or before you for-
mally submit the information to the planning department. They’ll let you
know if they notice anything questionable or potentially against code so you
can fix it first. Utilizing the preliminary review process can get you through
the formal process fast and easy.

Submitting and revising 
the working drawings
After the designs are approved and the working drawings finished, you, your
architect, or your contractor (if involved at this point) submit the working
drawings to the building department with appropriate fees required for appli-
cation. These fees get the ball rolling.
The plan checkers scrutinize the working drawings to make sure they meet
all the local codes and requirements. The plan checker marks the working
drawings with red pencil for correction or in rare cases turns the plans down
for permit. (If turned down flat, you’ll need to have the plans re-engineered.)
You, your architect, or your contractor, if you’ve hired one yet, can pick up
the marked plans at the building department. The architect and engineer
make the requested changes to the working drawings and resubmit the plans
to the building department.
If the plan checker still isn’t satisfied, he’ll red pencil the plans again and
request they be fixed again. This process continues until the plan checker is
fully satisfied, at which point the plans are officially approved.
In some areas, you may need to go through this process more than once. The
plans may require review by a local city department and a county depart-
ment. Different local governments have different jurisdictions for code, so
they’ll dictate their own approval process. Discuss the plan check process
with your architect and engineer so you’re clear on the steps and timing.
Picking up permits and paying the fees
After the building department has fully approved your plans, you or your
contractor, if he’s involved at this point, can pick up the permits.
You’ll write a large check for all your permits and the remaining fees and pick
up the permits so you can break ground. The costs vary widely from area to
area, as do the names for the fees, but you can expect your permits and fees
to cost between $3 and $10 per square foot of building area. You’ll have to
pay these fees in full before you’re allowed to begin building on the property.
Often these fees cover general expenses for the neighborhood’s local infra-
structure as well as overhead for the local government. (Remember, the city
or county has to cover every cost and support the numerous staff members
necessary to run their departments.)
121
Chapter 6: Engineering and Plan Approval: Bureaucracy Made Somewhat Easy

The following list contains many of the fees you can expect to pay:
 Appeal fee
 Building permit
 Design review fee
 Drainage study fee
 Grading permit
 Land use permit
 Parks and recreation fee
 School fee
 Tree permit
 Variance fee
 Walkway fee
Although the cost of these various fees shouldn’t be deal breakers for you, be
sure you have sufficient funds budgeted for them and that you’re prepared to
pay when the time comes. Even though you may have to pay these fees out 
of pocket, you may be able to reimburse yourself through your construction
loan if you included them in your budget. See Chapter 9 for more details on
how these fees fit into the construction loan budget. These fees can often be
reimbursed immediately by showing the bank the receipts. We talk about
reimbursing these fees in Chapter 10.

T
his chapter may be one of the most challenging to accept, but within its
pages, you can find some of the most important concepts in this book. A
construction project lives and dies on the availability of funds. Without access
to cash when it’s needed, a construction project will quickly come to a grinding
halt. Most people want to be fiscally conservative when dealing with a large
financial project like building a home. The challenge, however, is in under-
standing exactly what fiscal conservatism is really all about.
To make good decisions with your finances, spend some serious time educat-
ing yourself. No need to bury your head in the sand from the fear of numbers;
you can access all kinds of information on the Internet and through the help
of financial professionals. The more you find out about financial management,
the better equipped you’ll be to make the right decision for your situation.
In this chapter, we explain why having adequate cash on hand is so impor-
tant. We also help you put borrowing in the proper perspective, and explain
concepts that can help you protect your investment and manage your cash.
Finally, we give some tips for deferring major financial decisions until the end
of the project, when you have the information you’ll need to make a good
decision.

Accepting the Need for Cash, 
Cash, and More Cash
You may be wondering why cash is so important if you’re already planning to
get a construction loan and not relying on savings to fund building your new
home. The answer is simple: Whether or not you borrow money, your custom
home project will suck up cash like a vacuum cleaner. If you have enough
money, you’ll be fine, but run out of cash and you’ll be in a big time world of
hurt.
A construction loan does cover a significant portion of the funds to build your
home, but you’ll also face some significant restrictions and procedures for get-
ting that money, so having extra cash on hand will keep the project moving.
Not only that, but you need some cash before your loan is in place to cover
expenses like permits, and after it’s complete in order to pay for moving in
and landscaping. In addition to your construction loan, you may end up need-
ing as much as 40 percent of your total budget in cash to make the project
work. We explain how construction loans work in Chapter 8 and discuss how
you get your money from construction loans in detail in Chapter 10.
If you’re still not convinced, consider the following reasons why extra cash is
necessary even if you’re financing your project through a bank:
 You need a down payment for your land. Chances are, when you pur-
chase your land, you’ll need to make a down payment and pay for clos-
ing costs. See Chapter 3 for details.
 You need to make the loan payments and pay taxes on your land until
the construction loan is in place. It may take several months from the
time you buy your land before you’re ready to build and get a construc-
tion loan. You’ll have to make payments on your land loan and pay prop-
erty taxes while carrying the payment on your current home.
 You need to pay the soft costs. You have to pay for soft costs, such as
the plans, engineering, and many fees for permits before you can fund
your construction loan. See Chapter 6 for details about soft costs.
 You need cash to close the construction loan. Your construction loan
may not be big enough to cover all your costs for the project. Also, the
bank will want to see money in the bank beyond what is necessary for
the project for qualifying. See Chapters 8 and 9 for details.
 You have to pay the monthly costs during construction. Your loan may
have an interest reserve (or a pool of money set aside) to cover the con-
struction loan payments as described in Chapter 8, but you still have to
pay for property taxes and homeowners’ fees as well as the house pay-
ments where you’re currently living.
126
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

 You need to fund the work between the construction draws (fundings
from the bank). The construction lender won’t give you loan proceeds
for a particular part of your project until the work is done. You’ll have to
put the money upfront, and be reimbursed by your construction lender
with the loan proceeds later. See Chapter 10 for details.
 You want to upgrade as you go. You may want to improve certain items
as you see the house come together, for example, substituting granite
kitchen countertops in place of the Formica ones you originally speci-
fied. Because you can’t increase the construction loan after you fund it,
you have to pay for the upgrades out of pocket.
 The project costs more than you budgeted. Do you want some sobering
news? Approximately 95 percent of custom home projects go over budget.
(Can you say ouch?) And when a custom home project goes over budget,
guess who pays? You. Although you may be the lucky 1 in 20 who doesn’t
go over budget, do you really want to take the chance with the largest
investment you’ll probably ever make in your entire life? We didn’t 
think so!
 Landscaping, decorating, furnishing, and moving expenses. These items
probably aren’t included in your construction loan budget. Even if land-
scaping and hardscaping are included, the decorating of a new home can
cost a pretty penny.
 Something goes wrong. Always remember Murphy’s Law: If something
can go wrong, it will go wrong. Anything from your contractor winning
the lottery and abandoning your project to August snowstorms in
Arizona can unexpectedly create the need for more extra cash. Just
remember, as Yogi Berra said, “It ain’t over til it’s over!”
Breaking the Emotional Barriers — 
This Is Not Your Father’s Depression
Many people approach their finances today using philosophies that have
been passed down through many generations. For example, the concept of
using extra cash to pay off your mortgage early was based on Depression-era
economics of the 1930s. In those days, banks were unsafe, Social Security was
merely a twinkle in the eye of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and owning
one’s home free and clear was the only financial hedge most people could
rely on.
Of course, times change. Banks are safe, most people have retirement income
and/or Social Security to help out as they grow older and leave the work-
force, and a home is merely one of several assets that most people keep in
their financial portfolios. Are you living your financial life based upon the
philosophies of the 1930s?
127
Chapter 7: Cash Is King: Using Debt to Your Advantage

Although your elders may have handed down lessons to you, you also need
to realize that today’s economics are somewhat unique to the last 30 years.
Financial structures today are vastly different than they were — even a
couple of decades ago — and all different kinds of new tax laws and invest-
ment strategies didn’t even exist in Grandpa’s time.
Evaluating real estate 
within your net worth
Calculating your net worth can give you a good perspective on your finances.
Many people make the mistake of separating their real estate — particularly
their homes — from the rest of their assets. If you’re like most people, your
house is probably your single largest financial asset. For that reason alone,
don’t ignore it. Chances are, of course, your mortgage is also your single
biggest financial liability. Understanding your asset and liability picture is
important to gaining the proper perspective for making major financial deci-
sions such as the structure of financing a custom home. Use the following
simple method for calculating your net worth:
1. List all your assets with their values.
Make sure you include the current sale value of your existing house, the
resale value of your cars, cash on hand, and any stocks, bonds, cash-
value insurance policies, or retirement money you may have squirreled
away.
2. Add up the total dollars of all your assets.
3. List all your liabilities (money you owe).
Don’t worry about the monthly payment amounts, instead, write down
the outstanding balances of your mortgage, car loans, student loans,
credit cards, and other debts.
4. Add up the total dollars of all your liabilities.
5. Subtract the liability total from your asset total.
This amount is your net worth.
Now that you know your net worth, you can assess how your real estate fits
in the picture:
1. Estimate today’s value of all your real estate.
2. Add up the amounts of all your mortgages.
3. Subtract the mortgage total from the value and this amount is your
net equity.
4. Take your net equity and divide it by your net worth.
128
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

If the number is greater than .45, then you have too much of your net worth
tied up in equity. Even the most conservative investors don’t like to keep all
their eggs in one basket. Talk with your financial advisor, accountant, and
loan officer about the methods for increasing your liquidity or available cash
and the benefits of doing so.
Acquiring secured debt can be good
Everyone agrees that too much debt can be terrible, but we can think of sev-
eral good reasons to borrow money if you know you have the ability to pay it
back. Unfortunately, debt can easily get out of hand for some people. All debt,
however, isn’t treated the same.
 Unsecured debt is cash loaned to you strictly on your promise to pay it
back with interest (and any other fees that you and the lender mutually
agree to). Repayment of the loan isn’t guaranteed by any of your prop-
erty (home, automobiles, boats, and so on). Unsecured loans generally
have interest rates significantly higher (the words loan shark may come
to mind in some cases) than the prevailing prime rates that banks
charge their best customers.
 Secured debt is a different animal altogether. Repayment of the cash
loaned to you is guaranteed by some item of your property like a car 
or your home. When debt is secured against an asset, it simply means
you’re making the asset more liquid. The asset still exists to pay back
the debt, and very few banks will allow you to borrow more money than
exists in the asset. In other words, you’re really borrowing your own
money out of the asset.
Because the loan is secured, the lender has less risk and will generally loan
you the money at lower interest rates. You can also receive government sub-
sidies for borrowing against assets such as real estate.
Getting on the same page — 
How banks evaluate risk
Lenders don’t think secured debt is bad. In fact, they’d rather bank on some-
one with secured debt and liquidity (cash in the bank) than someone who
has no secured debt at all. Consider this example:
Two neighbors walk into the local bank. Bill Smith has a home worth $400,000. 
He has paid off his home and has $20,000 in the bank. His net worth is $420,000.
Jane Clark, Bill’s neighbor, also has a net worth of $420,000, but Jane’s net worth 
is structured differently. Her house is also worth $400,000. But Jane has a mortgage
for $300,000, and she has $320,000 in certificates of deposit and mutual funds.
129
Chapter 7: Cash Is King: Using Debt to Your Advantage

Who gets the bank’s attention?
The bank offers Jane its best signature loan for $200,000. She can have the
money today with five minutes of paperwork and no costs. Why does Jane
get this special treatment? Jane is no risk to the bank; she has ready cash
available to pay back her loan if necessary.
Bill, however, is sent down the hall to the mortgage department. He doesn’t
get a quick loan. Instead he has to apply for a secured mortgage, and then
wait for his money while the bank verifies all his information and performs an
appraisal on the house. Bill has no means to pay back the loan unless he sells
his house, so the bank wants to secure the loan to his house to protect its
investment.
So, even though on the surface Bill seems to be the most prudent investor,
he’s actually a walking, talking risk in the eyes of the bank.
How would you look to your lender? Consider changing your financial profile
to look more like Jane’s.
Changing perspective — Home 
equity isn’t a savings account
Many people have the erroneous belief that paying off their home is just like
putting money in a savings account. Nothing could be farther from the truth.
Understanding this concept is important so you can make the right long-term
decisions regarding your custom home financing. Your home is not a bank!
Why not? Because
 When you put money into a savings account, you can withdraw the
money whenever you want. The only way to draw money out of your
house is through some sort of mortgage or credit line, which requires
time and often some costs.
 You can quickly move money in a savings account to better investments
as markets change. Equity is stuck in the house and can only be
acquired at prevailing rates.
 You can take out money in savings in any amount — no matter how
small — and at your discretion. You can only remove equity in large
amounts and at the discretion of the bank willing to loan money to you
based upon whether or not you qualify.
130
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

Understanding the benefits of liquidity
When it comes right down to it, good old-fashioned fear is the biggest motiva-
tor for tying up cash in the home. Some people are afraid they might squan-
der their money, so they increase their payments. Others are afraid of losing
their job, so they increase their payments. Many are afraid of the economy
changing, so they increase their payments. To counter those fears, consider
some basic benefits of keeping your cash liquid instead of burying it into
your house:
 If you lose your job: If you lose your job, you’ll need to worry about a
lot more than just making your house payment. Borrowing extra money
on your mortgage for the sake of having cash in the bank can be an
excellent form of security. Even though having a house payment that is
$500 cheaper may make a financially difficult situation a little easier for
you, having a higher monthly payment with $100,000 in the bank will
make life a lot easier while you work on finding a new job. You can take
your time to assess the situation, and you can afford to take an extra few
months to find the right job — instead of feeling like you have to take
the first offer to come along.
 The economy: If the economy goes south, then you have cash on hand
to bail you out of any situation. If your house decreases in value, so
what? You already have the money to use as you see fit. If the interest
rates are on the rise, all the better for you because now you can get a
higher return on your cash.
 Cash squandering: Getting a professional to help manage small portfo-
lios of money isn’t easy. The more money you have to invest, the better
caliber professionals will be available to you. They earn a percentage of
your portfolio’s growth, so they’ll work hard to help you save and invest
in ways that will benefit you both in the long run.
All this advice assumes that, instead of spending every extra bit of cash like a
drunken sailor, you put it aside into a savings account, stocks, a money
market fund, certificates of deposit, or other liquid assets. So, instead of run-
ning out to buy an expensive new sports car, taking an around-the-world
ocean cruise, or gold-plating your plumbing faucets and fixtures, invest your
money wisely!
Okay, So You Have All This 
Cash — Now Manage It
So now you have the cash, and with it comes the added responsibility of 
managing it. Having wealth can be a pain initially, but have no fear; excellent
resources are available. Start with the terrific book, Investing For Dummies by

Finding and working with 
a financial advisor
If doing your homework is too time consuming or mind boggling, then don’t
hesitate to work with a professional financial planner. After you have a decent
size portfolio, getting the attention of an experienced professional to help
you manage your dough should be fairly easy.
Ask friends and family that are financially secure whom they use for financial
planning. Many qualified, experienced professional money managers are out
there, but many of them aren’t up to the task or don’t have your best inter-
ests in mind. Do your homework. Ask for referrals and references and check
them out. You want someone who will ask you a lot of questions to prescribe
the best options. Three basic types of financial advisors are available to you:
 Fee planners: These planners work on flat fees rather than commission-
like insurance-based advisors and stockbrokers, and therefore they
aren’t necessarily tied to selling you any particular kind of investment.
Many people believe the lack of commission makes them more objec-
tive. Others argue they aren’t motivated to earn you the best yields. For
more information on fee planners, check out the National Association of
Personal Financial Advisors Web site at www.napfa.org.
 Insurance-based advisors: These advisors work for insurance compa-
nies or independent insurance brokers, and their primary focus is using
insurance policies as investment vehicles. They’re often experts in
estate planning.
 Stockbrokers: These advisors deal primarily in stocks, bonds, and
mutual funds (and they’re in business primarily to sell stocks, bonds,
and mutual funds). Many larger brokerages have expanded their ser-
vices to provide other banking and insurance services.
After you find a few financial planner candidates, investigate their credentials
and approach. You want to work with someone that takes everything in your
financials into account and who is knowledgeable in all kinds of different
investments. For example, you’d be surprised how many advisors have little
knowledge in real estate.
Stay away from brokers just trying to sell you the hot stock du jour. And be
aware that there is no way to magically make money. The best advisors
advise. Find someone that can spend his or her time educating you so you
can make the decisions.
132
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

If you can’t find one person you trust and you have more than $100,000,
spread it around. Try splitting your portfolio among a couple of advisors and
see which one performs the best over time. As soon as the trend becomes
clear, then shift your assets to the financial planner who does the best.
Diversifying your portfolio
A good financial planner may suggest several strategies, but the primary
focus needs to always be diversification — splitting your money over many
different types of investments. Why? Because no high-performing investment
stays that way forever. Diversifying your assets can protect you when a
market goes through changes.
Some markets work in the opposite direction. For example, when interest
rates rise, the stock market may fall, and vice versa. By investing in a number
of different kinds of assets, you can protect yourself from volatility in a partic-
ular market and gain a steady return. Studies have shown that well-diversified
portfolios have consistently earned 8 to 10 percent during any ten-year period
of time in history — from the time of the Great Depression through today,
even accounting for the bursting of the stock market Internet bubble. Work
with your advisor and discuss the best way to divide your assets, keeping tax
ramifications in mind. Different options include
 Commodities (such as oil, orange juice futures, and pork bellies)
 Corporate bonds
 Government/municipal tax-free bonds
 Large-company stocks
 Precious metals (gold, silver, titanium)
 Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
 Small-company stocks
Many advisors recommend investing in mutual funds and annuities because
they’re a single fund that mixes many categories for you. You can focus these
funds toward income or growth. You can also look at an established fund’s
prospectus, a pamphlet explaining all the management details and risks asso-
ciated with a fund, to see how the fund has performed over time and who is
managing the fund.
Exploring alternative investments
Other types of investments can provide good returns outside the standard
investment markets. Ask your financial advisor about the risks and benefits
133
Chapter 7: Cash Is King: Using Debt to Your Advantage

of investing in some alternative investments. Check out the following invest-
ments that are worth exploring:
 Equipment-leasing funds: Usually available only through a financial
advisor, you loan money secured against business equipment, such as
computers, furniture, tools, and other assets.
 Federal tax credits: Believe it or not, you can buy someone else’s tax
benefits and the government guarantees them.
 Notes: Just like a bank or savings and loan, you can loan money to
people and get paid interest in return for the risk you take. A note is the
written promise by a borrower to pay you back with interest. To protect
your investment, you can secure notes against real estate holdings.
 Limited partnerships: A limited partnership is a group of two or more
people who work in partnership to invest in assets such as large com-
mercial buildings, apartments, and shopping malls. Limited partners, by
definition, have only limited say in the operations of the partnership.
 Other real estate: Many people opt to take their money and buy rental
properties. See www.stratfordfinancial.com for more information on
this topic.
You won’t find a shortage of investment choices. Not all are financially sound
or make sense to every investor. Investigate each one thoroughly and leave
yourself with options. Protect yourself by only investing in something you
can effectively explain to someone else.
Turning Your House Into a 
Money-Making Machine
For most people, their house is more than just their home. It represents their
single largest investment, as well as their largest source of long-term income.
When building a custom home, consider your home an investment. With any
investment, you need to make decisions aside from whether or not to invest,
such as how to leverage using financing and how to take actions to maximize
the return. Many of the questions require research and conversations with
professionals like certified public accountants (CPAs), real estate agents, and
loan officers. Understanding how a home works as an investment will better
prepare you to make the right financial decisions on your custom home to
help you maximize your investment return.
134
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

More house for less cash — Benefiting
from leverage and appreciation
The way people make money on their home is through appreciation, which is
a return on your investment — the reward for taking a risk with your money.
With very few exceptions, you can count on real estate to go up in value over
long periods of time. Although appreciation isn’t always consistent from year
to year, short of some local economic catastrophe, you can typically expect
to see the value of your home rise at least 3 to 5 percent per year. Some parts
of California and New York have risen more than 20 percent annually in
recent years.
You can increase the return on your investment with something called lever-
age. Leverage means using less of your money to make the same profit. You
have a choice about how much of your cash is tied up in your house. The
dollar amount of the appreciation will be the same regardless of the amount
you have invested, but your return can increase substantially using the prin-
ciple of leverage to your benefit.
For example, consider Jim and Mary, who own a house worth $400,000 free
and clear of any mortgages or other encumbrances. Their house appreciates
by 5 percent in a year, so they have earned $20,000 or a 5 percent return on
their $400,000 investment.
Their neighbors, Tom and Sue, have a house also worth $400,000, but they
only have $100,000 equity with a $300,000 loan. They’ve invested the $300,000
cash that they could have used to pay off their loan elsewhere, such as a
diversified stock portfolio. Their house also appreciates the same 5 percent
or $20,000 in a year. But instead of the same 5 percent on their investment
that Jim and Mary earned, the $20,000 in appreciation represents a 20 per-
cent return on Tom and Sue’s $100,000 home equity. Not only is their return
better than Jim and Mary’s, but also Tom and Sue are free to make other
diversified investments with their large chunk of cash.
Protecting your investment 
by making it marketable
Much of the fun of building a custom home is in creating something that 
is exactly what you want — it’s your dream, after all! If your dream is too
unique, it can pose a problem, however, if what you want is unappealing to
the rest of the world. A property’s value is based upon supply and demand. 
If many people like your home and want to buy it, then they’ll bid against
135
Chapter 7: Cash Is King: Using Debt to Your Advantage

each other and the price will increase. By contrast, if no one wants to own
your house besides you, you may not be able to give it away. Keep these
major considerations that can impact value and marketability in mind:
 Conformity: If the house is much smaller than the rest of the neighbor-
hood homes, it will be less desirable. At the same time, a home that is
bigger than the other homes in the same neighborhood won’t attract
proportionately more money.
 Design: People want homes that are functional and easy to maintain. 
A castle with a moat may be great in the French countryside, but will 
sit on the market forever in suburban Cincinnati.
 Location: Remember the real estate agent’s favorite mantra: Location,
location, location! Elements such as busy streets or being close to com-
mercial buildings can deter buyers.
Your best financial security is knowing you can sell the house quickly in any
market, good or bad. The more the house appeals to a large cross section of
people, the more likely you can sell it at a good price in any market. Nearly
any house can sell when real estate is in a boom. Ultimately, you want to be
able to sell for the highest price possible when the market and the economy
are at their worst because that is when you need the money the most.
Understanding taxes — Many parts 
of a home project are deductible
One of the greatest benefits of home ownership in the United States is the
benefit of tax deduction. As long as you intend to move into your custom
home when it’s finished — using it as your primary residence — you have 
a number of different items that are tax deductible:
 Points (loan origination fees) on the land and construction loans
 Interest on the land and construction loan
 Interest on your permanent loan
 Property taxes
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does limit how much money you can
borrow and still deduct in interest and points. The IRS only allows deduc-
tions on a loan amount of $1 million or less, but it does allow you to deduct
the interest and points on an additional credit line of $100,000 beyond the 
$1 million.
136
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

These deductions translate into real dollar savings for you. Effectively, the
government is subsidizing you to borrow money on your house, putting more
money in your pocket every month. In states like California, people with sub-
stantial income can have tax savings of as much as 40 percent of their
monthly payment. Here’s a quick formula to calculate your tax savings:
1. Multiply your loan amount times your interest rate to get your annual
interest.
2. Multiply your estimated value times your local property tax rate.
This amount is 1.25 percent in most states, but can be much more in
states like Texas and New Jersey. You can get the information by calling
your friendly, local county tax office.
3. Add the interest and the taxes, and then multiply the total times your
combined state and federal tax bracket.
You can get this number from your accountant or tax preparer.
4. Take the amount and divide by 12 to get your monthly tax savings.
This tax savings represents real dollars you can use toward your
monthly payment.
Sometimes, your deduction can be big enough to reduce your income signifi-
cantly, moving you into a lower tax bracket and saving you even more money.
Ask your CPA or tax preparer to check how close you are to the income
thresholds.
If you claim these items as deductions during the build and then sell the
home as an investment, you may have to amend your returns and pay back
the savings. Check with your CPA or tax preparer about the implications and
be sure of your intentions.
You don’t have to wait until the end of the year to get the cash from your tax
savings. You can increase the deductions on your W-9 so that you’re taking
home more of your paycheck on a monthly basis. Check with your CPA or tax
preparer to figure out your proper withholdings and stop letting the govern-
ment hold your money for free.
Safely Deferring Financial Decisions
Until the End of the Construction Project
Even though planning ahead is crucial to a successful custom home project,
you can and need to wait until the project is finished before making certain
137
Chapter 7: Cash Is King: Using Debt to Your Advantage

financial decisions. By deferring some of these choices, you can save yourself
from making commitments that may strap you for cash too soon, such as
applying a large down payment to your land (see Chapter 3). When you 
have better information at your fingertips, you can make decisions, such 
as locking in the rate on the permanent loan or deciding on your permanent
loan amount or program. We discuss some of these choices in Chapters 15
and 16.
You have no way of knowing how much your project will actually cost or how
long it will take until it’s complete. Any estimate before then is strictly an
educated guess. The same is true for economic conditions. You can spend 
a lot of time worrying about where the interest rates are or if your house 
is holding its value, but you can’t do anything to change the situation or 
predict more accurately. Risk occurs either way, so you have to analyze 
the situations carefully.
The best approach to dealing with uncertainty is education and careful deci-
sion making. Keep emotion out of the decision process. Consult experts and
educate yourself about the risks and benefits of each decision. Analyze the
repercussions of delaying the decision. Ask these questions when making
financial decisions:
 What is the total amount of dollars at risk on this decision?
 When will I have all the facts for sure?
 What is the worst case if I guess wrong today?
 Is there a way to protect myself against the worst case?
 What is the cost of that protection?
 Is it worth it?
 What course of action will make me sleep best at night?

Knowledge Is Power: What You
Don’t Know About Construction
Loans Can Hurt You
In This Chapter
 Understanding loan types
 Finding a lender
 Moving through the loan process
 Figuring out fees and costs
 Giving some burden back to the lender
T
he nation’s big lenders have done a good job of teaching you to shop for 
a mortgage as if it were a TV dinner that you can pull from your grocery
store freezer, only comparing price and forgetting taste. Getting a construction
loan, however, isn’t quite so simple. In fact, obtaining a construction loan is
more like cooking a gourmet meal from scratch for a 20-person dinner party.
Although important, the loan’s total cost will end up being less important than
its functionality. If you ignore details, it could be a disaster.
As you read this chapter, put aside any knowledge you may have of regular
home purchase mortgages. Construction loans are different; they have differ-
ent pricing and structure than loans to purchase existing homes. When you’re
shopping for a construction loan, relatively few loan officers have extensive
experience putting one together, and even fewer firms specialize in these types
of loans. Therefore, make sure you’re as knowledgeable about the process as
you can be before you meet with your loan officer.
Write down every detail (from program information to approval guidelines)
and don’t be afraid to ask questions several times until you understand
everything completely. Your loan officer will probably have to research your
answers and get back to you later. Never assume he understands what he is
talking about unless he has personally funded at least 50 construction loans
over the course of his career.

In this chapter in addition to putting construction loans in the proper per-
spective, we spell out the differences between construction loan types and
take you through all the details. This tour includes picking a lender and
understanding the different costs for construction lending.
Exploring Your Construction Loan Options
If you’re going to borrow money to build the house from any kind of institu-
tion, the money most likely will be in the form of a construction loan. This
loan replaces your existing land loan. A construction loan differs from a con-
ventional mortgage or the land loans discussed in Chapter 3 in the sense that
the bank doesn’t give you the money all at once. Instead the bank meters out
the money based on the progress of construction. The banks have more risk
because taking back a house and selling it if you stop paying them is much
more difficult when the home is incomplete.
When dealing with construction lending, don’t expect to find much standard-
ization with different lenders’ loan programs. Banks pretty much design their
own products to fit with their own short-term cash needs. Most banks — small
and large — borrow money on giant credit lines and use that money to fund
construction loans. Local banks and savings and loans may use portions of
their depositor base to fund loans. Because construction loans are by nature
short term, banks don’t need to sell the loans to third parties (a common
practice for long-term mortgage loans). This short-term approach makes stan-
dard programs unnecessary in the bank’s view.
That said, some similarities do exist among different lenders. All construction
loans can fit in the following categories.
Getting it done all in one — Benefiting
from a single-close
Large institutional mortgage banks, including IndyMac Bank and Countrywide
Financing, created these single-close loans during the last ten years. They fig-
ured out that people who build their own custom homes live there longer and
default less often than other people. They figured (correctly) that, by offering
a great construction loan upfront, they could automatically roll these cus-
tomers into profitable long-term mortgages. See Chapter 15 for more info on
rolling into permanent mortgages.
All-in-One, Construction/Permanent (CP), One-Time-Close (OTC), and
Construction-To-Permanent (CTP) — no matter what you call it, the 
140
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

single-close loan has the same features. Some features of the single-close 
construction loan include
 Generally, no re-qualification or re-appraisal is required for these loans.
Simply finish the construction, and you get a free permanent loan with
no questions asked.
 The borrower usually has a variety of popular permanent loan programs
from which to choose.
 Some lenders offer options for locking interest rates before the house is
finished.
 The lender may allow the borrower to buy land as part of the process
provided she has all the necessary construction documentation ready
before funding the loan.
As a result of the ease of the overall process, single-close loans are extremely
popular and easy to find in the marketplace. These loans are excellent pro-
grams for first-time custom home consumers.
Construction-only loans — 
The double-close process
In this process — used by most local banks, and the only way to get a con-
struction loan before the single-close program came along — the lending
bank provides a short-term loan only for the construction time period. After
construction is complete, arranging for another loan for your permanent
financing is your job. Unfortunately, having to take this step means going
through the process of applying and qualifying for another loan, although
your bank may have you prequalify for a permanent loan before it commits 
to the construction loan.
We strongly recommend against this type of loan if you find a single-close
option that works for you. Why? Because
 This process is potentially more expensive because you have to pay for
two loans and all the fees and costs that go with them.
 This loan is like a short fuse on a long stick of dynamite. Many things
can change in the course of 6 to 18 months while you’re building your
house. You have no way of knowing whether or not you or the house will
still qualify for a permanent loan when the house is finished. A change in
the market or interest rates could force you into foreclosure or, at best,
payments you can’t afford.
141
Chapter 8: What You Don’t Know About Construction Loans Can Hurt You

 The banks that sell this product work on a “buyer beware” ethic and
consider permanent loan qualification or getting an unaffordable loan to
be your problem at the end.
Our advice? Shop around for an all-in-one deal!
Full documentation versus no-income-
qualifier programs
Oddly enough, the best loan programs are available to people who can fully
document sufficient income for qualification with tax returns and pay stubs.
Documenting your income is always to your advantage, because you can
borrow more money at cheaper rates and fees. The key? Be sure you qualify
before you apply. (We go into more detail about the qualifying process in
Chapter 9.) If you don’t pass with flying colors, then a no-income-qualifier
program is your next best option.
You may have heard the terms EZ Qualifier, Quick Qual, No Qual, No Income
Qualifier, Reduced Doc, No Doc, and the like thrown about. These terms 
by themselves don’t designate actual types of loans. They are merely the
lenders’ marketing terms to distinguish their own no-income-qualifier pro-
grams. And, by the way, these loans aren’t necessarily easier or quicker than
full-documentation loans. They usually require better credit and take just 
as long to approve. Here is a breakdown of the specific types of no-income-
qualifier loans currently available in the marketplace:
 Stated income, verified asset: You must state your income and verify
liquid assets that meet the lender’s requirements. See Chapter 9 for
more details on this particular flavor of no-income-qualifier loan.
 Stated income, stated asset: You can state your income and assets with
no further documentation required. Stated loans are usually for people
with variable income or who are self-employed.
 No-stated income, verified asset: You put no income on the application;
however, you do provide documentation of your assets.
 No-stated income, no-stated asset: This loan requires great credit and
costs more. You simply state your name and Social Security number.
Poor credit and odd-property options
Consumers with bad credit or properties that fail to meet bank guidelines
don’t have many options for construction loans, much like the land loans
that we discuss in Chapter 3. If your credit is below a credit score of 620 (see
142
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

Chapter 9) or if you have recent problems, such as bankruptcy, judgments, or
tax liens, you don’t have many options in the institutional lending world.
Additionally, any property that doesn’t meet with lending guidelines as we
outline in Chapters 3 and 9 (for example, property without public electricity)
requires a nontraditional lending source. The best option aside from robbing
a bank (no, we’re not suggesting that as an option!) is private or hard money.
(See “Private money — The last resort,” later in this chapter.)
Finding a Good Construction Lender
Picking a loan and finding the right lender can be a bit of a chicken-and-egg
process. Do you find the lender and then choose the program, or do you
search for the lender that has the program you’re looking for? Kevin advises
you to explore both directions. If you come across a great loan program,
explore it further. On the other hand, if you can find an experienced loan offi-
cer with good programs, he may be worth a little more money for the service
and education he provides.
Many people make the mistake of looking for someone close by and applying
with the first person that makes them feel comfortable. The Internet has also
become a new resource for construction financing, but most advertisers
don’t specialize in construction loans. They’re just casting their nets wide 
for business. In fact, most of the links that come up on Yahoo! or Google are
clearinghouses generating leads to be sold to mortgage companies. Read the
ads carefully; relatively few companies actually do specialize in construction
loans, and you definitely want to find an expert if you can.
Sadly, most of today’s lenders are more interested in selling you their loans
than helping you make the right decisions. Most loan officers are fast-talking
sales guys and gals subscribing to the philosophy that the customer is
always right. They’ll spend most of their time telling you what you want to
hear just to lock you up as a customer.
A loan officer shouldn’t be a used-car salesman. He needs to be a professional
expert advisor using his knowledge to advocate for your best interest. You
wouldn’t want your doctor or lawyer lying to you just to make you feel good,
would you? Expect the same from your loan officer. Find a loan officer willing
to risk your business by telling you hard unpleasant truths that will keep
nasty surprises from occurring later in the process. Remember that you have
lots of time and money at stake, and you don’t want to lose either of those
because someone was afraid to tell you the truth or acted upon ignorance.
Start with a loan officer that listens to what you’re saying. If he is talking
about programs before asking you about your situation, then steer clear fast.
143
Chapter 8: What You Don’t Know About Construction Loans Can Hurt You

Choosing a broker or a bank
A mortgage broker is an independent loan originator that helps you, the con-
sumer, and can submit loans to many different lenders. Mortgage brokers act
as middlemen and are paid primarily by the lender via wholesale pricing on
loan programs, which brings up the age-old question: Do I need to eliminate
the middleman? Drum roll please. And the age-old answer: It depends! You
may get lucky and qualify with the right bank that has the perfect loan for
you in your circumstances. It’s not likely, but it could happen. The question
is, if you didn’t ask around and investigate, how would you know if it was the
best program for you? Consider the following reasons why bypassing a mort-
gage broker and going directly to a bank can be limiting:
 Bank loan officers are salaried (not commissioned) and tend to be the
least experienced loan officers in the business.
 Banks are product oriented. They have only their programs and, if you
don’t fit or don’t like them, they’ll send you away having wasted your
valuable time.
 Banks tend to focus only on the construction loan, ignoring other ways
of helping your finances.
 Any documentation you give directly to the bank must be used by the
bank — even if your situation changes or can be represented more 
favorably.
 The bank considers depositors to be their customers. To the bank,
you’re just another liability. (See Chapter 16.)
Mortgage brokers today fund 65 percent of U.S. mortgages because they pro-
vide great benefits to consumers, including the following examples:
 Mortgage brokers have access to almost every loan program in the mar-
ketplace, providing a one-stop shop.
 Mortgage brokers only get paid if your loan closes, giving them incentive
to get the job done.
 Mortgage brokers are required by law to disclose the fees they make, so
you know exactly what they’re getting paid.
 Good mortgage brokers are accustomed to comparing and contrasting
many different loan programs — finding the best one for your situation,
regardless of the lender.
 Mortgage brokers can act as a filter, helping to determine how to present
your package in the most favorable way to the bank.
 Mortgage brokers work with you months in advance to help prepare
your package.
144
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

 Good mortgage brokers may identify other loan programs for your situa-
tion, such as a refinance to help your cash position.
 Many mortgage brokers are dependent upon referral business, making
them more concerned with your happiness.
Although mortgage brokers aren’t necessarily less expensive than going
directly to a bank, banks do offer discounts to brokers in the form of whole-
sale pricing, so the terms can be close. In construction lending, a broker who
knows his way through the process and can get you qualified with a good
program is worth far more than a bank that offers a discounted program for
which you don’t qualify.
Not every mortgage broker is worth your respect. Like any high-commission
business, there are plenty of slimeballs. Only a seasoned professional with
experience and knowledge in construction financing is going to be an asset in
helping you get a good loan for your situation. (More about this topic in the
next section, “Testing a loan officer’s knowledge.”) However, if you can’t find
anyone who meets these qualifications, first educate yourself, using this book
as a guide. Then, armed with this information, pick an honest, willing mort-
gage broker with access to many lenders. Kevin’s book What the Banks 
Won’t Tell You (Grady Parsons Publishing) — available at www.stratford
financial.com — has a great test for nonconstruction loan officers.
Testing a loan officer’s knowledge
Regardless of whether you work with a bank or a mortgage broker, you need
to be assured that the loan officer is giving you accurate information and she
knows what she’s talking about. Use this book as your guide for testing your
loan officer’s construction loan competency. Use these five test questions for
doing just that, along with references to the chapters for the answers:
 What is the difference between LTV and LTC, and how does it relate to
your best programs? (See Chapter 9.)
 Why is title insurance more expensive on a construction loan? (See the
section “Understanding All the Fees” in this chapter.)
 What is the difference between a voucher system and a draw reimburse-
ment system? (See Chapter 10.)
 Calculate a nine-month interest reserve. (See Chapter 9.)
 Why is an indemnification agreement necessary? (See the section
“Getting the loan after construction starts” in this chapter.)
If you’re fortunate enough to be dealing with someone who understands and
can articulate these issues, then you’re already ahead of the game. If after
you pose these problems, your loan officer is standing there with a glazed
look in his eyes, run — don’t walk — to a different company immediately.
145
Chapter 8: What You Don’t Know About Construction Loans Can Hurt You

Most loan officers haven’t been extensively involved with construction loans.
Regardless, you may find someone that has had some experience. Whether or
not this person can answer all these questions exactly isn’t so important.
What is important is that he doesn’t try and slide lies by you in hopes you
don’t know what he’s talking about.
Find someone who tells you she doesn’t know all the answers, but she can
happily research the issues and get back to you. Honesty and patience are
the signs of a trustworthy professional. Make sure she also asks you as many
questions as possible. You can best judge your loan officer by the questions
she asks rather than by the answers she gives.
Getting value added — Education and
experience are worth the money
A small number of mortgage brokers in the country act as construction loan
consultants. Kevin’s company, Stratford Financial, is one of these companies.
Consulting mortgage brokers such as Stratford expertly guide you through
the entire process. Their knowledge comes from seeing hundreds of scenar-
ios in construction lending. By understanding patterns, they can almost see
the future because they have seen something similar before.
They sit down with you at the very beginning of the process when you’re 
just thinking about a custom home. They can analyze your situation as it sits
today and design a program that takes into account every variable and road
bump you may encounter along the path until move-in day. They then take
this data — combined with your personal financials — and develop a specific
plan that assures you the most cost-effective method of succeeding with all
the financial steps of your project including risk management, cash flow, and
lender approvals.
Sometimes the loan fees with these mortgage brokers can be a little more
expensive than going directly to the lender; however, often they can find
better programs and structure your project in ways that can save you signifi-
cant amounts of time and money. Furthermore, you’ll have peace of mind
knowing you have an expert advocate on your side when embarking into
uncharted waters.
If you have already made major mistakes and failed with a lender or two, find
one of these consulting mortgage brokerages — construction loan consul-
tants are accustomed to fixing these problems. After a loan runs into prob-
lems with a lender, it becomes difficult to determine where the problems are
and how to fix them. If you find yourself in this position, contact the lender’s
wholesale office that turned you down and ask for the most knowledgeable
mortgage broker in your region. You can also contact www.customhome
experts.com or the National Association of Residential Construction
Lenders at www.narcl.org.

Private money — The last resort
If you have realized that private or hard money is the only way to get the loan
funded, then you still need to find the right private lender for your needs.
The good news: These lenders are relatively easy to find, and they usually
don’t offer a lot of different options. Most local mortgage brokers or bankers
can give you a referral to private money lenders. These private lenders are
simply investors that like to make moderate risk interest income by making
real estate loans that banks won’t touch. The lender drives the process and it
can be relatively easy. Your main concerns in this kind of loan are price and
terms.
Hard money usually costs around 10 percent, plus 5 to 6 percentage points 
in fees, which is roughly twice the cost of conventional financing. The rest 
of the fees run the same as any other construction loan as we outline in the
section, “Understanding All the Fees,” later in this chapter. The terms that
differ are
 The loan’s time length
 How much the private lender will loan
 How the private lender gives you the money during construction
Some private money lenders are also more conservative about values with
appraisals than others. Ask the referring party about its prior experience
with the lender. Try to talk to two or three private or hard money lenders
before you fill out an application and move forward.
The Loan Process from Start to 
Finish — When to Do What
Because a construction process involves many people over a long period of
time, you need to be as efficient as possible. Starting too early with banks can
cost you money and waste your time. Waiting too long can hold up the start
of your build. Remember that the actual process is all about proper timing.
Use this step-by-step guide to managing the loan process.
Although exploring the construction loan process early is important in order to
be prepared, you need to complete several steps before applying to a bank. By
this time you should have your lot (see Chapter 3), have your finances in order
(see Chapter 7), and have your plans finished and submitted to the building
department.
147
Chapter 8: What You Don’t Know About Construction Loans Can Hurt You

Deciding when to sell your existing house
For everyone who thought you’d have to sell the house you’re living in before
you can afford to build, we have good news. Most lenders don’t calculate the
cost of your current residence when evaluating your construction loan quali-
fications. You will, however, need to provide a letter that you intend to sell
when the new house is finished. Some lenders also accept a letter of intent to
rent the house. Either way, qualification won’t be an issue forcing you to sell
the house early. You can wait until the new house is finished, and you don’t
have to incur the expense of moving twice.
Because banks don’t count your existing house payment during the loan appli-
cation process, you can access any necessary cash you may need for your
build (see Chapter 7) without affecting your qualifications. Simply refinance
your existing house to the highest loan possible and take a low payment,
adjustable-rate mortgage similar to the ones we explain in Chapter 16. Doing
so gives you extra money for the build as well as low monthly expenses during
the build. You don’t need to stay on a long-term fixed payment when you’re
going to sell the house soon anyway.
In order to access necessary cash from their existing home, some people
choose to take out a Home Equity Line Of Credit (HELOC) to get the extra cash
out of the house. (We discuss HELOCs in Chapter 16.) A HELOC gives you
access to the cash in your home; however, a HELOC does increase your cur-
rent payment to cover the cash you take, whereas a complete refinance can
give you the cash and actually lower your monthly payment.
If you’re worried about making payments on both your house and your con-
struction loan at the same time, don’t fret. Many banks offer or require you to
hold an amount of money in the construction loan called an interest reserve
for covering the construction loan payments. If you have an interest reserve,
you won’t have to make payments on two houses at the same time. You can
read more about interest reserves later in this chapter in the section “No pay-
ments — Taking an interest reserve.”
Some construction lenders offer bridge loans to cover cash needed from your
existing residence for construction. We advise you to stay away from these
loans if you can. Bridge loans are more expensive than the refinance or HELOC
options, and the bank secures the bridge loan with both properties instead of
one. With a bridge loan in place, you have greater difficulty restructuring your
financing situation if you underestimate your project and run out of money.
You don’t need this type of loan because the refinance and HELOC options can
provide you more cash at a lesser cost.
148
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

Applying on time
Loan documentation is only valid for 90 days from the time it is signed or initi-
ated. This expiration applies specifically to your credit report and the prop-
erty appraisal. If you apply with a bank and don’t fund the loan before these
documents expire, you’ll be forced to pay for a new credit report as well as an
appraisal extension or recertification of value, which is only good for another
90 days. Most lenders won’t fund the loan until the permits are in place. And,
because getting permits is often one of the most challenging tasks as you pre-
pare to build your new home, applying for the permits is the best benchmark
to use for your loan application. We discuss the permitting process at great
length in Chapter 6.
Kevin’s company, Stratford Financial, uses the permitting process to deter-
mine the correct timing for the loan application. Kevin’s goal is to avoid
double work, so he starts the application roughly 60 days before the bor-
rower is ready to break ground. Because most building departments take 30
to 45 days to review working drawings, Stratford instructs clients to start
loan paperwork when they turn the working drawings in for final approval.
If your permits are done and you’re ready to break ground, you can apply
pretty much anytime. The faster you turn in all your paperwork, and the
more complete it is, the sooner you’ll get funded. The loan process generally
takes roughly 40 to 60 days. The slowest parts are the appraisal and under-
writing processes that we describe in Chapter 9.
Getting the loan after construction starts
Most lenders fund a loan when you’re in mid-build with no problem. The only
issues they may have to resolve are with the title insurance companies. Title
insurance is necessary for the lender to insure that its loan is clearly secured
against the property in case you default on the loan. The lender likes to be the
first one to get paid back if it has to take the property back and sell it. The title
insurance starts officially the day you and the bank close escrow (finish execut-
ing all the paperwork and transferring of money on a prescribed date) the loan
and the trust deed (a legal paper that protects the lender’s interests) securing
the property is recorded with the county.
When you break ground or do any work on the property, you create what the
title companies call broken priority. This term means that any contractor or
sub who hasn’t been paid as agreed can at any time file a mechanic’s lien
securing their debt against the property. (We talk more about mechanic’s liens
in Chapter 11.) The problem is that these contractors and subs can file these
liens months after the loan is in place, but, because the work in question took
place before the loan, the mechanic’s lien takes priority and the contractor
149
Chapter 8: What You Don’t Know About Construction Loans Can Hurt You

has rights to the property before the lender. Understandably, a mechanic’s
lien makes the lender very unhappy and nearly impossible for the title com-
pany to insure the lender.
Most states have a remedy for mechanic’s liens with something called an
indemnification agreement. Most title companies allow you to sign an agree-
ment assuring them that you’ll pay any and all claims by contractors and subs
for work completed prior to the date of recording the loan documents. The
title company will want to examine your financials to make sure you can afford
to take this step, but it’s relatively simple and, more important, it’s free!
Most loan officers don’t know about indemnification agreements, so you need
to educate them and check directly with the title company. Check on this
issue with your loan officer and title company before anyone starts work on
your property.
Preparing the paperwork
Keeping all your paperwork handy and organized can save you time and
hassle when applying for your loan. (Check out the organization tips in
Chapter 2.) You need to gather personal and construction-related documents
that tell the lender about you, your contractor, and your project. The follow-
ing checklist describes the personal documents most lenders require before
they’ll review your loan package. The items are listed in the order that most
lenders stack their loan documentation:
❑Application (supplied by lender; lists all your personal and financial
information)
❑Consent form (supplied by lender; allows the lender to verify your 
information)
❑Signed disclosures (supplied by lender; keeps the lender in compliance
with the law)
❑Most recent year-to-date pay stub
❑Two years’ W-2s
❑Two years’ personal tax returns
❑Two years’ business tax returns (if self-employed)
❑Year-to-date profit and loss statement (if self-employed)
❑Rental agreements (if you own rental properties)
❑Three months’ bank statements on all accounts, both business and 
personal
❑Most recent statements for retirement accounts
❑Closing statement (HUD-1) for land purchase
150
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

The following checklist includes the construction-related documents most
lenders require before they’ll review your loan package:
❑Three sets of plans, including working drawings
❑Completed cost breakdown (supplied by contractor)
❑Completed description of materials form (supplied by contractor)
❑Completed builder statement (supplied by lender)
❑Construction contract (signed by contractor)
❑Architect information
❑Insurance agent information
❑Contractor’s liability policy (see Chapter 2)
❑Workers’ compensation policy or waiver (see Chapter 2)
❑Course of construction policy (see Chapter 2)
❑Copies of permits or permit applications
❑Copies of paid receipts/canceled checks for items paid and work 
completed
Even if the lender doesn’t require all these items from you upfront, prepare
these items in case the lender asks for them at the last minute.
Locking in an interest rate
When to lock into an interest rate is usually the No. 1 question on most home-
builders’ lips, but you usually have the least amount of control with it. First 
of all, not all construction loans have programs allowing you to lock the rate
(fixing the rate at a certain percentage while you pursue the loan application
process). The programs that do allow you to lock the rate generally lock at
higher than the market rate you would get on a refinance loan on the same
day. Why? Because banks can’t predict what the interest rates are going to be
6 to 18 months down the road when you finish the house, anymore than you
can. And being banks, they’re certainly not going to accept additional risks
that they can successfully pass on to you. Some banks offer lock options if you
pay more in the interest rate or pay upfront fees. Much of the decision whether
or not you can lock the rate depends upon on your qualifying program.
When you lock, you’re betting that the market will get worse during your build
time. But how can you decide whether or not that will be the case? First, ana-
lyze the economy by reading all the financial reports on www.yahoo.com and
in the Wall Street Journal. If you’re still sane, have your loan officer lay out the
lock options on the programs for which you qualify. Figure out the dollars side
151
Chapter 8: What You Don’t Know About Construction Loans Can Hurt You

by side and make your best guesstimate. Understand taking any lock before
you’re approved may be a total waste of time if the bank turns you down or
you pick the wrong program.
Determining the length of 
your construction loan
Most construction loans are offered for a period of 12 months. Some lenders
offer shorter periods or longer, but rarely are they offered for less than 6
months or more than 18 months. But if you want something different than 
the standard 12-month loan term, you’re going to pay a different rate. The 
6-month rate is usually lower than the 9-month rate, which is lower than the
12-month rate, and so forth.
Be conservative rather than optimistic in estimating your timing. Despite
your carefully constructed building plans, you really don’t know exactly how
long it’s going to take to finish building your custom home. You may save a
little money upfront with a shorter loan — thinking your house will be done
sooner rather than later — but you could have to pay expensive penalties for
going over your time limit when schedule delays interfere with your best-laid
plans. Choosing a 9-month period over a 12-month period may save you only
.125 percent or $625 on a $500,000 loan amount, but the penalties on this
same loan for going past the 9-month term could be as much as .5 percent of
the loan amount, or $2,500 each month until you finish. Ouch! Not only that,
but you also have to pay the penalties in addition to the interest you’re
already paying, which can get very expensive indeed.
Understanding All the Fees
So you’ve probably been wondering what all this financing is going to cost.
There is nothing like the irony of the loan officer handing you that piece of
paper with the big number that makes you feel there should be a brand-new
car in your driveway. Who are all these people and why do they need to be
paid so much money? In this section we break your loan down, fee by fee, so
you can justify where your money is going. Be aware that construction loans
have their own, unique quirks.
Your best guide to your fees will be the original Good Faith Estimate (GFE)
completed by your loan officer at the time of the original application. If
you’re lucky, your loan officer will fill it out by hand right there on the spot 
so you have it in her handwriting with a copy you can go back to later. See
Figure 8-1 for a sample GFE. If the government form the lender uses isn’t 
clear to you, ask your loan officer to write the fees on a simple piece of paper.
Make sure your loan officer explains every fee clearly and consistently.

Chapter 8: What You Don’t Know About Construction Loans Can Hurt You

Paying points
There is no shortage of loan people trying to make their point. (It’s okay to
groan on that one.) Points are upfront fees (one point is equal to 1 percent of
the loan amount) charged for one of two reasons:
 To generate cash at the closing to pay loan officers and origination
departments
 To reduce the interest rate by compensating upfront for the interest the
banks pay to their investors
Despite what the TV loan hucksters say, points aren’t inherently evil or good,
they just simply are. Paying more points can be advantageous if the points
create a comparable savings. You and your loan officer need to figure out
what is the best deal for your situation. Points are usually broken up into
eighth fractions. Check out the following list to see how they’re represented.
This list can help you with discussions with loan officers on points and rates:
 1⁄8 = .125
 1⁄4 = .250
 3⁄8 = .375
 1⁄2 = .500
 5⁄8 = .625
 3⁄4 = .750
 7⁄8 = .875
 1 = 1.000
Even though points have some flexibility, you won’t find many construction
loans out there at zero points. Depending upon the terms of the program and
how much risk the bank takes, your points should range between 0 and 3 for
a conventional lender. Hard money is more expensive. For zero points to
happen, the lender has to increase the interest rates in order to pay a rebate
to the originating broker or loan officer. This scenario may or may not work
to your advantage.
To figure out whether you’re getting a better deal on points versus rate when
comparing two loans, follow these steps:
1. Calculate the loan amount times the points on each loan.
2. Multiply the loan amounts by .6 to represent the amount of loan you’ll
use during construction.
3. Multiply this amount by the offered interest rate.
154
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

4. Add the points and the interest together.
5. The loan with the lower total is the better deal.
Most knowledgeable mortgage brokers want to make at least 1.5 to 2 points
on a construction loan because it’s much more work than a purchase or refi-
nance. Loan officers split the fees with their company so they don’t always
get the lion’s share of the points being charged. Some mortgage brokers who
provide consulting services or solve difficult problems may charge more.
You can negotiate points, especially with mortgage brokers, but make sure
you negotiate upfront. Waiting until the mortgage broker has done all his
work and then beating him up on fees at the last minute is unethical, particu-
larly if he is charging what he disclosed to you at the beginning. If he didn’t
deliver what he promised, then negotiating may be okay. Also, by negotiating
in a hardball fashion at the end of the process, the broker may simply decide
to not fund your loan, leaving you suddenly high and dry. Remember that a
good loan officer is worth his weight in gold throughout the entire project to
help work with the lender.
If you’re concerned about being overcharged, negotiate upfront the amount
of points the mortgage broker will charge, allowing for extra work such as
problem solving and exceptions. Most mortgage brokers appreciate this
upfront approach and accommodate you. And because mortgage brokers
must disclose their fees by law, you can insure they’re making good on their
part of the deal. Imagine how great it would be if other professionals like
attorneys and mechanics were willing to agree on costs upfront. Yes, we
know that’s not going to happen, but we can dream, can’t we?
Points are generally tax deductible on your primary and secondary residence.
As long as the loan amount is less than $1 million, you may be in for some
extra savings. Check with your accountant or tax preparer to make sure you’re
taking advantage of all the tax benefits available with this project. Don’t you
think it’s about time the government started paying you instead of the other
way around?
Escrow and title are more than other loans
Clients who look at the GFE often notice significant differences between the
rates charged for escrow and title by various lenders. Being able to identify
this difference is actually a great tool for weeding out loan officers who 
aren’t really that informed about construction loans. The Real Estate and
Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) heavily regulates title fees, so they’re
pretty much the same no matter which company you use. The title fees are
more expensive, however, than the same fees for a purchase or refinance
loan. Escrow companies and escrow attorneys often charge more for con-
struction loans because of the additional risk they assume for construction
loans and the added work that is involved.
155
Chapter 8: What You Don’t Know About Construction Loans Can Hurt You

The reason for the added expense in the title insurance has to do with
mechanic’s liens (see Chapter 11). These liens are remedies for contractors
and subcontractors to recoup money if you don’t pay them, and they can
attach (file a legal claim against) the property. The title company’s job is to
protect the lender from this happening, otherwise, the lender won’t loan 
you money. The title company accomplishes this by way of an endorsement.
Various endorsements are required throughout the project every time you
take money from the bank. The price of these endorsements can range from
one hundred to several hundred dollars. So, although title insurance (includ-
ing endorsements) for a $500,000 refinance may cost only $1,200, title insur-
ance for a construction loan (including endorsements) may cost as much as
$3,000.
If you’re working with a loan officer who is well versed in construction loans
(exactly the kind of person we advise you seek out), accept the title and
escrow company she recommends. You may already work with your own
attorney or escrow officer, but chances are that he isn’t familiar with the con-
struction lending process. If he stumbles or makes a mistake, you will suffer.
Using someone else’s title company on a construction loan can end up adding
two weeks to the process.
My goodness . . . so many appraisal fees
Construction loan appraisals are different than appraisals obtained for a pur-
chase loan or a refinance. For construction loan appraisals, the appraiser has
to work from the plans and specifications to assess what the house will be
worth when it’s finished — a feat much more difficult than assessing a house
that is already built. And because custom homes often congregate in neigh-
borhoods of other custom homes, comparable properties against which to
compare home values are hard to find. Needless to say, these appraisals take
more time and cost roughly 25 percent more than conventional appraisals.
The price of an appraisal can range from $350 for small houses in a modest
price range, to $2,000 for mansions in multimillion-dollar neighborhoods. If
you have a large loan amount — say, more than $650,000 — you can double
the cost of the appraisal fees because the lender will probably require two
appraisals.
In addition, many lenders review the appraisal because it’s their most critical
piece of information as we describe in Chapter 9. They may just have it desk-
reviewed, meaning a reviewer checks all the information stated by the
appraiser with his or her own research online. This desk-review generally
doesn’t cost you any money. The lender may, however, request a field review
where the lender has another appraiser go out to the property and state an
opinion. This extra appraisal may cost you an additional $150.
156
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

Don’t order your appraisal too early in the process; your appraisal is only
good for 90 days. Although an appraisal can be extended with a recertifica-
tion of value for an additional 90 days, depending upon the lender’s guide-
lines, this extension can cost you another $150 to $250 depending on whether
the appraiser needs to add recent comparable properties to bring it up-to-
date. And don’t order the appraisal yourself. After you select a lender or
broker, have him do it. The appraisal has to be in your lender’s name anyway,
so if you change lenders, you’ll need a retype at a cost of $150 — assuming
that the appraiser gives you the retype at all. Appraisers tend to be loyal to
their lenders, so they make up all sorts of excuses as to why they can’t
release the appraisal to you even though you paid for it. A threat of legal
action usually solves this problem, but paying for a new appraisal is much
cheaper than litigation.
Insurance costs
Don’t forget to consider the cost of insurance in your construction loan; we
cover the various kinds of insurance necessary in Chapter 2. Assuming you
aren’t acting as your own contractor, you’ll have one insurance policy to pay
for at the close of escrow — the course of construction policy. This insurance
policy pays for any damage that occurs to your property during the course 
of the build, and it must be in place before the lender will fund the loan (the
lender protects its investment in the property, as well as your own!). Your
insurance agent needs to start shopping for the best policy for your situation
early in the process. The price of the policy is based upon the loan amount,
and roughly runs $1,500 to $3,500.
Figuring all the little stuff
Various parties charge their small fees in the construction loan. These fees
are often referred to as garbage or junk fees. But, junk or not, they can add
up, and they deserve your attention. Some of these fees may be negotiable,
but most aren’t. Don’t let that stop you from asking.
So, what do these fees pay for? Most are for items necessary to cover real
costs that occur on the loan. Because consumers have become so points- and
fee-sensitive, lenders have felt hard pressed to break the loan fees out into
every service they have to pay. The following list details most of the small
fees that routinely occur in a construction loan:
 Administration and inspection fee: We extensively discuss the purpose
of this fee in Chapter 10. This fee covers the costs of inspections and
wire transfers every time you take money during the construction loan.
It may be collected along the way rather than upfront, but if taken at the
beginning, the fee is usually $700 to $1,000.
157
Chapter 8: What You Don’t Know About Construction Loans Can Hurt You

 Credit report: Each lender that is considering loaning you money has to
order your credit report from a credit reporting agency such as Experian.
These fees have decreased recently, and are usually less than $50 for all
three bureau reports.
 Documents: The lenders subscribe to document software services that
prepare the loan documents for signing. Often they pass on the $175
cost to you.
 Flood certification: The lender needs to know if your property is in a
flood zone to make sure it doesn’t require special flood insurance. This
fee is a cheap one at $15.
 Funding and underwriting: Lenders actually give these terms a variety
of different names; they charge $400 to $750 in junk fees because they
can (and they do). The fees generally represent administrative fees
within the lender’s particular branch. In his 21+ years in the business,
Kevin has never successfully argued them away, so don’t feel bad if you
can’t either.
 Messenger fees: A whole bunch of paper shuffles from the broker to the
lender, from the lender to escrow, from escrow back to the lender, and
much more. Sometimes documents can be e-mailed, but the lending
industry does a good job of keeping messengers and UPS very busy.
Figure $50 to $100.
 Processing: Mortgage brokers charge this fee to cover their administra-
tive costs because most of the points go to loan officer commissions.
Many mortgage brokers use them as processor incentives to improve
service to the customer. Figure $350 to $500.
 Recording: A number of documents have to be recorded with the
county, including the trust deed securing the property, as well as the
construction loan agreement. This costs roughly $100.
 Tax service: The lender needs to know that you’re paying your property
taxes on time to ensure that the property doesn’t get attached (legally
taken) and sold at auction by the government. Independent companies
provide this service for $65.
 Wire transfer: The lender generally wires funds to the title company at
closing. Expect to pay roughly $25 using the federal wire transfer
system.
Letting the Lender Carry Your Burden
In his many years (and more than 800 successful projects) in the lending
industry, Kevin has discovered some philosophies for using construction
loan offerings that can benefit you in the long run. The following sections
explain it more in-depth.
158
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

If someone offers you money, take it
Always apply for the highest loan you can qualify for. Ultimately, you don’t
know what this project will cost until it’s finished. As we explain in Chapter
20, nothing is worse than running out of money in the middle of the project.
In addition, you may have some last-minute surprises before the loan gets
started that require more money. You can usually cover these surprises with
a higher loan, but only if you have structured your loan to qualify for that
higher amount.
You may be the smartest construction estimator on the planet and think
you’re being smart saving two points by borrowing $100,000 less than the
bank offers. Chances are, something unexpected will occur and saving that
$2,000 will cost you $20,000 while your project sits because you ran out of
money, or it will cost you an additional $15,000 to get a new construction
loan — assuming you can find another lender that will accept your project.
There are benefits to borrowing more money than you think you need. Taking 
a higher loan can reduce the amount of cash you have to put in the project at
the beginning. (See Chapter 9 for more details.) You don’t have to use all the
money from the loan if you don’t need to, and you can roll to a lower loan
amount as we explain in Chapter 15. Consider the extra points a tax-deductible,
low-cost insurance policy for your new home.
No payments — Taking an interest reserve
Some, but not all, construction lenders offer you the option of having an inter-
est reserve. (We explain how to calculate this reserve in Chapter 9.) An interest
reserve is a portion of the construction loan funds that are set aside for making
payments on the construction loan during the build. Every month, the lender
calculates how much money you have requested, multiplying this number by
the interest rate and dividing it by 12 to come up with the amount of interest
due for the month. If you have an interest reserve, the lender simply adds the
amount to your loan balance. If you don’t have an interest reserve, you need to
make this payment out of pocket.
Some lenders require the reserve, but for those that don’t, here are three rea-
sons why the interest reserve is a good choice:
 One less thing to worry about. You’ll be managing the project, your job,
and your family, and everything will be in transition. An interest reserve
gives you one less bill to keep track of and one less check to write. If you
miss a payment, it could be disaster for your credit.
 It can increase your loan amount. Lenders only provide a loan for items
covered in your budget, which we explain thoroughly in Chapter 9. The
interest reserve is a line item that the lender will happily accept.
159
Chapter 8: What You Don’t Know About Construction Loans Can Hurt You

 It helps your cash flow. You’re going to make payments on the house
you live in during the build. Without the interest reserve, you have to
make two house payments along with any other money you have to
spend during construction.
Interest reserves are only offered as a part of a construction loan. If your
lender doesn’t require an interest reserve, ask it if an interest reserve is an
option. If your lender doesn’t require or offer an interest reserve, you can
always take the same amount of money from your savings and set it aside to
be used for payments.

f you’re paying cash out of your pocket for your new home, then most of
the information in this chapter isn’t necessary. But, because only a very
small number of custom home projects are completely self-funded, you prob-
ably need a lender’s help to turn your new home into reality. If you’re like
most borrowers, you’ll probably begin with a local bank or national lender.
Throughout this process, your bank will remind you of its own version of the
Golden Rule: Them that has the gold makes the rules!
Usually, that rule works out just fine, except, most of the time, your lender
doesn’t tell you what the rules are until after you’ve broken them, which is
why we include this chapter. Although every lender has its own unique take
on the rules, a number of elements are common that you need to familiarize
yourself with before beginning the loan process.
In this chapter we explain how banks make decisions on construction loans.
We give you a look at bank guidelines for approving construction loans, and
we provide you with the math formulas banks use to calculate construction
budgets. Finally, we address issues that can come up in the bank approval
process — and there are more than a few!

Stepping Behind the Desk — How a
Construction Lender Views Your Project
When you apply for a construction loan, the bank doesn’t consider you to be a
customer in spite of the friendly smile on the loan officer’s face. What? How can
that be? Actually, the bank’s customers are the people who give it money to
invest. Banks make their profit by loaning money at higher rates than they pay
to investors with as little risk as possible. You’re a necessary “evil” involved in
making that profit. The money comes automatically when you make your pay-
ment, so the entire process for giving you a loan is centered around making
sure you and the project are a safe investment.
In this section we give you the banks’ perspective on risk and their approach
to business. We also explain their approach to your intent for the property.
Why some lenders may seem uncaring
Gone are the days when banks made decisions based upon relationships or
their personal knowledge of the borrower. Today, government regulators and
statistics control most of the policies and procedures in banking. The result
is that fewer institutions are loaning their own money for mortgages; Wall
Street actually backs most loans in some fashion, even construction loans.
The pooling and selling of money to Wall Street — combined with the savings
and loan debacle of the late ’80s — has created a much more regimented
system for underwriting, a term that means assessing the overall level of risk
on a particular loan.
Although today’s electronic underwriting may seem like a less personal
approach, it has allowed the underwriters to be a bit more consumer friendly.
The underwriting is now less arbitrary. With the computer modeling taking
most of the heat for denials or conditional approvals, the underwriter can 
be more of a consumer advocate focused on getting as many loans that fit
through the system. Essentially, the underwriter can play the good cop while
the computer plays the bad cop. (Refer to the “Man versus machine” sidebar
in this chapter for more information on the underwriting computer system.)
Our recommendation is to not take the underwriting process personally. In
one case Kevin was asking his friend — president of a large bank — for an
exception on a loan, and the response was “Gee Kev, I would love to. Please
give me a reason I can give to the bank regulators when I get audited, other
than just doing a favor for a longtime friend.” At that point, Kevin understood
that today’s loan decisions go way beyond the local scene. Fortunately, with
aggressive production bonuses in place, most lending employees want your
loan to fit their guidelines as much as you do. The more you design your loan
to fit the rules, the smoother the process will go.
162
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

Understanding risk assessment
So, what’s the risk? You know you’re going to make your payments, right?
Actually, so does the lender. The number of consumers that default on their
home loans is less then 1 percent according to the Mortgage Bankers
Association. In most of those cases, the bank takes back the property to
recoup its loss. Banks, however, aren’t in the real-estate sales business and
they don’t want to be. Even late payments affect their process of making
money on your loan. The underwriting criteria is designed to weed out the
people who have a higher probability of paying late or not paying at all.
The other assessment being analyzed on your file is the ability to sell the
loan to investors. Most loans are eventually sold to Wall Street investors that
have set specific criteria for loans to buy. If these loans go into default, then
the original lender may be forced to repurchase the loan from the investor.
Repurchasing a bad loan uses cash that the bank could have used to lend to
someone else. And if the sale of a recovered property takes a while for the
bank, a default can get very expensive indeed.
How banks view your property
Your property is the major security for the loan that the banks guarantee
against default. How much the property is worth in the banks’ eyes comes
down to marketability or the ability to resell your property if the bank has to
take the property back in a foreclosure. Banks love properties that are vanilla.
For example, the more the house is like every other house in the neighbor-
hood, the happier the banks are. Banks love suburbia. A house resembling all
others in the neighborhood may of course be the exact opposite of the adobe
163
Chapter 9: Qualifying: It’s the Bank’s Way or the Highway
Man versus machine
For years, underwriting was considered an art
and not a science, but today, science and tech-
nology are quickly catching up. Since the turn
of the century, most loans go through an elec-
tronic underwriting system before being passed
over to a human being. These risk-assessment
systems take into account data from the perfor-
mance of thousands of loans over past
decades. Based upon credit scores and asset
and income information, computer programs
determine the likelihood of default on your part.
The computer program may raise the interest
rate accordingly or suggest denial altogether. In
Big Brother fashion, human underwriters are
rarely allowed to override the computer deci-
sion. The human underwriter’s job instead is to
verify the accuracy of the input information and
review documents that are more visual in
nature, such as appraisals and tax returns.

igloo with the moat and castlelike turrets on the 120-acre estate you have
dreamed about since childhood. And there lies the problem for custom home
borrowers.
Ultimately, the lender wants the same thing as you. The lender wants to be able
to sell the house fast for the highest price in the worst of economic markets. In
order for that scenario to happen, the lender requires a property that has the
broadest possible interest to potential buyers. The more unique (or odd) the
house is, the more the house requires a buyer with unique taste, someone who
is relatively rare compared to the vast majority of home buyers. Fewer buyers
mean a longer selling time and lower resale. Lenders have years of data that
tell them what houses sell fast and what issues can leave a property desper-
ately waiting for a buyer. Ultimately, the security of the money you invest in
your property will be better protected by approaching your design and consid-
ering the lender’s point of view. You can read more about the design process in
Chapter 5.
How lenders view contractors
Lenders have loosened their requirements for contractors considerably over
the last few years. They used to require full financial review, including tax
returns, bank statements, and a first-born child or two. Some lenders still
have a rigorous approval process for contractors because of their concerns
about a contractor’s financial ability to manage the project’s funds. However,
because most banks have adopted the draw reimbursement system we
describe in Chapter 10, banks are at less risk now that money only gets paid
after the work is done.
Most banks simply want to see that the contractor isn’t a deadbeat and that
he has solid experience building houses, indicating that the home will be fin-
ished in a workmanlike manner. Banks also like to see that the contractor’s
license and insurance (liability, workers’ compensation, and so forth) are in
order. (See our discussion in Chapter 2 for more information on insurance.)
Although the bank provides some level of scrutiny for picking a contractor,
you’ll want to dig deeper as we discuss in Chapter 2.
How lenders view occupancy
Did you ever imagine that your lender would care who was planning to live in
your new home? Well, your lender does care — and your answer has a major
impact on your loan. If you, the borrower, are going to live in the house, then
the house is considered to be owner occupied. This type of occupancy earns
you the very best rates and the most flexible underwriting terms. Why?
Because people rarely walk away from the home they live in, so the lender
has relatively little risk that you’ll default on your loan.
164
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

If you’re planning to use the home as a vacation house, then it’s referred to 
as a second home. The lender looks to make sure that the house is in a likely
vacation area or resort town and not next door or across town. This loan may
have terms that are slightly less favorable than owner-occupied homes, but
second homes add minimal risk statistically, and you can usually find a vari-
ety of good loan programs available.
If you intend, however, to sell your home immediately after it is built, then the
lender will consider it as a speculative or spec home. Even if you plan to rent it
or use it as an investment, the lender still calls it nonowner occupied and treats
it as a spec home. Most conventional lenders don’t offer consumers construc-
tion loans for spec or nonowner-occupied homes because of the added risk of
default. These homes require commercial funding that we outline in the next
section, “How lenders view spec projects.”
If you aren’t sure what you’re going to do with the house after it’s completed,
you can finance it intending to owner occupy and defer the decision to sell
until later. To meet the terms required by most lenders, you must agree to
occupy the property within 30 days of the home’s completion. But few loan
agreements specify exactly what occupancy means, or even how long the
occupancy must be. Lenders do become suspicious, however, if the property
is listed for sale before the loan has been converted to permanent financing.
Most construction lenders take a dim view of someone who uses this
approach more than once.
If the lender suspects that you’re building a property for speculation on an
owner-occupied program, your loan may be turned down or, at the very least,
you may be hit with a prepayment penalty (a fee charged if you sell the house
or refinance it within a specified period, usually three years). On a $600,000
house, this penalty could amount to as much as $25,000! In addition, if the
lender makes you the loan as owner occupied, and you put the house on the
market before it is finished — or, worse, default — your lender can require
the note to be paid off in full immediately and sue you for fraud, depending
upon state laws. Take our word for it; fraud is one path down which you don’t
want to walk!
How lenders view spec projects
If you’re definitely planning to sell your home immediately after it’s built and
not occupy it yourself, then you need spec financing. Spec financing comes in
two forms: well-qualified and unqualified.
Well-qualified people have
 Excellent credit
 Income that is three times the amount of their monthly expenses
165
Chapter 9: Qualifying: It’s the Bank’s Way or the Highway

 Liquid assets equal to roughly 1⁄3 the amount they’re intending to borrow
 A track record of building and selling houses successfully
If you meet these criteria, then you can walk into almost any bank and get a
spec loan for your house and begin a strong banking relationship. The loan
will probably be at an interest rate of roughly prime plus 1 percent, and the
lender will charge you 1 percent of the loan amount in loan fees called points.
(See Chapter 8 for more information on points.) The lender loans you roughly
75 percent of the value of the finished property as long as you have put in a
good chunk of cash as a down payment.
For individuals who don’t meet these requirements — that is, unqualified
borrowers — private money is the likely path, because banks are unlikely to
provide spec financing to this category of borrower. (We discuss private or
hard-money financing further in Chapter 3.)
Recognizing What a Construction 
Lender Really Wants to See
Underwriters are looking for reasons to turn a loan down, not for ways to
make sure you qualify. They are given exact “deal killer” rules that can’t be
broken under any circumstance, and they do check first to make sure that
the borrower’s package meets all these rules. Rules can include such
absolute requirements as:
 Borrowers must have a credit score of 620 or above.
 The loan-to-value ratio must be 80 percent or below.
 The property can’t be off the grid (not connected to a conventional elec-
tricity utility).
If the borrower passes this first test, then the underwriters look at guidelines
that may be a bit more gray in nature. Guidelines can include such flexible
requirements as:
 The borrower’s debt-to-income ratio must be less than 42 percent.
 The borrower needs to have an average bank balance of, say, $5,000.
 The borrower needs to have some previous experience in building a
custom home.
166
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

Unlike the case of rules, underwriters have some discretion where guidelines
are concerned. They can examine the file to see if it fits both rules and guide-
lines in all areas — credit, income, assets, and the construction project —
and then make a decision to either approve or deny the loan, based on their
best judgment.
With any given lender, you only have one chance to show off your stuff. If your
information doesn’t fit a lender’s rules and guidelines, you can’t usually go
back and resubmit your loan application with different information unless you
can document reasonable and specific reasons for the change. Submitting your
package through many different brokers can also cause problems. If two loan
applications from two different brokers are submitted with contradictory infor-
mation, the lender will be forced to turn down both applications.
We recommend that you find a knowledgeable, honest broker who will openly
communicate information about your application. She can prescreen your file
and suggest ways to meet the lender’s guidelines in an ethical manner. Stick
with that loan officer and make her earn her money. Do keep in mind, how-
ever, that what may be a hard rule for one lender, may be a flexible guideline
for another. A good mortgage broker knows these differences and can submit
your loan package accordingly, which is even more reason to be very careful
when you decide which broker to cast your lot with. We talk more about
mortgage brokers in Chapter 8.
On your credit report
Most lenders use credit scoring for underwriting. They use the three major
bureaus in the United States that report credit: Experian, TransUnion, and
Equifax. These companies all use a computer modeling system to assess your
credit and predict how you’ll perform on your loan.
The Fair Isaacs Company created the system for Experian, and your credit
score is commonly referred to as a FICO score (the other bureaus have their
own brand names for credit scores, including Beacon and Empirica).
The underwriter looks at the scores reported by the three bureaus for both
you and your spouse. She then determines the middle score of the three for
each of you and uses the lower of the two scores. Scores fall into the follow-
ing categories:
 Excellent (720+): This score qualifies you for just about any program
offered today.
 Good (680–719): With a few exceptions, most programs from most
lenders can be had with this score, including no-income-qualifier (NIQ)
loans that we address in Chapter 8.
167
Chapter 9: Qualifying: It’s the Bank’s Way or the Highway

 Fair (620–679): This score limits your choice of lenders and programs.
Many NIQ programs require scores higher than 680 or 640 for full docu-
mentation. A couple of lenders do consider scores down to 620 for both,
including IndyMac and First Horizon Bank.
 Subprime (619 or less): This category is sometimes referred to as B-
paper. Almost no institutional lenders write construction loans for
people with this credit score.
Credit scores are heavily impacted by three issues in order of importance:
 Derogatory (bad) credit: Late mortgage payments within the last 12
months do the most damage, with late payments on car or student loans
also doing major damage. Late payments on revolving debt (credit cards
or store accounts) may not be deal killers, but collection accounts, tax
liens, bankruptcies, and foreclosures do affect you if they’re recent. If
you have these problems, consult with your loan officer before paying
off anything. If you try to fix the wrong thing at the wrong time, you can
cause your score to drop even more.
 Credit card balances: The best scores go to individuals who use credit
wisely, and who keep their credit card balances under control. Ideally,
you need to have a fair amount of credit available with the balances
equaling about 35 percent of the available credit limits. Maxing out your
cards can drop your scores 20 to 50 points, so try and avoid those half-
yearly Nordstrom sales (or at least be sure to pay back your credit card
quickly!).
 Inquiries: Whenever you apply for credit — for a car loan, a credit card,
or even to rent an apartment — your prospective lender makes an
inquiry to check your credit report. This inquiry has an impact on your
credit scores. The more inquiries you have, the more you smell like
someone in financial trouble to the computers. Keep your new credit
inquiries to a minimum. You can shop an unlimited number of mortgage
companies within a 30-day period, but you always need to know who is
looking at your credit. After you know your scores, you can tell anyone
who needs to know without running it again. Beware of Internet credit-
checking services because they also generate unwanted inquiries.
Fortunately, even if you have less than stellar credit scores, you can improve
them — often, in a matter of days. The following list describes the best ways
to repair your credit if you’ve broken it somewhere along the way:
 For derogatories: If your credit report contains some incorrect informa-
tion, get a letter saying so from the reporting company. Sometimes, you
can call a company and plead for a letter; just don’t bother pleading
through the regular customer service number — they have heard it all
168
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

before. Call the CEO’s office. You won’t get the CEO, but you may get a
letter from a sympathetic vice president if you paint the right sob story
and appeal to his humanity. Getting mad doesn’t work, but crying can be
very effective (we’re not joking here!). Always make sure the letter is on
the company letterhead, references the account number, and says the
account was paid as agreed.
 For balances: Only two of the three major credit bureaus change their
scores if you pay down the balances, but that’s okay because you only
need to boost two scores to increase the middle one. If you’re in a hurry,
make an electronic payment by phone or Internet. Next, call customer
service for the creditor that you just sent the payment to and have a rep-
resentative fax you a letter on company letterhead referencing the
account number and stating the new balance.
If these methods don’t work for you, or if your issues relate to inquiries, tax
liens, bankruptcies, foreclosures, and the like, have no fear. Time is always on
your side. The credit bureaus sweep their records every 90 days or so, and
everything negative drops off your report in seven to ten years. You may think
that length of time seems like a long time, but it beats forever! More good
news: Most issues older than two years — even foreclosures and bankrupt-
cies —have minimum impact on your credit score, especially if you have re-
established a solid record of on-time payments and kept the level of your
overall debt under control. Talk to your loan officer about ways that you can
raise your scores and the necessary time frame.
On your tax returns
Income is important to construction lenders, but less so when your credit is
good and the proposed loan amount is a low percentage of the property
value. Full-documentation loans still get the best rates and terms, but not by
much. No-income qualifier loans (see Chapter 8) provide a simple alternative
when full documentation is too cumbersome, or won’t support the income
necessary for qualification. Not every lender looks at full documentation the
same, but at least most lenders look for some standards when calculating
your gross monthly income (GMI):
 Salaried: Lenders look at two years’ W-2s and tax returns accompanied
by the most recent pay stub. Lenders want stable employment for two
years and give full value to the current salary. Bonuses and overtime are
averaged over 24 months.
 Commissioned: People with variable income have to provide their most
recent two years’ tax returns. Their income is averaged, and business
expenses listed on the tax returns are deducted from income. Lenders
want to see consistent or increasing income.
169
Chapter 9: Qualifying: It’s the Bank’s Way or the Highway

 Self-employed: Anyone who owns 25+ percent of a company is consid-
ered self-employed. The lender asks for two years’ personal and busi-
ness tax returns, as well as a year-to-date profit and loss statement (YTD
P&L). The lender adds all three totals together, as well as any deprecia-
tion. The total is divided by 24 plus the months covered in the P&L and
added to personal income.
 Other income: Nothing gets missed by lenders; they look at any other
income or losses you have from rental properties, investments, partner-
ships, and other sources. Two years’ averages are used, and your
income will be adjusted by the profits or losses.
Construction lenders want to make sure you have enough income to make
timely payments for your new home, as well as any other payments you have
to make, such as for cars and student loans. To figure this amount, they use
debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. Two ratios are represented, but only the second
ratio — the back-end ratio — really matters. This ratio tells the bank what
percentage of your income will be needed to cover PITI (principal, interest,
taxes, and insurance), as well as all your other monthly credit payments.
Here are the steps to calculating the back-end ratio:
1. You need to know the loan payment.
Estimate a loan amount (you have to start somewhere) and find out the
current interest rates from your loan officer. Have your loan officer cal-
culate the principal and interest payment, or you can use one of the
many Internet calculators like www.mortgage-calc.com.
2. Calculate the property taxes.
Take the house’s projected future value and multiply it by 1.25 percent.
This amount is the annual tax rate in most areas; you may need to adjust
it slightly in your own neighborhood. Divide this number by 12 to get the
monthly amount.
3. Calculate the insurance.
Take the loan amount and multiply it by 0.35 percent. (Lenders use this
number as an estimate.) Divide by 12 for the monthly amount. Add the
amounts from the first three steps to get your PITI.
4. Add in any installment payments that still have ten months or more to
go, such as car and student loans, as well as minimum payments on
your credit cards.
If you have your own business that pays for these items, they don’t
figure into the ratio.
5. Take the total and divide by your gross monthly income.
If the number is bigger than 0.45, you probably need to consider a no-
income qualifier loan of some kind.
170
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

This step-by-step version is a simplified, back-of-the-envelope description of
debt-to-income assessment, and many more variables can affect it, depending
on the complexity of your income and investments. If you’re at all unsure of
where you stand, meet with an experienced loan officer and walk through the
information until you both understand it. By doing so you can avoid sur-
prises when the loan is underwritten.
In your bank accounts
When it comes to your bank accounts, you need cash, cash, and more cash!
(You can also take a closer look at Chapter 7 to discover how important cash
is.) Banks know that the surest way to protect a construction project from
utter disaster is a big pile of readily available money, which means cash in
your bank account. Note the following areas of concern related to underwrit-
ing for cash:
 Cash in the project: The bank evaluates all other cash requirements
after it accounts for any money needed for the project. The section
“Calculating the Loan Amount and Cash,” later in this chapter, can help
you determine this number. This money needs to be deposited in escrow
before the bank will fund the loan.
 Cash-reserve requirements: Some bank guidelines require very specific
cash reserves. Cash reserves are the funds you have left in savings or
investment after you put all the required funds into the project. The
guidelines vary depending upon the loan type and the institution making
the loan. Banks commonly base reserves on multiples of the PITI. Most
lenders want to see anywhere from 2 to 24 months PITI verified as
reserves. The number of months depends on the loan product’s risk. No-
income qualifier loans and low credit scores can boost the amount of
reserves required.
 Money to support income: The banks want to know that the cash you
have in the bank reflects your earnings. This information is especially
important when using a loan where you aren’t providing any income
documentation. The guidelines for this amount vary from bank to bank.
Often the bank doesn’t have clear guidelines, simply saying that the 
situation needs to make sense. For example, if you’re claiming to make
$12,000 every month, the bank may be concerned that you average less
than $5,000 in cash in your bank account. Sometimes the bank sets a
specific rule, such as having two months’ stated income in the bank 
(in this example, $24,000).
171
Chapter 9: Qualifying: It’s the Bank’s Way or the Highway

Ask your loan officer to help you determine the specific amount of cash nec-
essary to qualify before you provide any asset information such as bank
statements. If you show the bank that your assets are insufficient, you may be
stuck — no matter what you do to build them up later. Discussing the guide-
lines with the bank in the abstract is okay, but the bank must use any docu-
mentation that you give it. A mortgage broker may have more flexibility in
only providing the most recent information to prospective lenders.
When banks verify your liquid assets (cash and assets that can be turned into
cash quickly, such as stock or money market funds), they want to make sure
the money has been there for a period of time and not recently borrowed to
beef up your account, causing the need to make payments or pay it back.
When new money magically appears, the bank always wants to identify the
source of funds. The underwriter looks for the 60-day average balance to
determine if the money is seasoned. If you don’t currently have seasoned
funds, you may have to wait 60 days before applying for the loan.
An experienced loan officer knows the banks’ quirks they’re working with and
can guide you through the best process to meet their particular cash guide-
lines. For example, some banks accept unseasoned funds if they came from a
line of credit secured by real estate. The earlier you address the issue of cash
with your loan officer, the better chance you have of fixing the problem
before the lender sees it.
Lenders don’t treat all money equally. Lenders give different values to your
liquid assets:
 Checking and savings accounts: Lenders accept 100 percent of the sea-
soned balance in these accounts.
 Stock: Lenders accept 100 percent of the vested, seasoned balance in
these accounts, provided they’re publicly traded and verifiable.
 Retirement and 401(k): Lenders accept only 50 to 60 percent of these
balances, accounting for taxes and penalties assessed by the govern-
ment on early distributions.
 Company accounts for self-employed: Some lenders accept 100 percent
of the seasoned balance in these accounts, others only accept 50 per-
cent, and still others don’t let you use them at all. You can sometimes
move the money out of your business and into your personal account
with documentation and a letter from your company’s CPA stating it will
do no harm to the company.
172

On the appraisal
The appraisal represents the marketable value of the lender’s security —
your new home. Custom home appraisers have the difficult job of determin-
ing the value of a house that doesn’t yet exist. Truthfully, appraisers can’t tell
you what the real value is for a house, because the only true, real value is
what someone is willing to pay for it. What they can do is give you an assess-
ment of your home’s probable value based upon comparable properties that
have sold in the area within the not-too-distant past.
An appraisal is a regulated form that describes every detail of your property
based upon the appraiser’s physical inspection, as well as the plans that you
provide. The appraiser probably also asks you for a breakdown of the cost
for your build and a description of the materials you’re going to use. The
bank looks at the appraisal’s first page to make sure that the property’s
planned construction satisfies bank guidelines.
Lenders require the appraiser to find comparable properties, that is, proper-
ties that are close in size to your own, that are within a mile in location, and
that have sold within the last six months. Finding properties that meet these
rules isn’t always possible, but the appraiser needs to get as close as he can.
Perhaps the most important page of an appraisal is a graph of three or more
comparable properties, adjusting their values based upon the ways they are
better or worse than your custom home. Look at Figure 9-1 for an example of
how these adjustments impact the adjusted value of the subject property.
The appraisal is the most subjective part of the loan process, and the bank
often reviews an independent appraisal and decides to use a value that is
somewhat less than what is stated. If the bank uses a reduced value to qualify
your loan, the bank lowers your loan amount forcing you to make up the dif-
ference out of pocket. Never assume that the bank will take the appraisal at
face value — the process can sometimes be arbitrary and perhaps even a bit
unfair.
Many people pressure appraisers to push their property’s value as high as
possible, which can backfire, however, when word of these tactics gets back
to the lender. If the lender feels the property value is stretched, you can be
sure that the value will be drastically cut, lowering the loan amount. Our
advice is to let the appraiser be a bit more conservative, if the value is
enough to support your loan. It works even better when your loan officer
knows which appraisers your lenders favor the most.

Building the Bank’s Construction Budget
This section covers all the math, what Kevin calls the Construction Mechanics —
the first thing he teaches to loan officers and underwriters. Some of the num-
bers are reliant upon each other so you may have to initially come up with 
estimates in order to get the final numbers in place.
The key point to understand when looking at the construction budget through
the bank’s eyes is that the bank underwriter wants every single dollar for con-
struction covered on the day that you close the loan. The biggest risk to the
bank is taking back the property when it’s partially complete. Because the
property is no longer a piece of land nor a finished house, the bank would have
a difficult time selling it and recouping its funds. Making sure the construction
budget has plenty of money is in the bank’s best interest so the bank can use
those funds to finish the project if necessary and sell it.
Each bank constructs its budget differently, so you need to ask the bank how
it treats each of the components talked about in this section. If you undercal-
culate, you may have to bring in cash to start the project or you may simply
get turned down altogether. Also, make sure that the loan officer you’re deal-
ing with understands the terms clearly. Many loan officers are inexperienced
with their own programs (much less anyone else’s programs) and the terms
necessary to make them work.
Our recommendation is to have budget discussions with your loan officer
three or more times until you’re sure the answers you’re getting have been
thoroughly researched and are consistent. These discussions may seem terri-
bly redundant, but you only get one shot at the underwriter and, believe us,
in this case it’s far better to be safe than sorry.
To start the budget process, you need to establish a cost breakdown account-
ing for all the costs associated with the build and financing. We describe each
of the cost breakdown components in this section with a corresponding
letter (“factor”) so you can easily plug them into the formula at the end (see
“Totaling up the cost-to-build”).
Figuring the land: Factor A
Different lenders evaluate your land differently based upon the time you have
owned it. Most lenders want to see the land seasoned for at least one year, for
them to give you the benefit of any appreciation. If you have owned your land
for less than a year, then you need to use the land’s original price in your
budget.
If you’ve owned the land for more than a year, use your loan payoff amount
for the budget. Few construction lenders allow the land loan to stay in first
175
Chapter 9: Qualifying: It’s the Bank’s Way or the Highway

position (before the secured position of the new construction loan on title),
and most require the land to be paid off with the new loan. To calculate the
payoff, follow these steps:
1. Check the most recent statement on your land loan and start with the
loan balance.
2. Add any prepayment penalties or payoff fees. Call the lender if you’re
not sure whether other fees are due.
3. Add one month’s payment because you may have interest due when
you close the construction loan.
Soft or indirect costs: Factor B
Soft (or indirect) costs aren’t included in the actual physical construction of
your home. Generally, these costs include such items as permits, plans, and
fees. Soft costs can be a bit confusing because some costs, such as builder
overhead, can be considered soft or hard. In these types of situations, you
have to make the decision when constructing the budget. Your loan officer
can probably offer some guidance. Be aware that sometimes the placement of
some items may change based upon the lender’s guidelines. Pick a section
that makes sense to you and keep it consistent unless the bank asks you to
change it. The following is a list of standard soft costs for you to total in this
section (You can find many specific descriptions of these costs in Chapters 5
and 6.):
 Architecture fees
 Design-review fees
 Engineering fees
 Permits — city and county
 Plan check fees
 School fees
 Soils and geotechnical reports
 Utility connection fees
Hard costs (board and nail): Factor C
Hard costs represent the actual physical construction work and materials
used to build your home, including the cost of materials and labor. Hard
176
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

costs must reflect the overhead and the contractor’s profit. Sometimes these
specific costs (overhead and contractor’s profits) are listed as soft costs but
it’s easier for the lender if contractor funds aren’t split up. Contractors really
aren’t anxious to disclose their margins anyway; what’s most important for
you is the total cost. If the contractor gives you a fair price, then his profit
margin isn’t your concern.
If you’re early in the planning process, then you need to use the dollar-per-
square-foot method for calculating hard costs, as we outline in Chapter 2.
Doing so gives you a good first shot at a number to work with, but expect to
make changes along the way. If you’ve already obtained bids from your con-
tractor and subs (also see Chapter 2), then you need to have a fairly reason-
able estimate of your build after you extract any soft costs.
The contingency: Factor D
The contingency is an amount of money set aside for unanticipated expenses.
The fact is, about 99 percent of all projects go over budget — contractors
consistently underbid projects to get the job, and consumers are notoriously
overoptimistic about how much building their new home is actually going to
cost. So, most lenders add a contingency to provide a cushion for cost over-
runs. Most lenders calculate the contingency by multiplying the hard-cost
total by 5 percent, rounding this number to the nearest $500.
Some lenders use higher percentages depending on the other terms of the
loan. Be sure to get accurate information from your loan officer regarding the
contingency and how it’s calculated. Be aware that lenders still add a contin-
gency, even if the contractor has already stated his own contingency as a line
item in the bid.
If your budget is running tight, you can discuss the option of removing the
contractor’s contingency from the estimate. Tell the contractor you’ll assign
the bank’s contingency to him to avoid duplication of money being held.
Calculating the interest reserve: Factor E
The interest reserve is a portion of the loan set aside to make construction
loan payments during the build. Some banks require it because they know
you have to pay to live somewhere during the build, and they don’t want you
to be stretched by double payments. The interest reserve is their way of
insuring that their loan is kept current. Not every bank requires an interest
reserve.
177
Chapter 9: Qualifying: It’s the Bank’s Way or the Highway

Because a construction loan functions like a giant credit line that you draw
upon as you go through the build process, you won’t be paying interest on
the entire loan amount until the very end. Use this simple formula to calcu-
late a rough interest reserve:
1. Estimate a loan amount.
You can start by adding Factors A, B, and C in this section, and then
increasing the total by 10 percent. Subtract any down payment you
made on the land. Doing so can put you in the ballpark.
2. Multiply your estimated loan amount by 60 percent.
Doing so accounts for the partial use of money over the loan’s term.
Because you take money out of the loan as work is completed (see
Chapter 10), the bank figures you’ll use roughly 60 percent of the loan
amount during the construction period on average.
3. Now multiply by the interest rate.
Banks offer different interest rates and, if you know the one you’re taking,
you can use that one. If you haven’t picked a rate yet, you can use prime
+ 2.5 percent. Doing so gives you a good benchmark. You can find today’s
prime rate at www.forecasts.org/prime.htm.
4. If your loan is for a term of 12 months, then you’re done.
If your loan is for a different term, you need to divide by 12 and then
multiply by the number of months you’ll have the construction loan, be
it 6, 9, 18, and so forth. You can round this number to the nearest $500 in
the early stage.
Loan closing costs: Factor F
In Chapter 8 we include a complete explanation of fees for construction
loans, so we only give the condensed version here. Along with all the lender’s
and title company’s fees, you need to account for the cost of your insurance
as outlined in Chapter 2. Costs vary depending upon the terms and size of
the loan. You can get most of these estimates from your loan officer and
insurance agent. In case you don’t have access to them, multiply your esti-
mated loan amount by 4 percent. This amount may seem high, but again, it’s
better to be safe than sorry.
Totaling up the cost-to-build
Time to put it all together. Add Factors A through F from this section. Your
calculation needs to look something like this example:
178
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

Factors
Amounts
A: Land cost
$125,000 (includes $50,000 down payment)
B: Soft costs
$ 25,000
C: Hard costs
$360,000
D: Contingency
$ 18,000
E: Interest reserve
$ 20,500
F: Closing costs
$ 21,000
TOTAL
$569,500
This amount is your total estimated cost-to-build. Take this number with you
to the next section of this chapter.
Calculating the Loan Amount and Cash
Now that you have a pretty good estimate of your project’s cost (see the
“Totaling up the cost-to-build” section), you can figure out how much cash is
needed and what size loan is necessary. This section tells you if your project
is going to fly through underwriting or come to a screeching halt.
Lenders use the appraisal and the cost-to-build to establish their maximum
loan amount. After you understand the formulas they use, you can work them
backwards and forwards to find the combination of cost, value, loan, and
cash that works best for your situation. At the very least, these calculations
can serve as the basis for an excellent conversation with your loan officer.
Basing the loan on finished value — LTV
Loan-to-value, or LTV, refers to what percent of the appraised value the loan
represents. LTV guidelines vary based upon the size of the loan and the
income documentation. Most lenders loan between 65 and 90 percent LTV for
construction. No-income qualifying loans usually drop the LTV by 5 percent
or more. Sometimes lenders allow your loan to exceed these guidelines on an
exception basis, but expect to pay additional fees for the privilege. Here is a
typical full documentation scale:
Loan Amount
LTV
$0 to 400,000
90%
$401,000 to $650,000
80%
179
Chapter 9: Qualifying: It’s the Bank’s Way or the Highway

Loan Amount
LTV
$651,000 to $999,000
75%
$1 million to $1.5 million
70%
More than $1.5 million
65%
Using this previous example, you can now figure out what the appraised
value of your new home needs to be to get your loan approved. Simply take
the cost-to-build of $569,500 and subtract the $50,000 down payment already
made on the land. Now take the remaining $519,500 — which is the loan
amount — and divide by 80 percent as designated in the chart. In this exam-
ple, the finished house needs to appraise for at least $649,375 for the loan to
be approved. If comparable houses are selling for less, you’ll need to adjust
your budget, or bring cash to close.
Basing the loan on cost-to-build — LTC
Loan-to-cost, or LTC, refers to what percent of the cost-to-build the loan
amount represents. If you have owned the lot for more than one year, most
lenders will finance 100 percent of the cost-to-build, provided the loan
amount doesn’t exceed their other guidelines such as LTV.
When you’ve owned the property for less than a year, the lender wants to see
that you have some sort of down payment invested in your project. Many
lenders use the same percentage for LTV and LTC, simply allowing the lower
of the two to determine their loan amounts. Using the example in the previ-
ous section, if your house appraised at $650,000, it would meet the 80 percent
LTV guideline. However, because the cost-to-build is less, the lender using
this method would only loan you 80 percent of $569,500, or $455,600. You
would then need to make up the $63,900 difference, accounting for the
$50,000 down payment already made.
Some lenders recognize that you can often build for less than the value of
existing houses in the neighborhood. These lenders are usually the national
lenders and rarely the local banks. They figure there must be some profit
margin in new construction, otherwise, why would spec builders build. These
lenders offer an LTC percentage higher than the LTV. This percentage typi-
cally ranges from 85 to 95 percent of the cost-to-build. Using the higher LTC,
the lender loans at LTC up to the LTV. In other words, regardless of LTC, they
don’t exceed the LTV guidelines without an exception.
180
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

Looking at our example a little closer, if the lender offers 85 percent LTC up 
to 80 percent of value, you’d first calculate the LTC: 85 percent of $569,500 is
$484,075. With an appraisal of $650,000, the LTV allows a maximum of $520,000.
Because $484,075 is the lower of the two, the lender would use that as the max-
imum loan amount. The cash to close would be $569,500, minus the loan of
$484,075, minus the $50,000 down payment — requiring the difference of
$35,425 to be deposited at loan closing.
LTC makes an excellent litmus test for the quality of your loan officer. If your
loan officer can’t explain the difference between LTV and LTC, run — don’t
walk — to someone fluent in this process. LTC ignorance causes more than 50
percent of loans to get into trouble in underwriting. Unfortunately, no formal
training classes on the LTC subject are available, so most loan officers have to
figure it out on their own from experience. Don’t settle for second best when
entrusting your life savings with someone you may have just met last week.
Calculating the cash needed 
for the project
After you have the loan amount, figuring the necessary cash is relatively
simple. Take the cost-to-build and subtract the maximum loan amount.
Whatever is left is the cash required for the loan. If you have already put that
much in the project, then you don’t need to do anything else. However, you
need to deposit any shortage with the title company before the lender will
fund the construction loan.
One of the great things about construction loans is that time works in your
favor. You can plan a project on a timeline that allows you to put the cash in a
little at a time as shown in Figure 9-2. Some money goes in for the down pay-
ment, and you can pay soft costs along the way until the lender is ready to
fund your loan.
Lenders generally treat paid receipts for soft and hard costs the same as
cash. They happily adjust the budget at escrow to account for any items that
may have been paid since the loan process began. Keep in mind, however,
that you’ll likely need to show real proof of payment. Canceled checks are
best accompanied by receipts marked “Paid” by your vendors. Just showing
your check register or copies of checks not yet canceled usually doesn’t fly
with an underwriter.

Solving Other Budget Problems
Budgeting to the lenders’ guidelines can be difficult, especially because they
vary from lender to lender and change quite often with market conditions.
This section contains some challenging issues that can result in major
headaches for you along the way.
Landscaping and finish work 
can kill the project
Landscaping (trees, shrubs, and pools) and finish work (crown moldings and
built-in home theater systems) generally take the most time and money to
complete. Ironically, they usually bring the least amount of value to the
appraisal. This poses two problems for a construction loan:
 Time: As discussed in Chapter 8, a construction loan establishes a set
time frame for the house to be completed before the lender charges
penalties (which can be quite expensive, by the way). You can finish
most of the house, but if the finish work (described in Chapter 14) or the
landscaping (described in Chapter 17) drag out the project, it can get
very pricey.
 Value: Approximately $50,000 in extra finish work probably adds only
$20,000 to your property’s appraised value. The same is true for land-
scaping. A lender loaning 80 percent LTV only gives you $16,000 toward
the $50,000, which means you have to make up the difference of $34,000
out of pocket.
If your budget is running tight, we highly recommend initially keeping your
finish materials to a minimum, and they need to be of similar quality to other
houses in the neighborhood. You can always upgrade later in the build
process if you have the cash or come in under budget. If you’re committed to
spending money for extra finish, it’s never a question of what you spend, but
rather, when you have to spend it.
You can eliminate landscaping from the budget entirely. Most lenders don’t
require it for completion. Pools, spas, and gardens don’t give you dollar-for-
dollar value anyway, and they can drag out your project for months. Pay for
these expenses out of pocket when the house and the construction loan is
done.
183
Chapter 9: Qualifying: It’s the Bank’s Way or the Highway

Costing — What if I can 
build on the cheap?
Because banks are concerned about whether they’ll be able to recover their
investment in you if they have to take back the property in the event of fore-
closure, they’re very wary of underestimating the build. Many banks have
contractors on staff who have the job of assessing your cost breakdown to
make sure it seems realistic. If your bank is unsure, it may insist on a higher
loan amount or more cash if there is no room for a bigger loan. Your bank
may also ask to see the bids from the subs. Overestimating is in your best
interest, because running out of money midway through your project can be
a disaster.
What if I need more cash 
than is in my budget?
Most banks have no problem when you overestimate the budget as long as
the loan still meets LTV and LTC guidelines. Overestimating allows you to fluff
up the cost breakdown to give you extra funds along the way. Because the
bank reimburses based upon your estimates (as explained in Chapter 10),
you can use this extra money for other expenses, such as land reimburse-
ment or upgrades on finish materials.
The bank generally lets you borrow the entire loan amount even if you don’t
use it all for construction, so overestimation is another way of funding your
landscaping and finish work without taking the risks.

 Setting up who gets paid

A
fter your project gets going, you somehow have to pay all the people
who are building your home and supplying the materials. Because this
project likely represents more money than you have ever spent on anything
in your life (unless you paid a lot of money for your car!), you need to under-
stand how the money moves from one place to another.
In this chapter we discuss how to manage a self-funded project, and we walk
you through the different methods that banks use to keep their fingers in
your custom home construction pie. We let you in on how the bank likes to
see a project proceed. We also share our exclusive way to pay yourself with 
a vacation when the project is finished. Along the way, we provide you with
tips on how to best protect yourself from problems.
Managing a Self-Funded Project
Many people decide to bank their entire project out of their own cash or sav-
ings. In fact, 20 percent of all custom homeowners pay for their project with-
out the use of a bank loan. This fact may work when you have enough cash 
in your investments to pay for it (we’re assuming you sold off that dot-com
stock before the bubble burst!), or you may have sold or refinanced your
home to obtain the cash. You can find a discussion of the pros and cons to
building a custom home using your own cash in Chapter 7.
The greatest benefit of using your own cash stems from being able to control
all the funds yourself. The bad news is that you have to develop your own

system of management and accounting for all the many checks that you have
to write (and, believe us, there will be many!). (We provide suggestions for
organizing your accounting systems in Chapter 2.)
Many of the systems already used by banks can meet your needs for keeping
financial control over your project. Simply adapt the systems we talk about in
this chapter to fit the needs of you and your contractor. And, while you’re at
it, make sure that you hold the contractor to that system. Not surprisingly,
with fewer outside controls, self-funded projects often go over budget or get
into trouble. See Chapter 11 for information on working with your contractor
and dealing with ongoing budget issues.
Because you don’t need to use your cash all at once (banks figure you will
use roughly 60 percent of the total budget over the length of the build), over
the course of the project, you can take chunks of the funds and diversify
them among various interest-paying investments. This money management
allows you to earn additional interest on your money while you build your
house. For more information on how to manage this cash safely, be sure to
take a look at Investing For Dummies, 3rd edition, by Eric Tyson.
Working with a Bank
Because most of you will likely borrow money for this project, you’ll have to
manage the money according to a bank’s rules — as the Golden Rule of Credit
says: He who owns the gold makes the rules! Construction lenders (which
almost always are banks) have designed these rules and systems after many
years of trial and error. At times, their rules may seem arbitrary and ridicu-
lous. But after solving many issues with the way banks hand out money
(called disbursement, by the way), we have figured out that all their rules are
designed primarily to protect their investment. Fortunately, the money they
have invested in your custom home project is mixed with all the rest of your
investment in your custom home, which means that you and the bank have
the same interests of a successful project at heart.
Of course, you don’t get 
all the money upfront
Banks only fund money for construction through a construction loan. Con-
struction loans are different from other types of mortgages because they’re
designed to pay money in a metered fashion for the construction of the
home. The loan amount is decided based upon the value of the completed
project instead of the worth of the home today, like other mortgages. For a
detailed explanation of what makes construction loans unique and how they
work, read Chapter 8.
186
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

Banks structure a construction loan like a credit line. Effectively, you get 
a credit card with a large available balance that you can use to withdraw
money as you need (and, like a credit card, you eventually have to pay it all
back, plus interest!). For the most part, you can decide when and if you want
to draw on that credit card. The only exception (and it’s a big exception) is
that you do have to meet certain criteria in order to take the bank’s money
and put it to use on your project. For some reason, banks don’t particularly
like the idea of putting several hundred thousand dollars into someone’s
hands without making sure that person’s using the money to pay the proper
people to do the proper job. You’ll find yourself operating under a process 
of checks and balances, regardless of the reimbursement system your bank
uses.
Chapter 8 covers how to develop a construction budget and cost breakdown
for your project. That budget and cost breakdown now serve as the basis for
how you can draw money from the bank. At this point, the bank has estab-
lished a loan-in-process account (LIP). Have no fear; every item that you
accounted for in your budget is included in the LIP. Now you just have to
determine the method and timing for distributing the funds. With the excep-
tions of deposits for materials, money generally comes from the bank after
workers have done their job. The bank requires some proof of payment or
completion in the form of inspections and maybe receipts before it hands
over (or disburses) the funds.
Preparing for inspection
So, how does the bank know if you’re doing what you’re supposed to do —
especially if your home-to-be is in Ohio, and your bank is in Arizona? The bank
performs this little miracle with the help of field inspectors. Field inspectors —
who may work directly for the bank, or who may be third parties hired by the
bank — visit your job site and physically inspect your progress. Here’s a bit of
insider knowledge: These inspectors don’t always have extensive experience in
construction, and most aren’t contractors. In fact, some banks contract with
the original loan appraiser for the inspections. The point is that you may know
more about your project than your inspector does.
When you make a request to your bank for money, an inspector will make an
appointment to come to the job site. It’s our experience that you have the
best success with an inspector when you, the contractor, and the inspector
walk the property together. Many decisions about the status of project com-
pletion may not be black and white. An inspector left to her own opinions
may jump to conclusions that may work against you. It’s your job to ensure
that the inspector sees the project through your eyes.
Even though the bank controls the money, it isn’t responsible for the quality
of the work. The bank’s inspectors are only interested in checking to see that
the payments made by the bank are in sync with the project’s progress.
187
Chapter 10: Show Me the Money

Considering that these inspectors only get paid $25 to $50 for these visits,
they usually don’t put much, if any, time or energy into checking the work
quality, and don’t expect them to. Furthermore, the bank doesn’t really want
the added hassle of liability for inspecting the quality of work in case you and
the contractor end up in a dispute down the road.
Battling the bank
Anytime people are working through a complicated process with money on
the line, disagreements are bound to happen. Most people in the construc-
tion lending industry prefer to put their head in the sand and sell you on the
ease of their particular process. Don’t believe it. In this section we lay out the
honest truth about dealing with banks when you find yourself in conflict,
along with our insights into potential problems and ways of resolving them.
During the building process, any discrepancies between the original budget
and the cost breakdown later submitted to the bank can become a point of
discussion with your contractor, as well as your bank. Even though you’re
building your house and heading your project, the money that you borrow
ultimately belongs to the bank. The bank loans it to you in a secured manner
and diligently monitors your project to protect its interests. Sometimes the
bank agrees with how you see it, and sometimes the bank takes a different
view. But keep in mind that you have to see everything the bank’s way. The
bank is under no obligation to loan you money if it chooses not to, and if
everything doesn’t go the way the bank wants it to, the bank can cancel the
loan in a heartbeat.
Despite the frustration you may feel dealing with the bank’s bureaucracy, rest
assured that you and the bank have the same goal: completing the house in a
timely manner. Use this shared aim as common ground when discussing your
difficulties. Remember, although the bank is contractually obligated to pro-
vide you with all the money it promised if you meet the commitments you
made in the construction lending agreement and budget (discussed in detail
in Chapter 8), getting to that point may require flexibility.
The surest way to protect yourself and your project is to have access to
plenty of cash beyond your construction loan (from savings, relatives, loans,
or the cookie jar in your kitchen) to keep the project moving. Having access
to this extra funding allows you to keep paying people and to keep building,
putting off the handling of disputes until later, when the pressure isn’t quite
so intense.

Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

Understanding How the 
Voucher System Works
The voucher system was the primary way of paying construction loans for
decades. Many banks, however, have found that the voucher system requires
too much paperwork and people chasing. As a result, many banks are shifting
to the draw system, which we discuss later in the “Taking a Closer Look at
the Draw Reimbursement System” section.
The draw system is a little more lenient than the voucher system, so banks
looking to keep tight control on their funds during the custom home–building
process — and to make sure that all parties have met their obligations along
the way — still tend to use the voucher system.
The voucher system starts with your cost breakdown, which breaks down the
various stages of your project into specific costs for labor and materials (see
Chapter 8 for more details on putting together your cost breakdown). The
voucher is simply a piece of paper that looks like an oversized check. The
front side of the voucher has a place for the date, the amount that the bank
will pay, to whom it will pay the amount, and a description of exactly what
work or materials the voucher should cover.
On the back of the voucher, you can find a place for the supplier or subcontrac-
tor to enter pertinent business information, such as its address and Employer
Identification Number (the issuing bank needs this number because it has to
report all money it has paid for tax purposes). Last, but not least, you can see a
paragraph releasing any rights that the supplier or sub may have to put a lien
on the property.
In short, the bank is saying “we paid you your money, now leave us alone.”
After you have given the voucher to your suppliers or subs, they must fill out
the necessary information and provide the original invoices and bids to the
bank, when requested. After the bank inspector has verified that the work
has been completed, the bank pays the amount requested on the voucher
directly to the suppliers or subs by cashier’s check.
Most people in the custom home industry agree that the rigid voucher system
provides the most accountability; however many banks and contractors find it
cumbersome in the increasingly fast-paced and flexible building world. In our
experience, the voucher system can be a useful way to manage the payment of
construction funds to your project and includes the following benefits:
 You can use it when a contractor isn’t financially strong. For example,
he may be cash poor or have problems with credit or is in a disputed sit-
uation. The voucher system gives you added controls to make sure the
money goes where it needs to go.
189
Chapter 10: Show Me the Money

 This system can also help protect you and the bank against mechanic’s
liens. A mechanic’s lien is a legal method for contractors in dispute to
guarantee they will get paid. You can find a detailed discussion of
mechanic’s liens in Chapter 11.
 It provides tight budget control handled by a third party (the bank).
This keeps arguments over money to a minimum between you and your
contractor because everything must meet bank approval.
But the voucher system isn’t always a bed of roses. Here are some key 
drawbacks:
 It requires multiple signatures from multiple parties. Having to track
down all those John Hancocks can be time-consuming or impossible if
the parties travel a lot.
 It requires strict adherence to the budget, without much room for cost
overruns. This system creates a problem if the project has wide varia-
tions from the budget.
 It requires the collection of additional paperwork. Talk about a hassle!
Ultimately, the bank dictates the system it prefers to use for its purposes.
The bank normally tries to have one system for efficiency, but some banks do
offer you a choice between the voucher system and the draw system, which
we discuss in the next section.
Taking a Closer Look at the Draw
Reimbursement System
Banks call the most common disbursement process used today draw reim-
bursement. This system puts the bulk of accounting responsibility on you and
your contractor. This system has the bank use your original project line-item
cost breakdown as a guide and allows you to request reimbursement on a
designated schedule after the work is completed.
Some banks use specific schedules of four to seven draws (or money payouts)
based on the completion of certain milestones, such as foundation or framing.
Others allow you to take draws on a monthly basis, collecting partial payment
for work and material items that haven’t been fully completed.
Unlike the voucher system, banks using a draw reimbursement system gener-
ally wire the funds from an LIP account to any account that the borrower wants
(try to avoid, however, having the money sent to a numbered Swiss account —
that wouldn’t do much to instill the confidence of your loan officer!).
190
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

The draw system is popular because
 It requires less work. Although this system still needs bank inspectors
just like the voucher system, with the draw system the bank doesn’t
require subs and suppliers to sign off at every disbursement.
The bank checks with the title company to insure that the property is
free and clear from any liens at the time of disbursement. The bank does
this check, using a 122 Endorsement (which we discuss in Chapter 8).
Eventually, you must show the bank all lien sign-offs by the end of the
project.
 It’s easier to use than the voucher system. For example, today some
banks let you request draws electronically through the Internet, offering
speedier payment and greater convenience.
Banks like the draw reimbursement system because their end is simpler, and
it helps keep the project moving. However, the draw system still does have a
couple of drawbacks:
 Banks scrutinize more. Because banks take on the bigger risk of every-
one getting paid properly, they tend to look a little closer at issues of
your contractor’s credit and your own available cash.
 You may have to jump through a few more hoops to get approved.
Because the draw reimbursement system only pays for work completed,
you or the contractor may have to lay out money first before the bank
pays you back. You may have to show the bank you have more cash on
hand before you get approved. (To look at specific liquidity require-
ments of most banks, check out Chapter 9.)
In the sections that follow, we consider some specific issues related to the
draw reimbursement system.
Figuring which costs are which
In order to get your funds reimbursed from the bank, you have to figure out
how to speak a bit of the bank’s language. The bank will refer to your line
item cost breakdown every time you request money. It’s referred to as a line
item cost breakdown because each section of work and materials (such as
rough framing or permits) is called a line item. Your bank refers to these line
items as either hard or soft costs. Banks agree mostly on what is a hard cost
and what is a soft cost, however, we have found that different banks treat cer-
tain line items (such as builder overhead) differently. If you have concerns,
you can usually contact the bank’s disbursement officer and she can explain
it to you. Being clear on the definition between hard and soft costs is impor-
tant because the banks disburse hard and soft costs in different ways.
191
Chapter 10: Show Me the Money

Soft-cost reimbursement
Soft costs (also known as offsite costs) are generally the fastest funds to get paid
back from the bank, but they also require the most paperwork. You’ll have paid
many of the soft costs before the construction loan is in place. These costs —
which can include architecture, permits, engineering, and school fees — aren’t
related to the labor or materials in your project. Because these line items don’t
lend themselves to inspection, the bank wants specific accounting and copies
of paid receipts. Stricter banks want to see copies of cancelled checks for these
costs. Most banks reimburse these costs within 24 to 48 hours because they
don’t have to send someone to the property before payment.
Banks only pay the amount of the proven receipts. If you estimated high,
your bank keeps the money in the LIP account (described in the “Of course,
you don’t get all the money upfront” section, earlier in this chapter). If you
underestimated, you have to cover any overages. You can also draw from the
contingency we discuss in the following section.
Hard-cost reimbursement
Now, you’ve officially arrived at the meat and potatoes of your building 
funds — hard-cost reimbursement. Hard costs include the labor and materials
associated with the foundation, framing, finish, and complete building of your
project. After the build has begun, you can draw upon these funds on an
item-by-item basis as you complete each appropriate section.
Each time you make a request, you have to submit a form (see Figure 10-1)
telling the bank how much of each line item (a particular construction task or
job) you have completed. Notice that the cost breakdown in Figure 10-1 reflects
the money paid, as well as the money requested. This breakdown helps you
and the bank keep track of the percentage of total available funds left to draw
on each line item. Before the bank releases the funds, the bank inspector
comes out to the property to see if he agrees with your assessment. If so, the
inspector notifies the bank, and the bank wires the funds for the amount that
you requested to your account. If not, then you and the bank need to discuss
the situation until you agree upon an amount.
When requesting reimbursement for line items that can be either hard or soft
costs — such as builder overhead or profit — the bank generally pays these
amounts out in a percentage proportionate to how far along you are in the
entire project. For example, if you have drawn 35 percent of all the hard
costs, the bank allows you to draw up to 35 percent of the builder’s overhead.
To save money on your project if you’re short on cash when starting to build,
some banks may advance you up to 5 percent of the hard costs to get the
project started. In addition, if your construction loan was put in place after
you’ve already begun to build, you may be able to request an immediate draw
to catch up your cash. Discuss these needs with your lender when applying
for your construction loan. You can find more information in Chapter 8 about
funding after you start your build.

Chapter 10: Show Me the Money

Managing the flow of funds with 
percentages and contingencies
Banks using the draw system are constantly managing the flow of funds on a
percentage of completion basis, that is, the amount of your custom home that is
finished. For the most part, however, they work with you if you want to move
cash from one line item to another (say, for example, if you’re under budget on
one part of the project but need more money somewhere else), as long as your
project is within a reasonable percentage of completion. Understand that their
interpretation of reasonable may or may not match your interpretation. For
example, if you stated that your framing was going to cost you $35,000 and it
only cost you $20,000, the bank will probably happily let you use the extra
$15,000 elsewhere in the build. However, problems may occur when the bank
figures out that you’ve completed 50 percent of the house and you’re request-
ing draws exceeding 60 percent of the budget. You may want to discuss the sit-
uation with the lender, and you may have to bring in your own money until the
percentage is in line.
Sometimes you may disagree with an inspector about the percentage of com-
pletion on a particular item. For example, if you make a request for 50 percent
of your framing dollars and the inspector claims it’s 30 percent complete, you
may want to protest because the lender may only give you 30 percent of the
framing money. No one will go back out to the property to count the number of
studs put in place. The bank will trust the general assessment of their trusted
inspector. You can challenge the inspector’s opinion but probably won’t get too
far in your argument. Accept the fact that you can’t do much about it now, but
know that when the project is 100 percent complete, you can get 100 percent of
the cash devoted to that particular line item.
Having additional savings or the ability to borrow extra money can save 
time and headaches at times where the bank won’t release all the money you
need — and maybe even help you sleep a little bit better at night (and, as 
you discover while building your own custom home, you need all the sleep
you can get!).
All construction loans have a contingency — a pool of money set aside in the
budget for when costs go over what you expected. You can draw money from
this cushion by request, but usually only in an amount in line with the cur-
rent percentage of completion on the project. (We discuss the bank’s
approach to contingency in Chapter 8.)
Paying the subs
Paying subs fast and on a regular weekly basis has its advantages. This regu-
lar paycheck allows (and encourages) them to work harder, and sometimes it
194
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

gets you a better price to boot. But remember: The contractor and subs don’t
have an agreement with the bank — they have an agreement with you. In
their eyes, where the money comes from is your problem. Having access to
cash through savings, credit lines, or family can keep you from sleepless
nights or, worse, robbing banks when bank and contractor disputes seem
hopeless. In our combined experience of working with thousands of custom
home projects, the only projects that fall apart completely do so because
they run out of cold, hard cash. For more reasons and methods of acquiring
cash for your project, check out Chapter 7.
Dealing with deposits
Most construction lenders understand the need for advance deposits on
materials and are willing to accommodate your needs. Many items, such as
appliances, windows, doors, cabinets, and fixtures, require deposits months
in advance of delivery, and deposits can sometimes add up to as much as 50
percent of the line item stated in your cost breakdown. Most of the time, your
lender will insist on paying you for these deposits as a reimbursement for
money that you have already spent — so you have to show them vendor
receipts or cancelled checks as proof of payment. Depending on the lender,
the overall percentage of funds disbursed when making draw requests may
or may not include deposits. If your lender doesn’t cover the deposits, it
reimburses you upon installation of those items.
Using the draw system to pay for 
your log or kit home deposits
Log and other kit homes generally require large upfront deposits of up to 50
percent before the manufacturers begin to put the materials together for
your home. Because the kit home manufacturer is supplying all the materials
for the home, this expense can add up to a significant portion of your hard-
cost budget. In addition, most manufacturers prefer to receive the rest of
their money before, if not right at the time of delivery. Many construction
lenders using the draw system have agreed to accommodate the needs of
these manufacturers and wire deposits to these manufacturers in advance. In
addition, the lender generally sends another wire to the manufacturer when
the shipment is en route or when it receives confirmation of its delivery at
the building site.
If you’re building a log, manufactured, or kit home, we advise that you dis-
cuss this issue with potential lenders. Unless you have the available cash to
advance to the manufacturer yourself, you may need to pick a lender that
meets your manufacturer’s needs.
195
Chapter 10: Show Me the Money

Acing your finals — Final completion 
and final funds
Most banks retain 5 to 10 percent of hard costs in the LIP account until you
complete the project. To get this money and complete your loan, you gener-
ally need to provide the following items:
 Certificate of occupancy and recorded notice of completion in applica-
ble states (from the county or city inspector — see Chapter 15)
 Evidence of current homeowners’ insurance (from your insurance agent)
 Final draw request (you and the contractor fill this out)
 Final progress inspection (from the bank inspector)
 Unconditional lien waiver and affidavit from your contractor (or from
you, if you’re serving as owner-builder) stating that you (or the 
contractor) have paid all material providers and subs in full
 Verification of no liens on property (from the title company)
If you have difficulty providing this information, then your construction loan
can’t be paid off or rolled to a permanent loan until you resolve the issues.
You may face some penalties, and interest continues to accrue until you
resolve the issues and pay off or roll the loan. We need to emphasize this
point: You always need to try to resolve contractor and subcontractor dis-
putes — especially minor ones — as soon as possible. If you have monetary
disputes (most often major ones) that can’t be resolved quickly, then put
them aside and deal with them after you’ve finished the construction loan if
you can. You can find information on contractor remedies in Chapter 11, and
we discuss how to deal with projects in trouble in Chapter 20.
Figuring Out Who Gets the Money —
You or the Contractor
Banks have different approaches for deciding who they pay their money to.
Often, they leave the decision up to the folks running the project — you and
your contractor. Ultimately, all the money that comes from the bank must
either go to its proper place (vendors or subs) or directly to you or the con-
tractor to reimburse you for cash that you’ve paid out yourself. Creating a
system of payment — and including checks and balances — can help you
keep your project healthy and happy (and that’s the best kind of project to
have!).
196
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 

Suppliers generally want you to pay them immediately — or at least within 30
days — and they may require large deposits for certain items. And because
subs often pay their laborers in cash, they may want you to pay them on a
weekly basis. You and your contractor need to discuss each of the supplier’s
and sub’s needs in detail to figure out how to handle the money flow. Make
this discussion a part of your regularly scheduled meetings. You can find
more information on managing money and having regularly scheduled meet-
ings with your contractor in Chapter 11.
The bank may decide to control the funds. If the bank takes this approach, it
most likely uses the voucher system discussed in the section “Understanding
How the Voucher System Works,” earlier in this chapter. More often than not,
the bank simply asks you to designate a bank account to which you want the
bank to wire the funds. In this case, you’re the caretaker of the bank’s money.
You’re paying interest on it and, if you mishandle it, you can lose your entire
project (not a good thing!). You need to carefully consider how to control the
funds properly. (For tips on keeping your project organized, see Chapter 2.)
Usually in a draw system, you get the choice of where the money goes. If the
bank has left the decision of who gets the money up to you, you have three
choices:
 The money goes directly to the contractor’s bank account. If your con-
tractor is carrying the entire financial burden, then she may request that
the funds go directly into her bank account. In this situation, you need
to make sure that the contractor has completed all the work and paid all
the bills before you request the funds from the bank. This method gives
you the least amount of financial control over your project, and we don’t
recommend it.
 The money goes to a joint account for you and the contractor. This
method is very common. It assures the contractor that money is waiting
in the account, ready to be spent on the project, but it doesn’t place full
control in any one person’s hands. You need to set up the joint account
with checks requiring two signatures (one from you and one from the
contractor) before you can cash them. You and your contractor need to
meet on a regular basis to discuss who gets paid, to make sure that the
work has been completed, and then to issue the checks. If you travel
extensively, or if the project is a second home in a remote area, you may
need to make special arrangements to insure money flows in a timely
manner.
 The money goes into your bank account. Obviously, this choice gives
you ultimate control. In this case, you must set up a separate bank
account specifically for the construction project. You’re responsible to
make sure that everyone has met his or her obligations on the project. 
If you make this choice, you need to be aware that the project’s flow
depends solely on your money-management skills. You need to have
available cash at all times to make sure that you pay suppliers and subs
regularly and keep them happy. You can then be comfortable knowing
that the bank’s funds come directly back to you.
197
Chapter 10: Show Me the Money

Make sure that you have considered the possibility of a contractor change in
the middle of the project. Although everyone hopes for smooth sailing, out-
side forces, including health, family, or quality of work, can cause a contrac-
tor to leave the job. You need to readdress whatever decisions you made
regarding funds control. Discuss this possibility with your contractor and
bank in advance so that you can make the necessary adjustments quickly 
and easily.
Using Credit Cards Responsibly 
Can Buy You a Trip to Europe
Regardless of whether you use the bank’s money or your own, you need to
manage cash flow accordingly when building a custom home. By using credit
cards to pay building expenses, you can preserve your cash during your pro-
ject. Yes, we know. Some people have nightmares thinking of racking up tens
of thousands of dollars in credit card debt, but you only need the money for a
short period of time.
Your credit cards can be valuable tools to use when making payments to subs
and suppliers while you’re waiting on your bank to release draws. Some of
the benefits include
 You don’t have to pay any interest on most credit cards until the
billing cycle has started. You usually have up to 30 interest-free days to
pay them back when your draws come from the bank.
 Credit cards provide easy monthly statements for accounting. These
statements itemize exactly who you paid and when you paid them.
198
Part II: All You Need Is Dough: Financing Your Custom Home 
Managing the books
Some people have difficulty dealing with large
numbers and complicated accounting systems.
A number of computer programs can help you
out with that problem. Many people find
Quicken useful. If figuring out a new program is
challenging for you, you may find Quicken For
Dummies by Stephen L. Nelson (Wiley) a useful
tutorial in setting up your project. The bank that
gives you the construction loan may have spe-
cial offers for checking accounts that tie into
online or software-based accounting programs.

 You can earn travel points. Some people charge large amounts on their
airline credit cards so that they can get the added bonus of accumulat-
ing frequent-flier miles. For example, American Express has point pro-
grams that you can use for travel or merchandise.
Unfortunately, not all your subs and suppliers accept credit cards, but
you may be able to charge cash advances and still get some point bene-
fits. Check with your existing card issuers to see what options may be
available. Who knows, you may spend $200,000 in materials and rack up
200,000 travel points. These points give you enough for a much-deserved
free vacation when you finish your house (and, after building your own
custom home, you may just need that vacation!).
Although you may find credit cards useful after you’ve started the build, you
need to wait until after the bank approves your loan before you open any new
lines of credit or request credit increases to your existing cards. Every time
someone looks at your credit, it generates an inquiry in your credit report.
Too many inquiries in a short period of time can lower your credit score,
which the bank uses in qualifying you for the loan. If you’re financing your
build, be sure to check with your loan officer before adding any additional
credit.

B
uilding a custom home requires many people working together in a
coordinated manner to accomplish a series of jobs in an orderly fash-
ion. Working with a construction crew demands communication and
patience. In this chapter, we explain how to keep good communications with
your contractor, subcontractors, and suppliers. We give you the skinny on
contracts and discuss how to resolve disputes. We also give you the inside
scoop on working with inspectors. Finally, we point out the risks and reme-
dies with mechanic’s liens.
Working with Your Contractor
A large part of success in working with your contractor is picking the right
one. Just because a contractor offers a good price and builds good homes
doesn’t mean she is right for your project. In Chapter 2 we provide plenty of
good information on selecting the right contractor for your project and also
understanding the contractor’s role.
To keep everything working effectively with your contractor, you need to be
proactive. Make sure you’re clear and decisive about what you want and
more importantly what you don’t want. Ambiguity can cause mistakes and
delays. If you aren’t sure of what you’re saying, then ask more questions or
do some research. Your contractor will also appreciate clarity in your conver-
sations. The last thing she wants is to fix a misunderstanding.

Impatience is your enemy. A custom home project is organic in nature and
doesn’t move in a precise fashion. For example, you may think the framing
should be finished in three weeks, but a number of delays, such as the weather,
scheduling errors, or manpower shortages, can make it take four weeks. Relax.
Take a deep breath. The project will develop its own rhythm and eventually it
will be completed. Although you do need to be working to keep your house on
schedule, you don’t want to be constantly rushing everything. Contractors and
subs are human and will work poorly in a high-pressure environment. Settle in
for the long haul and have faith in the professionals you hired.
Fostering good communication — A 
meeting a day keeps the anger away
Hands down, the surest way to keep a custom home project progressing is
with steady, effective communication. Err on the side of more communication
rather than less. Everyday something new is happening on your project, so
the easiest way to keep everyone informed is to have a meeting before the
work starts.
We realize that everyone thinks meetings are boring and having one every day
sounds like a huge waste of time. It doesn’t have to be. Think of a meeting as
two-way communication that can happen by phone, e-mail, or in person and
that only lasts a few minutes. This daily update needs to address the following
five basic issues:
 What is happening on the project today?
 Are we on schedule?
 Are we on budget?
 What problems or issues, if any, are occurring on the project?
 What, if anything, do you (the contractor) need from me (the owner)?
If everything is running smoothly, you and your contractor can proceed
assured. If you and your contractor notice certain issues, you can be confident
in having a time everyday to discuss and resolve them. Having this regular
meeting time saves panic calls and work stoppage while you’re busy earning
money. If you and the contractor both e-mail, you can swap the answers to the
questions the night before and agree to talk only if there are any problems.
For good communication, both sides have to be proactive. Be clear and
honest on all your issues. Remember that fear goes both ways. If you’re dis-
satisfied or confused, bring it up. How does your contractor know that some-
thing on your end is a problem unless you speak up about it? Believe us, she
doesn’t!
204
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Maintaining a productive 
work environment
Before you’re ready to start work on your new home, you and your contractor
need to have a preconstruction meeting to set reasonable expectations on
both sides for a productive work environment. This meeting is your chance —
and the contractor’s — to remove miscommunication before it happens. It
also lets everybody know what the hot spots are that can cause problems
later. Use this list to figure out what you need to discuss and agree upon:
 What are acceptable communication times?
 What is reasonable contact during work hours?
 How often will we address the accounting?
 Will the property be fenced off and locked?
 What is a reasonable level of cleanliness on the site?
 Will smoking be allowed on the site?
 What potential noise restrictions may be an issue?
 What will be the working hours on the site?
 Will workers be restricted from removing shirts?
 What bathroom accommodations will be set up for the workers?
 Will workers be aware of using foul language?
These issues commonly impact the working environment of a construction
job site. Make sure you address them with your contractor.
Before you and your contractor set agreements on these issues, talk to the
neighbors and solicit their input and approval because they’ll be impacted by
some of the decisions even more than you. Also check to see if any local gov-
ernment restrictions apply. Taking these proactive steps can help you
develop better relationships with your neighbors and make for a much more
pleasant move-in process.
Change orders — Dealing with indecision
If one phrase causes a contractor to wake up screaming in the middle of 
the night, it’s the dreaded change order. A change order is needed when you
decide to do something different than you agreed upon in the plans or con-
tract. You’re entitled to make any changes you want. After all, you’re going 
to live in this home. However, change orders can create problems and delays
not to mention added costs.
205
Chapter 11: All the King’s Men: The Contractor and His Cohorts

Try to keep change orders to a minimum if at all possible. Doing so can be dif-
ficult because your house will look different as you build it. For example, a
room may seem too small or a window may need to be farther over to catch
the sun. Minor change orders, such as moving a small wall or adding a door,
may not cause too much trouble, but major change orders, such as adding a
room or changing a structural wall, could send you back to the planning
department and cause weeks of delays.
Plan ahead and use a change order as a last resort. If you do need to make a
change, tackle it early and immediately. Indecision and constant change can
disturb any project’s rhythm. A long delay can upset every sub’s schedule.
Furthermore, the contractor usually isn’t willing to absorb the costs involved
in change orders and may even charge a premium as spelled out in the con-
tract. Don’t let the pace of the project lose any momentum if possible in
order to keep extra costs to a minimum.
Keeping a happy and healthy relationship
with your contractor
The partnership between you and your contractor will be the key to the suc-
cess or failure of your custom home project. You’ll probably share more
issues, problems, and emotions in one year than most couples deal with in a
lifetime. Utilize these five keys to maintain an excellent working relationship
with your contractor:
 Do your homework first, and then trust the contractor to do his job.
 Detail every decision and ask every question before you start. Imagine
you’re going out of town for the entire project and the contractor could
only work from written instructions.
 Let the contractor know your fears before you start so he can address
them.
 Ask that the contractor not start the project until he can commit to
working continuously through to the end.
 Think of your contractor as being on your side, and he most likely will
act like it.
Managing Your Time and Money
Any business-related project boils down to managing time and money. A
custom home project is no exception. Your project isn’t a charity project.
Your contractor, subs, and suppliers build homes for a living. They want to
make their money and do it in as little time as is reasonably possible. They
206
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

want everything handled in an efficient professional manner — they work
best when they don’t have to chase their money, and everything happens
according to expectations and agreements.
Of course, living up to commitments goes both ways. Check in regularly 
with your contractor to make sure the project is running consistently with
the budget. If the project is running over budget, go over the details of the
expenses so far to determine that the contractor is living up to his obliga-
tions. If you have a problem, you can refer to the “Managing Disputes” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.
Executing contracts
Whether you hire a contractor or act as your own, you’ll have to execute con-
tracts with the people working on your custom home. If you hire a contractor,
he will have contracts with the subs, so you’ll only have to negotiate with
him. (See Chapter 2 for more about your contractor’s specific roles.)
Contracts between you and the contractor spell out everything in writing
with a bunch of legal gobbledygook in case a dispute occurs. If all goes well,
you’ll put the contract between you and the contractor in your file after sign-
ing and never look at it again. If not, it’s a useful tool to remind both you and
your contractor exactly what you agreed upon. A good contract is the basis
for good communication. You can start with a copy of the contractor’s stan-
dard contract or a contract he used with a previous client if he doesn’t use a
standard contract.
Contracts are legally binding documents; you need to read and understand
them thoroughly before signing anything. Make sure you understand the pro-
ject’s price, payment plans, and your obligations. Have everything in place on
your end to make good on your side of the deal. Doing so can be difficult if,
for example, your construction loan isn’t approved. One solution for this
issue is to make the contract contingent upon financing.
Do your best to negotiate win-win situations on each point and make sure
you have your attorney review the contract before signing on the dotted line.
The contract is always subject to change provided you and your contractor
both agree to make the changes and initial them. A good contract includes
the following list of required items:
 Names, addresses, and phone numbers of all parties named in the 
contract
 The contractor’s license and type
 Tax ID or Social Security number
 Workers’ compensation insurance number
207
Chapter 11: All the King’s Men: The Contractor and His Cohorts

 Job address
 Job specs
 Price and terms
 Time frame
 Responsibility for delays
 Terms of warranties
 Terms for conflict resolution or arbitration
 Signatures and dates
One question Kevin is asked all the time is whether to choose a fixed-price
contract or a time-and-materials contract.
Fixed-price contracts
A fixed-price contract means you agree on a single price for the project, and
the contractor makes his profit on the difference between that price and the
total of labor and materials. Many lenders require fixed-price contracts
because these contracts protect them from cost overruns. Some contractors
believe, however, that fixed-price contracts create an adversarial relationship
between the consumer and the contractor. The contractor has to look to cut
costs in order to make more money, which may take its toll in quality on your
house if costs are running higher than expected. You can add language that
allows for renegotiation should cost increases exceed a certain percentage.
Time-and-materials contracts
With a time-and-materials contract, the contractor bills you at her cost for the
labor and supplies and then makes a percentage profit based upon the costs.
This type of contract solves the problem of the contractor looking to skimp
in order to make more money; however, some conflict may still arise because
the contractor can make more money by making you spend more.
Kevin recommends creating a variation that offers additional incentives for
bringing the house under budget and on time. Doing so can give you the best
of both worlds, but your lender needs to agree to this type of contract.
Check your local laws regarding deposits. Often contractors ask for a security
deposit with the contract. Asking for a deposit is legal but some states don’t
allow large deposits to contractors. If the contractor is asking for more than
10 percent, check the limits with the state contracting licensing board. Be
aware that any money you put on deposit is at risk of being lost until the pro-
ject actually starts.
208
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Scheduling the project
Your contractor creates a schedule for the project based on the following
four elements:
 The plans’ requirements
 Subcontractors’ availability
 Supply availability
 Weather
Your contractor does his best to keep to the planned schedule, but unex-
pected changes in any of these four areas can throw everything off kilter. At
that point he adjusts and makes up time wherever possible without sacrific-
ing the quality of the house. Both of you want to keep the project moving
everyday. Both you and your workers will stay happier if you see some
progress at the end of each day. Stagnation can break emotional momentum
and create a dismal working environment.
Controlling the funds — How 
to manage the checkbook
Whether you finance the property as we discuss in Chapter 8 or decide to
build using all your own cash, you’ll need to establish a method of getting
everyone paid. If you’re paying for the project out of your own pocket, you
can just write the checks yourself every day or fund the contractor in stages.
If you’re getting a loan, you have to designate who gets the money, or the
lender may designate for you. You have three basic options, which we touch
upon here and cover in greater depth in Chapter 10:
 You control the funds. You have total control of the money, but you
must sign every check and make sure people get paid when they need
their money, which can be inconvenient.
 The contractor controls the funds. This method is much more conve-
nient, but the contractor now has full responsibility for your money,
which could be risky.
 You both control the funds. A joint checking account gives both of you
access and control. You can set up the account where both you and the
contractor have to sign checks on big-money items. Using a joint account
enables you to watch the larger expenses while giving the contractor
funds for day-to-day expenses.
209
Chapter 11: All the King’s Men: The Contractor and His Cohorts

Either way, your best bet for running the project smoothly is to have funds
readily available as we discuss in Chapter 7. The lender-disbursement sys-
tems explained in Chapter 10 may not be consistent with the needs of the
contractor and subs, so extra funds act as a cushion from bank bureaucracy.
You want to make sure everyone on the project is happy and not begging to
be paid. Some subs may ask for advances for materials or to secure their
time. Try not to pay any more in advance than you have to, but don’t leave
them hanging either.
Many subs and suppliers offer you better deals if you actually pay cash rather
than writing a check or charging your credit card. Cash is better for them if
they want to avoid taxes by not reporting the income. Because income report-
ing is their responsibility, you need to decide on your own conscience and
moral view of this issue. Using cash to pay isn’t illegal, and it can save you
money (from credit card interest), but handling large amounts of cash can be
difficult and can make you feel a little dirty if you suspect that the people you
are paying are cheating on their taxes. Remember that canceled checks and
credit card statements serve a useful purpose besides their ease of use: They
are your receipt that someone actually got paid. The fact that cash is undocu-
mented can work against you as well.
Introducing Other Important Players
Aside from your contractor, you work with many other people on the project.
Your contractor has the primary communication with subs, suppliers, and
inspectors, but you’ll be involved in many of the conversations. If you decide
to be an owner-builder, you’ll have to manage all the communication. (We
explain the advantages and disadvantages of being an owner-builder in
Chapter 1.)
Dealing with suppliers
Suppliers can range from a Home Depot store, a specialty materials store that
caters to builders, and even individual artisans that make fixtures for homes.
Each one has its own terms for deposits, payments, and delivery. If you’re
working with a contractor, he’ll probably arrange for most of the basic mate-
rials from a supplier with whom he has an established business relationship.
(See Chapter 2 for the specifics on a contractor’s role.) Owner-builders need
to find their own suppliers — local lumberyards and the Internet are a great
place to start.
Even though your contractor provides the suppliers, you can still look to 
buy fixtures and items. You may find unique items or save money if you 
have some connections. The Internet is a great place to shop, and stores like
Lowe’s or Home Depot Expo can be great resources to buy exactly what you
210
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

like. If you buy items, then don’t make anything more difficult for your con-
tractor. To make your contractor’s job a little less hectic:
 Communicate as soon as possible to make sure she hasn’t already
ordered the item.
 Make sure the item is practical for the project. For example, older elec-
trical and plumbing fixtures may require some adaptation for modern
usage.
 Make the item easily available to the contractor by having it delivered to
the site.
 Ensure the finances have been reconciled with the budget and contract.
Suppliers often need deposits to hold materials and for large items ordered 
in advance. Make sure you have plenty of cash available for deposits and to
keep the suppliers happy. See Chapter 7 for more about managing your cash
flow on the project.
Working with subs — 
Each one is an expert
Subcontractors are contractors too. They may not have all the credentials 
of a general contractor, but they’re experts in their specialized fields. They’re
referred to as subcontractors or subs on your site because they work for the
general contractor. Which subs your contractor hires depends on your project.
The following is a list of subs probably necessary for your project in the
approximate order they will work on your project:
 Grading sub or excavator
 Foundation sub
 Concrete sub
 Framing sub
 Plumbing sub
 Electrical sub
 Mechanical/HVAC sub
 Roofing sub
 Drywall sub
 Painting sub
211
Chapter 11: All the King’s Men: The Contractor and His Cohorts

Your project may require other specialty subs. Subs may also handle items,
such as tile, masonry, millwork, stucco, insulation, sewer/septic, and carpen-
try. Most of these subs have licensing in their specific area. Ask your contrac-
tor to verify their licensing before they start work on the project.
Your contractor performs most of the communication with the subs, espe-
cially in the early structural phases of the build discussed in Chapters 12 and
13. Make yourself available to walk through the property with the primary
subs with whom you may have some input, such as:
 The plumbing sub
 The electrical sub
 The HVAC sub
 The roofing sub
By walking through with the subs before and after their work, you can make
sure you clearly communicate about everything important to you, such as
the locations of vents, fixtures, and switches. The finish work (see Chapter
14) requires many more individual walk-throughs and meetings to be assured
that everything is kosher.
Subs are craftspeople first and businesspeople second. Many of them are less
concerned about their social skills than their work quality. You want quality
to be their priority — but the craftsmanlike manner of subs can also make for
difficult communication. You need good communication and rapport during
the process, especially for the finish work. Do your part to create a warm
friendly environment. Say hello to the subs when you’re on-site. Stop by with
a cooler of soft drinks on a hot day. A little good can go a long way in building
a good rapport with the workers. Use your contractor to manage most of the
work-specific communication — let him be the bad guy when necessary.
That’s what you’re paying him for.
Preparing for building and bank inspectors
Two kinds of inspectors check in to see how your project is going:
 The bank inspector determines how far along the project is so you can
be reimbursed for the work that’s been completed. These inspections
occur at specified times based upon the draw schedule discussed in
Chapter 10.
 The building inspector visits to make sure that the project is being built
to meet the local codes and according to the approved plans. These
inspections occur based upon local government requirements estab-
lished by the local building department.
212
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

These two inspectors aren’t interchangeable and have no interest in looking
at anything beyond their scope. Contrary to popular belief, the inspectors
are absolutely on your side. They both want the house to be completed in a
reasonable time frame and in a workmanlike manner.
In order to help the inspection process go as smoothly as possible, you and
your contractor need to use these few tips:
 Call the inspector a few days in advance so you don’t have to stop the
project and wait.
 Keep the site clean and organized so the inspector feels good about
what he sees.
 Make it easy for the inspector to see what he needs to see so he doesn’t
have to spend time digging and become frustrated. For example, don’t
stack the appliances in such a way that they hide the inspection areas.
 Keep disputes calm. Find out how to fix the problems and only pick bat-
tles you’re sure you can win.
A good relationship with inspectors can keep the project moving and running
smoothly. Keep everything cordial by smiling and saying “thank you” a lot. If
you have a problem, take a step back and communicate with your contractor
about how to get everything back on track. Ultimately, you may be right in an
inspection dispute, but inspectors have the power to shut everything down.
Find a way to see their point of view and go with it.
Managing Disputes
Because you have so much at stake in your custom home project, emotions
can run high. You can quickly resolve most disputes after tempers have set-
tled down. Usually everyone on the project has the same objective of getting
the house complete —your satisfaction with the final product. Most prob-
lems relate to your dissatisfaction with the work quality or a cost issue.
Remember that in a dispute situation you’re ultimately responsible for the
outcome. Even though the bank has a financial interest, it will take the path
of least resistance — which may not be in your interest. Never will the lender
act as your advocate. When something goes sour, you can be assured that
the parties will be looking out for their own best interests.
Avoiding mechanic’s liens — 
The contractor’s weapons
A mechanic’s lien is a debt instrument that attaches to your property and
guarantees the contractor will get paid before anyone else does when the
213
Chapter 11: All the King’s Men: The Contractor and His Cohorts

house is sold. A mechanic’s lien takes precedence over all other liens, includ-
ing your mortgage, which makes it a very powerful tool. A contractor can file
a mechanic’s lien anytime up to 90 days after the house is finished regardless
of when the work was actually done.
Because of the power of mechanic’s liens, lenders and title companies charge
you extra money and make you sign indemnifications to protect their interest
and put the weight of responsibility back on you. If a mechanic’s lien is filed
against your property, you’ll have difficulty getting money from your con-
struction loan, and you can’t roll the mortgage into permanent financing.
Because you bear the burden when a mechanic’s lien is filed, you need to
avoid them at all costs. You’re better off paying a contractor and suing him
after the fact rather than withholding payment over disputed work. You may
think you have leverage, but the penalties for a loan that never rolls to per-
manent financing, as discussed in Chapter 10, can far exceed the original 
contract amount in dispute.
To protect yourself against mechanic’s liens, use the following tips:
 You can require the contractor to supply a performance bond. This
bond completes the project and/or pays damages up to the bond
amount. This money can pay off any outstanding payments due. These
bonds can cost 1 to 5 percent of the construction contract and need to
be recorded with the county.
 You can use a joint fund control. Local services that manage the books
and take responsibility for paying all subs and suppliers are available for
a fee. These services can provide lien waivers and other protections.
 You can pay with joint checks. Joint checks have both your name and
the contractor’s. Using joint checks helps to document to suppliers and
subs that you have met your obligations. Regardless of whether or not
you adopt any of these methods of protections, you absolutely need to
collect Waiver and Release forms. Have every sub and supplier sign
these forms at the time you pay them, and make sure your contractor
collects them as well. You need these forms for your lender at the end 
as well. You can get these forms at a stationery store.
Using legal remedies — Arbitration 
and attorneys
Your contract needs to spell out the details of how to resolve major conflicts.
If you and your contractor can’t reach an agreement, then you may have to
resort to legal means or at the very least binding arbitration.
214
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Arbitration is an alternative to the courts that can save time and money.
Instead of hiring attorneys, the two parties present their case to an indepen-
dent arbitrator who examines the situation and works to find an agreeable
solution. If no solution is agreed upon, then the arbitrator creates one based
on the information reviewed. This process can take less than one-third the
time and cost one-fifth the amount of a court case. Many contracts specify
the American Arbitration Association (www.adr.org). Both parties agree 
that they’ll use arbitration in lieu of legal action.
If arbitration isn’t specified, then the last resort may be to engage an attor-
ney. You must assume that if your project has gotten to this stage, then you
are prepared to spend tens of thousands of dollars and possibly years of time
before a resolution happens.
Consider these four bits of information before you engage in a lawsuit:
 Do your best to confirm that the party you are suing has the means to
pay a judgment or at least has insurance.
 Be sure you truly have legal ground to stand on and you aren’t acting on
an emotional basis.
 Be sure you can absorb the costs associated with a trial and any delays
to your project even if you lose.
 Be sure you have the emotional strength to deal with attorneys and per-
sonal attacks.
If you’re unsure in any of these instances, you may want to head back to the
bargaining table.
Not all attorneys are well versed in construction law. Kevin has seen fee-hungry
general practitioners cost their clients tons of money in cases that never
should have been filed. Many attorneys believe they’re right even when they’re
wrong. Make sure your attorney is an expert in the field and can keep the emo-
tions out of it. Stick to the facts and be ready to admit you’re wrong if you are.
215
Chapter 11: All the King’s Men: The Contractor and His Cohorts
Pre-liens, nothing to be afraid of
Part of the process of filing mechanic’s liens
requires that subs and suppliers must send you
a notice that work was done or materials were
provided to the project. These pre-lien notices
insure that you’re aware of moneys owed to
people that you haven’t seen working on the
project, such as subs hired by the contractor for
one day’s work. Don’t panic when you receive
this notice. A mechanic’s lien itself only occurs
when it’s filed with the county recorder. Keep
these documents and obtain lien releases from
each of the suppliers and subs when the project
is finished and they have been paid in full.

T
he design is finished, and you’ve paid for all the permits. (If you haven’t
paid for your permits or have any questions about the permit process,
check out Chapter 6.) You’ve also picked a contractor, and you’re ready to
get to work. This chapter provides you with a basic understanding of the first
phase of the actual construction process — excavation and foundation.
As you progress through this phase, you and your contractor need to meet
regularly to keep track of the progress and the schedule for all the subcon-
tractors to complete their work in perfect synchronicity (see Chapter 11 for
more on working with your contractor and subs).
The first steps in the construction phase aren’t for do-it-yourselfers because
they require heavy equipment and complex engineering that few people are
skilled in. More than a few custom homes have gotten into trouble when their
happy owners underestimated the complexity of these first steps, particu-
larly building a foundation. Our goal in this chapter is to be sure you under-
stand just how important this part of the project is — your home literally
depends on a firm, well-built foundation for its survival — and your role in
ensuring that you get the best foundation possible.
For us to give you every detail of construction in this chapter would be
impossible, so instead we focus on the important stuff — the vital informa-
tion you need in order to have meaningful discussions with your contractor
and subs. Most of you depend on your contractor for the tasks in this chap-
ter, so we include spot-checks you can use to make sure everything runs
smoothly. You probably won’t have time to check every detail, but these lists
can alert you to a problem or give you the confidence to move forward.

Surveying and Site Preparation
In order to start, you need to know where everything goes and have a clean
site to work with. In this section we discuss how everything finds its rightful
place and how to make the ground ready for your home’s foundation.
Using your survey
Before you dig in, so to speak, make sure you’re digging in the right place
(don’t laugh, digging in the wrong place happens more often than you think).
It’s time for a survey. No, not the kind they do on TV’s Family Feud; this
survey requires a specially trained professional (a surveyor) to use surveying
equipment to mark the following:
 Lot lines: These are the property boundaries.
 Setbacks: These tell you where your building limits are relative to your
neighbor’s property.
 Underground utility lines: If your property has any power lines and
water pipes buried on it, identifying their location can keep you from hit-
ting them.
When your surveyor completes the job, she places a numbered tag on a per-
manent stake on the property. This tag has the surveyor’s registered license
number and serves as a reference point for all future surveys. Often the
survey is completed early in the design process, particularly if you’re dealing
with a large rural lot where the boundaries aren’t clearly marked or if they’re
required by the building department. You, your contractor, or your architect
can hire the surveyor, depending on when in the process she is needed. The
cost varies widely by region and the size of the lot.
Designating the lot lines
First, your surveyor comes out to your building site and marks the lot’s bor-
ders. In fact, the surveyor’s most important job is to carefully mark out each
border.
Your surveyor identifies the lot lines by using a tool called a transit, which
looks like a telescope (no, you can’t use it to see Saturn’s rings at night). She
finds permanent tags or markings previously installed by the government
that correspond to the plat map (the official, recorded map that shows prop-
erty boundaries and measurements) provided by the county. You’ll receive a
copy of the plat map from the title company; you can also easily obtain it
from the county because it’s public record.
Then, using the site map, the surveyor and contractor preliminarily mark out
all the important areas (the corners of the house and garage, the pathways
218
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

for utilities to be brought into your home, the edges of the driveway and
walkways, and so on) with stakes, spray paint, and ribbons. Marking them
now makes it easier to put in the more permanent markings discussed later
in this chapter in the section “Marking the build site.”
Looking at setbacks
Most cities and counties call for some separation between houses, called a
setback, of some distance in feet, which your architect will have included in
your plans in order to get them approved. We discuss setbacks in more detail
in Chapter 5.
If you’re building on a large lot, you probably won’t be encroaching on these
setback limits, unless your home is built close to the property line. On a
small lot, however, you have a much greater chance that you could encroach
on a setback, leading you directly to a major headache. Why? Because, if
indeed you have encroached on a setback, your friendly, local building
inspector could force you to remove the work you have already done and
start again. And if you’re well on your way in the construction process,
having to start over again could cost you significant amounts of both time
and money!
Keeping your ear to the ground for utility lines
Have your surveyor and contractor not only mark the underground utility
lines but also flag them in case the paint markings are lost due to excavation
and erosion. Make sure the utilities remain marked during the entire earth-
moving project. For obvious reasons, your neighbors-to-be probably wouldn’t
appreciate it if their power, phone, gas, or water service were accidentally
cut off for a day or two when one of your subs ran a backhoe through a
buried utility line.
Before any earthwork begins, have your contractor call your regional organi-
zation designed to protect accidental damage to underground utilities. Each
area has a phone number to call as a free service. (You can call 800-258-0808,
or you can access your local number by logging on to www.electricsmarts.
com/content/callbeforeyoudig.asp. The Web site also has a color chart
for marking locations.) Most utilities cooperate with this service in order to
protect accidents form happening. Often the utility company comes out and
marks in colored chalk where the utility lines exist. Taking this step saves the
utility company money and can save lives as well.
If you don’t call and you hit a line during the course of construction, the
penalty fines can be as much as $100,000 plus damages. Do you have that
much spare change just lying around? (For more on hooking up the utilities,
check out “Preparing for the Utilities” section, later in this chapter.) Finally,
you or your contractor need to call the utility companies to relocate their
services if they need to be moved to accommodate driveways, decks, and
landscaping, because these items could block future access.

Chapter 12: Excavation and Foundation: Getting a Solid Start

Preparing your site before 
the first shovelful
You’re probably anxious to break ground, but not so fast. You want to make
sure everything is ready, and you need to take several steps before anyone
digs out the first shovelful of dirt. You and your contractor need to discuss the
benefits and costs for the following suggestions before you implement them:
 Post prominent “Danger” signs (in red) throughout the building site.
Doing so can help protect your liability in case someone unauthorized
might trespass on the property.
 Arrange for a rental toilet for your workers. Everyone has to go some-
time and, more importantly, somewhere. Believe us: The alternative isn’t
very appealing.
 Decide whether or not to install an onsite storage shack for materials.
Not only can you keep your materials and valuables dry in an onsite
storage unit, but you can also lock up any valuables for security pur-
poses. Installing a storage shack is a good idea in a moist climate, but
probably not necessary in places where rain or snow is infrequent. The
storage shack doesn’t need to be fancy. In fact, an aluminum shack from
a hardware store may work just fine. If your project is a big one, how-
ever, consider renting an industrial shipping container. For just a few
bucks a day, you can have a watertight storage facility delivered to your
site at the beginning of your project and then picked up at the end.
 Consider adding an administrative office for your contractor. You may
consider putting a trailer or motor home on the lot, particularly if you
plan to spend a lot of overnights on the property as construction pro-
gresses. Adding an office can also be a very convenient place to store
paperwork, tools, and refreshments as well as to provide comfort and
first aid for workers when necessary. You can then post the building
permit on the trailer or motor home’s door (if you don’t have an office,
then you can simply post the permit to a post on your property or on
your new home’s framing or sheathing when it is far enough along).
 Discuss with your contractor about putting up a lockable chain-link
fence. The fence can keep out kids and other intruders after hours.
Installing a fence not only protects your site from theft and vandalism,
but also prevents someone from coming onto the site and getting hurt.
Be sure to look into renting the fencing instead of buying it.
Dealing with trees
Your site plan will detail which trees to save and which trees to remove. You
make these decisions during the planning process, which we discuss in
Chapter 5. Removing large trees requires a subcontractor with a bulldozer or
220
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

tractor. The sub first cuts down the trees, leaving roughly 4 feet of trunk
exposed, which is enough trunk to connect a chain for the tractor to pull out
the entire stump. Don’t leave stumps in the ground because they’ll rot and
attract unwanted pests as well as leave unsightly (and possibly dangerous)
sinkholes in their wake.
The wood from the trees and stumps cut on your property is yours to keep,
so talk to your contractor about putting it in a corner of the lot where you
can cut it into firewood later or ask your contractor if he can have a laborer
cut it up (the tree cutters will charge you dearly if you ask them to split the
wood). If you don’t have the room to store all that wood, consider selling or
giving some to your neighbors.
Do you have some trees that you want to protect? If so, you have several dif-
ferent options:
 Have your contractor place hay bales around the trees to protect them
from tractors and heavy equipment (and to be sure no one accidentally
cuts one or more down). Later, you can use the hay to cover mud and to
dry out puddles.
 Surround the trunks with bright orange plastic fencing from your hard-
ware store. Doing so can protect the tree somewhat from flying objects
and make it visible so heavy equipment and truck drivers will avoid hit-
ting them. Make sure the fencing is tall so it protects the bark from being
knocked off the tree, helping to protect the tree from the elements and
pests.
 Tie red tape or ribbon to the trees. The bright color alerts workers from
hitting the trees or accidentally cutting them down.
Clearing and grading
Depending on where you decide to build, your lot may also need to be
cleared of brush and shrubs. Your contractor can arrange for the clearing.
This removal can usually be done with a bulldozer at a reasonably low cost.
After the lot has been cleared, grading can take place. Grading is scraping the
land to move dirt from one place on the lot to another. Your contractor
brings in a grading subcontractor to do the job. Tractors, bulldozers, and
other heavy equipment often grade the land, although small grading projects
are done by hand. The grading is completed in two stages:
 Rough grading redistributes dirt on a lot to create level ground at the
building site (which is important, if you want to have a level house!).
Any leftover topsoil may be pushed to a corner of the lot for later use in
landscaping.
 Finish grading contours the yard in a way that is both aesthetically
pleasing, and that moves water away from the house instead of toward
it. (We address finish grading more in-depth in Chapter 17.)
221
Chapter 12: Excavation and Foundation: Getting a Solid Start

When grading, make sure your contractor or sub extends the grading work at
least 3 feet beyond the expected perimeter of the house and garage.
If your lot is rocky or has boulders, your contractor may have to arrange for
blasting, a process that (at least in our minds) conjures up early morning car-
toon images of a crazy coyote and some dynamite. Actually, those images
aren’t far off. Blasting can be dangerous and expensive, but it may be neces-
sary to make the lot usable.
Constructing retaining walls
If your lot is on a slope or hill, it may require some serious grading to create a
flat building pad. A building pad is the flat ground where your foundation will
sit. Your engineer has calculated the best structure for the particular needs
of your slope. For example, one alternative includes building several retaining
walls in succession to create multiple flat pads for the house and yard, which
is called terracing. The ground will be terraced or cut flat into the hillside.
Furthermore, in severe situations, the contractor may build a retaining wall
to prevent the land (and your house along with it) from slipping. A general
rule: Your contractor or a sub can build any retaining wall 3-feet high dry, that
is, without using cement or mortar. Higher walls need to be built wet, using
cement or mortar. Your plans will specify the necessary structure for the
retaining wall. Another important rule to make sure your contractor knows: 
A retaining wall must extend 2 feet into the ground for every 1 foot of height
above the ground.
Depending on where you live and your contractor’s preferences, your retain-
ing walls may be made from different products, including the following:
 Cement blocks filled with reinforced steel and concrete: These are
common in the West where earthquakes are common.
 Large logs or railroad ties: The logs or ties have been chemically
treated (often with creosote, or other rot and insect repelling materials)
and bolted into place.
 Keystone or boulders: These are commonly used in the Midwest.
Your contractor and/or engineer can place your retaining walls
 Above the building pad to keep the slope from sliding down onto the
house
 Below the building pad to keep the house from sliding down the hill
Check out Figure 12-1 to see both examples.

Providing drainage
Drainage is a very important part of the build process. In fact, approximately
80 percent of foundation problems (leaks, cracks, uneven settling) in houses
can be later traced back to poor drainage. So, to avoid these kinds of prob-
lems (and to ensure your front yard doesn’t turn into one big puddle every
time it rains), your contractor needs to follow the engineer’s recommended
plan for proper drainage on the property. This plan is in the working draw-
ings, which we discuss in Chapter 6.
To create good drainage, parts of your property will be graded with a slight
slope (away from your home), encouraging water to run off the property.
If your house is going to have a basement, the contractor may need to install
a French drain system. A French drain is a series of trenches dug around the
house’s perimeter, designed to direct water away from the foundation. To
work properly, the trench must be located deeper than the desired depth of
the basement. After the trench is dug, a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe with

holes in the top — run at a slight, downhill angle — is placed at the bottom of
the trench and covered with gravel and then dirt. If desired, water from the
drains can be directed to a collecting area where an electric sump pump
moves the excess water to a surface drainage channel.
On some properties, PVC pipe, galvanized pipe, or corrugated plastic tile may
be installed to direct water from specific areas on the property and toward
other areas of the property away from the house. Most homes today are
designed with a closed system, where all the water runoff from the house is
channeled directly into these pipes and carried off the property.
Marking the build site
The next step is to clearly mark the building site. Using tape measures and
the survey, your contractor marks the exact points for the edge of the house
and garage. Depending on the type of foundation to be installed, your con-
tractor may mark the perimeter with wooden stakes and boards called batter
boards. The batter boards may only be a few feet long, but they’ll clearly
mark the corners as well as the height of the foundation to be installed. The
contractor then attaches string between the batter boards to represent the
sides of the foundation and ensure straight lines and square angles.
When the foundation area is clearly marked, then the contractor can start
lining up utility hookups and getting ready for excavation. Your contractor
will also need to stake out all the utility hookups before construction begins.
Spot-check — Surveying and 
site preparation
Everything is marked and cleared. Now is a good time to perform a spot-
check to make sure you’re ready for the next steps. No special tools are 
necessary here.
❑Lot corners and setbacks are clearly marked with flags or paint.
❑Separate areas for materials and trash are set away from the build site.
❑“Danger” signs are clearly marked.
❑Trees to be saved are protected and easily seen.
❑Retaining walls are secure and ground is packed.
❑Building site is clearly marked and batter boards are secure.
Discuss any issues or discrepancies with your contractor and determine
when and how to fix them.
224
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Preparing for the Utilities
You don’t really appreciate utilities — electricity, gas, telephone, cable televi-
sion, and sewer and water — until they’re gone. And, although some people
are generating their own energy (through solar, hydro, and wind power),
pumping their own water out of the ground, or having their utilities delivered
by truck (propane and fuel oil), most people rely on utilities that are pro-
vided by their local communities.
Some utilities come into your house underground (such as water and sewer)
and some overhead (such as electricity and cable television, except in com-
munities where these utilities are also underground for aesthetic reasons).
Whatever the case, your contractor marks where all these different connec-
tions are coming from and going to according to the plans. You and your 
contractor connect with all the appropriate parties so that you and your con-
struction crew can have the benefit of modern utilities during the building
process — and beyond.
Connecting water
Depending on where your lot is located, you’ll either connect to public water
or have to put in a well if no public water is readily available. Public water is
generally more cost effective and reliable, but rarely available in rural areas.
If you’re connecting to public water, your contractor will have laborers dig a
trench to the water supply, connecting to the main water pipe at the street.
Your contractor installs a temporary meter so the water company can mea-
sure your water usage during the construction process. If the main pipe has a
pressure of 80 pounds per square inch (PSI) or higher, you’ll later need to
install a regulator to reduce the pressure, avoiding excess wear and tear on
the pipes (or unscheduled bursts!) in your house.
If you’re installing a well, you or your contractor will arrange for a well com-
pany to install the well. The well company drills down into the water table
until it can find clean ground water. After the well company digs the hole, it
installs an electric pump to bring the water to the surface for home use.
You’ll also have a water storage tank so that your pump doesn’t have to run
every time someone flushes the toilet or takes a drink.
Regardless of whether you’re using well water or public water, because water
is generally used during construction, your contractor needs to install a tem-
porary spigot for almost immediate access.
225
Chapter 12: Excavation and Foundation: Getting a Solid Start

Hooking up to the sewer
If you’re connecting to a public sewer system, your contractor will have labor-
ers dig trenches to lay the drainpipes — generally made from cast iron or 
PVC — leading away from the house. These pipes need to be installed prior to
any concrete being laid, and your site plan will determine the most effective
route (see Chapter 6 for more info on site plans). Your sewer pipes need to
slope downwards so that water drains toward the public sewer system.
Be sure that your sewer system has an antireturn valve to protect you from
sewage flowing back into the house if your local sewer system overflows in a
rain storm. Kevin’s 1912 house had this problem and, besides creating a
smelly mess that only the Creature from the Dark Lagoon could love, it was
very costly to clean up.
Installing septic systems
If your property calls for a septic system based upon the work you did in
Chapter 5, then you need to install one now. Your contractor consults the
plans to determine the exact location of the septic tank for collecting waste,
and then she arranges for trenches to be dug for placing the pipe in the leech
field where the waste water drains. You’ll need to have a septic company
inspect this system before work can continue.
Every septic tank worth its salt has an access port to facilitate cleaning. Make
sure the opening to pump out the tank is located in a convenient location and
is clearly marked so you can find it later. You may want to put a stake by it so
it doesn’t get covered with dirt when excavation takes place.
Bringing in electricity
Assuming your property is on the public electric grid system, you’ll need to
tie into it to get electricity into your home. The power either comes in under-
ground or from a pole. Your power company generally gives you between 25
and 60 feet of wire — from the power pole to your home — at no charge; any-
thing after that costs extra. For example, during the course of Kevin’s custom
home project in Northern California, the power company charged $15 to $25
per foot of extra wire depending on the difficulty and labor. However, the
company also offered a credit of $1,053, allowing for a distance of 53 to 75
feet for free.
Needless to say, even considering the free wiring you’ll automatically get
credit for, if you have a big lot, running power to your home can get costly.
You may want to check with your contractor about having his laborers do the
trenching work to see if it saves any cost. If you do, don’t forget that all the
work must meet the electrical code.
226
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Your contractor sets up a temporary post with a circuit breaker and a meter
so the utility company can start measuring your usage immediately. Your
building inspector needs to inspect this temporary meter before the electric
company will connect the power.
Piping in gas
If you’re connecting to a public gas system, then your contractor will arrange
for the pipes to be trenched that will run from the gas line under your street
into your home. Details for this routing need to be noted on your site plan.
If you’re running propane gas, your supply company will usually handle the
entire installation process, including delivering and securing of your propane
storage tank. However, you don’t need to turn on either the gas or propane
prior to the installation of appliances later in the project. You and your con-
tractor need to decide together the best time to install this system. We dis-
cuss the topic of installing your rough gas piping in Chapter 13.
Spot-check — Utilities
With the utilities in place, you’re ready to start the building process in
earnest. Make sure you spot-check connections before you move on to the
next step in the process. You need a level and a tape measure.
❑Water pipes don’t leak and connections are secure. Spigot is clearly
flagged.
❑Sewer pipes are well buried and marked at the connecting point. The
inspector has signed off on the septic system.
❑Power poles are secure with no exposed wires.
❑Gas pipes are buried, and connections are clearly marked.
Take time to talk to your contractor about any issues or discrepancies and
discuss possible solutions.
Pouring Your Foundation
Because so much depends on your home’s foundation, you may argue that
the foundation is the most important part of the home-construction process.
Get it right, and your home will provide you and your family with decades —
perhaps even centuries — of service. Get it wrong, and you may find yourself
living in your worst nightmare.
227
Chapter 12: Excavation and Foundation: Getting a Solid Start

Your foundation is the base of the house. It’s responsible for supporting all
the weight of the walls, the roof, and, of course, the people who live in it.
Your architect and engineers will create specific foundation plans and calcu-
lations for your subs in the working drawings discussed in Chapter 6. These
plans let them know where everything goes and how much dirt needs to be
moved to make room for the foundation.
Your engineer plays a big part in figuring out which type of foundation is
appropriate for the kind of home you’ve decided to build and the characteris-
tics of the lot on which you plan to build it. You can read more about the
engineering process in Chapter 6. You can choose from a variety of founda-
tion types, and every local government has different requirements. Although
we explain the basic types in this chapter, you need to discuss any variations
with your contractor so that you understand what needs to be built on your
property. These decisions will likely be made with your engineer earlier
during the planning stages discussed in Chapter 5.
Regardless of the type of foundation, scheduling is critical. Some cities and
counties don’t allow any grading during the winter, so coordinating the
schedule with your contractor is important. Also, weather can play a big role
in delays during the foundation construction process (which will lead to
delays in your overall schedule). Excessive rain, for example, can cause ero-
sion problems, and concrete — which plays a large role in most foundation
work — requires six to eight hours of dry weather before being poured.
Excavating the site
Before your contractor and the specific sub pour the foundation, they’ll need
to first dig out all the dirt from where the house will be. (Check out the
“Clearing and grading” section, earlier in this chapter, for more information
about the actual process.) During the excavating stage, your lot may look like
a playground filled with bulldozers, diggers, and trucks, ready to make pits,
holes, and trenches.
The first step in excavation is removing the topsoil from the foundation area.
Then, the sub digs holes for the footings (reinforced sections at the base of
the foundation) if required. These holes will be several feet deep in cold cli-
mates so that they’re below the frost line (the maximum depth that the
ground will freeze in winter). The type of foundation you install determines
how much dirt to remove. If you’re building a basement, for example, you
may have to dig down as much as 8 feet, which is a lot of dirt that will soon
need a new home. Anyone for some free dirt? (The excavator can pile some
of the dirt in a corner of your lot so you can use it during landscaping.)
228
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Installing the foundation
In this section we detail the installation process for three very common foun-
dation structures. These basic descriptions should help you understand how
your house is supported and attached to the ground.
The perimeter footing foundation
The most common variety of foundation, built on relatively flat or gently
sloped soil, is the perimeter footing foundation. It’s called the perimeter foot-
ing foundation because it comprises concrete footings that go around the
house’s outer perimeter.
After the concrete is completely cured or hardened (a process that may take
several days), the sub removes the forms. In the case of the perimeter footing
foundation, walls are built primarily on the house’s perimeter; however the
engineer may have specified certain places where an interior wall needs to be
built to support extra weight. Additionally, the contractor may install inter-
mediate support bearing posts to help carry the weight of long stretches of
flooring. These posts are set in concrete in the middle of rooms.
Other than California — which has to worry about earthquakes — many
states allow the construction of cinderblock foundation walls around the
perimeter. These types of walls are hollow cement blocks that can be stacked
and filled with rebar and cement. Your architect and engineer can determine
the best approach for your particular home.
The concrete slab foundation
If you’re building a slab foundation, then it will be made entirely of concrete.
Slab foundations are less popular for custom homes because they don’t allow
for any sort of a basement, and they make the first floor feel very rigid.
However, on the plus side, slab foundations are fairly cost effective compared
with other options. If your house is small and relatively inexpensive, your
architect may have chosen a slab foundation. Regardless of what kind of
foundation your house has, your garage is likely to have a slab foundation
due to its ruggedness and relatively low cost.
When the concrete is allowed to set, make sure you put in a handprint or two

A very popular form of foundation today is the pier-and-grade beam founda-
tion. This foundation is versatile because it requires little or no excavation.
It’s often used for hillside application because it secures the house deep into
bedrock, preventing potential slide and settling issues. It’s also popular in
seismically active places such as California due to its earthquake resistance.
229
Chapter 12: Excavation and Foundation: Getting a Solid Start

Some contractors like to use pier-and-grade beam foundations, even on flat
lots, because they can require less concrete and less excavation, resulting in
lower costs.
Spot-check — Foundations
Now that the foundation is finished, you need to have a clear picture of how
the house will sit on the lot. Use this spot-check to be sure you’re ready to
move on. You need work gloves, a tape measure, and a level.
❑All concrete is hard and secure, and there are relatively few cracks. No
rebar is showing.
❑The foundation hardware is securely in place and not bent or broken.
❑Crawlspaces and utility connections have access points.
❑All protruding utility pipes are clearly marked and have protective foam
collars.
❑All corners are square or at proper angles per the plans.
Alert your contractor about any issues or discrepancies and then figure out
when and how to fix them.

I
f you think of a home as a body (okay, bear with us for a moment), then the
framing is the skeleton, and the rough systems — your home’s electrical and
technology wiring, plumbing, heating, and air conditioning — represent the
guts. After you have the foundation finished (we touch on foundations in
Chapter 12), you need to give your creation strong bones and the systems to
move air, water, and energy. And that’s exactly what this chapter is all about.
This chapter provides you with the framing and rough systems basics that
you need in order to have meaningful conversations with your contractor
and subs and to be able to follow up on their progress. Throughout the chap-
ter, you find short lists of spot-checks you can make during the construction
process to be sure that your contractor and subs are sticking to the plan
(and sticking to your budget!).
Things to Consider Before Framing 
and Rough Work Begin
Believe us, you have a lot to consider before the framing work actually
begins. You need to think about everything, including what materials to use,
communication schedules, and what questions you want to ask or points you
want to clarify with your contractor. Don’t worry; we help you with this part
of the heavy lifting.

But, before anyone picks up a hammer or nails, you and your contractor need
to review the plans (you know, those big pieces of paper with blue lines all
over) for marked flooring, framing, roofing, electrical, and plumbing. (You can
find more information on blueprints and plans in Chapter 5.) The detailed
engineered plans, known as working drawings, have specific instructions for
framing, subflooring, rough electrical, and rough plumbing. A precursory
review insures that everyone is on the same page about the tasks ahead.
Reviewing the specific drawings with your contractor and subs at least once
a week is a good idea. This review helps manage your expectations and keep
you informed along the way. Checking out the drawings gives you a perfect
exercise for the weekly planning meeting we recommend in Chapter 11.
Questions to ask your contractor
Understanding the stages in the building process can give you comfort and
piece of mind as many different people spend lots of your money throughout
the build. Because most people have the least understanding about the fram-
ing and rough systems stages, you need to ask your contractor and subs the
following questions:
 What is each sub responsible for?
 What are you (the homeowner) responsible for?
 Which subs are involved and when are they involved?
 What is the proper order of tasks?
 Who’s responsible for managing the coordination of tasks?
 What are my responsibilities with inspections and when will they occur?
 How does the contractor plan to keep you (the homeowner) apprised of
the schedule, costs, materials, and so on?
You’ll continue negotiations on materials and labor throughout your project.
Even though the contractor gets bids early on in the process, prices may
change. After you have the subs’ estimates for materials and labor, always
discuss with your contractor whether you can negotiate even better deals by
paying the subs cash or on a weekly schedule. If you have structured your
finances for maximum liquidity, as we discuss in Chapter 7, you should be
able to customize the project payment plan to give yourself the maximum
buying advantage (and the best prices).
Establishing a schedule
When building your own home, the schedule is everything. When your sched-
ule starts dragging, not only do you become frustrated with an apparent lack
232
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

of progress, but also the overall completion of your home may become
delayed — sometimes by weeks or even months. And, guess what? Big delays
can often cost you big money.
So, you have to stay on top of the building schedule. Discuss with your con-
tractor how long each of the subs should take to finish their part with the
framing and rough work. Times can vary greatly, depending on the size and
complexity of the house, availability of materials, weather, and so forth —
from a few days to a few months, or even more. Having a schedule doesn’t
guarantee everyone can finish on time, but it does allow you to track progress
and make adjustments, if you need to. For example, because you can bill most
labor on an hourly basis, monitoring the schedule (and keeping your contrac-
tor and subs on it) can help prevent the additional costs of paying electricians
to sit and wait for the framers to finish. See Chapter 11 for more on scheduling
with your contractor.
Trusses and I-beams: Yes or no?
Before the framing phase begins, you still need to discuss with your contractor
whether or not to use engineered lumber such as floor trusses and I-joists.
Floor trusses and I-joists are prefabricated wood structures commonly used for
framing subfloors and roofs. Although floor trusses and I-joists often cost more
than the materials that you buy for custom framing, because they’re made by
combining different kinds of wood and glue — in a process called composite
construction — they’re often stronger and the quality is more consistently made
(and therefore worth the extra expense). Your engineer may designate the use
of these materials in your plans (see Chapter 6) but you may have some room
for the contractor’s interpretation and choice of specific materials.
Trusses and I-joists are useful for running long distances when you have no
underlying support, such as in an open cathedral ceiling, for example. In
addition, when you factor in all the material waste and labor associated with
custom framing, trusses or I-joists may end up being more economical in the
long run. Many builders are using another composite material called lami-
nated veneer lumber beams (commonly referred to by brand names such as
Microlam and Paralam) extensively in their building process because of its
versatility, uniformity, and cost benefits. Lastly, engineered composite ply-
woods are used in many cases to minimize the creaking sounds that keep
everyone up late at night. This choice may or may not be more expensive
than using standard plywood, but it does help the house retain a modern feel
as it lasts through time. Common composite plywoods include waferboard or
oriented strand board. Our advice? Discuss the pros and cons of using engi-
neered materials with your contractor before the framing process begins.

Chapter 13: Framing and Rough: So Much Goes Behind Those Walls!

Looking at What’s Involved 
in Framing Your House
Someone has come up with a way of framing a house out of every material 
on earth. Grass, trees, stone, reeds, brick, adobe clay, steel, and concrete —
someone, somewhere, has used these materials to build homes. And contrac-
tors are constantly reinventing old methods or using innovative new ideas for
home construction. Modified old methods like rammed earth, where the con-
tractor compresses dirt between wood, stacked hay bales, or even recycled
automobile tires and beer bottles, are all gaining attention as structural mate-
rials today. This section walks you through framing methods step by step for
the most common materials and gives you a spot-check to discuss with your
contractor.
Understanding the framing process
By now, you and your contractor are pretty clear on the method of framing 
to be used in your home. We extensively discuss choices of framing options,
such as steel, timber frame, and log in Chapter 4. Regardless of which framing
technique you or your contractor decides to use for your home, if your home
is being framed on-site, the process order is the same. In this example, we
use the most common framing method that most people refer to as a stick-
built home.
Most people think that framing refers only to putting up walls, and the term
conjures up images of an Amish barnraising. Framing actually refers to the
entire structural skeleton of a house, not just its walls. The framing process
consists of the following phases, generally done in this order:
 Subfloor: The base floor is built below your carpeting or finished floor-
ing and on top of the foundation. A subfloor isn’t always required for a
slab foundation but is necessary if the house has a basement.
 Load-bearing walls: These walls are added to support weight on top of
the subfloor.
 Interior walls: These walls are erected, along with spaces for doors, win-
dows, fireplaces, and architectural structures, such as dormers and sof-
fits. (See our architectural amenities list in Chapter 5 for definitions of
these structures.)
 Second story: The framing sub repeats the previous three bullets to
create an additional story if required.
 Roof framing: The roof’s frame is put into place.
234
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Starting at the bottom with subflooring
Gone are the days when people had little choice but to sleep on the cold dirt,
with nothing more than a pile of leaves to act as a pillow. Nowadays, you have
floors and beds to keep mice and spiders from building nests in your hair as 
you sleep at night. After finishing the foundation, the first step in the framing
process is putting in a subfloor, which serves as a platform for building walls and
creates a base to attach flooring. Putting the subfloor in is mostly a wood-based
process, and the framer, carpenter, or general contractor generally build it.
Subfloors aren’t always necessary, however. If you’re building your house on
a concrete slab foundation, for example, you don’t need a subfloor because
your entire house is supported directly by the slab. The following list gives
you the instances when you need a subfloor:
 If you build the house on raised or pier-grade beam foundations (see
Chapter 12 for details)
 For the upper floors of multistory houses
 As a base floor underneath hardwood floors (even if you’ve built the
house on a concrete slab foundation)
Here is a brief list of parts in the anatomy of the subfloor:
 Girders: A long heavy piece of wood that spans the floor and provides
support.
 Joists: Long narrow boards set in place on their edge resting on sills and
girders. The outer joists are the header and stringer joists, and the inside
joists are called lap joists.
 Seal: A metal strip or layer of sealing material called caulk designed to
protect the wood framing from moisture and bugs. It sits between the
footing and the sill.
 Sill or sill plate: A piece of pressure-treated wood anchored to the 
foundation.
 Subfloor: Plywood lies flat over the joists usually at a perpendicular
angle to direction of the floor joists.
235
Chapter 13: Framing and Rough: So Much Goes Behind Those Walls!
The incredible, shrinking board?
The true size of the 2 x 4 that you find in any hard-
ware or home supply store actually isn’t 2 inches
x 4 inches. In reality, a 2 x 4 is more like 1.5 inches
x 3.5 inches. The term 2 x 4 represents the size of
the wood before it’s processed for use. Because
wood goes through many finishing and drying
processes before it’s sold, the board has shrunk
a lot by the time you can finally get your hands
on it for use in construction.

To avoid squeaky floors, be sure that your flooring sub glues down the ply-
wood when building the subfloor, and that she uses a ring shank nail to
secure the plywood. The nail has screw threads that hold tight.
And, while you’re at it, make sure that your sub is using flooring plywood
graded CD exterior or CDX, which is more durable to weather during con-
struction because manufacturers make it with waterproof glue. You can iden-
tify CDX plywood by inspecting the identification stamp found on each sheet.
Be sure that the subfloor has access for all the heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning (HVAC) ducting and plumbing work that you need to complete
under any flooring before it’s sealed up! Work with your contractor to stage
the process so that you don’t have to tear out work that the builders have
already completed. Going back to do work again can cost money and delay
the entire project.
Sharing the load — Load-bearing walls
After the subfloor is in place, the next step is to put up the walls. Framed
walls have a very simple structure. Whether you’re building with 2 x 4 or 
2 x 6 studs based on your plans, you use the same basic elements.
A bottom plank, called a sole plate, is the base for a series of studs (usually
925⁄8 inches in height) set 16 inches apart. Contractors take most measure-
ments for spacing from the center of any given stud to the center of the next
one. They usually note the measurements as “16 inches O.C.” (or On Center).
Sometimes to save material in nonload-bearing walls, they may place studs 
24 inches O.C. A piece of lumber matching the sole plate caps these studs and
is called a top plate. A tie plate above the top plates ties the walls together at
the junctions. The entire structure measures 8 feet 11⁄8 inches from top to
bottom for a standard 8-foot ceiling. Note that custom homes vary greatly and
your plans may call for taller ceilings. Exterior walls are generally framed first.
They will be braced in place and then attached to each other moving around
the house’s perimeter. The framing sub creates spaces for windows and door-
ways that don’t detract from the structural integrity of the wall in the framing.
The sub does this job with a header. A header is a large, strong piece of lumber
designed to distribute the wall’s weight away from the opening for the door or
window. Trimmers are side supports that transfer the weight from the header
to the sole plate. Cripples are small pieces of wood that secure narrow gaps
and make up wall height.
If assembling a log home, your contractor will be given specific instructions
on how to stack the logs. If the logs are milled in a factory, they’ll likely inter-
lock with a sealer inserted in between, but if the logs are handcrafted, then
extra shaping may take place on-site and an insulating gooey material called
chinking will need to be applied between the logs. In either case, the logs will
be bolted together as they’re stacked.
236
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Other kit homes, such as panelized, cedar, or timber frame, have their own
individual methods of assembly, but in most cases, the materials have been
precut and possibly preassembled at one time before being disassembled
and shipped to your site, which means that doors, windows, and other archi-
tectural elements have been placed and accounted for before framing starts.
The plumbing sub may need to install large plumbing fixtures, such as bath-
tubs and Jacuzzis, before you finish the framing so they can fit them into their
locations. If building materials — especially expensive building materials — 
in your community have a habit of sprouting legs and walking away, you can
chain them to the studs to prevent theft.
Framing the second story
Currently, contractors use two different methods of framing for multistory
residences:
 Platform framing (also known as stick framing) is the most common
framing method and allows for multiple levels with unique architectural
choices.
In platform framing, the framing sub builds the first walls attached to the
subfloor. The ceiling joists, or supports, then serve as floor supports or
joists for the next story. After installing a new subfloor, the framing sub
builds the second story walls on the subfloor platform, just like he did
on the story below. The sub needs to construct stairways to allow work-
ers to access upper build sites at minimal risk.
 Balloon framing uses continuous studs running from the sole plate at
the base of the house up to the roof.
This method allows for the transfer of the weight of the roof and second
story directly to the foundation. Because this method requires a uniform
outer shell of the house, balloon framing can be architecturally restric-
tive and is used much less than platform framing.
Finishing the architecture
The next step is to frame out all those wonderful architectural pieces you 
had designed for the house. If you worked with an architect, all the time and
money you spent will pay off for you here as long as you stick to the plan.
(See Chapter 5 for the discussion on what an architect can do for you.) If you
chose to work without an architect, you’ll now find out if you made the right
choice. During this stage is your last chance to make any structural changes
to the shape of the house, and expect additional costs even if you change at
this stage. If you must make a change, we tell you how to deal with change
orders in Chapter 11.
237
Chapter 13: Framing and Rough: So Much Goes Behind Those Walls!

Next, the framing sub builds the interior walls, and your home’s interior
architecture begins to take shape. Your sub frames your fireplace(s) at this
time, too. Your subcontractor may need to construct brick and stone fire-
places before closing in the floors and walls.
Dormers, decks, and soffits are built out in an almost sculpturelike fashion,
using the same spacing and support structures as the walls and subfloors. All
external structures, such as attached decks, require pressure-treated wood
and galvanized nails and hardware to make them weather resistant. Scientists
are continually creating new chemical advances to prevent rust and deteriora-
tion, so talk to your contractor about using the latest and greatest materials.
Framing the roof
The roofing subcontractor installs the roof using either individual rafters or
prebuilt trusses or I-beams (see the section “Trusses and I-beams: Yes or no?”
earlier in this chapter). Because you can find multiple roof styles and types 
of roofing materials, the structural design varies according to the span and
weight requirements of the different materials. For example, clay tile and
slate are heavy, requiring stronger framing support than a lighter asphalt
shingle.
While the house is being framed, you can spend time with your contractor
examining the roofing plan in your working drawings. (For more about work-
ing drawings, see Chapter 6.) Your contractor uses those plans to determine
the materials, labor, and amount of time necessary to finish the roof framing.
Spot-check — Framing
So, how is your contractor doing? Go through this handy spot-check to dis-
cuss whether you and your contractor are ready to move ahead. You need a
tape measure, level, T-square, and flashlight.
❑All measurements and materials match those called for in the working
drawings within a quarter inch.
❑All angles with T-squares and levels are straight and plumb.
❑Floor joists don’t interfere with plumbing and drain systems.
❑No loose, damaged, weak, or unreinforced boards are in place.
❑All lumber in contact with concrete is pressure treated (ask your con-
tractor about the lumber she used).
❑No squeaks in the subfloor or on the stairs, and measurements are 
uniform.
238
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Discuss any issues or discrepancies with your contractor and determine when
and how to fix them. Before you move on to the next phase, you may need the
building inspector to come out and inspect the framing. Communicate with
your contractor as to the time and date for this inspection. (We discuss deal-
ing with inspectors in Chapter 6.)
Installing the Rough Systems with Ease
Now that the framing is done, it’s time to add the mechanical elements that
make a house livable. Where would you be without water, hot (or cool) air,
and power? The working drawings for your home have specific plans for
plumbing, HVAC, and electrical systems. Another meeting with your contrac-
tor can go a long way in clarifying the schedule as well as the materials used
by the subs.
You and your contractor need to check your lighting and plumbing fixture
orders while going through the process of roughing out your plumbing and
electrical systems. Many suppliers don’t store large quantities of expensive
fixtures, and you may be unpleasantly surprised to find out that your pieces
are on back order on the day you want them delivered. Checking now can
save you a lot of wasted time (and money!).
When the construction crew is done with the rough work, pull out your
camera and take extensive photographs of your home’s rough systems. You
may also consider using a video camera to get more perspective. By docu-
menting your home’s inner workings, you can locate important structures
long after you’ve finished the walls. This documentation can be helpful for
repairs and renovations decades from now.
Rough plumbing
Plumbing — all those steel, copper, and plastic pipes that route water into,
through, and out of your home — is actually composed of three separate 
but interrelated systems: the water supply, the sewer system, and the vent
system. The supply brings water to different places in your home, and the
sewage system takes it away. The vent system is necessary so that the water
can move in a steady flow without bubbles or spurts.
At this point, your contractor marks the location of all plumbing fixtures on
your home’s framing, according to the working drawings. You probably want
to discuss and mark where plumbing should not go at this time because of
planned light fixtures, built-in cabinets, or for sound insulation reasons (noth-
ing’s much worse than having a regularly flushed toilet located only two or
three feet away from your head when you’re trying to get a little extra sleep
on a Saturday morning!).
239
Chapter 13: Framing and Rough: So Much Goes Behind Those Walls!

You need to walk through the house with your contractor now to discuss
material choices, fixture choices, and any special needs or conflicts that have
developed since you’ve framed the house.
For reference, here’s a brief checklist of common plumbing fixtures that you
need for your home:
 Bathtubs and faucets
 Exterior water spigots
 Garbage disposal
 Refrigerator or icemaker
 Sauna or steamroom (mandatory for our Finnish readers!)
 Septic tank, if applicable
 Shower fixtures
 Sinks and faucets — bathroom, kitchen, utility, wet bar
 Toilets, toilet seats, and bidets
 Water heater
 Water softener or conditioner
Opening the flood gates — Installing the water supply
In most cases, you can have water piped into your home from a public utility
(the water company) or from a well on your property (we cover the subject
of wells in great depth in Chapter 12). Chances are, your contractor has
already installed a meter and spigot for his use during construction, so your
house gets hooked up now. For the next step, your plumbing sub installs the
infrastructure necessary to distribute this water supply from its primary
source to every place within your home where you need it. And, believe us,
you’re going to need water in a lot of places in your home.
During installation, the plumbing subcontractor lays both hot and cold water
lines in the framed walls and crawl spaces. To help keep it safe from stray nails
or other pointy objects — both during and after the construction process —
pipe should be run through drilled holes in the studs rather than notches,
which by nature put the pipe up against the wallboard. Your plumbing sub
installs pipe supports and further protects the pipe from being pierced by nails
by using protective 11⁄2 inch metal strips with holes called FHA straps or nail
guards.
Although galvanized steel pipe was once the material of choice for plumbing
homes, most people today choose copper tubing. Why? Copper tubing is
durable, readily available, easy to work with, and relatively compact. On the
other hand, even though copper tubing can cost twice as much as steel pipe,
the labor savings have made steel virtually obsolete.
240
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Because of the high cost of copper tubing, builders have been searching for 
a less expensive substitute. Plastics, such as chlorinated poly vinyl chloride
(CPVC), have gained some measure of popularity because they’re easy to 
use and cost a lot less. Some people, however, believe plastic piping leaves
an aftertaste in the water. A relatively new plastic, called polybutylene, has
gained some popularity due to its flexibility. It allows for less joints and con-
nections, reducing the cost of installation, even though the material may cost
more on a piece-by-piece basis. It’s virtually freeze-proof, however, which can
be a big plus in cold-climate areas. Plastic plumbing isn’t yet approved in all
cities, so discuss your specific needs and requirements with your contractor
and plumber.
Generally, before you turn on your water supply, the plumbing sub conducts
a test to check for leaks or blockages in your water pipes, first using air pres-
sure and then using water. This test checks the time and water volume it
takes to fill the system. The contractor can rework any leaks or blockages
before connecting the system to the water supply.
A home isn’t complete without a water heater, and you need to install it in a
place where leakage or failure won’t likely destroy interior flooring — maybe
a closet on the exterior of your home or in the garage. Some people put it in
an unfinished basement if one exists, but placing it there doesn’t provide
easy cleanup if it were to burst (and water heaters do burst, from time to
time). At the very least, be sure that you’ve installed a protective pan under-
neath the water heater and that you use adequate bracing to support it —
particularly in earthquake-prone areas.
Getting down and dirty — The sewer system
Gravity powers your sewer and waste systems, so your lowest sink, toilet,
and drain must be higher than the sewer line that leaves your home. If
they’re lower than the sewer line leaving your home, you’re going to be in a
major world of hurt soon. The sewer line must have at least a 1⁄4-inch drop per
foot in order to operate properly. When properly installed, your sewer line

Chapter 13: Framing and Rough: So Much Goes Behind Those Walls!
To plumb or not to plumb?
Ever wonder where the word plumber came
from? It turns out that plumber — someone who
works with water pipes — is derived from the
Latin word for lead, plumbum. In ancient Rome,
they used lead water pipes, and that’s where the
words plumber and plumbing come from. Even
today, plumbers routinely use lead solder to join
together copper water pipes. Coincidentally, the
word plumb — meaning to make something
(such as a framed wall) exactly straight and ver-
tical, also derives from the Latin plumbum. In this
case, however, plumb refers to the lead weight at
the end of a string (a plumb bob) that you use to
test the straightness of a wall or other structure.

efficiently delivers waste from your home to the city hookup (where it even-
tually find its way to a sewage treatment plant) or possibly to a septic tank on
your property. We cover both of these possibilities in Chapter 12.
Your primary choices for sewer materials are cast iron or poly vinyl chloride
(PVC) pipe. Although PVC is cheaper and easier to work with, it has a tendency
to be noisy when water flows through it. If you decide to use PVC, take care to
position the pipe in walls isolated from bedrooms and media rooms where the
sound could be annoying. The drainpipes have occasional openings to the out-
side of the house, called cleanouts. These openings have removable caps so
that you can snake out difficult clogs and roots in the future.
If building a basement, discuss the placement of your home’s main sewer line
with your contractor. Make sure the sewer line doesn’t intrude on the living
space, or your carpenter may have to frame a post, breaking up the useable
area. Your plumber also cuts holes in the framing for all the drain lines that
meet with the sewer system. Make sure the plumbers don’t cut any I-joists
when installing bathtub and toilet drains. They’re notorious for doing this!
Getting a breath of fresh air — The (wet) vent system
The vent system — sometimes more completely known as the vertical wet
venting system — allows your home’s plumbing system to breathe. Without
this venting system, the plumbing would be ineffective due to problems like
siphoning and backpressure, which can stop the water flow (and believe us,
you do not want to stop the water flow in your home!). Think of this vent
system like the way water burbles slowly out of an open bottle when you turn
it upside down. If you look at the outside of a house, you notice narrow vent
pipes extending from the roof. All the drains in the home attach to one of
these vents, allowing air (and all those smelly gases) to escape.
In addition to installing the water systems, either your plumber or your HVAC
sub installs pipes for the natural gas or propane system if you have gas ser-
vice to your property. The process is similar to the water-supply plumbing.
Additionally, the contractor installs the pipes for radiant heating, which we
discuss in Chapter 5, at this point.
Make sure that pipes remain uncovered until the county or city building
inspector has signed off on the plumbing. You need to be available to walk
through your home with the inspector so that you can be aware of any issues
as they arise.
Spot-check — Plumbing
To get a good look at your plumbing, discuss the plumbing with your contrac-
tor and go over it all with her. You need a flashlight for this spot-check to
make sure that you can see in those dark parts of your home where plumbing
just naturally seems to prefer to live.
242
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

❑Vents are in hidden areas.
❑No moisture has collected at joints.
❑Pipes inside walls are securely fastened to prevent knocking.
❑Water heater is secure and has a pan underneath it.
❑Cleanouts are accessible but not going to affect the look of your interior.
Make sure you talk over any issues or discrepancies with your contractor
and discuss possible solutions.
HVAC
Your house may require multiple HVAC units for efficiency. You need to make
these choices in the design phase (see Chapter 5). When you install the units,
whether in the attic, crawlspace, or closet, be sure to discuss noise-reduction
options, such as vibration absorbers and insulation, with your HVAC subs.
Installing the mighty ducts
The ductwork for your HVAC creates passageways for air delivery and return
throughout your home. The ducts are usually made of two materials, cut and
fit at the build site. The two materials are
 Insulated fiberglass: Fiberglass ducting is becoming more popular
because you can cut it with a knife, and it has greater insulation, making
for lower installation cost and quieter airflow.
 Sheet metal: Sheet metal ducting can develop noise over time because
of temperature changes causing the metal to expand and contract. Sheet
metal is becoming less popular because it’s more expensive and harder
to work with.
The openings in the wall for air supply and air return are called registers.
Correct placement of registers is critical to the efficiency of your HVAC
system. By putting registers near doors and windows, the conditioned air
compensates for the heat or cold loss generated by these openings.
Each room needs to have at least one supply duct and one return duct. For
heat, which rises to the top of the room, you need to place the supply low
and the return high. The opposite is true for the cold air system. Discuss con-
venience and efficiency of register placement and quantity with your contrac-
tor and the HVAC sub.
In addition to ducting for the climate system, you need to install power venti-
lation ducts for bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. These ducts require elec-
tricity as well as ventilation to the outside. Discuss these ducts with your
contractor and mark them for placement.
243
Chapter 13: Framing and Rough: So Much Goes Behind Those Walls!

Installing your thermostats
Although your contractor won’t permanently install HVAC thermostats until
you finish putting up the drywall, you must decide with your contractor on
the best locations. (The location of your thermostats probably won’t be des-
ignated on the working papers. You need to revisit their locations with your
contractor during the rough work stage.) Here are some factors to consider:
 Don’t place the thermostat within 6 feet of a register or on the opposite
wall.
 Interior walls work better because outside walls can absorb outside 
temperature.
 Don’t place thermostats in rooms with a fireplace.
 Hallways make for great thermostat placement.
If building in cold weather, consider getting your heating signed off by the
inspector right away. Running the heat during the building process may make
for more productive subs, allowing them to spend less time warming up in
front of space heaters that you’re paying for. The more temperate climate
your heating system creates also helps with the drying process of the drywall
and paint, covered in Chapter 14. You can also ask your contractor about
installing a temporary furnace if you’re in a cold area and the HVAC system 
is taking a long time to install.
Spot-check — HVAC system
Wonder if your contractor’s breezing through the HVAC installation process?
The following spot-check gives you everything you need to check out before
you give him the green light to move ahead. You need a flashlight, screw-
driver, and Crescent wrench for this check.
❑Get your ducts in a row. Make sure that they don’t have any punctures,
cracks, dings, crimps, or nail holes.
❑The HVAC is securely fastened.
❑The HVAC unit’s working parts all look new under the panel. Corrosion
can happen in a unit that sits outside too long.
❑The registers are all in the appropriate places with clear airflow.
❑The ducts are fastened and insulated in crawl spaces, walls, and the attic.
Take up any issues or discrepancies with your contractor and subcontractors
and determine when and how to fix them.

Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Rough electrical
Before the electrical work starts, your electrical sub reviews the electrical
plan in the working drawings with you and your contractor to see if you need
to make changes. Your sub is a licensed electrician, and it’s her job to make
sure that she gets all electrical choices installed to code.
Building departments most often use the National Electrical Code (or NEC,
for short). The NEC is available through a number of different sources on 
the Internet for about $75; one good source is the National Fire Protection
Association Web site (www.nfpa.org). Simply pay your money, and enjoy 
the light reading.
You may want to walk the house with your contractor and electrician now to
mark where all your switches and receptacles (outlets) will go. Although your
electrical plan addresses the minimum number of switches and receptacles
required by code, you need to decide where, specifically, you want to have
them placed on the walls. You also may decide to have more switches and
receptacles installed for your convenience.
Some additions you may want to consider include
 Additional outlets around kitchen counters and breakfast areas
 Dimmer switches for more romantic lighting
 Extra outlets in the home theater areas, hobby rooms, and home office
 Switched exterior outlets at the patio and in the soffit for holiday lighting
 Switched outlets in the attic and basement
 Switches at the top and bottom for stairway lighting
 Three-way switching in bedrooms near headboards so you don’t have to
get up to turn off the lights
Wiring your home for electric power
Your local building code specifies the gauge and type of wiring that you have to
use. You can discuss with your contractor and electrician which materials give
you the best protection regarding age, corrosion, and fire. For example, Romex,
a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire, is often used. (Sometimes
called nonmetallic sheath, the formal name is NM.) Some contractors also
install metal conduit (pipe) as further protection against damage.
Your electrical sub runs cable or conduit throughout the house in different
loops, or circuits. These circuits distribute the electrical load and tie back into
protective circuit breakers at the main panel. Your electrical sub can install
subpanels — which further divide key circuits — for your convenience. He
needs to mark each of these circuits on the service panel so that you can 
identify which breaker goes to which outlet. This attention to detail saves 
245
Chapter 13: Framing and Rough: So Much Goes Behind Those Walls!

time when you’re trying to make repairs in the future. You want your sub to
mount panels in unobtrusive but convenient locations, such as in the kitchen,
or by your garage door so that you can easily locate them if and when a
breaker trips. The main service panel has a safety switch and a wire connect-
ing it to ground, which is a water pipe or metal stake going into the ground.
Many people typically take for granted how much of life depends on electric-
ity. To make sure that you haven’t neglected an electrical must-have, use this
checklist of items that require power in specific locations:
 Attic fans
 HVAC
 Bathroom heater
 Interior lighting
 Bath vent fans
 Kitchen fan
 Ceiling fans
 Light switches: One- and two-way
 Dishwasher
 Microwave
 Doorbell
 Sprinkler system
 Exterior lighting
 Stove and oven
 Garage door opener
 Sump pump
 Garbage disposal
 Washer and dryer
Wiring your home for technology
In addition to wiring your home for electric, you want to address wiring your
home for technology at the same time. Because technology is constantly
changing, wiring your house in a way that can last 20 years or more can be
very difficult. Until recently, you absolutely needed to install CAT-5 computer
network wiring if you wanted Internet access throughout your home. Today,
however, wireless systems are all the rage, and CAT-5 may soon be obsolete.
Allow for future innovations, regardless of the onward march of technology,
by running open conduit throughout the house with an outlet in every room.
That way, you can pull wires anytime you need them. Doing so requires a pull-
wire system. A firm but flexible wire is fed through the conduit and remains
there until you decide to pull cable. By attaching the cable to the end of the
wire, you can pull the cable through the conduit. Attaching and pulling an
additional pullwire through before you seal everything up is best so you can
add new cable in the future. This open conduit may add some additional
upfront costs, but it saves you money five years down the road when you
need to install the latest and greatest technogadget that requires different
wiring than currently exists in the house.
Keep these additional systems in mind when wiring:
 Computer: Wireless is gaining popularity, but CAT-5 wiring and Ethernet
jacks provide added security.
246
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

 Security system: Common practice is to wire every door and window.
 Smoke alarm: Hardwiring systems to your electrical system prevents
constant battery changes.
 Sound system: Pipe that music everywhere without tripping over
speaker wires.
 Telephone: You may want to put a jack in every room.
 TV/Cable: Like phone jacks, you may want to put a coaxial outlet in
every room.
 Vacuum: Central vacuum systems are popular in big houses, requiring
special pipes and outlets in every room.
Spot-check — Rough electrical
If you want to see whether your contractor has the right electrical stuff, see
how his work fits in the following list. You need a flashlight and tape measure.
❑All wire splices are protected and put in junction boxes (also called 
J boxes).
❑All circuits are marked in the service panel board, leaving no loose or
unidentified wires.
❑You have approved Romex or NM, wiring, or conduit, per your plans.
❑You have offset outlets and switchboxes to allow for drywall and base
molding.
❑All electrical boxes are adequately braced for ceiling fixtures to hold
heavy fixtures, such as ceiling fans and chandeliers.
Tell your contractor about any discrepancies that you notice and determine
what needs to be done to fix them.
Sheathing, Flashing, and Insulation
Normally, sheathing, flashing, and insulating are the last stages of buttoning
up the house before moving on to the finish work. However, depending on 
the time of year and the climate in your area, your contractor may choose to
sheath the house before installing the electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems.
(For example, if you’re building your house in Seattle, then your contractor
may want to button up the house quickly to protect it from the constant rain.)
247
Chapter 13: Framing and Rough: So Much Goes Behind Those Walls!

Covering the framing — Sheathing 
and flashing with your clothes on
Enclosing the framing offers protection from the elements, but leaving it open
makes for easier access. Your construction crew encloses the house during
the sheathing process. In this process the crew applies a covering material to
the outside of the framing.
Your sheathing serves several purposes:
 It adds shear strength to the walls.
 It provides backing for the siding.
 It stabilizes the studs from bending under the load and warping with the
weather.
Most sheathing today is asphalt-soaked fiberboard. A composite material
commonly referred to by its brand name Built-rite, this fiberboard is the most
common and cheapest insulator for sheathing. Other newer and more expen-
sive materials may be available for sheathing. Discuss these options with
your contractor as well as the timing of sheathing in your project.
Your contractor uses special nails with protective plates to keep from punc-
turing the outer skin of the sheathing when attaching to the studs. The crew
nails wall sheathing to the stud vertically about every foot. Over the top of the
sheathing, a permeable vapor barrier is applied, underneath the siding. The
most popular name for the product is Tyvek by Dupont. This barrier keeps
moisture out but allows air to pass. Make sure all seams are taped, and win-
dows wrapped with window wrap.
Roof sheathing is generally made of the weatherproof plywood that we discuss
in the section “Starting at the bottom with subflooring,” earlier this chapter.
Your roofing sub needs to secure roof sheathing along the rafters or trusses
every 8 inches. When sheathing the roof, the crew needs to allow for whatever
type of roof ventilation that you plan to use. The crew may need to leave
spaces at the ridges and cut holes for extruding vents and skylights. Any items
punched through your roof need to have flashing, a metal stripping nailed in
place and sealed or caulked to prevent water from leaking into your home.
After you have the roof sheathed, contractors commonly stack the roofing
material on it in preparation for the next phase of construction. These stacks
of material provide the appropriate weight to the roof sheathing, preventing
unnecessary expansion and warping.
248
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Rolling out the insulation
Now that everything is enclosed, your contractor needs to make your house
warm and cozy. You and your architect should have already discussed the type
of insulation for your house during the design phase discussed in Chapter 5;
now it’s time to put your plans to work. Your construction crew can easily roll
the commonly used blanket insulation out into the walls and ceilings.
If your supplier delivers the insulation to the site early, make sure that you
keep it dry and loosely stacked. Wet, damp, or compressed insulation loses
its insulative qualities and may become moldy or dirty. Be careful to use work
gloves when handling the insulation because the fiberglass strands can irri-
tate your skin.
Walk the house with your contractor and discuss which areas can handle
hand-packed insulation and additional soundproofing. Make sure that you
have the plumbing and ductwork completely covered and that the insulation
doesn’t cover any vent holes.
You may want to take this time to have your contractor soundproof those trou-
ble areas. Soundproofing material comes in 4-x-8-foot sheets, and the crew can
apply it to kitchens, bathrooms, HVAC areas, home theater rooms, and kids’
rooms to provide much-needed peace and quiet throughout the house.
Spot-check — Sheathing, 
flashing, and insulation
Time to make sure that your house is bundled up just the way you want it.
Check your contractor’s work, and discuss it with her, using the following list.
Has she covered all the points? You need a flashlight and work gloves for this
spot-check.
❑Your contractor has attached sheathing every foot in the middle of the
panel, every 6 inches on the edges vertically along studs, or every 8
inches for roof deck.
❑No nails are loose or extended.
❑All gaps are taped over a quarter inch.
❑Skins of sheathing aren’t torn, ripped, or broken by nail heads.
❑All skylights, chimneys, and vent pipes are sealed and flashed.
❑All wall insulation is securely fastened.
❑All windows, doors, cracks, and joints have hand-packed insulation, as
appropriate.
249
Chapter 13: Framing and Rough: So Much Goes Behind Those Walls!

If you notice any issues or discrepancies, discuss them with your contractor
and determine any possible solutions. Before you move on to the next phase,
you may need the building inspector to come out and inspect the rough sys-
tems. Communicate with your contractor as to the time and date for this
inspection. (We discuss dealing with inspectors in Chapter 6.)

I
f you find yourself reading this chapter, then you know that you’re in the
home stretch — your foundation is complete, and you’ve framed and
roughed the house. The good news? During this stage is where all the beauti-
ful stuff starts to come together and you begin to see the fruits of everyone’s
labor — including your own. The bad news? These critical areas require
craftsmanship and artistry, and most of these steps take extra time and extra
money, and require special attention to detail. (Depending upon the complex-
ity of your house, finish work can take up more than 50 percent of your entire
time and budget.) The finish work shows your contractor’s true mettle.
This chapter is a guide to understanding the finish construction phase of
your custom home project. (We address cosmetic finishing like landscaping
and hardscaping in Chapter 17.) This chapter can help you set schedules
with your contractor for all the different finish subcontractors and give you a
clearer idea what finish work is done during each phase. Much of the work
that your finish subs will do is meticulous, so keeping up the regular meet-
ings with your contractor as detailed in Chapter 11 is important.
The Icing on the Cake — 
Exterior Finishing
Enough staring at all that wood and sheathing, it’s time to make this house
look like a home. Now that the major construction tasks are complete, your
contractor and each specific sub can finish the outside walls, the roof, and

the driveway, and install lighting to brighten up everything. During this stage
is when your home begins to look like that artist rendering you have been
staring at for the last year. And, believe us, that’s a very good feeling.
Applying wall coverings
Your new home’s walls need to be covered. Whether the house is
Mediterranean, Tudor, or California ranch style, it needs some sort of outside
surface.
You basically have three choices for outside wall coverings:
 Siding
 Stone
 Stucco
The following sections give you information about each choice. Ultimately,
your decision will be made based upon your personal taste along with any
guidelines imposed by your community. We discuss these design guidelines
in Chapter 5.
Siding
Siding is popular in areas with older-style homes, but you’ll find it used most
anyplace. Your siding sub has four major types of siding to choose from
(assuming your architect didn’t already specify a particular material):
 Wood
 Vinyl
 Aluminum
 Cement board
Our advice is to choose wood if aesthetics are your primary concern.
Unfortunately, although wood is the most beautiful siding material, it’s the
most expensive and requires ongoing maintenance in the form of painting,
and can suffer damage from sun, rain, insects, and rot. Vinyl and aluminum —
which can be purchased in a wide variety of colors — are the more durable
types of siding, but they don’t look as good as wood and vinyl doesn’t protect
as efficiently against moisture as other materials.
The latest thing in siding and a favorite with contractors is cement board. 
It’s sometimes referred to as hardi board or Hardie Board, because it’s manu-
factured by James Hardie. You can check out this siding material at www.
hardie.com. This siding is very cost effective. It goes on easily, is relatively
inexpensive, and is impervious to insects, rot, fire, and birds. It holds paint
252
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

up to 15 years because of its thermal stability, it looks like wood, and comes
in several styles including a cedar shake. The biggest advantage to this siding
is it’s fire resistant. Any type of siding is installed relatively quickly because
it’s premanufactured and uniform.
Stone
If you have chosen a house with a stone or brick exterior, your subcontractor
has two choices:
 Real brick or stone: Brick or stone is a fairly expensive proposition and
requires special craftsmen called masons to assemble it correctly. It pro-
vides great beauty but can have difficulties decades later if the mortar
starts to fail.
 Masonry veneer: Masonry veneer is a covering — made to look like
stone, brick, or possibly adobe — that is far less expensive to purchase
and install than the real thing. Imagine bricks or rocks that are up to 8
inches wide but only 21⁄2 inches thick. (In states like California where
earthquakes are prominent, masonry veneer is the only brick home you
can have because of seismic requirements.)
Your sub carefully matches the patterns and cover patches so even your
nosy Aunt Mabel won’t know it’s not real brick or stone.
Stucco
In addition to siding and masonry, you can choose one more commonly used
exterior finish — stucco. Stucco is a thick, concrete-based substance — similar
to the mortar applied between bricks when building a wall — applied to your
home’s exterior. To install, the stucco sub first mounts wire lath (think chicken
wire) to your house’s exterior walls to give the stucco something to stick to
and to help hold its shape. The first coat of stucco will be about 3⁄4-inch thick.
After the first coat dries sufficiently, the sub applies a brown coat (a smoothing
layer that may or may not be brown) to smooth out any uneven surfaces.
Finally, after the brown coat dries, a final color coat is applied. A good stucco
sub can offer a variety of different textures (and even colors, premixed into
the coating) to suit your taste — conservative, wild, or something in between.
Finishing an attached deck
If your plans call for building an attached deck, then it needs a finish. Assuming
your deck is complete (if not, then get to it!), now is the time to lay in the top of
the deck and decide on a finish. (If you need some help with your deck plans,
check out Decks & Patios For Dummies by Robert Beckstrom and the editors
of the National Gardening Association [Wiley].)
253
Chapter 14: Heading for the Finish: So Much Detail

Your deck will get a lot of traffic, so make sure you choose a finish that can
stand up to heavy wear and tear, as well as to the elements. A wood deck, for
example, is beautiful, but it can show the effects of aging and won’t last
unless it’s refinished periodically (exactly how often depends on the quality
of the product you use and the amount of wear and tear your deck receives
from usage and weather). The best coating for a wooden deck is a penetrat-
ing transparent water sealer that allows you to see the wood, but at the same
time protects it from the elements.
Many people believe that a concrete deck doesn’t require a finish. This belief
is a mistake; even concrete can wear and become stained. A sealer can help
keep the concrete deck cleaner and looking better, while making it last longer.
You may want to consider rubberizing materials if you intend to use the deck
for sports play (such as basketball or street hockey). Some homeowners find
that using indoor/outdoor carpet can give their concrete decks a warmer,
more comfortable feel. You can consider these options after your house is fin-
ished and you’ve moved in.
Up on the roof — Roofing and rain gutters
You and your contractor should have ordered your roofing materials back in
the framing stage and hopefully by now they have arrived on-site and are sit-
ting up on your roof, waiting to be installed. If the materials are here, sit
down with your contractor and pull out the roofing plan from the working
drawings we talk about in Chapter 6. The roof plan serves as a guide for
making sure the roof looks exactly as you dreamed and as your architect
intended. The roof plan specifies the types of materials as well as the quanti-
ties of materials necessary to finish the job. You’ll likely hear your contractor
and subs refer to the amount of roofing material to be used in terms of
“squares.” One square of roofing material equals the amount necessary to
cover 100 square feet of roof, a 10-foot by 10-foot area. The plans should call
for enough material to cover the total square footage of the roof as well as an
additional 10 percent for waste because pieces will have to be cut to fit the
edges of the roof.
When you and your contractor order the roofing material, having a little too
much is far better than not enough. If you run out and order more, the shin-
gles may not match. Different dye lots of shingles may sometimes vary in
their appearance — even if they’re marked with the same color on the pack-
age. Take it from us: Your roof will look better if the shingles match.
The roofing sub and laborers attach the materials to your new roof’s sheath-
ing, generally, a layer of plywood covered with a layer of tarpaper, and cover
the metal stripping (called flashing) installed around the chimney and extrud-
ing vent pipes (from furnaces, plumbing, ventilation fans, and other sources).
If the sheathing and flashing aren’t in place yet, then have a look at Chapter 13
for a detailed description of the process.
254
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Although flashing is most commonly used to seal areas around chimneys and
vents, your roofing sub may use additional flashing to cover seams and valley
sections of the roof in order to provide further protection from moisture. If
your roofing sub makes this suggestion, we advise that you agree to it.
Your roofing sub will also finish the cornice, which is the area between the
roof edge and the exterior wall also sometimes called the eave, the part of
the roof that hangs over the wall. (Your architect already specified the type of
cornice to be installed in the roofing plan.)
Depending upon your local building department requirements, an inspection
of the roof may be required after sheathing and flashing. (We talk more about
inspectors in Chapter 11.) After the roof has been sheathed, flashed, and
inspected, the roofers will put down tarpaper with staples. They’ll roll out a
protective roofing felt and attach it to the roof for further protection. The
next step is installation of the roofing materials, generally, either shingles or
tiles.
Selecting and installing your shingles
You probably picked the type of roof for your home during the design
process outlined in Chapter 5. If you’re still deciding on materials, we break
down the benefits of various shingle types in the following list:
 Asphalt shingles: These are the least expensive and most common in
housing. These thin shingles are made from fiberglass and asphalt. The
lifespan of an asphalt roof is generally 15 to 20 years.
 Clay tile: Although beautiful, clay tile is a heavy roofing material and
requires a reinforced roof to support it. Clay tile is usually terra cotta in
color and comes in different shapes. Newer clay tiles are sometimes
made from plastic or synthetic materials and are lighter. Tile is very pop-
ular in the West because of its fire-retardant properties. Clay tiles can
cost 30 times the price of an asphalt roof, but last 50 or more years.
 Laminated fiberglass shingles: These shingles contain the same materi-
als as asphalt; however, they’re thicker and can be fashioned with differ-
ent textures to give the roof different looks. They cost twice as much as
asphalt shingles, but last 10 to 15 years longer.
 Sheet metal: Metal roofing isn’t actually a tile but large rolled plates of
metal. It’s lightweight, fairly easy to install, and comes in a variety of
colors. Sheet metal is very popular in snow areas because it allows for
snow to slide off the roof more easily. It’s ten times the cost of asphalt
shingles but lasts two to three times as long.
 Slate: Slate roofing is a stone material that is durable and elegant. Like
tile, slate is extremely heavy and requires roof reinforcement. Slate is
also pricey, costing 30 times that of an asphalt roof; however, it lasts
more than 100 years.
255
Chapter 14: Heading for the Finish: So Much Detail

 Wood shake shingles: Some people still prefer wood shake shingles for
their custom home projects because they look great. These shingles
cost five times the cost of asphalt shingles but have the same life span.
Wood shingles are much less fire retardant than the other shingle types
and have been banned in high fire danger areas such as Southern
California.
To install shingles, your roofing sub and laborers lay a 9-inch-wide starter
strip of roofing material across the eave or edge of the roof. In colder, harsher
climates, at least one or two rows of ice and water shield are required on the
edge of the roof. Then — just as in the case of tile roofs — the sub and his
laborers layer the shingles in overlapping rows from the bottom of the roof to
the top and fasten them into place with galvanized roofing nails. Sheet metal
roofs will be rolled out or have premanufactured interlocking seams on the
edge of their panels, which make for easy installation.
Tile and slate are more difficult to install than regular shingles and they’re
subject to breakage if walked on after installation, or if some errant space
junk hits your roof.
Most tile roofing pieces are designed to interlock with one another so that
their own weight holds them in place. Your roofing sub and laborers first
fasten small strips of wood called battens to the roof to provide spacing and
support. They then set the tiles in place, starting at the bottom of the roof
and working up. As the roofers work toward the top of the roof, they layer
each level so that it overlaps the lower one. Artful cutting is necessary at
seams and around chimneys and vents. At the top, special “peak” tiles are
installed, which hang over both sides of the top of the roof. This layering
forces water to stay above the tile surface and run over the roof rather than
under it.
Gutters and drainage
Whatever your roof size or style, creating proper drainage is absolutely
essential. If water backs up on your roof, it will soon find its way under your
roofing material — and into your home. No matter what type of drainage
system is installed, walk the property with your contractor to make sure the
system is installed in a way that looks good on the house and works effi-
ciently to remove water. The latter can be tested with a hose run on the roof
to watch water drainage patterns.
To accomplish the goal of getting water off your roof quickly and efficiently,
your roofers will flash your roof’s valleys and angle your roof to channel
water down the surface and toward the edge. If water is allowed to flow down
to the ground directly from your roof, however, it will likely settle around the
foundation, which can create settling problems in the foundation or moisture
problems with the wood at your home’s base. You don’t want either of these
outcomes to occur, and that’s where guttering comes into play.
256
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Gutters are channels — most often made of aluminum, plastic, or fiberglass —
that collect the water that runs down your roof’s surface and channel it into
drainpipes at the corners of the house. Gutter subcontractors (who, by the
way, generally charge by the foot) install the gutters with long, galvanized
steel nails placed roughly every five feet. When installed correctly, gutters
should be sloped down toward the drainpipe at a rate of 1 inch for every 
12 inches of lineal feet. Your contractor can help you figure out the number of
downspouts necessary and the methods of drainage at the foundation.
Drainpipes connect to underground tubing that leads the water to your storm
drain, or sometimes just to a concrete or plastic splash block that leads the
water away from the house.
Installing the driveway — Finish options
Depending on your project’s location and your contractor’s preference, your
driveway and sidewalks will generally be installed in the latter stages of your
project. In rural areas, your driveway may simply be a gravel road; it may
need to be created first so your subs can access the building site. In more
urban areas, your choices can range from simple asphalt, which is a blend of
tar and gravel, to luxurious stamped concrete — concrete that may be col-
ored and that has patterns stamped into it while it’s still wet.
Which material you choose for your driveway may depend, in part, on your
neighbors. If you build in a rural area where houses are few and far between
with no homeowner association restrictions, you may choose a less-expensive
material for your driveway, like loose gravel. But if you build in a development,
your community’s codes may require you to choose the more finished look of
asphalt, concrete, or even some type of decorative paver. Other choices of
materials may depend upon cost and climate. Address the choice of driveway
materials in the design process discussed in Chapter 5.
257
Chapter 14: Heading for the Finish: So Much Detail
Keeping out of the gutters
Gutters can cause big problems if they get
clogged with leaves or dirt. Water can pool or
spill over, causing the very same problems they
were installed to prevent. But, have no fear!
New improvements are available today specif-
ically designed to keep you out of the gutters!
Some companies have designed gutters with
special covers that allow water in, while keep-
ing leaves and other foreign materials out.
Although these new-fangled gutters can be
expensive, the cost (and the very real danger to
you, if you decide to climb a ladder and do it
yourself) of cleaning your gutters every year
can add up — especially if your house is multi-
story and requires extended time on ladders. Do
some research on the cost of maintenance and
figure out how long it will take you to make up
the upfront cost in savings.

If you and your architect have designed a fancy driveway, keep this advice in
mind: You may want to request that your contractor make the driveway the
last thing installed before project completion so that construction traffic
(those bulldozers, cranes, and heavy trucks can leave quite an impression!)
doesn’t destroy any of its beauty.
Concrete has become the most popular driveway material due to its durabil-
ity and beauty. When installing concrete driveways and walkways, first the
concrete sub builds wooden forms (wood boards that keep concrete within a
certain area) in the shape of the driveway. The sub next sets in place metal
rebar (reinforcing steel bar) on small blocks. The installed rebar looks like a
net and it reinforces the concrete after it is poured. The sub then installs
expansion joints (gaps between the slabs) to allow concrete slabs to move
without cracking due to heat or cold (or earthquakes, in California). Before
the concrete pour, the sub places and compacts a base of crushed limestone
or recycled concrete to give the concrete a longer life. Your concrete sub
takes into account the current temperature and humidity — vital elements in
deciding exactly what concrete mixture to use — to assure the pouring of a
clean slab. The driveway will be finished with a slight slope away from the
house to allow for drainage. Cosmetic stamping, if desired, occurs soon after
the concrete is poured.
Exterior lighting
After your home’s exterior is finished, your electrician installs the outdoor
lighting that is attached to the house. You and your architect selected light-
ing fixtures when you created your detailed materials list (see Chapter 5). 
No magic to finishing this part — the electrician simply turns off the juice and
fastens those puppies in place. Because this task is fairly easy work, you do-
it-yourselfers may want to participate in some of this installation process if
your electrician is willing to let you help.
Make sure you don’t have any standing water around when you turn on the
power or you could get shocked! If you’re installing halogen lighting, be sure
to use gloves or plastic when installing the bulb. You don’t want to touch it;
otherwise the natural oil from your skin will significantly reduce the life of
the bulb.
Spot-check — Exterior finishing
Now that your home’s exterior is finished, your new neighbors can admire
your home’s good looks. To keep them admiring your home for years to
come, use this spot-check to insure that those good looks won’t fade fast. You
need a ladder, a tape measure, and a hose connected to water. Be careful up
on that roof!

Moving Inside — Completing
Fireplaces and Walls
As soon as the outside of your new home starts shaping up, you can turn
your attention to the inside, which means installing fireplaces, closing up and
completing your walls, and prepping everything for painting.
Fireplaces and hearths
Most fireplaces today are prefabricated boxes that are readily installed in a
space framed for this purpose by your carpenter. With insulated chimney
shafts, there is little need for brick or stone other than for outside decorative
or architectural considerations. A fireplace is best considered early in the
building process because
 You need to order materials well ahead of installation.
 Your community may have restrictions on the type of fireplace, such as
wood-burning or gas.
259
Chapter 14: Heading for the Finish: So Much Detail

 If your house has gas and you decide to run a gas line to it (to fuel gas
logs or to use as a fire starter), you’ll have to run the required plumbing
long before you get to this point in your build. We talk about gas lines in
Chapter 13.
A custom masonry fireplace requires a proper draft (airflow from inside your
home, up through the flue, and out of the top of the chimney) to function. A
poor-breathing chimney can cause smoke to enter your house (causing your
smoke detectors no end of trouble); too much breathing, on the other hand,
makes keeping a fire lit difficult. Prefab fireplaces make life easy because they
rarely have these problems.
Other considerations in a custom fireplace may be building a raised hearth to
make access easier and an ash dump if the fireplace is on the ground floor.
Some masons build in a fresh air vent allowing the fireplace to suck air from
the outside of your home without sacrificing the warm air inside.
The last piece to be added to your fireplace is the mantel, that (usually)
wooden shelf installed over your fireplace opening. A mantel can be custom
built or bought prefabricated — many people acquire antique mantels from
older demolished houses that can look quite nice. Make sure the mantel is
firmly secured with fasteners before hanging your Christmas stockings.
Drywall and wall textures
Drywall is a kind of wall covering made of plaster or gypsum sandwiched
between two layers of heavy gauge paper. Homebuilders commonly use it
today to cover interior walls because it is uniform and easy to install. A few
artists can still lay the old lath and plaster method of wall finishing (using
wood strips and real plaster), but that method is generally too expensive
compared to drywall, and doesn’t provide any great benefit for the additional
time and cost.
Drywall comes in two common thicknesses: 3⁄8 inch and 5⁄8 inch. The thicker
board — 5⁄8 inch — is more commonly used to prevent warpage, or rippling of
the finished surface. Warpage can occur in moist climates if you have studs
spaced far apart, say 24 inches. You definitely want to avoid warpage.
(Moisture is bad for drywall period, so make sure you store the drywall in a
dry place on the site until it’s installed — not out in your backyard in the
pouring rain.)
Drywall is generally available in sheets of either 4 x 8 feet, 4 x 10 feet, or 
4 x 12 feet. Drywall sheets have tapered edges on the long side and full edges
on the short side. This way, when two tapered sides are put together, it cre-
ates a channel for drywall tape and mud to be applied, which are used to
cover up and hide the joints between adjoining pieces of drywall. The result
is a smooth, flat wall.
260
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Working with a drywall sub
Your drywall sub is one the most crucial players in making your house look
good. Discuss with your contractor about getting the best drywall sub you
can afford, and you’ll thank yourself a thousand times over when your
custom home is complete. You can tell you have a good sub if she cuts pieces
in place ensuring a tight smooth fit, if finishing coats are thin and feathered,
and if the first two coats are so smooth that sanding is unnecessary.
Whether you want to hear it or not, a good drywall sub will likely tell you
whether or not your framer did a good job. Knots, warped lumber, and out-
of-square walls make her job more difficult, and your drywaller won’t be shy
letting you know about it. If the problems are significant, you may need the
framer to fix them before the drywall sub can start.
You may have some additional choices to make at this stage that can cost
additional funds. Discuss the following options with your contractor and dry-
wall sub before work on these tasks begins:
 Fancy textures: Texture can add depth to a room, and the sub will have
a selection available.
 Unstippled ceilings: Standard ceilings have a standard texture, but cre-
ating a smooth ceiling takes work and skill, which means additional cost.
 Water-resistant drywall: Over time, this drywall will hold up better in a
humid climate or in the dreaded event of water damage from a leak.
Installing drywall
When your drywall sub starts to work, she’ll generally install the drywall hor-
izontally, with the full sides joining at the studs. Doing so reduces the amount
of joints to be taped and places the strongest area of the panel across the
studs. At the outside corners she’ll install a metal strip with a beaded edge
where the panels meet.
Your drywall sub covers ceilings in the same way as walls, except that if you
desire a rougher (stippled) texture, she won’t have to repeat the application
of joint compound and sanding steps. Application needs to be done in moder-
ate temperatures to ensure a quality job.
Spot-check — Fireplaces and walls
With walls and a fireplace, your home is starting to feel cozy. Check this list
before moving on to be sure it’s built to last. You need a flashlight, matches,
newspaper, a Duraflame log, and a bucket of water.
261
Chapter 14: Heading for the Finish: So Much Detail

❑All bricks or stones on the fireplace have no cracks and are firm and
secure, as is the mantel.
❑The flue vents properly and will sustain a fire. Light a small Duraflame
log and have a bucket of water handy just in case there is a problem.
❑Rough cuts on drywall are cut close around window and door openings
as well as plugs, switches, and ventilators so trim and plates cover 
properly.
❑The drywall doesn’t have any bumps or warpage. Look down the length
of the drywall with a flashlight to verify. Circle flaws with a pencil for
repair.
❑No corner bead is exposed.
Discuss any issues with your contractor and determine when and how to rec-
oncile them.
The Finish Carpenters — Doors,
Windows, Molding, Cabinets,
and Countertops
No, the finish carpenters aren’t from Finland, but they are responsible for the
finest details in your home, which determine whether your home is ordinary
or extraordinary because you (and your friends, business associates, and rel-
atives) can see their work everywhere.
Your contractor will likely have long-established carpentry subs, but if you
have a choice in selecting carpenters, choosing this subcontractor should
entail a very deliberate process of examining your candidates’ skills and
workmanship before you even think about making a hire. Make sure you see
as many previous samples of this person’s work as you can before you and
your contractor decide to give him the job.
When you and your contractor select the finishing carpenters, remembering
what types of jobs each sub will perform on your house can make the deci-
sion easier. The following is a list of jobs typically completed by your finish
carpenters:
 Hang interior and exterior doors
 Set door sills
 Set windows and window sills
 Install closet and pantry shelving
262
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

 Install stairway trim and decorative railing
 Install base and crown molding
 Install decorative molding such as chair and picture rails and wainscoting
When working with your contractor to select your finish carpenters, keep in
mind that they may figure their bids in different ways. Some calculate their
job by the number of openings cut into the wall (for example, the number of
windows and doors) or the number of cuts they have to make. Others charge
on a time basis by the hour or by the day. You can save money by having
your contractor negotiate for the whole job and then work to make as few
changes as possible.
After your contractor has selected the finish carpenters, make sure you and
your contractor have planned your finish completely. Ideally, all your materi-
als need to come from the same suppliers — this way, everything matches. If
you run out of trim during the course of the build process and have to order
from a different supplier, you may find slight variations in the color, grain,
weight, or other aspects of the materials.
After you’ve ordered your materials and they’ve arrived, remember that
you’ll be storing a lot of trim material at the site, including moldings, rails,
doors, and more. Make sure the material is stacked in a dry, out-of-the-way
place where it won’t be damaged from foot traffic or by the outside elements
during the construction process. Scratches, nicks, and broken glass can cost
you extra money due to repair or increased waste and material cost.
Doors and windows
Here’s a bit of advice from someone who has hung a lot of doors: Doors must
always be hung level or plumb, and the door trim should also be level and
square. If your sub fails to take this essential step, then we can almost guaran-
tee that you’ll have problems closing your doors at some time in the future —
hardware may not match up and the door simply won’t work properly. Make
sure your sub takes special care when creating the correct clearance at the
bottom. If doors are installed incorrectly, they can stick — taking a lot of effort
to fix.
Your exterior doors will be solid and in many cases decorative. Weather strip-
ping is an essential add-on for exterior doors because it saves energy. Discuss
with your contractor who will be providing the weather stripping because it
may not be the finishing sub.
You have choices with interior doors that depend upon price and the look
you desire. At the bottom of the price barrel are hollow-core masonite doors.
These doors have an outer frame with a sheet of masonite on either side.
263
Chapter 14: Heading for the Finish: So Much Detail

They’re light, inexpensive, and easy to hang but must be painted and don’t
provide any real aesthetic benefit.
Alternatively, you can choose from many prefabricated hollow-core doors
today with imprinted three dimensional patterns and simulated wood grain.
These doors still require painting, but can add a nice decorative flair and are
simple to install. You can also purchase some hollow-core doors with wood
veneer that can be stained.
Custom doors will set you back in price. These doors can be beautiful, but
solid-core doors are heavy and need expert hanging. Furthermore, they need
to be ordered far in advance to make sure they’re at the house in time for the
finishing sub. Your door decisions are best made during the architecture
phase of your custom home project, as discussed in Chapter 5. Doing so
allows your contractor and finishing sub to make appropriate arrangements
in advance.
Prehung door and window frames can make life much easier and can be
easily fit into place. Most of today’s windows are made from metal, wood, or
vinyl and are completely self-contained units. If your windows weren’t
installed immediately after framing, discussed in Chapter 13, your carpenter
now secures the door or window unit in place and then levels it with small
flat wedges of wood called shims. When the unit is level and secure, he
installs flat or decorative trim called casing around the window or door to
hide all the framing and make it look uniform.
Baseboards and moldings
Baseboards (molding that runs along the corner of the wall and floor) are rela-
tively simple for your finishing carpenter to install. He simply seats the mea-
sured and cut boards against the floor and secures them onto the wall with a
nail gun. (Gone are the tedious days of carpenters pounding in finish nails
and then painstakingly sinking each nail below the surface with a small metal
punch.) The corners of the baseboard will likely be mitered, meaning they’re
cut at angles so they fit smoothly and cleanly into place.
You have other finish molding options to consider, such as:
 Chair or picture rails are decorative molding strips that run somewhere
along the middle of the wall.
 Crown molding runs along the corner of the ceiling and the wall or
sometimes just below the ceiling. Crown molding is more difficult to
apply because most decorative crown sits at an angle to the wall, which
can make negotiating corners and angles difficult.
These options require a little more expertise to install and will require addi-
tional costs.
264
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Keep in mind that, because these moldings are in direct sight, critical neigh-
bors and mothers-in-law will probably scrutinize them more. The almost-lost
art of coping is the solution. Although most finishing subs can miter joints in
their sleep, it takes real talent to hand carve molding with a coping saw to fit
perfectly. If your trim is finished wood rather than painted, finding a finishing
sub capable of this skill is critical.
Another challenge with moldings (which are generally flat) is dealing with
curved walls. A good carpenter can work angles almost into curves — an
absolute necessity for wood grain trim. Custom warped pieces can be made
but are very expensive. If the trim is being painted, new flexible moldings are
available today that can bend around complex curves. Discuss these choices
with your architect in the planning stages so there will be fewer surprises
when you’re so close to moving in. (See Chapter 5 for more design topics.)
After the trim is in place, your finishing carpenter fills in any nail holes with
putty. After the putty dries, the carpenter sands and then stains or paints the
nail holes.
Your finishing carpenter and laborers also complete railings and spindles (the
individual spokes) on your staircase. They work painstakingly to secure each
piece before applying the banister (the top of the railing), and sanding and fin-
ishing the railing. Your carpenter also finishes the steps and risers (the facing
pieces of your stairs).
Cabinetry and countertops
Cabinets and counters are installed in the most expensive rooms of the 
house — the kitchen and bathrooms.
The bad news? You’ll sink a lot of money into these functional decorative ele-
ments. The good news? You can derive great value by investing in good qual-
ity and pleasing design. Prefabricated cabinets are common today, and they
can be made in excellent quality and accommodate custom sizes and needs.
Buying prefab cabinets can be significantly cheaper than having a carpenter
build your cabinets from scratch, but depending on the look you want and
taking into account the intricacy of the cabinet areas, custom may be neces-
sary or desirable. Discuss your options with your architect when making
choices about wall shapes and areas.
You’ll have many choices to make before ordering, including shapes, styles,
and colors of your new cabinets. You can also choose from a variety of
options including inserts, pull-out drawers, lazy susans, dish and spice racks,
trays, and more. Are you having fun yet? If using prefabricated cabinets, most
of these specifications are chosen early in the process with your architect or
contractor.
265
Chapter 14: Heading for the Finish: So Much Detail

When ordering prefabricated cabinets, you may get a significant discount
from your sub if you order all the house cabinets from one manufacturer. If
you have chosen relatively simple stock designs, some bathroom cabinets
may come with preinstalled counters affording you savings in time and
money. Discuss these options with your contractor and sub.
Just as you have an almost unlimited number of options available for cabi-
nets, you also have an almost unlimited number of options available for coun-
tertops. For years, the kitchen countertop of choice was Formica. Today,
however, those old Formica tops are looking pretty dated, and many custom
home owners are instead opting for the long-lasting beauty of granite,
marble, or tile. You can also choose from several synthetic choices such as
Corian and Silestone. Your budget and taste generally determine which one
you select.
In your regular meeting with your contractor, make sure that the appropriate
subs have been scheduled correctly so that, for example, your tile sub starts
work after the cabinets have been installed instead of before. (Check out
Chapter 11, which explains the importance of having regular meetings with
your contractor and what you need to discuss.)
Reconfirm the measurements and layout of your kitchen and bathrooms with
your cabinet sub. Make sure he has the dimensions of the appliances as well
as the placement of windows and doors. This information insures that every-
thing fits in all the right places. Walk through all the cabinet areas with your
contractor and sub immediately after framing to make sure everyone is in
agreement on the plan. You can mark on the floor or studs with chalk. Your
contractor makes sure the appliances are installed correctly so that your car-
penter can finish the areas around them.
The following list provides some typical dimensions to remember as refer-
ence. These are standard dimensions. Any variations on these measurements
require custom ordering and installation (which costs you a lot more money).
Try to avoid them if possible.
 36 inches: The countertop height from the floor
 32 inches: The optimum height for built-in desks and writing tables
 24 inches: The knee space required underneath desks
 24 inches: The standard countertop depth
 3 to 4 inches: The standard back-splash height behind sinks
If you schedule your walk-through before the drywall is installed, you need to
remember to account for the thickness of the drywall as well as the width of
molding to be added when measuring for cabinetry. Check these numbers
with your contractor carefully.
266
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Some contractors feel cabinets should be installed and then stained or
painted for the best look. Others believe before any of the cabinets are actu-
ally set in place, they need to be stained, painted, or otherwise finished.
Doing so makes sure that otherwise hard-to-reach areas are fully covered and
will keep stain or paint from getting onto unwanted surfaces. Discuss the
options with your contractor.
Upper cabinets for the kitchen are installed first. Why? Because putting them
up without the base cabinets in the way is easier. After the base cabinets
have been installed, the carpenter can cut countertops and fasten them
securely in their proper positions. Next, the carpenter cuts appliance holes
(but make sure your finishing carpenter cuts the holes when the appliances
are actually on-site, so you can double-check the dimensions). After the car-
penter adds the back splashes, he caulks all seams and joints, adds drawers,
and attaches pull knobs. He also repairs any scratches or marks. Sometime
during this phase of your project, the finishing carpenter also installs bath-
room vanities. Check with your contractor to schedule the plumber so he can
connect the sinks, drainpipes, and faucets after installation.
Spot-check — The finish carpenters
Are your carpenters doing the right stuff? Or are they just a couple of singers
named Richard and Karen? Check this list before moving on. You need a tape
measure, level, and flashlight.
❑All doors open and close freely. Locks work smoothly. A 1⁄4-inch clearance
exists above carpet or threshold height.
❑Windows are level and open freely with no squeaks or binding. Screens
are installed.
❑Weather stripping for both doors and windows is securely in place.
❑All marks and nails are covered and finished.
❑Staircase railings and spindles are secure and smooth.
❑All cabinet doors open and close without squeaking. When opened
halfway, they stay put.
❑Cabinet finishes are even, not blotchy.
❑Countertops are secure and level. Place a marble on the surface to see if
it rolls (if it does, there is a problem).
❑All drawers work properly and can be easily removed and replaced.
❑All joints are caulked and built-in appliances properly fitted.
Discuss any issues or discrepancies with your contractor and determine pos-
sible solutions.

Chapter 14: Heading for the Finish: So Much Detail

All the Pretty Stuff
This section covers the D in detail — all the little items that people often take
for granted, but that stick out like a sore thumb if they aren’t done right. If
you have updated or remodeled a home in the past, then you have probably
worked with some of these processes before. Many of the details in this sec-
tion are standard home-improvement techniques and, aside from this
overview, you can find more information and specifics in Home Improvement
For Dummies by Gene Hamilton and Katie Hamilton (Wiley).
Painting
Having the interior painting finished before the flooring goes in is a good
idea. Believe us, nothing is worse than having a big, sticky paint or
polyurethane accident on your brand-new hardwood floors or carpet.
Many people like to consider doing the painting themselves. Unfortunately,
not everyone is truly a Rembrandt, and it takes a lot of time to paint a house.
Consider the following:
 Do you have the skill?
 Do you have the time?
 Do you have the physical ability?
If you can comfortably say yes to all three of these questions, then you can
certainly have some fun doing the painting while saving a little money in the
process. If you’re busy with work, or if the last time you painted was with
your fingers or little Susie’s pigtails, then this work is probably best left to
professionals.
If you decide to hire a painting sub, discuss with your contractor the need for
hiring the best painter with great references and insurance. Try to see sam-
ples of his or her work on other home projects if you can. Remember: Your
walls are the finished surface that everyone will see. Don’t be cheap about
the artist or the materials.
Your new house has additional needs because it has never been painted
before. For example, new drywall needs a coat of primer and two coats of
paint to seal and cover the first time — even with guaranteed one-coat paint.
Your painter needs to be a true professional to be able to anticipate and deal
with these special needs.
Different surfaces have different finish requirements. Here are standard sur-
face and finish choices:
268
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

 Walls in bedrooms and living areas — Flat finish
 Doors, trim, and woodwork — Gloss or semigloss because they repel 
fingerprints
 Kitchens and bathrooms — Gloss and semigloss because they’re easier
to clean and repel moisture
Another common question for the happy homeowner is what type of paint to
use. You basically have two choices in materials. Both can be obtained with a
variety of finishes. Discuss the best choice with your contractor and your
painter.
 Oil: Oil used to be the paint of choice because of its durability. It bonds
well to wood and metals and works well on oily or dirty surfaces.
Oil can be a problem in damp climates, however, because the moisture
repels the oil base during application. Other disadvantages of oil are
that brushes and spills can only be cleaned with thinner, and it smells
bad until it dries. Oil is generally considered the best choice for the exte-
rior, but not for the interior.
 Water-based paints, such as acrylic latex: Acrylic latexes have become
extremely popular due to their ease of use. They are durable and safe,
and cleaning up brushes and spills during the application process is
easier. And because these water-based paints dry much faster than oil-
based paints and produce no fumes, they can be the best choice for inte-
rior walls.
When considering water-based paint for exterior use, be aware that it is
a porous paint, meaning that moisture can penetrate it when applied
poorly over wood without an oil-based primer. If you have a stucco exte-
rior, acrylic latex may be a good option because the stucco acts as its
own sealer.
If you’re looking to have specifically designed colors throughout the house,
or are considering murals or faux finishes, you may need the help of a
designer before engaging your painting sub. If you want to make the decorat-
ing decisions when everything else is done, you can have your painting sub
finish everything in white for now; however, you’ll find it much cheaper and
easier to have all your painting done (including the custom work) before you
finish flooring and move in furniture.
Hardware and fixtures
People take for granted all the hardware and fixtures that must be installed
after everything else is put together. In Chapter 5 we spell out all the hardware
and fixtures to choose for your home; now, during the finishing process, is the
time for your subs to put them in their permanent place. Here’s a to-do list for
your hardware and fixtures. Some of these you may want to do yourself.
269
Chapter 14: Heading for the Finish: So Much Detail

 Install hinges on all doors.
 Install doorknobs on all interior doors.
 Install matching deadbolt and lockset on front and back doors.
 Install light switch and electrical cover plates.
 Install all lighting fixtures and ceiling fans.
 Secure and attach thermostats and alarm controls.
 Install all exhaust fans.
 Install toilets and toilet roll holders.
 Install towel racks and soap dishes.
 Install medicine cabinets and mirrors.
 Install shower rods and doors.
 Install faucets and connect stoppers.
 Install window locks.
 Install doorbell.
 Install door knocker.
 Attach all cabinet knobs and appliance knobs.
If you’re installing lighting fixtures yourself, be sure that the circuit breakers
have been shut off first. This installation is simple because most light fixtures
come with clearly marked wires and printed instructions. Be sure to use only
recommended wattages because creating an over-wattage lighting system
can generate excess heat and even cause a fire. At the very least, it will cost
you more money on your monthly energy bills.
Flooring materials
You made choices about your flooring materials in Chapter 5 and, by now,
you have ordered your materials and they’re ready to install. For you do-
it-yourselfers, flooring installation is a task where you may want to have
some fun. Decide with your contractor and flooring sub how you might par-
ticipate in the process.
Install the flooring after the painting has been finished. Before any flooring is
laid, however, your contractor makes sure the job site has been cleaned with
set traffic pathways to avoid dirtying the new floors. To prepare for flooring
installation, the subfloors should be cleaned of any rough spots or plaster.
Depending on the type of flooring and location of the subfloor, your sub may
install a waterproof vapor barrier. Here are some insights on installing
common flooring materials.
270
Part III: Hammers and Nails: The Construction Process 

Wood and laminate
Many people love the natural beauty of wood floors, and the installation
process is fortunately relatively simple. Your flooring sub will move briskly
through the process.
Your flooring sub first measures and cuts straight planks, and then either
glues or nails them into place — or both. Tongue-and-groove flooring gets its
name from the protruding wood on one side of the board that fits into the
slot on the other side of the board. If you’re using this type of flooring, your
flooring sub insets piece by piece and allows 1⁄4-inch space alongside walls to
allow for moisture expansion. If you’re using parquet flooring (flooring with an
inlaid design), the flooring sub usually lays it down in 6-inch squares, which
allows for the same breathing room.
To avoid major headaches, subs will try not to lay hardwood floors in humid
weather, which can create gaps in the boards when the weather dries out and
the flooring contracts. Most contractors have the flooring delivered to the
house a few weeks early to give it time to dry out. You can then store the
flooring in the actual rooms in which it will be laid to let the moisture content
stabilize. After the flooring has been laid, sanding may be required before its
final finish.
Laminate floors like Pergo and WilsonArt have gained popularity due to their
ease of installation, their durability, and their versatility of style. Some are
completely waterproof and have lifetime guarantees, and some are amazingly
accurate in their representations of wood and stone materials. Many laminate

A bright idea
Most people think Thomas Edison was the 
first inventor of the electric light. Actually, he
was the 23rd inventor of the electric light. Sir
Humphrey Davy actually invented the arc lamp
in 1811 and Sir Joseph Wilson Swan had
already constructed a glowing bulb in the 
mid 1800s. But that bulb had no vacuum and
couldn’t be sustained. Edison actually is
charged with producing the first vacuum bulb
that could sustain light and be mass produced.
But this was only the spark for Mr. Edison’s real
contributions.
Because gas lamps were the order of the day,
houses weren’t rigged for any electrical appli-
ances. Therefore Edison could only sell light
bulbs by creating the sockets, wiring, plugs, and
whole electrical infrastructure necessary to
bring power into the home. (This is why stan-
dard two pronged plugs are referred to as
Edison plugs.) The need to sell his many inven-
tions led to the creation of his power companies
and electrical supplies company. This firm was
originally known as Edison General Electric and
today is known as General Electric. Of the orig-
inal 12 members of the Dow Jones, only GE has
survived to this day. You can even thank Mr.
Edison for an invention that makes you cringe
every month, the electric bill. For more interest-
ing info on Thomas Edison, check out the Edison
Preservation Foundation at www.edisonpf.
org.

floor products are available today for do-it-yourselfers. The material the man-
ufacturer is imitating (wood or slate, for example) determines the size and
shape of the panels. Most stone imitations are square, while the wood may
imitate planking. Panels are generally designed to interlock and can be
applied with glue directly to the slab or subfloor.
Vinyl
Like laminates, vinyl floors have great versatility of style and durability. Vinyl
floors can come in rolls or squares and are very easy to install. If you’re
installing the floor yourself, make sure you have planned out your patterns so
they make sense with the angles of walls and placement of doorways. Also,
be sure to follow specific directions supplied with the flooring so you don’t
void the manufacturer’s warranties. Vinyl floors are generally installed using
a special adhesive made specifically for this purpose, although some prod-
ucts may be nailed in place or may even be self-adhesive.
Tile
Tile flooring can be beautiful if done right, but it takes talent — and a lot of
patience. You seriously need to consider your craftsmanship skills before
embarking on a tile mission yourself. If you have any reservations, then by all
means use a pro.
Tile first needs to be properly cut and spaced when being applied. After you
approve the pattern design, the sub applies a thick sticky glue, sometimes to
a special, inflexible concrete-impregnated surface called Wonderboard (used
to firm up a flexible wood floor). The sub then sets the tiles in place with
small plastic spacers to fix their position. After the tiles are secure, the sub
fills the space in between the tile with a gritty colored material called grout.
Darker colors of grout show dirt more than lighter colors, so be sure to dis-
cuss the color options with your tile sub. Your tile sub may recommend a
sealer to protect the grout and make it easier to clean.
Carpet
Carpeting may also not be the best job for doing yourself — chances are that
a professional will do a much better job. Something to remember: Buy the
best padding you can afford. It keeps your carpet feeling good and helps it
last longer.
Carpet is sold in 12-foot-wide rolls. To save money when carpeting small
areas, ask about remnants (pieces left over from large carpeting jobs, sold at
a discount). Carpet is stretched upon installation by attaching it at the walls
to a wood strip filled with tacks called a stretcher strip. After a few months, it
may need to be stretched again. Make sure your carpet company arranges for
this without an additional charge.

Appliances
Some of your appliances will be built-in appliances as opposed to free-standing
and should be installed at the same time as your cabinets. The free-standing
appliances can wait until all the painting is finished and flooring is installed.
Spend time with your contractor — at your regular meetings we discuss in
Chapter 11 — to determine the proper time for delivery and installation of
the appliances. Having them delivered too early risks damage and can create
obstacles to work around. Having them delivered too late can delay your
move-in schedule, or worse, the completion of your construction loan. Make
sure upon delivery that the measurements are as specified in your building
plans.
Spot-check — Painting, fixtures,
flooring, and appliances
Time to check all the detail work. Don’t forget: This phase makes or breaks
your project. Take the time to look over the detail work in detail! You need a
tape measure and flashlight.
❑All ceilings and walls are uniform in color with no brushstrokes or dried
paint drips.
❑Trim is painted with gloss or semigloss and is clean of bleed-over on
walls or window glass.
❑All hardware and fixtures are in place and secure. Knobs are tight and
uniform.
❑No carpet seams or gaps are visible. Vinyl flooring is bubble-free.
❑Wood flooring is stained evenly with no visible scratches or nicks.
❑Tiles are secure and evenly spaced with grout running parallel and per-
pendicular to walls. Tiles aren’t chipped and colors are consistent.
❑All necessary door thresholds are installed and secure. Doors are at
proper height with no more than 1⁄4-inch gap under interior doors.
❑All appliances are securely fastened and plugged in. Gas and water con-
nections are checked for leaks.
Discuss any discrepancies with your contractor and determine a solution.

ongratulations! Where once was bare land now sits your beautiful
custom home! All the construction workers have done their job, and
you’ve seen all your dreams come to life. Your home may have cost a bit
more than you expected. It may have taken a little longer than you thought,
as well. But chances are it was worth every dime and minute spent — at least
we hope so! However, the project isn’t quite finished. You now need to wrap
up the loose ends.
In this chapter we walk through the last details of dealing with permits and
getting ready for your move-in. We examine the issue of repairs and contrac-
tor warranties and discuss the pros and cons of staying in your new house.
Finishing Up the Custom Home Project
The process of finishing your new home is a combination of action and
paperwork. Of course, you need the house to be ready for you and your
loved ones to inhabit, but it also needs to be ready for the bank as well as the
city or county. Unless you chose to be your own contractor as discussed in
Chapter 1, you’ll heavily rely on your contractor to help you through this
final process.

Getting your certificate of occupancy
Obtaining your certificate of occupancy (C of O) is the first step to finishing
your house. City and/or county building inspectors have been visiting your
property regularly to inspect and sign off on the foundation, electrical,
plumbing, and other key components. (If you want to know more specifics
about the inspection process, check out Chapters 6 and 11.) When the house
is nearly finished, the building inspector will come out for the final inspec-
tion. In most areas, the inspector isn’t concerned with minor deficiencies in
workmanship, quality, or cosmetic issues such as paint, flooring, or window
covering. He is focused on making sure that the house meets all the struc-
tural and safety guidelines required by the local building code.
The contractor generally calls for this final inspection a few days in advance
of being ready. Take the opportunity to walk the house with the contractor the
day before the building inspector arrives. Have the contractor explain and
show you all the items the building inspector will be looking at. This informa-
tion can give you the chance to clearly understand the process and check up
one last time on the contractor’s work. If you see any defects, this is a good
chance to point them out so the contractor can have the subs fix them.
After the inspector reviews the house and is satisfied that it meets all local
building codes and requirements, he files the approval with the county or
city. The building inspector’s signature of approval allows the building
department to issue the C of O. This document allows you to move in and will
be critical for other parties, such as your bank and the tax assessor. It means
that your house officially and legally exists.
If the inspector decides the house isn’t finished, you have two options:
 You can wait until the contractor performs all necessary tasks to meet
the final inspection.
 You can have the inspector issue a temporary C of O allowing you to live
in the house while the necessary tasks are completed. (A temporary C of
O can be beneficial if you’ve already sold your original home and sched-
uled moving trucks and utilities.) This option may not be available in
every area of the country; check with your local building department.
We discuss the moving process in the “Selling the Old Home and Moving” sec-
tion, later in this chapter. In either case, the building inspector has to come
back to the house to inspect all the work.
Obtaining the mechanic’s lien releases
After the C of O is in hand, you need to wrap up all the house’s financial
details. As we discuss in Chapter 11, all workmen have the right to attach
278
Part IV: All the After Stuff 

liens — legally enforceable financial claims — to the property if they aren’t
paid for their services. Many of your suppliers and subs will have issued 
preliminary filings, which put everyone on notice that work has been done 
or materials have been delivered to the property. Preliminary filings — which
allow the contractor and subs to file their mechanic’s liens instantly if you
don’t pay them — have been happening during the entire construction
period. In order to eliminate the risk of these preliminary filings turning to
mechanic’s liens, you need to obtain a lien release from each and every sub
and supplier as well as your contractor. They’ll only issue the release if
everything has been paid for accordingly.
The best way to handle lien releases is to collect them as you move through
the process. If the contractor has been collecting them, make sure she pro-
vides you copies along the way. Keep careful files so you have the lien
releases immediately available when needed.
Mechanic’s liens can be problematic for your loan and your finances. Our
experience: Don’t dispute contractors or subs by withholding their funds.
Pay them if possible and sue them after the fact. Doing so allows you to clear
the title on the property and resolve the disputes independently.
Rolling the construction loan — Choosing
a final loan amount and program
Time to finish up the financial issues. Most likely, after reading Chapter 8, you
chose a single-close, all-in-one construction loan and are ready to roll it to a
permanent mortgage. This type of loan requires a certain amount of paper-
work to get the lender moving on the conversion process. Here are the items
your lender will need to start the rollover:
 Final draw request: Your lender probably set aside 10 percent of the
funds in the loan until everything was finished. You can now request the
money. For more information on how the draw system works, read
Chapter 10.
 Final lender inspection: After you have requested the last of the money,
your lender will want the inspector to come out and make sure the work
has been done according to plan. Be aware that the building inspectors
aren’t looking at the work quality. See Chapter 11 for more details.
 Copy of recorded C of O: We discuss the certificate of occupancy in
“Getting your certificate of occupancy,” earlier in this chapter. The
lender doesn’t finish the loan without it.
 Lien releases: The lender’s security is at risk until all contractors and
subs are paid and have released the property. You need everyone to sign
a release.
279
Chapter 15: Moving In and Managing Your New Investment

 Verification from the title company: The property is the only guarantee
the lender has in case you default. Your lender wants the title company
to reaffirm that the property is still yours and that no other liens or
restrictions take precedence over the loan.
 Evidence of insurance: Now that you have a home, you need to obtain a
homeowner’s policy. Call your insurance agent and tell him you need a
policy covering replacement value for the improvements.
As soon as you’ve collected all these items and given them to the lender, you
may have the option of changing loan programs or changing your interest
rates — of course depending on your lender and the loan program you
selected. (Check out Chapter 8 for more details on these choices.)
If the final terms of the loan are insufficient for your needs or if you’re rolling
from a straight construction loan, you still need all these items to pay off 
the construction lender. Furthermore, you also need to find a lender for a 
refinance. We address the details of this process in Chapter 16.
Taking the Final Contractor 
Walk-Through
The C of O is in, and you’re wrapping up your lender’s requirements. Make
sure the house is finished to your liking and the contractor is finished when
you take the final walk-through.
A custom home is a huge project with many parts. Only in rare cases is
everything done absolutely perfectly the first time. Ideally, you have been
communicating with your contractor regularly and spot-checking along the
way. We provide you with spot-check lists in Part III exactly for this purpose.
Now take the time for the final walk-through.
Make sure you have plenty of time and a flashlight because you and your con-
tractor are going to go through every detail in the house. Along the way you
and the contractor write down every imperfection to be fixed. This list is
called a punch list. Don’t feel rushed during this important part of the build-
ing process; plan for several hours of sniffing and snooping. Look above,
below, and behind everywhere you and your flashlight can reach. Have the
contractor sign the punch list at the end of the inspection. (If you do notice
issues, check out “The builder’s long-term responsibilities and warranties,”
later in this chapter, about how to get them fixed.)
You’ll hear many people advise you to withhold funds from the contractor if
he isn’t performing to the standards you require. Unless you have agreed in
the contract to withhold some funds until the punch list is complete, Kevin
suggests, based upon the many projects he has witnessed, to not use the
280
Part IV: All the After Stuff 

money as a lever against the contractor. Most contractors run on slim 
margins and if they file a mechanic’s lien, it can cause considerable hardship
for your project especially if you have a construction loan. Kevin says the
best way to handle the situation is to keep communication open and friendly,
resorting to legal action only when absolutely necessary. If the contractor is
truly in the wrong, the legal system will force the contractor to cure the prob-
lem, and you should be able to recoup your legal costs. Rarely has Kevin seen
conflicts go to the point of lawsuits because contractors have their license
and livelihoods on the line. We discuss preventative measures for these situa-
tions in Chapter 11.
The contractor needs to arrange for all the repairs on the punch list to be
made in a reasonable time frame. He works to have the serious and messy
repairs done before move-in, but you may have repairs being done for some
time after you’ve moved into the house. The contractor may have to order
materials or work with subs’ schedules to get the work done.
Selling the Old Home and Moving
The most important issue with selling your old house is the timing. Gauging
exactly when the new house will be finished and ready for you to move in is
difficult. At the same time, market conditions fluctuate, which can affect find-
ing the right time to sell. The ultimate goal is to have as little time as possible
where you’re carrying mortgage payments on two houses. You also don’t
want to be too quick on the draw, where you take an overly low price.
Furthermore, if you sell the home too early, you could have no place to live
or have to pay for storage and a double move.
Our advice is to carefully watch the market and discuss the options with your
real estate agent. If you aren’t using a real estate agent, you’ll have to assess
the market yourself by talking to real estate agents. Find out specifically how
long it will take to sell and close your home. Build contingency plans for rent-
ing out the house if necessary. Chapter 7 describes how to use your cash
resources to resolve any cash-flow issues in the beginning, leaving you the
relaxed atmosphere to take advantage of the right sales opportunity.
Meanwhile, stay in constant communication with your contractor as to when
he thinks the house will be ready for move-in. In our experience, you must
add two weeks to this date just to be safe. The worst case is that you’ll have
an extra two weeks to make the move. The alternative could get ugly.
The moving process itself can be long and complicated if you’re doing it your-
self, which is why so many people opt for movers. When moving to a custom
home, you have the benefits of time and knowing what the house will look
like. This advance notice beats finding a house and moving in 60 days, the
typical time it takes to close a deal for purchasing an existing home. The Web
has great resources for movers and moving tips. Try www.move.com or www.
281
Chapter 15: Moving In and Managing Your New Investment

uhaul.com. Aside from all the general moving tips available today on the
Internet, the following list includes some of our suggestions for making a
smoother move to a custom home:
 Use the floor plan. Take advantage of your plans. You can make cutouts
to scale of all your existing furniture. Doing so can tell you where every-
thing fits and allow you to weed out all the stuff that doesn’t belong.
 Do some advance decorating. As you see the house come together, you
should already be thinking about colors and decorations. After you have
a sense of the rooms, you can assess the items in your current home
that will stay or go.
 Use pictures to see if items belong. Chances are that you’ll buy a lot of
new stuff for this house. You can start early and get measurements as
well as photos from the retailers or the Internet. Try and have deliveries
set up for a time just after the move.
 Rent a dumpster. Most of Kevin’s clients start almost from scratch when
decorating their new home. We can think of nothing worse than paying
to move something and then paying again to have it hauled away. Be
very selective in what you keep and get rid of everything else.
 Have plenty of garage sales. We can’t think of a better way to raise capi-
tal for all the new furniture you’ll likely buy. And there’s nothing like the
feeling of a big wad of cash in your pocket at the end of the day.
Managing Maintenance and Repairs
When building your new home, you probably hoped that it would require 
a minimum of repairs and ongoing maintenance. Think again! For example, 
compare it to manufacturing a car. The most reliable cars are ones built with
robotic factory precision. The bugs have been worked out after years of manu-
facturing thousands of copies of the same vehicle over and over.
Keeping with this analogy and comparing it to your house, your house isn’t
factory made. Your new home is like an expensive custom car. The compo-
nents have been picked one by one, and they have been handcrafted together
to give amazing performance and luxury in state-of-the-art surroundings.
Ideally, everything stays carefully tuned, but chances are you’ll encounter
some minor glitches in the first couple of years or so.
All the equipment and appliances have warranties, and the contractor guar-
antees her work for a period of time that varies from state to state. Make sure
the contractor gives you all the manuals and registration certificates for the
appliances and fixtures. Catalog them and store copies in a place away from
the house in case of flood or fire when you’ll definitely need the information.
You can catalog and easily access many registrations online.
282
Part IV: All the After Stuff 

The builder’s long-term responsibilities 
and warranties
Contractor warranty policies vary from state to state. A typical ten-year war-
ranty covers structural defects for ten years, as well as construction materi-
als and defects for the first year and major mechanical systems for the
second. After you get past ten years, any problems are going to be yours
unless they boil down to significant engineering issues or outright fraud.
Discuss with your contractor the full details of his warranty, including who
covers the work if he goes out of business. Have him walk you through sug-
gested maintenance procedures for keeping the house in working order.
Dealing with construction defects
Okay, so not every contractor is perfect, and your house may have some acci-
dental (or in rare cases, intentional) defects in workmanship. Sometimes you
don’t catch these defects in the final walk-through. In fact, they may not show
up for years. A perfect example is a cracked foundation that doesn’t become
apparent until years after the home is completed, or drainage or roofing
issues that don’t materialize until the first big rain. These types of construc-
tion defects are a big nightmare for the homeowner, and resenting the con-
tractor for his negligence is only natural.
Do yourself a favor. Take it slow. If you find yourself in a construction-defects
situation, you don’t want to escalate things unnecessarily. Remember that
your objective is to solve the problem with the least hassle and expense.
Even though ultimately you may win a war with the contractor, it could come
at the expense of costly emotional and financial battles. Often the contrac-
tor’s contract covers issues of this nature. Make sure you discuss these
issues when you’re hiring the contractor (see Chapter 11). Don’t worry if the
discussion got missed somehow; you can work out disputes amicably by fol-
lowing this path:
1. Talk to the contractor calmly.
Have the contractor come out to the house and see the problem first-
hand. Discuss how it could have happened. You may need to involve the
architect and engineer if the problem is significantly structural in nature.
Keep discussions calm and cool in determining how to remedy the situa-
tion. Most contractors want to find a way to solve the problem. They
want to protect their licenses and their livelihoods. If you have picked a
contractor with a good reputation, chances are he’ll want to keep it that
way. On the other hand, if you aren’t getting anyone to step up for
repairs or they’re all playing the blame game, go to Step 2.
283
Chapter 15: Moving In and Managing Your New Investment

2. Get an outside opinion.
Getting an outside opinion isn’t cheap, so keep track of your expenses.
You want to hire an expert in the field in question. If the issue is cos-
metic, such as the cabinets, bring in a finish carpenter. For structural
issues, hire a structural engineer. Be prepared to spend a few hundred
dollars to get an expert opinion for submission in court if necessary.
Make sure that the expert is willing to testify if necessary. Get two inde-
pendent opinions if possible. Doing so may cost you twice as much, but
it’ll give you a better case. Make sure you get two or three outside esti-
mates for curing the problem as well.
3. Suggest mediation.
Contact all the pertinent parties. Arrange a meeting at the house where
everyone can once again see the problem. Show the independent reports
and estimates to your contractor, architect, and engineer, if involved. Take
the time for negotiation. You may get lucky, and your contractor may agree
to fix the problem at no cost to you. If so, make sure you get it in writing
just like any other contract for work, complete with the time frame and a
statement that the work won’t be at any additional cost to you. Even if
the contractor suggests some cost to you in the process of negotiation,
consider this cost against the expense of an upfront attorney and pro-
tracted litigation. Make sure you point these issues out to the contractor
and subs, if involved, as well. If they still don’t budge, move to Step 4.
4. Get an attorney.
Okay, last resort time. Time to do battle. The big mistake in this step is
picking the wrong attorney. Stay away from general practitioners who
dabble around in various aspects of law. Your family attorney may be
fine for small liability and estate stuff, but the laws on construction
defects are very specific. Kevin once saw a well-meaning attorney negoti-
ate his client into a series of bad compromises leading to hundreds of
thousands of dollars in losses, all because he didn’t know the field.
Unfortunately, most attorneys don’t know when to say no if they think
someone has been wronged, and they end up making matters worse.
Bottom line: Find a specialist in construction defects and be prepared to
spend two to three years and $20,000 to $30,000 in legal costs before you
can get satisfaction from the courts or a settlement. If the builder remains
solvent, you should be able to recoup your legal costs as well.
Should You Stay or Should You Go?
You have gone through all this pain and hardship to build your new home
and it’s finally done. You have moved in, landscaped, and decorated. (We
hope you referenced Wiley’s Home Decorating For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by
Katharine Kaye McMillan and Patricia Hart McMillan.) You can now take a
deep breath and relax.
284
Part IV: All the After Stuff 

Who in their right mind would even think about moving now? You’d be sur-
prised. For many people, the project and process part is more fun than the
actual living in the house part. Many people also gain financial appreciation
in the process and have the opportunity to walk away with a nice bit of
money. Sometimes work-related issues can force a relocation. For whatever
reason, you need to consider certain issues related to selling a custom home.
Being aware of neighborhood trends
Finding the right time to sell in a custom home neighborhood can be a little
tricky. Remember that neighborhoods are designed to mature in 25 years.
When you sell in a new neighborhood, you’re selling a home to someone that
wants to live in an undeveloped neighborhood with no mature foliage and
plenty of construction going on. Potential buyers may be limited because
many of the people wanting a custom home may prefer to simply buy a lot
and build their own dream. Consider some of these issues with new develop-
ments when pricing your home:
 Spec homes can set the price. In most custom home developments, con-
tractors are building homes for sale. These homes are called spec
homes. If these homes match the quality of your custom home, then
you’re fine provided they aren’t selling them at lowball prices. If they’re
building at less quality and lower prices, you may have difficulty recoup-
ing your home’s expenses.
 Too many undeveloped lots can scare buyers off. Many resort area
developments sell their land to dreamers who never build. The develop-
ers don’t care because they want to sell the land for the profit.
Developments with no building going on can be unattractive because
most people want to live in a neighborhood. It can sometimes take
decades for these developments to get production going.
 You may be competing against the sales office. If you’re an early
builder in your development, the sales office is still in place and working
steadily on commission. Unless you’re bound to list with them — which
sometimes happens in new developments — the aggressive sales agents
will be working hard to sell buyers on new land or spec listings held by
the office. Of course they won’t admit it, but they’ll see any buyer inter-
ested in your finished house as a lost sale in their territory.
You need to assess these elements when deciding on the right time to market
your house. If the market is hot, you probably won’t have a problem. However,
a lukewarm market could have you sitting for a long time or taking an unattrac-
tive price. Work with a local real estate agent to assess the marketplace. If you
determine that it’s not the right time to sell, then the worst is you can enjoy
the new home you put so much love into.
285
Chapter 15: Moving In and Managing Your New Investment

Two-year capital gains tax implications
The government doesn’t often create tax laws that benefit you, but the capi-
tal gains law is one of those rarities. (Perhaps the legislators enacted the law
because they own real estate.) When your home appreciates, the money it
makes is considered capital gains by the government. The IRS allows you to
make capital gains on your primary residence tax-free with a couple of limita-
tions. Most states follow the same rules. Each person is entitled to free capi-
tal gains up to $250,000. Here are the rules:
 You must have lived in the house two out of the last five years.
 Couples can take up to $500,000 together.
 You can only do it once in any given two-year period.
 The two-year period starts the day you move in.
With these rules, you can make a hefty amount of tax-free money simply by
building homes and selling them every few years. Many of Kevin’s clients have
used it as a successful strategy for making tax-free income. They build a house
and move in for two years or until they reach the $500,000 couple limit. When
they know the property is close to its appreciation limit, the couple buys
another lot and starts building. When they sell, they get all the gain on the
first house tax-free. Even if it takes five years to hit the $500,000 couple limit,
that still equals $100,000 a year in tax-free income. Not bad in anyone’s book.
If you reach your limit on capital gains and choose to stay, you’ll pay capital
gains taxes on the difference at current tax rates, which can be as high as 40
percent in some states. Sit down with your accountant or tax advisor and dis-
cuss your options. Getting the facts on paper is the best way to avoid making
costly emotional decisions.
286
Part IV: All the After Stuff 
Do your buyer a favor
If you do sell your house, make everything easy
for the new buyer to transition in. Because he
didn’t go through the construction process, he
doesn’t know the house like you do. Here is a
checklist of items to have ready for him:
❑A full set of plans
❑Copies of soils and engineering reports
❑Copies of all inspection records
❑Copies of all manuals and registrations for
appliances and fixtures
❑Copies of any applicable transferable war-
ranties from the architect and contractor
❑Names and addresses for the architect,
contractor, and major subs
❑Specific instructions on any idiosyncrasies
for working features of the house
Accumulating and giving these documents to a
buyer may seem like a lot of work, but having
these items available can make the sale go
faster and reduce the chance of late-night
panic calls to your home after the homeowners
have moved in.

Refinancing: More Money,
Cheaper Payments
In This Chapter
 Deciding if another loan is necessary
 Educating yourself on the refinance process
 Choosing from today’s mortgage programs
 Paying off your home: Yes or no?
You may think that after all you’ve been through that the financing part of
your project would be finished by now. Not so fast. You aren’t done yet!
Just because you’ve already secured the financing for your custom home
doesn’t mean that you can file it away and forget about it — not by a long
shot. In fact, you need to determine whether to keep the permanent loan that
you secured after your construction financing or consider a refinance.
Most people take the path of least resistance when dealing with mortgages,
which is a mistake. By taking the path of least resistance, they avoid making
decisions that end up costing themselves tens of thousands of dollars. This
chapter summarizes more than 20 years’ expertise in helping people avoid
making mistakes with their financing choices. For even more information on
maximizing your financing and an in-depth explanation of the refinance
process, we suggest Kevin’s book, What the Banks Won’t Tell You: How to Get
the Most out of Your Mortgage (Grady Parsons Publishing).
You Still May Want Another Loan
You’d be surprised at how many people refinance their mortgages within one
year of finishing their custom home’s construction. Even though many con-
struction loans come with long-term financing already in place, lives change
and unexpected opportunities appear. Wanting more cash, making life
changes, or simply working toward smaller monthly payments can all be
excellent reasons for re-examining the financing process.

Filling the need for more cash
We’re certain that your project’s financials went exactly as you planned when
you started your project, right? Surely you didn’t have any cost overruns or
added expenses or underestimations. What? You did? What a surprise!
We’re going to take a wild guess that building your own home left your sav-
ings account a little less flush with cash. If so, then you may want to replen-
ish your bank account by considering a new loan or a refinance of your
current loan.
And, even if you still have some cash in the bank, you may not be finished
spending yet. You probably still have landscaping costs ahead including
lawns, trees, and shrubs. You may even have plans to add a deck, pool, spa,
or perhaps even a gazebo. And don’t forget that you’ll need curtains, decora-
tions, and, oh yes, furniture.
Some of this money may come from the sale of your existing home. But if you
don’t have another home to sell or any extra funds in savings, refinancing is
another way to obtain the necessary cash. (Don’t consider dipping into your
retirement funds if you can possibly avoid it because you may have to pay
any deferred taxes as well as penalties for early withdrawal.)
When you’re thinking about raising cash by taking a new loan or refinancing,
remember to manage your money wisely. Taking cash out to invest wisely 
(on improving your property, on buying stocks or securities, or on paying
down credit card debt) can be wonderfully rewarding. Taking cash out to
spend irresponsibly (on an expensive vacation, on a luxury car, or on a
snazzy new home-entertainment system) only brings you one step closer to
financial ruin — putting your new home in jeopardy.
Reconsidering how long you will stay
Another reason to consider a refinance is directly related to the term — that
is, the duration — of the loan you received at the end of construction. If your
construction loan was a single-close loan (discussed in Chapter 8), then you
may or may not have had a choice in the type of loan that replaced your con-
struction loan when your home was finished.
If the final loan was attached to the construction loan, you may find that the
choice you made a year ago when starting the project was based on a whole
set of assumptions that have since changed. Maybe you thought you would
live in your new home forever. Or maybe you thought you would never lose
your job or never get a divorce. Lives change, and you may now have the
opportunity to move to a better neighborhood or take a new job. In this case,
analyze the available loan programs to determine if the loan you have right
now is the loan you’ll need to achieve your long-term goals.
288
Part IV: All the After Stuff 

Lowering your payments
Interest rates constantly change, and new kinds of loan programs — meant to
attract new customers — are always becoming available. Because you had
little control over the economy when you started your project or when it
ended (unless you happened to be the president of the United States or the
prime minister of Great Britain), interest rates may have improved since you
locked in your permanent loan. And, even if fixed rates aren’t particularly
attractive at any given time, the adjustable-rate mortgages and interest-only
loans that we explain in the “Interest-only options” section, later in this chap-
ter, may offer you opportunities to lower your payments significantly.
Take our advice: Now that you know what the house actually cost (ouch!) —
and the real state of your finances after completion (double ouch!) — consider
a change in your financing strategy that allows you to increase your personal
monthly cash flow by lowering your loan payment. With the help of your
accountant and a good loan officer, assessing your finances and options 
regularly can save you money and bring peace of mind.
Three Things You Should Know 
About Refinancing
Okay, so you actually need to know more than just three things about refi-
nancing. But the three key points in this section really deserve your utmost
attention. For all the rest of the information that you need to know, we highly
recommend Mortgages For Dummies by Eric Tyson and Ray Brown (Wiley).
The information that follows can give you the basic understanding and per-
spective necessary to make the most of your loan opportunities.
You aren’t the bank’s customer
You probably think that you’re the bank’s customer after all the money you
just paid in interest and points. Guess what? That’s not the way the bank sees
it. Large banks actually see very little money from the interest and points on
the residential loans they make, making you a small fish in a very big pond.
Here’s an insider’s picture of how the system works:
 After funding the loan, banks sell most mortgages to investors (the banks’
true customers) within 30 days of funding (the date a check is cut to the
borrower).
289
Chapter 16: Refinancing: More Money, Cheaper Payments

 Except for the rare case where banks put loans in their own investment
portfolios, they make their money on the difference between the rate
you pay and the rate required by the investor.
 The banks continue to manage your monthly mortgage payments —
sending you monthly bills and processing your payments, and the
investor pays the bank a quarter percent annually for this service called
a servicing fee.
Because your bank handles most payments in an automated fashion, servic-
ing a $300,000 loan earns the bank $750 at a cost of less than $50. Not bad,
huh? A billion-dollar servicing portfolio can yield $2.5 million annually. The
90-percent profit margin draws the bank’s customer focus.
Don’t be fooled by the warm personal relationship you may have with a bank
as a depositor for your personal and business accounts. For most banks, the
mortgage division is completely separate. Unless you’re a seven-figure depos-
itor, you probably won’t see any favoritism on your mortgage experience
because the bank will likely sell your loan to an investor that doesn’t know
you from Adam.
Your bank mostly sees you as a necessary risk and costly annoyance
required to make their servicing fees. This annoyance is one of the main rea-
sons why many banks seem so difficult to deal with during the application
and underwriting process. The banks are very well aware that they don’t
treat you well, but there’s little financial incentive for them to do anything dif-
ferent. Because they see no profit from originating loans, they actually prefer
to pay outside mortgage brokers more than $5,000 on a $300,000 loan just to
avoid contact with you. Nothing personal, but this approach has been so suc-
cessful for them that two out of three mortgages in the United States are now
originated by brokers.

Part IV: All the After Stuff 
Your friends Fannie and Freddie
As the Great Depression wore on, President
Franklin D. Roosevelt realized that the home-
buying economy needed to be stimulated. The
banks’ collapses caused a shortage of funds to
loan for home purchases. Roosevelt and the
Federal U.S. government created the Federal
National Mortgage Association in 1938, referred
to as FNMA or Fannie Mae for short. The 
purpose of Fannie Mae was to buy mortgages
from lenders, thereby replenishing the market
with more money to loan. In 1970, Congress
established the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (FHLMC) now called Freddie Mac.
Both of these publicly held corporations are
Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSE) with
charters focused on keeping home loan money
abundant and interest rates low. These institu-
tions buy a significant number of mortgages
called conforming loans and make financing
easier and more cost effective for everyone.

The banks view new custom homes 
differently than existing homes
Many banks have a different set of criteria for calculating the amount you can
borrow on a new custom home compared to an existing property. With a con-
ventional refinance, the bank generally loans you money based upon the
property’s current market value. If you bought the house within the last year,
chances are that your bank will use the sales price to determine that value.
This time frame is known as seasoning. Banks generally frown upon the idea
of letting you take out cash when your house isn’t seasoned unless the loan-
to-value ratio (the amount of the loan divided by the house’s value) is signifi-
cantly low enough to meet their standards.
A similar seasoning requirement may occur when refinancing a new custom
home. Most banks don’t consider the home seasoned until one year from
issuance of its certificate of occupancy, the final project approval issued by
your local building department. But, because the bank has no sales price to
consider, it may require complete documentation of the home’s construction
costs to determine its value. Each bank uses a different formula to come up
with this number; some allow for the land’s market value while others use the
original purchase price. Ultimately, the bank comes up with a calculation of
the project’s cost — representing its value — and dictates the loan amount
based upon a percentage of that cost.
For example, if the total project cost based upon your documentation and
receipts equals $600,000, and the bank is only willing to loan up to 75 percent
of that amount, then the most you can borrow is $450,000 — even if the prop-
erty may now appraise for more. If the property appraises for less than your
cost documentation supports, however, then the bank uses the lower of the
two numbers.
Rates and fees are only 
part of the big picture
In our many years of experience working with loans for custom home con-
struction, we have noticed that the vast majority of people start the refinanc-
ing process by first asking about rates and fees. Don’t make this mistake.
Although rates and fees are an important element in the big picture, they
aren’t everything. In order to get the most from a mortgage, you first need to
seriously assess your own unique financial needs. The loan you select is
guaranteed to have a major impact — either positive or negative — on the
entirety of your financial health. If you want to avoid financial problems, then
be sure you pick the loan that is right for you.
291
Chapter 16: Refinancing: More Money, Cheaper Payments

Use the following questions to explore with your accountant, financial advi-
sor, tax preparer, and loan officer before hitting the low-rate sites on the
Internet:
 Do you have an appropriate amount of liquidity (readily available cash)?
 Are you making the right choices for your tax situation?
 Are your investments properly diversified?
 What does your cash flow really look like?
 What is your retirement strategy? (Do you have a retirement strategy?)
Your mortgage is usually connected to your largest asset, your biggest pay-
ment, and your greatest liability. To sleep well, seek the proper professional
financial advice and act on it. Believe us — we’ve seen enough examples of
people who haven’t sought out the right professional financial advice to write
an entire book just on bad loans. And that is one book you don’t want to be in!
Picking the Right Mortgage Program
Before considering which mortgage program is right for you, you should have
first consulted with financial planning experts and determined your financial
needs as well as your long-range goals regarding your custom home and
lifestyle choices. At least we hope you have. (If not, please don’t pass Go or
collect $200 until you do.) Okay, ready? This section includes a brief explana-
tion of many popular loan choices available in today’s market.
A mediocre loan officer 
can cost you big time
Most people are used to salespeople focused on giving them what they want.
That’s their job, right? But, with mortgages, the old saying “the customer is
always right” doesn’t necessarily apply. When dealing with financing, your
needs are far more important than your wants. What you need is straight
education. Here’s a secret: Even with a so-called zero-point/zero-fee loan, you
are paying thousands of dollars to work with a loan officer. Remember: The
loan officer is responsible for bringing you her experience, knowledge, under-
standing, and education so that you can make intelligent, educated decisions
about what is in your own best financial interest. Choose your loan provider
carefully and do your own homework. A loan officer that tells you only what
you want to hear — not what you need to hear — could very well cost you
tens of thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.
292
Part IV: All the After Stuff 

Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs)
Many banks offer home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) as a second mortgage,
that is, as a separate mortgage in addition to your primary home mortgage.
HELOCs are effectively giant credit cards secured (guaranteed) by your home.
Do you want to know the one main difference between a home equity line of
credit and your credit cards? If you default on your credit cards, you get bad
marks on your credit report. If you default on your loan, then the lender gets
to keep your home. Some people feel that a HELOC is particularly advanta-
geous because you can pay back the equity and you only pay interest on
what you use.
Few people actually repay these loans. Most HELOCs are on a variable rate
with few restrictions for only a ten-year period. If you take the money, you’ll
most likely have to refinance your line of credit at some point in the future.
Unfortunately, we know of no way of telling today where the rates will be
when that time comes. If you think you need the cash long term, our advice is
to take it while the interest rates are low and lock in your rate by folding it
into your first mortgage.
Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs)
Sometimes called a variable, an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is a loan with
an interest rate that changes on a fixed schedule. The benefit to this particu-
lar kind of mortgage is that it generally offers a less expensive payment than
other loan types — at least initially. When considering ARMs as an option, the
time length you plan to have your new loan as well as the current interest
rate are the factors most important in making the right choice.
Several types of ARMs are available. Some adjust monthly, semiannually,
annually, or at some set number of years. Some basic definition of ARM com-
ponents you need to understand include
 Start rate: This is the initial interest rate that establishes your payment.
Lower is better for you.
 Life cap: This is the highest interest rate your ARM can go to. Lower is
better for you.
 Index: This is a published market rate that your loan will be tied to. If
the market rate goes up, your loan payment goes up. If the market rate
goes down, your loan payment goes down. Common indexes are the
11th District Cost of Funds (COFI), Monthly Treasury Average (MTA), or
London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
 Margin: This is an arbitrary amount over the index that the lender
establishes to determine the rate you’ll pay. For example, your margin
may be 2.25 percent over the current LIBOR rate of 1.5 percent, making
293
Chapter 16: Refinancing: More Money, Cheaper Payments

your interest rate total 3.75 percent. This rate is called your float rate. 
A lower margin is better for you.
 Rate adjustment period: This is how often your interest rate can adjust.
Less frequent adjustments are better for you when rates are going up,
and better for the lender when rates are going down.
 Periodic interest cap: This is how high your interest rate can adjust in
any one period. Lower is better for you.
 Payment adjustment period: This tells you how often your payment can
adjust. Less frequent adjustments are better for you when rates are
going up, and better for the lender when rates are going down.
 Periodic payment cap: This is how high your payment can adjust in any
one period. Lower is better for you.
Have your loan officer explain all the details of each appropriate option. If
your loan officer won’t provide you with a detailed explanation, then find one
who will. Get the naked truth because you deserve the right to bare ARMs.
(Groan!) Seriously, lenders are coming out with new variations on ARMs con-
stantly. Some programs — such as interest-only and short-term fixed — have
great benefits and have recently become popular.
Arguments for a short-term fixed 3/1 or 5/1 ARM
3/1 and 5/1 ARMs are called short-term fixed because the interest rates stay
the same for a period of three or five years before turning into an ARM that
adjusts every six months or year. These loans are generally amortized over
30 years but only have a fixed rate for the first three or five years as speci-
fied. The real beauty is that they can save you as much as 1 percent in inter-
est rate over a 30-year fixed-rate loan, without increasing your risk.
Usually, when you decide to take a short-term loan rather than a long-term
loan, you’re expecting a major financial change in your life within the next
five years or so. Perhaps you’re planning to sell your house to capture some
appreciation, or maybe you’re expecting a promotion or inheritance. In any
case, the risk you’re taking is that the prevailing market rates may increase
significantly when the loan goes past its fixed period. These loans usually
convert to annual adjustable-rate mortgages after their fixed terms end. On a
typical $300,000 loan, the monthly payment savings can be more than $250 a
month; during five years, the $15,000 in savings will more than pay the costs
of a refinance.
Calculate the monthly savings on the payment of a current short-term fixed
loan versus a 30-year fixed loan. Think of all the reasons you might move or
refinance in the next five years. Assuming that the savings is $250 a month,
ask yourself the following question: “Am I willing to bet $250 a month for five
years — a total of $15,000 — that I will still have this loan in more than five
years?” If the answer is no, then a short-term fixed is the right loan for you.
294
Part IV: All the After Stuff 

Arguments for a negative amortization loan
The creation of the term “negative amortization” is a perfect example of a
corporate bank’s marketing department gone seriously wrong! Amortization
means the spreading out of payments to pay off a loan over its time period. 
A negative amortization loan’s interest rate fluctuates monthly. However, a
low minimum payment is established, allowing the home’s equity to absorb
the ups and downs of the interest-rate market. Any difference between the
minimum payment and the required interest rate is simply added to the loan
balance. This way, your house actually helps you make the payment. Because
interest rates generally rise in a hot economy, your home’s value usually
increases at the same time, but there are no guarantees.
The greatest advantage to this loan is that it offers you the option of paying
whatever you want beyond the minimum payment each and every month.
Banks often make the terms of these loans very attractive because you’re
sharing the risk. After five years, these loans are generally reamortized over
the remaining 25 years. This reamortization may take away the payment ben-
efits and put you in need of a refinance. This reamortization process is known
as recasting the loan.
Examine your cash flow needs and your area’s real estate market. In some
areas of the country, houses go up in value so fast that the increase can equal
more than your annual salary. If you’re struggling for money every month,
this loan lets your house shoulder that burden. Chances are that the monthly
savings will have a bigger benefit to your lifestyle than the forfeited equity
when you eventually sell. If you’re looking for short-term cash flow solutions,
the negative amortization loan is a great one.
295
Chapter 16: Refinancing: More Money, Cheaper Payments
Banking on impounds
Some lenders offer price breaks if you accept
impounds. Impounds are when you allow 
the lender to collect your property taxes and
insurance as part of your monthly payment.
Subsequently, your lender pays out these
impounds to the appropriate insurance com-
pany and government entity. You can sometimes
save as much as a quarter point upfront at 
closing by agreeing to allow your lender to col-
lect these impounds. The only downside may be
coming up with a bit more cash at funding to
fund the impound account. You do get paid
interest on the funds held by your lender, but
you’re not exactly going to get rich off of the
small amount of interest that you’ll stack up over
the course of the loan.

Interest-only options
The interest-only loan is a relatively recent program offering. Normally, mort-
gages are amortized, meaning that payments are spread out equally into the
future to pay off the mortgage over time. The typical 30-year fixed mortgage,
for example, is amortized to pay off automatically in 30 years. Your monthly
payment comprises two parts:
 The interest due (the cost of the loan)
 A principal payment (the actual money loaned to you)
Even though your payments stay level during the course of the loan, your
payment amount going toward your principal becomes larger, reducing your
interest and paying off the balance. For the first few years, most of your pay-
ment goes to interest (which is good news, because Uncle Sam allows you —
if you live in the United States — to deduct these interest payments from
your income tax).
Because most ARMs are held only for a short while, and principal reduction
isn’t significant, banks now offer borrowers an opportunity to have even
lower payments by paying interest only. This kind of loan can provide you
with significant monthly savings, without heavily impacting your long-term
finances.
For example, on a fully amortized $350,000 loan at 6 percent (paying principal
and interest), in the first five years you pay roughly $350 against principal each
month and approximately $1,750 toward interest each month. Alternatively,
you could choose an interest-only loan, saving you the $350 principal reduc-
tion each month. That money would be available to you for expenses, sav-
ings, or investment in some other asset.
So, although the interest-only loan gives you a lower payment option, you
have to decide which approach makes more sense for you — tying up your
money in your home (as equity) or saving $350 per month. Remember:
Paying out $350 less each month can have a significant and positive impact
on your cash flow whereas the amortized amount on a fully amortized loan
will likely be small in proportion to your home’s value. In fact, when you sell
the house, you’ll pay more in real estate commission than the amortized
amount over a five-year period.
Zero-cost loans can be expensive
Mortgages are all about yield. A yield is a calculated number that takes into
account both the fees that you pay and the interest rate that you get. Banks
offer zero-cost loans to attract business, but raise the rate to cover their
expenses.
296
Part IV: All the After Stuff 

Are you curious how to determine the right pricing for your loan situation?
First look at when paying points may or may not be appropriate. Points are
fees based upon a percentage of the loan amount that affect yield. One point
is equal to 1 percent of the loan amount. Points are charged to lower the rate.
How many points depends on the lender and the financial markets, but usu-
ally a half point lowers your rate by 1⁄8 percent. At this ratio, the amount of
payment savings equal the points paid in roughly five to eight years, depend-
ing upon loan amount and current interest rates.
If you’re taking a 30-year fixed loan, you’re probably planning to have this
loan for longer than five or ten years. In this case, paying points may lower
your rate and payment beyond what they cost. However, if you aren’t plan-
ning to own the home for more than five years, you may want to entertain 
the idea of a shorter-term loan such as a 3/1 or 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage
(see “Arguments for a short-term fixed 3/1 or 5/1 ARM,” earlier in this chap-
ter). Having a short-term loan is a good argument for paying less points.
To obtain a zero-cost loan, the lender needs to create a yield-spread premium
(YSP) — usually called a rebate — to cover the loan’s points and fees. A
rebate is money that the lender contributes in exchange for a higher interest
rate. In order to achieve a zero-cost loan, the lender isn’t going to absorb the
costs of the transaction — everyone still expects to get paid. Instead, the
lender is going to simply raise the interest rate to match the yield.
Before making a decision, compare which offering is best for you. Ask your
loan officer to give you the interest rate with payment as well as the total
points and fees for each option. Make sure you ask for all the available
options. Next, pick any two options, and take the difference in total points and
fees and divide it by the monthly payment difference. Doing so tells you how
long it will take to make up the difference. Sometimes, the ratio of points to
rate favor you instead of the bank and they can change daily. Because many of
the closing costs are the same regardless of the size of your loan, a smaller
loan can require a higher interest rate in order to cover the costs. You may
find the difference on a long-term loan can save you thousands of dollars. It
pays to ask your loan officer for all the options and run the numbers!
297
Chapter 16: Refinancing: More Money, Cheaper Payments
Points and tax deduction
Because points are considered interest, they’re
generally tax deductible on your primary home.
Some restrictions do exist, however. For exam-
ple, points are deductible only on the first
$1.1 million financed. With a refinance, you must
amortize the deduction over the loan’s term. So,
if you paid $6,000 in points, you’d deduct $200
annually on a 30-year loan. If you refinance or
sell the home, you can take the remaining deduc-
tion in that year. Continuing this example, in the
fifth year, if you refinanced, you’d deduct the
remaining $5,200 at the end of that year. Check
with your accountant or financial planner to take
advantage of deductibility.

Paying Off Your Home May 
Be Fiscally Irresponsible
For as long as we can remember, our grandparents have been saying to us
“Pay off your home, and you’ll never have to worry.” Of course, Grandma and
Grandpa’s generation also told us that cigarettes were good for us and that
coffee was relaxing. Too many people today fail to take advantage of their
greatest asset; they have all their cash locked up in their house where they
can’t get to it and where it isn’t making them any money. In addition, most
homeowners don’t take advantage of the many tax-deduction opportunities
associated with mortgages. In some cases, the government will pay as much
as 40 percent of your payment so that you can take your cash and invest it in
a diversified portfolio of assets with a better return.
Retirement isn’t a good excuse for paying off your home mortgage. Many
people are lured into a false sense of security thinking it’s good not to have a
house payment, but the truth is that few people die while still living at home.
Most have health problems requiring special living needs, and most senior citi-
zens end up having to sell their homes — where most of their savings actually
are — to pay for healthcare or assisted-living facilities. Unfortunately, when
someone is forced to sell fast, they often have to sell at a lower price. Or worse,
they rack up credit card debt to get the money needed in a timely manner.
Cash in hand is the only true security in the golden years. Extensively discuss
these issues in this section with an experienced, qualified financial planner.
The 15-year fixed myth
An alluring loan for many people is the 15-year fixed loan. Many people believe
this type of loan will protect their financial security. The truth is a 15-year loan
robs you of your cash availability and interest-rate deductions. Furthermore,
298
Part IV: All the After Stuff 
Pondering prepayment penalties
Prepayment penalties are common with zero-
point, zero-fee loans. Such penalties protect the
lender from additional losses if you pay off the
loan early. The amount of these penalties varies,
and the states set different legal limits. Most
prepayment penalties don’t exceed three years,
but typically they’re only for one year. A typical
penalty is six month’s interest on 80 percent of
the balance. For example: a $300,000 loan at 6
percent interest would have a prepayment
penalty of $7,200. Because the penalty is con-
sidered interest, it may be tax deductible. If
you’re taking a long-term loan such as 30-year
fixed, then you may want to risk the prepayment
penalty to save money. Some loans offer a soft
prepayment penalty; “soft” means that you
can’t refinance, but you can sell the house with
no penalty.

it locks you into a higher payment that costs you money to reduce. This loan
amortizes your payments over 15 years, requiring you to put additional
money every month toward your loan’s principal balance. The banks don’t
care if you take a shorter loan or not — the reason banks offer these loans at
lower rates is because they get paid back sooner and can reinvest the money.
They don’t want to take the time to tell you that this loan is bad for you. They
don’t want to pay for people to educate you. They just want to sell you what
you ask for and make the quick buck.
Many people have been led to believe this loan saves them money because
they’re paying less interest over time. However, if you take the difference in
mortgage payments between a 15-year and a 30-year loan, and you put that
money into a conservative investment with a comparable yield, you would
have the available cash to pay off your house in 15 years anyway. Additionally,
you’d have the cash readily available to you for emergencies, as well as a
better interest-rate deduction. If you work with a good financial advisor who
gets you a higher rate on your investments, you’ll actually have more money
at the end of 15 years.
Also, the government allows you to deduct the interest that you’re paying on
your loan from your income, which reduces your tax bracket in some cases.
The more you pay down the loan balance, the more you reduce the interest
deduction. For individuals with a high income, mortgage interest may be the
only real tax deduction that you have.
The biweekly fallacy
Many lenders offer (for a fee) a biweekly mortgage payment option, claiming
that it can save you nine years of interest. Don’t fall for this claim! It’s just a
marketing ploy!
Actually, if after reading this chapter you still decide to pay off your mort-
gage, you can shorten your 30-year loan by seven years without paying some-
one else to help you or forcing yourself into a mandatory higher payment.
Most of the savings stems from the fact that there are 26 biweekly periods in
a year. Because you pay half a month’s payment 26 times, you’re actually
paying 13 monthly payments each year, which can shorten your 30-year loan
in essence to a 23-year loan. Any honest loan officer can calculate acceler-
ated payments on your loan and help you keep your money in your pocket
where it belongs.

Art of Landscaping
In This Chapter
 Preparing a landscape plan

 Installing or building structures
 Planting greenery
S
urrounding every newly built custom house is a rough construction site
just waiting to be transformed into an idyllic yard. Well-planned and well-
maintained landscaping adds significantly to your home’s value. Using struc-
tures and plants to help shade your home can save money over your home’s
lifetime, too. And, believe us, nothing goes further than beautiful plants, walk-
ways, and fences in boosting your home’s curb appeal.
But don’t put the cart before the horse. Take the time to first complete your
home’s interior before tackling outdoor projects. Here are two good reasons
why:
 If you didn’t set aside a good chunk of money to pay for hardscaping
(walkways, fences, walls, and pools) and softscaping (plants, trees, and
shrubs) before construction began, you may be able to refinance your
newly built home to help pay for some of the costs. But you can’t refi-
nance a home that’s not finished. (See Chapter 16 for refinancing
advice.)
 Also, don’t forget that the No. 1 job of those good folks building your
home is getting their jobs done even if that means hauling a bunch of
bricks over your freshly planted grass or tearing into your nice, neat
garden to reroute the plumbing.

After you’ve completed your home, take comprehensive photos of its exte-
rior and its surroundings. These photos will be invaluable tools as you pur-
chase plant materials, talk with landscape designers, or just mull over
possibilities for your yard as you sit around the kitchen table — something
you’ll definitely enjoy doing when your home is completed.
In this chapter, we explore the planning and installation of hardscaping and
softscaping. We also discuss how to choose and work with a landscape
designer. Don’t forget: The more work you put into planning landscape ele-
ments, the more you and your friends and family can enjoy them.
Designing Your Dream Landscape
Think about it: You wouldn’t build a home without a set of plans. So, even
though just digging in and building a stone wall here, or planting a few bulbs
there or a tree or two over there is tempting, take the time to devise a com-
prehensive landscaping plan before you forge ahead. Not only will taking the
time to put together a plan save you time and money, but, believe us, it can
also save you a lot of headaches, too!
The landscape plan you or a professional create offers a blueprint for your
landscape’s finished product. But keep in mind that you don’t need to com-
plete everything the plan specifies immediately.
Using a designer – yes or no?
Before you start drafting your landscaping plan, you need to make a major
decision. Just like you chose whether or not to use an architect for your
custom home (see Chapter 5), you need to decide if you want to use a land-
scape designer. (Take a deep breath though; a landscape designer is nowhere
nearly as expensive as an architect.)
When deciding whether to use a landscape designer, you need to consider
your skills, time, and budget. If you want to install items as you save money
over time, you can. Or if you hope to cut costs by doing much of the work
yourself, you can take your time to implement the ideas set out in the plan.
If you have the necessary tools and skills, or if you’re short on cash, doing
your own landscaping may be a wise investment. If, however, you’re strapped
for time or simply don’t have the skills or proper equipment, hand the job
over to a pro. What looks like a simple task, say laying a crushed stone drive-
way, often isn’t — especially for someone who doesn’t do the job for a living.
If in doubt, farm it out!

So, if you decide to use a landscape designer, you need to figure out which
one can help save your home from that just-built look, instead making it look
like your house and grounds landed on the earth fully matured. Actually, just
to keep you on your toes, people in the landscape-design industry work
under a wide variety of titles.
You may, for example, hire a landscape architect. These professionals, who
often work on large projects, are bound by the strictest licensing require-
ments and can register with the American Society of Landscape Architects
(www.asla.org).
Or, you may hire a landscape designer. Landscape designers usually have a
background in horticulture, but no specific training is required to assume the
title of landscape designer. Some designers complete a national certification
program (and some don’t), which may or may not be a big deal, depending on
your particular designer’s artistic sense and his ability to translate this sense
into reality. You can find out more about certified professionals through the
Association of Professional Landscape Designers (www.apld.com). Some land-
scape designers use satellite and Web technology to provide better design 
services. Kevin’s personal favorite is www.mydesignscape.com. This company
also provides excellent education on their Web site regarding the landscape
design process.
When selecting a landscape designer or architect, take the extra time to do
some research. Ask for at least three references and talk with previous clients
to see if they’re satisfied with the work before making any decisions.
Relying on other professionals
In addition to landscape architects and designers, you can call on other pro-
fessionals for help, including nurserymen or growers. These helpful folks who
staff nurseries or garden centers offer great experience with and knowledge
of plants. For expert information on trees, look to an arborist.
Finally, the contractors who do landscape work may be licensed like other
home-improvement contractors, or not, depending on your local restrictions,
and they may belong to the Associated Landscape Contractors of America
(www.alca.org).
No matter what type of professional you use to help create your new outdoor
spaces, choose someone you communicate with well. Ask for his or her refer-
ences, and check with at least three previous clients to be sure their jobs
were completed in a timely manner and to their liking.

Chapter 17: Taking It Outside: The Art of Landscaping

Taking the beginning steps with a designer
If you choose to hire a landscape designer, she can take your ideas, photos 
of the lot, and descriptions of outdoor amenities you admire to help create 
a landscape with the look and feel you want. (If you need inspiration, drive
around several neighborhoods, noting and photographing landscape features
you like.) The designer should also ask pointed questions about your lifestyle.
The designer takes note of your style preferences and puts them to work in
the design she creates for you. Do you like a cottage-style garden with its lush
layers of flowers and informal beds? Do you prefer something more formal
and manicured? Or are you attracted to a refined Asian style?
You can’t overcommunicate with your landscape designer. What is important to
you? (We help you evaluate your landscaping preferences in the “Considering
your wants and needs” section, later in this chapter.) Share what you want with
your designer and hold her to it. Remember that your landscape design needs
to complement the look of your home. Most likely, you won’t be happy with a
free-form cottage garden surrounding your minimalist contemporary home.
Hold regular meetings with her to make sure you’re both on the same page.
Revisiting your site plan
Remember that site plan you had drawn up way back when you purchased
your land? You know, the one that shows how the house sits on your lot and
how far it sits from the street and your neighbors’ houses, the plan that’s
starting to get curled up along the edges? Time to dig it out. The site plan
acts as the basis for your landscaping plan.
If you work with a garden center that has a landscape designer on staff, ask
whether the garden center can deduct the fees charged for a landscape design
from the cost of its plant materials you purchase. Because you have to buy the
landscaping materials anyway, using your garden center’s staff to draw up your
plan may just be a way for you to get a lot more for your money.
The detail in your landscape plan varies based upon the designer. Some
designers may refer to other drawings in your original working drawings (see
Chapter 6) to reference items such as utility placement. When it’s complete,
your plan or plans need to show the following:
 Vegetation that already exists around your new home.
 Location of existing buildings and structures.
 Dimensions of existing buildings and structures.
 Property lines, including any irregularities such as easements granted to
neighbors or lines that follow a natural feature like a river bank.
304
Part IV: All the After Stuff 

 Placement of windows in the finished home, to assist in planning for
views from the inside (you don’t want big bushes planted in front of that
expensive picture window!).
 The site’s topography — hills and valleys, where the land is low and
high on the site.
 Site conditions, such as boggy or rocky areas. Boggy areas may be par-
ticularly noteworthy: Any place that water ponds or doesn’t drain on
your property may become a problem after you’ve built your house.
Part of your landscape design needs to include grading your land away
from your home, to keep standing water far from your foundation.
 Location of utilities, including gas lines, buried electric lines, septic
tanks, sewer lines, wells, and in-ground sprinkler systems.
 Compass directions.
This plan will be the canvas for you or your landscape designer to paint your
new home’s landscape. Save it, even after work on the landscaping is done. In
years to come, the plan can be very helpful, assisting you to find the location
of buried utilities, for example.
Considering your wants and needs
Before you map out your new home’s landscape or meet with a professional
who can help you, make a list of your wants and needs for your outdoor
spaces. Will you eat outside? Entertain? Meditate? Relax or play games? Do
you want to spend every weekend maintaining a yard or would you rather be
out on your boat or attending extracurricular activities with your kids? Is it a
home that you’ll only use during certain times of the year? Are you interested
in creating a xeriscape, a type of landscaping that uses native plants and
requires little or no supplemental watering? Also consider the outdoor ameni-
ties you’ve enjoyed at your previous homes, such as gardens, ponds, or
decks, and how you can replicate those amenities around your new home.
The following sections help you consider the possibilities for your new yard.
Playing around with outdoor hobbies, games, and fun
When designing your yard, look in home catalogs or even shop the aisles 
of discount stores for ideas to find all the accoutrements of indoor living,
moved outdoors (and even a few things that never were indoors!). You can
find outdoor rugs, outdoor lamps, patio heaters, fire pits, outdoor wet bars,
and pattern after pattern of outdoor serving dishes. More and more people
are gathering with friends and family outside.
305
Chapter 17: Taking It Outside: The Art of Landscaping

The land around your new home may become your own personal recreation
and entertainment center. In fact, if your new place is located miles away
from “civilization,” you may find yourself spending more of your leisure time
at home. Are there activities you want to pursue but can’t right now? Want 
to plant a vegetable garden? Play bocce? Raise llamas? Host a neighborhood
barbecue? If you have the space, you can tailor your landscape to accommo-
date these interests.
All types of outdoor spaces can serve as party central, and now’s the time 
to plan for them. Will your landscape plan include a deck, patio, outdoor
kitchen, or barbecue pit? Will you sip coffee on the deck in the morning?
Spend afternoons around the pool? Host twilight dinners on your patio
warmed by an outdoor fireplace? (If so, be sure to invite us over!)
If your family includes children or grandchildren, give thought to outdoor
areas for them. A swing set is an obvious amenity, but you may also provide a
children’s garden, a small playhouse, a sports court for tennis, basketball, or
hopscotch, or a pool.
Whether play areas are for you or for children, some preplanning can help
make them perfect. How about running plumbing lines to an outdoor sink for
easy cleanups after gardening? Or installing an outdoor drinking faucet to
eliminate the need for kids to run in and out of the house for refreshments? If
you consider what time of day you’ll use the spaces, your electrical plan can
include lines for proper lighting of the outdoor spaces.
In special areas set aside for children, safety dictates what materials you
choose for ground cover, fencing, plant materials, and lighting. Be sure your
landscape designer knows your intentions in creating play areas. Ask your
nurseryman about plants to avoid near children’s areas and be sure to lay
down plenty of cushioning mulch or pea gravel under children’s play 
equipment.
Factors such as your site’s topography, your local climate, and what time of
day you plan to use your outdoor spaces influence the kinds of amenities you
select, how they’re designed and built, and how you’ll ultimately use them.
Be sure to plan for them now, before you start building them. You’ll thank us
a thousand times over if you take this simple advice.
Balancing privacy and open space
Another factor to consider in planning your landscape is how the location
affects your needs for privacy or open space. Your lot’s size will obviously
have a major effect on these needs. An urban townhouse owner, for example,
may long for privacy from close neighbors, while a rural homeowner with a
view of the mountains may want a greater degree of openness.
306
Part IV: All the After Stuff 

Even if your home is set deep in the woods, you may still long for a truly pri-
vate “retreat” outdoors. A cozy area can be carved out in your plans and
accessed by a secluded walkway. To make this area an even more special place
to meditate, read, or just daydream, plan to accessorize it with items that
appeal to all the senses: a bubbling fountain, wind chimes, a small pond, fra-
grant plants, lush flowers, a beautiful view, or a favorite piece of outdoor art.
Other outdoor spaces that may call for privacy are hot tub areas or dining
areas — especially those eating spaces that you may use in the morning
while relaxing in your pajamas.
Even small lots can accommodate open spaces (or create the illusion of wide-
open spaces by using long sight lines). You’ll need open space if you want to
play games like badminton or croquet, or if you dream of stargazing at night.
Mountain, valley, or water views may call for spaces free from trees. And,
depending on your local climate, you may want an open space for a pool. (In
hot climates, you may prefer shade near the pool. In cooler climates, you’ll
welcome the sunlight for its ability to warm the water.)
Dealing with your climate
Your landscape designer needs to understand your area’s general climate as
well your site’s specific microclimate (the climate in your particular neighbor-
hood). Temperature ranges, levels of annual precipitation, and the paths of
prevailing winds are among the factors that dictate what types of plants and
trees will thrive on your lot and those that won’t (saving you the expense of
replacing sick or dead greenery that isn’t suited to your particular location).
If you’re not using a designer, find a helpful staffer at your local nursery, and
ask him or her plenty of questions about which plants will work for your
yard.
And, here’s a bonus: Understanding these factors also can help you locate
amenities such as outdoor eating areas, pools, gardens, and hot tubs so
they’re more enjoyable for you and your friends and family — well worth the
price of admission.
Saving time and money by design
If you’ve ever shopped for trees, then you know just how expensive plant
materials can be. But as expensive as buying plants can be, they’re even
more expensive when you consider the ongoing cost of watering, fertilizing,
and maintenance. By choosing the right plants for your climate, you can cut
down on watering and fertilizing and save yourself money in the long run. A
solid landscape plan also takes into account growth patterns of trees and
plants, helping you avoid expensive mistakes, like putting the shade-loving
plants in the sunny parts of your yard.
307
Chapter 17: Taking It Outside: The Art of Landscaping

You don’t want to purchase, maintain, and buy fuel for a lawn mower? Or take
the time to walk it around your yard every weekend? No problem. Your land-
scape designer can create a plan that doesn’t include grass that must be
trimmed every week.
And you can save on landscaping costs before you even begin construction:
Proponents of natural landscaping argue that saving as much of the existing
vegetation on a building site saves money in the long run and is an environ-
mentally sensitive practice that preserves existing ecosystems. If you like 
the way your property looks now, then your designer can create a plan that
enhances what you already have.
If you hope to protect your lot’s current plants and trees (or your local
municipality requires you to save certain trees), you must work closely with
your contractor to prevent what Andy Wasowski (author of the eye-opening
book Building Inside Nature’s Envelope [Oxford University Press]) calls “land
scraping.” According to Wasowski, the practice of clearing an entire construc-
tion site down to dirt is wasteful and unnecessary. If your site beckoned to
you because of its lush woods or wildflower meadow, you can (and should)
create a building site without completely eliminating those features. But, you
need your contractor’s total cooperation. The bottom-line benefit? Every tree
or plant you save during construction is one fewer you have to buy when
your home is done.
Getting your plan on paper
The designer takes your ideas for your landscape and, with the help of her
knowledge and experience, creates a landscape design on paper for you to
review. Take the time to look over this plan carefully, asking questions about
anything you don’t understand. If you don’t like certain elements, or some
elements don’t seem to mesh with your needs, tell your designer. Together,
you can come up with a plan that’s perfect for you.
If you’re sketching out your own design, consider using one of the available
software programs, such as Smart Draw (www.smartdraw.com) to help you
plot out your ideas. Or, you can use the good old method of graph paper and
pencil. If you draw out your site plan on paper, then top that plan with trac-
ing paper so you can try out different landscape elements without having to
redraw your site plan over and over again. Go to http://landscaping.
about.com for a brief tutorial on drawing your own landscape design. (See
Figure 17-1 for an example of a landscape plan.)

Putting Your Plan in Action —
Hardscaping
You can’t hang draperies in your new home until you have finished putting in
your windows and walls. It’s the same outside: You must wait to install plants
in your yard until you’ve created the structure of your landscape. These
structural, or nonliving, elements are referred to as hardscaping.
As with most of the elements of your new home, you can build your hard-
scape features or hire someone to do it for you. If you have the skills, tools,
and, most of all, time to tackle these projects, go for it. Otherwise, you can
find the professional contractors needed (masons for concrete or stone work,
carpenters for wood fences or decks, and so on) by asking your general con-
tractor, family, friends, neighbors, or landscape designer if you’re using one
for recommendations. Be sure these contractors are licensed and bonded
according to your local codes and ask for and check their references.

Planning a patio, Daddy-o
Materials for patios are the same as those for walkways and driveways (see
Chapter 14). The material you choose depends on your style preference, cli-
mate, and budget. To create a patio that you’ll use often and spend little time
maintaining, make sure you find the best possible place for it in your land-
scape and install it correctly.
The material you choose to pave the patio will be its floor. You can also plan
for “walls” for the patio — which may consist of just an ankle-high border of
flowers or a half wall of stacked stones. If you want a bit of shade for the
patio, you can build some type of overhead shelter. It could be a lightweight,
open trellis, a more substantial kind of trellis that rests on pillars (also called
a pergola), an awning attached to an adjacent house wall, or a permanent
roof. Because you’ll probably eat and drink on the patio, make sure it’s easily
accessible to your home’s kitchen or an outdoor refrigerator and grill.
Patios, obviously, are located at ground level. If your home plan calls for an
outdoor space that is raised (either a little or a lot), choose a deck. (See the
next section, “Lounging on the deck,” for more information on decks.) If the
ground around your home slopes radically, a patio may not be an option.
When adding a patio, make sure you don’t impede the flow of rainwater away
from your home.
Lounging on the deck
If you were to take an aerial snapshot of just about any housing development
in the nation, you’d see decks sprouting off the back of every home. Homes
just don’t seem complete anymore without some form of deck or outdoor
living space. The deck you plan can be a simple square or rectangle, or a mul-
tilevel affair that terraces out over your landscape. It can bridge the space
between your home and your pool, offer space to eat, relax, and look up at
the stars, boast a hot tub for soaking, or accommodate a snazzy gas grill.
With so many books, Web sites, and magazines showing photos and plans of
decks, gathering ideas for yours needn’t be difficult. We talk about decks that
are attached to the house in Chapter 14. You may decide to add an unat-
tached deck away from the house and pay for it after the house is complete.
Be careful not to end up with a deck in a place that’s so sunny or so shaded
that using the deck will be unpleasant.
Your choice for deck materials includes
 Cedar, which is also naturally resistant to decay and insects.
 Other exotic woods, such as ipe, which may offer the benefit of more
closely matching the look of the flooring inside your home.
310
Part IV: All the After Stuff 

 Manufactured wood, a durable and almost maintenance-free product
made from wood flour and plastic resins. Plastic wood offers the added
benefit of recycling unwanted materials (such as sawdust and pop bot-
tles) into something usable.
 Pressure-treated pine, which is widely available and inexpensive.
 Redwood, which naturally resists decay and insects, but is quite expen-
sive and not always available at local home-improvement stores.
Choose a material based on your budget, your tolerance for maintenance
tasks, and the look you want to achieve. You can use these same materials to
build other outdoor wood structures, such as gazebos, children’s play sets,
benches, and trellises. If you’re interested in recycling, like the idea of a low-
maintenance material, and don’t find the look of manufactured wood offen-
sive, why not choose it as a sensible alternative to other woods? In a few
years, you’ll be happy to be sitting on your deck sipping a cool drink while
your neighbors work up a sweat sanding and staining their decks.
The art of fencing
When you or your landscape designer are putting together your landscaping
plans, remember that the uses for a fence are endless. They can keep wild
critters out of your yard and hold your pet critters in. They can define gar-
dens or seating areas. A tall fence brings privacy and sometimes shade. Some
fences are only for show, others to keep peace between neighbors. All pro-
vide structure in the landscape — a kind of frame for the masterpiece you
paint with plants and trees.
Fencing materials run the gamut from wood to stone to metal to plastics.
Which material you choose depends on
 Your budget (wood is less expensive than stone or metal)
 Your preferred degree of maintenance (wood requires much more main-
tenance than stone or metal)
 Whether you want to build the fence yourself (digging those postholes is
a lot of work!)
 Your neighborhood’s codes and restrictions (which may govern fence
height, materials, or setback from property lines)
 The function of the fence (are you looking for privacy or decoration?)
Before you start digging the postholes for your new fence, be sure you know
(and mark!) the exact location of your lot lines and utility lines. You don’t
want to have to move the fence because it sits on your neighbor’s property.
And heaven knows you don’t want to dig and hit your water line. Also be sure
the fence you have planned adheres to your local building codes and any
restrictions your neighborhood or community spells out.

Chapter 17: Taking It Outside: The Art of Landscaping

Building great walls
Walk around the ruins of an abandoned house and you’ll likely see stone foun-
dation walls, a stone chimney, or maybe even stone walls still standing long
after the rest of the home has disintegrated. Stone walls are simply built to last.
The enduring strength of stone walls — and the skill required to build them —
accounts for their high price tag. Still, nothing adds charm or substance to a
home’s gardens and landscape quite like a stone wall.
If you want a true mortared stone wall outside your home, you need to hire a
skilled mason. To find potential candidates, ask your general contractor, the
staff at your local garden center, or other homeowners who have masonry
walls you admire.
Building a stone wall yourself requires time and patience — and no small
amount of skill. Whether you do it yourself or hire it out, another way to save
money is to substitute bricks or manufactured stones. Today’s manufactured
stones very closely resemble their natural counterparts and are available in a
wide range of colors and styles. If you need assistance, ask for information at
your local garden center or check out Landscaping For Dummies by Phillip
Giroux, Bob Beckstrom, Lance Wallheim, and the editors of the National
Gardening Association (Wiley). You may also find that boulder walls, which
must be installed with the help of large machinery, can hold back large
amounts of earth.
If you’ve made the decision that nothing but stone will do for you, the place
to look for the lowest prices is the stone yard or quarry. Many garden centers
and home-improvement stores carry small amounts of rock and gravel, but
you’ll find it more economical to buy bulk quantities at a stone yard. Buy
enough, and the stone yard will likely deliver and unload it for free, if you’re
within a reasonable distance.
312
Part IV: All the After Stuff 
Patio stone can be Gorges
In 1992, the Chinese government decided to flood
the Yangtze River Valley with a super dam that
will be the largest on the planet. After the dam in
the Three Gorges area of China is complete and
the valley is flooded, 1,600 villages will cease to
exist, except as a natural habitat for fish under
600 feet of water. What does this have to do with
hardscaping? Plenty! One very enterprising busi-
ness couple has made arrangements to take
apart the ancient buildings, stairs, and roads
piece by piece so that you can enjoy the beauty
of this ancient stone in your yard or patio. A piece
of history can be yours for a mere $45 per square
foot. For more information, check out www.
rhodes.org and see how entrepreneurs
Richard and Pamela Rhodes are single handedly
saving history.

Adding water
Even if you can’t live on the coast or near a lake, you can still create a water
view in your landscape. If you want to be lulled by the sound of water, but
want a low-maintenance water feature, choose a small, portable fountain. For
a larger investment in time or money, you can create a pond complete with
koi fish, water lilies, and a waterfall. You can buy a pond kit at your friendly,
local home-improvement center or garden pond specialist, or buy plastic
sheet pond liners and even preformed plastic ponds. The choice is yours.
But, don’t let the fish have all the fun — you can enjoy a swim at home, too, if
you plan a pool for your yard. Today, pool design is light years ahead of the
rusty metal above-ground pools you may remember from a few decades back.
What type of pool you choose — from a lap pool to a hot tub to a shallow
wading pool — depends on what you want to use it for, from physical activity
and relaxation to water therapy and entertainment.
As with many outdoor amenities, the type of pool you ultimately choose will
be dictated by your budget, willingness to perform maintenance tasks (or pay
to have them done for you), local climate, and community codes and restric-
tions. Remember: A pool is (just about) forever. After you have it, you have 
it, and if you don’t keep up with maintenance, you’ll have little more than a
mosquito-and-algae-infested swamp on your hands. Still, in some neighbor-
hoods, a pool is almost a necessity for resale. Your local climate and customs
affect your decision to add a pool or not to add a pool.
Lighting the way
At this point, take advantage of the groundwork you laid for your landscape
lighting when you designed your home’s lighting plan. Ideally, you had your
electrical contractor add a few electrical sockets and light sockets to the
house’s exterior. (See Chapter 14 for more information.) With the proper
wiring in place, you can create a wide variety of lighting effects outside your
home, which can make your home more beautiful and safer.
Consider these options, but remember, sometimes less is more. You don’t
want your outdoor lights keeping the neighbors awake all night.
 Uplighting creates interesting shadows by placing a light at the base of a
structure or tree that shines up.
 Downlighting is sometimes referred to as moonlighting because it cre-
ates light from above. The effect is achieved by placing a light fixture
high in a tree.
313
Chapter 17: Taking It Outside: The Art of Landscaping

 Feature lighting makes certain objects the stars in your outdoor show.
You may choose to spotlight a favorite tree, a backyard pond or foun-
tain, your doorway, an outdoor art object, or another architectural fea-
ture of your new home.
 Grazing consists of installing a light close to an interesting surface, such
as a brick or stone wall or the bark of a tree. The light shines across the
surface, showing off its texture.
 Low-voltage lighting fixtures are available in a wide variety of styles to
match your home’s looks. These lights add romance and safety as they
reveal the boundaries of a yard or line a walkway.
 Utility lighting comes into play when you need bright light in an out-
door area, such as near the grill, by a set of steps, or near the garage
where you’ll be unloading your car.
Love to light your home at the holidays? Talk to your landscape designer
about how to make the process easy. She can give you some suggestions on
placing outlets, camouflaging cords, and hanging fixtures.
Leafing Out — Softscaping with Plants
Your frame is complete and now you can begin to paint broad brushes of
color into your landscape and add layers of leafy texture with plants. Before
you can begin, however, take a good look at the soil around your new home.
Fill dirt and construction waste brought to the site may have rendered much
of the soil around your home less than desirable.
Get advice from your landscaper on amending the soil to make it more hos-
pitable to new plants and trees. Then take the time to implement the mea-
sures she suggests. You’re wasting time and money and killing or crippling
valuable plants if you stick them in crummy soil.
Planting trees after construction
The first living things to arrive on your site will probably be trees. If you’ve
done a careful job of protecting trees during construction, as we suggest in
the section “Saving time and money by design,” earlier in this chapter, you
may not need to plant new ones. Keep in mind, however, that saving trees
isn’t an easy task. See Chapter 5 for more information.
As you plant new trees, keep their growth patterns in mind and how their
placement may affect your views from inside. Will the new evergreens you
plant bring unwanted shade year-round to your new home’s sunroom? Will
you be able to see the beautiful blossoms of your new cherry tree from your
kitchen window?
314
Part IV: All the After Stuff 

Remember that trees grow underground, too. Root systems can damage foun-
dation walls and underground sewage lines. A good landscape plan elimi-
nates these potential problems by protecting the trees’ root systems from
damage that can be inflicted by heavy trucks parking too close to a tree, or
excavation that disturbs the roots.
As you choose your trees, keep in mind your love of (or distaste for) yard
work. Do you like to rake? Remember that trees that drop their leaves mean
extra yard work. Trees with blossoms or berries planted near your deck or
front walk may bring clean-up tasks with them. Some trees require little prun-
ing, others a lot. Ask questions when you’re designing your plan or when pur-
chasing trees.
Adding texture with shrubs
Between the tree and the flowering plant, you have the shrubs. These versa-
tile plants offer color (sometimes year-round), provide form, and bridge the
gaps between low-growing flowers and taller trees. What type of shrubs you
and/or your landscape designer choose depends on where they are located,
what you want in terms of leaf shape and color, and how much space you can
give them.
If you want a low-maintenance landscape, don’t choose shrubbery that
requires constant trimming. You can also keep weeding to a minimum and
help plantings retain moisture by adding landscape coverings such as wood
chips, wood mulch, or crushed rocks.
Bloom time — Annuals and perennials
For many people, flowers are the icing on the landscape cake. But most
garden experts advise you that flowers are short-lived. When choosing flow-
ering plants for your yard, keep the plants’ other characteristics in mind.
What are the color, size, and texture of the leaves? How tall will the plants
grow? Are they invasive?
Fortunately, you can easily get answers to these kinds of questions from the
multitude of gardening books available, your landscape designer, or even by
looking at neighbors’ yards. The latter method may be the most helpful if you
plan to build your home in a region that’s new to you. You may not be famil-
iar with the types of flowering plants that thrive in the climate. Taking a tour
of local gardens can give you a quick tutorial.

Saving money on plants
Poking around your neighbors’ gardens (with
their permission, of course) can actually save
you money. Your local gardeners and your land-
scape professional may agree that certain types
of flowering plants just don’t do well in the cli-
mate, or require a high degree of maintenance.
You can lower the cost of your landscape by
choosing plants that require little watering and
less fertilizing in your climate.
If you’re lucky, you may score a few free plants
during those visits to green-thumb neighbors.
Many plants must be divided seasonally to main-
tain their shape or their health. Offer to help your
neighbors thin their stock, and ask if you can take
divisions home to plant. Other gardeners’ castoffs
could be a windfall for the barren plains around
your new home.
You may also find good deals on plants and
shrubs at Lowe’s or Home Depot. But remember
to stick to your plan when buying plants. Don’t
just buy something because it’s a bargain — it
may not thrive in your garden.

your home, you can’t afford to head the wrong direction too many times. In
this chapter we examine ten of the most common and potentially damaging
mistakes and suggest ways of avoiding them before they happen.
Designing a House Unlike Others 
in the Neighborhood
Some people may assume that a major reason you’re building a custom home
is because you can’t find a house you like built by anyone else. However, pre-
suming you can build anything you want wherever you want is a mistake. If
you have an unlimited supply of money, then the future value of your home
may be unimportant. But for most people, their home’s value is as much
security for them as their other savings.
Building a house significantly larger or smaller than the other houses in the
neighborhood can make your house undesirable and harder to sell in the
future. You can avoid this problem by asking your real estate agent to show
you houses that are selling in the neighborhood, and you can also ask for
information on houses that have sold within the last three to six months. You
don’t have to design a house exactly like your neighbors’ homes, but you can

safely assume that future buyers looking in this neighborhood will be looking
for similar houses. However, you may face a challenge if you’re building in a
new subdivision where homes haven’t yet been built or sold. You may have
to rely on neighboring subdivision information. Check with the homeowners’
association (HOA) to find out what other homes are being built. Talk with the
other landowners if you can to find out their plans. Many HOAs have mini-
mum and maximum square footage guidelines exactly for this reason.
Chapter 5 addresses the design process more extensively.
Attempting to Build outside the Design
Review Guidelines
The design review process can be long and difficult enough without battling
for an exception to the established building guidelines. Neighborhoods and
cities set up these guidelines because most people like conformity in their
neighborhoods. You may in the end win a prolonged battle with the design
review committee, but it will cost you time and money (and perhaps the
goodwill of your new neighbors).
Review the design guidelines before you buy the property. Design review
committees are under no obligation to make exceptions. If you’re going to
buy in a development of custom homes, then accept the fact that you’ll need
to conform to the neighborhood. The more you design within the guidelines,
the faster and easier your approval will be. See Chapter 6 for more informa-
tion on the design review process.
Thinking the House Will Be Worth 
What It Costs
Many people just assume that if you spend $500,000 to build a house, it’ll be
worth $500,000. Some of the truly optimistic may think that if you spend
$500,000 to build a new house, it’ll be worth $1 million. Nothing could be fur-
ther from the truth. A house is worth the price that someone is willing to pay
for it. Research the houses that are selling in the neighborhood to see what
amenities people are paying for. Just because you spent $10,000 apiece for
ten antique Italian doors doesn’t mean that prospective buyers will pay
$100,000 more for your house than the house next door.

As soon as you understand the value of the neighborhood, you can create a
budget that fits your situation. If you’re going to finance your project, you’re
going to be dependent on a budget that fits in line with the appraised value.
You can find more information on the lending and appraisal process in
Chapters 8 and 9.
Paying Off the Lot Before 
Starting to Build
Paying off your lot before you start to build continues to be the single most
common mistake that consumers make. Although banks previously required
a paid-off piece of land before they would provide construction financing, this
practice has been dead for more than a decade.
Today, banks are concerned with your liquidity, or how much ready cash you
have available. After good credit, money in the bank is the next most impor-
tant criteria for loan approval. Putting your money in your land ties up your
money where you can’t get to it and the bank can’t verify it.
The best way to avoid this mistake is to finance your land with a low down
payment and hoard your cash until your construction loan is finished. You’ll
have plenty of opportunities to put that money into the house after your
house is completed and you have the final tally on your project’s cost. In the
meantime, cash in your hand can save you from a variety of trials and tribula-
tions along the path to your dream home. See Chapter 3 for information on
land financing and Chapter 8 on the lender’s approach to liquidity.
Waiting for Permits to Investigate
Construction Financing
Unfortunately, no standard order for the entire process of designing and
building a custom home exists. Logic can dictate some of the steps but some-
times logic can be deceiving. Even though the construction loan doesn’t take
place until you’re ready to build, you need to keep in mind several considera-
tions in the design process — such as the compatibility of the house in the
neighborhood and making the budget fit a lender’s guidelines — that can
impact your ability to get financed. Even the wrong approach to land financ-
ing can delay your project for years. By the time you have submitted your
permits, making significant changes to appease lending guidelines may be too
difficult.
321
Chapter 18: Ten Common Custom Home Mistakes and How to Avoid ’Em

The earlier you engage someone knowledgeable in construction lending the
better. Not all lenders will spend the time, especially if you’re a few years
away from building, but don’t let that discourage you. Take a loan officer to a
free lunch. Some brokers work hand-in-hand with you for several years to
make sure that every decision you make will be consistent with getting the
project completed in a financially palatable manner. To familiarize yourself
with what lenders are looking for, be sure to check out Chapter 9.
Applying for the Construction Loan 
Too Early
Applying for a construction loan too early may sound strange considering we
tell you not to take too much time in the previous section. The key difference
is the issue of applying for the construction loan. Get as much information as
you can on how the lender works and how to make your project fit its lending
criterion. However, applying for the loan more than two months before you’re
ready to break ground can be a waste of time and money. Furthermore, you
may disclose information that was unnecessary or may change in your favor.
Some information could make getting the loan at all difficult.
The safest general rule is to wait until your final plans are ready to be submit-
ted to the building department. (We lay out this process in Chapter 6.)
Applying at this time generally puts you within 60 days of breaking ground.
The lender won’t fund the loan without permits and because most of your
documentation, such as the appraisal and credit report, is good for 90 days,
you’ll have a little cushion. If it takes longer, don’t panic. You can renew or
restart the loan process, possibly with some minor additional fees. Try and
get as close as you can to the 60-day mark and communicate openly with
your loan officer on your timing.
Applying to Too Many Lenders
The construction lending community is a small one. In fact, the number of
national lenders that offer all-in-one construction and permanent loans (see
Chapter 8) number less than ten. Many banks and brokers submit their loans
to these lenders. If your loan gets submitted to the same lender through two
different sources and the information is inconsistent, you may be turned
down completely. If that lender is the only one that fits your project needs,
you may find yourself without any loan at all.
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Make sure your loan officer tells you who will be funding your loan. Loyalty
goes a long way with good construction loan officers, so do your shopping
first and then start the application process. After you start, make sure you
keep aware of how the loan process is moving along. If you know of or antici-
pate any hitches, try to resolve them with your loan officer. If you aren’t get-
ting cooperation, move your loan. You’re under no obligation to stay with
anyone who doesn’t take care of your needs.
Borrowing the Minimum to Get By
The only way to know exactly what a custom home project will cost is to
finish it. Therefore, the only time you can know your minimum loan needs is
after completion. We can think of nothing worse than running out of money 
in a custom home project. Don’t be a penny pincher. The amount of money
you save by taking a loan for $100,000 less is only $1,000 to $2,000 of tax-
deductible money — a relatively cheap insurance policy that protects you
from the tens of thousands of dollars it could cost you on an underfunded
project.
Kevin’s company has the motto “If someone offers you money, you should
take it.” You can always reconcile the proper loan amount after you have
moved in and paid for everything in the project.
Spending Your Own Money First
Some people decide that they’ll start the building process with their own sav-
ings and then get a construction loan when they’ve used up all their funds.
This theory has some major problems:
 The banks need to see cash reserves in your bank accounts (see
Chapter 9) and won’t count any of the money you have already put 
into the project toward the funds.
 If you’ve been using credit cards to fund construction, your credit
scores decrease, causing even bigger problems for qualification.
 Your project can come to a grinding halt in the middle if you run into any
financing difficulties, which can cost you even more money and may
force you to take a more expensive loan to bail out the project.
Have your financing all set to go when you’re ready to break ground. You can
apply for a loan after you’ve started, but try to avoid those unnecessary risks
if at all possible.
323
Chapter 18: Ten Common Custom Home Mistakes and How to Avoid ’Em

Selling Your Existing Home Before
Building the New One
If you’re building in the same region where you currently live, we can’t think
of many reasons to sell your existing home until you’re ready to move into
the new one. Here are a few good reasons for keeping the old home during
the build:
 Many lenders don’t factor your old house in their calculations for 
qualifying.
 You can take the necessary cash with a refinance or credit line at favor-
able rates and payments. Doing so gets you the cash today without
having to sell the house. (See Chapter 8 for more details.)
 You can avoid the cost and hassle of moving twice.
The custom home process has enough challenges, so the less disruption you
can make to family life until the house is finished, the better!

Ten Great Ways to Lower
Construction Costs
In This Chapter
 Saving money without cutting corners
 Keeping your project within your budget
N
early every would-be homeowner has a budget for his or her new
home. Your budget may be small or it may be “Bill Gates” big, but
either way, you’ll feel better about your home in the long run if it stays within
your financial expectations.
As you read through these tips, you can see that staying within your budget
often goes hand-in-hand with a smooth construction process — one that
causes you fewer sleepless nights, helps maintain a civil relationship with
your general contractor (and your significant others!), and gets you moved in
to your new home faster.
An added bonus to keeping your construction costs down is that you’ll still
have enough money when the home is finished to buy furniture, rugs, and
accessories. When the urge to splurge arises during the design or construc-
tion of your home, focus on the end result. When your house is finished, do
you want to have a new house that’s devoid of furniture or do you want a
cozy, fully furnished home?
Build the House That Suits the Land
Do you want to eat up your construction budget fast? Try to build a home
with a walkout basement on a lot with no slope. You’ll waste a wad of money
excavating and pushing dirt around. A better idea? Plan your home to fit the
site you have.

If you don’t have much level ground, for instance, design a home with a small
footprint (the amount of space the building occupies on the ground) that
doesn’t spread out for thousands of square feet on the first floor. Or if you do
have a sloped site, you can include that walkout basement in your plans. You
can get livable space for less by taking advantage of your site’s characteristics.
A little bit of forethought goes a long way, of course. If you want to have open
space for a pool, a vegetable garden, or a pasture, look for land that isn’t
completely covered with trees. The costs to prepare your site will be lower,
and you’ll be ready to build sooner.
Make It Tall to Keep Your Budget Small
Time for a quick comparison: Take a 3,000-square-foot ranch-style home and a
three-story home that provides 1,000 square feet on each floor. Which one do
you think offers more size for your cents? In the first home, you have to dig
and build a 3,000-square-foot foundation. In the second home, the foundation
measures only 1,000 square feet. In the first home, the roof must cover 3,000
square feet. In the second, the roof’s surface area is significantly smaller.
Plumbing lines and ducts may need to run much longer distances in the one-
level ranch, adding to material costs and possibly affecting the efficiency of
plumbing, heating, and cooling systems.
Using this oversimplified example, you soon can realize that building a home
“up” is usually less expensive in terms of materials and site-preparation costs
than building a home “out.”
Of course, your lifestyle or your community restrictions may require a one-
story home. But if you have any flexibility, consider stacking your living
spaces to save money.
Keep It Simple and Tasteful
To cut down on construction costs, simplify, simplify, simplify. Take the time
during the design phase to look at your plans with a critical eye (see Chap-
ter 5). Do you really need a home with three-story turrets flanking the front
door, for instance? These rounded structures will add time and money in 
construction costs, and could create a home that looks overdone and out-
of-place with its neighbors.
Opting for a simple roofline (think of the classic lines of Colonial homes)
instead of a complex roofline (like the multitude of peaks and valleys in
today’s McMansions) is a wise cost-cutting move. You can save money during
construction on labor and materials and possibly save in the long run when
it’s time to have the roof replaced.
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Watch out for luxury amenities that can quickly break the bank. Put two
whirlpool tubs in your home, and your budget will begin to bubble up, too.
You’ll need to buy the tubs, increase the size of the bathrooms, and install 
a second water heater just to fill them (not to speak of the maintenance 
costs over the years as expensive pumps burn out and require periodic
replacement).
To help cut costs, avoid anything curved, including ceilings, walls, windows,
and stairways. Keeping everything simple brings an added bonus: Creating a
home with classic lines, traditional good looks, and common-sense amenities
means it should retain its charms year after year and provide good resale
potential.
Use Design Elements to Eliminate 
Costly Materials
Sometimes getting the look you love doesn’t have to break the bank. Granite
countertops, for instance, are an upscale choice for today’s kitchens. If your
budget doesn’t allow for granite, however, you can choose a less expensive
material, such as ceramic tile, and mimic the look of granite.
Another tried-and-true design trick is to keep the ceiling in your entryway
low and then have it lead into a living space with a higher ceiling height. The
entry will feel intimate and warm, and the change in ceiling height will make
the living space feel dramatic. What’s more, you don’t have to worry about
spending money to furnish or light a towering entry hall, and you don’t lose
square footage on the second floor.
As you design your home, you’ll discover that choices you make affect your
budget. For example, say you choose an open floor plan: It could save you
money that would normally be spent framing out interior walls and purchas-
ing and installing interior doors, but it may cost more to frame the structure
of a large, open space. The key is to review your design and construction esti-
mates carefully and ask your designer and contractor plenty of questions
about costs.
Choose and Order Items in Advance
Picture yourself going through the process of designing your home. You’ve
chosen every light fixture, floor covering, doorknob, and window style for
every room. You’ve picked one dishwasher from among hundreds of models.
You’ve finally decided on granite for the countertops. You’ve hit the wall.
327
Chapter 19: Ten Great Ways to Lower Construction Costs

Now, your architect or contractor wants you to choose a tile for your
kitchen’s backsplash (the vertical wall area between the countertop and the
bottom edge of the overhead cabinets). The mere thought of spending
another afternoon looking at samples spikes your blood pressure. “I don’t
care about the tile,” you say through clenched teeth. “Just put in whatever
tile is standard.”
The contractor specifies a builder’s standard tile and provides his cost esti-
mate for your kitchen. All is well until a few months later when you spot a
beautiful hand-painted tile while on vacation. You know the tile would be per-
fect for your backsplash. You tell the contractor where to order it, and sud-
denly the line item for tile on your budget is blown.
What’s the solution to going over budget on item after item? Choose and
order as many fixtures and finishes as possible in advance. When a contrac-
tor or architect is forced to estimate or put in an allowance for an item in
your budget, the budget loses clarity. Put in a couple dozen allowances and
your cost estimates are really just ballpark figures — not a rock-solid price
you can count on.
Use Surplus Materials for an 
Old-Style Home
“If you love old houses,” the saying goes, “build one.” Following the lead of
classic homes can give your new dwelling character and may help you cut
construction costs. Architectural salvage firms are a great resource to find
vintage doors, knobs, ironwork, mantelpieces, and drawer pulls. Adventurous
homeowners seeking a more eclectic look also may have good luck finding
mismatched door and drawer hardware at flea markets or yard sales.
Be a smart shopper, though. Buying old light fixtures may cost more in the
long run if you need to rewire them. Old, primitive windows have plenty of
character but lack the energy efficiency of new window units. If you find an
old window you love, use it in an interior wall, instead. Light can still shine
through it between rooms, and you’ll still be able to enjoy its craftsmanship.
Group Simple Windows 
for a Custom Look
Think you can’t live without a three-story, arched-top window in your new
great room overlooking the golf course? Or perhaps a bay window (one that
juts out from the exterior wall) for your breakfast area is on your must-have
328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

list. When you need to pinch pennies, you may be able to create these
custom window looks with standard, less-expensive window units.
You and your architect or designer can experiment with stacking rectangular
windows of various sizes to create an interesting pattern in your great room
that offers timeless charm. Looking ahead, you may be saving yourself the
hassle of covering round-shaped windows with window treatments, too.
To “fake” a bay window, you can just group two or three windows side by
side. You’ll get almost as much light, without having the expense of framing
out the protruding bay window. You can still have a window seat built in
under the flat windows, or simply place a bench up against that wall when
your home is finished. You’ll even be able to spring for a bevy of beautiful
throw pillows for the bench with the money you save on the windows.
Avoid Change Orders
Yes, changing your mind is your prerogative. But when building your own
home, exercising that prerogative may cost you a pile of dough. Every 
contractor can tell horror stories about the house that got out of hand.
During construction, a homeowner decides to add a swimming pool, put 
in another bathroom, move a wall, or expand a window. Some of these
requests may actually be quite simple in design or concept, but they all have
ramifications — sometimes major — in terms of time and money.
Most builders or general contractors charge for every change order you
request during construction. In addition to the change-order fee, your alter-
ation could cost more in materials or labor. It may also set your construction
timetable back, stretching out your construction loan and increasing the
amount of interest you pay on that loan. The best way to save money during
construction is to stick to the plan you carefully created for the home during
the design phase.
The exception to the rule is when a design error becomes readily apparent
during the building phase. You realize a door blocks a hallway if it’s left open,
for instance, or a recessed light can’t be installed in a ceiling because a duct
is in the way. Obviously, these mistakes require that changes be made to the
original drawings. That’s why your construction loan officer wanted you to
create a contingency fund in your building budget. (See Chapters 8 and 9 for
more information about contingency funds.) You want your fund to cover the
little emergencies that pop up during construction.
If possible, visit your site daily during construction to help you spot potential
design flaws quickly. If you see something that doesn’t work, tell your general
contractor — not the subcontractor’s crew. Your daily visits may also provide
the added benefit of letting subs know you care about the house and appreci-
ate their best work.
329
Chapter 19: Ten Great Ways to Lower Construction Costs

Go Faux
You don’t have to be a wealthy patron to have artful walls in your new home.
With today’s products and tools for homeowners, figuring out how to apply
faux finish techniques is easier than ever. The results are walls that look like
masterpieces but don’t cost a year’s salary.
Start your faux finishing project with a trip to your local paint store. The staff
can recommend techniques to create the look you have in mind — from
Tuscan adobe to washes of tropical pastels. You can add a big splash of char-
acter for a small amount of cash. For example, before you tackle your dining
room walls, buy a small amount of the needed paints or glazes and practice
your technique on a scrap of drywall. If your practice run goes as planned,
then you can invest in all the supplies you need.
Books and magazines offer pages of inspiration for faux finishes. Two books
in particular that can light your way are Decorative Paint and Faux Finishes 
by Linda Selden and Carol Spier (Sunset Books) and The Paint Effects Bible:
100 Recipes for Faux Finishes by Kerry Skinner (Firefly Books, Ltd.).
Get Creative
The key to creativity is to keep an open mind. Remember, just because the
homes you see as you tour local open houses all have formal dining rooms
doesn’t mean you have to spend money to build and furnish a room that you
may never use.
Don’t become so enamored of some high-end finish that you can’t see the
benefits of a lower-priced but perfectly suited alternative. Who knows? Your
choice to use painted wood bead-board to cover your bathroom walls rather
than tile may make you a trendsetter in your neighborhood.
Brainstorm with your family, architect, contractor, and spouse — together
you can come up with ways to cut costs without looking like you’ve cut 
corners.

Chapter 20
Ten Common Stuck-in-the-Middle
Problems and Their Fixes
In This Chapter
 Dealing with scheduling problems
 Solving money issues
 Keeping everything sane
W
hen building your custom home, the question isn’t whether problems
will occur during the project, but when and how you will handle them.
In this chapter, we list the most common problems and give you some solu-
tions to help.
My Home Is Behind Schedule
Even the most thought-out schedules are estimates at best. Mother Nature
and other difficulties, such as late materials and labor shortages, can put a
building project behind schedule in a hurry. Weekly communication with
your contractor can keep you apprised of the progress. Make your first ques-
tion at every meeting “Are we running on time?” If the answer is no, then dis-
cuss options such as rescheduling subcontractors.
If your project is encountering a significant delay, that holdup can often affect
the availability of the subs. (For example, the plumber can’t exactly install
the kitchen faucets if the carpenter hasn’t installed the cabinetry.) Discuss the
situation with your contractor. Communicate your concerns and financial
risks. Talk about workable solutions, such as the option of using alternative
subs. Doing so may help you get the project done on time. The risk is that the
contractor may not have as good of a relationship with the new sub, and the
project could suffer in the quality of workmanship.
If your contractor isn’t responsive to your needs, then you need to have a
heart-to-heart conversation with him and review your contract’s terms. If the

contractor is being negligent per the contract’s terms, you may need to dis-
cuss changing contractors. However, taking this step should be a last-resort
issue at best. (See Chapter 11 for more detailed information on contracts and
remedies.)
Ultimately, you don’t want to rush the project. As long as you keep in mind
the cost of any lender penalties (discussed in the following section as well as
in Chapter 10), a couple of extra months isn’t worth cutting corners on a
house that will last lifetimes.
My Construction Loan Is Expiring 
and the House Isn’t Complete
Don’t bury your head in the sand now if your construction loan is about to
expire and your house isn’t complete. You need to remain calm and resolute.
Most construction loans carry some sort of penalty for going over the allot-
ted time limit. Although these penalties can be steep, they often can be 
negotiable.
After the project is underway and you detect a problem, start the conversa-
tion with your lender as soon as possible. Because your lender may charge
you a smaller penalty for one single extension, estimate a time of completion
and negotiate a specific time for completion. After you’re past your deadline,
taking it month by month may make your lender concerned, and your lender
will be more likely to charge you the full penalty amounts.
Discuss with your lender the minimum work required to roll the construction
loan into a permanent loan so you can finish as soon as possible. Often you
may be able to put some work off (such as landscaping and finishing work)
until after the construction loan is rolled into permanent financing as dis-
cussed in Chapter 15.
My Contractor Wants More Money 
in a Fixed-Price Contract
A fixed-price contract exists when the contractor has given you a set price and
is responsible for all the expenses with the remainder being his profit. You
can read more about this in Chapter 11. When a fixed-price custom home pro-
ject goes over budget, it’s either because the contractor’s estimate was too
low or because the consumer keeps making changes to the original plans.
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

If you find yourself in this position, carefully review the terms of your con-
tract and discuss options with your contractor. The solution depends on
what blew the budget:
 The contractor made mistakes. If your contractor underestimated the
project, sit down with her to renegotiate. Don’t play the blame game
right away. Get to the root of the problem and discuss how the contrac-
tor can assure you of resolving those problems in the future.
If the contractor is in breach of contract due to her mistakes, it still may
be in your best interest to negotiate a fee for finishing that you can both
live with. If she’s losing money, she may cut corners where you can’t see
them or, worse, file bankruptcy and leave you hanging with a half-finished
house. Some people consider involving attorneys in these negotiations.
Be careful; attorneys can add intimidation and fear to an already stressed
environment and can easily escalate the situation into an adversarial
disaster. It also may be cheaper to pay your contractor than to cover the
attorney’s fees.
 You made more change requests than your contract allowed. Your
requests for changes in the original plans are called change orders and
they are your issue. (See Chapter 11 for more on change orders.) The
contractor can’t absorb the cost of you changing the project every week.
Fortunately, you have direct control with change orders. Consistent
communication can prevent sticker shock at the end. Discuss the time
and cost of each change before the contractor begins the process. If the
contractor has already made the changes and you find yourself looking
at the bill you didn’t expect, you’re probably on the hook, and you’ll
need to cover these changes out of your own pocket.
The bottom line is you want to keep the project moving no matter what the
issue. Often, delays that concern costs end up causing more problems and
expenses than the actual cost increases themselves.
Everything Costs More Than My Budget
in a Time-and-Materials Contract
A time-and-materials contract exists when you’re responsible for all the mater-
ial and labor expenses, and the contractor makes his money as an additional
percentage of the total cost. (You can read more about this contract type in
Chapter 11.) As you can imagine, “everything costing more than I thought,” is
the most common complaint in the custom home–building world. Estimating
a construction project can be very challenging when you consider the huge
list of materials and labor involved. Even the most experienced contractors
can’t account for all the variables involved.
333
Chapter 20: Ten Common Stuck-in-the-Middle Problems and Their Fixes

When costs are your financial responsibility, the best way to deal with cost
overruns is to keep a close watch on them. Weekly communication with your
contractor can keep the overruns from getting out of hand. If you do notice an
overrun problem, you can discuss options on reducing expenses later in the
project if possible. Having access to extra cash can help solve the immediate
problem when it arises. For more about the need for cash, read Chapter 7.
The Bank Won’t Fund the Draws
Usually you encounter the problem of the bank not funding the draws, or
requests for money, when the percentage of your house that has been com-
pleted isn’t relative to the percentage of funds you have taken from the bank.
In other words, if you have requested 50 percent of the money and the bank
says the house is 40 percent complete, you may have difficulty getting the
bank to cough up the other 10 percent. We explain the fund disbursement
process in more detail in Chapter 10.
Again, communication is key. The bank will ultimately fund you all of any sec-
tion, such as foundation or framing (see Chapters 12 and 13), when complete,
but you have to get the sections complete first. Arrange for a phone meeting
with the bank and contractor. Make sure that everyone is in agreement about
what stage the project is in. If you can’t pry any money loose from the bank,
make arrangements with your contractor to get to the next payment stage. If
you have cash or credit available, you should be able to easily resolve the
issue by paying for things yourself until you and the bank agree on the per-
centage of completion. In the final stages, incomplete paperwork, such as lien
releases explained in Chapter 11, can cause delays, so be sure to keep your
records readily available as we advise in Chapter 2.
I’m Out of Cash
Running out of cash is a dangerous problem to have in a construction pro-
ject. It usually stems from a combination of poor planning and putting too
much cash into the project upfront. If you do run out of cash, try the follow-
ing possible resources for cash. However, understand that these resources
also have their drawbacks if you’re attempting to solve a long-term cost over-
run issue, as we discuss in the previous sections in this chapter, rather than
just a temporary cash flow issue.
 Credit cards: You can reimburse yourself after the project pays off, so
don’t be shy, charge it!
 Friends and family: You’re borrowing a short-term loan, and who are
you going to be entertaining in your new home? Let them share in all the
joys of custom home ownership.
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Home equity loans: If you haven’t already tapped the equity in your cur-
rent personal residence, now is the time. You’ll likely sell the house
when finished anyway.
 Retirement accounts, such as 401k or stock/margin accounts: Borrow 
if you can, liquidate only if you have to as a last resort. Margin accounts
are credit lines secured against stock accounts. Because they’re
secured, the interest rates are generally low, but you could risk having to
repay them in a hurry if your stock shares devalue. Liquidation of any
retirement accounts could result in penalties and taxes, so be sure to
consult your accountant and financial advisor before taking action.
Remember that your first priority is to keep the project moving. Otherwise
you risk losing all your investment and your credit. As soon as the house is
finished, you have many options on how to repay the cash you borrowed, as
we discuss in Chapter 16.
The House Is Having Some Engineering
Problems
As soon as the build has started, enduring engineering problems related 
to technical, structural design is always a tough situation. Luckily, most 
engineering issues are relatively small, or they’re caught in the plan check
process we discuss in Chapter 6. If you have a major issue, such as a founda-
tion that won’t support the weight or a structural wall that needs to be
moved, you need to immediately communicate with the architect, contractor,
and lender to determine a plan to resolve it. Often the solution requires some
form of redesign and new approval of the changed plans with the building
department.
Most often a minor engineering issue will simply create a delay or expense. 
If you start to have several small issues come up, taking the plans to another
engineer for a second opinion may be worthwhile to go through the plans
with a fine-tooth comb. This way you can get all the potential problems
cleared at one time and move on with the project. Too many separate delays
and cost increases can take their toll and create other problems that we
address in this chapter.
My Contractor and I Can’t Get Along
Sadly the problem of a contractor and a homeowner not getting along isn’t 
as uncommon as you may think. Face it, in life, making friends and hiring
employees is hard enough. When you selected a contractor, you picked 
335
Chapter 20: Ten Common Stuck-in-the-Middle Problems and Their Fixes

someone with whom you thought you could trust your life’s savings and who
exhibited good craftsmanship and excellent management skills. Furthermore,
you selected someone who you hoped you were compatible with in your
work methods in stressful situations. Finding someone who met all those
requirements was a big challenge.
Work hard to put personal emotions aside. Always remember that you and
the contractor have the same objective of getting the house finished on time
and on budget in a quality manner. Be willing to sacrifice personal ego and
correctness for getting to the objective. The contractor won’t be in your life
after the house is finished, but you’ll live with the home (and the emotional
experience) that got you there for years to come.
My Contractor Walked Off the Job
This problem can translate to time and money if you don’t act quickly. Unless
your contractor left for reasons unrelated to your project, don’t attempt to
reengage him. Chances are if he walked out on you, the communication was
past the point of repair. You can reconcile the money and breach of contract
issues later as we outline in Chapter 11. Depending upon your lender, you
may be able to take over the helm and act as your own general contractor. If
that option isn’t possible, then you need to work with the lender to find a
contractor soon. Try the contractors you interviewed before to see if they
have availability.
If the house is fairly far along in construction, you may be able to find a
smaller remodeling contractor to finish the job. Although getting bids will be
important, you don’t have the option to be too picky about price. Look for a
contractor that can step in and do quality work. Of course you need to inves-
tigate the contractor in the same basic ways we suggest in Chapter 2. You
may need to compromise on issues such as price and timeline to get the
house back on track for completion.
This Project Is Breaking Up My Marriage
Building a custom home can take its toll on family and relationships. Keep
your cool. Find ways to communicate and make the project fun to work on.
Kevin has been giving this advice to his clients for more than a decade and
only one of the hundreds of projects he has funded ever ended up in divorce.
If things do get tough, focus more attention on your relationships and let
your contractor take over more of the day-to-day operations and worry on
your custom home project. If things get really tough, then by all means seek
out marriage counseling before you get past the point of no return.

Ten Helpful Custom Home
Resources
In This Chapter
 Looking for land and financing
 Examining design resources
 Finding associations
 Exploring owner-builder options
 Going environmental
You can never have enough extra resources when embarking on a custom
home project. In this chapter we give you a few handy resources for
finding land and arranging your financing as well as listing the major associa-
tions that work with custom home people. We also list some of our favorite
specialty resources for owner-builders, log homes, and environmental help.
Land Sources
Lotfinders (www.lotfinders.com) is an Internet resource focused specifi-
cally on helping the consumer find land to build a custom home. The Web
site focuses on education and then on listing resources and instructions for
hunting down properties. Lotfinders works with developers to publicize
properties for sale. They also help prospective homebuilders to identify
landowners with property not listed. They have direct resources for lot
financing as well.
Other resources for finding land also on the Internet include
 www.Realtor.com: This site can get you to any land listed in the
Multiple Listing Service.
 www.land.net: This site has a large database of land for sale as well,
although much of it is commercial land or raw land, which is land that’s
not prepared for building, which we define further in Chapter 3.

Stratford Financial Services
No company has been more dedicated to real estate financing education than
Stratford Financial Services (www.customhomeexperts.com). In its 15-year
history, the company has financed thousands of homes and more than 800
custom home projects. Its Web site has tons of custom home articles and
essays designed to keep consumers from making costly mistakes when
financing real estate. The site offers expert information on custom home
financing, purchase money, refinancing, as well as groundbreaking informa-
tion about owning rental properties.
Founded by Kevin in 1989, Stratford is also a one-stop resource for lot and con-
struction financing. As a broker specializing in construction loans, the com-
pany can assess your situation and help you determine which lenders have the
best programs for you. The company’s expert staff can keep you from making
costly mistakes by going direct, as we outline in Chapters 8 and 9.
Log and Timber Frame Homes
Two publishing companies serve as the best all-around resources for log 
and timber home enthusiasts. Our favorite is Goodman Media, publisher 
of Log Homes Illustrated magazine and Timber Homes Illustrated magazine 
(no, they don’t have a swimsuit edition). Log on www.loghomesillustrated.
com for more information. Janice is the editor of Timber Homes Illustrated, so
you know you’re getting solid custom home help. Log Homes Illustrated is
committed to bringing Kevin’s insightful information to you each and every
month to help you with the most challenging part of custom home building.
This company also produces a large number of log home shows nationwide
under the name Log Home Expo. These shows are a must for the log home
newbie. You can also find the schedule at the Web site.
The other company that provides resources for log and timber home enthusi-
asts is Log Home Authority (www.loghomeauthority.com), which has two
major magazines that service the log home industry. Log Home Living and 
Log Home Design Ideas are excellent supplements for the log home informa-
tion hound. This company is the other major producer of log shows.
If you’re like most loggies, you can’t get enough information and pictures
about log homes, so there’s no reason not to subscribe to all four magazines
in this section. Often the different perspectives can help you determine
what’s right for you.

Finished Plans
Since 1907, The Garlinghouse Company has served as America’s premier 
publisher of home plan books and project plans. Its Web site (www.garling
house.com) is a great online resource. Garlinghouse provides great informa-
tion for converting bought plans into approved plans. Hanley Wood is also a
good resource. You can find Hanley Wood’s plans online at www.eplans.com
and www.dreamhomesource.com.
Not only can you pick from hundreds of thousands of plans to buy online, 
but you can also peruse local bookstores for plan magazines such as Good
Housekeeping Home Plans from Hanley Wood and 1295 Best-Selling Home
Plans published by Garlinghouse. Even if you don’t buy the plans, the maga-
zines can be excellent resources to help you explore what you like and don’t
like.
Hanley Wood also publishes a number of trade magazines for the building
industry. If you’re interested in seeing things from your contractor’s perspec-
tive, check out Builder magazine or Custom Home magazine. These magazines
are also great resources for suppliers. If you don’t see these magazines in the
bookstore, you can check out the selection at www.hanleywood.com.
Home Depot Expo
When you’re in the market for appliances, fixtures, and cabinetry ideas, there
is no better showcase open to the public than Home Depot Expo. This store
exhibits an amazing designer showcase where you can see how bathrooms
and kitchens come together. Whether or not you buy anything really isn’t
important. What is important is that you can check out different designs to
see what your likes and dislikes are. (For example, you have a ton of deci-
sions to make on fixtures, as we show you in Chapter 5. A day at Expo with a
pencil and digital camera can save you evenings on the Internet and billable
hours with your architect.) Log on to www.expo.com to find a design center
near you.
American Institute of Architects (AIA)
If you want to know all about architects, the American Institute of Architects
(AIA) is the place to start. You can go to the AIA Web site (www.aia.org) to
read up on the subject of architects and the public. You can also search the
architect-finder service by location. The AIA has local offices in most major
cities, which can be a great resource for meeting architects in person.
339
Chapter 21: Ten Helpful Custom Home Resources

National Association of Home Builders
(NAHB)
At first glance, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) Web site
(www.nahb.org) looks to be for builders only. It deserves a closer look. You
can find plenty of consumer information about builders and the building
process spread throughout the site. The site has detailed explanations of the
building process and listings of trade shows that you can attend to see build-
ing materials and processes. Kevin’s favorite is the Pacific Coast Builders
Conference (PCBC) held in San Francisco every June.
Also connected with NAHB is the Custom Home Builders Council, which
focuses on the issues important to the custom home-building industry. For
owner-builders (see the next section) or those of you with large complicated
projects, you may find the NAHB a useful peer group. 
One other resource is www.homebuilder.com, which is a consumer site con-
nected with NAHB. It’s a decent source for information and houses a referral
source for finding contractors.
For Owner-Builders
If you’re considering being an owner-builder, which we discuss briefly in
Chapter 1, you can utilize two strong resources for owner-builders not quite
looking to do it all themselves. U-Build-It (www.ubuildit.com) is a set of
franchised dealers that educate and consult with you through the entire con-
struction process. They become your advisor and advocate at each stage.
Many of their franchisees are former builders and contractors. They do
charge fees but are generally less than hiring a contractor.
The other resource, Complete Owner Builder Services (COBS; www.cobs
homes.com), is a one-stop shop for owner-builders. Based in San Diego, 
COBS combines its expertise along with supplier relationships, such as Home
Depot, to help you save money and achieve your goals in the owner-builder
process. The COBS approach is to start with the finances, which we certainly
approve, but you aren’t obligated to use its lender.
Building Green
Building Green provides authoritative, independent information on environ-
mentally responsible design and construction. You can gain insight and infor-
mation to share with your builder. Building Green’s resources include

Wild Ones Native Plant Landscaping
Started in Milwaukee in 1977, this 50-chapter organization promotes environ-
mentally sound landscaping practices incorporating the use of native plants
in landscaping for houses and buildings. If you’re interested in native plant
landscaping, check out Wild Ones at www.for-wild.org.
Why go native? Because native plants evolved and adapted to local condi-
tions over thousands of years, so they’re more vigorous and hardy. Also, they
can more easily survive harsh weather conditions. After native plants take
root, they require little or no irrigation or fertilization. They’re more pest and
disease resistant. Native plants are perfect for low-maintenance gardening
and landscaping. And they bring original beauty back to regional areas. Need
we say more?

Ten Ways to Make 
Your Home Green
In This Chapter
 Saving the earth and saving your money
 Using sustainable-design professionals
N
o matter what color your new home will be on the outside, you can
make it green inside. The best way to make your home green, or envi-
ronmentally friendly, is to design it that way to start. Look for ways to reuse,
recycle, and reduce as you design and build. Talk with your contractor, archi-
tect, or designer about your desires for a green home. With any luck, these
building professionals can rise to the challenge. If your requests meet with
blank stares or eye rolling, consider choosing new team members.
Keep in mind that each of the tips in this chapter is merely a door into a
much larger topic. If one of these ideas sparks your interest, utilize the help-
ful resources provided to find more information.
Making the Best Use of Your Lot
If you haven’t purchased your land yet, you have a great opportunity to
create a home that makes the earth happy. Look for a site that requires mini-
mal excavation and earth moving. Choose a spot that won’t expose your
home to extreme elements.
After you find the perfect spot, work with your designer or architect to 
put your home in the best possible place on the site. For general resources
and information on siting your home, go to www.buildinggreen.com and
read Chapter 5.

Avoiding an Oversized House
You’ve scrimped and saved for your new house. Now you’re ready to blow all
your money on a home that can only be described as massive. Remember
that building a huge home is going to make a big impression — and not just
on your neighbors. Every square foot you put into your home will cost you
and, in the long run, the environment. In general, bigger homes require
 More disruption of land during construction
 More energy to heat and cool
 More maintenance and cleaning
 More raw materials to build
To help keep your square footage down to earth, take a long hard look at
your true needs and desires during the design phase (see Chapter 5). Do you
really need a two-story foyer in your new home? Or would that space be
better used as an extra closet or an office area on the second floor? A good
clearinghouse for information on keeping home sizes reasonable is the Web
site www.notsobighouse.com, a spin-off of the book The Not So Big House: A
Blueprint for the Way We Really Live by architect Sarah Susanka (Taunton
Press).
Planning for the Ages
You can make your home green by keeping the future in mind as you build.
Making good long-term choices can result in environmentally friendly results.
For instance, imagine that you’re nearing the end of your construction pro-
ject and running short on cash. You decide to carpet your upstairs bedrooms
instead of putting down hardwood because carpet is less expensive, and you
figure you can always replace the carpeting in a few years with something
more durable. The yards of inexpensive carpet you install can give off
unhealthy fumes and quickly look shoddy. When you remove that carpet, it
goes straight to the landfill.
For information on environmentally friendly products, log on to www.
oikos.com.
Making Your Landscape Earth-Friendly
Your home’s landscape can do its part for the environment, too. Trees, 
especially, are worth their weight in gold. (To see the many benefits trees
344
Part V: The Part of Tens 

offer, check out the National Arbor Day Foundation’s Web site at www.arbor
day.org.)
If you live in a region with four seasons, choose deciduous trees, such as
maples and oaks, that can shade your home in the hottest months, and then
lose their leaves and allow sun to warm your home in the winter. If your new
home will be in an area that stays warm year-round, look to evergreen trees
and shrubs that offer continuous shade, especially for your home’s sunny
southern and western exposures.
Choosing low-maintenance shrubs and plants that require little fertilization
and watering is also kinder to the environment. Reducing the amount of lawn,
which has to be mowed, fertilized, and watered, is a significant step forward
in keeping your home green.
Your landscape can be friendly to other living things, too. Many people enjoy
planting flowers and trees that attract butterflies and birds, and help sustain
other small animals. For information on creating a backyard wildlife habitat,
go to www.nwf.org/backyardwildlifehabitat.
Using Alternative Energy Sources
Do you remember the time when only back-to-the-land hippies heated their
homes and water with solar power? Now, with today’s technological innova-
tions, harnessing the sun’s power to make your home more livable and
energy efficient is much easier. Keep in mind that, in general, installing a solar
system costs more than tapping into a public electric utility, but you’ll enjoy
the benefits of a nonpolluting, quiet, and renewable source of energy. And, if
you build your new home in an area that’s far away from the public utility
grid, solar or alternative energy systems may cost less than running exces-
sively long utility lines. Be aware, however, as we state in Chapter 9, that
most lenders don’t make loans on houses that are not on the public power
grid.
If you want to ease into solar power, look to passive solar heating for your
home. A passive system allows for the home to absorb the sun’s warmth
during the day, and then release the warmth back into the home during the
evening. To work, the system may only require a bank of south-facing win-
dows located near a heat sink. This heat sink is typically a mass of masonry,
such as a tall stone chimney or a thick concrete floor, that the sun gently
warms during daylight hours. The masonry naturally radiates the warmth
through the nearby space. (A supplemental heating system may be needed to
warm other parts of the house.)
345
Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Make Your Home Green

If you’re building in a warm or hot climate, you don’t want to inadvertently
create a passive solar heating situation that will make you uncomfortably
warm inside. As you design your home, avoid large banks of windows with
southern or western exposure that can channel the sun’s heat into your
home, forcing you to waste energy on cooling.
With a bit more investment (and the blessing of your local building codes 
and neighborhood restrictions), you can create a solar heating system with
photovoltaic panels (devices that convert the energy of sunlight into electric
energy) on your property or your home’s roof. Newer panels are smaller than
ever — some roof shingles today incorporate photovoltaic cells. With a solar
power system, you can create energy for your home using a truly renewable
resource. The cost of these systems varies from region to region. For more
information, talk to a local solar energy contractor or visit www.mysolar.
com. The Rocky Mountain Institute also offers informative briefs on solar
power, which you can download at www.rmi.org.
Of course, the sun isn’t the only alternative source of energy. You can also
capture the power of wind or water to make your home more livable. Each of
these alternative energy systems requires certain conditions. For example, a
hydro-powered system needs a body of water, of course, and a wind-powered
system only works on a site that offers dependable and accessible air move-
ment. So if you plan to use one of these systems, keep their requirements in
mind as you look for land to purchase.
Talk to your architect or designer or speak with an alternative energy profes-
sional to find out more information. You can also find tons of info on the
Internet. A few places to start include www.realgoods.com and www.solar
livinginstitute.com.
Going On an Energy Diet
A great way to save energy is to simply use less of it. Plan ahead to create a
home that sips energy instead of guzzles it.
Talk with your architect, lighting designer, or general contractor about a
whole-house lighting plan. A whole-house system can allow you to program
your home’s light fixtures to go on or off at certain times, based on your
family’s needs, and can allow you to turn off lights throughout the home with
a single switch. A master switch means you’re less likely to leave lights on
when they’re no longer needed.
Another way to use less energy is to reach for the stars — Energy Stars, that
is. The government’s Energy Star program identifies products designed and
built to be energy efficient. Choose windows, appliances, fixtures, and even
building products for your home that have earned a thumbs-up from the 
program.
346
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You can find out more about the federal government’s Energy Star program
by visiting www.energystar.gov. For more information on building an
energy-efficient, weather-tight home, go to www.rmi.org.
Cutting the Fumes
Help the earth and your family by choosing paints, stains, and finishes with
low volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These materials give off fewer harm-
ful gases and fumes and make your home more pleasant and healthy.
Most paint stores now offer low VOC paints. You need to ask cabinet makers
and furniture makers about the possibility of using low VOC finishes on their
products. Talk to your architect or contractor about ways to reduce VOCs
and other harmful gases such as carbon monoxide in your home.
For tips on maintaining healthy air quality in your home, go to the American
Lung Association’s Web site at www.lungusa.org.
Making Recycling Easy
If you consider recycling your family’s glass, aluminum, and plastic a hassle,
more than likely you don’t do it. However, keeping your home green by sepa-
rating your trash isn’t that difficult, and you can do your small part for the
environment.
Build a recycling center in your new kitchen or garage and plan for a place to
store cans, bottles, paper, and containers. For example, one ingenious idea
employed recently involved creating a trio of chutes cut through a kitchen
wall and into an adjacent garage. Each chute emptied into a tub. With this
setup, recycling simply involved tossing a can or bottle down the appropriate
chute and carrying the full tubs in the garage to the curbside for pickup. If
the chutes are too much for you (or if cutting chutes in your garage wall
would violate fire code requirements in your area), make sure you save a
little extra space in your kitchen, pantry, or garage to store simple recycling
receptacles.
Some rural communities don’t offer recycling pickup. If recycling is important
to you, ask about pickup services or drop-off centers when you’re purchasing
your land.
The National Recycling Coalition’s Web site offers more information about
recycling. Go to www.nrc-recycle.org.
347
Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Make Your Home Green

Using What You Have
Recycling and reducing are great ideas, but so is reusing. As you go through
the design process, consider how you can furnish some rooms with pieces
you already own. Some may work as is, others may need reupholstering; but
in the long run, you can save money and cut down on the resources required
for creating new furnishings.
Selecting salvaged architectural items, such as interior doors, mantels, bricks,
and doorknobs, is another good way to keep items out of the landfill and give
some charm to your new home. Keep in mind that although old salvaged win-
dows will give your home character, primitive window units probably won’t
provide the kind of energy efficiency that makes good environmental sense.
For example, if you find a vintage window you love, use it in an interior, parti-
tion wall, or have its glass replaced with mirrors and hang it over your mantel
or in your entryway.
You can find architectural salvage companies in your area by looking through
your local phone book. Other companies that specialize in salvaging old
house parts advertise in specialized periodicals such as Old House Journal.
The magazine’s Web site is www.oldhousejournal.com.
Stashing and Storing
Growing your own food is a beneficial choice for the environment. With a suc-
cessful garden, you can cut trips to the grocery store and eat fresher, health-
ier foods.
If a vegetable garden is in the plan for your new home, be sure you also
create space to store your harvest. Earth-sheltered pantries and root cellars
can keep food cool and dry. For information about building these storage
areas, go to www.greenhomebuilding.com.
Think you have a black thumb and could never grow your own food? You can
still plan ahead to decrease the number of trips to the grocery by creating
pantries and storage areas in your home for provisions bought in bulk. When
designing your home, build a pantry or two in your kitchen. Also consider
adding outbuildings that could offer cool, dry, and critter-free storage for
food, beverages, or other supplies.
