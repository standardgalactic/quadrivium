About the Authors
Ed McCarthy and Mary Ewing-Mulligan are two wine lovers who 
met at an Italian wine tasting in New York City’s Chinatown and 
subsequently merged their wine cellars and wine libraries when 
they married. California Wine For Dummies is the seventh wine 
book that they co-authored in the For Dummies series — including 
the best-selling Wine For Dummies and two of their favorites, French 
Wine For Dummies and Italian Wine For Dummies. They also wrote 
Wine Style: Using Your Senses to Explore and Enjoy Wine (Wiley) in 
2005. Together, they have taught hundreds of wine classes, visited 
nearly every wine region in the world, run five marathons, and 
raised 12 cats. Along the way, they amassed more than a half a cen-
tury of wine experience between them.
Mary is president of International Wine Center, a New York City 
school for wine professionals and serious wine lovers. As U.S. direc-
tor of the Wine & Spirit Education Trust (WSET), the world’s lead-
ing wine-education organization, she works to make the courses 
she offers in New York available in more and more parts of the 
United States. She is also a freelance wine writer. Mary’s most 
impressive credential is that she was the first female Master of 
Wine (MW) in the United States and currently is one of only 26 MWs 
in the U.S. (with 277 MWs worldwide).
Ed, a New Yorker, graduated from the City University of New York 
with a master’s degree in psychology. He taught high school 
English in another life, while working part time in wine shops to sat-
isfy his passion for wine and to subsidize his growing wine cellar. In 
1999, Ed went solo as author of Champagne For Dummies, a topic on 
which he’s especially expert. He is contributing editor of Beverage 
Media, a trade publication. Both Ed and Mary are also columnists 
for the online wine magazine WineReviewOnline.com and are 
Certified Wine Educators.
When they aren’t writing, teaching, or visiting wine regions, Mary 
and Ed maintain a busy schedule of speaking, judging at wine com-
petitions, and tasting as many new wines as possible. They admit to 
leading thoroughly unbalanced lives in which their only non-wine 
pursuits are hiking in the Berkshires and the Italian Alps. At home, 
they wind down to the tunes of k.d. Lang, Sarah Brightman, Bob 
Dylan, and Neil Young in the company of their feline roommates, 
Dolcetto, Max, Ponzi, and Pinot.

Introduction
D
o California wines need demystifying? At one time, we 
believed they didn’t. In a universe of wines with complicated 
foreign-language place names, California’s wines, named for their 
grape varieties, were a beacon of simplicity, welcoming uninitiated 
wine drinkers to the pleasures of wine.
These days, California wines are still welcoming (they don’t get to 
dominate wine consumption in the U.S. by being difficult to enjoy!), 
but the number of wineries in California has exploded to more than 
2,000, and the map of wine regions has expanded to include pock-
ets of vineyard land that were literally off the map only 15 years 
ago. What’s more, California now grows dozens of grape varieties 
beyond its traditional Big Six mainstays for fine wine.
California wine is still easy to understand, but scratch the surface, 
and you can discover a wealth of fascinating nuances. Nuances of 
climate, of grape varieties and clones (subvarieties), of vineyard 
soils and altitudes and proximity to the sea, of winemaking beliefs 
and goals — each of these enriches the landscape of California 
wine and the drinking pleasures that it holds.
California today is truly a land of opportunity for wine lovers. 
Come discover it with us.
About This Book
Over the past few years, we came to realize that a serious gap 
existed in our Wine For Dummies series — California! This gap is 
especially gaping when you consider that almost 70 percent of all 
the wine consumed in the U.S. is California wine. This book is our 
attempt to fill that gap and to help you complete your wine knowl-
edge and increase your wine-drinking pleasure.
You probably drink California wine already, because wines from 
California are the top-selling wines in the U.S. Could you find other 
wines from California — other grape varieties, other tastes — that 
you might enjoy even more than what you already know? We bet 
you can. Will discovering the various wine regions that specialize 
in making your favorite type of wine increase your appreciation of 

California Wine For Dummies  
2
the wine? We hope so. We hope that our passion and the passion 
of our favorite winemakers will become contagious so that you can 
find your own passion for California wines.
In every other For Dummies wine book that we’ve written, we took 
a geographic approach to the wines, moving from one wine region 
to the next and discussing the kinds of wines that you find in 
each. In California Wine For Dummies, however, we take a different 
approach. We move from grape variety to grape variety, because 
that’s the structure we’re accustomed to in approaching California 
wines. Within each grape-variety chapter, we discuss the regions 
of California that grow that variety and the signature each region 
gives to the taste of the wine.
Of course, we also name our favorite producers for each type of 
wine. Because California makes wines at every price level, from 
affordable to downright luxury pricing, we give our wine recom-
mendations in specific price ranges — including top wines to try in 
the under-$15 category.
Conventions Used in This Book
Here are a few conventions you should be familiar with as you read 
this book:
 
✓ New terms appear in italics and are followed by brief, easy-to-
understand definitions.
 
✓ Web addresses appear in a particular typeface called 
monofont.
 
✓ Keywords in bulleted lists appear in boldface.
 
✓ In pronunciations, the stressed syllable is italicized. (Note: 
French words technically don’t have stressed syllables.)
In making our specific wine recommendations throughout this 
book, we usually divide the wines into three price categories. We 
use the wines’ average retail prices as the basis for placing them 
in each category, to the extent that we’re able to determine that 
from Internet listings; in some stores, the wines cost more, and in 
restaurants, they tend to cost at least two to three times the retail 
price. The prices we use are based on the currently available vin-
tages at the time of our writing this book; subsequent vintages and 
older wines can cost more.

 Introduction
3
The actual price ranges we use vary slightly from wine to wine, but 
here are the general categories:
 
✓ Moderately priced: Wines that retail for less than $20
 
✓ Moderate-plus: Wines that retail between $20 and $50
 
✓ High-end: Wines that retail mainly between $50 and $100
We list the actual average retail prices for individual wines that cost 
over $100. In rare situations, when we recommend several wines 
over $100, we categorize them as Luxury wines. You’ll also see some 
sidebars naming some top-value wines that cost under $15.
Other “rules” that we apply in our listings of recommended wines 
include the following:
 
✓ Within each price category, we alphabetize our recommended 
wines according to the names of the producers. Sometimes 
we list more than one recommended wine per producer.
 
✓ After every wine, we indicate, in parentheses, the American 
Viticultural Area (AVA) or other location where the grapes 
grow; this might or might not be the same as the location of 
the winery.
 
✓ When the name of a particular wine isn’t the name of a vine-
yard, we place the name of the wine in quotation marks.
 
✓ We do not include small-production wines that are available 
only in California. (We do, however, recommend some small-
production wines that have limited national distribution. We 
suggest that you check www.wine-searcher.com to help you 
find the retail stores where the wine is available and to 
comparison-shop for the lowest prices.)
Finally, any given lodging or meal prices might have changed since 
publication. Visit Web sites or contact the hotel or restaurant in 
question for the most up-to-date information.
What You’re Not to Read
Because we wrote this book, we obviously believe that every single 
bit of information will be useful to you. But you might not care to 
know the same level of detail as we care to give. The Technical 
Stuff icon marks details or background explanation that you can 
ignore, if you like, or come back to later when you have more time.

Likewise, our sidebars amount to color commentary on the text; 
you can skip over these gray boxes if you want to know just the 
facts. Some sidebars offer basic background information about 
wine specifically for readers who feel their wine basics could use 
some brushing up.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, we had to make some assumptions about you, 
the reader. We assume that
 
✓ You drink wine already or are interested in becoming a wine 
drinker.
 
✓ You already know something about wine. But just in case you 
don’t, we use simple language and explain things clearly, and 
we include fundamental information such as what wine is and 
how to taste it. (For more thorough coverage of the basics, 
check out our other book, Wine For Dummies, 4th Edition 
[Wiley].)
 
✓ You’re looking for more than a travel guide. You might also 
want information on California wine history, characteristics 
of wines from certain regions, or recommendations for spe-
cific wines. Of course, if you are looking for travel info, we do 
include some text from Frommer’s Portable California Wine 
Country, 5th Edition, by Erika Lenkert (Wiley), as well as some 
of our own suggestions for hotels, restaurants, and wine coun-
try attractions.
How This Book Is Organized
We divide this book into five parts, which we describe here. This 
part structure allows you easy access to the information you need, 
whether you want to know about California wine in general, the 
state’s most popular wines, or some of its more minor (but still 
excellent) players.

 Introduction
5
Part I: The Big Picture 
of California Wine
In this meaty section, we give you the lay of the land for California 
wines, both historically and geographically. We explain how 
California names its wines, how the state’s vast vineyard areas 
break down into specific regions known as AVAs, and how to rec-
ognize a wine’s AVA and other important phrases on a label.
Chapter 1 provides an overview of California wine today — the 
range of wines that California makes and how California’s geogra-
phy makes the wines unique — and then it looks back in time to 
the origins of today’s wine scene in the Golden State. Chapter 2 
reveals what a varietal is and what varietal wines represent (or 
don’t) in terms of quality; it also explains the exceptions, wines that 
are blends of various grape varieties. Finally, it provides snapshot 
descriptions of California’s main white and red grape varieties.
Chapter 3 in effect is a line-by-line explanation of the language of 
a California wine label. Chapter 4 gets down and dirty: It covers 
all the major wine regions of California, telling you what’s special 
about each, from the soil to the climate to the types of wine the 
region makes.
Part II: The Headliners
The four chapters in this part cover the six varietal wines that 
you most need to know about to be fluent in California wine: 
Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot 
Noir, and Zinfandel. For each type of wine, we explain the vari-
ous regions where the grapes for that wine grow, we describe the 
taste of the wine, we profile a few storied producers, and we name 
our recommended brands in several different price categories — 
including special-value wines under $15.

Part III: More Reds, Whites, 
Pinks, and Bubblies
Yes, there’s more — much more! California makes a tempting range 
of white and red wines from grape varieties that are more obscure 
than the main six covered in Part II, as well as fascinating blended 
white and red wines inspired by the wines of classic European 
wine regions. We cover those wines in this part of the book, along 
with California’s rosé (pink) wines, sparkling wines, and sweet 
dessert wines. In Chapter 9, you read about Pinot Grigio/Pinot 
Gris, white Rhône-style wines, Riesling, and other white wines. 
Chapter 10 introduces you to Syrah/Shiraz, Petite Sirah, red Rhone-
style blends, and Italian-inspired blends. And Chapter 11 covers 
California’s sparkling wines, rosé wines, and sweet wines.
Part IV: Enjoying California Wines
This part of the book brings all that information about California 
wines home — home to your table, your neighborhood wine shop, 
your guests at dinner, and your vacation plans. Chapter 12 reveals 
our secrets for pairing wine and food and tells you which California 
wines go best with which types of dishes. We also describe the ins 
and outs of California’s recent vintages and counsel you on when 
to drink which types of wine. Chapter 13 offers practical advice 
on visiting wineries and getting your souvenir bottles back home 
safely.
Part V: The Part of Tens
We put our heads together and prioritized all the questions that 
people ask about California wines so we could answer the ten top 
frequently asked questions for you in Chapter 14. Then we fanta-
sized about our most romantic, inspiring, fun, not-to-be-missed 
travel experiences in California wine country and laid out our top 
ten picks for your consideration in Chapter 15.

Icons Used in This Book
We use icons throughout the book to emphasize certain points 
about wine. Also, we alert you to information that might be particu-
larly interesting to you (or not).
 
This bull’s-eye marks advice and information that will make you a 
wiser wine drinker.
 
You don’t need to memorize everything you read in this book, but 
some issues in wine are so fundamental that you should keep them 
in mind every time you pull out a wine glass or pick up a bottle. We 
mark the essential information with this symbol.
 
This odd little guy is a bit like the 2-year-old who constantly insists 
on asking, “Why?” If you don’t have the same level of curiosity that 
he has, feel free to skip over the information that follows. Wine will 
still taste just as delicious.
 
Wine snobs practice all sorts of affectations designed to make 
other wine drinkers feel inferior. But you won’t be intimidated by 
their snobbery if you pay attention to the Snob Alert icons and see 
it for what it is. (And you can find out how to impersonate a wine 
snob!)
 
To our tastes, the wines we mark with this icon are bargains 
because we like them, we believe them to be of good quality, and 
their price is low compared to other wines of similar type, style, or 
quality.
 
Unfortunately, some of the finest, most intriguing, most delicious 
wines are made in very small quantities. These wines have limited 
distribution, and you can’t always get your hands on a bottle, even 
if you’re willing to pay the price. We mark such wines with this 
icon and hope that your search proves fruitful. (Tip: You might 
be able to find some leads at www.wine-searcher.com, a search 
engine that scours the price lists of thousands of retailers.)
 
In certain sections of the book, we add valuable travel info, includ-
ing tips on restaurants, hotels, happening events, and so forth, 
from Frommer’s Portable California Wine Country, 5th Edition, by 
Erika Lenkert (Wiley).

Where to Go from Here
You can start reading anywhere in this book. Jump right into 
Chardonnay (Chapter 5) or Pinot Noir (Chapter 7) or whatever 
sounds inviting. But when you have a moment, read the opening 
chapters that explain the words you find on wine labels and name 
all California wine regions. If you’re fairly new to wine, these chap-
ters will be all the more helpful. And don’t overlook our final chap-
ters dealing with practical matters, such as pairing wine and food 
and traveling to wine country.

Part I
The Big Picture of 
California Wine

In this part...
C
alifornia is a big place, and the big picture of its 
wines is no small snapshot! The kinds of wine that 
California makes, the importance of these wines on 
the world stage, California’s major grape varieties and 
wines — right there, you have plenty of wine background 
to chew on (or more precisely, to slurp and swallow). But 
we don’t stop there. This is the part where you discover 
the meaning behind the names of California’s wines and 
the other words that appear on the wines’ labels, as well 
as follow the fascinating history of California wine from its 
origins to the present day. Most important of all, you can 
travel vicariously from one wine region to the next and 
discover what makes each one special.

Introducing California Wines
In This Chapter
▶ The gamut of California’s wine production
▶ California wine’s international status
▶ Why the region is ideal for producing wines
▶ California’s colorful wine history
A
ll 50 U.S. states make wine — mainly from grapes but in some 
cases from berries, pineapple, or other fruits. Equality and 
democracy end there. California stands apart from the whole rest 
of the pack for the quantity of wine it produces, the international 
reputation of those wines, and the degree to which wine has per-
meated the local culture. To say that in the U.S., wine is California 
wine is not a huge exaggeration.
If you want to begin finding out about wine, the wines of California 
are a good place to start. If you’re already a wine lover, chances 
are that California’s wines still hold a few surprises worth discov-
ering. To get you started, we paint the big picture of California 
wine in this chapter.
Covering All the Bases 
in Wine Production
Wine, of course, is not just wine. The shades of quality, price, 
color, sweetness, dryness, and flavor among wines are so many 
that you can consider wine a whole world of beverages rather 
than a single product. Can a single U.S. state possibly embody this 
whole world of wine? California can and does.
Whatever your notion of wine is — even if that changes with the 
seasons, the foods you’re preparing, or how much you like the 
people you’ll be dining with — California has that base covered. 
We would be the last people to suggest that you forever-after 

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine

drink the wines of only one state or wine region, because we 
believe in constant experimentation; however, if that curse were 
to befall you, you could rest assured that within the boundaries 
of California, you could find just about any type of wine you might 
desire.
The color and type spectrums
California makes a huge amount of white wine and red wine — 
the split is about even these days — and yet one of California’s 
best-selling types of wines is actually pink, or rosé. (That would 
be the wine called White Zinfandel, and yes, that name is illogi-
cal.) California also produces plenty of rosé wines besides White 
Zinfandel.
Sparkling wine — wine with bubbles in it — and really sweet like-
dessert-in-a-glass wines are two classic types of wine beyond regu-
lar still (nonsparkling), dry (not sweet) wines. California’s sparkling 
wines range in price from super-affordable to elite, and in quality, 
they range from decent to world-class. They also encompass a 
range of styles, from sweet and easy-to-enjoy to classically dry and 
complex. Sweet dessert wines are one of California’s smallest wine 
categories, but nevertheless, you can score. Your options range 
from delicious red Port-style wines (fortified wines, made by adding 
extra alcohol) to rich, seductive golden-colored wines made from 
grapes that shriveled into an extra sweet state.
Have we missed anything? We hope not, because California 
doesn’t! We cover white and red wines in Chapters 5 through 10, 
and we cover rosé, sparkling, and dessert wines in Chapter 11.
The wallet spectrum
For some wine drinkers, love of wine is color blind as long as the 
price is right — and the wine producers of California are com-
pletely obliging. At their most affordable, California’s wines cost as 
little as $2 for the equivalent of a standard bottle. (The volume of a 
standard wine bottle is 750 milliliters, which is a little more than 25 
ounces.) And a few elite wines boast prices of up to $750 a bottle. 
Yes, that’s $1 per milliliter, or $30 an ounce.
In terms of the dollar value of sales, the booming segment of the 
market is in the $15-and-up wines. But a greater quantity of wine 
sells in the under-$8 price tier. Bottom line: plenty of wine at what-
ever price you choose.

Defining wine
If you’re new to the whole wine experience, we proudly recommend that you take 
a look at our book, Wine For Dummies, 4th Edition (Wiley), because it provides a 
wealth of information about wine in general that can help you appreciate our favor-
ite beverage. But the last thing we want to do is halt your momentum in discovering 
California’s wines, so for now, here’s a quick summary of what wine is and how a 
wine gets to be the way it is.
Wine is grape juice that underwent fermentation, a biological process in which 
microscopic fungi called yeasts transform the sugar in the juice into alcohol and 
carbon dioxide (which usually dissipates). A dry wine is a wine whose grape sugar 
converted totally or almost totally into alcohol so that little or no sugar remains 
in the wine. Wines that retain some natural grape sugar are categorized as off-
dry, medium-dry, medium-sweet, or sweet, depending on how much sugar they 
contain.
A dry wine is mainly water, with about 12 to 16 percent alcohol (ethanol), 0.5 to 1 
percent glycerol (a sweet alcohol), 0.5 to 0.7 percent tartaric acid (from the grapes), 
and hundreds of minor components. These minor components include other acids, 
tannin (a natural substance in the grape skins and seeds), the grapes’ coloring 
matter, unfermented grape sugar (called residual sugar), minerals, aromatic com-
pounds that create the wine’s aromas and flavors, and so forth.
Most of the components of wine come from the grapes. Others come from the 
fermentation process, the materials that the wine or juice comes in contact with 
(such as oak barrels), and the wine’s aging process before and/or after the wine 
is bottled and sold. The winemaker also often adds certain substances, such as 
sulfur dioxide (which helps prevent the wine from turning to vinegar) or extra acid, 
in tiny amounts.
Even though wine is mainly water, it’s an amazingly complex liquid. Different wines 
can be similar in taste, but no two wines are exactly the same. The taste of any one 
wine is a function of
 ✓ The grapes
 ✓ The winemaking technique, such as the temperature or duration of fermenta-
tion and the type of container used for fermentation or aging
 ✓ How young or old the wine is when you drink it
 ✓ How you store it and how it was stored before you bought it (heat can age a 
wine prematurely, for example, or ruin it)
Even the type of closure on the bottle — natural cork, plastic “cork,” composite 
cork, or a screw-off cap — can affect the wine’s taste. Even the type of glass that 
you drink it from can affect its taste!

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine

The packaging spectrum
For several generations, until the mid-1970s, California specialized 
in making red, white, and pink wines that sold in large jug-like bot-
tles at very affordable prices. These were easy wines for everyday 
life, with screw-off caps so that you could pour two glasses and 
then close up the bottle for the next day. You can still find these 
California jug wines in most places where wine is sold, although 
their sales have declined.
Today’s large-volume, easy-open option is the 3-liter box with a 
collapsible bag of wine inside and a spigot attached to the bag for 
easy serving. Some California wines even come in Tetra-Brik pack-
ages, which are compact, plasticized paper containers like you see 
for cooked tomatoes, generally about 1 liter in size — 33 percent 
bigger than a standard wine bottle. They don’t require a plastic 
What’s a quality wine, anyway?
You can’t read this book — or any other book on wine, for that matter — without 
stumbling across frequent references to wine quality. If you conclude that some 
wines are higher in quality than others, you’re right. But how much should quality 
matter to you in choosing your wine?
First of all, you can take comfort in knowing that very few poor-quality wines exist 
today. The quality scale of California’s wines, for example, runs from acceptable to 
superb, and most wines fall into the good range. Secondly, you should remember 
that the quality of a wine is ultimately less important than the enjoyment the wine 
brings you. When a wine is satisfying, what more can you ask of it?
Wine experts assess the quality of a wine by evaluating all its characteristics, 
deciding how well the various aspects of the wine work together, and measuring 
all this against their mental yardsticks of what they consider to be wine perfection. 
Some of the issues might not be important to you. For example, a wine that seems 
to be capable of developing great complexity of flavor as it ages can earn bonus 
points from an expert, but you might plan to drink the wine in the next 24 hours. Or 
a wine can lose points because its taste doesn’t follow through to the rear of your 
mouth (it doesn’t have length); but if you tend to simply drink a wine rather than 
analyze it as it flows across your tongue, the initial impression of flavor is more 
important to you.
Many of the wines that experts consider to be lower down the quality scale are 
wines that are made purposely to appeal to certain groups of wine drinkers. They 
have characteristics such as intense flavor that hits you immediately, soft texture 
(the tactile feeling of the wine against your tongue and gums), and a slight note 
of sweetness — all of which make the wine taste delicious — but they lack the 
nuances of flavor or texture that a finer wine would have.

 Chapter 1: Introducing California Wines 15
bag inside them to hold the wine, and they’re super portable, not 
to mention eco-friendly and a great value. California is certainly 
not the only place that’s packaging wine in innovative ways like 
this, but California’s wine repertoire definitely includes plenty of 
wines in this category.
 
User-friendly wine options from California now also include pre-
mium wines — the good stuff — in regular-size wine bottles that 
are sealed with screw-off caps. Some winemakers, concerned that 
the screwcaps might confuse wine drinkers because of California’s 
long tradition of making inexpensive jug wines with that type of 
closure, aren’t embracing screwcaps for fine wine the way that 
Australian and New Zealand winemakers are. But some are, so 
California has that, too.
Leading the Market in Popularity
The Golden State makes more wine than all other U.S. states com-
bined. Not only that: Its wine production is huge even on a world 
scale. The U.S. as a whole ranks fourth for the quantity of wine 
it produces. But California owns that number-four spot even all 
by itself, producing 7 percent of the world’s wine — more than 
Argentina, Chile, Australia, Germany, and every other country 
except for Italy, France, and Spain.
 
In 2007, California made almost 566 million gallons of wine. That’s 
equivalent to more than 2.8 billion standard-size bottles.
All that production reflects a big demand for California wine. Two 
out of every three times that someone in the U.S. grabs a bottle 
of wine to take home, points to a wine name on a restaurant wine 
list, or clicks on the computer screen to buy wine, that wine comes 
from California.
A driving force behind the popularity of California wine is the way 
the wines taste. We’re about to make a generalization here, but 
we feel that it’s a safe one: California wines are very fruity (that is, 
they have aromas and flavors that suggest fruits) and very flavorful 
(those fruity flavors are intense and easy to notice when you taste 
the wine), and these characteristics appeal to the typical American 
palate. When Americans taste California wines, they like them, and 
they come back to them again and again. Well, two out of three 
times, anyway.
Another factor feeding the popularity of California wines is 
the smart marketing that the wineries practice. Winemakers in 
California understand what people want and make wines that fill 
those needs. That’s why California wines run the whole gamut of 

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
16
styles and types: Wine drinkers themselves run the whole gamut in 
taste and price preferences. Whether you’re a glass-of-Chardonnay-
at-the-bar drinker, a fine wine collector, or a passionate Pinot Noir 
hobbyist, California makes wines that can appeal to you.
Of course, quality plays a role also. Starting in the 1970s, California 
pioneered many winemaking innovations that improved wine qual-
ity. Flaws that used to exist in wines all over the world are now 
rare because the highly trained winemakers of California discov-
ered how to prevent them, and other winemakers followed suit. In 
terms of fundamental quality, California wines are among the most 
reliable in the world.
Golden Resources in 
the Golden State
Could the success story of California wines have happened just 
anywhere, or is there something about California itself that’s an 
integral part of the picture?
Actually, the place itself is always part of the picture when you 
talk about wine. Wine is an agricultural product: The grapes that 
are the raw material for wine come from vineyards that have cer-
tain growing conditions — certain soil fertility, certain moisture, 
certain sunshine and heat, and so forth. These growing conditions 
affect the quality and, to some extent, the style of the final wine. 
If California makes quality, flavorful wines, that’s due in no small 
part to the place called California. We discuss the various regions 
of California in Chapter 4, but for now, read on to find out what 
makes the state as a whole so ideal for producing wine.
California climate
Of the various factors that influence vineyard regions and deter-
mine their suitability for growing wine grapes, one of the most 
important is climate. Climate is the general meteorological pattern 
of a large area. Microclimate, a term you hear frequently in wine 
circles, is the particular meteorological pattern of a smaller area, 
such as a certain hillside.
In wine terms, what matters is having a good, long stretch of 
months with temperatures above 50°F, not-excessive amounts 
of rain, and few, if any, frosts or hailstorms. Beyond those basic 
requirements, winemakers look for special characteristics, such 
as fog or winds that moderate high temperatures, long sunshine 

 Chapter 1: Introducing California Wines 17
hours, or abundant winter rains that supply groundwater. Every 
nuance in a microclimate affects the grapes that grow there. Even 
if California wines are generally very fruity and flavorful, nuances 
of taste occur as the result of differences in climate — and these 
differences are part of the reason California makes wines in every 
conceivable style.
 
The French use the word terroir to describe the combination of cli-
mate and soil factors that affect the grapes and thereby influence 
the style of an area’s wines. California’s winemakers sometimes 
use this term themselves.
Rainfall and the need for irrigation
California has a Mediterranean-type climate, which means that 
rains fall in the winter but not during the summer growing season. 
We can still remember our disappointment the first time we went 
to Northern California during the summer, expecting to see green 
landscapes and finding brown grass and parched fields instead. (At 
least the vines themselves were green and gorgeous.)
To supply the water grapevines need, most wineries in California 
rely on irrigation. Generally they use drip irrigation, a system 
that feeds drops of water to each vine through a small hose that 
stretches along the base of the vines. These days, irrigating the 
vines is a complex balancing act between conserving water and 
giving the vines enough.
 
Some vineyards, particularly those on steep slopes where irri-
gation installations are difficult, survive on only the water that 
the ground holds. California has these dry-farmed vineyards, but 
they’re the exception rather than the rule.
Hot but cool, cool but hot
Apart from their common lack of growing-season rain, California’s 
winemakers face many differences in weather patterns, depending 
on where in the state their vineyards are situated. For example, in 
the huge Central Valley, which lies mainly south of the state capi-
tal of Sacramento, the temperatures can be very high all summer. 
In contrast, the vineyards in Napa and Sonoma Counties that lie 
across the San Pablo Bay north of San Francisco experience many 
mornings that are so cool and foggy you might forget that it’s 
summer.
 
More than 60 years ago, two eminent scientists in California 
devised a method for categorizing the climate of various wine 
regions according to the average monthly temperatures from April 
through October. They defined five temperature bands, calling 
the coolest one Region I and the warmest, Region V. Different heat 

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
18
summation regions, as they’re called, are appropriate for growing 
grapes to make different types of wines. California’s finest wines 
come from the cooler regions, Regions I and II.
Ocean breezes, elevation, and other influences on climate
Picture what California looks like on a map. (If you’re having 
trouble, turn to Chapter 4 for a map of California’s wine regions.) 
With its long coastline, mountains, and deserts, the state has an 
amazing range of altitudes and other features that influence tem-
perature, humidity, and rainfall patterns. The Pacific Ocean to the 
west represents a moist, cooling influence, whereas the deserts 
that occupy the state’s eastern border, adjacent to Nevada and 
Arizona, represent a hot, dry weather influence.
 
In California, one of the key determinants of local climate is not 
how northerly or southerly a vineyard is but how close it is to the 
Pacific Ocean. Ocean breezes and fog moderate the temperature 
downward. Interior vineyard areas experience no moderating influ-
ence from the ocean, except in special cases when a mountain 
range funnels ocean air far inward or through some such anomaly.
California also boasts a wide range of altitudes, from Death Valley, 
which lies at 282 feet below sea level, to Mount Whitney, which 
rises 14,505 feet above sea level. You won’t find any wineries or 
vineyards at either extreme, of course, but the state’s diversity of 
altitudes has an impact on its wines nonetheless.
Altitudes vary even within a single wine region of California. Napa 
Valley, for example — California’s most famous wine region — 
has vineyards on flat, low-lying land close to the Napa River; on 
hillsides that rise gently to the west and east of the river; and 
on mountains that rise above the hills. And that’s just one of 
California’s wine regions, of which there are dozens.
Soil matters
In grape-growing circles, not all dirt is equal. The particular soil 
that a vineyard has is an important element in the overall ecosys-
tem of that vineyard, affecting the availability of water and nutri-
ents to the vines, the depth to which the roots grow, the rate of 
vine growth, and so forth.
Different soils can require different irrigation treatments, different 
pruning techniques, or different rootstocks (the rooting part of the 
vine, which, through grafting, is usually a different species from 
the part of the vine that produces the fruit). Subtly or not-so-
subtly, the soil affects the way the grapes grow and therefore 
the wine that the grapes make.

 Chapter 1: Introducing California Wines 19
In California, many of the least expensive wines come from grapes 
grown in fertile soils, and plenty of the fine wines come from 
grapes grown in soils of medium or poor fertility. Mountain vine-
yards in particular tend to have poor soils, resulting in grapes that 
are concentrated in color and flavor.
California’s winemakers tend to place less emphasis on soil than 
many European winemakers do, but that doesn’t mean that soil 
variations don’t exist throughout the state. In Napa Valley alone, 
scientists have documented more than 30 different types of soil.
The human factor
Another element in California’s unique combination of wine 
resources is its people. Even if Californians joke that very few of 
them were born actually in California, the fact is that California’s 
climate and lifestyle have attracted an impressive pool of winemak-
ing talent. Or to be perfectly correct, California has attracted the 
people, and its universities have nurtured the winemaking talent.
California boasts two major universities that specialize in teach-
ing winemaking and viticulture (that’s grape growing to the rest of 
us). The two schools are the California State University at Fresno 
(www.csufresno.edu) and the University of California at Davis 
(www.ucdavis.edu), each known in wine circles by just its loca-
tion name. A high percentage of California’s own winemakers have 
launched their careers by studying at these universities.
The vineyard temperature dynamic
How much can vineyard temperature affect the taste of the final wine? Actually, 
quite a lot. Generally speaking, the warmer the temperature of the vineyard, the 
riper the grapes get. The riper the grapes get, the more sugar and the less acidity 
they have; they taste sweeter and less tart, just as for any other fruit.
In the winemaking process, the sugar that accumulates in the grapes changes into 
alcohol — therefore, the riper the grapes, the higher the alcohol content of the 
wine. Besides being high in alcohol, wines from very ripe grapes have flavors of 
very ripe fruit or sometimes even baked fruit. And because the acidity of the grapes 
is lower, the acidity of the wine is lower (unless the winemaker adds acid to the 
juice); the lower acidity makes for a softer texture in the wine.
Grapes that are somewhat less ripe, as they can be in cooler vineyards, tend to 
make wines with medium alcohol levels, fresh fruity flavors, and enough acidity to 
bring vibrancy to the wine. Either style of wine can be delicious, but each is distinct 
from the other because of the vineyard temperature.

Davis, in particular, is world famous. Seldom do we visit wine 
regions in Europe — even the most established, elite winemaking 
regions — without meeting a winemaker who studied at Davis. The 
stellar reputation of the university’s technical wine programs has 
made Davis a destination of choice for those who could go any-
where in the world.
Besides studying in California, winemakers from abroad often 
spend time working in California’s wineries, particularly when 
they’re young and just getting started in their families’ wine busi-
nesses. This is a boon for everyone involved, because the sharing 
of traditions and winemaking philosophy that results enriches 
the experience of California’s winemakers as much as it does the 
visitors’.
California’s Wine Timeline
We’ve visited the vineyards of Greece and Israel, which both have 
histories of grape growing and wine production that date back 
4,000 to 5,000 years. By those standards, California is a baby. 
Wine grapes have grown in California for no more than 250 years. 
(That’s one reason you might hear California referred to as a New 
World wine region, as opposed to Europe’s vineyards, which are 
part of the Old World of wine.)
California’s youth doesn’t imply a lack of history, however. Those 
250 years have seen several distinct phases of wine production 
and an impressive growth trend.
Planting the seeds in 
the 18th century
Wine grapes first came to California via Mexico. After Mexico 
became part of the Spanish Empire in the early 1500s, Spanish 
missionaries, both Jesuits and Franciscans, planted vineyards in 
Mexico. Gradually, as Spain expanded its reach, the missionaries 
moved up to “New Mexico,” an area that spread from what’s now 
Texas to California.
Franciscan Father Junípero Serra, the greatest Spanish wine mis-
sionary of all, planted the first California vineyard at Mission San 
Diego in 1769. Father Serra established eight more missions and 
vineyard sites as he traveled north in California. He died in 1784 
and is justifiably known as the Father of California Wine.

 Chapter 1: Introducing California Wines 21
The variety Father Serra planted, descended from Spanish vines 
growing in Mexico, became known as the Mission grape, and it 
dominated California wine production until about 1880, when 
the grape variety called Zinfandel became established (refer to 
Chapter 8 for more on Zinfandel’s heritage).
The founder and other pioneers
In 1833, a Frenchman named Jean-Louis Vignes planted other 
European vines in Los Angeles. But the person who did the most 
to establish California wine — the founder of the California wine 
industry — was a Hungarian immigrant named Agoston Haraszthy.
In the 1850s and 1860s, Haraszthy, a merchant and ultimately 
a promoter of California wine, made several trips to Europe, 
returning with vine cuttings from 165 of Europe’s best vineyards. 
Although he did obtain grants from California to cover some of 
the expenses, he covered much of the cost personally. Haraszthy 
introduced about 300 grape varieties to California, an amazing feat.
Haraszthy also fostered vine planting all over Northern California, 
promoted hillside planting, dug caves for cellaring wine, and 
championed dry-farmed (nonirrigated) vineyards. And he founded 
Buena Vista Winery in Sonoma’s Carneros region in 1857. Buena 
Vista is the oldest continually operating winery in California.
Other early wineries include the following:
 
✓ Charles Krug: Napa Valley’s first commercial winery, Charles 
Krug, opened in 1861. Robert Mondavi’s parents later 
acquired it (see the upcoming section “Reinventing itself in 
the 1960s”). Today, the Peter Mondavi family owns and oper-
ates the winery.
 
✓ Schramsberg: In 1862, Jacob Schram, a German immigrant, 
founded the Schramsberg winery on Napa Valley’s Diamond 
Mountain. About a century later, the late Jack and Jamie 
Davies stumbled upon the long-abandoned winery and 
began California’s first modern sparkling wine business at 
Schramsberg — today better than ever under the tutelage of 
the Davies’ son, Hugh. (Note: In the 1890s, French immigrant 
Paul Masson probably pioneered California sparkling wine in 
the Santa Cruz Mountains.)
 
✓ Simi: In 1876, two Tuscan immigrant brothers, Giuseppe and 
Pietro Simi, began making wine in San Francisco from Sonoma 
County grapes. In 1881, the Simi brothers planted vineyards 
in Sonoma’s Alexander Valley and founded the historic Simi 
Winery.

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
22
 
✓ Wente: In 1883, Wente Vineyards opened in Livermore Valley, 
east of San Francisco. It’s the oldest continuously operating 
family-owned winery in California.
By 1889, more than 140 wineries existed in California, including 
Beringer (1876) and Inglenook (1879). By the 1900s, nearly 800 win-
eries existed in the United States; a good number of these wineries 
were in California, but they were also in New York, New Jersey, 
Ohio, and Missouri. California wines found export markets as far 
away as Australia.
Surviving Prohibition
California winemaking was forced to take a big time-out on January 
16, 1920, when the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution — the 
Prohibition amendment — went into effect. Through a technicality, 
home wine production of up to 200 gallons a year remained legal. 
Although many growers of wine grapes in California went out of 
business, others were able to survive by making grape juice or by 
growing grapes for this new home winemaking market. Trainloads 
of wine grapes went outward from California to major Midwest 
and Eastern cities, where private citizens, many of them immi-
grants from countries that had strong wine cultures (such as Italy), 
bought the grapes for wines they produced in their basements.
When the 21st Amendment repealed the 18th Amendment effec-
tive December 5, 1933, and alcohol production again became legal, 
the California families who managed to keep their vineyards going 
were poised to produce wine for the thirsty nation. The number of 
wineries had dwindled to only 140, however.
Inexpensive generic wines — wines named for wines from other 
countries — became big business in the post-Prohibition era 
through the 1950s. Dessert wines (sweet wines) and fortified wines 
(wines strengthened with extra alcohol) became the dominant 
style from California. Not until 1963 did U.S. consumption of dry 
table wines (from California and elsewhere, including Europe) 
exceed consumption of rich, sweet wines. But then things began to 
change.
Reinventing itself in the 1960s
What happened to the California wine industry and the image of 
California wines starting in the 1960s was nothing short of revolu-
tionary. It didn’t begin suddenly — a few wineries in Napa Valley, 

 Chapter 1: Introducing California Wines 23
Sonoma County, and surrounding areas had already made inroads 
in a new direction as early as the 1930s. But by the 1960s, the 
movement had achieved critical mass.
What exactly was this movement? It was a focus on quality and 
on varietal wines. A varietal wine is a wine named for the single 
or dominant grape variety that makes the wine. By naming wines 
Chardonnay or Cabernet Sauvignon instead of using meaningless 
generic names borrowed from famous wine regions outside the 
U.S., California’s wine producers suddenly brought new legitimacy 
to their wines. Varietal naming was not the norm then — the 
majority of European wines were, and still are, named for the 
place where the grapes grew rather than the grape variety — and 
California caught the world’s eye in adopting this practice.
A pivotal moment in California’s wine revolution was the decision 
of the late Robert Mondavi to leave his family’s winery, Charles 
Krug, and start his own winery. Robert Mondavi Winery opened in 
1966, and from day one, its focus was on quality. Mondavi himself 
became an unofficial ambassador for California wines, particularly 
those of Napa Valley, and he convinced elite wine producers from 
all over the world that California was indeed one of the world’s 
finest wine regions. The reputation of Napa Valley and the appeal 
of the wine business became such that a winery boom occurred 
in California, and it continues to this day. In 1960, California had 
256 wineries, and by 1980, it had almost double that number, 508. 
Today, California boasts more than 2,600 wineries — and most 
likely twice as many brands of wine.
Another pivotal moment came in 1976 at a Parisian blind wine-
tasting. At what came to be known as the Judgment of Paris, a group 
of expert French wine tasters ranked a Napa Valley Chardonnay 
higher than the prestigious French white wines featured in the 
event, and they ranked a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon higher 
than the elite French red wines they tasted. The wine world was 
shocked by the success of upstart California. A whole new era 
began for California wine.
Expanding in the late 20th 
and early 21st centuries
 
The growth of California wine from the 1980s to the present has 
occurred on two fronts: qualitative and quantitative. Statistics tes-
tify to the growth in numbers:

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
24
 
✓ By the end of 2007, California wineries numbered 2,687.
 
✓ Vineyard land in California covered more than 475,000 acres 
in 2007, a growth of 43 percent since the late 1980s.
 
✓ California wineries shipped more than 541 million gallons of 
wine in 2007.
Part of the backstory behind these numbers is the fact that since 
the 1980s, owning a winery in California has become an aspira-
tion of successful individuals from other walks of life. Doctors, 
airline pilots, film magnates, corporate executives, and technology 
millionaires have all poured their fortunes and their hearts into 
California wine country.
As for quality, much of California’s growth in recent years has been 
an increased awareness of the importance of vineyard sites and a 
better understanding of how to maximize the potential of specific 
plots of land.
It was a crisis that instigated this growth in knowledge. In the 
1980s, many vines in California began to die because of a tiny louse 
called phylloxera that was gradually destroying the vines’ roots. 
Phylloxera had visited California before, in the late 19th century. 
The solution then was to graft the Vitis vinifera vines — the domi-
nant wine grape species — onto rootstocks of other vine species 
that were phylloxera-resistant. In the 1980s, California’s most 
prevalent rootstock unexpectedly fell victim to the bug. Except for 
a lucky few, vineyard and winery owners were forced to make the 
difficult decision to uproot their vines and replant their land.
In hindsight, this crisis was a great opportunity. It enabled vine-
yard owners to undo any mistakes of the past and to take advan-
tage of all the knowledge about grape growing that had developed 
in the years since they had first planted their fields. Awareness 
of the vineyard’s role in producing fine wine increased among 
winemakers. Today, when winemakers discuss their wines, they’re 
likely to spend as much time talking about the vineyard as about 
how they make their wine.
 
Today, California wine country and California wines are so famous 
and so popular that 14.5 million tourists visit California wine coun-
try each year. To put that in perspective, that’s fewer tourists than 
Disneyland gets but more than Hollywood does.

What’s in the Bottle
In This Chapter
▶ Wines derived mainly from one grape variety
▶ The name game of California’s wines
▶ What to expect from California’s major varietal wines
O
ver the years, the expression that we’ve probably heard 
more than any other from people in the wine business — 
those who sell wine and those who make it, too — is “it’s what’s in 
the bottle that counts.” This expression can serve many purposes. 
For example, if a label is ugly but the wine itself is good, it can sug-
gest that the unattractive label is really of no consequence. (We 
happen to disagree with that: Why should a wine drinker even try 
a wine and discover that it’s good if the packaging isn’t inviting?) 
But mainly, people use this statement to underscore the fact that 
wine is a beverage for people to drink and enjoy, and in the end, 
“what’s in the bottle” must taste good to the people who purchase 
and drink that wine.
What’s in California’s wine bottles? Lots of good-tasting, people-
pleasing wines, to be sure. But what are these wines exactly? 
What are they made from, and how do winemakers construct 
them to bring you positive taste experiences? We’re not about to 
launch into a technical treatise on winemaking techniques in this 
chapter — just offer some insight into what you’re actually drink-
ing when you sip a glass of California wine.
The Grape Names the Wine
When you drink most wine, you’re essentially drinking grapes. As 
raw material goes, however, grapes are an extremely mixed lot. 
Thousands of grape varieties exist just within Vitis vinifera, the 
wine grape species. And winemakers can use grapes from other 
species, as happens in parts of the U.S. where the climate is unsuit-
able for growing Vitis vinifera. Any one grape variety can become 

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
26
a wine in itself, or it can be combined with another variety or mul-
tiple varieties. The number of possible permutations of the raw 
material, “grapes,” surely runs into the millions.
For California wines, the situation is less chaotic. That’s because in 
the 1960s and 1970s, the winemakers of California began to focus 
on specific grape varieties to make their wines. Today, almost every 
California wine comes from the juice of a single, dominant grape 
variety — with the juice of other grape varieties sometimes added, 
in smaller quantities, to make the wine tastier, higher in quality, or 
more affordable. And that dominant grape variety is named on the 
wine label. In fact, in most cases, the name of the grape variety is 
the name of the wine. (We identify California’s major grape varieties 
and describe their wines later in this chapter.)
Varietal wine: A wine that 
is what it (mostly) is
A wine that’s named after its sole or dominant grape variety is a 
varietal wine, and that’s the main type of wine California produces. 
When you pick up a bottle of California wine, the name of the wine 
(most of the time) tells you which grape variety is the dominant 
one in that wine. You more or less know what you’re drinking.
To maintain truth in labeling, regulations have emerged to control 
the use of grape names. The regulations mainly govern the amount 
of the dominant grape variety that a wine must contain in order for 
that wine to carry the grape variety name. Early on, a wine could 
derive as little as 50 percent from a particular variety — and there-
fore 50 percent from other varieties — and still carry that grape 
variety name. Fortunately, that regulation changed. (We say fortu-
nately because — let’s face it — half of something just isn’t enough 
to define a whole.) Now, U.S. federal regulations dictate that a wine 
must derive at least 75 percent from the variety that’s named on 
the label.
 
Generally speaking, the less expensive a wine is, the more likely it 
is to contain grapes other than just the named variety. This hap-
pens for a couple of reasons:
 
✓ Cost of grapes: The most popular, best-selling grape varieties, 
such as Chardonnay, are also the most expensive varieties 
for wineries to purchase from grape growers. By limiting the 
quantity of that expensive variety to only 75 percent of the 

 Chapter 2: What’s In the Bottle 27
wine and blending in 25 percent of wine from less expensive 
varieties, a winery can bring down its production costs and 
sell the final wine at a lower price. This cost savings is par-
ticularly important for less expensive wines, especially wines 
that cost $10 a bottle or less, because these wines are often 
produced in very large volumes so that they can reach wine 
drinkers across the U.S.
 
✓ Flavor appeal for the mass market: Winemakers carefully 
engineer the taste of every inexpensive, mass-market wine so 
that the wine will appeal to as many wine drinkers as possible. 
Combining other grape varieties with the popular named vari-
ety is a valuable tool for winemakers to tweak the taste of their 
wine and make it distinctive from that of other brands of wine.
Regardless of the wine’s price, certain varietal wines almost always 
contain grapes other than the main variety that’s named on the 
label. That’s because winemakers traditionally blend certain grape 
varieties with certain other varieties to enhance the taste of the 
wine. For example, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot are classic 
partners: Most Merlot wines contain some Cabernet Sauvignon, 
and most Cabernet Sauvignon wines contain some Merlot. A bit of 
Merlot nicely softens a Cabernet wine, and a bit of Cabernet helps 
make a Merlot wine more substantial.
 
At face value, whether a wine contains grape varieties other than 
the main variety that’s the name of the wine is neither positive 
nor negative. The real test of the winemaker’s decision to blend 
multiple grapes is the taste of the wine. If you like the wine, does 
it really matter how many grape varieties work together to create 
that taste? (No, it doesn’t.)
Variety or varietal?
Want to catch your favorite wine know-it-all in an error? Just listen to how he or 
she uses the terms variety and varietal, and you’ll probably get the opportunity 
you’re looking for. Lots of people mistakenly use these words as synonyms. They 
might explain, for example, that “three varietals are in this wine.” Technically, the 
noun varietal refers to a wine named for a grape variety; the grape is a variety, not 
a varietal. Using varietal as an adjective is also correct, as you would if you were 
to refer to a grape’s varietal characteristics, for example.

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
28
Quality claims: What varietal 
does not imply
Generic is the term that U.S. regulations use for wines with bor-
rowed place names, such as the name of a French wine region 
(Bordeaux, Chablis, and so forth) on a California wine. Back in the 
1960s and 1970s, when varietal wines from California were emerg-
ing on the U.S. market and wines with generic names were the 
norm, you could safely say that varietal wines were of a higher 
quality than other California wines. One reason was that the winer-
ies pioneering varietal naming were all serious, quality-oriented 
wineries.
The great nature versus nurture debate
Because grapes are the raw material of a wine and because every grape variety 
has its own set of taste characteristics, it would be logical to think that every wine 
from a particular grape variety would taste very similar to other wines made from 
that grape variety. But the situation is actually more complex than that.
For one thing, not all grapes of the same variety taste exactly the same: The farm-
ing practices used in the vineyard can influence their taste. When a grape grower 
prunes the vines in such a way that they produce a very large crop of grapes, for 
example, those grapes can have less flavor than grapes that come from vines with 
a smaller crop load. Likewise, flavor may be less intense if one grower irrigates the 
vines a lot more than another grower. Differences in weather from one year to the 
next can also affect the taste of the grapes so that in one year, for example, the 
Cabernet grapes have very ripe fruity flavors and in another year, they have herbal 
notes in their flavor profile.
Winemaking techniques also can cause wines made from the same grape to taste 
different from each other. If oak barrels or other forms of oak (boards, chips, or 
powder that sit in the wine briefly) are part of the winemaking regimen, the wine 
can have different flavors than a wine from the same grape variety that’s made 
entirely in stainless steel tanks. And that’s just one example. The temperature of the 
fermentation, the type of yeast that’s used, the amount of sweetness (if any) that the 
winemaker retains in the wine, filtration techniques, and many more winemaking 
practices influence the taste of a wine.
That said, the grape variety dictates the wine’s DNA, and therefore wines from 
the same variety will have quite a lot in common. Each variety has a predictable 
range of aromas and flavors, for example, as well as a tendency to make wines of 
a certain depth of color and weight in the mouth (how light or full they seem when 
you drink them).

 Chapter 2: What’s In the Bottle 29
 
Today, varietal names are so commonplace among California wines 
that the presence of a varietal name means absolutely nothing in 
terms of a wine’s quality. You can find varietal wines that sell for 
$3 a bottle and others that sell for hundreds of dollars a bottle. 
Obviously, the quality of what’s inside the bottle varies tremen-
dously in each case, despite the fact that both wines carry a grape 
variety name.
To some extent, a varietal name can help you predict what the 
wine will taste like — but less than you might think. Wines named 
Chardonnay are a perfect example. Some Chardonnay wines are on 
the sweet side; these tend to be the least expensive wines designed 
to appeal to large numbers of wine drinkers. Other Chardonnays 
are completely dry, for those who have classic tastes in wine. 
Some are soft and made for immediate enjoyment. Others are very 
serious wines that will improve as they rest in the bottle for a few 
years. Some — most, in fact — have toasty, smoky aromas and 
flavors that come from aging in oak barrels (if the wine costs more 
than $15, approximately) or from absorbing the flavor of chips of 
oak or oak powder that infuses in the wine for a brief period (the 
inexpensive wines). But some Chardonnays have no toasty, smoky 
flavors from oak because they’re made without any oak treatment. 
Grab a bottle of “Chardonnay,” and you can’t be entirely sure what 
the wine will taste like. But at least you’ll know that at least 75 per-
cent of it derived from Chardonnay juice.
Wines without Varietal Names
The varietal wine concept has penetrated the California wine 
industry — and the American wine-buying culture — to such an 
extent that probably over 95 percent of the California wines that 
you see on store shelves carry varietal names and are made mainly 
from the grape variety that’s the name of the wine. But not every 
bottle of wine wears a varietal label. The following sections discuss 
the main situations in which wines have other types of names.
Blends: Naming when the point 
is multiple grape varieties
Sometimes a winemaker doesn’t want to use a full 75 percent of 
any one grape variety in a wine but prefers instead to blend sev-
eral types of grapes to achieve exactly the style of wine that he or 
she seeks. In these cases, the wine carries a clever name that has 
nothing to do with the grape varieties used to make the wine. For 
example, Turnbull Wine Cellars in Napa Valley makes a wine called 

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
30
Old Bull Red that contains, in the 2006 vintage, 44 percent Merlot, 
18 percent Tempranillo, 16 percent Sangiovese, 9 percent Cabernet 
Sauvignon, 6 percent Barbera, 5 percent Cabernet Franc, and 2 
percent Syrah. Wines like this can be lots of fun for the winemaker 
to blend, and they offer wine drinkers something different from the 
standard varietal wines.
Sparkling wines are another example of blending for success. 
California’s finest sparkling wines are mainly blends of Chardonnay 
and Pinot Noir grapes, often in approximately equal proportions. 
(Note: The tradition of blending the juice of white and red grapes 
to make sparkling wines goes back to the Champagne region of 
France, where it’s the norm.) Their labels carry the winery name 
and the word brut, which indicates a dry style, or sometimes a 
proprietary name, such as Étoile, the top-of-the-line bubbly from 
the Domaine Chandon winery. You can occasionally come across 
a sparkling wine that’s entirely Chardonnay and carries the grape 
variety name on its label, but that’s an exception to the rule. Many 
California sparkling wine producers make a blanc de noirs, which 
is a white wine that’s usually all Pinot Noir, but the grape variety 
seldom appears on the front label. (Chapter 11 gives you much 
more information about California’s fine sparkling wines.)
Emulating European classics
Certain classic European wines are blended wines. When wine-
makers take those wines as their inspiration, they naturally blend 
together wines from several different grape varieties. Two types 
of blends that are common in California are those inspired by the 
wines of France’s southern Rhône Valley and those inspired by red 
or white wines from France’s Bordeaux region.
The fine art of blending
How exactly do winemakers blend different grape varieties together? Most of the 
time, they vinify (make into wine) the juice of each grape variety separately so 
that they have a certain number of tanks of Chardonnay, for example, and other 
tanks of French Colombard or Chenin Blanc or whatever other grape they might 
possibly blend with the Chardonnay. Then, when the time is right, the winemaking 
team gathers to taste prototype blends — different variations of possible blends 
that they mix in beakers, just like in chemistry lab. They continue experimenting 
with different formulations until they find one that has the right taste and is also 
financially feasible.

 Chapter 2: What’s In the Bottle 31
Southern Rhône Valley reds are generally blends of lesser-known 
grape varieties such as Grenache, Mourvedre, Cinsault, and 
Carignan, as well as the better-known Syrah grape. In the Rhône 
Valley, the blends vary tremendously, some being Grenache-
dominant, some being Syrah-dominant, and everything in between. 
Today, a nonprofit organization, called the Rhone Rangers, exists 
to promote these wines (www.rhonerangers.org). More than 200 
wineries are members, although some of those wineries aren’t 
in California. You generally don’t see the name Rhone Ranger on 
a bottle of blended red wine, but you might see a reference to 
France’s Rhône Valley on the back label. What you’ll find inside the 
bottle is usually a full-bodied, fairly soft red wine with very ripe 
fruit flavors and a certain earthy note.
Advocates of the style of wine produced in France’s Bordeaux 
region banded together more than 20 years ago to form the 
Meritage Association (www.meritagewine.org). The red wines are 
blends of two or more varieties from a group of eight; the principal 
ones are Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, and 
Petit Verdot. The whites are blends of two or more of the following 
varieties: Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon, and Sauvignon Vert. In both 
cases, no single variety can make up more than 90 percent of the 
blend. More than 100 wineries in California belong to the Meritage 
Association. Some of these wineries name their top wines with the 
trademarked name Meritage, and many of them use proprietary 
names, with or without the name Meritage. One example is the 
wine called Trilogy, from Flora Springs Winery in Napa Valley, 
which is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet 
Franc. Often, Meritage blends are the most expensive wines that a 
particular winery makes.
Period pieces, generically speaking
One situation in which California wines are not named varietally 
occurs when the producer decides to use a generic name. Generic 
names include, in the language of U.S. government regulations, 
“names of geographic significance which are also the designa-
tion of a class or type of wine.” These names include Burgundy, 
Chablis, Champagne, Chianti, Port, and Sherry, among others. 
Although these names are all names of real wines from real places 
outside the U.S., producers can legally use them for their California 
wines provided that the actual origin of the wine appears “in direct 
conjunction” with the (phony) place name, such as California 
Burgundy, California Chianti, or California Champagne. (Actually, 
to be perfectly correct, the regulations refer to these names as 
semigenerics, but we don’t really know what that means, and so for 
simplicity we call them generic names.)

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
32
What all this bureaucratese means is that you can still find 
California wines that have those borrowed place names from 
famous European wine regions. Fifty years ago, these wines rep-
resented the majority of California’s production, but now they 
occupy a distinct minority. Generally, you find these wines pack-
aged in large gallon-size jugs or in bag-in-a-box containers. They’re 
a throwback to once-upon-a-time, and they serve a diminishing 
clientele. The wines are usually sweet, and they’re the most inex-
pensive segment of California’s wine production.
The In-Crowd: California’s 
Major Varietal Wines
If you scour the shelves of a good wine shop, you can prob-
ably find more than a dozen distinct types of varietal wine from 
California. But the list of varietal wines is top heavy: A handful of 
wines are by far the most popular, most widely available, and best-
known varietal wines from the Golden State. These are Chardonnay 
and Sauvignon Blanc (both white wines), Cabernet Sauvignon 
and Merlot (red wines), and Zinfandel (a red wine and also a pink 
wine). Pinot Noir and Syrah/Shiraz are also fairly popular varietal 
wines.
Chardonnay
The Chardonnay grape is a white grape that makes white table 
wines and sparkling wines. Because the Chardonnay grape is easy 
to grow in a wide range of climates and types of soils, it grows 
throughout California’s wine regions. The fact that Chardonnay 
wine is the number one best-selling varietal wine from California is 
no small incentive to grape growers to continue growing this grape 
wherever they can.
Chardonnay wines usually have some toasty, smoky aromas and 
flavors that come from oak. Depending on the individual brand, 
the oaky character can be intense, moderate, or subtle. (Some 
California Chardonnays are made without using oak at all, but 
they’re in the minority.) Chardonnay wines have fruit aromas and 
flavors that include apple, citrus fruit (especially lemon), and tropi-
cal fruits such as mango or pineapple. You can also sometimes 
find aromas and flavors that suggest butter, butterscotch, vanilla, 
or caramel; these particular aromas and flavors come from oak or 
winemaking processes, not from the grapes.

 Chapter 2: What’s In the Bottle 33
The wines tend to be full-bodied. Although the world’s classic 
Chardonnay wines — the white wines from the Burgundy region 
of France — are very dry, California’s Chardonnays range from 
dry to rather sweet. The least expensive brands, those that sell for 
about $10 a bottle or less, are most likely to be somewhat sweet, 
probably because the wineries are targeting a broad audience that 
appreciates a wine that’s not truly dry. For more information on 
California Chardonnay, including lists of our recommended wines, 
turn to Chapter 5.
Sauvignon Blanc
The Sauvignon Blanc grape variety accounts for only about 8 
percent of California’s white wine production (compared to a 
whopping 43 percent for Chardonnay), but after Chardonnay, 
it’s the number two most popular domestic white varietal wine. 
Some wines based on the Sauvignon Blanc grape call themselves 
Fumé Blanc, which U.S. authorities recognize as a synonym for 
Sauvignon Blanc. (Chapter 5 tells the whole story of how this wine 
came to have two different names.)
White versus red: Tannin 
makes the difference
For many wine drinkers, the choice of which wine to drink boils down to a very fun-
damental decision: white or red? The main difference between white wine and red 
wine is that white wines generally come from white grape varieties and red wines 
come from red (or “black”) varieties. But there’s a greater difference than meets 
the eye: Red wine contains more tannin than white wine does.
Tannin is a substance that can produce a drying sensation, sometimes described 
as grip, in the wine’s texture. It exists naturally in the skins, seeds, and stems of 
grapes, and it can also come from oak barrels that the wines age in. (It also exists 
in other foods, such as tea.) The presence of tannin in red wines is the main reason 
they don’t taste as good when they’re served cold: Chilling the wines can make the 
tannins taste bitter.
Not only do red grapes contain more tannin than white grapes do, but the process 
of making red wines — specifically the fact that the grape skins must soak in the 
juice in order to give their color to the wine — means that more of the grape tannins 
find their way into red wine.
Some red wines have more tannin than others (Pinot Noir wines tend to have less 
tannin than Cabernet Sauvignons, for example), and some wines have softer, less-
drying tannins than others, but most red wines do contain tannin.

We find it hard to generalize about the taste of Sauvignon Blanc 
wines because they vary so much according to where the grapes 
grow, how ripe the grapes get before they’re harvested, how the 
winemaker chooses to vinify the juice, and how he or she ages the 
Sauvignon Blanc wine. Not only that — many winemakers like to 
blend some Sémillon wine into their Sauvignon Blanc, which can 
alter the taste of the wine a lot by making it softer, fuller, richer in 
texture, and less intense in flavor.
Generally, Sauvignon Blanc wines are crisper than Chardonnay 
and medium-bodied rather than full-bodied, with more vivid, pro-
nounced fruit flavors, which include citrus, pear, or passion fruit. 
The wines can also have herbal or vegetal aromas and flavors, 
such as mowed grass or green peppers. Also, many Sauvignon 
Blanc wines are made without any use of oak, and therefore 
they lack the smoky, toasty, vanilla-like aromas and flavors of 
Chardonnay.
You can find some Sauvignon Blanc wines from California that 
are truly dry, but in our experience, more and more of them taste 
rather sweet; we place them at the sweet end of the spectrum 
that’s commercially considered dry wine.
Cabernet Sauvignon
The Cabernet Sauvignon grape variety is California’s most-planted 
red wine grape, representing about 23 percent of California’s red 
wine production. It grows well in most parts of the state, with the 
exception of the very coolest regions, such as many coastal areas.
Most of California’s elite red wines are either varietal Cabernet 
Sauvignons or blends such as Meritage wines that are predomi-
nately Cabernet Sauvignon (see the earlier section “Emulating 
European classics”). But you can find plenty of varietal Cabernet 
Sauvignon wines at every price, including in the $10-and-under 
price tier.
At the least expensive end, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are very 
fruity, medium-bodied, fairly flavorful wines that have a bit of 
sweetness. At medium to high price levels, Cabernet Sauvignon 
wines are fairly full-bodied with firm tannin and are often capable 
of aging for a few years after you purchase them. That’s because 
with age, the wines’ tannins become softer and the flavors become 
more complex and a bit subdued. (See the sidebar “White versus 
red: Tannin makes the difference” for more on tannin.)

 Chapter 2: What’s In the Bottle 35
In general, Cabernet Sauvignon wines have aromas and flavors of 
black currants or other small black berries, sometimes a minty or 
other herbal note, and often toasty, smoky, or vanilla-like sugges-
tions from the oak that’s used in making the wine. Most Cabernet 
Sauvignon varietal wines contain some Merlot or sometimes other 
red wines such as Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, or even Syrah.
 
In general, we consider Cabernet Sauvignon wines to be California’s 
most reliable red wines. Whenever we’re in a situation in which we 
don’t know the particular brands that are available — on an air-
plane, for example, or at a catered event — we opt for the Cabernet 
Sauvignon as the safest bet.
Zinfandel
Zinfandel wines are a special case because the majority of them are 
not red wines but sweetish pink wines, labeled as White Zinfandel. 
The grape itself is red, and the Zinfandel wines that aren’t labeled 
as “white” are in fact usually very hefty red wines.
White Zinfandel is one of the most popular types of wine in 
California. It emerged in the early 1970s and became a big hit, espe-
cially with wine drinkers who find most red and white wines to be 
too dry for their tastes. Winemakers produce White Zinfandel by 
draining the grape juice from the dark skins before the juice has 
had the chance to absorb more than a pale pink color.
Zinfandels (the red versions are labeled simply Zinfandel, never 
Red Zinfandel) have rich flavors of berry fruit, particularly bram-
bleberries (those berries whose plants contain thorns, such as 
blackberries and loganberries). The wines are medium-bodied or 
full-bodied and very fruity, with spicy or sometimes jammy flavor. 
They tend to be even higher in alcohol than other red wines. The 
less expensive Zinfandels are generally moderate in tannin and 
meant for drinking young, whereas the pricier Zinfandels have a 
firm tannin backbone that enables them to age.
Zinfandel today occupies both the moderately priced tier and the 
high-end price tier of red wines. The elite wines often come from 
special vineyards where the vines are 80 or even 100 years old. Old 
vines produce a smaller crop of grapes that are concentrated in 
flavor and prized for top-quality wines.

Merlot
California Merlot took a bad rap in the movie Sideways and is now 
somewhat less popular than it was in the early years of this century. 
But the Merlot grape is still California’s third red grape variety, after 
Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. The Merlot grape doesn’t grow 
well just anywhere, however, and the quality and taste of Merlot 
wines can vary quite a lot depending on whether the grapes grew in 
an area that’s more or less suitable for this variety.
Merlot wines are generally full-bodied and have aromas and 
flavors of plums, other dark fruits, and sometimes tea or choco-
late. Because the Merlot grape has less tannin than the Cabernet 
Sauvignon grape, Merlot wines tend to be a bit softer in texture 
than Cabernet Sauvignon, which is one reason that they appeal to 
many wine drinkers.
Some inexpensive Merlots can be fairly light in body (the weight of 
the wine in your mouth) with flavors that suggest tea and herbal 
notes more than fruity character. The best Merlot wines give an 
impression of plumpness in your mouth, with rich flavors of dark, 
plump fruits.
Pinot Noir
California’s Pinot Noir wines are extremely popular, but these red 
wines are also small-time compared to Cabernet Sauvignon, with 
only about 20 percent as much production as Cabernet.
The Pinot Noir grape grows at its best only in certain vineyard 
areas, and it doesn’t do well in the warm conditions that charac-
terize many of California’s regions for inexpensive wines, such as 
the Central Valley (refer Chapter 4 for information on this region). 
Therefore, decent inexpensive Pinot Noir wines from California 
are rare. But at the medium and high end of the price scale, plenty 
good-quality Pinot Noirs exist, mainly from cool coastal vineyards.
Two key characteristics of Pinot Noir wines are their abundance 
of fruity aromas and flavors and their relatively low amount of 
tannin, which makes them fairly soft and silky-textured for red 
wine. Typical fruit flavors include red berries, black berries, and 
cherries, and these are often accompanied by spiciness from oak 
and sometimes by earthy aromas and flavors. The wines are usu-
ally fairly full-bodied and high in alcohol, which gives them smooth 
texture as well as a slight suggestion of sweetness.

 Chapter 2: What’s In the Bottle 37
Traditionally, Pinot Noir wines contain only Pinot Noir grapes. But 
lately, many California Pinot Noirs contain some Syrah or Merlot. 
Winemakers are using these other grapes in some cases to beef up 
the color of their Pinot Noir wine, which generally isn’t very dark 
on its own, and in the case of inexpensive wines, winemakers use 
the other grapes to reduce their production costs. Unfortunately, 
these other grapes don’t have nearly as much seductive aroma as 
Pinot Noir, and their presence diminishes the wine’s aromas and 
flavors. If your Pinot Noir is very deep in color, it may contain one 
of these other grapes.
Syrah/Shiraz
The Syrah grape has grown in California for several decades, but 
varietal Syrah wine has really taken off only recently — particularly 
if it calls itself Shiraz instead of Syrah. The name Shiraz is a syn-
onym that originated in Australia, and the popularity of Australian 
Shirazes in the U.S. motivated many California winemakers to 
rename their own Syrah wines as Shiraz.
Syrah or Shiraz varietal wines are generally moderate in tannin 
and full of berry flavors — sometimes with nuances of spiciness 
(such as black pepper), earthy notes, or smoked meat flavors, but 
more often than not, just juicy fruitiness. Syrah is also frequently 
part of blended wines such as Rhône-style reds (see the section 
“Emulating European classics,” earlier in this chapter).
Other California Varietal Wines
About 110 different wine grape varieties grow in California, and 
you could theoretically see any one of them as the name of a vari-
etal wine. But in practice, you’ll find fewer than two dozen varieties 
among the varietal wines from California (unless, of course, your 
hobby is discovering unusual or obscure types of wine).
In the preceding section, we describe the seven most commonly 
seen varietal wines from California. In the following sections, we 
name 10 varietal wines that occupy something like a second tier in 
terms of how common they are and another 18 wines that are even 
less common.

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine

Whites
In addition to the white wines that we name in the earlier sections, 
other varietal whites wines that you’re likely to see include the fol-
lowing, which we list alphabetically:
 
✓ Chenin Blanc: This is one of the world’s classic white wine 
grapes, but it has little recognition among wine drinkers 
because its most famous wines (from the Loire Valley region 
of France) don’t carry the grape name. In California, Chenin 
Blanc wines generally range from medium-dry (even though 
some are labeled dry) to medium-sweet and are fairly full-
bodied, with rich texture. Most of the Chenin Blanc juice in 
California ends up in inexpensive blended wines, but some 
good varietal wines do exist.
 
✓ Gewurztraminer: Only a small amount of this flavorful grape 
grows in California, mainly in cooler areas such as Mendocino 
County and parts of Sonoma County. The wines are generally 
full-bodied, unoaked, richly textured, and rich in perfumed 
aromas and flavors that can include lychee fruit, rose, peach, 
apple, and citrus fruit. Usually, they’re not fully dry, but they 
often taste dryer than they technically are.
 
✓ Pinot Blanc: California boasts a few very fine wines from 
the white Pinot Blanc grape. These wines are dry, fairly full-
bodied, and unoaked or gently oak-influenced, with subdued 
aromas and flavors.
 
 For many years, many of what was thought to be Pinot Blanc 
plantings in California were actually another grape entirely, 
Melon de Bourgogne (the grape that makes Muscadet in 
France).
 
✓ Pinot Grigio/Gris: This one’s a biggie. Sometimes these white 
wines are called Pinot Gris, and sometimes they’re called 
Pinot Grigio, the Italian name for the wine (to take advantage 
of the huge success of Italian Pinot Grigio wines in the U.S.). 
California Pinot Grigios tend to be sweeter than the Italian 
versions, less crisp, and fruitier in flavor. Sometimes when a 
winery names the wine Pinot Gris, it signifies a fuller-bodied, 
more flavorful style of wine — but you really need to taste the 
wine or read reviews of it to be sure.
 
✓ Riesling: California makes a few very good wines from the 
white Riesling grape variety and some fairly sweet wine 
that’s made to appeal to wine drinkers who don’t like truly 
dry wines. The best wines come from cooler regions such as 
Mendocino County, Monterey County, and cool sections of 

 Chapter 2: What’s In the Bottle 39
Napa Valley. They’re dry to medium-dry and unoaked, with 
rich fruity aromas and flavors (peach, apricot, citrus, melon, 
apple, and so forth).
 
✓ Viognier: This white variety makes full-bodied, dry white 
wines that are rich in aroma and flavor, particularly peachy 
and floral notes, sometimes with evident minerally character. 
These wines can be unoaked or made using oak barrels, but 
they usually don’t taste oaky.
Reds
Red varietal wines that you might encounter in the California sec-
tion of your wine shop — besides the five big names that we dis-
cuss earlier in this chapter — include the following:
 
✓ Cabernet Franc: This red grape is, as the name suggests, 
related to Cabernet Sauvignon, and it’s used in many varietal 
Cabernet Sauvignons, some varietal Merlots, and many red 
Meritage blends. As a varietal wine in its own right, it tends to 
have notes of red fruits rather than the black-fruit character 
common in Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. It’s somewhat 
less tannic and firm and is somewhat fruitier than compara-
bly priced Cabernet Sauvignons. You’ll find varietal Cabernet 
Francs only from serious producers, and you won’t find this 
varietal wine at inexpensive, mass-market prices.
 
✓ Grenache: This red grape variety is common in blended 
Rhône-style red wines. On its own, it makes full-bodied red 
wines that are high in alcohol and not very tannic, unless they 
have tannin from aging in oak barrels. Actually, much of the 
varietal Grenache wine that you might find from California is 
White Grenache, a somewhat sweet pink wine in the style of 
White Zinfandel.
 
✓ Petite Sirah: This grape variety — not to be confused with 
Syrah, which is a different variety — is an old-timer and some-
thing of an original in California. The French know it as the 
Durif variety, and it’s fairly obscure. But it has a loyal following 
in California among some winemakers and some wine drinkers. 
The wines are deeply colored, full-bodied, tannic, and powerful, 
with aromas and flavors of dark fruits and often black pepper.
 
✓ Sangiovese: Some winemakers once had big plans for varietal 
Sangiovese wines in California — and some still pride them-
selves in this wine, although it has proven to be challenging 
to make. Sangiovese is Italy’s major red grape, particularly 
famous in wines from the region of Tuscany, such as Chianti. 
In California, the wines are fairly full-bodied and firm in tannin.

Even less-known varietals
Still other grape varieties are even less common as the basis of 
varietal wines in California — but we mention them here just in 
case you encounter one of these wines and wonder what it is. 
Unusual white varieties that a few producers do make as varietal 
wines include Arneis and Cortese (both Italian varieties), Grenache 
Blanc, Marsanne (a Rhône Valley variety), Melon (of Muscadet 
fame), Muscat (used to make sweet wines), Roussanne (another 
Rhône Valley variety), Sémillon, and Verdelho.
Red grape varieties that you might occasionally see as varietal 
wines from California include Barbera, Carignan, Dolcetto, Gamay 
(of Beaujolais fame), Lagrein (from Northern Italy), Mourvedre 
(also known as Mataro), Petit Verdot, Primitivo, Tempranillo (the 
main grape of Spain’s Rioja wines and many other Spanish wines), 
and Teroldego (from northern Italy).
Colombard, the other white grape
In all the lists of grape varieties, one major grape in California usually goes unmen-
tioned. That grape is French Colombard. In quantitative terms, it’s the state’s number 
two white grape after Chardonnay — and yet we’ve rarely seen it as a varietal wine 
(though it did enjoy a period of popularity as a varietal wine several decades ago). 
It’s a grape that originated in France’s Cognac region, where it makes a neutral 
base wine for Cognac brandy production. In California, it grows mainly in the San 
Joaquin Valley and is used as a blending wine for inexpensive, nonvarietal wines 
and for the most inexpensive sparkling wines.

W
e love looking at the labels on bottles of California wine. 
As a group, they’re more diverse and imaginative than 
ever. Some wineries still use the same label they adopted 20 or 30 
years ago because their labels have become classics. Some brand 
new wineries use retro labels that give you the impression that the 
winery is a century old instead of having been born only yester-
day. Some wineries use special-interest labels to attract the surfer 
crowd or the animal-lovers crowd or the crowd that likes to wear 
dresses in the summertime. Some labels communicate the distinct 
message that you shouldn’t take the wine too seriously — just try 
it and enjoy it! Other labels communicate such connoisseurship 
that you might wonder whether you know enough to be entitled to 
drink that wine.
Despite how different they are, however, labels on bottles of 
California wine have a lot in common. For one thing, they all con-
tain certain information that’s mandatory on wine labels according 
to Uncle Sam. And they all contain information that can help you 
understand something about the wine that’s inside the bottle, even 
before you taste the wine. In this chapter, we help you decipher the 
wine label and introduce you to some of the wine areas listed there.

Label Terms and What 
They (Sorta) Mean
Imagine a world in which government officials have the specific 
job of reviewing proposed wine label designs and approving them 
for use or sending them back to the drawing board. It smacks of 
Big Brother, but in fact, it’s not fiction. Every wine label that enters 
into commerce in the U.S., whether the wine inside the bottle is a 
domestically produced wine or an imported one, must first pass 
muster with the good folks at the TTB — the Alcohol and Tobacco 
Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
In reviewing the label, the TTB determines
 
✓ Whether it’s decent (as in lacking nudity or lewdness, not in 
artistic merit)
 
✓ Whether it conforms to existing federal regulations for wine 
labels, which cover a wide range of issues, from the inclusion 
of mandatory information (such as the wine’s alcohol level) 
and the size of the type displaying that information to the 
name of the geographic area that’s mentioned as the agricul-
tural source of the wine
Regulated wine terms
Much of the information that we check on wine labels when we’re 
buying wine falls into the category of mandatory information that 
U.S. regulations require to appear on all labels of wine sold in the 
U.S. On the other hand, some of the mandatory information is so 
meaningless to us that our eyes glaze over when we see it.
In a nutshell, here’s the information that’s mandatory on all labels 
of California (and other) wine sold in the U.S. The wine’s main 
label, known as its brand label, must contain the following:
 
✓ A brand name (see the section “Wine names and brand 
names”)
 
✓ An indication of “class or type,” a very bureaucratic aspect of 
the regulations; for nonsparkling wines, a varietal or semige-
neric name can satisfy this requirement (Chapter 2 tells you 
about generic/semigeneric names)
 
✓ The alcohol content of the wine

 Chapter 3: Decoding the Label 43
The main label or another label on the package must contain
 
✓ The name and address of the bottler (see the section “Wine 
producers, blenders, preparers, and bottlers”)
 
✓ The net contents of the bottle (generally 750 milliliters, or 
25.36 fluid ounces)
 
✓ The declaration contains sulfites if a wine contains more than 
10 parts-per-million of sulfur dioxide, which almost all wines 
do (to prevent the wine from turning to vinegar, among other 
benefits)
 
✓ The Government Health Warning, which warns against drink-
ing during pregnancy and notes that alcohol impairs the con-
sumer and might cause health problems
Wine names and brand names
Almost every winery makes more than one wine. The name of the 
wine is the varietal name (name of the dominant grape) or other 
type of name that distinguishes that specific wine from the win-
ery’s other wines. (Chapter 2 has lots of information about varietal 
names and other names.)
 
The grape variety that’s indicated on the label as the wine name 
must account for at least 75 percent of what’s in the bottle.
The brand name of a wine is usually the name of a winery that pre-
sumably produced the wine. What you may be interested to know 
is that not every brand is a winery name, and not every “winery” is 
a winery.
Splitting the alcohol bureau
The organization performing the wine label–approval function was once known as 
the BATF — the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms — but effective January 
2003, the Homeland Security Act transferred the BATF to the U.S. Department of 
Justice, where its mission is now to prevent terrorism, reduce violent crime, and 
protect the nation.
The TTB is the more genteel version of the former BATF, entrusted, in the words of 
its own mission statement, with “collecting excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco, fire-
arms, and ammunition; ensuring that these products are labeled, advertised, and 
marketed in accordance with the law; and administering the laws and regulations 
in a manner that protects the consumer and the revenue. . . .” You won’t see any 
film clips of officers in bulletproof TTB vests raiding any compounds.

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
44
In California today, many wineries have two or more brands — 
their main brand, for example, and a secondary brand that usually 
sells for less money than the main brand. Wines carrying a second-
ary brand — or second label, as it’s often referred to in the wine 
trade — can come from the very same winery as the wines selling 
under the main brand, and the label might state that. But often, 
producers prefer to give the impression that the secondary brand 
is a freestanding operation. They do this by stating on the label, in 
small print, a name and address that suggests that the secondary 
brand is itself a winery. But if you were to drive to that town, you’d 
find only the main winery; the secondary winery exists on paper 
only. This practice is all perfectly legal, and we don’t see any harm 
in it except that it aggrandizes relatively minor brands.
Here’s another wrinkle on the same theme. These days, wineries 
in California and elsewhere create brands overnight to take advan-
tage of what they perceive to be marketing opportunities. These 
brands aren’t wineries at all: They’re just labels slapped on bottles 
of wine to sell the stuff. The wine might have been purchased from 
another winery ready-made or might have been blended from 
wines purchased from several different wineries. The source of 
the wine might be different from year to year. But the label usually 
states the name of the brand — as if it were a physical winery — 
along with the address of the brand owner (which might be just an 
office with a few desks in it). This practice bothers us a bit because 
we believe that it gives these brands more legitimacy in the eyes of 
wine buyers than they really deserve. But it’s perfectly legal.
The wine’s where and when
Labels of California wine (and other wines) carry a geographic 
designation that indicates the area where the grapes for that wine 
grew. California wine labels may state that the wine came, simply, 
Double clarity on labels of blended wines
Some wines are blends of two (or more) varieties and are named for both of them — 
for example, a Cabernet-Shiraz. In these cases, the label must state the percentage 
of each variety that the wine contains, and these varieties must be the only grapes 
used in the wine. Although most varietal labels keep you guessing about the actual 
grape variety content in the wine, a dual-varietal label tells you precisely which 
grapes you’re drinking.

 Chapter 3: Decoding the Label 45
from California, or they can indicate a specific county within 
California, or they can name a specific viticultural area (an officially 
recognized grape-growing region; see the section “Official Grape-
Growing Areas,” later in this chapter). If the geographic designa-
tion is California or the name of a county, only 75 percent of the 
wine must have come from that area.
Most California wine labels carry a vintage year. This is the year in 
which the grapes that made that wine were harvested. It’s almost 
always also the year that the grapes grew and the juice was vini-
fied to make that wine. Not 100 percent of the wine need come 
from that year, however:
 
✓ If the wine’s geographic designation is California or a county, 
85 percent of the wine must have come from grapes harvested 
in the year that’s indicated on the label.
 
✓ If the wine’s geographic designation is a specific viticultural 
area, 95 percent of the wine must have come from the vintage 
year indicated on the label.
If a wine doesn’t conform to these regulations, then it can’t carry 
a vintage year. It’s then known in the wine trade as a nonvintage 
wine. You’ll never find the word nonvintage on a label, however; 
you know a nonvintage wine only by the absence of a vintage year 
on the label. (Note: Sometimes the vintage year appears on a sepa-
rate neck label and sometimes that neck label falls off, leading you 
to believe that the wine is nonvintage when it’s not.)
Why the fudge factors for the geographic designation and vin-
tage year? They’re accommodations to producers to enable them 
to create precisely the wine that they want to make and sell. 
Producers might use wines from other areas or from other years 
for the same reasons that they might use grapes other than the 
named variety in their wine: to fine-tune the wine’s taste, to reduce 
costs, to improve quality, or to use up small lots of wine that 
would otherwise be wasted.
Alcohol content
We routinely look for the alcohol content information on California 
wine labels because it can tell us something about the style of 
the wine. (Generally speaking, the higher the alcohol content, 
the bigger and more powerful the style of the wine.) You’d think 
that this would be fairly straightforward information, but it’s not. 
Here’s why:

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
46
 
✓ If a label states that a wine is a table wine (by definition, a 
wine that’s less than 14 percent alcohol), the alcohol content 
need not appear on the label at all.
 
✓ For wines labeled with 14 percent or less alcohol, the wine’s 
actual alcohol content may be 1.5 percent greater or less than 
the stated alcohol content, with an upper limit of 14 percent. 
In other words, if the stated alcohol content is 13 percent, 
all that you really know is that the wine’s alcohol content is 
somewhere between 11.5 and 14 percent.
 
✓ What if a wine is more than 14 percent alcohol, which many 
California wines are? In that case, the wine’s actual alcohol 
content may be 1 percent higher or lower than what’s stated 
on the label but not less than 14 percent.
 
✓ The label can state the alcohol content as a range: a 3 percent 
range for wines of 14 percent or less alcohol (“11 to 14 per-
cent alcohol by volume”) and a 2 percent range for wines with 
more than 14 percent alcohol.
 
Why the 14 percent cutoff? Once upon a time, yeasts would not 
ferment juice beyond 14 percent alcohol; the alcohol would kill the 
yeasts, and the juice would stop fermenting. Therefore, wines with 
14 percent alcohol or less were considered products of natural 
fermentation, and wines with more alcohol were presumed to have 
gotten that way by the addition of alcohol. Now, heartier yeast 
strains take juice up to 16.5 percent or so.
Labeling carbs and calories
Regulations governing wine labels have changed fairly little over the past few 
decades. The sulfite warning, which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms 
(BATF) mandated in 1987, and the health warning, which Congress passed into law 
in 1988, are the only two substantial mandatory additions to wine labels in the past 
25 years or so.
But the head of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is on record 
as an ardent supporter of nutrient labeling (requiring wine labels to state calories, 
carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) as well as ingredient labeling. We’re sure that 
the majority of people who make and sell wine are not in favor of these require-
ments, mainly because they believe them to be unnecessary. Time will tell what 
happens.

 Chapter 3: Decoding the Label 47
Considering that the stated alcohol content doesn’t have to be 
true, you might wonder why we bother checking the alcohol con-
tent on wines that we drink. Good question. The answer is that 
the stated alcohol content is true in the relative sense, if not in the 
absolute. When we find a wine that’s 14.8 percent alcohol accord-
ing to its label, we know that it’s considerably higher in alcohol 
than a wine that admits to 13.5 percent alcohol. We can’t take the 
numbers literally, but they still mean something.
Wine producers, blenders, preparers, and bottlers
If we were to read on a soft drink label that the beverage was 
“bottled by [company name, city, state],” we’d think nothing of it. 
We know that soft drinks are churned out on an industrial scale of 
production in large soft drink factories and that bottling is the last 
step of this industrial process. But we expect more of wines. We 
like to think that wines are lovingly produced by passionate wine-
makers who also grew the grapes and nurtured those grapes to 
their fullest expression of flavor. To read that a wine was “bottled 
by so-and-so” somehow detaches the wine from its roots in the 
vineyard, in our minds, and smacks of cold commercialism.
Because many other wine drinkers also harbor romantic ideas 
about the grape-growing and winemaking process, wine producers 
are loathe to use the term bottled by and instead find other words 
to satisfy the requirements of the labeling regulations. Therefore, 
the regulations regulate the use of these other terms:
 
✓ Produced by/made by: These are the two most specific terms 
allowed. These phrases mean that the winery or company 
named on the label fermented at least 75 percent of the wine 
on the premises indicated on the address. It can also mean 
that the company
 
• Conducted a secondary fermentation of a base wine to 
make it a sparkling wine (read about California’s spar-
kling wines in Chapter 11)
 
• Added carbonation to a base wine to make it bubbly
 
• Fortified a base wine with alcohol (see Chapter 11)
 
• Completed other processes that determined the final 
nature of a wine

✓ Blended by: This term means that the named company mixed 
wines to create the final wine at the location indicated, but it 
didn’t necessarily produce any of the wines.
 
✓ Vinted by/cellared by/prepared by: These terms mean that 
the named company “subjected the wine to cellar treatment” 
at its premises; cellar treatment includes blending, oak treat-
ments, and other finishing touches.
 
Only the terms produced and made indicate that the named winery 
actually made the wine in the bottle — or 75 percent of it, anyway — 
and even then only if the wine is not a sparkling or fortified wine. 
Vinted is a clever way of making wine drinkers think that a wine was 
actually produced at the named winery when it wasn’t.
Of course, even if a wine is “produced by” a certain winery, you 
still don’t know whether that winery also grew the grapes for the 
wine — whether, in other words, the winery is totally accountable 
for the quality of the product from grapevine to bottle, as would 
be the case in our utopian view of wine. But another phrase on the 
label can tell you that. That phrase is estate bottled.
 
A wine company that also owns vineyards (as opposed to, for 
example, wineries that purchase and then blend grapes grown 
or wines made by someone else) is known as a wine estate. The 
phrase estate bottled on a wine label means that
 
✓ All the wine came from grapes grown on land owned or 
controlled by the winery named in the produced by phrase. 
Note that the winery can control the vineyards rather than 
own them outright; the usual control scenario is that the 
winery has a long-term lease on the vineyards and farms them 
as if they were its own.
 
✓ The winery and the vineyard are in the same viticultural 
area. If, for example, a winery in Napa Valley owns a vineyard 
across the county line in say, Russian River Valley, the wine 
from those grapes can’t be called estate bottled. This provision 
makes estate bottled one of the most highly regulated terms 
on a wine label. No fudge factor here. (See “Official Grape-
Growing Areas” for more on viticultural areas.)

 Chapter 3: Decoding the Label 49
Unregulated terms intended 
to influence you
A few years ago, someone at a wine tasting turned to us, pointed 
to a phrase on a wine label, and asked us, “What does this mean?” 
The phrase was estate grown. We thought about it for a minute 
because we’d never encountered that term before. Finally, we 
replied that we had no idea what it means — and we still don’t. This 
term is unregulated: The regulations don’t define it, which means 
that anyone can use it to mean anything. Obviously, the intention 
behind this term is to make you think that a wine is estate bottled 
(see the preceding section). But really all it says is that the grapes 
for that wine grew on some estate somewhere. And any vineyard 
can be an estate, because that, also, is an unregulated term.
The singular vineyard
Sometimes on a wine label, in addition to the name of the winery, the name of the 
wine, and the region of production, you can find the name of the specific vineyard 
where the grapes for that wine grew. In wine circles, wines that come from just one 
vineyard are known as single-vineyard wines.
In some vague way, single-vineyard wines carry a certain prestige. They reflect 
not just the normal character of grapes grown in that wine region but the more 
specific characteristics of grapes grown in that specific vineyard. If the vineyard is 
a particularly fine one, blessed with special soil or very old vines, for example, then 
the wine can in fact be special. The catch is that not every vineyard is special, and 
naming the vineyard on the label doesn’t make it so.
A variation on the single-vineyard theme is a label that names the overall vineyard 
property from which the grapes came. The vineyard property mentioned can be 
very large, and the grapes purchased to make the wine could have come from any 
or all parts of the property. The point behind such a label is not so much to suggest 
that the wine is special because it comes from a special vineyard (although that’s 
always a bit of an implication) as to give specific information on the source of the 
grapes that connoisseurs find useful.
In any case, the use of single-vineyard names and vineyard property names on 
wine labels is unregulated turf — as is the very definition of what constitutes a 
specific vineyard.

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
50
Several other unregulated terms adorn wine labels. Take the 
word reserve, for example. On a bottle of California wine, this 
term means absolutely nothing. But you’re supposed to think that 
somehow the wine is of high quality, because in some parts of the 
world, the term is regulated and does imply a higher quality level 
than a non-reserve wine.
 
The term reserve can have meaning within the context of an indi-
vidual winery’s production. For example, the Clos du Val winery in 
Napa Valley makes two Cabernet Sauvignon wines, one of which is 
the Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve; the reserve wine is more expen-
sive (and of higher quality, in the eyes of the producer) than the 
Clos du Val Cabernet Sauvignon. A reserve wine might be made 
from the winery’s very best grapes, or it might have aged longer 
than its non-reserve counterpart before being released.
Many inexpensive and mid-priced California wines state private 
reserve or vintner’s reserve on their labels. These are simply brand 
terms, and they have no real meaning. Neither do terms such as 
private selection or special selection.
Official Grape-Growing Areas
Every wine label must state the origin of the grapes that went into 
making the wine. Some origins, such as California or Washington, 
are self-explanatory: The grapes grew somewhere in that state. 
But other origins are more mysterious. Where on earth are the 
Sta. Rita Hills, for example, and is that anywhere near Dry Creek 
Valley? And, you might ask, why does it matter, anyway? What’s so 
important about the origin of the grapes that it must be stated on 
the label? This section explains officially recognized grape-growing 
areas and why they matter.
Europe’s tradition of 
viticultural areas
Part of the reason that the origin of the grapes is important is that 
the place where the grapes grow influences the taste and the qual-
ity of the wine. In Chapter 1, we mention a few ways that a locale 
can influence the grapes grown there.

 Chapter 3: Decoding the Label 51
Another reason is that the origin of the grapes has traditionally 
(that means, in Europe) been the name of the wine — its very 
identity. To protect the authenticity of each wine, every European 
country that produces wine has regulations that spell out the pre-
cise territory that each place-name covers. These regulations pre-
vent a wine producer whose grapes come from a vineyard located 
outside a specific territory, such as Burgundy, from calling his 
wine by the territory name Burgundy.
Most European regulations go way beyond simply defining the ter-
ritory of wine regions. They also dictate which grape varieties can 
be used to make the wine of each territory name, as well as other 
details of the wine’s production, such as how long it must age 
before being released, how much alcohol content it may have, and 
so forth. These details help create some consistency among the 
wines that have each place name.
In the European model, the regulations cover only certain specific 
grape-growing regions — those that authorities of each country 
consider worthy of defining and protecting. These regions are offi-
cial appellations of origin, or registered place names.
AVAs, America’s version 
of European tradition
Like Europe, the U.S. has registered vineyard areas. These are 
called American Viticultural Areas, commonly abbreviated as AVAs. 
Because most American wines are named for their grape variety 
rather than their origin, American regulations defining viticultural 
areas are less all-encompassing than most European regulations 
(see the preceding section). They define the boundaries of the ter-
ritory in question but don’t dictate grape varieties that growers 
can use, how they can grow the grapes, or how the winemakers 
can make the wine. In the Land of the Free, grape growers and 
winemakers are free to decide those issues for themselves.
The agency that regulates registered viticultural areas in the U.S. 
is the TTB (see the section “Label Terms and What They [Sorta] 
Mean,” earlier in this chapter). Right off the bat, the U.S. regula-
tions recognize every state, and every county within every state, 
as geographic designations that may be used on wine labels. All 
other areas must go through an approval process with the TTB to 
become official AVAs.

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
52
 
Here’s how the AVA approval process works: The TTB first 
receives a petition from one or more individuals or companies who 
want to see a particular area earn status as an AVA. The petition 
must state the boundaries of the viticultural area, prove that the 
proposed name of the area is already associated with that terri-
tory, provide evidence of geographical features that distinguish 
the proposed area from surrounding areas (such as climate, soil, 
elevation, or physical features), and so forth. If the TTB approves 
the petition, it develops a set of proposed regulations based on the 
petition, announces these in the Federal Register, and establishes 
a public comment period. After reviewing any comments received, 
the TTB can make the proposed regulations effective.
California had 104 AVAs as of the summer of 2008. Some of these 
are world-famous, but others are still fairly obscure even to wine 
lovers who live in the U.S. and perhaps even to wine lovers who 
live in California!
Small, large, and overlapping AVAs
California’s AVAs range in size from 150 acres (Cole Ranch AVA) 
to 4 million acres (Central Coast AVA). Large AVAs usually encom-
pass smaller AVAs within their borders or partially within their 
borders. Here are some examples:
 
✓ Chalk Hill and Sonoma County Green Valley are small AVAs 
within the larger Russian River Valley AVA — which itself lies 
within the territory of the larger Northern Sonoma AVA, which 
itself lies partially within the Sonoma Coast AVA.
 
✓ Rutherford, Yountville, Oakville, and Howell Mountain — to 
name just a few — all lie within the larger Napa Valley AVA.
These regions-within-regions are sometimes referred to as subap-
pellations or sub-AVAs.
When the grapes for a wine come from an AVA that overlaps with 
other AVAs, the wine producer can decide which name to use on 
the label of the wine. This decision often has to do with how well-
known the AVAs are. Although the smaller AVA is inherently more 
prestigious because it’s more specific and therefore more exclu-
sive, the larger AVA often has more recognition. For example, a 
winery making a Chardonnay from grapes grown in the prestigious 
Santa Lucia Highlands might decide to list the wine’s origin as 
Monterey on the label because the larger Monterey AVA has more 

 Chapter 3: Decoding the Label 53
recognition among wine drinkers. Another example: Wines that 
come from grapes grown in Rutherford or Oakville — two presti-
gious AVAs within Napa Valley — often use both the smaller AVA 
name and the name Napa Valley, because Napa Valley carries far 
more recognition.
Table 3-1 lists all the AVAs within California and the counties in 
which they’re situated. Don’t be surprised if you recognize only a 
few of them.

California’s Major 
Wine Regions
In This Chapter
▶ World-famous Napa Valley
▶ Charming, versatile Sonoma

W
ine grapes flourish throughout much of California — as 
far north as Mendocino County in the upper third of the 
state, as far west as the edge of the Pacific Ocean, and as far east 
as the city of Fresno. Napa Valley and Sonoma County, north of San 
Francisco, are of course world-famous wine destinations. But the 
last 30 years have also witnessed the emergence of Santa Barbara 
and Monterey along the state’s central coast and Anderson Valley 
in Mendocino County — to mention just a few of the new hot spots 
for California wine.
In this chapter, we take a good look at the major California wine 
regions, all of which welcome more and more visitors each year.
Location Matters
Centuries of experience have proven that the place where grapes 
grow influences their nature and therefore the nature of the wine 
made from them. In Chapter 1, we describe some of the ways that 
California’s climate, soil, and topography vary from one part of the 
state to the next. Like the differences in growing conditions, the dif-
ferences in wines from region to region can be subtle or dramatic.

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
58
California’s wine producers didn’t always take the issue of regional 
differences, or terroir, as seriously as they do today. However, 
those who make fine wine all over California now have real respect 
for the individual distinctions that make one vineyard different 
from the next and that make every wine region unique. Grape 
growers and wineries in specific regions have banded together, 
funded research, and shared their experiences to better define and 
understand the intricate nature of their own region’s terroir.
Although plenty of California wines come from the grapes of mul-
tiple regions rather than from the grapes of a specific region (the 
labels of these wines simply state the wines’ origin as California), 
a wine’s region of production is an increasingly important con-
sideration in buying fine wine from California. Figure 4-1 depicts 
California’s main wine regions.
Figure 4-1: The wine regions of California.

 Chapter 4: California’s Major Wine Regions 59
Napa Valley: Wine 
Country’s Hollywood
When someone utters the words Napa Valley, the first image that 
springs to most people’s minds is of wine. Napa Valley is by far the 
best-known, most prestigious wine region in the New World. And 
yet only about 4 percent of California’s wine comes from the very 
expensive vineyard lands of Napa Valley!
 
Today, nearly 400 wineries produce wine from about 47,000 acres 
of vineyards in Napa Valley. The wine boom there is a relatively 
recent phenomenon: Only 25 wineries existed there in 1960. Most 
of Napa Valley’s wineries are small operations, although a few large 
wineries, such as Robert Mondavi Winery, Beringer, and Sutter 
Home, are based in Napa County.
Many Napa Valley wineries own large vineyards, which surround 
their properties like gorgeous manicured lawns. Other wineries 
don’t own vineyards but instead buy their grapes from indepen-
dent grape growers or buy juice or bulk wine from other wine 
producers. And some Napa Valley wine producers (including some 
winery names that you see on very expensive bottles of wine) sur-
prisingly don’t have their own wineries; they bring their grapes to 
custom-crush wine facilities, which they rent — all for the distinc-
tion of making “Napa Valley wine.”
 
Reading about Napa Valley and its wines can be confusing at times 
because the name Napa actually applies to three entities:
 
✓ The political entity is Napa County.
 
✓ The city of Napa, situated at the southern end of the county, 
is the county seat.
 
✓ Napa Valley is the name of the AVA — that is, the official 
American Viticultural Area within Napa County (see Chapter 3 
for more on AVAs).
For all practical purposes, the territory within the Napa Valley AVA 
is the same as that within Napa County. (The AVA doesn’t encom-
pass Lake Berryessa in the eastern part of the county, for example, 
but no one could grow grapes there, anyway.)

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine

Mapping Napa Valley
Napa Valley is not large: It’s about 30 miles long and 5 miles wide 
at its widest point, around the city of Napa. To put that in an inter-
national perspective, it’s only about one-eighth the size of France’s 
famous Bordeaux wine region.
In addition to the broad Napa Valley AVA and the even broader 
(six-county) North Coast AVA, Napa Valley has 14 distinct viticul-
tural areas that are considered subappellations of the Napa Valley 
AVA itself. An additional subappellation, Calistoga, is pending. The 
following are the standing Napa Valley AVAs, which you can also 
see in Figure 4-2:
 
✓ Mount Veeder; Spring Mountain District; Diamond Mountain 
District
 
✓ Oak Knoll District; Yountville; Oakville; Rutherford; St. Helena
 
✓ Howell Mountain; Stags Leap District; Atlas Peak
 
✓ Chiles Valley District
 
✓ Wild Horse Valley
 
✓ Los Carneros
Although not a large area, Napa Valley has an enviable range of soil 
types and climatic differences. Mountains surround Napa Valley 
on both sides — the Mayacamas Mountains to the west and the 
Vaca Mountains to the east — and the Napa River runs north-south 
through the valley. Soils vary according to how close to the river a 
vineyard is or how far into the hills or mountains it is, among other 
factors.
The climate in Napa Valley is generally warm and dry, but a domi-
nant feature of the region is the combination of cool winds and 
fog that sweeps up the valley from the San Pablo Bay in the south. 
Summer weather in the southern part of the valley, in wine dis-
tricts such as Carneros, Yountville, and Oakville, for example, can 
be distinctly cooler than that of the Calistoga area at the north end 
of the valley.
Napa Valley sits next to Sonoma County. The Mayacamas 
Mountains separate the two counties from each other for most of 
their length, but in the south, the terrain is open and flatter, and 
driving from one county to the other is easier (see the nearby 
sidebar “Sonoma and Napa: Crossing from county to county”). In 
fact, the two counties share a wine district, Los Carneros, at their 
southern ends.

 Chapter 4: California’s Major Wine Regions 61
Figure 4-2: Napa Valley and its AVAs.
Napa’s key wines
Napa Valley certainly benefits from its range of growing condi-
tions. Winemakers of the region produce every major type of wine 
we discuss in Parts II and III of this book, along with some of the 
lesser-known whites and reds. Here’s how the wines compare in 
terms of production.

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
62
Cabernets, Napa Valley’s top wines
 
We believe that Napa Valley’s best wines are its Cabernet 
Sauvignons and Cabernet blends. The generally warm, dry climate 
of Napa Valley suits the Cabernet Sauvignon grape variety just 
fine. Even though Cabernet Sauvignon wines are produced in many 
regions throughout the world, only France’s Bordeaux region and 
Napa Valley have achieved world-class status for wines made from 
this popular variety. In Chapter 6, we name our favorite Cabernet 
Sauvignons and Cabernet blends from Napa Valley.
Other important reds
Merlot remains Napa Valley’s second most produced red wine 
after Cabernet Sauvignon. When not made as a varietal wine, 
Merlot is invariably blended into Cabernet Sauvignon (in small 
quantities, such as 10 percent) or blended into other Napa Valley 
red wines. We name our favorite Napa Valley Merlots in Chapter 6.
Pinot Noir is Napa Valley’s third most produced varietal red wine, 
and that was true even before the film Sideways. Although this 
award-winning movie definitely increased Pinot Noir wine produc-
tion in California, the effect in Napa Valley was limited by the land: 
In Napa Valley, Pinot Noir grows primarily in Carneros, the Valley’s 
coolest district. See Chapter 7 for our recommended Napa Valley 
Pinot Noirs.
Sonoma and Napa: Crossing 
from county to county
The easiest way to get from Napa to Sonoma Valley and vice versa is to head to 
the southern end of either valley (the Carneros district) and cross over along the 
Sonoma Highway (California 12/121). From Napa to Sonoma, the trip takes about 
20 minutes, assuming that there’s no traffic. Another option is to take the Oakville 
Grade (also known as Trinity Rd.) over the Mayacamas Range, which links Oakville 
in Napa with Glen Ellen in Sonoma. It’s an extremely steep and windy road, but it 
can be a real timesaver if you’re headed to the northern end of either valley.
Getting to Northern Sonoma is a snap from Sonoma Valley. Just follow Highway 
12, which runs north to south and connects Sonoma Valley’s towns, north to get 
to Santa Rosa. From there, jump on Highway 101 north and exit at the town of your 
choice.

 Chapter 4: California’s Major Wine Regions 63
Zinfandel — the original red version — is Napa Valley’s fourth 
largest red varietal wine in production, although as with Pinot 
Noir, Sonoma is more renowned than Napa Valley for Zinfandel. 
(Note: White Zinfandel, which is really pink, comes primarily 
from California’s inland Central Valley.) See Chapter 8 for our red 
Zinfandel favorites from Napa Valley.
Blended wines have become increasingly popular in Napa Valley. 
Three of Napa Valley’s elite reds, Opus One, Rubicon, and 
Dominus, are red wine blends (although all are primarily made 
from Cabernet Sauvignon). Most Napa Valley blended wines 
use the grape varieties famous in France’s Bordeaux region — 
Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and sometimes Petit 
Verdot and/or Malbec. We recommend Napa Valley red blends in 
Chapter 6.
Napa Valley’s whites
Chardonnay continues to be Napa Valley’s most popular white 
wine by a good margin. Sauvignon Blanc (sometimes labeled Fumé 
Blanc) is Napa Valley’s second favorite white. Newcomers such 
as Pinot Grigio/Gris and Viognier (see Chapter 9) are beginning to 
make inroads into Chardonnay’s dominance, however. Some wine 
drinkers just want a little more variety in their white wine choices! 
See Chapter 5 for our recommended Chardonnays and Sauvignon 
Blancs from Napa Valley.
As with the blended red wines, most Napa Valley blended white 
wines use grape varieties famous in Bordeaux — in this case, 
Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon (pronounced seh-me-yohn).
Getting to and staying 
in Napa Valley
San Francisco and Oakland are the entry cities via air for Napa 
Valley, which is about 60 miles northeast of these cities. The drive 
from both cities over Oakland Bay Bridge or Golden Gate Bridge is 
about 90 minutes.
 
For touring Napa Valley, a more luxurious (albeit costlier) alterna-
tive to a car rental is limousine service; this is an especially good 
option if you don’t have a designated driver with you and you’re 
splitting the cost among a group of four to six people.

You have tons of places to choose for lodging, ranging from gran-
diose, posh resorts to chain hotels and motels. You can easily find 
the hotel or inn to fit your budget online. In this space, we high-
light some of our favorite places to stay. Two upscale (over $500 a 
night) destinations provide luxury accommodations in the Valley:
Napa’s restaurants, among 
the best in the nation
When we first visited Napa Valley 30-plus years ago, there were only a couple of 
restaurants for fine dining. Now Napa Valley is one of the elite dining destinations 
in the United States. At the top of Napa’s list of great restaurants is The French 
Laundry, one of the finest restaurants in the country, if not the world. The only 
problem is that reservations are almost impossible to obtain (and most meals will 
set you back about $240, including the service but not the wine). But don’t despair. 
We name some of our other favorite (and less expensive) Napa Valley restaurants 
here, in no particular order:
 ✓ Auberge du Soleil: The other great French restaurant in Napa Valley, besides 
The French Laundry. Great wine list; amazing views.
 ✓ étoile: Domaine Chandon, one of California’s original wineries for sparkling 
wine, is still running a top restaurant in Yountville, 30 years after the winery 
opened.
 ✓ Mustard’s Grill: A Napa Valley classic. California cuisine; great burgers and 
barbecued ribs. Popular with winemakers. On Highway 29 in Yountville.
 ✓ Cindy’s Backstreet Kitchen: Chef/owner Cindy Pawlcyn’s other, more casual 
restaurant in St. Helena (Mustard’s and Go Fish are also Cindy’s).
 ✓ Bouchon and Bistro Jeanty: Two wonderful, casual French restaurants in 
Yountville. Moderately priced.
 ✓ Brix: Another casual restaurant on Highway 29 (in Yountville) featuring 
California cuisine.
 ✓ Redd: Modern, fairly new restaurant in Yountville featuring California cuisine.
 ✓ Terra: Small, homey French restaurant in St. Helena; one of the older places to 
eat in the Valley; still one of the best.
 ✓ Tra Vigne: One of the two great Italian restaurants in St. Helena; an old favorite.
 ✓ Martini House: The other top Italian St. Helena restaurant. Quite large and 
beautiful. Excellent wine list!
 ✓ Bistro Don Giovanni: Casual, good value Italian restaurant in Napa; outdoor 
dining available.

 Chapter 4: California’s Major Wine Regions 65
 
✓ Auberge du Soleil: This “Inn of the Sun” is one of the oldest 
and still one of the best inns in Napa Valley. A resort that’s 
part of the Relais et Chateaux group, Auberge du Soleil has a 
wonderful location in the hillsides east of Rutherford village 
and an outstanding view from its excellent French restaurant.
 
✓ Meadowood Resort: This is a huge facility east of St. Helena, 
with many private cottages tucked into the woods. It also has 
a very fine restaurant.
Five comfortable, fine inns extend from the city of Napa in the 
south part of the Valley northward to the town of St. Helena. 
Villagio and Harvest Inn are generally over $400 a night, and the 
other three are less than $300 a night.
 
✓ Villagio Inn: Located in Yountville, close to Domaine Chandon 
winery, Villagio offers large rooms, top service, and an excel-
lent breakfast. It’s one of our favorites.
 
✓ Harvest Inn: Harvest Inn is just off Route 29 as you enter St. 
Helena from the south. It has modern, well-appointed rooms 
and cabins, and it’s quite luxurious.
 
✓ Napa River Inn: Right in downtown Napa on the Napa River, 
this inn offers peaceful accommodations at reasonable prices.
 
✓ Rancho Caymus: Rancho Caymus is centrally located and is 
designed in the Spanish architectural motif. It’s in Rutherford 
on Route 29, close to Beaulieu Vineyard Winery.
 
✓ Wine Country Inn: Here’s another one of our old favorites, 
just north and a bit east of St. Helena. Wine Country Inn is 
rustic, charming, and bucolic.
Sonoma County: Hardly 
an Also-ran!
Sonoma County is on California’s North Coast, directly north of 
San Francisco and about an hour’s drive from the majestic Golden 
Gate Bridge. It borders Napa Valley to the east but extends farther 
north. Sonoma is more than twice as large as Napa, and the winer-
ies are more spread out. You have to allow more driving time when 
visiting Sonoma’s wineries, which now number over 250.
Sonoma (see Figure 4-3) has 3 general American Viticultural Areas 
(AVAs) and 11 specific AVAs, in addition to being part of the 
huge North Coast AVA, which takes in six counties north of San 
Francisco. Here are Sonoma’s general AVAs:

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
66
 
✓ Sonoma County AVA
 
✓ Northern Sonoma AVA (an area that includes Russian River 
Valley, Alexander Valley, Dry Creek Valley, and Knights Valley, 
along with other territory)
 
✓ Sonoma Coast, an elongated area in western Sonoma, along 
the Pacific coast (Note: The Sonoma Coast AVA is particularly 
known for its Pinot Noir.)
Figure 4-3: Sonoma County and its wine regions.
Sonoma differs from Napa in climate, in the wines that do best, and 
in attitude:
 
✓ Climate: In general, much of Sonoma is cooler than Napa, 
especially in Sonoma’s coastal areas.
 
✓ Top wines: The cooler areas of Sonoma, such as Russian River 
Valley, Green Valley, and the Sonoma Coast, produce some of 
California’s finest Pinot Noirs, Chardonnays, Zinfandels, and 
sparkling wines. Napa’s generally warmer climate provides an 
especially suitable environment for Cabernet Sauvignon, that 
county’s most renowned wine.

 Chapter 4: California’s Major Wine Regions 67
 
✓ Attitude: Sonoma doesn’t have the glitz and glamour of Napa 
Valley; it’s more laid back. One of the great benefits of this is 
that fewer tourists visit Sonoma’s wineries, and except during 
rush hour, you don’t find the traffic problems that you can 
find in Napa Valley, especially in the summer.
Sonoma also has more than its share of some of California’s largest 
and most famous wineries, such as Gallo Family Wineries, Kendall-
Jackson, Korbel, Simi, Sebastiani, Jordan, and Gloria Ferrer, to 
name a few. Serious wine lovers could easily spend a week each in 
both Sonoma and Napa, just visiting some of the top wineries.
An idyllic wine region
In many ways, Sonoma is the most charming wine region in 
California. It has a little bit of everything, from Old World charm 
to modern wineries and fine restaurants. Going from the southern 
part of Sonoma to the north, some of its highlights include the fol-
lowing wineries, cities, and towns:
 
✓ Gloria Ferrer Winery: In windswept, western Carneros, Gloria 
Ferrer is part of Spain’s Freixenet — the largest sparkling wine 
producer in the world. The winery is an architectural wonder, 
and its sparkling wines are among the best in California.
 
✓ Buena Vista Winery: Also in Carneros, the dramatically beau-
tiful Buena Vista is California’s oldest continually operating 
winery (since 1857). Guided and self-guided tours are avail-
able. Wines are reasonably priced.
 
✓ Town of Sonoma: Dominated by its huge plaza, this fascinat-
ing old Spanish mission town is a must-see. Many fine winer-
ies are nearby, including Ravenswood (the great Zinfandel 
specialist) and Hanzell (one of California’s finest Chardonnay 
producers). Great cheese shops (try the Sonoma Jack) and 
bread shops offer their wares for picnickers.
 
✓ Village of Glen Ellen: Just north of the town of Sonoma and 
south of Santa Rosa, this beautiful little village of about 1,000 
residents was the home of one of America’s great authors, 
Jack London, and one of its greatest food writers, MFK Fisher. 
Benziger Family Winery is also in Glen Ellen.
 
✓ Santa Rosa: In the center of the county, Santa Rosa is the larg-
est city in Napa/Sonoma wine country, with lots of hotels and 
fine restaurants.

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
68
 
✓ Healdsburg: In Northern Sonoma, the town of Healdsburg is 
ideally located for winery visits because it’s surrounded by 
three great Sonoma wine regions: Alexander Valley, Dry Creek 
Valley, and the Russian River Valley. Simi Winery is also in 
Healdsburg. The town has great restaurants, such as Cyrus 
and Bistro Ralph, plus lots of fine hotels and bed and break-
fast inns (some of which you can find in the nearby “Staying in 
Healdsburg” sidebar).
Staying in Healdsburg
The town of Healdsburg is a popular place to stay in Northern Sonoma. Keep in 
mind that during the high season — between June and November — most hotels 
charge peak rates and sell out completely on weekends; many have a two-night 
minimum. Always ask about discounts. For more lodging options, check sonoma.

One block off Healdsburg Square, the exterior of Northern Sonoma’s most luxurious 
inn is so understated that you’re likely to pass it. But inside the three-floor hotel, 
there’s no mistaking the opulence. The lobby alone smacks of old-world French 
luxury accommodations, and the 16 individually decorated rooms are equally plush. 
Swathed in creams and warm beiges and furnished with hand-selected 18th and 
19th century European antiques, they’re equipped with the likes of a canopy bed 
with Italian linens, a large TV and DVD player, a marble bathroom with a whirl-
pool soaking tub and walk-in shower, and personal touches at every turn, and they 
feel more like a rich friend’s home than a hotel. Each morning, guests are treated 
to a continental breakfast in the wood-paneled library, and during evenings they 
have easy access to the region’s finest restaurant, Cyrus, which adjoins the hotel. 
Without a doubt this is the finest place to stay in the region. 16 units. $495–$995

This home away from home across the street from the plaza is a visitor favorite 
because not only does it have spacious, comfortable rooms adorned with country-
chic furnishings (You’ll find no doilies and lace here!), but it also has amenities asso-
ciated with a true hotel. Want to spend the day spa-ing it? You’re golden. Lounge by

Guests who stay at this small luxury inn don’t want to leave their rooms — a jaunt 
to one of the nearby vineyards or a stroll up to the main square of town might be in 
order, but then it’s back to the mansion. Maybe it’s the fluffy featherbeds, winter 
and summer bathrobes, or delicious toiletries. If you are in one of the particularly 
splendid units boasting a claw-foot tub, cozy gas fireplace, or a private deck with a 
Jacuzzi, you might only get up to help yourself to the decanter of sherry placed in 
each room. Be sure to indulge in breakfast, a decadent, two- to three-course affair 
(think Mexican eggs, baked blintz, or soufflé French toast and espresso chocolate 
chip muffins) served in the parlor of this 1883 Italianate Victorian or on the redwood 
deck overlooking the pond. As if this isn’t enough, you’ll also find bocce and tennis 
courts, a huge lap pool, a croquet lawn, afternoon wine and cheese, a 24-hour self-
serve espresso and cappuccino machine in the main building, and a never-ending

Sonoma’s signatures: Pinot 
Noir and Zinfandel
Sonoma County succeeds with many diverse wines, but if we had 
to name its two most renowned wines, they’d be Pinot Noir and 
Zinfandel.
Many wine critics believe that the nation’s best Pinot Noirs 
come from Sonoma’s Russian River Valley. Other wine regions 
also have a Pinot following: Carneros and the Sonoma Coast, in 
Sonoma County (with Carneros extending into Napa Valley); Santa 
Barbara; Santa Lucia Highlands; Mendocino’s Anderson Valley; and 
Oregon’s Willamette Valley, for example. But Russian River Pinot 
Noirs have a combination of richness, voluptuousness, balance, 
and elegance that’s hard to beat. We name some of our favorite 
Sonoma Pinot Noirs, including Russian River Valley’s, in Chapter 7.
Zinfandel is truly California’s wine. Even though the grape’s genetic 
origin has been traced to Croatia, most of the world’s Zinfandels, 
red and pink, are Californian. And most wine experts agree that 
a majority of the best Zins (as they’re called for short) hail from 
Sonoma. Dry Creek Valley is particularly famous for red Zinfandel 
(the only color of Zin that Zin fanatics recognize). Russian River 
Valley and other Sonoma AVAs also produce fine Zinfandels, but 
in Dry Creek Valley, delicious, spicy Zinfandel is a real specialty. In 
Chapter 8, we recommend some of our favorite Sonoma Zinfandels, 
including those from Dry Creek Valley.
Sonoma’s wines: Something 
for everyone
Sonoma’s vineyards and wineries extend from Carneros in the 
south to Alexander Valley in the north — a much larger area than 
Napa Valley’s (see the earlier section on Napa). Because Sonoma 
is so large, and because it has both coastal and interior wine dis-
tricts, its climate varies from one wine district to another more 
than Napa’s climate does.
In fact, the varied climate and soils of Sonoma offer more different 
types of wine than any other wine region in California. For exam-
ple, the vineyard areas of Alexander Valley and Geyserville (in the 
north) and the Sonoma Mountain area (farther south) can be quite 
warm and dry, and they’re ideal growing regions for Cabernet 

 Chapter 4: California’s Major Wine Regions 71
Sauvignon. The cooler regions, such as the Russian River Valley, 
Green Valley, Forestville, and the Sonoma Coast, produce excellent 
Pinot Noirs, Chardonnays, and sparkling wines. Temperate areas in 
Sonoma grow Zinfandel, Syrah, Merlot, Sauvignon Blanc, and Petite 
Sirah, to name a few of the more prominent varieties. But there are 
many more.
 
A short drive from one of Sonoma’s viticultural areas to another 
can be a revelation: Each area seems to specialize in different 
wines. The following are the 11 distinct AVAs in Sonoma County, 
listed approximately from south to north, and the wines that are 
most renowned there:
 
✓ Los Carneros (partly in Napa Valley): Pinot Noir, 
Chardonnay, Merlot, sparkling wine
 
✓ Sonoma Valley: Chardonnay
 
✓ Sonoma Mountain: Cabernet Sauvignon
 
✓ Bennett Valley: Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot
 
✓ Green Valley (within Russian River Valley): Sparkling wine, 
Chardonnay, Pinot Noir
 
✓ Russian River Valley: Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, sparkling wine, 
Zinfandel
 
✓ Knights Valley: Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc
 
✓ Chalk Hill (within Russian River Valley): Chardonnay, 
Sauvignon Blanc
 
✓ Dry Creek Valley: Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon
 
✓ Alexander Valley: Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, 
Sauvignon Blanc
 
✓ Rockpile: Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petite Sirah
More Key Wine Regions
Napa Valley and Sonoma County might be California’s most famous 
wine regions, but they’re only part of today’s wine story in the 
Golden State. North, east, and south of Napa and Sonoma, vine-
yards grow all sorts of grape varieties for producing all kinds of 
wines. This section first heads north, to idyllic Mendocino and 
Lake Counties, before covering the rest of the major wine regions 
in the state.

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
72
Up the North Coast to Mendocino 
and Lake Counties
California’s majestic redwood sequoia trees, some as much as 
2,000 years old, are among the oldest living things on Earth. If 
you follow the giant redwoods — which begin in the Muir Woods 
just north of San Francisco — up the coastline through Sonoma 
County, you find forests full of them into Mendocino County and 
beyond, all the way north to Oregon. For us, California’s northern 
coast is one of the most beautiful parts of the U.S., if not the world. 
You don’t find too many wine tourists in the region, even in the 
summer, and wineries genuinely welcome visitors up here.
 
The old town of Mendocino, on the coast, is a fantastic place to 
stay when visiting the wineries of Mendocino County. The place 
resembles a New England coastal town in the architectural style of 
its houses much more than a typical California town. There used 
to be a standing joke that Mendocino was populated mainly by 
old beatniks from the ’50s and hippies from the ’60s. There’s still 
something a bit wild about Mendocino, but nowadays you also find 
lots of fine little restaurants and interesting places to stay.
If you want an even quainter locale, try the hamlet of Boonville; it’s 
located in the heart of cool Anderson Valley — Mendocino’s prime 
grape-growing district. Anderson Valley is ideal for Pinot Noir, 
Chardonnay, Gewurztraminer, Riesling, and some of the country’s 
best sparkling wines, including those of the renowned Roederer 
Estate winery (see Chapter 11).
The other major wine district in Mendocino County lies in the 
eastern, somewhat warmer part of the county. Redwood Valley 
is home of Fetzer Vineyards, one of California’s largest wineries, 
with its organic winery affiliate, Bonterra Vineyards. This area of 
Mendocino is best known for its Syrah, Petite Sirah, and Zinfandel.
Directly north of Napa County lies the smallish, off-the-beaten path 
Lake County, dominated by Clear Lake, California’s largest natural 
lake. Here you find Lake County’s best-known vineyards: Guenoc 
Vineyards and its sister winery, Langtry Estate. You also find a 
number of smaller wineries, many of which have sprung up in the 
past ten years or so. Cabernet Sauvignon is the leading varietal 
wine in Lake County, and Sauvignon Blanc is Lake County’s most 
important white wine.

 Chapter 4: California’s Major Wine Regions 73
Down the Central Coast
California’s so-called Central Coast is a huge area that extends 
from San Francisco to Santa Barbara. This area is actually a col-
lection of separate wine districts, each with its own identity (see 
Figure 4-4). From north to south, these areas are
 
✓ Livermore Valley and Santa Clara Valley
 
✓ Santa Cruz Mountains
 
✓ Monterey, Carmel, and the Santa Lucia Highlands
 
✓ Paso Robles (San Luis Obispo County)
 
✓ Edna Valley (San Luis Obispo County)
 
✓ The Santa Maria and Santa Ynez Valleys
In this section, we take one area at a time, listing the wines each 
region does best.
Livermore Valley and Santa Clara Valley
East and south of San Francisco, large tracts of vineyards used to 
exist. Now urban sprawl, from the cities of Palo Alto to San José 
(California’s Silicon Valley), has usurped most of the vineyards in 
Livermore Valley, which is east of San Francisco, and Santa Clara 
Valley, which runs south of San Francisco.
But 39 wineries still exist in Livermore Valley, including two major 
operations: Wente Family Estates and Concannon Vineyard, both 
historic wineries. Livermore Valley has always been known for its 
Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, as well as Chardonnay, although 
Concannon’s signature wine is Petite Sirah. Three other popular 
Livermore Valley wineries are Murrieta’s Well, Page Mill, and 
Tamás Estates, the latter known for its Cal-Ital varietals (varietal 
wines made from native Italian grapes grown in California, such as 
Sangiovese and Barbera; we discuss these wines in Chapter 10).
Santa Clara Valley includes the Santa Cruz Mountains district, 
but we regard the Mountains as a separate wine zone because 
the wines there are so distinct (see the next section). The area of 
Santa Clara that’s east of Santa Cruz Mountains, around San José, 
still has two major wineries: J. Lohr and Mirassou Vineyards. The 
latter is now part of the Gallo wine empire. Chardonnay, Cabernet 
Sauvignon, and Merlot are the three major wines in this part of the 
Santa Clara Valley.

Figure 4-4: The Central Coast wine regions.
Santa Cruz Mountains
Only an hour’s drive south of San Francisco, the rugged, isolated 
Santa Cruz Mountains seem to be a world apart from urban life. 
Although Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grow well on the cooler, 
ocean side of the mountains, most of the wineries — including 
California stalwarts such as Ridge (with its renowned Monte Bello 
Vineyard) and Mount Eden Vineyards — are located on the San 
Francisco Bay side. Magnificent Cabernet Sauvignon grows up 
here, as does Chardonnay.

 Chapter 4: California’s Major Wine Regions 75
 
We count 80 wineries in the Santa Cruz Mountains, but by the time 
you read this, the number will undoubtedly be higher. These win-
eries are California’s little secret. Even though a number of high-
quality wineries such as Bonny Doon, Thomas Fogarty, Kathryn 
Kennedy, David Bruce, and Cinnabar are here, most wine tourists 
head north to Napa Valley or Sonoma instead — and lately, they go 
south to Santa Barbara, since the 2004 film Sideways brought celeb-
rity status to that area. If you’re considering visiting the Santa Cruz 
Mountains, you’ll be pleased to know that the area isn’t actually as 
isolated as it seems to be when you’re in its midst. The city of San 
José, with its major airport, is less than 15 miles away.
Monterey County
Monterey County has a wealth of attractions, including its beautiful 
coastline, the Monterey Bay, Pebble Beach golf course, a wildlife 
refuge, and the very chic town of Carmel. And the rugged beauty of 
Big Sur, a wilderness area, lies just south of Carmel on Route 1.
Ridge Vineyards, a California icon
Not many wineries in California have been around since the 1950s, and most of 
those that do date back that far or earlier are in Napa Valley or Sonoma County. 
Ridge Vineyards is an exception. Situated high up in the Santa Cruz Mountains, this 
iconoclastic winery has been going its own way from the beginning. Two wine-
loving Stanford University professors founded the winery in 1959. In 1969, Paul 
Draper, a Stanford graduate who majored in philosophy, joined Ridge and became 
the winemaker. Forty years later, Draper is still at Ridge, now as CEO.
Here’s Ridge’s approach, which was very unusual back in 1959:
 ✓ Focus on two grape varieties, Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel.
 ✓ Produce a Cabernet Sauvignon wine that’s capable of aging a long time, as 
Bordeaux wines are.
 ✓ Search the state for the best possible vineyards for Zinfandel.
Draper already knew in 1969 that he had an ideal location for Cabernet Sauvignon 
at Ridge’s Monte Bello Vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Time has proven him 
right. Ridge Monte Bello continues to shine at international competitions. At a 2006 
repeat of the famous Judgment of Paris tasting (see Chapter 1) between California 
Cabernet Sauvignons and Bordeaux wines, the 1971 Ridge Monte Bello Cabernet 
Sauvignon was voted the best wine overall.
For Zinfandel, Draper found top vineyards in Sonoma, Napa, and Paso Robles. 
Ridge’s two most acclaimed Zinfandels both come from Sonoma: Geyserville 
Vineyard (the wine is actually a Zinfandel blend) and Lytton Springs Vineyard.

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine

Monterey County now has about 85 wineries. But the vineyards of 
the Monterey peninsula serve an even larger population of winer-
ies. As much as 80 percent of the wine grapes grown in Monterey 
County are purchased by non-Monterey wineries.
The weather in Monterey County is extremely variable. The north-
ern part, closer to the town of Monterey and the Bay, is quite cool 
and breezy, with winds blowing in from the Pacific Ocean. As you 
travel south and farther inland, you can experience warm, even 
hot days but cool evenings in the summer. Riesling, Pinot Noir, and 
Chardonnay grow successfully in northern Monterey, especially 
near the coast, and Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and Zinfandel do 
well in warmer southern Monterey.
 
A particularly special part of Monterey wine country is the Santa 
Lucia Highlands. This remote region, sheltered from the Pacific by 
the Santa Lucia Mountains, has vineyards up to 1,400 feet in alti-
tude, where they rise into the sunshine above the morning fog line 
and enjoy cool breezes from Monterey Bay. Most of the wineries 
up there are small and new, but they’re creating considerable fan-
fare among Pinot Noir lovers for their lush, rich style of wines. We 
recommend some Santa Lucia Pinot Noirs in Chapter 7.
 
Monterey’s wineries offer something for everyone:
 
✓ Large wineries: Estancia Estates and Chateau Julien produce 
good value wines. Chateau Julien, in the Carmel region, is 
known for its reasonably priced Merlot.
 
✓ Mid-sized winery: Bernardus Winery in Carmel makes mid-
priced varietal wines from Cabernet, Merlot, and other variet-
ies. Bernardus offers first-rate lodging as well.
 
✓ Smaller, more upscale wineries: These wineries include
 
• Chalone Vineyard, master of Chardonnay and Pinot 
Blanc
 
• Morgan Winery, renowned for its Pinot Noir and 
Chardonnay
 
• Robert Talbott Vineyards, known mainly for its 
Chardonnay and lately for its Pinot Noir (Note: This is 
the same Robert Talbott who designs and produces very 
classy men’s ties.)
 
✓ Great views: Smith & Hook/Hahn Estates Winery and Paraiso 
Vineyards, both in the Santa Lucia Highlands, offer sheer dra-
matic beauty. You can sip Paraiso’s super Pinot Noir in the 
tasting room while taking in its view of the Pacific Coast from 
the edge of a cliff.

 Chapter 4: California’s Major Wine Regions 77
San Luis Obispo: Paso Robles, Edna Valley, 
and Arroyo Grande
The Big Sur wilderness in the southern part of Monterey County 
separates the northern districts of the Central Coast from those 
in the south. The southern part of the Central Coast begins in San 
Luis Obispo County. San Luis Obispo County resembles Monterey 
County in that the climate varies a great deal from north to south 
(see the preceding section on Monterey). In this case, most of the 
northern part — the hilly Paso Robles region north of the town of 
Monterey County AVAs
Like most California wine regions, Monterey County has been changing rapidly 
since the 1980s, and now, in addition to the general Monterey County AVA, nine 
distinct viticultural areas (AVAs) exist here. We list them, approximately from north 
to south, and include the most renowned wines in each AVA:

San Luis Obispo — is quite warm, and the southern parts, Edna 
Valley and Arroyo Grande, both near the coast, are distinctly 
cooler.
The Paso Robles vineyard area is the true center of the Central 
Coast, as it’s about equidistant from San Francisco and Los 
Angeles. The sunny, dry Paso Robles climate makes this region pri-
marily red wine country, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, 
and Zinfandel the leading wines.
Paso Robles is one of California’s fastest-growing wine regions; 
when we wrote Wine For Dummies, 4th Edition, in 2006, we 
reported that the region had more than 90 wineries. Today, Paso 
Robles has nearly 170 wineries — and probably more by the 
time you read this. Some of the leading wineries in Paso Robles 
are Eberle, Justin Vineyards, Meridian Vineyards, Rabbit Ridge 
Vineyards, Tablas Creek, Treana, and Wild Horse Winery.
Paso Robles has two AVAs: the general Paso Robles AVA and York 
Mountain AVA. York Mountain is a small area in the southwest-
ern part of the Paso Robles region that specializes in Cabernet 
Sauvignon. Because York Mountain is only 7 miles from the Pacific 
Ocean and is 1,500 feet in altitude, it’s considerably cooler than the 
main, eastern part of Paso Robles — thus its need for a separate 
AVA. That said, the western part of the Paso Robles AVA is itself a 
fairly cool area.
The cool Edna Valley, south of Paso Robles, and the Arroyo Grande 
region, farther south, feature Pinot Noir and Chardonnay as their 
signature wines. But some wineries also grow Rhône varieties, 
such as Viognier, Syrah, Grenache, and Roussanne; others have 
Riesling, Pinot Grigio/Gris, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Zinfandel. 
Paragon Vineyard, one of California’s best Pinot Noir vineyards, is 
in Edna Valley.
Fewer than 20 wineries are located in Edna Valley and Arroyo 
Grande, most of them in Edna Valley. The leading wineries are 
Alban Vineyards (Viognier specialists), Claiborne & Churchill 
(sounds like a law firm, but they make good Riesling), Corbett 
Canyon, Edna Valley Vineyard (Pinot Noir/Chardonnay special-
ists), Laetitia (sparkling wine and Pinot Noir), Saucelito Canyon 
(Zinfandel), and Talley Vineyards (Chardonnay and Pinot Noir).
Santa Barbara County: Santa Maria, Santa Ynez, 
and Los Alamos Valleys and Sta. Rita Hills
Although Spanish missionaries planted vineyards in what is 
now Santa Barbara County more than 200 years ago, Firestone 
Vineyard, the County’s first major winery, didn’t open until 1975. 

 Chapter 4: California’s Major Wine Regions 79
Today, more than 110 wineries are operating throughout Santa 
Barbara. The fact that Santa Barbara County was the setting of the 
film Sideways certainly didn’t hurt. Pinot Noir is Santa Barbara’s 
poster child, for sure. But Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, 
and Syrah thrive in Santa Barbara as well.
Santa Barbara has three official AVAs (Santa Maria Valley, Santa 
Ynez Valley, and Sta. Rita Hills) and one unofficial one (Los Alamos 
Valley) that’s still pending official recognition. All four wine regions 
are north of the city of Santa Barbara, and all four share a cool, 
unique climate, thanks to the positions of the Valleys.
 
Three Valleys (Santa Maria, Santa Ynez, and Los Alamos) run east 
to west — whereas most of California’s coastal valleys run north 
to south — and are open to the cool breezes of the Pacific Ocean 
that channel through the Valleys. And so the southern latitude of 
Santa Barbara matters little; the position of the Valleys is what 
determines the climate, making all the Santa Barbara wine regions 
quite cool (the average temperature in Santa Maria Valley during 
the growing season is 74°F), ideal for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.
Here’s a rundown of the three Santa Barbara Valleys:
 
✓ Santa Maria: Santa Maria Valley, the northernmost AVA, is 
particularly renowned for Pinot Noir; in fact, its Pinot Noir 
grapes are sought out by many wineries outside of Santa 
Barbara. Of the Santa Barbara AVAs, the foggy, windswept 
Santa Maria Valley area is the most influenced by the Pacific 
Ocean; not only Pinot Noir but also Chardonnay is a true 
standout here.
 
✓ Santa Ynez: Santa Ynez Valley, in the southern part of the 
County and closest to the city of Santa Barbara, has the larg-
est concentration of wineries. The western part, nearer the 
Pacific Ocean, grows Pinot Noir; the warmer, eastern end of 
the Valley features Syrah and other Rhône varieties.
 
 Sta. Rita Hills AVA, at the western end of Santa Ynez Valley, 
has a climate quite similar to that of Santa Maria Valley; 
Chardonnay and Pinot Noir do well here.
 
✓ Los Alamos: Los Alamos Valley, which lies between the Santa 
Maria Valley to the north and the Santa Ynez Valley to the 
south, uses the general Santa Barbara County AVA for its 
wines at present. Not as cool as Santa Maria Valley but cooler 
than Santa Ynez, its most important wines are Chardonnay 
and Pinot Noir.

Santa Barbara wine is typically enjoyable when it’s young, within 
its first five years. The region’s Pinot Noir has its own distinctive 
characteristics: Primarily, it exhibits intense strawberry fruit, with 
herbal notes.
Santa Barbara has many great wineries. A partial list includes Au 
Bon Climat, Babcock, Byron, Cambria, Cottonwood Canyon, Daniel 
Gehrs, Fess Parker, Fiddlehead Cellars, Foxen, Gainey, Hitching 
Post, Lane Tanner, Qupé, Sanford, Santa Barbara, and Zaca Mesa.
Southern California
Although Southern California saw the very beginnings of California 
wines, not much wine exists there today. One reason is apparent: 
Too many people and too many houses occupy the land. Another 
reason is that vintners found regions more suitable for fine wine 
farther north, in central California, especially near the coast. But 
some wineries do still exist in Southern California.
One winery worth noting is actually in the Los Angeles area: 
Moraga Vineyards. It’s located in Moraga Canyon, about 600 to 
800 feet in altitude in the Bel Air hills. Tom and Ruth Jones, the 
Calera Wine Company: 
Standing alone in San Benito
San Benito County is directly east of Monterey County. San Benito has only one 
winery of any consequence, but it’s quite a winery!
Josh Jensen became hooked on Burgundy wine after a trip to France in 1971. He 
spent two years going up and down California looking for the same limestone soil 
that he believed was a key element in the wondrous red and white Burgundies that 
he loved. Finally, he found it on a mountain 2,200 feet high in the Gavilan Mountain 
range, near Mount Harlan.
Jensen bought the land in 1974 and founded Calera Wine Company in 1975, planting 
three different vineyards of Pinot Noir. They’re among the highest and coldest vine-
yards in California. Calera even has its own AVA: Mt. Harlan. Jensen later planted 
Viognier and Chardonnay, but the Pinot Noir is what established Calera’s reputation 
as one of the elite wineries in California. Jensen took his own path more than 35 
years ago and walked into California’s wine legend. We recommend Calera’s wines 
in Chapter 5 (Chardonnay), Chapter 7 (Pinot Noir), and Chapter 9 (Viognier).

 Chapter 4: California’s Major Wine Regions 81
proprietors, discovered that the area’s soil resembled that of part 
of France’s Bordeaux region: It has gravelly beds, limestone, and 
fossils — a result of being submerged under the ocean millions of 
years ago. Tom Jones planted Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and 
Sauvignon Blanc. He makes about 1,000 bottles a year of Moraga 
Red (80 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, 20 percent Merlot) and a 
little bit of Moraga White (all Sauvignon Blanc). The red sells for 
$125, the white, for $65.
The Temecula Valley, about an hour’s drive north of San Diego, 
near the city of Oceanside, is blessed with cool breezes that funnel 
in from the Pacific Ocean and create an environment suitable for 
fine wine grapes. At present, the Temecula Valley has 24 wineries. 
No one grape variety seems to predominate; Merlot and Syrah are 
the popular reds, whereas Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc are 
the dominant whites. Many dessert wines come from this area as 
well, generally from Muscat and late-harvested Zinfandel grapes. 
The two best-known wineries, both founded in 1969, are Callaway 
Coastal Winery and Mount Palomar Winery. Both wineries pur-
chase a large part of the grapes for their wine production from 
Central Coast vineyards, however, partially due to an infestation of 
the root louse phylloxera that devasted the area in the late 1990s.
Inward and upward
California’s coastal regions get the lion’s share of critical acclaim, 
but the state’s wine economy owes a debt to the vast, interior 
vineyard areas. California’s largest source of wine production is 
the huge Central Valley, located smack in the middle of the state. 
Another interior region, the Sierra Foothills, banks more on charm 
than on volume of production.
Central Valley
Over 50 percent of all California wine is made in the Central 
Valley — which is the general name for San Joaquin Valley, 
Sacramento Valley, and surrounding areas. This huge Valley in the 
center of the state extends from the city of Bakersfield at its 
southern end (near coastal Santa Barbara) all the way up and 
beyond Yuba City at its northern end (at a similar latitude to coastal 
Mendocino). It encompasses the state capital of Sacramento, the 
cities of Stockton and Fresno, and the wine towns of Lodi, 
Woodbridge, Modesto, Madera, and Clarksburg, among others.

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
82
The largest wine businesses in California have their principal 
wineries or at least part of their operations in the Central Valley. 
These include E. & J. Gallo Winery, Constellation Wines, Robert 
Mondavi-Woodbridge (owned by Constellation), Bronco Wine 
Company, R.H. Phillips, Cribari, Paul Masson, Mariposa (part of 
Kendall-Jackson, headquartered in Sonoma), Delicato, Almaden, 
and Franzia. Three prominent smaller wineries are Bogle 
Vineyards, Quady, and Ficklin (the latter two are dessert wine 
specialists).
Climate in the Central Valley is generally warm and dry in the 
summer and temperate in the winter. Most of the state’s grape 
varieties grow here. Three varieties that thrive in this climate are 
Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, and Chenin Blanc. The Central Valley spe-
cializes in producing inexpensive, large-production wines, helping 
make it the foundation of the California wine business.
Sierra Foothills
If you want to experience a wine region that has a romantic his-
tory and has changed little over time, take a trip into the past and 
visit the charming wineries in the Sierra Foothills. We love to visit 
Central Valley AVAs
Unlike other California wine regions, the huge Central Valley has no regional AVA 
that encompasses the entire Valley. It does have 17 specific AVAs spread through-
out the Valley, which we list alphabetically:
 ✓ Alta Mesa
 ✓ Borden Ranch
 ✓ Capay Valley
 ✓ Clarksburg
 ✓ Clements Hills
 ✓ Cosumnes River
 ✓ Diablo Grande
 ✓ Dunnigan Hills
 ✓ Jahant
 ✓ Lodi
 ✓ Madera
 ✓ Merritt Island
 ✓ Mokelumne River
 ✓ River Junction

the region. It has a rustic charm that you can’t find anywhere else 
in California. Life is still simple there, so don’t expect to find any 
fancy restaurants. But the people are real and friendly, and the 
wines are good — and reasonably priced!
 
One of the most memorable events in California’s history was the 
Gold Rush of 1849. With the discovery of gold in Sutter Creek, in 
the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, this previously iso-
lated area was forever changed. Besides prospectors and miners, 
others arrived there, and some of them decided to plant vineyards. 
By 1870, the Sierra Foothills boasted 100-plus wineries, more than 
Napa and Sonoma combined at the time! One of the vines planted 
there, Zinfandel, eventually gave the region its most renowned 
wine. Most of the oldest grapevines in the United States — some 
even over 100 years old — are in the Sierra Foothills.
The Sierra Foothills is a rather large region east and southeast of 
Sacramento (which is a good entry point). Most of the wineries 
are in Amador, El Dorado, or Calaveras Counties or a little north 
or south of them. The Shenandoah Valley and Fiddletown are the 
two major viticultural areas, and many of the wineries are located 
in one of these two areas. Some major wine towns (where you can 
find accommodations) are Plymouth, Placerville, Sutter Creek, and 
Amador City.
In addition to the general Sierra Foothills AVA, five specific AVAs 
exist:
 
✓ California Shenandoah Valley (Note: There’s also a Virginia 
Shenandoah Valley AVA)
 
✓ El Dorado
 
✓ Fiddletown
 
✓ Fair Play
 
✓ North Yuba
 
Most of the vineyards in the Sierra Foothills are about 1,500 to 
2,000 feet in altitude, some even higher. Much of the soil is decom-
posed granite or crushed volcanic rock, both very good for grow-
ing wine grapes.
Besides red Zinfandel, which dominates the region, other lead-
ing grape varieties in the Sierra Foothills include Syrah, Cabernet 
Sauvignon, Barbera, Petite Sirah, and Sauvignon Blanc.

Part I: The Big Picture of California Wine  
84
After being practically wiped out by Prohibition in the 1930s, 
more than 100 wineries are in business today. Some of the leading 
wineries are Monteviña (now known as Terra d’Oro), Renwood, 
Shenandoah Vineyards, Amador Foothill, Boeger, Sierra Vista, 
Karly, Renaissance Vineyard, and Sobon Estate. Just about every 
winery here specializes in Zinfandel (and many produce true Old 
Vines Zinfandels), but many wineries also make Syrah and Barbera.

oes reading about wine make you thirsty for a nice, 
cool glass of Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc? 
Cabernet or Merlot might be your pleasure instead — or 
California’s suddenly fashionable Pinot Noir, or maybe its 
ever-classic red Zinfandel. These are the varietal wines 
that California is best-known for, the major types of wine 
from California that you can fi nd in just about every wine 
shop and on every restaurant wine list, all across the U.S. 
And these are the wines that we profi le in this part of the 
book. For each type of wine, we discuss where the grapes 
grow, how the wines differ from region to region, what the 
wines taste like, what they cost, and which brands to 
trust. That’s enough to make us thirsty, for sure!

O
ver the years, we’ve loved California Chardonnays — except 
for the times when we’ve been disappointed in them. 
Chardonnay has been a staple of California wine production since 
the very first days when producers began naming wines after their 
dominant grape variety, and the style of California’s Chardonnays 
has varied quite a lot over those 40 or so years. But stylistic 
changes haven’t dampened California Chardonnay’s popularity. 
It’s the single best-selling type of wine that California has — red or 
white (or pink).
Sauvignon Blanc is Chardonnay’s perpetual sidekick in California. 
Its production is much smaller than Chardonnay’s, and its 
appeal is much less universal among wine drinkers. Nonetheless, 
Sauvignon Blanc is California’s number two white varietal wine and 
for many good reasons.
In this chapter, we describe the taste of these two wines, discuss 
the regions where Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc grow best in 
California, and recommend some of our favorite examples of these 
varietal wines.

Chardonnay: The Wine That 
California Made Famous
If you were born less than 50 years ago, what we’re about to tell 
you might seem preposterous: Back in the 1960s, wines named 
Chardonnay for all practical purposes did not exist! California had a 
few of them, but practically nobody knew the wines. Chardonnay’s 
trajectory from unknown entity to the biggest-selling wine in the 
United States is truly spectacular. In this section, we explain some 
of the history and talk about the taste of Chardonnay.
 
The Chardonnay grape traces its origins back to the Burgundy 
region in eastern France, where it was cultivated as early as the 
1100s. It’s the primary — and practically the only — variety used 
in making Chablis and the other iconic white wines of Burgundy. 
Also, Chardonnay is one of the major varieties in Champagne and 
in other sparkling wines. Today, Chardonnay is the second most 
planted grape variety in the world; only Airén — a minor Spanish 
variety used for making brandy and inexpensive white wines — 
occupies more acreage than Chardonnay. Chardonnay is planted in 
more wine regions of the world than any other variety, even more 
than the ubiquitous Cabernet Sauvignon!
A brief history of California 
Chardonnay
The honor of producing California’s first varietal Chardonnay 
went to Wente Vineyards, which made Chardonnay in 1936. Carl 
Wente, a German immigrant working for the Charles Krug Winery 
in Napa Valley, founded his own winery in Livermore Valley in 
1883 (see Chapter 1 for details). In 1912, a Wente descendant 
visited the University of Montpellier’s Agriculture Department in 
France and returned with Chardonnay vine cuttings. Grape grow-
ers planted these cuttings throughout California in the 1940s, after 
Prohibition, and vines descended from these cuttings are now 
known as the Wente clone of Chardonnay (a clone is a subdivision 
of a grape variety).
Besides the Wente family, three Californians stand out as true pio-
neers for producing Chardonnay as a varietal wine:
 
✓ Martin Ray: A man who always went his own way, Martin Ray 
was a protégé of the legendary Paul Masson (see Chapter 1). 
In the early 1940s, Ray planted three noble grape varieties — 
Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Pinot Noir — on the 

 Chapter 5: Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc 89
steep hillsides of the Santa Cruz Mountains in an area called 
Mount Eden. Ray used French methods of vinification to 
make his wines, including fermenting and aging the wines in 
French oak.
 
 He sold his wines under the Martin Ray label, and the few 
wine critics that existed then praised Ray’s wines as master-
pieces. Although all three wines were special, the Chardonnay 
proved to be the finest and longest-lived. Ray charged the 
unheard-of price of $50 for his 1970 Chardonnay, at a time 
when almost all California wines cost well under $10. Not 
a good businessman, Ray lost his winery; it was renamed 
Mount Eden Vineyards — and is still renowned for its Estate 
Chardonnay today.
 
✓ Fred McCrea: San Francisco advertising executive Fred 
McCrea and his wife Eleanor bought a property on the west 
slope of Napa Valley, north of St. Helena, in 1943. They 
planted Chardonnay and four other varieties in 1947, har-
vested their first grapes in 1952, named the property Stony 
Hill Vineyard, and sold their first Chardonnay in 1954. Stony 
Hill Vineyard was one of the first Chardonnay specialists — 
about 60 percent of the few thousand cases a year that the 
winery produces is Chardonnay.
 
 Stony Hill’s Chardonnay is different from most other 
California Chardonnays: The winery uses minimal oak (only 
old barrels, which impart no oak flavor), and the wines are 
lean, racy, intense, and minerally. Only two winemakers have 
ever made Stony Hill wines: Fred McCrea from 1952 to 1973 
and Mike Chelini for the past 35 years. Now that’s continuity! 
The McCreas’ son and daughter-in-law run Stony Hill today.
 
✓ James Zellerbach: Once the U.S. Ambassador to Rome, 
Zellerbach became enamored of Burgundy wines in his trav-
els to France. In 1948, Zellerbach purchased 200 acres in 
the Mayacamas Mountains, north of the town of Sonoma; he 
planted Chardonnay and Pinot Noir in 1953, named his winery 
Hanzell, and sold the first vintage of the two wines in 1957. 
Today, three-quarters of Hanzell’s production is Chardonnay. 
Hanzell Chardonnay remains one of the great white wines 
made in California to this day.
But as we mention in Chapter 1, Robert Mondavi is the one who 
truly brought fame to the wine named Chardonnay. He opened 
Robert Mondavi Winery in 1966 and started producing premium 
varietal wines, such as Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon (and 
later, Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot, and Pinot Noir). The wines were 
good, received fine reviews, and sold well. And then most other wine 
producers in California jumped on the varietal wine bandwagon.

Part II: The Headliners  
90
California Chardonnay reached its peak of popularity in the late 
1980s and the 1990s. The wine went through various stylistic evo-
lutions, from very rich and exotic wines to leaner, cleaner (and 
some said anemic) “food wines” to the style of today, which is 
somewhere in between.
The taste of California Chardonnay
The Chardonnay grape variety brings little aroma or flavor to its 
wines. In cooler regions, its wines often have hints of apple aromas 
and flavors; in warmer regions, they suggest tropical fruits, par-
ticularly pineapple. In some regions (such as Chablis, France), 
the wines have a distinctive mineral character, such as flintiness. 
These characteristics hold true in California’s cooler and warmer 
wine regions. But because California has more warm wine regions 
than cool ones, California Chardonnays tend to gravitate toward 
tropical fruit flavors, as well as ripe lemon.
Because of the wine’s fairly limited aromas and flavors — and 
because Chardonnay juice is particularly compatible with oak — 
winemakers in California and elsewhere ferment and/or age 
most of their better Chardonnays in oak barrels. Lower-priced 
Chardonnays typically obtain oaky aromas and flavors from oak 
planks, oak chips, or oak powder that soaks in the wine while the 
wine is in stainless steel vats (because oak barrels are expensive!).
California Chardonnays made using any form of oak can smell 
and taste toasty, spicy, and/or smoky, with aromas and flavors of 
vanilla or butterscotch. All these aromas and flavors come from 
oak, not from the grape. Oaked Chardonnays can also have some 
tannin that comes from the oak. If the wine is actually fermented 
in oak barrels, which is common practice for pricier Chardonnays, 
it can have a special richness of texture as a result. But many 
California Chardonnays today, even cheap brands, have a thick, 
viscous texture not from oak but as the result of very high alcohol 
content; this characteristic is positive, unless (like one of us) you 
have a low threshold for alcohol and therefore taste a hard, burn-
ing character along with the rich texture.
Some critics, including us, have taken issue with the way California 
Chardonnay is made. We can sum up their complaints in two 
words: too much. Too many Chardonnays have been too high in 
alcohol, too sweet, and too oaky. A few California producers make 
Chardonnays without using any oak, or even more commonly, with 
few or no new oak barrels. (Used barrels, depending on their age, 
give little or no oaky flavor to the wine.) The trend in California 
seems to be moving slowly away from heavily oaked Chardonnays 

 Chapter 5: Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc 91
toward more lightly oaked styles, and we, for two, say, “Hallelujah!” 
We would still like the wines to be less sweet and more restrained 
in their alcohol levels, however.
For richer or for value
Some wine drinkers believe that California Chardonnays are 
too expensive. In fact, some of the most celebrated brands cost 
upwards of $100 a bottle. But California Chardonnays exist at all 
price levels: You can even find California Chardonnay for $3 a 
bottle.
However, the taste of the wine does vary according to price:
 
✓ In our experience, the least expensive wines are quite sweet. 
You can sense their sweetness — a combination of residual 
sugar in the wines, in some cases, and the sweetness of high 
alcohol levels — as soon as you put the wine in your mouth. 
In a way, this sweetness is good because it counterbalances 
the edgy, sharp burn that overly high alcohol brings to a wine.
 
✓ Mid-priced wines, especially those that cost about $15 to $20 
a bottle, seem a bit less overtly sweet.
 
✓ The highest priced wines vary a lot from brand to brand. In 
the best wines, you can sense a real concentration of flavor, 
and those flavors remain along the whole length of your 
tongue instead of stopping short midway.
We recommend some Chardonnays at each price level in the later 
section titled “Some Top Chardonnay Producers.”
Where Chardonnay Grows 
in California
Chardonnay is somewhat of a workhorse variety: It can grow pro-
ductively in all kinds of climates. But as California wine producers 
discovered in the last decades of the 20th century, Chardonnay 
does best in cool, coastal regions — such as Carneros, Russian 
River Valley, and the Sonoma Coast — where the soil is usually 
quite poor and the vines don’t grow prolifically. Figure 5-1 shows 
Russian River Valley, a key Chardonnay region.
Chardonnays produced in the cool, coastal places can be quite 
expensive, but if you want to pay $15 or less, rest assured that 
lots of Chardonnay is made in this price range. The majority 

Part II: The Headliners  
92
of inexpensive Chardonnays come from California’s warmer 
regions, such as the Central Valley, where the soil is more fertile 
and grape-growing is more bounteous. Instead of having specific 
regional names on their labels, most of these wines simply carry 
the wider geographic designation of California.
Figure 5-1: Russian River Valley.
Cool, coastal classic regions
Most of California’s best Chardonnays come from its coolest 
growing areas, which are near its coastline and/or located at high 
altitudes. Many of these regions are in the coastal and northern 
parts of Sonoma County, such as Russian River Valley and its even 
cooler subregion, Green Valley. The newest area that’s gaining 
acclaim for Chardonnay is the Sonoma Coast, which is really push-
ing the envelope with its marginal growing conditions: It’s a very 
cool area with poor soil, and both of these factors challenge the 
grapevines to perform.

 Chapter 5: Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc 93
Carneros, a region that’s partly in Napa and partly in Sonoma, is 
another classic Chardonnay region. Although Carneros is in the 
southern part of both counties, the cool ocean breezes coming 
through San Pablo Bay in the south create ideal growing condi-
tions for Chardonnay.
Santa Barbara County, although quite southerly, has valleys open 
to Pacific Ocean breezes and is generally an excellent region for 
Chardonnay. In particular, Santa Maria Valley, in the northwest 
part of Santa Barbara County, is one of Santa Barbara’s coolest dis-
tricts because of its ocean breezes, and it’s a fine area for growing 
Chardonnay.
Napa versus Sonoma: 
Which area is right for you?
Determining whether to spend your wine country vacation in Napa Valley, Sonoma 
Valley, or Northern Sonoma — or some combination of two or three — depends on 
what kind of vacation you’re looking for and how much time you have to spend. If 
you have only a long weekend, it’s better to choose one destination and make the 
most of it rather than spend a good portion of your vacation driving and checking 
in and out of hotels or B&Bs.
Sonoma Valley and Northern Sonoma maintain backcountry ambience. Though 
Sonoma County is home to more than 250 wineries, it seems far less commercial 
than Napa, primarily because the attractions are scattered over a far greater area, 
so there’s a lower density of wineries, restaurants, hotels, and manmade structures 
in general (vineyards aside). However, though both the Valley and the environs to 
the north are technically in Sonoma, they offer dramatically different experiences.
A current favorite destination is Northern Sonoma’s Healdsburg area. In the last 
few years, this area has seen the addition of truly exceptional dining and accom-
modations. Consider its offerings: You can cruise vast vine-trellised countryside 
and wind down tiny dirt roads to discover small gem wineries often manned by the 
winemakers; feast on excellent cuisine in chic new restaurants and longstanding 
casual local haunts; shop or people-watch at Healdsburg’s historic square; and 
even float down a lazy river on an inner tube if you want. It has the best of both 
Napa and Sonoma Valleys. It certainly feels the least commercial.
If you have the luxury of time, don’t visit just one destination: Tour two so you can 
compare and contrast these very different — and very wonderful — worlds of 
winemaking.

Other cool regions that are perfect for Chardonnay include coastal 
Monterey County and the Chalone region in Monterey’s Gavilan 
Mountains. Monterey County makes lots of Chardonnay, and most 
of it is fairly inexpensive. Mendocino County’s Anderson Valley, 
along California’s North Coast, is another cool location suited to 
making top-flight Chardonnays.
Warm regions for everyday 
Chardonnays
California’s gigantic Central Valley produces most of the state’s 
inexpensive Chardonnays. You find some of these wines carrying 
appellations of origin such as Lodi, Woodbridge, Modesto, and 
Madera — but most of them simply carry the California designa-
tion. Growing conditions such as warm, sunny days, fertile soil, 
and irrigation enable grape growers here to produce huge crops 
of Chardonnay that find their way into many of the mass-market, 
value-priced brands.
Top Chardonnay Producers
California is the largest producer of varietal Chardonnay wines 
in the world. We estimate that at least 2,000 different brands of 
California Chardonnay exist. Our intention in this section is to 
name just a few of these brands to guide you toward what we 
consider to be some of the best Chardonnays available at various 
price levels.
Most, but not all, of the top-rank California Chardonnay produc-
ers harvest their Chardonnay grapes from vineyards located in 
cool-climate areas, as you can see from the vineyard locations that 
appear in parentheses in our lists.
We place our top Chardonnay producers’ wines into three price cat-
egories, based on the average retail price of the wine across the U.S.:
 
✓ Moderately priced Chardonnays: About $12 to $20
 
✓ Moderate-plus Chardonnays: Between $20 and $50
 
✓ High-end Chardonnays: Mainly between $50 and $100, with a 
few over $100
But if your budget doesn’t stretch that far, you can still find decent 
Chardonnays. Check out our sidebar titled “Six top-value California 
Chardonnays” for a few recommended Chardonnays that sell for 
$12 or less.

On the high end of the spectrum, we recommend about 20 
Chardonnays. Our list includes a few Chardonnays from Kistler, 
Marcassin, and Aubert (all small production wines) that cost over 
$100. And yet the rest of the wines, which fall into the $50 to $100 
range, include some of the very best Chardonnays in the world — 
producers such as Mount Eden Estate, Hanzell, and Peter Michael. 
We believe that these excellent Chardonnays do offer top value

Sauvignon Blanc: Always a 
Bridesmaid, Never a Bride
Sauvignon Blanc is California’s second most popular white wine, 
but it’s far behind Chardonnay in production and sales. In fact, 
Italian Pinot Grigio outsells California Sauvignon Blanc in the 
United States. Although some California winemakers have been 
passionate about Sauvignon Blanc, quite a few wineries, particu-
larly in Napa Valley, gave up on Sauvignon Blanc — either because 
their winemakers weren’t satisfied with their version of the wine or 
because the wine didn’t sell well enough.
Chardonnay stars: The Establishment 
and the new guys
Two wineries that first began making Chardonnay in the 1950s, Stony Hill Vineyards 
in Napa Valley and Hanzell Vineyards in Sonoma Valley, remain two of California 
Chardonnay’s brightest stars today.
The 1970s and 1980s were golden years for California as many great new winer-
ies opened. In 1972, Napa Valley’s renowned Chateau Montelena was born; this 
property still makes world-class Chardonnays and Cabernet Sauvignons. Other 
California wineries born in the 1970s and acclaimed for their Chardonnays include 
Grgich Hills, Forman Vineyard, Long Vineyards, and Far Niente, all in Napa Valley. 
(Actually, Far Niente was founded in 1885 but was reborn in 1979 when it made its 
first Chardonnay.) A great 1970s-era Sonoma winery is Kistler Vineyards, which 
makes single-vineyard Sonoma Chardonnays; Kistler is one of the true superstars 
of California Chardonnay, and consequently, its wines are almost impossible to find 
except in a few high-end restaurants — or if you’re lucky enough to be on Kistler’s 
mailing list.
The 1980s ushered in a few noteworthy California Chardonnay producers, including 
Au Bon Climat in Santa Barbara, Patz & Hall in Napa (but most of its Chardonnays 
come from Sonoma), and Peter Michael and Marcassin in Sonoma. Marcassin, like 
Kistler, produces small amounts of expensive Chardonnays that are prized by wine 
collectors. Williams Selyem in Russian River Valley, renowned for its prized Pinot 
Noirs, also just happens to make darn good Chardonnays as well.
Newer wineries that are making excellent Chardonnays include Ramey Wine 
Cellars and Lynmar Winery, both of whom make quite affordable Chardonnays from 
Russian River Valley vineyards. Really hot new Chardonnays include Aubert from 
the Sonoma Coast and Brewer-Clifton from the Sta. Rita Hills in Santa Barbara.

One of the main reasons for Sauvignon Blanc’s failure to com-
pete with Chardonnay is that in the early days of its history in 
California, Sauvignon Blanc didn’t have a distinct identity. During 
the 1970s and part of the 1980s, producers often planted Sauvignon 
Blanc grapes in areas similar to where they planted Chardonnay 
and gave Sauvignon Blanc wine the same oak treatment as 
Chardonnay. And guess what? It tasted like Chardonnay.
But within the last decade, things have been changing in California 
for Sauvignon Blanc. Producers have been identifying the best 
regions to plant the grape, and many winemakers are now using 
little or no oak in the fermentation and aging process. As a result, 
California Sauvignon Blanc is slowly gaining a distinct identity and, 
in some cases, new respect among wine drinkers.
Many wine critics believe, however, that Sauvignon Blanc still 
hasn’t hit its stride in California. Common complaints are that the 
high alcohol of many Sauvignon Blanc wines (sometimes combined 
Sémillon as a secret style-maker
Sémillon (seh-mee-yohn) gets our vote as the least-known important white wine 
grape variety in the world. It plays a crucial role in the makeup of many wines — but 
usually in a supporting role, seldom as the lead. One region in which Sémillon is 
a star is in the Graves (grahv) district of Bordeaux, where it’s an important com-
ponent of dry white Bordeaux wines, together with Sauvignon Blanc. In the same 
district, Sémillon is the major variety of Sauternes, which is arguably the world’s 
finest dessert wine.
Although a few varietal Sémillon wines do exist, Sémillon invariably finds itself 
blended with Sauvignon Blanc, for many good reasons. Whereas Sauvignon Blanc 
makes wines that are very aromatic and herbaceous with high acidity and light to 
medium body, Sémillon wines have subtler aromas, lower acidity, and fuller body. 
Sémillon has a thick, almost oily texture, with aromas of figs and sometimes lanolin; 
its texture complements the leaner structure of Sauvignon Blanc.
Another major reason this blend works so well is how the two wines age: Sauvignon 
Blanc makes its presence felt early in the life of a Sauvignon Blanc–Sémillon 
blended wine, but the characteristics of the longer-lived Sémillon take a while to 
emerge and continue developing with time.
For the many California winemakers who add Sémillon to their Sauvignon Blanc 
wines, Sémillon plays the crucial role of toning down the sometimes too-aggressive 
aromas and flavors of Sauvignon Blanc and also adding years to the life of the wine.

 Chapter 5: Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc 99
with residual sugar in the wines) creates a sweetness that’s dis-
cordant with the raw, bitter flavors that high alcohol can extract 
from the grapes. We’ve tasted many Sauvignon Blancs like that 
ourselves, and we hope that when California producers get over 
their high-alcohol fixation, the wines will become more balanced 
and appealing.
Some history on Sauvignon Blanc
Sauvignon Blanc, as far as anyone can determine, originated 
in Bordeaux, France, in the 1600s. It’s a major variety in most 
Bordeaux Blanc wines and also in many wines from France’s Loire 
Valley, such as Sancerre and Pouilly Fumé.
Although Sauvignon Blanc came to California from France in the 
late 1870s (and was first planted in the Livermore Valley, east 
of San Francisco), Robert Mondavi in Napa Valley was the first 
California wine producer to truly popularize Sauvignon Blanc.
 
In the 1960s, sales were slow for all California Sauvignon Blancs. In 
1968, when Robert Mondavi made his first Sauvignon Blanc wine, 
he named it Fumé Blanc (as a tribute to the Loire Valley’s Pouilly 
Fumé, perhaps; maybe French names are sexier). Lo and behold, 
it was a big hit. A few producers followed Mondavi’s lead and also 
called their wines Fumé Blanc. Today, the two names, Sauvignon 
Blanc and Fumé Blanc, coexist in California, but most producers 
call the wine Sauvignon Blanc. However, a few of California’s top 
Sauvignon Blanc brands, such as Dry Creek Vineyard and Grgich 
Hills (pronounced ger-gich), prefer the name Fumé Blanc.
One of us believes that Sauvignon Blanc will become one of the 
next hot white wines in the United States, along with Riesling. 
Sauvignon Blanc is already New Zealand’s most popular white, is 
well-established in France, Northeast Italy, and South Africa, and is 
becoming a chic white wine in Chile.
The other one of us believes that California producers need to 
decide which style of Sauvignon Blanc to make and work harder at 
perfecting that style. In an effort to emulate New Zealand’s wines 
from this variety, producers are picking their grapes later and later 
to avoid the so-called green (raw herbal and vegetal) flavors that 
come from underripeness; but in the process, they’re harvesting 
grapes with so much sugar that the wines’ alcohol levels are ridicu-
lously high for what should be a zesty, refreshing wine.

Part II: The Headliners  
100
Three styles of California 
Sauvignon Blanc
The Sauvignon Blanc grape variety has always made wines of dif-
ferent styles in different wine regions. Depending on how ripe the 
grape gets, it can express herbal and vegetal aromas and flavors 
(when it’s less ripe) or fruity aromas and flavors (when the grapes 
are riper). In some regions, particularly the Loire Valley in France, 
the wines can have a distinct mineral flavor.
The grape typically brings high acidity to its wines, which results 
in a freshness and vibrancy in the wine unless a winemaker masks 
these characteristics with oak or by blending with another variety, 
typically Sémillon (see our nearby sidebar titled “Sémillon as a 
secret style-maker”).
 
One of Sauvignon Blanc’s identity problems in California is that the 
wines don’t exhibit any one style. Often, you don’t know what to 
expect when you buy a bottle. In this sense, Sauvignon Blanc is the 
antithesis of Chardonnay: Each brand is as different from the next 
as each brand of Chardonnay is similar to the next.
Today, California Sauvignon Blanc seems to fall into three main 
styles:
 
✓ Grassy, herbaceous: Sauvignon Blanc wines in this style have 
aromas and flavors that suggest freshly mown grass, fresh 
herbs, and/or green vegetables such as asparagus and bell 
peppers; these aromas can be more or less intense, depend-
ing on the wine. These wines are generally crisp and vibrant, 
with high acidity, but lately some of them are soft rather than 
crisp in texture. Sauvignon Blancs made in the grassy, herba-
ceous style usually ferment and age in stainless steel tanks, 
with little or no use of oak, which would diminish the vivid 
flavors of the grape.
 
✓ Fruity: Sauvignon Blancs in this style emphasize fruity aromas 
and flavors — melon, fig, citrus, passion fruit, and/or pear. 
These wines, generally crisp and lively but sometimes soft, 
are fermented and aged mainly or totally in stainless steel 
tanks, with little or no use of oak — just like wines in the her-
baceous style. To tone down Sauvignon Blanc’s grassy, herbal 
tendencies, winemakers either blend in other varieties, par-
ticularly Sémillon, or ensure that their grapes are ripe enough 
to prevent any underripe herbaceous or vegetal notes.

 Chapter 5: Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc 101
 
✓ Oak-influenced: This style, formerly the predominant type 
of Sauvignon Blanc in California, is closest to the style in 
which Chardonnays are made — although these days, most 
wines in this style have much less overt oakiness than most 
Chardonnays do. Typically, winemakers barrel-ferment and 
barrel-age these Sauvignon Blancs, which results in a more 
richly textured, somewhat fuller-bodied wine with toned-
down aromas and flavors from the grape and gentle vanilla 
notes from the oak. Oak-influenced Sauvignon Blancs usu-
ally have Sémillon in the blend. The closest model for the 
oak-influenced style is white Bordeaux from the Graves and 
Pessac-Léognan districts in France.
Today in California, the grassy, herbaceous style and the fruity 
style have overtaken the oak-influenced style in popularity. But 
you can still find all three styles of Sauvignon Blanc. What is hard 
to find, however, is a truly dry Sauvignon Blanc. Whether from high 
alcohol or from actual residual sugar in the wines, almost every 
Sauvignon Blanc tastes a bit sweet.
 
Sauvignon Blanc complements many foods, such as fish, shellfish, 
many chicken entrees, and Asian cuisine. And most California 
Sauvignon Blancs are ready to drink when you buy them; they 
don’t need extra aging. We do recommend, however, that you 
drink these wines well-chilled, because a low temperature 
enhances their vibrancy and diminishes the perception of any 
sweetness in the wine.
Taste trumps price
One of the great aspects of California Sauvignon Blanc is that 
most cost less than $20. Some retail in the $20 to $30 range, and 
just a handful sell for more than $30. Sauvignon Blanc wines from 
California are much more affordable than California Chardonnays 
for two reasons:
 
✓ Chardonnay is still in much more demand, and therefore the 
grapes themselves, as well as the wines, cost more.
 
✓ Most Sauvignon Blanc producers use little or no expensive 
new French oak barrels for fermenting and aging their wines.
We personally tend to buy the Sauvignon Blanc wines that we 
enjoy, without regard to price, because price isn’t a huge differen-
tiating factor.

Part II: The Headliners  
102
Regions for Sauvignon Blanc
Nowadays, many of the best Sauvignon Blancs come from 
California’s cooler American Viticultural Areas (AVAs), especially 
sites in Sonoma and Santa Barbara but also in Napa Valley’s cooler 
regions, such as Carneros and mountainous regions within Napa 
County.
 
Napa Valley made sense as a region for producing Sauvignon Blanc 
because Cabernet Sauvignon shone in Napa Valley, and Sauvignon 
Blanc performs well in Bordeaux where Cabernet Sauvignon also 
excels. In fact, Sauvignon Blanc is genetically one of the parents of 
the Cabernet Sauvignon grape, along with Cabernet Franc.
Many of the early fine examples of Sauvignon Blanc wines did 
come out of the Napa Valley. Although these Napa Valley wineries 
still produce good Sauvignon Blancs, we sense that today’s epi-
center for California Sauvignon Blanc might be switching to cooler 
Sonoma County and, to a lesser extent, Santa Barbara.
In this section, we focus on the main wine regions in California pro-
ducing Sauvignon Blanc wines, and we name some of our favorite 
California Sauvignon Blancs.
Napa originals
After the success of Robert Mondavi’s Fumé Blanc in 1968 (see the 
earlier section “Some history on Sauvignon Blanc”), other Napa 
Valley wineries began to make Sauvignon Blanc a part of their port-
folio of wines. Three Napa wineries that continue to be standard 
bearers for Sauvignon Blanc today are Frog’s Leap, St. Supéry, and 
Voss Vineyards:
 
✓ Frog’s Leap: This was one of the first California wineries 
to specialize in Sauvignon Blanc; today, Sauvignon Blanc 
comprises half of the winery’s 50,000-case Rutherford AVA 
production.
 
✓ St. Supéry: Here’s another one of the rare Napa Valley win-
eries that feature Sauvignon Blanc, not Chardonnay, as the 
primary white wine. In fact, St. Supéry makes two Sauvignon 
Blancs: its standard Sauvignon Blanc, which sells for less 
than $20, and an excellent single-vineyard Sauvignon Blanc, 
Dollarhide Ranch, which costs $30 to $35.

 Chapter 5: Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc 103
 
✓ Voss Vineyards: This winery, which grows its Sauvignon Blanc 
grapes in Napa Valley’s Rutherford district, champions the 
grassy, herbaceous style of Sauvignon Blanc. Voss is also one 
of the few California producers using a screwcap rather than a 
cork on its Sauvignon Blanc bottles (although other California 
wineries are switching over to screwcaps as fast as they can). 
Voss Vineyards’ Sauvignon Blanc retails for about $16.
Seven other Napa Valley wineries known for their Sauvignon Blancs 
are Flora Springs, which calls its wine Soliloquy, Selene (whose 
grapes come from Carneros’s Hyde Vineyard), Cakebread Cellars, 
Grgich Hills, Honig, Rudd Estate, and Mayacamas. Spottswoode 
is another Napa Valley winery making a fine Sauvignon Blanc, but 
production is small and the wine is difficult to find.
 
Mayacamas Vineyards is an old-time (for California) mountain 
winery known for its long-lasting wines. Mayacamas’s history dates 
back to 1889. Its present owner, Bob Travers (along with his son, 
Chris), produces only 600 cases or so of Sauvignon Blanc every year 
in a style that we love: crisp, lively, assertive, and with excellent 
citrus and mineral notes. Mayacamas Sauvignon Blanc is one of the 
truly long-lived Sauvignons made in California; in a good vintage, it 
will age for ten years or more. The current vintage sells for $30.
Another iconic Sauvignon Blanc that we love — and wish we could 
get our hands on more of — is the “I Block” Fumé Blanc Reserve 
of Robert Mondavi Winery. This limited production wine, from 
the To-Kalon Vineyard, costs about $75 a bottle. If that sounds 
pricey for a Sauvignon Blanc, well, it can seem like a bargain when 
you taste how complex and compelling the wine is after several 
years of age. We also love the Robert Mondavi Winery Fumé Blanc 
Reserve, which also comes from the To-Kalon Vineyard but costs a 
lot less — only about $35 to $40.
A positive sign for Sauvignon Blanc in California is that a few win-
eries have begun making varietal Sauvignon Blanc for the first 
time. For example, Napa Valley’s prestigious Franciscan Estate has 
released its first Sauvignon Blanc ever with its 2007 vintage. And 
it’s a good one, made in a combined fruity and herbal style with a 
bit of ingratiating sweetness. It sells for $16 to $17.
Sonoma takes on Sauvignon
With the stylistic preference for California Sauvignon Blancs 
gradually switching from oak-influenced to grassy, herbaceous, 
and fruity styles, the cooler American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) 

Part II: The Headliners  
104
in Sonoma County are now producing many of California’s most 
sought-after Sauvignon Blancs. Russian River Valley, in particular, 
and the cooler parts of Dry Creek Valley — the district’s western 
vineyards, near Russian River Valley — excel with Sauvignon Blanc 
today.
Russian River Valley
Sonoma’s cool Russian River Valley (refer back to Figure 5-1) 
has already proven to be an excellent location for Pinot Noir and 
Chardonnay wines, but lately it’s become known as a fine source of 
Sauvignon Blancs as well.
Leading the way for Sauvignon Blancs in the Russian River Valley 
is J. Rochioli, a winery known for its Pinot Noirs. Rochioli’s 
Sauvignon Blanc is a lively, crisp wine made in the fruity style, with 
lots of citrus notes; a small amount of oak fermentation rounds 
out the wine’s texture and gives the wine weight. At $33 to $34, it’s 
a bit pricey for a Sauvignon Blanc, but we believe it’s worth the 
price.
Another Russian River Valley winery, Sauvignon Republic, is (as its 
name suggests) devoted exclusively to Sauvignon Blanc. Sauvignon 
Republic’s Russian River Valley Sauvignon Blanc, made in the 
grassy, herbaceous style, sells for $15 to $16.
Hanna Winery also makes its Russian River Sauvignon Blanc 
($14 to $16) in the grassy style. Other top Russian River Valley 
Sauvignon Blancs include Adler Fels, Chateau St. Jean, Dutton 
Estate, Gary Farrell, Paradise Ridge, and Rodney Strong.
Dry Creek Valley
Although Dry Creek Valley is best known for its terrific Zinfandels 
and its Cabernet Sauvignons, we now add Sauvignon Blanc to 
its list of very good varietal wines. At Dry Creek Vineyard, in 
fact, Sauvignon Blanc is the flagship white. Dry Creek Vineyard 
produces three Fumé Blancs, as they’re called at this winery. Its 
Sonoma County Fumé Blanc, about $14, is in a restrained grassy, 
herbaceous style. Dry Creek Vineyards’ two fine single-vineyard 
Fumé Blancs — its Estate DCV 3 and its Taylor’s Vineyard Musqué, 
both about $25 — are in the fruity style. Dry Creek Vineyard for-
merly made an oak-influenced Reserve Fumé Blanc, but the owners 
dropped the Reserve from the winery’s portfolio. Now all its Fumé 
Blancs are oak-free.

 Chapter 5: Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc 105
Fritz Winery is also a champion of Sauvignon Blanc in Dry Creek 
Valley. Its Estate Sauvignon Blanc, about $20, is crisp and lively, 
with pronounced fruity flavors but also with a touch of grassiness.
Other fine Dry Creek Valley Sauvignon Blancs include those of 
Adobe Road, a small, new winery producing two Sauvignons (one 
from Dry Creek Valley and one from Russian River Valley); Dutcher 
Crossing; Handley Cellars; Lambert Bridge; Mill Creek; and Quivira 
Vineyards.
Top Sauvignon Blanc wines 
from other regions
Two important Sauvignon Blanc producers are in Santa Barbara 
County:
 
✓ Babcock Winery and Vineyards: Babcock is in the Sta. 
Rita Hills, an AVA known for its Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. 
Although Babcock produces good examples of these other 
wines, it has become well-known for its assertive Sauvignon 
Blanc, made in the grassy style, which sells for about $20.
 
✓ Brander Vineyard: In the Santa Ynez Valley AVA, this winery 
is arguably the greatest Sauvignon Blanc specialist of any 
winery in California — no, make that the entire U.S. Although 
Brander does make other wines, its most important wine is 
Sauvignon Blanc. Brander produces an amazing five different 
Sauvignon Blancs — in all styles and with prices ranging from 
$15 to $30. Brander ferments and ages most of its Sauvignons 
in stainless steel tanks and avoids new oak at all costs.
The Santa Ynez Valley, an inland area of Santa Barbara County, is 
in fact a prime source for Sauvignon Blancs, despite the fact that 
it’s warmer than other parts of Santa Barbara County. Besides 
Brander, some top Santa Ynez Valley producers of Sauvignon Blanc 
include the Ojai Vineyard, Fiddlehead Cellars, Lincroft Vineyards, 
Firestone Vineyard, and Gainey Vineyard.
Other California Sauvignon Blancs we enjoy are Greenwood Ridge 
Vineyards in Anderson Valley (Mendocino) and Bernardus in 
Monterey County.

Dining in Healdsburg in Sonoma
Russian River Valley, Dry Creek Valley, and Alexander Valley come together around 
Healdsburg, the main wine town in Northern Sonoma. Even before the true destina-
tion dining rooms arrived, Healdsburg was still a fantastic place to dine — thanks 
to sweet little country restaurants and a few more contemporary staples. But now 
you have even more options.
Cyrus: Without question, this is Sonoma County’s finest fine-dining restaurant. Run 
by veteran San Francisco maitre d’ Nick Peyton and heralded chef Douglas Keane, 
it’s truly a gastronome’s dream destination: Romantic Burgundy, France–inspired 
interior, an intimate and friendly yet somewhat formal atmosphere, and to-die-for 
seasonal “contemporary luxury” cuisine (read: French-inspired with seasonal and 
global influences). An evening appropriately starts, if your heart desires, with selec-
tions from carts showcasing caviar (measured to order on a scale against tiny 
gold bars) and Champagne. It continues with a menu of build-your-own fixed-price 
three-, four-, or five-course options, which might include heavenly seared foie gras 
with fig compote, crispy potato, and balsamic reduction; roasted quail with black 
mission figs and mushrooms, and glazed pork belly with braised lettuce and fried 
green tomato. If there’s any question this restaurant wants to perfect the dining 
experience, consider this: The chef’s personal line is listed on the Web site for 
those who want to discuss special dietary requests. 29 North St. (at Healdsburg 
Ave.); phone 707-433-3311; Web site www.cyrusrestaurant.com. Reservations 
required. 3 courses $58; 4 courses $69; 5 courses $80.
Bistro Ralph (California): Located on the square and looking rather industrial-chic 
amidst its country-town environs, this longtime standby is a prime pick for a fresh, 
tasty meal in an upbeat and casual environment. Whether in the narrow dining 
room with high ceilings, concrete floors, and stainless steel embellishments around 
the open kitchen and bar or on the small sidewalk patio, diners have come to feast 
on chef/owner Ralph Tingle’s deliciously simple fare showcasing local ingredients. 
Though the menu changes weekly, with seasonal dishes such as sautéed mahi mahi 
with hedgehog mushrooms, there are some standards that would inspire protest if 
taken off the list — osso buco (veal shanks) with saffron risotto, for example. Lunch 
goes lighter with upscale salads and sandwiches. 109 Plaza St. (at Healdsburg 
Ave.); phone 707-433-1380. Web site www.bistroralph.com. Reservations recom-
mended. Main courses $9.50–$15 lunch, $17–$25 dinner.
Willi’s Seafood & Raw Bar (seafood/Latin-inspired American): This relative new-
comer underscores Healdsburg’s evolution from down-home dining rooms to fes-
tive, modern restaurants with city-slick bars and menus. With urban-Caribbean 
decor, an exotic selection of international small plates (think ceviches, skewers, 
New England-style “rolls,” and a crazy-good array of other options), and 40 mostly 
local wines (all of which are available by the glass, carafe, and full bottle), Willi’s 
slick but relaxed surroundings and unconventional fare are a far cry from the 
area’s traditional joints. But that’s a good thing — especially if you’re in the mood 

 Chapter 5: Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc 107
for delicate flash-fried calamari appetizer with orange chili gremolata (a parsley-
based condiment), outstanding sliced hanger steak drizzled with chimichurri sauce 
atop a bed of cucumber salad, or caramelized eggplant and French green beans 
with roasted garlic vinaigrette. Add to that heated sidewalk seating and a fun and 
friendly bar scene (with a full bar) and reasonable prices, and you have one of 
downtown’s hottest attractions. 403 Healdsburg Ave., (at North St.); phone 707-433-
9191; Web site www.willisseafood.net. Reservations recommended for parties of 8 
or more. Small plates $4–$14.
Costeaux French Bakery (bakery/café): Swing by this simple, quaint bakery in the 
heart of Healdsburg for breakfast, lunch, or a coffee and pastry. Owned by Karl 
and Nancy Seppi for over 25 years, this family-operated gem churns out sand-
wiches made with homemade artisan bread, hearty soups (the French onion is 
to die for), imaginative salads (daily specials include pistachio pasta and cherry 
tomato with fresh herbs), and insane cakes to satisfy any sweet tooth. (The caramel 
macadamia nut tart is crowned with Belgian chocolate; the pink Champagne unites 
rum custard, whipped cream, and chocolate.) Wash it all down with glass of local 
Fumé Blanc, a Pabst Blue Ribbon, or root beer, and contemplate which winery to 
hit next. 417 Healdsburg Ave.; phone 707-433-1913; Web site www.costeaux.com. 
Main courses $4.25–7.95 breakfast, $4.95–$8.50 lunch.
Healdsburg Downtown Bakery & Creamery (bakery): If you want a local experi-
ence along with your morning jolt of caffeine, head to the pastry party happening 
every morning fronting Healdsburg’s plaza. Inside crowds form to mingle over the 
baked goods by Kathleen Stewart, who used to work at Berkeley’s famed restau-
rant Chez Panisse. Along with your standard lattes and the like, you can load up 
on outstanding breads, focaccia, legendary cinnamon rolls, cakes, and during 
summer, homemade ice cream and sherbets. A bonus for anyone who previously 
visited and experienced the inevitable standing-room-only, in 2005 they added 20 
closely packed family-style seats, breakfast items ranging from eggs to pancakes, 
and soups and salads for lunchtime. 308 A Center St. (at Matheson St.); phone 707-
431-2719; Web site www.downtownbakery.net. Pastries and breads $1.35–$5.50; 
breakfast and lunch main courses $7–$10.
Jimtown Store (deli): Full of wine country character, this retro-hip country store is a 
Sonoma County landmark. Stop by and grab a seat at the counter for a cup of strong 
coffee and check out their seasonal menu — it focuses on local farm fare — or 
take your order to go as a boxed lunch. The store, owned by cookbook author and 
chef Carrie Brown, sells its own brand of condiments. (Try artichoke, caper, or fig 
and olive spreads.) In addition, bottles of local wine share shelf space with candy, 
antiques, and an assortment of wares they describe as “Gifts that are Different.” 
Putter through aisles of patterned oilcloth (sold by the yard), metal lunchboxes, 
vintage Coca-Cola signs, and gift boxes teeming with homemade crostini and local 
cheeses. 6706 State Hwy. 128; phone 707-433-1212; Web site www.jimtown.com. 
Box lunches $11–$13.

Names to Trust in Sauvignon Blanc
Many producers make two Sauvignon Blanc wines, a mid-priced 
Sauvignon that ferments and ages in stainless steel and a more 
expensive Sauvignon that often — but not always — ferments and/
or ages at least partially in French oak. Sometimes the costlier 
Sauvignon simply comes from a better vineyard site, sometimes a 
specific single vineyard, and has been produced without oak.
Generally, if we like one Sauvignon Blanc wine from a particular 
producer, we also like the other Sauvignon Blancs from that pro-
ducer. In our lists of recommended Sauvignon Blancs, we usually 
name each recommended winery without naming specific wines 
from each winery.
We place our top Sauvignon Blanc producers’ wines into two price 
categories:
 
✓ Moderately priced Sauvignon Blancs: Between $12 and $25
 
✓ Moderate-plus Sauvignon Blancs: Between $25 and $50
Top-value California Sauvignon Blancs
These 12 Sauvignon Blancs, all available for $12 and under at nationwide average 
retail prices, are consistently reliable, and they’re our picks as top values for the 
money:
 ✓ Benziger Family Winery (Sonoma Mountain)
 ✓ Estancia Estates (Monterey County)
 ✓ Firestone Vineyard (Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara)
 ✓ Geyser Peak (California)
 ✓ Guenoc (Lake County)
 ✓ Kendall Jackson (California)
 ✓ Kenwood Vineyards (Sonoma County)
 ✓ Murphy-Goode (Alexander Valley, Sonoma)
 ✓ Robert Pepi Winery (Napa County)

N
ot long ago, a proposed ruling to declare Zinfandel the 
official wine of California made its way around legislative 
circles in Sacramento, the state capital. Although Zinfandel has 
impressive family ties to the soil and the people of California — as 
you can read in Chapter 8 — we personally would have voted for 
Cabernet Sauvignon as California’s official wine. Over the past 
few decades, most of our memorable California wines have been 
Cabernets. And Cabernet Sauvignon is the wine that proved to the 
world California’s stellar standing in the red wine universe.
Where there’s Cabernet, there’s Merlot — often coexisting in the 
bottle, regardless of which grape gets official billing on the label. 
California’s Merlot wines have a shorter history than the state’s 
Cabernets, and they’ve had a tougher time establishing a reputa-
tion for greatness. But from the right vineyard, they are indeed 
great.
When the two grapes come together, is the whole greater than 
the sum of the parts? In other words, do California’s nonvarietal 
Cabernet-Merlot blends outshine varietal Cabernets and Merlots? 
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. At least we’re sure of this: California 
Cabernet, Merlot, and their blends together offer terrific drinking. 
In this chapter, we discuss these wines and provide our top recom-
mendations in various price categories.

Hailing the California Cab, 
a World-Class Red
Cabernet Sauvignon is California’s leading red grape variety in 
terms of quantity produced. This is a fairly recent occurrence. For 
many years, Zinfandel topped the statistics (although, of course, 
most of the wine made from those Zinfandel grapes was pink 
rather than red). Now that Cabernet is number one, it can prob-
ably expect to have a long reign as the king of California’s reds, 
because except for Zinfandel, nothing else is close. This section 
gives you the history of Cabernet and describes the taste that 
brought Cabernet Sauvignon its place at the top.
A brief history of Cabernet
 
As grape varieties go, Cabernet Sauvignon is quite young; it was 
born in southwestern France in the 1600s, the product of a cross-
ing between Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon Blanc, both much 
older varieties. In fact, the first recorded reference to Cabernet 
Sauvignon dates back only to the 1700s, in a history of Bordeaux’s 
Château Mouton (now Château Mouton-Rothschild). Bordeaux’s 
legendary wines have made the grape famous since the 1800s.
The Cabernet Sauvignon grape probably came to California in the 
late 1850s or early 1860s, when Agoston Haraszthy introduced sev-
eral hundred European grape varieties to the state (see Chapter 1 
for more on this founder of the California wine industry).
Perhaps the most renowned early California Cabernet Sauvignon 
was Beaulieu Vineyard’s Georges de Latour Private Reserve, which 
made its debut with the 1936 vintage. (Note: We tasted that 1936 
just eight years ago, and it was still very much alive — although 
1951 and 1968 are Beaulieu Vineyard’s true all-time standout 
Cabernet Sauvignon vintages.) More great early California Cabernet 
Sauvignons include Simi’s 1935 and Inglenook’s 1941 Reserve Cask. 
The 1943, 1949, 1955, and 1968 are also fine Inglenook Reserve Cask 
Cabernets.
Those wines and other superb early wines helped establish 
California Cabernet Sauvignon as one of the world’s classic wines. 
Notable contributors to California’s reputation for Cabernet great-
ness include the following:

 Chapter 6: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Their Blends 113
 
✓ Heitz Martha’s Vineyard 1968, 1969, and 1974
 
✓ Louis Martini 1968
 
✓ Robert Mondavi 1968, 1969, and 1974
 
✓ Ridge Vineyard Monte Bello 1970, 1971, and 1974
 
✓ Mayacamas Vineyards 1970 and 1974
Robert Mondavi helped popularize Napa Valley Cabernet 
Sauvignons, as did the great Joe Heitz, who released his first single-
vineyard Martha’s Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, the 1965, in the 
late 1960s.
A landmark event for California Cabernet Sauvignon was the so-
called Judgment of Paris tasting in 1976. In a blind tasting with top 
Bordeaux wines, California Cabernets had the highest average rat-
ings, and the 1973 Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars Cabernet placed first. 
Thirty years later, at a repeat tasting in California with the same 
wines, the 1971 Ridge Monte Bello Cabernet Sauvignon ranked 
first. The second tasting did much to refute the argument that the 
Bordeaux wines merely needed time to develop and would rank 
higher in the future.
The taste of California Cabernet
Cabernet grapes (like all grapes) grow differently and develop dif-
ferent taste characteristics in different wine regions. For instance, 
when Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grow in very cool climates, the 
flavor of the wine can run toward vegetal notes, such as green bell 
peppers. In very warm climates, the wine’s flavors can suggest 
baked fruit rather than fresh fruit.
In general, however, wines from the Cabernet Sauvignon grape are 
deep in color and medium- to full-bodied, with firm tannin, lean 
structure, and a relatively simple aroma/flavor profile that includes 
black currant, mint, tobacco, and cedar. Some Cabernets are 
slightly sweet, with flavors that suggest candied fruit, and others 
are dry, with flavors of dark fruits and sometimes earthy notes.
Given California’s fairly warm climate, the Cabernet wines pro-
duced there tend to be rather full-bodied and high in alcohol, with 
many containing 14 percent alcohol and upward. The richest wines 
have dense, velvety texture as well as a considerable amount of 
tannin that shows itself in the back of your mouth as you taste the 
wine. The lightest wines are fairly smooth in texture with a medium 
to small amount of tannin.

Part II: The Headliners  
114
 
The majority of California’s Cabernets are dry wines and do have 
noticeable tannin. That tannin is just a fact of life for Cabernet, 
although today’s winemakers are adept at softening the tannin so 
that it doesn’t taste bitter. And frankly, a meal with meat or cheese 
generally mellows that tannin right out of the wine’s taste. (For tips 
on pairing wine and foods, flip to Chapter 12.)
 
We’ve overheard many wine drinkers tell clerks in wine shops that 
they prefer Merlot to Cabernet because Cabernet is “too dry.” In 
fact, most Merlots and Cabernets are equally dry, in the sense of 
lacking residual sugar (natural grape sugar that fails to ferment 
into alcohol). But Cabernet wines are often dryer in texture than 
Merlot because the grape has more aggressive tannin.
California’s winemakers make Cabernet wines to suit different 
consumer tastes, and those wines taste different depending on 
the price tier. Elite Cabernets, costing $50 a bottle or double (and 
sometimes more than quadruple), for example, are powerful red 
wines with a serious amount of firm tannin from aging in small, new 
barrels of French oak. In contrast, Cabernets that sell for about 
$10 or less are often medium-bodied, easy-to-drink, very fruity red 
wines with a bit of sweetness and very little tannin to speak of.
Making a California original 
from a Bordeaux grape
In describing the taste of California Cabernets, we feel compelled 
to compare them to red Bordeaux wines. The Bordeaux region of 
western France produces the world’s most legendary wines based 
on the Cabernet Sauvignon grape.
The red wines of a particular part of Bordeaux, known as the Left 
Bank, are the most Cabernet Sauvignon–dominant Bordeaux wines; 
they typically contain about 60 to 65 percent Cabernet Sauvignon. 
Connoisseurs and collectors revere some Left Bank Bordeaux 
wines that have maintained the highest standards of quality over 
decades and sometimes centuries. The best Left Bank Bordeaux 
wines can age for many decades, developing complex, compelling 
aromas and flavors of leather, tobacco, and cedar and becoming 
soft in texture and nearly sweet from their aged tannins.
 
California’s Cabernets are different from Cabernet-based Bordeaux 
reds, even comparing the best wines from each region. California’s 
Cabs tend to

 Chapter 6: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Their Blends 115
 
✓ Be fruitier and therefore more enjoyable when they’re young
 
✓ Be fuller in body
 
✓ Have sweeter, riper fruit flavors and less earthy flavor
 
✓ Have higher alcohol content
 
✓ Have softer, denser texture
In our experience, they also retain their youthfulness longer, so at 
20 years of age, for example, many taste fresher and more youthful 
than 20-year-old Bordeaux wines of comparable quality.
Most of Bordeaux’s least expensive wines are heavily based on 
Merlot rather than Cabernet, which makes comparisons at the 
lowest price levels meaningless. At mid-price levels, however — say 
about $25 a bottle — the general differences between Bordeaux 
and California Cabs do ring true: California’s wines are fruitier and 
fuller-bodied, with riper fruit flavors, less earthiness, and less veg-
etal suggestion in their flavor than Bordeaux wines.
The California style of Cabernet Sauvignon (we’re talking mid-
priced and higher here) is so unique, in fact, that it has redefined 
Cabernet Sauvignon wine. California’s top Cabernets have become 
role models for winemakers all over the world, who emulate their 
ripe fruit character, relatively soft tannins, and rich texture.
When in doubt, reach for a Cabernet
When we choose a California Cabernet, we have various reasons for doing so. 
Sometimes we want a powerhouse wine with ripe, fruity flavor to accompany rare 
steak. Sometimes in restaurants, when all the affordable options are fairly young 
wines (the older vintages cost almost as much as our monthly mortgage!), we opt 
for California Cabernet because we know it will be enjoyable even when it’s really 
too young.
But other times, we choose Cabernet because it’s the safest choice. On an airplane 
(in coach)? At a wedding that features no-name wines chosen by a frugal caterer? 
Buying a boxed wine for a weekend outdoors? In all these situations, we choose 
Cabernet, because our experience has proven that Cabernet is the most reliable 
wine. It holds up to poor storage better than other red wines, and it’s more consis-
tent in quality from one brand to the next than Pinot Noir is. Also, a cheap Cabernet 
is usually better quality than a cheap white wine or a cheap Merlot.

Where the Cabernet Grows: Our 
Cabernet Recommendations
Cabernet Sauvignon needs a warm, dry climate with a fairly long 
growing season because it’s a late-ripening grape. In terms of 
quality, the three most important regions for Cabernet Sauvignon 
wines and Cabernet-based blended wines are Napa Valley, Sonoma 
County, and the Santa Cruz Mountains.
Cabernet is king in Napa Valley, where it arguably grows best. 
Parts of Sonoma County do very well with Cabernet, especially 
Alexander Valley, Dry Creek Valley, and Sonoma Mountain. 
Cabernet Sauvignon is, together with Pinot Noir, the main red 
variety in the Santa Cruz Mountains. It has a strong presence 
in southern Monterey County (Arroyo Seco), San Luis Obispo’s 
Paso Robles region, and in the Lodi-Woodbridge region of the San 
Joaquin (Central) Valley.
Although Cabernet Sauvignon is a reliable grape variety that can 
grow well in many regions, it doesn’t thrive everywhere. Early 
attempts to grow Cabernet Sauvignon in northern Monterey 
County and other cool Central Coast regions ended in failure 
because the grapes were underripe and gave the wines overpower-
ing aromas of bell peppers (caused by a chemical compound called 
pyrazine). Eventually, these vines had to be pulled out.
In this section, we characterize the Cabernet Sauvignons of the 
major Cabernet regions and list our recommended wines in four 
price categories.
Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignons
Napa Valley has the most Cabernet Sauvignon acreage in the state 
and clearly the largest number of wineries producing Cabernet 
Sauvignon wines. Probably about two-thirds of California’s best 
Cabernets come from Napa Valley grapes.
Even though Napa Valley is quite small, it has 14 distinct American 
Viticultural Areas (AVAs; see Chapter 4 for the listing), all of 
which — even cool, windy Carneros — grow Cabernet Sauvignon. 
Cabernet grows on the valley floor and the benchlands leading 
up to the mountains, as well as in the mountains themselves: the 
Mayacamas Mountains to the west and Vaca Mountains to the east. 

 Chapter 6: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Their Blends 117
This diversity of growing areas leads to interesting comparisons 
between mountain Cabernets (which are generally more tannic 
and have more acidity and concentrated fruit character) and valley 
floor Cabernets (which are usually broader in structure, with riper, 
more generous fruit character).
Eleven of Napa Valley’s 14 AVAs are most important for Cabernet 
Sauvignon. Here they are, listed from south to north within each 
bullet point:
 
✓ Valley floor/benchland: Oak Knoll District, Yountville, 
Oakville, Rutherford, and St. Helena
 
✓ Mayacamas Mountains: Mt. Veeder, Spring Mountain District, 
and Diamond Mountain District
 
✓ Vaca Mountains: Atlas Peak, Stags Leap District (hillside), and 
Howell Mountain
Los Carneros is certainly an important AVA in Napa (and Sonoma), 
but only a few wineries make Cabernet Sauvignon in that cool 
region.
 
Each AVA produces distinctly different Cabernet Sauvignons. 
For example, Stags Leap District and Oak Knoll District (typified 
by the Cabernets of Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars, Clos du Val, and 
Trefethen Vineyards) are known for their elegant, finesseful wines, 
whereas Diamond Mountain and Howell Mountain (typified by the 
Cabernets of Diamond Creek and Dunn Vineyards) are known for 
powerful, tannic, full-bodied wines requiring considerable aging 
before they’re ready to drink.
Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignons are by far the most expensive 
wines in California. Witness our recommendations, which include 
only one moderately priced ($12 to $20) wine and, at the opposite 
extreme, 40 high-end ($50 to $100) Cabs. And we had to create a 
fourth category, luxury Cabernets, for the many over-$100, well-
regarded Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignons.
However, a quick perusal of our moderate-plus ($20 to $50) rec-
ommendations reveals many excellent Napa Valley Cabernet 
Sauvignons, including favorites of ours that stylistically stand out 
from the mainstream. These include Clos du Val, Dyer Vineyard, 
Frog’s Leap, Mount Veeder Winery, Trefethen, and Truchard 
Vineyards, all elegantly styled, restrained Cabernets that are great 
dinner companions.

Paying for cult Cabernets
Just as people make cult heroes out of celebrities in the U.S., they also give cer-
tain California red wines cult status. These cult wines include, in particular, small-
production, hard-to-find Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignons and Cabernet blends 
that receive high ratings from a few influential wine critics. How else can anyone 
explain $1,800 as an average per-bottle price for a recent-vintage Screaming Eagle 
Cabernet Sauvignon? It’s a fine Cabernet, no doubt, but worth ten times as much 
as other fine California Cabernets? Or worth more than elite Bordeaux wines with 
200-year histories and proven longevity?
Other really expensive Napa Cabernets and Cabernet blends include Harlan Estate 
Proprietary Red Blend ($750 for the latest vintage and over $1,000 for older vintages); 
Bryant Family Cabernet Sauvignon ($600); Colgin Cellars Cabernet Sauvignons (up 
to $500); and Araujo Estate Eisele Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (over $300). These 
prices are immaterial for most people because all these wines are very difficult 
to find.
And yet ironically, too many Napa Valley Cabernets, including the expensive ones, 
lack distinctiveness: They are powerful, fleshy wines with soft tannins and aromas 
and flavors redolent of overripe fruit and new oak barrels. Generally, these wines 
are too powerful to complement food. In short, if you want to own Napa Valley 
cult Cabernets, you can find them. But if you simply want a good-drinking Napa 
Cabernet with dinner, check out our less-expensive recommended Cabernet 
Sauvignon wines.

The Mondavi legacy
When Constellation Brands, the world’s largest wine company, purchased Robert 
Mondavi Corporation and all its brands in 2004, many Mondavi fans wondered what 
would become of the family. Four years later, all seems to be going well with Robert 
Mondavi Winery, judging by its latest vintages. And Robert Mondavi’s two sons 
and daughter — Michael, Tim, and Marcia — now have Napa Valley Cabernet 
Sauvignon–based wines of their own. The two wines (Tim and Marcia are partners 
in producing one of them) are different, but both are exceptional.
In 2005, the families of Tim Mondavi, Marcia Mondavi, and the late Robert Mondavi 
joined forces to produce a wine, appropriately named Continuum, from grapes 
grown in Oakville vineyards and vineyards in the Stags Leap District that the Robert 
Mondavi family had cultivated for decades. The 2005 Continuum is a Bordeaux-
style blend: 58 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, 23 percent Cabernet Franc, and 19 
percent Petit Verdot. The blend can change with each vintage, according to what 
Tim Mondavi and his winemaking team deem best. The 2005 Continuum (about 
$150) really impressed us. It’s a cross between fine Bordeaux and elegantly-styled 
Napa Cabernet, with firm acidity and lots of finesse. Tim made just 1,500 cases of 
this wine.
Even at this early stage, 2005 Continuum tastes as if it will be one of the great 
Mondavi family wines. Production will increase a bit, but Tim wants to keep it small 
and high-quality, not more than several thousand cases a year.
The impressive 2005 M by Michael Mondavi (about $200) is entirely Cabernet 
Sauvignon, sourced from an Atlas Peak vineyard owned by Michael and his wife 
Isabel. M is more typical of a top Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon than Continuum 
is; it’s richer and fleshier but with the restraint and balance that typifies the Mondavi 
Cabernet style. Still a baby now, the 2005 M will join the ranks of California’s finest 
red wines. Only 600 cases of the 2005 exist, and Michael says that no more than 
1,200 cases will be produced in future vintages. The wine will sell primarily in fine 
restaurants and resorts.
With these two impressive wines, the Mondavi family’s legacy is in good shape.

Sonoma Cabernets
When we think of wines from Sonoma County, Pinot Noir, 
Chardonnay, and Zinfandel usually come to mind because Sonoma 
does so well with these three grape varieties. But Cabernet 
Sauvignon is actually the second most planted grape variety in 
Sonoma (after Chardonnay). Sonoma is also second only to Napa 
Valley in all of California in its Cabernet Sauvignon acreage.
About twice as large as Napa Valley, Sonoma County has more-
diverse microclimates (see Chapter 1 for more on microclimate); 
only the warmer areas of Sonoma — such as Alexander Valley, 
parts of Dry Creek Valley, and smaller areas such as Sonoma 
Mountain and parts of Sonoma Valley — are known for their 
Cabernet Sauvignon wines.
Most of Sonoma’s Cabernet Sauvignons come from five AVAs:
 
✓ Alexander Valley: Cabernet Sauvignon is the leading variety 
in this huge valley in Northern Sonoma.
 
✓ Dry Creek Valley: This AVA is just west of Alexander Valley. 
Cabernet Sauvignon is the leading variety, followed by 
Zinfandel.
 
✓ Knights Valley: The warmest Sonoma AVA, Knights Valley is 
bordered by Alexander Valley in the west and Napa County in 
the east. Cabernet Sauvignon reigns supreme here.
 
✓ Sonoma Mountain: Cabernet Sauvignon is the dominant 
grape variety in this AVA, which is situated within the larger 
Sonoma Valley AVA.
 
✓ Sonoma Valley: Sonoma Valley is a huge AVA in southern 
Sonoma. Among red wines, Cabernet rules here, followed by 
Zinfandel and Syrah.

Santa Cruz Mountain Cabernet 
Sauvignons
The rugged terrain of the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA, about an 
hour’s drive south of San Francisco, spreads out over Santa Clara, 
Santa Cruz, and San Mateo Counties. The isolation, lack of modern 
conveniences, and thin mountain soil are just some of the chal-
lenges that face grape growers and wineries there, and yet the AVA 
has more than 80 wineries, including some of the best in the state. 
Even though the Santa Cruz Mountains area seems large, it encom-
passes fewer than 1,500 acres of vines.
Microclimates vary widely, depending on which side of the moun-
tain range a vineyard is situated on (Pacific Ocean or San Francisco 
Bay) and what its elevation is. The three leading varietal wines 
produced in the Santa Cruz Mountains are Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, 
and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order. Most of the wineries spe-
cializing in Cabernet Sauvignon are on the warmer San Francisco 
Bay side of the mountain range, but they’re high enough in eleva-
tion to avoid coastal fog.
Laurel Glen Estate, a Sonoma star
One of California’s consistently finest Cabernet Sauvignons comes not from Napa 
Valley but from Sonoma, and it costs but a mere $55! We’re talking about owner-
winemaker Patrick Campbell’s Laurel Glen Estate Cabernet, from grapes sourced 
high on Sonoma Mountain, above the fog line.
What is Patrick Campbell’s secret (besides a great site for Cabernet Sauvignon)? First 
of all, he chooses only the best vineyard blocks for his Laurel Glen Estate Cabernet 
Sauvignon; the remainder goes into a second Cabernet called “Counterpoint” 
(about $30). Second, Campbell’s winemaking philosophy favors balanced, complex 
Cabernet Sauvignon that ages well; he’s not interested in producing the sort of ripe, 
jammy, powerful Cabs that attract big scores from some wine critics. And he insists 
on charging what he considers to be a fair price for his wines. Wouldn’t it be nice if 
there were more people in the wine business like Patrick Campbell?
For fun, Campbell makes an everyday red called “Reds” — usually a blend of 60 
percent 70-year-old-vine Zinfandel, 30 percent Carignan, and 10 percent Petite 
Sirah — which sells for about $9 to $11. It happens to be one of the best under-$12 
red wines in California.

Other California Cabernets
Although Napa Valley and Sonoma County are the prime regions 
for Cabernet Sauvignon (with a nod to Santa Cruz Mountains as a 
small but excellent source), the state’s leading red varietal wine 
comes from many other regions. Paso Robles in San Luis Obispo 
County, for example, is known for its Cabernet Sauvignons. On the 
other hand, very few wineries in Santa Barbara County produce 
Cabernet Sauvignons; it’s just not warm enough for Cabernet, a 
variety that needs a long, warm growing season.
In this section, we list our recommended Cabernet Sauvignons 
from other regions throughout California in two price categories: 
moderately priced and moderate-plus. Make sure you also check

Merlot, Sometimes a Contender
The Merlot grape, like Cabernet Sauvignon, hails from the 
Bordeaux region of France. Genetic testing has proved that Merlot is 
the offspring of Cabernet Franc and therefore is related to Cabernet 
Sauvignon, which also originated from Cabernet Franc. Today, 
Cabernet Sauvignon plantings worldwide exceed those of Merlot 
but not by much. In California, however, a big gap exists: Cabernet 
Sauvignon claims 62 percent more acreage than Merlot does.
In this section, we introduce you to Merlot wine and characterize 
its style.

Merlot’s up, down, and 
Sideways reputation
Merlot in California is a bundle of contradictions. Merlot grapes 
are fairly easy to grow and therefore are very popular with grape 
growers, and yet only in a few places in California do the grapes 
grow well enough to make seriously good wine. California’s Merlot 
wines have mass appeal with wine drinkers, and yet many con-
noisseurs dismiss them. (You might recall the sentiments toward 
“[expletive deleted] Merlot” expressed by Miles Raymond, the 
main character in the film Sideways.) And yet some excellent 
California Merlots do exist.
As a varietal wine, Merlot got off to a late start in California. The 
very first varietal Merlot wines were those of Sterling Vineyards 
and Louis M. Martini Winery, which both produced varietal Merlot 
from the 1968 vintage.
Merlot today is the number three red grape variety in the state in 
terms of tons harvested, after Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. 
Merlot wine began an impressive ascent in popularity in the mid-
1990s, racking up sales growth of almost 35 percent each year, on 
the average, from 1995 to 1999. That was a period when many wine 
drinkers were shifting to red wines from white and blush wines, 
and Merlot became a popular choice. Since then, growth in Merlot 
sales has slowed to more reasonable levels — particularly in 2005, 
as the impact of Sideways made itself felt. Still, Americans drank 
21.4 million cases of California Merlot in 2006, proving that Merlot 
is alive and well in California.
 
One of California’s top Merlot producers, Swanson Vineyards (in 
Napa Valley) promoted Merlot heavily with wine journalists and 
restaurant wine buyers in the wake of the Sideways backlash against 
Merlot. The reason Merlot is so popular with some wine drinkers 
and yet so scorned by others, the winery representatives theorized, 
is that Merlot vines need certain vineyard conditions — a relatively 
cool climate; well-drained soils, generally clay; and sites conducive 
to slow, even growth and ripening — to produce grapes capable of 
making great wine. When grown in less-than-optimal conditions, the 
grapes produce wines that are thin and lack concentration of flavor. 
Such wine can be appealing to those who want an easy-to-drink red 
wine whose tannins are soft, but they fall short of Merlot’s potential.
The taste of California Merlot
Imagine a deeply colored red wine — a full-bodied, dry wine with 
soft, velvety tannin and aromas and flavors of ripe, dark plums, a 
hint of chocolate, and a slight toasty note of oak. It fills your mouth 

 Chapter 6: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Their Blends 127
with its fleshy texture and its plump, fruity flavors, yet it’s not too 
soft; it has enough firmness to give it definition. If you had to asso-
ciate it with a shape, you’d say it tastes “round.” That’s the experi-
ence of California Merlot at its best. And who wouldn’t love such 
a wine? Its plumpness, richness, and softness are the reason that 
Merlot became popular in the first place.
 
To capture the experience of a plump, rich, and soft Merlot, you 
should expect to pay at least $20 a bottle in a wine shop. When you 
pay less than $20 for Merlot, you get less plump-fruit impression, 
and you might find aromas and flavors of tea or other herbal notes, 
as well as a thinner, less velvety texture. You still get the deep 
color, full body, and soft tannin, however.
Either way, you find that Merlot’s intensity of aroma and flavor 
(how pronounced the aromas and flavors are) is fairly low key, 
especially compared to a wine such as Pinot Noir (Chapter 7 tells 
all about California Pinot Noir). Merlot has that characteristic in 
common with Cabernet Sauvignon; what’s appealing about these 
types of wine is their structure (their mouthfeel, body, texture, and 
depth) at least as much as their flavors.
 
Because Merlot is not an intensely flavorful wine, it’s a good 
accompaniment to food. It lets the food’s flavors take center 
stage and doesn’t compete with them. (Read more about pairing 
California wine with food in Chapter 12.)
Just as Cabernet producers often blend in a bit of Merlot to give 
their wine softness, Merlot producers often take advantage of 
their “25 percent other-grapes allowed” option to blend in some 
Cabernet Sauvignon. (See Chapter 2 for info on varietal wine regu-
lations.) The more Cabernet that a Merlot wine has, the firmer and 
less “round” the wine will be. Some winemakers say that Merlot 
can taste a bit hollow — or they describe it as seeming to have a 
hole in the middle of its taste — unless the wine includes some 
Cabernet. Unfortunately, the label rarely tells you whether the 
wine contains any Cabernet Sauvignon.
Regions That Excel with Merlot
About one-third of California’s Merlot vineyards is in the very 
warm Central Valley, where conditions aren’t optimal for this 
variety. Another one-third, approximately, is in Napa Valley and 
Sonoma County together, and most of California’s best Merlots hail 
from these areas.

Eighteen top-value California Merlots
These 18 Merlots, all under $15, are consistently reliable, and they’re our picks as

 ✓ Raymond Vineyard, R Collection (California)
 ✓ Red Truck (California)
 ✓ Sebastiani Vineyards (Sonoma County)
 ✓ Taft Street Winery (Sonoma County)
Just as for Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley is the leading region 
for varietal Merlots. One main difference from Cabernet Sauvignon, 
however, is that the cool Carneros AVA, which extends from 
Napa into Sonoma County, is a prime region for Merlot in Napa 
Valley. Merlot grows quite well in fairly cool microclimates such as 
Carneros because it ripens earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon.
Paso Robles AVA in San Luis Obispo boasts the third-largest pro-
duction of Merlot, apart from Napa and the statewide California 
AVA itself. Sonoma County is also a prime region for Merlot: 
Sonoma’s microclimates vary so widely that Merlot finds many 

 Chapter 6: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Their Blends 129
areas throughout the county in which to thrive. Other important 
regions in California for Merlot are Monterey and Santa Barbara 
Counties.
In this section, we recommend some reliable wines from 
California’s main Merlot regions.
Reliable Napa Valley Merlots
Napa Valley has the largest contingent of renowned Merlot pro-
ducers. Unlike Napa Cabernet Sauvignons, varietal Napa Valley 
Merlots haven’t developed cult followings; this is fortunate for 
wine drinkers, because it means that there are no $100-plus 
Merlots! We list our recommended Napa Valley Merlots in three

The Secret’s in the Bordeaux Blend
The wines of France’s Bordeaux region are the role models for 
most of the world’s Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot wines, and yet 
most of those wines themselves rarely contain 75 percent of either 
grape variety — the minimum amount required to make a varietal 
wine in the U.S. Some California producers have decided to follow 
the Bordeaux model more closely and forego a varietal name for 
their wine in order to have more leverage in blending Cabernet 
Sauvignon and Merlot. While they’re at it, they might throw in 
other so-called Bordeaux grape varieties, such as Cabernet Franc, 
Petit Verdot, or Malbec. In this section, we introduce you to these 
red wines, which are loosely called California’s Bordeaux blends.
Some of these blended wines might be named Meritage or be 
described on their labels as Meritage wines. As we mention in 
Chapter 2, The Meritage Association (www.meritagewine.org) 
permits its members to call a red wine Meritage if no single vari-
ety makes up more than 90 percent of the blend and if the grapes 
include at least two of eight permitted grape varieties. (Besides 
the five classic Bordeaux varieties — Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, 
Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, and Malbec — the others are St. 
Macaire, Gros Verdot, and Carmenère, which are minor varieties in 
the Bordeaux region.) But not every winery that makes a so-called 
Bordeaux blend is a member of the Meritage Association, and 
therefore you don’t always find this term on wine labels.

 Chapter 6: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Their Blends 131
Combining strengths
The point behind blending Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and other 
Bordeaux varieties is not to change the nature of the dominant 
grape but to create a harmonic whole that goes beyond the sum 
of its parts. This is possible because of the similarities among the 
various grape varieties rather than their differences.
Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot are all genetically 
related. All three red varieties make wines that have fairly subtle 
aromas and flavors and strong structural character — meaning 
that the experience of tasting them is more about how they feel in 
your mouth than it is about specific flavors that you can perceive. 
(However, Cabernet Franc is the fruitiest and most flavorful of the 
three, especially in California.) All three varieties have aromas 
and flavors of dark fruits and a tendency toward herbal or vegetal 
notes, especially when the grapes aren’t fully ripe. All three can 
develop tobacco notes with age.
Petit Verdot — a minor variety compared to the other three but 
one that’s becoming increasingly popular with winemakers around 
the world, especially in California — has the characteristics of a 
darker, more concentrated and more tannic Cabernet Sauvignon. 
Malbec to some extent suggests a more rustic Merlot.
In a blend incorporating some or all of these varieties, you ideally 
can’t recognize any one variety. The Merlot rounds out the linear 
structure of the Cabernet Sauvignon, for example, the Petit Verdot 
(usually only a small part of the blend, if used at all) contributes 
some color and spiciness, and the Cabernet Franc brings a bit of 
fruitiness. Each variety completes the others, for a harmonious 
whole.
Many wines that are Bordeaux-style blends mention the grape 
varieties and the percentage of each on the bottle’s back label, 
but some wines don’t reveal the blend on the label — frustrating, 
we know!
Sometimes, you find a wine that could be labeled as a varietal 
Cabernet Sauvignon or a varietal Merlot because one of those vari-
eties accounts for at least 75 percent of the wine. But the percent-
ages of each variety can and do change from one vintage to the 
next, and the winemaker chooses a nonvarietal name for the wine 
so that he or she has the flexibility to use less than 75 percent of a 
dominant variety in the future if desired.

Part II: The Headliners  
132
Key brands of Bordeaux-style blends
Many California wine producers who make varietal Cabernet 
Sauvignon also produce at least one blended red wine. In most 
of these blends, Cabernet Sauvignon is the dominant variety, 
although Merlot or even Cabernet Franc occasionally plays a pri-
mary role. For example, the prestige blend of HdV Wines is mainly 
Merlot, and Dalla Valle’s prestige blend called Maya is often more 
Cabernet Franc than Cabernet Sauvignon.
California’s Bordeaux-style blended wines vary widely: Some utilize 
only Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot or Cabernet Franc; some use 
all three of these varieties; and a few — such as the wines called 
Cain Five and Cinq Cépages — utilize all five of the major Bordeaux 
varieties, including Petit Verdot and Malbec. The percentage of 
each variety usually varies each year, depending on the nature of 
the vintage and/or the tastes of the winemaking team.
Here are two recent trends that we’ve noted in Bordeaux-style red 
blends:
 
✓ Petit Verdot is becoming an increasingly important part of 
many wines. This late-ripening variety adds color, tannin, and 
blueberry and violet aromas and flavors to the blend. Petit 
Verdot generally grows better in many parts of California than 
it does in Bordeaux. The wine called V from Viader Winery is 
a Bordeaux blend that’s primarily Petit Verdot, with a bit of 
Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc.
 
✓ Carmenère and especially Syrah are showing up more and 
more in California’s Bordeaux-style red wine blends. The 
late-ripening Carmenère, an almost-forgotten Bordeaux vari-
ety that’s achieving new fame in Chilean wines, brings texture 
and berry-like aromas and flavor, especially blueberries, to 
blends.
 
 Syrah — a classic Rhône variety — adds color, tannin, and 
its own spicy aromas and flavors. (Read about Syrah wines 
in Chapter 10.) As long as the blended wine doesn’t call 
itself Meritage, Syrah is a perfectly permissible addition to 
California blends.
Frequently, the producer’s blended red wine is its top wine. It can 
often be the winery’s most expensive wine and is sometimes made 
in small quantities, especially in vintages when the weather has 
been difficult.

 Chapter 6: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Their Blends 133
The following lists name some of our picks for red California 
blends based on the Bordeaux grape varieties.
The origins of blending
The origins of blending grape varieties in Bordeaux have less to do with the taste 
of the wine and more to do with practicality. Merlot vines bud earlier than Cabernet 
Sauvignon vines, and the grapes ripen earlier. In years when autumn rains came 
early, Cabernet Sauvignon wouldn’t ripen fully, its growing season cut short by the 
rains, but the Merlot grapes got ripe. In years when there was a late spring frost, 
the Merlot crop could be wiped out because the vines had budded (a very vulner-
able stage), but the Cabernet vines, not yet budded, endured. Each of the two grape 
varieties was an insurance policy against catastrophe with the other variety. Like 
Merlot, Cabernet Franc ripens earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon.
California usually doesn’t have such issues with the weather. When California pro-
ducers blend Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and other varieties, it’s more for taste 
than agricultural expediency.

M
any of the best wines that we’ve ever tasted have been red 
Burgundies from France (made entirely from Pinot Noir 
grapes) or Pinot Noir wines from various New World regions. This 
isn’t surprising, because Pinot Noir is one of the world’s noble 
grape varieties, capable of making great, complex, truly exciting 
red wines. But this grape is also one of the most temperamental 
varieties. So many winemakers we’ve met over the years have 
devoted a good part of their lives to making great wine from this 
extremely challenging grape, only occasionally succeeding. Pinot 
Noir has the nickname “The Heartbreak Grape” for good reason.
What’s so difficult about making a great Pinot Noir wine? First of 
all, finding the best places to plant Pinot Noir vines is tricky. And 
the best locations often have erratic weather that’s great in some 
years and poor in others. The winemakers of the Burgundy region 
in France might seem to have a handle on this grape, but it took 
them hundreds of years, and they still don’t always succeed in 
making great wine. For every superb red Burgundy we’ve tasted, 
we’ve had just as many that were merely okay or worse.
We confess that we have mixed feelings about Pinot Noir. Some 
of the very best wines we’ve enjoyed have been made from Pinot 
Noir. But like our largest male cat, Max (who is so lovable and yet 
drives us crazy most of the time), Pinot Noir wines often frustrate 
us. In this chapter, we explain how Pinot Noir became an overnight 
star in California. Then we point out the regions where Pinot Noir 
grows best in the state and finish up by listing our recommended 
California Pinot Noirs.

From Obscurity to Overnight Fame
 
Pinot Noir is one of the world’s oldest major grape varieties. It 
probably originated in eastern France nearly 2,000 years ago, or 
even earlier. Pinot Noir first became renowned as the great red 
grape variety of Burgundy. Later, the Champagne region adopted 
it as its most important red variety (by the nature of its structure, 
Pinot Noir is ideal for use in sparkling wines).
In California, Pinot Noir has had a fitful history. Some evidence 
exists that Buena Vista Winery in Sonoma grew this variety as 
early as 1858. But before the 1970s, not many Pinot Noir vine-
yards existed in California — and many of those were in the 
wrong location, such as warm sites in Napa Valley, which can be 
fine for Cabernet Sauvignon but not for the more delicate Pinot. 
(We remember some of these Napa Valley Pinot Noir wines from 
vintages such as 1978; they had roasted flavors and really didn’t 
resemble Pinot Noir at all, nor did they age well.)
The new age of Pinot Noir in California began when producers 
started identifying regions suitable for growing Pinot Noir grapes. 
Josh Jensen searched all of California before founding his winery, 
Calera Wine Company, in 1975, in a place he believed to be ideal: 
Mount Harlan in the Gavilan Mountains of San Benito County, just 
east of Monterey County (see the map in Chapter 4). From his first 
Calera Pinot Noirs in 1978, Jensen’s wines were superior to what 
was being produced at the time.
Besides Josh Jensen at Calera, other Pinot Noir specialists of the 
time included Dick Graff at Chalone, Merry Edwards at Mount Eden, 
Francis Mahoney at Carneros Creek, Brad Webb and Bob Sessions 
at Hanzell, Richard Sanford at Sanford & Benedict, and the great Joe 
Swan of Joseph Swan Vineyards in Russian River Valley.
Pinot Noir regrets
The late, great André Tchelistcheff, California’s legendary winemaker who devoted 
his life to producing outstanding Cabernet Sauvignons for Beaulieu Vineyard and 
other wineries, once told us that if he could do it all over again, he’d make Pinot 
Noir instead of Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine he was most proud of was his 1946 
Beaulieu Vineyard Pinot Noir, one of only two outstanding wines he made from this 
variety (the other was Beaulieu Vineyards’ 1947 Pinot Noir).

 Chapter 7: Pinot Noir 137
By the 1980s, a small Pinot Noir movement was in full swing, with 
Jim Clendenon of Au Bon Climat in Santa Barbara, Richard Ward 
and David Graves of Saintsbury in Carneros, and a group of great 
wineries in Russian River Valley — Williams Selyem, Rochioli, 
Dehlinger, and Gary Farrell — all producing their own, very fine, 
unique versions of California Pinot Noir.
Consumer interest in Pinot Noir started growing slowly in the late 
1990s as the quality of the wines improved and new wineries began 
to specialize in Pinot Noir. But it took a popular 2004 Hollywood 
film, Sideways, to give Pinot Noir wines the shot in the arm they 
needed. Sideways, set primarily in the Santa Barbara wine country, 
aroused the interest of thousands of wine drinkers, some of whom 
had never tasted Pinot Noir. With the film’s success, all Pinot Noir, 
but especially California Pinot, became the in wine, almost over-
night. California Pinot Noir sales grew 70 percent in 2005 from the 
previous year.
Pinot Noir is now a hot commodity in California and throughout 
the world. Wine producers in California have been planting Pinot 
Noir at a frenzied pace since the successful film — often pulling out 
Merlot at the same time. (Poor Merlot was slammed — unfairly, we 
think — in Sideways.) Today, well over 200 wineries in California 
make Pinot Noir wine.
Unfortunately, many of the Pinot Noirs rushed to the market 
haven’t been of very high quality. Wine drinkers have had to be 
more careful than ever selecting Pinots. The quest continues.
California-Style Pinot Noir
Pinot Noir wines can vary tremendously according to their vine-
yard site and the winemaking techniques used to make the wine. In 
this section, we discuss the general styles of California Pinot Noir 
and then point out the specific styles of the major California Pinot 
Noir wine regions.
The general style
Pinot Noir wines can be light to deep ruby red in color. Most 
California Pinot Noirs tend to be darker rather than paler; how-
ever, because of the grape’s light pigmentation, Pinot Noir wines 
are generally lighter in color than other popular red wines.

Part II: The Headliners  
138
Structurewise, Pinot Noir can range from medium-bodied to full 
and rich. The fuller-bodied examples are typically deeper in color 
and riper in flavor than the lighter-bodied Pinot Noirs. In general, 
Pinot Noir wines are high in alcohol (most of today’s California 
Pinot Noirs contain over 14 percent alcohol). They have medium 
to high acidity and a low to medium amount of tannin — although 
wines aged in new oak barrels have more tannin. At its best, the 
texture of Pinot Noir wines feels silky or satiny.
Pinot Noir’s aromas and flavors are definitely a strong point: They 
can range from an assortment of berries — mainly raspberries 
and/or strawberries and cherries — to earthy, woodsy, and mush-
roomy. In some wines, the aromas and flavors can give the impres-
sion of very pure fruit. The richest, darkest wines tend to be oaky 
in aroma and flavor. Most California Pinot Noirs express fruity 
rather than earthy, woodsy aromas and flavors.
 
The delicacy of aroma and flavor in Pinot Noir wines allows varia-
tions in vintages and in vineyard sites to become evident, much 
more so than in other wines. This transparency to site accounts 
for wide differences in Pinot Noir wines between one producer and 
another. Because of the wine’s delicate, pure aromas, Pinot Noir is, 
in its classic examples, rarely blended with other grapes.
Some of California’s Pinot Noirs have real finesse: They’re fragrant, 
elegant, and well balanced, with great purity of fruit expression. 
But too many Pinot Noir wines suggest excessive ripeness of the 
grapes: They’re too sweet, rather clumsy, and too high in alcohol. 
These heavy-handed excesses blur the delicacy and elegance that 
we believe Pinot Noirs should possess. Other Pinot Noirs, especially 
many of the inexpensive (under $15) ones, are just too light, with 
candied fruit aromas and flavors as well as perceptible sweetness.
Local styles
California’s unique climate and soil situations have spawned styles 
of Pinot Noir wine distinctly different from those of Burgundy, New 
Zealand, Chile, and even nearby Oregon; however, no such thing as 
“the typical California Pinot Noir” exists. If you were to line up, say, 
an Au Bon Climat Pinot Noir from Santa Barbara County, a Calera 
from Mount Harlan in San Benito County, a Saintsbury from Napa 
Valley’s Carneros, and a Williams Selyem from Sonoma’s Russian 
River Valley — all iconic California Pinot Noirs — you might be 
able to recognize all of them as Pinot Noirs, but they would be four 
very different wines.

 Chapter 7: Pinot Noir 139
In the following list, we make some generalizations about Pinot 
Noir styles from various regions of California (for more on these 
regions and specific wine recommendations, please see the next 
section):
 
✓ Carneros: Carneros Pinot Noirs are renowned for their tight 
structure, herbal aroma nuances, and spicy berry flavors, 
mainly strawberry and black cherry. Some Carneros wineries 
are maintaining an elegant, herbal style that put them on the 
Pinot Noir map in the first place; however, many winemakers 
are now making darker, weightier Pinot Noirs, in keeping with 
the general California trend toward bigger, riper, fruitier, and 
higher-alcohol Pinot Noirs.
 
✓ Santa Maria Valley: The classic Pinot Noir style of Santa 
Maria Valley encompasses aromas and flavors of cherries, 
plums, spices, and sometimes a tomato-like character. High 
acidity and purity of fruit expression also characterize these 
wines.
 
✓ Russian River Valley: Classic Russian River Valley Pinot Noirs 
have always emphasized cherry and berry fruit — primar-
ily raspberry and strawberry — in their aromas and flavors, 
A new trend in California Pinot Noirs
The distressing trend we’ve seen in other California red wines — darker color, 
fuller body, higher alcohol — is occurring among Pinot Noirs as well. The fleshier, 
richer, darker Pinot Noirs certainly have a following, but this style tends to blur 
regional characteristics. Wines made in this new style often taste similar to each 
other, regardless of their region of origin.
Here are some probable reasons for this evolution in style:
 ✓ The darker, more powerful Pinot Noirs seem to obtain higher ratings from some 
wine critics.
 ✓ Most wineries are now growing different clones (genetic variants) of Pinot Noir 
vines — particularly the so-called Dijon clones from the Burgundy region — 
rather than the Martini, Swan, and Pommard clones formerly grown. The grapes 
from these new-for-California clones make wines with more color, weight, and 
alcohol.
 ✓ Some producers are allegedly adding Merlot and/or Syrah to their Pinot Noirs, 
which certainly would make the wines darker in color and fleshier in texture 
(although no respectable producer will admit to such a practice).

Part II: The Headliners  
140
which are concentrated and focused. They typically have 
been medium-bodied and medium to dark ruby in color, with 
a good amount of acidity and a reputation for aging 10 years 
or more. This classic style still exists (in such wineries as 
Hartford Court, Littorai, Mueller Winery, Rochioli Vineyards, 
and Williams Selyem), although the newer, bigger style has 
been making serious inroads.
 
✓ Anderson Valley: Classic Anderson Valley Pinot Noirs are 
characterized by crispness and natural acidity. As a group, 
they tend to be somewhat leaner in style and exhibit more 
earthiness than the plusher, fruitier Russian River Valley 
Pinots. Some critics talk about a red-fruit style of Anderson 
Valley Pinot Noir — medium-bodied, with aromas and flavors 
of red berries and cherries — and a black-fruit style — fuller-
bodied, with aromas and flavors of black cherries, plums, and 
black berries.
 
✓ Sta. Rita Hills: It’s difficult to generalize about a Sta. Rita Pinot 
Noir style because the region is so new. Many of the Sta. Rita 
Pinot Noirs that we’ve tasted from new wineries have been 
very dark in color and quite full-bodied, with lots of ripe, con-
centrated black cherry and other black-fruit flavors.
 
✓ Santa Lucia Highlands: These Pinot Noirs are typically rich 
and full-bodied rather than elegant, with rich, black cherry 
aromas and flavors.
 
✓ Sonoma Coast: In style, Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir wines some-
what resemble Pinot Noirs from their neighbor, Russian River 
Valley. They sport lush red and black fruit aromas and flavors, 
especially black cherry but sometimes also red cherry, along 
with forest and mushroom aromas and a spiciness typical of 
cool-climate wines. They also tend to have higher acidity than 
Pinot Noirs from other regions.
California’s Pinot Noir Regions
Over the years, through trial and error, California wine producers 
have found their best areas for growing Pinot Noir — or at least 
the best areas so far. One characteristic that all these regions have 
in common is a relatively cool climate.
In the following sections, we cover first the classic California Pinot 
Noir regions and our recommended producers from those regions, 
and then we look at the new, trendy California regions and their 
recommended producers. We then cover Pinot Noirs from other 
areas, such as Santa Cruz Mountains and Edna Valley.

 Chapter 7: Pinot Noir 141
Note: Some of the Pinot Noirs we recommend in this chapter are 
small-production wines that have only limited national distribu-
tion. Check www.wine-searcher.com to find retail stores where the 
wine is available and to comparison shop for the lowest prices.
The classic regions
California has five classic Pinot Noir regions, which emerged in the 
1970s and early 1980s:
 
✓ Mount Harlan in San Benito County
 
✓ Carneros in Napa Valley and Sonoma County
 
✓ Santa Barbara County (including Santa Maria Valley and Santa 
Ynez Valley)
 
✓ Russian River Valley (including its subregion, Green Valley)
 
✓ Anderson Valley in Mendocino County
Read on for a brief history of each region’s relationship with Pinot 
Noir, along with some of our wine recommendations.
What’s cool about cool climates
Every Pinot Noir region we describe in this chapter has a cool climate, which slows 
the ripening of the grapes, thanks to one or more of the following factors:
 ✓ Fog that blocks out otherwise warming sun
 ✓ Winds that cool daytime temperatures
 ✓ Nighttime temperatures that fall dramatically
Why is that so important? Generally speaking, the more slowly that grapes ripen, 
the fresher, purer, more focused, and more delicate their aromas and flavors will 
be. Also, the more slowly grapes ripen, the less likely that they’ll be extremely high 
in sugar and low in acid when they’re harvested. (A high sugar level and low acid-
ity in the grapes generally results in huge, full-bodied, high-alcohol wines that are 
less refreshing to drink.)
Because the Pinot Noir grape has a delicate disposition, it tends to favor cool cli-
mates that enable it to ripen slowly but adequately — and we tend to favor the Pinot 
Noir wines that have the delicacy of aroma and flavor and the balanced structure 
that such cool climates foster.

Part II: The Headliners  
142
Mount Harlan, San Benito County
Mount Harlan, a rugged, remote region in the Gavilan Mountains, 
has very few producers. It looks like a cool, barren desert — where 
morning fog and afternoon winds protect the grapes from the heat. 
The nearest town, Hollister, is the place you go for electricity, tele-
phones, paved roads, and other modern conveniences. Only a true 
believer would go through all the hardships to establish a winery 
in a place as remote as Mount Harlan.
But the region does have limestone in the soil — one of the only 
places in California that has it. According to Josh Jensen, many 
other California regions where Pinot Noir grows contain too much 
clay in their soil, which produces dull wines. Jensen, who believed 
limestone soil to be essential for Pinot Noir, founded the Calera 
Wine Company there in 1975, planting three distinct vineyards — 
Selleck, Jensen, and Reed. In 1984, Jensen added a fourth, Mills 
Vineyard, and in 1998, he added a fifth, Ryan Vineyard. (Note: 
Chalone AVA, 20 miles south of Calera Wine Company and in the 
same Gavilan Mountain range, also has limestone, but that region 
is more renowned for its Chardonnays.)
Calera Wine Company’s single-vineyard Pinot Noirs, especially 
Selleck, Jensen, and Reed, are known for their ability to age and 
improve with age. In a good vintage, they need at least 10 years of 
aging to reach their peak of development. (We’ve enjoyed some of 
Calera’s single-vineyard Pinot Noirs from the 1978 through 1984 
vintages — which were 20 years old when we drank them — and 
they still were very fine.)
 
Besides the single-vineyard wines, Jensen makes a moderately 
priced Mt. Harlan Cuvée Pinot Noir, which contains grapes from his 
various estate vineyards. He also makes a Central Coast AVA Pinot 
Noir, from purchased grapes, which retails for $21 to $24. (Mount 
Harlan is one small part of the much larger Central Coast AVA.)
In brief, here are our recommended Mount Harlan AVA Pinot Noirs, 
all from Calera Wine Company:
 
✓ Calera Mills Vineyard and Ryan Vineyard (Mount Harlan, San 
Benito County); $37 to $40
 
✓ Calera Mt. Harlan Cuvée (Mount Harlan, San Benito County); 
$29 to $30
 
✓ Calera Selleck Vineyard, Jensen Vineyard, and Reed Vineyard 
(Mount Harlan); $50 to $70

 Chapter 7: Pinot Noir 143
Los Carneros
The Los Carneros AVA, commonly known simply as Carneros, is a 
cool, windy area that stretches from southern Napa Valley to the 
southern Sonoma Coast (see Chapter 4 for a map). Winemakers 
Louis Martini and André Tchelistcheff stirred interest in Carneros 
in the 1930s when they planted Pinot Noir there.
When Carneros became an AVA in 1983, it was the first California 
AVA established on the basis of climate rather than political 
boundaries. Pacific breezes move in from San Pablo Bay, to the 
region’s south, making Carneros not only the coolest area in Napa 
Valley and one of the coolest regions in Sonoma but also the windi-
est area in both counties by far. Fog rolls into Carneros in the early 
afternoon, moderating the heat and tempering the grapes’ sugar 
levels, thereby fostering crisp acidity in the grapes. The territory 
also has thin soils and little rainfall, two prime ingredients for good 
Pinot Noir.
Carneros Creek Winery, founded by Francis Mahoney in 1973, was 
Carneros’s first winery focusing on Pinot Noir. Mike Richmond 
opened Acacia Winery and Kent Rasmussen began his self-named 
winery in Carneros in 1979. The Carneros Pinot Noir movement 
was spurred further by Dick Ward and David Graves in 1981, when 
they started Saintsbury, perhaps the iconic Carneros winery spe-
cializing in Pinot Noir today.
Currently, 37 wineries are in Carneros (almost all of which make 
Pinot Noir), and lots of wineries in other regions use Pinot Noir 
grapes from Carneros for their wines. Of the 37 wineries, over a 
dozen have earned national acclaim for their Pinot Noirs. A few 
of these — such as Domaine Carneros, Artesa (formerly Codorniu 
Napa), and Gloria Ferrer — began as sparkling wine houses.
Bouchaine Vineyards, with a long history in Carneros, is experi-
encing a revival with its Pinot Noir, now under the direction of 
winemaker/general manager Mike Richmond, formerly of Acacia. 
And Buena Vista Carneros Estate, the oldest continually operating 
winery in California (founded in 1857 by Hungarian emigrant Count 
Agoston Haraszthy), is still going strong with its Pinot Noir and 
other wines.
 
We’re not recommending any high-end (over $50) Carneros Pinot 
Noirs, because they’re invariably darker, richer, oakier wines 
rather than the lighter, more elegantly styled Carneros Pinot Noirs 
we prefer. However, we do have some picks in the moderately 
priced and moderate-plus price ranges. Here are three recom-
mended Carneros Pinot Noirs for under $20:

Part II: The Headliners  
144
 
✓ Acacia Winery, “A by Acacia” (California): This is the reli-
able second wine of the prestigious Acacia Pinot Noir of 
Carneros. “A by Acacia” is widely distributed throughout the 
U.S., and it’s a real value at $17 to $18.
 
✓ Saintsbury “Garnet” (Carneros): This wine has been an 
old friend since its first vintage, 1983. Anytime we see it on 
a restaurant wine list, we order it. It’s light, fresh, fragrant, 
and totally delicious, with lots of berry and cherry flavor. 
Unfortunately, “Garnet,” which retails for $16 to $18, sells out 
quickly each year after it’s released. Your best bet might be 
to order it directly from the winery if your state allows it (see 
Chapter 13 for more on wine shipping regulations).
 
✓ Jacuzzi Family Vineyards (Carneros): Jacuzzi Family 
Vineyards (of the same family that invented the Jacuzzi whirl-
pool bathtub) is less well known than Saintsbury — and is 
therefore more readily available. We had our first Jacuzzi Pinot 
Noir just recently and were pleasantly surprised at how good it 
is for its price ($17 to $19); it has herbal and cherry aromas and 
flavors, and it’s quite elegant and well balanced. A winner!
And here are our recommendations for moderate-plus Pinot Noirs.

Santa Barbara County
Wine production in Santa Barbara County really didn’t get going 
commercially until 1975, when Firestone Vineyards opened. By 
the early 1980s, Santa Barbara County had 13 operating wineries. 
From the beginning, Pinot Noir was a major player, especially in 
the northwest part of the county, where Santa Maria Valley is situ-
ated. Over 30 wineries are located within Santa Maria Valley, and 
another 50 wineries source grapes from this region.

 Chapter 7: Pinot Noir 145
Santa Maria Valley runs east-west, which is a great advantage 
because the cool Pacific breezes have a clear path to funnel their 
way into the Valley. Santa Maria Valley, in fact, has the coolest 
average temperature during growing season of all California wine 
regions. Because it’s so cool, the Valley’s growing season is on the 
average four weeks longer than other regions’, allowing slower 
maturation and longer hangtime for the Pinot Noir grapes.
Santa Maria Valley is the home of a great Pinot Noir site, the 
renowned Bien Nacido Vineyard. Many of Santa Barbara’s best pro-
ducers buy Pinot Noir grapes from Bien Nacido’s owners (and you 
can find a number of them in our recommended wine lists).
Southeast of Santa Maria Valley, Los Alamos Valley is on the aver-
age 10 degrees warmer. Many different varieties, including Pinot 
Noir, grow in Los Alamos.
In the southern part of Santa Barbara County, just north of the 
city of Santa Barbara, lies the huge Santa Ynez Valley, which runs 
east-west. Many varieties do well in the eastern end, which is the 
warmest part of the Santa Barbara wine region. The western end 
of Santa Ynez Valley, nearer the Pacific, is much cooler. Because of 
its obvious climatic differences from the eastern end, this part of 
Santa Ynez Valley became a separate AVA in 2001: Sta. Rita Hills. 
(We cover the Pinot Noirs of Sta. Rita Hills in our section “Hot new 
Pinot Noir regions,” later in this chapter.)
We have no Santa Barbara County wines under $20 to recommend 
and only one high-end wine.
Saintsbury: Classic Carneros Pinot Noir
Saintsbury Winery has been foremost in establishing Carneros as a fine region for 
Pinot Noir. Currently, Saintsbury is trying to bring Carneros back into the public eye 
in the face of stiff competition from places such as Sta. Rita Hills in Santa Barbara 
and Monterey’s Santa Lucia Highlands.
Saintsbury’s Pinot Noirs will never be like the powerful blockbusters coming out 
of the newer regions, and we’re grateful for that. Not that Saintsbury’s Pinots are 
wimpy — except for their least expensive Pinot Noir (the lighter-bodied “Garnet”), 
Saintsbury’s six other Pinot Noirs range from medium-bodied to quite full-bodied. 
But they’re well-balanced, elegant, and consistently Carneros in style, and they 
don’t approach the 15-percent-plus alcohol of many newer California Pinots.
Saintsbury’s flagship wine, its Carneros Estate, is the quintessential Carneros Pinot 
Noir: crisp and lively, medium-bodied, with aromas and flavors of tart cherries. It 
retails in the $28 to $32 range.

Russian River Valley
The huge Russian River Valley AVA, about 198 square miles, is in 
the central part of Sonoma County and encompasses two smaller 
AVAs, Green Valley and Chalk Hill. However, Chalk Hill, in the 
extreme northeast part of Russian River Valley, is too warm for 
Pinot Noir. Russian River Valley’s largest city is Santa Rosa, at its 
southeastern end, about 55 miles north of San Francisco; however, 
its wine center is the rapidly growing town of Healdsburg, in the 
northern part of the Valley.
Climate defines the region, particularly cooling fog from the Pacific 
Ocean, which churns through the Petaluma Wind Gap up the 
Russian River Valley. Fog typically arrives in the evening, drop-
ping temperatures 35 to 40 degrees from their daytime highs. The 
fog dissipates in the morning, allowing warm, sunny days during 
the growing season. The natural air-conditioning at night creates 
an extended growing season, up to 20 percent longer than that of 
neighboring regions, allowing the Pinot Noir grapes to develop full-
flavor maturity while retaining their natural acidity.
Depending on the location of their vineyards, Russian River Valley 
Pinot Noirs can carry either Russian River Valley or Green Valley 
AVAs on their labels. Although many of the wines we recom-
mend actually come from Green Valley grapes, the producer often 
chooses to use the better-known Russian River Valley AVA on the 
wine’s label.

 Chapter 7: Pinot Noir 147
We recommend Russian River Valley Pinot Noirs in three price cat-
egories: moderately priced, moderate-plus, and high-end.
Moderately Priced Russian River

In our picks for moderate-plus Pinot Noirs, you’ll notice that 
Dutton Ranch vineyard appears three times. Warren Dutton 
planted Pinot Noir in 1964, and today Dutton Ranch is one of 
California’s celebrated vineyards for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, 
selling its grapes to many elite wineries as well as making its own 
wines. As for other notable names, the family of the legendary 
late Joseph Swan — perhaps the first person to make great, long-
lived Russian River Valley Pinot Noirs (and Zinfandels) — makes a 
couple of wines on this list.

Anderson Valley
Anderson Valley is in Mendocino County, about 115 miles north of 
San Francisco. The Valley is in the western part of the county, just 
10 to 15 miles from the Pacific and southeast of the coastal town 
of Mendocino. Steep mountains surround the 15 mile–long Valley, 
and the Navarro River runs through it.
Anderson Valley has the coolest year-round temperatures of any 
wine region in California. Amazingly, temperatures can fall 40 to 
50 degrees at night. This temperature range enables Pinot Noir 
grapes to retain their acidity throughout the long, warm summer 
and autumn. Grapes ripen slowly and develop intense flavors. The 
westernmost part of Anderson Valley, closest to the Mendocino 
Coast, has the coolest climate, and that’s where many Pinot Noir 
vineyards are situated — close to the majestic, coastal Redwoods.

 Chapter 7: Pinot Noir 149
The modern era in Anderson Valley started in 1964 when Edmeades 
Vineyards opened, followed two years later by Husch Vineyards. In 
the 1970s, three other small wineries — Navarro Vineyards, Lazy 
Creek Vineyards, and Greenwood Ridge Vineyards — opened. But 
what really put Anderson Valley on the California wine map was the 
arrival of Champagne Louis Roederer in 1982; this great Champagne 
house decided that Anderson Valley was the ideal location to plant 
Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vineyards for its new sparkling wine 
operation, Roederer Estate (see Chapter 11 for more on sparkling 
wines). In 1983, Anderson Valley became an official AVA.
We classify Anderson Valley as a classic Pinot Noir region 
because wineries have been making Pinot Noir there for more 
than 25 years; however, you could argue that Anderson Valley is 
a hot new region because most of the Pinot Noir action there has 
taken place over the past decade or so. In 1994, only 300 acres of 
Williams Selyem: The essence 
of Russian River Valley
No California winery has won more acclaim for its Pinot Noirs than Williams Selyem 
Winery. Burt Williams and Ed Selyem were friends who shared a passion for Pinot 
Noir, and they became weekend winemakers in 1979, using a local garage as their 
first winery. They made their first commercial wine under the Hacienda del Rio 
label in 1981 and changed the name to Williams Selyem in 1983. Their 1985 Rochioli 
Vineyard Pinot Noir won top prize at the 1987 California State Fair, and Williams 
Selyem Pinot Noirs attained cult status. As time went by, Williams Selyem Pinot 
Noirs helped to establish Russian River Valley as the prime region for California 
Pinot Noir.
Burt Williams and Ed Selyem retired in 1998, selling their winery to John Dyson, 
who hired veteran winemaker Bob Cabral to handle winemaking duties. Dyson’s 
greater financial resources have allowed somewhat more Pinot Noir to be pro-
duced. Williams Selyem’s Pinot Noirs are still limited in production, but now you 
can find them in some retail stores and in restaurants. Still, the best way to get your 
hands on these wines is to get on Williams Selyem’s mailing list.
At present, Williams Selyem produces as many as 16 different Pinot Noirs, 11 
of them single-vineyard wines, all made in small lots. The five relatively larger-
production Pinot Noirs are the winery’s “Central Coast,” “Sonoma County,” 
“Sonoma Coast,” “Russian River Valley,” and “Westside Road Neighbors” (a 
blend from several top vineyards) Pinot Noirs. The 11 single-vineyard Pinot Noirs, 
including such notable wines as “Allen Vineyard,” “Hirsch Vineyard,” and “Rochioli 
Riverblock,” are mainly in Russian River Valley and the Sonoma Coast, with two 
sourced from Mendocino County.

Pinot Noir existed in Anderson Valley; by 2005, that number had 
quadrupled to 1,200 acres. What happened was that many of the 
top Pinot Noir producers — particularly from Sonoma County 
but also from Napa Valley — discovered the ideal growing condi-
tions of Anderson Valley. Some leading Pinot Noir producers that 
are now using Anderson Valley grapes include Williams Selyem, 
Littorai, Siduri, Duckhorn’s Goldeneye, La Crema, Adrian Fog, 
Roessler, and Copain.
About 25 Anderson Valley wineries make Pinot Noir, and another 
17 wineries outside of the Valley use Anderson Valley grapes for 
one or more of their Pinot Noirs. We name our recommended 
Anderson Valley Pinot Noirs in two price categories: moderate-plus 
and high-end. We found no under-$20 Pinot Noirs to recommend.

Hot new Pinot Noir regions
Three regions in California have emerged in the last decade or so 
as excellent places to grow Pinot Noir:
 
✓ Sta. Rita Hills (Santa Barbara County)
 
✓ Santa Lucia Highlands (Monterey County)
 
✓ Sonoma Coast (Sonoma County)

 Chapter 7: Pinot Noir 151
Sta. Rita Hills (Santa Barbara County)
Until 2001, the area known as Sta. Rita Hills was part of the larger 
Santa Ynez Valley AVA (or about 99 percent of it was). But Sta. Rita 
Hills, on the western end of Santa Ynez Valley, is so different in cli-
mate — on average, 15 degrees cooler in the growing season than 
the eastern end of the Valley — that common sense dictated that it 
have its own AVA.
Few commercial wineries existed in the Sta. Rita Hills until the 
1980s. Three early wineries — Clos Pepe, Sanford Winery, and 
Babcock Vineyards — led the movement to establish the Sta. Rita 
Hills AVA, which finally happened in 2001. Richard Sanford, who 
founded the region’s first Pinot Noir vineyard (Sanford & Benedict 
Vineyard) in 1971 and Sanford Winery in 1981, is perhaps the name 
most associated with Sta. Rita Hills; Sanford’s current affiliation is 
as the owner of Alma Rosa Winery and Vineyards.
 
Although the area is known as Santa Rita Hills, the official AVA 
name, which appears on wine labels, is Sta. Rita Hills, to protect 
the trademark of the Chilean winery Viña Santa Rita.
Sta. Rita Hills, one of California’s smaller AVAs, now has over 1,700 
acres planted, mainly with Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes, 
the classic cool-climate varieties. As with Santa Maria Valley (see 
“Santa Barbara County” earlier in this chapter), what makes the 
Sta. Rita Hills AVA unusual is its clear pathway of east-to-west roll-
ing hills open to the Pacific Ocean, which provides morning fog, 
cool temperatures, and strong winds. These conditions lengthen 
the growing season, limit excessive crop levels, and contribute 
flavor concentration and acidity to the grapes.
 
Even though many of the Pinot Noirs from Sta. Rita Hills are being 
made in the opulent, powerful, modern style, a few winemakers, 
such as Ojai (pronounced oh-high) Vineyard’s Adam Tolmach, con-
tinue to produce Pinots in the more traditional style. Tolmach’s 
secret is that he picks his grapes early, before they become too 
ripe and sugar-laden. He believes that Pinot Noir’s lovely perfumed 
aromas are lost when the grapes are picked late — as many wine-
makers are picking them today.
Currently, 23 wineries are located within the Sta. Rita Hills AVA, 
with another 48 wineries outside of the AVA sourcing grapes from 
this area — but both numbers are growing each year. Here, alpha-
betically within each price category, are our recommended Sta. 
Rita Hills Pinot Noirs.

Santa Lucia Highlands (Monterey County)
A decade ago, practically no one outside of Monterey County had 
ever heard of the Santa Lucia Highlands wine region. Now, thanks 
to recent acclaim for its Pinot Noirs, Santa Lucia Highlands is defi-
nitely a hot new region in California.
The Santa Lucia Highlands AVA, part of the larger Monterey 
County AVA, came into existence in 1991. The Highlands are on the 
eastern side of the Santa Lucia Mountain range, overlooking the 
Salinas River Valley, with vineyards at altitudes as high as 1,200 
feet. The AVA is south of Monterey Bay, and it runs northwest to 
southeast for 18 miles, from the town of Gonzales in the north to 
the Arroyo Seco AVA to the south. It’s only 1 mile wide.
Morning fog comes into this area from Monterey Bay, just 10 miles 
north. But especially in the higher vineyards, it burns off in time 
for plenty of early-day sunshine. Cooling ocean breezes come in 

 Chapter 7: Pinot Noir 153
Six top-value Pinot Noirs
These six Pinot Noirs, all $15 and under, are consistently reliable, and they’re our 
picks as top values:
 ✓ Blackstone Winery (Sonoma Coast)
 ✓ De Loach Vineyards, “Cote De Loach” (California)
 ✓ Hangtime Cellars (Edna Valley, San Luis Obispo)
 ✓ Jekel Vineyards (Monterey County)
 ✓ Mark West (California)
 ✓ Red Truck, Cline Cellars (California)
like clockwork through Monterey Bay every afternoon. The ocean 
fog and breezes are responsible for Santa Lucia Highlands’ having 
a Region I climate, the coolest climate zone. The average high tem-
perature in August is only in the mid-70 degrees, and nights in the 
growing season can be up to 50 degrees cooler than days, locking 
in the necessary acidity in the grapes.
The cool climate, an extremely long growing season, and ancient 
glacial soil create ideal conditions for growing the two Burgundian 
varieties, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. Chardonnay, the easier 
of the two grapes to cultivate, was the dominant variety in the 
Highlands at first, but as soon as growers discovered how and 
where to grow Pinot Noir effectively, Pinot became the darling: 
2,500 acres of it now exist.
Although Spanish missionaries planted vineyards in Santa Lucia 
Highlands in the 1790s, the area really got started as a wine region 
in the early 1970s, with the establishment of Paraiso Vineyards, 
Sleepy Hollow Vineyards (now part of Robert Talbott Winery), La 
Estancia, and Smith & Hook (now Hahn Estates–Smith & Hook) — 
all of which started as vineyards and eventually added wineries.
 
Before the 1990s, larger wineries outside of Monterey County pur-
chased most of the grapes grown in the Santa Lucia Highlands. In 
the 1990s, three vineyard owners, Gary Pisoni (Pisoni Vineyards), 
Gary Franscioni (Roar Wines), and Robert Talbott (Talbott Winery) 
began the single-vineyard movement in Santa Lucia Highlands, 
earning recognition and respect for the region.

 Chapter 7: Pinot Noir 155
Sonoma Coast AVA
The Sonoma Coast is the largest AVA in Sonoma County. Its bound-
ary runs along the Pacific Coast from the Mendocino County line 
in the north all the way down to San Pablo Bay and Marin County 
in the south — more than 500,000 acres, with about 7,000 acres 
under vine. It’s an umbrella AVA in that it encompasses a number 
of other Sonoma AVAs.
 
Brice Jones, founder of the hugely successful Sonoma-Cutrer 
Vineyards, was the force behind the creation of the Sonoma Coast 
AVA. Jones saw the need for an AVA for “cold-climate” wine pro-
ducers (like himself) who owned vineyards scattered throughout 
cool zones along the Sonoma Coast and who, until then, could not 
use the important estate-bottled term on their wines because their 
vineyards were in different AVAs than their wineries. (Chapter 3 
explains the intricacies of using the term estate-bottled.)
Although the Sonoma Coast AVA began in 1987, in many ways, it’s 
really the newest Pinot Noir region in California. Apart from the 
earliest vineyards such as Brice Jones’s, vine plantings began in a 
serious way only in the early 1990s. Today, over 50 growers have 
vineyards in the AVA (most also have wineries), and another 60 or 
more wineries from elsewhere source grapes here. Almost all this 
growth has taken place within the last two decades. Pinot Noir and 
Chardonnay are the driving force behind this growth, with Syrah 
also expanding rapidly in plantings.
Big-name wineries producing Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir include 
Kistler, Marcassin, Peter Michael, Williams Selyem, Flowers, 
Littorai, and Martinelli. And large wineries such as Kendall-Jackson 
have bought land here.
The Sonoma Coast is California’s most extreme wine region, cli-
matewise. Growing season temperatures are almost as low as pos-
sible for grapes to ripen: Daytime highs are usually in the low 70s, 
and night temperatures are in the 40s. Cool Pacific fog and winds 
coming through the Petaluma Gap (an opening in the mountains at 
Bodega Bay) are responsible for the cool temperatures. The grow-
ing season is extremely long; most of the grapes are harvested 
from mid-October to November (quite a contrast to Napa Valley, 
where harvest typically begins in August). The vineyards — which 
are generally planted high in the Sonoma Mountains to catch the 
sun — have thin, shallow, very rocky soil. The thin soil plus the 
sunshine are key assets. But the Sonoma Coast is always a chal-
lenge to growers, with cold spring seasons (common), very small 
crops (also common), and fall rains (always likely).

Part II: The Headliners  
156
 
We believe that the Sonoma Coast could eventually be regarded as 
the finest Pinot Noir region in the U.S. and perhaps the entire New 
World. The stressed vines produce meager crops of small, con-
centrated, ripe, flavorful grapes with low sugar levels. Pinot Noir 
wines made from these grapes tend to show greater complexity of 
aroma and flavor than most Pinots from other regions in the state. 
Sonoma Coast Pinot Noirs need two or three years’ longer bottle 
aging than California’s other Pinot Noirs, and our prediction is that 
they will age longer.
Because the Sonoma Coast AVA is so huge, it will probably divide 
into several smaller AVAs in the near future. The first will probably 
be Fort Ross-Seaview, in the southern coastal part of the larger area.
Here are our recommended Sonoma Coast Pinot Noirs in three

Pinot Noirs in other regions
Good Pinot Noirs exist in various regions of California other than 
the renowned Pinot Noir regions that we highlight earlier in this

Actually, Marin County’s very cool climate is very much like that of 
Sonoma Coast.

Zinfandel
In This Chapter
▶ The red and the redder of Zinfandel’s history
▶ The flavor, character, and styles of Zinfandel
▶ Our recommended red Zinfandel wines
W
hen we look back on all the Zinfandel wines that we’ve 
tasted, the two thoughts that come to mind — besides 
serious drinking satisfaction, of course — are fun and adventure: 
adventure, because the quest to discover the finest Zinfandel pro-
ducers and their best vineyards has taken us to amazing patches of 
ancient gnarly vines all over the state; and fun because . . . well, fun 
just seems to be part of Zinfandel’s nature. Something about this 
spicy, flavorful red wine brings a smile to wine drinkers’ faces. We 
remember organizing a comprehensive wine-tasting of Zinfandels 
once and giving every taster a large, bright purple pin that read, 
“Commit Zinfandelity with someone you love!” We can’t imagine 
ever being so playful over a bunch of Cabernet Sauvignons!
Zinfandel today has two faces: the dark, flavorful red wine that 
it’s always been and the slightly sweet, flavorful pink wine that 
for over two decades was the second most popular varietal wine 
in the U.S. after Chardonnay. We cover the Zinfandel grape and 
red Zinfandel wines in this chapter, and we cover the pink White 
Zinfandel wines in Chapter 11.
Tracing California’s (Almost) 
Native Grape
In the mid-1800s, Zinfandel vines came to California with Gold Rush 
emigrants from the East Coast, where a nurseryman named George 
Gibbs had imported that vine from Europe in approximately 1829. 

Part II: The Headliners  
160
Zinfandel adapted so well to California’s terrain that it quickly 
became a favorite grape and occupied prime vineyards in the state. 
It also occupied less-favorable sites, where it produced grapes 
for inexpensive blended red wines. Grape growers prized the 
Zinfandel grape particularly for its ability to produce large crops, 
but the wines made from those grapes, presumably those from 
grapes in prime locations, were also prized. During Prohibition, 
Zinfandel grapes were a popular choice among home winemakers.
In the modern era of varietal wines, however, Zinfandel became a 
more marginalized grape as growers began cultivating Cabernet 
Sauvignon and other classic grapes of French origin. Some wine-
makers treasured the old Zinfandel vineyards that produced small 
crops of flavorful, concentrated grapes, but other Zinfandel vine-
yards fell out of favor. In the 1970s, Zinfandel production was in 
serious decline.
At this point, the storyline of Zinfandel forks off in two directions. 
One is the road of the original (red) Zinfandel wine, and the other 
is the road of White Zinfandel, the sweet pink wine. In 1975, Sutter 
Home Winery inadvertently made the first “White Zinfandel” when 
the fermentation of a dry pink Zinfandel wine stopped of its own 
accord, leaving residual sugar in the wine. That style went on to 
became hugely popular. In 2005, White Zin outsold red Zin 6.5 to 1.
The road less traveled is that of red Zinfandel. This wine had two 
things going in its favor: One was the quality of wines from grapes 
grown in good sites, and the other was the mystery that sur-
rounded the grape’s origins. Although wine experts knew Zinfandel 
wasn’t a native American grape, they considered the wine uniquely 
American because the grape didn’t seem to exist elsewhere in 
the world. The idea that the Zinfandel grape was an orphan that 
America could claim as her own gave the wines a special aura that 
enhanced their popularity. Even today, wine columnists recom-
mend Zinfandel for Thanksgiving because the wine is so identified 
with America in spirit.
DNA testing solved the mystery of Zinfandel’s heritage. In the 
early 1970s, scientists determined that Zinfandel is the same as 
Primitivo, a grape grown in the Apulia region of Southern Italy. 
In 1993, genetic testing showed that these two varieties are both 
clones of another variety, identity then unknown but related to 
a Croatian grape called Plavac Mali. In 2001, scientists deter-
mined that Zinfandel and Primitivo are both the same as Crljenak 
Kaštelanski (soorl-yen-ak kash-tel-ahn-ski), a red grape from coastal 
Croatia.

 Chapter 8: Zinfandel 161
U.S. regulations recognize Primitivo as a synonym for Zinfandel, 
and some California wines are named Primitivo. Meanwhile, some 
producers of Primitivo in Italy have begun calling their wines 
Zinfandel. And would you believe it? No one at all seems to be call-
ing the wine Crljenak Kaštelanski!
What’s Special about Zinfandel
The Zinfandel vine is California’s third most important, after 
Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon, in terms of the quantity of 
grapes grown. Cabernet ranks higher than Zinfandel by only a frac-
tion of a percentage point.
Red wines from the Zinfandel grape boast a unique combination of 
ripe berry flavors that give an impression of sweet fruitiness and 
a firm, dry texture that gives a spicy energy to play against that 
sweet fruitiness. The wines have plenty of flavor, but their appeal 
isn’t just flavor: They balance that flavor with firm structure and a 
sturdy character that make the wines particularly satisfying.
Zinfandel wines are typically said to have flavors of bramble 
berries — berries from plants that contain thorns, such as black-
berries and loganberries. They often have a distinctive spicy 
black-pepper note as well, which usually comes from blending in 
some Petite Sirah (read about Petite Sirah in Chapter 10). Some 
winemakers ascribe a chocolate note to Zinfandel’s taste.
 
Compared to Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot wines, Zinfandel wines 
are generally fruitier and more flavorful, and they have a personal-
ity that’s slightly wild and untamed — the opposite of sedate and 
proper. Compared to Pinot Noir wines, Zins are less seductive in 
their fruity aromas and flavors, and they’re leaner in structure, 
giving less of an impression of “roundness” in your mouth. If we 
had to pick a type of California wine that Zinfandel most resem-
bles, we’d say Petite Sirah — although Zinfandel wines are far more 
available and more varied than Petite Sirah wines.
In describing what’s special about Zinfandel, we have to men-
tion the fun-loving attitude that the wine seems to invoke and the 
passion and commitment that many winemakers feel toward this 
grape and its wines.
Naturally, Zinfandel has an advocacy organization, because 
almost every unusual wine type in California seems to have one. 
Zinfandel’s is called ZAP, which stands for Zinfandel Advocates 

Part II: The Headliners  
162
and Producers (www.zinfandel.org). To its credit, ZAP, founded 
in 1991, was probably the original such group. Each January, ZAP 
organizes a huge Zinfandel wine-tasting event in San Francisco, 
drawing thousands of fans.
The Spectrum of Zin Styles
Although Zinfandel is truly delicious and compelling, its following 
isn’t huge. Some winemakers theorize that what holds Zinfandel 
back from broader sales is that when you buy a bottle, you can’t 
be sure which style you’re going to get. That’s because Zinfandel 
wines cover a range of styles, from lean and relatively restrained 
to rich and opulent and high in alcohol, resembling Portugal’s 
Port wines. (Port is an alcohol-added dessert wine; we mention 
California’s Port-style wines in Chapter 11.)
Many factors contribute to this diversity of style, including the 
usual suspects — winemaking techniques and climate differences 
in the vineyards — as well as Zinfandel’s special issue of vine age. 
The old vineyards produce small crops of flavorful, concentrated 
grapes, so Zinfandels made from old vines taste more concentrated 
and less fruity than other Zins.
 
The Zinfandel grapevine has a few built-in issues that winemakers 
must deal with, each in his or her own way, and their methods can 
affect the style of the wine. These issues include the following:
 
✓ Susceptibility to rot: Zinfandel bunches are compact and the 
berries are thin-skinned, setting the stage for rot. Fortunately, 
that’s not a serious issue in California except in rainy 
autumns.
 
✓ Uneven ripening: A more critical issue is that some berries 
on a bunch get nice and ripe while others remain unripe and 
some are overripe. Without careful vineyard management, the 
wine can have unripe flavors and overripe flavors at the same 
time.
 
✓ Shrivelling: After Zinfandel berries ripen, they quickly shrivel 
and lose their acidity, which results in huge, blousy (sloppy 
and unkempt) wines with overripe, jammy fruit flavors.
 
Wine lovers used to speak of claret-style Zins, which were leaner, 
trimmer, dry wines somewhat in the style of Cabernet Sauvignon. 
(Claret is the term that the British traditionally use for Cabernet-
dominant wines from Bordeaux, France.) Today, the wave of super-
ripeness that has swept through California’s red-grape vineyards 

 Chapter 8: Zinfandel 163
has brought Zinfandel wines that are richer and fuller than ever, 
and few truly claret-style Zins exist. Nevertheless, some Zinfandel 
wines today are dry and are relatively trim and lean in style. 
Examples include Green and Red Vineyard, A. Rafanelli, Nalle, 
Frog’s Leap, and The Terraces.
Many Zinfandel wines today are made from extremely ripe grapes 
and are therefore very ripe, sweet, and high in alcohol, containing 
more than 16 percent alcohol in many cases. Often these wines 
have Port-like flavors of sun-baked fruit and raisins. Wine literature 
sometimes refers to the most extreme wines in this style as late 
harvest Zins.
And many Zins occupy the middle ground: They’re medium- to 
full-bodied wines that have perceptible sweetness but technically 
qualify as dry, with firm tannin and exuberant but not excessive 
fruity flavor.
 
In choosing a Zinfandel, pay particular attention to the alcohol 
level that’s listed on the label. The higher the alcohol, the higher 
the odds that the wine will be sweet, jammy, and powerfully rich. 
That’s not our cup of tea, but it might be just what you’re looking 
for — and many Zin fanatics will agree with you.
Zinfandel Country
Zinfandel grows all over California, and the style of the wine varies 
according to the wine region and the specific location of the vine-
yard, as well as the age of the vines for any particular wine. In gen-
eral, the following holds true:
 
✓ The cooler areas, which include many of the coastal counties, 
tend to produce spicier, leaner, and more refined wines.
 
✓ The interior regions tend to make richer, lustier, more power-
ful Zinfandel wines.
The Central Valley is responsible for a big chunk of Zinfandel pro-
duction, but most of those grapes make White Zinfandel or go into 
inexpensive blended red wines. Other areas — specific AVAs and 
certain counties of the state — specialize in growing the grapes 
for red Zinfandel wines, or they boast specific wineries that are 
renowned as Zinfandel specialists.
Specialist Zinfandel wineries often source grapes from vineyards 
in several different AVAs and make several vineyard-specific 
wines. One example is Ravenswood, which makes five Zins under 

Part II: The Headliners  
164
single-county appellations (Sonoma, Napa, Lodi, Amador, and 
Mendocino) and eight single-vineyard Zinfandels in addition to 
producing a large quantity of “Vintners Blend” Zinfandel under the 
California state appellation. Another example is Rosenblum Cellars, 
which makes a California-appellation “Vintner’s Cuvée” Zinfandel 
and 18 or more additional Zins under specific AVAs, reserve labels, 
or single-vineyard-designated labels.
 
Here are some specifics about Zinfandel acreage around the state:
 
✓ The counties that comprise the Central Valley region grow 
more than 60 percent of all the Zinfandel in California, much 
of it destined for White Zinfandel. San Joaquin County alone 
accounts for about 40 percent of all Zinfandel acreage, but 
included in that county is part of the Lodi AVA, which does 
produce a large amount of red varietal Zinfandel wine.
 
✓ Sonoma County (which includes the key Dry Creek Valley 
AVA), with about 10 percent of all Zinfandel acreage, is the 
leading coastal county for Zinfandel.
 
✓ San Luis Obispo County, which includes the Paso Robles AVA, 
accounts for about 4 percent of Zinfandel acreage.
 
✓ Napa, Mendocino, and Amador Counties, all known for their 
Zinfandels, each grow about 3.5 percent of the state’s Zin 
crop. Amador is a warmer interior area.
Visiting Northern Sonoma
Northern Sonoma is downright vast, with more than one major hub and attractions 
branched off in virtually every direction. That said, each area does have its own 
distinct flavor and instant access to specific attractions, so read up and decide 
what works best for you.
The Russian River Valley wine region is home to the funky riverside town of 
Guerneville. Though it’s a good 20 minutes west of the Highway 101 thoroughfare, 
it does offer relatively easy access to the region’s wineries. However, this town 
of around 2,600 residents, which was explored by the Russians in the 1840s and 
became one of the busiest logging centers in the West in the 1880s, is now known 
for its casual cabin-like resort communities flanking the Russian River and its sum-
mertime popularity among the gay and lesbian community. Here, you can spend 
your days idling on inner tubes, canoeing, car camping, or hiking redwood trails. 
Accommodations tend to be old and funky, like the town and homes around it, but 
the relaxed summertime feel is pure old-fashioned fun. That said, if it’s the ultimate 
wine country vibe you’re after, you won’t find it here, except for at the town’s east-
ern entrance, which is home to Korbel Champagne Cellars.

 Chapter 8: Zinfandel 165
The Dry Creek Valley AVA in Northern Sonoma is a major region 
for Zinfandel, known for making fine Zins that are firm and struc-
tured. Other key Sonoma County AVAs for Zinfandel include 
Russian River Valley, Alexander Valley, and Sonoma Valley. 
Generally speaking, these areas make spicy Zinfandels with black 
pepper, blackberry, and black cherry aromas and flavors.
 
To find out about the characteristics of Zinfandels from various 
growing areas, consult the Resource Guide to Zinfandel available at 
www.zinfandel.org from ZAP. The descriptions tend to focus on the 
aromas and flavors of the wines from each area instead of describ-
ing the wines’ weight, structure, alcohol levels, and so forth, but 
the array of descriptors will make your mouth water and perhaps 
inspire you to begin some firsthand research.
North of the Russian River area is the greatly heralded wine region known as Dry 
Creek as well as the undisputed hub of Northern Sonoma wine country, the town 
of Healdsburg. A mere 30- to 45-minute drive from either Napa or Sonoma Valley 
(and 11/2 hours from San Francisco) and just north of burgeoning suburban Santa 
Rosa, its centerpiece historic square, which has been the heart of the town since 
its inception in 1857, captures the quaint shopping and dining experiences of down-
town Sonoma’s plaza (only better in both areas). Its rural roads and country B&Bs 
have the same genuine backcountry appeal as its surrounding wineries, while the 
abundance of Victorian architecture gives it a bit of old-world charm. Adding to its 
intrinsic allure, Healdsburg is surrounded by all the premier viticultural areas, allow-
ing easy access to Russian River, Dry Creek, Alexander Valley, and Chalk Hill.
Recently, Healdsburg has become a bona fide alternative to Napa Valley highlife 
due to the arrival of a few very sophisticated restaurants and hotels. (The wine 
scene here was already exceptional.) One hot culinary outpost is the Zinfandel-
themed Zin Restaurant & Wine Bar (344 Center St., Healdsburg; phone 707-473-
0946; Web site www.zinrestaurant.com). Locals and visitors flock to this downtown 
eatery, where talented, innovative young chefs fuse big-city ideas with country-
comfort dishes. The seasonal menu does the wine country norm, pairing a top-
notch wine list with local foods and produce. You’ll have plenty of choices when 
you get to their exceptional Dry Creek, Russian River, and Alexander Valley focused 
wine list (15 to 17 picks by the glass, around 100 by the bottle).
Northern Sonoma doesn’t have one major convention and visitors bureau repre-
senting the entire region. Fortunately, if you visit www.sonoma.com, it will direct 
you to the various visitors bureaus. Or if you roll into downtown Healdsburg off 
of Highway 101, you’ll pass the Healdsburg Chamber of Commerce and Visitors 
Bureau (217 Healdsburg Ave., Healdsburg; phone 800-648-9922 or 707-433-6935; 
Web site www.healdsburg.com).

The four Rs of Zinfandel
Four wineries are head of the class in red Zinfandel renown, and coincidentally, all 
their names begin with the letter r. Here’s another thing all four have in common: 
Almost all their Zinfandels come from Sonoma County. Here are the wineries in 
alphabetical order:
 ✓ A. Rafanelli: Rafanelli’s Winery is in Dry Creek Valley, and all David Rafanelli’s 
Zinfandels — intensely flavored with great balance — are textbook examples 
of Dry Creek Zinfandel at its best.
 ✓ Ravenswood: Joel Peterson of Ravenswood, whose winery is in Sonoma Valley, 
makes about eight single-vineyard Zins, all but one from vineyards in Sonoma.
 ✓ Ridge Vineyards: Paul Draper of Ridge Vineyards makes one of the most 
famous Zinfandel-based wines of all, Geyserville. (Technically it can’t be called 
Zinfandel because it’s a blend of what grows in the Geyserville vineyard — 
about 70 percent Zinfandel along with Carignane, Petite Sirah, and Mataro/
Mourvedre.) Apart from Geyserville, Ridge also makes about seven wines actu-
ally labeled as Zinfandel.
 ✓ Rosenblum Cellars: Kent Rosenblum, a former veterinarian, makes about 19 
single-vineyard Zinfandels from all over California in any given vintage, but his 
best Zins come from Sonoma.

f you enjoy a change of pace now and then, or if you 
like to be the fi rst in your crowd to taste what’s new 
and different, the dozens of types of wines that we profi le 
in this part are right up your alley. They include varietal 
white wines such as Pinot Grigio/Pinot Gris (which is 
unusual for California, at least), Viognier, Pinot Blanc, 
Chenin Blanc, Riesling, Gewurztraminer, and more, as 
well as blended California white wines from the likes of 
Marsanne, Roussanne, and other grapes. The red wines 
we cover include Syrah, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Franc, 
Tempranillo, all sorts of “Cal-Ital” wines from Italian grape 
varieties, and Rhône-style blends, among other wines. 
And that’s just in the fi rst two chapters!
Later in this part, you can read about California’s world-
class sparkling wines, its new dry rosé wines, its wildly 
popular sweet pink wines such as White Zinfandel, and its 
rich and exotic sweet dessert wines.

F
or as long as we can remember, winemakers in California 
have talked about which white wine could have the potential 
to rival Chardonnay as a hugely popular choice, apart from 
Sauvignon Blanc. They’re still speculating. But now a new prospect 
is on the horizon: the Pinot Gris grape, which makes varietal wines 
called Pinot Gris or, more frequently in California, Pinot Grigio. 
Of course, whether that wine will become a real star is up to 
wine drinkers. In this chapter, we tell you what to expect when 
you reach for a California Pinot Grigio/Gris.
Every other white grape in California is, frankly, an also-ran — 
but that doesn’t mean that your choices of California white wines 
are nil. In most markets, you can find delicious Viognier wines, 
and with a bit of effort, you can try a Marsanne or Roussanne — 
all three being white varieties from France’s Rhône Valley. And we 
have a few personal favorites among California’s Chenin Blanc, 
Riesling, Pinot Blanc, and Gewurztraminer wines that we’re 
eager to name. Join us as we explore the exotic side of California 
white wines.
Here a Grigio, There a Gris
The Pinot Gris grape came into existence as a mutation of the red 
Pinot Noir grape (Chapter 7 has details of California Pinot Noirs). It 

Part III: More Reds, Whites, Pinks and Bubblies 
174
grows all over the world — in France, Italy, Germany, Austria, and 
several Eastern European countries, as well as many New World 
wine regions. Its white wines vary greatly in style, depending on 
the region of production and the style the winemaker is aiming for.
According to expert consensus, the Alsace region of France makes 
the world’s best Pinot Gris wines; however, the northeastern 
regions of Italy make the world’s most popular wines from this 
grape, and these are called Pinot Grigio (grigio means “gray” in 
Italian, and gris means the same in French). The grape has other 
names in Germany, Hungary, and other countries.
 
The grape’s name is “gray Pinot” because the grape skins are 
closer in color to those of black (red) grapes than to the skins of 
most white grapes.
In America, both names — Pinot Gris and Pinot Grigio — are in 
use. In Oregon, where this grape is the state’s leading white 
grape variety, Pinot Gris is invariably the name. In California, 
Pinot Grigio is more common. (We use either term for the wine, 
depending on the name the winery uses, but we use Pinot Gris 
as the grape name.)
The California face of 
Italy’s leading white
Most wine drinkers in America have heard of Pinot Grigio because 
Pinot Grigio from Italy is the number one type of imported white 
wine in the U.S. Because of the popularity of the Italian version, 
Pinot Grigio in general — including both imported and domestic 
wines, but mainly imported — is the number two best-selling type 
of white wine in the U.S., after Chardonnay.
Given the name recognition of Pinot Grigio and the huge success 
of Italian Pinot Grigio wines, most California winemakers naturally 
choose that name for their wines made from the Pinot Gris 
grape. The success of Italy’s Pinot Grigios, in fact, is probably the 
inspiration for the dramatic increase in Pinot Gris vineyards across 
California: Since 1999, the state’s acreage of Pinot Gris vines has 
more than quadrupled.
 
What’s dramatic about Pinot Gris in California today is not the 
quantity of vineyards or wine that exists but how fast that quantity 
is growing. Pinot Gris actually ranks only fifth among white wine 
grapes in California, after Chardonnay, French Colombard (used 
for inexpensive wines and for blending), Sauvignon Blanc, and 
Chenin Blanc (which we cover later in this chapter). Because the 

 Chapter 9: Pinot Grigio, Rhône-Style Whites, and Other Whites 175
acreage of Chenin Blanc is static and that of Pinot Gris has grown 
at an average rate of 12 percent per year for the past five years, 
Pinot Gris is poised to overtake Chenin Blanc in the number four 
slot very soon. In comparison to Sauvignon Blanc, California’s 
third most planted white variety (and second most important 
grape for varietal wine), only 60 percent as much Pinot Gris 
acreage exists — but Pinot Gris is increasing in acreage at a much 
faster pace than Sauvignon Blanc is. No wonder, then, that Pinot 
Gris is the rising star of California white wine.
Because California’s commitment to growing Pinot Gris is so 
recent, a track record regarding which regions are most suited to 
this grape doesn’t exist. Currently, Pinot Gris is growing mainly in 
the following areas:
 
✓ The Central Valley: Approximately half of all the state’s 
acreage is in the warm, interior counties of Sacramento, San 
Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Madera, Fresno, and Tulare. 
This is also where the largest increase in Pinot Gris plantings 
has occurred.
 
✓ The Central Coast: Approximately another quarter of the 
state’s plantings are in the cool Central Coast area.
 
✓ The North Coast: This area has less than 10 percent of the 
state acreage, with more than half that amount in Sonoma 
County.
Warm climates aren’t ideal for growing Pinot Gris because the 
grape’s acidity can drop too far, resulting in heavy wines that 
aren’t refreshing. However, the large-scale vineyards of the warm 
Central Valley can grow grapes more economically than other 
vineyard areas, and low price is key for wines that hope to com-
pete with Italy’s inexpensive Pinot Grigios. Most of the Pinot Grigio 
wines from these warm areas carry the simple California appella-
tion. More distinctive Pinot Grigio/Gris wines carry appellations 
such as Napa Valley, Russian River Valley, or Sonoma County.
The taste of California 
Pinot Grigio/Gris
Theoretically, the name Pinot Gris suggests a wine made in the 
richer style of Alsace’s Pinot Gris wines, and the name Pinot Grigio 
suggests a wine made in the lighter-bodied, less flavorful style of 
Italian Pinot Grigio wines. But in practice, this distinction doesn’t 
always hold true. When you buy a bottle of California Pinot Gris or 
Pinot Grigio, you can’t be sure from the name alone which style the 
wine will be.

Part III: More Reds, Whites, Pinks and Bubblies 
176
 
Generally speaking, the lower the price of a California Pinot Grigio/
Gris, the more likely it is to fall into the lighter style.
Lighter style
The lighter style — the Pinot Grigio style, whatever the wine’s 
name — is the dominant style in California. Most of the Pinot 
Grigio/Gris wines that carry the statewide California appellation 
are in this style.
These wines are medium-bodied and fairly pale in color, and 
they have no smoky or toasty aromas and flavors because the 
winemakers use no oak in producing the wine. Although Italian 
Pinot Grigios are usually dry and very crisp, the California versions 
tend to be fairly soft with a slightly rich texture, and they generally 
aren’t bone dry. The aromas and flavors of these wines are fruitier 
than you find in most Italian versions, but they usually don’t 
suggest any particular fruit, except perhaps a very vague apple, 
pear, or lemon note. In some wines, the aromas are neutral — they 
smell mainly like wine.
Some winemakers use oak chips in their inexpensive Pinot Grigio 
wines to give a slight vanilla or confectionery note to the wine. And 
sometimes the wine feels a little prickly on your tongue because 
the winemakers trap a slight amount of carbon dioxide inside. But 
Twelve top-value Pinot Grigio/Gris wines
These 12 Pinot Grigios/Gris, all under $12 and all with a California AVA, are consis-
tently reliable, and they’re our picks as top values for the money:

Pinot Grigio
 ✓ Turning Leaf “Reserve” Pinot 
Grigio
 ✓ White Truck Pinot Grigio
 ✓ Woodbridge Pinot Grigio

 Chapter 9: Pinot Grigio, Rhône-Style Whites, and Other Whites 177
generally, the wines are fairly soft, ever-so-slightly sweet, easy-to-
drink whites that go well with food because they don’t have a lot of 
flavor that might compete with the food.
Richer style
The richer style of wine — the Pinot Gris style, whatever the wine 
is actually called — is fuller in body and richer in texture. It’s more 
substantial and more flavorful than the lighter style. The wines’ 
aromas and flavors can include apple, peach, orange, or pear, and 
the flavors and scents are easier to detect than in wines of the 
lighter style. The wines generally don’t have any smoky, toasty, or 
spicy flavors from oak. In sweetness, these wines can be dry or 
slightly off-dry. Ferrari-Carano Pinot Grigio and J Wine Company 
Pinot Gris, both from Russian River Valley, are examples of this

White Wines from Rhône Varieties
Just as some California winemakers are crazy about red wines 
made from grape varieties native to France’s Rhône Valley (read 
about these reds in Chapter 10), white wines inspired by the same 
French region have a special following among winemakers and 
wine lovers. Sometimes these wines are varietal wines, made from 
a dominant Rhône Valley grape variety, and sometimes they’re 
blends of several varieties.
The Rhone Rangers group, the promotional body for both white 
and red American wines made from Rhône Valley varieties, lists 
ten white grape varieties that grow in America, but six of them 
have fewer than 50 acres of vines in California and are definitely 
inconsequential at this point. (Just for the record, these varieties 
are Bourboulenc, Clairette Blanc, Picardin, Picpoul, Ugni Blanc, 
and the finest variety of Muscat, known as Muscat Blanc à Petits 
Grains, which makes sweet wines.) The four more important white 
Rhône Valley varieties are
 
✓ Viognier (pronounced vee-oh-nyay)
 
✓ Roussanne
 
✓ Marsanne
 
✓ Grenache Blanc
These grapes make delicious and unusual wines from California 
that are real changes of pace from Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, 
and Pinot Grigio/Gris.
Viognier comes into its own
Viognier’s production was once limited to a small area in the northern Rhône Valley 
of France, but in the past 20 years, it has increased significantly not only in France 
but also in California and elsewhere. Now Viognier wine is well enough known, and 
respected enough, that it commands its own category in many wine judgings 
instead of being grouped in the “other whites” category. Viognier’s California 
acreage is small, however: less than one-third that of Pinot Gris and less than 3 
percent that of Chardonnay. Because Viognier wine is so distinctive, you can often 
find Viognier wines on wine lists of top-quality restaurants.
As small as Viognier is in production (it grew on 2,773 acres statewide in 2007), it 
eclipses Roussanne, Grenache Blanc, and Marsanne, which claimed only 268, 111, 
and 84 acres respectively that year.

 Chapter 9: Pinot Grigio, Rhône-Style Whites, and Other Whites 179
The four grape varieties differ somewhat in the regions in which 
they grow. More than half of California’s Viognier vineyards are 
situated in warm interior areas; however, cool coastal areas such 
as Monterey, Santa Barbara, Sonoma, Mendocino, and Napa 
Counties are also key players, accounting for almost one-third of 
Viognier vineyards. Grenache Blanc grows mainly in warm interior 
counties. Both Roussanne and Marsanne grow mainly in coastal 
regions; Monterey alone claims more than 25 percent of the state’s 
acreage of Roussanne.
The taste of white Rhône 
varietals and blends
Among the big four Rhône whites, the grape variety whose wine 
is the most different from the others in taste is Viognier. Writers 
frequently describe Viognier wines as “exotic.” This white grape is 
rich in aroma and flavor, particularly floral notes and fruity notes 
such as apricot and peach, along with tropical fruit, apple, and 
(depending on where it grows) an earthy mineral note.
Viognier makes fairly full-bodied white wines that are soft in tex-
ture because their acidity is low, but they’re high in alcohol. 
Generally, these wines are not oaky. Some producers do use oak 
in making the wine, but the oaked wines generally don’t taste 
particularly smoky or toasty from the oak.
Here’s how the other white Rhône varietal wines stack up:
 
✓ Grenache Blanc: Grenache Blanc is similar to Viognier in 
that it’s a high-alcohol, full-bodied wine, but its aromas 
and flavors, generally described as green apple, are far less 
pronounced and exotic than Viognier’s.
 
✓ Marsanne: This is a full-bodied wine that can have complex, 
delicate aromas and flavors of citrus fruits and flowers, but 
it’s often simple instead.
 
✓ Roussanne: Roussanne wines have aromas and flavors that 
suggest lemon peel, ripe pear, or mineral notes. They’re 
full-bodied and high in alcohol but also high in acidity. Some 
Roussanne wines are oaked, and some have noticeable 
sweetness.
Blends of Marsanne and Roussanne in nearly equal proportions 
are common in the Northern Rhône Valley, and such blends 
exist in California as well. In California, however, blends often 
combine Viognier with these two varieties, making a more 
flavorful wine. Grenache Blanc also figures in some white blended 
Rhône-style wines.

More California White Wines
The white wines that we group in this section — Riesling, 
Gewurztraminer, Chenin Blanc, and Pinot Blanc — are all made 
from world-famous grape varieties, but they’re not among 
California’s most important varietal wines. California does in fact 
make some excellent wines from these varieties, but these wines 
are specialties that some good producers focus on rather than 
wines to seek out from dozens of wineries.
 
Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Chenin Blanc, and Pinot Blanc not only 
vary a lot in style from one another but also vary within a variety 
from one producer to the next. Cookie-cutter they are not! To 
understand the style of a wine that you’re considering buying, 
ask your wine merchant about the use of oak and the degree of 
sweetness in the wine. And have an adventuresome spirit — you 
could very well discover your new favorite wine.

Part III: More Reds, Whites, Pinks and Bubblies 
182
Riesling
On the world stage, Riesling is much more renowned than 
Gewurztraminer, Chenin Blanc, or Pinot Blanc. It makes Germany’s 
most prestigious wines and also excels in France’s Alsace region, 
Austria, parts of Australia, parts of the U.S. (such as upstate New 
York), and elsewhere. It was once far more popular in California 
than it is now; its acreage slipped from 11,000 about 25 years ago 
to less than 2,900 today.
Riesling wines rely on the high acidity that cool climate regions 
endow to give them backbone and to balance any sweetness they 
might have. (Riesling can be completely dry but is often somewhat 
sweet.) Not many regions of California are naturally gifted in that 
regard. However, plantings of Riesling are increasing slowly but 
steadily again in California.
California’s Riesling wines have fairly pronounced and complex 
aromas and flavors that can include fruity notes (citrus, peach, and 
apple) as well as floral and sometimes mineral accents. The wines 
are flavorful and usually not bone dry, even when they’re labeled 
as dry Riesling. They’re unoaked and go very well with food.
Our favorite producers, whose wines are on the dry side, include 
Smith Madrone, Trefethen, Stony Hill (Napa Valley); Greenwood 
Ridge (Mendocino Ridge); Handley (Mendocino County); Chateau 
St. Jean (Sonoma); Gainey (Santa Ynez Valley); and Claiborne & 
Churchill (Central Coast). Fetzer and Kendall-Jackson make 
best-selling Rieslings with more sweetness, and Ventana Vineyards 
produces an award-winning Riesling.
Gewurztraminer
Gewurztraminer is a niche grape. Its wines excel in the northern 
Italian province of Alto Adige, where it originated, and in the 
Alsace region of France. This grape makes exotic wines that will 
probably never be truly mainstream. Yet when they’re good, 
they’re very, very good — including a few California examples.
These wines are full-bodied and flavorful, with typical aromas and 
flavors of roses and lychee fruit; they’re also fairly soft in texture 
and aren’t oaky. Inexpensive versions are somewhat sweet, but the 
finest wines are dry. Look for Lazy Creek, Londer, Handley, 
Navarro (all from Anderson Valley); Gundlach Bundschu (Sonoma 
Valley); and Bargetto (Monterey).

 Chapter 9: Pinot Grigio, Rhône-Style Whites, and Other Whites 183
Chenin Blanc
Chenin Blanc grows in France’s Loire Valley, where it makes 
compelling dry and sweet wines under regional names, and 
it’s also a staple in South Africa. In California, its acreage is 
substantial — similar to that of Pinot Gris and almost quadruple 
that of Riesling. But you don’t see many varietal Chenin Blancs 
from the Golden State because the grape grows mainly in the 
warm interior at high crop levels (which strips the grapes of their 
character) to make inexpensive white wine blends. However, the 
Clarksburg AVA, in the northern part of the Central Valley, is 
emerging as a special area for varietal Chenin Blanc wines.
Good Chenin Blanc wines have an unusual combination of rich 
texture and high acidity, and they’re not oaky. Their flavors are 
subtle, suggesting melon, grapefruit, or lanolin. Often the wines are 
slightly sweet, and they’re usually medium-bodied. Recommended 
producers include Dry Creek Vineyards (Clarksburg); Chappellet 
(Napa Valley); and Husch (Mendocino).
Pinot Blanc
Pinot Blanc makes good varietal wines in Alsace and northern Italy, 
but it remains a fairly unsung variety. In California, most of the 
Pinot Blanc grapes go into sparkling wine (see Chapter 11), but a 
few wineries make varietal Pinot Blanc wines that we admire.
Neutral is a common aroma/flavor descriptor for Pinot Blanc wines, 
but that term doesn’t do justice to the best wines, which have tart 
lemon or green apple notes and sometimes a mineral character. 
They can be fairly full-bodied and are sometimes slightly oaky. 
They’re usually dry. Brands to look for include Laetitia (Arroyo 
Grande Valley); Robert Foley, Robert Sinskey (both from Napa); 
Chalone, Graff Family (both from Chalone AVA); and Alma Rosa 
(Sta. Rita Hills).

W
hen we dine in a restaurant, our favorite section of the 
California wine list is Other Reds. Not that we have any-
thing against Cabernet, Merlot, Pinot Noir, and Zinfandel. But the 
Other Reds arena is always full of discoveries and surprises, not to 
mention some welcome changes of pace from the standard red 
wines. This is the section where we find those Syrah-Grenache 
blends made in the style of France’s Rhône Valley wines, those 
Cal-Ital wines from Italian grape varieties, and an occasional 
Tempranillo (Spain’s number one red grape) or Cabernet Franc. 
And of course, this category also boasts Petite Sirah — a wine from 
a grape variety whose true identity for years was as mysterious as 
what happened to Tony Soprano when the television screen went 
black at the end of The Sopranos’ six-season run.
This chapter is our Other Reds list. We hope that it brings you 
discoveries, surprises, and lots of great drinking!
California Syrah Comes of Age
If we could have plucked any one type of wine from the Other Reds 
category and given it a chapter of its own, it would be Syrah. Syrah 

Part III: More Reds, Whites, Pinks and Bubblies 
186
is one of the world’s most celebrated red grape varieties. It makes 
truly great wines in France’s Rhône Valley (where the wines have 
place names such as Hermitage and Côte Rôtie), Australia (where 
it goes by the name of Shiraz), and elsewhere, as well as plenty of 
inexpensive wines for everyday drinking.
But in California wine circles, Syrah has been something of a 
fringe-dweller until fairly recently, and so we cover it here, with 
the Other Reds. Another reason for not giving Syrah its own 
spotlight is that the Syrah grape makes blended wines in California 
at least as much as it does varietal wines. We cover the blended 
wines in the section “California’s Red Rhône-Style Blends,” later in 
this chapter.
Number five in production 
but growing
In 2007, Syrah ranked fifth among red wine grapes in California in 
terms of the quantity harvested, trailing Cabernet Sauvignon, 
Zinfandel (much of which becomes pink wine, not red), Merlot, 
and Rubired (a grape variety that has dark juice, unlike most red 
grapes; winemakers use it to enhance the color of their red wines). 
About 40 percent more Syrah than Pinot Noir exists in California’s 
vineyards, but Pinot Noir grapes, being in more demand, command 
more than triple the price per ton when wineries buy them from 
grape growers. Syrah production is growing, however. In 2007, 
California wineries crushed 25 percent more Syrah grapes than 
they did just five years earlier — and more than 200 times as much 
as they did in 1990!
One of the reasons interest in Syrah is growing, we believe, is the 
amazing success that Shiraz wines from Australia have had in the 
U.S. market. Back when the main role model for Syrah wines was 
the wines of the Northern Rhône Valley in France — which don’t 
even carry the grape variety name — Syrah was a fairly unknown 
entity to wine drinkers in America. Australia’s success changed 
all that. Even though most of the Australian versions are called 
Shiraz rather than Syrah, wine drinkers now have a reference point 
for Syrah.
It’s impossible to know what portion of California’s Syrah grape 
production ends up as varietal Syrah wine as opposed to becoming 
part of a blended wine with Grenache, Mourvedre, and other red 
grapes, as is the custom in the southern part of France’s Rhône 
Valley. But we have to guess that varietal Syrah production is 
gaining because of the Aussie factor and the spinoff excitement 
surrounding Syrah wines from every imaginable wine-producing 
country, from Chile and Italy to New Zealand and Spain.

 Chapter 10: Syrah, Petite Sirah, and Other Reds 187
In California, likewise, Syrah is all over the place. The large Central 
Coast region was originally one of the key areas for Syrah produc-
tion and today is still a hotbed for this variety. But many wineries 
in Napa Valley now make Syrah — as do even more wineries in 
Sonoma County. In fact, Joseph Phelps Vineyards in Napa Valley 
was a Syrah pioneer; it first made a varietal Syrah in the 1974 
vintage.
Syrah versus Shiraz
The word Shiraz is simply a synonym for Syrah. In Australia, 
both the grape and the varietal wine made from it are known as 
Shiraz. The name is that of a city in Persia — today’s Iran — where 
the grape was once thought to have originated; through genetic 
testing, experts now peg France as the origin of Syrah.
U.S. regulations recognize Shiraz as an alternate name for Syrah, 
and winemakers in this country are free to use either name. 
Because Australian Shiraz wines are extremely popular in America, 
many wineries choose that name for their wine, whereas other 
wineries use the more traditional name, Syrah. (We remember one 
winemaker from northern California telling us a few years ago that 
sales were sluggish for his Syrah, but when he changed the wine’s 
name to Shiraz, sales suddenly took off.)
The name Shiraz on a California wine label often suggests a style 
of wine similar to that of the popular, inexpensive, mass-market 
Aussie Shirazes. These wines have a particular taste profile: They 
tend to be exuberantly fruity, suggesting berry fruit in particular, 
with soft texture and fairly little tannin. Although Australia’s 
full-bodied, powerful Syrah wines are also called Shiraz, many wine 
drinkers associate the style of the less expensive wines with the 
name Shiraz.
We believe that the popularity of Australian Shiraz has created an 
opportunity for California Syrah, but some California winemakers 
see the situation differently. They believe the low prices of Aussie 
Shiraz — many selling for close to $10 a bottle — have undercut 
the market for inexpensive California Syrahs or Shirazes. 
California’s varietal wines from the Syrah grape have tended to 
occupy the middle to upper price ranks.
The taste of California Syrah
The taste of Syrah and Shiraz wines from California varies perhaps 
more than that of any other red California wine. And no wonder, 
when you consider the following facts:

Part III: More Reds, Whites, Pinks and Bubblies 
188
 
✓ Dual role models: Not one but two iconic models of great 
Syrah wine exist outside of California: the wines of France’s 
Northern Rhône Valley (concentrated, firm wines that are 
built for aging, with complex aromas and flavors of dark 
fruits, black pepper, smoked meat, leather, and sometimes a 
vegetal note) and the elite Shiraz wines of Australia (powerful, 
densely textured, and opulent, with ripe dark-fruit flavors). 
Winemakers can model wines after either style.
 
✓ Diversity of growing conditions: Syrah grapevines are 
extremely adaptable to a range of climates and soil types; the 
grapes favor different styles of wine in different terroirs. (For 
info on the influence of growing conditions, see Chapter 3.)
 
✓ Number of American Viticultural Areas (AVAs): The Syrah 
grape grows in just about every region of California, from 
cool, coastal areas to warm, interior regions; different regions 
have potential for different styles of Syrah. (See the next 
section for some generalizations.)
 
✓ Target markets: The success of Australia’s inexpensive 
Shirazes together with the renown of Australia’s and France’s 
high-end Syrah wines have established two separate price 
tiers for Syrah, each with a different taste profile in terms of 
readiness to drink and each with a different target customer.
But we can make certain generalizations about how Syrah wines 
from California taste. They’re generally deep in color, dry to 
dryish, and fairly fruity, with what some winemakers describe as a 
“juicy” character to their fruitiness. (Exceptions are some wines 
from very warm parts of California that have a baked-fruit charac-
ter rather than a juicy, fresh-fruit character.) Aromas and flavors 
generally include dark fruit, berries, and spice, and these flavors 
are rather pronounced: Syrah is a flavorful wine. Other aromas and 
flavors can include floral notes, coffee, chocolate, earthiness, and a 
smoky character.
California Syrahs tend to have fairly high acidity and yet can 
suggest roundness in your mouth compared to the leaner struc-
ture of Cabernet Sauvignon. Tannin is moderate to very high 
(in those wines that age in new oak barrels).
 
When California producers call their wine Shiraz, they’re some-
times — but not always — communicating that the wine has a 
berry-fruity, flavorful, agreeable, low-tannin style similar to the 
inexpensive Australian wines that are so popular.
Compared to Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, California’s Syrah 
wines are generally fruitier, spicier, and more succulent. Compared 
to Pinot Noirs, Syrahs are somewhat more tannic, are fleshier in 
texture, and perhaps have greater aging potential.

 Chapter 10: Syrah, Petite Sirah, and Other Reds 189
Today’s hotbeds of Syrah and Shiraz
Is there a wine region in California that doesn’t grow at least a little 
Syrah? Maybe not. The highly adaptable nature of the Syrah grape 
enables it to grow well in very cool climates (such as the Sonoma 
Coast and Anderson Valley), in moderately warm climates (such 
as Paso Robles), and also in very warm climates, such as the San 
Joaquin Valley.
In 2007, San Luis Obispo County, which includes the Paso Robles 
AVA, had the most acreage of Syrah vines in California, followed 
by San Joaquin County. Together, these two counties accounted 
for about 25 percent of California’s Syrah acreage. Throw in the 
acreage in Madera, Sacramento, and Fresno counties (all warm, 
interior areas), and the tally totals more than half of the state’s 
Syrah acreage. But the top-ten list also includes Sonoma, 
Monterey, Santa Barbara, Napa, and Mendocino counties, all 
of which are cool or include significant cool-climate portions. 
In fact, the excitement over Syrah is now so intense in several 
cool-climate AVAs that, were Pinot Noir not so hugely popular, 
growers might conceivably supplant their Pinot Noir vines 
with Syrah.
The concept of “cool-climate” Syrah already exists in Australia, 
where winemakers and marketing types use the phrase to differen-
tiate the wines of certain growing regions from those of other 
regions. And many California winemakers have begun talking 
in these terms themselves (a few even name their wine “Cool 
Climate Syrah”).
 
The precise definitions of “cool climate” and “warm climate” 
are debatable. In naming the regions that make Syrah in the cool-
climate or warmer-climate style, we generalize, and exceptions do 
exist. Parts of Napa Valley, for example, are cool enough to make 
Syrah wines with flavor complexity and other cool-climate taste 
characteristics. Also, many Syrah wines are midway between the 
two styles.
Cool-climate California Syrah
We have often heard Syrah producers espouse the conviction 
that, contrary to much popular belief, the Syrah grape grows best 
in fairly cool climates. Today, some California winemakers are 
providing fodder for this argument by making fine Syrah wines 
from grapes that grow in western areas cooled by Pacific breezes 
and fog.

Part III: More Reds, Whites, Pinks and Bubblies 
190
 
Cool-climate Syrahs are higher in acid and firmer in tannin than 
Syrah wines from warmer climates and therefore tend to be tight in 
structure and ageworthy. They have complex aromas and flavors 
that run the gamut of the grape’s repertoire, expressing bright, 
fresh notes of berry fruit, cracked black or white pepper, floral 
notes such as lilac or lavender, and gamey notes.

Warmer-climate California Syrah
 
California Syrah has its origins in warmer climates, particularly the 
eastern part of Paso Robles. The rich, powerful style characteristic 
of warmer climates has been the state’s most common style of 
Syrah, and this style has attracted many fans among both wine-
makers and wine drinkers. Warmer-climate Syrahs are fuller-
bodied than cool-climate Syrahs and slightly sweeter, with softer 
tannins and more velvety, fleshier texture; their aromas and 
flavors tend to express mainly very ripe, dark fruit and often toasty 
oak character, with only minor notes, if any, of spices or herbs.
Regions of California that produce Syrah in the warmer-climate 
style include
 
✓ Lodi
 
✓ Paso Robles
 
✓ Napa Valley (apart from Carneros)

Those Syrah wines that carry only the state-designation, California, 
also usually hail from warmer, interior wine regions, but these 
wines are often less powerful and dense in texture than those of 
the regions we mention here.
Recommended Syrah wines
Although Paso Robles in San Luis Obispo might be considered the 
unofficial capital of Syrah country, we recommend excellent Syrah 
wines from every major region in the state — including Santa 
Barbara County, where Syrah has certainly been very successful, 
and the Sonoma Coast AVA, which is emerging as a key region for 
cool-climate Syrahs.

The Dark and Mysterious 
Petite Sirah
Everyone loves a good mystery — and over the past few decades, 
the Petite Sirah grape has provided just that for wine lovers, 
because speculation abounded over the precise origins of the 
grape. In this section, we cover Petite Sirah’s history and popular-
ity, and we discuss the flavor of the wine, key Petite Sirah regions, 
and our recommended wines.
The great identity search
Theories about Petite Sirah’s identity were many. Was it actually a 
clone of Syrah, or was it related to Syrah, or was it something 
entirely different? Was it in fact one variety or a common name for 
three different varieties? Was it a California original?
The variety today known as Petite Sirah came to California from 
France in 1884. After the phylloxera louse decimated California’s 
vineyards (the first time) in the 1890s, Petite Sirah became a 
popular variety to plant. During Prohibition (1920–1933), it was 
one of the grape varieties shipped from California’s vineyards 
to home winemakers across the U.S. But historians believe that 
winemakers in those days used the name Petite Sirah for several 
different varieties.
In the 1970s, two renowned French ampelographers (grape 
researchers) identified Petite Sirah as the Durif grape; however, a 
highly respected professor from U.C. Davis, Harold Olmo, still 
believed that the name applied to three distinct varieties in 
California. In fact, some vineyards that at one time were said to 
contain Petite Sirah were later identified as Syrah vineyards.
 
Some of the confusion surrounding Petite Sirah’s identity was due 
to the fact that many Petite Sirah vineyards in California are very 
old and, as was customary in the past, those vineyards contained 
other grape varieties in addition to Petite Sirah. Instead of blending 
wines from different varieties, winemakers used to plant their 
vineyards with various grapes and harvest them all together to 
make a wine that was actually a field blend.
Finally, in 1996, science solved the mystery. U.C. Davis professor 
Carole Meredith used DNA analysis to prove that Petite Sirah 
is Durif.
But what is Durif? Apart from its presence in California, the variety 
is an obscure one. It came into existence in France in 1880 through 
a cross pollination of two Vitis vinifera varieties, Peloursin (an 

 Chapter 10: Syrah, Petite Sirah, and Other Reds 195
old variety from the Rhône Valley) and Syrah. The fact that Syrah 
is a parent of Durif/Petite Sirah became known only in 1998, again 
through Dr. Meredith’s genetic research.
When experts conclusively identified Petite Sirah as Durif and 
subsequently discovered Durif’s genetic lineage, Petite Sirah could 
finally claim status as a “noble” variety, based on its parent Syrah 
(if not on the basis of Peloursin, a mediocre variety).
Petite Sirah’s ups and downs
Through all the years of its confused identity, Petite Sirah rose and 
fell in vineyard acreage several times. From a high of about 14,000 
acres in 1976 (when the grape was often used in blends such as 
California “Burgundy”), the grape fell to only about 1,400 acres in 
1990. Now it’s on the upswing again, with more than 6,000 acres 
in 2005.
Less than ten years ago, only 60 producers were making Petite 
Sirah wine in California. Today, over 370 producers make Petite 
Sirah, a 600-plus percent increase. What has given this wine such 
momentum? We can think of several reasons:
 
✓ Producers are making better Petite Sirahs, softening the 
wine’s brutal tannin and making the wine attractive in its 
youth.
 
✓ The increased popularity of Syrah/Shiraz has made Petite 
Sirah more recognizable and acceptable.
 
✓ Wine drinkers in America are becoming more adventuresome.
 
✓ Petite Sirah remains reasonably priced.
 
✓ It tastes good!
The grape has its own advocacy group of 78 winery and trade 
members, which sponsors an informational Web site (www.psilove
you.org) and conducts events and other marketing activities to 
promote Petite Sirah wines.
The taste of Petite Sirah
Petit Sirah wines are dark, gutsy, bold, and intense reds. Because 
of their decisive personality, these wines have always elicited a 
strong reaction from those who taste them. They’re not the kind 
of wines that you feel neutral about. Those who love the wines 
tend to be passionate fans, and they constitute something of a cult 
following for the wines.

Part III: More Reds, Whites, Pinks and Bubblies 
196
The aromas and flavors of Petite Sirah wines include fruits such 
as plum and blackberry as well as black pepper. In some wines, 
the aromas and flavors can be complex, verging into the red-fruit 
spectrum (cranberry, pomegranate) or having animal notes 
such as leather or refined notes from oak-aging, such as mocha or 
cinnamon. But in other wines, the aromas and flavors, although 
pleasant, are low key and not particularly distinctive.
More than aroma and flavor, the wine’s structure — its tannin, 
high alcohol, robust body, and dense texture — and its gutsy, 
powerful, take-no-prisoners style are what particularly charac-
terize Petite Sirah. (A common saying is that Petite Sirah is not 
Syrah, and it’s definitely not petite!)
We remember the Petite Sirah wines from the 1970s that we drank 
together in the 1980s. They were somewhat rustic wines loaded 
with black pepper spiciness, and they were firm and austere due to 
their high tannin. No matter how long we let them lie in our cellar, 
they never seemed to be quite ready to drink. We definitely 
enjoyed them, but we always thought that they would have been 
even better with more age.
 
Although Petite Sirah is a high-tannin grape, its wines today 
require less aging than was the case 20 years ago. You can drink 
Petite Sirah wines that are two or three years old — their age when 
they’re released from the winery — and find them very drinkable. 
They still can improve with some aging, but that aging isn’t a 
requirement for enjoying them. Winemakers today are adept at 
limiting the amount of grape tannin that finds its way into the wine 
and at growing the grapes in such a way that the tannins are less 
aggressive.
Where Petite Sirah grows
We were amazed to read that, according to wine historian Charles 
Sullivan, Petite Sirah was the most planted grape in California’s 
most prestigious wine region, Napa Valley, during the 1960s. In 
the 1970s, growers removed most of their Petite Sirah vines to 
plant Cabernet Sauvignon. Petite Sirah does grow in Napa Valley 
today, but it’s a minor variety. Nevertheless, some Napa Valley 
winemakers are very dedicated to this variety — among them, 
Stags’ Leap Winery, Quixote Winery, Markham Vineyards, and 
Girard Winery.
Mendocino County, north of Sonoma County (see Chapter 4), is a 
stronghold of Petite Sirah, particularly in the interior Redwood 
Valley AVA; Parducci Wine Estates has been a pioneer for this wine 
in Mendocino.

 Chapter 10: Syrah, Petite Sirah, and Other Reds 197
Sonoma County has Petite Sirah vineyards, particularly in Dry 
Creek Valley, where Pedroncelli grows this grape. Sonoma’s 
Russian River Valley AVA to the south is the home of Foppiano 
Vineyards, where Louis Foppiano, one of Petite Sirah’s strongest 
advocates, grows the variety and makes a fine Petite Sirah.
Other notable regions for Petite Sirah include the Central Coast 
AVAs of Paso Robles and San Luis Obispo; the Sierra Foothills AVA; 
Fair Play; Lodi; Lake County; and the San Joaquin Valley. Livermore 
Valley is of historical significance because Concannon Vineyard, an 
early advocate of Petite Sirah, is there.
Recommended Petite Sirah wines
Our recommended Petite Sirah wines fall into two price 
categories — moderate (under $20) and moderate-plus ($20 to 
$50). Many of our recommended wines cost less than $20, and a 
number of them are under $15! (At around $10, we consider Red 
Truck Petite Sirah a best buy.) And many wines in our higher tier 
cost less than $30 retail.
 
Some wineries label their Petite Sirah wines as Petite Syrah. 
Don’t let that confuse you; it’s just an alternate spelling that some 
wineries prefer.

California’s Red Rhône-style 
Blends
In the category of red Rhône-style wines — that is, wines made from 
grape varieties grown in France’s Rhône Valley — California produces 
varietal wines from Syrah, Petite Sirah (technically not grown in the 
Rhône Valley but locally considered a Rhône grape because of its 
genetic link to Syrah), and to a minor extent, Grenache, Mourvedre, 
and Cinsault. But blends are actually the norm in the Rhône Valley, 
and California produces hundreds of red wines that are blends of 
various grapes native to or common in the Rhône Valley.
A range of styles
Rhône blends vary tremendously in style because they don’t follow 
many rules: They can contain any number of grape varieties, from 
two to more than ten; any of the red Rhône varieties can be the 
dominant variety; and any of the approved varieties can be blended 
together, according to their availability and the winemaker’s fancy.
The Rhone Rangers (www.rhonerangers.org), an association of 
producers of (mainly California) wines from Rhône varieties, 
categorizes the red blends with these words:
 
✓ The Chateauneuf model (referring to a French wine, 
Châteauneuf-du-Pape): Start with about half Grenache, add in 
a good proportion of Syrah and/or Mourvedre for oomph and 
aging, and round out the complexity with an amazing array of 
other red and even white grapes
 
✓ The hot-weather model: Various proportions of Grenache, 
Cinsault, and Carignan, designed to produce early-drinking wines
 
✓ The Down Under model: Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, in 
various proportions
Note: Cabernet Sauvignon is not a Rhône Valley variety, but the 
organization includes it in one of the prototype blends. Cabernet-
Shiraz blends are popular in Australia.
 
You can imagine — and we can confirm — that any one Rhône blend 
from California can vary considerably from the next. Some are soft, 
full-bodied, high-alcohol wines with baked-fruit and earthy aromas 
and flavors, whereas others are fairly vibrant reds with fresh-fruit 
flavors and a firm tannic structure, and still others are big, rich 
wines with spicy and very ripe fruit flavors and dense texture. Not 
even the dominant grape variety is a reliable predictor of the wine’s 
style, because that variety can vary according to where it grows.

 Chapter 10: Syrah, Petite Sirah, and Other Reds 199
The bad news might be that you don’t really know what you’re 
getting when you buy a Rhône blend (unless you do your home-
work in advance by reading reviews of the specific wine you 
intend to buy) — but the good news is that the category offers lots 
of opportunities for exploration and adventure.
When in Rhône: The grapes 
in Rhône blends
Although we can’t describe the taste and style of every possible 
Rhône-style red blend, we can at least describe the grape varieties 
that are the building blocks of these blends. When you know 
how the component wines typically taste, you can extrapolate the 
likely style of a particular blended wine. In most cases, back-label 
information tells you which grape varieties are in the wine and 
sometimes gives you the relative percentages of each variety.
In the following list, we describe the main Rhône grapes and their 
wines in the order of their importance in Rhône blends:
 
✓ Syrah: Syrah is by far the most distinguished and highest 
quality grape used in Rhône-style blends, both in France and 
in California. In a nutshell, the grapes have deep color, thick 
skins, and a wide aromatic range. Wines are dark and are firm 
with tannin (unless produced by methods that limit their 
amount of tannin), and they express aromas and flavors 
that include black fruits as well as herbal, vegetal, spicy, 
earthy, and even floral notes. Generally, the wines are fresh 
and vibrant.
GSM, a classic grape trinity
If you begin exploring California’s Rhône blends in your wine shop, in magazine 
articles, or on the Internet, you’re sure to come across the term GSM. These initials 
stand for Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvedre.
These three grapes represent a classic blend in the Southern Rhône Valley, with 
Grenache generally the grape used in the highest proportion and Mourvedre used 
in the smallest. The French versions usually have place names, such as Côtes du 
Rhône; however, New World wines that blend these three varieties often carry the 
name of the grapes, which has led to the convenient abbreviation GSM. Sometimes 
GSM is actually the name of the wine, and sometimes it’s just a term that people 
use to refer to that type of wine.

✓ Grenache: Almost the opposite of Syrah, this grape has thin 
skins, little color, and little tannin, and it ripens with high 
sugar levels to make full-bodied, high-alcohol, easy-drinking 
wines. Aromas and flavors can include raspberry, blueberry, 
raisins, spices such as pepper, and herbs such as rosemary — 
but frequently Grenache wines have far less flavor complexity 
than that. Only when the vines are old or when growers prune 
severely to achieve a low crop level are the wines fairly dark, 
rich, dense in texture, and flavorful.
 
✓ Mourvedre: Sometimes labeled as Mataro, this variety has 
small, dark, sweet berries and produces high-alcohol, tannic, 
sometimes rustic wines that can also be high in acid. A 
common descriptor for Mourvedre’s aromas and flavors is 
“meaty”; the wines can also have blackberry flavors, and they 
tend to age well.
 
✓ Carignan: California has more than four times the acreage of 
Carignan than of Mourvedre, and most of the grapes end up in 
ordinary jug-wine blends. But some Rhone Rangers cultivate 
this grape for their wines. The grape is tannic and dark, with 
high acid and high tannin. It can contribute gutsy character to 
blended wines.
 
✓ Petite Sirah: This is a dark-skinned grape that makes tannic, 
robust wines with aromas and flavors of black pepper 
spiciness and dark fruits. (See the earlier section “The taste 
of Petite Sirah.”)
 
✓ Cinsault: Cinsault makes wines that are fairly light in body 
and low in tannin, with fruity and spicy aromas and flavors.
 
✓ Counoise: A very minor variety in California, Counoise brings 
to a blend moderate alcohol, a medium amount of tannin, 
lively acidity, and flavors of berries and spice.
Another grape that winemakers sometimes use in Rhône style 
blends is Zinfandel, which is generally fruity and spicy, with ripe 
berry flavors. We devote all of Chapter 8 to this grape variety 
and its wines. Viognier, a very perfumed white grape, also makes 
occasional appearances in red Rhône-style blends; we discuss 
Viognier in Chapter 9.
Recommended California 
red Rhône blends
Just as almost every California wine producer who makes Cabernet 
Sauvignon also makes a Cabernet-based blended wine, most Syrah 
producers also make a blended red wine composed of Rhône 
varieties in various combinations. The Central Coast — primarily

Paso Robles and Edna Valley in San Luis Obispo County, plus Santa 
Barbara and Monterey Counties — is the main source for Rhône 
blends. Sonoma County also has some fine Rhône-style wines.

Cal-Ital: Italian Varieties 
in California
Considering how many Italian and Italian-American families settled 
in California since the 1800s, and considering what a crucial role 
wine plays in Italian culture, the Italian influence in California wine 
country has been considerable. Sometimes this influence plays 
out in the background, as part of a winery’s culture; for example, 
Gina Gallo believes that food-friendliness, a prerequisite for Italian 
wines, is central to her winemaking at Gallo Family Vineyards. 
Sometimes the Italian influence dictates which grape varieties a 

Part III: More Reds, Whites, Pinks and Bubblies 
202
winery plants — or which old vineyards it refuses to uproot; an 
example is the old plantings of Italy’s Sangiovese grape that remain 
so cherished by the Seghesio family in Sonoma County.
Increasingly, some winemakers view their admiration for Italian 
grapes or Italian wines as something of a cause. The catchy name 
given to this movement of vino-loving winemakers and their 
Italianate wines is Cal-Ital.
The earliest plantings of Italian grape varieties in California date 
back to the 19th century, but the modern age began in the 1980s. 
Although nearly two dozen white and red varieties of Italian origin 
(or varieties that are mainly identified with Italy) now grow in 
California, the movement is a low-key one, because most of these 
varieties grow in small quantities.
Cal-Ital red grape varieties
The Cal-Ital red grape variety that dominates in terms of quantity 
produced is Barbera (bar-bear-ah), a grape from northern Italy’s 
Piedmont region that was for many decades the most planted 
red grape variety in Italy. In California, Barbera quantitatively 
ranks seventh among all red varieties, behind Pinot Noir and just 
ahead of Ruby Cabernet (a California-bred crossing of Cabernet 
Sauvignon and Carignan).
But the red variety that dominates in terms of image is Sangiovese 
(san-joe-vay-say), a Tuscan variety (think Chianti) that in Italy 
overtook Barbera as the leading red grape. One of the reasons the 
Cal-Ital movement isn’t bigger than it is, in fact, is that Sangiovese, 
the leader, is difficult to grow and to vinify. Winemakers in 
California have struggled to tame Sangiovese’s firm tannins, for 
example, and to maintain deep color in the wine. Some once-
committed wineries have now abandoned Sangiovese altogether — 
most notably Shafer Vineyards and Atlas Peak Winery, both in 
Napa Valley. Even when wineries produce decent Sangiovese 
wines, as many have learned to do, the wines are difficult to sell.
The 11 principal red grape varieties of Italian origin in California 
are the following, listed in terms of their tonnage, from most to 
least: Barbera, Sangiovese, Primitivo (recognized by U.S. authori-
ties as a synonym for Zinfandel), Refosco, Dolcetto, Teroldego, 
Nebbiolo, Aglianico, Grignolino, Aleatico, and Freisa. Other Italian 
grape varieties that also grow in California include Lagrein, 
Montepulciano, Negroamaro, Nero d’Avola, and Sagrantino. 
However, apart from Barbera and Sangiovese, you aren’t likely to 
encounter most of these wines in their California skin.

 Chapter 10: Syrah, Petite Sirah, and Other Reds 203
 
Some people include Charbono as a Cal-Ital variety, but California’s 
Charbono is technically not an Italian variety. Although a grape 
called Charbono exists in Italy, the California grape of the same 
name is genetically unrelated.
Recommended Cal-Ital red wines
We believe that red Cal-Ital wines have a great future in California. 
The best is yet to come, as soon as winemakers figure out where 
to grow and how to handle Italy’s great but extremely challenging 
red varieties, such as Nebbiolo, Sangiovese, and Aglianico. (It 
took Italian wine producers hundreds of years to decipher these 
varieties, and by their own admissions, they haven’t mastered 
them yet.) Meanwhile, we’d like to see Californians concentrate 
on one red Italian variety that they have been able to grow 
successfully: Barbera.
We list our recommended red Cal-Ital wines alphabetically in two 
price categories: moderately priced (under $20) and moderate-plus 
($20 to $50).

Other Varietal Reds
If you live in California or you patronize wine shops and restau-
rants that specialize in California wines, you might come across 
other varietal wines beyond those that we discuss earlier in this 
chapter and in our previous red wine chapters. Here is a list of 
some of those unusual, exotic, or simply “other” red varietal wines. 
We describe the wines in what we consider their relative order of 
importance.
Cal-Ital wine discoveries
One of the benefits of exploring unusual wine types such as Cal-Ital wines is dis-
covering new, exciting wines. We recently found five wineries that are doing a very 
good job with always-challenging Italian varieties. Three are in Mendocino County, 
and two are in Paso Robles (San Luis Obispo County):
 ✓ Brutocao Cellars (Mendocino): This winery is making one of the best 
Dolcettos — a dry, medium-bodied, spicy red — that we’ve tasted from 
California. It’s very typical of a lighter-styled Dolcetto from Piedmont, Italy, and 
reasonably priced at $18. Brutocao also has an excellent Barbera ($20) that 
exhibits the tart cherry fruit of this Piedmontese variety.
 ✓ Chiarito Vineyard (Mendocino): John Chiarito, a true pioneer, is making 
California’s first Nero d’Avola (a Sicilian variety) and first Negroamaro (origi-
nally from Italy’s Apulia region). The 2003 Nero d’Avola is impressive, with rich, 
plummy fruit flavors balanced by good amounts of tannin and acidity ($50). With 
its warm, baked-fruit flavors, Chiarito’s Negroamaro ($23) bears a strong 
resemblance to Apulian Negroamaros.
 ✓ Graziano Family of Wines (Mendocino): This winery makes a huge array of 
Cal-Ital varietal wines. Its Enotria Nebbiolo (about $22), from Piedmont’s noble 
grape, is especially impressive. And Graziano’s whites, such as its Monte Volpe 
Tocai Friulano ($15), are tops.
 ✓ Caparone Winery (Paso Robles): Dave and Marc Caparone (father and son) 
specialize in Italian varieties, and they sell them all for an amazing price, $14. 
Caparone Winery made California’s first Aglianico (Southern Italy’s greatest 
red variety), and it’s a very good one. Caparone also produces one of the only 
California Sangioveses we really like, with the firm structure of a Tuscan wine, 
and a rather delicate Nebbiolo that ages well.
 ✓ Martin & Weyrich (Paso Robles): This winery, formerly known as Martin 
Brothers, might be California’s most successful producer of Piedmont’s great 
Nebbiolo. Martin & Weyrich makes two of them, both very good, but the “Il 
Vecchio” (about $18 to $20) is its best. Martin & Weyrich also makes a fine 
Sangiovese which it calls “Il Palio” (about $16).

 Chapter 10: Syrah, Petite Sirah, and Other Reds 205
 
✓ Cabernet Franc: We mention Cab Franc as one of the grapes 
used in Bordeaux-style blends (Chapter 6). But Cabernet 
Franc also makes varietal wines in California, and those wines 
can be quite good. They tend to have fresh flavors of red 
fruits and are more flavorful than Cabernet Sauvignons.
 
✓ Malbec: Another grape that figures in Bordeaux-style blends, 
Malbec is far more popular in Argentina than in California. 
Varietal Malbecs are deep in color and can be quite tannic, 
with dark-berry and spicy flavors.
 
✓ Petit Verdot: Yet another Bordeaux blending grape, this 
one makes deep, dark wines with firm tannin and good fruit 
character concentration; the best wines have rich, fleshy 
texture.
 
✓ Tempranillo: Spain’s flagship red grape variety is gaining a 
foothold in California. Tempranillo (tem-pra-nee-yo) wines are 
usually dark in color, low in acidity, and either soft-textured 
or very tannic, with rather low-key flavors of plum, blackber-
ries, and coffee. They’re considered inherently food-friendly.
 
✓ Napa Gamay: This is not the Gamay grape of Beaujolais fame 
but actually a southwestern France variety called Valdiguié 
(val-dee-gway) and increasingly labeled as such. It produces 
easy-drinking, low-tannin wines.
 
✓ Alicante Bouschet: This grape (pronounced al-eh-cahn-tay 
boo-shay) is used mainly to give color to other reds, but it has 
a following among fans of big, rustic, old-style California reds.
 
✓ Tannat: A variety from southwestern France and a signature 
varietal wine in Uruguay and Brazil, Tannat makes huge, 
gutsy, powerful reds.

Chapter 11
Bubbly, Rosé, and 
Dessert Wines
In This Chapter
▶ California’s best bubbly bruts
▶ The return of rosé wines, this time dry
▶ Dessert wines for dessert
W
e love sparkling wines and drink them at every opportu-
nity. California’s top sparkling wines, often referred to 
as sparkling bruts because most are made in the brut (very dry) 
style, are generally excellent and deserve more attention than 
they receive. The best of them are among the best sparkling wines 
in the world; only some true Champagnes, from France, stand 
above them in quality — but of course you pay a hefty price for 
most Champagnes today!
In the world of table wines, we are very happy to see that dryer-
style rosé (pink) wines are making a big comeback in the U.S. and 
throughout the world. Because of the popularity of White Zinfandel 
and other California blush (pink and sweet) wines, California’s rosé 
wines have had a reputation — rightfully or wrongly — for being 
sweet and innocuous. That reputation is changing, as more and 
more California dry rosés become available. We name some of our 
favorite dry rosés in this chapter, and we also look at White 
Zinfandel and company. We conclude with a roundup of California 
dessert wines, in all colors and styles.
California’s Sparkling Wines
California producers make sparkling wines in every major 
category: non-vintage bruts (bubblies blended from wines of 
several different years), rosé bubblies, blanc de blancs (from 
white grapes only), blanc de noirs (white or pink sparkling wines 
made entirely from red grapes), and vintage-dated bruts and rosés. 
You can even find California sparkling wines labeled Spumante that 

Part III: More Reds, Whites, Pinks and Bubblies 
208
are sweet, flavorful wines in the style of Italy’s famous sparkling 
wine, Asti. However, California’s top sparkling wine producers use 
the varieties that are used in France’s Champagne region as their 
main grape varieties: Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. (Note: Pinot 
Blanc and Champagne’s third important grape, Pinot Meunier, are 
minor components in a few California sparkling wines.)
 
All the better California sparkling bruts are made by the same 
method used in Champagne, called méthode champenoise or classic 
method. In this method, the wine’s second fermentation, which 
gives the wine its bubbles, takes place in the bottle that you 
buy. However, some sparkling wines from larger wineries are the 
product of more economical methods, such as large-batch second 
fermentations in tanks or even the injection of gas directly into a 
wine. Labels of wines made using large-batch fermentation usually 
carry the term charmat method; wines made by the injection of 
carbon dioxide gas must be labeled as carbonated wines. Price can 
also be a guide: Wines costing under $8 are generally made using 
one of these two shortcut methods.
Considering the quality level of many California sparkling wines, 
we have always been mystified that they don’t sell better than they 
do. Many top California sparkling wine producers have had to add 
table wines — Pinot Noir and Chardonnay — to their product line 
in order to stay in business, and quite a few just stopped making 
sparkling wine altogether. Of course, the sparkling wine business is 
highly competitive, with true Champagne from France wooing wine 
lovers on the luxury end and Spanish cava (the name used for 
most Spanish sparkling wines) and Italian Prosecco wines luring 
value-minded wine drinkers.
Characterizing California bubbly
California’s different climates, soils, and other variables make 
California’s sparkling wines different from France’s Champagnes 
and all other sparkling wines in the world. Because California’s 
bubblies tend to be made with riper grapes than those of 
Champagne and many other regions, they taste fruitier than these 
other wines. Also, California generally ages most of its sparkling 
wines a shorter time than the historic French region, Champagne, 
does; as a result, California bruts usually lack the toastiness or 
biscuity character that you can find in some aged Champagnes.
The fruitiness, exuberance of bubbles, and frothiness of California 
bubblies makes them perfect for less formal settings, such as 
parties, outdoor events, and casual eating. However, more and 
more serious, longer-aged, complex California sparkling wines 
are now available from such producers as Iron Horse and 
Schramsberg. (You can find many of these wines listed in our 
high-end recommendations in the following pages.)

 Chapter 11: Bubbly, Rosé, and Dessert Wines 209
French- and California-owned brands
Many of California’s top sparkling wine companies are French-
owned. Producers from the region of Champagne opened wineries 
in California for two reasons: They were running out of vineyard 
land in their home region, and they knew that Americans were very 
loyal to their own brands. (Even today, almost 70 percent of all 
wines sold in the U.S are domestic, and most of them are from 
California.)
Moët & Chandon, located in the town of Epernay in France, started 
the Champagne foray into California in 1973 when it opened 
Domaine Chandon — today the second-largest sparkling wine 
producer in California after Korbel. Other French producers 
from Champagne followed: G. H. Mumm (which founded Mumm 
Napa), Taittinger (which owns Domaine Carneros), and Louis 
Roederer (owner of Roederer Estate). Some came to California 
but have since left: Deutz (which had owned Maison Deutz), 
Veuve Clicquot (which had owned Scharffenberger, a brand now 
owned by Roederer Estate), and Piper-Heidsieck (former owner 
of Piper Sonoma, which is now owned by an importer, Remy 
Cointreau USA).
Other top California wineries producing sparkling wines are 
American-owned. These include Iron Horse, Schramsberg, J Wine 
Company, Laetitia Estate, and Korbel. The one exception to French 
or American ownership is Gloria Ferrer, owned by a huge Spanish 
producer, Freixenet.
Don’t call it “Champagne”
California’s top sparkling bruts are among the best in the world, and many are good 
values as well. But make sure you get the name straight! Champagne is the name 
of a region in northeastern France, from which the world’s most famous sparkling 
wine, Champagne, originates. France and all other countries in the European Union 
recognize Champagne as a name that belongs only to the sparkling wines of the 
Champagne area.
Because U.S. labeling regulations consider champagne to be a semi-generic name 
(see Chapter 2), it’s legal for California producers to use the term for their sparkling 
wines, provided that they modify it with the word California or a similar geographic 
indication. Quite a few producers do call their bubblies “champagne,” including 
California’s biggest producer of sparkling wines, Korbel. However, most top-quality 
producers don’t use the term. Schramsberg dropped “champagne” from its spar-
kling brut labels a few years ago after having used the term for decades. Of course, 
half of the best California sparkling wine companies are owned by French 
Champagne houses, which doesn’t hurt the cause!

Recommended sparkling wines
We list our recommended California sparkling wines — including 
rosés, blanc de blancs, and vintage bubblies — in three price 
categories, according to their typical prices in wine shops:
 
✓ Moderately priced: Under $30
 
✓ Moderate-plus: $30 to $50
 
✓ High-end: Over $50
Don’t miss our sidebar titled “Top-value California sparkling 
wines,” in which we name several California sparklers under $20 
that we think are excellent buys.
Roederer Estate, the ultimate 
California bubbly
When French Champagne producers realized they were running out of vineyard 
land back home, many started buying vineyards in California and building wineries 
there. Most of these new operations were in Napa Valley or Sonoma. But Jean-
Claude Rouzaud, the crafty boss of Champagne Louis Roederer (producers of the 
sublime Cristal) knew that top sparkling wine demanded a very cool climate, and in 
1982 he found it 125 miles north of San Francisco, in Mendocino’s Anderson 
Valley.
Roederer Estate debuted its first sparkling brut (a dry sparkling wine) in 1988, fol-
lowed shortly by a delicately colored brut rosé. Both wines have been the critics’ 
darlings since their introduction. In 1993, Roederer Estate introduced a premium 
vintage sparkling wine, L’Ermitage, which vintage after vintage vies for honors as 
the best sparkling wine in the world made outside of Champagne itself. Recently, a 
vintage L’Ermitage Rosé joined the line. If you shop around, you can find the non-
vintage Roederer Estate sparkling brut for under $20, the brut rosé for about $25, 
the L’Ermitage for about $40, and the low-production, harder-to-find L’Ermitage 
Rosé for about $50.

Pretty in Pink: California Rosés, 
Dry and Sweet
Many wine drinkers dismiss the entire category of rosé wines 
because they consider the wines not serious, too sweet, or wimpy. 
But a revolution is underway: Many California rosé wines are now 
being made dry, and remarkably, they’re in demand. Sales of rosé 
wines in the U.S. increased over 50 percent in 2007. Who would’ve 
thunk it?

Of course, California still makes plenty of White Zinfandel and 
other sweet rosés, often referred to as blush wines. These wines 
are inexpensive, easy-drinking, flavorful, and no, not serious. But 
there’s definitely a time and a place to enjoy wines that don’t take 
themselves too seriously — and there’s certainly a place for any 
wine that has as many fans as White Zinfandel does.
Serious, dry rosés
Serious California rosés include all rosé wines made in a dryer 
style. They retail for over $10, generally in the $12 to $20 range — 
as opposed to sweeter rosés and blush wines, which are almost 
always under $10. They can come from any red grape variety, and 
they might or might not be labeled with the name of the grape. The 
varieties most frequently used for California rosés are Pinot Noir, 
Sangiovese, Grenache, and Syrah (the last two often blended 
together).
 
Two French terms you sometimes see on California rosé labels are 
oeil de perdrix (meaning “eye of the partridge”) and vin gris (“gray 
wine”), both referring to color. These terms usually apply to very 
pale rosé wines that are often dryer than deeper-colored rosés.
Our recommendations of serious California rosé wines fall into two 
categories according to the wines’ typical prices in wine shops: 
moderately priced ($12 to $20) and moderate-plus (over $20). And 
in the sidebar “Five top-value rosé wines,” we identify five good 
California rosés for under $12 that we think are excellent buys.

White Zinfandel and 
its blushing cousins
White Zinfandel isn’t selling at the same frenzied pace that it did 
in the 1980s and 1990s, but it’s still the third best-selling varietal 
wine in California, just slightly behind Cabernet Sauvignon and well 
behind Chardonnay. It outsells red Zinfandel by more than 6 to 1 
(see Chapter 8 for info on red Zin).
Although wine connoisseurs scorn White Zinfandel as something 
more akin to a beverage than a real wine, it’s certainly special 
to the many thousands who drink it. The wine offers sweetness, 
fruitiness, moderate alcohol levels, and no tannin, for a mild-
tasting wine that doesn’t bite. White Zinfandel is the perfect wine 
for you if you find most wines too dry or astringent.
Five top-value rosé wines
These five serious rosés, all under $12, are our picks as top values:

 ✓ Toad Hollow Vineyards, “Eye of the Toad” Dry Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma 
County)

Part III: More Reds, Whites, Pinks and Bubblies 
214
 
White Zinfandel’s color ranges from pale pink to a dark rose, 
and depending on the producer, the wine can vary in sweetness 
from off-dry to quite sweet. As a general rule, paler White Zins 
tend to be less sweet, and very pink ones tend to be sweeter. 
Regardless of hue, they’re always soft in texture and low in 
alcohol. White Zin is a wine to drink cold, and it’s a wine to drink 
while it’s young and fresh; buy the most recent vintage you can 
find, and chill it.
The term blush wine, which came into vogue in the U.S. in the 
1970s, is a general name for any sweet pink wine. White Zinfandel’s 
success has given rise to many other blush wines in California, 
such as Cabernet Blush, or White Cabernet; White Merlot; and 
Grenache Rosé, or White Grenache. All blush wines are fairly 
similar in style.
 
Almost all blush wines, including White Zin, are inexpensive — in 
the $5 to $10 range, with most closer to $5. Most blush wines are 
produced from grapes grown in California’s warm, inland San 
Joaquin Valley. California’s leading White Zinfandels include the 
following:
 
✓ Sutter Home: The first commercial producer of White 
Zinfandel and still one of the most popular, selling more than 
4 million cases a year
 
✓ Beringer Vineyards: The best-selling White Zinfandel of all; 
pale in color and dryer than most; Beringer also makes a 
white Merlot
 
✓ De Loach Vineyards: Definitely one of the driest, most com-
plexly flavored White Zins; also one of the most expensive, at 
about $10
 
✓ Woodbridge: Another large producer and also one of the best
 
✓ Terra d’Oro (formerly Monteviña): A Zinfandel specialist; 
makes reliable White Zinfandels, not too sweet; owned by the 
Trinchero family, proprietors of Sutter Home
 
✓ E & J Gallo Family Vineyard: Very reasonably priced; lighter 
style; Gallo also produces Turning Leaf White Zinfandel
 
✓ Fetzer, Valley Oaks: Well-made, fruity, and not too sweet
 
✓ Glen Ellen: A well-priced White Zin in the sweeter style
 
✓ Barefoot Cellars: An affordable, non-vintage White Zin; also 
produces a sparkling White Zin

 Chapter 11: Bubbly, Rosé, and Dessert Wines 215
Sweet Dessert Wines
Sweet wines, also called dessert wines, date back to the earliest 
days of California wine production. Until the 1960s, they were more 
popular nationwide than dry table wines. Today, they represent 
just a small portion of California’s wine production, but perhaps as 
a result, their quality is better than ever.
Dessert wines are a very varied group. Some of them have no 
more alcohol than table wines, for example, and others contain as 
much as 20 percent alcohol. Some of them are white, and some are 
red. They also come from many different grape varieties. But one 
characteristic that dessert wines all have in common is that 
they’re highly flavorful and very rich. You can sip these wines 
with dessert or drink them after your dinner, as dessert itself.
California makes sweet wines in just about every style that exists, 
from a wide range of grape varieties. These styles include the 
following:
 
✓ Late-harvest wines: By the time the grapes for late-harvest 
wines are harvested, they’ve become so ripe on the vine that 
some of their sugar remains in the wine after fermentation. 
They’re usually white wines from aromatic varieties such as 
Riesling, Gewurztraminer, and Sauvignon Blanc.
 
✓ Botrytised wines: Botrytised wines are late-harvest wines 
whose grapes were attacked by botrytis, a fungus that concen-
trates the grapes’ sugar. In France’s Sauternes region and in 
Germany’s greatest Riesling vineyards, the botrytis attack 
occurs naturally when just the right combination of sunshine 
and humidity exists. In California, botrytis sometimes occurs 
naturally, and some wineries introduce botrytis to the grapes 
after harvest.
 
 The grape varieties for botrytised wines include Riesling, 
Sauvignon Blanc, and Semillon. Dolce by Far Niente and 
Robert Mondavi Sauvignon Blanc Botrytis are two of the 
state’s most respected botrytised dessert wines.
 
✓ Alcohol-added wines: Alcohol-added (fortified) wines are 
sweet because the winemaker adds neutral alcohol to them 
during fermentation, killing the yeasts and therefore leaving 
sugar in the wines. They can be white or red. Quady’s 
Essencia, from the Muscat grape, is an excellent wine in this 
category.

Part III: More Reds, Whites, Pinks and Bubblies 
216
 
✓ Port-style wines: These are sweet alcohol-added wines made 
in the manner of Portugal’s famous red Port wines: Alcohol 
is added to the wine during the early stages of fermentation 
to preserve natural grape sweetness, and the wine is subse-
quently aged in wood for varying periods, depending on the 
specific style of Port being made. Styles vary from young to 
aged and from simple to complex.
 
 Port-style wines sometimes come from native Portuguese 
varieties grown in California, such as Touriga Nacional 
and Tinta Roriz, and in other cases come from Zinfandel, 
Charbono, Petite Sirah, or even Cabernet. Quady, Prager Port 
Works, Perry Creek, and Brutocao are top producers. Plenty 
of really inexpensive California “Ports” exist as well.
 
✓ Sherry-type wines: These are alcohol-added white wines that 
can be sweet or dry (when dry, they fall into the category of 
aperitif wines, for pre-dinner). Sweet Sherries actually ferment 
to dryness and are subsequently fortified with alcohol and 
sweetened.
 
 Some styles have a yeasty character from a film of yeast 
that forms on the wine’s surface as it ages in barrels. Other 
styles have a rich, nutty, and dried-fruit aroma and flavor 
that occurs when the wine is exposed to oxygen as it ferments 
and ages.
 
 The best wines come from the Palomino grape that’s used 
to make Sherry in its home region in Spain. Inexpensive 
versions come from more common grapes, such as Thompson 
Seedless. Sherry-type wines are usually not vintage-dated.
 
Dessert wines often come in half-bottles that contain 375 milliliters 
(compared to normal 750-ml wine bottles), and many of the best of 
them cost as much as you’d expect to pay for a full-size bottle of 
wine. But the extra cost is worth it. These wines go a long way: 
Generally, you have a smaller serving that you would of a table 
wine — about 2 or 3 ounces — because they’re so very rich. 
Skimping on price will give you a wine that has sweetness and 
flavor but not the special quality that comes from using the best 
grapes and from the handcrafted winemaking processes that the 
top wineries employ.

▶ Which wines age well
▶ Good years for wine
I
f it hadn’t been for sharing California wines, we might not be 
a couple today. True, we met at a dinner that featured Italian 
white wines, and our first date was a tasting of great Champagnes 
(French, of course). But in those early days, when we ate in, the 
wines were often special California Chardonnays, Cabernets, or 
Zinfandels from Ed’s private stash. They captivated us, helped us 
delight in our meals together, and solidified new and old friend-
ships with other wine lovers.
Great California wines also proved to us the wisdom of laying 
down special bottles to enjoy in the future — not only for the fond 
memories they bring but also for the fascinating discovery of how 
they age with time (or remain ageless, as is sometimes the case). 
To experience more great bottles in the future, we discovered 
which wines, in which vintages, were most reliable agers.
Enjoying California’s wine bounty doesn’t require older vintages or 
special, expensive wines or even, for that matter, particular types 
of food. But all those factors can be part of the fun. In this chapter, 
we offer suggestions for pairing California wines with food. We then 
delve into the topic of which California wines age best, followed by a 
discussion of the current state of recent California vintages.

Matching Wines to Foods
We spend plenty of time each month doing comparative wine-
tastings, in which we sample similar wines side-by-side without 
food to experience the essential character of each wine. Such tast-
ings serve a purpose for wine professionals. And they can be fun, 
because the clinical atmosphere brings out aspects of the wine 
that we might not notice otherwise. But that’s no way to appreci-
ate wine. Wine and food, on the table, together — now that’s real 
fun, and you can do it on a daily basis! The nagging question, of 
course, is which type of wine to have with which type of food.
You could make an argument that a food-friendly wine is one that 
doesn’t have much flavor to compete with the flavors in the food 
you plan to eat — a wine that just hangs in the background and 
offers refreshing acidity to cleanse your taste buds between bites 
of food. California doesn’t make many wines like that (though some 
Pinot Grigios are an exception). The food-friendly currency that 
California wines trade in is flavor, lots of flavor, and a dynamic 
personality in the meal.
Dishes that are flavorful — the kind of foods that we Americans eat 
on a regular basis — require flavorful wines that don’t wimp out 
next to the food’s flavor. If that’s the kind of food that you enjoy, 
you’re ready to experiment with California wines on your table.
Elements of the match
The key to pairing wine and food, in our opinion, is not so much 
matching the specific flavors of the food and the wine — echoing the 
delicate fresh herbs and lemon on sautéed fish fillets with a herbal-
tasting, citrusy Sauvignon Blanc, for example — as matching the 
food’s flavor intensity with that of the wine. After all, many California 
Sauvignon Blancs are likely to be so intense in flavor that they over-
whelm the flavor of the fish itself.
 
Although most California wines are flavorful, some are more so 
than others; here are some generalizations about the flavor inten-
sity of specific types of California wine (refer to Chapters 5 to 10 
for information on the various wines):
 
✓ Very flavorful whites: Richly oaky or richly fruity 
Chardonnays, most Sauvignon Blancs, Rieslings, Viogniers, 
and most Gewurztraminers
 
✓ Less flavorful whites: Most Pinot Grigio/Gris wines, most 
unoaked or subtly oaked Chardonnays, Rhône-style whites 
other than Viognier, and Pinot Blancs

 Chapter 12: Pairing and Sharing California Wines 221
 
✓ Very flavorful reds: Pinot Noirs, most Syrah/Shiraz wines, 
Zinfandels, and Petite Sirahs
 
✓ Less flavorful reds: Cal-Ital reds, many blended Rhône-style 
wines, Merlots, many Cabernets, and many Bordeaux-type 
blends
 
We also like to match the weight of the dish with the weight of the 
wine: The more substantial the food, the fuller-bodied and more 
substantial the wine should be. Using the weight of your dish as a 
guide, you can decide whether to serve a white, rosé, or red wine 
from California:
 
✓ Substantial choices: Red wines are generally more substantial 
than white wines, so they’re the more logical choice with 
heavy meat and game dishes, meaty pasta entrees, and bean-
based meals.
 
✓ Lighter choices: White wines generally complement lighter 
dishes, such as salads, fish, omelets, and light poultry dishes.
 
✓ In-between options: The heaviest white wines, the lightest 
red wines, and rosé wines straddle red-wine and white-wine 
territory and can go well with many dishes in both realms.
Two other factors that can affect your decision of what to drink 
with what food are sweetness in the wine and the tannin level of 
the wine. A wine with some sweetness can use a dish with fruity 
elements or elements of sweetness, such as balsamic vinegar. Very 
tannic red wines can match well with protein-rich foods such as 
rare beef or hard cheeses.
The serving-temperature factor
You might already know the usual advice: Serve red wines cool and white wines 
cooler but not very cold. A cool temperature is particularly important for California 
wines because the wines are often very high in alcohol, and the sensation of the 
high alcohol — which some people perceive as a burning sensation — diminishes 
when the wine is cool. Of course, cool temperatures can also reduce the intensity 
of flavor that you perceive, but given the high flavor quotient of most California 
wines, the wines still have plenty of flavor.
Bottles of red wine should be cool to the touch, and white wines, cold to the touch — 
but not so cold that moisture condenses on your wine glass when you pour the wine.

If you’re thinking that this system of pairing California wine and 
food involves a bit of trial and error, you’re right. Because every 
dish is different in its ingredients and preparation, and because 
every wine tastes at least slightly different from others of its type, 
no one can guarantee how well any one wine will go with any one 
dish. To us, that’s part of the fun of sitting down to dinner with 
wine. It’s a fresh adventure every evening.
 
Above all, your personal taste, not what other people tell you, 
must dictate your final choice of wine. We know people who 
always drink white wine, no matter what the food, because that’s 
what they enjoy most. And although we would never pair White 
Zinfandel with pot roast, we believe that you should absolutely do 
that if you enjoy the combination.
Try this with that: Wine pairings 
for specific foods
 
Strict rules about wine and food pairings aren’t valid, because 
everyone is ultimately guided by his or her own taste. But certain 
combinations of food and wine just seem to be naturals. Here are 
some of our favorite food pairings for California wines:
 
✓ Egg and mushroom dishes: Fine California sparkling wines
 
✓ Cobb salad: California Sauvignon Blanc
 
✓ Brie cheese: Viognier
 
✓ Pan-fried fillet of flounder: Pinot Blanc
 
✓ Broiled lobster: Oaky, flavorful California Chardonnay
 
✓ Thanksgiving turkey: California Pinot Noir (Choose a Pinot Noir 
that isn’t very oaky or one that has lots of fresh fruitiness — as 
opposed to jammy fruitiness — to balance its oaky character); 
as an alternative, Barbera
 
✓ Spicy chili or other fiery foods: Syrah/Shiraz or Petite Sirah 
(The key in matching red wines with spicy dishes is a high 
degree of fruitiness in the wine and relatively low tannin 
levels; choose inexpensive Shirazes, and choose Petite Sirahs 
in the less powerful style.)
 
✓ Grilled vegetables: Red Zinfandel, Syrah, or a red Rhône-style 
blend
 
✓ Barbecue ribs: Red Zinfandel
 
✓ Black-pepper steak (steak au poivre): Cabernet Sauvignon

 Chapter 12: Pairing and Sharing California Wines 223
 
✓ Turkey burgers: A fruity Pinot Noir or a low-tannin red such 
as an inexpensive Shiraz
 
✓ Pizza with red sauce: A flavorful type of wine such as Syrah 
or Barbera (The cheesier the pizza, the more tannic the wine 
can be)
Aging and Collecting 
California Wines
 
You do not need to age your California wines to enjoy them! We’ll 
say that again: It’s perfectly okay to drink California wines without 
waiting for them to “come around.” This is true for the vast major-
ity of wines from the Golden State.
So why this section on aging and collecting California wines? 
Because some California wines do improve over time, and some 
people (we’re two of them) enjoy laying wines down to enjoy in 
the future. If you have no interest in that activity, please fell free to 
skip ahead to our more general advice about recent vintages later 
in this chapter.
The right glass for the wine
We’re firm believers in using good glassware for tasting and drinking wines. In fact, 
we admit to being a bit fanatical on this topic. Over dinner, it’s not unusual for us to 
change the type of glass several times before we decide on the right glass for the 
wine we’re drinking.
Over the years, we’ve come up with some general guidelines for choosing wine 
glasses. First, use high-quality glasses from a reputable producer who specializes 
in wine glasses. Also, note that large glasses invariably work better than small 
glasses. Here’s how we match glass shape to various types of wines:
 ✓ For Cabernet Sauvignons, Merlots, Syrahs, Zinfandels, and Sauvignon Blancs, 
we generally prefer a glass with a large, fairly straight-sided bowl, commonly 
known as a Bordeaux glass.
 ✓ For Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays, we prefer a large, wider-bowled, apple-
shaped glass, commonly known as a Burgundy glass.
 ✓ For sparkling wines, we use a large, elongated tulip-shaped glass rather than 
the narrow, flute-shaped glass that’s fairly common for bubbly wines.
The more that you pay attention to the wine you taste, the more you notice the dif-
ference that the glassware makes. For more info on the right wine glass, refer to 
our book, Wine For Dummies, 4th Edition (Wiley).

224
When we first started collecting wines in the 1970s, we were a bit 
wary of collecting California wines because nobody knew how 
the wines would age. California wines didn’t have the same kind 
of track record as wines from the world’s classic regions, such as 
Bordeaux and Burgundy (France), Germany, Piedmont (Italy), or 
the Douro (home of Vintage Port, in Portugal). But our experiences 
over the years became that track record. We can now state with 
confidence that certain California wines age remarkably well. This 
is true especially in the “better” vintages — those years in which 
climatic conditions were superb. In this section, we name the 
California wines that age well — and in fact improve with aging — 
and the wines to drink soon rather than lay down for aging.
 
All our discussions about older wines and aging wines are based 
on the presumption that the wines have aged in proper conditions, 
such as a temperature-controlled cellar or a special wine-storage 
refrigeration unit. (For detailed information on how to keep wine 
under proper conditions, refer to Wine For Dummies, 4th edition.)
How different varietal wines age
Generally speaking, California red wines age much better than 
California whites. For practical reasons, we discuss only the six 
major California varietal wines here:
 
✓ Cabernet Sauvignon: Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet blends 
are definitely California’s longest-lived wines, by a wide margin. 
We’ve recently tasted California Cabs from 1970 and 1974 that 
are perfect to drink now and still have some years left in them. 
Even those California Cabernets from the 1940s, 1950s, and 
1960s that we’ve tasted were mostly still fine to drink. But of 
course, not every California Cabernet will age well; only certain 
wines from the better vintages can stand the test of time.
 
✓ Zinfandel: Red Zinfandels definitely age well; we’ve tasted 
30-year-old Zinfandels that were delicious. But Zinfandel does 
lose its characteristic berry-like flavor with time and in fact 
comes to resemble Cabernet Sauvignon. If you like the taste of 
young Zinfandel, we recommend that you drink up your Zins 
within 15 years.
 
✓ Merlot: Not many California Merlots have been around long; 
before 1985, most winemakers used Merlot mainly as a blend-
ing wine. Generally, California Merlots are ready to drink sooner 
than California Cabernets; they’re usually softer, fruitier, and less 
tannic than Cabernets. We believe that most Merlots will not age 
as long as Cabernets and are at their best within the first 12 to 15 
years. Some Merlots that we’ve tried from the 1980s, however, 
have aged well.

 Chapter 12: Pairing and Sharing California Wines 225
 
✓ Pinot Noir: We’ve tasted wonderful 20-plus-year-old California 
Pinot Noirs. But generally speaking, Pinot Noir wines from 
a fairly low-tannin variety don’t age as long as Cabernet 
Sauvignons. To be on the safe side, we generally prefer to 
drink California Pinots that are less than 10 years old so that 
all the wonderful, fresh aromas and flavors inherent in this 
variety are still at their peak.
 
✓ Chardonnay: A few of the very best California Chardonnays 
can age and even improve with up to 15 years of aging — 
the likes of Hanzell, Long Vineyards, Mount Eden, Matanzas 
Creek, and Stony Hill, for example. But generally speaking, 
California Chardonnays more than 10 years old disappoint us. 
We recommend that you drink Chardonnays within 10 years 
of the vintage — with the exception of those few Chardonnays 
that have a proven track record for aging.
 
✓ Sauvignon Blanc: California Sauvignon Blancs for the most 
part are best when they’re young and fresh; most will not age 
well or improve after 5 or 6 years. Of course, there are excep-
tions: Robert Mondavi’s very limited-production “I-Block” 
To Kalon Vineyard Fumé Blanc — from a vineyard planted in 
1945, the oldest Sauvignon Blanc vineyard in the U.S. — can 
probably age for decades. Mayacamas Vineyards also makes a 
long-lived Sauvignon Blanc.
We’ve had limited experience with aged California sparkling wines 
because they haven’t been around that long. Certainly, the better 
California bruts — such as Roederer Estate L’Ermitage and Iron 
Horse Late Disgorged Brut — can age well for 15 years or more.
California wines that have aged well
In California’s fairly short wine history, only two varietal wines — 
Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel — have established a clear record 
of aging well for 20 years or more. In this section, we name some 
specific wines that have stood the test of time.
Age-worthy Cabernet Sauvignons
Almost all California wines with a history of long aging are Cabernet 
Sauvignons from Napa Valley. We name here some Napa Valley 
Cabernet Sauvignons and Cabernet blends that have aged well in the 
past — and that, in current vintages, are still age-worthy wines:
 
✓ Beaulieu Vineyards, Georges de Latour Private Reserve: 
Since the first vintage in 1936, BV Private Reserve can boast 
a string of remarkable vintages. The 1951 and 1968 Private 
Reserves are among the greatest California wines ever 
produced. Also memorable are the 1970 and 1974.

Part IV: Enjoying California Wines  
226
 
✓ Heitz Wine Cellars, Martha’s Vineyard: This is one of 
California’s classic single-vineyard Cabernet Sauvignons, 
noted for its unique aroma of eucalyptus. Memorable vintages 
of Martha’s Vineyard include the 1968, 1969, and 1974. Other 
age-worthy Heitz single-vineyard Cabernets are the Bella Oaks 
and Trailside Vineyard Cabs.
 
✓ Robert Mondavi Reserve: Robert Mondavi Reserve is pro-
duced from some of Napa Valley’s finest vineyards. The 1968, 
1969, and 1974 have been among California’s best Cabernets, 
and the exemplary 2005 Mondavi Reserve Cab confirms the 
continuing excellence of this Cabernet Sauvignon.
 
✓ Mayacamas Vineyards: This mountain winery has always 
been renowned for its long-lasting Cabernet Sauvignons. Its 
1970 and 1974 are still showing well.
Here are some other Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignons/Cab blends 
that have aged well but hold slightly shorter track records:
 
✓ Anderson’s Conn Valley
 
✓ Araujo Estate, Eisele Vineyard
 
✓ Beringer Private Reserve
 
✓ Cain Cellars “Cain Five”
 
✓ Cakebread Cellars
 
✓ Chappellet “Signature”
 
✓ Chateau Montelena
 
✓ Clos du Val
 
✓ Diamond Creek (all its Cabernets)
 
✓ Dominus Estate
 
✓ Dunn Vineyards, Howell Mountain
 
✓ Far Niente
 
✓ Forman Vineyard
 
✓ Freemark Abbey, Bosché and Sycamore Vineyards
 
✓ Frog’s Leap
 
✓ Grgich Hills
 
✓ Hess Collection
 
✓ Joseph Phelps, “Insignia” and Backus Vineyard
 
✓ Opus One
 
✓ Rubicon Estate

 Chapter 12: Pairing and Sharing California Wines 227
 
✓ Shafer Vineyards
 
✓ Spottswoode
 
✓ Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars “Cask 23”
 
✓ Trefethen
Outside of Napa Valley, two California Cabernet Sauvignons that 
have proven to age extremely well are the Laurel Glen “Estate” 
(Sonoma Mountain) and Ridge Vineyards “Monte Bello” (Santa 
Cruz Mountains). Ridge Vineyards has a track record of making 
fine Cabernet Sauvignons that dates back to the 1960s. Its 1970, 
1971, and 1974 Monte Bello Cabernets are legendary.
Age-worthy Zinfandels
Besides Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab blends, the only other 
California wine with a significant track record for aging well is red 
Zinfandel. Most of the better red Zins are good agers. The two cur-
rent Zinfandel producers with the finest and longest track records 
for aging are Ravenswood and Ridge Vineyards.
Joel Peterson, winemaker at Ravenswood, worked with iconic 
Zinfandel/Pinot Noir producer Joseph Swan in the 1970s. From 
Peterson’s first Zinfandel in 1976, it was clear that he had the touch 
for making great red Zins. Ravenswood’s finest single-vineyard Zin, in 
our opinion, is probably the Old Hill Vineyard, from Sonoma Valley.
Paul Draper, CEO and chief winemaker at Ridge Vineyards, is 
equally renowned for Cabernet and Zinfandel. Ridge’s great-
est Zinfandel — and the one with the longest track record — is 
Geyserville, a Zinfandel blend. Ridge produces about seven other 
fine Zinfandels, including the excellent “Lytton Springs.”
A. Rafanelli and Rosenblum Cellars are two other Zinfandel produc-
ers making age-worthy red Zins.
Vintage Variations in California
The quality of the vintage year is not so vitally important in 
California as it is in European wine regions such as Bordeaux, 
Burgundy, Piedmont, and Tuscany, because those regions can 
have more dramatic swings in temperature and rainfall from year 
to year. Rain and hail, typical problems in Europe, seldom occur 
during California’s growing season.

Part IV: Enjoying California Wines  
228
But it’s not true that vintages don’t matter in California. In some 
vintages, California’s weather can be too hot, whereas in other 
years, it’s quite cool. At times, spring frost can occur and impact 
the quality of the grapes.
Cool versus warm vintages
A year’s relative warmth or coolness determines which varieties do 
well in that particular vintage. Here’s how various grapes generally 
perform, depending on average temperatures during the growing 
season:
 
✓ Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Syrah, and Merlot do better in cooler 
vintages.
 
✓ Zinfandel likes warmer years.
 
✓ Cabernet Sauvignon is like Goldilocks: It likes the temperature 
“just right” — not too hot but not too cool.
 
We are firmly convinced that California’s best vintages for its most 
important wines — with the exception of Zinfandel — are its cooler 
years, such as 2005. We have tasted some remarkably fine 2005 
Cabernet Sauvignons, Pinot Noirs, and Chardonnays, for example, 
and we recommend buying the 2005 wines. (Coincidentally, it’s 
also an excellent vintage in Bordeaux and Burgundy.) In the last 25 
years, only 1991 and 1985, both cool vintages in California, are in the 
same league as 2005 for general excellence. But thanks to continual 
improvements in winemaking and viticulture, 2005 might prove to 
be even better than the earlier cool vintages. The 2006 vintage was 
fairly cool but warmer than 2005. We think that 2006 will generally 
prove to be a very good vintage as well.
In warm vintages, the wines often show well at first because 
they’re rich and opulent, with higher than usual alcohol, but they 
age rapidly. The 1997 vintage is a classic example of the downside 
of warm-climate vintages: Most of the 1997 wines have faded. In 
our opinion, most of the wines produced in California from 2002 
through 2004 also won’t age well. For us, the 2005 vintage has been 
a refreshing change of pace for California wines.
Our California vintage ratings
In this section, we characterize California wine vintages back to 
1990. We base our vintage preferences primarily on California’s 
North Coast — Napa Valley, Sonoma, Mendocino, and Lake 
Counties — because there’s generally more vintage variation in the 
North Coast than in the Central Coast.

 Chapter 12: Pairing and Sharing California Wines 229
Vintages from 2001 to 2007
Our remarks about vintages are generalizations, and they don’t 
apply to every wine. We rate California’s recent vintages with stars 
to indicate our appraisal of the quality of the wines in that year, up 
to four stars for the best vintages:
 
✓ 2007: It’s too early for a final judgment, but 2007 is shaping up 
as a good vintage, if not a great one. It was warmer than 2005 
and 2006 but not overly warm. Rating: No rating yet
 
✓ 2006: Generally a very good year, 2006 was not as cool as 
2005 and therefore is better than 2005 for Zinfandel. Pinot 
Noir and Chardonnay are good but not quite as good as in 
2005. For Cabernet Sauvignon, 2006 appears to be as good as 
2005 and in some cases, better. But the 2006 wines seem to be 
precocious — they’ll generally be ready sooner than the 2005s 
and might not have the great longevity of wines from 2005. 
Rating: 
 
✓ 2005: Our kind of vintage! The year 2005 was generally very cool 
for California, which resulted in a much longer growing season 
than usual. It was truly excellent for Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and 
Syrah. And 2005 was also very good for Cabernet Sauvignon; the 
wines will be long-lasting. Only Zinfandel didn’t do well in this 
super-cool (for California) vintage. We believe that 2005 could 
turn out to be California’s best vintage of the past 30 years. 
Rating: 
 
✓ 2004: This was a very warm year producing ripe, preco-
cious wines generally high in alcohol. It was generally too 
hot for producing delicate, well-balanced Pinot Noirs and 
Chardonnays. Zinfandels fared better in 2004 than other vari-
eties. If you enjoy big, fleshy, opulent Cabernet Sauvignons, 
this is the vintage for you. Rating: 
 
✓ 2003: This year was generally even hotter than 2004, and 
wine quality is inconsistent. Only Cabernet Sauvignons from 
cooler areas will have any longevity. It wasn’t a good year for 
most Pinot Noirs or Chardonnays, but 2003 was a fine year for 
Zinfandel. Not a favorite vintage for us. Rating: 
 
✓ 2002: Another very warm vintage producing very ripe wines 
with limited aging potential. Only the very best Cabernet 
Sauvignons, Cabernet blends, and Merlots will age well. 
Generally, 2002 is a vintage to drink now. Rating: 
 
✓ 2001: This was the first in a string of four warm vintages, but 
it’s the best of the four. We’ve tasted several 2001 Cabernet 
Sauvignons and Cabernet blends that have been excellent for 
current drinking but will still age well for several more years. 
Wines from other varieties are ready now. Rating: For Cabernet 
Sauvignons and Cabernet blends, 
 to 
; for all 
other wines,

Vintages from 1990 to 2000
Going back in time to vintages before 2001 is an exercise that 
applies primarily to Cabernet Sauvignons and Cabernet blends, 
because these are the California wines that age the best and 
improve with aging. Only 1991 is a four-star vintage in this group:
 
✓ 2000: Mediocre vintage; not for aging
 
✓ 1999: The best vintage from 1997 through 2000; Cabernets are 
drinking well now but will keep for five years or more
 
✓ 1998: Average year; drink now
 
✓ 1997: Precocious, overhyped vintage; most ’97s are showing 
their age
 
✓ 1996: Good vintage; ready to drink
 
✓ 1995: Very fine, underrated; many wines still need time
 
✓ 1994: Good vintage, season a bit warm; drink now
 
✓ 1993: Average vintage; drink now
 
✓ 1992: Fairly good vintage; ready to drink
 
✓ 1991: Cool vintage; the best wines are excellent; many still 
need time 
 
✓ 1990: Opulent vintage; these wines were very good through-
out the ’90s but are now showing their age

Making a Winery Pilgrimage
In This Chapter
▶ Going on a winery tour and visiting the tasting room
▶ Staying suitably sober as you learn about wine
▶ Getting your wine purchases home
E
ven though wine is our business and visiting wineries is tech-
nically work for us, we continue to tour wineries with excite-
ment and enthusiasm. The reason is that trips to wine regions bring 
a special dimension to the understanding and appreciation of wine. 
Sampling a wine at a wine-tasting or drinking it with dinner is great, 
but seeing the wine region, walking into the winery, meeting the 
people who work at the winery — these are experiences that bring 
a wine alive forever after. Every time we visit wineries, we remem-
ber that wine is much more than just a beverage: It’s a product of 
nature and of people who have real passion for what they do and 
where they do it.
Because wine is a technical subject and because wine contains 
alcohol, of course, visiting wineries and tasting the wines takes 
some advance planning. Should you hire a car and driver? How can 
you manage not to sound as inexperienced as you might think you 
are? In this chapter, we give you some tips about the ins and outs 
of the winery visit so your memories will be happy ones.
Knowing What to Expect 
on the Winery Visit
When you visit a winery in California, you can be sure of one thing, 
no matter which wine region you choose to visit: The scenery will 
be beautiful. Beyond that, the experience can differ quite a lot from 
one region to another and even from one winery to another within 
the same region. Some regions, such as Napa Valley, have wineries 
with very sophisticated facilities and programs for visitors. Other 
regions have wineries that for the most part greet visitors with a 
more down-home approach. Both experiences can be wonderful.

Part IV: Enjoying California Wines  
232
For some people, visiting a winery is all about tasting the wines, 
buying a few bottles to take home, and browsing the gift shop. For 
other people, a tour of the facilities is the key attraction. In this 
section, we discuss both aspects of the winery visit.
 
Hours and procedures vary from winery to winery, so check out 
the winery’s visitor information before you go. Some wineries wel-
come visitors by appointment only. Other wineries have regularly 
scheduled tours that you can participate in, but it’s a good idea to 
know when the tours start. Some wineries charge for tours, and 
others do not. Some wineries have shorter tasting room hours in 
the off-season. For some winery resources that can help you find 
the info you need, see the later section “Gather specific info on 
winery visits.”
The winery tour
A winery tour is a behind-the-scenes look at the processes that 
turn the grapes into wine. Some wineries start their tours in the 
vineyards just outside the winery. If they do, you might also see 
the outdoor receiving area, where grape growers deposit the har-
vested grapes.
However, most tours focus on the internal part of the winery. You 
might see the crushes or presses (machines that convert the whole 
grapes into a semi-liquid or liquid form suitable for fermentation), 
and you get to see fermentation vessels (huge stainless steel tanks, 
generally) where the grape juice becomes wine. You follow the 
progress of a white wine and/or a red wine from the fermentation 
tanks to the aging vessels, which can be either tanks or oak barrels; 
some wineries have special rooms full of barrels for aging their red 
wines. And you might see the bottling room, where the wine enters 
the bottles and where the corks, labels, and other packaging are 
affixed to the bottle.
Someone from the winery guides you through this tour and explains 
what happens at every stage, giving you a history of the winery and 
its wines along the way. Often, you’re part of a small group with 
other visitors. The tour guide welcomes your questions. Depending 
on the size of the winery and the number of questions that you or 
other people in your group ask, the tour can last about 20 minutes 
to more than half an hour.
To some extent, you see pretty much the same thing at every winery. 
But if you’re the curious type and are eager to learn, you’ll pick 
up new information at each winery and gain new insights into the 
winemaking process. In any case, winemaking is complex, and you 
most likely won’t understand everything from just one winery tour.

 Chapter 13: Making a Winery Pilgrimage 233
The only part of winery tours that can tend to become repetitive 
is the bottling line. A common refrain among wine writers touring 
wineries as a group is “when you’ve seen one bottling line, you’ve 
seen them all!”
The tasting room and shop
Your tour of the winery usually ends at the winery tasting room. 
If you prefer not to tour the winery or if a tour isn’t available, the 
tasting room is the place you spend all your time during your visit.
The tasting room, which can be very simple or very elaborate, 
is the winery’s reception area for visitors. You’ll see a bar where 
samples of the winery’s wines are available for tasting. The people 
behind the bar who pour the samples are usually knowledgeable 
about their wines. These people might also be knowledgeable 
about wine in general, depending on the individual. Tastes of non-
alcoholic beverages, such as grape juice, are usually also available 
for children or nondrinkers.
Art and wine in Napa Valley
Many beautiful wineries exist in Napa Valley — Opus One and Rubicon Estate 
come to mind — but two wineries have gone out of their way not only to create 
impressive wineries but also to fill those wineries with magnificent artwork. The 
two are The Hess Collection and Clos Pegase.
Donald Hess, a Swiss industrialist and art collector, opened his stunning winery, 
located in Mount Veeder, high up in the Mayacamas Mountains in 1986. The Hess 
Collection Winery (www.hesscollection.com) is best known for its exceptional 
Cabernet Sauvignons and Chardonnays, and that’s a good enough reason to visit the 
winery. But the winery also displays about 20 percent of Donald Hess’s modern art 
collection (the rest is in various museums around the world). For art lovers who are 
also wine lovers, or vice versa, The Hess Collection is a memorable place to visit.
Clos Pegase’s founder, Jan Schrem, made his fortune in the publishing business in 
Japan. His wife had converted him into a wine lover, and Jan combined his love of 
art and wine to build a strikingly beautiful winery south of Calistoga, off Route 29, 
which was completed in 1987 (www.clospegase.com). All of Clos Pegase’s wines 
are estate-bottled, and Chardonnay is its signature wine. The winery is filled with 
art treasures, with an emphasis on sculpture. Guided tours are available every day 
at 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m., free of charge; reservations aren’t necessary except for 
large groups. Along with The Hess Collection, it’s a must-see wine destination in 
Napa Valley.

Tasting fees
Many years ago, you could taste wines in tasting rooms for no 
charge, but today the norm is to charge visitors a small fee for 
each taste, varying from a couple of dollars up to $10 for very 
special expensive wines. Sometimes wineries charge you for the 
glass that you taste in instead of charging for the wine, and you get 
to keep the glass. Sometimes you can apply the entire tasting fee 
toward the cost of a bottle that you purchase.
Choosing wines to taste
Depending on how many wines a winery has, certain wines might 
be available on certain days, or all the wines might be available for 
tasting all the time. Sometimes instead of tasting the wines one by 
one, you can taste a flight of wines, a group of several wines (gener-
ally three or four) that you sample side-by-side to understand the 
differences among them.
Usually, the tasting room personnel expect you to request a par-
ticular wine or type of wine to taste. Their goal is to serve you 
something that you’ll like so you’ll decide to purchase that wine. 
Be prepared to discuss your likes and dislikes in wine so they can 
help you find a wine that excites you.
Special offers
 
Many wineries have certain wines that they sell only in their tast-
ing room, not in wine shops or restaurants. These wines are usu-
ally small-production items, such as wines from unusual grape 
varieties or experimental blends. It’s a good idea to ask whether 
any such wines are available, because this is your only chance to 
taste them — and you sound like an insider for asking.
While you’re at it, ask whether the winery has a wine club. Wine 
clubs are mailing lists of wine drinkers to whom the winery makes 
special offers from time to time (for instance, the winery might 
give them the opportunity to buy tasting-room-only wines or to 
attend special events). Usually membership is free, with no com-
mitment on your part to buy wines. You wouldn’t want to belong 
to the wine club of every winery that you visit, we imagine, but if 
you really take to a winery and its wines, joining its wine club can 
be a good way to stay connected to that winery.
The gift shop
In those parts of California where brisk winery tourism exists, 
the tasting room also houses a gift shop. The gift shops can be 
terrific. The first things we look for are our own wine books (just 

 Chapter 13: Making a Winery Pilgrimage 235
checking!), and then we browse all the wine gadgets (corkscrews, 
no-drip pouring aids, coasters, and the like), glassware, aprons, 
t-shirts and other clothing, and baseball caps. These items can be 
great mementos of your visit, not to mention thoughtful gifts for 
the person who is watching your kids at home.
Do’s and Don’ts for Visitors
We’ve never worked at a winery or done stints pouring wine in 
tasting rooms, but we have visited enough wineries over the years 
that we have a good idea of which behaviors work and which ones 
don’t work for visitors to wineries. Here we offer some suggestions 
to help you get the most out of your excursions in California wine 
country.
Discover something new
Everyone at every winery you visit wants you to have such a good 
time that you’ll tell everyone back home about the experience and 
feel connected to that winery for years to come. But hospitality 
isn’t the only service that wineries offer you: They also offer infor-
mation and the opportunity to expand your knowledge of wine 
(specifically their own wines, of course).
 
The best visitor is a curious visitor. Your own knowledge of wine 
isn’t important. What’s important is your willingness to learn. 
Don’t be afraid to ask questions for fear of sounding ignorant.
You’re not the only one who benefits from conversation with the 
pourers. The tasting room staff is a source of valuable feedback 
for the management of the winery regarding how acceptable their 
wines are to the general public. They want to know your likes and 
dislikes about their wines and about wine in general.
Enter into a conversation with those who are serving wines in the 
tasting room, assuming they’re not crazy busy. Tell them what you 
like in wine and what you don’t. Give them your honest (and polite) 
reaction to the wines that you taste. If you really find a particular 
wine too dry or too tannic, tell them so, and they can then steer 
you to one of their wines that you’ll like more. Ask what specifi-
cally makes one wine work for you and not the other; you could 
discover something about your own palate that will help you in all 
your future wine buying.

Part IV: Enjoying California Wines  
236
Here are some more questions that you can ask in a tasting room 
to help you gather information and understand wine better:
 
✓ How do your wines differ from other wines of this area?
 
✓ In what ways do your wines reflect the region(s) where the 
grapes grow?
 
✓ Is your winery experimenting with any unusual grape varieties? 
Why that variety?
 
✓ Which of your wines is the most versatile with food, and why 
do you think that is?
 
✓ How would you rate the vintage of this wine?
You can also ask questions about the quantity of wine that the 
winery produces (the number of cases) and whether the winery 
has a distributor in your home state.
 
Don’t trust your memory regarding your impressions of the wines 
you taste. Jot down your impressions as you taste the wines. Most 
tasting rooms provide you with a list of their wines that you can 
use for this purpose.
Embrace the etiquette of 
tasting and spitting
Part of wine tasting (at least if you’re tasting to learn) is spitting 
the wine back out. You might find the idea of spitting out wine to 
be not only distasteful but also wasteful. We urge you to recon-
sider that position when you’re planning your winery visits. After 
swallowing just four or five tastes of wine, most people begin to 
feel the alcohol. At first that’s relaxing and pleasant, of course, but 
it quickly leads to a loss of focus on the business at hand and even-
tually an awkward situation for all involved.
Spitting wine samples in winery tasting rooms is absolutely 
acceptable — more than acceptable, in fact: You set yourself apart 
as someone experienced in tasting wines for learning purposes.
Ideally, you should spit all the wines you taste. Swallow only when 
a wine is so compelling that it’s down the hatch before you even 
realize it! (And then buy that wine.)

 Chapter 13: Making a Winery Pilgrimage 237
 
If you don’t see containers for spitting, ask for a cup or other con-
tainer to use as a spittoon. We actually carry disposable 12-ounce 
plastic cups with us, because they make ideal individual spittoons. 
You can hold the cup right up to your mouth to spit discreetly 
and then empty the cup from time to time into a ceramic pitcher 
or other larger container where people are dumping their leftover 
wine. (If you feel insecure about spitting, practice spitting water at 
home in front of a mirror. And be assured that every respectable 
tasting room has napkins available for the errant dribble or spill.)
A quick primer on how to taste wine
Tasting wine is a slower, more deliberate and more thoughtful process than simply 
drinking wine. Wine is a complex beverage, and when you simply drink it as you 
would any other beverage, you miss the wine’s nuances. Here’s a quick lesson on 
what to do to when you want to taste a wine the way the pros do. You don’t have 
to use this procedure with every sip, all the time — just when you want to really 
examine the taste of a particular wine. With practice, describing what you smell 
and taste in a wine becomes easier — and it becomes a lot of fun, too!
 1. Smell the wine.
 
 Rotate your (half-full) glass on the table so that the wine swishes around in the 
glass and mixes with air. As soon as you stop moving the glass, bring it to your 
nose (stick your nose into the air space above the wine) and inhale. Notice how 
strong or subtle the wine’s aroma is; then try to describe in your mind what you 
smell. Common descriptors include all sorts of fruits, floral notes, spices, herbs, 
and so forth.
 2. Taste the wine.
 
 Take a medium-sized sip of the wine. Move it around your mouth and notice 
its texture (whether it feels soft or firm or rough — thinking of how different 
fabrics feel can be helpful). Also note its weight, or body (how heavy or light it 
feels on your tongue). Open your lips slightly and draw some air in to release 
the wine’s flavors; describe in your mind how flavorful the wine is (or isn’t) and 
which specific flavors you notice. Often, the flavors are similar to the aromas 
you smelled.
 3. Swallow or spit.
 
 If you’re tasting several wines, we suggest you do what the pros do and spit the 
wine out to keep your head clear. But if you’re tasting just a single wine, swal-
lowing is fine. As the wine leaves your mouth, notice whether the wine’s flavors 
persist across the whole length of your mouth or whether they stop short about 
halfway back. Stopping short is not considered a flaw in inexpensive wines, but 
fine wines should carry their flavor farther across your mouth.

Part IV: Enjoying California Wines  
238
 
Drink water at the beginning and end of your tasting, if not even 
more frequently. Wine tasters know how important water is in 
helping to mitigate the effects of alcohol. Nibbling on crackers can 
also help you handle the alcohol better. Even when you spit the 
wine, you still absorb some alcohol into your system.
Beware the designated driver trap
No, we are not suggesting that having a designated driver is a bad 
idea. In fact, it’s a great idea. But knowing that someone else is 
driving can have one downside: When you hire a car and driver (or 
a small bus) to take you and your friends around from winery to 
winery, or when you and your friends take turns being the desig-
nated driver over the course of several days, the risk is that you’ll 
relax so much that the alcohol goes to your head even more easily 
than it would otherwise.
 
Staying sober and sensible when you’re tasting wine requires con-
stant vigilance. If you let your guard down because you know that 
you don’t have to drive, you could dampen your whole experience 
and end up regretting your behavior. To stay vigilant, remind your-
self that you’re there to discover and learn, not solely to have fun. 
Don’t worry; you’ll still have plenty of fun in the process!
Preparing for Your Visit
We think that planning a vacation is almost the best part. That’s 
when we get to fantasize about what we’d like to do when we get to 
our destination and figure out, in time to make a reservation, the 
very best restaurants for lunch and dinner. In these days of airline 
security restrictions, we also plan for what we’ll do after we visit 
wineries — specifically, how we’ll transport our bottles home.
This section provides hands-on info on planning your wine tour. 
See Chapter 4 for info on California wine regions and Chapter 15 
for some of our favorite California wine destinations. And for the 
names of wineries that produce wines we recommend, check out 
Parts II and III of this book.
Gather specific info on winery visits
 
The more you know before you go, the more relaxed and efficient 
(and surprise-free) your winery visits will be. Make sure you gather 
visitor info, including addresses, hours, possible charges, and 
whether you need an appointment.

 Chapter 13: Making a Winery Pilgrimage 239
When we first wrote Wine For Dummies back in 1995, we advised read-
ers who wanted to visit California wine country to get their hands on 
a magazine published by Wine Spectator that listed names, addresses, 
telephone numbers, and visiting hours of practically all the wineries 
in California. Since then, two things have changed: The number of 
wineries in California has continued to climb beyond a number that’s 
feasible to include in one publication, and the Internet now exists.
Here are places where you might want to begin your search for 
specific info today:
 
✓ Wine Spectator (www.winespectator.com) is still a valuable 
source of information on California’s wine regions, the wines 
they make, the top local restaurants, and so forth.
 
✓ Wine Enthusiast magazine (www.winemag.com) publishes regu-
lar wine travel features.
 
✓ The Appellation America site (www.appellationamerica.
com) is an extremely valuable source of information on wine 
regions not only in California but also elsewhere in North 
America, including Canada. You find listings of wineries in 
specific regions, descriptions of the regions and the types of 
wines made there, and useful tourist information.
 
✓ Wine travel Web sites such as www.winecountry.com can 
not only spark your enthusiasm for your trip but also provide 
useful contact information for visits to specific wineries.
 
✓ A new Web site, www.landofwineandfood.com, has the spe-
cific purpose of aiding visitors in their travel to wine and culi-
nary destinations in California. The site is sponsored jointly 
by the California Travel and Tourism Commission and Wine 
Institute, California’s wine trade association.
 
✓ Wine or travel Web sites that have forums or message 
boards are also good places for your planning; for example, 
Frommer’s (www.frommers.com) has viewer-initiated discus-
sion threads about wineries in Santa Ynez Valley, Temecula, 
and other California wine regions.
 
✓ Your favorite wine blog could also be a good place to ask 
questions and get opinions from fellow wine lovers.
 
While you’re researching which wineries to visit in a specific area, 
be sure to check out the Web site of the local winery association. 
All but the smallest wine regions have associations whose man-
date is to promote the wines of their area. (You can find links to all 
these organizations on the Web site of Wine Institute, www.wine
institute.org.) These promotional sites can give you useful 
information on the types of wines made in the area and on the win-
eries themselves. And sometimes you discover that the associations 
have tasting rooms where you can sample wines from multiple 

Part IV: Enjoying California Wines  
240
wineries. A key example of this is the Monterey County Vintners 
and Growers Association (www.montereywines.org), which oper-
ates two wine-tasting visitor centers, in Monterey and in Soledad.
Know the restrictions on transporting 
your purchases
You probably know that you can’t carry bottles of wine with you 
onto an airplane. But the black-and-white of transporting wine 
home or having it shipped by the winery ends there. The regula-
tions governing delivery of wine to consumers vary from state to 
state. And what’s more, they’re constantly changing.
A landmark case before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005 at first 
seemed to simplify the whole picture of wine shipping: The Court 
ruled that no state can deny an out-of-state winery the right to 
ship to consumers in that state if it grants local wineries that right 
(which many states did and still do). Wine lovers envisioned a new 
land of free commerce in wine, but their (our!) hopes were naïve.
Although Internet commerce in wine seems easier than it once did, 
individual states are still refining their regulations, often with the 
apparent goal of restricting consumers from buying any wine that 
isn’t already available locally through state-registered wine shops 
and distributors.
In some cases, wines that you purchase personally as a tourist enjoy 
a different status from wines that you order from a California winery 
over the telephone or Internet, and they can be shipped home.
 
If you’re thinking of purchasing wine during your trip to California 
and asking the winery to ship it back home for you — or taking 
your purchases to a local UPS or FedEx store in California and 
sending it back to yourself — look into your state regulations first. 
Winery staff and shipping companies in California can tell you 
whether they’ll ship wine to your state, but by the time you get to 
California and ask, you might not be able to come up with a Plan B.
 
If you discover that you can’t ship your purchases, you might 
want to do what we do when we travel abroad: We take with us an 
empty cardboard wine shipping case with Styrofoam inserts (your 
local wine shop might be able to save one of these for you) and 
bring it back, filled with wine bottles, as checked luggage. We have 
never lost a bottle to breakage this way. But even if a bottle were 
to break, that would be a lot less distressing than if it had broken 
in our suitcase.

your question is an FAQ, such as whether those expen-

Chapter 14
Answers to Ten 
Common Questions about 
California Wine
In This Chapter
▶ The “best” California wine
▶ Aging and vintages
▶ The deal with California Merlots
I
n our years of teaching about wine and helping customers in 
wine shops, we’ve noticed that the same questions about 
California wines arise frequently. Here are the questions and our 
answers.
What’s the Best California Wine?
In our experience, this is undoubtedly the most common question 
about California wines. We usually respond with a few questions of 
our own before we answer, such as the following:
 
✓ Is price a consideration? In other words, do you want to 
know the “best wine under $50” or the best wine regardless 
of cost?
 
✓ The best red wine, white wine, or sparkling wine?
 
✓ If it’s red wine, do you generally prefer Cabernet Sauvignon, 
Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel, or something else?
As you can conclude, no one “best wine for everyone” exists. Your 
best wine depends on your own very personal taste, with the price 
of the wine often another important consideration. Any wines that 
we nominate as our favorite California wines might be wines that 
you don’t like one bit!

Part V: The Part of Tens 
244
The best direct answer that we can give to this question is that we 
believe California’s best wines generally are Cabernet Sauvignons 
and Cabernet blends, with most of the best coming from Napa 
Valley, although a few great ones also come from Sonoma (such as 
Laurel Glen “Estate”) and the Santa Cruz Mountains (such as Ridge 
“Monte Bello”).
Do Vintages Matter for 
California Wine?
Yes, vintages do matter, although California generally doesn’t 
experience the wide variability from year to year that you 
find in Europe. In plain English, California seldom has really poor 
vintages in which no decent wines are produced. The weather 
just doesn’t get that bad during the growing season in California. 
The curve runs mainly from “average vintage” to “excellent 
vintage.”
The cooler vintages seem to work best for almost all California 
wines (except Zinfandel, which does well in warm weather). 
The 2005 vintage, generally quite cool for California, seems to be a 
generally excellent vintage for most California wines. (See Chapter 
12 for some of our other favorite vintages.)
Are Ratings Important in 
Buying California Wine?
Ratings — the scores that critics give to wines to indicate their 
assessment of the wines’ quality — matter only if you know that 
your tastes in California wine are exactly the same as those of the 
critic who is doing the rating. Tasting and judging wine is such a 
subjective experience that it’s quite a stretch to think that you’ll 
like all the highly rated wines of all critics. For example, we often 
don’t enjoy wines rated in the high-90s of some critics because our 
tastes are so different from theirs.
 
We strongly recommend that you buy just one bottle of a wine you 
haven’t tasted, regardless of critics’ ratings, and try it yourself 
before investing in multiple bottles. Otherwise, you might be stuck 
with wines that you don’t enjoy!

 Chapter 14: Answers to Ten Common Questions 245
How Long Should California Wines 
Age before I Drink Them?
Today, the goal of most winemakers in California and elsewhere 
is to produce wines that are enjoyable when you buy them. 
You don’t find the harsh tannins that used to be present in many 
young red wines; tannins are softer and are well-balanced by ripe 
fruitiness. Therefore, most California wines are quite drinkable 
when young.
But the finer California red wines — especially Cabernet 
Sauvignons and Cabernet blends but even Pinot Noirs — often 
improve with a few years of aging. For example, most 2001 and 
1999 California Cabernets are perfect for drinking right now. 
Chapter 12 can tell you more about how well wines age.
Are the $100+ California 
Wines Worth the Price?
We actually believe that many California wines, especially 
Cabernet Sauvignons and Cabernet blends, are overpriced. To be 
fair, expenses are extremely high in California: The cost of the 
vineyard and winery in prime regions, operating costs, labor, and 
so forth are among the highest in the world. But often, the high 
price of a wine is a question of status or peer pressure; some 
California producers have said to us, “If I don’t charge this (high) 
price, consumers won’t respect my wine” or “The quality of my 
wine is commensurate with wines in that (high) price tier.”
Yes, we have tasted some wonderful California Cabernets priced 
over $100 that we believe warrant the price. You can find some of 
them in our wine recommendations in Chapter 6. But we’ve also 
tasted some excellent California wines in the $20 to $50 range. You 
don’t have to pay over $100 to find top California wines.
Do California Wines Age Well?
Some California wines do age well; others don’t. In general, 
California’s dry red wines age much better than dry whites:

Part V: The Part of Tens 
246
 
✓ Cabernet Sauvignon: These California wines have the 
best track record for aging. We don’t know whether they’ll 
age as long as red Bordeaux wines (whose record for 
longevity extends over 100 years for the best wines), but 
some California Cabs, among the few that were around in 
the first half of the last century, have aged well for 60 to 
70 years.
 
✓ Zinfandel: Red Zinfandel has aged well, but old Zinfandels do 
lose their unique berry-like character that you find in young 
Zinfandels.
 
✓ Chardonnay: Most older California Chardonnays haven’t 
aged well. However, now that California wine producers are 
planting Chardonnay in more suitable, cooler areas, we 
believe that current Chardonnays will be aging longer than 
earlier Chardonnays.
Other major California red wines — Syrah, Merlot, and Pinot 
Noir — haven’t existed in quantity for more than 20 years, so it’s 
impossible to say at this point how well they’ll age.
Are California Pinot Noirs as 
Good as Red Burgundy?
Because of differences in terroir (primarily climate and soil), 
California Pinot Noirs are very different from red Burgundies, 
which are made entirely from the Pinot Noir grape. Generally, 
most California wine regions are somewhat warmer than 
Burgundy, which makes California Pinot Noirs taste more overtly 
fruity and feel more opulent on the palate. Burgundies tend to 
be leaner, dryer, and somewhat lighter-bodied, and they tend to 
taste earthier and more suggestive of the forest.
California Pinot Noirs vary widely, depending on the region; 
cooler regions such as the Sonoma Coast, the Carneros, parts 
of the Russian River Valley, Anderson Valley in Mendocino 
County, and Santa Maria Valley in Santa Barbara County tend 
to produce lighter-bodied, more delicately flavored wines 
than the heftier Pinot Noirs from the Santa Lucia Highlands in 
Monterey County.
The bottom line is that excellent Pinot Noirs are coming from 
California and from Burgundy; they’re just different. (For more 
information on California Pinot Noirs, flip to Chapter 7.)

 Chapter 14: Answers to Ten Common Questions 247
Are California Chardonnays 
Too Oaky?
Ten years ago, we would have answered that most California 
Chardonnays have too much of the smoky/toasty aroma and flavor 
of oak as well as too much oak tannin. But we’re happy to say that 
California’s winemakers seem to have listened to the complaints of 
consumers and wine writers and have gotten the message.
Today, there’s a healthy trend away from the heavy-handed use of 
oak in Chardonnay. More and more California Chardonnays are 
being produced with a minimum of oak aging and less new oak (the 
oakiest oak) than before. And California Chardonnays are better 
than ever.
Of course, you’ll still find some California Chardonnays made with 
lots of oaky flavor, and that’s a good thing for those wine drinkers 
who favor that flavorful, powerful style of wine. But many of the 
better California Chardonnays, the ones we recommend in this 
book (see Chapter 5), now carry a much subtler stamp of oak in 
their taste.
Are California Rosés Sweet?
California has definitely made progress with its pink, or rosé, 
wines. At one time, just about every California rosé, whether it 
was White Zinfandel, another blush wine, or a plain old rosé, was 
overtly sweet — too sweet for many wine drinkers accustomed 
to the taste of dry European rosé wines. But we’re now seeing 
a definite trend toward dryer California rosés, many of which we 
recommend in Chapter 11.
In truth, we’d like to see California producers make rosés as dry 
as most of the rosés from France, Italy, and Spain, and they’re not 
there yet. But they are heading in the right direction. Certainly, 
almost all of California’s rosé sparkling wines are dry enough 
for us.
What’s the Story with 
California Merlots?
The implication behind this question is “Are Merlots as poor as 
their recent reputation suggests they are, and will I look foolish if I 
order a glass of Merlot?”

Part V: The Part of Tens 
248
Merlot has had an interesting history in California. It went from a 
mere blending wine (strictly a supporting-cast player) to a varietal 
wine in its own right to the hot red wine in California. It seemed 
for a certain period of time that everyone was ordering either 
Chardonnay or Merlot, nothing else. Unfortunately, Merlot couldn’t 
handle its sudden fame, and lots of inferior Merlot flooded the 
market, giving the once-hot variety a bad reputation. (Witness 
Miles, the main character in the film Sideways, spewing venom 
about Merlot.)
We are happy to report that Merlot is making a comeback. 
Producers who never lost faith in Merlot — such as Clos du Val, 
Duckhorn, Matanzas Creek, Newton Vineyards, Selene, Shafer 
Vineyards, Swanson Vineyards, and Trefethen — are making 
superb Merlots today. You can check out some of our picks for 
Merlots in Chapter 6.

alifornia is so rich in wine-related travel destinations that 
it’s challenging to limit our list to just ten. Napa Valley alone 
provides dozens of wonderful opportunities to enhance your 
stay in this beautiful state. But California wine country is more 
than Napa Valley.
For a complete change of pace, we suggest that you visit the Sierra 
Foothills in Gold Rush Country. Or go off the beaten path, to 
San Luis Obispo and Paso Robles. We also recommend visiting 
beautiful Santa Barbara if you’re heading south to the Central 
Coast wine regions. And no visit to Sonoma County would be 
complete without stopping in Healdsburg, located in the heart of 
one of Sonoma’s best wine regions (Russian River Valley). We 
end our list of top ten destinations with a personal favorite: the 
quirky town of Mendocino and its offbeat wine region, Anderson 
Valley. Enjoy!

In addition to the city of Napa, Napa Valley has five main wine 
towns, all located off Route 29, which runs south to north through 
the heart of the Valley. Starting north of Napa, the towns are 
Yountville, Oakville, Rutherford, St. Helena, and the northernmost, 
Calistoga. Each town has its charms. St. Helena is the largest town, 
and it’s the one that has the most real-life (as opposed to wine 

Part V: The Part of Tens

country idyllic) feel to it. But Yountville offers probably the widest 
range of places to stay and excellent restaurants, and it’s close to 
many wineries.
One of the places we like to stay when we visit Napa Valley is the 
Villagio Inn & Spa (www.villagio.com), located on Washington 
Street, Yountville’s main street. It’s a sprawling country inn with 
cabins, gardens, a spa, and a swimming pool, plus an excellent 
breakfast. The nearby Vintage Inn (www.vintageinn.com), some-
what similar and affiliated, is also a wonderful place to stay. 
Yountville also has lots of smaller bed & breakfast places available.
Yountville is home to one of the finest restaurants in the U.S., 
The French Laundry (tables fill fast, so make reservations several 
months ahead). If you can’t get into The French Laundry or 
prefer to dine a bit more simply, we suggest two wonderful French 
bistros — Bouchon and Bistro Jeanty — both on Washington 
Street. Other top Yountville restaurants include Mustards, Redd, 
Brix, and Bistro Don Giovanni.
One special winery to visit in Yountville is Domaine Chandon. 
You can arrange for a tour and tasting at what is the one of the 
oldest — and still one of the best — sparkling wine companies in 
California, plus enjoy an excellent lunch or dinner at étoile, the 
winery’s renowned French restaurant.
In addition to great dining and lots of shopping, you can opt for a 
hot air balloon ride over Napa Valley in Yountville (www.nvaloft.
com). Or to combine a round of golf with your winery visits, 
contact the Vintner’s Golf Club (www.vintnersgolfclub.com).
The Ferry Building, San Francisco
San Francisco is one of the greatest cities in the U.S., and it’s a 
must-stop for anyone heading to Napa Valley and/or Sonoma 
County. The Ferry Building Marketplace, located along the 
Embarcadero roadway on the San Francisco Bay, is one of the 
great culinary meccas in the country; you can buy wines, fruits, 
vegetables, meats, breads, cheeses, and other artisan foods 
and food-related merchandise. The marketplace also has several 
attractive cafés and bakeries.
 
The very best time to visit the Ferry Building is Saturday from 8 
a.m. to 2 p.m. or Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., when the crowded 
Ferry Plaza Farmers Market is open.

 Chapter 15: Ten Top Travel Destinations and Attractions 251
The Ferry Building is also the place to catch inexpensive ferries 
to places such as Alcatraz, Angel Island, the beautiful AT&T 
Park (home of Major League Baseball’s San Francisco Giants), the 
colorful town of Sausalito in Marin County, and Vallejo, the 
entry town to Napa Valley. You can catch a return ferry from 
Vallejo at sunset to view the glorious Golden Gate Bridge in 
San Francisco Bay.
Picnic Lunches in Wine Country
One of our personal treats in California wine country, especially in 
the summer, is to buy the makings of a picnic lunch and find a 
good location to relax and enjoy it. We often stop in the town of 
Sonoma and go to a good food shop, bakery, and cheese shop off 
the main square to load up on goodies.
For some fancier food and great wine, two fantastic food stores in 
Napa Valley, both on Route 29, are the renowned Oakville Grocery 
in Oakville (www.oakvillegrocery.com) and Dean & DeLuca in St. 
Helena (www.deandeluca.com).
Perhaps the most famous picnic stop in all of California is the V. 
Sattui Winery, a small, family-owned winery on Route 29, south 
of St. Helena. V. Sattui sells almost all its wine to the thousands of 
visitors who arrive there every year. When you visit, you can taste 
V. Sattui’s award-winning wines and buy a bottle or two, along with 
deli fare — such as salami, cheese, olives, and salads — and then 
sit down at a picnic table on the grounds surrounding the winery.
The Napa Valley Wine Train
One of the best and most luxurious ways to see Napa Valley is to 
head to the city of Napa and take the unique Napa Valley Wine 
Train tour (www.winetrain.com). It’s a leisurely three-hour 
journey through Napa Valley wine country in vintage railroad 
cars. This is a great way to see Napa Valley (if not actually visit 
wineries) without having to hassle with the traffic.
You can choose among several options on your tour, including a 
gourmet three- or four-course meal in a fine restaurant on the 
train, a wine tasting, and lunch with a local Napa vintner. You even 
have the option to tour several top Napa Valley wineries when 
your ride is over.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
252
Calistoga’s Hot Springs 
and Mud Baths
At the northern end of Napa Valley is the picturesque town of 
Calistoga, the least gentrified town in the Valley. This is the 
place where you can add a bit of personal pampering and perhaps 
recovery time to your extensive wine touring. Lots of spas 
featuring hot springs, mud baths, and massages are available here. 
One of the traditional places to stay is the Mt. View Hotel & Spa 
(www.mountviewhotel.com). Many bed and breakfast places, 
country inns, and good restaurants are located in Calistoga, and a 
dozen or so wineries are close by. The adventurous can schedule 
canoe and kayak trips during their stay.
The Sierra Foothills
Thinking of going to Yosemite National Park or Lake Tahoe? On 
the way, be sure to visit California’s most unique wine region, the 
Sierra Foothills. Located in central California, directly east of San 
Francisco, the huge Sierra Foothills American Viticultural Area 
(AVA) spreads out over eight counties, with Amador and El Dorado 
Counties in the center. The main entry to the Sierra Foothills is the 
city of Sacramento, situated just west of the wine area.
Visiting the Sierra Foothills is like taking a trip into the past, to old 
California. The Gold Rush towns are still here (gold was discovered 
at Sutter Creek in 1849), some of them no more than ghost towns 
now. The majestic Sierra Nevada Mountains to the east provide 
lots of outdoor activities, such as hiking, whitewater rafting, and so 
forth. Small wineries, located in colorful areas such as Fiddletown, 
Placerville, Fair Play, and the Shenandoah Valley, sell most of their 
wines to visiting tourists.
The Sierra Foothills (along with a few vineyards in Sonoma) are 
the main location of the very old-vine Zinfandels; you can buy 
intensely flavorful red Zinfandels made from 100-year old vines 
in this region (see Chapter 8 for more on Zins and why vine age 
matters). Mainly a red wine region, the Sierra Foothills also feature 
Cabernet Sauvignons, Rhône-style reds, and Italian varieties. This 
is a laid back, rustic area, directly in contrast to the gentrification 
of Napa Valley.

San Luis Obispo and Paso Robles
In the most central part of California’s Central Coast are the city of 
San Luis Obispo and the region’s main wine town, Paso Robles, 
which is located exactly halfway between San Francisco and Los 
Angeles. Although Paso Robles is just 25 miles north of San Luis 
Obispo on Highway 101, the cities are actually the focus of two 
different wine regions. Both regions are wonderful to visit, because 
you don’t have to compete with all the wine tourists that Napa 
Valley or Santa Barbara attracts.
San Luis Obispo, distinctly cooler, is close to the Arroyo Grande 
and Edna Valley AVA regions, which are important for Chardonnay 
and Pinot Noir production. Major nearby wineries include Edna 
Valley Vineyard, Alban Winery, Domaine Alfred, Talley Vineyards, 
and Laetitia Vineyard. The city is fairly small (population: 46,000), 
but it’s a quite sophisticated college town (California Polytechnic 
State University is there) with lots of good restaurants, interesting 
shopping, hotels, and bed and breakfast places.
Nearby, on the coast, is beautiful Pismo Beach, with a good wine 
restaurant, Giuseppe’s Cucina Italiana. A top hotel in Pismo 
Beach, The Cliffs Resort (www.cliffsresort.com), hosts a Pinot 
Noir Festival every March. To the north of Pismo Beach is the 
more tranquil Morro Bay, with its fine hotel, The Inn at Morro Bay 
(www.innatmorrobay.com), and an excellent wine restaurant with 
a breathtaking view, Windows on the Water.
The rapidly growing town of Paso Robles (population: 32,000) 
also offers excellent hospitality in terms of hotels — including the 
five-star inn Villa Toscana (www.myvillatoscana.com) — bed and 
breakfasts, and restaurants. The main difference from San Luis 
Obispo is that the Paso Robles region is a much larger AVA (over 
170 wineries), and the emphasis is definitely on red wines: Rhône 
varieties, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Italian varieties. The 
York Mountain AVA, a cooler area to the west of the city of Paso 
Robles, is also part of the Paso Robles AVA.
Near both Paso Robles and San Luis Obispo is one of California’s 
top tourist attractions, the magnificent Hearst Castle. The castle 
is the historic house of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper 
magnate who largely inspired the film Citizen Kane (www.hearst
castle.org).

Santa Barbara
A visit to the Santa Barbara wine region should begin with a stop in 
the city of Santa Barbara, one of the most beautiful cities in the 
world. It offers its fortunate residents an outstanding lifestyle. The 
city has several colleges and universities, excellent restaurants, 
and stunning vistas at every turn.
If you want to be closer to Santa Barbara’s wine regions, consider 
staying farther north, either in the city of Lompoc or in Santa 
Maria. Lompoc is at the western edge of the Sta. Rita Hills AVA, 
and to its east is Santa Ynez Valley AVA; both regions have lots of 
outstanding wineries. The city of Santa Maria, in the northwestern 
part of Santa Barbara County, faces Santa Maria Valley, which is 
home of some of the best Pinot Noir wineries in the state; it was 
featured in the film Sideways.
A must-stop while in Santa Barbara is a visit to one or both of the 
Hitching Post restaurants. The original Hitching Post Restaurant, 
famous for its barbecue as well as its wines, is in the village of 
Casmalia, south of Santa Maria. Hitching Post II, owned by the 
same (Ostini) family, is in Buellton, in the Santa Ynez Valley.
Healdsburg, Sonoma County
Sonoma County offers many attractions, and one key place to 
visit has to be the booming wine town of Healdsburg, in Northern 
Sonoma. Healdsburg, in the heart of the Russian River Valley 
and right next to Dry Creek Valley, is an ideal place to stay while 
touring some of the best wineries in the state, such as Jordan, J, 
Williams Selyem, Rochioli, Ferrari-Carano, Hartford Family, Simi, 
Gallo Family, Iron Horse, Ridge Lytton Springs, Seghesio, Martinelli, 
and A. Rafanelli.
Healdsburg is the home of some of California’s best restaurants, 
including the top-rated Cyrus. It has lots of fine hotels and inns, 
great food shops, and some of the best shopping in wine country.
Mendocino, Anderson Valley
We love the town of Mendocino, on the North Coast, where all 
(well, many) of the old hippies of the late ’60s settled, or so it 
seems. Mendocino is a quaint town whose Victorian houses give 
the feeling that you’re in New England. We enjoyed staying in the 
MacCallum House Inn (www.maccallumhouse.com), which dates 
back to the 1880s and which also has an excellent restaurant. 
Another top place to dine in Mendocino is Café Beaujolais.

 Chapter 15: Ten Top Travel Destinations and Attractions 255
South of Mendocino, along the Pacific Coast and closer to the 
Anderson Valley wine country, is the Albion River Inn, in Albion 
(www.albionriverinn.com). It offers private cabins with decks 
overlooking the water and a dining room with a great view.
Just south of Albion is Route 128, which takes you through the 
magnificent California redwood trees into Anderson Valley. 
Among our favorite wineries to visit there are Roederer Estate 
(California bubbly at its best), Handley Cellars, Greenwood Ridge, 
Lazy Creek Vineyards, Navarro, and some promising newcomers 
that emphasize Pinot Noir, such as Londer Vineyards and Phillips 
Hill Estates. The place to stay and dine in the Anderson Valley is 
the Boonville Hotel (www.boonvillehotel.com) in the town of 
Boonville. It’s another place that dates back to the 19th century, 
and it offers a lot of charm along with good food.
Healdsburg’s best annual wine events
In March, right before heavy tourist season kicks off, Healdsburg tempts the wine-
lover’s taste buds with a barrel-tasting weekend at nearly 100 wineries along the 
Russian River Wine Road. And if you happen to fall in love with a wine you taste, 
you can secure your share of bottles — at discounted prices — long before they 
even exist, never mind sell out. (It’s called buying futures.) Tickets are $20 online or 
$30 at the door. For information, visit www.wineroad.com or call 800-723-6336 or 
707-433-4335.
A big June attraction is the ten-day Healdsburg Jazz Festival. Venues range from 
vineyards to restaurants to intimate theaters, and headliners sell out quickly. 
Admission prices vary. Tickets can be purchased via Web sites, mail, fax, or at the 
venue. For more information, please go to www.healdsburgjazzfestival.
com or call 707-433-4644.
