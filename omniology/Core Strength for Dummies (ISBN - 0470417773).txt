Dedication
This book is dedicated with lots of love to my daughters, Bella and Sofi a, who 
compete for my attention every time I sit down at my desk to write! I do love 
you both so much . . . and of course to the readers who make it all worth it 
and buy my books. I thank you all!
Author’s Acknowledgments
Writing a book requires a lot of teamwork and, again, I have to thank Rob 
Dyer at Wiley for encouraging me to write my fi rst book. Who would ever 
guess that this would be my fourth? Thanks, Rob!
I’d also like to thank the entire staff at Wiley, including Jennifer Connolly, my 
project editor, who was just great to work with and a busy mom like myself (I 
could tell by the noise in the background, she started working from home!). 
Lindsay Lefevere, acquisitions editor, really is good at what she does and was 
always there for me when I needed her. Krista Hansing, my copy editor, who 
made everything look nice and consistent and encouraged me to use spell 
check! My agent at ICM, Andrea Barvzi, to be able to convince me to write a 
book in a few months! And photographer Nick Horne sat on an exercise ball 
as he shot the photos and still managed to make me look good. Make-up artist 
Mina Kang made me look really tan, which is always nice. And last, but cer-
tainly not least, Linda Shelton was on my fi rst cover shoot for Shape magazine 
and served as director for this shoot — thanks, Linda, you really are the best!! 
Special thanks to all the models who look so hot! Robert Check is shirtless in 
all the pictures in this book, and when you see him, you’ll know why (thanks 
to his agent, David Levine, for bringing him to my attention:). Chris Gann took 
time off from shooting a fi lm to do the shots in Chapters 8 and 10 and fi lled 
in as my senior model. And, of course, my beautiful daughter, Bella, and her 
friend Elizabeth Bartle-Steere did the kids’ exercises for me. Last but certainly 
not least, baby Sofi a Gallachi was the best baby I’ve ever worked with — and 
never made a peep!

Introduction
C
ore training is a hot topic these days, isn’t it? Just take a look at any 
magazine or DVD — they all seem to be targeting your core. Yes, having 
a strong core not only prevents injuries, but it also makes the movements 
you make on a daily basis easier to manage. So what is core strength and 
how do you get it? Well, I think it is best described as having fat-free abs and 
a strong back. I describe the core itself as the “bridge” that connects your 
upper and lower body. So if you have a weak bridge, all your movements will 
suffer because nothing will make it across that bridge.
Some people call it core training because you’re doing just that — increasing 
the strength in your midsection as you’re whittling your waist and developing 
strong back muscles. Just think of how often you call upon your core to per-
form movements throughout the day: getting up from your couch or a chair, 
picking up your children or grandchildren, and sitting at your desk while 
you’re working. All these activities require great core strength — otherwise, 
you’d walk around hunched over with weak back muscles all day long. Sound 
familiar? I hope not! I want to show you how to obtain a stronger core with 
this book and help you gain a better understanding of why it’s so important 
to have a strong core in the first place!
About This Book
This book introduces you to various core exercises that everybody can do — 
no matter what your age or lifestyle. In fact, there’s a chapter for everybody 
in this book — from kids to seniors — that can help you develop a regular 
core-training routine to do every day or just learn a few new moves to keep 
you feeling great! I’ve included Pilates and yoga workouts, children’s exer-
cises, senior exercises, workouts for new moms and babies, weight training 
for your core, and more. You’ll also discover how to stave off workout bore-
dom by adding a few new props, such as the exercise ball and dumbbells. 
In addition, I cover simple core strengtheners you can do using household 
objects or the resistance of your own body weight.
This book contains comprehensive sections on special circumstances, 
like exercising during pregnancy and relieving back pain by targeting your 
abdominals. I even include a total core workout you can do when you have 
enough time and aren’t rushed to work out. Whatever your interest or age, 
you’re sure to get a good core workout and have some fun doing it!

2
Core Strength For Dummies 
In this book, I tell you everything you need to know about core training, such 
as answers to the following questions:
 
✓ What muscles am I targeting when I’m strengthening my core?
 
✓ What kind of changes can I expect to see in my body from core training?
 
✓ How many days a week should I do these core workouts?
 
✓ Is it safe to exercise during pregnancy?
 
✓ What are the best core strengtheners I can do for back pain?
 
✓ Can kids strengthen their core, too?
 
✓ Can I stretch out my core?
 
✓ Is it safe for senior citizens to exercise?
 
✓ Are there core exercises I can do on the exercise ball?
 
✓ Will the core workouts be a challenging enough for me if I’m already in 
shape?
In addition, this book, like all For Dummies books, has a friendly and 
approachable tone that assumes you don’t know a whole lot about the sub-
ject you’re reading — not that you’re an actual dummy! It’s also important 
to tell you that like all For Dummies books, you don’t have to read it cover 
to cover . . . instead just flip to the section that best describes you or read 
a little intro first before moving onto whatever interests you. This book is 
also useful for learning new core-training techniques for those who already 
know what they’re doing. You can always pick up new techniques from a For 
Dummies book! 
Conventions Used in This Book
The focus of this book is on core strengthening in many different situations, 
while emphasizing safety and proper body alignment. Reading the step-by-
step instructions that accompany the photos before you start any of the 
exercises makes trying these core moves a lot easier and helps to keep your 
workouts safe and effective.
Check out these conventions I used to make navigating the information in 
this book a lot easier:
 
✓ Most of the core exercise photos show two stages — labeled A and B — 
demonstrating the beginning and end for each pose.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ I use italics to point out any new terms or bits of jargon you should know.
 
✓ Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont to help them 
stand out.
 
✓ The numbered sets of instructions for the core exercises and the key-
words in lists appear in boldface.
What You’re Not to Read
Although I feel that all the information in this book is important, the sidebars 
that appear in the gray boxes don’t contain information that you absolutely 
need to know to get a good core workout. However, these sidebars do con-
tain great tips and information about your health, so I encourage you to read 
them at some point.
Foolish Assumptions
As I mentioned earlier in the introduction, this book is for people who don’t 
have a lot of prior knowledge about the subject at hand (in this case, core 
training and your current level of fitness). Keeping this goal in mind, I made a 
few assumptions about you, the reader:
 
✓ You’re interested in core strengthening and want to make it part of 
your life.
 
✓ You don’t have much experience with core exercises and want to know 
more.
 
✓ You’re ready, willing, and able to find out more about core training and 
how to do the exercises in this book.
If this sounds like you, then you’ve come to the right place!
How This Book Is Organized
Core Strength For Dummies is divided into six different parts, each one with 
a unique focus. You can go directly to whichever part interests you the 
most or start at the beginning to gather some information and a checklist of 
what you’ll need to know before you begin each core-strengthening chapter. 
Following are the parts and what you can find in them.

Core Strength For Dummies 
Part I: Core Basics
If you’re new to core training, reading Part I is the way to go. Part I covers all 
the important issues you want to know before you begin your core program.
Part I covers these topics:
 
✓ Who should exercise their core
 
✓ How often you should be working your core
 
✓ How you can reshape your core
 
✓ Props you can use to enhance core exercises
 
✓ The benefits of a strong core
Part II: Core Workouts to Help 
You Sculpt Your Trouble Areas
Part II is organized in a very logical manner — Chapter 5 starts off with a 
series of beginning exercises, and then the chapters progress with core exer-
cises that are illustrated for various individual body parts. Finally, Chapter 8 
finishes with a total body workout to strengthen your entire body.
Because I believe you should work out in a progressive manner (starting with 
the simplest exercises first), I strongly encourage starting with the begin-
ner exercises in Chapter 5 and then progressing through the chapters until 
you reach Chapter 8. These chapters concentrate first on the abdominals 
and then on the butt; finally, you put it all together for a total body workout 
focusing on your core.
Part III: Developing Core Strength 
Using Accessories
Part III shows you a variety of core exercises you can do while using acces-
sories. This section may be the most useful part of the book for you if you 
already have knowledge of core training and want to beat boredom by adding 
a few new techniques or a few new moves.
In Chapter 9, I show you core exercises using an exercise ball and offer you a 
ball chart so you know how to pick the right size of ball. Chapter 10 contains 
core exercises using dumbbells that you can add to any workout you already 
have or just use alone for core strengthening.

5
 Introduction
This part ends with nice primer on ab machines that you can use at your gym 
to get a nice six-pack!
Part IV: Adding Variety 
to Your Core Routine
Part IV is a fantastic section on recruiting different training techniques to help 
with core strengthening. If you’ve ever wanted to try Pilates, Chapter 11 is the 
one for you. This chapter contains photo illustrations of Pilates strengthening 
exercises that help you get a killer core.
Chapter 12 is a chapter for anyone interested in yoga — and you’ll love doing 
the poses! Whether you’re a beginner or you know all about the sun saluta-
tion, you’ll like trying these poses that place a special emphasis on your core.
Part IV also contains Chapter 14, for stretching your core. It shows some 
fun and practical stretches for the abs, hips, and back that’ll help keep you 
strong and flexible for years to come.
Part V: Special Situations
No matter what stage of life you’re in, core exercises can improve your daily 
life. Check out Chapter 15 for pregnancy and postnatal core exercises that 
help you to relax and strenghten your body before and after you have your 
baby. Get the kids together to perform a series of fun exercises that Chapter 
16 provides, which help your kids build basic core strength and learn the 
skills needed to stay fit for a lifetime. And finally, Chapter 18 contains core 
exercises that address the needs of anyone over the age of 60. If you’re in one 
of these demographics, this part has something for you!
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In every For Dummies book, you find The Part of Tens. The last three chapters 
in this book contain top-ten lists of fun facts about the different things you’ll 
get from core training and what you can use to enhance your workout at home.
Chapter 19 lists ten best ways to train your core, while in Chapter 20, I offer 
ten dietary changes you can make to whittle your core and get fat free abs. 
Finally, Chapter 21 offers ten different items you can use in your house to 
make core strengthening fast and fun!

Core Strength For Dummies 
Icons Used in This Book
In this book, you’ll find different pictures in the margins, or icons, that give 
you useful information along the way. Reading these icons before you try the 
actual exercises is helpful because many of them suggest easier or better 
ways of performing each one.
Here’s a list of icons used in this book:
 
The Tip icon gives you useful information that’ll make your life easier as it 
relates to core training. I may point you to a specific chapter or resource, or 
provide hints to modify an exercise or to make it easier. For instance, a Tip 
icon may tell you how to breathe during an exercise to keep you from holding 
your breath, or it may tell you to maintain a neutral spine.
 
As you may have guessed, this icon points out really important information 
that you need to keep in mind. Very valuable information comes with these 
icons, so don’t skip ’em!
 
The Warning icon highlights information that keeps you from hurting yourself. 
Read the information listed under this icon before you attempt each exercise. 
You’ll be glad you did!
Where to Go from Here
Core Strength For Dummies is a reference guide for beginners and an introduc-
tion to performing core-strengthening exercises. You can start reading at the 
very beginning of this book to gather a little information first, or you can dive 
right in and tear out the yellow Cheat Sheet in the front of this book to take 
with you as you’re running out the door to a core class.
If you’re not sure where you want to start, I suggest browsing the table of con-
tents to get a sense of exactly what this book covers and what topics interest 
you. You may find that you already know the basics but have always wanted to 
know how to use an exercise ball, so you can immediately flip to that chapter.
If you fall into one of the special circumstances groups, you may want to go 
directly to that section to find which chapter covers your special needs. If 
you’re like me, you may just want to go directly to the workout chapters that 
pertain to you and learn some new moves.
And if you know all about core training already and just want to brush up on 
your exercises a bit, you can turn to the index to find out which information 
pertains to you.
Wherever you choose to start, it’s great that you’re here. Enjoy!

Part I
Core Basics

In this part . . .
I 
know that you know a strong core is good for you, but 
in Chapter 1, I cover why having a strong core is actu-
ally good for you. I also answer all the questions you may 
have about your core — like where it is located, why you 
need to strengthen it, and how to acquire core strength 
through specific exercises.
In Chapter 2, I get into the anatomy of your core a little 
bit, which will give you a better understanding of what 
muscles you’re working and which one’s you aren’t. I 
show you how to evaluate your core stability and test 
your present level of fitness so you’ll have a starting point 
for your new core-training program. I even help you 
understand what you can do to reshape your core to the 
best of your ability — with a little help from me.
Chapter 3 includes everything you need to know to get 
started, including what props you might want to use and 
how much space you’ll need. I also give you the basics of 
a safe core-training program, including guidelines for 
beginners and advanced exercisers.
I wrap it all up in Chapter 4, where I show you a few warm-
ups to increase your core temperature and prepare your 
body for core training.

Chapter 1
Finding Your Core Strength
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering the benefits of core training
▶ Getting answers to all your questions about core strength
▶ Exploring different techniques used for core training
▶ Discovering new sports that need core strengthening
▶ Developing core strength for relaxation
▶ Finding fun ways to incorporate core training
▶ Adding accessories to your core workout
W
hether you’re looking to nix your muffin top (the fat that hangs over the 
top of your belt!) or get washboard abs (better known as a six-pack), 
core training is a powerful tool that requires great strength in your abdominal 
muscles and back. The results can certainly be just like magic — killer abs and 
a long, straight spine; new ease of everyday movements; increased ability for all 
your muscles to work together; and a sense of really being fit to the core.
Of course, I’m aware that many of you may want to just tone up your tummy 
and think it takes only a few days of eating less (and you know who you are); 
others of you may be wrought with fear and dread that you’ll be forced to do 
a hundred sit-ups! Well, just as in everyday life, the truth lies somewhere in 
the middle.
Believe it or not, the ideas and techniques I use in this book were never part 
of a Marines-style workout and were never used in a torture chamber, but 
you may see some of my moves in a real gym where boxers train or many ath-
letes go to work out. I like to get a little old school because I know that many 
of you (me included) have become soft around the middle from watching way 
too many reality shows and eating a little too much pizza. So read on to get 
a tighter, toner tummy and stronger back, which will help you zip up those 
pants or wear that bikini you’ve been stashing in the back of your drawer. 
Isn’t it time?

Part I: Core Basics 
First Things First: Locating Your Core
This is it, the phenomenon on which this entire book is based: the miracu-
lous capability of our bodies to grow in strength and tap into the amazing 
power located in the abs and back, or core. Before we can use this amazing 
power, we need to understand how it works, how to strengthen it, and how to 
maintain it. 
When you hear people talking about “the core,” they’re actually referring to 
the muscles that lie deep within the abs and back. Some of these muscles 
include the transversus abdominal, the muscles of the pelvic floor, and the 
waist muscles or obliques. These muscles are where all your core move-
ments originate and are the main source of stability in your body to maintain 
an upright standing position. Whether picking up your baby or toddler, car-
rying groceries or boxes, or walking, these core muscles help keep your body 
stable and balanced.
With this new focus on the importance of core strength, the entire fitness 
industry has moved toward training the body as a whole instead of focus-
ing on separate muscle groups (see Chapter 14). Incorporating core training 
into every workout you do has been proven to provide exceptional benefits 
to your entire body that you need to stay injury free for life (see the section 
“Benefits to Core Training” for more on the benefits core training produces 
for your body). You can enhance this type of functional training for your 
core with anything that challenges your balance, like the exercise ball (see 
Chapter 9) and wobble boards. 
The Five W’s of Core Training
Using a “just the facts” approach, I’ve gathered the following information to 
make up the five W’s — the who, what, where, when and why’s of core train-
ing. Read on to find out the answers to your burning questions before you 
embark on your core training.
Who needs core training?
Everyone needs core training! As I mention throughout this book, core 
strengthening is vital to your health — not just for physical appearances — 
because the core serves as the “bridge” that connects your upper body with 
your lower body. All of your movements suffer if you don’t have a strong 
connection between your upper and lower body. And all internal organs 

11
 Chapter 1: Finding Your Core Strength
cannot be supported without having the strength of your internal and exter-
nal girdle, known as the core. Training only your upper body and leaving 
your core susceptible to weakness creates a muscle imbalance, which leads 
to injury. You need to have a strong midsection to provide your body with 
the strength it needs to walk up stairs, pick up children, bend down to pick 
something up, or reach for something high on a shelf. No one is exempt from 
needing a strong core — not even at tax time!
What can I do to acquire core strength?
You can do many things to acquire core strength, all of which are in this 
book! You can vary the intensity of the many exercises in each chapter 
simply by adding more repetitions and increasing the number of sets you do.
And by some stroke of genius, walking is the number one form of core 
strengthening that anyone can do at every stage in life. Walking calls upon 
the internal abdominal muscles and your back muscles to facilitate each step 
you take, which creates a stronger corset or core. Hiking is effective also 
because you have the added resistance of a varied terrain as you walk up and 
down hills. And you can also try running, which helps speed up weight loss 
and lose that layer of fat that is inevitably covering up your washboard abs. 
Where is the best place to work out to get 
a stronger core?
At home! If you have to go to a gym or go outdoors, either bad weather will 
intervene or you’ll probably find some excuse to not make it out the door. 
Believe me, I’ve heard them all . . . and that’s why I’ve designed the exercises 
in this book to be done right at home (or at the gym, or anywhere else, for 
that matter!) so you have no excuse not to work out. The exercises in each 
chapter take up very little space — and you will even find a chapter on ten 
household items you can use to help train your core (see Chapter 21).
When should I do core training?
Any time of day is fine, as long as your muscles are warm. A lot of trainers 
will tell you to work out first thing in the morning, at the end of the day, or 
both. And a lot of good research exists to support such recommendations. 
But as far as I’m concerned, whatever works for you is best. If this statement 
sounds a little obvious, then get ready, here comes another one: It’s better 

12
Part I: Core Basics 
to do it than not do it. I mean that if you try to force yourself into a schedule 
that doesn’t really work for you, you probably won’t stick with your new 
core-training program. Find a time of day that’s convenient for you, and make 
that your special time for yourself.
 
Consistency is the key!
Why should I strengthen my core?
You should strengthen your core to make all your movements effortless 
and keep your body injury free. And if that’s not enough motivation, you 
should embark on core training so you can zip up your jeans or wear a 
belt around your waist. That’s enough motivation for anyone; I don’t care 
who you are . . . or when you had your baby! Fitting into those skinny jeans 
requires one key element: losing weight in your waist. And you can’t do that 
without core exercises.
The How’s of Core Strengthening
You may be wondering how you’re going to set your core-training plan into 
action. Following the exercises in this book is the first step and, lucky for 
you, I’ve also included the following, commonly asked “how” questions, 
which give you all the answers you need to get the job done.
How often should I exercise 
to strengthen my core?
To increase core strength in your abs and back muscles, the general rule is to 
do strengthening exercises at least three to five times a week. Elite athletes 
will obviously exercise more than that — two or even three times a day. But 
let’s be realistic. For those of us who are not getting paid to exercise and be 
in peak condition, it’s pretty difficult to find the time to work out that much. If 
you’re looking to increase your present level of fitness, I recommend that you 
engage in focused core exercises every other day. When you have reached 
your goal of toning your midsection and strengthening your back, I’m confi-
dent that you can maintain your new physique by doing the core exercises 
contained in this book three times a week.

13
 Chapter 1: Finding Your Core Strength
How long should I exercise each 
time I work out my core?
You’re going to love this next section, because I tell you that less is more! 
Studies have demonstrated that the optimum effectiveness of an exercise 
is reached after your heart rate is elevated for approximately 20 to 30 min-
utes. Train less, and you don’t really give your body time to adapt properly 
to your new elevated heart rate; train more, and you risk what I call, the 
burn-out factor. I’m sure you’re familiar with this problem: You embark on 
a new fitness program and go at it so fiercely and competitively that after 
a few weeks, you either have an injury or get really run down and have to 
take some time off. Moderation is the key to everything in life, so stick with 
the 20- to 30-minute rule before you increase the length of your workouts. 
Remember, slow and steady wins the race!
How intense should the exercise feel?
When it comes to working out your core, the old cliché “no pain, no gain” 
is definitely wrong. In fact, pain is the most precise indicator of an exercise 
that has gone too far, either in degree or in duration. If you’re exercising to 
the point that your muscles sizzle inside or are quivering, or you find that 
you are becoming less able to hold the position you are doing, back off. A 
core exercise should feel no more than slightly uncomfortable. When you 
reach the point of resistance in your abdominals, stay there and hold it for 
a moment before relaxing and taking a few breaths. You’ll find that you can 
increase your repetitions after a while or perhaps in a few days; if you force 
the issue, though, it’ll only set you back further than you were when you 
started. Keep the following ideas in mind when gauging the intensity of your 
exercising:
 
✓ You should feel slight exertion in the muscle that you are exercising. 
This tension should definitely not cross the line to pain or discomfort. 
The rest of your body should be in a position that is relaxed and totally 
tension free. If your body feels awkward or tense, modify the exercise by 
using a prop such as an exercise ball or pair of hand weights to help you 
focus on the intended muscle. Remember, exercise should be a positive 
experience, not a form of self-torture.
 
✓ You should feel the exertion of the exercise only in the intended 
muscle, never in a joint. Pain in your joints signals irritation in the joint, 
so you definitely want to let up if that happens. Conversely, you should 
not feel tension or tightness in any other part of your body. If you do, as 

14
Part I: Core Basics 
I mentioned before, ease up on the exercise or try using props like an 
exercise ball to modify the exercise. Throughout this book, I give you 
several different ways to do an abdominal crunch; if one doesn’t seem to 
fit your body, you’ll be better off trying one that feels more comfortable.
Should I see a doctor before I begin 
a core-strengthening program?
 
Always consult a physician before embarking on any new fitness program, 
even a seemingly low-impact program such as core training. But it’s impera-
tive that you speak to your health-care professional before undertaking a regu-
lar core exercise program if you have back problems or an injury that has not 
healed completely. Your doctor can advise you about specific exercises you 
can do to focus on or to avoid, and can help customize a core-training pro-
gram to help meet your unique needs.
 Benefits to Core Training
Go ahead — ask your doctor, your trainer, or your physical therapist 
whether you should do core-strengthening exercises. Get ready to hear the 
exact same answer from all of them: a resounding yes. Even though they 
don’t make a dime giving such advice, why would all these professionals so 
enthusiastically recommend core training? I give you the skinny in the sec-
tions that follow.
Overall benefits
Although the specific benefits of core training vary individually, remember 
these overall, general benefits that core training provides for everyone:
 
✓ Challenging exercises to help you get in touch with your body and tap 
into your inner core strength
 
✓ Increased performance in whatever sports you choose to do
 
✓ Injury prevention due to increased strength and stamina
 
✓ Functional exercises that provide additional ease of movements 
throughout your daily life and activities

Weight(less) benefits
As anyone may guess, having fat around the middle or belly fat has many 
drawbacks, including great health risks. Core training helps you not only look 
better, but also increase your health and chances at living a longer, more 
physically active life. Read on to find more ways core training will give you 
the preventative medicine you need for a lifetime.
Living longer
The fat that lies in the belly becomes part of your abdomen. As you widen 
and grow in the midsection, this fat gets stored in the deepest layer of the 
abdominal wall and disperses in the way of fatty acids into your bloodstream.
The fatty cells accumulate in your liver and, eventually, into your circulation. 
This build-up of fat cells can lead to type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and 
heart disease. The belly fat then becomes resistant to dieting and needs the 
help of targeted core training to whittle and tone the area. So besides getting 
a smaller waist, with core training, you’ll be saving your life!
Lowering blood pressure
Unfortunately, the risk of high blood pressure (better known as hyperten-
sion) increases with age. However, you don’t need to sit back and wait for 
hypertension or high blood pressure to strike. And that’s why you’re read-
ing this book, right? Regular exercise can help prevent high blood pressure, 
which, in turn, reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and even stroke. If 
your blood pressure is already high, regular exercise can help you control it 
for good.
Physical activity and exercise make your heart stronger, and thus able to 
pump more blood easier and with less effort. So the less your heart has to 
work, the less pressure or force is exerted on your arteries.
Interestingly, exercise can lower your blood pressure the same way some 
blood pressure medications can. And that should be enough to get you off 
the couch and going! Once you do, it takes approximately three months of 
regular exercise to have an impact or stabilize your blood pressure. And as 
long as you stick with exercise, the benefit of lowering your blood pressure 
will last a lifetime!
Lowering your risk of developing type 2 diabetes
Previously in this chapter, I talked about belly fat and how it affects the inter-
nal organs of your body — and just how resistant it becomes to dieting with-
out exercise to “shake it up.” Yes, there is a correlation between diabetes and 

16
Part I: Core Basics 
the location of fat in the body. People with a heavier deposit of fat around the 
hips and thighs have a higher risk for insulin resistance, high cholesterol, and 
high blood pressure.
Exercise, especially cardio and targeted core workouts, improves blood 
cholesterol. And you get this benefit from exercise even if you don’t lose any 
weight! Three months of regular exercise is the recommended guideline for 
lowering triglyceride levels in people with type 2 diabetes and increasing 
good cholesterol levels, or HDL. And the added bonus you get from exercis-
ing to control or lower your type 2 diabetes is that even your blood pressure 
returns to a better level.
Countering bone loss with exercise
Bone loss, or osteoporosis, is a real disease that affects men and women. It 
is especially prevalent in postmenopausal women because estrogen levels, 
which protect bones, drop after menopause. When bones become brittle, 
they weaken and put you at a greater risk of fracture.
Exercise of the right type, or weight-bearing exercises (see Chapter 10), helps 
keep bones strong by stimulating new bone cells to multiply and produce 
more bone. If you don’t like using dumbbells and weights, you can use the 
resistance of your own body weight, as I show in Chapter 13 with a series of 
push-ups and dips.
You can also use the weight of your own body to counter bone loss with 
cardio exercise like jogging, running, or, my fave of all time, jumping rope 
(see the skipping rope exercise in Chapter 4). The force you use to push 
each foot to the ground during “high-impact” cardio exercise helps build up 
muscle and strengthens the bones in your body. Stronger bones lead to fewer 
injuries because, when you fall, you don’t risk a fracture if your bones are 
strong — just one more great reason to get up and get going.
Added physical and mental bonuses
I’m sure you already know, but I do like to motivate with a reminder that 
exercise benefits your body and mind, and helps improve your level of fit-
ness. Weight-bearing exercise is best for strengthening bones. In the fol-
lowing sections, consider more examples of what core strengthening can 
specifically add to your game.
Better posture
Tall and erect posture not only makes you look leaner; it is also essential to 
allow your body to perform the way it was meant to. What’s more, good pos-
ture aids dramatically in facilitating free and effective breathing. The main 
enemy of good posture, however, is a weak lower back and slackened abs. 

17
 Chapter 1: Finding Your Core Strength
Core training can help you correct muscular imbalances that lead to incor-
rect skeletal alignment. One cause of this kind of imbalance is using one side 
of your body more than the other, like when you carry your toddler on the 
same side, or always carry your briefcase in the same hand, or perhaps even 
wear your shoulder bag on the same shoulder. Such chronic imbalances can 
rob you of energy and efficiency from movement, or even result in back pain. 
Regular core strengthening can help balance out these bad habits, so you’ll 
be sure to stand up straight.
Increased range of motion
Over time, muscles naturally tend to shorten and become tight. So as you age, 
your ability to fully utilize movement in your body becomes compromised. 
Strengthening the core of the body can help dramatically increase the range 
of motion in your joints, which not only enhances your performance in any 
chosen sport, but also helps in your everyday life by making it possible for you 
to reach higher or lower, bend farther, and reduce nagging aches and pains 
from weak muscles. You’ll gain an increased ability to function on a daily basis 
from having core strength — and you’ll also be able to tighten your belt!
Injury prevention
Numerous studies attest to the fact that core-strengthening exercises enable 
you not only to decrease the severity of injuries and the time it takes to 
recover from an injury, but also to reduce the chance of being injured in the 
first place. Core training has also been proven to reduce back pain when 
you accidentally overuse your muscles when engaging in sports. In short, 
although nothing can prevent injury completely, having a strong core can 
be a very low-cost, long-term insurance policy for your body, whether you 
engage in sports or not.
Stress reduction
Stress is a part of life! Some stress (a little) is even good and can help spur you 
on to take action and achieve great things. But too much stress can actually 
threaten your health and well-being. Although you can take advantage of sev-
eral ways of coping with stress, remember that exercise can be therapeutic. 
Of course, regular workouts can help individual muscles release and relax, but 
the deep, regular breathing that is so important to exercising can also oxygen-
ate your blood and produce a reduction in overall stress and anxiety. 
Regular core training promotes relaxation not only of your body, but also of 
your mind as you embark on exercises that tap into your inner strength (see 
Chapter 12 on using yoga poses with core training). Most of you expect that 
exercise helps individual muscles release tension and relax, but the regular 
breathing that is so important to effective exercise can also help oxygen-
ate your blood and produce a reduction in overall stress and anxiety. The 
exercises in a good core-strengthening program can provide an effect like 
a moving meditation, tapping into energy sources that lie deep within your 
inner abdominals as you position your body for the next exercise.

18
Part I: Core Basics 
Concentrated focus on each area in your core helps you target the muscles 
you’re working. Correct positioning and appropriate exertion that you need 
to use with the core exercises help block out other stress-inducing thoughts, 
such as your schedule, your finances, or your kids. In this way, exercise not 
only strengthens your body, but it expands your mind as well. And the rush 
you get from those naturally occurring hormones known as endorphins is a 
self-imposed high you can’t beat!
Reduced muscle soreness
For years doctors have thought that the achy feeling you get in your muscles 
after working out intensely was the result of lactic acid build-up in the tissues 
of your muscles. Lactic acid is a normal by-product of the process of turning 
oxygen into energy, also known as glycolysis. When you work extra hard, your 
blood does not carry enough oxygen to wash your muscles clean of lactic 
acid and a residue builds up. But now cutting-edge thinking attributes this 
discomfort to tiny tears in muscle fibers caused by the requirements of un-
familiar training (also known as eccentric movements). By helping to ensure 
that your muscles are strong and flexible with regular exercise and core 
training, you can protect yourself from sustaining the microscopic injuries 
caused by newly intense levels of exercise.
Decreased muscle tension
Strong muscles are one of the major benefits of core strengthening, along 
with decreased tension in your muscles. What may not be so obvious is the 
hidden toll persistent muscle tightness can take on you. For one thing, chron-
ically tight muscles can actually choke off their own circulation. This dimin-
ished blood flow can result in raised blood pressure, as well as a decrease 
in oxygen and nutrients in the muscle tissues, which can cause toxic waste 
products to build up in the cells. The end result is persistent fatigue, as well 
as aches and pains in your tense muscles.
What’s more, if a muscle stays partially contracted for an abnormally long 
time, the muscle can actually begin to shorten, which not only limits your 
range of motion, but also can weaken the muscle, create tightness, and make 
the muscle less effective.
And did you know that muscles that are constantly contracted require more 
energy to move than a relaxed muscle? As a result, you wind up wasting pre-
cious energy with every movement. So in addition to reducing tension in your 
muscles, a regular exercise and core-strengthening program can actually 
elevate the level of your overall health. Pretty amazing what preventative 
medicine exercise really is, isn’t it?

 Chapter 1: Finding Your Core Strength
Useful and Fun Techniques for 
Developing Core Strength
You probably agree that choosing the right form of exercise for yourself 
is very personal. Everyone prefers different flavors of ice cream; it’s the 
same with core training. Although the goal is always the same — to tone 
and whittle the waist and get a stronger back — you can accomplish that in 
some new and challenging ways. Here I share some of the ways that I find to 
be the most fun — and the best ones to help you forget about exercising in 
the first place!
Yoga
In Chapter 12, you’ll find different poses used in the practice of yoga that flow 
right through your core and challenge your strength! Yoga’s not for wimps! 
And people who think it is should take a class sometime just to see how 
intense it can be. Because yoga requires great strength to support the entire 
weight of your body as you hold a plank position seemingly for hours or hold 
your body straight in the air during a headstand, you will most likely walk 
away from any yoga class with a new admiration for anyone who practices 
it. Requiring more flexibility than a stretch class and more stamina than an 
aerobics class, yoga ranks right up there among my top five ways to get great 
abdominal strength and a really strong back (better known as your core).
Pilates
Pilates is a great core strengthener because all of its movements originate 
from your core (see Chapter 11 for Pilates-based core exercises). When 
Joseph Pilates first came up with his series of Pilates exercises, he created 
them to rehabilitate injuries of wounded patients during the war. With a 
system of pulleys and springs, he transformed hospital beds into a contrap-
tion used for physical therapy. The terms Pilates “reformer” and Pilate’s 
“bed” were derived from this system.
In Chapter 11, I show a series of “mat” exercises that are used on the 
reformer or Pilates bed once you’ve mastered them on the floor. They are all 
fabulous core strengtheners — fun but challenging to do!

Wii Fit
Wow! New moms are in love with Wii Fit, and so are kids and their parents. 
And now I know why: It’s fun and very hip to do. Wii fit is a video game that 
helps you build and tone your muscles as you watch and play along on the 
television. How fun is that? It even helps you lose weight with all kinds of 
new programs that have you jogging in place and even doing yoga (one of the 
most popular ones with the ladies).
What Wii Fit really is, however, is just a clever way to get you to work out, 
disguised as a video game. You can choose from many options if you want 
to train your core, and you can even enter your individual fitness level. After 
you do, you’re given other menu items to chose from, which makes Wii Fit 
fun and engaging at the same time. And I know your friends will want to use 
it once they hear about it, because everyone wants to be in the know when it 
comes to something new, right?
Of course, the Wii Fit initial sell-out success across the country prompted a 
lot of press, but the real question is, does it work? If you haven’t made it out 
of the house to the gym or taken a walk lately, it definitely works! In other 
words, it’s better than sitting around thinking about working out, especially 
for busy moms who don’t have time to make it to the gym — it’s perfect!

Training with a partner
If you’re anything like me, having someone waiting for you to work out helps 
because you know you have to show up! And a training partner who encour-
ages you and depends on you is the perfect complement to any workout ses-
sion. By helping you with your form or counting out your reps, a partner can 
help you get far more out of your core routine than you may be able to do on 
your own.
Good, consistent communication is the key to helping each other exercise 
properly, and so is knowing when someone has been pushed to his limits. 
Go slow, talk, and listen, and you’ll be amazed at the speedy progress you 
will make. Together you can encourage each other and try new exercises 
you may not be able to alone (see Chapter 17 for a few fun exercises to help 
strengthen your core as a pair). Pair up and don’t disappoint the person wait-
ing for you — use the buddy system!

 Chapter 1: Finding Your Core Strength
Got Skills? Get Core Strength
Okay, here’s my roundup of sports that I think are pretty well rounded! 
Training your core for different sports makes you a better athlete or perhaps 
just a better weekend warrior.
Check this list to see if doing any of the following sports could enhance your 
performance with the core-strengthening exercises in this book.
Running and hiking
When you go for a run or a hike, you use the core muscles in your abs and 
back to move your legs, known as the large muscle groups in the lower half. 
These muscles need strengthening so they can support all the dynamic 
movements your body demands as you run with force and place tons of pres-
sure on your lower-back muscles.
I suggest trying the core exercises in Chapter 6 as a perfect complement to 
any running, hiking, or biking program. Those exercises help you strengthen 
your abdominals and encourage you to stand tall as you move swiftly along.
Racquet sports
If you play racquet sports, you may notice that you generally use one side of 
your body — or the dominant arm — more than the other, thus creating an 
imbalance, or asymmetry, between your two sides. When training for racquet 
sports, remember to always strengthen both sides equally because an imbal-
ance can lead to injury. I suggest using weights to strength your arms and 
waist on both sides of your body equally, as I show in Chapter 10. And check 
out my model with no shirt, while you’re at it — he does a lot of core training, 
and it shows!
Basketball
Basketball is truly a total-body sport that requires some very specific move-
ments to shoot the ball and move with maximum mobility. The core exer-
cises in this book will truly help increase your jump shot, your power, and 
hopefully your ability to make your free throws (for you, Shaq . . . nobody’s 
perfect!). Try the exercises in Chapter 14 if you’re a real basketball player, or 
even if you just want to whittle your middle and move faster!

22
Part I: Core Basics 
Football
Because of the enormous number of collisions that occur regularly in foot-
ball, a strong and flexible core is essential. Coaches and trainers put a lot of 
time into making sure their athletes are strong and flexible, to protect them 
from severe injuries.
However, sometimes you see a football player who seems to concentrate 
only on being big and not having a six-pack or washboard abs. Big may be 
good for tackling another person, but you still have to be able to get back up 
using your abs and back after you get knocked down. Try Chapter 8 if you’re 
at interested in doing that just that; it will test your strength, I guarantee!
Swimming
I don’t know about you, but I’ve never seen a swimmer with an ounce of body 
fat! In fact, of all the sports I mention, I think swimmers as a group have the 
best cores of all. Maybe because they’re stretched out in the water all day 
long and forced to use the power of their back and legs to move them through 
it, or maybe because their lats and waist get defined with every swimming 
stroke there is. Whatever the case may be, swimmers have strong cores and 
undoubtedly know the importance of core strength. Swimmers, take note: 
Strong and toned abs and back muscles go a long way toward increasing your 
range of motion in your stroke and, therefore, your overall speed.
Skiing
Skiing requires good coordination, balance, and, of course, a strong core to 
help you move around those large hills of snow! The stronger your back and 
legs are, the looser you are when you ski, making you more agile so you’ll be 
able to maneuver your skis better.
Soccer
Soccer is all about the lower body and engaging the abs, butt, and back 
for speed and range of motion. The core gets called upon constantly when 
kicking the ball and lifting your leg to do so. For every movement in soccer, 
whether it’s running down the field or passing the ball down the field, your 
core needs to be tight to control all the small and twisting movements that 
your back needs. See Chapter 7 for some butt and core exercises that will 
have you playing like . . . what’s his name? Oh, yeah, bend it like Beckham!

23
 Chapter 1: Finding Your Core Strength
Cycling
Cyclists are another group that you may never see an ounce of fat on, and that’s 
because cycling combines cardio with core- and lower-body-strengthening 
exercise. Anyone who’s ever ridden a bike for a long time knows how tight 
your back can get from bending over for long stretches. The power you need 
to push the pedals also requires great back and abdominal strength.
For some good core strengtheners to increase your distance, I suggest the 
bicycle crunch in Chapter 5. It not only works your abs better than tradi-
tional crunches, but the twisting motion you get when you do a bicycle 
crunch tones and tightens your waist muscles, too. It’s great for making fast 
turns when cycling!
Gymnastics
Gymnastics requires a strong body, which is evident when you look at any 
gymnast on television during the Olympics. Strong back, tight abdominals, 
and a killer tush! All great core assets! As a gymnast springboards or vaults 
into a pose, you can bet she’s using her core muscles to get there. The 
foundation of every movement a gymnast makes is located in the core. The 
extremities of the body, the arms and legs, are used only as anchors when 
the gymnast gets where she’s going.
Step aerobics
Your core muscles propel all the fast and furious moves you’ll find in an 
aerobics class. Stepping, pumping, and so on in a step aerobics class require 
strong butt and lower-back muscles located in your core. These powerhouse 
muscles work along with the abdominals to help you move effortlessly 
through step sequences. And just as in gymnastics, the arms and legs serve 
as anchors to help steady you as you move throughout the movements.
Weight lifting
Any weight-bearing exercise uses your core, or “bridge,” of the body to tran-
sition all the movements. In fact, any resistance exercise requires you to 
engage your abdominals to contract as you pick up something or pull it into 
your body, or push it over your head. If you try doing any of these exercises 
with weak abdominals, you’ll be hunching your shoulders and rounding 
your back before you know it! Lifting any kind of weight, either body weight 

24
Part I: Core Basics 
or hand weights, requires you to use your core strength. And when you 
add cardio, you’ll start shedding the outside layer of fat over your six-pack 
or washboard abs. Don’t worry, they’re there — they just haven’t peeked 
through yet.
Walking
I mentioned before that walking is the number one exercise for strengthening 
core muscles and losing weight. That’s because each step you take uses the 
same frequent motion that calls upon your butt, hip, back, and abdominal 
muscles.
Because all the core areas are called upon at the same time to work together, 
each step increases the potential for weight loss and enhances your core 
training. Walking is the best form of exercise because you can do it anywhere 
and at any stage in your life. The only thing that will change is your pace!
Using Exercise Balls to 
Build Core Strength
 
The most portable and most popular of all the accessories to help people 
build or rebuild core strength is still the exercise ball (take a look at Exercise 
Balls For Dummies by yours truly). The exercise ball is unsurpassed for core 
strengthening, and the exercise ball is the main piece of equipment you’ll 
need. Cost-effective at around $20, it also doesn’t require much room in 
your home. In addition, it is relatively maintenance free, so you won’t have 
to worry about repairing it if it breaks or even about getting a new one, as 
you would with a treadmill, elliptical trainer, or universal weight machine. 
Exercise balls are the best for working your core muscles because they pro-
vide a lack of stability that requires you to use your abdominal and back 
muscles to maintain your balance and steady yourself. Because an exercise 
ball is the easiest piece of equipment to transport, it’s ideal if you’re traveling 
and don’t want to miss a workout.
In addition, the portability of the core exercises in this book makes these 
exercises easy to do anywhere and at any time. And if you’ve decided to use 
the exercise ball to help you achieve your core-training goals faster, you can 
find one at the gym for you to use. Check out the following sections to find 
out the advantages and disadvantages of gym or in-home training so you can 
pick the right one for you.

 Chapter 1: Finding Your Core Strength
Using core exercise balls at the gym
When you walk onto the training floor at your local gym or health center, 
you’ll notice an abundance of balls used for core training. (Many gyms pro-
vide group classes for core training and provide a ball for you.)
Gyms that carry balls usually sell them at the retail stores located inside the 
clubs. At the club retail stores, most balls are already filled with air, which 
serves two purposes:
 
✓ You can see the actual size of the ball and try it out.
 
✓ Professionals can fill the ball with air to its correct diameter.
 
Keep in mind that, as with anything you’d purchase at a boutique-type store 
(like a yoga mat), you’ll probably pay more for a ball at your local gym unless 
it comes with some kind of a health club discount.
Using core exercise balls at home
When it comes to joining a gym, membership fees at most gyms seem to be 
climbing fast — plus you have to commit for a full year. For a lot of people, 
this cost gives just one more excuse they need to not achieve their fitness 
goal and put off working out. Even more intimidating is the fact that you can 
see all different kinds of equipment on the racks and floor at the gym, and 
need to pay a trainer to just learn how to use them! Sometimes even I get con-
fused finding the differences between all these different machines and pieces 
of equipment and how I’m supposed to use them.
That’s where your home gym comes in! And I’m going to help you build it so 
you can increase your core strength and put on muscle instead of spending 
your hard-earned money on a gym membership that you’ll never use.
Best core exercises to do 
with the exercise ball
The following is the best of the best pulled from the chapters in this book. 
You can use the core-strengthening exercises in this book with your new 
accessory, and I’ve included where to find them in each chapter.

26
Part I: Core Basics 
Abdominal crunches
The sit-up or ab crunch on the ball (Chapter 9), which has you lying with 
your lower back on the ball and doing crunches as you normally would, tar-
gets the abdominal muscles. Do these slowly for one set of ten repetitions to 
start, before adding on more sets.
Bridge lifts
The bridge lift in Chapter 9 is an all-over good position to use on the ball for 
core training. Lie on your back, place the ball under your feet, and slowly lift 
your hips off the floor. When you’ve found your balance, try using your butt 
and hamstring muscles to curl the ball toward your butt and back out again. 
Perform one set of ten reps.
Squats with ball
Squats! Can’t beat them for sore work. In Chapter 13, you’ll use the classic 
squat position, then hold the ball out in front of you at chest level and per-
form squats. Perform one set of ten reps.
Push-ups with feet on the ball
The push-ups in Chapter 9 call on your abdominals, back, and butt muscles. 
Place your hands shoulder width apart on the floor and, keeping your stom-
ach muscles tense, perform a standard push-up. These ball push-ups are a lot 
harder than traditional push-ups, so aim for only one set of ten reps.
Wall squats
To work your abs, hips, and butt, place the ball behind your lower back 
between you and a wall. Squat slowly, allowing the ball to roll along the wall 
against your back. Do one set of ten to begin.
You can perform the weight-training exercises in Chapter 13, like the chest 
press and the overhead press, while sitting on the ball. That way, you get 
the benefit of working your core and your other body parts at the same time. 
You use your abdominal muscles to stabilize yourself on the ball — in other 
words, to keep from falling off! Use lighter weights until you get used to 
sitting on the ball, and do one set of ten reps for each exercise.

Reshaping Your Core
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing what muscles are targeted in your core workout
▶ Understanding how having a strong core means gaining a stronger back
▶ Discovering the results you can reap from having a stronger core
▶ Breathing properly using your core muscles 
▶ Taking good care of your core
M
any health and fitness experts have realized that it’s important to 
strengthen the core muscles along with the other muscles in the 
body. By strengthening the core, experts have found that it can lessen a lot of 
health problems concerning posture and other back problems.
So what that means is that a well-conditioned core leads to good posture and 
increased endurance of the back all day long. That’s because muscles that 
are located in the core are actually the ones that initiate the proper stabiliza-
tion of the whole upper and lower torso of the body.
For those who wish to know and understand why it is important to 
strengthen the core muscles, I give you a quick refresher on the muscles 
located in your core that will be assisting you in your workouts. The pictures 
of the muscles located in your core contained in this chapter will give you a 
reference of how they connect your core to the rest of your body. 
Rounding Up Your Core Muscles
Swimming, running, and biking all require one thing: good core strength. You 
can pedal harder, run longer, and swim faster with core training because, as 
you know by now, a weak core means a weak body. But it’s hard to train your 
core if you’re not sure what it is, so in the following sections, I unveil the 
mystery of your core muscles.

28
Part I: Core Basics 
Checking out your core muscles
To identify the core muscles shown in Figure 2-1, please read the following 
to gain a better understanding of what muscles you’ll be using when you’re 
working on getting that six pack.
The core is so much more than the rectus abdominus and the erector 
spinea — I mean, the abs and back. The core also includes all the muscles 
that lie deep within the midsection or torso, from the hips (pelvis) all the 
way up to and including the neck and shoulders. These muscles lying deep 
within the core include:
 
✓ Multifidus: The deep spinal muscles that run segmentally from the neck 
to the sacrum or the center bone in the chest.
 
✓ External obliques: The side waist muscles or abdominal muscles that 
attach at the lower ribs, pelvis, and abdominal fascia.
 
✓ Internal obliques: The internal waist muscles or abdominal muscles that 
attach at the lower ribs, rectus sheath, pelvis, and thoracolumbar fascia.
 
✓ Transversus abdominis: The abdominal muscles that attach at the 
lower ribs, pelvis, thoracolumbar fascia, and rectus sheath.
 
 The external obliques, internal obliques, and transverses abdominus all 
work together as abdominal muscles that stabilize the lumbar spine.
 
✓ Rectus abdominis: The one you’ve heard of the most and referred to as 
“abs” is the primary abdominal muscle that attaches to the lower sternum 
and the front of the pubic bone. It stretched the entire length of the torso 
and most people think there are two sets of upper and lower abs but there 
really is just one — and it can be exercised with only one exercise.
 
✓ Erector spinae: Better known as the spine — these muscles attach at the 
base of the skull.
 
✓ Quadratus lumborum: This muscle actually stabilizes the lumbar spine 
and helps it “flex” in all directions.
 
✓ Latissimus dorsi: My favorite! Referred to as the lats — this muscle is 
the largest spinal stabilizer and helps perform all the pulling motions 
through the arms. When you work your lats you get a nice “v” shape in 
your upper back, which makes you look like you have a smaller waist! 
That’s why it’s my fave!
 
✓ Thoracolumbar fascia: Something like a net, this connects and holds the 
lats, glutes (butt), internal obliques, and transverse abdominis, and sup-
ports the spine. It’s very important to your body but not as recognized 
as the glutes!

29
 Chapter 2: Reshaping Your Core
 
✓ Abdominal fascia: Like a network of wires, these muscles connect the 
obliques and rectus abdominis to the pecs or pectoralis major.

What is core stabilization 
and where can I get some?
Core stabilization is the expression used for how the muscles in your trunk 
keep your spine and your body stable. When all the muscles in your core 
work together, you’ll see the following results:
 
✓ Better posture
 
✓ More powerful and efficient movements
 
✓ A more balanced body
 
✓ Fewer injuries 
 
✓ Tighter internal and external muscles
 
✓ Better control over your extremities (arms and legs)
My favorite core stabilizers
I picked three of my favorite core stabilizing muscles to give you an example 
of what they are and how they assist your core. There are many more but 
these are the ones I like to exercise the most because they make a big differ-
ence in how my core looks and feels — strong!

Part I: Core Basics 
Rectus abdominus
The rectus abdominus is actually a long, flat muscle that extends across the 
entire length of the front of the abdomen. It is separated in the middle by the 
linea alba, which is translated as “white line.”
Most commonly referred to as “abs,” the rectus abdominus is the muscle 
responsible for flexing the lumbar spine when doing a sit-up. Terms such as 
six-pack and washboard abs apply to the rectus abdominus muscle . . . and, 
yes, you need to be familiar with this muscle if you’re going to be doing core 
exercises because you’ll be calling upon the rectus abdominus a lot!
Latissimus dorsi
Want a tiny waist? Work your latissimus dorsi, better known as “lats.” The 
latissimus dorsi is the back area that looks bumpy when women wear their 
bras too tight. It runs from your armpit to your butt and also incorporates 
your midback for doing exercises targeted at the lats. This region is one of 
my favorites to work out because it makes my waist look so much smaller!
Gluteus maximus
The gluteus maximus, better known as glutes, is one of the largest and stron-
gest muscles in the body. It starts at the pelvic bone and attaches to the rear 
side of the femur. The glutes are made up of three muscles, actually: the 
maximus, the medius, and the minimus. The medius and the minimus both lie 
directly underneath the maximus. (All sounds so Latin, doesn’t it?) And the 
medius and the minimus both start at the same point as the maximus but (no 
pun intended!) attach to the side of the femur instead of the rear of the femur.
Definitely the powerhouse of the body, the butt, the glutes, the booty — 
whatever you want to call it — is a strong muscle to help with core stabilization.
Technically speaking . . . opposites attract!
If you’ve ever wondered what makes your mus-
cles move and the doctor inside you is dying to 
know how the muscles technically work, here’s 
a breakdown on the way your body makes the 
majority of its movements: 
 
 A primary muscle or the agonist, is assisted 
by one or more secondary muscles or the 
synergists; together they stretch the oppos-
ing muscle which is the antagonist.
As an example of this, when you bend your 
knee, the muscles on the back of your leg, 
including your hamstring (which would be the 
agonist) and your gastrocnemius (your calf, 
which would be the synergist) contract, and in 
turn stretches the quadriceps (the antagonist). 
Another example would be during a biceps 
curl, the biceps is the agonist and the triceps 
is the antagonist . . . sounds a lot like my ex-
husband!

 Chapter 2: Reshaping Your Core
Uncovering Key Core Principles
What makes a healthy core? For that matter, what makes a healthy body? 
Well, you can take a few steps to enhance your health and your core training. 
I’ve listed a few principles that can keep your new core program running sol-
idly and smoothly:
 
✓ Release it and let it go. Don’t hold muscle tension in your body! If your 
muscles are constantly in a state of contraction, you can never increase 
in strength and flexibility. Try to exercise in a state of relaxation, to see 
the full benefits of strengthening your core. If you hold tension in your 
glutes, be sure to release it before you start each repetition so that you 
will see and feel the changes in your body faster.
 
✓ Be aware of body awareness. Pay attention to what is happening in 
your body and with your muscles as you are exercising. Be mindful of 
your movements and think about the muscle you are working. It helps to 
visualize each body part as you contract it and focus all your energy on 
that area. Try it; it really does make a difference.
 
✓ Choose the best lifestyle possible. Life is all about making choices, isn’t 
it? So why not make the best choices for you? Eating right and exercising 
regularly are what I like to call “lifetime commitments to fitness.” And 
that’s what I want for you . . . to make a lifetime commitment to fitness! 
Nobody’s perfect, so don’t be too hard on yourself. But do try to stay 
motivated. Before you know it, you’ll be motivating others.
 
✓ Warm up properly. When the muscles and connective tissues around 
a muscle are warm, they work better. Increasing your internal tempera-
ture and getting your heart rate up are imperative before exercising. You 
can avoid injury and set yourself up for the best workout ever with a 
good warm-up.
Benefits of having less belly fat
Reducing belly fat or abdominal fat through core 
training doesn’t just help your figure. It also 
reduces your risk of disease — and that’s good 
news! If you’re a man with a waist larger than 
40 inches, it’s time to get up and get moving. If 
you’re a woman with a waist size greater than 
35 inches, you need to do the same. The inher-
ent risks of being overweight, especially in the 
belly area, are associated with type 2 diabe-
tes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, 
which puts you at risk for heart disease. The 
strange thing is, it doesn’t happen all at once. If 
you gain only 2 pounds a year, by the end of ten 
years, you will be 20 pounds heavier! And that 
kind of weight gain is detrimental to your health 
and to your body.

Part I: Core Basics 
Breathing with Core Muscles 
for Better Results
One of the most important benefits of exercise is its ability to promote 
relaxation not only of your body, but of your mind and spirit as well. You 
would expect that exercise and the release of endorphins can help individual 
muscles release tension and relax, but the deep, regular breathing that is so 
important to effective exercise can also oxygenate your blood and produce a 
reduction in overall stress and anxiety.
Believe it or not, humans breathe in and out more than 20,000 times a day, 
and yet most people do it incorrectly. I hear you asking right now, how is 
it possible to breathe wrong? Air goes in, air goes out. Pretty simple, right? 
Well, not so quick. Because of poor posture or lack of body awareness you 
end up using the wrong muscles to breathe, which results in shallow, ineffec-
tive breathing, and robs you of the full benefits of your breath. In this section, 
I explain to you not only what muscles you need to use to breathe most effec-
tively, but I also give a foolproof method for taking good core breaths.
The lung itself has no muscles, so it’s totally dependent on the muscles 
around it to create the respiratory process of inhaling and exhaling. This 
respiratory process can happen in one of two ways:
 
✓ By using the muscles that lift and lower the ribcage — the shoulders 
and chest
 
✓ By using the muscles of the diaphragm
Unfortunately, most people use the muscles of their shoulders and chest to 
inhale and exhale. Although these muscles are large and powerful, breathing 
is not really what they were designed for. Instead, the primary location of the 
movement of respiration should be the diaphragm, which only has one func-
tion: breathing (see Chapter 12).
A full, deep breath can enhance your exercise experience by helping your 
body to relax and by oxygenating your muscles to increase their perfor-
mance. Just remember, to get all these wonderful benefits, you need to 
breathe the way your body was designed — from your core.
To take a full, deep breath from you core, follow these steps:
 
1. Inhale through your nose so that your nose can filter and warm the air 
before using it.
 
2. Exhale through your mouth, consciously using your deep abdominal 
muscles and diaphragm to push the air out.

33
 Chapter 2: Reshaping Your Core
 
Of course, even if you follow the right steps to a proper core breath, you can 
further enhance your breathing by maintaining good posture. A rounded 
back, dropped shoulders, and a forward head can reduce the ability of the 
diaphragm to contract and the ribs to expand to their full potential. So, sit up 
or stand up tall with your shoulders back and eyes gazing straight forward to 
help with good posture and aid in taking the perfect breath. 
Testing Your Core Strength 
The very best motivation to stick with an exercise program is to see results, 
which is why I’ve developed a core self-test. This test simply and easily 
accomplishes two important goals: 
 
✓ To give you a good indication of where you’re weak and where your 
imbalances might be so you know where to focus your strengthening 
program
 
✓ To mentally track and record your increases in strength over time so 
you can see how far you’ve come.
 
Developing core strength will not happen overnight. Set realistic goals and 
start with easy exercises before moving on to the more advanced ones. 
Because no two people are alike some people may see results more quickly 
and dramatically than others, but as long as you’re seeing improvement and 
enjoying yourself you’ll have a much better chance of making exercise a life-
long program, which is what it’s all about.
In the following sections, I not only list what you need to have to get started 
with core testing, but I take you through each exercise so that you can plainly 
see which areas of your body need the most attention.
Getting what you need to test your core
When you first do this self-test it will probably take you about 15 minutes or 
so to complete. Eventually, after you’ve begun core training and come back 
to it, you will be more familiar with the exercises and using proper form, so 
it’ll take you less time.
To get started I suggest that you use the following:
 
✓ Comfortable, breathable, and loose fitting clothes.
 
✓ An exercise mat or carpeted floor. You will need a space large enough to 
lie down comfortably.

34
Part I: Core Basics 
 
✓ Firm chair or exercise bench.
 
✓ Sturdy pair of tennis shoes.
 
✓ A five- to ten-pound pair of dumbbells.
 
You’ll have better results if you’re warm before you attempt the test exercises 
later in this section. Head to Chapter 4 for a few examples of warming up.
Using your results to design a program
I know that taking tests is nobody’s favorite thing to do, but you can make 
this one fun because you know it will result in a stronger core. Performing 
exercises that involve more than one muscle group at a time makes it difficult 
to determine which muscle is tight or is causing the weakness in your body. 
My test exercises isolate individual muscles to give you the most useful infor-
mation possible to design your own customized core-strengthening program.
After you’ve done the self-test, you will know exactly what muscles need 
the most attention. Then simply go to the chapter containing specific core 
exercises for that area and choose the one that feels most comfortable for 
your body.
Also, you may notice that most of the core test exercises use both the 
right and left side of your body. It’s not uncommon to have one side of 
your body that’s stronger than the other but it’s important to try to get 
both sides equal in core stabilization and to create good symmetry and 
balance in the body.
T-raises: Testing your upper 
back and chest
It is so important to test your strength in your upper back and chest to see 
if you have what it takes to start core training. Don’t forget to pull in your 
abdominal muscles before trying this one.
This test exercise requires you to pull your weights straight up directly 
through the centerline or midsection of your body. It will test the strength in 
your chest, arms, shoulders, and upper back as well.
To do this test exercise, follow these steps:

35
 Chapter 2: Reshaping Your Core
 
1. Standing tall and holding your weights down at your sides, slowly 
raise your weights until they’re straight out in front of you at chest 
level (as shown in Figure 2-2a).
 
2. Then like an airplane or a “T,” move your arms out to either side of 
your body (see Figure 2-2b).
 
3. Return to starting position by bringing your arms back into the cen-
terline of your chest using a “T” shape, before lowering your weights 
back down to your sides.

When you perform this test exercise:
 
✓ Keep your back straight during this exercise.
 
✓ Avoid letting your arms move above your shoulders with the weights.
 
✓ Pull in your abs or pretend you’re tightening your belt during this test 
exercise.

36
Part I: Core Basics 
Seated core rotation: Testing 
the trunk or midsection
Core stabilization describes how the muscles of your trunk help keep your 
body and spine stable. Core stabilization helps you stay balanced when you 
move. It’s difficult to isolate the muscles of your trunk because many muscles 
are involved in the complex movement of your spine. Therefore the next test 
exercise will measure the range of motion you have in your trunk as a whole.
The biggest benefit to having strong lower back muscles is being less prone 
to injury. Plus, strong abdominal muscles mean stronger back muscles 
because these muscle groups work together to form the core of the body.
The seated core rotation actually increases the rotational movement in your 
spine, which in turn helps you acquire strength and flexibility in your trunk 
by stretching out your lower back muscles.
To do this test core exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Sit up tall on a sturdy chair with your feet flat on the floor and close 
together, knees at a right angle.
 
2. Anchor your right hand on the side of the chair as you place your left 
hand on the outside of your right thigh (see Figure 2-3a).
 
3. Inhale and as you exhale, twist your torso to the right, and look back 
over your shoulder (see Figure 2-3b).
 
4. Hold the exercise for about ten seconds.
 
 Try to make a mental note of a stationary object you see that’s about at 
eye level.
 
5. Release and come back to center.
 
6. Inhale again, and as you exhale repeat on the opposite side.
 
 Find the same object you were looking at, but this time try to find 
another object that’s past it.
While doing the seated core rotation, remember to:
 
✓ Keep your feet flat on the floor.
 
✓ Keep your knees and feet together and facing the front.
 
✓ Avoid forcing the stretch or pulling too hard on the back of the chair.
 
✓ Find an object that’s at eye level — don’t look down.

Back and butt extensions: 
Testing the buttocks
The largest muscle of the body that helps move you and helps with core 
stabilization are the muscles in your buttocks — now see, you weren’t just 
imagining that your behind was the biggest thing on your body! Your buttock 
muscles combined with the back muscles, pelvis, and hips on the other side 
of your body are the powerhouse or core stabilizers.
Core stabilization strengthens the muscles of the buttocks and teaches you 
to use the inner muscles before you start to move with the outer muscles. 
When doing butt exercises, the focus becomes on smooth coordinated move-
ment along with the muscles of your back.
This back and butt test exercise seems simple yet it is a powerful and effec-
tive back and butt strengthener. It targets the lower back and your butt when 
you squeeze it tight to keep your core lifted off the floor.
To do this test exercise, follow these steps:

38
Part I: Core Basics 
 
1. Using a mat or towel, lie on your stomach placing your arms at your 
sides with palms facing up (see Figure 2-4a).
 
2. Pulling in or contracting your abdominal muscles, lift your chest a few 
inches off the floor keeping your gaze straight ahead at all times (see 
Figure 2-4b).
 
3. Hold for a few seconds before lowering your chest back toward the 
ground.
 
 Repeat this test a few times.

While doing back and butt extensions, keep these tips in mind:
 
✓ Tighten your butt or glutes to protect your lower back as you lift your 
chest off the floor.
 
✓ Tighten your abdominals throughout this move.
 
✓ Lift only to the point that you’re not straining your back — don’t lift too 
high off the floor.

Getting Started: Your 
Core Guidelines
In This Chapter
▶ Getting the most out of your core-strengthening program
▶ Finding out what makes up a healthy core
▶ Using proper exercise technique to acquire core strength
▶ Determining your fitness level with some basic testing
Yep — sit-ups suck! And so does most core work. But if you have a 
weak core, everything else in your body will suffer. On the other hand, 
strengthening your core helps your body bridge the gap between the upper 
and lower body by enhancing your movements and creating good form. Your 
posture, your spine, and your backbone all line up better with core training 
and help all of your sports and functional movements become more efficient. 
And along with core strength comes an improvement in all sports and func-
tional movements you use throughout the day. In this chapter, I lay out core 
guidelines for you to follow as you work your way through this book. 
Finding Your Fitness Level
You need to know whether you can even begin core training, let alone where 
you can begin. Determining where you need to be with this program (or 
whether you’re fit enough to begin it in the first place) is important. You want 
to minimize your risk of injury by starting with the proper amount of exer-
cise. For example, if you work out at a moderate level, you may be able to do 
two sets of abdominal crunches instead of just one, as I prescribe for begin-
ners in this book.
The following sections give you some questions to ask yourself to determine 
whether you’re ready to start and, if so, how much you should be doing.

40
Part I: Core Basics 
Determining whether you’re ready to begin
Some of you may work out daily, and some of you may not work out at all. 
However, because I don’t know you personally or know where you are physi-
cally in your exercise regime, you need to answer a few questions before you 
can begin core training.
So wherever you are on your path to fitness, take a moment to ask yourself 
the following questions:
 
✓ Do you breathe heavily when walking up stairs?
 
✓ Do you experience chest pains before, during, or after exercising?
 
✓ Do you have any injuries that would prevent you from exercising proper 
form when beginning a new workout?
 
✓ Do you take prescription medication for heart disease or high blood 
pressure?
 
✓ Do you get dizzy when exercising?
 
If you answered yes to any of the above questions, ask your doctor before 
beginning any exercise. As the saying goes, “An ounce of prevention is worth a 
pound of cure.” I call this preventive medicine, so consult your doctor before 
you get started, just to be safe!
Figuring out where to start
Everyone wants to be advanced and jump right in to every exercise with 
the ability to rip off 30 reps without any trouble. But the reality is, not quite 
everyone falls into that category. If you know (or your doctor has told you) 
you’re healthy enough to begin core training, find out whether you’re a 
beginner, intermediate, or advanced exerciser. I’ve included some questions 
to help you determine where you fall. You may be wondering why I left out 
“intermediate” . . . well, I didn’t. If you fall somewhere between the guidelines 
for beginner and advanced, consider yourself intermediate.
Ask yourself the following questions to find out where your fitness level falls:
 
✓ How often do you work out? To keep your body from detraining or 
breaking down precious muscle, you want to exercise at least three 
times a week consistently. Using that as your gauge, determine where 
you are on your path to fitness and go from there.
 
• Beginner: If you paused a moment to think about it, I’m going to 
take a chance here and put you in the beginner category. 

41
 Chapter 3: Getting Started: Your Core Guidelines
 
• Intermediate/advanced: If your answer is that you exercise three 
to five times per week, I will be putting you in the intermediate to 
advanced category. You should also have be working out consis-
tently for 6 to 12 months to make this more advanced category 
and have seen some significant changes in your body along with a 
greater endurance level. 
 
✓ How much cardio do you get? Aerobic exercise is really important for 
good circulation and to help maintain a healthy heart. Cardio activity 
provides oxygen to your blood, and blood pumping through your veins 
keeps everything running smoothly — and helps you sleep better, too!
 
• Beginner: If you’re doing only 60 to 90 minutes of cardio a week, 
you have room for improvement and I would place you in the 
beginner category.
 
• Intermediate/advanced: If you’re walking regularly for 30 minutes 
daily, that’s excellent! In fact, walking is my favorite form of aerobic 
exercise. I prescribe walking to all age groups and demographics, 
no matter what stage of life they’re in.
 
 How often do you engage in strength or resistance training?
 
• Beginner: If you haven’t used weights, you are definitely a begin-
ner and need to start (check out the sidebar “Osteoporosis,” later 
in this chapter). Any form of strength training enhances your 
health, speeds up weight loss, and builds a healthier body. Using 
your own body weight as resistance, such as performing push-ups 
or dips, is fantastic, too. You need a certain amount of strength in 
your back and abdominals to begin, so start slowly with core train-
ing and give yourself time to build up strength as you progress 
through the exercises in this book.
 
• Intermediate/advanced: A good rule of thumb is, if you’ve been 
regularly doing strength training for at least three months, you’re 
good to go with core training and are in the intermediate to 
advanced category. 
 
✓ How often do you stretch? Not stretching and just doing strength-training 
exercises and cardio creates an imbalance in your body. To prevent inju-
ries and learn how to maintain balance, you have to do some stretching. 
 
• Beginner: If you’re new to stretching and your range of motion is 
very limited, put yourself in the beginner category and build your 
flexibility slowly by holding the stretches in this book only until 
you feel comfortable.
 
• Intermediate/advanced: If you regularly take yoga or Pilates 
classes are flexible enough to touch your toes or place the palms 
of your hands on the floor, your are definitely in the intermediate/
advanced category.

Picking Up Pointers for 
Your Level of Fitness
If you know your level of fitness (if not, read through the section “Finding 
Your Fitness Level,” earlier in this chapter, to find out), check out the follow-
ing information so you know how often and how hard you should be working.
 
Core training two times per week is best for all levels, along with some form 
of cardio training three times a week. That regimen makes up a really well-
rounded workout and also makes for a well-rounded derriere!
Beginners
If you decide you’re at the beginner level for core strengthening, start by 
doing ten repetitions. Also start by doing only one set; you can add a set 
when you feel that you’ve fully mastered using the proper form while per-
forming the core exercises. Listen to your body and move forward when you 
feel it’s time to increase your level of resistance.
Intermediate
If you’ve decided that you’re ready to work at the intermediate level, doing 
15 repetitions is best for you. Start by doing only one set of core exercises; 
if you feel that you’re using proper form and are ready to take on another 
set, go for it. If that feels like too much for your body, complete two weeks of 
training before you add another set of 15 repetitions to each exercise.
Advanced
If you’re exercising at an advanced level, start with 20 repetitions. You can 
also start by doing two sets instead of just one; you’re starting off in great 
shape and looking to enhance what you already have.
You’ll also want to do the advanced version of each core exercise, to chal-
lenge yourself and see results faster.

 Chapter 3: Getting Started: Your Core Guidelines
Getting Your Muscles to Chill Out
Often when you exercise, you focus on how much you can do, but you really 
should focus on how safely you exercise. Tensing up your muscles when 
exercising can lead to an injury and place undue strain on all the surrounding 
muscles and other body parts. So keeping your muscles tension-free helps to 
prevent injury, which at the same time helps you reach your ultimate fitness 
goals. To keep the tension out of your muscles while exercising, keep these 
important safety precautions in mind:
 
✓ Take a break as soon as you recognize that you’re losing your form. 
When you feel you’re losing your form while you’re doing a particular 
exercise, your body is giving you a signal that it’s time to stop. You have 
to listen to your body and read your body’s signals so that you know 
when your body is telling you that it has had enough. 
 
✓ Keep your muscles relaxed. Instead of tensing your muscles, like hunch-
ing up your shoulders when you’re exercising, use the strength of your 
muscles to propel or push you through each movement without tensing 
them up.
Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a common condition that can 
occur when the bone tissue in our bodies breaks 
down faster than our bodies can build it. As 
a result, the bones become thin and brittle. 
Osteoporosis strikes 80 percent of women and 
20 percent of men in a population of 10 million. 
And this condition is growing fast, with 34 mil-
lion Americans expected to be at risk of osteo-
porosis as a result of low bone mass.
Women have less bone mass than men, mainly 
because of hormones, and they experience 
an accelerated loss when they go through 
menopause.
To slow the process, you can do a few things:
 ✓ Perform weight-bearing exercises regularly.
 ✓ Make sure you’re getting the right amount 
of calcium and vitamin D in your diet.
 ✓ Don’t smoke!
 ✓ Don’t drink too much alcohol. The American 
Heart Association recommends one 8-ounce 
glass of red wine daily to keep your heart 
healthy.
Your doctor can prescribe medicine that you 
can take to increase bone mass, especially 
after menopause. To find out if you need to be 
taking any kind of medication for bone loss, get 
a bone density test from your doctor.

Part I: Core Basics 
Headache relief from strained and sore muscles
Statistics show that over 90 percent of people 
have a headache at some time in their life, 
which, amazingly, means that a lucky 10 per-
cent of people never have a headache (sounds 
weird to me). But a headache can happen at 
any time, anywhere, and can definitely ruin your 
day. And even though headaches are common, 
most people don’t have any idea where a head-
ache comes from.
Tension headaches are by far the most common 
form of headaches, and can be due to stress, 
which causes you to clench or strain the mus-
cles of your face, neck, jaw, and/or shoulders. 
When these muscles are tight they can com-
press the nerves that lead to your scalp, caus-
ing a tight, squeezing sensation in your head. 
Fatigue, lack of sleep, or even sleep disorders 
can also result in this type of headache.
Posture also plays a key role in many tension 
headaches. Many of the positions we habitually 
put ourselves in tighten neck and back muscles. 
Try to avoid constantly tilting your head to one 
side (a problem for frequent phone users). Be 
aware of your posture as you sit at your desk, 
drive your car, stand in line at the grocery store, 
or carry a bag or purse.
Migraines are generally less common head-
aches but more severe. Although stress can 
be a major trigger for migraine headache, 
migraines and cluster headaches are regarded 
as primarily vascular in nature, and not nec-
essarily the result of muscle tightness. What 
triggers a migraine headache in one person 
may have no effect in someone else, including 
hormone fluctuations, smoking, chocolate, and 
even the weather.
When it comes to relieving the pain of occa-
sional tension headaches, thousands of people 
turn to over-the-counter drugs such as aspirin, 
acetaminophen, or ibuprofen, which can be very 
effective. In addition, some proven-effective 
natural remedies include
 ✓ Ice packs
 ✓ A warm shower or bath
 ✓ Massaging the neck and shoulders
 ✓ Aerobic exercise (to promote the release of 
endorphins and relax tight muscles)
 ✓ Eating regularly
 ✓ Sex
 ✓ A glass of wine
Treatment for recurrent tension headaches, 
however, is another story. A frequently throb-
bing head is your body’s way of telling you that 
something significant is out of balance in your 
life. Stress is an unavoidable part of modern life, 
but by far the best course of action to combat 
stress-related tension headaches is prevention. 
Although such natural remedies as a visit to a 
chiropractor, acupressure, acupuncture, and 
even hypnosis can help with recurring tension 
headaches, several well-regarded studies have 
concluded that stress management skills and 
relaxation training can reduce chronic head-
ache for 50 to 70 percent of patients. Techniques 
such as deep breathing, meditation, and, 
most important of all, exercise and deep 
stretching can trigger the relaxation response, 
which can lower blood pressure, reduce pulse 
rates, and release muscle tension. Regular 
exercise and stretching keeps you calm and 
flexible; and it can help reduce headache fre-
quency and intensity.

45
 Chapter 3: Getting Started: Your Core Guidelines
 
✓ Remember to breathe. Focus on your breathing (read the section later 
on in this chapter, “Breathing Properly for Better Results”) using slow 
and steady breaths. The worst thing you can do is to hold your breath, 
which some people tend to do when they exercise. Using your breath 
will help keep you focused on your body and the movements you are 
doing with your body. 
 
✓ Warm up and cool down properly. As I mention throughout this book 
(see Chapter 4), warming up for 5 to 10 minutes before working out 
prepares your body for exercise by getting your blood circulating and 
increasing your core temperature slowly. The same goes for cooling 
down properly, which reduces your risk of injury and helps the blood 
return to your heart. 
Benefits of Stretching Your Core 
(or Anything, for That Matter)
Have you ever seen anyone in great shape who slouches when sitting? 
Obviously, this person toned and tightened his or her body but forgotten 
to lengthen it. Stretching adds great form and definition to a body that’s 
already well toned. And you really can’t get that look with short, round, 
compact muscles. So read on to find the many other benefits of stretching 
out the new six-pack (or, at least, flat tummy) you’ll get after reading 
this book.
Beats stress
Stretching beats stress. Yay! Now that’s a reason to cheer or stretch! Of 
course, some stress can be good and can help keep you motivated so 
you can take action and achieve great things. But too much stress can 
threaten your health and well-being. We all have to learn ways of coping 
with stress, and stretching can be therapeutic for many people. Stretching 
can help individual muscles release and relax, but the deep, regular 
breathing that is so important to effective stretching can also oxygenate 
your blood and reduce overall stress and anxiety. What’s more, the slow, 
meticulous movements in a good flexibility program can provide a medita-
tive effect. So increase your focus and your range of motion with a little 
stretching.

Not only can sound, erect posture make you look taller and thinner, but 
it is also essential to allow your body to perform the way it was meant to. 
What’s more, good posture aids dramatically in facilitating free and effective 
breathing. The main enemy of good posture is tight muscles! Stretching can 
help you correct muscular imbalances that lead to incorrect skeletal align-
ment. One cause of this kind of imbalance is using one side of your body 
more than the other — like when you carry your toddler on the same side, or 
always carry your briefcase in the same hand, or perhaps even wearing your 
shoulder bag on the same shoulder. Such chronic imbalances can rob you of 
energy and efficiency from movement or even result in back pain. Stretching 
regularly can help balance out these bad habits, so be sure to stand up 
straight and stretch!
Increases your range of motion
Just as stretching can help dramatically increase the range of motion in your 
joints, it can also help in your everyday life by making it possible for you to 
reach higher or lower, bend farther, and reduce nagging aches and pains 
from tight, tense muscles. A lack of flexibility can make small everyday move-
ments annoying and even painful. Stretching is the perfect means of improv-
ing your functional flexibility, and it helps the day go smoother.
Prevents injuries
Stretching has been proven to reduce muscle strain or joint strain, in the case 
of accidental overuse of muscles or joints from sports. In short, although 
nothing can prevent an injury 100 percent, numerous studies show that, 
with stretching exercises, you can increase flexibility and decrease your risk 
of injury. In the end, stretching can be a very low-cost, long-term insurance 
policy for your body — and well worth the few minutes a day it takes to do it!
Stretching Do’s and Don’ts
Trainers sometimes have quite different opinions on when to stretch (before 
or after a workout) and sometimes even on the benefits of stretching. So to 
avoid any misunderstanding on where I stand on stretching and just how 
important it is (did I mention I wrote Stretching For Dummies?), I put together 
a list of stretching do’s and don’ts to explain it all. The following guidelines 
help you get started so you can begin stretching out your core after you take 
a look at my simple rules!

47
 Chapter 3: Getting Started: Your Core Guidelines
Do stretch after your workout
The time to stretch is when your muscles are warm! A lot of trainers will tell 
you to stretch either first thing in the morning, or at the end of the day, or 
both. And although some research supports this recommendation, I always 
recommend stretching after the body is warmed up. “Always better to error 
on the side of caution” is another one of my favorite sayings. Be safe and 
increase your flexibility by ending every workout with a few nice stretches, 
like the ones you find in this chapter.
Do stretch a little bit every other day
If you’re looking to increase your present level of flexibility (and who isn’t?), I 
recommend that you engage in a focused flexibility program every other day. 
To increase flexibility in a muscle, the general rule is to stretch that muscle at 
least once a day, but most of us don’t have the luxury of that much time. I’m 
confident that you can maintain a great range of motion by stretching every 
other day. Of course, that means after your body is warmed up from garden-
ing, walking up a hill, taking a hike, or finishing up a great swim session.
Do hold each stretch
Many studies have demonstrated that the optimum effectiveness of a stretch-
ing exercise is reached only after holding that stretch for approximately 30 
seconds. If you stretch any less, you don’t really give your body time to adapt 
properly to the stretch. (Stretching more hasn’t been proven to provide any 
additional benefits, either.) So if you stick to the 30-second rule — or about 
five or six good, deep breaths — you’ll be right where you need to be and will 
feel a difference in your flexibility in no time.
Don’t stretch to the point of pain
“No pain, no gain” is definitely not the saying for anyone who’s stretching, 
and neither is “Go for the burn.” In fact, pain is the most precise indicator 
of a stretch that has gone too far, in either intensity or duration. If you’re 
stretching to the point at which your muscle is quivering or you actually find 
that you are becoming less flexible, back off. A stretch should feel no more 
than slightly uncomfortable. When you reach the point of resistance in your 
muscle, stay there and hold the stretch at that point. You’ll find that you can 
comfortably move past that point in a few days. However, if you force the 
issue, it’ll only set you back further than you were when you started.

Do start at the top of the body 
and work your way down
Progressing through a series of body parts that starts at the top of your head 
and ends at the tip of your toes helps the muscles warm up and increases 
flexibility in the best way possible.
The following sequence shows you which body part is best to start with 
and which one to end with. This guide is only a small one, but I think it will 
help you to stretch safely, starting with the smallest muscle groups and then 
working up to the largest muscle groups in your body:
 
✓ Neck
 
✓ Forearm and wrists
 
✓ Triceps
 
✓ Chest
 
✓ Back
 
✓ Sides (obliques)
 
✓ Buttocks (gluteals)
 
✓ Groin
 
✓ Thighs
 
✓ Calves
 
✓ Shins
 
✓ Hamstrings

S
o you want to get rid of that “muffin top,” and that’s why you’re reading 
this book, right? I remember when I first heard that expression — muffin 
top — you know, the fat that spills over the top of your buttoned jeans. Yikes! 
And wouldn’t life be great if only you could get rid of it? Well, you’ve come to 
the right place! This book will not only help you feel better, but will also help 
you become a sleeker version of your former self (or at least help you button 
your jeans).
 
Of course, you’ll want to know a few points before you get started, the most 
important being that you should get your doctor’s approval before starting 
any new workout program. And when you have the go-ahead, you can check 
out this chapter to find out how to warm up your core temperature first for 
a better, safer workout. Plus, you can discover many ways to add weights to 
your core workout, and even try out a core class.
Tuning In to Toning-Up Basics
Core training may be new to you, or you may be ready to up your core work-
out with some new, more intense moves. Regardless of where you’re starting, 
you need to be sure that you understand some of the basics of core training 

50
Part I: Core Basics 
before you begin. The following sections give you all the info you need to 
grasp the core basics, including everything from warming up and building a 
proper workout to practicing core safety.
Turning up the heat of your core
Like most people, you’re probably rushed and don’t feel you have the time to 
warm up, so you just dive right into working out, right? Or you’ve been given 
mixed advice on whether to warm up before a workout. Well, never fear, 
because I’m here to tell you that you must always warm up before exercising. 
The following list explains the benefits of a proper warm-up:
 
✓ Getting some internal heat going: To improve exercise performance 
and get your blood flowing (which pumps more oxygen to your muscles 
for a high-energy workout), you have to do five to ten minutes of light 
aerobic activity. Warming up your muscles properly with simple move-
ments like marching or jogging in place helps prevent the possibility 
of injury due to cold muscles because warmer muscles work more effi-
ciently than cold ones.
 
✓ Improving your concentration: Don’t rush the warm-up. Taking your 
time when you’re warming up helps your mind to focus and signals the 
body that it’s time to get going. Warming up slowly improves your con-
centration and increases brain wave activity, to help make the transition 
to a high-energy workout safer and easier. So no matter how rushed for 
time you are or how much you feel you can skip the warm-up, don’t. 
You’ll have a much better workout if you do.
Knowing your limits
Core training can be very intense, so start slowly. Pushing past your limit can 
cause injury or, at the very least, pain. In particular, two factors can lead to 
headaches and sore muscles:
 
✓ Jumping right into a new workout: Just because you run every day 
doesn’t mean that you can do 50 crunches and not feel a thing. The 
body needs time to learn new movements, and working different muscle 
groups challenges you in a whole new way. So avoid the tendency to do 
too much right from the start. Work up slowly, to avoid injury and get 
the best results.
 
✓ Not staying well hydrated: When you’re ready to work up a good sweat, 
you’ll need to have a bottle of water handy so you can drink frequently, 
to replace what you lose during the sweating process.

51
 Chapter 4: Things to Consider Before Taking the Core Challenge
In addition to taking your time and staying well hydrated, you need to under-
stand when you’re reaching your limit so you can back off. The following list 
gives you an idea of when your body is telling you to slow down:
 
✓ You feel dizzy or lose your balance
 
✓ You can’t carry on a conversation or sing Happy Birthday!
 
✓ You feel a sharp pain anywhere in your body
Setting aside enough time for working out
When it comes to working out, people often cite time as the primary reason 
they can’t fit in a workout. But if you work efficiently and follow the ideas 
for putting together a proper workout, you can find plenty of spots to fit it in 
during the day. For every workout, be sure to
 
✓ Include a warm-up before every workout that consists of five to ten 
minutes of movement, to increase your core temperature and to prepare 
your body for the exercises that are about to come.
 
✓ For your actual workout, strive for at least 30 minutes three times a 
week to start your new core program. Because you use your deeper 
abdominal muscles (which you probably haven’t used before) when you 
do core training, your body will feel the difference right away and be a 
bit sore from your ribs to your hips. Resting for 48 hours between work-
outs gives your body a chance to replenish and recharge. If you still feel 
some soreness after you rest for 48 hours in between your workouts, I 
recommend working a different part of your body or a different muscle 
group entirely, to prevent any additional damage to the area. Make sure 
you drink a lot of water, to aid in tissue repair, and try gentle stretching 
(Check out Stretching For Dummies [Wiley], by yours truly!) until you feel 
ready to start again.
 
✓ Cool down properly after working out, by stretching your muscles to 
relieve any tightness you may have and to reduce your risk of injury. A 
five-minute cooldown will help the blood flow back to your brain and 
reduce your risk of dizziness. It also gives the body a chance to slow 
down your rate of breathing and sends a signal to your body that you 
are done with exercising so you can begin breathing normally. 
As you become more proficient with your core exercises, you can increase 
your workouts to 60 minutes three to four days a week by adding some form 
of cardio for 30 to 40 minutes. Adding cardio, provides you with faster results 
by helping you burn more calories to get rid of that “muffin top” and boosting 
your metabolism.

52
Part I: Core Basics 
Keeping core safety in mind
For the safest and most effective workout, follow these simple and easy tips:
 
✓ Use a smooth and steady motion for each exercise. When you’re doing 
any form of resistance training for core strengthening, maintaining good 
posture and control is important. Whether you’re lifting weights or 
doing crunches, controlling the movement — and not letting the move-
ment control you — is the key. If you start to lose your form, you’re 
doing your body a disservice and you may injure yourself.
 
✓ Breathe freely while exercising. Never hold your breath while working 
out. Breathing freely helps you gain better control of your movements.
 
✓ Remember to stay within your own limits. Never try an exercise that 
may risk you hurting yourself or pulling a muscle.
 
✓ If you feel any kind of pain — especially in your joints — never con-
tinue the exercise. Remember that a sharp pain is different from the 
slight pain or fatigue that you feel in your muscles when you’re “going 
for the burn.” Some exercises in this book may just not feel right for 
your particular body, so move on to find the ones that do.
 
✓ Perform the exercises in this book only in the ways in which they’re 
demonstrated. Adding your own little twist to proven and effective exer-
cises can cause injury. Stick within the guidelines for each exercise, and 
you’ll be fit to the core in no time!
 
✓ Stay within your training range. When you begin working out after 
taking a long time off, going a little nutty and doing too much is easy to 
do. When you’re just beginning, staying within your own level of comfort 
and not lifting too heavy a load keeps you from getting an injury and hin-
dering your progress. If you’re consistent with your exercise program, 
you’ll see results in a few short weeks.
 
✓ If you feel dizzy or short of breath, stop the exercise. Because core 
training uses many lying positions that you will be sitting up from, you 
can easily become dizzy. If you experience dizziness or shortness of 
breath, stop immediately and breathe deeply while you rest.
 
✓ Exercise in an open space. Never exercise in a confined or limited 
space. Remember to remove anything with sharp edges from your work-
out area, to keep yourself from running into anything when you exercise.
 
✓ Always consult your doctor to make sure that you’re in good physi-
cal shape before you begin a new exercise program. In addition, if you 
have a history of back or neck problems or are pregnant, discuss these 
issues with your health-care provider to find out if he or she feels that 
core training is a good choice for you.

53
 Chapter 4: Things to Consider Before Taking the Core Challenge
In addition, remember to always warm up properly to get your body ready 
for exercising and to avoid injury. And when you’re finished working out, 
cool down (and stretch) to avoid soreness.
Using a mat
Creating a space to work out, whether it’s at home or at the gym, is important 
for your success. You should include an exercise mat in that space. Taking 
the pain out of exercising and supporting your body weight with an exercise 
mat is the best thing you can do for yourself — and your joints.
Doing push-ups on your knees, like I suggest in some chapters, is tough 
enough without using something to cushion them. So is lying on your back 
to do bicycles and the other abdominal exercises I prescribe in this book. So 
grab a yoga mat (ideal), a towel, or similar item, to soften the rough floor and 
ensure your success as you’re doing the exercises in this book.
Using a mirror
Coming from a dance background, I’m used to watching myself in a mirror, 
to see whether I’m lifting my chest properly, keeping my knees in line, and 
standing up straight. A mirror is a great tool for making sure that you have 
the desired neutral alignment of your spine and checking your form through-
out many of the exercises contained in this book.
So what kind of mirror works best? For starters, any mirror that’s bolted to 
the wall! You certainly don’t want to use a free-standing mirror (like a ward-
robe mirror), in case you lose your balance and knock it over. If you have the 
space in your garage or office, a wall mirror works great for checking your 
body alignment — and for staying put.
Warming Up Your Core
Both men and women can benefit greatly from warming up first before doing 
core training, but what are some of the best ways to warm up? You can do 
one of the following recommended types of warm-ups so you’re ready to go.
 
You’re warming up, not working out yet. Start out with a nice gradual pace 
that you can add on slowly to when you begin your actual workout.

54
Part I: Core Basics 
Jogging in place
Ten minutes of jogging in place at a slow pace works great for preparing your 
body for exercise. Jogging is easy to do, and you don’t need much space! Just 
make sure you don’t break into a full-out run; maintain a slower, warm-up 
pace that helps you break a light sweat by the end of ten minutes.
Marching it out
Marching in place is another easy way to warm up your body. Make sure you 
lift your knees high enough to get your heart rate up, and pump your arms 
to incorporate your upper body. Figure 4-1 gives you an idea of what proper 
marching looks like.
To march, follow these steps:
 
1. Standing with your feet together, lift your knees high above your hips.
 
2. Swing your arms up and back, making sure your hands are above 
your heart.
 
3. Step down, using a flat foot each time, until you work up a light sweat.

55
 Chapter 4: Things to Consider Before Taking the Core Challenge
 
Marching in place for five minutes and then walking it out for five minutes 
back and forth across the room is also a good combination for getting ready to 
work out.
Jumping rope
My favorite method for warming up the body is jumping rope (see Figure 4-2). 
You can also pretend you’re using a jump rope, which is just as effective for 
getting in a quick warm-up.
When you jump rope, follow these steps:
 
1. Keeping your elbows at your waist, rotate your wrists as you hold the 
rope in your hands.
 
2. Lift your feet off the ground slightly, or only high enough to allow the 
rope to slide underneath. 
 
3. Bend your knees and jump upward, making sure you land on the balls 
of your feet.

56
Part I: Core Basics 
 
Always land on the balls of your feet, not your toes, when you’re jumping rope. 
Holding Your Posture
Having correct posture when performing core exercises is essential. First, 
correct posture places less stress on your joints; second, it stabilizes your 
spine, to prevent injury. When you strengthen your core, you’ll find that you 
can stand taller and will have a leaner look overall. This is because certain 
back muscles are included in the core musculature which can give you a 
more erect spine and beautiful posture when you strengthen them. The sec-
tions that follow introduce you to your neutral spine and explain just how 
you can find it when you want it.
Achieving a neutral spine
One of the principle factors in core training is using proper back placement, 
or neutral spine. The ultimate goal in trying to achieve a neutral spine is to 
keep the natural curve of your spine without overcorrecting it, known as the 
“S” curve.
The “S” shape has three curves, just like neutral spine — one in your neck, 
one in your upper back, and one in your lower back. In other words, you 
want to stabilize your back, your hipbones, and your pelvis so they’re on the 
same plane.
If you were standing, your pelvis would drop straight down. The proper way 
to describe a neutral spine while standing up is a spine that is neither arched 
nor tilted forward. Just as your car has a neutral position in which it doesn’t 
move forward or backward, the same goes for a neutral spine.
 
Try standing sideways in front of a mirror to check your posture. Pull your 
shoulders back and keep your head in line with your spine.
Finding your “hard to find” neutral spine
To try neutral spine and see whether you’re maintaining that natural curve in 
your spine, do the following:
 
1. Lie with your back and feet flat on the floor and your knees bent at a 
90-degree angle.

57
 Chapter 4: Things to Consider Before Taking the Core Challenge
 
2. Flatten your lower back by pressing it into the floor.
 
 Now you can feel the difference between neutral spine and a flat back.
 
3. Arch your back slightly by lifting your hips.
 
 Now that you can feel the differences between an arched back and a flat 
back, you’ll find it easier to maintain the natural curve in your spine (or 
neutral spine).
Knowing how a neutral spine feels
Your core, or midsection (consisting of the abdominal and back muscles), is 
used in every movement you do throughout the day. You’ve probably heard 
that a weak back means you have weak abdominals, and that’s the best 
example I can give you to illustrate how much everything in your body is con-
nected and emphasize how important it is to strengthen your core. So what 
will you feel when you start crunching and bending sideways to improve this 
area? Check the following sections to see if you’re on track and if you’re tar-
geting the right muscles that make up your core.
What to feel
If you’re lying down on the couch and come to a sitting position, you’re 
using your rectus abdominus. So, for example, when you’re doing a crunch, 
the rectus abdominus helps you move your upper body toward your lower 
body — and it’s better known as the muscle group you need to work out to 
get a great six-pack! If you find it hard to get up from a lying-down position 
on the couch, you need to work your core.
You’ll get the feeling of wearing a tight girdle when you work the transverse 
abdominus, or lower abdomen, that supports your spine and internal organs. 
Together, the upper and lower abdominal areas, or rectus abdominus and 
transverse abdominus, work to give you a more toned tummy and defined 
waist so when you lose that layer of fat that covers your midsection, you’ll 
see your new six pack peeking through.
Where to feel it
Your spine, your back, your tummy, your pelvis, your rib cage — you’ll start 
feeling improvements in all these areas when you start core training. Your 
lower back will feel more steady or stabilized, as if it’s working as one unit 
with the rest of your body. Your neck, or top of the spine, will feel stronger 
so you can hold your posture erect for longer periods of time. And the spinal 
vertebrae that run along the entire length of your back will make all your 
bending movements easier. So prepare to feel more flexible in your entire 
body and have a more sculpted look throughout the waist area if you’re 
doing core training properly.

58
Part I: Core Basics 
How Weights Can Build a Stronger Core
I like to add different kinds of resistance or weights to my core workout, 
and I think you will, too (see Chapter 10). The trend nowadays is to use free 
weights or dumbbells and combine exercises, like a squat with an overhead 
press. When you combine the two movements, you are forced to transition 
the exercise movement through your core. The core muscles, in turn, help 
to maintain good posture throughout the exercise. So you can see how one 
hand helps wash the other — or whatever that saying is!
The following sections provide a few examples of how you can use different 
forms of weighted resistance to get fit to the core.
 
When you use hand weights and other accessories, like medicine balls, you 
need shoes to protect your toes in case you drop a weight on them.
Dumbbells
For men and women who are interested in building muscle mass, heavier 
dumbbells that allow you to complete only 6 to 12 repetitions comfortably 
are perfect. However, for core training purposes, and to be able to maintain 
proper form without straining, use only the amount of weight that feels com-
fortable to you when performing 10 to 15 repetitions. I suggest 5 to 10 pounds 
for women and 15 to 25 pounds for men.
Heavy balls (medicine balls)
Heavy balls (medicine balls) are a good accessory to use to increase your 
resistance and to add some amount of weight to your workout. Heavy balls 
range in size from a tennis ball to a softball and start out weighing just less 
than a pound. They continue to increase in size in one-inch increments and 
are available in different colors to identify their weight and size.
Heavy balls are easier to grip than hand weights because of their round 
shape, and they provide added resistance to strengthen your core because 
you can incorporate them more easily into core movements. I like using a 
five-pound weighted ball or heavy ball that is just a bit smaller than a basket-
ball (see Chapter 9).

59
 Chapter 4: Things to Consider Before Taking the Core Challenge
No weights
If you’re brand new to working out, I recommend not using weights because, 
although you may have strong muscles on the outside of your body, you 
probably need to strengthen your inside muscles (or core-stabilizing mus-
cles) first, to develop control over all your movements.
Trying a Core Class
If you’re like me, you’ll do anything to find a good class. Whether it’s kick-
boxing, spinning, or yoga, I find being in a group class to be very motivating. 
Okay, so maybe I just get bored when I’m on the elliptical trainer or the tread-
mill and am forced to watch Montel Williams. Or maybe I just don’t have the 
discipline to go at it alone. But whatever the case may be, group classes are 
all the rage right now — I suggest trying one as soon as you can!
Check out a few answers to some of the most frequently asked questions 
about what you should know when you do find a group class for core training:
 
✓ Where can I take a class? Your local YMCA or YWCA is a good place to 
start looking for a group class. Local gyms and recreational centers also 
offer classes on a regular basis, depending on the area you live in. You can 
call your local chamber of commerce to get a list of the fitness facilities in 
your area that offer classes or search the Internet for a particular location.
Dressing for success: How clothing makes 
a difference when working out
Although dressing for every kind of sport has 
become fashionable (tennis wear is suddenly 
hip), keep some safety considerations in mind 
before exercising. Because you’ll sweat during 
your workout, breathable cotton is best for 
keeping you cool and helping you not get too 
sticky. Bulky clothes and untucked shirts can 
also bunch up while you’re working out, so 
stick with something form fitting, like what 
you’d wear to a yoga or Pilates class. This type 
of clothing allows you to visualize the muscles 
you’re working and focus on your movements 
better when you can actually see them. You’ll 
also be able to check your posture and study 
your form better.

60
Part I: Core Basics 
 
✓ How much does a class cost? Core classes range in price from $10 
to $12 a class, depending on the facility that’s offering them. If you’re 
a member of a gym that offers core classes, the cost is most likely 
included in your monthly payment.
 
✓ How long does the class take? Core-training classes frequently last 30 
to 45 minutes these days. Classes begin with a warm-up and end with 
a cooldown, so your actual workout time is around 25 minutes. Many 
classes combine other pieces of equipment, like medicine balls and light 
weights, to help increase core strength.
 
 Some classes incorporate other forms of training; these classes are called 
circuit classes. Circuit classes add accessories (like body bars), dumb-
bells, and cardio equipment (like jump ropes) to strengthen your body 
and increase endurance. Circuit classes are also known as boot camp 
classes because that’s just what they are — tough, like a boot camp!
 
✓ What kind of teacher should I look for? Look for a teacher who can 
teach at all different levels, ranging from beginners to experienced ath-
letes. The teacher should be particularly conscientious of the level of 
his or her class, to make sure that everyone in the class is using proper 
form at all times.
 
 Health club providers usually require their instructors to have certifica-
tions, including ones from the International Sports Sciences Association, 
America Council on Exercise, and Aerobics and Fitness Association of 
America, among others. Resist-A-Ball certifies instructors for core train-
ing that consists of different levels and other applications of the exercise 
ball that they can use with Pilates, yoga, and pregnancy workouts.
 
✓ How many times per week should I take a class? To get the best 
results, taking a class two or three times per week is best. Combine your 
core classes with some form of cardio workout, which you can do on 
your days off from your group class. Walking, jumping rope, spinning, 
and using the treadmill or an elliptical trainer are all perfect comple-
ments to core training.
Finally, consider some friendly group-class reminders to make the transition 
into an exercise class go a little smoother:
 
✓ Because some classes require participants to sign up ahead of time, 
always arrive early to make sure that you have a spot.
 
✓ Always arrive a few minutes early to class, to give yourself time to get 
settled in and chose whatever equipment may be needed for the class.
 
✓ Never enter a class after the warm-up has begun because your body 
won’t be well prepared for that particular workout.

▶ Discovering the best core principles for a healthier you
Your core is made up of the muscles of your back, abs, hips, and — well, I 
like to think of it as anything from the top of your ribcage to the bottom 
of your hips. Because these core muscles all work together to support your 
spine, they’re the foundation of every movement you do throughout your 
day, as well as your movements in sports and other activities. So whether 
you’re shooting hoops, gardening, or reaching for something on the top shelf, 
every movement actually begins with your core.
Because of your body’s connection to its core, core training has become 
very popular and is the foundation of any good fitness program. The follow-
ing beginner core series includes some basic core exercises, like crunches. 
Plus, I’ve added a few back strengtheners to make sure everything is working 
together, giving you the strongest foundation possible.
Using Everyday Ways to Work Your Core
Challenging your balance works your core — you’ll hear these words over 
and over again when anyone talks about core training. But what does this 
statement mean to you in real life? Well, challenging your balance simply 
means you are changing your weight distribution or throwing off your weight 
in one area so you have to compensate in another area, to become stronger 
and more stable. Check out a few of the following examples of ways you can 
squeeze in a little extra core training by challenging your balance and making 
small adjustments throughout your day while you’re at home:

✓ Blow-dry your hair standing on one leg!
 
✓ Lift one leg in the air and straighten your knee as you’re watching 
television.
 
✓ Pretend you’re tightening your belt throughout the day so you remem-
ber to suck it in.
 
✓ Replace your office chair with the exercise ball for at least one hour a day.
 
✓ Sit with crossed legs on the floor in front of the TV, or wherever else you 
spend a lot of time sitting, to strengthen your lower-back muscles and 
build a better core.
 
✓ Sit up tall when you’re at the dinner table or anytime for that matter!
These are just a few examples of fun things you can do to start working on 
your core strength every day. And hopefully you’ll continue to do them at 
home even after you’ve mastered the following workout. 
Easing into It: Lowering to the 
Ground for Core Strengtheners
Revving up your circulation by increasing your blood flow to the pelvis, hips, 
and other parts of your body is always a good idea before launching into a 
series of intense crunches. The following series includes a couple of smooth 
moves to help you start out slowly.
Lying pelvic tilts
Pelvic tilts done lying down loosen up your hip and core area and get your 
circulation flowing so everything moves more freely. Take your time with this 
movement, and don’t forget to breathe!
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet hip width apart. Keep 
your feet flat on the floor and make sure your spine is in the neutral 
position (see Figure 5-1a).
 
2. Keeping your back on the floor, slowly exhale as you roll your hips 
forward or up toward the ceiling, until your lower back is pressed flat 
on the floor.

65
 Chapter 5: Getting Started with Beginning Core Exercises
 
3. Inhale as you return to the starting position, then roll your hips back-
ward until your lower back arches slightly (see Figure 5-1b).
 
4. Repeat ten times.

Remember the following tips for this exercise:
 
✓ Do focus on just moving your lower back and not your thighs.
 
✓ Don’t tilt or hold the movement too long. Go only to the point of feeling 
good without straining.
 
✓ Don’t hold your breath — keep your breathing steady and strong.
Hip lifts with knees together
The first exercise warmed you up so now this exercise focuses on loosening 
you up. For this exercise, use a smaller range of motion or don’t lift your hips 
too high off the ground, to avoid stress on your lower back.

66
Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie flat on your back, keeping your knees bent and tight together. Place 
your feet flat on the floor and your arms at your sides. Keeping the spine 
neutral, pull your belly button in toward your spine (see Figure 5-2a).
 
2. Slowly lift your hips toward the ceiling, allowing your butt and lower 
back to lift toward the ceiling and off the floor (see Figure 5-2b). Hold 
for three to five seconds.
 
3. Slowly lower your hips back down, allowing your back to return to 
neutral position and keeping your knees pressed tight.
 
4. Repeat ten times.

Suiting Up Your Core
Ah, the sit-up . . . now known as the crunch because, face it, people just don’t 
like doing sit-ups. The exercise community had to come up with a new word 
to market these moves. However, you do crunches slightly different than 
sit-ups: Instead of starting the movement with your arms and trying to sit up 
with the strength of your upper body, suck in your gut and try the following 
series of fun crunches using only your abdominals.
Crunches
The simplest way to regain strength in your core and endurance is to do 
crunches. However, be sure to progress slowly. When you first try this exer-
cise, place your fingertips behind your ears and you elbows bent and out to 
the sides. Then you can try crossing your arms in front of your chest, which 
adds extra weight and a degree of difficulty to this exercise.
 
Variation: If the following crunch proves to be too difficult, try placing your 
hands palm down on the floor right next to your hips. Slide your fingertips 
about three inches toward your feet by using your abdominals to lift your 
shoulders off the ground. Hold briefly, and then return to starting position. 
 
1. Lie on your back, with your knees bent and fingertips behind your 
neck for support.
 
 Your feet should be flat on the ground (see Figure 5-3a).
 
 Be sure to keep a space between your chin and chest as you’re looking 
up toward the ceiling.
 
2. Raise your chest until your shoulder blades lift off the floor (as shown 
in Figure 5-3b).
 
3. Slowly lower back to the floor.
 
4. Repeat five to ten times, gradually progressing to more repetitions 
when you feel comfortable.
Follow these tips while performing this exercise:
 
✓ Don’t use your hands and arms to help lift you up — use your abdominals.
 
✓ Keep your abdominals pulled in toward your spine throughout the 
entire movement.
 
✓ Don’t raise your head and shoulders more than just off the ground.

Side crunch
The side lying crunch is a great addition to your beginner abdominal pro-
gram because it also helps target the side muscles or obliques. It can feel a 
bit awkward to do at first but try it a few times and once you get the hang of 
it you’ll see a smaller waist along with a stronger core! 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lying on the floor or on a mat, bend your knees and clasp your hands 
behind your neck (see Figure 5-4a). 
 
2. Lifting your upper torso, raise yourself slightly off the floor using your 
waist muscles or obliques (as shown in Figure 5-4b). Bring your elbow 
toward your feet to target the waist. 
 
3. Return back down to the floor and repeat on other side after ten 
repetitions.

Follow these tips for this exercise:
 
✓ Engage your core throughout this entire exercise.
 
✓ Keep your knees on the ground and use your upper body to do the 
move.
 
✓ Avoid pulling on your head with your hands or it will strain your neck.
 
✓ Remember to breathe.
Side planks
The side plank strengthens the side muscles (the obliques) or waist of the 
body. This beginning version has you using bent knees instead of having your 
legs straight out to support your body weight — you can always work up to 
that as you gain strength in your core.

70
Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
To perform a side plank, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your left side, propping up your body on your left elbow. Place 
your elbow directly beneath your shoulder. Bend both of your knees at a 
90-degree angle, stacking your thighs on tops of one another (see Figure 
5-5a). Place your right hand on the floor in front of your body, for sup-
port. Ensure that your body from your head down to your toes is in a 
straight line, with a neutral spine.
 
2. Lift your hips so that your torso comes off the ground and your body 
is in a straight line from your head down to your knees. If you can, 
take your right hand off the floor and place it alongside your body. Try 
to hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds (see Figure 5-5b).
 
3. Repeat for three repetitions and increase reps as the exercise becomes 
easier.

Follow these tips for this exercise:
 
✓ Pull your abdominal muscles in for support.
 
✓ Don’t allow your hips to drop down toward the ground.
 
✓ Don’t hold your breath — keep your breathing steady and strong.

 Chapter 5: Getting Started with Beginning Core Exercises
Bicycles
Hands down, this exercise is the best core exercise for targeting the waist, 
obliques (the muscles that run down the side of the waist), and abs. The 
twisting and pulling motion you do with your knees and upper body is per-
fect for getting your core in shape fast!
 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and thighs perpendicular to 
the floor. Place your fingers just behind your ears (see Figure 5-6a).
 
2. Lift your shoulders off the floor as you straighten the right leg, and 
bring the left knee in toward your right armpit. Without relaxing the 
torso or returning your shoulders to the floor, repeat on the other side 
by straightening the left leg and pulling the right knee in toward the 
left armpit (as shown in Figure 5-6b).
 
3. Alternate the legs in a slow bicycling movement.
 
4. Repeat 15 times on each side.

Remember these tips while bicycling:
 
✓ Pull your abdominal muscles in for support.
 
✓ Don’t allow your hips to drop down toward the ground.
 
✓ Don’t hold your breath — keep your breathing steady and strong.
Push-ups on knees
You may be wondering what push-ups have to do with your core. After 
all, haven’t you always been told to do push-ups to tone your upper body? 
Although push-ups have traditionally been the go-to exercise for upper-body 
toning, push-ups on your knees are a good way to regain strength in your 
belly and core area. When you do a push-up, you recruit your core muscles 
to help keep your back straight and assist you in pulling your belly button 
in toward your spine. You can progress to push-ups on your toes as you 
get stronger; however, always keep in mind that your back should remain 
straight and should not buckle from the weight of your body, even when sup-
ported by your knees.
 
Keeping your knees on the ground with a towel beneath them will ease the 
harshness of the floor and provide better support for your body.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Kneel and place your hands on the floor in front of you, shoulder 
width apart (as shown in Figure 5-7a).
 
 Make sure that your hands are directly below your shoulders on the floor.
 
2. Lower your upper body toward the floor, bending your elbows out to 
the side (see Figure 5-7b).
 
3. Straighten your elbows and exhale as you press back up into the 
starting position.
 
4. Complete ten repetitions and increase the amount of repetitions once 
the exercise becomes easier.
Consider some helpful hints for this exercise:
 
✓ Keep your abdominal muscles tight, to help you maintain your weight.
 
✓ Use proper breathing, inhaling as you lower and exhaling as you press 
back up.
 
✓ Don’t arch your back. Keep it straight and in line with your head and the 
rest of your body.

Baby Got Back!
A healthy spine is the backbone of all your core workouts (no pun intended). 
Gaining strength in your back muscles helps you maintain your posture and 
keeps you fluid with all the movements you do throughout the day. The follow-
ing exercises help you gain strength in your back and tighten up your entire 
core so you’ll notice a difference in the way you look and feel in no time.
Back extensions
The back extension exercise seems simple, yet it is a powerful and effective 
back strengthener. It also targets the lower back, so if you have lower back 
problems, you may want to skip this exercise.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Using a mat or towel, lie on your stomach and place your arms at your 
sides, with the palms facing up (see Figure 5-8a).
 
2. Pulling in or contracting your abdominal muscles, lift your chest a few 
inches off the floor, keeping your gaze straight ahead at all times (see 
Figure 5-8b).

74

3. Hold for a few seconds before lowering your chest back toward the 
ground.
 
4. Repeat this exercise three to five times and increase reps as exercise 
becomes easier.

Make sure you
 
✓ Tighten your butt or glutes to protect your lower back as you lift your 
chest off the floor.
 
✓ Tighten your abdominals throughout this move.
 
✓ Avoid lifting too high off the floor. Lift only to the point that you are not 
straining your back.
Plank 
The plank is another top core exercise that targets the abdominals and back 
muscles. Stay strong and lifted during this exercise, and maintain a long, 
straight back.

75
 Chapter 5: Getting Started with Beginning Core Exercises
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie face down, resting your forearms flat on the floor, and keep your 
elbows directly below your shoulders.
 
 Your feet should be touching or no more than an inch apart (see 
Figure 5-9a).
 
2. Lift your body off the floor using your forearms and toes, keeping 
your body as straight as possible. Maintain this position for as long as 
possible, and challenge yourself as you build up to longer periods in the 
plank position (see Figure 5-9b).
 
3. Hold the position for 10 to 15 seconds in the beginning or as long as 
you can before working your way up to holding the plank position for 
longer periods of time.

You don’t want to forget these tips:
 
✓ Keep your back long and straight.
 
✓ Don’t let your hips or knees drop toward the floor.
 
✓ Breathe steady and engage your abs.

Having an all-or-nothing approach to exercise: 
Why 20 or 30 minutes is better than trying 
to do 60 or 90 minutes!
My philosophy is to always start off slowly and 
work your way up to something — not only is it 
more practical but you won’t get discouraged 
when you can’t fit in 60 to 90 minute workouts 
and as a result decide to do nothing at all! Yes, 
the latest trend in exercise (which people of all 
demographics seem to be able to stick with) 
is more efficient workouts. And this lines up 
perfectly with what I have found to be true — 
“everything in moderation” . . . and I do mean 
everything! Keeping this in mind, the best way 
to accomplish your fitness goals is with shorter, 
more efficient workouts that provide weekly 
cardio and strengthening sessions. As an 
example, walking five days a week for 30 min-
utes at a time is a fantastic goal for everyone 
of all ages. And adding three weekly strength-
training sessions of 20 minutes per session is 
the perfect compliment to add to your walking. 
Sticking to shorter walks, weekend hikes, better 
eating, and plenty of rest all adds up — and you 
usually make it home without twisting your 
ankle! Nice!

elly fat is associated with greater health risks and lower-back pain (see 
Chapter 2 for more on these risks). And in this country, belly fat is far 
too common. America’s love for fast food (or anything fast, for that matter) 
has caused this country to have the highest percentage of obese people in 
the world — and that number is still growing!
 
Although lower-back pain is another side effect of belly fat or weak abdominal 
muscles, this problem can be also be a sign of a serious medical condition. If 
you’ve been experiencing pain in your back for more than three consecutive 
days, see a doctor before beginning any of the exercises in this chapter.
Throughout this chapter, I give you some fantastic abdominal crunches that 
you can do while lying on your back or on your side. Follow the series of 
crunches included in this chapter and you can
 
✓ See that six-pack start peeking through or at least see some tone in your 
tummy and tightening in your waist.
 
✓ Build strength in the center of your body, where you need it most to 
help support all your movements.
 
✓ Build stability and create balance with all the movements you need to 
do throughout the day.

Shaping Up with a Superset
I mention supersets in the title of this chapter because when you’re working 
your core, you’re working opposing muscle groups and that’s what you use 
in supersets — opposing muscle groups. So, what is a superset? Supersets 
are two exercises that are performed back to back or one right after the 
other that target opposing muscle groups. A good example of these opposing 
muscle groups would be the chest and back muscles that are used in many of 
the core exercises demonstrated in this chapter. Combining two of any of the 
exercises given in this chapter would create a superset. So take a look at why 
you “need” or should I say “want” to create a superset and go from there!
Supersets: How they are different 
from a regular workout
When you’re performing a superset, the basic difference is that you don’t rest 
between exercises like you would with a regular workout. In a regular work-
out, you rest around 90 seconds between exercises, but with a superset you 
immediately move from one exercise right into the next. As you move from 
one exercise to the next, you target two different muscle groups instead of 
just one that you would in your regular workout because you are performing 
multiple exercises within the same set — a superset! 
Benefits of doing a superset
The main benefit of doing supersets is to promote small changes in your 
body that you may have stopped seeing. Forcing yourself day after day to do 
the same workout is not only boring but your body needs new challenges to 
promote these physiological changes. Supersets are all about learning how to 
push yourself into a different training zone and help excite you about work-
ing out again while increasing muscle size and conditioning.
Another benefit of doing supersets is that it cuts down your time in the gym 
because you’re working two muscle groups within the same set. Your work-
outs become more efficient and more effective by performing back-to-back 
sets with more intensity and at a faster pace than your regular workout.
And finally, supersets are great for performing at home because you don’t 
need heavy weights. You can push your muscles with lighter weights, which 
means you can get an even better workout than with heavier equipment at a 
gym using minimal equipment.

 Chapter 6: Getting That Six Pack: Abdominal Core Superset
Shooting for a Six-Pack
Have you ever wondered if it’s possible for you to get a six-pack? Well, you’re 
not alone. Many people desire a great set of abs better known as a six-pack, 
and why wouldn’t they? It not only shows hard work, but it’s sexy to be able 
to show them off for both men and women. 
However, for most of us it just doesn’t come that easy and getting a six-pack 
means working your butt off! Genetics play a big part in how we look, and 
there are a lucky few who are just naturally blessed, shall we say, with a 
high metabolism resulting in low body fat and beautifully defined abdominal 
muscles. For the rest of the world though, it takes work and a few other ingre-
dients you can find below.
What to do to get a six-pack 
Here it is . . . “the secret” to getting a six-pack and guess what? It’s going to 
take some work! Surprised? Don’t be . . . anything worthwhile in life takes 
hard work and dedication. There are no quick fixes so read below to find the 
three things you can do to get washboard abs, a flat tummy, toned midsec-
tion, well, you get the point!
Low body fat
To see the muscles that make up the abdominals, you’ve got to reduce your 
belly fat. Believe it or not, you can have strong abdominals but not be able to 
see them because they’re covered by fat. And to really see them, you have to 
reduce your body fat to some pretty impressive levels. 
For men, your body fat level has to be at around 7 to 8 percent to see your 
six-pack peeking through and for women, it’s 13 to 14 percent. So how do 
you get to those levels? Well the fastest way is to eat yourself thin with a 
very clean diet that is both low in fat and low in refined, processed foods. 
Add three days a week of strength training and up your cardio to four or five 
times a week and you’re there! And plenty of water helps too with flushing all 
the toxins from your body and filling you up! 
The strength training sessions should be shorter than an hour and higher in 
intensity (see supersets in this chapter) to keep you in the fat-burning zone. 
The reps you do with your exercises should be limited to 8 to 12 repetitions 
for maximum effect. 
The best cardio to chose would be moves that are high in intensity but short 
in duration like running sprints. If you chose longer, more moderate intensity 
cardio, jogging would be good for fat burning. 

80
Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
Strong abdominals
Getting strong abdominals takes work but it’s work you’re probably already 
doing and you just don’t realize it! Working with weights makes you use your sta-
bilizer muscles, which are mostly located in your core (lower back and abs). And 
many of the weight training moves require you to transition the move through 
your core or midsection. See, you have the skills, you just have to up the inten-
sity and you’re on your way to that washboard stomach you’ve always wanted. 
Detailing 
Once you get your body fat down and your midsection tight and toned, you 
have to detail your abs, such as with spray-tanning (see the sidebar later 
in this chapter) to make them more visible. If you have a lot of hair on your 
body (men), you may need to wax, although tanning would be a less painful 
choice. Or you could just “manscape” which means trimming down some 
of your body hair to show off your new ab muscles. However you chose to 
cosmetically enhance your new six-pack, do it safely with products that are 
recommended by the dermatological association.
What not to do to get a six-pack
Any of the following techniques for getting a flatter tummy or defined six-
pack are not the way to go — remember, hard work pays off and there are no 
short cuts:
 
✓ Dieting to the extreme — low-calorie diets that last more than a day or 
two or “fad” diets that require you to only eat one thing for more than 
a day are a big no-no. These diets will set you back in your quest for 
better abs because they cause your body to eat precious muscle that 
burns fat when you’re body thinks you’re starving. Yikes!
 
✓ Any electric belt or devise that has to be worn around your waist may 
be able to hold you together like a belt but not give you a six-pack. It 
may make your waist look smaller but that’s about it!
 
✓ Tons of sit-ups! Doing 300 crunches per day will not help you get a six-
pack any faster, although it may give you a stomachache! You have to 
simultaneously reduce your body fat and strengthen your abs to get the 
results you’re looking for.
Crunch It! Abdominal Workout
Here it is! The series of crunches that will get you back on the path to a stron-
ger core and a toner midsection. I suggest doing this series of crunches and 
abdominal exercises two to three times a week, combined with some form of 
cardiovascular exercise for 30 minutes five days a week.

81
 Chapter 6: Getting That Six Pack: Abdominal Core Superset
Whether it’s running in place, skipping rope, or walking at a fast pace and 
ending in a slow pace, be sure to heat up your core before you try the follow-
ing exercises. A good warm-up will help prime your body and help you ease 
into exercise for a better workout.
Crunches — feet on floor
The simplest way to regain strength in your core and endurance is to do 
crunches. Crossing your arms in front of your chest increases the level of dif-
ficulty because it adds the weight of your upper body to the crunch.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back, with your knees bent, and cross your arms over 
your chest. Your feet should be flat on the ground (see Figure 6-1a).
 
 Be sure to keep a space between your chin and chest as your eyes are 
gazing upward toward the ceiling.
 
2. Raise your chest until your shoulder blades lift off the floor (as shown 
in Figure 6-1b).

3. Slowly lower back to the floor.

82
Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
 
4. Repeat five to ten times, gradually progressing to more repetitions 
when you feel comfortable.
Consider these tips to get the most from this exercise:
 
✓ Use your abs, not your arms, to help lift you up.
 
✓ Keep your abdominals pulled in toward your spine throughout the 
entire movement.
 
✓ Keep your ribcage and lower back on the floor at all times during this 
exercise.
Double-crunch  — knees to elbows
Just like its name, the double crunch works both the upper and lower sec-
tion of the abdominals. It is an exercise that is more difficult than the basic 
crunch because it brings the upper body to the lower body together in a 
movement similar to an accordion. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Keeping your knees bent and your feet off the floor, engage your 
abdominal muscles by pulling your belly button in toward your 
spine (see Figure 6-2a). Place your fingertips behind your head for 
support.
 
2. Pull your knees toward your chest, focusing on your abdominals as 
you bring your elbows toward your knees (see Figure 6-2b).
 
3. Slowly lower your legs and arms back to the starting position, to com-
plete one rep.
 
4. Aim for three sets of ten repetitions.
 
 Increase repetitions when you feel comfortable. 
Maximize your potential for this exercise by remembering to
 
✓ Hold the movement at the top before slowly letting your knees back 
down toward the floor.
 
✓ Use your core muscles to control the movement.
 
✓ Let your head rest in your hands for support during the crunch — don’t 
pull on your head with your hands.

Bicycle crunches
The bicycle crunch is the best exercise to work your rectus abdominus (the 
ab muscle that runs right down the middle of your torso). The twisting and 
pulling motion you do with your knees and upper body is perfect for working 
the waist muscles or obliques which strengthens the sides of the body which 
of course, is part of the core. 
 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and thighs perpendicular to 
the floor. Place your fingers just behind your ears (see Figure 6-3a).
 
2. Lift your shoulders off the floor as you straighten the right leg and 
bring the left knee in toward your right armpit. Without relaxing the 
torso or returning your shoulders to the floor, repeat on the other side 
by straightening the left leg and pulling the right knee in toward the 
left armpit (as shown in Figure 6-3b).
 
3. Alternate the legs in a slow bicycling movement 15 times on each side.
 
 Increase repetitions as you feel more comfortable with the movement. 

84
Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
Remember the following tips as you pedal away:
 
✓ Pull in your abdominal muscles, for support.
 
✓ Allow your hips to drop down toward the ground so you don’t arch 
your back.
 
✓ Keep your breathing steady and strong — don’t hold your breath.

Reverse crunches
By bringing your lower body to your upper body in a reverse crunch, you 
target your lower abs and will see a tightening in this area faster than with 
other ab exercises. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Keeping your knees bent and your feet off the floor, engage your 
abdominal muscles by pulling your belly button in toward your spine 
(see Figure 6-4a).
 
2. Pull your knees toward your chest, focusing on your abdominals as 
you keep your arms flat on the floor, palms facing down beside you 
(see Figure 6-4b).

✓ Hold the movement at the top before you slowly let your knees back 
down toward the floor.
 
✓ Keep the pace slow and steady so that you’re using your core muscles 
to control the movement. In other words, don’t go too fast!
Legs straight up crunches
You do these crunches the same way that you do a regular abdominal crunch, 
except that you use the added weight of your legs to increase the level of 
intensity for this exercise. The little bit of extra adds up to really big results! 
However, this is an advanced crunch and should not be done by beginners.

Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lying on your back on a mat or the floor, extend your legs straight up 
in the air above you. Place your hands behind your head, with your 
elbows out to the sides for support (see Figure 6-5a).
 
2. Keeping your elbows out to the sides, raise your head, shoulders, and 
upper back off the floor about three inches (see Figure 6-5b).
 
3. Hold for a few seconds before returning to the starting position.
 
4. Complete ten repetitions and increase when you feel comfortable with 
the movement.
Remember to
 
✓ Support your head and neck with your hands.
 
✓ Keep your abdominals tight and engage your core.
 
✓ Not use your arms to pull yourself up — use your abs!

body weight. And be sure to stack your feet on top of one another, to help 
hold up your body weight during this exercise. 
 
1. Lie on your left side, propping up your body on your left elbow. Place 
your elbow directly beneath your shoulder (see Figure 6-6a).
 
 Place your right arm alongside your body or rest it at your side.
 
2. Lift your body and hips off the ground so that your torso comes off 
the floor and your body is in a straight line from your head down to 
your feet. 
 
 Make sure to keep your head in neutral position to keep your spine in 
proper alignment. 
 
3. Try to hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds (see Figure 6-6b).
 
4. Repeat for three repetitions and increase repetitions when you feel 
comfortable.

These tips will ensure that you do this exercise correctly and safely:
 
✓ Pull in your abdominal muscles, for support.
 
✓ Don’t allow your hips to drop toward the ground.
 
✓ Keep your breathing steady and strong — don’t hold your breath.

Side-lying crunch
The side-lying crunch is a great addition to your abdominal program because 
it targets the side muscles (obliques), helping to define your waist. It can feel 
a bit awkward to do at first and is sometimes easier to do with the assistance 
of an exercise ball, but with or without the ball, it’s a great core strengthener.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lying on the floor or on a mat, bend your knees and clasp your hands 
behind your neck (see Figure 6-7a).
 
2. Lifting your upper torso, raise yourself slightly off the floor using your 
waist muscles or obliques (as shown in Figure 6-7b). Bring your elbow 
toward your feet to target the waist.
 
3. Return to the floor and repeat on the other side after ten repetitions.
 
 Increase repetitions as you feel comfortable.

You can get the most from this exercise if you
 
✓ Engage your core throughout this entire exercise.
 
✓ Keep your knees on the ground and use your upper body to do the move.

 Chapter 6: Getting That Six Pack: Abdominal Core Superset
 
✓ Don’t pull on your head with your hands, or it will strain your neck.
 
✓ Breathe!
Half-up twists
Half-up twists are great for the entire core, not just the abs. The back, waist, 
and abdominals all get targeted with this challenging exercise. As a bonus, 
your butt gets a good workout too! 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Sit up tall on the floor on a mat, and put your hands on top of your knees.
 
2. Lean back until your arms are straight. Cross your arms in front of 
your chest, with each hand holding an elbow (see Figure 6-8a).
 
3. Twist at the waist from side to side, engaging your core as you sit up 
tall (as shown in Figure 6-8b).

✓ Lean back and use the strength of your abdominals to help you with this 
exercise.
 
✓ Sit up nice and tall — don’t let your shoulders and back round over.
Plank leg lifts
Performing the plank with leg lifts makes for a killer core exercise. This exer-
cise targets the abdominals and back while helping you maintain a straight, 
healthy spine. Be sure to stay lifted and maintain a straight back during this 
exercise. Great core strengthener. . . .
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie face down, resting your forearms flat on the floor; keep your 
elbows directly below your shoulders.
 
 Your feet should be touching or no more than an inch apart.
 
2. Lift your body off the floor using your forearms and toes, keeping 
your body as straight as possible (see Figure 6-9a).
 
3. Lift each leg one at a time off the floor before returning to the starting 
position (see Figure 6-9b).

4. Repeat for ten repetitions and increase repetitions when you feel 
comfortable.
Maximize the benefits of this exercise by doing the following:
 
✓ Keep your back long and straight, in line from your head to your heels.
 
✓ Avoid letting your butt or hips drop toward the floor.
 
✓ Breathe steadily.
 
✓ Engage your abs and be sure to keep your leg straight and your butt con-
tracted to help lift the leg. 
Superman — opposite arm and leg extension
The Superman trains your entire core to work together properly, to provide 
stability and balance, while at the same time strengthening your abdominals. 
Remember, keeping your back strong and flexible is the best prevention 
against low back problems.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie face down on a mat or the floor, with your arms extended over-
head and palms facing down (as shown in Figure 6-10a).
 
2. At the same time, extend your right arm and your left leg out straight 
from your body and hold them out about three to five inches off the 
floor (see Figure 6-10b).
 
 Imagine that strings are attached to your hand and foot, and that the 
strings are gently pulling your arm and leg away from each other, not 
up. You want to get the lengthening in your abdominal muscles and your 
spine, not shortening or compressing it.
 
3. Hold the position for five to eight seconds, breathing comfortably and 
normally.
 
4. Lower your arm and leg, and return to the floor.
 
5. Repeat the exercise five or six more times on each side and increase 
repetitions when you feel comfortable.
Make your Superman soar to new heights by remembering to
 
✓ Keep your abdominals tight. Lax abdominals may place undue stress on 
your lower-back muscles.
 
✓ Not arch your back.
 
✓ Not lift your foot or hand higher than 3 to 5 inches off the floor.

Spray-tanning those perfect abs
If you’ve seen Dancing with the Stars on televi-
sion — and who hasn’t? — you’re familiar with 
the trick of spray-tanning! Each week the danc-
ers get darker and darker, and look more and 
more sleek, don’t they? Yes, a lot of it has to do 
with their dance training, which does work your 
core intensely for weeks on end, but the finish-
ing touch is the spray tan!
Much better than going out in the sun these 
days, visiting a tanning salon that offers spray-
tanning is the hottest trend. Although you have 
to stand sans bathing suit in a booth while 
someone of the same sex sprays you with 
something that looks like a blow-dryer (you can 
wear a bathing suit, but it does leave a stain), 
spray tanning is painless and super quick! 
Costing anywhere from $40 to $50 a session, 
your new spray tan will last around ten days, 
depending on how often you shower or go in a 
hot tub. You’ll want to shower first and exfoliate 
afterward, or wash with a loofah, before you 
get a spray tan so it goes on evenly and lasts 
longer.
For the best results, I suggest doing the workout 
in this chapter two to three times a week for 
the next month and then go for your new spray 
tan. You’ll see a bigger difference in your tummy 
after you shore up your core a bit — and, believe 
it or not, they can actually etch a line down the 
middle of your rectus abdominus or midsection 
to make it look like you have a six-pack . . . now 
ain’t that good news?

Core Workout for a Better Butt
In This Chapter
▶ Working your core along and your lower half
▶ Getting a great butt workout
▶ Developing stronger glutes
▶ Shaping up your butt, hips, and core
▶ Getting familiar with the muscles of your lower body
▶ Loosening up your hips and buttocks
A
s you age, excess weight tends to gravitate toward the lower half of the 
body — yep, that means your butt! By now, most of you have probably 
discovered this for yourself. For women, the extra pounds usually come from 
giving birth and for men, well, I think they call that “sympathy weight” (tee-
hee). However, it’s really from a lack of exercise and usually sitting around all 
day at work and/or watching too much television.
The large muscle groups that exist in the lower half of the body can be tar-
geted more effectively with a tough workout, which I include in this chapter, 
that transitions all your rear moves through your core. So the lifting, tighten-
ing, and strengthening you’ll be doing for your tush will be enhanced with a 
great core workout to booty, er, to boot.
In this chapter, I break down the muscles that make up your behind and get 
to the bottom of the best moves for your lower half, incorporating those 
moves into a tough workout that is sure to enhance your core assets.
 
The core is the bridge that connects the upper and lower half of your body. 
So to work your butt, you have to use your core! And vice versa. After you 
conquer the core moves in this chapter, try Chapter 6 for your abdominals 
to even things out a bit, and you’ll have the best butt and tightest core on 
the beach!

Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
Getting Some Junk in Your Trunk
There are three main movements you’ll be using to work your lower half in 
the following exercises: squeezing, stretching, and stepping.
In the following list, I describe the three main movements you use to work 
your lower half as well as how the exercises in this chapter can give you 
some junk in your trunk (and that’s a good thing!):
 
✓ Stepping: The hip flexors allow you to bend your hips and upper legs, 
and you use them when you step into a lunge or take one big step 
forward. As you do the lunge exercise or the squat, you use your hip 
flexors to control the movement and strengthen your hip joints as you 
maintain your body weight with your quadriceps and hamstrings or 
lower legs.
 
✓ Squeezing: Your glutes or butt is made up of three major muscles that 
work together to move your thigh away from your body or out to the 
side, to allow your leg to stretch out behind you and to turn your leg 
in and out as needed. As you lift your butt during the plank with leg lift 
exercises, you squeeze (or contract) your glutes to create a shapelier 
derriere.
 
✓ Stretching: Your hamstrings and quadriceps are the muscles that make 
up the upper leg, and you need to stretch these muscles so they can 
gain strength and provide stability throughout the lower body. As you 
stretch out these muscles in your legs and butt in opposite directions 
for the plies and side lunge, you increase the stretch in the gluteal mus-
cles and the lower leg muscles, which creates a leaner lower body.
Breaking Down Your “Butt”
To enhance your wealth of knowledge about the butt, check out these terms 
regarding the hip and buttocks muscles and their functional roles and tuck 
these terms away (and no, “functional roles” doesn’t mean ordering a shake 
with your fries):
 
✓ Glutes: One of the primary muscles of the buttocks, “glutes,” is a slang 
word that collectively refers to the three muscles in the buttocks:
 
• Gluteus maximus: The largest and most superficial muscle in your 
buttocks, the maximus, is responsible for hip extension, and it also 
helps rotate the hip outward.
 
• Gluteus medius: This muscle is the middle-sized glute muscle, and 
its function is to move your leg to the side (abduction of your hip 
joint). It also helps rotate your thigh inward and outward.

95
 Chapter 7: Core Workout for a Better Butt
 
• Gluteus minimus: The smallest and deepest of the glutes. It also 
functions as a hip abductor and rotates the thigh inward and 
outward.
 
If either the gluteus maximus or minimus is excessively tight or weak, you can 
experience lower back pain or other postural problems. That’s why it’s impor-
tant to balance the strength in your butt with core strength to provide stabil-
ity in your body and prevent injury from muscle imbalance.
My Core Secrets Workout
The following exercises may be a pain in the rear, but (no pun intended) they’ll 
pay off big time by giving you a leaner, toner lower body and a shapelier core.
 
Before you begin this workout, do five to ten minutes of cardio exercise. You 
can jump rope or take a brisk walk that starts at a slow pace and ends at a 
faster one or try the warm-up exercises in Chapter 4 of this book. A good 
warm-up gets your circulation going and increases the flexibility in your hip 
joints before you begin the following workout. Because walking is a good all-
around exercise that can help alleviate built-up tension in the lower half of 
your body, I strongly suggest adding it at the beginning or end of this work-
out. You can also try doing some lower-body stretching to increase your flex-
ibility and help your body relax after this workout if you head to Chapter 14. 
You’ll find the butt and back stretch and a great gluteal stretch that I suggest 
doing to prevent any stiffness or soreness that may have accumulated in your 
lower half.
Squats — half up, half down
You will be doing squats in this exercise as you work your core by pulling it 
in tight! All the large muscle groups in the lower half of your body get a good 
workout in the squat — half up, half down exercise by pausing halfway down 
when you lower down into your squat and pausing halfway up when you 
raise up out of your squat to standing.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with your feet wider than shoulder width apart. Toes and knees 
should be pointing forward. Engage your abdominals and stand tall 
(see Figure 7-1a).
 
2. Slowly lower your butt halfway toward the ground and pause for 
a moment before lowering all the way down to a 90-degree angle 
in the squat position as if you were going to sit back in a chair (see 
Figure 7-1b).

96
Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
 
 Keep your weight in your heels and your back as upright as possible.
 
3. Exhale and tighten your abdominal muscles as you press back up into 
a standing position, pausing halfway for a moment, before returning 
to standing position.
 
 Complete 10 to 15 repetitions.

Remember to:
 
✓ Keep your abdominal muscles tight to protect your back while doing 
this exercise.
 
✓ Avoid letting your knees go beyond your toes to prevent from placing 
strain on your knees.
 
✓ Make sure that you don’t let your butt drop down below hip level. 
Remember you’re sitting down in a pretend chair so you won’t need to 
press back that far.
Reverse lunges — half up, half down
This reverse lunge is a great butt and core strengthener along with giving you 
killer abs.

97
 Chapter 7: Core Workout for a Better Butt
 
You can add weights to make this exercise more intense as shown in this 
exercise.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Step or lunge back with 
your right leg bending your left knee at a 90-degree angle (as shown in 
Figure 7-2a).
 
2. Push halfway through and pause for a moment before pushing 
straight up with your right knee as you contract your butt muscles 
(see Figure 7-2b).
 
3. Hold the knee raise for a few seconds before returning your leg 
behind you to starting position.

Follow these important tips while doing this exercise:
 
✓ Keep a straight back and not an arched one.
 
✓ Make sure you hold for a few seconds as you raise your knee.
 
✓ Pull your abs in tight and contract your butt muscles before doing this 
exercise.

Plank leg lifts 
The plank with leg lifts is a killer core exercise targeting the butt and the 
abdominals. Be sure to stay lifted and maintain a straight back during this 
exercise.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie face down resting your forearms flat on the floor, keep your 
elbows directly below your shoulders. Your feet should be touching or 
no more than an inch apart.
 
2. Lift your body up off the floor using your forearms and toes, keeping 
your body as straight as possible (see Figure 7-3a). 
 
3. Lift each leg one at a time off the floor before returning to starting 
position (see Figure 7-3b). You don’t have to lift the legs more than half 
an inch to get the benefit of this exercise. 
 
 Repeat for ten repetitions.

 Chapter 7: Core Workout for a Better Butt
Here’s what you need to keep in mind for this exercise:
 
✓ Keep your back straight and in one long line from your head to your heels.
 
✓ Avoid letting your butt or hips drop down toward the floor. 
 
✓ Breathe steady and engage your abs.
Side lunge, left and right
The side lunge uses the same technique as the forward lunge only you’ll be 
stepping step out at a 45-degree angle from the starting position instead of 
straight forward. It’s good for strengthening your butt muscles and working 
your abdominals. 
 
 To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Standing with your feet about shoulder width apart, keep your legs 
straight but not locked.
 
2. Take one large step sideways with your right leg. Slowly push back up 
using your right leg, butt, and core muscles to standing position (as 
seen in Figure 7-4).
 
 Alternate sides — doing ten reps on each leg.

Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
While doing this exercise, remember to
 
✓ Keep your hands on your hips as you step out sideways into a lunge.
 
✓ Keep your knees soft — don’t lock your knees.
 
✓ Keep your breathing steady and strong — don’t hold your breath.
Lunges — half up, half down
Lunges really work your butt as they call on your core muscles to help keep 
your chest lifted, shoulders back, and midsection strengthened. The lunge 
strongly defines your butt and quadricep muscles.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Take a big step forward with your right leg and lower your right 
knee halfway down toward the floor. Pause for a moment before 
lowering down into a full lunge position with your thigh at a 
90-degree angle to the floor.
 
2. Exhale as you straighten your knees halfway up to standing, pause for a 
moment before returning to starting position (as shown in Figure 7-5).

You get better, safer results if you follow these tips for this exercise:
 
✓ Keep your arms close to your sides or hands on your hips while performing 
this exercise.
 
✓ Keep your back straight and long as you point your tailbone down 
towards the floor — don’t arch your back.
 
✓ Keep your eyes lifted and looking straight ahead — don’t let your head 
drop down.
Would you like to do a split?
Can you do a split or was it just never possible? 
Perhaps the real question is not whether you 
could or not but why in the heck would you 
even try?
To do a split it requires a lot of flexibility and 
technique. And if you’re not performing in the 
Cirque du Soleil, it might not be worth the payoff. 
However, if doing a split is something you’ve 
always wanted to do, follow these guidelines:
 ✓ Warm up properly.
 ✓ Perform individual stretches for your ham-
strings, quads, and inner thighs (see exam-
ples in Chapter 14).
 ✓ Make sure these areas are warm and limber 
before you make your first attempt.
 ✓ Begin kneeling on one leg, and place your 
opposite foot out in front of you flat on the 
floor.
 ✓ Slowly slide the knee beneath you back-
ward as far as you can.
 ✓ Notice that your front leg will gradually 
extend. Find your comfort zone and stay 
there for a few deep breaths.
 ✓ Inhale, and as you exhale; see if you can 
move the knee back a little farther and take 
the stretch a little deeper.
 ✓ Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and then 
release the stretch by coming back to the 
starting position.
 ✓ Try the stretch again and repeat two or 
three times — each time trying to go a little 
deeper and getting your legs straighter.
In a perfect split, both legs must be straight, 
both hips facing forward, and the buttocks of 
your front leg on the floor. You probably won’t 
get it the first time you try, but you can gradu-
ally get a little farther every day. Don’t be dis-
couraged and certainly don’t expect to be able 
to do a perfect split right away! It will take 
weeks of slowly and progressively increasing 
your range of motion in the split position. As 
with any stretch, perform this one slowly and 
carefully and pay attention to form.
It’s really fun to do something you thought was 
impossible, and many of you may think it’s 
impossible to do a perfect split. But you never 
know until you try, right?

Bridge
The bridge lift combines your tush and your core as you press your hips up 
toward the ceiling and squeeze your butt muscles. Your hips and lower back 
get targeted in this exercise also.
 
As you lift your hips up, you need to keep your back from sagging or arching.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Rest 
your arms flat on the floor alongside your body (see Figure 7-6a).
 
 Make sure that you keep your knees stacked over your ankles.
 
2. Press your hips as high as possible toward the ceiling (see Figure 7-6b).
 
3. Slowly lower your hips down to starting position.
 
 Complete 10 to 15 repetitions.

When you do bridge lifts, remember to
 
✓ Squeeze your buttocks tight and pull your belly button toward your 
spine during this exercise.

103
 Chapter 7: Core Workout for a Better Butt
 
✓ Keep your lower body tight and pressed up during this exercise — don’t 
let your hips and butt sink toward the ground.
 
✓ Keep your hands on your hips to help steady your body.
 
✓ Keep your hips even with your torso — don’t press your hips too high.
Bridge with knees together
This exercise works the butt, hips, abdominals, and lower back better known 
as your core. Be sure to use a smaller range of motion or don’t lift your hips 
too high off the ground to avoid stress on your lower back.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie flat on your back, keeping your knees bent and tight together. 
Place your feet flat on the floor and your arms at your sides. Keeping 
the spine neutral, pull your belly button in toward your spine (see 
Figure 7-7a).
 
2. Slowly lift your hips up toward the ceiling, allowing your butt and lower 
back to lift up toward the ceiling and off of the floor (see Figure 7-7b).
 
 Hold for three to five seconds.

✓ Pull your abdominal muscles in for support.
 
✓ Maintain a neutral spine.
 
✓ Breathe! Don’t hold your breath.

Putting It All Together
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing the benefits of circuit training
▶ Understanding how little moves add up to big core changes
▶ Getting the best core exercises to do on your back and stomach
▶ Core strengthening from your head to your toes
▶ Finding out what makes up a total body workout
T
his chapter is geared toward giving you a total body workout, especially 
if you’re short on time. When you can do this workout comfortably two 
or three days a week, you can start to increase your resistance by adding one 
of the accessories shown in Part III of this book. 
However, if you want to work a particular area of the body or you want to 
focus on arms one day and legs the next along with your core, the specialized 
chapters in Part II of this book are better suited for you.
Adding cardiovascular training to go along with the total core workout is 
ideal. Walking is the perfect compliment to core training, believe it or not!
 
Warming up your body increases the temperature of your muscles, which 
reduces the risk of injury. For burning belly fat, studies show that walking is 
the number one suggested exercise. So I suggest 30 minutes of walking five 
days a week as the perfect complement to the total core series in this chapter. 
If you have a few extra minutes to spare and want a really great warm-up, head 
to Chapter 4.
 
When you begin using your new total body in one fitness program, you’ll soon 
discover that it requires a lot of endurance. Like with any new form of exer-
cise, avoid overtraining by resting 24 to 48 hours in between workouts.

Core Secrets to Looking Better Shirtless
For working your abs and back, otherwise known as your core, there are a 
few tricks that you can do to increase your success. The abdominal muscles 
respond pretty quickly to these body-shaping techniques so you can incor-
porate them in the workout in this chapter after you try them. Read on to 
see if they make a big difference for you and add up to big changes like they 
do for me:
 
✓ Work harder by bringing your feet closer together. By bringing your 
base, or in this case your feet, closer together when you’re standing, 
sitting on a weight bench, using an exercise ball, or lying on the floor, 
you can intensify your workout because you’ve shortened your stride or 
base by bringing your feet closer together. Just for fun, try starting with 
your feet shoulder width apart and then with each repetition, move your 
feet just an inch or two closer to each other until your feet finally meet. 
This will increase the level of difficulty of the exercise gradually so you 
can feel the difference a little bit at a time and see what is most comfort-
able for you. Small modifications add up to big changes!
 
✓ Increase the intensity by increasing the distance between the ball and 
your core. If you’re using an exercise ball for any of the following exer-
cises, remember that the same rule applies; the farther away the ball is 
from your core (torso), the more difficult maintaining your balance is. 
For example, when you do a push-up on the ball, it’s much easier when 
you place the ball underneath your lower legs because it’s closer to 
your abs, hips, and glutes. To increase the difficulty, simply roll the ball 
out to your feet so that it’s farther away from the center of your body, 
making maintaining your balance harder.
 
✓ Always control the exercise and don’t let it control you. Kind of like 
the saying, “make sure you’re walking the dog and the dog’s not walking 
you,” the same thought process applies here. With each repetition, make 
sure you think about the movement and the body part you’re working so 
that you control it. Don’t let the momentum of the exercise take over. 
 
✓ Contract and tighten your abs at the beginning of each exercise. If you 
contract and tighten your abs each time you begin an exercise, you are 
using your core strength to help complete the exercise. The best way 
to do this is to take a big deep inhale before you start then immediately 
exhale your breath as you tighten your tummy and begin the exercise. It 
really works, so try it — and that’s an order!

 Chapter 8: Putting It All Together
Maintaining the “S” Position 
or Neutral Spine
Being in neutral is really an active position where the lower abdominal and 
pelvic stabilizer muscles are activated to create a girdle of sorts for the body 
to protect itself from injury. So, when you hear the term neutral spine used in 
exercises, I’m referring to the neutral position of your spine. 
To keep your back from arching and to practice neutral spine, try this exer-
cise in front of a mirror:
 
1. Stand facing the side as you look into a mirror.
 
2. Imagine a ruler extending down along your back from the top of your 
shoulders or shoulder blades to the bottom of your pelvis or hips.
 
 You should be standing tall and straight with everything stacked up 
neatly as follows: head, shoulders, rib cage, pelvis, and legs.
Where it’s at: Locating your core 
Working your core seems to be the new buzz-
word these days. However, knowing exactly 
what it is and locating it can be a totally differ-
ent story. So here’s my explanation of what it is 
and where to find it in layman’s terms! 
Your core is made up of the deep abdominal 
and back muscles that work as stabilizers for 
the entire body. These muscles are referred to 
as deep muscles because you can’t see them. 
Still, these muscles are responsible for main-
taining the body’s core stability.
The three muscles in the core, or midsection or 
trunk, of the body are the transverse abdomi-
nus, multifidus, and the quadratus lumborum. 
These muscles work together to protect the 
spine and to help with everyday or functional 
activities, such as lifting, throwing, bending, 
reaching, and running. So you can see why 
keeping the stabilizer muscles well conditioned 
is extremely important.
Core training has many benefits but the number 
one would be to strengthen the “bridge” that 
connects your upper body with your lower 
body … I think that’s the best way to think of it. 
If the bridge is weak, the cars aren’t going to 
make it across. 
To get the full benefits of working your upper 
and lower body along with your core, see 
the Chapters in Part II of this book which are 
designed specifically for the abs, butt, and 
back.

108
Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
You can also try this exercise by lying on the floor:
 
1. Lie on the floor with your back pressed down.
 
 If your back is flat, you shouldn’t be able to put your hand between the 
floor and your back.
 
2. Exhale as you bring your knees to your chest and think about the 
placement of your back on the floor.
 
3. Hold your knees to your chest for a few moments, and then release 
your legs back to the floor.
 
 Notice how your back feels now. Is it pressed down, not arching? Can 
you feel the neutral position of your body as it relaxes on the floor but 
is actively pressed downward? If so, you should now be able to slip your 
hand under your lower back and feel the natural curve of your spine, 
otherwise known as maintaining neutral spine.
You will need to use neutral spine with all core exercises and any other work-
out that involves lying on the floor. 
Total Core Workout
This workout provides crossover benefits for many of the activities you do 
in everyday life by mimicking the movements you use when you push, pull, 
kneel, or squat. In addition, these exercises help improve your overall core 
strength.
The first seven exercises in this section focus on core work that is done while 
lying on your back. Mastering proper form and remembering to use neutral 
spine throughout the following back series will help you see improvements 
faster and help you progress quicker through the program.
The last six exercises in this section —including the Superman and Plank 
positions — focus on working the core as you lie on your tummy. For most 
people, you will want to start off with one set and work your way up to addi-
tional sets after a few weeks. 
 
If you find the following exercises challenging but are able to maintain proper 
form while doing them, then you’re working out at the right level for you.
On your back core series
The following exercises are a combination of all the best exercises I give you 
in this book. They are put together in a specific sequence so you should do 
one right after the other, performing one set of ten repetitions of each. As 

109
 Chapter 8: Putting It All Together
you build in strength and stamina, you will progress to another set of ten and 
so on and so on. Be sure to listen to your body and only do as much or as 
little as feels right for you! 
Abdominal crunch
Doing abdominal crunches not only works the abs but also strengthens the 
back and hips. 
 
Make sure you keep your lower back in neutral spine when doing crunches to 
maintain proper form and support your lower back. If you let your lower back 
arch off the ground, you could strain it and pull a muscle. Not good!
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lying on the floor, bend your knees and rest your feet flat on the floor 
(see Figure 8-1a).
 
2. As you tighten your abdominals and with your hands on either side 
of your head, slowly lift your shoulders from the floor toward your 
knees (see Figure 8-1b).
 
3. Hold the lift for a few seconds, and then slowly roll your shoulders 
back to the floor.
 
 Complete ten repetitions.

Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
While doing the ab crunch, remember to
 
✓ Relax your neck as you curl up into a crunch.
 
✓ Keep your chin toward the ceiling and don’t use your hands to pull your 
head off the floor. 
 
✓ Maintain your neutral spine by pressing your lower back into the floor.
 
✓ Exhale as you curl up into the crunch and inhale as you release back down.
Double crunch 
This exercise tightens the lower abs and upper abs by bringing the upper and 
lower body together like an accordion. Be sure to return to starting position 
each time you finish the double crunch to help you get the best toning in 
your midsection possible.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Keeping your knees bent and your feet off the floor, engage your 
abdominal muscles by pulling your belly button in toward your spine 
(see Figure 8-2a). Place your fingertips behind your head for support.
 
2. Pull your knees toward your chest, focusing on your abdominals as 
you bring your elbows toward your knees (see Figure 8-2b).

 Chapter 8: Putting It All Together
 
3. Slowly lower legs and arms back down to the starting position to 
complete one rep. Aim for three sets of ten repetitions.
Although it sounds more like your favorite ice cream rather than your 
favorite exercise, you can help burn off those double-crunch calories if you 
remember to
 
✓ Hold the movement at the top before slowly letting your knees back 
down toward the floor 
 
✓ Use your core muscles to control the movement.
 
✓ Let your head rest in your hands for support during the crunch. Don’t 
pull on your head with your hands.
Hip lifts
This exercise works the hips, abdominals, and lower back, better known as 
your core. Be sure to use a smaller range of motion or don’t lift your hips too 
high off the ground to avoid stress on your lower back. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie flat on your back, keeping your knees bent and tight together. 
Place your feet flat on the floor and your arms at your sides. Keeping 
the spine neutral, pull your belly button in toward your spine (see 
Figure 8-3a). 
 
2. Slowly lift your hips up toward the ceiling as you push through your 
heels, allowing your butt and lower back to lift up toward the ceiling 
and off of the floor (see Figure 8-3b). 
 
 Hold for three to five seconds. 
 
3. Slowly lower your hips back down, allowing your back to return to 
neutral position and keeping your knees pressed tight.
 
 Repeat ten times.
While doing hip lifts, you need to
 
✓ Pull your abdominal muscles in for support.
 
✓ Maintain a neutral spine. 
 
✓ Remember not to hold your breath.
 
✓ Avoid hyperextending your lower back.

Oblique crunches
The oblique crunch or side-lying crunch is a great addition to your core pro-
gram because it targets the side muscles or obliques, helping whittle the waist. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lying on the floor or on a mat, bend your knees and clasp your hands 
behind your neck (see Figure 8-4a). 
 
2. Lifting your upper torso, raise yourself slightly off the floor using your 
waist muscles or obliques (as shown in Figure 8-4b). Bring your elbow 
toward your feet to target the waist. 
 
3. Return back down to the floor and repeat on other side after ten 
repetitions.
For these crunches, you need to be sure to
 
✓ Engage your core throughout this entire exercise.
 
✓ Keep your knees on the ground and use your upper body to do the move.
 
✓ Avoid pulling on your head with your hands or it will strain your neck.
 
✓ Breathe!

Half-up twists 
Half-up twists are great for the entire core and not just the abs. The back, 
butt, waist, and abdominals all get targeted with this challenging exercise. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps: 
 
1. Sit up tall on the floor on a mat and put your hands on top of your 
knees.
 
2. Lean back until your arms are straight. Cross your arms in front of 
your chest with each hand holding an elbow (see Figure 8-5a).
 
3. Twist at the waist from side to side engaging your core as you sit up 
tall (as shown in Figure 8-5b).
Here’s what you need to remember while doing this exercise: 
 
✓ Let your head follow the movement from side to side with you.
 
✓ Lean back and use the strength of your back to help you with this exercise.
 
✓ Sit up nice and tall. Don’t let your shoulders and back round over.

Bicycle crunches
This is the best exercise to work your rectus abdominus or ab muscle that 
runs right down the middle of your torso. The twisting and pulling motion 
you do with your knees and upper body is perfect for getting your core in 
shape fast and helps reduce your waist size too by working the obliques. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and thighs perpendicular to 
the floor. Place your fingers just behind your ears (see Figure 8-6a).
 
2. Lift your shoulders off the floor as you straighten the right leg and 
bring the left knee in toward your right armpit. 
 
3. Without relaxing the torso or returning your shoulders to the floor, 
repeat on the other side by straightening the left leg and pulling the 
right knee in toward the left armpit (as shown in Figure 8-6b).
 
4. Alternate the legs in a slow bicycling movement ten times on each side.
Bike your way to great abs with the following tips:
 
✓ Pull your abdominal muscles in for support.
 
✓ Allow your hips to drop down toward the ground — don’t arch you back.

115
 Chapter 8: Putting It All Together
 
✓ Keep your breathing steady and strong — don’t hold your breath.
 
✓ Avoid pulling you head with your hands to avoid straining your neck.

Reverse crunches
By bringing your lower body to your upper body, you target your lower abs 
and will see a tightening in this area faster than with other ab exercises. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Keeping your knees bent and your feet off the floor, engage your 
abdominal muscles by pulling your belly button in toward your spine 
(see Figure 8-7a). 
 
2. Pull your knees toward your chest, focusing on your abdominals as 
you keep your arms flat on the floor with palms facing down beside 
you (see Figure 8-7b).
 
3. Slowly lower hips and legs back down to the starting position to com-
plete one rep. 
 
 Aim for one set of ten repetitions.

116

Keep these tips in mind while doing a reverse crunch:
 
✓ Hold the movement at the top before slowly letting your knees back 
down toward the floor 
 
✓ Keep the pace slow and steady so you are using your core muscles to 
control the movement — don’t go too fast.
Half crunch
This exercise is a super strengthener for your abdominals and core muscles. 
It takes a lot of strength to pull your body off the ground using only your core 
muscles so don’t let the name fool you!
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back with your legs straight and your arms alongside your 
body with palms facing down.
 
2. Contracting your abs, lift your shoulders and torso off the floor first 
by curling up halfway, making sure to lift your head last. Your neck 
should be in line with your spine (as shown in Figure 8-8).

117
 Chapter 8: Putting It All Together
 
3. Lower back to starting position, being sure to return your head to the 
floor last. 
 
 Repeat for ten repetitions.
 
Figure 8-8: 
Half crunch.
 
A half crunch doesn’t half the work, especially when you follow proper form 
with these tips:
 
✓ Use your abdominals to pull yourself off the floor and not your hands.
 
✓ Exhale as you curl up and inhale as you lower back down to the floor.
 
✓ Keep your head in line with your spine. Don’t pull on your neck muscles 
by lifting your neck.
On-your-tummy core series
The following core exercises are done as you’re lying on your tummy. They 
target the abdominals and back muscles by building strength and stamina 
throughout your core as you hold each position. 
Superman
This exercise trains your entire core to work together properly to provide 
stability and balance, while at the same time strengthening your back. 
Remember, keeping your back strong and flexible is the best prevention 
against low back problems. 
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie face down on a mat or the floor with your arms extended over-
head and palms facing down (as shown in Figure 8-9a).

118
Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
 
2. At the same time, extend your right arm and your left leg out straight 
from your body and hold them out about three to five inches off the 
floor (see Figure 8-9b).
 
3. Hold the position for five to eight seconds, breathing comfortably and 
normally.
 
4. Lower your arm and leg and return to the floor.
 
 Repeat the exercise five times on each side.

Work yourself super-hard with the Superman pose by remembering to
 
✓ Keep your abdominals tight. Lax abdominals may place undue stress on 
your lower back muscles.
 
✓ Avoid arching your back.
 
✓ Not lift your foot or hand higher than three to five inches off the floor. 
Plank leg lifts 
The plank with leg lifts is a killer core exercise targeting the abdominals and 
back while helping you maintain a long, healthy spine. Be sure to stay lifted 
and maintain a long, straight back during this exercise.

119
 Chapter 8: Putting It All Together
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie face down resting your forearms flat on the floor, keep your 
elbows directly below your shoulders. Your feet should be touching 
or no more than an inch apart.
 
2. Lift your body up off the floor using your forearms and toes, keeping 
your body as straight as possible. (See Figure 8-10a.) 
 
3. Lift each leg one at a time off the floor before returning to starting 
position (see Figure 8-10b). 
 
 You don’t have to lift the legs more than half an inch to get the benefit of 
this exercise. 
 
 Repeat for ten repetitions.

You can punch up the benefits of the plank if you:
 
✓ Keep your back long and straight in line from your head to your heels.
 
✓ Avoid letting your butt or hips drop down toward the floor. 
 
✓ Breathe steady and engage your abs. 

120
Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
Push-ups
Push-ups target your chest and shoulder muscles along with the abdominals 
to give good core strength and all-over toning. 
 
Don’t let your butt dip down toward the floor during the push-up. Keep your 
back straight and long. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie with your belly on the ground and your legs straight out behind 
you. Make sure that your hands are a little wider than your shoulders on 
the floor (as Figure 8-11a shows). 
 
2. Lower toward the floor with the upper body, bending your elbows out 
to the side (see Figure 8-11b).
 
3. Straighten your elbows and exhale as you press back up into starting 
position.
 
 Complete ten repetitions.

While doing a push-up:
 
✓ Keep your abdominal muscles tight to help you maintain your balance.

121
 Chapter 8: Putting It All Together
 
✓ Use proper breathing, inhaling as you lower and exhaling as you press 
back up.
 
✓ Keep your back straight and in line with your head and the rest of your 
body. Don’t arch your back.
 
✓ Keep your elbows from locking at the top of the push-up to avoid strain 
on the joint. 
Back extensions
Targeting the back to strengthen your abs is what core training is all about, 
isn’t it? And the back extension exercise seems simple, yet it’s a powerful 
and effective back strengthener. It also targets the lower back so if you have 
lower back problems, you may want to skip this exercise.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Using a mat or towel, lie on your stomach, placing your arms at your 
sides with palms facing up (see Figure 8-12a).
 
2. Pulling in or contracting your abdominal muscles, lift your chest a few 
inches off the floor keeping your gaze straight ahead at all times (see 
Figure 8-12b).

3. Hold for a few seconds before lowering your chest back toward the 
ground. 
 
 Repeat this exercise three to five times.
Make the best of this back exercise by remembering to
 
✓ Tighten your butt or glutes to protect your lower back as you lift your 
chest off the floor.
 
✓ Tighten your abdominals throughout this move.
 
✓ Only lift to the point that you’re not straining your back. Don’t lift too 
high off the floor.
Hip extensions
This is a good strengthening exercise for the abs, glutes, and lower back. It’s 
perfect for working on your posture and a great exercise to end your core 
series with!
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Kneeling on your hands and knees, place your hands below your 
shoulders and be sure to keep knees directly beneath your hips (see 
Figure 8-13a).
 
2. Raise your opposite arm and leg together off the floor, extending your 
leg behind you and your arm out in front of you (as seen in Figure 
8-13b). Hold for a count of three. 
 
 Think of lengthening your body instead of just lifting your arm and leg as 
high as possible. 
 
3. Lower your arm and leg back to the starting position. 
 
 Repeat this exercise alternating sides for ten repetitions for each side.
 
Try to stay as relaxed as possible and don’t tense up. 
Here are a few tips to remember for this hip exercise:
 
✓ Pull your belly button toward your spine.
 
✓ Avoid tensing up your shoulders and neck.
 
✓ Keep your balance.
 
✓ Use your breath to inhale and exhale with the movement.

Cooling Down After Heating Up
If you’ve ever stopped too quickly during an aerobic class or in the middle of 
a run, you’ll know what I’m talking about — cooling down is just as important 
as warming up. Because the blood gets distributed to the extremities during 
your workout and needs time to return to the heart for oxygen, if you stop 
midstream, you can faint or get dizzy.
The best activity for cooling down your body after a workout is a five-minute, 
well-paced walk that ends in a slow-paced walk. Combine this with the easy 
core stretches in Chapter 15, and you’re sure to feel relaxed and flexible 
when you’re done with the workout in this chapter. 
 
When you cool your body down properly by taking the time to stretch, you 
minimize or eliminate the muscle soreness that can result from skimping on 
this important step.  

124
Part II: Core Workouts to Help Sculpt Your Trouble Areas 
Circuit training
Circuit training is a fun way to train to stave off 
boredom and get results fast! It keeps you from 
burning out or getting tired of one particular 
exercise and challenges your body by quickly 
moving you through a series of exercises 
working different body parts at a fast pace. 
By moving at such a fast pace, you get the 
benefits of aerobic exercise in addition to the 
strengthening benefits you get from the series 
of exercises you’re performing. Because circuit 
training is usually done in 30 minutes or less, it 
saves you time and burns fat more efficiently by 
keeping your heart rate elevated throughout the 
entire workout.
Switching up your workout or trying something 
new is a good idea when you’ve been consis-
tently training in one area or training in one 
sport. And circuit training is a good way to try 
something new and exciting that can burn more 
fat, develop more muscles, and, of course, give 
you the core strength you need so badly.

In this part . . .
H
ere I give you specific core exercises to use with dif-
ferent pieces of fitness equipment. For instance, in 
Chapter 9, I give you exercises to help train your core on 
the exercise ball. I also show you what size ball is right for 
you (in case you’re new to the exercise ball) and abdomi-
nal routines to help you reshape your midsection using 
the ball.
In Chapter 10, I give you core strength–training routines 
you can do with weights. I also give you complete weight-
training guidelines, including how to pick the right 
amount of weight for you and how to choose the correct 
number of sets and repetitions. I even give you a little 
primer on weight machines and how they are used for 
core training in the gym. Finally, Chapter 10 shows you 
how to incorporate weight training into core training with 
upper- and lower-body exercises that are all transitioned 
through your core.

Chapter 9
Challenging Your Core on the Ball
In This Chapter
▶ Working your core on the ball
▶ Picking the right size ball to train your core
▶ Getting a great lesson in ball balance
▶ Developing a stronger core with the ball
▶ Shaping up your abs with ball exercises
A
s you get older (and, yes, we all do), excess weight tends to gravitate 
toward the midsection of your body, better known as your gut. For 
women it usually accumulates after childbirth, and for men . . . well, it usually 
accumulates from watching too much football and drinking too much beer. 
Although many different studies about how to combat slackening abdominal 
muscles and reducing belly fat have been done, analyzing whether cardio or 
weights or crunches or a combination of all is the best route, undoubtedly, 
no better piece of equipment can strengthen your abdominals and shore up 
your core faster than the exercise ball. The exercises ball challenges your 
balance and resistance and makes you use your internal abdominal muscles 
just to sit on it and keep you from falling off.
When you do the exercises in this chapter, you’re bound to uncover strength 
that you never knew you had. The core exercises combined with the exercise 
ball increase your overall level of fitness and challenge your balance to help 
strengthen your core as you call on your deep internal stabilizing muscles.
In this chapter, I not only guide you through the proper way to choose and 
use your ball, but I also give you a great core workout to do on the ball. For 
the most efficient and effective workout, follow this workout the way I’ve 
ordered it in this chapter — don’t skip around or leave anything out.
 
Before you begin this chapter’s workout, do five to ten minutes of cardio exer-
cise. You can try the warm-up exercises in Chapter 4 or take a brisk walk that 
starts at a slow pace and ends in a faster one. After your workout, you need 
to stretch, to prevent any stiffness or soreness that may have accumulated in 
your abdominals and lower back.

128
Part III: Developing Core Strength Using Accessories 
Finding a Ball That Fits
You need an exercise ball to challenge your balance for the following core 
exercises, so you first need to know the correct size of the ball you should 
be using.
Using a ball that fits your particular height and weight can make or break 
your workout. For example, check out the possible scenarios you can 
encounter when using the wrong-size ball:
 
✓ If you use a ball that is too small
 
• You could hurt your back because you should be sitting up tall 
with your thighs parallel to the floor in order to lengthen your 
spine and not compress it.
 
• You could hurt your hips because they will sink below your knees 
which causes injury to the hip joint. 
 
• You will not be able to do the exercises properly because you will 
not be able to maintain a seated position.
 
✓ If you use a ball that is too big
 
• You could fall off because your feet won’t touch the ground when 
you sit on it.
 
• You could have improper spinal alignment because you have to 
shift too much during the exercises.
 
• You could hurt your hips because they should be higher than your 
pelvis when you sit on the ball. 
The following sections give you a few great ways to pick the right ball for you. 
And after you find a ball that best suits you, you have to get yourself suited 
to your ball. I cover that next.
Sizing up the ball by using your height
When you stand next to an exercise ball, it should be even with or slightly 
above your knee level. Figure 9-1 provides a quick illustration. Find your 
height and see which ball size you should try first.

129
 Chapter 9: Challenging Your Core on the Ball

For kids who are five years and younger, always use a 45 cm ball.
Sizing up the ball as if it were a chair
Another great way to tell whether your new ball is the correct height is to 
sit on it. When you sit on the ball, you should feel the same way you do 
when you sit on a chair and sit right in the middle and not off to one side. 
Place the ball behind you within arms reach and sit down as you guide 
yourself with your hands, placing them on either side of the ball. The rec-
ommended height allows you to bend your knees at a 90-degree angle when 
you’re sitting on the ball and your feet are flat on the floor. This angle keeps 
your hips level with or slightly higher than your knees, with your thighs 
parallel to the floor.
A ball that’s too small compromises the position of your hips and pelvis by 
lowering your hips below your knees. A ball that’s too large doesn’t allow 
your feet to touch the ground, making it unstable. Achieving a good balance 
between a ball that’s too large and a ball that’s too small gives you the best 
workout.

130
Part III: Developing Core Strength Using Accessories 
Sizing up the ball by lying on it
You can also tell if your ball is the right height by lying on it. When you lie on 
your stomach on the ball with your hands touching the floor and your legs 
extended behind you and your toes touching the floor, your back shouldn’t 
arch and your hands should comfortably touch the floor in front of you. Your 
back should maintain its natural curve, otherwise known as neutral spine 
(see Chapter 4). If you arch your back at all when you lie face down with your 
stomach on the ball, you need to get a smaller ball, to avoid injury from plac-
ing strain on your back. 
Getting a feel for sitting on the ball
When you first get your ball, sit on it with your back straight and feet flat on 
the floor. To get comfortable with the feel of sitting on the ball, start by sit-
ting on it and familiarizing yourself with the sensation of contracting your 
abdominal muscles to keep your balance. Doing so may seem unnatural to 
you at first, which is perfectly normal: When was the last time you sat on a 
ball and not a chair? To help get the hang of it, try replacing your office chair 
with your ball for at least an hour a day, just to get used to pulling in your 
abdominals and maintaining your balance.
Finding the Perfect Spot for 
Exercising on the Ball
Picking the right room and the right surface for working out with an exercise 
ball makes all the difference in the world for your workout. You can find out 
more specifics in the following sections about which space is best to roll 
around in with your ball.
Picking the right space
The right space means finding a spot that gives you enough room to perform 
the exercises. Look for a space that allows you to move in any direction and 
stretch out properly on the floor. Keep the following in mind as you try out 
each space:

131
 Chapter 9: Challenging Your Core on the Ball
 
✓ Because you never know what direction the ball will roll or what posi-
tion you’ll be using with any given exercise, be sure that you have 
enough room to lie flat on the floor with your arms extended over your 
head while holding the ball.
 
✓ You’ll also be standing with the ball above your head for some of the 
exercises, so make sure the space is tall enough to accommodate the 
ball when you’re standing with it over your head. 
 
If you’re using a room in your house, find an open area or clear one that’s at 
least 5 feet by 5 feet or 6 feet by 6 feet (if you’re taller than 5 feet, 8 inches). 
The general rule is 2 feet longer than your height and 2 feet wider than the 
width of your arms. (If you lie down and pretend you’re making a snow angel, 
you can measure the space you need that way.)
Don’t forget to remove anything with sharp edges from this space, such as a 
coffee table or stereo, to keep from running or rolling into it when you exercise.
Searching for the best surface
It can be intimidating enough for newcomers to use an exercise ball but then 
to have to worry about the right surface — well that seems like a lot to worry 
about doesn’t it? However, using the exercise ball on a hard, flat surface that 
you find in your house or garage works best to prevent injury. Because many 
of the ball exercises require you to use a non-slip surface, sticking to a hard-
wood surface or something that is non-skid works best. 
When it comes to doing positions that require you to lie on your tummy 
on the ball, you’ll need to place a mat underneath the ball to cushion your 
knees. You’ll also be using the resistance of the floor in many of the exercises 
to keep your hands and feet from slipping. 
If you have carpeted floors, you should do the ball exercises directly on the 
carpet because placing a mat or towel underneath the ball will make you slip. 
You’ll also want to wear tennis shoes so when your feet come in contact with 
the floor they are skid proof! You can also try pushing the ball up against the 
couch or other heavy object in the room to prevent you from slipping and 
help keep your balance.

The Big Easy Core Ball Workout
The following exercises may be difficult at first because you’ll have the added 
challenge of using the ball, but, ultimately, they’ll pay off big time by giving 
you a tauter midsection and a toner waist.
Bridge pose
The bridge pose is a great basic exercise to increase the amount of weight 
you put on your abdominals, hips, and lower back.
 
As you lift your hips, keep your back from sagging or arching.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Rest your head and shoulders on the ball and bend your knees at a 
90-degree angle (see Figure 9-2a).
 
 Keep your knees stacked over your ankles.
 
2. Press your hips as high as possible toward the ceiling without allow-
ing the lower back to arch (see Figure 9-2b).
 
Figure 9-2: 
Bridge pose.

133
 Chapter 9: Challenging Your Core on the Ball
 
3. Slowly lower your hips to starting position.
 
 Complete 10 to 15 repetitions.
While doing this exercise, remember to:
 
✓ Rest the back of your head on the ball during this exercise.
 
✓ Keep your lower body tight and pressed up during this exercise. 
Bridge lift with calves on 
ball — straight legs
The bridge lift works your entire core area. Because you have to use your 
lower legs to control the movement of the ball, this exercise may also chal-
lenge your calf muscles.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on the floor with your feet on top of the ball (see Figure 9-3a).
 
 Place your arms on the floor alongside your body for support. Be sure 
to keep your knees slightly bent to keep tension on the muscles and not 
the ligaments of the knee. 
 
2. Exhale as you raise your hips and pelvis toward the ceiling, pressing 
down into the ball with your feet to maintain your balance, keeping 
knees very slightly bent (see Figure 9-3b).
 
3. Inhale as you slowly lower your hips back toward the floor.
 
 Complete ten repetitions.
To maximize results with this exercise, you should:
 
✓ Keep your feet relaxed when they’re resting on the ball.
 
✓ Keep your toes pointing straight up toward the ceiling and not out to the 
side. 
 
✓ Lift your hips straight up toward the ceiling and keep a straight back.
 
✓ Keep your chin tucked into your chest — don’t lift your chin.

Ball push-ups
Floor push-ups on the ball target your abdominal muscles and lower back to 
keep you steady on the ball.
 
Keeping your lower legs or shins on the ball helps you balance yourself during 
the push-up.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie with your belly on the ball and walk your hands forward until the 
ball rests under your legs (as Figure 9-4a).
 
 Keep your hands directly below your shoulders.
 
2. Lower your upper body toward the floor, bending the elbows out to 
the sides (see Figure 9-4b).
 
3. Straighten your elbows and exhale as you press back up into starting 
position.
 
 Complete ten repetitions.

135

Ball push-ups work your core as long as you:
 
✓ Keep your abdominal muscles tight to help you maintain your balance.
 
✓ Use proper breathing, inhaling as you slowly lower your body and exhal-
ing as you press your body back up.
 
✓ Keep your back straight and in line with your head and the rest of your 
body. Don’t arch your back. 
 
✓ Keep elbows slightly bent and not locked in the “up” position. 
Core leg lifts
The lifting motion of your midsection used in this exercise helps create toner 
abs and a stronger back as well as the hamstrings and glutes. By adding the 
extra weight of your leg as you lift it off the ball, you’ll feel a strengthening in 
your back muscles as well.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:

136
Part III: Developing Core Strength Using Accessories 
 
1. As you lie on the floor, place your left leg on the ball and extend your 
right leg toward the ceiling (as Figure 9-5a shows).
 
2. Keeping your shoulders on the floor, lift your hips and extend your 
leg straight above you (see Figure 9-5b).
 
3. Point your toe and use your leg to make five small circles to the right, 
and then five small circles to the left.
 
4. Lower your leg back to the ball and return your hips to the floor.
 
5. Repeat this movement on the other side.
 
 Complete five sets on each side.
 
Figure 9-5:

When doing this exercise:
 
✓ Keep your arms flat on the floor alongside your body for support.
 
✓ Contract your abs before you lift your hips off the floor.
 
✓ Make sure that you don’t tense your neck and shoulders as you lift your 
leg off the ball.

137
 Chapter 9: Challenging Your Core on the Ball
Single-leg bridge
The single-leg bridge is a variation of the classic bridge exercise and is a 
much more advanced exercise. But the single-leg bridge targets your lower 
back, abdominals, and hips, which gives you a stronger core and hips. The 
single-leg bridge uses only one leg to support the weight of your entire body, 
so your all-important core (abs and butt muscles) gets a good workout.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Sit tall on the ball and roll down slowly until only your shoulders 
touch the ball.
 
2. As you contract your abs, place your left leg across your right thigh 
(see Figure 9-6a).
Muscles (not just cardio) burn fat!
Using different forms of resistance, such as 
hand weights and dumbbells, to reduce overall 
body fat has gotten a lot of attention lately. (I 
guess you cardio junkies need to take a break 
and read up on just a few of the reasons why a 
weight-training session burns more calories.)
Here are a few of the many benefits you get 
from resistance training:
 ✓ You burn 30 to 50 calories per day for each 
pound of muscle you put on.
 ✓ Building bigger muscles boosts your meta-
bolic rate (the rate at which you burn calo-
ries) and reduces overall body fat.
 ✓ “Burn calories while you sleep?” Yes, it’s 
true — lean body mass burns more calories 
than fat does. So if you have more muscle, 
you can burn more calories while you 
sleep.
 ✓ Strengthening your back muscles improves 
your posture and helps develop a long 
spine.
 ✓ Weight training increases your strength 
and muscle mass, as well as bone density, 
which reduces the risk of osteoporosis.
 ✓ Regularly working out with weights protects 
your joints and muscles from deterioration.
 ✓ Weight training strengthens the connective 
tissue within your body.
To burn the most calories in the shortest 
amount of time, you need to work the larger 
muscle groups in your body. Next time you’re 
doing a workout, try a few of these compound 
exercises instead of exercises that target indi-
vidual muscles:
 ✓ Squats
 ✓ Lat pulls
 ✓ Chest presses

138
Part III: Developing Core Strength Using Accessories 
 
3. Lift your hips toward the ceiling as you contract your butt muscles 
(see Figure 9-6b).
 
4. Pause for a moment and then lower your hips.
 
 Complete ten repetitions before you switch legs and repeat on the 
other side.
 
Figure 9-6: 
Single-leg 
bridge.
 
a
b
When you do a single-leg bridge, remember to:
 
✓ Keep your hands on your hips to help steady your body.
 
✓ Keep your hips even with your torso — don’t press your hips too high. 
Core extension
In this exercise, extending your leg behind you and placing your hips over 
the ball works your abs, your butt, and your back muscles to support your 
body and help you stay lifted.
 
Because you kneel on the floor in this exercise, you may want to place a floor 
mat or towel under your knees for comfort.

139
 Chapter 9: Challenging Your Core on the Ball
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Kneel with your chest on the ball and tighten your abdominal muscles 
by pulling your belly button in toward your spine. 
 
 Your hands should be resting on the ball for support.
 
2. Extend your right leg and left arm slowly until they’re opposite each 
other (as Figure 9-7 shows).
 
 Keep your right hand resting on the ball for support. Be sure you keep 
your back straight and in line with your arms and legs.
 
 You should be able to draw an imaginary line down the center of your 
body.
 
3. Point your toe and hold that pose for a few seconds before you return 
to your starting position.
 
 Complete five extensions on each side.
 
Figure 9-7: 
Core 
extension.
 
Follow these tips while performing this exercise:
 
✓ Keep your spine including your neck, on the same plane or level with 
your raised arm and leg. In other words, look straight down at the floor. 
 
✓ Avoid arching your back when you extend your arm and leg out over 
the ball.
Core flexion
Your core gets a great strengthening workout with this exercise by pulling 
the ball into your body. As a result, you strengthen your entire lower body 
with this slightly more advanced movement due to the amount of balance 
and stabilization required by your core and shoulder muscles. 

140
Part III: Developing Core Strength Using Accessories 
 
Be sure you use your core instead of your legs to pull in the ball.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie with the ball under your stomach and roll forward until the ball 
rests under your shins (as Figure 9-8a shows).
 
2. Pull the ball in using your hips, and slowly bring your knees into your 
chest (see Figure 9-8b).
 
 The top of your head should relax toward the floor and be in line with 
your spine.
 
3. Hold this position for a few seconds and then slowly extend your legs 
back into the starting position.
 
 Complete ten repetitions.
 
Figure 9-8: 
Core flexion.

b
You can kick butt with core flexion if you remember to:
 
✓ Use your hips to roll the ball toward your chest.
 
✓ Make sure that you don’t arch your lower back during this exercise.
 
✓ Keep your gaze toward the floor — don’t hyperextend your neck by 
looking up. 

141
 Chapter 9: Challenging Your Core on the Ball
Hitting Crunch Time
The best way to get killer abs is to use the exercise ball because its round shape 
helps place extra emphasis on the abdominal muscles. Throughout the follow-
ing core exercises, your body calls upon the stabilizing muscles or core muscles 
to support your weight on the ball, increasing the challenge and benefits.
Traditional abdominal crunches work the outer muscles known as the rectus 
abdominus. Working these muscles in conjunction with the deeper abdominal 
muscles or the transverse abdominus is the best way to target the entire core 
of the body.
Sit-ups
Perhaps the number-one exercise used on the ball is the abdominal crunch 
or sit-up. This abdominal exercise is harder than traditional on-the-floor sit-
ups because it requires more endurance — it’s sure to kick your butt!
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie with the ball supporting your lower back and pelvis, Place your 
feet shoulder width apart and keep your knees at a 90-degree angle.
 
2. With your hands behind your head and your elbows bent out to the 
sides, curl your body up halfway between a sitting and a lying posi-
tion (as Figure 9-9 shows).
 
 Keep your tailbone pressed down on the ball.
 
3. Slowly roll back onto the ball, one vertebra at a time.
 
 Complete two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions.
You can’t slack off with sit-ups as long as you:
 
✓ Draw your navel toward your spine when you contract your abdominal 
muscles to curl up.
 
✓ Exhale as you lift.
 
✓ Curl up and roll back down one vertebra at a time to keep from straining 
your back.
 
✓ Keep your gaze upward as you curl up to keep your neck in line with 
your spine — don’t pull on your neck with your hands or allow your 
chin to touch your chest.

Oblique crunches
The oblique crunch works the muscles that run along the waist, from the 
pelvis to the ribcage, otherwise known as the obliques. This exercise is great 
for men and women who want to strengthen the muscles that define their 
waistlines, which will help them lose their love handles as they shore up 
their core.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Kneeling on the floor, position your left hip and side of your body 
against the ball as you place your left arm on the ball for support. 
Straighten your right leg out to the side and bring your right arm 
behind your head so your hand is touching the back of your head (as 
shown in Figure 9-10a).
 
2. Crunch up, bringing your right shoulder and elbow down toward your 
rib cage and right leg as you exhale (refer to Figure 9-10b).
 
 Keep your left hip and side against the ball at all times, to keep from 
slipping.
 
3. Lower back down toward the ball as you slowly inhale.
 
 Complete ten side crunches or oblique crunches before switching sides.

Avoid injury and see results by keeping the following tips in mind:
 
✓ Keep the foot on your extended leg flat on the floor at all times for balance.
 
✓ Place your foot on your extended leg against a wall if you find yourself 
slipping.
 
✓ Remember to exhale as you crunch up, bringing your elbow down 
toward your knee.
 
✓ Don’t use your hand to pull your head toward your shoulder. 
Rollaways
Perhaps the second-most popular exercise for working the core area is the 
rollaway. This exercise is a great way to target your abs from the inside out.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Kneeling in front of the ball, place your hands on the ball at arm’s 
length (see Figure 9-11a).
 
2. As you contract your abdominal muscles and tuck in your butt, roll 
the ball away from you slightly so that your forearms rest on the ball 
(see Figure 9-11b).

144
Part III: Developing Core Strength Using Accessories 
 
3. Keeping your butt tucked in and your back straight, hold this move-
ment for a few seconds before you return to starting position.
 
 To increase the challenge, roll the ball away from you a little farther. 
You can also try rolling the ball slightly from side to side.
 
 Complete one set of 15 repetitions.
 
Figure 9-11: 
Rollaway.

b
Make sure you do the following to get the most out of this exercise:
 
✓ Kneel on a cushion or mat if your knees start hurting.
 
✓ Keep your back long and straight to keep it from arching.
 
✓ Simply roll the ball out and back without holding in between. Don’t hold 
the movement for a few seconds when the ball is rolled out in front of 
you, if you find this exercise too challenging. 
Abdominal curls
Doing abdominal curls with the ball places the emphasis directly on the core-
stabilizing muscles. By grasping the ball under your knees, the larger abdominal 
muscles, or outer abdominals, get used a lot more intensely during this exercise.

145
 Chapter 9: Challenging Your Core on the Ball
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lying on the floor, rest your lower legs on the ball at a 90-degree 
angle (see Figure 9-12a).
 
2. As you tighten your abdominals, grasp the ball between your legs and 
pull toward you, lifting the ball from the floor.
 
3. With your hands on either side of your head, slowly lift your shoul-
ders from the floor toward your knees (see Figure 9-12b).
 
4. Hold the lift for a few seconds, and then slowly roll your shoulders 
back to the floor.
 
 Complete ten repetitions.

Don’t forget to do the following while performing this exercise:
 
✓ Relax your neck as you curl up into a crunch.
 
✓ Don’t pull your head up with your hands to keep your head and neck in 
neutral alignment. 
 
✓ Remember to exhale as you curl up and inhale as you release back 
down.

Ball exchange
This exercise is my favorite one for training your core. It’s also good for 
teaching hand and eye coordination, as you’ll see when you start passing the 
ball back and forth between your arms and legs.
 
This is a more advanced movement and should only be done if the abs are 
strong enough to keep the back from arching when lowering the ball with 
your legs.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back, making sure your lower back is pressed down. 
Holding the ball, extend your arms and the ball directly above your 
head on the floor (see Figure 9-13a).
 
2. Raise your arms and legs up to meet at a 90-degree angle above your 
torso (as shown in Figure 9-13b).
 
3. Exchange the ball by grasping it between your legs; then bring the 
ball back down to the floor (see Figure 9-13c).

✓ Avoid arching your back.
 
✓ Remember to keep a tight grip on the ball as you pass it back and forth 
or exchange it.
Good nutritional choices and portions 
for nixing belly fat!
For faster results and to enhance your core 
training, start adding some of the following 
food choices into your everyday eating plan. Of 
course, eating right and exercising go hand in 
hand, so to start getting rid of that belly fat fast, 
try eating a variety of foods from the following 
list. You’ll see what a difference it makes in your 
waistline:
1 egg (75 calories)
1 slice whole-wheat toast (100 calories)
1 ounce cheese (100 calories)
1 apple (90 calories)
4 ounces skinless chicken breast (150 calories)
1/2 cup cooked veggies (50 calories)
1 cup green salad (100 calories)
1 cup fruit/cantaloupe (60 calories)
4 ounces salmon (175 calories)
3/4 cups pasta (200 calories)
1/2 cup cooked veggies (50 calories)
1 cup green salad (100 calories)
5 whole-wheat crackers (100 calories)
1/2 tablespoon peanut butter (50 calories)

Adding Weights for Core Strength
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing why you need to use weights to strengthen your core
▶ Understanding how to lift weights for your core
▶ Finding out the right number and sets to use with weights
▶ Choosing the right amount of weight for you
I
n this chapter I cover weight training to help strengthen your core. Which 
means, you’re going to learn how to use free weights or dumbbells to 
combine exercises to work your core — like a squat to overhead press or a 
reverse lunge using weights with a leg lift. By combining two different move-
ments, you are forced to transition the exercise through your core, so your 
core muscles become stronger and in turn, you are able to maintain good 
posture and alignment throughout the exercise. The end result is a stronger 
core that helps mimic the movements you use in everyday life while creating 
better posture and increasing stability and balance.
The best way to build strength in any part of your body is with resistance 
training — and using weights is the preferred form of resistance to use.
 
Transitioning any movement you’re doing with weights through your core 
is what builds core strength. It also helps build functional strength, which is 
what you use throughout each day to reach, bend, grab, pull, and so on.
Weight training can also help reshape your body in addition to adding 
muscle and tone to areas that perhaps are too flat (your butt), and add defi-
nition to muscles that are just too round (your arms). If any of these body 
types or scenarios sound familiar to you — not to worry! Using weights 
works — and works fast! Within a few short weeks you will begin to see 
tighter, tone muscles peeking through and legs like a racehorse appear-
ing. Well, maybe not to that extreme, but you get the point. You will see 
changes by adding a bit of muscle all over and reducing your body fat with 
weight training. So get started!

Weight Guidelines
First of all let me give you a quick overview of free weights versus dumbbells. 
Free weights or dumbbells are hand weights or weights that you hold in your 
hands (duh), that have a set weight. Whether it’s 5, 10, or 15 pounds — with 
free weights, that’s all you get. Barbells, on the other hand (no pun intended), 
have straight metal bars that you can add plate weights too or what is called 
changeable plates. Because they have changeable plates, they’re good for 
quickly adding weight to your workout on one device rather than having five 
different pairs of free weights lying around. Well, now that you’ve had a crash 
course in weights, how much weight should you actually be using? Read on 
to find out more about the perfect weight for you!
Picking the right amount of weight for you
How much weight you use makes a big difference in the effectiveness and the 
success of your workout. It’s always smart to choose an amount of weight 
that you can complete 10 to 12 repetitions with making the last two difficult, 
if not impossible, to complete. 
Importance of increasing 
repetitions and sets
Instead of increasing the amount of weight you use, to challenge your body 
and create change, you can simply increase the amount of repetitions you 
do or add another set. I usually suggest starting off with one set of ten repeti-
tions using the recommended amount of weight. That allows you to practice 
using good form and see where you’re at in terms of evaluating your level of 
difficulty. After a few weeks, you should be adding at least one more set. The 
body adapts quickly to any amount of weight you exercise with so you have 
to keep up!
Plopping Down on a Weight 
Bench or Having a Ball
This is where my bias comes in since I am the author of Exercise Balls For 
Dummies ([Wiley] I’m never one to shy away from a shameless plug!). But 
there is a really big difference between using a weight bench to lift weights 
with or choosing to sit on an exercise ball. 

151
 Chapter 10: Adding Weights for Core Strength
When you sit on an exercise ball to do biceps curls, lat raises, T-raises or 
any of the other exercises in this chapter, you engage your core! Because 
if you didn’t, you’d fall right off the ball. Now that’s what I call immediate 
biofeedback.
Put simply, because the ball is round, it requires you to work on your balance 
and stability as you work other parts of your body. I prefer using an exercise 
ball for any kind of weight training as opposed to sitting on a bench because 
sitting on a chair or bench doesn’t require you to pull in your abdominal 
muscles and engage your core. In fact, many people tend to round their 
shoulders and their back while using a weight bench. 
So the next time you’re at the gym and see one of those big round things 
lying around, try it out! Just make sure you keep your feet flat on the floor at 
all times just as if you were sitting in a chair — only better. 
Dumbbell Workout for a Flat 
Tummy and Tiny Waist
The following exercises are challenging and fun to do. Many of them involve 
doing compound movements which means they combine two exercises and 
use two major muscle groups at one time. 
Be sure to work up slowly and only do as much and as many of the exercises 
that you can do while using proper form. 
The wood chop
The wood chop is called just that because its similar to the move you use 
when you’re chopping wood. It’s the king of all core with weight-strengthen-
ing exercises and functional stretches because it works your back, butt, abs, 
and chest all at the same time. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand up tall with your feet hip-width apart and hold a weight in both 
of your hands. Bending at your waist so your upper body is parallel to 
the floor, hold the weight to the right side of your body (as shown in 
Figure 10-1a). 
 
2. Sweep your arms upward and across your body so you end up with 
your arms over your left shoulder (see Figure 10-1b). 
 
 Lift from your core and hold for a breath at the top of the movement.

152
Part III: Developing Core Strength Using Accessories 
 
3. Come back to starting position, and continue the wood chop for five 
repetitions before switching sides.
 
To protect your back and spine, your hips should move with you and not 
remain forward throughout the moves.
 
Figure 10-1: 
An example 
of how to do 
the wood 
chop.

a
Remember these tips so that you don’t take shortcuts with the wood chop:
 
✓ Inhale as you reach up and exhale as you bring your arms back down.
 
✓ Hold your abdominals tight to protect your back.
 
✓ Avoid arching or compressing your lower back.
 
✓ Keep the movement fluid and under control. Don’t swing or create too 
much momentum.
Dumbbell bent-over row
This exercise transitions the movement through your core to help strengthen 
your back. You’ll want to be sure to tighten your abdominals before perform-
ing this movement with your weight to protect your lower back. 

153
 Chapter 10: Adding Weights for Core Strength
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Holding your weight in your left hand, place your right foot in front of 
your left, bend at the waist so your upper body is parallel to the floor 
(see Figure 10-2a).
 
2. Pull the dumbbell toward your chest until your elbow is past your rib-
cage and squeeze your shoulder blade back toward your spine so the 
muscles in your upper back are contracted (as shown in Figure 10-2b). 
 
3. Lower your weight back down to starting position before continuing 
the next repetition. 
 
 Repeat for five repetitions before switching sides.

Here’s what you should remember for this exercise: 
 
✓ Contract your abs throughout the exercise to engage your core and pro-
tect your back.
 
✓ Make sure your knees are bent slightly and not locked.
 
✓ Avoid lifting the weight past your waist.

Crunches with weights 
This is your standard abdominal crunch but with added weight for additional 
strengthening of the core muscles. It can be challenging so start out slowly…
 
1. Lie on your back and place your legs slightly wider than shoulder 
width apart. Hold weights in both your hands in front of your chest 
(as seen in Figure 10-3a). 
 
2. Contract your stomach muscles before bringing your shoulders and 
upper body off the floor and toward your knees (as shown in Figure 
10-3b).
 
3. Slowly return your back down to the floor before starting the next 
repetition.
When doing crunches with weights, you get the most effective workout by 
remembering to: 
 
✓ Hold the position for a moment before returning back down to the floor.
Do’s and don’ts of beating stress…
Exercise can cut your stress level in half and 
lower your blood pressure, which isn’t a bad 
combination. Here are a few tips you can use 
to help you get back on track or just to encour-
age you to slow down a little:
 ✓ Do yoga, Pilates, or take the time to stretch 
to ease your body of aches and rid you of 
tension. Plus, it may even help you take a 
few much-needed breaths.
 ✓ Do something you love everyday. Whether 
it’s biking, walking, playing with the kids, 
being active while doing something you 
love is the best stress reducer of all. 
 ✓ Do realize that stress is cumulative . . . and 
reevaluating where you are in your life and 
making small changes along the way can 
really make a difference that shows up on 
a daily basis. 
 ✓ Do think about working from home like 
me! With all the technology, most people 
can control their schedules and work from 
home nowadays. Taking on less of a work 
load, delegating chores to a relative or 
family member, or even moving to a smaller, 
tight-knit community may help you get back 
the simplicity you need in life to maintain a 
good, long, healthy life.
 ✓ Don’t stress about stressing! Everybody 
is pretty much in the same boat when it 
comes to worrying about the everyday 
mundane things like work and paying bills. 
Be thankful for the things you do have and 
try not to worry about the things you don’t!

 Chapter 10: Adding Weights for Core Strength
 
✓ Squeeze the weights into your chest to help keep them steady through-
out the crunch.
 
✓ Avoid allowing the bottom of your feet to come off the floor.

Dead lifts
This exercises strengthens the lower back and entire core as well as the legs. 
You will feel this exercise in your lower body also from the additional weight 
you’ll be using as you lift up through your core. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Taking a shoulder-wide stance, start with the weights on the floor in 
front of you. 
 
2. Squat down to pick the weights up in front of you on the floor, being 
sure to keep a straight back (see Figure 10-4a).
 
3. Press through your heels to come back to standing position keeping 
your arms straight down at your sides and elbows straight. Pull your 

156
Part III: Developing Core Strength Using Accessories 
shoulders back by squeezing your shoulder blades together as you 
come back to starting position (see Figure 10-4b).
 
Figure 10-4: 
Dead lifts.

To keep from killing yourself, use the following tips on proper form while 
doing dead lifts:
 
✓ Grip the weights using palms facing down or using an overhand grip.
 
✓ Keep your arms straight throughout this exercise.
 
✓ Keep a straight back during this exercise and chin up! Don’t let your 
back round.
T-Raises 
This exercise requires you to lift your arms while holding weights straight 
up directly through the core of your body. It’s great for arms, shoulders, and 
upper back as well.

157
 Chapter 10: Adding Weights for Core Strength
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Standing tall and holding weights down at your sides, slowly raise 
your weights until they are straight out in front of you at chest level 
(as shown in Figure 10-5a).
 
2. Then like an airplane or a “T,” move arms out to either side of your 
body (see Figure 10-5b). 
 
3. Return to starting position by bringing your arms back in to your 
chest using your “T” shape, before lowering your weights back down 
to your sides. 
 
Figure 10-5: 
T-raises.
 
b

While doing this exercise, remember these important tips:
 
✓ Keep your back straight during this exercise.
 
✓ Exhale as you lift the weights through your core to chest level and 
exhale as you lower back down to starting position.

158
Part III: Developing Core Strength Using Accessories 
Squat to overhead press
Combining two powerful movements or compound exercises is the way to go 
to strengthen your core with weights. This is a good overall upper and lower 
body exercise combining the squat and the overhead press. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Starting with feet hip width apart and holding your dumbbells, bend 
your knees and squat down as if you were going to sit in a chair until 
your thighs are parallel with the floor (see Figure 10-6a). 
 
2. Holding your weights in your hands at head level and even with your 
shoulders, press your weights upward until your elbows are straight-
ened but not locked at the top of the movement (see Figure 10-6b). 
 
3. Release your arms back down to shoulder level as you stand back up 
straight to starting position. 
 
4. Repeat the movement in unison ten more times. 
 
Try to do the squat press movement slow and controlled to increase the tight-
ening of your core muscles.

Remember these tips while doing this exercise: 
 
✓ Press your weights straight upwards during this exercise.
 
✓ Keep your back straight and stand tall. Don’t lean forward.
Reverse lunges with weights
This reverse lunge with an added leg lift is done while you are holding 
weights. It’s a great butt and back strengthener along with giving you killer 
abs from the extra knee lift. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Holding your weights at waist level with palms facing each other, 
stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Step or lunge back with 
your right leg bending your left knee at a 90-degree angle (as shown 
in Figure 10-7a).
 
2. Holding your weights tightly at your waist, push through and straight 
up with your right knee as you contract your butt muscles on the left 
side of your body (see Figure 10-7b).

3. Hold the knee raise for a few seconds before returning your leg 
behind you to starting position. 
Maintain proper form by following these tips:
 
✓ Keep a straight back and not an arched one.
 
✓ Make sure you hold for a few seconds as you raise your knee.
 
✓ Pull your abs in tight and contract your butt muscles before doing this 
exercise.
Ab Central Machines
Ever go into the gym and see lots of ways to do a crunch except the old-
fashioned way — on the floor? Ab machines are popular and are mostly made 
to stave off boredom because let’s face it, doing crunches can get a little 
boring and a little difficult! Read on to find other ways to work your core that 
may add a little spice to your regular routine!
Ab roller
Looks like something that should be part of a jungle gym or at the very least 
something your kids might enjoy playing with, the ab roller is the half-dome-
looking piece of equipment that you lie under on your back as you put your 
head on a little foam cushion for support. The movement is you rock forward 
as it helps you lift your shoulders off the ground, and it guides your spine 
through the natural curved movement when lifting. Definitely for beginners 
as it helps you take baby steps to getting an actual core workout or complet-
ing an abdominal crunch!
Ab board
With an ab board, it feels like your head is going to touch the ground because 
you are lying on your back with your legs above your hips and head as you 
tuck your feet under a roller. Great for sit-ups, crunches, and all abdominal 
exercises, the ab board provides you with a killer core workout and is a good 
piece of equipment to use if you already have a lot of core strength. 
Because you are not just lying on your back on a flat surface but are at a 
45-degree angle on an ab board, you are increasing the range of motion that 
you use to perform sit-ups, increasing the intensity of the exercise. 

161
 Chapter 10: Adding Weights for Core Strength
Ab wheel . . . yikes!
Inexpensive, yes. Convenient, oh yes. Easy to use? Forget it! The ab wheel 
really requires core strength along with balance and control to be able to use 
it. Picture this, starting with the wheel at your feet and your legs straight but 
hips up in the air (think downward dog in yoga), roll the wheel out until you 
are in pushup position. May sound easy but you have to control the move-
ment or the wheel will take right off from under you and you’ll be needing a 
new nose when it hits the floor. You can also use the ab wheel from a kneel-
ing position instead of from a standing position but it is still a very advanced 
move. Again, the key word here is control and not many of us have what it 
takes to train with an ab wheel. Definitely something to work up to slowly.
Why build muscle to burn fat?
Using different forms of resistance, such as 
free weights and barbells, to reduce overall 
body fat by building muscle is the hottest and 
latest trend. Usually weights are incorporated 
as part of a circuit training program or added to 
some form of cardio training to be most effec-
tive. Using weights can help tone, add defini-
tion, and help reshape your body faster than 
any other form of exercise alone. 
Here are a few of the many benefits you get 
from building muscle with resistance training:
 ✓ You burn 30 to 50 calories more per day at 
rest for each pound of muscle you put on. 
Imagine what that can do for you if you’re 
active.
 ✓ Building bigger muscles boosts your meta-
bolic rate (the rate at which you burn calo-
ries) and reduces overall body fat. 
 ✓ Lean body mass burns more calories than 
fat does. So if you have more muscle, you 
can burn more calories while you sleep.
 ✓ It improves your posture as a result of 
strengthening and enhancing your back 
muscles, which help develop a strong 
spine.
 ✓ It increases your strength and muscle mass, 
which reduces the risk of osteoporosis due 
to the increase in bone density through 
weight training. 
 ✓ It protects your joints and muscles from 
deterioration.
 ✓ It strengthens the connective tissue within 
your body
To burn the most amount of calories in the short-
est amount of time, you need to work the larger 
muscle groups in your body. Next time you’re 
doing a workout, try a few of these compound 
exercises rather than exercises that target indi-
vidual muscles (as seen in this chapter):
 ✓ Squats
 ✓ Lat pulls
 ✓ Chest presses 
These exercises are great examples of ways to 
burn the most calories in the shortest amount 
of time.

Part IV
Adding Variety to 
Your Core Routine

In this part . . .
Y
ou will discover that no matter what principle of 
training you use, every technique uses core exer-
cises to strengthen the body. Chapter 11 focuses on 
Pilates and the various exercises developed by Joseph 
Pilates himself that use core strength. Chapter 12 contains 
some of my favorite yoga exercises that you can do to 
develop a strong core with yoga poses — and help you 
relax a little bit and breathe a little slower.
Chapter 13 shows you how to use your own body weight 
as resistance for training and strengthening your core, like 
when you do a push-up or a triceps dip. It also shows you 
how to train with weights for your arms, back, butt, and 
legs as you carry your core along with you throughout the 
exercises.
Finally, Chapter 14 introduces a stretching routine 
designed to help you strengthen and stretch your core at 
the same time. I also address flexibility issues and the 
importance of stretchiness as you learn some fantastic 
stretches you can do to lengthen and lean out your 
midsection.

Chapter 11
Pilates Core Program 
In This Chapter
▶ Practicing Pilates’ principles
▶ Knowing why Pilates is a powerful core strengthener 
▶ Getting ready for your Pilates core workout
▶ Combining diaphragmatic breathing with core exercises
O
ne of the best fitness techniques that you can use on your body is 
Pilates. In fact, adapting the Pilates method for core training is a must 
as all Pilates movements that I know of originate in your core. There are so 
many ways that Pilates and core training go hand in hand to help strengthen 
the core. Check out a few of the examples below of how the exercises in this 
chapter are enhanced by using the Pilates method:
 
✓ Pilates encourages working the core by using the entire torso of the 
body in all of its exercises.
 
✓ Pilates is based in physiology and was created for reforming injuries by 
increasing core strength where all movements come from.
 
✓ Pilates uses the deep stabilizing muscles of your body to achieve bal-
ance and posture.
In this chapter, I give you some killer core exercise that will challenge you 
physically and even encourage you to breathe the Pilates way.
Getting Primed on the 
Principles of Pilates
 
Pilates is a mind and body experience. It’s not just a way to get in shape or 
reform injuries; it also creates a real awareness of how your body works and 
where all your movements originate. The mindset you have when practicing 
Pilates is similar to the mindset of someone who’s practicing martial arts. 
First, you must grasp the pebble from my hand, grasshopper. What I mean is 

166
Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
that, in martial arts, you must first have the knowledge of the how and why 
to defend yourself before you go out and apply it. In Pilates, you must first 
understand the principles, or what you’re trying to accomplish, before you 
do the exercises.
The Pilates method, just like yoga (see Chapter 12), has some basic prin-
ciples. Here are the eight principles written by Joseph Pilates, the creator of 
Pilates, to help you perform his exercises as they were intended:
 
✓ Breathing: The best way to remember this principle is to exhale with 
effort. Using deep, diaphragmatic breathing (or breathing into your 
ribcage) allows you to create the proper flow and precision of each 
movement.
 
✓ Range of motion: This principle is basically flexibility, or how tight or 
loose your muscles are. Your range of motion affects your ability to 
stretch and extend, which are important to the Pilates method. People 
who have a limited range of motion will grow and benefit greatly from 
practicing Pilates.
 
✓ Centering: For this principle, you pull in your stomach muscles and 
engage your core, working from your center for every movement. 
Centering is the basis for all Pilates work and for using the ball because 
the ball is an unstable base. Pulling your navel in toward your spine 
means “sucking it in.”
 
✓ Controlling: In this principle, you control your body’s movements — 
each and every one of them. You know where everything is at all times. 
Having control of your body’s movements creates body awareness that 
can enhance everything you do in life, from carrying a baby to stepping 
up on a ladder.
 
✓ Stability: For this principle, you want to stabilize your movements, or 
keep one body part still while another one is working. Stabilizing your 
lower back and not lifting your hips while you’re lifting your legs is a 
good example of stability.
 
✓ Flowing: For this principle, you move freely through the movements, 
going from one to the next. The Pilates method has a real “dance” feel to 
it; you move smoothly through each exercise and finish with control.
 
✓ Precision: For this principle, you want to know where all your move-
ments are coming from at all times. Being precise in each movement and 
being able to place your body and each limb where you would like it to 
be and where you would like it to end. Everything counts in Pilates and, 
for that reason, it takes a lot of focus and control to master it.
 
✓ Opposition: This principle is best described as working parts of your 
body in opposition to each other. Pressing your shoulders down while 
raising your arms or opening up your chest while bending at your waist 
are good examples of working in opposition.

167
 Chapter 11: Pilates Core Program
Putting all these principles together goes something like this: Teach your 
body to flow through movements with precision and control, working your 
body parts in opposition as you breathe through your limited range of motion 
and center yourself as you stabilize.
Using Pilates for Core Training
You get the following amazing benefits when you combine the Pilates method 
with specific core training:
 
✓ You’ll get challenging exercises that require small movements and strength.
 
✓ You’ll learn how to do Pilates mat exercises that don’t require you to 
use a Pilates machine known as a reformer. 
 
✓ You’ll develop good muscle tone for your entire body because you’re 
recruiting major muscle groups, which provides overall toning.
 
✓ You’ll improve your flexibility.
 
✓ You’ll gain better posture and improve your balance by breathing and 
holding yourself steady with Pilates exercises. 
 
✓ You strengthen your body’s core and the deeper abdominal muscles 
with Pilates exercises that other pieces of fitness equipment can’t reach.
 
✓ You can adapt it to your own level of fitness by keeping either your 
upper body or lower body on the floor until you’re ready to engage both 
by using your core strength.
 
✓ You’ll elevate your heart rate with Pilates exercise because they require 
great strength and stamina.
Combining the principles and benefits of these two powerhouse forms of 
exercise can greatly improve your body’s health. As with anything that’s 
paired as a team, the results can be twice as good and twice as rewarding!
Hitting the mat first
The art of Pilates has spread to athletes of all 
kinds along with professional dancers and just 
about everybody in between. In fact, anyone 
who wants to create long, lean muscles and 
correct postural alignment problems is doing 
himself a great service practicing Pilates. You 
can perform these exercises on an exercise 
mat (hence, the term mat classes), and you can 
use the mat exercises on the reformer.
To truly discover the who, what, where, when, 
and why of proper placement, I recommend 
learning Pilates mat exercises first before 
adding any equipment.

168
Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
Preparing for Core Training 
the Pilates Way
You need a few things before you can do the Pilates exercises in this chapter. 
In this section, you find a list of the items you need and what you can do to 
make your workout go more smoothly.
 
You also discover how to find the neutral spine position that you need to use 
for every Pilates exercise. Make sure you take the time to try this position 
before you begin your workout.
Getting the Pilates stuff you need
Make sure that you have the following equipment for your Pilates-based core 
exercises:
 
✓ Exercise mat: You need an exercise mat to do the Pilates exercises in this 
chapter. An exercise mat allows you to kneel or lie on the floor so you can 
do the exercises more comfortably. You can use a yoga mat or you can try 
a small slip-resistant rug.
 
✓ Comfortable clothing that’s somewhat fitted: You don’t want your cloth-
ing to be too loose because it can inhibit your movements. The same goes 
for long hair, so be sure to pull it back before you begin your workout.
 
 Wearing something that allows you to see your stomach or abdominal 
muscles while working out is also a good idea so you can see whether 
you’re breathing properly and keeping your ribcage open.
 
✓ Work-out space: Make sure that you work out in a space that has enough 
room for you to move and swing your arms and legs freely. You’ll be lying 
on the floor quite a bit so make sure its clean and free of debris!
 
✓ Water: Staying hydrated is vital to your workout. It helps you recharge 
and keeps you from building up lactic acid in your muscles. Lactic acid 
is what makes you sore at the end of an intense workout. Keep a water 
bottle handy so you can sip it throughout your exercise session — it’ll 
provide you with better stamina so you can last longer.
 
✓ Doctor’s approval: As with any new workout, consulting your physician 
before you begin a new workout is important. If at any time during this 
workout you feel any pain, stop what you’re doing and rest quietly on 
your mat or stretch yourself out. A good rule when exercising is, “if in 
doubt, leave it out!”

169
 Chapter 11: Pilates Core Program
 
✓ Bare feet: Leave your shoes and socks off for these exercises, but save 
them for when you’re using weights or doing cardio exercises. Because 
you need to grip the floor with your feet, going barefoot for this work-
out is best.
Unveiling the path to a neutral spine
 
One of the principle factors in practicing Pilates is neutral spine. The ultimate 
goal in trying to achieve a neutral spine is to keep the natural curve of your 
spine without overcorrecting it.
In other words, you want to stabilize your back, your hipbones, and your 
pelvis so they’re on the same plane.
To try neutral spine and to see whether you’re maintaining that natural curve 
in your spine, do the following:
 
1. Lie with your back and feet flat on the floor and your knees bent at a 
90-degree angle.
 
2. Flatten your lower back by pressing it into the floor.
 
 Now you can feel the difference between neutral spine and a flat back.
 
3. Arch your back slightly by lifting your hips up.
 
 Now you can feel the differences between an arched back, a flat back, 
and the natural curve in your spine (or neutral spine).
If you were standing, your pelvis would drop straight down. The proper way 
to describe a neutral spine while standing up would be neither arched nor 
tilted forward. Just as your car has a neutral position in which it doesn’t 
move forward or backward, the same goes for a neutral spine.
Breathing the Pilates way
Breathing requires very specific attention in Pilates. Pilates demands deep dia-
phragmatic breathing done by expanding your ribcage (and belly) then letting 
it close as you exhale. Breathing by expansion of the ribcage is predominantly 
caused by the intercostals. The diaphragm basically depresses the floor of the 
thorax causing the belly to expand. By placing your hand on your belly, you 
can become more aware of the area you’re using to breathe with the Pilates 
method. Below is a breathing exercise you can practice before beginning your 
workout so you can get the most out of doing the following exercises.
 
Use your hand to feel your abdomen and ribcage rise and fall.

170
Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
To properly breathe the Pilates way, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back and bend your knees, keeping your feet flat on the 
floor.
 
 Your legs should be hip-distance apart.
 
2. Rest one hand on your belly and one hand on your ribcage.
 
3. Take a deep breath, allowing your ribcage and to rise as your belly 
fills with air.
 
4. Exhale, making sure that all the air leaves your belly and your ribcage 
moves back together.
 
5. Repeat immediately after your exhale.
 
 Inhale to the count of ten and exhale to the count of ten for several breaths.
While you’re doing your Pilates breathing:
 
✓ Keep your back pressed into the floor so you can feel your ribcage 
expand.
 
✓ Inhale through your nose.
 
✓ Keep your feet flat on the floor so you can see your ribcage expand on 
each inhale.
Trying Out Beginner Pilates Core Care
This series of exercises incorporates the breathing technique I show you in 
this chapter to help you create body awareness and get you through this 
workout. And of course, breathing is one of the eight Pilates principles.
The plank and the bridge are modified Pilates exercises that require stamina 
and balance. And even a few more of your Pilates principles, such as centering 
and opposition, appear here.
 
You should perform these exercises in the following order to allow your chest 
to open up before you release your back.
Pilates bridge
The Pilates bridge is a variation of the classic bridge position that Chapter 
9 illustrates. This version is more difficult because you have to lift your hips 
higher while stabilizing your core.

171
 Chapter 11: Pilates Core Program
 
You need to incorporate your core muscles (remember, from your ribcage to 
your hips) or stabilizers to help you maintain the strength in your lower back 
and lift in your hips throughout this exercise.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Take 
a deep breath in as you squeeze your butt and lift your hips up off the 
floor (see Figure 11-1a).
 
 Your arms will be straight and alongside your body.
 
2. Exhale as you lift your hips high enough to make a straight line with 
your body from your shoulders to your knees. Make sure you can see 
the tops of your knees (as Figure 11-1b shows).
 
Figure 11-1:

 Be sure not to place any strain on your neck by lifting too high. Lift up 
only as high as hip level.
 
3. Hold for a few seconds using the support of your arms and your 
breathing to help you maintain the position.
 
4. Exhale as you slowly roll your spine back down onto the floor one 
vertebra at a time.

172
Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
 
 Complete five to ten repetitions, depending on your individual fitness 
level.
When doing the Pilates bridge, remember to:
 
✓ Inhale as you lift up your hips.
 
✓ Keep your eyes cast toward the ceiling to help you keep your neck 
straight during the lift.
 
✓ Remain relaxed and think of using your breath to help you through this 
exercise. Don’t let your shoulders tense up.
The plank
The plank position works your core muscles while it also works your upper 
body. It strengthens and lengthens your body by activating your stabilizing 
muscles and this exercise is done just how it sounds: keeping your body 
straight in a plank position, just like a plank of wood.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. With your hands pressed down and your fingers facing forward, place 
your hands shoulder-width apart on the floor in front of you and your 
legs straight behind you (see Figure 11-2a).
 
Your arms will be straight underneath your shoulders.
 
2. Exhale as you slowly lift your body off the floor, contracting your 
abdominals until your arms and elbows are straight (see Figure 
11-2b).
 
 You need to contract your chest muscles and engage your upper body 
for additional support.
 
3. Hold this position for a few seconds before lowering your body slowly 
back down to the floor.
 
 Complete five to ten repetitions, depending on your individual fitness level.
To get the most out of the plank, you need to:
 
✓ Press into the floor and squeeze you glutes while you’re in the plank 
position.
 
✓ Keep your neck in line with your spine as you do when you’re standing.
 
✓ Keep your back straight and long — don’t let your back arch or sag.

Roll downs
The roll down exercise is just as it sounds. Using a slow and controlled move-
ment, you roll your torso and upper back down to the floor and then back up. 
This exercise helps you develop strong abdominal and lower back muscles, 
which help you maintain a strong and healthy core.
 
Using an exercise mat will make your back more comfortable during this 
exercise.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Sit up tall with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Imagine a string 
is lifting you up from the top of your head and is attached to the ceiling.
 
2. Pulling your belly button in toward your spine to activate your 
abdominal muscles, extend your arms straight out in front of you (as 
Figure 11-3a shows).
 
3. Slowly roll your spine down toward the floor one vertebra at a time, 
making a “C” shape with your lower back (see Figure 11-3b).
 
4. Roll all the way down until you are lying flat on the floor and your 
arms are at your sides.

174
Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
 
5. Slowly roll yourself back up into starting position using your core 
muscles. 
 
 Complete five repetitions.

Get results with roll downs by remembering to:
 
✓ Use a slow and controlled movement when rolling your spine down to 
the floor.
 
✓ Use your breath to help you focus on holding your position.
 
✓ Keep your arms extended out in front of you as you roll down.
Swimming
This exercise trains your back and entire core to work together while at the 
same time strengthening your abdominals. Remember, keeping your back 
strong and flexible and your abdominals tight and strong is the best preven-
tion against low back problems.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:

175
 Chapter 11: Pilates Core Program
 
1. Lie flat on your belly on a mat or the floor with your arms stretched 
out in front of you and your legs stretched out behind you (as shown 
in Figure 11-4a).
 
2. Pulling your belly button in, simultaneously lift your upper back and 
head off the floor along with your right arm and left leg.
 
3. Switch arms and legs and begin swimming as you alternate your arms 
and legs (see Figure 11-4b).
 
 Imagine that strings are attached to your hand and foot and that the 
strings are gently pulling your arm and leg away from each other, not 
up. You want to get the lengthening in your abdominal muscles and your 
spine, not shortening or compressing it.
 
4. Squeeze your butt muscles and swim continuously for 24 strokes or beats.
 
 Lower your arms and legs and return to the floor.

While doing this exercise:
 
✓ Keep your abdominals tight. Lax abdominals may place undue stress on 
your lower back muscles.
 
✓ Avoid arching your back.
 
✓ Make sure that you don’t lift your pubic bone up off the mat.

The hundred
One of the most common Pilates exercises, the hundred is a real core 
strengthener. Because you’re lifting your head and shoulders off the floor as 
you squeeze your inner thighs together, you’re engaging both the upper and 
lower abdominal core area. Great exercise!
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees up in the air forming a 90-degree 
angle with your hips. Squeeze your inner thighs together in a “tabletop” 
position.
 
2. Maintaining neutral spine, place your arms straight alongside your 
body and just off the floor with palms facing down (see Figure 11-5a).
 
3. Lift your head and shoulder blades until they are just off the mat.
 
4. Inhale slowly and pulse your arms just above floor level for five beats 
then exhale slowly and pulse your arms for five beats, making up ten 
beats all together (see Figure 11-5b).

The 
hundred.

 Chapter 11: Pilates Core Program
 
 Slowly roll back down to the mat and repeat ten times to make a total 
of a “hundred” beats.
Here’s what you can’t forget about the hundred:
 
✓ Use your abs to hold you up and not your neck to avoid straining your 
neck muscles. 
 
✓ Put one hand behind your neck halfway through this exercise at 50 beats 
if the strain on your neck becomes too much.
 
✓ Keep your shoulder blades back and down — don’t let them rise up.
Single-leg stretch 
The single-leg stretch is a wonderful core Pilates exercise to teach you how 
to stabilize your spine while working your abs and back. It’s almost like doing 
a bicycle crunch except it’s done more slowly and it calls upon your core 
strength to pull each knee in toward you and hold.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Sit up tall on the floor with your feet flat and knees bent. Slowly roll 
down as you pull one knee into your chest and straighten the other 
leg out at a 45-degree angle to the floor (as shown is Figure 11-6a).
 
 Your shoulder blades will remain off the floor to engage your core.
 
2. Hold your bent knee gently with both hands and switch legs two times 
on one inhale and two times on one exhale (see Figure 11-6b).
 
 Repeat for eight total breaths in all.
When you do the single leg stretch:
 
✓ Lift your head high enough to engage your abs and not strain your neck.
 
✓ Keep your belly button pulled into your spine as you exhale.
 
✓ Inhale for two beats and exhale for two beats emphasizing proper 
Pilates breathing.

Rising swan
This exercise strengthens your back and butt along with stretching out your 
abdominals. I love to do this exercise as part of my cooldown and finish by 
pressing back on my heels and resting my upper body on them for support in 
child’s pose or resting position.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie down on your belly with your forearms on the mat supporting 
your upper back. Keep your arms at your sides in a sphinx pose (as 
shown in Figure 11-7a).
 
2. Slowly rise up higher with your upper back, gently lifting your head 
and straightening your arms by pressing your hands into the mat (see 
Figure 11-7b).
 
3. Hold this position for a few seconds before lowering back down to 
the floor.
Rise to the challenge by making sure that you:
 
✓ Pull your belly button in and squeeze your butt muscles.
 
✓ Lift only as high as is comfortable to you to avoid placing any undo 
stress on your lower back — don’t lift too high.

Side kicks
This exercises targets the core by using a movement that comes directly 
from the abdominals and back. It also helps you with stability, as you have to 
keep your body steady as you move your legs freely.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your side with your legs stretched out and a little bit in front of 
your body (see Figure 11-8a).
 
2. Prop your head up on your elbow and place your front arm palm 
down on the floor in front of you.
 
3. Flex your foot as you kick your top leg out in front of you pulsing it 
once before switching directions and swinging it behind you (see 
Figure 11-8b).
 
4. Complete ten repetitions on each side.
Keep these tips in mind while doing side kicks:
 
✓ Press your weight into the front of your palm to help keep your torso 
steady and maintain balance.
 
✓ Keep your neck relaxed and long.

What is the Pilates method?
Joseph Pilates, creator of the Pilates method, 
was born in 1881 and died in 1967. He was an 
accomplished circus performer, gymnast, and a 
notable boxer. Having many injuries from all the 
activities that he had participated in, Joseph 
Pilates came up with a series of exercises to 
overcome them. After perfecting these exer-
cises that worked for him in rehabilitating his 
injuries, he wanted to pass this series of exer-
cises onto ailing patients so they could recover, 
too, so he made crude pieces of equipment out 
of springs and pulleys to use with hospital beds. 
The result was that patients could get physical 
rehabilitation and work out while lying in bed. 
Genius!
Fast-forward many years later when Joseph 
Pilates turned these crude machines into 
what’s now known as the Pilates reformer, or 
the Pilates bed, which can be used with more 
than 100 exercises devised by Joseph Pilates 
known as the Pilates method. The fact that the 
Pilates method today actually grew out of its 
roots and remained true to what it was created 
for is amazing. And, boy, is it ever still around 
today!

Yoga Core
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing the benefits of doing yoga
▶ Stretching your core with yoga exercises
▶ Getting the best workout for your abs and back with yoga poses
▶ Loosening up your body through breathing the yoga way
I
n recent years, yoga has become mainstream and is now practiced by 
yogis, weekend warriors, and you guessed it — even regular folks! And 
that is because people have discovered that yoga is a real workout — not just 
a few simple stretches or strength poses . . . no, it actually is a workout that 
will kick your butt!
In this chapter, I demonstrate some classic yoga poses that will prepare 
your core for any yoga class you walk into. As the following yoga poses 
demonstrate, you have to possess great core strength along with a strong 
upper body to maintain the following exercises (or as they’re called in yoga, 
“poses”). The downward dog and the sun salutation, both shown in this 
chapter, are just a few examples of poses that will challenge your body and 
your mind. 
 
Doing yoga poses is very challenging so you’re not alone if you want to rest in 
some of the poses, and that’s what child’s pose is for. So relax when you need 
to during the following workouts, and take your time stretching back in child’s 
pose to take a break when you need to. 
Benefits of Doing Yoga
It’s true, you’ll need to be flexible to practice yoga but it’s a bit of a catch-
22. Yoga can give you the strength that you need to be flexible, but because 
everybody’s range of motion differs due to different degrees of elasticity in 
each individual’s joints, some people will be able to stretch like a rubber 
band, whereas others might have a hard time touching their toes (that’s right 
men, I’m talking to you!). 

182
Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
The goal of all these yoga poses is to help extend your range of motion, 
which helps strengthen your core so that all the activities you do throughout 
the day become easier and maybe even — dare I say — effortless. 
So whatever group you fall into, the flexible group or the inflexible group 
(men), here is a list of benefits you’ll get from doing yoga and how yoga can 
help build strength and flexibility:
 
✓ Yoga helps relieve lower back pain by elongating the key muscles 
that control the pelvic and back area, such as the hamstrings, lumbar 
muscles, hip flexors, and glutes.
 
✓ Yoga poses heat up the core muscles of your body, which makes 
performing all movements easier throughout the day.
 
✓ Yoga helps you expend less energy during the day because of increased 
flexibility, which results in all your movements being made easier.
 
✓ Yoga reduces stress by increasing the blood supply to tight, tense muscles.
 
✓ Yoga gives you better posture by realigning and strengthening the 
muscles that support coordination and movement.
 
✓ Yoga reduces injuries by helping you gain better control over your 
body’s movements.
 
You can do the yoga poses in this chapter before you begin your day or even 
before you begin your regular workout. They will not only get your circula-
tion going, but also will help you gain some strength and inner peace before 
you begin your day. 
Taking It Slowly and Breathing
Breathing is one of the fundamental principles of practicing yoga. And it’s 
also one of the fundamental principles in life — we all need to breathe! Once 
you understand that the breath you take is literally your neighbor’s — (in 
some shape or form) then you can begin to understand the mindset of yoga 
practitioners . . . everyone is connected through their breath. 
It’s true, breathing through a yoga pose helps you through the exercise but 
it also connects everyone to each other as they breathe the same air and 
exchange atoms floating through the air. Breathing takes on a much bigger 
meaning in yoga because it becomes a life force, or something you need to 
exist and connect you to all of humanity and the world around us. 
As you do the poses in this chapter, breathe in slowly through your nose as 
you feel the air hit the back of your throat. As you exhale, let the breath out 
through your mouth and release all the tension from the pose to help clear 
your mind for the next one. 

183
 Chapter 12: Yoga Core 
To test this theory, try holding your breath during one of the yoga poses in 
this chapter and see how difficult it is to do (but not too long or you’ll pass 
out!). Breathing is a life force, and in yoga it’s used to enhance your workout 
and increase your flexibility. So just breathe!
Strong Core Poses
In the following yoga poses, I suggest taking it easy and working up slowly. I 
always suggest trying each pose lightly first before trying to fully execute it to 
its fullest capacity. Never push or strain, especially in yoga, because it’s not 
about competing or pushing yourself to the limit; instead, yoga is about feel-
ing the movement and energy in your core and throughout your body so you 
can stay in touch with what body part you’re actually working.
Feel free to mix and match the following poses any way you like. However, in 
yoga they do follow a specific order and I’ve written them that way here in 
this chapter. I find that doing them in the following order works best because 
you get your blood flowing first before you jump into a full-body workout.
 
For the following yoga sequence, use an exercise mat or yoga mat to help you 
grip the floor with your toes and cushion your knees for comfort.
Flowing through your core movements
When you bend your body in different ways, you 
gain the ability to work entirely different muscle 
groups. When you stretch muscles in opposi-
tion, you strengthen them and improve flexibility 
at the same time. The technical terms for all the 
bending you’ll be doing are flexion, extension, 
abduction, and adduction. 
The following is a short explanation of what it’s 
called when you’re bending every which way 
in yoga: 
 ✓ Flexion is bending, or decreasing the angle, 
at the joint. Flexing your knee toward your 
butt is a good example of knee flexion.
 ✓ Extension means straightening, or increas-
ing the angle, at the joint as you would do 
when you are straightening your knee. 
 ✓ Abduction and adduction also work in 
opposition to each other and are terms best 
described as working your arms or legs 
toward the body or away from it. If you bring 
your legs or arms toward the center line of 
your body you’re adducting them. If you take 
your arms and move them away from the 
center of your body, you’re abducting them.
Whichever way you happen to be bending, 
using slow, controlled movements gives you the 
best results and helps you achieve strength and 
flexibility at the same time.

Downward dog
Ever watch your dog wake up and stretch his body out with his paws 
extended in front of him with his butt in the air? You guessed it, that’s where 
the name of this pose comes from. The downward-facing dog energizes your 
entire body because your head is lower than your heart, fueling fresh blood 
to your brain. It also works the entire back by stretching out your spine and 
requires great ab and hip strength to support the movement.
To do this pose, follow these easy steps:
 
1. Start on your hands and knees, making sure your hands are directly 
beneath your shoulders and your knees are directly under your hips.
 
 Spread your palms out wide on the floor.
 
2. Exhale as you lift and straighten your arms and raise your hips up 
behind you and toward the ceiling. Straighten your legs but don’t lock 
your knees as you let your head fall down between your arms, lining 
up your ears with your arms (shown in Figure 12-1). 
 
3. Breathe as you press your heels toward the floor and your head 
toward your feet. 
 
 Hold the movement for a few seconds before you release back down to 
your hands and knees. 
 
Figure 12-1: 
Downward 
dog.
 

185
 Chapter 12: Yoga Core 
While doing this pose, remember to:
 
✓ Allow your head and neck to relax toward the floor by casting your eyes 
downward.
 
✓ Exhale with effort as you relax your body and stretch toward the floor.
 
✓ Press your heels as far as you can toward the floor. Don’t let your heels 
come off the floor.
Plank
The plank position works your core muscles while it also works your upper 
body. It strengthens and lengthens your body by activating your stabilizing 
muscles. 
In yoga, the plank is done as part of a series of poses called the sun salutation, 
which I cover in the following exercises. Keeping your body straight in a plank 
position — just like a plank of wood — is the perfect core pose for any yoga 
practice. 
To do this pose, follow these steps:
 
1. With your hands pressed down and your fingers facing forward, place 
your hands shoulder-width apart on the floor in front of you and your 
legs straight behind you (as Figure 12-2a shows).
 
 Your arms will be straight underneath your shoulders.
 
2. Exhale as you slowly lift your body off the floor, contracting your 
abdominals until your arms and elbows are straight (see Figure 12-2b).
 
 Breathe as you contract your abdominal muscles and engage your upper 
body for additional support.
 
3. Hold this position for a few seconds before lowering your body slowly 
back down to the floor.
 
 Complete five to ten times, depending on your individual fitness level.
While practicing the plank, be sure to:
 
✓ Press into the floor and squeeze your glutes while you’re in the plank 
position.
 
✓ Keep your neck in line with your spine as you do when you’re standing.
 
✓ Keep your back straight and long. Don’t let your back arch or sag to the 
floor.

Cobra
The abs, back, and shoulders are targeted in the cobra pose. The cobra pose 
also stimulates the internal organs like the kidneys and liver in your lower 
back area to help them function better. 
To do this pose, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on the floor with your stomach down as you place your forearms 
flat on the floor. Let your forehead rest on the floor also.
 
2. Inhale as you tighten your back and abdominal muscles pressing your 
forearms against the floor to raise your chest and head (Figure 12-3).
 
3. Exhale as you release your torso and head slowly back down to the 
floor to starting position.
 
 Complete three times, remembering to breathe deeply each time.

187
 Chapter 12: Yoga Core 
 
Figure 12-3:

You get the best results if you:
 
✓ Use a yoga mat or a towel support for your head to rest on.
 
✓ Exhale before you extend your forearms and tighten your core muscles.
 
✓ Press the tops of your feet into the floor during this pose. 
Stretchy and Sticky Core Poses
Breathing, relaxing, and concentration are what the next four yoga poses 
are all about. The cat/cow is done in another chapter (see Chapter 15) and 
is used as a yoga pose to release the back. The forward bend also is used to 
release and stretch the back and lower body as it extends toward the floor. 
The child’s pose is known as the relaxing pose and is used resting your body 
as a baby or child would do to rest. It is used throughout a yoga class to rest 
your body and help prepare it for the next exercise. The corpse pose is done 
just like it sounds, and is always the final relaxation pose done in any yoga 
class. These are done in a specific sequence according to classic yoga poses 
but you can do them in any order you like. 

188
Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
Cat/Cow
Not only does this pose help make your back feel better, but also the cat/cow 
improves the range of motion in your spine, enhances strength and coordina-
tion of the muscles around your spine, and improves core muscle awareness 
in your entire back — all factors that make your lower back feel better and 
stay healthy.
To do this pose, follow these steps:
 
1. Get on the floor on your hands and knees with your hands directly 
under your shoulders and your knees directly under your hips.
 
2. Inhale and arch your back, lifting your tailbone and eyes toward the 
ceiling (see Figure 12-4a).
 
3. Hold the stretch for a few seconds then release the position back to 
neutral spine, and inhale again.
 
4. Exhale and contract your abdominals, rounding your back like an 
angry cat (see Figure 12-4b).
 
5. Hold this position for a few seconds and then release back to neutral 
spine.
 
 Repeat this pose four to six times.

189
 Chapter 12: Yoga Core 
While doing the cat/cow pose:
 
✓ Pull your belly button toward your spine.
 
✓ Keep the movement in your pelvis and lower back, not in your 
shoulders.
 
✓ Avoid tensing up your shoulders and neck.
 
✓ Remember not to overextend your neck while doing the old cow 
position.
Forward bend
 
If you have lower back problems, the forward bend may not be right for you. 
You can do a forward bend from a lying position, sitting position, or from a 
standing position like I use here. It is similar to touching your toes; however, 
the difference is you will be resting in this pose as you place your palms on 
the floor . . . or try to anyway!
This pose stretches out your back, butt, and hamstrings as you bring your 
upper body to the floor.
To do this pose, follow these steps:
 
1. With your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, inhale as you extend 
your arms over head. 
 
2. Lean forward from your hips with your chest toward the floor. Keep 
your back straight the entire time (see Figure 12-5).
 
3. Place your hands or palms on the floor on front of you. If you feel a 
strain in the back of your legs, soften your knees and rest your hands 
on your shins. 
 
 Place your hands on the floor in front of you, if you feel you need an 
additional stretch.
 
4. After holding the stretch for a few seconds, roll your body back up 
into starting position.
 
 Complete three to five times as you breathe into the pose.
When you do the forward bend, remember to:
 
✓ Hold your stretch before slowly rolling back up into starting position.
 
✓ Widen your feet to get closer to the floor to intensify this stretch.
 
✓ Keep your back straight and bend from your waist. Don’t arch your back 
at all.

Child’s pose
Ah, my favorite yoga pose! Ha! I referred to it before as the resting pose and 
that’s just what it is: a short rest in between or just before the most difficult 
poses begin. 
The child’s pose helps elongate and stretch your quadriceps (the muscles 
that run along the front of your upper leg) as you rest your body weight on 
your legs. Most people who have tight quads usually also have tight ham-
strings (the muscles that run along the back of the upper legs) so this is a 
great pose for both areas. 
 
You can rest in child’s pose with your arms extended or outreached on the 
floor in front of you to get an extra shoulder stretch. Or just keep them at your 
sides to rest and relax.
To do this pose, follow these steps:
 
1. Kneel on the floor with your knees about hip width apart. As you 
exhale, sit back on your heels, resting your torso on your thighs (as 
shown in Figure 12-6). 
 
2. Lay your arms back on the floor behind you beside your torso.

191
 Chapter 12: Yoga Core 
 
3. Breathe and close your eyes, relaxing into the pose for five breaths.
 
4. Slowly return back to kneeling position, letting your blood and breath 
return to your body before standing. 
 
 Repeat five times.
 
Figure 12-6: 
Child’s pose.
 
Make the best of your inner child through pose, by remember to:
 
✓ Keep your arms alongside your body for extra relaxation. 
 
✓ Keep your eyes closed as you relax into the pose.
 
✓ Keep your head straight with your forehead on the floor. Don’t turn your 
head to either side.
Corpse pose
And last but not least is the final resting pose known as the corpse pose. 
Always done as the final pose in any yoga class, this classic pose helps you 
get in touch with your breathing and focus on relaxing your body.
To do this exercise, follow these simple steps:
 
1. Lie on your back on a yoga mat or towel with your arms resting 
alongside your body and your palms facing down (see Figure 12-7). 
 
2. As you inhale, slowly raise your arms above your head for a more 
active pose. Otherwise, keep your arms alongside your body and 
breathe long inhales through your nose and exhale through your 
mouth. 

192
Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
 
3. Lie in corpse pose breathing deeply for three to five minutes or for six 
to eight deep yoga breaths. 
 
4. Hold this stretch for a few seconds before you release your arm. 
Repeat on your other side.

Taking In My Favorite Abs Tightener: 
Sun Salutation
The next series of poses puts together many of the different poses discussed 
earlier in this chapter as a final test so to speak Not to worry — it’s not a test, 
but it is a nice combination of the plank, cobra, forward bend, and child’s 
pose that you’ve come to love. So have fun putting all these moves together!
 
Make all your movements flow one right into the other, as you breathe and 
focus on your breath.
 
The sun salutation is a series of movements combined to help you wake 
up your body and get your blood flowing. It’s great to do first thing in the 
morning or last thing before you go to bed.

knees and going all the way up to your chest, your core actually includes 
several large muscle groups. All these muscles must work together to exe-
cute all movements your body makes. If your core is weak, your movements 
will be weak, and you won’t be able execute in the gym or in everyday life. 
When you work your arms and legs and other body parts, you transition all 
those movements through your core. So while you’re busy toning those other 
body parts, you’re also toning your core.
Because muscle tone is a good indicator of overall fitness, the best way to tell 
whether people are in shape is to look at their arms and legs as well as their 
midsection. For women and men, maintaining muscle in the arms can be 
difficult because they lose muscle tone as they age. Even with all the lifting, 
pulling, and picking up you do throughout the day, you need to work your 
arms and legs to keep them beautifully toned in addition to keeping your 
body fat low to see your muscles.
In this chapter, I incorporate many different muscle groups in the core 
exercises so you’re working more than just your core. The exercises 
contribute to a well-balanced workout that will keep you looking fit and give 
with a sleek upper and lower body.

Visualizing Working Muscles
I always like to know which muscle I’m working during a workout so I 
can visualize it getting bigger and stronger. Thinking about the body part 
that you’re exercising helps you concentrate and focus, for better results. 
Because your body is made up of many different muscles, here’s a brief 
overview of the muscles you use in the workouts in this chapter.
Targeted upper-body muscles
Here’s an overview of the upper-body muscles you’ll be using in the following 
exercises:
 
✓ Biceps muscles: The biceps start at the top of the shoulder joint and 
run down into the forearm. When you use a pulling motion with any 
exercise, you recruit the biceps. The biceps muscles are primarily 
responsible for bending your arms.
 
✓ Triceps muscles: The triceps are a little more complicated. They consist 
of three different muscles that run along the backs of your arms. The 
triceps are responsible for straightening your elbows. Anytime you 
press something down or are pushing something away from you 
(whether it be pushing in front or pushing overhead), you use the 
triceps.
 
✓ Forearm muscles: The forearms, or lower arms, run from your elbow 
down to your wrist. These muscles often get neglected because many 
people know that the forearms get some exercise by working the biceps 
and triceps. 
 
✓ Shoulder muscles: Finally, the shoulder muscles tie all these muscles 
together, so to speak. The shoulder muscle consists of three muscles, 
known as the anterior, medial, and posterior deltoids; together these 
muscles are called the deltoids, or just the “delts.” The delts help rotate 
your arm and raise it up and down and front to back. Anytime you raise 
your arms over your head, you work or use your shoulder muscles.
Targeted lower-body muscles
Here’s an overview of the lower-body muscles you’ll be using in the following 
exercises:

203
 Chapter 13: Working Your Core While Exercising Other Muscles
 
✓ Hamstrings: Located on the back of your upper leg (just under your 
butt) and behind your knee are the hamstrings. Many people have 
tight hamstrings from sitting at their desk all day and can alleviate the 
tightness with proper stretching and exercises that strengthen this large 
muscle group. Lunges are a good exercise that is found in this chapter to 
help strengthen your hamstrings along with your core. 
 
✓ Quadriceps: The group of four muscles that are located in the front of 
the upper leg are known as the quadriceps or quads. They are all used in 
movements that concern the knee joint like running, squatting, jumping, 
and walking. 
 
✓ Glutes: The glutes are made up of three muscles but (no pun intended) 
the largest of the three muscles is the gluteus maximus better known as 
the butt! The gluteus maximus is what gives the appearance or actual 
shape to your backside. 
Refresher for Using Proper 
Form with Weights
I discuss using weights to build a stronger core in Chapter 4. I am also 
including a brief refresher in this chapter on that information…just in case 
you don’t feel like flipping!
When you use weights, you get better results — but you have to use 
weights without hurting yourself. The following list rounds up some tips 
to avoid injury:
 
✓ Keep your shoulders back and down. If your shoulders tense up and 
float up around your ears, you’re using too much weight. Not good! 
Keep your shoulders pressed down and back, for good posture and to 
avoid injury.
 
✓ Keep your chest lifted. Keep your chest or sternum up and lifted so you 
don’t hunch over and hurt your lower back. You need to use your core 
muscles to keep your chest up, so you work on both body parts and 
posture at once.
 
✓ Keep wrists in line with elbows. To keep you from hurting your joints 
and pulling a muscle, never bend your wrists when lifting weights. Keep 
them on the same plane with your elbows.

204
Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
 
✓ Keep your hips in line with your shoulders. Twisting can lead to 
serious back injuries because when you move your shoulders first, 
your hips stay behind. Next time you need to pick up something or look 
behind you, move your hips first so your shoulders move in unison.
 
✓ Keep your abdominal muscles pulled in. Suck in your gut! Just as if you 
were tightening a belt, don’t let your tummy muscles slacken for one 
minute. Use your breath to exhale, and pull in your abdominals with the 
tough part of a move and inhale slowly on the way back down.
Recruiting Your Upper Body for Core
Unlike your leg muscles, some of your upper-body muscles, like your biceps, 
are small muscle groups, so you want to avoid overtraining them. The triceps 
muscles are also made up of many different muscles located along the back of 
your arms. The biceps muscles work in opposition to the triceps, so working 
both muscle groups together is important to achieve balance and to keep the 
entire arm strong as you transition the following exercises through your core.
If you don’t want to stand while doing the following exercises, you can use 
the exercise ball or a weight bench to sit on. However, of the two, I prefer 
using the ball because it challenges your balance and coordination as it 
increases your core strength when you’re working with weights.
I suggest starting out with three to five pound hand weights; when you can 
comfortably, do this workout two to three times a week. Then work up to 
heavier dumbbells.
Just remember the following list of tips when using weights, to avoid injury:
 
✓ Keep your shoulders back and down.
 
✓ Keep your chest lifted.
 
✓ Keep your wrists in line with your elbows.
 
✓ Keep your hips in line with your shoulders.
 
✓ Keep your abdominal muscles pulled in.
Biceps curls
To do the biceps curl, you need three to five pound weights. As you gain 
strength, try using heavier dumbbells. The instability of the ball adds a new 
aspect of balancing to the biceps curl, making it more challenging for a better 
all-over workout.

205
 Chapter 13: Working Your Core While Exercising Other Muscles
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with feet shoulder width apart. Hold your weights down by 
your sides, with your palms facing inward.
 
2. Pull in your abdominal muscles as you slowly bring your weights 
toward your shoulders (see Figure 13-1).
 
 Your palms should be facing your shoulder.
 
 As you curl the weights toward your shoulders, concentrate on the 
biceps muscles. Doing so helps you isolate the movement and focus on 
the muscle that you’re working.
 
3. Hold for a few beats and then release the weights back to your sides.
 
4. Complete two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions.
Follow these tips while doing this exercise:
 
✓ Keep a straight spine and pull in your abdominals while lifting the 
weights to your shoulders.
 
✓ Lower the weights slowly back to the starting position.

✓ Use a slow, controlled movement — don’t jerk the weights up to your 
shoulders.
 
✓ Don’t allow the elbow to shift forward or backward. Keep the upper arm 
as still as possible so only the elbow bends. 
Alternating biceps curls
Beginners need three- to five-pound weights with the alternating biceps 
exercise. Advanced men and women can use heavier dumbbells.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Sit on the ball with your feet shoulder width apart. Hold your weights 
down by your sides, with your palms facing inward.
 
2. Pull in the abdominal muscles as you slowly bring your right weight 
toward your right shoulder (see Figure 13-2).
 
 Your palm should face inward toward the shoulder.
 
3. Hold for a few beats and then release the weight back to your right 
side; repeat with your other arm.
 
4. Complete two sets of ten repetitions.

 Chapter 13: Working Your Core While Exercising Other Muscles
Here’s what you need to remember for this exercise:
 
✓ Concentrate on your biceps muscle as you do this exercise.
 
✓ Contract your abs before lifting the weight to your shoulder.
 
✓ Use a slow, controlled movement — don’t jerk the weights up to your 
shoulders.
Triceps press
The triceps press works the triceps (the back of the arms). Like with the 
biceps curl, this exercise is more challenging when you do it on the ball 
because you need to maintain your balance.
 
If you have a neck or shoulder injury, always check with your doctor first to 
see which exercises are appropriate for you.
Beginners need one three to five pound weight. Advanced ball users can use 
a heavier dumbbell.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Sit on the ball with your feet shoulder width apart. Hold the weight in 
both hands, behind your head (as Figure 13-3a shows).
 
 Keep your biceps next to your ears.
 
2. Straighten your elbows, pressing the weight toward the ceiling (see 
Figure 13-3b).
 
3. Bend your elbows to slowly lower the weight behind your neck.
 
4. Complete two sets of ten repetitions.
While performing the triceps press exercise, keep the following in mind:
 
✓ Hold the weight in both hands as you press up.
 
✓ Stare straight ahead and keep your neck long — don’t let your head and 
neck tilt forward during this exercise.

Triceps kickbacks
To end the arm series, do some triceps kickbacks. You really need to pull in 
your abdominals before doing these movements.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Step out into a lunge position, with your right leg forward and your 
left leg back.
 
 Your left knee should be slightly bent.
 
2. Holding your weights in your hands by your sides, keep your elbows 
bent at a 90-degree angle (as Figure 13-4a shows).
 
3. Moving only your forearm, extend your arms behind you until the 
elbow is straight (see Figure 13-4b).
 
4. Hold your weights back for a few seconds, and then return your arms 
to the starting position.
 
5. Complete ten repetitions and then switch legs. Increase repetitions 
when you feel comfortable.

To get the most out of this exercise, remember to:
 
✓ Keep your arms close to your sides while performing this exercise.
 
✓ Arch your back. Keep it straight and long as you lift your forearm 
behind you.
 
✓ Avoid letting your head drop down.
 
✓ Do keep your upper arm parallel to the floor. 
Hammer curls
Seated hammer curls help develop good forearms. Don’t be afraid to challenge 
yourself by increasing the weight as you go along to possibly a 15-pound or 
heavier dumbbell.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Sit tall on the ball with your feet hip-distance apart. Hold your weights 
in your hands, with your palms facing each other and your arms down 
by your sides (as Figure 13-5a shows).

210
Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
 
2. Bend your elbows as you bring your weights toward your shoulders 
with palms facing each other (see Figure 13-5b), keeping the abdominal 
muscles tight.
 
 Be careful not to let the weights touch your shoulders.
 
3. Slowly lower your weights, keeping tension on your biceps 
throughout the movement.
 
4. Complete two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions.
You can really nail your biceps with the hammer curl exercise, if you 
remember the following tips:
 
✓ Keep your feet firmly planted on the floor, to keep the ball from moving.
 
✓ Keep your elbows from moving back and forth during this exercise.
 
✓ Use a slow and controlled movement throughout this exercise — don’t 
release the weights too fast.

Bent-over rows
This exercise works the obliques, core, arms, and shoulders. Maintaining 
proper form throughout this exercise is important.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Place your right knee on the ball, keeping your upper torso almost 
parallel to the floor.
 
2. Balance yourself by keeping your left hand on the ball and holding 
your weight in your right hand at your side (see Figure 13-6a).
 
3. Pull your weight up with a rowing motion as your elbow pulls back 
past your ribcage (as Figure 13-6b shows). 
 
 Be sure not to allow the shoulder to drop when pulling the elbow back.
 
4. Hold for a few seconds, and then release the weight down to your side.
 
5. Complete ten repetitions. Then switch sides and repeat. Increase 
repetitions when you feel comfortable.

Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
While doing this exercise, remember to:
 
✓ Pull your elbow back as far as you can as you keep the shoulder blade 
squeezed back as far as possible toward the spine.
 
✓ Keep a long, straight spine during this exercise — don’t lift your head 
because this movement causes your back to arch.
Body Resistance Core Series
Using the weight of your body as resistance to work against it is traditionally 
done with calisthenics. It’s an extremely efficient way to build muscle and 
stay fit because it provides short bursts of intense training. You can work 
almost all muscle groups with only a few exercises.
Body weight resistance exercises are the perfect choice to do anytime 
because you don’t to use extra weights to build great strength and lean 
muscle. Plus, they have many of their own benefits:
 
✓ You can do these exercises indoors or outdoors, without going to a gym 
or other facility for lifting weights.
 
✓ If you hate lifting weights, your body resistance training makes for an 
intense home exercise workout.
 
✓ Body resistance training improves cardiovascular endurance and core 
and muscular strength (because most of us weigh more than 100 pounds).
The following exercises challenge you in a different way than the other exercises 
in this book by using your own body weight. This is a good full-body workout 
you can do five times a week or as often as you feel comfortable. 
Dips off a table
This exercise works your core as you strengthen your lower back and the 
muscles along the backs of your arms, the triceps.
Warning: Do not perform this exercise if you have any kind of shoulder injury. 
 
1. With your back facing the coffee table, bend your knees and place 
your hands behind you on the table. Place one leg on top of the 
opposite knee (as shown in Figure 13-7a).
 
2. Inhale as you bend your elbows and lower or dip your body down 
toward the floor. Exhale as you straighten your arms and press back 
up (as seen in Figure 13-7b).
 
3. Perform ten dips.

Get the most from doing dips by remembering to:
 
✓ Keep your elbows in and your arms close to your sides while performing 
this exercise.
 
✓ Avoid allowing your waist to drop below your knees, to prevent injury.
 
✓ Make your core and arms take over the workload — don’t let your lower 
body do all the work.
Push-ups off a table
Doing a push-up off a table lends itself to working your core more intensely 
because you have to keep your lower back from dipping toward the floor 
and keep your spine long and straight. This exercise works your core, chest, 
arms, shoulders, and upper back.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand facing your coffee table. Place your hands on the edge of the 
table for support as you straighten your arms and extend your legs 
back behind you (see Figure 13-8a).

214
Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
 
2. Inhale as you lower your chest to the table in a classic push-up 
position by bending your elbows out to the side. Exhale as you press 
back up to your starting position (refer to Figure 13-8b).
 
 Keep your back flat. 
 
3. Perform ten push-ups.
While pushing through your push-ups, remember the following tips:
 
✓ Keep your elbows straight without allowing your elbows to lock as you 
press back into a push-up
 
✓ Don’t arch your back or let your middle back dip toward the table.
 
✓ Don’t let your head drop.

Squats
In this exercise, you work all the large muscle groups in the lower half of your 
body.

215
 Chapter 13: Working Your Core While Exercising Other Muscles
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. With your arms out in front of you at chest level, lower in a squatting 
position so that your knees are parallel to the floor and keep your 
weight on your heels, not your toes (see Figure 13-9a).
 
2. Exhale as you press back up into a standing position, tightening your 
abdominal muscles (Figure 13-9b).
 
3. Perform ten squats.
Here’s what you need to remember for this exercise:
 
✓ Keep your abdominal muscles tight, to protect your back while doing 
this exercise.
 
✓ Keep your chest lifted and shoulders back throughout the entire exercise.
 
✓ Avoid strain on your knees by pressing through your heels.
 
✓ Avoid allowing your butt to drop below hip level. Remember, you’re 
sitting down in a pretend chair, so you don’t need to press back that far.

Walking lunges
Doing lunges from one side of the room to the other really calls on your 
core muscles to keep your chest lifted and shoulders back. This exercise 
strengthens your thighs and butt also.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Take a big step forward with your right leg, and lower your right knee 
toward the floor as you lower into a lunge position (see Figure 13-10a). 
 
 Keep the stress off your knee by placing your weight in the heel of your 
front leg and not your toes.
 
2. Perform five lunges to the opposite side of the room. Turn around and 
do five lunges back to the other side of the room. 
 
 You should finish exactly where you started (see Figure 13-10b).

 Chapter 13: Working Your Core While Exercising Other Muscles
Remember these tips when you do this exercise:
 
✓ Keep your arms close to your sides or hands on your hips while 
performing this exercise.
 
✓ Keep your back straight and long as you point your tailbone toward the 
floor — don’t arch your back.
 
✓ Keep your eyes lifted and your neck in line with your spine — don’t let 
your head drop.
 
✓ Keep your front foot beyond your front knee as you keep your knee at a 
90-degree angle. 
Hot muscles work better
Getting your heart rate up before you lift weights 
is essential because warming up your muscles 
and tendons increases your muscle elastic-
ity (a muscle’s length and its ability to stretch 
with heat), which enables you to handle heavier 
weights. Increasing your heart rate also helps 
you burn more calories during your workout.
You need only about five to ten minutes to 
increase your heart rate before your workout. 
Taking a spin on a bike or a short jog on the 
treadmill does the trick. Jumping rope for a few 
minutes is also a good warm-up because it defi-
nitely gets your heart pumping in no time. 
For another good way to warm up your body 
and have a little fun, see Chapter 4. You’ll dis-
cover some great exercises that you can do to 
warm up your body properly before you head 
out the door for any kind of sport.

Your Middle
In This Chapter
▶ Getting familiar with different stretches used to stretch your core
▶ Discovering the do’s and don’ts of stretching your core
▶ Creating some functional stretches for your core to use every day
▶ Finding the best ways to stretch out your core
Y
ou may have a strong back and sexy abs, but you still need to be able 
to touch your toes! So along with strengthening your core, you have to 
increase your flexibility. Stretching your core increases your flexibility by 
improving your range of motion. Stretching For Dummies (another book by 
yours truly and published by Wiley) can teach you how to stretch, and so can 
the core stretches in this chapter.
The stretches in this chapter target the abdominals, back, and waist, to help 
improve your range of motion. The combination of these stretches helps 
create a strong and flexible core. So first you stretch out your core, and then 
you strengthen it. 
What to Do and What Not to Do
In Chapter 3 I talk about the basics of stretching and how it can help with your 
workout. You may want to review that section before moving on or take a peek 
at the following list as a refresher on just how important stretching really is:
 
✓ Stretch after your workout.
 
✓ Stretch a little bit every other day.

220
Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
 
✓ Hold each stretch for 30 seconds.
 
✓ Avoid stretching until the point of pain.
 
✓ Stretch from the top to the bottom, down to the tip of your toes.
Abs and Back Core Stretch Series
I joke a lot in this book about getting a “six pack,” but this series of stretches 
will really help you feel your abs. This series of core stretches will also work 
your back and all those other parts between your ribcage and your hips that 
make up your core.
Back extension
You see people every day who walk through life with rounded backs. You 
may even have this issue yourself. The back extension stretch is here to help 
you! This stretch is technically for the abdominals, but it’s also great for the 
back muscles because it moves your spine in the opposite direction, giving 
the muscles a workout and increasing the mobility of your spine.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your belly and prop yourself up with your elbows.
 
 Your elbows should be directly under your shoulders. Lift yourself up out 
of your shoulders so that you aren’t sinking into your shoulder blades.
 
2. Inhale and, as you exhale, lengthen your spine and lift your chest as if 
you were going to move forward (see Figure 14-1).
 
 While performing this stretch, imagine that you’re trying to move forward 
but that your elbows and hips are glued to the floor and the space between 
each vertebra is increasing, lengthening your spine.
 
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or five or six slow, deep breaths.
 
 You should feel this stretch in your abdominals.
Get the most from this stretch by remembering the following tips:
 
✓ Keep your neck long and in line with the rest of your spine.
 
✓ Pull your belly in toward your spine.
 
✓ Think of your chest moving forward and up — don’t lift your chest 
toward the ceiling.

Step back and reach
This abdominal stretch is for the muscles that run along the front of your 
torso. Feel this stretch in your hip flexor, abdominals, and chest.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand tall, with your feet together, your abdominals and chest lifted, 
your shoulders back, and your shoulder blades down (see Figure 14-2a).
 
2. Inhale and, as you exhale, lunge back with your left leg and reach 
your left arm over your head (see Figure 14-2b).
 
3. Hold this position for three deep breaths.
 
4. Inhale and bring your foot and arm back to starting position.
 
5. Repeat this exercise with your right leg and arm.
 
6. Repeat this stretch for six to eight repetitions, alternating sides (as in 
Step 5).
 
 When you feel that you’re ready to add a repetition or two, try doing two 
sets of six to eight repetitions.
Here are a few tips to remember while doing this stretch:
 
✓ Keep your spine long, even as you reach up and back down.
 
✓ Keep the motion slow and fluid, and use your abdominals to slow that 
motion.
 
✓ Avoid compressing your lower back as you reach up.
 
✓ Be sure that you don’t twist or reach to the side.

Side reach
This reach-and-stretch exercise is for the muscles that run along the outside of 
your hip, and the movements help your abdominals and your back. This stretch 
is a great daily stretch to keep you sitting tall and exercise good posture.
Perform this stretch by following these steps:
 
1. Stand up tall, with your feet together, your abdominals and chest 
lifted, your shoulders back, and your shoulder blades down (see 
Figure 14-3a).
 
2. Inhale and, as you exhale, step out to the side with your right leg (side 
lunge), reaching your right arm overhead in the opposite direction 
(see Figure 14-3b).
 
 The farther out you step to the side, the more you feel a stretch in your 
inner thigh, too.
 
3. Hold the stretch for one deep breath.
 
4. Inhale and bring your body back to the starting position.
 
5. Repeat the steps on the left side.

 When you feel that you’re ready to add a repetition or two, try doing two 
sets of six to eight repetitions.
Reach for great results with these tips:
 
✓ Keep your stationary leg straight so you feel the stretch in your inner thigh.
 
✓ Be sure that you don’t twist or rotate your hips.
 
✓ Avoid bending forward as you lunge to the side.
 
✓ Do keep your weight back on the heel of the leg you step to the side with.
Lying spinal rotation
The lying spinal rotation is a good stretch to do when you want to stretch 
several muscles at once. In this stretch, you feel your back, oblique, neck, 
and chest muscles all stretch at the same time.

224
Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
 
This stretch may be a bit uncomfortable at first, so always begin the stretch 
in your comfort zone for the first 10 to 15 seconds of the stretch, and then 
gradually increase the resistance of the stretch for the remainder. Never 
stretch beyond your pain threshold. Beginning slowly gives your muscles a 
chance to release and loosen up before you try to deepen the stretch.
This stretch involves the following steps:
 
1. Lie on your back, with both legs extended and both arms extended 
out from your sides.
 
2. Exhale and raise your left knee to your chest, and slowly cross your 
knee over your body to the right (see Figure 14-4).
 
3. Turn your head to the left, or opposite direction, as you relax into the 
stretch.
 
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds; release the stretch, and repeat on the 
other side.
You need to remember the following while performing this stretch:
 
✓ Breathe regularly as you hold the stretch.
 
✓ Progress through the stretch gradually.
 
✓ Be sure to not arch your back.
 
✓ Keep your shoulder blades on the floor rather than get your knee to 
touch the floor — don’t force your knee to the floor.

Spinal rotation
A traditional stretch exists to stretch your buttocks, but by adding a spinal 
rotation to this buttocks stretch, you can stretch your back and buttocks at 
the same time. The two-in-one stretch can save you time and stretch your 
muscles more functionally.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand up tall, with your right foot and right shoulder next to a chair, 
wall, fence, or other supportive surface for balance.
 
2. Lift your left foot and place your left ankle on top of your right thigh.
 
3. Inhale and, as you exhale, bend your right knee, and hinge or bend 
forward at your hips slightly so your hips move backward, similar to a 
squat (see Figure 14-5a for an example).
 
4. To deepen the stretch, grab hold of the chair or other supportive 
surface with both hands (see Figure 14-5b).
 
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or five or six slow, deep breaths.
 
6. Repeat the steps on the other side.

Part IV: Adding Variety to Your Core Routine 
While performing this stretch, be sure that you:
 
✓ Breathe regularly throughout the stretch.
 
✓ Tilt your pelvis back to feel a deeper stretch in your buttocks.
 
✓ Keep your knee directly above your ankle. Feel your weight mostly in 
your heel, not in your toes or the ball of your foot. Don’t let your knee 
jut forward.
 
✓ Avoid bouncing or forcing the stretch.
Why am I so sore after working out?
For decades, it was thought that the achy feel-
ing you get after an intense workout was the 
result of a lactic acid build-up in the tissues of 
your muscles. Lactic acid is a normal by-product 
of the process of turning oxygen into energy, 
also known as glycolysis. When you work extra 
hard, your blood doesn’t carry enough oxygen 
to wash your muscles clean of lactic acid and a 
residue builds up. Although many trainers may 
have told you your soreness was due to a lactic 
acid build-up in your muscles, soreness now 
has been attributed to tiny tears in the muscle 
fibers caused by the requirements of unfamil-
iar and excessive training. By helping to ensure 
that your muscles stay elastic and have a full 
range of motion in your joints, stretching can 
help protect you from those microscopic tears 
caused by newly intense levels of exercise.

n this part of the book, you discover that no matter 
what stage of life you’re in, core exercises can improve 
your daily life. Chapter 15 focuses on pregnancy and post-
natal core exercises to help you relax and strengthen your 
body in preparation of child birth and after. Chapter 16 
gives you a series of fun exercises your kids can do to 
help them build basic core strength and learn the skills 
needed to stay fit for a lifetime. And finally, Chapter 18 
contains core exercises that address the needs of anyone 
over the age of 60. If you’re in one of these demographics, 
you’ll find something suitable for you in this part!

W
orking out during pregnancy is the best thing you can do for you and 
your baby. Many women — and doctors — find that exercising really 
helps relieve the discomforts of pregnancy. Just check out a couple of body 
benefits to exercising while you’re pregnant:
 
✓ When you move your body on a daily basis and add some core-
strengthening exercises, the pressure from your growing belly is 
relieved because your breathing becomes easier. 
 
✓ Because your back muscles are engaged during core exercises, your 
posture improves, giving your baby more space to move around, as 
you’re able to stand taller and lengthen your spine.
Within the last ten years, the medical profession has recognized the benefits 
of exercise for women during pregnancy. The challenges brought on by 
pregnancy and the stress of delivery are now countered with exercise to 
help women keep moving and stay strong throughout their pregnancies. In 
this chapter, I include some fun ideas to help keep you moving during your 
pregnancy and I include exercises that will also help keep you strong as your 
belly grows to alleviate the strain on your back.
At the end of this chapter, I cover some wonderful core exercises that 
you can use to strengthen your core and pelvic floor after giving birth and 
carrying around your baby for 9 months. 
 
It’s especially important to consult your doctor before starting an exercise 
program to become aware of the special demands placed on your body result-
ing from pregnancy for you and your baby.

Part V: Special Situations 
Keeping a Strong Core 
with a Growing Belly
Because your center of gravity shifts during pregnancy and your belly usually 
greets people before you do, pregnancy can leave you feeling a bit off-center. 
 
Support your growing belly and shifting body weight by helping take the 
pressure off your back and legs is the best thing you can do to help alleviate 
that uncomfortable feeling. Although many women would prefer to take 
pressure off their backs by simply lying down, you’re better off giving your 
body the support it needs through some core moves. By supporting your 
lower back in different positions with some basic core exercises,  you 
provide support that would otherwise be placed on the legs — which have 
way too much strain on them already.
Not only does exercise help you, by giving you a feeling of deep relaxation, 
but studies also show that working out during pregnancy increases your 
chances of having a faster and easier delivery and postpartum recovery.
When you get the urge to hit the couch instead of the gym while you’re 
pregnant, just remember the following benefits you get from exercising 
during pregnancy:
 
✓ Alleviation of back pain, one of the biggest complaints that pregnant 
women have.
 
✓ Increased oxygen to the baby as a result of all the extra breathing that 
you’re doing while exercising.
 
✓ Better digestion, which means help with morning sickness.
 
✓ Help with labor pains and preparation for delivery. (The stronger your 
muscles are, the easier your delivery will be because you’ll be able to 
push harder.)
 
✓ Help with losing the baby weight and aids in a speedier recovery after 
delivery.
Giving birth has been compared to running a marathon, and that comparison 
is true — I know from experience! Being in great shape during your preg-
nancy helps ensure a healthier pregnancy and a faster recovery.

 Chapter 15: Pregnancy Moves for Your Core
Kicking In Cardio for All Nine Months
You can choose from several good exercise options during your pregnancy. 
The following are ones you can do through all three trimesters, and that’s 
why I recommend them highly. Read on to see my top three.
Walking
Walking is my recommended primary exercise during pregnancy, along with 
core moves and, of course, stretching (try Stretching For Dummies [Wiley], 
by yours truly). Walking helps to stretch the hip muscles while improving 
muscle tone in the pelvic floor and increasing circulation. Breaking up your 
walking routine can help boost your energy level by doing two shorter walks 
of 10 to 20 minutes a day instead of one longer one. And doing two shorter 
walks gives you a more workable routine that you can easily fit into your 
busy schedule. Of course, if you find yourself walking longer than ten minutes 
at a time, that’s great, but remember to keep it simple and don’t overdo it.
Swimming
For a complete pregnancy workout, try swimming. Being in the water leaves 
you feeling weightless, gets the heart pumping, and helps loosen those 
muscles. Swimming is just a great way to stay in touch with your body during 
pregnancy.
Moving
I’m not suggesting that you pick up and move your residence when you get 
pregnant. Instead, whatever you choose to do for exercise during pregnancy, 
just remember to keep moving. During the first trimester, you may find 
simply moving difficult because you feel tired and definitely need to take a 
catnap, which will help rejuvenate you throughout the day. Just try to keep 
up some form of simple exercise to keep that oxygen pumping to your 
growing baby and to help you stay fit during pregnancy. In other words, 
honor your body by listening to it: Rest when you need to and keep moving 
when you feel the desire!

232
Part V: Special Situations 
Easing Discomfort with Core Moves
Core exercises can strengthen the abdominals even as your belly expands 
and help relieve tensions within your body from an overloaded back. Doing 
exercises that stretch out or round your back ease discomfort and help your 
muscles relax. The back roll-up exercise in this chapter and the chest and 
back stretch are two excellent ways to release built-up tension and discom-
fort from carrying around your extra weight.
Because of all the extra blood and fluids that your body is producing to sup-
port your growing baby, you may feel a buildup of pressure and a pulling 
sensation in your abdomen. The exercises in this section help counter these 
problems and many other discomforts you feel while pregnant.
Cat/cow
This move not only helps make your back feel better, but it also improves 
the range of motion in your spine, enhances strength and coordination of 
the muscles around your spine, and improves core muscle awareness in 
your entire back — all factors that make your lower back feel better and stay 
healthy.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Get on the floor on your hands and knees, with your hands directly 
under your shoulders and your knees directly under your hips.
 
2. Inhale and arch your back, lifting your tailbone and eyes toward the 
ceiling (see Figure 15-1a).
 
3. Hold the stretch for a few seconds and then release the position back 
to neutral spine, and inhale again.
 
4. Exhale and contract your abdominals, rounding your back like an 
angry cat (see Figure 15-1b).
 
5. Hold this position for a few seconds and then release back to neutral 
spine.
 
6. Repeat this exercise four to six times.
Get the most out of this exercise by
 
✓ Pulling your belly button toward your spine.
 
✓ Keeping the movement in your pelvis and lower back, not in your 
shoulders.

233
 Chapter 15: Pregnancy Moves for Your Core
 
✓ Keeping your shoulders and neck relaxed — don’t tense ’em up.
 
✓ Keeping your neck in a neutral position — don’t overextend your neck 
while doing the old cow position.

Hip extension or kneeling bird/dog
This move is a good strengthening exercise for the abs, glutes, and lower 
back. Perfect for pregnancy!
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Kneeling on your hands and knees, place your hands below your 
shoulders and keep your knees directly beneath your hips (see Figure 
15-2a).
 
2. Raise your right knee off the floor, extending your leg straight behind 
you, parallel to the floor, as you also extend your left arm straight out 
in front of you (as seen in Figure 15-2b). Hold for a count of three.
 
3. Lower your arm and leg back to the starting position, rounding your 
back like a cat.

234

4. Repeat this exercise, alternating sides, for ten repetitions for each 
side.
 
Try to stay as relaxed as possible — don’t tense up.
Here’s what you need to remember for this exercise:
 
✓ Pull your belly button toward your spine.
 
✓ Avoid tensing your shoulders and neck.
 
✓ Use your diaphragm as you breathe to help you keep your balance and 
focus on keeping your spine completely neutral throughout this move.

Modified side plank
With a slight modification for pregnancy, the side plank works the core and 
includes the obliques. This exercise is one of the few you can do to directly 
help strengthen your abs during pregnancy.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:

235
 Chapter 15: Pregnancy Moves for Your Core
 
1. Start by lying on your side, with your bottom arm bent, legs straight, 
and feet staggered one in front of the other (as shown in Figure 15-3a).
 
 Your elbow should be directly below your shoulder. Place your free 
hand on the floor in front of you or on your hip.
 
2. Using your abs to lift your hips off the ground, keep your body as 
straight as possible (see Figure 15-3b). Hold for ten seconds.
 
3. Repeat one to three times and then switch sides.

Remember the following tips while doing this exercise:
 
✓ Stagger your feet or place one in front of the other, to decrease the level 
of difficulty or just keep your knees and feet flat on the floor with knees 
bent at a 90-degree angle.
 
✓ Avoid tensing your shoulders and neck to keep them in a neutral, 
relaxed position. 
 
✓ Keep your breathing steady — don’t allow your hips to drop to the 
ground. Keep them in a straight line with your body from the shoulder 
down to your knees or feet.

Part V: Special Situations 
Strengthening Your Stance 
with Standing Floor Moves
The next series helps build core strength while standing. It’s important to 
maintain your balance throughout these exercises, so feel free to use the 
assistance of the wall if you need to steady yourself and keep from falling.
Side lunge
The side lunge uses the same technique as the forward lunge, except that 
you’ll be stepping out at a 45-degree angle from the starting position instead 
of straight forward. It’s good for strengthening your pelvic floor and working 
your abdominals plus all the major muscles in your lower body including the 
glutes, quads, hamstrings, and abductors/adductors. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Standing with your feet about shoulder-width apart, keep your legs 
straight but not locked (see Figure 15-4a).
 
2. Take one large step sideways with your right leg. Slowly push back 
up, using your right leg and core muscles, to standing position (as 
shown in Figure 15-4b).
 
3. Alternate sides, doing ten reps on each leg.
When you do side lunges, remember to
 
✓ Keep your hands on your hips as you step out sideways into a lunge.
 
✓ Keep your knees soft — don’t lock your knees.
 
✓ Keep your breathing steady and strong — don’t hold your breath.

Who does the heavy lifting in your family?
It’s tough to keep up with all the movements you 
have to do throughout the day: taking out the 
garbage, lifting your kids in and out of the car, 
bringing in the groceries from the car, and so 
on. The following tips will help reduce the risk 
of back pain when lifting and moving any kind 
of heavy weight:
 ✓ Tighten your stomach muscles before lifting.
 ✓ When standing, spread your feet shoulder 
width apart to give yourself a solid base of 
support, and then slightly bend your knees.
 ✓ Position the person or object close to your 
body before lifting.
 ✓ Lift with your leg muscles. Never lift an 
object by keeping your legs stiff while 
bending over it.
 ✓ Avoid twisting your body; instead, point 
your toes in the direction you want to move 
and pivot in that direction.
 ✓ When placing an object on a high shelf, 
move close to the shelf.
 ✓ During lifting movements, maintain the 
natural curve of your spine; don’t bend at 
your waist.
 ✓ Do not try to lift something by yourself that 
is too heavy or that is an awkward shape. 
Get help.

Part V: Special Situations 
Relieving Tight Muscles with Releasing
When you become pregnant, your body changes posturally so the baby can 
grow and your body can get ready for the birthing process. Increased hor-
mones play a big part in these structural changes and allow your ligaments 
to loosen and stretch. You’ll find that some of your muscles will tighten while 
others will loosen completely.
Releasing your back and abs provides you with these benefits during pregnancy:
 
✓ Aids in the circulation of all the extra blood you have pumping through 
your veins and arteries to various parts of the body
 
✓ Increases your energy level (a result of increased circulation)
 
✓ Reduces muscle tension in the lower back due to your growing belly
 
✓ Increases your range of movement in the joints
 
✓ Improves coordination (which you need desperately, thanks to your 
growing belly)
Given all those benefits, I like to include a few abdominal and back-releasing 
exercises to finish up a pregnancy core workout. With the flexibility exercises 
in this section, you can do some releasing for the muscles that get tight.
 
Because you’ll probably be doing a lot of sitting with your feet up during late 
pregnancy, take your time getting up from a seated position, to avoid standing 
up too quickly and getting dizzy.
Pregnancy core stretch
This stretch eases back pain and tension by targeting the whole muscle that 
extends from your neck to the small of your back. Be sure to do this stretch 
whenever you feel lower-back discomfort.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with your feet hip distance apart, keeping your knees relaxed 
(as shown in Figure 15-5a).
 
2. Holding on to a door or a chair for support, bend your knees and 
round your back, tucking your chin toward your chest and tucking 
your pelvis (see Figure 15-5b).
 
3. Hold for ten seconds and then repeat several times.

tarting a fitness program for anyone can be daunting but it can be

looking and feeling good about themselves again. And in this chapter, I not 
only lead you back to the path to looking and feeling good, but I also show 
you that getting back into exercise doesn’t have to be so overwhelming, as 
long as you’re armed with the proper tools.
In this chapter, I talk about finding the time to fit in exercise, and the 
importance of not overdoing it right after giving birth by setting realistic 
goals for yourself. I also show you some fantastic exercises where you can 
start incorporating your baby in your workout, which is beneficial to both of

Do’s and Don’ts for New Moms
If you’re committed to getting back in shape after having your baby, you can 
do several things to ensure your success. And, of course, you should also 
avoid some things at all costs to make sure you stay on the path to fitness. In 
the following sections, I give you some guidelines about what to do or not to 
do as you get back into exercising. Above all, remember that slow and steady 
does indeed win the race. So don’t get discouraged — getting back into shape 
just takes time.
 
After your doctor gives you the go-ahead to exercise (around six weeks for 
vaginal births and eight weeks for cesarean sections) check out the following 
guidelines before you begin to make your transition a bit smoother for getting 
back in shape!
Do
Before you begin exercising postpartum, you definitely need to ensure that you
 
✓ Set some goals. You’re more likely to stick with a program when you’ve 
set some goals for yourself, so write down your fitness goals.
 
✓ Remember that you’re not eating for two anymore! Strive to eat a 
well-balanced diet that includes lots of fresh vegetables and fruit.
 
✓ Eat several minimeals throughout the day, and don’t go hungry.
 
✓ Keep your current fitness level in mind before starting your exercise 
program. By doing so, you’ll be able to establish goals that meet your 
specific needs.
 
✓ Choose alternatives to satisfy your cravings, when possible. Consider 
fat-free chocolate pudding over ice cream.
 
✓ Always stretch before and after your exercise routine (try my book 
Stretching For Dummies [Wiley]).
 
✓ Increase slowly the intensity of your workouts over time as your 
stamina grows. Trying to do too much at once will burn you out fast.
 
✓ Partner up with another mom or friend. You’ll help motivate each 
other, and it’s easier to stick to anything with a buddy.
 
✓ Grab a healthy snack instead of eating junk food. Try string cheese, 
raisins, nuts, carrots, crackers and peanut butter, and so on.

243
 Chapter 16: New Mommy and Me Core Workout
Don’t
For true fitness success after you have your baby, make sure that you don’t
 
✓ Do too much at once. Your body needs time to recover, so take time to 
do so.
 
✓ Skip breakfast. Eating breakfast jump-starts your metabolism and 
provides you with the energy you need to get through the day.
 
✓ Skip naps. With a new baby, it’s tough to get rest, let alone work out. 
Take catnaps for 10 to 20 minutes when you can — it really helps.
 
✓ Set unrealistic goals. A healthy rate of weight loss is one to two pounds 
per week. If you have 30 or so pounds to lose, don’t expect it to come off 
overnight — you’ll set yourself up for disappointment.
 
✓ Compare yourself to others. Everyone is different and, therefore, 
unique — what works for some may not work for others, and vice versa.
 
✓ Be too hard on yourself. It took nine months to grow a baby so give 
yourself time to get back to your former fitness level — be patient.
What is diastasis recti?
Ever heard or felt a separation in your abdomi-
nal wall? Better known as diastasis recti, it 
usually happens during the second or third tri-
mester of pregnancy. This condition is painless 
but normal, although your doctor should check 
it out at your postpartum check-up before you 
begin exercising.
Here’s what you’ll find out if you have it:
If the split is more than three finger-widths, 
you’ll need to avoid any twisting movements 
or spinal rotation. You can splint your abdomen 
with your hands or a towel during spinal flex-
ion, until the split reduces to one finger-width or 
less. The biggest concern is that the intestines 
may be pushed out through the thin fascia and 
cause a hernia, which looks like a bulge under 
the skin. Persistent diastasis recti may be sur-
gically corrected, usually at the time you have 
another baby.

Kick-Starting Your Fitness 
Slowly with Kegels
I’m sure you know by now after giving birth, that there is nothing more 
incredible than the changes a woman’s body undergoes during pregnancy. 
And just how shocking it is to look in the mirror after coming home from the 
hospital and still look six months pregnant! Although you may want to be 
active, exercise can be the farthest thing from your mind, right? You may feel 
overwhelmed or fatigued for the first three to six months after giving birth. 
However, as the author of Lose That Baby Fat (M. Evans and Company, Inc.), 
I can tell you that working out early on in the postpartum period gives you 
back the energy you’ll need to care for your new little one. It also helps clear 
the cobwebs from sleep deprivation. Plus studies have shown a relationship 
between starting physical activity after pregnancy and the decrease of post-
partum depression, but only if the exercise is stress relieving and not stress 
provoking. 
 
Because you need stress-relieving exercise in your life, start off slowly with a 
few kegel exercises (strengthening exercises that rehabilitate and recondition 
the pelvic floor muscles) each day is a good way to get back in the mindset of 
exercise. You can perform kegels immediately after giving birth to help recon-
dition the muscles and push out some of the water and fluids you’ll be losing 
from the birth.
To do this move, follow these steps:
 
1. Sit in a chair or lie down with your feet flat on the floor as you pull in 
the muscles you use to stop the flow of your urine.
 
2. Hold for three to five seconds before releasing and beginning again.
After a few days of kegel exercises, begin the following series of exercises. 
Don’t forget to work up slowly!
Warming Up to Your New Mom Workout
As a new mom, the challenges of finding any amount of time and the energy 
to exercise are tough. The following workout however is both effective and 
efficient. It should be done three times a week to begin and as you build in 
strength and stamina, you should increase the workout to five times a week. 

245
 Chapter 16: New Mommy and Me Core Workout
Adding a stroller walk with your baby is the perfect compliment to the 
following exercises. So on the in between days or the days you’re not doing 
this workout, you should try to walk with your baby in the stroller starting at 
10 minutes and work your way up to a full 30 minutes when you can. 
Before doing this new mom workout or any workout, you should warm up 
first to increase your circulation and get your blood pumping. I suggest 
five-to ten-minutes of low-level cardio to increase your core temperature and 
increase the flexibility of the muscles. Here are a few suggestions for warming 
up the body (if you have a few extra minutes to spare and want a really great 
warm-up, head to Chapter 4 for a few ideas):
 
✓ Walk on a treadmill for ten minutes at a slow to moderate pace.
 
✓ Jump rope for five minutes.
 
✓ Get on a stationary bike for ten minutes.
 
✓ Walk outdoors with your baby, starting with a slow pace and working up 
to a faster pace.
 
✓ Swim for half a mile.
 
Warming up your body increases the temperature of your muscles, which 
reduces the risk of injury.
Lying pelvic tilt
Pelvic tilts done lying down loosen up your hips and core area and get your 
circulation flowing so everything moves more freely. You can take your time 
with this movement — and don’t forget to breathe!
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Make 
sure your spine is in the neutral position, and place your hands at 
your sides (see Figure 16-1a).
 
2. Slowly exhale as you roll your hips forward or toward the ceiling, 
until your lower back is pressed flat on the floor.
 
3. Inhale as you return to starting position, then roll your hips backward 
until your lower back arches slightly (see Figure 16-1b).
 
4. Repeat ten times.

Make sure that you do the following with this exercise:
 
✓ Focus on moving just your lower back, not your thighs.
 
✓ Go only to the point of feeling good without straining — don’t tilt or hold 
the movement too long.
 
✓ Keep your breathing steady and strong — don’t hold your breath.
Beginning side plank
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your left side, propping up your body on your left elbow. Place 
your elbow directly beneath your shoulder. Bend both of your knees 
at a 90-degree angle, stacking your thighs on top of one another (see 
Figure 16-2a).
 
 Place your right hand on the floor in front of your body for support. 
Ensure that your body from your head down to your toes is in a 
straight line, with a neutral spine.

2. Lift your hips so that your torso comes off the ground and your body 
is in a straight line from your head to your knees. Try to hold this 
position for 15 to 30 seconds (see Figure 16-2b).
 
3. Repeat three times.

With the side plank, remember to follow these tips:
 
✓ Pull in your abdominal muscles for support.
 
✓ Avoid letting your hips drop toward the ground.
 
✓ Keep your breathing steady and strong — don’t hold your breath.
Postpartum bridge
The bridge — specifically, this postpartum version — works the hips, abdom-
inals, and lower back, better known as your core. Be sure to use a smaller 
range of motion — don’t lift your hips too high off the ground, to avoid stress 
on your lower back.

248
Part V: Special Situations 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie flat on your back, with your knees bent and feet hip-width apart 
and flat on the floor. Place your hands on the floor at your sides. 
Keeping the spine neutral, pull your belly button in toward your spine 
(see Figure 16-3a).
 
2. Slowly lift your hips toward the ceiling, allowing your butt and lower 
back to lift up toward the ceiling and off the floor (see Figure 16-3b).
 
 Hold for three to five seconds.
 
3. Slowly lower your hips again, allowing your back to return to neutral 
position.
 
4. Repeat ten times.
To avoid creating a bridge that gets you nowhere, keep these tips in mind:
 
✓ Pull in your abdominal muscles for support.
 
✓ Maintain a neutral spine.
 
✓ Breathe! Don’t hold your breath.
Bicycle
Hands down, this exercise is my favorite for new moms because it targets the 
waist, obliques (muscles that run down the side of the waist), and abs. The 
twisting and pulling motion you do with your knees and upper body is per-
fect for getting your core back in shape fast!
How fast should I lose the baby weight?
So what is realistic at this stage in the game? 
I’ve found that losing 2 pounds a week is real-
istic and safe (if you’re breast-feeding, it’s 2 
1⁄2 
pounds a month). Two pounds a week ensures 
that the skin retracts or tightens and doesn’t sag. 
And if you gained more than 35 pounds while 
you were pregnant, you need to allow an extra 
month of exercising and eating less or maintain-
ing portion control for each additional 5 pounds 
of weight that you gained. So if you gained 45 
pounds, you should achieve your goal and regain 
your pre-pregnancy weight around month nine 
or ten. Remember, it took nine months to grow 
your baby, so it will take at least that much time 
to regain your pre-pregnancy figure.
Most important of all, keep in mind that your 
ultimate goal is not only to lose the baby weight, 
but also to tone and tighten the areas that were 
stretched out during pregnancy and delivery.

To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and thighs perpendicular to 
the floor. Place your fingers just behind your ears (see Figure 16-4a).
 
2. Lift your shoulders off the floor as you straighten the right leg and 
bring the left knee in toward your right armpit. Without relaxing the 
torso or returning your shoulders to the floor, repeat on the other side 
by straightening the left leg and pulling the right knee in toward the 
left armpit (as shown in Figure 16-4b).
 
3. Alternate the legs in a slow bicycling movement 15 times on each side.
Consider a few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 
✓ Pull in your abdominal muscles for support.
 
✓ Avoid allowing your hips to drop toward the ground.
 
✓ Keep your breathing steady and strong — don’t hold your breath.

Crunch (postpartum)
The simplest way to regain strength in your core and endurance is to do 
crunches. However, you want to progress slowly. Consider a few ideas on 
how to do that:
 
✓ First try doing crunches with your arms outstretched, reaching your 
hands toward your knees.
 
✓ Second, try doing crunches with your arms across your chest (as 
shown here).
 
✓ Finally, you can do crunches with your hands placed behind your head 
and neck for support.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back, with your knees bent and hands crossed in front of 
your chest. Your feet should be flat on the ground (see Figure 16-5a).

251
 Chapter 16: New Mommy and Me Core Workout
 
 Be sure to keep a space between your chin and chest as you’re look-
ing up toward the ceiling.
 
2. Raise your chest until your shoulder blades lift off the floor (as shown 
in Figure 16-5b).
 
3. Slowly lower back to the floor.
 
4. Repeat five to ten times, gradually progressing to more repetitions 
when you feel comfortable.

Get your crunch correct by following these tips:
 
✓ Don’t use your hands and arms to help lift you; use your abdominals.
 
✓ Keep your abdominals pulled in toward your spine throughout the 
entire movement.
 
✓ Don’t raise your head and shoulders more than just off the ground.

252
Part V: Special Situations 
Push-up on knees
Push-ups on your knees are a good way to regain strength in your belly and 
core area. You can progress to push-ups on your toes as you get stronger, 
but always keep in mind that your back should remain straight and should 
not buckle from the weight of your body.
 
Keeping your knees on the ground with a towel beneath them will ease the 
harshness of the floor and provide more support for your joints.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Kneel on your knees and place your hands shoulder-width apart on 
the floor in front of you (as shown in Figure 16-6a).
 
 Make sure that your hands are directly below your shoulders on the 
floor.
 
2. Lower the upper body toward the floor, bending your elbows out to 
the side (see Figure 16-6b).
 
3. Straighten your elbows and exhale as you press back up into starting 
position.
 
4. Complete ten repetitions.

Here’s what you need to remember for this exercise:
 
✓ Keep your abdominal muscles tight, to maintain your weight.
 
✓ Use proper breathing, inhaling as you lower and exhaling as you press 
back up.
 
✓ Keep your back straight and in line with your head and the rest of your 
body. Don’t arch your back.
Mommy and Me Moves: Fun 
Stuff to Do with Your Baby
The following series of core exercises is so much fun to do with your baby. 
Finding time to work out after giving birth is so hard — now you have no 
excuse not to! Just grab a front baby carrier or a sling, and get to work with 
your little one.
Baby hip bridge
Hip bridges are so fun to do with your baby ’cause you get the interaction 
of looking at your little one as you use him for resistance! Your baby will 
love the slow up-and-down motion used in this exercise — and you’ll feel the 
burn, too!
 
1. Lie down on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. 
Sit your baby on your hips, resting his back against your thighs. 
Gently hold him in position (shown in Figure 16-7a).
 
 Be sure to engage your abs by pulling your belly button toward your 
spine, and press your weight down through your heels.
 
2. Slowly lift your hips off the floor by squeezing your butt and engaging 
your abs (see Figure 16-7b). Your body should be in a straight line 
from your knees to your shoulders.
 
3. Slowly return to starting position.
 
4. Do 10 to 15 repetitions.

Get hip to the following tips for this exercise:
 
✓ Make sure that your baby is totally secure during all movements.
 
✓ Try the movement without your baby first, to see if it’s doable for you.
 
✓ Avoid letting your butt touch the ground in between lifts if you want to 
increase the level of difficulty.
Crunch with baby
Ah, yes, the ab crunch — another one of my favorite exercises to do with 
baby. You can play peek-a-boo as you lift your shoulders up and down off the 
floor in this exercise, and your baby will crave more — maybe before you do!
 
1. Lie down on the floor or a mat with your knees bent and feet flat on 
the floor. Sit your baby on your hips, resting her back against your 
thighs. Gently hold her in this position (see Figure 16-8a).
 
 Engage your abs by pulling your belly button toward your spine.

255

2. Hold on to your baby and raise your chest until your shoulder blades 
lift off the floor (see Figure 16-8b).
 
3. Slowly lower back to the floor.
 
4. Complete 10 to 15 repetitions.

While doing crunches with your baby, be sure to follow these tips:
 
✓ Keep one hand on your baby at all times.
 
✓ Stop this exercise if it feels too strenuous.
 
✓ Avoid raising your shoulders off the ground more than just slightly.
Reverse crunch with baby
I also call this the airplane exercise because when you put your baby on your 
shins, you can gently roll from side to side like an airplane with wings. It’s a 
fun exercise to do and a great core workout when you lift your baby up and 
down using his weight for resistance.

256
Part V: Special Situations 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lay your baby prone (belly down) on your shins so they’re facing you 
while you lie on your back. Hold on to your baby with your hands to 
keep him secure (see Figure 16-9a).
 
2. Keeping your knees bent and your feet off the floor, engage your 
abdominal muscles by pulling your belly button in toward your spine.
 
3. Pull your knees toward your chest, focusing on your abdominals as 
you hold on to your baby tightly in an airplane position (see Figure 
16-9b).
 
4. Slowly lower your hips and legs back to the starting position, to 
complete one rep.
 
5. Aim for one to three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions.

For this exercise, remember to do the following:
 
✓ Make sure that baby is totally secure in all movements.
 
✓ Start out very slow, lifting your shins only slightly.
 
✓ Keep the pace slow and steady — don’t lose control of the motion or use 
momentum.

 Chapter 16: New Mommy and Me Core Workout
Plank with baby
The plank with your baby lying underneath you really makes you work your 
core because you won’t want to fall on your baby! Be sure to stay strong and 
lifted, and maintain a long, straight back during this exercise.
 
Be sure to stay lifted during the plank exercise so you don’t fall on the baby. 
If you don’t feel strong enough yet to support your full body weight, just keep 
your knees on the floor and straighten your forearms. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Kneeling over your baby with your knees and forearms on the floor, 
keep your elbows directly below your shoulders. Your feet should be 
touching or no more than an inch apart.
 
2. Lift your body on your forearms and toes, keeping your body as 
straight as possible. Maintain this position for as long as possible; 
challenge yourself as you build up to longer periods in the plank 
position (see Figure 16-10).
 
3. Hold the position for 10 to 15 seconds in the beginning, working your 
way up until you can hold the position for longer.
Not only should you avoid pooping out while doing the plank, but you should 
also remember these tips:
 
✓ Keep your back long and straight.
 
✓ Avoid allowing your hips or knees to drop toward the floor.
 
✓ Breathe steady and engage your abs.

Lunge with baby in carrier
This exercise uses a front baby carrier or sling. Plus, you can hold on to a wall 
or chair for additional balance, if you need to. Lunges work to strengthen your 
core, butt, and hips as you press back up to a standing position. Adding the 
weight of your baby makes for great resistance and a more intense workout.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Standing tall with your abs engaged to support you and your baby, 
step your right leg forward and left leg back so there’s a wide distance 
between your feet (see Figure 16-11a).
 
2. Lower toward the floor by bending both knees. Your front knee 
should bend at a 90-degree angle with the ankle directly below it. 
Your back knee should lower straight down toward the floor (as 
shown in Figure 16-11b).
 
3. Push back up to the starting position to complete one rep.
 
4. Complete 10 to 15 repetitions on each side.

 Chapter 16: New Mommy and Me Core Workout
Remember these hints for this exercise:
 
✓ Keep your movements straight up and down — don’t lean forward while 
lunging.
 
✓ Widen the stance between your legs if you have trouble maintaining 
your balance.
Plie squat with baby
Plies are a great way to strengthen your core and abdominals, and tighten up 
your inner thighs. Because safety should always be your main concern for 
you and your baby, make sure that your baby is totally secure in all move-
ments. If any exercise is too strenuous with your baby, try it without her.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart and your knees 
slightly bent, with your toes turned outward (see Figure 16-12a).
 
 Make sure your knees and toes are pointing in the same direction. 
Engage your abs by pulling them in and standing tall.
 
2. Press straight down until your thighs are almost parallel to the floor 
(as shown in Figure 16-12b).
 
 Make sure your knees don’t reach past your toes.
 
3. Squeeze your butt as you straighten your legs back to starting posi-
tion, to complete one rep.
 
4. Complete 10 to 15 repetitions.
Plie away with these tips:
 
✓ Keep your knees pressed out, to strengthen your inner thighs even 
more.
 
✓ Keep your toes pointed forward at all times.
 
✓ Keep your spine straight and long — don’t lean forward.

Squat with baby
This exercise uses a front baby carrier, or you can hold your baby securely 
in your arms. Safety should always be your main concern, so make sure 
that your baby is totally secure in all of the following movements. Using the 
weight resistance of your baby makes the squat more intense and helps you 
get a better rear view!
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart. Toes and knees 
should be pointing forward. Engage your abdominals and stand tall.
 
2. Slowly lower your butt toward the ground and bend at your hips as if 
you were going to sit back in a chair. Keep your weight in your heels 
and your back as upright as possible (see Figure 16-13a).
 
3. Straighten your legs and come back up to the starting position (refer 
to Figure 16-13b).
 
4. Complete 10 to 15 repetitions.

What’s in a core?
What people used to refer to as their midsec-
tion is now better known as the core. Your core 
is made up of the deep abdominal and back 
muscles that work as stabilizers for the entire 
body. These muscles are referred to as “deep” 
muscles because you can’t see them. Still, 
these muscles are responsible for maintaining 
the body’s core stability.
The three muscles in the core, or midsection or 
trunk, of the body are the transverse abdomi-
nus, multifidus, and quadratus lumborum. These 
muscles work together to protect the spine and 
to help with everyday activities, such as lifting, 
throwing, bending, reaching, and running. So 
you can see why keeping the stabilizer muscles 
well conditioned is extremely important.

Exercises for Kids to Help 
Build Core Strength
In This Chapter
▶ Defining fit kids
▶ Getting tips for working out with your kids
▶ Putting your kids through their paces with exercises they’ll love
▶ Pairing up for circuit training
K
ids are like mini video cameras — they imitate everything they see. My 
two-year-old always seems to find my weights, no matter where I put 
them, and drags them out to play. My friend suggested that instead of trying on 
my shoes, my daughter plays with my fitness equipment because they are my 
tools — she sees me exercising so she wants to exercise, too. So exercising in 
front of your kids sets a good, healthy example that they can follow. However, 
you don’t really want your five-year-old training with you for that triathlon 
coming up next summer — such training is a bit much (okay, a lot much!) for 
a youngster, but core training is perfectly adaptable and positively fun for 
children to do.
In this chapter, I offer a few exercises kids love to do that will help them 
acquire the basic skills needed to exercise and play sports. The exercises in 
this chapter also help them build a strong back and develop good abdominal 
muscles for life! Because children are naturally active no matter where they are 
(especially in the car), it’s important to encourage them to enjoy exercise and 
have fun doing it whether they’re at the beach or right in your own backyard. 
Parents can help by getting children involved in fitness at a young age. It really 
is one of the best things you can do to establish a lifetime of healthy activity. 

264
Part V: Special Situations 
 
Parents, I assure you this workout is anything but a waste of time for you. 
Many of the exercises I include in this chapter for your kids I also use for adult 
workouts in other sections of this book. With a little modification (speeding 
things up a bit), you can get a great workout and have so much more fun 
doing it alongside your kids. And maybe your kids will even challenge you to 
try something new and fun. I also designed the last two exercises in this chap-
ter to be done with a partner, which makes them even more fun and challeng-
ing for children. Pairing up with brothers and sisters, cousins, and yes — even 
parents, helps to not only pass the time but, more importantly, gets every-
body in good shape while they’re having fun. What a great message to send to 
your kids and to reinforce for yourself: that doing things together, even exer-
cising, can be fun as well as help you and your family reap the benefits of good 
health that will last a lifetime. 
Getting the Facts on Kids’ Fitness
Here are some facts and guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics:
 
✓ Kids should get no more than two hours of television or computer time 
a day.
 
✓ Boys should take 13,000 steps a day while girls should take 11,000. 
 
✓ For children 7 to 12 year olds who did not meet the recommendations, 
they were three to four times more likely to be overweight than the 
other children in their class and age category who met the guidelines.
The following are tips and guidelines from the IDEA Health and Fitness 
Association on what your kids should be doing at different ages to help 
parents get children involved in exercise at any age:
 
✓ Children ages two to five need to learn basic movements and skills 
such as:
 
• Catching
 
• Rolling
 
• Bouncing
 
• Kicking
 
• Tossing a ball
 
• Running
 
• Hopping 
 
• Skipping
 
• Pedaling a tricycle
 
• Galloping

265
 Chapter 17: Exercises for Kids to Help Build Core Strength
 
✓ Children ages five to seven: At this age, children should be using basic 
motor skills that help build complex movements like hitting a ball with 
a bat and jumping over some stationary objects. They can also play 
harder and longer that younger kids which means they are now able to 
improve their level of fitness. Children at this age may become inter-
ested in team or group sports but not at a competitive level. 
 
✓ For children ages 8 to 12: Children at this age can now participate in 
team sports more effectively and continue to grow in their fitness level. 
However, kids at this age lack the hormones needed for large muscle 
development. A decline in kids’ activity usually begins at this age due 
to puberty and a feeling of self-consciousness when other kids start 
developing at different rates. Some different activities are walking a mile 
and keeping a log book of how fast they go, and strength training under 
the correct supervision. Building a strong body improves a child’s self-
esteem at this age and helps improve their attitude. 
 
✓ For children ages 10 to 12: Children at this age continue team sports 
and group activities as well as begin to participate in individual activi-
ties like swimming, skating, and walking. Major hormonal changes 
are occurring, which make children feel awkward both physically and 
socially, determining what activities they become involved in. Best to 
look for classes that focus on varying levels of development like begin-
ner, intermediate, and advanced rather than chronological age because 
of the different rates of maturity that are occurring. 
Taking in Some Tips on Working 
Out with Your Kid
Most kids like to really go for it when they first try something new — like 
throwing themselves down a slide at break-neck speed or riding their bike 
down a hill! You have to love and admire that kind of enthusiasm. However, 
you have to rein in that enthusiasm until you’re confident that your kids are 
safely performing each move. In the spirit of making things go as smoothly 
as possible the first time out, here are a few important workout tips that you 
and your kids need to know before they get started:
 
✓ Make sure you monitor your kids the first few times they try the 
exercises until you feel confident they are using proper form and get the 
hang of it. 
 
✓ Make sure that your kids follow the instructions in this chapter 
thoroughly.
 
✓ Be sure they use a slow and steady motion when doing each exercise 
until they become pros at it — which, for kids, means at least once or 
twice because they pick things up so much quicker than we do!

266
Part V: Special Situations 
 
✓ Make sure they don’t hold their breath during the exercises. Holding 
their breath won’t help them perform the exercises any better and will 
only leave their little lungs short of oxygen!
 
✓ Have them perform each exercise without straining or injuring 
themselves.
Working Your Kid’s Core 
The following exercises are fun moves your kids can do to help them develop 
some basic skills and start building core strength. You can do these moves 
with your kids or just watch them to make sure they’re performing them 
correctly the first few times. Be sure to do the following exercises wherever 
you have enough space to move around…in your living room or even better, 
outside while you get some fresh air. 
Froggy jumps
Although the object of this exercise is to warm up your entire body at once, 
this exercise comes with a bonus — at least for parents. Kids love this exer-
cise, and they love to do it outside. So kids can jump the entire length of the 
backyard and be ready to go to bed early! To do this exercise, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart and crouch down, bending your knees 
out to the side (as shown in Figure 17-1a).
 
 Place your hands on the floor in front of you for support.
 
2. Jump up pushing through your heels like a frog, using your hands for 
an extra push.
 
 Be sure to straighten your legs fully at the top of the jump (refer to 
Figure 17-1b).
 
3. Return your heels and hands back down to starting position before 
beginning another froggy jump.
 
 Complete 10 to 15 repetitions.
 
Try traveling or moving across the floor and back doing froggy jumps.
When you do this exercise, remember to
 
✓ Keep your back straight as you jump up in the air.
 
✓ Avoid hunching over while you jump.

Jumping jacks
Jumping jacks are a great way to warm up your core and strengthen it. By lift-
ing your arms above your head and lowering them back down, you get a nice 
workout for your back and waist along with your abdominals and shoulders.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand tall with your feet together and arms down by your sides. Jump 
your legs shoulder-width apart as you raise your arms above your 
head (as shown in Figure 17-2a). 
 
2. Jump your legs back together as you bring your arms back down 
along your sides (refer to Figure 17-2b).
 
3. Jump to the rhythm — out, in, out, in, out, in.
 
 Repeat for 10 to 15 repetitions.
Here are some things to keep mind for this exercise:
 
✓ Straighten your legs as you jump in and out.
 
✓ Keep your knees soft and unlocked — don’t lock your knees.
 
✓ Keep the rhythm — in, out, in, out. Don’t let your arms and legs get out 
of sync with each other.

Push-ups on knees
Push-ups on your knees are a good way to gain strength in your belly and 
core area. (Using a mat or towel helps to cushion knees from the ground.) 
Kids can progress to push-ups with straight legs as they get stronger. 
 
Whenever adults or kids do push-ups with straight legs, their back should 
remain straight and not buckle in or dip from their body weight.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Kneel on your knees and place your hands a little wider than shoulder 
width on the floor in front of you (as shown in Figure 17-3a).
 
 Make sure that your hands are directly below your shoulders on the floor. 
 
2. Lower toward the floor with the upper body, bending your elbows out 
to the side (see Figure 17-3b).
 
 Try leading with your chest instead of your head or hips to make the 
move easier. 
 
3. Straighten your elbows and exhale as you press back up into starting 
position.
 
 Complete ten repetitions.

You can perform proper push-ups when you:
 
✓ Keep your abdominal muscles tight to help you maintain your weight 
and keep your back from sagging.
 
✓ Use proper breathing, inhaling as you lower and exhaling as you press 
back up.
 
✓ Keep your back straight and in line with your head and the rest of your 
body — don’t arch your back.
 
✓ Don’t allow your head to drop or look up to keep your neck in proper 
alignment with the rest of your body. 
Bicycles
Bicycles are the best exercise to work your abs or tummy muscles. The 
twisting and pulling motion you do with your knees and upper body is 
perfect for getting your core in shape fast and is a lot of fun for kids and 
adults to do. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:

Part V: Special Situations 
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and thighs perpendicular to 
the floor. Place your fingers just behind your ears (see Figure 17-4a).
 
2. Lift your shoulders off the floor as you straighten the right leg and 
bring the left knee in toward your right armpit.
 
3. Without relaxing the torso or returning your shoulders to the floor, 
repeat on the other side by straightening the left leg and pulling the 
right knee in toward the left armpit (as shown in Figure 17-4b).
 
4. Alternate the legs in a slow bicycling movement ten times on each side.

✓ Allow your hips to drop down toward the ground by keeping your abs 
tight — don’t arch you back.
 
✓ Keep your breathing steady and strong — don’t hold your breath.
 
✓ Keep your elbows pointed out to the side — make sure that you don’t 
allow your elbows to pull forward.

Pairing Up for Exercise — Family Style
The next two exercises are extra fun because you do them with a play date, 
sibling, or parent. You’ll see how fun it is for all your family members to sit 
on each other’s feet and cheer them on as you try the following paired-up 
exercises. You can even make a little game out of these exercises by setting 
up a little circuit in your backyard like the following:
 
1. Do some jumping jacks to warm up your body.
 
2. Move onto ball passing for one minute.
 
3. End with sit-ups holding each others’ feet for one minute.
Ball passing 
Ball passing is a good way to help tighten your tummy muscles as you pass 
the ball back and forth between each other. This exercise also teaches the 
importance of teamwork, an important skill that everyone needs to take 
advantage of.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand across from your partner a little farther than arms’ length away.
 
2. Using both your hands, pass a volleyball, basketball, soccer ball, or 
any ball that can be passed comfortably between you and your part-
ner at chest level (as shown in Figure 17-5a).
 
 Remember to pass the ball — not throw it hard — at your partner!
 
 The ball will be at chest level when you are passing it between each 
other.
 
3. Keeping your feet planted on the floor, continue passing the ball back 
and forth in a smooth fashion (refer to Figure 17-5b).
 
 Complete 10 to 15 repetitions.
Try not to forget these important tips while passing the ball:
 
✓ Use your tummy muscles to pass the ball back and forth.
 
✓ Keep your back straight and stand tall — don’t let your back arch away.

Sit-ups: holding feet
These sit-ups work your tummy and back muscles and build strength in 
your legs. Sit-ups can be more fun to do if you count them out loud as you’re 
performing them so it feels like you’re coaching your partner through the 
exercise instead of just counting. 
 
Pairing up different age groups for this exercise is fun because you can make a 
contest out of the exercise by seeing who can do the most sit-ups. Sometimes 
it’s a little easier to have someone older than you hold your ankles or sit on 
your feet too. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1.  Lie on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor as your 
partner holds your ankles or tops of your feet down (as Figure 17-6a 
shows).
 
 Your hands will be behind your ears with your elbows pointing out to 
the sides to support your neck.

2. Tightening your stomach muscles, sit up straight and hold for a few 
seconds before returning back down to the floor (refer to Figure 
17-6b).
 
3. Lie back down with a flat back completely on the ground before 
beginning the movement again.
 
 Complete 10 to 15 repetitions.

Follow these tips for sit-up success:
 
✓ Use an exercise mat to cushion your back.
 
✓ Keep your head supported with your hands when you perform the 
sit-up; otherwise, you risk straining your neck.

▶ Figuring out your core exercise limitations
▶ Understanding guidelines on exercise as you age
▶ Determining the right amount of weight for core-strengthening exercises
▶ Knowing the right forms of exercise you need to stay fit and healthy
P
eople over age 65 represent the most rapidly growing group in the 
population (yes, baby boomers!), and the degrees of health and fitness 
of the people in this age group vary wildly. Nevertheless, when it comes to 
exercising and keeping a strong core, it is essential for seniors to strengthen 
the core muscles to help prevent falls and maintain independence throughout 
the senior years. Exercise is a powerful tool that helps the body and mind stay 
forever young. Plus, research has proven that strengthening the core muscles 
of the body through specific core exercises can help decrease injuries and help 
maintain strength and stamina for a lifetime, which means, you don’t have to 
give in to aging any way but gracefully — and that’s good news, isn’t it?
 
Regular exercise is without a doubt one of the most important things you can 
do to keep your body functioning as smoothly as possible. It can’t turn back 
the clock, but it can slow it down considerably. 
Protecting Yourself with 
Exercise As You Age
Although you can do a lot to help make your life more active and easier as 
you age, the first and foremost is exercising. You need to do the following 
four specific types of exercise to stay young:
 
✓ Endurance: Exercises such as walking, speed walking, jogging lightly, 
swimming, or biking increase your heart rate, which helps build a strong 
heart and increases your stamina. Always start gradually, with only five 
minutes of any new activity at a given time until you work your way up 
to a full 30 minutes. 

276
Part V: Special Situations 
 
✓ Strength: Building your muscles increases your bone density and your 
metabolism, which is especially important for older adults because it 
not only helps to keep your weight down but also helps keep your blood 
sugar levels under control, which increase as you age.
 
✓ Balance: Building strong lower body and leg muscles helps prevent 
falls. Fractured knees, hips, and ankle joints become common as you age 
because bone mass begins to decrease. Working on your balance can 
help you from falling and prevent injuries.
 
✓ Stretching: Stretching allows you more freedom of movement as you age. 
The more freely you move, the better quality of life you’ll have so you can 
remain independent in your golden years. For even more information on 
stretching, check out my other book, Stretching For Dummies (Wiley).
Exercising Safely As a Senior
 Although you want your workouts to be challenging, you want to challenge 
yourself moderately to ensure that you’re working out safely. To keep your-
self challenged but safe while exercising, follow these guidelines:
 
✓ Talk to your doctor first. As with any new form of exercise, consult 
your doctor before you begin a workout program. Seniors with certain 
conditions, such as diabetes and coronary heart disease, may have 
to take a Graded Exercise Test (GXT) in which they get on a stationary 
bicycle or treadmill while their physician monitors their blood pressure 
and heart rate.
 
✓ Do moderate workouts for 30 to 60 minutes at least twice a week 
on nonconsecutive days. The American College of Sports Medicine 
suggests that seniors should follow this guideline, which basically 
means making sure that you have at least one full day of rest between 
workout sessions.
 
✓ Target all your major muscle groups during your twice-weekly workouts. 
 
✓ Do 10 to 15 repetitions of each exercise using a moderate level of 
intensity. A moderate level of intensity equals 70 percent of the amount 
of weight you can lift in a single effort. Making a 70 percent effort in your 
workout should feel challenging but not exhausting to your muscles or 
require labored breathing. In other words, exercising shouldn’t be 
painful in any way.
 
✓ Begin gradually and increase the number of repetitions over time as 
you get stronger. Because seniors are more prone to health concerns 
when working out, begin gradually using small movements with whatever 
exercise you choose to do and stop immediately if you feel fatigued or 
short of breath. Of course, for seniors who are severely out of shape, the 
less-is-more approach is always better because you can strain muscles 
and injure yourself by overdoing it.

277
 Chapter 18: Seniors Taking the Core Challenge
Tuning In to Training Guidelines 
for Seniors
When it comes to strength training as you age, you should follow these 
guidelines to ensure your workouts are safe as well as effective:
 
✓ Using weights or not: Depending on your level of fitness, it’s perfectly 
fine to start with no weights at all. Because starting with weights that 
are too heavy can cause injuries, using the resistance of your own body 
weight is a great way to start. As you build your strength and stamina, 
you’ll be able to progress to using weights — but do it gradually. Keep in 
mind, slow and steady wins the race!
 
✓ Adding weight: When you do begin adding weights to your strength 
workout, add a challenging amount of weight gradually. Just enough that 
you feel like you’re working out a bit harder than you were previously, 
because if you don’t challenge your muscles, you won’t get any stronger. 
Using one- to two-pound weights as you grow in strength and build a little 
muscle is a good way to enhance any strengthening program as your body 
adapts to the exercises.
 
✓ Getting the timing right: When you do begin lifting, use a slow three 
seconds to push your weight into place. Hold the position for only one 
second before taking three seconds to lower the weight back down to 
starting. And never let your weight drop! If you lower it slowly, you’ll 
get the maximum benefit and see your muscles grow stronger faster 
because that’s where the growth in the muscle takes place — on the 
downward part of the movement. 
 
✓ Adjusting your weight: It shouldn’t feel very hard to push your weight 
into place, but at the same time it should feel challenging. This part of 
the exercise is where listening to your body comes in handy. Stay in 
tune to what you’re doing and feeling throughout your workout so you 
can make adjustments in the amount of weight you’re using.
 
 The rule of thumb is: If you can’t lift your weight eight times in a row, 
then it’s too heavy and you should reduce the amount of weight you’re 
using. However, if you can lift the weight more than 15 times in a row, 
then it’s way too light for you so you need to increase the amount of 
weight you’re using.
 
✓ Doing reps and sets: After you’ve determined the right amount of weight 
that’s right for you, complete 8 to 15 repetitions in a row and then wait 
one minute before doing another set of 8 to 15 repetitions of the same 
exercise.
 
Always work up slowly and stop immediately if you feel light-headed or any 
type of pain.

Part V: Special Situations 
Core Routine to Help Maintain Balance
The following exercises are specifically designed to be accessible to 
anyone — even someone with physical limitations due to age or injury. None of 
these moves require you to get down on the ground or to assume complicated 
positions. These full-body exercises are simple and straightforward to help 
increase your range of motion, from your head to your toes.
Before you begin, remember these tips for keeping your balance:
 
✓ Ask someone to exercise along with you or just watch you the first few 
times (just in case you lose your balance).
 
✓ Use a chair or table or couch or other piece of heavy furniture for 
balance.
 
✓ Once you’re comfortable and steady, try using only one finger to hold 
on as you exercise. When you feel comfortable with one fingertip, try 
the following exercises without holding anything. Build your confidence 
slowly and take your time . . . and most of all, have fun!
Hip extension
Starting with the hips and lower back, this core strengthener is a good 
exercise to help keep you balanced. You can use a chair or the back of a 
couch for assistance — just like ballet dancers do when they warm up at a 
ballet barre. 
Buddy system
As you get older, losing your balance and your 
confidence when trying new things is easy 
to do. Having a workout partner can help you 
gain back your confidence and boost your 
self-esteem by having someone else to share 
in your enthusiasm about your new workout 
experience and help you avoid injury by having 
someone else around. And did I mention that 
exercising is just a lot more fun when you do 
it in pairs? It’s much easier to get motivated to 
go to the gym or simply leave the house and 
take a walk if you know someone is waiting and 
depending on you. So take your partner or pick 
a friend and use the buddy system when you 
exercise to help motivate you and keep you safe 
at the same time!

279
 Chapter 18: Seniors Taking the Core Challenge
 
1. Stand about a foot away from a chair and keep your feet slightly apart 
as you stand tall.
 
2. Bend forward at your hips until you’re at a 45-degree angle as you 
hold onto the chair for balance (as shown in Figure 18-1a).
 
3. Slowly extend or raise one leg behind you without bending your knee. 
Point your toe like a dancer and keep your upper body at a 45-degree 
angle with the floor. Don’t bend any farther when you raise your leg (see 
Figure 18-1b).
 
 Hold your leg and upper-body position for one second.
 
4.  Slowly lower your leg before repeating on the other side.
 
 Alternate your legs until you have done eight to ten repetitions on 
each side.
For the best results, when you do a hip extension:
 
✓ Keep your shoulder blades down and your upper body relaxed.
 
✓ Keep your back straight, not rounded.
 
✓ Keep your back gentle and slowly progress into a deeper stretch — 
don’t bounce or force the stretch.

Hip flexion
This exercise works the back, hips, and legs. It’s simple and effective for 
strengthening your core. The rule is: Any time you lift your leg or foot off the 
ground; you call on your core muscles to keep you from falling.
 
Try this with or without holding onto something . . . depending on your indi-
vidual level of fitness.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand up tall and as straight as possible. If you need to, hold onto a 
table or chair for balance (see Figure 18-2a). 
 
2. Slowly bend one knee up and toward your chest, without bending at 
your waist or hips. Your arms should be in the airplane position out to 
your sides for balance (see Figure 18-2b). 
 
 Once you become more advanced, you can place both hands on your hips. 
 
3. Hold your bent knee up for one second before slowly lowering your 
leg all the way down.
 
4. Repeat on the other leg.
 
 Alternate legs until you’ve completed eight to ten repetitions on each leg.

281
 Chapter 18: Seniors Taking the Core Challenge
The hip flexion exercise can be done effectively and safely as long as you:
 
✓ Keep your shoulders and hips facing forward and your knees slightly 
bent.
 
✓ Breathe through the exercise.
 
✓ Avoid holding the position if you feel tension or pain.
Side leg raises
Side leg raises work your lower back and hip muscles. Your legs will feel 
stronger from this core strengthener, too. You will need a chair or a heavy 
piece of furniture to hold onto for this exercise.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand up straight, directly behind a chair for support with your feet 
slightly apart (see Figure 18-3a).
 
2. Slowly lift one leg out to the side about 8 to 12 inches.
 
 Keep your back and both legs straight (as shown in Figure 18-3b).
 
 Keep your toes pointing forward during this exercise, and don’t let your 
leg turn out.
 
3. Slowly lower your leg back down to the ground before repeating with 
the other leg.
 
 Alternate legs until you’ve completed eight to ten repetitions on each leg.
 
It’s important that the chair is sturdy and stable (so don’t pick one that’s 
unbalanced or has wheels!).
When you do this exercise remember to:
 
✓ Keep your back straight at all times.
 
✓ Keep your butt squeezed and contracted — don’t tuck your pelvis under 
while you’re standing

Standing core release 
Using the back of a chair for support in the standing core release allows you 
to reach the waist (oblique muscles) and back muscles that are difficult to 
release without lying on the floor. You can feel the release in your back, abs, 
and even the top part of your hip.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with the back of your chair about a foot from your right side.
 
2. Place your right hand on the top of the back of the chair.
 
3. Stand with your feet about 12 inches or 1 foot apart, your knees 
slightly bent and your toes pointing forward (see Figure 18-4a).
 
4. Inhale and reach your left arm directly overhead with your palm 
facing inward.
 
 Use the muscles in your upper back to keep your shoulder blade down. 
This should keep space between your shoulder and ear.

283
 Chapter 18: Seniors Taking the Core Challenge
 
5. As you exhale, lean to the right, keeping your right hand on the back 
of the chair for support and your hip and leg anchored to the floor 
(see Figure 18-4b).
 
6. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or four to five slow, deep breaths.
 
7. Repeat on the other side.
 
If you notice tension in your shoulders, instead of reaching with a straight 
arm, keep your elbow bent. The movement should come from your waist, and 
not your shoulder.
You get the most from the standing core release if you:
 
✓ Keep your shoulders and hips facing forward and your knees slightly 
bent.
 
✓ Breathe through the stretch.
 
✓ Avoid holding the stretch if you feel tension or pain.

Seated Core Routine for Strong Abs 
The next three exercises modify some very popular abdominal and core 
exercises, making them perfect for older adults. The sit-up is done in a chair 
along with the core and spinal twist. All of these exercises are fun and still 
very effective when done seated!
Seated sit-up 
Doing seated sit-ups is a good way to work on your abdominals and lower 
back as well as your quadriceps, butt, and hamstrings without having to lie 
on the floor and do a sit-up! Actually, anyone can do this exercise; it’s not just 
for seniors. It helps you strengthen your core and helps you get up and down 
from a seated position without losing your balance.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Sit tall in a chair with your arms extended in front of you (see 
Figure 18-5a).
 
2. Tighten your abdominals before (pulling) pressing through with 
your heels as you straighten your legs and straighten up to a standing 
position (refer to Figure 18-5b).
 
3. Hold for a few seconds before sitting back down in the chair as you 
keep your core muscles tight and engaged to help you sit back down.
 
 Repeat eight to ten times.
The seated sit-up works your body best when you:
 
✓ Keep your back straight and your shoulder blades down.
 
✓ Keep your knees pointing forward — don’t let them flair out to the sides.
Seated core rotation
The biggest benefit to having strong lower-back muscles is that you’re less 
prone to injury. Now that’s good news for anyone, young or old. Both the 
seated core rotation and the seated core stretch (see “Seated core stretch,” 
below) benefit the abdominal and back muscle groups.

With these two exercises you increase the flexibility in your spine, which in 
turn helps prevent injuries and makes everyday movements easier.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
 
1. Sit up tall on a sturdy chair with your feet flat on the floor and close 
together, knees at a right angle.
 
2. Anchor your right hand on the side of the chair as you place your left 
hand on the outside of your right thigh (see Figure 18-6a).
 
3. Inhale and, as you exhale, twist your torso to the right and look back 
over your shoulder (see Figure 18-6b).
 
4. Hold the stretch for about ten seconds.
 
 Try to make a mental note of a stationary object you see that’s about at 
eye level.
 
5. Release and come back to center.
 
6. Inhale again, and as you exhale repeat on the opposite side.
 
 Find the same object you were looking at, but this time try to find 
another object that’s past it.

For the seated core rotation, remember to:
 
✓ Keep your feet flat on the floor.
 
✓ Keep your knees and feet together and facing the front.
 
✓ Find an object that’s at eye level — don’t look down.
Seated core stretch 
Tight chest muscles cause a lot of older adults to round their shoulders and 
hunch over. Increasing flexibility in the chest and upper body guarantees 
more freedom of movement as you age. Try this core exercise to help stretch 
out your chest and shoulders.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
 
1. Sit up tall on the front edge of a chair (see Figure 18-7a).
 
2. Reach behind your back with both arms and link your forearms (see 
Figure 18-7b).

287
 Chapter 18: Seniors Taking the Core Challenge
 
3. Inhale and as you exhale, squeeze your shoulder blades together.
 
4. Hold the pose for about 30 seconds or four to five slow, deep breaths.
 
5. Repeat the same exercise with the other hand on top.
 
If your range of motion is limited in your shoulders, and/or you feel pain or 
discomfort, try performing this core stretch one arm at a time. Instead of grab-
bing both elbows at the same time, reach only one arm across the midline of 
your back and with your other hand grab hold of your wrist or forearm.
Remember theses tips as you perform the seated core stretch:
 
✓ Keep your eyes looking forward.
 
✓ Maintain good posture throughout the stretch.
 
✓ Avoid allowing your back to arch when you squeeze your shoulder 
blades together.

Part V: Special Situations 
Should you exercise if you have arthritis?
The big question these days is, how much exer-
cise should you do if you’re diagnosed with 
arthritis? Generally, if you have a flare-up in a 
joint, that’s the time to rest and let your medica-
tion do its job. As the inflammation decreases 
and the pain subsides, you can gradually return 
to exercise. The key word is gradually. If you 
experience pain, that’s your cue to stop.
However, we’ve come a long way from the 
time when people believed that if they had 
arthritis they shouldn’t exercise. Now we know 
that exercise is an important part of treating 
the disease. Why? Because, if you don’t take 
care of the muscles that surround the joint, 
range of motion will be lost and stiffness and 
pain increase. The goal of people with arthritis 
should be to limit the progression of the existing 
damage in the affected joint or joints, which is 
most effectively accomplished by strengthen-
ing and stretching the muscles that surround 
the joints.
Arthritis is defined as inflammation of the joint 
or joints that is accompanied by swelling and 
pain which affects the spinal column, hips, 
ankles, and knee joints. Arthritis currently 
affects more than 40 million people, and within 
a year over a million more people will have it. 
Strength training alleviates arthritis symptoms 
and slows the aging process by building stron-
ger muscles, bones, and connective tissue. The 
American Heart Association recommends that 
for muscular strength and endurance, seden-
tary adults need to use strength training at least 
twice per week. Although aerobic exercise is 
great for improving your overall cardiovascular 
system, it doesn’t prevent your body from losing 
muscle tissue. To maintain muscle mass during 
seniorhood and to gain the relief you’re looking 
for from arthritis pain, you must perform exer-
cises with weights throughout the latter years 
of your life.
In addition to the arthritis information above, 
hip flexors, knees, and ankle joints can become 
stiff from being sedentary or leading an inac-
tive lifestyle. Exercise can relieve this stiffness 
by promoting greater flexibility and mobility in 
your joints and throughout your entire body. 
Remember to always consult your doctor before 
starting any new exercise program.

end with three of them. In Chapter 19, I list ten best ways 
to train your core, and in Chapter 20, I show you ten core-

Chapter 19
Ten Best Ways to 
Train Your Core
In This Chapter
▶ Getting on the ball
▶ Moving for core strength
▶ Stretching your muscles
A
 weak back is your body’s way of telling you that your abs are weak. 
Your back and abs go hand in hand — together they make up your core. 
Think of core training as preventive medicine that creates balance between 
your back and abs, and returns your body to its natural, pain-free state.
This chapter gives you ten fast and fun ways to shore up your core. You can 
do the exercises outdoors or with a partner to make them more interest-
ing and fun. Of course core training is only one tool in the battle against the 
bulge. You’ll want to increase your cardio and head to Chapter 20 to see how 
diet and nutrition can really make a big difference.
Balance It
Here’s an amazing exercise you can do with your exercise ball without even 
trying; you won’t even break a sweat! Sit on your exercise ball instead of in 
your office chair for just one hour a day and you’ll get tighter abs and a stron-
ger back! Just by sitting up straight and sucking in your tummy, you improve 
your core strength and your balance at the same time. To keep from falling 
off the ball, you have to keep your feet flat on the floor and pull your abs in 
tight. Because the ball is round, you can’t just plop yourself into it any old 
way like you can in a chair. See where I’m going with this? You’re forced to 
strengthen your core.

292
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Crunch It
One of the most effective methods for relieving belly fat and strengthening 
those abs is crunching them! Bringing your upper body to your lower body 
trains both the upper and lower parts of your abdominal muscles.
Here’s an easy yet effective crunch: Grab an exercise ball and lie on the floor 
with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place the ball between your 
ankles and bring your upper body to your lower body, or bring your knees to 
your elbows. This crunch works both your upper and lower abs and is much 
easier to do than a conventional ball sit-up.
For crunching it, I recommend the abs exercises I describe in the Chapter 6 
for a killer core workout. These core exercises are very effective for targeting 
your core and will help you focus on the midsection of your body.
Fix It with Cardio
The best prevention against tummy fat is to stay low in body fat — and that 
means less belly fat. Doing 60 minutes of cardio exercise at least three times 
a week helps you maintain a low percentage of body fat, which in turn helps 
your six-pack peek through.
Jumping rope for 5 to 10 minutes at a time does the trick (ever see a boxer with 
belly fat?) and also helps keep your joints flexible. Or you can use a mini-tram-
poline like the Reebok Rebounder to do cardio that also helps train your abs 
and back. As you perform small bounces on the trampoline, your circulation 
increases to help flush out fatty deposits in your legs and your belly area.
Other great forms of cardio are running sprints, doing jumping jacks, or 
performing other activities that get your heart rate elevated and can be 
done consistently for at least 30 minutes. In fact, try to work in 30 minutes 
of cardio a day, five days a week if a full 60 minutes, three days a week just 
doesn’t leave you enough time; you’ll get the same results. Remember, con-
sistency is the key!
Stretch It Out
Whether you lead a sedentary lifestyle or are an elite athlete, tight muscles in 
your abs, hips, back, and buttocks can put so much strain and stress on your 
lower back that the end result is low back pain. One solution that has been 
proven to be effective is regular stretching (see Stretching For Dummies by 
yours truly).

293
 Chapter 19: Ten Best Ways to Train Your Core
In this book, Chapter 14 gives you a ton of stretches for the core area (hips, 
abs, back, and butt), or if you’re feeling tightness in your lower back try the 
routine I laid out in Chapter 18 that is specifically designed to help relieve low 
back tightness and may be for seniors but can help anyone! Never forget — a 
healthy core is a strong and flexible back.
Walk It Out
If you want to banish belly fat and strengthen your core, but rigorous exer-
cise is the last activity you want to add to your routine, take a walk every 
night after dinner. 
Walking is the best form of exercise for getting rid of belly fat and training 
your core (and you’ll enjoy your neighborhood at the same time). When you 
take long strides, you work all the muscles that support your stomach, back, 
and pelvis. Plus walking is easy to do, and you only need to do it 30 minutes 
a day, five days a week. Trust me, it works better than skipping dessert 
(although that doesn’t hurt)!
Cycle Through It
When you’re cycling, you use your legs to spin the wheel and your 
abdominals and back muscles to push the pedals. Perfect for core training! 
Combining it with a few bicycle crunches (see Chapter 5) which helps target 
the same area by bringing your knees to your chest is a great way to work 
your core. In addition, you get the extra benefit of a cardio workout, which 
helps reduce belly fat.
A spinning class at a gym uses a stationary bike with a 40-pound wheel that 
allows you to increase and decrease the tension during the class. A spinning 
class burns more than 500 calories and takes biking to a whole new level. Try 
it; I know you’ll like it!
Plank It
The plank exercise is one of the best core strengthening exercise and can be 
found in several chapters of this book (see Chapters 5, 11, and 12). The plank 
position requires you to pull in your abs while you stay lifted in a push-up 
position with your glutes squeezed together and your back straight.

294
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The plank exercise energizes your entire body. It’s used in all yoga sun salu-
tations and other poses (see Chapter 12). It is also a Pilates-based exercise 
(see Chapter 11), which is used in many of Joseph Pilates’s exercises to help 
strengthen the core of the body. So next time you’re short on time, roll out of 
bed, drop down to the floor, and plank it!
Lengthen It
Any exercise that lengthens your core engages the muscles through stretch-
ing. In Chapters 11 and 12 of this book, the yoga and Pilates exercises use 
extending and lengthening exercises to help you achieve core definition.
Dancers always tend to look long and lean because they have great posture. 
They achieve this by having strong abdominal and back muscles. It all works 
hand in hand — strong abs, strong back, and good posture. It’s all good!
Suck It In
In many cases, people just aren’t in the habit of pulling in their tummies 
and sucking it in! To suck in your stomach, pretend you’re tightening a belt 
around your waist as you’re standing or sitting tall throughout the day. This 
technique gives you a visual reminder and helps you keep your stomach 
muscles tight and taut instead of letting them go slack!
Twist It
Twisting your core helps define your waist by working the obliques (muscles 
that run along the waist). The bicycle crunch I mentioned earlier (in Chapter 
5) is very effective for working this area, and that’s why I like it so much. Any 
exercise that twists your upper body requires strong abs and back muscles.
Sports that use a twisting motion include golf and baseball. In both of them, 
you have to twist to hit the ball. Both sports engage the core and help 
develop the kind of strength you need to be a good player. Think Tiger 
Woods!

E
xperts support the fact that calories (in excess) are what make you fat . . . 
duh! And because calories create the energy you need to get through your 
day, exercise is very important to burn them off. But just as in everything in 
life, moderation is the key! And the bottom line is, if you eat more calories than 
you burn off, you create an imbalance in your body and gain weight. It’s that 
simple!
So what is the key to limiting calories or practicing portion control? And 
how do you find the right balance between the foods you eat and the amount 
of energy you burn on a daily basis? In this chapter, I talk about these and 
other ways you can take control of your diet by reducing fatty foods, cutting 
back on carbs, drinking lots of water, and eating more of the right things like 
salads, lean protein, less dairy, less salt- and sugar-laden foods, and a few 
other tips that will help get you started on the path to a healthier you.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Reduce Fatty Foods
Basically, fats come in two kinds: one healthy (in moderation, of course) 
and one not so healthy. And because I’m an optimist, let’s start with the 
healthy fats.
Natural healthy fats, or “green light” fats, as I prefer to call them, are olive 
oil (my personal fave), nuts that are dry-roasted to preserve the healthy oils, 
avocado, and even canola oil. Interestingly, the body really can’t distinguish 
between a Snickers bar and a handful of nuts when it comes to calories. But it 
does know the difference when it comes to the nutritional value in these two 
items and how the body breaks them down.
Now for the unhealthy man-made stuff: trans fats and saturated fats.
Trans fats are anything man-made, like vegetable oil, which most desserts 
and baked goods contain. The best way to confirm that a fat is not a healthy 
choice is to leave it sitting out on the counter and watch it harden!
Saturated fats are animal fats, which are found in red meat and butter (darn). 
When you hear that something is high in saturated fat, you know to limit it or 
steer clear of it altogether.
Your body does need fat to function properly, though, and for healthy skin 
and nails. So when you buy a salad dressing — or anything else, for that 
matter — that contains fat, go natural and choose olive oil and vinegar 
instead of ranch. And, yes, choose guacamole instead of spinach and arti-
choke dip, because you never know how much fat is added to that. Yikes!
Cut Back on Carbs
Carb-free diets? No way. Eating only protein? Now that’s high in fat. As with 
fats, there are good carbs and bad carbs. And your body and your brain both 
need carbs to function properly. Without carbs, or carbohydrates, you would 
have no energy and would be listless.
Healthy carbs are anything made with whole grain: whole-grain pastas, rice, 
and, of course, breads. Now here’s where portion control comes in: You 
really shouldn’t eat more than two slices of whole-wheat bread or 1 cup of 
rice because it all adds up. Remember, we’re focusing on calories and trying 
to add them to your diet in the healthiest way possible. So do your math and 
eat a sandwich, but certainly not at the same time as the rice, silly!

297
 Chapter 20: Ten Core-Conscious Dietary Changes You Can Easily Make
Eat Lean Protein
Gotta have the protein — just not too much of it, and it’s gotta be lean. Lean 
proteins are white meats, like chicken and turkey. Fish is always a good 
choice, along with shellfish, for getting your daily protein. And if you choose 
salmon, tuna, or a few other types of fish that are off the beaten path (sar-
dines, yuck!), you’ll get your heart-healthy fats, better known as omega-3 fatty 
acids. You can also take omega-3 supplements in pill form, but I think it’s 
always best to get it from your diet naturally.
Veal, pork (the other white meat), and beef are also good choices for lean 
proteins. But look for leaner cuts that have less than 5 percent fat (which 
means they’re 95 percent lean cuts).
When it comes to serving size, I usually use the palm of my hand to measure 
portions, but since there are many different palm sizes out there, the rule of 
thumb (no pun intended) is 8 ounces or 1 cup of lean protein three times a day.
You can also choose veggie proteins, like beans and soy products. Both of 
these offerings taste fantastic and are very high in protein — plus they’ll keep 
your core looking lean and mean!
Say Bye-Bye to Dairy
Bad cheese, good soy! Bad sour cream, good yogurt. Maybe I’ve been around 
kids too long, but I’m giving you the CliffsNotes version of my shopping list. 
And I love cheese! But all that great French brie adds up and is fattening, as 
you know by now from reading the previous segment on fats, because it hard-
ens when you leave it sitting out on the counter (darn, again).
However, if you start reading labels and make some smart choices, like drink-
ing 1 percent milk and eating plain yogurt or even no-sugar-added yogurt, you 
can keep some dairy in your diet and still get a healthy core. You just have to 
watch what they mix it with — usually fat or sugar. So do read those labels— 
and that’s an order!
Drink Fewer Margaritas
Alcohol raises cortisol levels, which is a hormone responsible for storing fat. 
And the kind of fat that cortisol regulates is belly fat! So if you want to have 
a strong core, you don’t want belly fat, right? You can still have a drink to 
celebrate a special occasion or just let loose once in a while, but you have to 
make smart choices.

298
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Consider this funny story: My friend went to a Weight Watchers meeting and 
told me she spoke for the first time on the very last night of the sessions. She 
stood up and said, “If you’re going to have a margarita, just skip the drink and 
have the shot of tequila instead!” Boy, is she right! The sugary high-caloric 
content of a margarita is astronomical, whereas a shot of 80-proof alcohol is 
only 1,000 calories. Now, of course, I’m not suggesting you use 200 calories 
on just alcohol, because you want to make smart choices for your core. Even 
better would be choosing a glass of wine, which is around 100 calories or a 
glass of beer, which is 150 calories. You may get to have only one, but I’ll bet 
you’ll enjoy it even more knowing that it must last you all night!
Just Say “No” to Sugary Soft Drinks
I find in a lot of hidden calories in people’s diets in soda. And unless you’re 
drinking Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi, you’re getting a ton of sugar and a ton of cal-
ories (Paris Hilton says diet soda is for fat people . . . yikes!). I have a simple 
solution for that: Replace soda with water! Yep, water has no calories and it 
is good for your core. The more water you drink, the more toxins and bad 
stuff you flush out of your system, and the more weight you lose. Drinking 
water is my number one fitness tip for my clients when we start working 
together. And it’s a lot cheaper than soda!
Try this fun tip at home (kids, leave this to your mom and dad): Try drinking 
your weight in ounces of water throughout the day. So let’s say you weigh 
120 pounds — you would want to drink 120 ounces of water from the time 
you wake up until the time you go to bed. You’ll feel less sluggish, save lots of 
money not buying soda, and spend lots of time going to the bathroom. Those 
three things I can guarantee because I’ve been there, done that! And it works.
Eat More Salads
I remember hearing Shaquille O’Neal say when someone asked him how he 
lost all his weight, “I ate a lot of salad.” I’ll bet he did, that big guy! But I’ll also 
bet he didn’t use much salad dressing, because that’s where all the hidden 
calories come from.
Salad is always a good option when you’re trying to trim your core. However, 
what you put on it can really make a difference. Some low-calorie offerings 
are pretty good these days, but it’s best to stick with lemon or vinegar with 
olive oil. Creamy dressings are always packed with fat and calories, which 
might make you eat more salad but cancels out the good you’re trying to 
accomplish by filling up with roughage.

299
 Chapter 20: Ten Core-Conscious Dietary Changes You Can Easily Make
Try adding dried legumes or beans, adding tuna with some garbanzo beans, 
or topping your salad with beets and carrots for some healthy options. Just 
be sure to skip the dressing, or you’ll look like Shaq — just not as tall!
Don’t Eat after 7 p.m.
You’ve probably heard that eating late helps pack on the pounds. If you’re 
eating every three to four hours throughout the day, as you should be, plus 
adding two to three snacks, you won’t be hungry later in the day anyway. 
If you do eat at night, you go to sleep on a full stomach, which slows your 
metabolism significantly and keeps you from getting a good night’s rest.
Breakfast is exactly what it’s named for: break the fast! Not eating after 7 
p.m. and waiting until you wake up in the morning gives your body a chance 
to rest and rejuvenate so you wake up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. That’s 
where the principle of eating a good breakfast comes in. If you don’t start 
your engine with something good in the morning, you’re running on empty 
all day and you aren’t giving your body the rest it needs. So start the day out 
right with a good, hot breakfast. Follow that with two more meals and three 
snacks, and you’ll be trimming your core all day long.
Snack on Fewer Salty Foods 
and More Fat-Free Pudding
Salt equals water retention, making you look puffy and doing nothing for your 
core except making you look bloated. And everything contains salt these 
days — especially many fat-free foods. How do you think they make these 
foods taste so good? They replace all that fat with two ingredients: salt and 
water. Have you ever tried cooking with low-fat margarine? When the pan 
heats up, the water runs to one side of the pan while the “fat” pools in the 
middle. Well, that’s the secret to many fat-free foods — extra salt for taste 
and extra water to dilute the fat. Now instead of doing something good for 
yourself, you’re actually consuming extra sodium and calories that you don’t 
have to.
Snacking on fat-free chocolate pudding instead of salty chips, and eating 
microwave popcorn (without extra butter) are healthier choices you can 
make for your core. No hidden calories there — and no bloating!

300
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Drink Lots of H2O
As I mentioned earlier in reference to sugary soft drinks, water is the answer 
for flushing out the toxins and extra fluids your body is holding on to. It 
seems strange, but the more water you drink, the less your body retains.
Consider these guidelines for drinking water daily:
 
✓ Drink 80 ounces (eight glasses) of water daily. Drinking water enlarges 
the cells in your body, so it makes you feel full! Because you’re less 
hungry, you eat less.
 
✓ Drinking a glass of water before or along with meals is another good 
option to fill you up.
 
✓ Water reduces muscle soreness by helping to flush out the lactic 
acid that builds up in your muscles from strenuous exercise. Drinking 
water helps replenish the water content in your body and serves as 
a checks-and-balances system to make sure everything is operating 
smoothly. You’ll be taking a lot more trips to the bathroom, but at 
least you’ll be going!
Jumping rope flushes out water!
Jumping rope for ten minutes three times a 
week is one of the most effective ways to 
improve cardiovascular fitness and reduce cel-
lulite. In one of my other books, Lose That Baby 
Fat (M. Evans and Company, Inc.), I mention that 
one study suggests that you can improve over-
all physical fitness in as little as five minutes a 
day.
Women especially will appreciate of the ben-
efits of jumping rope because it reduces cellu-
lite and creates more shapely calves. Tired and 
weak joints get a boost as well. Fifteen minutes 
spent jumping rope translate into 200 fewer 
calories to worry about, which is the equiva-
lent number lost on a 30-minute run. Plus, when 
done properly, skipping rope is kinder to your 
knees and hips than running.

Chapter 21
Ten Household Items You Can Use 
to Help Improve Core Strength
In This Chapter
▶ Being spontaneous with your core exercises
▶ Exercising with everyday items
Y
ou already know exercise is important, but it’s also extremely helpful to 
do a little bit each day. Why? Because frequent exercise, even in small 
amounts, provides several crucial benefits:
 
✓ Maintains your fitness level: Even when you’re short on time or you 
missed your workout, performing calisthenics or a few simple exercises 
throughout the day helps maintain your fitness level that you’ve worked 
so hard to achieve.
 
✓ Energizes you: When you need an energy boost and there’s no coffee or 
chocolate in sight, try a jumping jack or two to get oxygen to your brain. 
You’ll feel great, and you’ll skip the calories!
 
✓ Relieves minor aches and pains: Exercise relieves the stress created 
by inactivity or repetitive motions by increasing your circulation and 
keeping oxygen flowing to sore muscles.
So any time can be the right time to exercise when you’re at home. And 
believe it or not, your home is full of core-strengthening aids. The rest of the 
chapter points out common items you can use in your fitness routine. Now 
you really have no excuse not to stretch!
A Chair from Your Kitchen
Sitting in a chair too long and too often doesn’t loosen and relax your muscles; 
it actually shortens certain muscles, such as your hamstrings, hip flexors, and 
calves. Nevertheless, a chair can be a very useful and effective prop for exercis-
ing. And I bet you have a chair in just about every room of the house.

302
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
In Chapter 18, you’ll see a series of exercises that can be done with a chair 
including the seated sit-up. To do this exercise, sit in a chair and extend your 
arms out in front of you. Now rise to a standing position. Notice how you’re 
forced to use your core. Pause for a moment before sitting back down in the 
chair. Repeat 10 to 15 times.
 
Be careful, especially at work, that you don’t use a chair with wheels. You can 
use any type of chair, as long as it’s sturdy and stable.
A Beam or Rafter in Your House
Just like in the movie Rocky, you can hang from an open beam in your house 
or garage to do a pull-up. At first you’ll probably only be able to hold yourself 
up for a few seconds, but as your grip gets stronger, you’ll be able to chin-up 
or pull yourself up to really feel the strength in your core increasing.
 
If you’re having trouble with this exercise, put a chair underneath the beam to 
help you reach it and grab on.
Your Coffee Table in the Living Room
Although you may think of your coffee table as being a good place to rest 
your coffee, this versatile piece of furniture makes for a great piece of 
exercise equipment:
 
✓ It’s strong and usually made of wood, so you can do dips off of it without 
being afraid that it will break under your weight.
 
✓ It’s off the floor, which makes it easier to get into a lot of different positions.
 
✓ It’s in hotel rooms, so even when you travel, you can get a core workout!
 
Try some of the exercises as shown in Chapter 13 using your coffee table. It’s 
a great way to work your core.
Your Desk in Your Home Office
Your desk at home can be an excellent prop for exercising. When you need to 
take a break from sitting in front of the computer, you don’t have to go very 
far to move some different muscles. Here’s how to do deep lunges, using your 
desk for support:

303
 Chapter 21: Ten Household Items You Can Use to Help Improve Core Strength
 
1. Stand in front of your desk and place both hands on top, making sure 
you’re an arm’s length away from it.
 
2. Lean forward into a lunge position so your right knee bends and your 
left leg is extended behind you.
 
3. Drop your left knee slowly to the floor as you tighten your stomach 
muscles to hold your body weight stable.
 
4. Inhale deeply as you press back up to a standing position, using your 
abs and back to keep you standing tall.
 
5. Repeat the core strengthener with the left leg.
 
If you don’t have a desk handy, you can do this exercise using your dining 
room table or a hip-high windowsill.
A Doorway in Your Bathroom
A doorway is a great exercise prop because it’s both stable and large enough 
to have many different applications.
Try this shoulder stretch using a doorjamb:
 
1. Grab onto the molding over the top of the door with your fingertips.
 
2. Bend your knees slightly, but keep your feet on the floor until you feel 
a stretch in your abdominals and back muscles.
 
3. Grab onto the sides of the doorway and bend forward as if you were 
going to touch your toes.
 
If you’re not tall enough to reach the top of the door, you can use a stepstool.
Water Jugs in Your Kitchen
Okay, now I know I’m a total nerd because I find myself doing this all the time 
when I refill the water machine. But those 1- to 2-gallon jugs with the handles 
make for a good piece of resistance equipment, don’t they?
You can curl (and press, if you’re really feeling energetic) your water jugs (or 
old milk jugs filled with water) to give your biceps a workout, as well as tone 
your core as you transition the movement through it. Adding weight to your 
core allows you to tighten this area while you maintain proper posture and 
focus on the individual muscles you’re working (see Chapter 10 for adding 
weights to your core).

304
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
A Towel in Your Bathroom
For core stretching, nothing beats a good, old-fashioned bath towel or 
smaller hand towel to help you achieve the stretch. It doesn’t matter whether 
you’re attempting a stretch for the upper or the lower body; using a towel to 
increase your reach makes the stretch more comfortable. See Chapter 14 for 
a few examples of stretches you can do with a towel.
The Steps in Your House
Every time you walk up and down the steps, guess what you’re working? Yep, 
your butt — but also your abs, hips, back, and core! I live in a three-story 
home, and I’m convinced I don’t have to do anything else but walk up and 
down the stairs about 50 times a day to stay fit. Now try carrying laundry and 
kids up and down, too, and you’ll see what I mean. If you have stairs in your 
house, use them! When you’re done, stretch out your feet and legs with the 
following exercise:
 
1. Stand on the bottom step with only the ball of your right foot pressed 
down as your left foot remains beside it. Inhale deeply.
 
 Make sure you hold on to a railing or something stable to prevent you 
from falling.
 
2. As you exhale, slowly lower your heel until you feel a comfortable 
stretch in your calf.
 
3. Hold the stretch for 10 to 15 seconds.
 
4. Try to gently drop your heel a little lower until you feel a deeper 
stretch in your calf.
 
5. Repeat the stretch on your other leg.
 
An excellent variation to help you stretch your calf more deeply is to slightly 
bend the knee of the leg you’re stretching. You should feel a difference at the 
base of your calf.
A Wall in Your House
You can use a wall to support any stretch. It’s smooth and wide and (I know 
this sounds a little obvious) adjacent to the floor. It’s precisely because a 
wall is adjacent to the floor that you have two firm, stable sources of support.

305
 Chapter 21: Ten Household Items You Can Use to Help Improve Core Strength
You can do push-ups (see Chapter 13) using the wall instead of your coffee 
table. The exercise is easier when you use the wall, but it’s just as effective at 
toning your core, and it’s especially good for strengthening your back.
When you’re done with your push-up, turn around and put your back flat 
against the wall and bend forward from your hips to let your head and arms 
and everything else hang out. If you can’t place your palms on the floor as in 
Chapter 13 (and face it, not many of us can), rest your hands on your shins 
for support. This is a great back and core strengthener.
A Book Lying on Your Nightstand
Sit on a big book to lift your hips off the floor just enough to take away some 
of the stress and strain of a tight lower back. When you don’t feel that strain 
anymore, you can stretch forward to grasp your toes and focus on pulling 
your belly button to your spine without rounding your back.

T
his chapter is what I like to call a round-up chapter because I’ve pulled 
ten fast and fun exercises from this book to help shore up your core. 
Because these aren’t new moves you can also try them out in the other work-
outs where they appear in this book. 
 
Of course, core training is only one tool in the battle against the bulge. To 
really get ahead of the game, you need to increase your cardio and try some 
of the tips in Chapter 20 on how eating better can help speed up your goal to 
shrink your midsection. 
Back Extensions
The back extension exercise seems simple, yet it is a powerful and effective 
back strengthener. It also targets the lower back, so if you have lower back 
problems, you may want to skip this exercise.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Using a mat or towel, lie on your stomach and place your arms at your 
sides, with the palms facing up (see Figure 22-1a).
 
2. Pulling in or contracting your abdominal muscles, lift your chest a few 
inches off the floor, keeping your gaze straight ahead at all times (see 
Figure 22-1b).
 
3. Hold for a few seconds before lowering your chest back toward the 
ground.
 
4. Repeat this exercise three to five times and increase reps as exercise 
becomes easier.

Make sure you
 
✓ Tighten your butt or glutes to protect your lower back as you lift your 
chest off the floor.
 
✓ Tighten your abdominals throughout this move.
 
✓ Avoid lifting too high off the floor. Lift only to the point that you are not 
straining your back.
Plank
The plank is another top core exercise that targets the abdominals and back 
muscles. Stay strong and lifted during this exercise, and maintain a long, 
straight back.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie face down, resting your forearms flat on the floor, and keep your 
elbows directly below your shoulders (see Figure 22-2a).
 
 Your feet should be touching or no more than an inch apart.

309
 Chapter 22: Ten Favorite Moves
 
2. Lift your body off the floor using your forearms and toes, keeping 
your body as straight as possible. Maintain this position for as long as 
possible, and challenge yourself as you build up to longer periods in 
the plank position (see Figure 22-2b).
 
3. Hold the position for 10 to 15 seconds in the beginning or as long as 
you can before working your way up to holding the plank position for 
longer periods of time.
 
Figure 22-2:

You don’t want to forget these tips:
 
✓ Keep your back long and straight.
 
✓ Don’t let your hips or knees drop toward the floor.
 
✓ Breathe steady and engage your abs.
Abdominal Crunch
Doing abdominal crunches not only works the abs but also strengthens the 
back and hips. 

310
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Make sure you keep your lower back in neutral spine when doing crunches to 
maintain proper form and support your lower back. If you let your lower back 
arch off the ground, you could strain it and pull a muscle. Not good!
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lying on the floor, bend your knees and rest your feet flat on the floor 
(see Figure 22-3a).
 
2. As you tighten your abdominals and with your hands on either side 
of your head, slowly lift your shoulders from the floor toward your 
knees (see Figure 22-3b).
 
3. Hold the lift for a few seconds, and then slowly roll your shoulders 
back to the floor.
 
 Complete ten repetitions.
While doing the ab crunch, remember to:
 
✓ Relax your neck as you curl up into a crunch.
 
✓ Keep your chin toward the ceiling and don’t use your hands to pull your 
head off the floor. 
 
✓ Maintain your neutral spine by pressing your lower back into the floor.
 
✓ Exhale as you curl up into the crunch and inhale as you release back down.

Double Crunch
This exercise tightens the lower abs and upper abs by bringing the upper and 
lower body together like an accordion. Be sure to return to starting position 
each time you finish the double crunch to help you get the best toning in 
your midsection possible.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Keeping your knees bent and your feet off the floor, engage your 
abdominal muscles by pulling your belly button in toward your spine 
(see Figure 22-4a). Place your fingertips behind your head for support.
 
2. Pull your knees toward your chest, focusing on your abdominals as 
you bring your elbows toward your knees (see Figure 22-4b).
 
3. Slowly lower legs and arms back down to the starting position to com-
plete one rep.
 
 Aim for three sets of ten repetitions.

Although it sounds more like your favorite ice cream rather than your 
favorite exercise, you can help burn off those double-crunch calories if you 
remember to:

312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Hold the movement at the top before slowly letting your knees back 
down toward the floor 
 
✓ Use your core muscles to control the movement.
 
✓ Let your head rest in your hands for support during the crunch. Don’t 
pull on your head with your hands.
Oblique Crunches
The oblique crunch or side-lying crunch is a great addition to your core program 
because it targets the side muscles or obliques, helping whittle the waist. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lying on the floor or on a mat, bend your knees and clasp your hands 
behind your neck (see Figure 22-5a). 
 
2. Lifting your upper torso, raise yourself slightly off the floor using your 
waist muscles or obliques (as shown in Figure 22-5b). 
 
 Bring your elbow toward your feet to target the waist. 
 
3. Return back down to the floor and repeat on other side after ten 
repetitions.

For these crunches, you need to be sure to:
 
✓ Engage your core throughout this entire exercise.
 
✓ Keep your knees on the ground and use your upper body to do the move.
 
✓ Avoid pulling on your head with your hands or it will strain your neck.
 
✓ Breathe!
Half-Up Twists 
Half-up twists are great for the entire core and not just the abs. The back, 
butt, waist, and abdominals all get targeted with this challenging exercise. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps: 
 
1. Sit up tall on the floor on a mat and put your hands on top of your 
knees.
 
2. Lean back until your arms are straight. Cross your arms in front of 
your chest with each hand holding an elbow (see Figure 22-6a).
 
3. Twist at the waist from side to side engaging your core as you sit up 
tall (as shown in Figure 22-6b).

Here’s what you need to remember while doing this exercise: 
 
✓ Let your head follow the movement from side to side with you.
 
✓ Lean back and use the strength of your back to help you with this 
exercise.
 
✓ Sit up nice and tall. Don’t let your shoulders and back round over.
Bicycle Crunches
This is the best exercise to work your rectus abdominus or ab muscle that 
runs right down the middle of your torso. The twisting and pulling motion 
you do with your knees and upper body is perfect for getting your core in 
shape fast and helps reduce your waist size too by working the obliques. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and thighs perpendicular to 
the floor. Place your fingers just behind your ears (see Figure 22-7a).
 
2. Lift your shoulders off the floor as you straighten the right leg and 
bring the left knee in toward your right armpit. 
 
3. Without relaxing the torso or returning your shoulders to the floor, 
repeat on the other side by straightening the left leg and pulling the 
right knee in toward the left armpit (as shown in Figure 22-7b).
 
4. Alternate the legs in a slow bicycling movement ten times on 
each side. 
Remember to bike your way to great abs with the following tips:
 
✓ Pull your abdominal muscles in for support.
 
✓ Allow your hips to drop down toward the ground — don’t arch you 
back.
 
✓ Keep your breathing steady and strong — don’t hold your breath.
 
✓ Avoid pulling you head with your hands to avoid straining your neck.

Reverse Crunches
By bringing your lower body to your upper body, you target your lower abs 
and will see a tightening in this area faster than with other ab exercises. 
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Keeping your knees bent and your feet off the floor, engage your 
abdominal muscles by pulling your belly button in toward your spine 
(see Figure 22-8a). 
 
2. Pull your knees toward your chest, focusing on your abdominals as 
you keep your arms flat on the floor with palms facing down beside 
you (see Figure 22-8b).
 
3. Slowly lower hips and legs back down to the starting position to com-
plete one rep. 
 
 Aim for one set of ten repetitions.

Keep these tips in mind while doing a reverse crunch:
 
✓ Hold the movement at the top before slowly letting your knees back 
down toward the floor 
 
✓ Keep the pace slow and steady so you are using your core muscles to 
control the movement — don’t go too fast.
Plank Leg Lifts 
Performing the plank with leg lifts makes for a killer core exercise. This exer-
cise targets the abdominals and back while helping you maintain a straight, 
healthy spine. Be sure to stay lifted and maintain a straight back during this 
exercise. Great core strengthener. . . .
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie face down, resting your forearms flat on the floor; keep your 
elbows directly below your shoulders.

317
 Chapter 22: Ten Favorite Moves
 
 Your feet should be touching or no more than an inch apart.
 
2. Lift your body off the floor using your forearms and toes, keeping 
your body as straight as possible (see Figure 22-9a).
 
3. Lift each leg one at a time off the floor before returning to the starting 
position (see Figure 22-9b).
 
 You don’t have to lift the legs more than half an inch to get the benefit of 
this exercise.
 
4. Repeat for ten repetitions and increase repetitions when you feel 
comfortable.

Maximize the benefits of this exercise by doing the following:
 
✓ Keep your back long and straight, in line from your head to your heels.
 
✓ Avoid letting your butt or hips drop toward the floor.
 
✓ Breathe steadily.
 
✓ Engage your abs and be sure to keep your leg straight and your butt con-
tracted to help lift the leg.

Superman — Opposite Arm 
and Leg Extension
The Superman trains your entire core to work together properly, to provide 
stability and balance, while at the same time strengthening your abdominals. 
Remember, keeping your back strong and flexible is the best prevention 
against low back problems.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
 
1. Lie face down on a mat or the floor, with your arms extended over-
head and palms facing down (as shown in Figure 22-10a).
 
2. At the same time, extend your right arm and your left leg out straight 
from your body and hold them out about three to five inches off the 
floor (see Figure 22-10b).
 
 Imagine that strings are attached to your hand and foot, and that the 
strings are gently pulling your arm and leg away from each other, not 
up. You want to get the lengthening in your abdominal muscles and your 
spine, not shortening or compressing it.
 
3. Hold the position for five to eight seconds, breathing comfortably and 
normally.
 
4. Lower your arm and leg, and return to the floor.
 
5. Repeat the exercise five or six more times on each side and increase 
repetitions when you feel comfortable. 
Make your Superman soar to new heights by remembering to:
 
✓ Keep your abdominals tight. Lax abdominals may place undue stress on 
your lower-back muscles.
 
✓ Not arch your back.
 
✓ Not lift your foot or hand higher than 3 to 5 inches off the floor.
