Bookkeeping Workbook For Dummies 

Introduction
B
ookkeepers are the keepers of the cash and the crucial caretakers of all information
about the company’s transactions. People both inside the business (managers,
owners, and employees) and people outside the business (investors, lenders and govern-
mental agencies) all depend on the accurate recording of financial transactions by the book-
keeper.
 Financial institutions won’t loan money to a company unless they trust the financial
reports that have been prepared by that company when it applies for a loan. 
 Investors won’t invest in a company if they don’t trust its financial reporting. 
 Employees need to know their job will still be there tomorrow and many employees are
dependent on accurate financial reports in order to do their jobs. 
If you subscribe to the idea that information is power, which I do, you’ll find that the book-
keeper has a tremendous amount of power in a company. Information tracked in the books
help business owners make key decisions involving sales planning, product offerings, and
how to manage many other financial aspects of their business.
Whether you are an owner keeping the books yourself or you are an employee keeping the
books for a small business owner, your job is critical for the smooth financial operation of
the company.
Bookkeepers must be detail oriented, must enjoy working with numbers, and must be metic-
ulous about accurately entering those numbers in a company’s books. They must be good
about keeping a paper trail and filing all needed backup information about the financial trans-
actions they enter into the books. 
Bookkeeping has a language and method of operation all its own. Understanding that new
language and operating under the rules of bookkeeping can be foreign to anyone who’s never
been exposed to it before; it takes practice. In this workbook, I introduce you to the world of
bookkeeping and give you opportunities to practice the key concepts. 
About This Book
In this book, I take you through the continuous cycle of bookkeeping, which begins with 
setting up your company’s books, developing a list of your company’s accounts (Chart of
Accounts; see Chapter 3), developing your company’s General Ledger (which summarizes all
the activity in a company’s accounts; see Chapter 4), and developing your company’s jour-
nals (which give details about all of a company’s financial transactions; see Chapter 5).
Then I take you through the process of recording all your transactions — sales, purchases
and other financial activity. I also talk about how to manage payroll, governmental reporting,
and external financial reporting.

Finally, I show you how to start the yearly cycle all over again by closing out the neces-
sary accounts for the current year and opening up any new ones for the next year. 
However, although bookkeeping is a continuous cycle, a Dummies book is not. You
don’t have to follow the entire cycle or go through it in order if you don’t want to. The
reference style of this book allows you to skip around to the chapters you need to
know more about, or you can go through all of them to practice all the skills I outline in
this book.
Foolish Assumptions
While writing this book, I made some key assumptions about who you are and why you
want to learn more about bookkeeping. I assume that you are
 A business owner who wants to know how to do your own books: You have a
good understanding of business and its terminology, but have little or no knowl-
edge of bookkeeping and accounting.
 A person who does bookkeeping or plans to do bookkeeping for a small busi-
ness and needs to know more about how to set up and keep the books: Again I
assume you have some basic knowledge of business terminology, but don’t know
much about bookkeeping or accounting.
 A staff person in a small business and have just been asked to take over the
bookkeeping duties for the company: You need to know more detail about how
transactions are entered into the books accurately and how to prove out the
transactions that have been entered into the books.
How This Book Is Organized
I organized this workbook into six parts, which I outline in the sections below:
Part I: Exploring Bookkeeping Basics
In Part I, I discuss the importance of bookkeeping, explain the basics about how it
works, and help you get started with setting up of your books. You’ll find questions
and problems that will help you learn bookkeeping’s unique terms and how to set up
the roadmap for your books — the Chart of Accounts.
Part II: Putting It All on Paper
In Part II, I show you to how to enter your financial transactions in the books, how 
to post transactions to your General Ledger (the granddaddy of your bookkeeping
system), how to track all the transaction details in your journals, and how to develop 
a good internal control system for managing your books and your company’s cash.
Questions and problems will give you an opportunity to practice these tasks.

Bookkeeping Workbook For Dummies 

Part III: Tracking Day-to-Day Business
Operations with Your Books
In Part III, I show you how to track your day-to-day business operations including
recording sales and purchases, as well as recording any adjustments to those sales
and purchases, such as discounts and returns. In addition, I talk about the basics of
setting up and managing employee payroll, as well as all the government paperwork
you’ll need to complete as soon as you decide to hire employees. You’ll also find prob-
lems that give you an opportunity to practice how to perform these key duties of a
bookkeeper.
Part IV: Getting Ready for 
Year’s (Or Month’s) End
In Part IV, I introduce you to the process of preparing your books for closing out the
accounting period, whether you’re closing out the books at the end of a month or the
end of a year. You’ll learn about the key adjustments needed to record depreciation of
your assets (a process which tracks the use of your tangible assets, such as cars and
buildings), which must be done before you close the books. You’ll also learn about
how to calculate and record your interest payments and receipts in your books. Then
I’ll talk about various aspects of proving out your books — checking your cash, testing
the balance of your books, and making any needed adjustments or corrections. In
addition, you’ll find problems that will give you time to practice these tasks for prepar-
ing the books for the end of the accounting period.
Part V: Putting on Your Best Financial Face
In Part V, you explore how to report all your hard work keeping the books to others
inside and outside the company. I also explore the various structures of a business and
what forms must be filed with the IRS. Finally I talk about how you close out the books
at year-end and get ready for the next year.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Part VI is the hallmark of the For Dummies series — the Part of Tens. In it, I highlight
the top ten accounts you should monitor and a top ten checklist for managing cash.
Icons Used in This Book
To make spotting certain info even easier, I use the following icons:
When I give you specific tidbits of info that can help make your efforts run smoother
or more quickly, I tag them with this icon.

Introduction

I use this icon when I provide you some info that I definitely don’t want you to forget.
Now, it wouldn’t be any fun to work in a workbook without seeing some examples first,
now would it? To make these examples easy to spot, I use this icon. 
Where to Go from Here
You’re now ready to enter the world of bookkeeping. You can start anywhere in the
book you would like. 
If you already know the bookkeeping basics, are familiar with the key terminology, and
know how to set up a chart of accounts, you may want to start with Part II. If you need
to learn all the basics or want to refresh your knowledge then start with Part I.
If you’ve got your books already set up and know the basics, you may want to start
with how to enter various transactions in Part III. If your first priority is understanding
how to use the financial information, then you may want to look at financial reporting
options in Part V first.

ookkeeping can look like a foreign language to anyone
who’s never seen it before. In this part you’ll explore
the basics about how bookkeeping works. You’ll also begin
to relearn terms you may already think you know but have
a unique meaning in the world of bookkeeping — like
ledgers, journals, posting, debits and credits. Then you’ll
delve into how to set up the roadmap for your books — the
Chart of Accounts.

B
ookkeepers are the accountant’s eyes and ears. Few accountants actually take the time
to enter the numbers into the accounting books. That job instead goes to the book-
keepers. Bookkeeping, when done properly, gives a business owener an excellent gauge of
how well his business is doing financially.
In this chapter, you will get an overview of a bookkeeper’s work and introduction to some of
the key accounting concepts.
Using Cash or Accrual Method
When setting up a business, the first major accounting decision that must be made is
whether to keep the books using the cash-basis accounting method or the accrual account-
ing method. If you decide to use the cash-basis accounting method, you record all transac-
tions only when cash actually changes hands. Cash can include payment by cash, check
credit card, electronic transfer, or any other means you pay for something you buy. If you
decide to use the accrual accounting method, you record a transaction when the transaction
is completed, even if cash has not yet changed hands. 
For example, if your company purchases the products it plans to sell from vendors on credit
and doesn’t pay for them until 30 days later, you would record this transaction differently
depending upon which method you choose to use. If you are using the cash-basis accounting
method, you would not record the purchase in your books until you actually pay for the
products with cash. If you are using the accrual method, you would record the purchase
immediately. You would record the purchase in an account called Purchases and you would
record the liability to the vendor in an account called Accounts Payable on the day you get
the bill for the goods, which allows you to track all pending obligations to vendors.
Many small businesses run by a sole proprietor (single owner) or partnership group choose
to use cash-basis accounting at first because it’s easier, but as the business grows and there
are many more transactions to keep track of a business usually will switch to the accrual
method of accounting.

Part I: Exploring Bookkeeping Basics 
1.
You buy products you plan to sell paying
cash on delivery on June 15. How and
when would you record this transaction in
your books if you are using cash-basis
accounting and how would you record it
using accrual accounting?
Solve It
2.
You contract with a painter to paint your
store front on June 15 and he completes
the work on July 1 and gives you a bill for
the work. You pay for the work with cash
on July 5. How and when would you record
this transaction in your books if you are
using cash-basis accounting and how
would you record it using accrual 
accounting?
Solve It
Q.
You buy products for sale on June 15 on
credit with the vendor and get a bill with
the purchase. You don’t have to pay that
bill until July 1. How would you record this
transaction in your books if you are using
cash-basis accounting and also how 
would you would record it using accrual
accounting?
A.
For cash-basis accounting, you would not
record anything in the books until you pay
for the products with cash on July 1. For
accrual accounting you would record the
purchase on June 15 in Accounts Payable,
as well as in the account where you record
purchases.

tion in your books if you are using cash-
basis accounting and how would you
record it using accrual accounting?
Solve It
4.
You sell your products to a customer on
store credit on June 15. You send a bill to

cash-basis accounting and how would you
record it using accrual accounting?
Solve It
So which accounting method is better? The cash-basis accounting method does a good
job of tracking the flow of cash, but it does a poor job of matching your revenues to
your expenses. The accrual accounting method does a good job of matching revenues
and expenses, but does a poor job of tracking the use of cash. Companies that use
accrual accounting also set up a system to monitor cash flow. 
The biggest difference between these two methods shows up with transactions that
occur at the end of one year and the beginning of the next year. As you work through
these problems you will see how differently the transactions are handled at the end of
a year for each accounting method and how the way they are handled can impact the
profits and expenses you show on your financial statements, as well as the taxes you
may have to pay on any profits at the end of the year.
There is a big difference between cash and accrual accounting. While cash accounting
is easier, it does make it more difficult to keep track of money due from customers who
buy on store credit, as well as payments due to vendors, suppliers, contractors, and
others for purchases and other expenses. You should never choose to use the cash-
basis accounting method if:
Your business carries over inventory month-to-month and year-to-year. It is more
difficult to match costs for the inventory with the profits made from the sale of
that inventory using the cash-basis method.
Your business allows customers to buy on store credit. Your books will not show
the revenue until the customers pay in cash. Also, you will have a more difficult
time tracking how much is due from customers.

Q.
For example, suppose you are keeping the
books for a carpenter who contracted to
do a job on December 15 for $15,000 and
received 50 percent up front or $7,500. 
He spent $5,000 in cash on materials
December 16 and paid his workers $5,000
in cash on December 31 when the work
was completed. The contractor did not
meet with the customer for final approval
of the work and final payment until January
3. How would you record these transac-
tions using the cash-basis accounting
method and how would you record them
using the accrual accounting method?
A.
If you were keeping the books using the
cash-basis accrual method, you would
record the cash received on December 15
of $7,500. You would record the $5,000 cash
spent on materials on December 16 and
you would record the payment to workers
of $5,000 cash on December 31. When you
closed your books for the year on
December 31, this job would show rev-
enues of $7,500 and expenses of $10,000 or
a loss of $2,500. You would then record the
$7,500 cash received on January 3 and
have no corresponding expenses, so at the
end of that year you would have an addi-
tional $7,500 in profits for work performed
for the previous year with the expenses for
the work recorded in the previous year.
If you were using the accrual method, you
would record the receipt of $7,500 revenue
on December 15; you would record the
$5,000 cash spent on materials on
December 16. You would record the pay-
ment to your workers of $5,000 in revenue
on December 31. You would also record the
final payment of $7,500 due in an account
called Accounts Receivables, which tracks
customer payments due. When you close
your books at the end of the year, you
would show a $5,000 profit on this job.
You decide to incorporate your business. Read chapter 17 for more on business types.
You have gross annual sales of more than $5 million.
If you do start keeping your books using the cash-basis accounting method, you can
convert to the accrual accounting method, but you must file a form with the IRS called
the Change in Accounting Method (Form 3115) within 180 days before the end of the
tax year you want to make that change. You can find out more about the instructions
for changing account method by downloading them at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/

Sorting Out Assets, Liabilities, and Equity
Once you choose your accounting method, you’ll next need to sort out whether items
in your books are assets, liabilities, or equity. Assets include anything the company
owns. Liabilities include anything the company owes. Equity reflects the money the
owners have put in or taken out of the company.
In order to keep your books in balance, you need to carefully track all these different
items in the right place. The key formula used in accounting for balancing the books is
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
In other words everything your business owns is balanced against claims against
those items owned. Vendors and lenders, who account for most of your liabilities, 
have claims against the assets for the money you owe them. Owners of the business
have claims against the remaining assets.
So which items fall into each of these categories? In the assets category you would find
cash, marketable securities (including stocks, bonds, and money market accounts),
inventory, buildings, land, equipment, and vehicles. These are all tangible assets
(assets you can touch and feel). In addition to tangible assets there are intangible
assets — assets that you can’t touch and feel. Patents and copyrights are good exam-
ples of intangible assets. In both cases these are items a company owns based on gov-
ernmental guarantees that the business has the exclusive rights to produce products
based on these copyrights or patents. Another common intangible asset is organiza-
tion costs, which include the initial start-up expenses of a business.
In the liabilities category you’ll find bills due to vendors or suppliers, payments due to
consultants, credit card bills, and bank loans. You would also find any accruals of taxes
owed. There are two types of tax payments that you may accrue in a business. When
you sell products to customers you collect sales taxes. When you pay your employees
you collect taxes the employee owes the government including federal and state taxes,
Social Security taxes, and Medicare taxes. Most small companies pay these taxes on a
quarterly basis, but accrue them in a liability account until the tax is due to track
future payment obligations.
In the equity category, you would find all claims that owners have against the com-
pany. If the company is incorporated, owner’s claims would be reflected in a Stock
account. Money paid out to stockholders would be found in a dividend expense
account. If the company is privately owned, the owners claims would be reflected in a
Capital account, which tracks money put into the business, and a Drawing account
would track money taken out of the business by the owners. Any profits kept in the
business and not paid out to owners, would be shown in a Retained Earnings account.

Tracking the Daily Finances
A bookkeeper also needs to keep accurate day-to day records of business activities.
These activities include maintaining inventory, tracking sales, and handling payroll. 
It’s critically important for any business to know what inventory it has on hand and
how much that Inventory costs. The tracking of those details falls to the bookkeeper. 
I talk more about the bookkeeper’s responsibilities in this area in Chapter 7.
Every business owner enjoys finding out how much he took in from sales of his prod-
ucts or services. You need to keep that data up-to-date, so the owner of the business
can quickly see how well the business is doing and find trends that may indicate either
an upswing or downswing in sales. If there is an upswing, the owner may need to bring
in more products to sell. If there is a downswing, the owner may need to slow down his
ordering to avoid having too much inventory on hand. I talk more about the book-
keeper’s responsibility for tracking sales in Chapter 8.
The third critical responsibility is making sure the employees are paid accurately. You
also have to be sure the government gets any taxes due related to the payroll. I talk
more about managing payroll in Chapter 9.
Testing Your Work
At the end of an accounting period, you need to test to find out if you entered all the
transactions in the books accurately and if your books are in balance. You start the
process of testing for accuracy by proving out your cash to be sure your cash balance
is accurate. 
Once you know your cash is right, then you test whether your books are in balance
using a trial balance. If they’re not in balance you’ll need to do a worksheet to find the
errors and prepare journal entries to correct them. I talk more about how to test your
work and make any necessary corrections at the end of an accounting period in
Chapters 13 and 14.
Naming the Financial Statements
After you take the time to put all your transactions into the books, you need to have a
way to summarize the financial results of all these transactions. You do that by prepar-
ing financial reports about the business’s activity. Two key reports that are prepared
include the Balance Sheet and Income Statement.
The Balance Sheet, which is based on the formula Assets equals Liabilities and Equity,
shows a business’s overall financial health at a particular date in time. The financial
statement includes two columns. One lists all the assets and the second, which must
be equal to the first, lists all the liabilities and equity. I show you how to prepare this
statement in Chapter 15.
The Income Statement, which summarizes the activity of a business during an account-
ing period, shows whether the business made a profit or took a loss. The accounting
period can be a month, a quarter or a year. This statement starts with the Revenues,

subtracts the costs of purchasing the goods or services you sell, then subtracts the

Keeping a Paper Trail
In addition to recording all your company’s transactions in the books, you also need to
keep an accurate paper trail about those transactions so if a question comes up later
you have all the detail you need to provide an answer about a particular expense or
revenue. It’s the only way that you can track both the company’s financial successes
and its failures. 
A company owner needs to know what succeeded, so he can repeat that success in the
future and also needs to know what failed, so you can avoid repeating those errors in the
future. Your books and the supporting paper trail help the business owner to do that.
There are several types of books that you keep. The granddaddy of them all is the
General Ledger. This summarizes all your accounts during the year. You can imagine
that there would be thousands of transactions for most businesses (large corpora-
tions have millions), so it would be unwieldy to have the details of all transactions in
just one book. Instead the most active accounts are detailed in a series of journals.
The monthly summary totals from the journals are then posted to the General Ledger.
I talk more about how General Ledgers are used in Chapter 4 and how journals are
used in Chapter 5. 
Many companies use computerized accounting today. In these cases the journals are
kept electronically rather than on paper.
In addition to keeping the books, you also need to keep copies of the paper that was
used to back up the transaction. For example, when you purchase products you intend
to sell, you would get an invoice that shows how much you paid for those products.
You should keep copies of all those invoices in case a question arises later. I talk more
about what paperwork you need to keep and for how long you need to keep it in
Chapter 6. I also talk about how to set up a filing system in that chapter, so you will be
able to find everything when you need to do so.

Answers to Problems on 
Deciphering the Basics
a
You would record the transaction the same way using cash-basis or accrual accounting. Cash
was paid on June 15, so the transaction would be recorded as a cash transaction in cash-basis
accounting. The transaction was completed on June 15, so the transaction would be recorded
in accrual accounting as well.
b
You would record the money due the painter on July 1 when the work is completed in the
Accounts Payable account to reflect the money that is due if you are using accrual accounting.
You would not record the transaction until July 5 when you pay the painter in cash using cash-
basis accounting.
c
You would record the payment on July 15 when you pay with cash if you are using cash-basis
accounting. If you are using accrual accounting, you would record the bill on July 1 in the
Accounts Payable account if you are using accrual accounting.
d
You would record the transaction on July 15 if you are using cash-basis accounting. You would
record the transaction on June 15 when you first make the sale in the Accounts Receivables
account, where you track sales to customers who buy on store credit if you are using accrual
accounting.
e
If you were keeping the books using cash-basis accounting, you would record the cash revenue of
$7,500 on December 15. You would record the cash payment to the workers on December 31. You
would record the cash revenue on January 3 and you would record the payment for materials on
January 10. At the end of the year the job would show a profit of $2,500 because only $5,000 had
been paid to workers and the materials were not yet paid. If you were keeping the books using
accrual accounting, you would record the cash revenue of $7,500 on December 15. You would
record the cash payments to workers of $5,000 on December 31. You would record the bill for
materials of $5,000 on December 31, and you would also record the revenue for the completed job
now due from the customer of $7,500 on December 31 in the Accounts Receivable account on
December 31. At the end of the year the job would show a profit of $5,000.
f
If you were keeping the books using cash-basis accounting, you would record the $1,500 pur-
chase of the products on December 15. You would record the cash sales of $1,500 as they were
received. You would not record the sales to customers who you sold to on store credit until the
money was received in mid-January. You would show $0 profit on these product sales on
December 31. If you were keeping the books using an accrual accounting method, you would
record the $1,500 purchase of the products on December 15. You would record the sales on the
days they were made, but you would have recorded the total revenue of $2,500 by December
25. Cash sales would be recorded in the Cash account and store credit sales would be recorded
in the Accounts Receivable account. You would show a profit on these product sales of $1,000
on December 31. The accrual method of accounting would show a $1,000 profit, while the cash-
method would show a $0 profit.
g
If you were keeping the books using cash-basis accounting, you would record the cash sales as
they were made but would total $2,500 by December 25. You would not record the cash pay-
ment of $1,500 for the products bought until you pay that bill with cash on January 10. Your
revenues for these sales would total $2,500 and you wouldn’t show any costs on December 31.
If you were keeping the books using the accrual accounting method, you would record the sales
as they were made, but would total $2,500 by December 25. You would record the bill to cover
the costs of the goods on December 31 in Accounts Payable. Your revenues for these sales
would total $2,500 and the costs of goods sold would total $1,500 on December 31.

Designing Your Bookkeeping System
In This Chapter
 Becoming familiar with the accounts
 Exploring the bookkeeping process
 Discovering double-entry accounting
 Understanding debits and credits
A
s a bookkeeper you serve as the eyes and ears of the accountant, so you have to
understand the basics of accounting. In this chapter, I give you a brief overview of
accounting basics and show you how to use that information to design a bookkeeping
system. You also get a chance to practice the key concepts of bookkeeping design, as well
as the key functions of a bookkeeping system.
Introducing the Accounts
Your role as the bookkeeper requires you to track all the financial transactions of a business.
Accounting provides the structure you must use to organize these transactions, as well as
the procedures you must use to record, classify, and report information about your business.
On a day-to-day basis, you make sure that all transactions are entered accurately in the
books. To be a bookkeeper you must be very detail oriented and love to work with numbers.
Since you spend most of your day hunched over a computer massaging the numbers, if you
don’t like working with numbers, forget about it — bookkeeping is not for you.
You don’t have to be certified public accountant (CPA) to do the books, but for many small
businesses that don’t have the money to hire a full-time CPA, you will be the person who
works with the accountant hired to review the books. He prepares the financial statements
using the data you collected when you entered all the financial transactions.
In most cases the accounting system will be set up with the help of an accountant to be sure
the information generated by that system will be useable and meets the requirements of
solid accounting principals. You’ll probably get periodic visits from the accountant to review
your system and be sure you’re entering information correctly.
A business owner is dependent upon your work to know how well his company is doing. If
you put garbage into the system (inaccurate data or data entered into the wrong accounts),
he will get garbage out of the system. The financial reports generated by a system with a lot
of errors will be useless.
A bookkeeping system is designed based on the data needed for the two key financial 
reports — the balance sheet and the income statement. The balance sheet gives you a snap-
shot of a business as of a particular date. The income statement gives you a summary of all
transactions during a particular period of time, usually a month, a quarter, or a year.

The key balance sheet accounts include
 Assets: Everything the business owns in order to operate successfully is consid-
ered an asset. This includes cash, buildings, land, tools, equipment, vehicles, and
furniture. Each type of asset has a separate account. Another asset is the
Accounts Receivable account (money due from customers who bought on
credit).
 Inventory: Products on hand that the business plans to sell.
 Liabilities: All the money the company owes to others are considered liabilities.
This includes unpaid bills (called Accounts Payable account), loans, and bonds.
Each type of liability will have a separate account.
 Equity: All the money invested in the company by the owners or stock holders is
considered equity. Each type of equity, and possibly each owner in a small busi-
ness, will have a separate account.
The key income statement accounts include
 Revenue: All the money a business receives in selling its products or services is
called revenue or sales and tracked in these accounts.
 Cost of goods sold: All money the company must spend to buy or manufacture
the goods or services it sells to customers is tracked in these accounts. An
account called Purchases is used to track goods purchased.
 Expenses: All money that is spent to run the company that is not related specifi-
cally to a product or service being sold is tracked in expenses accounts. For
example, Office Supplies, Advertising, Salaries, and Wages are all types of
expense accounts.
As the bookkeeper you will be responsible for identifying the account in which each
transaction should be recorded. In Chapter 3, I give you a closer look at the types of
accounts that fall under each of these categories.

In addition to learning the types of accounts and where the transactions should be
recorded, you’ll also need to learn an entirely new vocabulary. Some key terms you’ll
need to know include:
 Accounting period: This is the time period for which the transactions are being
tracked. It can be a month, a quarter, a year or another period of time that is rea-
sonable for the type of business. Most companies will prepare financial reports
at least monthly and then prepare an annual report at the end of a 12-month
accounting period.
 Accounts Receivable: This is where you track customer sales for customers who
buy on store credit rather than pay by cash. (Read Chapter 8 for more detail
about these types of transactions.)
 Accounts Payable: This is the account you use to track bills the company 
owes and has not yet paid. (Read Chapter 7 for more detail about these types 
of transactions.)
 Depreciation: This is how you track the use and aging of the equipment, furni-
ture, buildings and other major assets the company owns. (Read Chapter 11 for
more information about depreciation.)
 General Ledger: This summarizes all the financial transactions of a business.
(Read Chapter 4 for more information about the General Ledger and how it is
used.)
 Interest: Whenever the company borrows money, it will likely have to pay inter-
est on the amount borrowed, just like you must do when you borrow money
from the bank to buy a car or a house.
 Inventory: Products that the company has available for sale to its customers.
(Read Chapter 7 for more information about inventory.)
 Payroll: All the money that is paid to the company’s employees is tracked in a
payroll account. (Read Chapter 9 for more detail about payroll management.)

Cycling Through the Bookkeeping Process
In addition to understanding all the new terminology and types of accounts, as a book-
keeper you’ll also need to understand how the accounting cycle works. There are eight
steps in the accounting cycle:
1. Transactions: The process starts with financial transactions. These can include
the sale or return of goods, the purchase of goods or supplies, the payment of
salaries — essentially any time cash changes hands or the promise of payment is
made a transaction has occurred.
2. Journal entries: The first thing you do after a transaction has occurred is pre-
pare a journal entry so you can record it in the books. (Read Chapter 5 for more
on journal entries.)
3. Posting: After preparing the journal entry you post it to the books. I discuss
posting financial transactions in Chapters 4 and 5.
4. Trial balance: At the end of an accounting period you’ll test the books to see if
they are in balance. I show you how to do a trial balance in Chapter 14.
5. Worksheet: Often on the first try you’ll find the books are not in balance. A work-
sheet is used to figure out the problem. I show you how to do a worksheet in
Chapter 14.
6. Adjusting journal entries: After you figure out what is wrong, you make adjust-
ments to the books using Adjusting Journal Entries. I show you how to prepare
these entries in Chapter 14.
7. Financial statements: Financial statements are prepared using the corrected trial
balance.
8. Closing: At the end of an accounting period you close the books and get ready
for the next accounting period. I talk about closing the books in Chapter 18.
When you close the books, everything starts again. The accounting cycle is more like a
circle than a straight line — cycling from accounting period to the next accounting
period.
24
Part I: Exploring Bookkeeping Basics 
Q.
What starts the bookkeeping cycle?
a. Sales in the store
b. Rental of store space
c. Any financial transaction
d. Paying for your business license
A.
The answer would be c. Any financial
transaction can start the bookkeeping
cycle. The key is when that transaction
happens. The first transaction of a new
accounting period starts the bookkeeping
cycle for that period, but remember once
you start keeping the books the cycle is

Seeing Double with Double-Entry
Bookkeeping
Every time you enter a transaction in your books you’ll be entering it twice. This is
called double-entry bookkeeping and, if you do it right, your books should be in bal-
ance on the first try. Even if you do make mistakes, double-entry bookkeeping helps to
minimize those mistakes and increases your chance of your books being in balance
without having to make corrections.
The key to double-entry accounting and the balance of the books is this formula:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
That’s the formula for the balance sheet, which I’ll talk about in greater detail in
Chapter 15 after you learn all the items that are used to make up the balance sheet. 
Basically what you need to remember is that any time you enter a financial transac-
tion, as least two accounts will be impacted by the transaction. In each entry you must
have one debit and one credit. Now, you need to forget everything you ever learned
about the meaning of debits and credits. From past experience you probably think of a
debit as something that is subtracted from your bank account and a credit as some-
thing that is added to your bank account. You’ll find debits and credits don’t always
work that way in accounting. For some accounts the debit will add to the account; for
others it will subtract from the account. That’s because it depends upon which side of
the accounting formula the account is on. I talk more about how to figure this out in
the section, “Differentiating Between Debits and Credits” later in this chapter.
First, I want you to practice the basics of developing a double entry. For example, sup-
pose you bought furniture using cash totaling $1,000. You spent cash to buy the furni-
ture, but you also added a new asset.

Q.
How would you develop a journal entry to
enter this financial transaction in your
books? 
A.
Here is what the transaction would look
like:
Account
Debit
Credit
Furniture
$1,000
Cash
$1,000
So how does this impact the accounting equation? Both accounts are asset accounts,
so a debit to the Furniture account will increase the ending balance of that account.
The credit to the Cash account will decrease the total balance of the Cash account. So
the total value of the assets would not change and would keep the asset side of the
equation equal to the liabilities and equity side.
Before getting into the impact of each of these transactions on the account, first try
developing these journal entries:

Differentiating Between Debits and Credits
When first starting to use debits and credits, the hardest thing for most people to learn
is whether a debit increases or decreases an account and whether a credit increases
or decreases an account. It all depends on the type of account. As you learn how all
this works, copy and tape Table 2-1 somewhere handy — you should keep a copy at
your desk.

How would you develop a journal entry to
enter the financial transaction from the
previous example in your books? 
A.
Here is what the transaction would look
like:
Account

Furniture

Cash

As mentioned above, the Furniture account
will increase the ending balance of that
account. The credit to the Cash account
will decrease the total balance of the Cash
account. So the total value of the assets
would not change and would keep the
assets equal to the liabilities and equity.
I want you to revisit the four transactions

Answers to Problems on Designing 
Your Bookkeeping System
a
B: Record the goods purchased in a cost of goods sold account called Purchases; record the
cash spent in an asset account. You would not record the goods purchased in the Inventory
account. Inventory is adjusted at the end of an accounting period after a physical count of the
inventory has been done. The one exception to this is a business that does computerized man-
agement of its inventory system. In most cases when inventory is computerized, the system
automatically adjusts inventory with each purchase of goods. But even with this type of system
the initial entry would be to the Purchases account and the computer would then automatically
update the Inventory account.
b
C: Record the furniture in an asset account called Furniture, record the credit card transaction
in a liability account called Credit Card. You would record the charge on the credit card in a lia-
bility account called Credit Card. Cash would not be paid until the credit card bill is due to be
paid. Furniture is always listed as an asset on your balance sheet. Anything you buy that you
expect to use for more than one year will be an asset rather then an expense.
c
B: Record the rent payment in an expense account called Rent; record the cash used in an asset
account called Cash. Cash is always an asset account. It does not matter whether or not you
are taking cash out to buy something or depositing cash you received after making a sale. Rent
is always an expense. 
d
C: Inventory Account. The Inventory account is adjusted at the end of each accounting period
to show the total number of products remaining to be sold at the end of the accounting period.
e
B: Accounts Receivable. The Accounts Receivable is the account that is used to track all cus-
tomer purchases made by store credit. In addition to this account that summarizes all products
bought on credit, you would also need to enter the purchases into the individual accounts of
each of your customers so you can bill them and track their payments.
f
C: Accounts Payable. All bills that will be due at some time in the future are tracked in the
Accounts Payable account.
g
C: Journal entry. When you prepare the journal entry, you take the time to think about the
accounts impacted by the transaction. There will always be at least two accounts in the 
entry — one a debit and one a credit.
h
D: Prepare a trial balance. The trial balance is a working tool that helps you test whether your
books are in balance before you prepare your financial statements.
i
A: Adjusting Journal Entries. At the end of an accounting period you correct any mistakes using
Adjusting Journal Entries. These entries will also need to be in balance. You will always have at
least one account that is a debit and one that is a credit.
j
In this transaction you would debit the Purchases account to show the additional purchases
made during that period and credit the Accounts Payable account. Since you are buying the
goods on credit that means you will have to pay the bill at some point in the future.

As you think about the journal entry you may not know whether something is a credit or a
debit. As you know from our discussions earlier in the chapter, a debit to the Cash account
increases the balance in that account. In this question since you did receive cash, you know
that the Cash account needs to be a debit. So your only choice is to make the Sales account 
the account to be credited. All income accounts are increased by a credit. If you are having
trouble figuring this out, use the chart at the end of the chapter to become familiar with which
accounts are increased by a credit or a debit and which accounts are decreased by a debit or a
credit.

In this question, rather than taking in cash, the customers were allowed to pay on credit, so

In this question since you are paying with a check, it will be recorded in your Cash account.

other types of transactions that will be taken directly from you bank account will always be
entered as a credit. All money paid out for expenses will always be a debit.

Sorting Out Your Business Road Map
In This Chapter
 Mapping out the accounts
 Allocating your assets and liabilities
 Itemizing your income
B
ookkeepers need a roadmap that helps them determine where to put the numbers. By
developing a Chart of Accounts with clearly defined places for all your transactions,
you can produce financial statements that will accurately reflect your businesses activities
for the year. This chapter will introduce you to what goes into developing a chart of
accounts and how to set it up.
Charting Your Accounts
A Chart of Accounts is organized to make it easier for you to produce two key financial 
statements:
 The balance sheet, which shows what your business owns and what it owes
 The income statement, which shows how much money your business took in (revenue)
and how much money it spent to generate those sales (expenses)
You can find out more about balance sheets in Chapter 15 and income statements in Chapter
16. The Chart of Accounts should always start with the accounts you need to produce a bal-
ance sheet and then follow with accounts you need to produce an income statement.
The basic order for your Chart of Accounts should start by listing the balance sheet accounts:
 Current Assets: Accounts for tracking everything the company owns and expects to
use in the next 12 months, including cash, accounts receivable (money collected from
customers), inventory, and any other current assets with a lifespan of less than a year.
 Long-term Assets: Accounts for tracking things the company owns that have a lifespan
of more than 12 months, such as buildings, furniture, and equipment.
 Current Liabilities: Accounts for tracking debts the company must pay over the next
12 months, such as accounts payable (bills from vendors, contractors, and consult-
ants), interest payable, and credit cards payable.
 Long-term Liabilities: Accounts for tracking debts the company must pay over a
period of time longer than the next 12 months, such as mortgages payable and bonds
payable.
 Equity: Accounts for tracking company owners and their claims against the company’s
assets, which includes any money invested in the company, any money taken out of the
company, and any earnings that have been reinvested in the company.

company’s goods or services
 Expenses: Accounts for tracking expenses related to running the businesses that
aren’t directly tied to the sale of individual products or services

Detailing Your Balance Sheet Accounts
First, I want to take a closer look at the types of Balance Sheet accounts you would have
in each of the five Asset sections of the Chart of Accounts — Current Assets, Long-term
Assets, Current Liabilities, Long-term Liabilities, and Equity. Then I will give you space 
to jot down your own list of Balance Sheet accounts for your business. Whatever you
write down now is not carved in stone. You can add to and subtract from the Chart of
Accounts. You can add an account at any time of the year, but you should only subtract
accounts at the end of an accounting period to be sure you don’t lost any transactions
with the deletion.
Current Assets
When thinking about the types of accounts you want to list as current assets, think
about things your business owns that you expect will be used up in the next 12
months. Here are the most common types of current asset accounts:
 Cash in Checking: Your company’s primary account that is used to deposit rev-
enues and pay expenses would be tracked in this account. You may have more
than one cash operating account if your company has several divisions each
with their own Cash in Checking account.

 Cash in Savings: Your company would use this account for surplus cash. Cash for
which you have no immediate plans at the very least should be deposited in an
interest-earning savings account until the company decides what to do with it.
 Cash on Hand: Your company would use this account to track any petty cash or
cash kept in store cash registers.
 Accounts Receivable: If you offer your products or services to customers on
store credit given by your company, then you need this account to track the 
customers who buy on credit, so you can collect from them at a later date. 
 Inventory: You track all products you have on hand to sell to your customers. 
You may also want to set up asset accounts for items that you prepay, such as insur-
ance, which is usually paid for an entire year. You would track it as a current asset
and gradually reduce its value as you allocate it as an expense month to month. This
would be called Prepaid Insurance. I talk more about how to handle prepaid items in
Chapter 14.
Exercise 3-1: Think about the current assets you will need to track for your
business, and write down the accounts in this section.
Long-Term Assets
When thinking about the types of accounts you want to list as long-term assets, think
about the things your company owns that you will use for more than 12 months. Here
are some common Long-term Asset accounts:
 Land: You can track any land owned by the company in this account. 
 Buildings: You can track the value of any buildings owned by the company in
this account.
Try It
36
Part I: Exploring Bookkeeping Basics 

 Leasehold Improvements: If your company leases any facilities, you track the
value of any improvements that you did to this leased space in this account. For
example, if you lease a retail store, any improvements that you make to cus-
tomize this space for your business would be traced in this account.
 Vehicles: Any vehichles your company owns would be tracked in this account.
 Furniture and Fixtures: You track any furniture or fixtures purchased for use in
the business in this account.
 Equipment: You track any equipment that was purchased for use for more than
one year, such as computers, copiers, tools, and cash registers in this account. 
In addition to these accounts, each long-term asset account will have an accumulated
depreciation account to reflect the portion of the asset that already has been used up.
I talk more about depreciation in Chapter 11.
Exercise 3-2: Think about the long-term asset accounts you will need to track
for your business, and write down the accounts for those assets in this 
section.
Current Liabilities
Current liabilities are debts due in the next 12 months. Some of the most common
types of Current Liabilities accounts that appear on the Chart of Accounts include:
 Accounts Payable: You should track any money the company owes to vendors,
contractors, suppliers, and consultants that must be paid in the next 12 months
in this account.
 Sales Tax Collected: You may not think of sales tax as a liability, but because the
business collects taxes from customers and doesn’t pay them immediately to the
government, the taxes collected become a liability tracked in this account.
Try It
37
Chapter 3: Sorting Out Your Business Road Map

 Accrued Payroll Taxes: You should use this account to track payroll taxes col-
lected from employees to pay state, local, or federal income taxes as well as
Social Security and Medicare taxes.
 Credit Cards Payable: You should track all your company’s credit card accounts
to which the business is liable. 
How you set up your current liabilities and how many individual accounts you estab-
lish depends upon how detailed you want to track each type of liability. For example,
you can set up a separate Current Liability account for each of your major vendors if
you find that approach provides you with a better money management tool.
Exercise 3-3: Think about the Current Liabilites accounts you will need to
track for your business, and write down the accounts for those liabiliites in
this section.
Long-Term Liabilities
Long-term liabilities include any debts that are due in more than 12 months. The
number of Long-term Liabilities accounts you maintain on your Chart of Accounts
depends on your debt structure. The two most common types of long-term liability
accounts are
 Loans Payable: You use this account to track any long-term loans, such as a
mortgage on your business building. Most businesses have separate loans
payable accounts for each of their long-term loans. For example, you could have
Loans Payable – Mortgage Bank for your building and Loans Payable – Car Bank
for your vehicle loan.
Try It
38
Part I: Exploring Bookkeeping Basics 

 Notes Payable: Some businesses borrow money from other businesses using
notes, a method of borrowing that doesn’t require the company to put up an
asset, such as a mortgage on a building or a car loan, as collateral. This account
tracks any notes due.
In addition to any separate Long-term Debt accounts you may want to track in their own
account, you may also want to set up an account called “Other Liabilities.” You would
use this account to track debt that you don’t think needs its own individual account.
Exercise 3-4: Think about the Long-term Liabilities accounts you will need to
track for your business, and write down the accounts for those liabilities in
this section.
Equity
Every business is owned by somebody. Equity accounts track owners’ contributions 
to the business as well as their share of ownership. For a corporation, ownership is
tracked by the sale of individual shares of stock because each stockholder owns a por-
tion of the business. In smaller companies that are owned by one person or a group of
people, equity is tracked using Capital and Drawing accounts. Here are the basic
Equity accounts that appear in the Chart of Accounts:
 Common Stock: If your company is structured as a corporation, then the value
of outstanding shares of stock that were sold to investors would be tracked in
this account.
 Retained Earnings: Whether or not your company is incorporated, use this
account to track any earnings that were kept in the business.
Try It
39
Chapter 3: Sorting Out Your Business Road Map

 Capital: You use this account if you are keeping the books for a small, unincorpo-
rated business. The Capital account reflects the amount of initial money the
business owner contributed to the company as well as other owner contribu-
tions made after initial start-up.
 Drawing: This account is another that will be necessary if you are keeping the
books for a small, unincorporated business. The Drawing account tracks any
money that a business owner takes out of the business. If the business has sev-
eral partners, each partner gets his or her own Drawing account to track what he
or she takes out of the business.
Exercise 3-5: Think about the Equity accounts you will need to track for your
business, and write down the accounts you will need in this section.
Tracking Your Income Accounts
The Income Statement shows whether or not your business made a profit. Accounts
that you set up to produce this statement can be grouped into three types of accounts:
 Revenue: These accounts track all money coming into the business, including
sales, interest earned on savings, and any other methods used to generate
income.
 Cost of Goods Sold: These accounts track the money spent to manufacture or
buy the products you sell.
 Expenses: These accounts track all money that a business spends in order to
keep itself afloat.
Try It
40
Part I: Exploring Bookkeeping Basics 

This section examines the various accounts that make up the Income Statement por-
tion of the Chart of Accounts. You always start by listing the Revenue accounts, fol-
lowed by the Cost of Goods Sold accounts and then the Expenses accounts.
Revenue
In the revenue section, the accounts you set up will track all money taken into the
business from sales. If you choose to offer discounts or accept returns, that activity
also falls in this section. The most common income accounts are
 Sales of Goods or Services: You track all the money that the company earns sell-
ing its products, services, or both in this account.
 Sales Discounts: If you offer sales discounts, you track any reductions to the full
price of merchandise in this account.
 Sales Returns: Every business ends up needing to accept returns from cus-
tomers. You track any returns from customers in this account.
 Other Income: If your company takes in income from a source other then its pri-
mary business activity, you should record that income in this account. For exam-
ple, suppose you decide to encourage recycling and earn income from the items
recycled, record that income in this account.
Exercise 3-6: Think about the Revenue accounts you will need to track for
your business, and write down those accounts in this section.
Try It
41
Chapter 3: Sorting Out Your Business Road Map

Cost of Goods Sold
Before you can sell a product, you must spend some money to either buy or make that
product. You track these costs in accounts in the Cost of Goods Sold category. The
most common Cost of Goods Sold accounts include
 Purchases: Track all purchases of products in this account.
 Purchase Discount: If you get discounts on what you purchase, track them in
this account. For example, a company may give you a 2 percent discount on your
purchase if you pay the bill in 10 days rather than wait until the end of the 30-day
payment allotment.
 Purchase Returns: If you’re unhappy with a product you’ve bought, record the
value of any returns in this account.
 Freight Charges: Any charges related to shipping items you purchase for later
sale are tracked in this account. 
 Other Sales Costs: Use this account for any costs that don’t fit into one of the
other Cost of Goods Sold accounts.
Exercise 3-7: Think about the Cost of Goods Sold accounts you will need to
track for your business, and write down those accounts in this section.
Expenses
Your longest list of individual accounts will be the Expense accounts. Any money you
spend on the business that can’t be tied directly to the sale of an individual product
falls under the Expense account category. For example, advertising a storewide sale
Try It
42
Part I: Exploring Bookkeeping Basics 

isn’t directly tied to the sale of any one product, so the costs associated with advertis-
ing fall under the Expense account category. The most common Expense accounts
include
 Advertising: Tracks all expenses involved in promoting a business or its prod-
ucts. In this account money spent on newspaper, television, magazine, and radio
advertising is recorded as well as any money spent to print flyers and mailings to
customers. Also, when a company participates in community events such as
cancer walks or craft fairs, associated costs are tracked in this account as well.
 Bank Service Charges: Use this account to track any charges made by a bank to
service a company’s bank accounts.
 Dues and Subscriptions: Use this account to track expenses related to business
club membership or subscriptions to magazines for the business.
 Equipment Rental: Use this account to track expenses related to renting equip-
ment for a short-term project. For example, if you need to rent a truck to pick up
some new fixtures for the store, record that truck rental in this account.
 Insurance: Use this account to track expenses for buying insurance.
 Legal and Accounting: Use this account to track money paid for legal or
accounting advice.
 Miscellaneous Expenses: Use this account for expenses that don’t fit in other
accounts. If you start recording expenses in this account and later decide you want
to track them individually in their own account, you can choose to add an account
to the Chart of Accounts and move related expenses into that new account by
subtracting all related transactions from the Miscellaneous Expenses account
and adding them to the new account. With this movment of transactions, it’s
important to carefully balance out the adjusting transaction to avoid any errors
or double counting.
 Office Expense: Use this account to track any items purchased in order to run
an office. For example, office supplies such as paper and pens or business cards
fit in this account.
 Payroll Taxes: Use this account to track any taxes paid related to employee pay-
roll, such as the employer’s share of Social Security and Medicare, unemploy-
ment compensation, and workman’s compensation.
 Postage: Use this account to track any money spent on stamps, express package
shipping, and other shipping.
 Rent Expense: Use this account to track rental costs for a business’s office or
retail space.
 Salaries and Wages: Use this account to track any money paid to employees as
salary or wages.
 Supplies: Use this account to track any business supplies that don’t fit into the
category of office supplies. For example, supplies needed for the operation of
retail stores are tracked using this account.
 Travel and Entertainment: Use this account to track money spent for business
purposes for travel or entertainment. Some businesses separate these expenses
into several accounts, such as Travel and Entertainment; Meals, Travel and
Entertainment; Travel, and Travel and Entertainment; Entertainment to keep a
close watch.
43
Chapter 3: Sorting Out Your Business Road Map

 Telephone: Use this account to track all business expenses related to the tele-
phone and telephone calls.
 Utilities: Use this account to track money paid for utilities, such as electricity,
gas, and water.
 Vehicles: Use this account to track expenses related to the operation of company
vehicles.
Exercise 3-8: Think about the Expense accounts you will need to track for
your business, and write down those accounts in this section.
Setting Up Your Accounts Road Map
Use the lists you just developed to set up your Chart of Accounts. You can see there
really isn’t a secret to how these Chart of Accounts are set up. You set them up based
on how you believe your business will operate.
Your Chart of Accounts is not carved in stone. This is a chart that you can regularly
update as your business grows and changes. But, you should be very careful about
adding and subtracting accounts in the middle of an accounting period. 
If you want to add an account, you can do so at any time, but be sure you carefully
transfer the funds from the old account in which you were posting the transactions to
the new account you decide to set up. You do this with what is called an adjusting
journal entry. I talk more about adjusting entries amd reworking your Chart of
Try It
44
Part I: Exploring Bookkeeping Basics 

Accounts in Chapter 14. If you want to delete an account, indicate in your books that
no new transactions should be added to that account, but wait until the end of the
year to delete the account. 
When you set up the Chart of Accounts, plan for three columns. The column heads
would be
 Account: List all accounts by name.
 Type: List the type of account, such as asset, liability, equity, income, cost of
goods sold, expense.
 Description: Describe the types of transactions that will be posted to that
account.

You should include as much detail as you need when describing the accounts, so 
that all employees who are involved in entering transactions in the books or coding a
transaction to be entered into the books will know which account to specify for the
transaction. If transactions are not entered consistently, your financial reports won’t
be accurate.

Answers to Problems on Sorting 
Out Your Business Road Map
a
A: Current Assets. Inventory is considered an asset that will be used up in the next 12 months.
It is not an Expense or Cost of Goods Sold account. When inventory is actually purchased it is
recorded in the Purchases account, but the Inventory account tracks that inventory on hand in
the warehouse or on the store shelves at the end of an accounting period. To find out more
about inventory and how to track it, read Chapter 7.
b
B: Revenue. All money taken into the business from the sale of your products or services would
be recorded in Revenue accounts.
c
D: Expenses. Advertising is an expense because it usually involves the promotion of more than
just one individual item to be sold. Advertising draws people into the business with the hopes
of selling other items as well, so advertising transactions are not recorded in Cost of Goods
Sold accounts.
d
C: Costs of Goods Sold. As indicated in the answer to question 1, purchases of inventory are
recorded in Cost of Goods Sold accounts.
The remaining exercises in the chapter did not have right or wrong answers. You
should set up your Chart of Accounts with accounts that match how your business
operates.

Putting it All on Paper

In this part . . .
You’ll find the structure for entering business transac-
tions into your books a bit weird at first, but there is
a method to the madness that will help you keep your
books in balance. I introduce you to the method used to
correctly enter your financial transactions, how to post
transactions to your General Ledger (the granddaddy of
your bookkeeping system) and how to track all the trans-
action details in your journals.

 Correcting what’s there
A
ccountants and bookkeepers need one place they can go to review a summary of all
business transactions during an accounting period and get a look at the big picture.
The General Ledger is that place. 
This chapter introduces you to the General Ledger and how it is used. You will practice how
to create your own entries and how to post them to the General Ledger.
Preparing the Core of Your Financial Details
Think of the General Ledger as the core of a wide network of financial data. The accounts in
the General Ledger are based on your Chart of Accounts. Because it does include at least a 
summary of all financial transactions, the General Ledger would become too massive and
unwieldy if every piece of financial data was stored in that core. 
Instead many of the details about your financial transactions are stored in journals, which I
discuss in greater detail in Chapter 5. Most of the key entries in the General Ledger are sum-
maries of daily or monthly activity posted from one of the key journals where daily financial
transactions are recorded.
The most common journals include the Cash Disbursements Journal (tracks the daily use of
cash), Cash Receipts Journal (tracks daily cash received), Sales Journal (tracks day to day
sales), Purchases Journal (tracks purchases of products for sale), and the General Journal
(tracks miscellaneous financial transactions that are not tracked in their own journal). Now
this is by no means an exhaustive list of all the possible journals a business might have, but
they are the five main ones. Each company determines the level of detail it wants to keep and
how many different journals will be kept.
If your company has computerized your bookkeeping system, the journals are automatically
generated by the system as you enter financial transactions into the computer. You can view
the journals on the screen or print out them out.

Developing Entries for the Ledger
Since you enter much of your financial transaction data into journals, you’re probably
wondering how the information makes it into the General Ledger. At the end of each
month you total the entries in each journal and develop summary entries for the
General Ledger. As you develop each entry for the General Ledger, you must be sure
the entry is in balance, which means the total of your debits must equal the total of
your credits.
In Figure 4-1, I show you a sample page from a Purchases Journal. You can see that
there is a column for the date of the transaction, the vendor, an invoice number, a
Purchases debit, and an Accounts Payable credit. Each time products are purchased
for sale the debit to the Purchases account will increase the amount of money spent
on Purchases and the credit to the Accounts Payable account will increase the amount
of money owed to vendors.
At the end of the month when it is time to develop an entry for the General Ledger, 
the Purchases Journal columns will be totaled. Then a summary entry will developed
based on those totals.

Using the information from Figure 4-4, how would you develop an entry for the General Ledger to

Posting Your Entries
After you develop your entries, you need to post them to the accounts in the
General Ledger. When you post entries to the General Ledger, you must make sure
you can track back those entries to their original location in the books. For example,
if you are posting an entry that summarizes activity from the Purchases Journal, you
would want to include a reference to the page in that journal from which the sum-
mary was taken. That way if there are any questions about an entry posted to the
General Ledger, you have a way of tracing the source of the posted information and
researching any questions that arise.

The entry developed for the General

of the Purchases Journal on May 31 was
Account
Debit
Credit
Purchases
$4,250
Accounts Payable
$4,250
How would you record the entry into the
General Ledger accounts of Purchases and
Accounts Payable?
A.
Review Figures 4-5 and 4-6 to see how these
entries would be posted to General Ledger
accounts.
Each account in the General Ledger will
have a separate page or pages. Entries will
be made from journals or directly to the
General Ledger throughout the month. At
the end of the month the account balance
will be totaled. I talk more about how to
close the books out at the end of the
month or end of another accounting
period, such as a quarter or year, in
Chapter 13.
You can see that the date of the entry is
placed in the first column. Next you will
find a description indicating the source of
the entry, followed by a reference number
(which for a journal entry would be the
page of the journal on which it is found);
then you would post any debits to the
debit column and any credits to the credit
column.

Adjusting for Errors
Entries that you make into the General Ledger are not cast in stone. You can always
adjust those entries. I talk more about how to do that in Chapter 14. Three of the most
common reasons for making an adjusting entry include
 Depreciation: This shows how an asset is being used up and allocates the cost
of using that asset over the life of the asset. I talk more about depreciation in
Chapter 11. Most companies post adjusting entries for depreciation once a year,
but it can be done more frequently.
 Prepaid expenses: Expenses that you must prepay, such as a 12-month premium
on an insurance policy, are expensed on a monthly basis using an adjusting
entry. I talk more about how to do that in Chapter 14.
 Adding an account: When an account is added, you may need to move some
transactions that were posted in one account to the new account. You do this
using an adjusting entry, removing the dollar amount from the account where it
was first posted, and then entering the amount into the new account. I talk more
about this process in Chapter 14.

B: General Journal. The purchase of new furniture for the store would actually be an asset and
not a cost for the purpose of purchasing or manufacturing items for sale. Therefore, you would
not put it in the Purchases Journal, but instead in the journal for miscellaneous entries — the
General Journal.

Note that in this case the accounts that were posted to a specific company are not listed. A
Purchase Return is a product that you intended to sell but returned to a vendor. Therefore, you
reduce the amount you owe that vendor by debiting Accounts Payable, which would reduce the
amount due in Accounts Payable. When a customer returns a product to you, you must reduce
the amount the customer owes. You would not only reduce the amount in that customer’s
account, but you would also credit Accounts Receivable where you track payments due from
customers.

N
ot every business transaction can be found in the General Ledger. Imagine how many
volumes the General Leger would need to be if every single purchase, every single
credit for the return of an item, and every other financial activity was individually listed in
the General Ledger? For a major corporation this can be thousands or even millions of
transactions each month. 
To keep the General Ledger more manageable journals are kept for active accounts and only
their daily, weekly, or monthly summaries are posted to the General Ledger. In this chapter
you’ll find the types of accounts for which journals are kept and how entries are made in
these journals. 
Defining Your Journals
Journals give you a place to look for the details on every transaction in your business. Rather
than jumble all the thousands of transactions in the General Ledger (see Chapter 4), which
would make it difficult to find anything, bookkeepers set up a series of journals for the most
active accounts, such as Cash Receipts, Cash Disbursements, Sales, and Purchases.
Using these journals, the detail can easily be found about specific financial activity and a
summary of the day’s, week’s, or month’s activity are posted to the General Ledger so that
financial reporting can be done. Think of the journals as a place for the details and the
General Ledger as the place you look for the big picture.
When entering a transaction in your books the first place it is entered is the journal for that
type of transaction. Journals are kept in chronological order. For example the sales transac-
tions for the day would be entered into the Sales Journal. 
Each entry should include information about the date of the transaction, the accounts to
which the transaction will be posted, and the location of the source material used for devel-
oping the transaction. After posting to the Sales Journal, you would then post the informa-
tion to the accounts impacted by the transaction. For example, suppose a customer bought
an item on store credit. You would post the information from the Sales Journal to the cus-
tomer’s account in addition to the summary that will be posted to the General Ledger. 

Tracking Cash
You’ll deal with cash transactions many times every day and you certainly want to
keep track of every penny that goes in and out of your business. In fact, cash transac-
tions are so numerous that bookkeepers keep two journals — one for incoming cash
(Cash Receipts Journal) and one for outgoing cash (Cash Disbursements Journal).
That way a business owner can quickly get a summary of how much cash came into
the business and how much cash went out of the business in any one day, week, or
month.
Tracking the Receipts
The first place you enter cash receipts in your books is the Cash Receipts Journal. The
majority of that cash will come from sales, but other possible sources of cash include
deposits of capital from the company’s owner, customer bill payments, new loan pro-
ceeds, and interest from savings accounts. 
When you enter the cash in the books you must indicate how it was received and into
which account it was credited. For example, when a customer pays a bill the cash
would be debited to the Cash account and credited to the Accounts Receivable
account. You don’t put it into the Sales account, because that account was credited
when the Sale was originally completed and the Accounts Receivable account was 
debited. Now you have to reverse that debit to Accounts Receivable with a credit to
indicate that the money is no longer due. In addition, you would need to credit the
payment to the customer’s individual account as well.
In Figure 5-1, I show you a sample page in a Cash Receipts Journal. Note that there are
seven columns of information:
Date: Transaction date
Account Credited: Account that will be credited
PR (post reference): This information is filled in at the end of the month to indi-
cate where in the General Ledger the information is posted. As you post to the
General Ledger you indicate the completion of that post in the column so you can
be sure you haven’t missed anything. At the end of the month when the informa-
tion is posted the columns will be totaled. You can post just the summary total of
the Accounts Receivable, Sales, and Cash accounts and put a check next to the
entries that are part of the summary total. Any entries that are not part of the
summary total will need to be posted individually to the General Ledger and an
indication of where it was posted would be put in the PR column.
General Credit: This column is for transactions that are not tracked in their own
column in the journal, since it involves an account that does not frequently
involve a cash transaction. In Figure 5-1 you see that Art (one of the owner’s)
made a cash deposit into the business of $1,500.
Accounts Receivable Credit: All customer payments are credited to this column
and will be summarized to the Accounts Receivable account at the end of the
month.
Sales Credit: Total cash sales for each day are credited to this column and will be
summarized in the Sales account at the end of the month.
Cash Debit: The total of this column will be debited to the Cash account at the
end of the month. Remember a debit to the Cash account increases the balance of
that account.

Chapter 5: Journaling — The Devil’s in the Details
If you have another account with frequent cash inflows, you can add a column to track
that account just as Accounts Receivable, Sales, and Cash are tracked in Figure 5-1.
The big advantage to having columns for active accounts is that you can post a sum-
mary entry into the General Ledger at the end of the month, rather than an individual
entry for each transaction. It saves a lot of time and minimizes the bits of information
that must be posted to the General Ledger.

Keeping an eye on outgoing cash
Cash sent out of the business is tracked in a similar way to Cash Receipts using a
Cash Disbursements Journal. In this journal, you would track bills you pay, salaries,
rent and any other use of business cash. In this case all the accounts involved are
debited and the Cash account is credited. A credit to the Cash account reduces the
amount of cash you have available.
In Figure 5-2, you will see that some of the columns for the Cash Disbursement
Journal look similar — the Date, Account Debited, PR and General Debit (for miscel-
laneous debits) are the first four columns. You add Accounts Payable debit (for bills
paid) and Salaries debit (for cash used to pay employees). The final column is for
the Cash Credit. You can add more columns for accounts that experience frequent
transactions during the month.

Managing Sales
If your business permits customers to buy on store credit, then not all sales involve
the use of cash. Non-cash sales are tracked in a Sales Journal. When you make an
entry in the Sales Journal you credit sales, but you also must remember to update
the customer’s individual record so that you can bill the customer at the end of the
month. 
The most common columns you’ll find in a Sales Journal include Date, Customer
Account Debited, PR, Invoice Number, Accounts Receivable Debit, and Sales Credit.
Note that in this journal you track both the customer name and the invoice, so that if
the customer has a question when the bill comes in, you will have enough detail in
the Sales Journal to send out a copy of the transaction.
The Sales journal allows the bookkeeper to project future cash inflows based on out-
standing customer accounts. The owner can use the information to project possible
cash shortage or plan for extra cash that can be used to grow the business when the
money comes in.

Watching Purchases
A common way for business people to obligate future cash purchases, without actu-
ally laying out any cash, is through purchase orders for supplies and other business
needs. Bookkeepers track these noncash obligations in the Purchases Journal. Using
the Purchases Journal, the bookkeeper can quickly know the level of cash that will
be needed to pay bills during the next month.
Common columns in the Purchases Journal include the date, Vendor Account
Credited (where you indicate the company from where the items were purchased),
PR, Invoice Number, Purchases Debit (expenses from Purchases), and Accounts
Payable credit. When the Accounts Payable account is credited, that means the
account increases in value and additional money will be owed in the future.
Invoice numbers will not be consecutive for purchases because the number is 
supplied by the company from which you ordered. You enter the transaction in the
Purchases account when you receive the invoice for the goods ordered. Payment 
of the invoice will be made after you receive approval from the department that
ordered the goods. You should check for that approval before paying an invoice, in
case there are any problems with the delivery.

Dealing with Miscellaneous Transactions
Not all of your transactions will fit neatly into one of these four main journals. If you
have frequent transactions and you want to establish another journal, you can
always create one developing the columns that can track the needed information.
Otherwise, you can put miscellaneous transactions in a General Journal and post
them to the General Ledger at the end of the month.
Common columns in a General Journal include the Date, Account, PR, General 
Debit (for most debits), and General Credit (for most credits). You will also find 
that these miscellaneous transactions usually impact Accounts Payable or 
Accounts Receivable accounts. It’s good to add a column for each of those accounts. 
Solve It

Chapter 5: Journaling — The Devil’s in the Details

The primary description of the transaction will be in the second column, called
“Account.” In this column you will probably need more detail about the transaction
than with other journals because you will be posting so many different types of
transactions impacting various accounts. In Figure 5-3, I show you a sample page
from a General Journal.
Note that in Figure 5-3, a Sales Return is entered in the General Debit column and 
will be posted to the Sales Return account in the General Ledger, while the credit is
posted in the Accounts Receivable Credit column because a returned item means
the amount due from the customer is reduced. You will also need to use the informa-
tion in the column to indicate details about whose account should be credited.
The Purchase Return to Henry’s Packing shows debit memo detail. The Purchase
Return account will be credited and the Accounts Payable will be debited. The busi-
ness owes less money to Henry’s Packing. The same is true for the purchase return
transaction and debit memo from Deb’s Paper Goods.
The final transaction on that journal page is the purchase of office furniture with a
credit card. In this case both the debit and credit are put in the general columns
because neither the Accounts Payable nor the Accounts Receivable accounts will be
impacted by that transaction.

efore even opening the door of your business, establishing strong internal processes
and controls for business operations is crucial. How employees will handle and moni-
tor cash taken in or paid out, can make or break a business. 
In this chapter, you will review the key concepts of how to set up cash handling procedures.
You will find ideas about how to design filing systems to be sure you keep all the proper
records. You’ll also discover how to develop internal control procedures for your com-
pany’s assets. 
Getting a Handle on Cash
Cash flows through you business in four key ways:
 Deposits into and payments out of your checking accounts
 Deposits to and withdrawals from your savings accounts
 Petty cash availability in certain key locations where cash payments may be required
 Cash register transactions
You must be able to track when cash comes in and when cash goes out at any of the four
locations. Without proper handling, you’ll find cash has a way to slip through the cracks and
out of your business.
Finding the right bank and controlling 
banking transactions
Your main tools for tracking the use of your cash are the bank or banks you choose for your
accounts. You want a bank that is open the hours you need it and that has a way to deposit
funds 24 hours a day, You also want a bank located near your business, so it will be conven-
ient for you and your employees to conduct business.

In addition to location and times of operation, you want a bank that will offer you all
the services you need. Check carefully to find out how much the bank charges for each
of the services you expect to need. You will find service charges vary greatly among
banks and you can save a lot of money if you shop carefully for a bank. Some banks
charge for every transaction done with a teller; others charge for transaction at the
automatic teller machine (ATM). Some charge if you want copies of your checks.
Others charge to get your checks printed, while some will print checks for free. Write
down the services that are important to your business and find out what those serv-
ices will cost at each of the banks you are considering.
Picking Checks
The check style you choose can be critical to managing dispersal of funds. First you
need to think about how you will disperse checks. You can do it by handwriting each
check or you can print your checks by computer. You will need different checks
depending on how you plan to prepare your checks.
If you plan to do them by writing them out manually, then you will need to order
voucher checks. Voucher checks usually are printed three to a page and put into a
binder. When the check is written, the voucher to the left is completed to list the date,
who the check was written to, and the reason for the check. On the right of the
voucher you keep a running total of your checking account balance. 
Each check and voucher is numbered to match and if a voucher or check is missing,
you must find out why and how the check was used. It could be a sign of misuse of
company funds. When someone makes a mistake in writing out, a check the voided
check and voucher should be left in the checkbook, so you can account for all num-
bered checks.
If you plan to print your checks as needed by computer, then you would order checks
based on the computerized bookkeeping system you use. 
These checks are printed with the top third of the page the actual check to be cashed.
The middle third is where detail is printed for the customer about the dispersal, such
as payment of a particular invoice or contract. The bottom third would have all the
detail you need to track the use of the check in your own accounting system. Note that
each of the three sections has a matching number in the upper-left corner. Your com-
puterized print checks will be numbered and if you find a missing number that could
be the sign of a check not used appropriately. You will need to find out how the miss-
ing check was used. Any checks on which a mistake was made should be saved and
voided, so you can keep track of all numbered checks.
Signing checks
In addition to setting up a procedure for controlling the preparation of checks, you
also need to set up controls about who can sign checks and let the bank know the 
controls you have in place. For example, you may decide that certain people in the
company are authorized to sign checks of $1,000 or less and others can sign checks
between $1,000 and $10,000. You may want to require two signatures on all checks
over $10,000. 
Your bank can help you establish check-signing authority and will have forms you’ll
need to complete to designate authorized employees. Each authorized employee will
need to sign the form, so that the bank has a copy of the signature on file in case a
question about a check arises.
Handling deposits
Another key point of entry, depositing of funds, must also be carefully monitored and
recorded. First, you should tell whoever opens the mail to immediately stamp “for
deposit only” on the back of any check received, so you don’t risk the check being

used fraudulently. Your best bet is to have a stamp made up that says “For deposit
only” as well as your bank account number. That way you know all checks will be
deposited in the right account. Some companies where a lot of checks come by mail
require that two people be involved in the opening of the mail to avoid any misappro-
priation of funds.
When all checks are ready for deposit, the person preparing the deposit should list the
number of all checks being deposited, the company or individual that sent the check,
and the amount of the check. Then all checks should be copied, so you have a record
of the checks in case there is an error at the bank or a question about the check. After
the deposit is completed a receipt for the deposit, a copy of the list of checks, and all
the photocopied checks should be attached together and filed in your daily bank
folder. I talk more about “Organizing Your Record Keeping” below.
Q.
When trying to find the right bank, what
should you look for?
a. How close the bank is to your business
b. The hours of operation

Savings accounts
If you do have extra cash that won’t be needed for the daily operations of the busi-
ness, you probably will want to deposit this cash in an interest bearing account. You
can set up a transfer between the checking and savings accounts, but you should be
very careful about who is authorized to access that transfer capability. For many small
businesses, only the owner or the owner and his partners will have access to transfer
money between checking and savings accounts. In a larger corporation, the transfer
rights may be given to the chief financial officer and the comptroller.
Petty cash accounts
Many businesses find they have a need for small amounts of cash for unexpected needs
during the week. For example, if a package arrives with postage due, the person at the
reception desk may need a couple dollars for the postal delivery person. Employees
may have a rush need for office supplies to finish up a project and draw from petty cash
to run to a local store rather than wait for the official office supply order. 

83
Chapter 6: Designing Controls for Your Books, Your Records, and Your Money
Whatever the reason you can set up petty cash boxes that are handled by certain
trusted staff, such as the office manager. You may designate that they keep $50 to $100
on hand for office cash emergencies. Prepare a form that needs to be completed when-
ever cash is used. This form should include the name of the person who gets the cash
and the purpose for the cash. When a person handling petty cash needs more cash,
they must first account for how the cash they had was used.
Cash Registers
If you are running or working for a retail business, most of your cash will come into the
business at your point of sale — the cash register. You need tight controls to be sure
that cash makes it into the business and not into the pockets of people working the
registers. Since you should have them prove out their cash each night, cashiers get
more creative than just pocketing cash. There are three ways cashiers can pocket cash
without coming up short at the end of the day:
 Don’t record the sale and pocket the cash: Make sure your cash register transac-
tions match your sales receipts.
 Don’t provide a sales receipt and pocket the cash: To avoid this make sure you
post that a receipt is needed for all returns and exchanges. Customers will help
you make sure a receipt is prepared for all sales.
 Prepare a false credit voucher and keep the cash: Establish procedures that
require a manager’s approval for all cash returned.
Whenever cash is involved, it gives employees an enticement that you must control.
Businesses put up barriers to make it difficult for employees to pocket cash, if they are
in cash handling positions. As the bookkeeper it is your responsibility to be involved
in the design of sales receipts and cash vouchers and to be sure these vouchers are
being used according to company policy.

Who should control deposits into and with-
drawals out of a savings account?

If you are working for a small company, the
deposit of money into and withdrawals out
of a savings account will most likely be
handled by the owner or partners. In a
large corporation, the chief financial officer
and comptroller, or someone they specifi-
cally designate, will likely be responsible
for major disbursements from a savings
account.

Organizing Your Record Keeping
Everything you do in your business is going to generate paperwork that you may or
may not want to keep. You need to decide what to keep, and what you do keep you
need to organize so you can access quickly when you need it. If you computerize your
accounting you may not need to keep as much paper, but you still want a paper trail in
case something happens to your computer records or you need the backup informa-
tion for a transaction that is questioned at a later date.
Obviously, file cabinets are where you’ll store most of your records for the current
year and the prior year. Older files you may store in boxes in a warehouse or store-
room if you don’t have room in your file cabinets. How you set up the files can be 
critical to your ability to find something when you need it. Many bookkeepers use four
different methods to store accounting information:
 File folders: these are used for filing invoice, payment, and contract information
about vendors; information about individual employees, such as payroll related
forms and data; and information about individual customer accounts.
 Three-ring binders: Your Chart of Accounts (see Chapter 3), General Ledger (see
Chapter 4), and Journals (see Chapter 5) are usually kept in three-ring binders.
Even if you do use a computerized accounting system, it’s a good idea to keep a
copy of this for the month most recently closed and the current month in hard
copy in case your computer system goes down and you need to quickly check
information.
 Expandable files: These types of files are good for managing outstanding bills
and vendor activity. You can get alphabetical expandable files for managing
pending vendor invoices and purchase orders. You can use 30-day and 12-month
expandable files for managing outstanding bills. As bills come in you can place
them in the 12-month file for the month they are due. Then move the current
month’s bills to the 30-day file by the day they are due. You may be able to avoid
using these files if you are using a computerized bookkeeping system and set up
the bill pay reminder system in your accounting program.
 Media for storing backup computer data: If you are keeping the books on com-
puter, be certain you make at least one backup copy of all your data daily and
store it in a safe place — a place where the data won’t be destroyed if there is a
fire. A good alternative could be a small fire safe if your business does not have a
built-in safe.
You’ll find it doesn’t take long to build up lots of paper and not have room to store it
all. Luckily not everything has to be kept forever. Generally anything related to tax
returns has to be kept for at least three years, but once you’re past three years the IRS
can’t audit you unless it suspects fraud. So you can get rid of most of your paperwork
once it is four years old.
Some exceptions include employees. Those records you must keep until the employee
has left the employment of the company for at least three years. The statute of limita-
tions for most actions that can be filed by an ex-employee is three years after they left.
In the fourth year, you will be able to get rid of most of your paperwork, but you may
want to keep certain sensitive data longer. Any information about assets that are still
held by the company should be kept. You also should keep any information about
pending legal issues. Check with your attorney and your accountant before destroying
old paperwork and be certain you are not tossing something that could be needed.

Protecting Your Business 
from Theft and Fraud
Every business owner faces the possibility of theft or fraud. Too often business owners
find out about an employee pocketing some assets when it’s too late to do anything
about it. Even the most loyal employee can be driven to steal if their personal financial
pressures become too great. There are four basic types of financial fraud a business
owner may face:
 Embezzlement: This involves the theft of funds by a person who actually has
control of the funds, such as a bookkeeper or comptroller.
 Internal theft: This involves the theft of company assets by employees, such as
office supplies or merchandise on store shelves.
 Payoffs and kickbacks: This involves the acceptance of payments by vendors
for sending business their way.
 Skimming: This involves pocketing some of the company’s sales receipts and
not recording the revenue on the books.
Your best defense against theft and fraud is to put up barriers to discourage it. You do
this by dividing staff responsibilities to reduce the possibility and opportunity for theft
and fraud. Here are some key tips for controlling your cash and minimizing theft and
fraud:
 Separate cash handlers: Be sure that the person who accepts the cash is not the
same person who records the transaction in the books.
 Separate authorization responsibilities: Be sure that the person who authorizes
a check is not the same as the person who prepares the check. If possible a third
person should be the one to sign the checks. That way three people would have
to collude to steal money using a company check.
 Separate bookkeeping functions: Don’t put too much authority or trust in one
person (unless that person is the business owner).
 Separate operational responsibility: Be sure you have one person who accepts
the cash transactions and a second person who enters those transactions in the
books. For example the person who handles the cash register should not be the
one who makes the bank deposit. 
 Separate financial reporting: Be sure that the person who prepares your finan-
cial reports is not the same person who is responsible for entering the data day
to day in your books. Often an outside accountant is responsible for using the
data entered to prepare the financial reports if a business does not have an
accountant on staff.
Q.
If an employee who keeps the books, finds
a way to fudge the numbers and take some
of the business’s cash for himself, this is
called
a. Embezzlement
b. Internal theft
c. Kickback
d. Skimming

should not have the authority to sign the
checks.
d. All of the above.

Taking Out a Bond
Whenever you have employees who you expect to handle a lot of cash, you should
consider insuring your business against possible theft. This type of insurance is called
fidelity bonds, which are commonly included as part of an overall insurance package. 
If you do carry this type of insurance and an employee steals money, you are covered
for the loss of those funds. You also have coverage if an employee’s act causes a loss
to a client of your business. For more information on fidelity bonds talk with your busi-
ness insurance agent.

very business must have something to sell. Whether selling products or services, you
do spend money on items that will later be sold, which becomes inventory until sold.
You also need supplies to run the business. 
This chapter reviews how to track your purchases, manage inventory, and pay for the items
bought. You’ll practice how to value your inventory and pay the bills.
Detailing and Managing Your Inventory
Bookkeepers track their inventory in two different accounts — Purchases and Inventory.
When you initially buy goods to sell, those transactions are tracked in the Purchases
account, which is an expense account and shown on the Income Statement (see Chapter 16
for more information on the Income Statement). When you prepare your financial reports at
the end of the month, any goods still on the shelves are then tracked in an asset account
called Inventory, which is shown on the Balance Sheet (see Chapter 15 for more information
on the Balance Sheet).
When tracking that inventory, companies do so in two different ways — periodic inventory
and perpetual inventory:
 Periodic inventory: When goods on hand are tracked using a periodic inventory
system, a physical count is conducted of the goods in the store as well as in the ware-
house. This count can be done on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. In an
active retail environment, store counts often are done daily. You’ve probably seen signs
on store windows indicating that the store is closed for an entire day to count inven-
tory. That usually happens at the end of the year as a company prepares its financial
statements or in the process of a company audit.
 Perpetual inventory: When goods on hand are tracked as they are sold, that’s called a
perpetual inventory system. This type of system must be done using a computer soft-
ware program that is integrated with the accounting system. You’ll see this today in
many major retail stores where bar codes are used and the actual item purchased
shows on your receipt. Inventory counts are adjusted automatically. Even when this

Determining inventory value
When you first enter a purchase in the books, you enter its value based on the cost
that you paid for those goods. But, the way you track the value of that inventory is
often not the same as the actual cost. For example, a hardware store that buys and
sells hammers can’t possibly keep track of how much it paid for each individual
hammer on the shelf. One week when an order comes in the price from the manufac-
turer may be $5 for the hammer and the next week it may be $5.50. It would be a night-
mare for the store owner to keep track of the price on each hammer and then calculate
exactly how much profit was made on each hammer. 
Instead of trying to track each individual item, bookkeepers use various methods for
valuing inventory. Your company must choose one method and follow that method all
the time. If the company decides to change its inventory valuation method, than it
must file forms with the IRS. The value of inventory sold can impact how much profit 
a company will make. Let’s look at how that happens.

d. Specific Identification
Solve It
The four most common types of inventory valuing methods include
 LIFO (Last In, First Out): With this method of valuing inventory, a store owner
assumes that the last product put on the shelf is the first product sold when he’s
calculating the value of his inventory for the books and his financial report. LIFO
is most often used by a business that does not have to worry about spoilage. For
example a hardware store that receives new hammers is not likely to carefully
empty the shelves, put the newest hammers at the back of the shelf and then put
the oldest hammers in the front. Instead, when a new shipment arrives the
newest hammers will be put out front, so they’ll be sold first. The actual price he
sells his hammers to customers will be the same no matter when he put them on
the shelves.
 FIFO (First In, First Out): With this method of valuing inventory, a store owner
assumes that the first in (oldest item) is the first one sold when he’s calculating
the value of his inventory for the books and his financial records. Food stores
commonly use this system because they must worry about spoilage. When you
go to the store, you know that you will always find the oldest milk (the milk that
will expire first) at the front of the shelf and the newest milk (the milk with a
longer time until expiration) will be in the back. That store is using a first in, first
out method of counting inventory — trying to get the product that came in first
to sell first.
 Averaging: With this method of inventory, a company doesn’t worry about what
came in first or last. Instead it averages the cost of inventory when calculating
inventory value. 
 Specific identification: With this method of inventory, the store owner does
keep track of how much he paid for each individual item. This type of inventory
method is only used when big ticket items are sold. For example, a car dealer will
keep track of how much he paid for each car and for how much each car sold.

He started the month with 50 hammers worth $250. At the end of the month, when he
counts what is left on the shelf, he has 75 units left. What is the value of his ending
inventory and what was the cost of goods sold?
To calculate inventory value you start with the number of inventory at the beginning
of the month. Then add the purchases made during the month. That total will give
you the number of goods you had available for sale. Then you subtract the amount
of inventory left on the shelf. The inventory left on the shelf would be the ending
inventory and the difference between inventory available for sale and ending inven-
tory would be the cost of goods sold. The ending inventory would be the value that
you would put in the asset account Inventory shown on the Balance Sheet and the
cost of goods shown would be an expense on the Income Statement.
Here is how you would calculate the cost of goods sold and ending inventory using
the Averaging method:
Beginning Inventory

Using the same purchase information for the hammers shown in the example above,

Since FIFO is first in, first out, you would start the calculation with the beginning
inventory of 50 hammers at $5 and assume those were sold first.
Beginning Inventory

Next in: April 1

Cost of Goods Sold
$3,125.00
Ending Inventory

Note that the ending inventory had a greater value than when the Averaging method
was used and the cost of goods sold was lower. That’s because the remaining inven-

Solve It
Using the same purchase information for the hammers shown in the example above, how would you

There was a beginning inventory of 50 hammers purchased at $5 each, ending inventory of 75 ham-
mers. Additional purchases were

$5.00
April 10

Since LIFO is last in first out, you would start the calculation with the beginning
inventory of 50 hammers at $5 and assume those were sold last. The first hammers
sold are the ones that were received last, so you would start with the 200 hammers
bought on April 20.
First sold: April 20 purchase
200 @ $8.00
$1,600.00
Next sold: April 10
150 @ $7.50
$1,125.00
Then knowing that you had 75 hammers left, 50 of them would be the oldest units at
$5 from the beginning inventory and 25 would be from the purchase on April 1 at $5.
Next sold: April 1
125 @ $5.00
$625.00
Cost of Goods Sold
$3,350.00
Ending Inventory
75 @ $5.00
$375.00
Note that the ending inventory using the LIFO method has the lowest value of the
three and the cost of goods sold is the highest.

You can see that as the bookkeeper, it is critical for you to know the inventory valua-
tion method the owner of the company uses. If the cost of goods sold total is higher,
then the expenses for the period will be higher and the profit will be lower. That means
the owner will pay less taxes because he shows a lower profit. A lower cost of goods
sold total will mean the profit will be higher and the taxes will be higher. The Averaging
method falls in between these two inventory valuation types. 
Buying and monitoring office supplies
In addition to purchasing items for sale, your company also buys office supplies and
other items that are needed for the everyday operation of the business. Most likely
you will record these purchases by debiting an expense account called Office Supplies
and crediting the Cash account (if the purchase was made using cash) or an Accounts
Payable account (if the purchase was made on credit). 
How carefully you need to monitor the use of the office supplies will depend on your
company. Many companies don’t require the bookkeeper to monitor anything but the
actual expenses and require the management of office supplies to be done by the
office manager or supply manager.
Paying Your Bills
After recording the purchases, the bookkeeper takes primary responsibility for making
sure that the bills are paid for both the inventory and the supplies purchased. Usually,
you will post the bills to Accounts Payable when they arrive, file them in the month or
day to be paid, and pay them when they are due.
There are five key functions for paying the bills:
 Entering the bills into the accounting system
 Preparing the checks for paying the bills
 Signing the checks
 Sending out the payment to the vendors
 Reconciling the checking account
One person should not be responsible for all these tasks. In fact the person who enters
the bills into the accounting system and prepares the checks, should never be the one
with the authority to sign the checks. To be even more careful about cash control, it’s
a good idea to have a third person review the checks against the bills due and actually
send the signed checks out to the vendors. By separating these tasks you minimize the
risk that business funds will be misused. 
A key function of Accounts Payable is to keep track of any discounts your company
may be able to take. For example, sometimes a company will offer a 2 percent discount
on a bill if paid within 10 days and expect payment in full between 10 days and 30 days.
Then, there could be a late penalty of 1.5 percent interest for payments received after
30 days. The Accounts Payable clerk should organize the bills to pay them in time to
take advantage of the discount and save his company money.

Q.
Suppose a company received a bill for
$100,000 on March 31 that was stamped
“2% 10 Net 30.” What does it mean and
when should the bill be paid?
A.
The stamp “2% 10 Net 30” means that the
company can take a 2 percent discount 
if paid by April 10; otherwise the full
amount is due if paid between April 11 
and April 30. To calculate the discount 
you would multiply the total amount of the
invoice by 2 percent and then subtract that
amount from the bill total to find the dis-
counted amount due.
$100,000 × 2%
=
$2,000
So the company would save $2,000 if it
pays the bill by April 10. Companies can
save a lot of money during the month by
taking advantage of vendor discounts.

The stamp means that the company can receive a 3 percent discount if it pays the bill in 10
days by April 10 and no discount if the bill is paid between April 11 and April 30. The discount
will be $15,000 if paid by April 10. So the bookkeeper should pay the bill by April 10.

 Tracking sales returns and allowances
 Acknowledging nonpayers
You love to take in money when you run a business. Everyone does. But once that
money starts coming in that door it’s important that you properly track that cash 
and credit. 
Tracking the cash is not enough, you also must:
 Record transactions in your books
 Track individual customer accounts
 Record any discounts that were offered
 Track any returns or allowances that were given to customers
 Collect from customers to whom you sell on credit
 Monitor customer accounts to be sure they pay on time
 Write off accounts from customers who just won’t pay
This chapter helps you practice the key elements of tracking your sales, recording them
properly in the books, and monitoring all the accounts related to your sales.
Taking in Cash
First you need to know what is cash and what is not. That may sound strange but cash does
not only include the dollar bills and coins that you receive. You also count customer checks
as cash, as well as items bought on credit cards, as long as those credit cards were not
issued by you. 
When it comes to buying on credit for the purposes of your bookkeeping, the only purchases
that need to be tracked in Accounts Receivable are purchases that involve credit issued by
your store. Credit card purchases on credit cards issued by banks or other financial institu-
tions should be listed as cash. In fact, today with the electronic transfer of funds, many 
companies will see the money show up in their bank account almost immediately after the
purchase. It all depends upon how you have set up to receive your money through the bank
that handles your credit transactions.

The information from this entry would be recorded in your Sales Journal. For more
information about Sales Journals and other types of journals you need to maintain,
read Chapter 5. Note that you would enter a Debit to the Cash in Checking account and
a Credit to the Sales and Sales Tax Collected accounts. An equal amount was posted to
both the Debits as there was to the Credits. That should always be true. Your book-
keeping entries should always be in balance. These entries would increase the amount
in all three accounts. To understand more about how Debits and Credits work read
Chapter 2.
Most likely when you work for a company, you will get a summary of total sales for the
day and may not necessarily need to add up each receipt. It all depends on the types
of cash registers used in your store. The entry into your books would most likely be a
total of cash sales on a daily basis.

You can also track inventory using the information collected in the sales receipt. I talk
more about that in Chapter 7.
Selling on Credit
Many stores also decide to allow their customers to buy using credit offered directly
by the store. In these cases the account is not offered by a bank, but instead by the
store owner. This gives the store owner the ability to be more flexible about the credit
terms and may help to attract customers who otherwise couldn’t buy items in the
store. For example, a church may have different members who pick up baked goods
for church events. The church can authorize certain people to charge to the church
account.
If you are the bookkeeper for a company that does allow customers to buy on credit,
you will be responsible for recording the sales transactions, as well as maintaining the
individual records of customers who buy on store credit.
As a bookkeeper, you also can get all the information you need to enter credit transac-
tions in the books from your sales receipts. The key difference will be the information
provided on a receipt for a credit transaction. You will find information about the cus-
tomer and his account number on the receipt. You can use this additional information
to record transactions in the customer’s records so you will be able to bill the cus-
tomer at a later date. 
Suppose you are the bookkeeper for a bakery, which does allow customers to buy on
credit. Here is what a sales receipt might look like:

Q.
So how would you use this information to

In addition to recording the sales transaction in your Sales Journal, you would also
need to record the transaction in the customer’s account. That account could be main-
tained on a computer worksheet, in a paper journal, or on cards for each customer.
Whichever way your company tracks individual customer accounts, here’s the entry
that you would need to make to the account of the First Baptist Church:
2/15/2007
Baked Goods — Sales Receipt #456

When you record a transaction in a customer’s account, you want to be sure you have
enough identifying information to be able to find the original sales transaction in case
the customer questions the charge when you send the bill at the end of the month. In
the section, “Collecting from Your Customers” below, I show you how to use this infor-
mation to bill and collect from your customers.

Checking Your Register
You want to be sure that none of your cashiers make mistakes during the day in giving
change to customers. You also want to be sure that your cashiers don’t decide to
pocket any of the cash for themselves.
You monitor cash by knowing exactly how much cash was in the register at the begin-
ning of the day and then checking how much cash is left at the end of the day. You
should count the cash at the end of the day as soon as all sales transactions have been
completed. You should also print out a summary of all transactions. In many compa-
nies the sales manager will actually cash out the register at night working with the
cashiers and give you the copy of the completed cash-out form.
After you get that information complete a cash-out form looks something like this:
Cash Register: _____

So in this example, with the cash remaining in the cash register, the cashier actually
took in $5 more than needed. This was most likely an error in giving change.

Use the information in this the Cash Register summary to complete the blank cash-out form below.
Also assume that the cash register had $100 at the beginning of the day and $316.10 at the end of the
day. Is there a difference between how much should be in the register and how much is there?

Discounting Sales
You may find one other twist to recording sales. Sometimes a store will offer dis-
counts during a sale. You want to keep track of your sales discounts separately, so
you know how much money your company lost to discounting over the year. While
sales discounts certainly generate traffic, it’s important to carefully track how fre-
quently you needed to offer these discounts to encourage traffic or stay competitive
with other similar retail stores. 
You may find you need to adjust your retail prices to better meet the actual going price
on the market, which means you may need to adjust your anticipated profit levels for
the year. If your project does come in below what you expect, you will then have the
detailed information you need to determine what impacted your sales revenue.
As you record a transaction in your books, you will add an account called Sales
Discounts to track any discounts you offer throughout the year.

Recording Sales Returns and Allowances
Some customers decide they don’t want the products they bought and return them to
the store. These sales returns must be tracked separately in your books. Another type
of transaction that must be tracked separately are sales allowances, which include
sales incentive programs such as gift cards.
Sales returns
Although it might be easier to decide on a no-return policy that would surely result in
very unhappy customers; instead, a business owner must decide what the rules will be
for sales returns and how they will be handled logistically. Here are common rules for
sales returns:
 Returns will only be allowed within 30 days of purchase.
 You must have a receipt to return an item.
 If you return an item without a sales receipt, you can receive only store credit.
The person who owns the business for which you are doing the bookkeeping can set
up whatever return policies he sees fit. After the policies are determined, the critical
issue is how the sales returns will be monitored internally to be sure the return
process is not used by cashiers to pocket extra cash. In most stores, a manager’s
approval is required for a sales return and the manager should carefully check to see
how the customer paid for the item. A customer who paid with cash can receive cash
back, but a customer who paid by credit card can only get a credit to that card. Only
after a manager approves a return can the cashier give that customer either the cash
or the credit to their card. If the store’s policy is only to give store credit on returns,
then a receipt for the store credit would be given to the customer.

If a customer returns an item he bought,
how can he get his money back if a store
adopts the common rules described
above?
a. If he paid cash, he can get cash back 
provided he shows a receipt for the 
purchase.
b. If he paid by credit card, he can get a
credit to his card provided he shows a
receipt for the purchase.
c. If he doesn’t show a receipt, he cannot
get his money back he can only get store
credit.
d. All of the above.

Sales allowances
Sales allowances are sales incentives programs to get the customer to come back to
the store again. The most popular type of sales allowance today is the gift card. With a
gift card the customer pays cash up front and gets a gift card that can be used by the
customer or any other person that gets the card. Gift cards are actually a liability for
the store because the store got the cash, but the customer is still owed an item in
exchange for that cash at some time in the future.
Tracking sales returns and allowances
Often sales returns and allowances are tracked using one account called Sales Returns
and Allowances that is subtracted from total Sales. When you see an Income Statement
you usually see the term “Net Sales.” That means that adjustments were made to total
sales, which includes this subtraction for sales returns and allowances.

by adding the taxes the customer paid and subtracting those taxes from Sales Taxes Collected.
This transaction would increase the balance in the Sales Returns and Allowances account, would
decrease the balance in the Sales Taxes Collected account, and would decrease the amount in the
Cash account.

Monitor Collections from Your Customers
Whenever your company sells to customers on credit, you will need to monitor how
quickly your customers are paying their bills. You also need to keep track of customers
who aren’t paying on time. As you do your bills at the end of the month, make a list of
all your customers and how much money they have outstanding in their accounts and
the date on which the original charge was made.
Here is a list for five customers who bought on credit from the office supply store and
have not yet paid their bills as of 3/31/2007:

You can quickly see who is behind in their bills and how much old debt you have on
your books. You should give a copy of this information to your manager, as well as
the sales or store manager so they can make decisions about whether or not they
want to continue offering credit to customers who aren’t paying their bills. Your
company will also need to establish a collections process.

Writing Off Bad Accounts
Sometimes your company will have to accept the fact that you’ll never collect the
money from some customers. When that happens you’ll need to write off the loss as a
bad debt. Each company sets its own policy on how long they will keep an account on
the books before it is written off as bad debt.

ost businesses do hire employees. Unless the business has only one employee 
(the owner), it most likely will pay some employees, offer benefits, and manage a
payroll. In this chapter you will explore employee staffing issues the bookkeeper may need
to manage. In addition you’ll practice key aspects of the payroll function that fall to the
bookkeeper.
Setting Up Payroll
In many small companies, the bookkeeper takes the responsibility for being certain that all
needed government forms are completed when a new person is hired. These forms include
 Employer Identification Number: Every company must have an Employer Identification
Number (EIN) to complete all the paperwork that must be filed with the state and fed-
eral government. To get this number, a company must submit an SS-4. If your company
doesn’t have an EIN, you can get a copy of the from at http://www.irs.gov/pub/
irs-pdf/fss4.pdf.
 W-4: Each employee must complete a W-4, “Employee’s Withholding Allowance
Certificate.” You’ve probably completed many of these during your working life. It’s the
form where you tell the employer how much to take out in taxes. As the bookkeeper
you need one of these for each employee so you know how to calculate the taxes to be
taken out of each paycheck. You can get a copy of this form at http://www.irs.gov/
pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf. 
 I-9: This form is required to prove eligibility to work in the U.S. You must be sure each
employee has completed this form before they can start to work for your company.
Civil penalties can be imposed on employers who fail to comply with this requirement.
You can get a copy of this form at http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/i-9.pdf.
 W-5: Some employees may be eligible for an Earned Income Credit (EIC), which is a tax
credit that refunds some of the money that an employee might otherwise need to pay
toward Social Security and Medicare. This reduces the tax bill for low-income workers.
Form W-5 is used to declare eligibility for the EIC. As the bookkeeper, after this form is
filed you would then reduce the taxes you take from the employee’s paycheck. You can
get a copy of this form at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw5.pdf.

Determining pay periods
Companies operate using four different pay periods. As the bookkeeper you will need
to keep track of how frequently each employee is paid. Often a company will pay
hourly employees (employees paid based on an hourly rate) on a weekly or biweekly
basis and salaried employees (employees paid based on a set monthly income rather
than based on the number of hours worked) on a semimonthly or monthly basis. Here
are the frequencies for payroll based on pay periods:
Weekly: Employees receive a paycheck each week and payroll must be done 52
times a year.
Biweekly: Employees receive a paycheck every two weeks and payroll must be
done 26 times a year.
Semimonthly: Employees receive a paycheck twice a month, commonly on the
15th day of the month and the last day of the month. Payroll must be done 24
times per year.
Monthly: Employees receive one paycheck per month and payroll must be done
12 times a year.
In addition to knowing a person’s pay period, you also must know whether the person
is an exempt or nonexempt employee. Exempt employees are exempt from the Fair
Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which sets the rules for minimum wages, equal pay,
overtime pay, and child labor laws. Exempt employees often work more than 40 hours
a week, but get no overtime pay. Nonexempt employees must be paid time and one-
half for any hours worked over 40 hours in a seven-day period. As the bookkeeper,
you’ll need to review employee work hours for all nonexempt employees and calcu-
late overtime due.

Collecting Employee Payroll Taxes
Another key responsibility of the bookkeeper when preparing payroll is to collect all
the federal and state taxes due from the employees. Yes, employers do play tax collec-
tor when they dole out the paychecks and must reduce those checks by the amount of
taxes due. In fact, you will collect taxes for Social Security, Medicare, Federal withhold-
ing, and, if applicable, state or local withholding.
Each employee must pay Social Security taxes of 6.2 percent on earned income up to
the cap of $97,500 in 2007. This amount is adjusted for inflation each year by the Social
Security Administration. An employee who earns more than $97,500 does not pay
Social Security on earnings over $97,500. The Social Security cap is adjusted each year.
As the bookkeeper you will need to keep track of the annual cap so you know when
you can stop taking out Social Security taxes for higher income employees.
The calculation of Social Security taxes is simple. You multiply the gross amount (the
full amount of pay before any deductions) of the check times 6.2 percent. Here is the
calculation for an employee that earned $1,000 in a pay period:
$1,000 × 0.062 = $62.00
Medicare taxes also must be taken out. Each employee pays 1.45 percent of his earned
income toward Medicare. There is no cap on Medicare taxes. The calculation is similar
to that for Social Security. You multiply the gross amount of the check times 1.45 per-
cent. Here is the calculation for Medicare taxes on a gross check of $1,000:
$1,000 × 0.0145 = $14.50
Your work in calculating federal withholding taxes (income taxes), as well as state or
local taxes is much more complex. You not only have to know what the tax rate is for
an employee, but you also must know how many withholding allowances the employee
claims. You’ll find the number of withholding allowances claimed on the W-4 the
employee filed at the time he was hired. 
You can image how difficult it would be if you had to calculate taxes for each
employee taking all these factors into consideration. Luckily the government does
make it easier for you and prepares tax tables based on wages and the number of
allowances claimed. You can find all the federal rules for employers, as well as the tax
tables, in Publication 15, “IRS Employer’s Tax Guide” (www.irs.gov/publications/
p15/index.html). At the back of the guide in the section called additional materials
are tables you can use to find an employee’s tax obligation. Table 9-1 is a sample of a
portion of that table for an employee that earns $1,000 per week.

The federal withholding tax that must be deducted can be found by looking in the
column that matches the withholding allowances claimed. For example if Sue earned
$1,000 per week and claimed 3 withholding allowances, then the amount of tax you

In addition to federal withholding taxes, you may have to calculate state and local
taxes, if appropriate. You can find contact information for each state’s taxing authority

Figuring Out Net Pay
Taxes are not the only things you will be deducting from a person’s paycheck. Many
companies provide health insurance benefits, but expect the employee to pay part of
the cost. Each employee will designate the type of insurance they want, and you’ll
need to keep track of how much to take out of his check each pay period. If your com-
pany offers other benefits such as retirement plans, life insurance, dependent care
assistance, and education assistance, you’ll need to deduct any employee costs of
those benefits from the check as well.
Many of these benefits are exempt from taxes, so that will reduce the amount of the
gross pay that must be used when calculating employee withholding taxes. For exam-
ple, suppose Fred earns $1,300 per week and puts $200 per week in his tax-exempt
retirement savings, $55 goes toward tax-exempt health insurance coverage, $15 goes
toward tax-exempt life insurance coverage and $10 goes toward tax-exempt long-term
care coverage. So his taxable amount will then be only $1,020. As the bookkeeper you
would use the $1,020 to figure out his withholding taxes. 
Calculating Payroll
Calculating paychecks will vary depending upon pay period, whether an employee 
is hourly or salaried, and whether the employee is exempt or no exempt. You also
may have some employees that are paid by commission or by partial salary and 
commission. These variations in pay can make preparing payroll a nightmare for
the bookkeeper. 

Calculating pay for salaried employees
Calculating pay for salaried employees can be much easier than hourly employees,
since most are not eligible for overtime pay. If you do have salaried employees that are
eligible for overtime pay, then you would need to calculate an hourly pay rate for these
employees and use that pay rate to calculate the overtime pay.

10. Suppose John, who gets paid biweekly,

earns $13 per hour. She worked 42 hours in
the first week and 46 hours in the second

Solve It
Calculating pay for hourly employees
When you are calculating paychecks for hourly employees, you need to know whether
they are exempt or nonexempt. Most hourly employees are nonexempt and are enti-
tled to overtime pay. You also need to know their hourly rate and the number of hours
they worked each week in the pay period.
Q.
Suppose Jack, who is paid weekly, earns $12 per hour and worked 48 hours last week. How would
you calculate his gross paycheck?
A.
You would separate the amount of timed work at regular pay, 40 hours, from the time worked at
overtime pay 8 hours. Then you would calculate the gross paycheck this way:
40 hours regular pay × $12 per hour = $480
8 hours overtime pay × $ 12 per hour × 1.5 overtime rate = $144
Gross pay check $480 + $144 = $624

Calculating paychecks for 
commissioned employees
Some employees’ pay will be based on their sales performance and they will receive a
commission based on that performance. The employee could be paid on full commis-
sion, which would mean all his pay is based on the volume of sales, or he could have a
base salary plus commission. 
If the employee has a base salary plus commission, then he would get a set amount
per month plus a commission based on his sales volume. Full commission employees
usually get a greater percentage of their sales volume in commission than employees
who earn a base salary plus commission. 
To calculate a paycheck for a commissioned employee you need to know his commis-
sion percentage, the volume of his sales, and whether or not he has a base salary.
Q.
Suppose Jack is a full commission sales
person and he earns 10% commission on
his sales volume, what would be the
amount of his gross paycheck if he is paid
on a monthly basis and his monthly sales
volume was $60,000?
A.
Jack’s pay would be calculated by multiply-
ing the sales volume times his commission
percentage:
$60,000 × 10% = $6,000

3 percent on his sales volume. He is paid

Solve It
Calculating paychecks for 
employees who earn tips
One other complication to calculating payroll involves employees who earn tips. In
most places where tips are earned, such as a restaurant, the employee earns less than
the minimum wage per hour and the employer must prove that the employee earns at
least the minimum wage. The federal minimum wage is $5.15 per hour, but many states
have increased that minimum wage requirement, so you will need to check the laws in
your state.
Restaurants commonly pay employees between $2.50 and $5 per hour plus tips. They
then must prove their employees earn at least enough in tips to match the minimum
wage requirements in the state in which they operate. For restaurants this can be rela-
tively easy today because many customers pay their bills with credit cards and the
restaurant can use those credit card bills to show the tips earned. When you calculate
the employee’s taxes, those taxes must be calculated on both the base salary and tips
earned. 
When you prepare paychecks for employees who earn tips you will only be paying
them their hourly wage, since the tips are collected each night, but you will have to
deduct taxes based on the combined hourly rate of taxes and tips.

Depositing Taxes
Employers must pay the taxes they collect on behalf of their employees to a financial
institution authorized to collect those payments for the government or to the Federal
Reserve Bank in their area. Most major banks are authorized to collect these deposits.
Employers must file IRS Form 941 quarterly to show the number of employees and
how much money they were paid, as well as report the taxes collected. Employers use
a coupon to deposit the taxes due.
Employers use the coupon to make monthly deposits in the financial institution. The
deposit must be made within 15 days after the end of the month in which the employee
was paid. For example, employee taxes collected during the month of March must be
Q.
If Ann earns $3.00 per hour plus $5 per
hour in tips, what would her gross pay-
check be and what would be the total pay
used to calculate her taxes?
A.
Her paycheck would be calculated based
on her hourly pay.
$3 × 40 hours work = $120
Her taxes would be calculated based on
her pay plus tips or $8 per hour.
$8 × 40 hours = $320

paid by April 15. Large employers who collect a total of $100,000 or more in a day must
deposit funds on the next banking day. Tax payments can also be made electronically to
the Federal Tax Payment System. 
As you can see payroll can be a mind-boggling task. Many small companies avoid the
headache of managing payroll and benefits by outsourcing payroll to a company that
specializes in handling it. If you are responsible for payroll, you may want to research
the cost of contracting these services and make a case to outsource the work.

 Keeping employee records
O
nce a company hires employees it will need to complete regular reports for the gov-
ernment regarding taxes it must pay for the employee (Social Security, Medicare, and
federal and state withholding taxes), workman’s compensation, and unemployment taxes. In
this chapter you will review the employer reporting requirements for companies related to
federal, state and local government entities, as well as the records the bookkeeper must
keep in order to do these reports. 
Paying Social Security and Medicare Taxes
Employers must pay half of the Social Security and Medicare taxes for every employee. So in
addition to taking out 6.2 percent for Social Security taxes and 1.45 for Medicare taxes from
each employee’s paycheck, the employer must pay the same percentages. A total of 12.4 per-
cent goes toward an employee’s Social Security record and 2.9 percent goes toward an
employee’s Medicare record. Calculating those taxes is done in the same way as shown in
Chapter 9 for calculating the employee’s half.
In Chapter 9 I explain how employers need to use Form 941, “Employer’s Federal Tax Return,”
which must be filed quarterly. Table 10-1 shows you the filing due dates for that form.

Here is the information you must be sure you include on Form 941:
Number of employees who received wages
Total of wages, tips, and other compensation paid to employees
Total of tax withheld from wages, tips, and other compensation
Taxable Social Security and Medicare wages
Total paid out in sick pay
Adjustments for tips and group-term life insurance
Amount of income tax withholding
Advance earned income credit payments made to employees 
Amount of tax liability per month
The actual taxes reported on this form will be paid monthly by most employers. In
Figure 9-2 I show you the coupon used to pay these taxes to an approved financial
institution or to the Federal Reserve Bank in your area. If you collect more than
$100,000 on any one day then you’ll have to deposit those taxes on the next business
day. Employers that collect $200,000 in taxes must deposit the money due electroni-
cally through the EFTPS (Electronic Federal Tax Payment System). Employers who fail
to pay on time or underpay the amount due can be charged interest and penalties, so
you want to be sure you pay on time and pay the amount due.
Q.
What form must every employer file with
the government to report taxes paid or 
collected on behalf of employees?
a. Form 941, monthly
b. Form 941, quarterly
c. Form 149, monthly

must be deposited monthly and large
employers must deposit those taxes even
more frequently.

Filing Unemployment Reports 
and Paying Taxes
Another major tax you must start to pay once your company employs people is unem-
ployment taxes. These taxes are paid into the Federal Unemployment Tax Fund (FUTA)
and used to pay unemployment benefits to people who are fired or laid off. Employers
contribute to this fund as well as to an unemployment fund in their states. 
The FUTA rate for employers is 6.2 percent on the first $7,000 that each employee
earns. Luckily you don’t have to add the state rate on top of that because the federal
government allows you to subtract up to 5.4 percent of the first $7,000 per employee
that you pay to the state or a maximum credit of $378 per employee (7,000 x 5.4 per-
cent). The state taxes serve as a credit to the federal taxes due. Each state sets its own
unemployment rates. Many states also charge additional fees for administrative costs
and job-training programs. You can find the rules for your state at payroll-taxes.com,
but to give you an idea of how taxes vary state to state, review Table 10-2.

You can see in Table 10-2 there is a range in the percentage of unemployment taxes the
employer must pay per employee. This range is based on the company’s employment
history and how often the company lays off or fires employees who must then draw
unemployment benefits. States calculate your company’s FUTA tax rate in four differ-
ent ways:

 Benefit ratio formula: Looks at the ratio of benefits collected by former employ-
ees to your company’s total payrolls over the past three years. Your company’s
rate depends upon its balance in the state unemployment insurance fund.
 Benefit wage formula: Looks at the proportion of your company’s payroll that’s
paid to workers who become unemployed and collect benefits and then divides
that number by your company’s total taxable wages.
 Payroll decline ratio formula: Looks at the decline in your company’s payrolls
from year to year or from quarter to quarter.
 Reserve ratio formula: Looks at your company’s balance in the unemployment
reserve account, which gives a cumulative representation of its use by your
employees that were laid off and paid unemployment.
Each state sets a rate in the middle of the range for new employers, which gets
adjusted once they have a hiring history in the state based on the formula that state
uses. You can find out which formula your state uses on payroll-taxes.com. To clarify
what your company might expect and how to minimize unemployment taxes, sit down
with a representative from your state unemployment office and review your state’s
policies.
Q.
Using Table 10-2, calculate the FUTA taxes
for a new employer in the state of Florida.
He has ten employees. Each earns more
than $20,000. 
A.
The state unemployment rate for new
employers is 2.7% up to an income of
$7,000, so to calculate the state taxes you
would multiply $7,000 × .027 × 10 = $1,890.
The federal unemployment rate is 6.2% up
to $7,000 in income, so the Federal unem-
ployment taxes would be calculated by
multiplying $7,000 × .062 × 10 = $4,340.
The company can subtract what it pays the
state from the amount due the federal gov-
ernment, so it would pay the state $1,890
and pay the federal government $2,450
($4,340–$1,890).

Employers must file an annual report called “Employer’s Annual Federal Unemployment
Tax Return” on Form 940 or 940 EZ. The taxes are usually paid quarterly though. In
addition to the federal form you will find that your state has a quarterly or annual
unemployment form to file. Some states combine the form filed for unemployment 
and state income taxes. Eight states have no income taxes — Alaska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.
Covering Workman’s Compensation
Taxes aren’t the only thing you have to worry about once you hire employees. You also
must figure out what level of workman’s compensation insurance you must carry in
your state. Every state except Texas requires you to carry the insurance.
Workman’s compensation insurance covers employee’s who are injured on the job. This
coverage pays for the cost of lost income, medical expenses, vocational rehabilitation
and, if applicable, death benefits. In Texas, since it does not require the insurance, it
allows employees to sue their employers in civil court to recoup the costs of injuries.
Each state sets its own rules specifying how much medical coverage you must pro-
vide and how much you must continue to pay an injured worker in salaries or bene-
fits. The state also decides who gets to pick the physicians who can care for injured
employees — the employer, the employee, the state agency, or some combination of
the three. In most states the insurance is purchased through private insurance com-
panies. For more details about workman’s compensation and insurance options go to
www.ncci.com, which is the National Council on Compensation Insurance.

Employer’s rates vary by the types of business and types of employees working for
that business. Your company’s rates are calculated based on risks identified in two
areas:
 Classification of the business: These classifications are based on the historic
rates of risk in different industries. For example, if you operate a business in an
industry that has a high rate of employee injury, such as a construction business,
your base rate for workman’s compensation is higher than that of a company in
an industry without a history of frequent employee injury, such as an office that
sells insurance.
 Classification of the employee: The National Council on Compensation Insurance
(NCCI) publishes classifications of over 700 jobs in a book called the Scopes
Manual. Most states use this manual to develop the basis for their classifications.
For example desk jobs are cheaper to insure than jobs involving the operation of
heavy machinery because there are more injuries when operating heavy machin-
ery than working at a desk. 
Many small businesses pay more than needed for workman’s compensation insurance
because they misclassify their employees. Be sure you understand the classification
system and properly classify your employee positions before applying for workman’s
compensation insurance. You can read more about classification at www.ncci.com.

Maintaining Employee Records
With all these governmental filings, I’m sure you’ve realized by now that you must
keep very careful personnel records for each of your employees. The detailed informa-
tion you must have on file for each employee includes
Name, address, phone number, and Social Security number
Department or division within the company
Start date with the company
Pay rate
Pay period 
Whether hourly or salaried
Whether exempt or nonexempt
W-4 withholding allowances
Benefits information
Payroll deductions
All payroll activity
You also have to track if the employee wants to change his withholding allowances or
asks for benefit changes. It’s a good idea to set up an employee journal and keep a
page for each employee. The page set up might look like this:
Name:
SS#:
Address:
Tax Info: (such as, married, 2 withholding allowances)
Pay Info: (such as $10 per hour, nonexempt, biweekly)
Benefits: (such as health insurance, withholding $100 month)
You would then keep a regular summary of the employee’s pay history on the page.
The page would need at least seven columns, including date of check, taxable wages,
Social Security tax, Medicare tax, benefits withholding, federal withholding, state with-
holding and net check amount. You could add additional columns if you need to track
non-taxable wages, benefits, sick time, or vacation time. Table 10-3 shows you what
this section of the employee journal page would look like.

If your company does do its payroll using a computer accounting software program,
you can maintain these records on computer, but be certain that you back up that
system and prepare paper reports of the data periodically for your files.

$24,600 (for employee earning $30,000) × 2.95% × 1 = $725.50
Since the maximum FUTA credit is $378 per employee and the employer pays more than that 
per employee, you can subtract $378 × 10 employees or $3,780 from the amount due the federal
government on FUTA (6.2% × $7,000 × 10) – $3,780 = $560.

s a business uses its assets, the assets eventually get used up. Businesses track the
use of their assets by calculating depreciation expnses. 
This chapter will introduce you to depreciation and the various methods that are used to 
calculate it. You’ll practice the various depreciation methods and learn how to track them
within your bookkeeping system.
Understanding Depreciation
You probably think of depreciation as something that happens to a new car when you drive it
off the lot after purchasing it. All of a sudden it’s worth 20 to 30 percent less and it’s called
depreciation. Well, for bookkeeping purposes it’s not quite the same thing. Accountants use
depreciation to adjust the books based on the aging of a piece of equipment or other asset. 
As an asset is used, its useful life is reduced. For example, when you drive a car 15,000 to
20,000 miles a year, you know that eventually it will need more and more repair until finally
you decide it’s used up and you want to replace it with something new. That happens to man-
ufacturing equipment, furniture, as well as any other business asset held for more than a
year. A company needs to track this use of assets to know the value of what it has and also to
estimate repair and replacement costs based on the age of its assets. 
Not everything can be depreciated. Any item that you expect to use up in a year is not eligi-
ble for depreciation. These types of items are written off as expenses instead. You also don’t
depreciate land. Land does not get used up. While you can’t depreciate a building or car you
rent or lease, if you do major renovations to a leased property you can depreciate the value
of those improvements.
Assets you own that are used for both your business and your personal life can be partially
depreciated based on percentage of use. The two most common types of partially depreci-
ated assets for people who own a home business are their car and a portion of their house.
For these situations the business owners are primarily looking to take advantage of the tax
savings that can be generated by depreciation. 
This chapter focuses on depreciation expenses. Depreciation for tax purposes is an entirely
different topic. Check with your accountant to find out more information about depreciation
methods used for tax purposes or read IRS publication 946, “How to Depreciate Property”
(www.irs.gov/publications/p946/index.html).

Figuring out the useful life
The first thing you must determine when you need to calculate the depreciation for an
asset is how long that asset will be useful to the company. While you can set up your
own table for periods of useful life for types of assets in your business, you will have to
justify the lifespan you’ve chosen if it differs from IRS rules. So most businesses use
the depreciation recovery periods set up by the IRS, which set an average useful life
for business assets as shown in Table 11-1. Some types of business will use a different
depreciation schedule. For example, a rental car business may shorten the useful life
of a car from five years (as estimated by the IRS in Table 11-1) to two years because its
cars are used much more frequently and get used up much quicker than they would in
another type of business.

Q.
Businesses depreciate assets to:
a. Take advantage of tax savings
b. Track the use of their assets
c. Project repair and replacement needs
d. All of the above
A.
The answer is d. All of the above are cor-
rect. Depreciation is a tax deduction. It
does calculate the using up of an asset and
by knowing the age of its assets, a business
can determine expected repair and replace-
ment costs. For example, older assets likely
will need more repair and their replace-
ment will be needed much sooner than
newer assets.

Determining the cost basis
The other key factor in calculating depreciation is the cost basis of an asset. The equa-
tion for cost basis is
Cost of the fixed asset + Sales tax + Shipping and delivery costs + Installation
charges + Other costs (such as commissions or finder’s fees) = Cost basis
Cost of the fixed asset is what you paid for that equipment, furniture, building,
vehicle, or any other asset you intend to use for more than 12 months
Sales tax is the actual taxes you were charged when purchasing that asset

Depreciating Your Assets
Once you know your assets anticipated life span and its cost basis, you can then cal-
culate how much you should write off for depreciation. Depreciation is not a cash
expense. The cash expense happens when you buy the asset or a cash inflow can
happen when you sell the asset. Depreciation just shows the use of that asset, so it
does not involve the use of cash. I show you how to record depreciation in the books
below in the section, “Recording Depreciation Expenses.”
You actually can choose from four different methods to calculate depreciation —
Straight-Line, Sum-of-Years-Digits, Double Declining Balance, and Units of Production. 
I show you how to calculate each below and then give you a chance to practice.
Straight-line 
Straight-line depreciation spreads out the cost of the asset over the entire useful life of
an asset. It’s the simplest type of depreciation to calculate. The formula is
(Cost of the asset – Salvage) / Estimated useful life = Annual depreciation expense
The salvage value is the value you expect the asset will have when you sell it after you
have finished using it for your business. For example, if you buy a car for $25,000 and
expect to be able to sell it for $5,000, the salvage value of that car would be $5,000.
Q.
Calculate the annual depreciation expense
for a car with a cost basis of $25,000 and a
$5,000 salvage value using the IRS recovery
period.
A.
Looking at the IRS chart you see that a car
has a 5-year lifespan according to the IRS.
So you would calculate straight-line depre-
ciation in this way:
($35,000 – $5,000) = $30,000
$30,000/5 = $6,000 annual depreciation
expense

Sum-of-years-digits
Sometimes a business determines that an asset is used up more quickly in the early
years, so it decides to use the sum-of-years-digits (SYD) method. This is common for 
a trucking company when it buys a new truck. The SYD calculation is a three step
process:
1. Find the SYD for the current fiscal year using this formula:
N(N + 1) / 2 = SYD (N would be the number of years of useful life). The SYD
would be the same each year of calculation.
2. Find the application fraction using this formula:
N/SYD (N would be the number of years remaining of useful life).
3. Calculate the depreciation expense formula:
(Cost – Salvage value) × Applicable fraction = Depreciation expense.
Q.
Calculate the first year of the depreciation
expense for a car that had a cost basis 
of $35,000 and a salvage value of $5,000
using the sum-of-years-digits depreciation
method. Assume the IRS recovery period 
of 5 years.
A.
The answer is:
SYD = 5 (5 + 1) / 2 = 30/2 = 15
Applicable fraction = 5⁄15 = 1⁄3
Depreciation expense = ($35,000 – 5,000) ×
1⁄3 = $30,000 × 1⁄3 = $10,000

Chapter 11: Depreciating Your Assets
11. Calculate the depreciation expense using
the double-declining balance method for
years 2 to 5 for the $35,000 car using the
information from the example above.
Remember to use book value at the begin-
ning of each year. Since the depreciation
was $14,000 in the first year, the book
value at the beginning of the second year
would be $21,000 and salvage after 5 years
is $5,000.
Solve It
Double-declining balance
Sometimes businesses want to write off an asset even more quickly than they can 
use the SYD depreciation calculation because they believe the assets lose usefulness
faster. In this case they use a method called double-declining balance, which is double
the amount of depreciation allowed using straight-line depreciation. You must calcu-
late a depreciation factor the first year you use double-declining depreciation by using
this formula:
2 × (1 / Estimated useful life) = Depreciation factor. You then multiply that factor
by the book value at the beginning of each year. The depreciation factor will be
the same for each year of the calculation.
Salvage value should not be subtracted from the book value, but once the book value
is equal to the salvage value, you can’t depreciate any more.
Q.
Calculate the first year of a car’s deprecia-
tion expense using the double-declining
balance method. The cost basis of the car
is $35,000 with a salvage value of $5,000.
Assume the IRS recovery period of 5 years.
A.
The calculation would be
2 × (1⁄5) = .40 
Multiply $35,000 × .40 = $14,000

Units of production (UOP)
The units of production (UOP) method of deprecation is used primarily in a manufac-
turing environment and you would not likely need to calculate depreciation expenses
manually in that type of environment. Most likely there would be a computer program
for calculating depreciation, so I won’t set up a problem to practice this calculation. 
In this case the number of units to be produced by the machinery is the key factor that
a company wants to track rather than the useful life in years. Rather than calculating a
depreciation factor you calculate a UOP rate and then the depreciation expense using
this two step process:
Find the UOP rate:
(Cost – Salvage value) / Estimated number of units to be produced during
the estimated useful life = UOP rate
Find the depreciation expense using this formula:
Units produced during the year × UOP rate = Depreciation expense
Companies who choose to use this method usually have a wide variation in production
levels each year.
Setting Schedules
Remembering how much to depreciate for each asset you have in your business can
be an overwhelming task. The best way to keep track of what you need to expense
each year is to set up a depreciation schedule for each type of asset that lists the date
it was put into service, the description of the asset, the cost basis, the recovery
period, and the annual depreciation. Table 11-2 is a sample of this type of schedule.

Recording Depreciation Expenses
Recording depreciation expenses can be a simple entry into your accounting system.
Most businesses do the entry at the end of a quarter or the end of the year when they
close the books. After calculating depreciation expense, here is the type of entry you
would use for a depreciation expense of $4,000 for a vehicle:
Debit

Accumulated Depreciation
$4,000
Depreciation expense is a line item on the Income Statement (Chapter 16) and

D: Land value is not included when determining the useful life of an asset for depreciation 
f
The cost basis for the car would be $25,000 + $1,500 + $125 = $26,625
You cannot include the cost of a tank of gas in the cost basis for the car. Gas would be an oper-
ating expense and written off as an expense in the year incurred.
g
The cost basis for the building would be $300,000 + $20,000 + $35,000 = $355,000
You don’t include the value of land when calculating the cost basis. 
h
The cost basis for office renovations would be $20,000 + $5,000 + $15,000 = $40,000.
New office furniture should be set up in a separate depreciation schedule with a cost basis of
$30,000. 
i
First subtract the salvage value: $5,000 – $500 = $4,500
Then: $4,500/5 years = $900 annual depreciation
j
You would use SYD = 15
Year 2: Applicable fraction = 4⁄15
$30,000 × 4⁄15 = $8,000 depreciation expense
Year 3: Applicable fraction = 3⁄15
$30,000 × 3⁄15 = $6,000 depreciation expense
Year 4: Applicable fraction = 2⁄15
$30,000 × 2⁄15 = $4,000 depreciation expense
Year 5: Applicable fraction = 1⁄15
$30,000 × 1⁄15 = $2,000 depreciation expense
k
Your depreciation factor would be .40.
Year 2: $21,000 × .40 = $8,400 depreciation expense
Year 3: $21,000 – $8,400 = $12,600 — book value at the beginning of the year
$12,600 × .40 = $5,040 depreciation expense

160
Part IV: Getting Ready for Year’s (Or Month’s) End 
Year 4: $12,600 – $5,040 = $7,560
$7,560 × .40 = $3,024, but since the salvage value is $5,000, depreciation expense can only be
$2,560. The car would be fully depreciated in Year 4.

ost businesses carry some debt and most pay interest on that debt. Some businesses
loan money or other assets and receive interest payments. 
This chapter will review the debt types and how to calculate and record interest expenses
for each type. You also will be able to practice how to calculate interest calculations and how
to track and enter interest payments into the bookkeeping system.
Determining Interest Types
Financial institutions use two different types of interest calculations when determining how
much to pay you in interest for money on deposit or calculating how much you will pay them
on a loan or credit card — simple interest and compound interest.
Simple interest
Simple interest is easy to calculate. Here’s the formula for calculating simple interest:
Principal × Interest rate × n = Interest
Q.
Calculate the simple interest earned over
three years for a $10,000 savings account
earning 3 percent interest per year.

at 3%?

2.
What is the simple interest earned over
seven years on a $5,000 savings account 
at 5%?

Compound interest
Compound interest is more complicated to calculate because interest is not only
charged on the amount you have on deposit, it is also calculated on the interest
earned during the time you have it on deposit. So when you calculate compound inter-
est you must add the interest earned the previous period to the balance before calcu-
lating the interest earned during the new period. Here’s the formula for calculating
compound interest for a three-year deposit:
Principal × Interest rate = Interest for year one
(Principal + Interest earned) × Interest rate = Interest for year two
(Principal + Interest earned) × Interest rate = Interest for year three
You would repeat this method of calculation for the life of the deposit.
Q.
Calculate the compound interest on a
$10,000 deposit at 3% for three years.
A.
Year one: $10,000 × .03 = $300
Year two: $10,300 × .03 = $309
Year three: $10,609 × .03 = $318.27
Total interest earned in three years =
$927.27

Solve It
When you are taking a loan, you always want to be sure you will be paying simple
interest. When you are opening a savings account or any other type of savings instru-
ment with a financial institution you always want to be sure you will earn compound
interest. Even compound interest can be paid differently. Some banks will compound
your earnings monthly, which means interest earned will be added to your balance
before the next monthly interest calculation. For other types of accounts interest is
only compounded annually. So always look for a bank that compounds your savings
monthly.
Determining Interest on Debt
Businesses borrow money for both short-term (less than 12 months) and long-term
business needs. Short-term debt usually includes credit cards and lines of credit. Long-
term debt can include a multi-year loan for a vehicle or 15 or more year loan for a
mortgage. Any money paid toward interest in the current year is shown as an interest
expense on the Income Statement (see Chapter 16). In this chapter I review how to cal-
culate that interest expense.
Credit cards
As you know from your personal credit cards, if you pay the bill in full at the end of
each month, you don’t have any interest charges. But, if you don’t pay the balance in
full each month, interest is charged based on a daily periodic interest rate, which
means you start paying interest from the day you make a purchase. The daily periodic

After completing problems 1, 2, and 3 you can see that interest compounded daily can
be a lot more expensive than a simple annual interest rate. Credit cards are definitely
the most expensive way to carry a loan. You won’t be calculating interest. Instead
you’ll be using the amount of interest charged shown on the monthly credit card bill 
as your interest expense.
Most businesses seek better rates for short-term borrowing by using lines of credit.
When using this type of credit line, you draw cash when needed and pay interest on
the amount of the loan balance, but it is not compounded daily like a credit card.

Separating and Paying Interest on Debt
When a company takes on long-term debt, which means debt to be paid over more
than 12 months, then the debt must be separated into current and long-term debt. 
The current debt will be the amount of cash that must be paid during the current year,
which will include both interest and principal payments. Any amount remaining would
be long-term debt. 
You would need to ask your bank for an amortization chart in order to determine how
much of each payment on the long-term debt goes toward interest and how much goes
toward principal. You can also use an online calculator to get those numbers. A good
online calculator can be found at http://www.bankrate.com/brm/amortization-
calculator.asp.
Q.
Using an amortization calculator, calculate the first three months of payments for a $20,000 five-
year car loan at 7% and record the first payment.
A.
Payment 1
$279.36 principal
$116.67 interest
$19,720.64 remaining balance

Notice how the amount paid toward principal gradually increases, while the interest gradually
decreases for a long-term debt.

Booking Interest Income
Many businesses earn interest from money in savings accounts, money market
accounts or certificates of deposit or other investment vehicles. You need to record
any interest earned for the business in an Interest Income account, which will appear
on the Income Statement.
Luckily you shouldn’t have to calculate that interest. Your bank statement will indicate
the amount of interest earned.

M
ost businesses count the cash on hand each day, as well as at the end of an account-
ing period. In addition, each of the journals must be reviewed and closed at the end
of the accounting period.
In this chapter, I explain how businesses test to be sure the cash counts are accurate. I also
discuss how to handle any errors that are found, as well as start the closing process and post
results to the General Ledger.
Checking Cash
At the end of each month, as businesses close their books for the month, they start by
checking their cash balance. In any business cash can be found in several different places —
the cash registers, incoming mail (for example, checks from customers paying bills), petty
cash accounts, and the business’ bank accounts. Transactions involving cash can be found in
the Cash Receipts Journal (cash coming into the business) and the Cash Disbursements
Journal (cash going out of the business). I talk more about closing those journals in the next
section called “Closing Journals”.
First you need to review the cash on hand. In Chapter 8, I talk about how to prove out the
cash registers. A report of the cash remaining in each register should be sent with any
records of deposits from the store managers to bookkeeping. Tallying all those records will
give you a total of cash on hand in the retail outlets. The closing process for any business
can take a week or more. You can’t even start the process until you have the reports from all
the cash registers the day after the last day of the month.
In addition you need to track any other place cash is kept in the business, such as petty cash
accounts. Many businesses will have several people, such as office managers, assigned to
manage small petty cash accounts for paying things like postal charges or small supply
needs. You also want to tally the total of cash on hand at the bank. In the section later in this
chapter called “Reconciling Bank Accounts,” I discuss how to prove out those totals. Finally,
you need to check the mail for any payments received on the last day of the month to be
sure those checks are depositd and recorded before you close the books for the month.
Once you know your cash balance you have one key piece of the puzzle that you will need to
prove out the books at the end of an accounting month.

that was used during the accounting period. Any cash that came into the business
should be tracked in the Cash Receipts Journal and any cash that was paid out of the
business should be tracked in the Cash Disbursements Journal. I talk more about the
importance of these journals and how to manage them in Chapter 5.
After recording the cash from the last day’s receipts into the Cash Receipts Journal,
you’ll need to be sure all other charges have been recorded in the journal. For exam-
ple, if you allow your customers to use credit cards, you need to record any customer
disputes charged back by the credit card companies. 
Understanding credit card fees
Every company must pay fees to the banks that process their credit card charges.
These fees lower the amount you actually take into the business, so you must adjust
your credit card receipts and record the fees. Possible fees include
 Address verification service: This service is used to verify credit card identities
so you can avoid accepting fraudulent credit cards. This is particularly impor-
tant if your business accepts payment from customers by telephone or by the
Internet when you don’t actually see the credit card being used. Banks charge a
fee for every transaction verified.
 Discount rate: All businesses that accept credit cards must pay for the services
of the bank that handles the transactions. These costs are reflected in the dis-
count rate, which is a percentage of each transaction. The amount of this fee
varies depending on the contract rates agreed to between your business and the
bank that processes your credit cards. Fees usually are set based on volume of
sales.
 Secure gateway fee: If you are selling products over the Internet, this fee secures
transactions. Businesses that use this service pay for it on a monthly basis.
Q.
True or false: When determining how much
cash the business has on hand you need to
look in several places including cash regis-
ter receipts, bank accounts, and petty cash
boxes.
A.
True. Cash registers, bank accounts, and
petty cash boxes are all places where you
may find cash assets of the business. Your
business may also have other locations for
cash. You need to know the total cash on
hand wherever it may be as you start the
process of closing the books for an
accounting period.

 Customer support fee: This fee is charged to companies that want customer sup-
port 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Mail order catalogs or Internet websites that
want this round-the-clock support for orders pay this fee. Sometimes companies
may make arrangements for overnight support only if they accept orders interna-
tionally, so they don’t need to staff their customer service centers 24 hours a day.
 Monthly minimum fee: All banks set a minimum per month no matter how many
transactions are handled. This fee is paid even if no credit cards were used
during the month. The fee is often $10 to $30 per month. Your business won’t
have to worry about these fees as long as enough credit card transactions are
processed. For example, if you pay a 2 percent discount fee on all credit card
transactions and process $500 in transactions during the month, you would pay
$10. If your monthly minimum fee is $10 then you are covered and won’t have to
pay the minimum. But if your monthly minimum is $30 and you only generate
enough transactions for $10 in fees, then you would need to pay an additional
$20 for the credit card services. If your business is just starting to think about
accepting credit cards, you must be certain you will generate enough business to
cover the monthly minimum fee.
 Transaction fee: Each time you submit a credit card transaction for approval
there is a transaction fee, even if the credit card is denied.
 Equipment and software fees: This fee is charged based on the type of equipment
and software your company uses to process credit transactions. Most stores have
a small machine through which a credit card is swiped. Some companies have soft-
ware added to their computerized cash registers. Whichever your company uses,
there is likely to be a fee for buying or leasing the equipment or software.
 Chargeback and retrieval fees: If a customer disputes a transaction, then you
may see a chargeback to your account when you get your bill. You will need to
reverse the money entered for that sale in your books.

Reconciling your credit card statements
As a bookkeeper you would go nuts trying to figure out the fees individually for each
credit card transaction. Instead, the bookkeeper would adjust the cash taken in from
sales using adjusting journal entries. The entries would debit (which would reduce)
the Sales account and credit (which would reduce) the cash account.
In most cases the actual credit sales transactions are deposited in the company’s bank
account on the day the sales took place. Fees charged, as well as any chargebacks, are
calculated monthly and sent to the company in a bank statement. As the bookkeeper,
when you get the credit card statement from the bank, you would then total the fees
and enter those fees in the books. You would also enter any chargebacks.
Q.
When you get the credit card statement at
the end of May, you see that there are a
total of $125 in fees for the month and find
that one customer disputed a charge of
$35. How would you make that adjustment
in the Cash journals?
A.
You would make two adjusting entries —
one to reverse the sale recorded in the
Cash Receipts Journal and one to record
the fees in the Cash Disbursements
Journal. The credits reduce the amount of
cash in the books. The cash has already
been subtracted from your bank account.
So you must reconcile what’s in your books
with what is in your bank account.

Receipts Journal to reverse the sale:

Solve It
Accruing your bills
At the end of the month you’re likely to get bills that you have not yet paid. If the bills
represent expenses incurred during the month, you want to record those expenses so
you can match cash receipts with the expenses incurred. For example, if you took an
advertisement in the newspaper for a sale on May 15 and receive the bill for that
advertisement on May 30th with a due date of June 10, you want to record that bill as a
May expense. This is called accruing bills.
As you close the books for the month, you want to be sure that you have accrued all
bills for the expenses of that month even if you haven’t paid them.
Q.
Suppose you advertised a store sale in the
City Journal on May 17. The advertisement
cost $500 and you receive a bill for it on
May 30. You have ten days to pay the bill.
Would you need to record that bill before
closing the books for May? How would you
record that bill in the books?
A.
Since it is a May expense, you do need to
record the bill before closing the books.
You would record the bill by entering a
debit to Advertising expenses (to increase
the amount you spent on advertising for
the month) and a credit to Accounts
Payable (to record the liability that must
be paid). Here is what the entry would look
like:
Debit
Credit
Advertising

Accounts Payable

Reconciling Bank Accounts
One of the biggest jobs each month is reconciling your bank account to be sure it
matches your Cash account and checkbook. Often the bank statement does not come
in on the last day of the month, so you reconcile your bank accounts at a different time
than when you are closing the books. 
You’ve likely had to reconcile your personal account. Well reconciling a business bank
account is not much different even though it likely will include a lot more transactions
than your personal account. Table 13-1 shows you a common format for reconciling a
bank account.

Sometimes you will find the balance in the bank does not match the balance in
your checkbook. When that happens you will need to find out why. Here are the
common things to check if you find a difference in your accounts:
If the bank balance is higher than your balance, the first thing you should
look for are deposits on the bank statement that are not in your Cash account
or checkbook. If you do find a deposit for which you don’t have an entry, you’ll
need to research what that deposit was for and add it appropriately to your

books. For example, if you find a bank deposit of $1,500 on May 15 and in review-
ing your books don’t see one that day for sales, you might want to review your
sales receipts for that day and see if they were recorded. If the sales weren’t
recorded, it’s an easy fix to do a journal entry for the sales. You also may find that
you missed a check you should have listed in your outstanding checks. When you
add the amount of the missing checks, you may find yourself in balance. If that’s
the case then you don’t need to make any entries to the books.
If the bank balance is lower than your balance, the first thing you should check to
see is that all the checks listed by the bank are recorded in your Cash account or
checkbook. You may have sent out a check that wasn’t recorded properly. If that’s
the case then record the check and redo your reconciliation to be sure it proves
out. Another possibility is that a deposit you did make does not show up on your
bank statement. If that happens you’ll need to find proof of the deposit and con-
tact the bank.
If all deposits and checks are correct, you’ll then need to check your math. Make
sure all checks and deposits were entered correctly as well.
Once you find the error, you will need to create a journal entry to correct the books
and make sure all affected accounts are adjusted.

Essentially you total the journals and then prepare a summary entry that will appear in
the General Ledger. Remember the General Ledger is the granddaddy of your account-

nce all the journals are closed and their information is posted to the General Ledger,
the next step in the process of closing the books is to test to see if there are any
errors. This is when the rubber meets the road in bookkeeping. If all double-entry transac-
tions have been correctly entered in the books, the books will balance and the trial will be
successful. Unfortunately few bookkeepers will find that the books balance on the first try. 
In this chapter, I show you how to do a trial balance and how to find any errors. Then I
explore how you can correct and adjust the books if necessary. 
Doing a Trial Balance Worksheet
You may think that double-entry accounting, where every transaction must include at least
two entries in the books — a debit and a credit, is too much work. When you start proving
out the books at the end of an accounting period and try to do a trial balance, you’ll see the
value of this double-entry system. After putting in hundreds, or even thousands, of entries,
the initial trial balance shows you how valuable the careful balancing of each transaction 
can be.
There are four basic steps to developing a trial balance:
1. Prepare a worksheet with three columns: one for the account titles, one for the
debits, and one for the credits.
2. Fill in all account titles and record their balances in the appropriate debit or credit
columns.
3. Total the debit and credit columns.
4. Compare the column totals.

Chapter 14: Checking and Correcting Your Books

If your debits equal your credits in the trial balance, that’s a good sign, but it’s not a
guarantee that your books are totally free of errors. It does mean that you did success-
fully enter all your transactions with balanced entries. If errors have slipped through
the cracks, your accountant will probably pick them up when he prepares the financial
reports.
If your books don’t balance when you finish the trial balance, then you need to find the
errors. Always do your trial balance with a pencil, so you can easily erase and correct
the account balances and recalculate the columns. There are four steps you can take
to find the errors:
1. Check your math. First add up your columns again and keep your fingers
crossed that you just made an error in calculation. That’s the simplest error to
find and correct.
2. Compare your balances. Double-check to be sure you wrote down the correct
balances for all the accounts and that you put them in the correct column as a
debit or credit. If you do find an error, correct it and then retotal the columns.
Hopefully that will be the answer.
3. Check your journal summaries. If Steps 1 and 2 don’t solve the problem, you’re
next step is to check your math from when you summed the journal entries to be
sure you don’t have any errors there. If you do find an error, correct your entries,
correct the posts to the General Ledger, retotal the accounts involved, and put
the new totals onto your trial balance worksheet. Hopefully then you will find the
debits and credits in balance.
4. Check your journal entries and General Ledger entries. If all else fails, you will
have to check your actual transaction entries. Your financial information will be
useless if you can’t find out why your debits don’t equal your credits. As you
become more used to what you should expect each month, you will be able to
scan your entries and pick out accounts with balances that look questionable.
Review the entries in those accounts first. For example, if you see a total in the
Office Supplies account that looks unusually high or low, then recheck the trans-
actions you recorded to that account.

Making Adjustments
Once you know your accounts are in balance using the trial balance, you’re not done
yet. You will still need to make some adjustments to the numbers to reflect use of
assets that did not involve cash. There are five key adjustments you’ll probably need
to make:
 Asset depreciation: You need to recognize the use of your long-term assets. I talk
more about depreciation in Chapter 11.
 Prepaid expenses: Some expenses, such as insurance, must be paid on an
annual or semiannual basis, even though you benefit from that payment monthly.
When you close the books for the month, you adjust the monthly expenses to
recognize that month’s use of the asset.
 Inventory: If you’re not using a computerized inventory system that automati-
cally updates inventory every day, you’ll need to adjust your Inventory account
to reflect the amount of inventory at the end of the accounting period.
 Bad debts: If some customers haven’t paid their bills and you decide to write off
their accounts as bad debts, you need to make that adjustment in the books
during the closing of the accounting period.
 Unpaid salaries and wages: Often a pay period will involve two different months.
For example you may pay employees for the last week of May during the month
of June. You would prepare an adjusting entry to acknowledge those May
expenses even if you haven’t yet paid the cash.
Depreciation
Depreciation commonly involves a business’s largest non-cash expense. Businesses
depreciate most assets that they use for more than a 12-month period, such as cars, 
furniture, buildings, and equipment. Most small businesses record their depreciation
expenses once a year when then prepare their annual reports, but some do record
them monthly or quarterly. Major corporations that must report quarterly will calculate
depreciation expenses on a quarterly basis. I assume an annual depreciation expense
calculation in the problems below, but if you work in a business that records monthly
depreciation expenses, you will need to divide the annual depreciation expense by 12.
Also to keep the calculation simple for this chapter, I use the straight-line depreciation
calculation. You can review the more complicated types of depreciation calculations in
Chapter 11.

Q.
You are preparing to close the books at the end of the year and your company owns a truck with a
cost basis of $50,000 and a salvage value of $10,000. Assume a five-year useful life. How much would
you record for depreciation expenses for the year? What would your adjusting entry be?
A.
$50,000 – $10,000 = $40,000 amount that will be depreciated
$40,000/5 = $8,000 amount that will be depreciated each year
Debit

Prepaid expenses
Sometimes your company will have to pay in advance for expenses on items from
which it benefits throughout the year, such as insurance or rent. When this happens
you initially enter the payment as an asset called Prepaid Expenses and then allocate
the expense on a monthly basis using an adjusting entry.

Q.
Suppose your company pays $7,500 semiannually for insurance on all its vehicles. You are closing
the books for the month of May. What adjusting entry would you need to make?
A.
First calculate the monthly expense: $7,500 / 6 months = $1,250 per month
Then you would enter this adjusting entry in the books:
Debit
Credit
Insurance Expense
$1,250
Prepaid Expenses
$1,250
The Insurance Expense would be shown on the Income Statement and the Prepaid Expenses,
which are an asset on the Balance Sheet, would be reduced by the credit. This reflects the using
up of the Prepaid Expenses, as well as acknowledging the expenses for the month involved.

Solve It
Inventory
Most businesses adjust the balance of their asset account inventory at the end of
each month. Some that use a computerized inventory system may do so daily. In
Chapter 7, I talk more about how to manage and value your inventory. When closing
the books for the month you must take these three steps to adjust your asset account
inventory:
1. Determine the inventory remaining on hand. 
2. Set a value for that inventory.
3. Prepare an adjusting entry for the General Ledger that reflects the inventory
remaining.
If you do have inventory remaining, you want to reflect that asset on the Balance Sheet
and you want to reduce the cost of that remaining inventory as an expense for that
month. The remaining inventory will be sold the next month. If you used inventory
that was purchased the previous month, you would need to adjust the Purchases
Expenses to reflect the additional expenses.
Q.
At the end of the month you find that you
have $10,000 of inventory remaining. You
started the month with $9,500. What adjust-
ing entry would you make to the books?
You first need to calculate the difference
and determine whether you ended up with
additional inventory, which means you pur-
chased inventory that was not used that
month. If that is the case you would then
need to prepare an adjusting entry to
increase the asset inventory and you
would need to decrease your Purchases
Expenses because those purchases will be
sold in the next month.
A.
In this case, you find that you have $500
more in inventory, so this is the adjusting
entry you would need to make:
Debit
Credit
Inventory
$500
Purchases Expense
$500
This entry would increase the Inventory
account on the Balance Sheet and decrease
the Purchases Expense account on the
Income Statement.

Solve It
Bad debts
Sometimes you have customers that just don’t pay their bills. I talk more about how to
keep track of your customer accounts in Chapter 8. When you close your books at the
end of the month, you should always review your customer accounts. At some point
you must accept the fact that some customers will never pay. Most companies will
write off nonpaying customers after they are more than six months late on paying their
bills as a bad debt expense. You can record bad debts by identifying specific customers
that you don’t think will pay or you can establish a bad debt percentage based on 
historical experience. For example, if you have found over the years that 5 percent 
of your Accounts Receivable account will not be paid, then you can write off that per-
centage of Accounts Receivable each month.
Q.
You identify six customers that are more
than six months late and the total amount
due from those customers is $1,500. What
adjusting entry would you make to the
books?
A.
You would make this adjusting entry to the
books:
Debit
Credit
Bad Debt Expense
$1,500
Accounts Receivable
$1,500
With this entry the Bad Debt Expense
would be shown on the Income Statement
and the Accounts Receivable account bal-
ance would be reduced by $1,500 thereby
reducing the asset.

13. Your payroll for the last full week in May 
is $10,000, but it won’t be paid until June.

full week of June is the same amount.
Solve It
14. Your payroll for the last four days of May
will not be paid until June 8. The biweekly
payroll totals $5,000 and each work week

the books? What would the entry be 
when the cash is actually paid out?
Solve It
Unpaid salaries and wages
If your payroll period is biweekly and the last week of the month falls under the next
month’s payroll, you then have to record the unpaid payroll expenses. You do this
entering the anticipated payroll expenses for the week into an accrual account.
Q.
Your payroll for the last week of May will
not be paid until June. Your salary and
wages for the biweekly payroll total $6,000
on June 7. How much would you record in
payroll expenses for the month of May? 
A.
Your first step would be to calculate the
portion of the payroll that reflects payroll
expenses for the month of May. Since the
payroll is on June 7 reflecting a seven-day
week, you can assume that half the payroll
is for May and half is for June. So $3,000
would be a May expense. Here is the entry
you would make:
Debit
Credit
Payroll Expenses
$3,000
Accrued Payroll 
$3,000
Expenses
When cash is used to pay the employees in
June, you would then reverse this entry:
Debit
Credit
Accrued Payroll 
$3,000
Expenses
Payroll Expenses
$3,000
Cash
$6,000
When recording this use of cash, half of the
cash is used to reverse the accrual and half
is used as new payroll expenses in June.

Reworking Your Chart of Accounts
After you fully close the books for the year, you may want to make changes to your
Chart of Accounts. You may find that you didn’t use an account through most of the
year and you want to delete it completely the next year. Or you may find that you put
all Office Expenses into one account and you think you can get a better handle on 
managing certain expenses, such as paper or postage, by creating separate expense
accounts for the next year. 
As long as you are just adding an expense account and all expense accounts start with
a zero at the beginning of the year, you can just add the account and notify staff of the
new account and its coding numbers for the next year. You should explain to your staff
what types of expenses should be charged to that expense number. If you want to
delete an expense account after it has been closed for the year, you can just delete it
from the Chart of Accounts and be sure to notify staff to no longer use that account.
The same process is used for revenue accounts, which also start with zero balance
each year.
Asset, liability and equity accounts are handled differently because their balances
carry over from year to year. For example, most businesses carry a cash balance from
one year to the next, as well as buildings, furniture, equipment, and other assets. The
same is true for liabilities and equity. You can’t just zero out the balance of a loan on
which you still owe money or bills that still need to be paid. Instead you carry over the
liability balances to the next year. Company owners certainly don’t appreciate losing
record of their investment, so you carry over the balances in equity accounts as well.

Solve It
You can always add an account during the year, but you should only delete an account
at the end of a year, so you don’t risk creating problems with developing your financial
statements. If you do decide to add an account during the year, you’ll need to transfer
any transactions related to the new account from the account in which they were ini-
tially entered.
Q.

expenses separately rather than lump

to do to start that account?

fter all the books are closed, it’s time to prepare the financial results for the public,
including governmental agencies, financial institutions, vendors, and investors. In this
chapter you’ll explore the key parts of a Balance Sheet, which shows what your business
owns and what it owes as of a particular date, as well as how much the owners have
invested in the company. 
Exploring the Balance Sheet
You get a snapshot of what the business owns (its assets) and what the business owes (its
liabilities or debts) when you read the Balance Sheet. You also find out how much equity
owners of the business hold. It’s called the Balance Sheet because it shows your accounts
are in balance based on this key accounting equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
One column of the Balance Sheet totals the Assets and the second column totals the liabili-
ties and then totals the equity separately. The total of the liabilities and the equity should
equal the total of the asset column.
Gathering the Numbers
Your first step in preparing the Balance Sheet will be to find all the numbers. If you’ve set up
your Chart of Accounts properly, you should find the key accounts are at the top of the list.
These include
Cash
Accounts Receivable
Inventory
Equipment
Vehicles
Furniture
Accounts Payable
Loans Payable 
Owner’s Capital

Once you’ve identified all your accounts you will need to group them into five groups:
 Current Assets accounts: Assets that you expect to use in the next 12 months.
 Long-Term Assets accounts: Assets that you expect to own for more than 
12 months.
 Current Liabilities accounts: Liabilities that you expect to pay in the next 
12 months.
 Long-Term Liabilities accounts: Liabilities that you will pay over more than 
12 months.
 Equity accounts: Accounts that reflect the claims owners have against the 
company.

Preparing the Statement for Prime Time
Once you’ve grouped your accounts, you’re ready to prepare the Balance Sheet. There
are three types of formats used by companies:
 Account format: a two-column format with assets on one side and liabilities and
equity on the other side.
 Report format: a one column layout with assets listed first, then liabilities and
then equities.
 Financial position format: This format is used primarily outside the U.S. and has
two line items not included in the account or report format — working capital and
net assets. Working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from
current assets to give the financial statement reader a quick check on whether the
company has enough current assets to pay the bills. Net assets subtracts total lia-
bilities from total assets to show what the company has left over for its owners.

Working with Your Balance Sheet Numbers
Every business person wants to know how he looks to the outside world and whether
his company will look good to the banks or vendors from whom he may want to borrow
money. If he’s looking to raise additional cash for the business, he also wants to know
how the numbers look to potential investors. There are three key ratios that financial
institutions and investors use to find out the financial stability of a company based on
the Balance Sheet numbers — current ratio, acid test ratio, and debt to equity ratio.

Part V: Putting on Your Best Financial Face 
10. Suppose your Balance Sheet shows that
your current assets equaled $22,000 and
your current liabilities equaled $52,000.

good or bad sign to lenders?

your current assets equaled $32,000 and
your current liabilities equaled $34,000.

Solve It
Current ratio
This ratio compares your current assets to your current liabilities. It provides a quick
glimpse of your company’s ablitity to pay its bills.
The formual for calculating this ratio is:
Current assets/Current liabilites = Current ratio
Q.
Suppose your Balance Sheet shows that
your current assets equaled $52,000 and
your current liabilities equaled $22,000.
What would your current ratio be?
A.
Here is how you would calculate the cur-
rent ratio:
$52,000/$22,000 = 2.36
So is that number good or bad?  Lenders
usually look for a current ratio of 1.2 to 2,
so a financial institution would consider a
current ratio of 2.36 a good sign. A current
ratio under 1 could be considered a sign of
trouble because it indicates the company
doesn’t have enough cash to pay it’s cur-
rent bills. A current ratio over 2 may indi-
cate that you are not investing your assets
as well as you could. For example, if your
company is holding a lot of cash, you may
want to consider investing that money in
some long-term assets such as additional
equipment that you need to help grow the
business.

Chapter 15: Showing Everything’s in Balance
12. Suppose your Balance Sheet shows that
your current assets equaled $45,000 and
your current liabilities equaled $37,000.
What would your current ratio be? Is that a
good or bad sign to lenders?
S Solve It
Acid test (quick) ratio
The acid test ratio is a stricter test of your company’s ability to pay its bills. The acid
test ratio only includes the value of your cash accounts, Accounts Receivable and
Marketable Securities. The value of your inventory is not included in this calculation
because inventory may or may not be able to be converted to cash quickly (sold to
customers in the matter of a few days). In an economic downturn it could take a while
to sell your inventory. Many lenders do prefer using the acid test ratio to determine
whether or not to loan your money.
Calculating the acid test ratio is a two step process:
1. Determine your quick assets:
Cash + Accounts Receivable + Marketable Securities = Quick assets
2. Calculate your acid test ratio:
Quick assets/Current liabilities = Acid test ratio

your Cash account equaled $5,000, your
Accounts Receivable account equaled

your Cash account equaled $10,000, your
Accounts Receivable equaled $12,000 and

Q.
Suppose your Balance Sheet shows that
your Cash equaled $20,000, your Accounts
Receivable equaled $12,000 and your
Marketable Securities equaled $10,000, and
your current liabilities equaled $22,000.
What would your current ratio be?
A.
Here is how you would calculate the cur-
rent ratio:
First calculate your quick assets:
$20,000 + $12,000 + $10,000 = $42,000
Next calculate your quick ratio:
$42,000/$22,000 = 1.91
So is that number good or bad?  Lenders
usually look for a acid test ratio of around
1 for a company to be considerd in good
condition. So an acid test ratio of 1.91 is a
good sign. A current ratio under 1 could be
considered a sign of trouble because it
indicates the company may have to sell
some of its marketable securities or take
on more debt to pay its bills until it can sell
some inventory.

Debt-to-equity ratio
Before a business owner should even approach a lender for an additional loan, he should
always check out his debt condition. One common ratio used for this purpose is the
debt-to-equity ratio. This ratio compares what a business owes to what a business owns. 
Calculating the debt to equity ratio is a two-step process:
1. Calculate your total debt:
Current liabilities + Long-term liabilities = Total debt
2. Calculate your debt-to-equity ratio:
Total debt/Equity = Debt-to-equity ratio

Q.
Suppose a business’s current liabilities
were $22,000 and its long-term liabilities
were $75,000. The owner’s equity in the
company totaled $67,000. What would the
debt-to-equity ratio be? Is this a good or
bad sign for investors?
A.
First calculate the total debt:
$22,000 + $75,000 = $97,000
Next calculate the debt to equity ratio:
$97,000/$67,000 = 1.44
This debt-to-equity ratio over 1 would be a
bad sign. Banks prefer the debt-to-equity
ratio to be close to one. A company with a
debt-to-equity ratio over 1 indicates that
the owner’s do not have enough invested
in the company. A debt-to-equity ratio of
less than 1 would not be a problem for a
lender.

Calculate the current ratio:
$22,000/$52,000 = .42
This ratio is considerably below 1.2, so it would be considered a very bad sign. A ratio this low
would indicate that a company may have trouble paying its bills because its current liabilites
are considerably higher than the money the company has on hand in current assets. 
218

k
Calculate the current ratio:
$32,000/$34,000 = .94
The current ratio is slightly below the preferred minimum of 1.2, which would be considered a
bad sign. A financial institution may loan money to this company, but consider it a higher risk.
A company with this current ratio would pay higher interest rates than one in the 1.2 to 2 cur-
rent ratio preferred range.
l
Calculate the current ratio:
$45,000/$37,000 = 1.22
The current ratio is at 1.22, so it would be considerd a good sign and the company probably
would not have difficulty borrowing money.
m
First you would calculate your quick assets:
$5,000 + $20,000 + $10,000 = $35,000
Then you would calculate your acid test ratio:
$35,000/$52,000 = .67
An acid test ratio of under 1 would be considered a bad sign. A company with this ratio would
have a difficult time getting loans from a financial institution.
n
First you would calculate your quick assets:
$10,000 + $12,000 + $10,000 = $32,000
Then you would calculate your acid test ratio:
$32,000/$34,000 = .94
An acid test ratio of under 1 would be considered a bad sign. Since this company’s acid test
ratio is close to one it could probably get a loan, but would have to pay a higher interest rate
because it would be considered a higher risk.
o
First you would calculate your quick assets:
$15,000 + $17,000 + $8,000 = $40,000
Then you would calculate your acid test ratio:
$40,000/$37,000 = 1.08
An acid test ratio of over 1 would be considered a good sign. A company with this ratio would
probably be able to get loans from a financial institution without difficulty.
p
First you would calculate your total debt:
$2,200 + $35,000 = $37,200
Then you would calculate your debt-to-equity ratio:
$37,200/$12,500 = 2.98
A debt-to-equity ratio of over 1 would be considered a bad sign. A company with this ratio
would probably be able not be able to get loans from a financial institution until the owners put
more money into the business from other sources, such as family and friends or a private
investor.

First you would calculate your total debt:
$5,700 + $35,000 = $40,700
Then you would calculate your debt-to-equity ratio:
$40,700/$42,000 = .97
A debt-to-equity ratio near 1 would be considered a good sign. A company with this ratio would
probably be able to get loans from a financial institution, but the institution may require addi-
tional funds from the owner or investors as well if the company is applying for a large 
unsecured loan. A loan secured with assets, such as a mortgage, would not be a problem.

E
very business person wants to know whether or not they made a profit. The Income
Statement gives you the information you need to calculate a business’ profit or loss for
the accounting period. 
In this chapter you will review the parts of an Income Statement and how it is developed.
You’ll then be given the opportunity to practice developing an income statement and analyz-
ing its results.
Exploring the Income Statement
An Income Statement summarizes all the sales activities, costs incurred to produce those
sales, and the expenses incurred to run the business. After reviewing these numbers a busi-
ness discovers its bottom line during the accounting period being reported in the Income
Statement. With this statement you can answer the crucial question — did I make a profit?
When preparing an Income Statement, the normal practice is to show three accounting peri-
ods, which can include a month, a quarter, a year, or some other period of time that makes
sense for your business. For example, if you are showing the results for the year 2006, you
would also include results for the years 2005 and 2004 on the Income Statement you prepare.
There are five key parts of an Income Statement:
 Sales or Revenue: The top line of any Income Statement shows the total sales or rev-
enues collected during the accounting period being reported.
 Cost of Goods Sold: This line item shows the amount you spent to purchase the prod-
ucts you sold or the costs you incurred to provide the services you offer.
 Gross Profit: This line shows how much profit a business makes from its sales before
including the overall expenses of running the business. This is calculated by subtracting
Cost of Goods Sold from Sales or Revenue.
 Operating Expenses: The line items in this section of the Income Statement will show how
much was spent when operating the business, which includes advertising, administrative
expenses, rent, utilities, and any other expenses you incurred to run the business.
 Net Income or Loss: This is the bottom line of the Income Statement. When you subtract
your operating expenses from your Gross Profit you will know whether or not the busi-
ness made a profit.

during the accounting period. What section
of the Income Statement would include
that information?
a. Sales or Revenue
b. Cost of Goods Sold
c. Gross Profit
d. Operating Expenses
e. Net Income or Loss
A.
The answer would be d, Operating
Expenses. Salaries and wages are always
considered an operating expense. While
some of those salaries may have been paid
to people involved in selling your products,
Cost of Goods Sold only involves the
expenses that can be directly linked to a
product sold, such as the purchase of
goods or the delivery of those goods.

Formatting the Income Statement
Businesses use two different formats for their Income Statements — the single-step
and the multi-step formats. Both formats contain the same information, but they look a
bit different. The single-step format groups all accounts into two categories — revenue
and expenses. The multi-step format divides the Income Statement into several sec-
tions and gives the reader some key subtotals not shown in the more basic single-step
format including Gross Profit, Operating Expenses (separated from Costs of Goods
Sold), and operating income. If the company earns income or incurs expenses from
sources other than its primary business activities, such as interest income, you would
set up a separate section of the Income Statement for Other Income or Expenses.

Preparing the Numbers
You may be wondering how you find the numbers for your Income Statement. You’ll
find those in your General Ledger (Chapter 4). If you’re not sure which accounts
belong on the Income Statement, I summarize the Income Statement accounts in
Chapter 3 where I discuss setting up your Chart of Accounts.
Net Sales
Most Income Statements only list Net Sales in their revenue section and don’t include
all the accounts used to calculate those Net Sales. The key accounts used in calculat-
ing Net Sales include
 Sales of Goods or Services: Totals all the money the company earned selling its
products, services, or both in this account.
 Sales Discounts: Totals any discounts you offered to customers that reduced the
full price of merchandise.
 Sales Returns: Totals all returns from customers. 
To calculate Net Sales you subtract any Sales Discounts or Sales Returns from your
Total Sales (also known as Gross Sales).

you to three key ratios — Return on Sales, Return on Assets, and Return on Equity.
These ratios don’t mean much unless you know what the common ratio is for your
type of business. Check with your local chamber of commerce to find out ratios for
similar local businesses. You can also order reports for your industry through
BizMiner (www.bizminer.com).

Return on Sales
The Return on Sales (ROS) ratio gives you an idea of how efficiently your company
runs its operations. Using this ratio you can measure how much profit your company
produced per dollar of sales. You calculate ROS by dividing your net income before
taxes by your net sales. If you are working for a small business owner who does not
need to pay corporate taxes, you don’t have to worry about taxes at all.
Q.
Suppose your company had a net income
of $4,500 and sales of $18,875 for the month
of May, calculate the Return on Sales Ratio.
A.
The Return on Sales Ratio would be
$4,500/$18,875 = 23.8%
So in this case the company made 23.8% on
each dollar of sales.

13. Your company’s net income for the month
of May is $10,700 and its total assets are

Solve It
Return on Assets
The Return on Assets (ROA) ratio lets you test how well you are using the company’s
assets to generate profits. If your company’s ROA is the same or higher than other sim-
ilar companies you are doing well. To calculate the ROA you divide net income by total
assets. You find total assets on your balance sheet, which is discussed in Chapter 15.
Q.
Your company’s net income for the month
of May is $4,500 and its total assets are
$40,050. What is the Return of Assets ratio?
A.
The Return on Assets ratio is:
$4,500/$40,050 = 11.2%
This means your company made 11.2%
profit on each dollar of assets it held. The
ROA ratio can vary greatly depending on
industries. It can be as low as 5% for manu-
facturing industries that must spend a lot
on equipment and factories, or as high as
20% or higher for service industries that
don’t need to spend as much on their
assets.

Q.
Your company earned a net income of
$4,500 and its owner’s equity is $50,500.
Calculate the Return on Equity ratio.
A.
The answer would be:
$4,500/$50,500 = 8.9%
So the owner’s return on his investment is
8.9%.
Return on Equity
The Return on Equity (ROE) ratio measures how successful your company was in earn-
ing money for its owners or investors. You calculate ROE by dividing net income by
shareholder’s or owner’s equity. You find the shareholder’s or owner’s equity on the
Balance Sheet (Chapter 15).

 Discovering types of businesses
 Reporting to the Feds
 Paying sales taxes
H
ow a business pays taxes and reports its income to the government depends upon
how the business is structured. In this chapter, you will find a brief overview of busi-
ness types and how taxes are handled for each type. You will also review the key concepts
you need to file business tax returns for a sole proprietorship or a partnership. You will find
a very brief overview of some key tax issues involved in corporate tax preparation, but cor-
porate taxation can be a textbook in itself so I won’t be discussing the forms that are filed.
Exploring Business Types
Not all businesses are the same. How a business is structured determines how that business
will be taxed. Businesses come in four types — sole proprietorship, partnership, limited lia-
bility companies, and corporations. 
Sole Proprietorships are businesses owned by one individual. These are the simplest
form of business structure.
Partnerships are businesses owned by two or more individuals. This structure is slightly
more complicated than a sole proprietorship because partners must work out key
issues of how to divide the profits, how a partner can sell his share if he or she decides
to leave, what will happen to a partner’s share if he dies, and how the partnership will
be dissolved if a partner wants to leave.
Limited Liability Companies (LLC) can be a sole proprietorship or a partnership, but the
key difference is that the company has registered differently with the state to protect its
owners from being held personally liable for company actions. This business type is
somewhere between a sole proprietorship or partnership and a corporation. For exam-
ple, many law firms and accounting firms are set up as LLCs.
Corporations are the most complex type of business. In legal matters they are held as 
a separate legal entity. Forming a corporation requires extensive legal filings. There 
are many rules for how the company must operate to satisfy government regulations.
Owners of a corporation, known as shareholders or stockholders, cannot be sued per-
sonally for actions of the corporation, but there are extensive rules governing how a 
corporation must be run, as well as extensive reporting requirements to state and 
federal government entities.

U.S. Small Business Administration’s Small Business Planner (http://www.sba.gov/

The answer is a, Sole Proprietorship.

Tax Reporting 
Each business type must file different forms with the IRS to report their business activ-
ities and pay taxes on what the business earns. For sole proprietorships, partnerships,
and LLCs the actual taxes due on the profits made by the business are paid by the
owners of the business and filed as part of their personal tax returns. Corporations are
taxed as a separate entity and must pay corporate taxes. In this section I discuss the
forms that must be filed by each business type. 
Sole proprietors
Sole proprietors don’t have to file tax forms separately to report their business earn-
ings. Instead most attach a Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business, to their individual
1040 tax return. You can see a copy of this two page form at http://www.irs.gov/
pub/irs-pdf/f1040sc.pdf. 
In addition to paying taxes on any business profits at the same rate as your individual
tax rate, you must also pay taxes for Social Security and Medicare. Sole proprietors
must pay both the employer and employee portions of these taxes. When you are an
employee you pay 6.2 percent for Social Security taxes and 1.45 percent for Medicare
taxes. As a business owner, you also need to pay the employer’s portion, which are the
same percentages as an employee. So your Social Security and Medicare taxes are dou-
bled — 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. 
Social Security taxes were paid on income earned up to $97,500 in 2007. If your busi-
ness earns more than that, you don’t have to pay Social Security taxes above that
amount. The cap on earnings for the purpose of calculating Social Security taxes
changes each year and is linked to the inflation rate. In October of each year the 
Social Security Administration announces the new earnings cap. 
To calculate these taxes, you must file a Schedule SE, Self-Employment Tax. You can see
a copy of this two-page form at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sse.pdf.

Partnerships
Partnerships do not have to pay taxes on their earnings; instead the earnings are paid
by the owners of the partnership and reported on their individual returns. But, the
business must file what is called an information return Schedule K-1 (Partner’s Share of
Income, Deductions, Credits, etc.) for each of its partners. The partners then use the
information on the Schedule K-1 to complete their individual returns. You can see a
copy of Schedule K-1 at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1065sk1.pdf. 
Most partners will attach a Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss, to report the
business earnings on their individual returns. You can see a copy of this form at
http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040se.pdf. 
Limited liability companies
How an LLC files taxes depends upon whether it is a sole proprietorship or a partner-
ship. There are no specific federal tax forms for an LLC, since these types of companies
are formed under state rules. If you are keeping the books for an LLC, you would file
taxes according to the rules for a sole proprietorship or partnership. For more informa-
tion on specific tax issues involving LLCs, read the IRS publication 3402, “Tax Issues for
Limited Liability Companies” at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3402.pdf.

Corporations
Corporations come in two varieties S Corporation and C Corporation. An S Corporation
can only be formed if it has less than 75 stockholders. All other corporations are C
Corporations. If your business is set up as an S Corporation, the corporation must file
informational returns but it is not taxed as a separate entity. Instead the stockholders
report the earnings from the S Corporation on the same form used by partnerships,
Schedule E.
C Corporations are taxed as an individual entity. Corporate tax filings are very compli-
cated and beyond the scope of this book, but Table 17-1 shows you the corporate tax
rates.

Determining Sales Taxes
An even more complicated job for the bookkeeper than filing federal tax forms, can be
keeping up with local and state tax rates. If your business operates in more than one
locality or more than one state, you must pay taxes on sales that you make based on
the rules in each of the localities and states in which your business is located.
This process can get very messy because you must add the sales tax to each sale
based on the taxes for the locality or state in which the store is located. In order to 
collect taxes for the state, each state requires you to file an application to collect and
report taxes even before you open the doors of your business. The Federation of Tax
Administrators (www.taxadmin.org/) tracks changes in state tax rates, but depending
on the rules for sales taxes in your state, you may have to adjust those rates based on
county or city sales taxes. 
Sales taxes are collected with each sale and tracked in a liability account called Sales
Taxes Collected. Most states require you to pay sales taxes monthly and many provide
for electronic transfer of the funds. I talk about how to calculate and record sales taxes
when making a sale in Chapter 8.

Getting Ready for a New 
Bookkeeping Year
In This Chapter
 Closing the books
 Looking at customer accounts
 Reviewing vendor accounts
 Cycling into the new year
A
t the end of every accounting period certain accounts are closed and others remain
open. In this chapter, you will review the accounts that continue from one business
cycle to the next, as well as the accounts that must be closed at the end of each cycle and
started with a zero balance in the next cycle. You’ll explore key decisions that must be
made about customer and vendor accounts.
Finalizing the Ledger
Once you’ve processed all possible payments for the year and accounted for all possible
income, reviewed all your accounts, balanced out your books, and prepared the financial
statements for the accounting period, it’s time to finalize your General Ledger and get ready
for a new year. Some accounts will carry over their balances into the new year (Balance
Sheet accounts) and others will start with a zero balance (Income Statement accounts).
Closing Income Statement accounts
Once you’re sure you’ve made any needed corrections or adjustments that were identified
when preparing your trial balance (Chapter 14) and you’ve collected the information needed
from those accounts for your financial statements, you can then zero out the balances of all
the Income Statement accounts. This will include all revenue, cost of goods sold, and
expense accounts. 
You don’t throw away the accounting information for the prior accounting period. You just
start new pages in your journals and General Ledger accounts with a zero balance for the
new accounting period.

d. Ignore It
Solve It
If you’re using a computerized accounting system, follow the procedures for closing
the accounting period. The accounting system will archive the data for the accounting
period and zero out the accounts during the closing process.
Carrying over Balance Sheet accounts
Balance Sheet accounts never get zeroed out. All these accounts will carry their bal-
ance into the next year. You still have the underlying assets, such as cash in your bank
accounts, furniture in your stores or buildings you own, so you don’t want to zero out
their values. You still owe your creditors and will need to pay any debts either during
the next accounting period or during some future accounting period. For example, a
mortgage is paid over many years and its balance would be carried over until paid off.
The owners of the company certainly still own their share of the company and you
must carry over details of that ownership.

Reviewing Customer Accounts
You will likely close your books on a monthly basis, but do a more extensive closing
process at the end of a 12-month accounting period. During this year-end close it’s a
good idea to take a more critical look at your customer accounts. In Chapter 8 I dis-
cuss writing off accounts for bad debts, but at year-end it’s time to take a harder look.
Bad debt can be used as an expense to reduce taxes, so if you believe certain cus-
tomers will never pay, it’s a good idea to just write them off at year-end and not pay
taxes on what otherwise would be shown as a profit for your company. Even if you’re a
sole proprietor, reducing net income will reduce the amount of taxes you must pay on
your profits. In fact a sole proprietor can reduce not only income taxes, but also Social
Security and Medicare taxes when he or she reduces net income.
Q.
At the end of the year when closing the
books, you find you have six customers
who are more than 90 days past due. You
don’t expect any of the customers to pay.
The customers owe a total of $1,500. What
entry should you make in your books?
A.
You should make this entry:
Debit
Credit
Bad Debt
$1,500
Accounts Receivable
$1,500
You should also reflect the write-off in each
of the customer’s accounts.

Assessing Vendor Accounts
During the closing process you should also review your vendor accounts to be sure all
bills related to the prior accounting period are entered into the books. If you find an
unpaid bill that does reflect expenses for the period you are about to close, you should
record that bill by crediting the Accounts Payable account and debiting the appropri-
ate account.

Q.
In reviewing your vendor accounts, you

A.
Debit
Credit
Telephone Expenses
$135
Accounts Payable
$135
If you already completed your trial bal-
ance, you will need to adjust the numbers
to reflect this missing expense.

Deleting Accounts
At the end of an accounting year is a good time to review all your accounts and decide
whether or not you still them. If you decide you don’t need an account any longer, the
closing process is an ideal time to delete accounts. You should never delete an
account in the middle of an accounting year. If you do find that you want to delete an
account in the middle, then start a list of accounts you want to delete at the end of the
year.
If an account you want to delete is an Income Statement account, then it’s very easy to
delete. Because you will be zeroing out all the accounts, you can just delete the
account from your Chart of Accounts. If the account is a balance sheet account and it
does carry a balance, you will need to move the value of the assets, liabilities, or equi-
ties to an account that will still be open. You would move the assets by making an
entry in your General Ledger.

Preparing to Restart Business Cycle
The monthly closing process for any business can take a week or more as needed
adjustments and corrections are made. Closing at year-end can take several weeks.
Most businesses will send out notices to their employees telling them any revenues or
expenses that they want entered for the current year must be in accounting by a cer-
tain cutoff date.

books: one set that is being closed and a new set for the new account cycle. If you are
closing the books at month-end, you may just start a new journal page for the new
month. But, at year-end you would more likely have a new set of journals for the new
year. 
If you are using a computerized accounting system, this restart of the accounting cycle
will be managed by the software program, but it is a good idea to print out a report of
your year-end account data before starting the closing process in case something goes
wrong. Also you should back up your data on a disc before starting the closing process
in your computerized accounting system.
At year-end you will also need to make up new files for all your vendors, contractors,
and customers. If you have room in your office, you will likely use one file cabinet for
the current year and one for the previous year. To set up the files for the new year, you
would likely box up the files from two years ago and use those drawers for the new
year. For example, if you are getting ready for 2008 and have one filing cabinet with
2007 files and one with 2006 files, you would box up the 2006 files to make room for 
the 2008 files. In Chapter 6, I discuss record keeping and how long you must keep 
your files.

Answers to Problems on Getting Ready 
for a New Bookkeeping Year
a
A: Zero it out. The Purchasing account is part of the calculation for cost of goods sold. This is
an Income Statement account.
b
B: Carry it over to the next accounting period. You certainly want to keep track of your cash. 
It doesn’t disappear just because you enter a new accounting period. The Cash account is a
Balance Sheet account, as are all asset accounts.
c
B: Carry it over to the next accounting period. While you might wish you could zero out a loan,
unfortunately you can’t and you do need to carry over the liability to the next accounting
period. All liability accounts are Balance Sheet accounts.
d
B: Carry it over to the next accounting period. Owners certainly don’t want to lose track of the
amount they’ve invested in the company. All equity accounts (Balance Sheet accounts) are car-
ried over to the next accounting period.
e
A: Zero it out. The Advertising account is an expense account and it is shown on the Income
Statement. You don’t carry over expenses from one accounting period to the next.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
join in the For Dummies series tradition of showing you
some lists of tens — key factors to maintaining your
books and using the information collected. I highlight the
top ten accounts you should monitor and the top ten ways
to manage your business’ cash using your books.

Top Ten Checklist for 
Managing Your Cash
In This Chapter

 Handling transactions
 Reviewing financial results
 Tracking costs and setting prices

any business owners think of bookkeeping as a necessary evil, but in reality if you
make effective use of the data collected, bookkeeping can be your best buddy for
managing your cash. The key to taking advantage of what bookkeeping has to offer is under-
standing the value of basic bookkeeping principles and taking advantage of the information
collected. This chapter reviews the top ten ways to manage your business cash with your
books.
Charting the Way
You may think that a list of accounts, called the Chart of Accounts, is not a big deal. Well
that’s far from the truth. The Chart of Accounts dictates how your financial data will be col-
lected and where your transactions will be put. It’s crucial to define each account carefully
and determine exactly what types of transactions will go where in order to be able to use the
information collected effectively. I talk more about the Chart of Accounts and how to set one
up in Chapter 3.
Balancing Your Entries
Keeping your books balanced is the only way to know how your business is doing. You can
never know whether your profit numbers are accurate, if your business’ books don’t bal-
ance. In bookkeeping, a process called double-entry bookkeeping is used to keep the books
balanced. I talk more about this basic principle and how to keep the books balanced in
Chapter 2.

Posting Your Transactions
In order to be able to use the information regarding your business transactions, they
must be posted accurately to your accounts. If you forgot to post a transaction to your
books, your reports will not reflect that financial activity. Or, if you post a transaction
to your books that is not accurate, your reports using that information will be wrong. I
talk more about the posting process in Chapters 4 and 5.
Tracking Customer Collections
If your business sells to customers on store credit, you certainly want to be sure your
customers pay for their purchases in the future. Customer account information is col-
lected in the Accounts Receivable account, as well as in individual records for each
customer. You should review reports based on customer payment history, called aging
reports, on a monthly basis to be sure customers are paying on time. You may want to
cut off customers from future purchases if their accounts are past due for 90 days or
more. You set the rules for store credit. I talk more about how to manage customer
accounts in Chapter 8.
Paying Bills Accurately and on Time
If you want to continue getting supplies, products, and services from your vendors and
contractors, you must be sure you pay them accurately and on time. You also want to
be sure that you don’t pay anyone twice. Payments are managed through the Accounts
Payable account. You should review your payment history and be sure your are
making timely and accurate payments. I talk more about managing your payments in
Chapter 7.
Planning Profits
Nothing is more important to a business owner than the profits he will ultimately
make. Yet many business owners don’t take the time to plan their profit expectations
at the beginning of each year, so they have nothing to use to gauge how well they are
doing throughout the year. Take the time to develop profit expectations and a budget
that will help you meet the expectations before the year starts. Then develop a series
of internal financial reports using the numbers you collect in your bookkeeping system
that will help you determine whether or not you are meeting your sales targets and
maintaining control over your product costs and operating expenses. I talk more about
sales tracking in Chapter 8, costs and expense tracking in Chapter 7, and how to deter-
mine your net profit in Chapter 15.
Comparing Budget to Actual Expenses 
Keeping a careful watch on how well your budget planning reflects what is actually
going on in your business can help you meet your profit goals. Take the time to
develop a budget that sets your expectations for the year and then develop internal
252
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

reports that give you the ability to track how closely your actual expenses match that
budget. If you see any major problems, correct them as soon as possible to be sure
you’ll be able to meet your target profit at the end of the year. I talk about managing
expenses in Chapter 7.
Comparing Sales Goals to Actual Sales
In addition to watching your expenses, you also need to be sure your actual sales
match the sales goals you set at the beginning of the year. Designing an internal report
that allows you to track sales goals versus actual sales gives you the ability to monitor
how well your business is doing. If you find your actual sales are below expectations,
the earlier in the year you correct that problem the better chance you’ll have to meet
those year-end goals. I talk about how to track sales in Chapter 8.
Tracking Cost Trends
It’s important to know what is happening to the costs involved in purchasing the prod-
ucts you sell or the raw materials you use to manufacture your products. These costs
trends can have a major impact on whether or not your company will earn the net
income you expect. If you find the costs are trending upward, you may need to adjust
the prices of the products you sell in order to meet your profit goals. I talk more about
tracking cost trends in Chapter 7.
Making Pricing Decisions
Many factors must be considered when determining what price to charge your cus-
tomers. You need to consider not only how much you pay to buy the product (or to
manufacture the product) you sell, but you also must factor in what you pay your
employees as well as other advertising and administrative expenses you incur in order
to set a price. You can’t set that price too high though or you may not find any cus-
tomers willing to buy the product. Properly pricing your product can be a critical
factor in determining whether or not your product will sell. While the numbers in your
books regarding product costs and operating expenses are not the only factor in
making a pricing decision, the information is critical to help you make that decision.
You’ll also need market research about what customers will pay for a product in addi-
tion to the product cost and operating expense data to set a price. I talk more about
tracking costs and expenses in Chapter 7 and calculating profit in Chapter 16.

Top Ten Accounts You Should Monitor

hile each and every account has its purpose in bookkeeping, all accounts are not
created equally. Some accounts are more critical than others. This chapter looks at
the top ten accounts for bookkeepers.
Cash
All of a business’ transactions pass through this account, which is so important that there
are actually two journals used to track the transactions — the Cash Receipts Journal and the
Cash Disbursements Journal. I discuss these journals in Chapter 5. As the bookkeeper it is
your responsibility to be sure that all cash — whether it is coming into the business or being
sent out — is handled and recorded properly. 
Accounts Receivable
If your company sells its products or services to customers on store credit, then this account
becomes very critical. The Accounts Receivable account tracks all money due from cus-
tomers. As the bookkeeper, it’s critical to keep this account up-to-date. You want to be sure
that timely and accurate bills are sent to customers and that customers are paying their bills
on time. I talk more about the Accounts Receivable process in Chapter 8.
Inventory
Every company must have products to sell. Those money-making products must be carefully
accounted for and tracked. The bookkeeper helps with this process by keeping accurate
inventory records, which are periodically tested by doing physical counts of the inventory
on hand. Many stores will close their doors for a day to do a physical count of inventory. I
talk more about how to manage inventory in Chapter 7.

Accounts Payable
While no one likes to send money out of the business, tracking and paying bills in
Accounts Payable is critical. You certainly don’t want to pay anyone twice, but you
also want to be sure you do pay the bills on time or your company may no longer get
the supplies, inventory, or other things that are needed to operate the business. Late
paying companies are often cut off by suppliers or put on cash-only accounts, which
means you must pay cash to get any supplies. You also may be able to get discounts
and save money if you pay the bills early. I talk more about Accounts Payable in
Chapter 7.
Loans Payable
Every company needs to purchase major items, such as equipment, vehicles, and fur-
niture, but may not have the money to pay for it. Instead companies take long-term
loans that must be paid over more than a 12-month period. In order to get the best
rates for these loans, it’s critical that the bookkeeper make all loan payments on time
and accurately. I talk more about paying loans and interest due in Chapter 12.
Sales
No business can operate without taking in cash and most cash is taken in through the
sales of the company’s products or services. The Sales account tracks all incoming
revenue collected from these sales. It’s critical that the bookkeeper record sales in a
timely and accurate manner, so the business owner knows exactly how much revenue
has been collected every day. I talk more about sales in Chapter 8.
Purchases
Companies either manufacture the goods they sell or they purchase finished goods
from various suppliers. Even if the goods are manufactured in house, raw materials will
have to be purchased to make those goods. The Purchases account is used to track the
purchase of any finished goods or raw materials. The Purchases account is a key com-
ponent to calculating Cost of Goods Sold, which is subtracted from Sales to find out a
company’s gross profit. I talk more about the Purchases account in Chapter 7.
Payroll Expenses
You must pay employees to get them to stay around. Few people want to work for
nothing. You track all money paid to employees in the Payroll Expenses account. For
many businesses this can be their biggest expense. It’s important for the bookkeeper
to track these expenses accurately, but it’s also important that all governmental
reports are filed and payroll taxes are paid. I talk more about payroll obligations in
Chapters 9 and 10.
256
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Office Expenses
Another key expense that can drain a company’s profits are office expenses. This
includes paper, pens, paperclips, and any other supplies needed to run the office.
Expenses related to office machinery also fall under this account. These expenses
tend to creep up if not carefully monitored. I talk more about internal controls and
record keeping in Chapter 6, including controls that can be put in place involving
office expenses.
Owner’s Equity
Accounts related to owner’s equity will vary depending upon the type of business 
for which you keep the books. Many small businesses are owned by one person or 
a group of partners. They are not incorporated and therefore there are no shares of
stock that apportion ownership. Instead money put into the business by each of the
owners is tracked in Capital accounts. Any money taken out of the business will be
shown in Drawing accounts. In order to be fair to all owners, it’s critical that the book-
keeper carefully track all owner’s equity accounts. I talk more about business struc-
tures and types of ownership in Chapter 17.
Retained Earnings
Any profit made by the company that is reinvested for growing the company is called
retained earnings. These are earnings that are not paid out to company owners. This
account is cumulative, which means it shows the total of earnings that have been
retained since the company opened its doors. While it doesn’t take a lot of time for the
bookkeeper to manage this account, it’s ongoing accuracy is important to investors
and lenders who want to track how well the company is doing. I talk more about
retained earnings in Chapter 15.

Top Ten Problems You Should Practice 
In This Chapter

T
ake the time to be certain you’ve mastered the key concepts of bookkeeping by practic-
ing the problems related to these key bookkeeping concepts. This chapter highlights
the key bookkeeping functions you want to be sure you can understand and can do.
Identifying Accounts and Using 
Double-Entry Bookkeeping
You’ll find as a bookkeeper it is essential to enter transactions into the correct accounts, so
you need to practice identifying what types of transactions go into what types of accounts.
Plus, if you want to keep your books in balance, you must understand the basics of double-
entry bookkeeping. Spend some extra time on both of these concepts by working the prob-
lems in Chapter 2.
Keeping Journals
Every financial transaction for your business will need to be entered into journals. They are
the key day-to-day tracking tools for your company’s financial history. Review what journals
are and practice making journal entries in Chapter 5.
Paying Bills and Managing Inventory
If you don’t pay your creditors, vendors, and anyone else to whom your company owes
money, you won’t be in business for long. You also need to keep track of what you sell, how
many products you have on hand, and know how to value that inventory. You can better
manage your company’s outgoing cash and inventory by practicing these concepts in
Chapter 7.

Tracking Sales
Keeping track of money coming into the company is the fun part. Everyone enjoys
entering incoming cash. It’s what keeps the company on a good financial footing. Make
sure you know how to enter your company’s revenues by reviewing Chapter 8 and the
problems related to tracking revenues.
Testing Your Balance
After you’ve entered all you company’s transactions you need to be sure the books are
in balance (see Chapter 14). If they aren’t, the financial statements you generate based
on the data collected will be useless. And because any company’s lenders, vendors,
and owners want to know if the company finances are in balance, you need to also
know how to prepare a Balance Sheet (see Chapter 15). 
Reporting Income
Every business owner loves to see how much money he made. You make this possible
by pulling together the accounts related to income and expenses and preparing an
Income Statement (see Chapter 16). 
Closing the Books and Starting Over
At the end of every accounting cycle you need to close out the books and prepare
financial statements (see Chapter 13). And after closing out the books, you then have
to get ready for the next bookkeeping year. You can practice the key steps of preparing
for the next year by working the problems in Chapter 18.
