Preface
Preface
This book introduces the general strategy of design, the natural environmental cycles and how human 
activities interrupt and control them, toxicity and risk assessment for the protection of human and 
environmental health, the fate of pollutants in the environment, and a review of U.S. and international 
laws and regulations. Understanding these broad environmental issues leads to better engineering.
Put in more simple terms, it is about a very simple idea from Tom Chapin’s children’s song, ‘Someone’s 
Gonna Use It After You’, but the issue is not childish or trivial.
When you stand at the sink, did you ever think
About the water flowing down the drain?
…
Someone’s gonna use it after you.…
This lyric wonderfully captures the essence of the environmental ethic. Our actions can protect or destroy.
We are reminded of it daily. In the past few days the New York Times has reported that the daily average 
atmospheric carbon dioxide exceeded 400 ppm for the first time, and the High Plains aquifer is so 
depleted by water mining that farmers in Kansas face water shortages. More tragic is the report that 
diarrhea kills an estimated 900, 000 children each year, mostly because of just four microorganisms that 
can easily be inactivated in drinking water.
These problems are not really ‘news’. The warning signs have been evident for years. We know how to 
reduce carbon dioxide emissions. We know when aquifers are being over used. We know how to save 
lives by improving public health through clean water and better diet.
This book will be followed by four books about the design of pollution control processes and integrated 
systems that are widely used in water pollution control, air pollution control, and solid waste control.
Book 2 is about accounting for the flow of energy and material, both polluting and innocuous, through 
manufacturing and waste treatment systems.
Book 3 is about using chemical and biological reactions to destroy and transform pollutants to facilitate 
the separation of different materials, or to make substances safe for discharge to water, air or soil.

Preface
Book 4 is about the many ways to separate solids from liquids, solids from gases, solids from solids, and 
so on in all combinations. The solution of a problem is never stymied by lack of separation technology, 
but it may be weakened by failure to organize them into efficient processing systems, or to overlook an 
innovative combinations of transformation and separation.
Book 5 is about minimizing costs and comparing alternate designs. Engineering projects almost always 
have more than one feasible solution, and often there are several that are attractive. The options must 
be measured and compared by using an objective criteria like construction cost, lifetime cost, mass of 
pollutant discharged. Also discussed are methods for evaluating non-monetary aspects of projects.
The goal of the series is to build problem-solving strategies and skills that are widely useful in water 
pollution control, air pollution control, and solid waste control. We want to stimulate innovation in 
pollution control systems design and pollution prevention.
Pollution control engineers support the people who decide how public and private funds will be used 
to solve problems. They bring logic and order and solid quantitative information to the discussion so 
better decisions will be made. They design the machinery and structures and systems that are needed 
to make things better. And, they make sure the price will be right.
The ultimate goal of environmental engineering, and the part of it that we call pollution control 
engineering, is to increase the level of health and happiness in the world. We hope this series of books 
will help to do that.
Finally, we wish to thank Dale Rudd for many good ideas over many years, Erhard Joeres for his review 
of the book and A. ‘Sam’ James for help on water quality modeling.

Engineering
1.1	
Our Round River
Albert Einstein said that the environment was ‘everything that is not me’.
For ‘me’ to be healthy and happy, everything that is ‘not me’ must be healthy and happy. That includes 
an environment that is in a healthy balance between the demands of 7 billion people and the natural 
cycles of essential nutrients, and one that is safe from hazardous substances.
Aldo Leopold (1949, 1993) viewed our activities in terms of Paul Bunyan’s Round River, which is part 
of the folklore of the early logging days. Paul discovered in Northern Wisconsin a river that flowed into 
itself, with no source and no mouth, a round river.
The earth is our round river, and we ride on the logs that float down it. The technique of birling is called 
economics, remembering old routes is called history, the selection of new routes is statesmanship, and 
the conversation about oncoming rapids and riffles is called politics.

The Strategy of Pollution Control Engineering
The study of the soils, flora, and fauna that comprise the channels of the river is biology, and their origin 
through time is called geology and evolution, and the techniques of using them are called agriculture 
and engineering. Ecology is the lore of the round river, the study of biotic navigation.
We must disturb the environment as we draw from it food, water, shelter, clothing, energy, and all of 
our material needs, and as we dispose into it our wastes. Our disturbances must be planned carefully 
to avoid unnecessary damage.
This book is concerned with understanding the interactions of man and the environment and with 
maintaining balance in the natural systems that buffer those interactions. The goal is to promote health 
and happiness. The difficulty for engineers, who like to measure and quantify outputs, is that there is 
no metric for measuring happiness, and not very precise ones for measuring healthiness. The things we 
can count and measure are at the bottom of the hierarchy of goals shown in Figure 1.1.
This book, more specifically, is about the right-hand column of Figure 1.1. We know that clean air 
and clear water are essential for good health. We know that, at times, having excellent air and water 
quality may seem to be in conflict with having a high level of agricultural and industrial outputs. It is 
not necessary for one to give way to the other, but careful quantitative analysis is needed or there will 
be mistakes and inefficiencies. This book is about scientific and engineering methods that inform and 
support good policy and wise investment.

A Preview of This Book
Chapter 2 is an introduction to pollution prevention and control engineering. The subjects introduced 
there will be developed in detail in subsequent books. The immediate goal is to explain the scope of 
pollution prevention and control engineering.
Chapter 3 describes the intricate natural cycles that move the stuff of life (water, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, 
phosphorus, and sulfur) between air, water, and soil, and between plants and animals, and between 
creation and death. These essential elements are linked by the water cycle, so water resources also must 
be protected and maintained in balance. These essential elements may themselves become pollutants, as 
when phosphorus fertilizer is carried into a lake where it stimulates a massive bloom of algae.
Toxicology and risk assessment are discussed in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. Toxic and otherwise harmful 
substances must be identified and criteria for emissions and effluents must be established that incorporate 
all that is known about their toxic effects.
The emission and effluent limits should take into account the fate of pollutants. Some are highly toxic 
even in minute amounts; some are ugly but not dangerous. Some persist for long periods of time; some 
rapidly dissipate. Will they accumulate in soil or in animal tissue? Do toxic chemicals degrade into forms 
that are innocuous? These issues are discussed in Chapter 7, 8 and 9.
Chapter 10 is about international and U.S. laws and regulations. The laws, rules and regulations must 
be fair and consistent. They must set forth clearly what is expected and what is acceptable, and also 
what are the penalties if expectations and requirements are not fulfilled. They should derive from the 
most complete possible understanding of the natural cycles, toxicology, and the fate of pollutants. Risk 
assessment should be part of the process. Economic considerations are not involved in most laws.
This is the first of five books about pollution prevention and control. This first, as should be evident 
from the description above, is mostly about goals and requirements. Creating engineering designs to 
accomplish those goals is the subject of the subsequent books. These are described starting in Section 
1.4, after a brief discussion of some fundamental ideas about pollution control.
1.3	
The Fallacy of Zero Emissions
Why not require every industry to emit nothing other than the goods it manufactures? This would 
protect the environment and public health would be guaranteed.
Zero emissions from a human would mean that we could not expire carbon dioxide from the lungs, 
rid ourselves of salts, or excrete food residues. The result would be death. Likewise, an industry or a 
community has certain needs for economic health and growth and cannot survive on a zero emission 
policy.

The Strategy of Pollution Control Engineering
Figure 1.2 shows the daily metabolism of a hypothetical city with a population of 1,000,000 in 1965. 
This comes from the classic work of Abel Wolman (1965), an old but interesting reference because it 
was the first to recognize of the metabolism of a city, a concept that today is relevant to the concept of 
sustainability.
It is interesting, as well, because the world population today is more than double the population in 1965 
when Wolman published his book, about 3.3 billion in 1965 and 7.0 billion in 2012. The 1965 population 
of the U.S. was 194.3 million; today it is 349 million. Worldwide, there are 476 city areas with more 
than 1,000,000 people, 63 with more than 5,000,000, and 26 with a population more than 10,000,000.

The Strategy of Pollution Control Engineering
The only way the chemical industry shown in Figure 1.3 could avoid creating waste would be if the raw 
material inputs were free of impurities, the synthesis chemistry required no excess reactant to drive 
the reaction and produced no unwanted by-products, and the process operated at ambient conditions 
of temperature and pressure. In some amount, materials other than product, pure water, and pure air 
must leave the system. The choice is not whether to discharge waste, but what form and volume shall 
be discharged and at what pollutant concentrations. Some industries do have a goal of zero discharge 
of toxic substances.
The following practical definitions of ‘zero discharge’ accept that zero mass of all liquid, gaseous, and 
solid outputs emissions is impossible.
•	 Eliminate priority pollutants or toxic substances from the wastewater effluent. Eliminate 
toxic air pollutants from gaseous emissions. Eliminate recyclable and hazardous materials 
from solid waste landfills.
•	 Discharge no water effluent stream from the processing site. All wastewater, after treatment, 
is recycled and reused.
•	 Discharge no material that will do harm in the receiving environment.
•	 Minimize the volume of slurries and sludges.

The Strategy of Pollution Control Engineering
Asking questions such as these stimulates useful design questions:
•	 What raw materials are brought into the waste generating system?
•	 How much of each raw material leaves in useful products and how much is lost as waste?
•	 What are the waste streams?
•	 Where are the wastes generated?
•	 Which wastes are hazardous and which are not?
•	 Are potentially reusable materials being contaminated and degraded?
•	 Can the process be changed to eliminate a troublesome material?
•	 Can material be handled differently to reduce losses?
•	 Can the material be handled at a temperature more conducive to fume or dust suppression?
•	 Can process efficiency be improved with better instrumentation or control strategies?
•	 Can housekeeping practices be modified to limit waste production?
Recycling, like all other pollution control processes, operates under the fallacy of zero emissions. 
Collecting the discarded material and transporting it to a recycling center generates air pollutants. 
Recycled paper must be cleaned to remove ink, paper clips, staples, stamps, and other materials. The 
cleaning consumes fuel, chemicals, and water and creates waste. A paper recycling process reclaims 
only two-thirds of the fiber input. A three-ton input yields two tons of reclaimed fiber and two-tons of 
sludge. The sludge is the one-ton of lost fiber plus one ton of water. The result is one ton of sludge waste 
for each ton of reclaimed fiber.
Waste treatment itself produces emissions. Burning an unwanted by-product to produce energy creates 
exhaust gas that contains air pollutants. Capturing dust from the exhaust gas will produce a solid waste; 
absorbing gaseous pollutants into a liquid creates a new stream of wastewater. Achieving zero discharge 
of water-born pollutants will leave some pollutants to be discharged as a gas, sludge, or solid.
1.4	
The Integration of Pollution Control
There are a few basic engineering principles that apply to all pollutant materials, whether the origin 
is municipal, industrial, or natural; whether the form is a liquid, gas, or solid; whether the discharge 
contains a single pollutant or a mixture, and also whether the material is toxic, non-toxic, reactive, or 
non-reactive. These principles can be used to solve problems with air pollution, municipal and industrial 
water pollution, soil pollution, groundwater pollution, and so on.
The goal of this series of books is to apply these principles to all sorts of pollutants and pollution control 
problems. We believe this will develop problem-solving skills better than the traditional course that 
compartmentalizes air pollution, water pollution, and solid wastes. Seeing problems this way is essential 
because real problems very often co-mingle issues with air, water and solids and cross boundaries 
between categories.

The Strategy of Pollution Control Engineering
Dealing with polluted water may create gaseous emissions or solid residues that are part of the same 
problem. Contaminated groundwater can be pumped and cleaned of a solvent without making it safe for 
discharge to a stream, and the solvent will still exist in some form, perhaps as a gas or adsorbed onto a 
solid. A solid waste disposal problem, even one that is relatively straightforward like putting municipal 
refuse into a sanitary landfill, will produce a strong leachate and gas, both of which need to be collected 
and subjected to further management.
The strategy of pollution control is about engineering concepts that are widely useful in water pollution 
control, air pollution control, and solid waste management. It is about separating, transforming, and 
destroying molecules and compounds, and about the catalog of process technology that can be organized 
into systems that will convert a worthless mixture of materials into something of value (clean water, 
reusable aluminum, etc.) Selecting the processing technology and organizing it into feasible processing 
systems requires some engineering design strategy.
This will be done in a collection of five books. This one, the first, deals with how pollutants are regulated, 
which specific chemicals and compounds are restricted and why, how the natural system responds to 
pollutants, and the analysis of risk to organisms presented by toxic chemicals. This information is useful 
because many projects are driven by government rules and regulations. This information, however, is 
not essential to understanding the more technical material in the subsequent volumes.
Book 2 is about the two most important engineering design tools – the material balance and the energy 
balance. These are the basis for all process invention and design. This is how we account for what is 
known and estimate what is unknown. This is how we understand existing systems and how we analyze 
systems that exist only in our imagination. Figure 1.4 shows an accounting for a simple system.

The Strategy of Pollution Control Engineering
Book 3 is about chemical and biological transformations that convert harmful substances into innocuous 
substances, useless materials to useful ones, make low value materials valuable, and make substances 
easier to remove from a gaseous or liquid stream. A second aspect is to make manufacturing more 
environmentally friendly. Most reactions yield a mixture of materials that that must be concentrated or 
separated and this means that the reactors must be integrated with separation technology.
Book 4 is about separation technology. Especially important separations are those that can separate 
harmful from harmless substances, and useless from useful materials. The design of separation systems 
is a playground for inventive engineers.
Separating materials is possible whenever they differ in size, density, ionic charge, solubility, or some other 
property. Each separation stage divides the feed stream into two output streams, one that is enriched 
with respect to a resource or a pollutant, and one that is depleted. Either of these outputs may need 
further processing before it is suitable for discharge to the environment, or it becomes a useful product. 
Figure 1.5 shows a generic separation of a solid from air. There are many ways to do this, as shown in 
Table 1.1, which is a catalog of methods for separating solids from liquids, solids from gases, gases from 
gases, liquids from liquids, and solids from solids.

Table 1.1 Separation processes can be combined into hundreds of different pollution control systems and manufacturing processes.
Book 5 is about special tools for evaluating and comparing alternative solutions. Real problems have 
more than one possible solution. Identifying the solution to implement is another kind of separation 
problem – a separation of alternatives based on differences in some measure of their effectiveness, such 
as construction cost, lifetime cost, mass of pollutant discharged, labor requirements, amount of pollutant 
destroyed or recovered, chemical used, or energy consumption.
Often an evaluation scheme is needed that includes intangible and incommensurate factors such 
as improvement in public health, nuisance to neighboring properties, public acceptance, physical 
attractiveness, and so on. There is usually not one alternate that dominates in terms of all of these so 
some weighting of relative importance may be needed. This is cost-effectiveness analysis.

The Strategy of Pollution Control Engineering
1.5	
An Integrated Approach to Design
The big problem – the real problem – comprises a variety of sub-problems. The design of a car wheel 
means that someone must design a hydraulic brake line, a brake shoe, a tire and a valve stem, a rim and 
lug nuts, a wheel cover, a shock absorber, and so on. Each sub-problem must be solved correctly, and 
not all the sub-problems are easy to solve. And the parts must be integrated into a reliable working unit.
A pollution control system is designed by solving a sequence of sub-problems. Each chemical 
transformation and each separation is a sub-problem and within each of these problems are others like 
heating the process, supplying it with air, controlling the pH, removing solids that have been collected 
from air or water, and so on.
All of this is done with the understanding that everything entering the system must leave, in one form 
or another. The same is true for everything entering a single process. It will leave to the environment 
(air, water, or land) if it has been made safe and innocuous. Or it will go into another processing step 
to make it more suitable for release. This linking of process to process, and system to environment, is 
process integration.

The Strategy of Pollution Control Engineering
Figure 1.6a shows a simple integration of three separation processes. The processes work together, but 
they are linked in the simplest way possible, without recycle or cross-connection.
Each process divides one input stream into two output streams, one that is enriched with respect to the 
input and one that is depleted. The designer must dispose of both output streams. If one output (or both) 
needs more processing it can be economical to recycle instead of increasing the number of processes in 
series, as in Figure 1.6b.

Figure 1.8 The arrangement of processes is identical to Figure 1.7, but naming the processes reveals a commonly used scheme 
for treating municipal wastewater. The three transformations are all done biologically. The boxes all represent physical 
separations of solids and water. Separations of gases from liquid are shown with arrows.
The most common integration is separations with chemical or biological transformation. Figure 1.7 
shows a generic integrated system and Figure 1.8 shows the same system with the names of the treatment 
processes in a conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant.
1.6	
The Integrated Approach to Learning Pollution Control Engineering
Many textbooks compartmentalize pollution control according to air pollution, municipal wastewater, 
industrial wastewater, solid wastes, hazardous wastes, etc. Air pollution control is considered as somehow 
separate from water pollution control and from solid waste control. This may happen in part because 
the laws are compartmentalized and regulatory agencies tend to be as well.
An integrated approach to air pollution control, for example, considers the interaction of efforts applied 
to treat and dispose of solid wastes and polluted water and gaseous emissions. The treatment and 
management of gaseous, liquid, and solid materials must be coordinated so problems are not shifted 
from one environmental sector (air, land, water) to another.
This integration and coordination leads to the effective use of both proactive and reactive pollution 
control measures. Proactive measures include source reduction, recycling, and the other strategies of 
pollution prevention. Reactive measures are traditional practices of collection and treatment at the end-
of-pipe, stack, or landfill.
Real problems are multi-pollutant and multi-faceted. Good engineers know that holding a narrow view 
of problems or prescriptions of solutions is anathema to creative design. Creative design is better and 
it is more fun.

The Engineering Design Process
2	 The Engineering Design Process
2.1	
Defining the Design Problem
The systematic solution of an engineering problem follows a logical process that is not a bit different from 
that which everyone should follow in conscious everyday reasoning. It does differ, however, from making 
a casual judgment that lacks a thorough and impartial pursuit of fact and data. Casual decisions are 
distinguished from engineering decisions largely by the clarity with which hypotheses and assumptions 
are stated, by the careful collection and use of factual information, and by adherence to the implications 
of the conclusions that have been critically tested.
A problem is a difficulty that needs to be resolved. It is an opportunity in work clothes. It is an opportunity 
to make someone happier, healthier, wealthier, or wiser. New, better, more efficient, and less expensive 
systems come from recognizing a need or opportunity to make the current situation better.
A clear definition of the problem is essential. What exactly is the problem? Is more effort required, or 
just more resources? What are the best sources of information about the problem, and about possible 
solutions? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the available information (statistics, case studies, and 
anecdotes)? These questions are how we start to identify better ways of doing design and management.
Here is a hypothetical conversation between a plant manager (M) and a pollution control engineer (E) 
when a printing plant receives notice from the State EPA that Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) 
emissions exceed the allowable limits.
M	
We are emitting more volatile organic compounds (VOCs) than allowed by the Clean 
Air Act. If we are not in compliance in 90 days our company will be hit with huge fines 
and unfavorable publicity. We want to be in compliance. If the cost is reasonable, we 
prefer to be well under the statutory limits for emissions.
E	
A variety of technology exists to solve the problem. There will be several workable 
technical solutions. The net cost will depend upon the kind and quantity of the solvents 
being emitted and whether they can be recovered and reused as solvents or as fuel.
M 	
A variety of solvents are used, but the largest volume is toluene. We can tell you the total 
losses of each solvent that is used in the plant. We can tell you which printing processes, 
and which cleanup operations use the chemicals. We can tell you which printing presses 
emit which solvent, and when they have been operated. Is that the information you 
need?

25 
The Engineering Design Process
E  	
It is. That will give us estimates of the average and maximum emissions for each solvent 
type and how much of each must be removed to meet the new standards. Next we identify 
useful technologies and make some preliminary cost estimates. And a very interesting 
part is when we look at the cost of solvents lost and the value that might be recovered. 
With some luck – or should I say good engineering – the project will save you money 
after the first year or two.  
M  	
I understand how that could happen. We use a lot of solvent, and lose a lot, and the 
price per kilogram is quite high. The net effect of solvent recovery is like using less and 
losing less. 
E	
Many companies have done so. If the polluted air stream contains a single solvent, we 
may be able to capture it, concentrate it, and recycle it to the printing process. We can do 
this with adsorption, onto resins or activated carbon. Or, we can do it with a membrane 
process, for example, pervaporation.
M  	
What if the emissions cannot be adsorbed? Or if they are a mixture of solvents, which 
would make recycle and reuse problematic?
E 	
If the exhaust air contains a mixture of solvents, we might separate them at the source. 
If the concentrations are too low for economic separation and recovery, we may be able 
to use incineration and recover heat instead of solvent. 
M	
The technology – adsorption, membranes, and incineration – must be expensive.
E	
The pollution control equipment may cost a lot of money. Whatever it costs, non-
compliance with the Clean Air Act will cost more. Non-compliance is not an option. 
M	
True. It’s necessary, but still, it will be expensive.  
E	
‘Expensive’ is a pseudo-technical word that carries a lot of emotion. The person who 
says “expensive” and the person who hears “expensive” may have quite different ideas. 
We will have alternate technical solutions. Some will cost more than others to build, 
and the same is true for operating costs. Let’s get the costs. What is the net annual cost? 
What is the net cash flow, year by year? What is the payback period? 
M	
I agree. That’s how we evaluate the manufacturing operations. If say, ’We had a good 
day.’ my boss will want to know what ‘good’ means in terms of product shipped, project 
rejected, materials used, manpower, and quality control data. Let’s get the data and solve 
this problem.

The Engineering Design Process
Alternate ways of meeting the emission standards by making process modifications and installing new 
pollution control equipment were worked out. The capital cost, operating cost, and net life-cycle cost of 
the alternate solutions were compared.
Our hypothetical design engineer might have submitted a memo that said something like: One alternative 
is to install a still to recover the waste solvent. The still bottoms will be a hazardous waste and there will 
be a cost for disposal. The payback period is 2 to 3 years. Option 2 is to burn the solvents and recover 
heat energy, which is needed in winter but not in summer. The payback period is 2 to 3 years.
Each possible solution will have pros and cons, and plant management will select one. They may prefer 
a solution with a high operating cost and a low construction cost over one that costs more to build and 
less to operate. These are financial decisions, and they depend on interest rates, company debt, and 
competition for money among possible company investments.
The severity of a problem is not by itself sufficient reason to give it high priority. We also need to be 
convinced that it can be solved. Distinguish between problems that are insuperable given current 
resources, technologies, and knowledge; and those that are capable of solution if approached in the 
correct way. Reserve the word ‘problem’ for those conditions that have a detrimental effect on quality 
of life, but which are believed capable of being modified in beneficial ways.
Good problem formulation is the key to success. It is to a large degree an art that is learned through 
practice and study of successful applications. Beware of problems that are stated in pseudo-technical 
language, for example “use the smallest number of units that is feasible.” Small and feasible convey no 
precise information. They may start a useful conversation, but a more precise definition will be needed 
to avoid confusion and misunderstanding.
A solution is a prescribed intervention that will: (1) produce better information, (2) apply better physical 
technology, (3) improve analytical techniques, (4) modify management styles, (5) reduce the cost, or 
(6) accomplish more than one of these objectives. In most problems a set of possible prescriptions is 
written and the designer endeavors to select the best.
We strive to formulate alternative solutions and judge them with respect to some measure of system 
performance. There is considerable choice in defining such a criterion: total capital cost, annual cost, 
annual net profit, return on investment, cost-benefit ratio, or net present worth. Or, the measure might 
be stated in terms of technological factors, like minimum production time, maximum production rate, 
minimum energy utilization, minimum weight, and so on. In practical situations it may be desirable to find 
a solution that is good with respect to more than one criterion (for example, a design that simultaneously 
minimizes cost while also increasing reliability and reducing energy use). Evaluating multiple competing 
objectives is possible when judgment and experience complement mathematical solutions.

Identifying the Alternatives
Identifying alternatives combines imagination with engineering savvy. If ideas are constrained there 
is a risk of prematurely rejecting promising solutions. Constraints imposed at the formative stage too 
often are imaginary. Avoid judgments like “it is too expensive” or “it is too complex” and let subsequent 
analysis select the alternatives that need to be studied in more detail.

Voluntary Pollution Prevention by Industry
Pollution Prevention, Clean Manufacturing, Green Manufacturing, Waste Minimization, Design for 
Environment, are popular terms in recent years. Whatever name is used, the goal is to simplify and 
reduce the cost of compliance with environmental regulations.
The names are new, but the ideas are not. As far back as the 1940s, energy conservation, water conservation, 
water reuse, material substitution, reclamation and recycling were practiced, mainly for economic reasons. 
The motivation to implement these ideas has increased as environmental regulations become more strict 
and the costs of water, fuel and electricity increase.
Clean manufacturing is based on the idea that an unsafe material cannot be accidentally released if it 
was never created. You cannot emit or spill what you never had. It is better not to create a pollutant 
than to capture and treat one. The principle applies equally to gaseous, liquid, and solid waste materials.
An impressive voluntary initiative to reduce pollution in the U.S. was the 33/50 program that targeted 
the toxic chemicals listed in Figure 2.3. The goal was a 33% reduction in releases and transfer of these 
chemicals by 1992 and a 50% reduction by 1995, as measured against a 1988 baseline.

Designing for Pollution Prevention
The conceptual design phase is when creativity and technical analysis can come together to conserve 
energy and water, to reduce and eliminate waste, and be most effective in pollution prevention. The yin 
and yang – the complementary parts that comprise this philosophy – are:
Waste is eliminated at the drawing board.
Waste is generated at the drawing board.
The Product Stewardship Code of the Chemical Manufacturing Association says that a goal is ‘…to make 
health, safety and environmental protection an integral part of designing, manufacturing, marketing, 
and distributing, using, recycling and disposing of [chemical] products.’ Figure 2.4 shows the life cycle 
of a manufactured product. There are opportunities for waste minimization and energy conservation at 
each stage, including final disposition. This philosophy extends to manufacturing products that are easy 
to dismantle at the end of their useful life so parts and materials can be recycled.

The Engineering Design Process
Useful steps are to
•	 Eliminate the source. Don’t build a pollutant-generating factory. Shut down the offending 
process.
•	 Modify the source so that released materials are less in quantity and of a less harmful nature.
•	 Capture emitted materials for recycle, secondary use, or sale.
Figure 2.5 shows some waste minimization strategies. Raw material substitution, product reformulation, 
process modification, improved housekeeping, and on-site recycling are intimately linked to the 
manufacturing process and making changes may not be easy even if good ideas seem plentiful.

Figure 2.6 shows why pollution prevention might be needed in a chemical manufacturing process. An 
ideal chemical process would fully incorporate the reactants into to product. There is no waste. This is 
a ‘clean’ or ‘green’ reaction. This is the goal of Green Chemistry.

The Engineering Design Process
Real reactions produce a mixture of product, excess reactant, impurities in the reactants, and by-products. 
Additional processing must be added to separate the product from the impurity and the by-product. 
Solvents, chemicals and energy may be needed to drive the separation. The separated materials may be 
voluminous, difficult to handle, or toxic. Clearly it is best to avoid separations when possible.
2.6	
Savings from Pollution Prevention
Many kinds of equipment, treatment processes, and entire treatment systems have cost functions of the 
form
C = KQM
where C is the cost, Q is the design capacity, K the cost when Q = 1, and M is an exponent that indicates 
the economy-of-scale. Typical values are M = 0.5-0.9, with values of 0.6-0.7 being common.

does not double the cost. For M = 0.7, doubling the capacity increases the construction cost by 62%. 
This also means that halving the design capacity will reduce the cost by 38%.

Figure 2.7 Economy-of-scale cost function used for 
making preliminary cost estimates. This curve is for a 
hypothetical machine that is used for pollution control. 
C = $10,000Q0.7 where Q = design capacity (volume, area, 
flow rate, etc.)
Here is a simple example of how pollution prevention could reduce the cost of a project. The purchase 
price shown in Figure 2.7 is C = 10,000Q0.7. The installed cost of the equipment will be approximately 
4 times the purchase price.
Suppose the original design capacity was 4 units of flow at a cost of $91,000, but some clever design 
at the source could reduce the flow to 3 units. This would reduce the equipment cost from $91,000 to 
$74,500, a savings of $16,500. (The costs are rounded because estimates of this kind have an error of 
10% to 30%.) Reducing the flow from 4 units to 1 unit would save $56,500, or 65%. The installation cost 
is also reduced, so is the cost of operating and maintaining the smaller equipment.
2.7	
Selecting the Best Design
Real problems have more than one feasible solution. They will differ in construction cost, operating 
cost, ease of maintenance, flexibility of operation, robustness to shifts in ambient conditions, changes in 
loading rates, the amount of chemicals used, and amount of solid waste and sludge that must be hauled 
away. No single alternate will be the most desirable with respect all these factors.
Cost effectiveness analysis tries to consider more than just cost. Figure 2.8 shows the essence of the 
analysis. Alternate E can be dropped as a serious contender. Alternate B has the lowest cost and is more 
effective than A, but less effective than C. There is some overlap, at least in the preliminary design analysis, 
and more work needs to be done.

Conclusion
Design is not just the preparation of detailed drawings and specifications. Important design decisions 
are made long before these documents are prepared.
In some projects there are no drawings at all. The design may be a better way of financing bonds, a new 
way of scheduling waste hauling, or improved maintenance of a pump.
Project design is a series of activities in which the amount of information about the process grows 
and more details become fixed. The early design stages involve broad concepts; the last stages involve 
thousands of intricate details. The early stages offer the greatest opportunity for pollution prevention – 
Waste is eliminated at the drawing board. Once detailed design begins it is virtually impossible to go 
back and make major changes in the processing concept.

3.1	
Environmental Cycles and Environmental Stability
The environment operates in a state of dynamic equilibrium. Water evaporates from the surface of the 
earth and the oceans, leaving behind salts and silt. Precipitation renews the fresh water reservoirs. The 
essential compounds of life contain carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen that cycle between organic 
and inorganic forms. Some of these compounds are water-soluble and travel with streams or groundwater; 
some are volatile and move into the atmosphere to be returned to earth by precipitation, photosynthesis, 
or nitrogen fixation. When these pathways and cycles are disturbed, life patterns are interrupted.
Many problems arise from the exceptional reactivity of the six elements that are the stuff of life: hydrogen 
(H), carbon (C), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S). These are the building blocks 
of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, and water can exist as soluble and as volatile forms, and 
have a full cycle of movement between the atmosphere, the water, and the land. Phosphorus is soluble, 
but lacks a volatile form, so it moves between the land and water.

The Environmental System
So long as these cycles are stable, environmental conditions are stable, but they can be interrupted or 
overloaded by the activities that keep 7,000,000,000 people alive on this small planet. Burning coal and 
oil overloads the carbon dioxide reservoir in the atmosphere. The heavy use of phosphate and animal 
wastes as fertilizer overloads the phosphorus balance in lakes, reservoirs, and rivers and causes excessive 
growth of algae and aquatic plants. The instability can be magnified because the cycles are linked. The 
carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycles are linked to the oxygen cycle, and all are linked 
to via the water cycle.
3.2	
The Water Cycle
The water cycle, driven by the sun’s energy, provides continual regeneration of fresh water by evaporation 
from land and sea. Snow and rain condense from this evaporated water. Figure 3.1 shows the major 
movements of water through the natural environment. Preserving the integrity of this hydrologic cycle 
is a central problem in environmental protection.

Figure 3.1 The water cycle, or hydrologic cycle.
Figure 3.2 shows that 99% of all water on earth is not directly available for human use. About 97% of 
the total is saline (oceans). Almost 68.7% of the fresh water on earth exists as ice in glaciers and icecaps 
and 30.1% is groundwater. That leaves 0.9% of the total as surface water. Of this small fraction, only 
2% is in rivers, 87% is in lakes, and 11% is in swamps. Almost one-quarter of the world’s population, 
1.7 billion people, lives in regions where groundwater is being used up faster than it can be replenished 
(Gleeson 2012, Pearce 2006).
In the United States, 0.6 percent of the annual rainfall is withdrawn for use in municipal water supplies, 
and only five percent of that is used for drinking or in the preparation of food. Within the household, 
about 35% of water is used for showers and baths, 30% for toilet flushing, 20% for laundry, 10% for 
kitchen and drinking, and 5% for cleaning.

Figure 3.2 Distribution of the earth’s water (adapted from U.S Geological Society).
Water consumption in some developing countries may average as little as 15 L/d per capita. The world 
average is estimated to be 60 L/d per capita. The average in the U.S. is 360 L/d per capita (100 gal/cap-d) 
for household use. Overall, including commercial and industrial uses, the average is about 680 L/cap-d 
(180 gal/cap-d).
The design of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in the U.S. is typically based on an average daily 
base flow of 270 to 380 L/day per capita (70–100 gal/day per capita) plus the flow from industry and other 
non-residential sources, plus stormwater that may enter the wastewater collection system. A multiplier 
of 2.0 to 2.5 is used to estimate the peak flow. These design flows are applied to an estimated population 
20 years in the future (Vesilind 1998).
The industrial water cycle, shown by Figures 3.3 and 3.4, takes in clean water, uses and reuses it, and 
discharges wastewater. Water from a river, lake, or well usually must be treated before use in boilers, 
condensers, manufactured product formulation, or washing. Wastewater is treated for reuse or discharge.

water and stormwater. This diagram, for simplicity, shows all wastewater going into a common drain. 
Better practice is to segregate (i.e. collect separately) different kinds of wastewater. For example, do not 
mix unpolluted water with polluted water.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Figure 3.4 The Industrial Water Cycle. Industries run on water and energy as much as on raw materials used in the actual 
manufacturing. Water for the formulation and refinement of the product is supplied from plant utilities, which also supplies 
boilers and cooling towers. Wastewater streams include blowdown from boilers and cooling towers, scrubbers, and waste 
from manufacturing, including washwater. Water treatment and wastewater treatment produce sludge. There may also 
be solid wastes (not shown) from manufacturing. Waste treatment may be done off-site at a municipal treatment plant, 
but on-site treatment will offer more opportunities to recycle water.
An important use of water in industry is cooling. Cooling water may be used once and discharged, but 
recirculation and reuse is more common. Figure 3.5 shows a recirculating cooling water system. The 
cooling is caused by evaporation of a small amount (1–2%) of the circulating water.
One hundred percent closed-loop recirculation is not possible even in a system as simple as a cooling 
water loop. The water contains natural dissolved minerals and more chemicals are added to prevent 
scaling and corrosion in the cooling system. The salt concentration increases as water evaporates and this 
limits the number of times the water can be recycled. Removing some of the saline water and replacing 
it with fresh water controls the salt concentration. The freshwater addition is called make-up water. The 
water that is removed, called blowdown, must be discharged to a sewer or treated before discharge.

The Natural Carbon Cycle
Living organisms synthesize carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen into carbohydrates, fats and proteins. 
Some organisms consume oxygen to do this, and some function without oxygen (O2). Green plants 
consume carbon dioxide (CO2) and produce oxygen. When living organisms die, cellular components are 
decomposed by microorganisms into smaller and simpler compounds. The decomposed compounds may 
be mineralized to carbon dioxide and water, or to organic compounds such as methane or acetic acid.
Oxygen and carbon are inextricably linked through the carbon cycle, as shown in Figure 3.6. Carbon, 
hydrogen and oxygen can exist as dissolved and gaseous compounds. Large quantities of carbon dioxide 
are held in the aquatic reservoir (mainly the ocean) and this CO2 interacts and exchanges continually 
with the atmosphere.
The amount of carbon dioxide stored in the ocean is more than fifty times the amount stored in the 
atmosphere. Carbon is removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis and returned by respiration, 
mainly by bacteria and fungi that decompose organic matter, and in lesser amounts are returned by the 
combustion of coal, wood, and petroleum. The respiration of plant and animal life releases much smaller 
amounts of carbon dioxide.

One of the important reactions in the carbon cycle is a classical cause of water pollution. Lakes and rivers 
absorb oxygen from the atmosphere while microorganisms simultaneously consume dissolved oxygen 
and organic carbon from the water. When food (carbon) is plentiful, oxygen is consumed faster than it 
can be replaced from the atmosphere. This reduces the dissolved oxygen (DO) and can endanger fish 
and other desirable aquatic organisms.

The Environmental System
Reducing organic carbon in wastewater effluents is a keystone of water pollution control. The same 
biological reactions that occur in a river are used to advantage when they are accelerated in a biological 
wastewater treatment process. George Box (2013), an eminent statistician and scientist, who worked 
as a chemist in a wastewater treatment plant when he was nineteen years old, described this process.
‘Clean water is essential to life, but there is only a certain amount of water in the world, and this must 
be used and reused. Nature has provided a means for this cleansing to be done. It is achieved by aerobic 
microorganisms that exist in every body of water that is exposed to air. About ten parts per million of 
oxygen can dissolve in perfectly clean water, and if you check, you’ll find that some quantity slightly 
less is to be found in streams, rivers, and oceans. Every natural body of water is to some extent slightly 
polluted. The pollutants provide aerobic organisms with nutrients, which they absorb at the expense of 
slightly lowering the level of dissolved oxygen. This sets up a tension, and as more oxygen is needed, 
more is dissolved, so that we have a permanent system for cleaning up the water supply on the planet. 
The aerobic organisms are quite remarkable; in a matter of a few hours, they can clean up even raw 
sewage in the activated sludge process, employed in almost every town throughout the industrial world 
(used with the kind permission of John Wiley & Sons).
3.4	
The Industrial Carbon Cycle
The industrial counterpart of the decomposer cycle is the use of fossil fuels for heating, power generation, 
and in vehicles. The producer analogy is the use of oil and gas as raw materials in the chemical process 
industries. Many chemicals that consist only of carbon and hydrogen are manufactured in huge quantities. 
For example, in 2010 the U.S. produced about 6,000 metric tons of benzene (C6H6).
The carbon cycle is at the heart of discussions about the environment in the 21st century because of 
the increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is a green house gas. Scientists 
understood that carbon dioxide, as well as methane and a few other gases, act to retain heat within the 
earth’s atmosphere long before global warming became a critical issue.
Another fact is that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has been increasing. The level today has 
reached 400 parts per million by volume (ppmv) and is increasing by about 2.5 ppmv per year. (400 ppmv 
measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in May 2013.) Antarctic ice core measurements indicate that 
atmospheric CO2 levels were 260–280 ppmv in the 10,000 years before industrial emissions increased. 
This is shown in Figure 3.7.

Figure 3.7 Global annual average temperature (as measured over land and 
oceans). The curve shows the historic levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide 
(CO2), measured in ppmv. The horizontal line is the average temperature for 
the period 1901-2000. The bars indicate temperature deviations above and 
below the average temperature. The year-to-year fluctuations in temperature 
are due to natural processes, such as the effects of El Niños, La Niñas, and the 
eruption of large volcanoes. (Karl et al. 2011)
Burning coal, petroleum and natural gas emits roughly 7.5 billion metric tons of carbon per year. The 
U.S. emissions are 29 tons/person (in 2006), which adds up to about 22% of the world total emissions. 
This closely follows China, the current leader in CO2 emissions (Wikipedia).
The magnitude and rate of future change, though not exactly known, are expected to increase on this 
worrisome trend. Managing greenhouse gas emissions is an important world issue that has, so far, been 
resisted by the United States government.

Essential Nutrients
Table 3.1 shows elements that are essential to life. The first six elements in the table, C, H, O, N, P, and 
S make up almost all the mass of living matter. The most important nutrients in environmental systems 
are nitrogen and phosphorus, and to a lesser extent sulfur. These exist as organic or inorganic chemicals.
A second group (iron through iodine) is essential for building and maintaining healthy bone, blood, 
and electrolytes.
The metals (silicon through zinc) have three functional levels. They are essential in low doses, but the 
amount can get below the level needed for healthy life, and at high doses they become toxic.

The Nitrogen Cycle
Figure 3.8 shows the Nitrogen Cycle. The organic forms of nitrogen are protein and urea. These decompose 
to ammonia (NH3), which in turn can be converted to nitrite (NO2
-) and to nitrate (NO3
-). Nitrate can be 
converted to nitrogen gas (N2) and returned to the atmosphere. Gaseous nitrogen can be used directly by 
legumes (e.g. soy beans) and certain algae. Commercial nitrogen fertilizer is made from gaseous nitrogen. 
Thus, nitrogen cycles between reservoirs in the atmosphere, living and decomposing biota, soil, and water.

oxygen, nitrifying bacteria will convert ammonia to nitrite and to nitrate (NO2
-) and then 
nitrate to nitrate (NO3
-). Ammonia, nitrite and nitrate can be taken up by plants and, hence 
converted back to organic nitrogen. Nitrate can be converted, in a biological process to 
nitrogen gas.

The Environmental System
Nitrogen in foods comes from amino acids in protein (and other nitrogen-based compounds); proteins 
are between13–19% nitrogen. The human body needs about 2 g of N per day, but most humans consume 
closer to 13 g/d, so 11 g/d will go into the waste stream. Before excretion, amino acids are broken down 
to form organic acids and ammonia. Ammonia would be fatal to humans if the liver were not able to 
quickly convert it, along with carbon dioxide, to less toxic urea, CH4ON2.
3.7	
The Phosphorus Cycle
All plants and animals need phosphorus to grow so every food contains phosphorus. No phosphorus, 
no food! It is that simple.
The demands of modern life may interfere with the phosphorus cycle (Figure 3.9) more than any  other, 
with the exception of the modern massive release of carbon dioxide. Phosphorus is mined to make 
fertilizer that is spread on farmland in generous quantities and carried into waterways by erosion and 
storm runoff. One consequence is over stimulation (eutrophication) of algal and weed growth in lakes, 
reservoirs, and estuaries.
Phosphorus makes up about 1% of human bodyweight and 85% of phosphorus in the body resides in 
bones and teeth. Dietary phosphorus is absorbed in the small intestine and excreted in urine. Children 
need 0.6 g P/day, and adults need 1.2 g P/day. We excrete about 3–4 g P/day. The phosphorus contained 
in urine and feces produced in urban settings is currently approximately 0.88 million metric tons
A typical living bacterial cell is about 3% P by weight. Phosphorus is a major component in adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP), an energy-rich molecule that is essential in the basic metabolism of all living 
organisms. When the organism needs energy, a molecule of phosphorus is removed from ATP and the 
ATP becomes adenosine diphosphate (ADP). When an organism has energy to store, ADP is converted 
back to the high-energy ATP form. This ongoing conversion of ATP to ADP to ATP is a biological 
dynamo that produces, and consumes, about 40 kg of ATP per day in a typical human.
Orthophosphate (PO4
3-), a readily available nutrient, is soluble and will follow the water cycle to the sea. 
There is no gaseous form of phosphorus to move from water to land through the atmosphere. Phosphorus 
is carried by sea birds back to the land, or by human harvesting of fish or aquatic plants. Local airborne 
transport, via dust or sea spray, is not an important part of the cycle.

Figure 3.9 The natural cycle of Phosphorus (P) in water. Organic and inorganic P can exist as particulate or 
soluble materials. Transport of P to land by sea birds and by human harvesting of fish or aquatic plants is

Organic phosphorus from plant and animal cells is converted by decomposition to orthophosphate. Both 
organic and inorganic phosphorus exist in soluble and particulate forms. Algae are a particulate form. 
Inorganic phosphorus can form mineral precipitates, such as calcium phosphate.
An overload of nitrogen and phosphorus in a lake will cause eutrophication, a condition of excessive algae 
and weed growth and oxygen depletion by bacteria consuming the dead and dying algae. Phosphorus 
is usually the limiting factor in freshwater lakes. If it is reduced to sufficiently low levels the growth of 
algae will also be reduced. Even after this happens it takes a long time for the lake to clear itself of the 
accumulated load. The flushing time for the water in a lake may be 6 months to many years. The flushing 
time for sediments, which release phosphorus back to the water column, is tens of years.
Most of the phosphorus in lakes and streams comes from nonpoint sources (agricultural runoff, erosion, 
urban runoff, roadway and sidewalk deicing chemicals, and atmospheric deposition). The phosphorus 
from these sources is from 30% to 80% bio-available.
Residential wastewater (based on the input of individual homes to septic tanks) is 35–100 mg/L total N, 
including 6–18 mg ammonia/L and essentially zero nitrate and nitrite. The total phosphorus is 18–29 
mg/L as P, including 6–24 mg/L phosphate (PO4
3- -P). Toilet waste contains about 200 mg/L total N and 
100 mg/L total P; kitchen waste (including garbage disposal) has 85 mg/L total N and 10 mg/L total P. 
The average amount of excrement that one person contributes to the waste stream is 120 g feces and 
1.1 L urine. The feces contain 1.2 g N and 0.36 g PO4
3-.The values for urine are 11 g N and 3.3 g PO4
3-.

Wastewater treatment plants that discharge to lakes, including the Great Lakes, typically are required 
to reduce effluent phosphorus to 1 mg/L total P. The reason is to prevent excessive algae growth and 
eutrophication. Removal can be done by adding chemicals (iron or aluminum salts) or biologically.

The Environmental System
The industrial phosphorus cycle, shown in Figure 3.10, is based on mining phosphate rock to make 
fertilizer. Florida, a major producer and exporter, accounts for about 20% of the world’s phosphate 
fertilizer. A strip mine yields a mixture of pebble phosphate that is mixed with clay, sand and chemical 
impurities. The ore matrix is crushed, sifted and mixed with water to produce a granular rock that is 
shipped to processing plants. Converting this to fertilizer involves mixing the ‘rock’ with sulfuric acid or 
phosphoric acid. If ammonium phosphate fertilizer is produced, there will be a facility to manufacture 
ammonia.
Waste products are slimes and phosphogypsum. Slime is produced by the separation of clay and other 
fines from the phosphate rock. Gypsum (calcium sulfate) is produced in the reaction of sulfuric acid 
with the rock. Most of the gypsum is placed in settling ponds, often hundreds of acres in size, and in 
stacks up to 60 meters tall. A modest percentage (about 15%) is reused in agriculture and construction.
3.8	
The Sulfur Cycle
The atmosphere is an important part of the sulfur cycle, shown in Figure 3.11. The major form of sulfur 
in the atmosphere is sulfur dioxide (SO2), which can originate from natural causes (e.g. volcanoes), but 
mainly comes from the combustion of coal and petroleum products. Sulfur dioxide reacts with water 
vapor in the air to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
Sulfide readily forms hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a smelly, toxic, and corrosive gas. It also oxidizes to form 
sulfite (SO3
2-), or sulfate (SO4
2-). These forms can be reduced back to sulfide. So, like carbon and nitrogen, 
sulfur can move freely between the air, biota, water, and soil.
The conditions that promote or inhibit these transformations are important in wastewater treatment 
plants and aquatic environments. The strongly odorous sulfides, mercaptans, and skatoles are the cause 
of most odor problems around wastewater treatment plants, landfills, pulp and paper mills, and certain 
other industries.
Acid rain became a concern in the 1960s when worldwide emissions from motor vehicles and power 
plants were virtually unregulated. The pH of pure distilled water is 7.0. Normal rain can be from pH 
4.5 to pH 5.6, the lower pH value being caused by carbon dioxide (carbonic acid H2CO3) and organic 
acids that are dissolved in the rainwater. Sulfuric acid or nitric acid emissions made the rain more acidic.

Conclusion
The manufacture and use of chemicals in manufacturing is linked to the natural cycles of chemicals in 
the environment. Some of the important elements are the staples of life – carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, 
nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. If our activities upset, unbalance, or interrupt the natural cycles of these 
chemicals, we create local conditions that are unstable and unhealthy. There is no lack of technology to 
control these chemicals.

Toxicity and Aquatic Water Quality Criteria
4	 Toxicity and Aquatic Water 
Quality Criteria
4.1	
Toxicity
Toxic chemicals are a challenge, but not because we lack the technology to remove or destroy them 
in liquid effluents and gaseous emissions. The technology exists. The challenge comes from the rich 
menu of potential chemical-related problems. Toxic compounds come in many forms and cause diverse 
harmful effects.
Another kind of challenge comes from the way toxic or hazardous chemicals are regulated. The five 
main U.S. laws regulate 1134 chemicals. Only 49 are common to all five laws. Of the 269 pollutants in 
the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, only 68 are common to both laws.
A toxic chemical will cause harm only when an animal (fish, bird, crustacean, human) is exposed by being 
in the wrong place at the wrong time. Harm is done only at certain levels and durations of exposure. 
Chemicals that are poisons in high doses may be needed in small amounts for normal healthy life. Many 
potentially poisonous substances can be excreted or metabolized if the dose does not exceed some critical 
level. The dose makes the poison.

Mercury (Hg)
Mercury is found in trace amounts in the atmosphere, soil, rock, water, and in the tissue of plants and 
animals. In soil, the concentration is normally measured in parts per billion. It may exist in the atmosphere 
as vapor or in particulate form at parts per billion levels and less. In water, the level is generally parts per 
trillion. The highest concentration to which a freshwater aquatic community can be exposed indefinitely 
without an unacceptable effect is 0.77 µg/L (0.77 ppb).
Mercury is a threat because it can be concentrated up to 120 ppb in fish. The mercury is sequestered in 
the fatty tissue of the fish. It does not harm the fish, but it is dangerous to animals, including people, 
who consume the fish.
The most dangerous are the organic forms, especially methyl and dimethyl mercury (CH3Hg and C2H6Hg). 
These compounds have an affinity for attaching to proteins, chromosomes, and brain cells. The bonds 
are persistent and can remain destructive for months. Inorganic and phenyl mercurials (e.g. C6H5Hg) 
are also dangerous but the injuries they cause are nearly always reversible.

Benzene
Benzene is a human carcinogen for all routes of exposure, based on convincing human evidence and 
supporting evidence from animal studies. Inhalation of benzene (C6H6) can cause leukemia. The increased 
cancer risk to an individual who is exposed for a lifetime to air that contains 1.3–4.5 µg/m3 benzene is 
1 in 100,000. The same risk results from lifetime exposure to drinking water that contains 10–100 µg/L 
benzene. (USEPA Integrated Risk Information System – IRIS)
4.2.4	
DDT
Pesticides are designed to kill specific plants, insects or animals. The good ones are efficient in killing the 
target organism, harmless to other organisms, and biodegradable. Unfortunately, many are persistent, 
mobile, bioaccumulative, and dangerous to untargeted species. DDT, once regarded as the miracle 
chemical that would eradicate malaria, is one of these.
Bioaccumulation (bioconcentration) occurs because the food an organism consumes is divided between 
respiration for energy and synthesis of new tissue. A substance that is not involved in respiration and 
is not excreted efficiently may be concentrated in the tissue by a factor of ten-fold at each step in the 
food chain. The concentration can increase by 1000-fold from one end of the food chain to the other.
The solubility of DDT in water is about 1 µg/L (1 ppb). If water contains 1 ppb DDT, plankton living in 
the water may contain 0.4 ppm, minnows 12 ppm, and a carnivorous bird 75 ppm. The accumulation 
can devastate an animal population even when the accumulated chemical does not kill outright. DDT 
put eagles on the endangered species list by weakening eggshells so they broke before the chicks could 
hatch. The catastrophe was beautifully explained in Silent Spring (Carson 1962). When the use of DDT 
was restricted the eagle population recovered and flourished.
4.2.5	
Radioactive Substances
Radioisotopes are metabolized in the same way as their stable isotopes. This means that most of them are 
not concentrated in the food chain. Strontium 90 is similar to calcium and it concentrates in bones. The 
route from atmospheric fallout to humans is fallout deposit on plants or incorporation into plants from 
the soil. Fortunately, since it lodges in the bones there is no transmission from one animal to another 
unless a predator eats the bones.
Cesium-137 behaves chemically like potassium. Potassium is an essential element for all cells, so cesium 
becomes widely distributed within the body after ingestion. Consequently, it can pass from predator to 
prey and accumulate at each step up the food chain.

Cesium-137, Cobalt-60, Iodine-129 & -131, Plutonium, Strontium-90, Thorium, and Uranium are the 
radioisotopes most commonly used for medical, military, or commercial purposes and most commonly 
found in Superfund Sites.
4.3	
Aquatic Bioassays
4.3.1	
Bioassays
A biological assay (bioassay) uses an organism as the reagent for measuring the amount of a toxic 
substance that can be tolerated. The result depends on the species of the test organism, organism age 
and size, diet, other factors, some of which may be unknown or unmeasured.
The critical difference between setting aquatic criteria and human health criteria is that aquatic bioassays 
provide direct evidence about the organisms of interest. We do not have to predict toxicity to fish from 
tests on rats. Fish, insect larvae and plankton, at any life stage, can be exposed to toxic materials and 
observed. The procedures and costs are reasonable.
Testing for human carcinogens and mutagens is an order of magnitude more difficult. We cannot do 
dangerous experiments with people as test subjects so we test rats and mice and other small animals. 
This raises the problem of translating those results into predictions about human health.
An aquatic bioassay uses several parallel aquaria that are populated with the same species, number, and 
size of test organisms (fish, macro-invertebrates, or algae). It is common in running bioassay tests to 
maintain all factors except the lethal factor at levels that should be healthful. Oxygen, pH, and temperature 
are important factors to maintain at healthful levels.
At least one aquarium is used as a control with clean water. The others are contaminated with the 
toxicant being studied. The toxicant concentration is constant in a single aquarium, but different across 
the parallel units. If fish are tested, a continuous flow of water would be maintained through the aquaria. 
For smaller animals this may not be required. The influent may be clean water that has been dosed with 
the toxicant, or it can be effluent that is diluted in different proportions.
4.3.2	
Acute Toxicity Bioassays
The dose-response curve for an acute bioassay shows the percentage of organisms surviving (or dying) 
within a specified time of exposure, usually 48, 96, or 144 hours. The concentration that kills half the 
test organisms is called the LC50 (LC indicates Lethal Concentration). The LC50 is meaningless unless the 
time of exposure is stated. The result should be reported as the 144-hr LC50, or the 96-hr LC50.

Figure 4.1 shows that the survival of bluegills exposed to copper (Cu) decreases as exposure time increases. 
At 0.6 mg/L, the 96-hr LC50, 85% of organisms survive for 48 hours, 50% survive for 96 hours, and just 
over 10% survive for 144 hours. In this case the relation between exposure time and LC50 is almost 
linear and we find LC50-144-hr = 0.40 mg/L, LC50-96-hr = 0.60 mg/L, and LC50-48-hr = 0.76 mg/L Cu.

Chronic Toxicity Bioassays
The response in a chronic bioassay can take many forms. Heart beat, gill movement, and breathing rate 
of fish can be measured continuously and used as a signal of stressful but non-lethal conditions. Growth 
rate and breeding efficiency of small aquatic animals are also used to assess chronic toxicity.
A special kind of chronic bioassay is effluent biomonitoring, which can be required in a wastewater 
discharge permit. A screening test exposes test organisms to a mixture of 50% effluent and 50% non-
toxic dilution water. Responses that can be observed in each test are:
•	 Death – number of organisms killed by a test solution.
•	 Growth – increase in body weight or size of test organisms.
•	 Reproduction – offspring produced per female or increase in number of organisms.
•	 Terata – gross abnormalities shown in early life stages.
A toxic response in the screening test may lead to a definitive test to estimate the concentration or 
percentage of effluent at which a certain percentage or significant fraction of organisms exhibit a 
certain response. Organisms are exposed to a predetermined array of test solutions containing various 
proportions of effluent.
EC50 = 4.5%          
Figure 4.2 Typical effluent bioassay test showing the NOEL, LOEL, and 
EC50. NOEL = No Observed Effect Level, the highest level at which the 
response is not significantly different statistically from controls. NOEL is 
normally only used in chronic toxicity tests. LOEL = Lowest Observed 
Effect Level, is the lowest dose at which the response can be statistically 
distinguished from the control group. The NOEL is the next lowest dose 
below the LOEL. The LOEL and NOEL may correspond to an effect that is 
observable but is not adverse and of no practical importance.

Toxicity and Aquatic Water Quality Criteria
Figure 4.2 shows a possible test result. The icons below the curve indicate the dilutions of effluent that 
were used. This is a geometric progression. Starting from 100% effluent, each lower dose decreases by 
half, so the dilutions are 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25% effluent and lower to include a clean water control.
The percentage of test organisms showing the response is plotted against the percentage of effluent. A 
valid bioassay should show a generally increasing percent response for increasing percentages of effluent. 
The graph is typical in showing a sudden change, often 75% or more, between two of the effluent dilution 
levels. Sometimes this response is even more exaggerated, with no response at one dilution and 100 
percent response at the next higher concentration.
The graph defines several measures of toxicity.
•	 EC50 is the level at which 50% of the organisms show an effect that is not necessarily death. 
(EC denotes effective concentration.) For some test species (e.g., Ceriodaphnia dubia) the 
point of death is not easy to specify so immobility is used as the response.
•	 NOEL is the no observable effect level. This is the highest tested level at which the responses 
is not significantly different statistically from the control (zero exposure). The NOEL is 
normally only used in chronic toxicity tests.
•	 LOEL is the lowest observable effect level. This is the lowest dose at which the response can 
be statistically distinguished from the control group. This occurs at 3.125%. The NOEL is the 
next lowest dose.

Toxicity and Aquatic Water Quality Criteria
Not shown are the lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) and the no observable adverse effect 
level (NOAEL). These differ from the LOEL and the NOEL because the effect is judged to be biologically 
adverse, either because of its severity or its frequency. The LOEL may be an effect that is observable but 
is not adverse and of no practical importance.
The bioassay results need to be converted to water quality criteria. Tests for a variety of species need to 
be examined so the most sensitive will be protected.
4.4	
Water Quality Criteria for Toxic Chemicals
Water quality criteria are based only on data and scientific judgments about pollutant concentrations 
and their effects. Whether numeric or narrative in form, water quality criteria protect designated uses by 
describing the chemical, physical and biological conditions necessary for safe use of waters by humans 
and aquatic life. Definitions and examples of some criteria appear in Table 4.3.
Type
Definition
Example
Numeric Criteria
Lists the maximum pollutant concentration 
levels allowed in a water body.
The maximum concentration of lead that 
aquatic life can tolerate in a water body on a 
short-term (acute) basis is 65 micrograms of 
lead per liter of freshwater.
Narrative “Free 
From” Criteria
Describes the desired conditions for a water 
body as being “free from” certain negative 
conditions.
Free from excessive algae blooms
Narrative Biological 
Criteria
Describes the kinds of organisms expected in 
a healthy water body.
Capable of supporting and maintaining a 
balanced, integrated, adaptive community of 
diverse warm water aquatic organisms.
Table 4.3 Types of Water Quality Criteria (USEPA 2002, 2011)
Nationally recommended aquatic life criteria set numeric allowable thresholds concentrations of 
particular chemicals. Criteria are usually derived for both freshwater and saltwater organisms. The 
specified levels are intended to protect aquatic organisms from unacceptable effects assuming the 
following default exposures:
•	 Acute = Exposure to a 1-hour average concentration of the chemical does not exceed the 
criterion more than once every 3 years on average.
•	 Chronic = Exposure to a 4-day average concentration of the chemical does not exceed the 
criterion more than once every 3 years on average.
The acute toxicity criterion (Criterion Maximum Concentration or CMC) is an estimate of the highest

Toxicity and Aquatic Water Quality Criteria
The chronic toxicity criterion (Criterion Continuous Concentration or CCC) is an estimate of the 
highest concentration of a material in ambient water to which an aquatic community can be exposed 
indefinitely without resulting in an unacceptable adverse effect (e.g., immobility, slower growth, reduced 
reproduction).
A biological community comprises fish, insects, snails, etc. in juvenile and adult stages of life. The 
tolerance may range from extremely sensitive to robust and tolerant. The sensitivity of different species 
can cover a wide range of LC50 or EC50 values. Figure 4.3 shows the LC50 concentrations for fifty aquatic 
species (fish, insects, etc.) that were exposed to copper. Ten percent of species had an LC50 of less than 
25 µg/L, 50% were less than 260 µg/L and a few could tolerate more than 500 µg/L.
The criteria are set to protect the most sensitive organisms The minimum data requirement is acceptable 
acute values for at least eight taxonomic families of aquatic organisms, as shown in Table 4.4.

Toxicity and Aquatic Water Quality Criteria
The procedure to calculate the recommended acute criterion (CMC) is:
•	 Calculate the Genus Mean Acute Values (GMAV) for a minimum of eight families of 
organisms (Table 4.4).
•	 Rank order the GMAVs and estimate the 5th percentile organism (95% of organisms are 
more tolerant).
•	 Use the GMAVs to estimate the Final Acute Value (FAV).
•	 The Critical Maximum Concentration is half the FAV: CMC = FAV/2.
The FAV is set at half the CMC to establish a low level effect for the most sensitive 5th percentile genus, 
rather than a 50% effect.
Example 4.1 Calculation of the Genus Mean Acute Values (GMAV) for Daphnia sp.
Data from acute toxicity bioassays on three species of Daphnia, a small crustacean, yield the average EC50 values of 
29, 38, and 42 µg/L. These three values are averaged to get an average for the Genus Daphnia. This gives the GMAV = 
36 µg/L.

Example 4.2 Calculation of the Final Acute Value (FAV) and the Critical Maximum Concentration (CMC)
GMAVs have been determined for nine organisms and the sample ranking of the lowest four is given in Table 4.5. The 
percentile rank is p = 100r/(n+1), where r = rank, n = number of ranked GMAVs, and p = percentile. For nine GMAVs 
this becomes p = 100r/(9+1) = 10r. 
The GMAVs are plotted against the percentile rank in Figure 4.4 and a straight line is drawn to facilitate interpolation 
to find the FAV at the lower fifth percentile point. 
FAV = 11 µg/L.

Site-Specific Water Quality Criteria
The toxicity of a substance may be increased or decreased by the presence of other substances. Stream 
water contains particles and organic carbon that may bind metals and other chemicals and render them 
less harmful, or some metals may form less active inorganic complexes. Water hardness (the amount of 
calcium and magnesium in the water) is known to moderate the toxicity of some metals.

Toxicity and Aquatic Water Quality Criteria
The Water-Effect Ratio is one approach to deriving site-specific aquatic life criteria. At times it may seem 
that directly transcribing the USEPA criteria is overly protective. The water-effects ratio looks at relevant 
differences between the toxicities of a chemical in lab dilution water and in site water.
Two side-by-side toxicity tests are conducted, one using amended laboratory dilution water and one 
using amended site water. The concentrations used are established using water quality data from the 
affected site.
The end point obtained using site water is divided by the endpoint obtained using the lab dilution water. 
The quotient is the Water-Effect Ratio, which is multiplied by the national or state aquatic life criterion 
to obtain the site-specific criterion.
The Recalculation Method recalculates the water quality criteria after eliminating some organisms 
that were included in the USEPA calculation. For example, if rainbow trout were used to calculate the 
recommended criteria and rainbow trout are not found the location of interest, a new CMC is recalculated 
without trout. Using this approach requires stream surveys to identify the indigenous aquatic organisms.

Adjusting for Water Hardness
Water hardness – the amount of calcium and magnesium in the water – is known to moderate the toxicity 
of some metals. Figure 4.5 shows how the LC50 of copper increases (toxicity decreases) as the hardness 
increases. Similar results are seen for cadmium, chromium III, copper, lead, nickel, silver, and zinc.

Toxicity and Aquatic Water Quality Criteria
Water hardness measures the amount of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in water. The concentration 
is reported as mg/L CaCO3. The conversion from mg/L Ca and mg/L Mg to mg/L CaCO3 is
(1 mg Ca/L)(100 mg CaCO3/40 mg Ca) = 2.5 mg/L CaCO3
(1 mg Mg/L) (100 mg CaCO3/24.3 mg Mg) = 4.1 mg/L CaCO3
Water that contains 20 mg/L Mg and 50 mg/L Ca has a hardness of 80.4 + 125 = 205.4 mg/L CaCO3
The conversion factor, CF, which is in the range 0.85 to 1.00, is an adjustment for the biological 
unavailability of bound metals.

Toxicity and Aquatic Water Quality Criteria
Example 4.3 Site Specific Criteria for Copper and Lead
The river flow and the water hardness change during the year and seasonal chronic toxicity limits were needed for copper 
and lead. The hardness at summer low flow is 89 mg/L as CaCO3. During the winter low flow it is 97 mg/L as CaCO3.
The toxicity model parameters, from Table 4.3, are
	
Copper	 	
mC = 0.8545	
bC = –1.702  
	
Lead	
	
mC = 1.273	
bC = –4.705
For Copper, the conversion factor is CFCopper = 0.960 
The chronic toxicity criterion for Copper in summer conditions is
	
CMCCopper = exp[0.8545 ln(89)-1.702](0.960) = 8.1 µg/L
The Copper criterion for winter is 8.7 µg/L.
For Lead, the conversion factor depends on hardness, CFLead = 1.46203  – 0.145712 ln(hardness).
The chronic toxicity criterion for Lead in summer conditions is
	
CFLead = 1.46203  – 0.145712 ln(89) = 0.808
	
CMCLead  = exp[1.273 ln(89)-4.705](0.808) = 2.2 µg/L
The Lead criterion for winter is 2.4 µg/L.
4.7	
Ammonia Toxicity
Ammonia in water exists in two species: ammonia (NH3), which is toxic, and ammonium (NH4
+), which 
is not. Total ammonia is the sum of these two species:
Total Ammonia Nitrogen (NH3-N) = ammonia (NH3-N) + ammonium (NH4
+-N)
The notation NH3-N means that the concentrations are reported as mg/L of Nitrogen (N). This gives 
both species the same units and the concentrations can be added.
The laboratory analysis for ammonia cannot distinguish the two species, so the measured values are total 
ammonia. The total concentration does not determine the toxicity, because the NH4
+ is not toxic. The 
proportion of total ammonia that exists in each form can be calculated using the water temperature and 
pH. The details, which are omitted here, can be found in USEPA water quality standards (USEPA 2011).
Higher pH and higher temperatures cause more of the total ammonia to be in the toxic form, NH3. 
Lower pH and lower temperature reduce the toxicity. The fraction of total ammonia in the toxic un-
ionized form (NH3) is shown in Figure 4.6. Table 4.7 gives the chronic toxicity limits for total ammonia 
at different levels of pH and temperature.

Toxicity and Aquatic Water Quality Criteria
Example 4.4 Seasonal Ammonia Criteria
A municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent is currently creating ammonia concentrations of 8–10 mg/L NH3-N 
in a small receiving stream. Seasonal ammonia criteria are needed for summer values of pH = 8.0 and T = 22°C. 
Sensitive life stages are present in summer. The winter values are pH = 7.5 and T = 8°C; sensitive life stages are absent.
From Table 4.7 the criteria are
	
Summer = 1.5 mg/L total ammonia (NH3-N)
	
Winter = 6.64 mg/L total ammonia (NH3-N)
From Figure 4.6, the fractions of un-ionized ammonia (NH3) are
	
Summer = 4.5%
	
Winter  = 1%
The approximate concentrations of the two ammonia species are
	
Summer:

Conclusion
The challenge is that toxic pollutants come in many forms and cause diverse harmful effects. Some 
accumulate in the flesh and organs of animals, some breakdown the environment, some are mobile while 
others are not, some cause cancer or birth defects after long exposure, some kill quickly at sufficiently 
high doses, and some upset normal body functions in subtle ways that we may overlook until the 
cumulative effect is serious disease.
The key decisions are
•	 Which chemicals must be controlled?
•	 What concentrations can be tolerated or accepted?
The aquatic bioassay is how we answer these questions for fish and other aquatic organisms. Acute 
toxicity and chronic toxicity tests are used to set acute (CMC) and chronic (CCC) water quality criteria.

Risk Assessment
5	 Risk Assessment
5.1	
Risk Assessment Models and Philosophy
People ask whether a practice, product, or condition is safe, knowing that nearly all we do entails some 
risk. If safe means ‘no risk’ then there is no such thing as safe. A better question would be ‘Is the risk 
acceptable?’
Acceptance of risk is subjective. Some people have faith in our ability to calculate impacts and risks, and 
to design protective measures as needed. Others are skeptical and believe that many failures have led to 
unanticipated environmental and health damage.
Risk assessment is a simplified model of the real world that relies on many assumptions and subjective 
judgments. The models are useful, but they are certain to be wrong with respect to some parts of the 
real world. Conclusions are vulnerable to error caused by gaps in the data that lead to gaps between the 
model and reality.

Risk Assessment
There are fundamental differences in worldview and they may arise in part from the differences in the 
time scale over which people think. The U.S. view of long-term is 30 to 100 years. In Europe the view 
of time can be quite different. You will see land that has been farmed for thousands of years. Vineyards 
that grew grapes for early civilizations still produce wine today. Lead used by Romans 2000 years ago 
persists in the soil. This should change our view of long-term sustainability.
5.2	
Semi-Quantitative Risk Assessment
Risk mapping is a semi-quantitative risk management tool that combines subjective information (expert 
opinion) and objective information (measurements and calculations). Different approaches can be used 
depending on the amount and kind of information available. A hierarchy of decisions or actions can be 
prepared as part of the exercise.
Figure 5.1 is an example of a risk profile matrix. The likelihood of an accident or other hazardous or 
harmful event (which could include financial harm) is categorized on a subjective scale. Five categories 
are used in this example, but other schemes could be used. The likelihood of an event ranges from being 
near zero (say less than 3%) to frequent (say more than 90%). The severity of the consequences, should 
an event happen, range from a small inconvenience to catastrophic.
The combinations in the upper right-hand corner are serious. Proactive measures are needed before 
these take place. The goal should be to reduce the likelihood of the events and to mitigate the damage 
if they occur.

products of the marginal weights.

Hazards and Risks
A hazard is a situation that poses a threat to life, health, property, or the environment. Most hazards pose 
only a theoretical risk of harm. A toxic chemical becomes an active hazard (danger, harm) when toxicity 
and exposure are combined. Trucks and rail cars that haul hazardous materials are clearly marked with 
the familiar sign shown in Figure 5.2 so emergency crews will know exactly what hazard they face in 
case of an accident. This sign shows that materials can be hazardous in many different ways, by toxicity, 
flammability, and strong chemical reactions, including possible explosions.

Figure 5.3 Annual risk of death (per person per year) for some “risky” activities.
Figure 5.3 shows the annual risk of death for some events that might happen in the course of ordinary 
activities. Obviously, if you never fly on an airplane you are not at risk of dying in a plane crash. If you 
could remove all causes of death from your life except flying on airplanes your expected lifetime would 
be 10,000,000 years.

Risk Assessment
To have actual harm there must be a hazardous event and exposure. Toxicity is an intrinsic property of 
some chemicals, just as heat of combustion is an intrinsic property of gasoline. The heat of combustion 
represents the potential for something to happen. Until the gasoline is burned, nothing happens. What 
happens can be safe and useful, as in driving an automobile, or it could be violent and dangerous.
Likewise, toxicity only represents a potential to do harm. Nothing will happen until an organism is 
exposed, and even then nothing bad will happen unless the level of exposure is high enough and for a 
sufficiently long time. Risk assessment is the business of learning what is ‘high enough’ and ‘long enough’.
Risk is the probability that a hazard will happen. Risk depends on the probability of a critical event 
occurring and the probability of exposure.
Risk = (Probability of critical event)(Probability of exposure to event)
Figure 5.4 shows the risk of an individual getting cancer if exposed to a carcinogen that causes cancer 
once in every 100,000 exposures. The risk to the individual is one in one hundred thousand (1/100,000). 
The risk of added cancer deaths for an exposed population of 1,000,000 to a dose that causes cancer 
once in 100,000 exposures, is (1/100,000)(1,000,000) = 10 cases of cancer.

Risk Assessment
Risk assessment and risk management are used to evaluate risk of all kinds, including financial risks. 
Our discussion will be about toxic chemicals in air and water.

Risk of

Event - Exposure to 
carcinogenic chemical

Hazard - Getting cancer 
due to exposure 
p = 1/100,000 
Figure 5.4 Illustration of risk as the combination of exposure and probability of 
exposure.
Good engineering can reduce the hazard by limiting either the dose or the exposure, or both. For example:
•	 Change raw materials used in manufacturing to eliminate the toxic substance.
•	 Provide waste treatment to reduce the discharge or emission of toxic substances.
•	 Encapsulate or contain the toxic substance to prevent exposure,.
•	 Install barriers to keep people away from the substance.
•	 Control how the material is transported.
This is the business of risk management.

Toxic Chemicals – The Regulator’s Dilemma
It is upsetting when the media exclaims that a toxic chemical has been found in food or water or air. The 
excitement can be a false alarm because chemists routinely quantify chemical concentrations in the parts 
per billion range and they can detect chemicals at even lower levels. The important issue is not presence 
or absence of a chemical but ‘Can the chemical cause harm at the concentration found?’
No 
Yes

Risk Assessment
The regulator’s dilemma, shown in Figure 5.5, is deciding whether a chemical or substance should be 
banned or regulated. There are two correct decisions and two that are wrong. The worst mistake is failure 
to ban or regulate a truly dangerous substance. We also want to not ban substances that are harmless 
because this mistake will waste time and money that could be better used on real problems.
Good epidemiological studies top all other information, but they do not exist for most chemicals. They 
evaluate the health of real people in the real world. The most definitive studies are of clearly identified 
groups of industrial workers, or very large groups of exposed people, such as smokers and long-term 
residents in cities with highly polluted air.

Figure 5.6 Epidemiological studies and laboratory studies provide different 
kinds of information. Both are needed and both are valuable. When clear 
epidemiological information does not exist data from laboratory studies are 
used to extrapolate risks in the real world.
Figure 5.6 suggests that these studies can give fuzzy results. This is because people move from farms to 
towns, and they change jobs and diets. Also, the number of people exposed to a hazard may be small or 
their exposure may be short, and this greatly reduces the chance that harm will be observed.
Laboratory studies provide data on the health of confined animals that have eaten or inhaled the substance 
of interest. The animal population is homogeneous, for example, rats of a certain breed that are housed 
and fed in identical conditions. These studies give a clear picture of risk in the idealized laboratory animal 
world, which poorly represents the messy real world where we live.
To help understand the difference between these two kinds to studies imagine all true knowledge about 
a toxic substance is written on the walls, floor, and ceiling of a dark room. You will be allowed inside 
the room for ten minutes with an ordinary flashlight (no cameras or iPhones). How will you use your 
few minutes?

Risk Assessment
You might read carefully what is written on a small section of one wall. This is like doing an animal 
laboratory study. You learn a lot of details, but they will not explain much about the world. Alternately, 
you might stand back and cast your light from spot to spot, scanning information about many things, 
but the information will have large gaps and spaces. This is like an epidemiological study. You have some 
useful ideas about a bigger, more complicated, and more realistic world. But the blank spaces in your 
knowledge frustrate efforts to answer many questions in detail.
Whichever choice you have made – scan or focus – you need professional friends who have done the 
opposite to help fill in the gaps. Epidemiologists and public health workers study the work of laboratory 
scientists, and vice versa. Over time, a collective body of knowledge emerges, and as more scientists 
exchange information the quality of knowledge becomes more reliable.
The difficulty is that we would like to know about thousands of potentially hazardous substances. The 
analogy is thousands of dark rooms that need exploration. The scientific problem is that truth is revealed 
incrementally in small steps. The economic problem is that entry to the room is not free. The aggregated 
cost of a useful level of knowledge is millions of dollars per chemical.

Tests for Genotoxicity
Genotoxic means able to damage genetic material. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that 
contains the genetic information responsible for cell growth, function, and reproduction. The gene is 
the portion of DNA that directs the formation of a single product. Alteration of DNA causes mutations. 
Mutations in reproductive cells may cause birth defects. Mutations in non-reproductive cells may cause 
cell death or cancer.
Long-term genotoxicity tests look for birth defects or cancer. These tests are expensive in terms of money, 
laboratories, scientists, and test animals. A long-term test using rats or mice might take 26 weeks to 3 
years and cost millions of dollars. Other problems, aside from cost, are the need for many test animals 
and the need to use very high doses in order to stimulate an observable effect within the short life span 
of the test animals. There is also the uncertainty caused by the metabolic rate, size, surface area, and life 
span of animals being different than humans.
Short-term tests screen out the innocuous chemicals and focus attention on the serious troublemakers. 
Short-term tests use bacteria, yeast, plants, insects, isolated mammalian cells, and whole animals. They 
are used in a hierarchy of toxicity testing.
•	 Short-term tests to indicate potential hazard.
•	 Tests designed to confirm positive short-term tests and delineate the type of hazard.
•	 Long-term animal tests to validate the hazard and establish the dose-response curve needed 
for quantitative risk assessment.
Short-term genotoxic tests are based on detecting alteration of a cell’s genetic material (DNA), usually 
by checking for one of these kinds of biological activity: (1) DNA damage and repair, (2) gene mutation 
(Ames Test, enzyme changes), (3) chromosome alteration (microscopic examination), (4) cancer-like 
cell formation, or (5) tumor formation.
A positive result in a short-term test is only a sign of potential danger; an indication that additional testing 
should be done. To reliably serve this purpose, the test must not indicate that a dangerous substance 
is safe. The opposite kind of error – indicating that a safe substance is dangerous – is tolerable because 
the error will be discovered when additional testing is done on suspect substances. (See the regulator’s 
dilemma in Figure 5.5.)

The Reference Dose (RfD) for Non-Carcinogenic Chemicals
The dose response curve is different for carcinogens and non-carcinogens. For non-carcinogens there is 
a threshold concentration, below which there is no adverse effect. This is the ‘hockey-stick’ curve shown 
in Figure 5.7. The threshold value is a no observed adverse affect level (NOAEL), a low-level dose that 
a person can consume daily with no adverse effect after chronic (long term, low-level) exposure.
Carcinogens are assumed to have no safe threshold. The risk can be very small, but it never goes to zero.

Example 5.1 Determine the Acute RfD for the insecticide Chlorpyrifos (Wikipedia).
The EPA determined the acute RfD to be 0.005 mg/kg-day based  on a study in which male rats were administered 
a one-time dose of chlorpyrifos. The observed response was Cholinesterase inhibition. The lowest dose tested was 
1.5 mg/kg-day and this was specified as the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL). 
A NOAEL is estimated as one-third the LOAEL
	
NOAEL = LOAEL/3 = 1.5/3 = 0.5 mg/kg-day.
The NOAEL is divided by the standard 10-fold interspecies and 10-fold intraspecies uncertainty factors to get

Example 5.2 The Acute Population Adjusted Dose (Wikipedia).
An RfD derived with an additional uncertainty factor that only applies to certain populations is called a population 
adjusted dose. Studies showed that fetuses and children are more sensitive than adults to chlorpyrifos, so the EPA 
applied an additional ten-fold uncertainty factor to protect that subpopulation. This acute population adjusted dose 
applies to infants, children, and women who are breast feeding.

The RfD for chlorpyrifos chronic exposure based was based on studies in which animals were administered low doses 
of the pesticide for two years. The LOAEL is 0.3 mg/kg-day. An uncertainty factor of 10 was used to get 
	
NOAEL = LOAEL/10 = 0.03 mg/kg-day
Applying the 10-fold inter- and intra-species uncertainty factors for uncertainty factors gave
	
RfD = 0.0003 mg/kg-day
The chronic population adjusted dose for infants, children, and breastfeeding women is the Rfd divided by an 
additional uncertainty factor of 10, to give 0.00003 mg/kg-day.

The Dose Response Curve and the Slope Factor (SF)
Chemicals or mixtures may be studied in large animals to develop a dose-response curve that can be 
used to make predictions about human effects. A known dose of chemical is fed to an animal (rat, dog, 
monkey, etc.) in food or water, or as a gavage, or is introduced in the air supply. Animals that get sick 
or die are autopsied. Animals that survive a fixed test period are sacrificed and examined for tumors or 
other effects. The response is quantified as the proportion of exposed animals showing an effect.

Risk Assessment
The use of ‘heroic doses’ is designed to provoke a response in a short time in a small population of test 
animals. The extrapolation to levels that give acceptable risk in humans is valid if what happens to an 
animal exposed to a very high dose is, in all important ways, similar to what will happen in a human 
at low exposure.
The USEPA will make a policy decision to specify a de minimus risk. That means ‘a risk of minimum 
importance’, more commonly called the acceptable added risk. The EPA has used acceptable risk values of 
10-6 or10-4 (1/1,000,000 to 1/10,000) in different laws and policies, but most often the value is 10-6 or10-5.
Added means that exposure to the carcinogen will add cases to the prevailing rate in the population. If 
a population currently has 5,000 deaths per million persons, an acceptable risk of 1 in 1,000,000 means 
that the rate would become 5,001.
The slope factor (SF), also known as the cancer potency factor, is the slope of the extrapolated dose-
response model at a low concentration. It is the measure of added risk of cancer due to long-term 
exposure at a low dose. The units are (added risk)/(mg/kg-day), or (mg/kg-day)-1. (Slope factors can be 
found in the USEPA’s IRIS database.)
The one-hit model is the simplest dose-response model and it rests on an assumption that one-hit of a 
carcinogenic chemical on a cell can, but does not always, cause a tumor. The one-hit model is linear at 
low doses and it gives the lowest “acceptable” concentration. The one-hit model in Figure 5.8 predicts 
that 0.0003 mg/kg-day gives an added risk of 10-5 (1/100,000).
Recent research on the metabolism of chemicals is providing justification for using models like the multi-
hit and probit models. The USEPA model of choice is a multistage model. It is linear at low doses. As 
an additional safety factor, the upper 95 percent confidence limit of the fitted line is used to determine 
the acceptable dose.
Multi-hit or multi-stage means that multiple events must occur to initiate cancer. Presumably this 
combination or sequence of events is less likely than a single-hit and this increases the dose required to 
cause cancer. The multistage model applied to the data in Figure 5.8 would predict an acceptable dose of 
about 0.003 mg/kg-day. Note that it is the models, and not the data, that cause the approximate 10-fold 
difference in the predicted safe doses.

Example 5.4 Slope Factor (Cancer Potency Factor)

This is the SF for the test animal. Scale-up to humans is usually done on the basis of body surface area, which is 
proportional to the cube root of the weight. For an average human of 70 kg and an average rat of 0.04 kg, the scale-
up factor, FA, is
	
Area scale – up Factor = FA = 3√70/0.04 = 12.05 
The adjusted slope factor for humans, based on this test, is
	
SF* = SF(FA) = 12.05[0.033 (mg/kg-day)-1] = 0.40 (mg/kg-day)-1

day, the acceptable concentration in the water is

The Added Risk Concept
Cancer accounts for 1 out of 4 deaths and is the second most common cause of death in the U.S., exceeded 
only by heart disease. About 560,000 people are expected to die of cancer this year (2013), or 1500 people 
per day. The number of new cancer cases in the United States in 2012 was 1,638,910 (excluding skin 
cancers). The probability of developing invasive cancer from birth to death is 45% for men and 38% for 
women. About 55% of new cancer cases are diagnosed in people of age 55 years and older.

Risk Assessment
It is known how many cases of the different kinds of cancer are diagnosed each year and how many 
people die from the disease. That is the background rate. It is generally unknown what fraction of cancer 
cases are initiated by environmental exposure to chemicals and what fraction is determined by genetic 
predisposition and natural aging. Whatever the fractions may be, we presume that the fraction due to 
environmental exposure to chemicals will be increased if exposure is increased and, conversely, that the 
number of cases will be reduced by better risk management.
Added risk is the risk increment above the existing background risk:
	
Total risk = background risk + added risk of dose d
	
Added risk = A(d) = p(d) – p(b)
where 	 p(d) = the total risk to an individual
	
p(b) = the risk when the dose is at the background level.
The notation p indicates that risk is the probability that an individual subjected to the stated exposure 
will develop, but not necessarily die from cancer.
The model for incremental individual risk to an exposed individual is
	
Incremental individual lifetime cancer risk = CDI × SF

CDI is the chronic daily intake (the absorbed chemical dose averaged over a lifetime), measured in mg/day 
of chemical absorbed per kg body weight. For an average adult we assume the body weight is 70 kg and 
the average lifetime is 70 years. The slope factor (SF) has units of added cancers per year per mg/kg-day. 
The value calculated from dose-response data by the USEPA is an upper-bound estimate of the actual risk.
The expected number of Added Cancers (AC) per year in an exposed population of size P is
Added cancer cases in an exposed population = P × CDI × SF
In short, the population risk is the individual risk multiplied by the size of the exposed population.
Tables 5.1 gives the default values for body weight and consumption that are widely used for risk 
calculations. Fish consumption is included because bioaccumulation of carcinogens in the edible tissue 
may create a significant cancer risk. Table 5.2 lists some cancer potency factors and other characteristics 
for a few important chemicals.

Risk Assessment
Example 5.6 Risk Assessment for Chloroform in Drinking Water  (ADAPTED FROM MASTERS & ELA 2008)
Disinfecting drinking water with chlorine forms an undesired byproduct, chloroform (CHCl3). Find the upper-bound 
lifetime cancer risk for a 70 kg person who drinks 2 L of water every day for 70 years with a chloroform concentration 
of 0.20 mg/L (twice the drinking water standard). 
First, compute the CDI:
CDI (mg/kg-day) =
Average daily dose (mg/day)   =
(0.2 mg/L)(2 L/day)   = 0.00572 mg/kg-day
Body weight (kg)
70 kg
The chloroform slope factor for ingestion is 6.1x10-3 (mg/kg-day)-1. The incremental lifetime cancer risk is
	
Risk = CDI x SF
= 0.00572 mg/kg-day x 6.1x10-3 (mg/kg-d)-1 = 34.8x10-6
Thus, over a 70-yr period the upper bound estimate of the probability that a person will get cancer from chloroform 
in this drinking water is about 35 in a million. 
If a city of 500,000 people also drinks the same amount of this water, how many extra cancers per year would be 
expected?  Assume a standard 70-year lifetime.
500,000 people x
34.8 cancer
 x
1
 = 0.24 cancers/yr
106 people
70yr
Compare the extra cancers per year caused by chloroform in the drinking water with the expected number of cases 
from all causes for this city. The average annual cancer death rate in the U.S. is about 190 per 100,000.  The expected 
number of cancer deaths in a population of 500,000 is about 950.  It is unlikely that an additional 0.24 new cancers 
per year would be detectable.
Example 5.7 Inhalation of Ethylene oxide (EO) and PAHs
Air pollution by ethylene oxide (EO) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) is a concern. Calculate the cancer risk if 
the annual average concentrations are 0.1 µg/m3 for ethylene oxide and 0.05 µg/m3 for PAH. The respective unit risk 
factors are 8.8 x 10-5 m3/µg for ethylene oxide and 1.7 x 10-3 m3/µg for PAH. 
	
Cancer risk = (unit risk)(annual average concentration)
Cancer risk for EO = (0.1 µg/m3)(8.8 x 10-5 m3/µg = 8.8 x 10-6	
Cancer risk for PAH = (0.05 µg/m3)(1.7 x 10-3 m3/µg) = 8.5 x 10-5
In an exposed population of 1,000,000 people this method estimates an additional 85 cancer cases due to PAH and 9 
due to ethylene oxide, for a total of 94 additional cases.

Risk Assessment
Example 5.8 Inhalation risk of benzene and toluene
A ground level plume from an industry reaches nearby homes. The concentrations are 10 µg/m3 toluene and 5 µg/m3 
benzene. The respective slope factors are 0.021 (mg/kg-day)-1 and 0.029 (mg/kg-day)-1. A 70-kg adult breathes 15 m3 
of contaminated air per day for 15 years. Assume that 75% of the inhaled chemicals are absorbed.
Risk =
(Air conc.)(Slope factor)(Breathing rate)(Duration)(Absorption)
(Ave. body weight)(Lifetime)
Risk = (10 μg/m3)(0.021(mg/kg-day)-1(15 m3/d)(15 years)(0.75)   =
1 mg
  = 7.2 x 10-6
(70 kg)(70 years)
1000 μg
Risk =
(5 μg/m3)(0.029(mg/kg-day)-1(15 m3/d)(15 years)(0.75)   =
1 mg
  = 5.0 x 10-6
(70 kg)(70 years)
1000 μg
Total risk = RiskToluene + RiskBenzene = 7.2 x 10-6 + 5.0 x 10-6 = 12.2 x 10-6
= 12 cases per 1,000,000 exposed people.

Risk-based Standards for Drinking Water
5.9.1	
Relative Source Contribution
Drinking water, polluted air, and contaminated food are possible sources of pollutants that a person 
could face each day. Estimating health-protective levels of chemical in drinking water should consider 
the proportion of the total possible dose derived from water versus other sources. That proportion is the 
relative source contribution (RCS). This applies to chemicals that have a threshold toxicity.

Risk Assessment
The USEPA has used values of 0.2 to 0.8 (20% to 80%) of the total acceptable exposure for drinking 
water, with 0.2 (20%) being the default value in the absence of good data. The total exposure should not 
exceed the reference dose (RfD). This approach has been used to derive public health goals (PHGs) for 
69 chemicals. Some of the values used in the derivation of public health goals are in Table 5.3.

Maximum Contaminant Level
The Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) is a non-enforceable health-based goal. For known 
carcinogens, or cancer-causing agents, the goal is set at zero, assuming that any level of consumption 
presents a cancer risk. For non-carcinogens the MCLG level is based on the assumption that a person 
could consume two liters of drinking water containing the maximum level of the contaminant daily for 
70 years without experiencing any known health effects
The Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) is the highest level of a contaminant that is allowed in 
drinking water. MCLs are enforceable standards. MCLs are set as close to MCLGs as feasible using the 
best available treatment technology and taking cost into consideration.
There is no MCL for turbidity, bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Instead a Treatment Technique is 
established. Some calculations are

Risk Assessment
Example 5.9 Hypothetical MCL Determination.
The acceptable daily intake of a non-carcinogen for a human of 70 kg body weight is calculated from the reference 
dose (RfD)
	
Intake = RfD x BW 
For RfD = 1 mg/kg-day, 
	
Intake = (1 mg/kg-day)(70 kg) = 70 mg/day
Assuming 2 L/day of water intake, the allowable concentration in the drinking water is
	
Drinking water concentration (mg/L) = (70 mg/day)/(2 L/day) = 35 mg/L
Assuming that 20% of the total allowable daily intake will come from drinking water, the Maximum Contaminant 
Level (MCL) is
	
MCL = 0.2(35 mg/L) = 7 mg/L
If the chemical is a Class C carcinogen (suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential), divide by uncertainty factor 
UF = 10.
	
MCL = (7 mg/L)/10 = 0.7 mg/L

Risk Assessment of the Land Application of Sludge
5.10.1	
Beneficial Use of Biosolids
Sewage sludge (biosolids) is the byproduct of processes that clean municipal wastewater in preparation 
for discharge to waterways. The USEPA reported in 1996 that US treatment plants produce an estimated 
5.3 million metric tons of sludge per year.
Ocean dumping was banned in 1988. Landfilling and incineration carry high environmental and 
economic costs. This makes land disposal an attractive option. Also, the sludge is rich in nitrogen and 
phosphorus, which makes it useful as a soil amendment on farms, reclaimed lands, and forestland. One 
annual application of sludge can provide the nitrogen and phosphorus needed to grow corn, alfalfa, 
and soybeans.
Sewage contains food and fecal wastes from homes and businesses and a variety of products and 
contaminants, but also landfill leachate (in many cities) and contaminants leached from plumbing fixtures. 
The average composition of municipal sewage sludge in the U.S. is given in Table 5.5.

Notes:   Dry weight basis means that 100 kg of dry sludge solids will contain from 4 to 8 kg of total nitrogen. 
100 kg of dry sludge solids will contain, on average, (100 kg)(10 mg/kg) = 1000 mg Arsenic.
Table 5.5 Average composition of sewage sludge.
Any metals that are removed by a municipal wastewater treatment plant become part of the biosolids 
(the sludge). Most are incorporated into the sludge solids, but some are soluble and thus mobile and 
bioavailable. The insoluble fraction may become bioavailable in the soil, depending upon pH and other 
factors.

Risk Assessment
Sludge that has a total solids concentration of 3% to 5% (dry solids) is handled as a liquid. Injection 
into the plow layer of soil is a common practice, but it can be sprayed if used for land reclamation or in 
forestland. Sludge that has been dewatered to a solids concentration of 18% can be handled as a solid 
(squeezing the sludge will not release any water).
5.10.2	
The Risk Assessment Pathways
The Part 503 sludge regulations control nine metals and pathogenic microorganisms in sludge that 
will be applied to land. The EPA did not establish pollutant limits for any organic pollutants because it 
determined that none of the organics considered for regulation pose a public health or environmental 
risk from land application of sewage sludge (USEPA, 1992a).
The USEPA supports ‘beneficial reuse of biosolids’ and asserts that the practice is low risk. They evaluated 
each of the nine metals through 14 pathways to find the pathway resulting in the lowest concentration 
at the ‘acceptable risk’ level. The pathways are listed in Table 5.6. Most of these are shown in Figure 5.9.
The limiting pathway was a child ingesting sludge for arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, and selenium. 
Molybdenum was limited by an animal’s diet. Copper, nickel and zinc were limited by direct toxicity to 
plants (phytotoxicity).

Risk Assessment
The Cumulative Pollutant Loading Rate (CPLR) is taken directly from the risk assessment results. The 
Ceiling Concentration Limit also considers the risk assessment, but less directly. Once the CPLR has been 
reached no more biosolids can be applied to that site. Even at the CPL, however, the pollutant loading 
is protective of public health and the environment.
The Pollution Concentration Limit is the most stringent. It defines no-adverse-effect biosolids that will be 
safe without the applier keeping track of cumulative pollutant loadings (as is required for CPL biosolids). 
The pollutant limits were derived from the limits identified in the risk assessment. These are based on 
an assumed application of 1,000 metric tons per hectare (tonne/ha) in which the cumulative pollutant 
loading rates would be met but not exceeded.
Biosolids that can be shown to meet the pollution concentration limits, as well as certain pathogen and 
vector control requirements, are designated exceptional quality (EQ). EQ biosolids can be land applied 
as freely as other fertilizers and soil conditioners without having to show that they meet the Part 503 
management practices and general requirements.

Risk Assessment
Ceiling Concentration Limits identify the maximum allowable concentration of pollutants that can 
be land applied. These are minimum-quality limits to prohibit the lowest quality (highest pollutant 
concentration) biosolids from being land applied. Ceiling concentration limits are either the 95th-
percentile concentrations of the National Sludge Survey or the risk assessment pollutants limits, whichever 
were least stringent.
The Annual Pollutant Loading Rates (APLR) apply only to biosolids that are sold or given away in bags 
or other containers. A common use of bagged sludge solids is in home gardens, or at parks and golf 
courses. They identify the amounts of pollutants that can be applied to a site in one year.
Example 5.10  Calculation of the Annual Whole Sludge Application Rate (AWSAR)
Sewage sludge to be applied to land contains the 8 of the 9 regulated metals. The pollutant concentrations (mg/kg 
dry weight) are given in the table below. The APLR values come from Table 5.8.
The Annual Whole Sludge Application Rate (AWSAR) for each pollutant is calculated using
AWSAR =
APLR
0.001C
where 	
AWSAR = Annual whole sludge application rate (tonne dry sludge/ha-yr) 
	
APLR = Annual pollutant loading rate (kg/ha-yr) 
	
C = Metal concentration (mg metal/kg dry sludge) 
	
0.001 = conversion factor (1000 kg  = 1 tonne)
The AWSAR for the sludge is the lowest of the individual AWSARs calculated for the 10 regulated metals. The lowest 
AWSAR is copper (Cu). The limit is 20 tonne/ha-yr (410 lb/ft2-yr).

The Risk Assessment Assumptions
The chapter introduction stated that the simplified model of the real world that we call risk assessment 
relies on many assumptions and subjective judgments. The models are vulnerable to error caused by 
gaps between the model and reality.

Risk Assessment
The land application risk analysis offers interesting points for discussion because there are multiple 
pathways and multiple pollutants and the fate of metals in soils is complicated. The available data is often 
less than one would like, leading to numerous assumptions and approximations.
The following are considered to be weaknesses in the EPA’s risk assessment method (Harrison et al.1999).
Cancer risk was determined to be the most significant risk and the acceptable level was set at 1 in 10,000. 
The drinking water standards use a risk level of 1 in 1,000,000.
The risk assessment does not take into account the additive risk of exposure by multiple pathways, such 
as drinking water plus vegetables grown in sludge-amended soil. Likewise, it does not take into account 
the additive risk of consuming more than one of the regulated metals. Each may be at a no effect level, 
but this may not be true for the combination. The risk was calculated using the ‘acceptable risk’ for 
individual pathways and individual metals. An additive approach is usually used in other situations.
The regulations allow sludge application until each metal reaches the maximum level. The groundwater 
level could be pushed to the maximum along with the level on cropland. Without a very strong 
understanding of the pathways and processes, allowing the pollutants to reach maximum acceptable 
levels may be unwise.
As our understanding of pathways and impacts increases it may be desirable to reduce the acceptable 
values. (Levels for lead have decreased over the years.) Once the metals are in the soil, remediation is 
difficult.
The groundwater pathway is to protect a shallow well immediately downstream of a sludge field. 
The calculation assumes a large reduction of the peak metal concentration, through dilution or soil 
attenuation, by the time the leachate reaches the well. Groundwater contamination may be of concern 
where land spreading covers large areas, but not in the home garden setting.
The potential for a child to ingest sludge is much greater for sludge used by residential gardens that for 
sludge applied to field corn and the restrictions could be adjusted for this. At this time, an EQ sludge 
can be applied without any record keeping.
The ingestion rates may be too low. The soil ingestion rate of a child was taken as 200 mg/day (about the 
weight of an aspirin tablet). This may be low, and there may be inadvertent ingestion through a lifetime. 
There are estimates of 50–200 mg/day ingestion for adults.

Risk Assessment
Plant uptake of metals depends on soil pH, soil moisture, cation-exchange capacity, and other factors. 
It can be highly variable and it is not well understood. (Cadmium uptake rates used by the EPA vary 
by a factor of 10,000.)
Synthetic organic chemicals and radioactivity are not considered.

Conclusion
These are some general lessons regarding toxic chemicals in the environment.
The possible pathways through the environment are so subtle and numerous that even when we are alert 
to possible harmful effects we may not correctly predict where and when the substance could reach a 
harmful level.
We can use analogy and similarity between chemical families to try and foresee troublesome environmental 
routes, but we dare not rely only on these analogies to suggest that a substance is safe.
We can make statements about the concentration of materials in a local environment, or about the 
solubility of a substance, but the dynamic character of the environment makes it risky to assume 
equilibrium conditions or uniform distributions.

Promoting Public Health and Happiness
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social 
well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Access to safe drinking water is fundamental 
for health and happiness, a basic human right, and a component of effective policy for health protection.
The routes of disease transmission are broken by sanitation in food processing, wastewater treatment to 
reduce the pathogen discharge into rivers and lakes, filtration and disinfection of drinking water to kill 
pathogens, and managing the water cycle to protect sources of drinking water.
Safe drinking water presents no significant risk to health over a lifetime of consumption, including groups 
with different sensitivities. Those at greatest risk of waterborne disease are infants and young children, 
people who are debilitated or living under unsanitary conditions and the elderly.
A properly designed and well-operated drinking water treatment system is in force one hundred percent 
of the time for everyone in the service area. It will simultaneously protect all consumers against many 
different kinds of pathogens, including threats that may be unidentified.

An Important Public Health Event
A cholera epidemic in London in 1854 led to the discovery by Dr. John Snow that disease could be 
spread by contaminated water. The germ theory of disease had not yet been developed, so Snow did 
not understand the mechanism by which the disease was transmitted. He was a skeptic of the then-
dominant miasma theory that stated that diseases such as cholera and bubonic plague were caused by 
a noxious form of “bad air”. His simple, but brilliant, removal of the handle to the Broad Street water 
pump stopped the epidemic.
His observation of the evidence led him to discount the theory of foul air. In 1849 he published his theory 
in an essay, On the Mode of Communication of Cholera, in which he stated these conclusions about cholera.
•	 Cholera was not likely transmitted through the air via miasmas.
•	 Cholera was likely transmitted through something eaten or drunk.
•	 The ferocious diarrhea that characterized cholera was likely a factor in the spread.
•	 Pollution of wells and other water supplies produced outbreaks.
•	 Cholera was likely due to some parasite or other tiny germ.

Waterborne Microbial Diseases
Snow wrote in a letter to the editor of the Medical Times and Gazette:
“…I found that nearly all the deaths had taken place within a short distance of the [Broad 
Street] pump. There were only ten deaths in houses situated decidedly nearer to another 
street-pump. In five of these cases the families of the deceased persons informed me that they 
always went to the pump in Broad Street, as they preferred the water to that of the pumps 
which were nearer. In three other cases, the deceased were children who went to school near 
the pump in Broad Street…
With regard to the deaths occurring in the locality belonging to the pump, there were 61 
instances in which I was informed that the deceased persons used to drink the pump water 
from Broad Street, either constantly or occasionally…
The result of the inquiry, then, is, that there has been no particular outbreak or prevalence of 
cholera in this part of London except among the persons who were in the habit of drinking 
the water of the above-mentioned pump well.
I had an interview with the Board of Guardians of St James’s parish, on the evening of the 7th inst  
[Sept 7], and represented the above circumstances to them. In consequence of what I said, the 
handle of the pump was removed on the following day.”

Waterborne Microbial Diseases
Snow used a dot map (Figure 6.1 is a modern version) to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around 
the pump. His use of statistics to illustrate the connection between the water source and cholera cases 
was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is the founding event of the science 
of epidemiology.
Cholera is an infectious disease that affects the absorption of water in the small intestine. It is caused 
by the bacterium, Vibrio cholera. In severe cases it produces violent diarrhea within only a few days. 
The dangerous aspect of cholera is the vast and rapid loss of fluid that if untreated can be fatal within 
24 hours of developing the disease. Treatment is simple: replace the fluid with the right mix of sugar 
and salts – water alone is not adequately absorbed. Bad cases require admission to hospital where fluids 
can be administered straight into the bloodstream via a drip. Cholera is related to standards of hygiene 
and the quality of drinking water. This is true of many other serious diseases. Improved sanitation and 
hygiene are still the basic foundation of the fight against waterborne diseases. It is more cost-effective 
than putting people in hospitals.
Waterborne disease was still a problem in the United States in the early 1900s. One in 10 infants died in 
their first year of life from typhoid fever or diarrheal disease, including cholera. One cause was known 
to be unsafe water and chlorine was thought to be the solution. John Snow had used chlorine in London 
and the first patent for a chlorination system in the U.S. was granted in 1888.

But how much chlorine? A dose that would make water safe in one location would be too weak in 
another. Abel Wolman worked out the chemistry that let treatment plant operators inject the effective 
dose of chlorine and chlorination rapidly became a widespread practice (Okun 1971). The number of 
typhoid cases fell from 16.2 per 100,000 in 1913 to 2.5 in 1936. It has been estimated that chlorination 
has saved 179 million lives.
6.3	
Water-borne Infectious Microorganisms
Fortunately, most bacteria and other microbes do not cause disease. Most – in the sense of number of 
species and mass – are beneficial.
 ‘You are mostly not you. That is to say, 90 percent of the cells residing in your body are not human cells. 
They are microbes…. These bacteria that live on us and in us, aid our digestion and help defend us from 
pathogens. A healthy biota in our guts make the pH inhospitable and even toxic to many pathogens 
(Buhler 2011).’
This section is mostly about water-borne bacterial disease, with brief attention to a few viruses and 
protozoans. Water-related parasitic diseases, like malaria, yellow fever, schistosomiasis (bilharzia), and 
trypanosome, are not discussed.
The human body is a comfortable environment for many pathogens, especially those of the gastrointestinal 
tract that pass from infected individuals into the food supply or water supply and cause disease when 
exposure exceeds a person’s limit of tolerance. Most pathogens do not survive long once outside the 
body, but they may live long enough to be transmitted to a new host. To prevent disease we must block 
transmission, increase the rate of pathogen die-off and dilution, and effectively kill the pathogens. Water 
borne pathogens can infect thousands of people simultaneously, which creates an unmanageable burden 
for health care facilities. Engineered preventive medicine is much preferred to letting people get sick and 
then hoping that the medical profession can cure them.

Waterborne Microbial Diseases
Organism
Reason for concern
Protozoan pathogens
Endamoeba hystolytica
Amoebic dysentery. Endemic cases are by personal contact, food, and possibly flies. 
Rare epidemics are waterborne.
Cryptosporidium parvum
Cryptosporidiosis is an acute gastrointestinal illness, including diarrhea, nausea, and 
stomach cramps. As few as 30 oocysts can cause infection. Can be fatal in individuals 
with weakened immune systems. Waterborne from animals to man. Cysts are resistant 
to chlorination, but they can be removed from water by coagulation-sedimentation-
filtration.
Giardia duodenalis
Formerly known as Giardia lamblia. Giardiasis causes diarrhea. Waterborne from 
animals (beavers, cats, dogs, sheep) to man. Forms cysts that are resistant to 
chlorination. As few as 10 to 25 cysts can cause infection, but they can be removed 
from water by coagulation-sedimentation-filtration.
Bacterial pathogens
Escherichia coli
There are several strains of E. coli that cause diarrhea. E. coli O157:H7 causes 
hemorrhagic colitis that can be fatal.
Leptospira sp.
Causes Leptospirosis, a flu-like disease in the early stages, which may become more 
serious and even fatal in advanced cases. Transmitted via animal urine. Can be 
waterborne.
Salmonella typhi
Typhoid fever. Only lives in humans. Spread only fecally-orally via food and water. 
Infectious dose is below 1000 organisms and may be below 10 organisms.
Salmonella paratyphi
Paratyphoid fever. Only lives in humans. Spread only fecally-orally via food and water.
Shigella dysenteriae
Causes severe and possibly fatal diarrhea only in humans and primates. Highly 
infectious by fecal-oral route via water, milk, food, flies, or direct contact. Up to 109 
viable organisms per gram of feces in the early stages of infection.
Vibrio cholera
Cholera. Initial wave of epidemic is waterborne; secondary cases by contact, food, flies.
Viral pathogens
Poliovirus
Infectious dose is around 105 to 106 infectious particles. Causes aseptic meningitis, 
encephalitis, and paralytic poliomyelitis. Infection is usually by ingestion of fecally 
contaminated material.
Hepatitis A
Viral hepatitis – liver damage. Humans are considered the only host.
Hepatitis E
Viruses are acquired orally. Hepatitis E appears to be exclusively spread by drinking 
water
Rotavirus, Adenovirus
Viral gastroenteritis causes 3 to 5 billion cases and up to 10 million deaths per year, 
mostly in infants and young children due to dehydration from to diarrhea and 
vomiting.
Enterovirus
Subgroups are Poliovirus, Coxsackie virus A & B, Echovirus, and Enterovirus.

Waterborne Microbial Diseases
It has been estimated that known pathogens accounted for an estimated 38.6 million illnesses each year 
in the United States due to known pathogens from all exposures, including food, water and other routes. 
It was estimated that 5.2 million cases are from bacterial pathogens; 2.5 million are due to parasites, and 
30.9 million due to viral pathogens (Soller 2006, USEPA 2010).
Of those 38.6 million, 13.8 million were thought to be foodborne, leaving 24.8 million illnesses that 
were due to waterborne routes and other exposures. About 9% were protozoans (Cryptosporidium and 
Giardia), which are waterborne. Less than 3% were due to bacterial infection, and the rest were viral 
diseases (55.6% Norwalk-like viruses, and 15.6% Rotavirus). Norwalk viruses are transmitted by fecally 
contaminated food or water, and by person-to-person contact, and via aerosols. They are the most 
common cause of viral gastroenteritis. Rotavirus enters the body through the mouth via contaminated 
food or water, and is easily spread by contaminated objects, such as hands and toys. It is very contagious 
and spreads from child-to-child.
Table 6.1 lists bacteria, viruses, and protozoans that must be controlled in order to have safe drinking 
water. The WHO Guidelines (2011) include fact sheets on these organisms that explain their role in 
water-borne disease.

Waterborne Microbial Diseases
Waterborne transmission of the pathogens listed has been confirmed by epidemiological studies and case 
histories. Part of the demonstration of pathogenicity involves reproducing the disease in suitable hosts. 
Experimental studies in which volunteers are exposed to known numbers of pathogens provide relative 
information. As most studies are done with healthy adult volunteers, such data are applicable to only a 
part of the exposed population, and extrapolation to more sensitive groups is an issue that remains to 
be studied in more detail.
6.4	
Risk Assessment for Pathogenic Organisms
The WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO 2011) explain how the risk assessment methods 
behind the guidelines for microbiological quality bring together the data collected on pathogen exposure, 
dose-response, severity and disease burden.
The use of ‘guidelines’, as opposed to ‘standards’ or ‘mandatory limits’, is in recognition that while the 
minimum requirements for safety are universal, the nature and form of drinking water standards may 
vary among countries.
Risk assessment for pathogenic organisms is not as well developed a science as risk assessment for 
carcinogens and other toxic chemicals. The infective dose is hard to determine, but estimates have been 
made.
Pathogen doses are inherently discrete. Chemical doses are expressed in mass units (e.g., mg/kg or 
mg/L). Pathogen doses are expressed as counts of organisms per volume of water (e.g., count/liter) or 
as an average dose.
Drinking water exposures are usually low, often below 0.0001 organisms per liter. For low exposure, the 
maximum risk of infection is related to the probability of exposure. If the average dose was 0.0001 and 
the pathogen was 100% effective in causing an infection, one individual out of 10,000 exposed would 
become infected, on average.
The organism count has a distribution of values. Not every liter of water contains the average count; some 
contain more and some less. The distribution of counts often has a Poisson probability distribution. This 
means that for an average dose of 0.5 organisms per liter, 60% of one-liter portions contain no organisms, 
30% contain a single organism, and 10% contain 2 or more.
The exponential model estimates the probability of being infected from ingestion of one organism as
p(d) = 1–e–rd

The probability of infection can be estimated as the product of the exposure from drinking water and 
the probability that exposure to one organism would result in infection. Not all infected individuals 
will develop clinical illness; asymptomatic infection is common for most pathogens. The percentage of 
infected persons that will develop clinical illness depends on the pathogen, but also on other factors, 
such as the immune status of the host.

The DALY Metric for Evaluating Public Health Risk
WHO (2011) has used DALYs to evaluate public health priorities. A DALY is a Disability Adjusted Life 
Year and it is equivalent to one year of healthy life lost due to a health condition. It aggregates different 
effects and combines quality and quantity of life. It focuses on actual rather than potential hazards and 
promotes rational public health priority setting. The difficulties in using DALYs relate to availability of 
data on exposure and on epidemiological associations.
The basic principle of the DALY is to weight each health effect for its severity from 0 (normal good 
health) to 1 (death). This weight is multiplied by the duration of the effect and by the number of people 
affected by a particular outcome. It is then possible to sum the effects of all different outcomes due to a 
particular agent. The duration is the time during which disease is apparent. When the outcome is death, 
the “duration” is the remaining life expectancy.
The DALY is the sum of years of life lost by premature mortality (YLL) and years lived with a disability 
(YLD), which are standardized by means of severity weights. Thus:
	
	
DALY = YLL + YLD

This reflects the acute end-points (e.g., diarrhoeal illness) and also mortality and the effects of more 
serious end-points. Disease burden per case varies widely. For example, the disease burden per 1000 
cases of rotavirus diarrhea is 480 DALYs in low-income regions, where child mortality is frequent, but 
only 14 DALYs per 1000 cases in high-income regions where hospital facilities are accessible to the great

Table 6.3 Method for linking tolerable disease burden and source water quality for reference pathogens: example calculation for 
an acceptable disease burden of 1 × 10-6 DALYs per year. No accounting is made for effects on immune-compromised persons (e.g., 
cryptosporidiosis in HIV/AIDS patients), which is significant in some countries. 
Example 6.2 Risk of illness for Cryptosporidium
The numbers in Table 6.3 can be interpreted to represent the probability that a single individual will develop illness 
in a given year. For example, a risk of diarrhoeal illness for Cryptosporidium p. of 0.00064 per year indicates that, on 
average, 1 out of 1560 consumers would contract Cryptosporidiosis from drinking water, assuming the raw water 
quality of 10 organisms per liter.

Risk of infection per year = (365 day/yr)(0.00063 org/day)(0.004/org) = 0.00092 per year
	
Risk of diarrhoeal illness = 0.7(0.00092 per year) = 0.00064 per year
	
Disease burden = (0.00064 per year)(0.0015 DALYS per case) = 1 x 10-6 DALYs per year

Drinking Water Treatment and Disinfection
We do not like to think of our drinking water as recycled sewage, but most of it has been used many 
times. The reuse cycle is to take water from a river, lake or well, treat it in a drinking water purification 
plant, process the used water through a wastewater treatment plant, discharge the treated effluent (usually 
to a river where additional purification occurs), and once again through a drinking water purification 
plant. Wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment both include disinfection. Disinfection is not 
sterilization; it is not designed to kill all microorganisms in the water.
Public water supplies were always desired by cities but drinking water treatment to prevent disease was 
not common until nearly the 20th century. Until 1870 no water filtration plants existed in the United 
States. In the 1870s, slow sand filters were built in Poughkeepsie and Hudson, NY, followed by those at 
Lawrence, MA in 1893. Slow sand filters will remove bacteria, protozoa, parasites, and also turbidity. 
By 1897, 100 more slow sand filters had been built, and by 1925, 587 rapid sand filters and more than 
1090 slow sand filters were delivering about 19 million m3/d (5 billion gallons per day) of safe water to 
city dwellers. This greatly reduced the incidence of diseases like cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery 
among the people served.
At the turn of the 20th century a great step forward came about through chlorination for bacterial 
disinfection. Chlorination does not kill all microorganisms in water, but it is very effective against water-
borne pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Chlorination subsequently became the universal resort of the 
sanitarian, both in water and sewage treatment. Pasteurization of milk became widely used at about the 
same time. The dramatic historical decrease in typhoid fever is due to these two factors.
Drinking water purification involves a sequence of steps to remove turbidity, hardness, or unpleasant 
tastes and odors. The final step before distribution to the consumer is disinfection, usually with chlorine. 
Water that is safe for drinking when it leaves the treatment plant has to be kept safe until it reaches the 
consumer. A low concentration of chlorine is maintained in the water as it travels through the mains 
to protect against recontamination.
Disinfection effectiveness depends on the form and concentration of chlorine, time of contact, pH 
and temperature of the water, and species of organism to be inactivated. Most important is the time-
concentration (Ct) factor. This is captured in Chick’s Law (Chick 1908, Okun 1971). Chick’s law defines 
the fraction of organisms inactivated as

Nt and N0 are the bacterial concentrations at times t and t = 0, C is the disinfectant concentration or 
intensity, t is the time of contact or exposure to the disinfectant, and k is a rate coefficient that depends 
on temperature, pH, and type of organism.
For a contact basin of fixed volume (fixed contact time) the most practical control is variation of the 
concentration or intensity. The job can be done with intense exposure (high concentration of chlorine 
or intense UV radiation) and a short contact time, or with low exposure for a longer time. Figure 6.3 
shows the Ct requirements for 99% kill of bacteria, virus and protozoa. Table 6.4 provides more detailed 
information. Higher pH requires a higher Ct ; lower temperature requires a higher Ct.

Figure 6.3 The colored bands show the Ct required for 99% kill or inactivation of bacteria, virus

Chlorine (Cl2) is applied as a gas dissolved in water. The Cl2 reacts with water to form hypochlorous 
acid (HOCl) and hypochlorite (OCl–). Both forms, known as free chlorine, are powerful disinfectants.
Free chlorine will react with ammonia to form the chloramines, NH2Cl and NHCl2. These are called 
combined chlorine. Combined chlorine is a less powerful disinfectant than free chlorine, but it is more 
persistent and this makes it desirable as a residual in the water distribution system.

Example 6.3 Ct values as a function of temperature.
Inactivation is proportional to Ct. Table 6.4 indicates that 99% inactivation of Giardia with ozone when pH is in the 
range of 6-9 requires Ct = 1.9 at 1°C and Ct = 0.63 at 15°C.  
For an ozone contact chamber of fixed contact time t the ozone concentration at 1°C must be 3 times larger than at

Animal Waste Management
Animal waste contamination of drinking water and recreational water is a serious threat in many parts 
of the world, including the many rich agricultural areas of the United States. Animal waste management 
has often been careless but new awareness of the transmission of disease, especially protozoans like 
Cryptosporidium, make this an important problem.

Waterborne Microbial Diseases
Figure 6.4 shows stream-loading scenarios from livestock pens and pasture. Direct contamination occurs 
when fresh undiluted fecal material is deposited into a water body. Indirect contamination occurs during 
transport from adjacent land into a water body via rainfall runoff. The distinction between direct and 
indirect contamination is that the source material for direct contamination is feces from an individual 
or individuals; for indirect contamination the source material of interest is a composite of many animals.
Quantitative risk assessment on freshwater impacted by agricultural sources of fecal contamination 
assumed that fresh cattle manure, pig slurry, and poultry litter (fecal materials) are land-applied at 
standard agronomic (maximum U.S. allowable) rates adjacent to a freshwater beach; pathogens from the 
fresh land-applied fecal materials reach the freshwater beach via runoff from an intense rainfall event. 
There is primary contact recreation (e.g., swimming) in the undiluted runoff; and exposure to reference 
pathogens occurs through water ingestion during recreation. Taken together, these conditions maximize 
the risk of infection.
The load of organisms entering a water body is estimated for each pathogenic species or indicator 
organism of interest using

fi = fraction of organism i on land mobilized during the entire event
	
ni = density of organism i in the land-applied manure (organisms/mass)
	
Mmanure = mass of manure applied to the plot generating the runoff
This mass of organisms is used to estimate a concentration at the swimming area. The runoff is diluted 
in the stream or lake and there will be some die-off between the point of entry and the swimming area. 
The resulting concentration, along with the volume of water ingested by a swimmer (Figure 6.5), gives 
the dose that would be used to estimate the cumulative risk of infection in the exposed population. The 
risk is calculated using the Beta-Poisson dose-response model as illustrated in Section 6.4.

The mass of manure applied to the land and the net runoff during the storm are known more precisely 
than the other values. The density of organisms and species depends on the kind of animals and their 
pathogen shedding abundance. The fraction of organisms mobilized depends on the rainfall intensity, 
rainfall duration, antecedent soil moisture, how the manure was incorporated into the soil, and vegetation 
protecting the soil and the stream bank.

Waterborne Microbial Diseases
A single value estimate of the risk of infection has little meaning in the face of so many highly variable 
factors (rainfall, manure applications, amount of runoff, etc.) and so many uncertainties in microbial 
densities, fraction mobilized, die-off, dilution, and the like. A useful approach to risk assessment in this 
situation is to calculate thousands of risk estimates using values selected at random from the range of 
realistic possibilities. This method is called Monte Carlo simulation because the element of random 
selection in each estimation can be imagined as a computerized spin of a roulette wheel or a toss of the 
dice. Sometimes you lose and get sick – sometimes you win and stay healthy.
The Monte Carlo results shown in Figure 6.6 are the additive risks due the five major pathogens (E. 
coli 0157, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia). The horizontal line is the risk of 
infection (about 1 in 50) for the current recreational water quality criteria.
The bars in the boxes indicate the median of all the simulated estimates, which are about 0.0001 for 
chicken litter, 0.01 for pig slurry, and about 0.02 for cattle manure. The boxes bound the middle 50% of 
the simulated values. The bars on the extended lines bound 99% of the estimated values.
The analysis shows that there is about a 40% chance that the current recreational water quality criteria 
(RWAC) will be exceeded for cattle manure. The probability of exceeding the RWAC is roughly 25% for 
pig slurry, and perhaps 5% chance for chicken litter.
If these odds are unacceptable then better management methods are needed for handling animal manure.

Natural Die-Off of Microorganisms
The purity of drinking water in United States cities is so excellent it is easy to overlook the need for 
protecting water supplies in rural areas, and this includes vast parts of the world where safe drinking 
water is lacking and where even a decent volume of contaminated water may come at a high price. 
Contamination by animals can be a serious problem, and the microbial agents of disease, once in a water 
supply can persist. Table 6.5 summarizes some of these concerns.

Waterborne Microbial Diseases
Conditions in conventional wastewater treatment processes are not hospitable to most pathogens, so 
they tend to die away. Disinfection of sewage effluents is required nationwide. This requirement may 
be waived during cold weather in northern states when contact water sports are not being enjoyed. The 
predominant method of wastewater disinfection is with ultraviolet light, which has mostly replaced 
chlorination.
Effluent discharged to a river or lake is diluted and the pathogen concentration is further decreased by 
die-off due to dilute food supply, cool temperature, and sunlight. Thus, wastewater treatment, dilution, 
and natural die-off can reduce the pathogen population to a level that leaves the water clean enough for 
recreational use, and clean enough to be used as a source for drinking water, provided that adequate 
additional water purification is done.

Management of Sludge Applications to Land
Land application of wastewater sludge is widely used. The pathogen levels in typical anaerobically 
digested sludge are: virus = 100–1,000 per 100 mL, fecal coliform bacteria = 30,000–6,000,000 per 100 
mL, Salmonella bacteria = 3–60 per 100 mL. These levels can be greatly reduced by composting, or by 
holding the sludge at high temperature or high pH for a specified time and this broadens the possible 
ways for using the material as a soil amendment. The Part 503 sludge regulations specify the treatment 
conditions for making exceptional quality sludge that can be applied freely as a soil conditioner.

Waterborne Microbial Diseases
Generally these microorganisms do not leach through the soil, unless it is sandy or unless the distance 
between the sewage discharge and the drinking water supply is too short. Viruses are too small to be 
removed by filtration in soil interstices, but they will be removed by adsorption. Reduced survival is 
caused by high temperature, low moisture content, low organic content, high or low pH, the presence 
of predators, and decreased adsorption to soil particles. Following land application, a 99% reduction is 
expected for Salmonella spp. in 12 days and for fecal coliforms in 18 days.
Well water is protected by separating wells and septic tanks by at least 15 meters (50 ft), and by locating 
the well upstream from the septic tank (upstream as viewed by the flow of groundwater). Additional 
protection can be obtained by filtering the water as it leaves the tap in the home.
Protection against runoff to streams and lakes is provided by 25 m to 150 m grassy buffer strips between 
the treated field and the waterway.
6.10	
Monitoring the Microbial Quality of Drinking Water
One might reasonably expect that the presence of pathogens would be determined by measuring the 
number of pathogens in samples of the drinking water. There are problems with this approach. Some 
pathogens are difficult to grow in the laboratory. Others can be grown and identified in the laboratory, 
but we have no good quantitative test for population density. Some, like Cryptosporidium spores, can 
be seen easily under a microscope, but we have no simple and reliable way of telling whether the spores 
are able to reproduce and infect. One might also question the wisdom of growing pathogens in a water 
purification plant laboratory.
Water safety is monitored by quantifying indicator organisms that have a life-cycle and sensitivity to 
environmental factors that are approximately the same as pathogens. As a practical matter, if the indicator 
organisms are absent in a water supply, pathogens are also absent and the water is safe to drink. The 
important indicator organisms are listed in Table 6.7.
Organism
Description
Coliform bacteria
A grouping of many bacteria that are commonly found in soil and in the feces of humans, 
birds, and animals. Used as an indicator of the hygienic quality of water. An absence of 
coliforms indicates a presumptive absence of pathogenic bacteria.
Escherichia coli
The predominant species of coliforms found in the human gut in temperate climates. May 
survive and grow in pristine waters in the tropics.
Fecal coliforms
Sub-group of coliforms that originate in the intestinal tract of warm-blooded animals. 
Provides a more specific indication of fecal contamination than the total coliform screening.
Fecal streptococci

Waterborne Microbial Diseases
One gram of feces from a healthy human contains billions of harmless bacteria of many different kinds 
and possibly some pathogenic bacteria. The number of infected people in a normal healthy population 
who are shedding pathogens in their feces is small. The sewage from these infected individuals contains 
relatively few pathogens. Looking for pathogens is a “needle in the haystack” problem.
A useful indicator organism should:
•	 Be absent in unpolluted water and present when a source of pathogenic microorganisms is 
present.
•	 Be present in greater numbers than the pathogenic microorganisms.
•	 Respond to natural environmental conditions and water treatment processes in a manner 
similar to the pathogenic microorganisms.
•	 Be easy to isolate, identify and enumerate.
The coliform group of bacteria is the most commonly used indicator of bacterial water pollution and 
drinking water safety. Total coliform refers to a group of bacteria, many of which are harmless and 
originate in soil and animals and not in human feces. Fecal coliforms come from the intestinal tract 
of warm-blooded animals. The dominant intestinal coliform in temperate climates is E. coli. Another 
useful indicator is fecal streptococci, which are native to the gut of warm-blooded animals. Any of these 
may be used as indicator organisms. Note that none of these is a pathogen, except for certain virulent 
strains of E. coli.
We will skip the details of the test procedures and just say that the simplest test is for total coliforms. A 
positive test (coliforms are present) is presumptive evidence of contamination. A second stage of testing 
can be done for confirmation. These tests are quantitative. Bacterial counts are reported as the most 
probable number of coliforms per 100 milliliter (mL).
The USEPA limit for wastewater effluents is less than 400 fecal coliforms per 100 mL.
The USEPA Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) is zero coliforms. The Maximum Contaminant 
Level (the enforceable limit) is that no more than 5% of samples can be coliform-positive in a month. 
The numbers of samples that must be analyzed increases as the population served by the water utility 
increases. Every sample that has total coliforms must be analyzed for fecal coliforms. There can be no 
fecal coliforms of E. coli. These limits apply to water in the distribution system (EPA Drinking Water 
Quality Standards website).
The WHO guideline is that total coliform bacteria should not be detected in any 100 mL sample collected 
from the distribution system.

Conclusion
Microbial diseases, many of them water-borne, sicken and kill millions of people each year. The technology 
exists to cheaply and easily reduce this terrible number. Some of the solutions depend on the input of 
money to build water purification plants, but many do not. Simply better managing the disposal of 
human and animal wastes would be a big step.
This is a worthy challenge to raise the level of health and happiness in the world.

The Fate of Pollutants in Air
7	 The Fate of Pollutants in Air
7.1	
Introduction
Pollutants may be discharged to a body of water (lake, stream, estuary, or ocean), into the atmosphere, onto 
the land, into the groundwater, or deposited underground. After discharge a pollutant will be transported by 
water or air and it will be diluted and dispersed. So the fate of pollutants, once discharged, can be complicated.
The objective of this chapter is to explain some basic problems and mechanisms about the fate of pollutants 
in air and how that fate is modeled. Chapter 8 does the same for the fate of pollutants in water, and 
Chapter 9 is about the fate of pollutants in soil and groundwater. A few simple equations and calculations 
are used, but a detailed description of complex models is beyond our scope.
In theory, a mathematical model can be constructed to predict the fate of any pollutant anywhere in the 
air or in a river or lake for existing or proposed emissions or discharges. In practice, building a model 
that adequately represents reality is often limited by the data that are available to verify the model. This 
chapter will give an idea of the complexities of developing environmental fate and transport models.
A useful model takes into account the variation in local conditions (stream flow, temperature, etc.); the 
specific pollutants and their tendency to react, adsorb, volatilize, or deposit; the existing ambient conditions 
and environmental quality; and the likely future development that could add pollution load or new 
environmental stress. In short, the model must capture all of the important characteristics of the receiving 
environment and the possible effects of specific pollutants on the flora and fauna in that environment.
The USEPA provides a variety of free modeling software packages for estimating how chemical and 
biological reactions, adsorption, and sedimentation will change the concentration of pollutants in streams, 
or groundwater, or air currents. Free software does not mean that modeling is cheap. Information costs 
money. Expertise will be needed in chemistry, biology, hydrology, hydrogeology, soil science, statistics, 
and computing. Expertise costs money.
7.2	
Natural and Engineered Systems
Natural systems are deceptively simple and deceptively complex. There are no obvious networks of pipes and 
pumps and heat exchangers, or valves and thermometers and pressure gauges, or mechanics with oilcans, 
or operators watching computers. Still, all the manipulations an engineer could make in a processing plant 
are made in a natural system. There are conveyance systems and pumps, feedback loops, self-adjusting 
mechanisms, amplifiers, and shock absorbers. It is just hard to see where and how it happens. It is hard to 
model natural systems, and it is hard to change a system when we don’t like what is happening.

The Fate of Pollutants in Air
Table 7.1 lists some of the differences between natural and engineered systems. The two that dominate 
are variability and uncontrollability.
Natural Systems
(atmosphere, rives, lakes, estuaries, oceans)
Engineered Systems
(separation and transformation processes)
Understanding may require knowledge of hydrology, 
geology, meteorology, biology, ecology, microbiology, 
chemistry, thermodynamics, hydraulics
Understanding may require knowledge of hydraulics, 
thermodynamics, chemistry, microbiology
Complex flow patterns
Simple flow pattern
Small differences in density may be important in 
determining direction of flow and mixing
Mixing dominated by mechanical means. Density 
differences of fluids are usually not important. (see note a)
Variations may be extreme (i.e., maximum river flow 
= 100 times minimum river flow; maximum and 
minimum temperatures differ by 60°C; wind velocities 
from 0 to 150 km/hr)
Variations generally are within known limits and are small 
in comparison to possible natural variations.
Variations are seasonal and diurnal
Variations are seasonal and diurnal; shift related in industry 
(see note a)
Variations may be random (accidents, floods, 
hurricanes, etc.)
Variations may be random (accidental spills,) equipment 
failure, etc.)
System can be monitored, but control (e.g. reservoir 
operation) may be restricted or absent.
System can be monitored (flow rates, temperature, pH, 
etc.) and controlled (pumping, heating, pH adjustment, 
etc.)
Chemical transformations controlled by natural 
conditions. Transformations by living organisms may 
dominate.
Chemical transformations can be controlled by addition 
of reagents and catalysts, and by intentional changes 
in temperature and pressure. Living organisms may be 
involved, but in controlled conditions.
Flow of energy is controlled by solar radiation, wind, 
etc.
Flow of energy can be controlled by heating and cooling, 
and by pumping.
Gravity and meteorological conditions control the flow 
of material. Transport is usually is in the atmosphere or 
in open channels (exception is groundwater).
Gravity, pumping liquids, and compressing gases control 
the flow of material. Transport is usually in pipes and 
conduits.
Biology – micro and macro-
Biology – usually microbial
Chemistry – organic and inorganic
Chemistry – organic and inorganic
‘Reactor’ or ‘process’ is a large volume or area that 
is not naturally homogeneous. The complex real 
system usually must be subdivided into more nearly 
homogeneous compartments or cells.
Reactor is reasonably homogeneous or can be mixed to 
make it so. (see note b)
Table 7.1 Comparison of natural and engineered systems.
(a) Diurnal change in municipal wastewater flow and strength is 3-fold to 5-fold (more if storm water is entering the sewer system). 
Seasonal change in wastewater temperature in Wisconsin (for example) is 10–15°C.
(b) Landfill is an engineered system that is in many ways like a natural system. It is connected to soil, groundwater, and atmosphere. 
Reactions are at ambient temperature; can be monitored but control is limited once constructed.

Global Dispersion of Pollutants
Air pollutants can travel around the globe and do damage on a global scale. One example is the damage 
to the ozone layer; another is greenhouse gases and climate change.
Figure 7.1 shows how rapidly sulfur dioxide was dispersed after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo on June 
15, 1991. The eruption ejected roughly 10,000,000,000 tonnes of magma, and 20,000,000 tonnes of SO2. 
Over the following months, the aerosols formed a global layer of sulfuric acid haze. Global temperatures 
dropped by about 0.5°C (0.9°F), and ozone depletion temporarily increased (Wikipedia).
These global issues are important, but this chapter will focus on local and regional conditions.

Dispersion of Air Pollutants
Different mixing patterns of pollutants in air give rise to different problems. There can be important 
near-field toxic effects, such as tetraethyl lead in automobile exhaust fumes and carcinogens in diesel 
exhausts. An industrial exhaust of a toxic chemical could be drawn into the ventilation system of an 
adjacent building, or it could move near ground level and cause a health threat to the local population.
Far-field effects might be dioxins adsorbed onto particles and then deposited at a great distance, or very 
fine particles, which are a health threat, migrating from industrial areas to suburban and rural areas.
Ozone is a special case. It is not emitted. It forms in the atmosphere, usually at some distance from the 
source of the ozone initiators.

Bx & Br Chap 7 – Figure 7.2
Figure 7.2 Bouyant plume rise and dispersion of stack emissions. The 
height of plume rise depends on the temperatures of the ambient air 
and the gaseous emission. For power plants and many other industries 
the emission is warm and will rise above the stack, thus giving an 
effective stack height that exceeds the actual height. (Photo credit:

The Fate of Pollutants in Air
How a pollutant moves – upward and away from people or being trapped near the ground – and how it 
is diluted and dispersed are the subjects of air pollution modeling. Data are needed on wind speed and 
direction, air temperatures, and the physical and chemical characteristics of the pollutant. Because these 
factors may change during a day, and certainly will change during the year, predictions are made for a 
variety of conditions. Figure 7.2 shows the bouyant rise and dispersion of a stack emission.
7.5	
A Worst-Case Model for Pollutant Dispersion
It can be useful to do a simple screening analysis before making a more complete analysis. A worst-case 
analysis will quickly identify the order of magnitude of the expected concentrations and may even show 
that no problem exists.
Figure 7.3 is a highly simplified picture of a rectangular plume spreading downwind of the source. The 
plume is assumed to grow in proportion to the distance from the source. What makes this the ‘worst-
case’ estimate of ground level concentration is assuming that the pollutant concentration is uniform over 
the cross-section. The maximum concentration of a real plume is at the centerline of the plume and the 
ground level concentration is less.

W = 0.1x

H 
CWC =
Q
UHWCWWC
Figure 7.3 A worst-case analysis can be done using a highly 
simplified picture of a dispersion plume.
The release rate at the source is Q, with units of mass/time. The flux of pollutant through a cross-section 
at any distance x must equal the source release rate Q. As the plume moves it entrains more air and the 
mass of pollutant carried in 1 m3 of air near the source is diluted into a larger volume. The flow of air 
through a cross-section of area is UWH m3/s so the dilution from the near-source concentration is by 
a factor of 1/UWH.
The worst-case average concentrations downwind of a point source is
CWC =
Q
UHWCWWC
where 	 CWC = worst case concentration (mg/m3)
	
Q = source emission rate (mg/s)
	
x = distance from the source (m)
	
U = worst case wind speed at height z = 10 m, usually 1 m/s
	
WWC = worst case plume width (m); usually assume W = 0.1x
	
HWC = worst case plume depth (m); usually assume H = 50 m
This shows three fundamental conditions that must be satisfied by all plume models:
1.	 The mean concentration is inversely proportional to mean wind speed.
2.	 The mean concentration is directly proportional to the emission release rate.
3.	 The mean concentration is inversely proportional to the plume cross-sectional area.

The Fate of Pollutants in Air
Example 7.1 Worst-case Analysis of an Accidental Release of Chemical. 
A small amount, 0.9 kg (900,000 mg), of noxious chemical is accidentally released over a period of 30 minutes (1800 
sec). Assuming a light wind, say a velocity of U = 1 m/s, does this release pose any risk to the students in a school 
located 1000 m downwind? 
The release rate = Q = (900,000 mg)/(1800 s) = 500 mg/s
Worst-case wind velocity = U = 1 m/s
Worst-case plume height = HWC = 50 m
Worst case width of the width of the plume at the school = WWC = 0.1x = 0.1(1000 m) = 100 m
Cwc
Q
 =
(500 mg/s)
 = 0.1 mg/m3 = 100 μg/m3
UHWCWWC
(1 m/s)(50 m)(100m)
This can be compared to the acute toxicity standards for the chemical. Ammonia, for example, has a personal 
exposure limit  associated with negative health effects due to prolonged exposure of 33,000 µg/m3. If the chemical 
were ammonia we could safely say there is no risk and no more modeling is needed.
7.6	
The Gaussan Model for Air Pollutant Dispersion
The behavior of a real plume can include:
•	 Coning – in stable conditions the plumes enlarges in the shape of a cone; a major part of the 
pollutant may be carried a long distance before reaching the ground.
•	 Looping – Large eddies and strong winds cause both upward and downward movement; 
high ground level concentrations may occur near the stack.
•	 Fanning- Pollutants disperse at stack height, horizontally in the form of a fan.
•	 Fumigation – Upward movement is restricted by an inversion so the pollutants move 
downward. The resulting fumigation can cause high ground level concentrations.
•	 Lofting – Upward mixing is uninhibited and downward movement is restricted. Pollutants 
may be carry a very long distances with no significant effect at ground level.
The plume shown in Figure 7.2 is for stable conditions, and it can be predicted using the so-called 
Gaussian model. The peak concentrations are along the centerline of the plume and concentrations away 
from the centerline decrease to give a bell-shaped (Gaussian) distribution, as shown in Figure 7.4. Note 
that particulate pollutants may settle toward the ground and the change in concentration due to this 
effect is not accounted for in the model.

where	 C(x,y,z) = pollutant concentration in the plume at the point (x, y, z) from the source (µg/m3)
	
Q = emission rate of pollutants (µg/s)
	
h = actual stack height (m)
	
H = h + Δ = effective stack height (m)
	
Δ = rise of the buoyant plume above the stack (m)
	
x = distance directly downwind from the source (m)
	
y = lateral distance from the centerline (may be + or –) (m)

z – H = vertical distance of the plume from the centerline (m)
	
σy = lateral dispersion coefficient (standard deviation) (m)
and 	
σz = vertical dispersion coefficient (standard deviation) (m)
There are charts and empirical expressions for estimating σy and σz. One approach is based on turbulent 
wind speed fluctuations (turbulence intensities) in the z and y directions. The formulas are
sy = Iyx and sz = Izx
Turbulent intensities increase, especially in the vertical direction, as atmospheric conditions become 
more unstable. Table 7.2 gives typical values for different atmospheric conditions

Table 7.2 Lateral and vertical turbulence intensities for different wind conditions.
If the pollutant released is near the ground the plume will ‘hit’ the ground. The plume cannot spread into 
the ground, so it is assumed to be reflected. This is modeled by adding an imaginary underground source 
(a mirror image) of the same strength placed at the same distance from the source but ‘underground’. 
The concentrations of the real and imaginary plumes are added to estimate the total concentration.

Calculate the ground-level, center-line concentration for x = 500 m for an emission of 500,000 µg/s, wind velocity of

The simple Gaussion model is instructive, but it has limited application, as suggsted in Figure 7.5. 
Complexities in the region of interest, such as multiple sources, obstructions to air movement by buildings 
or topographical features, physical or chemical changes in the pollutants, and particulate deposition, 
require more complicated air quality models (Daly & Zanetti 2007).

The Fate of Pollutants in Air
Dispersion modeling uses meteorological data to characterize the dispersion of a pollutant from a source 
to selected downwind receptor locations. These models are used to determine compliance with National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and for State Implementation Plans (SIP). AERMOD is a 
steady-state model for continuous, buoyant plumes. Plume deposition behavior includes wet or dry 
deposition of particulates and/or gases. Releases may be at the surface, near surface, or elevated. It is 
available on the internet (USEPA 2004).
Photochemical models are large-scale models. They are used to assess control strategies for ozone and 
reactive chemicals. The EPA’s Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system includes 
state-of-the-science capabilities for conducting urban to regional scale simulations of multiple air quality 
issues, including tropospheric ozone, fine particles, toxics, acid deposition, and visibility degradation.

The Fate of Pollutants in Air
Receptor models (Figure 7.6) are mathematical or statistical procedures for identifying and quantifying 
the sources of air pollutants at a receptor location. Unlike photochemical and dispersion air quality 
models, receptor models do not use pollutant emissions, meteorological data and chemical transformation 
mechanisms. Instead, receptor models use the chemical and physical characteristics of gases and particles 
measured at source and receptor to quantify source contributions to receptor concentrations. The EPA 
has developed the Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) and UNMIX models, and also the Positive Matrix 
Factorization (PMF) method. CMB fully apportions receptor concentrations to chemically distinct 
source-types depending upon the source profile database. UNMIX and PMF generate source profiles 
from the ambient data.

Case Study: Detroit Multi-Pollutant Pilot Project
In each chapter about the fate of pollutants (chapters 7, 8 and 9) we will summarize one case study of a 
complicated modeling project. The goal is to outline the impressive capability that has grown from the 
very simple models that were explained earlier in the chapter. This capability has developed because of 
advanced understanding of mechanisms, but more important have been the availability of reliable data 
and massive computing power.
This section is about the Detroit multi-pollutant project that used a hybrid of two air quality models and 
added risk assessment and benefit cost analysis. The goals were attainment/maintenance of all NAAQS, 
reductions in specified industrial sectors, and risk reductions of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The 
project included visibility, energy, climate, and ecosystems. Another goal was to make effective integrated 
use of land use and transportation.
The traditional single-pollutant approach selects control strategies to separately address ozone and fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) at non-attainment locations. A least-cost approach for successively meeting 
each standard may not necessarily produce the most efficient strategy for meeting multiple air quality 
objectives or for obtaining the greatest health and environmental benefit for a given expenditure.

The Fate of Pollutants in Air
The National Research Council recommended that the USEPA transition from a pollutant-by-pollutant 
approach to air quality management to a multi-pollutant, risk-based approach. This strategy is aimed 
at reducing population risk from exposure to ozone, PM2.5 and toxics while still addressing ozone and 
PM2.5 non-attainment.
The multi-pollutant approach was expected to be more efficient than the traditional approach (the status 
quo) because many air quality problems share common precursors while current NAAQS requirements are 
focused pollutant-by-pollutant. The release, control, and chemical formation of pollutants are interrelated. 
An approach that takes these facts into account can simultaneously seek reductions of pollutants posing 
the most significant risks while receiving the greatest benefits and reducing administrative overhead.
No one had actually implemented a multi-pollutant air quality management effort until the Detroit pilot 
project (Wesson et al 2009, 2010; USEPA 2008). Detroit provides an excellent test bed because there are 
multi-pollutant issues with ozone, PM2.5 and toxics.
Also, the region is rich in technical data. The Detroit Air Toxics Initiative (DATI) monitored over 200 
compounds from April 2001–April 2002 (Simon et al., 2005). Analysis identified 13 chemicals of highest 
concern: methylene chloride, naphthalene, benzene, acrylonitrile, formaldehyde, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, 
arsenic, carbon tetrachloride, 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, cadmium, nickel, and manganese. Acrolein 
and diesel exhaust were important to consider for mitigation of air toxics health risks.
A significant innovation was combining the dispersion model (AERMOD) and the photochemical model 
(CMAQ) into one model output (via post-processing). This preserved the fine grid of AERMOD while 
properly treating chemistry/transport offered by CMAQ.
CMAQ modeling offers multi-pollutant (ozone, particulates, toxics, acid deposition, and nitrogen 
loading) capability by means of comprehensive description of gaseous and aqueous chemistry and 
aerosol dynamics. CMAQ was run with a 12 km × 12 km horizontal grid resolution centered on Detroit.
AERMOD modeling is EPA’s preferred air quality impact assessment tool for inert pollutants that are 
emitted from a variety of sources for transport distances of up to 50 km. AERMOD was run with a 
1 km × 1 km rectangular receptor grid. A concentration is predicted at each of these receptor locations 
so the output is very dense in comparison with the CMAQ model. The pollutants modeled include 
primary organic carbon, elemental carbon, benzene, cadmium, nickel, diesel particulate matter (DPM), 
formaldehyde, naphthalene, 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and methylene chloride.
The significant innovation was the combination of the CMAQ and AERMOD output to simultaneously 
deal with the many varied pollutants and increase the resolution of the analysis. Figures 7.7 and 7.8 show 
the benefits of this hybrid approach.

and better management decisions. (Wesson et al 2009, 2010; USEPA 2008)

Data from the air quality modeling was used as input into the environmental Benefits Mapping and 
Analysis Program (BenMAP) and the Human Exposure Model-3 (HEM-3). BenMAP relates ambient 
changes in air pollution to reductions in adverse health impacts, and it estimates the health impacts 
and monetary benefits. HEM-3 estimates cancer and non-cancer risk for toxic air pollutants, assuming 
an individual breathes the ambient air at a receptor site 24-hours per day over a 70-year lifetime. This 
assumption, while not realistic, is consistent with the EPA’s approach to estimating risk for regulatory 
decisions (Wesson et al. 2010).

The Fate of Pollutants in Air
The single-pollutant and the multi-pollutant approaches both identified policies that would achieve 
attainment for ozone and PM2.5. Both led to about the same number of tonnes of pollutants being targeted 
for reduction, but the pollutants were different because of the risk-based assessment. A few pollutant 
emissions are higher under the multi-pollutant plan.
The multi-pollutant plan is more protective of public health. For PM2.5 and ozone impacts, premature 
mortality, asthma and other respiratory problems, lost work days, etc. are double that estimated for the 
traditional approach.
Table 7.3 summarizes the estimated costs and benefits. The results for the multi-pollutant approach are 
impressive. The benefits are twice as large for a 20 percent increase in cost.
7.9	
Conclusion
After discharge an air pollutant will be transported and diluted and dispersed. Some disappear or 
become immobilized and can be forgotten within a fairly short time. Others persist, and are transported 
a great distance, even around the globe. Exactly what happens will depend on the physical and chemical 
properties of the pollutants and the meteorology.
The simplest model is the Gaussian distribution of pollutants in a buoyant plume. This can be developed 
to handle multiple pollutants, both mobile and stationary, and a variety of conditions for terrain and 
meteorology. It does not deal with chemical reactions, such as the photochemical production of ozone, 
but other models do, as illustrated in the Detroit air pollution case study.
Predicting the fate of pollutants in the air environment requires good data and appropriate models. 
We have sophisticated models and the computing power to execute large and complex environmental 
simulations of pollutant concentrations. Having computing power and good modeling software does not 
mean that modeling is easy or cheap. It is not. Information and expertise cost money.

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
8	 The Fate of Pollutants in Water
8.1	
Introduction
The five kinds of water receptors of pollutants – groundwater, rivers, lakes, estuaries, and the ocean – 
present different problems so they are discussed separately. Groundwater is discussed in Chapter 9 in 
connection with soil pollution, since it is not intentionally used as a receptacle for pollution.
Rivers are the easiest. Conditions change in one-dimension, along the length of the river. Vertical and 
horizontal variations are rarely important, except in very wide, slowly moving rivers like the Ganges.
Lakes and reservoirs are three-dimensional problems, or four-dimensional if one counts the annual 
cycle as a dimension. There can be important variations in temperature and water quality with depth. 
The distance from the inlet to the outlet of a reservoir can be up to 160 km (100 mi), and the width and 
depth will change along this distance. Mixing at the inlet may be controlled by differences in density due 
to temperature or silt load. Changes in water temperature throughout the year may cause stratification 
and turnover.
Estuaries have characteristics of rivers and reservoirs, with the added complication of tidal movement 
and salinity gradients.

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
The ocean is another three-dimensional problem, but generally more simple because the goal is maximum 
dilution of any pollutants that are discharged there.
8.2	
Fate of Pollutants in Rivers
8.2.1	
Basic Issues
For many years pollution control in rivers was about organic carbon compounds that would degrade the 
dissolved oxygen concentration as they were consumed by microorganisms in the river. These problems 
have been largely solved and today we are more concerned about toxins and the fertilizing effects of 
nitrogen and phosphorus.
The change in dissolved oxygen (DO) depends on the rate of consumption of organic carbon (the measure 
of this is BOD) and the rate of reaeration by transfer of oxygen from the air to the water. Reaeration 
is the mechanism that gives a river a capacity to absorb biodegradable organic pollution. Ignoring this 
assimilative capacity and using the same standards for all dischargers raises the total cost of pollution 
control. On the other hand, to determine the assimilative capacity and allocate it fairly to dischargers 
requires costly fieldwork and mathematical modeling. If the effluents are very low in organic carbon, 
the dissolved oxygen levels will normally be satisfactory.
Rivers usually wash out plankton faster than it can grow and periodic flood flows wash the streambed 
of rooted plants. As a result the lowest layer in the benthic pyramid is detritus feeding invertebrates, 
which in turn support macro invertebrates and fish. This makes rivers less sensitive to the discharge of 
nitrogen and phosphorus than other aquatic environments.
8.2.2	
The Mixing Zone
Effluent is most often discharged at the stream bank and it takes some time (distance) to thoroughly 
mix into the river. The length of the mixing zone may be up to three times the width of the river. This 
is based on the assumption that most discharges are about the same density as river water and will mix 
freely. If this is not true, as with heated discharges, the mixing will be slower and special calculations 
will be needed.
For conservative pollutants, i.e. those that neither settle nor decay, the concentration in the river at the 
downstream boundary of a mixing zone will be

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
Q1 and Q2 are volumetric flows of the river upstream and of the effluent, as shown in Figure 8.1. The 
flow after the river and effluent have mixed is Q3 = Q1+Q2. C1, C2 and C3 indicate concentrations at the 
three locations of interest. The pollutant will be further diluted as it moves downstream by tributaries, 
groundwater inflow, and overland runoff, assuming these flows do not make an additional contribution 
of the pollutant.

Figure 8.1 Zone of mixing for a bankside discharge of pollutant may be 
up to three times the width of the river. At the downstream end of the 
mixing zone the pollutant is thoroughly mixed and diluted in the river 
water.
The usual assumption is that any reactions within the mixing zone can be neglected. It is a good assumption 
for biological reactions, but may not be for rapid chemical oxidations. Ambient water quality criteria are 
usually imposed at the boundary of the mixing zone. If toxicity within the mixing zone is a problem, it 
may be worthwhile to discharge away from the bank or to use multiple discharge points.
Example 8.1 Mixing of a Pollutant in a River
Wastewater with pollutant concentration C2 = 50 mg/L is discharged to a stream at a rate of Q2 = 5,000 m3/d. The river 
flow above the discharge is Q1 = 15,000 m3/d with a pollutant concentration of C1 =10 mg/L. The total flow at the end 
of the mixing zone is Q3 = 5,000 + 15,000 = 20,000 m3/d. The pollutant concentration is 
C3 =
Q1C1 + Q2C2  =
(15,000 m3/d)(10 mg/L) + (5,000 m3/d)(50 mg/L)
 = 20 mg/L
Q3
20,000 m3/d
8.2.3	
Transport by Convection and Longitudinal Dispersion
A pollutant that is released steadily into a river is assumed to move at the same velocity as the river. 
Turbulence will cause some longitudinal dispersion (upstream and downstream mixing) but any transport 
by this mechanism is unimportant compared with the convective flow.

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
The fate of a slug injection of pollutant is different. The sharp peak in pollutant concentration that is created 
by the spill will be carried along by convection, but turbulent mixing along the axis of flow will also be 
obvious. This will mix the pollutant into a larger volume of water and decrease the peak concentration. 
Figure 8.2 shows that concentration pattern that will develop. If the pollutant is non-reactive the mass 
of pollutant remains the same in the affected volume of water, which expands with travel downstream. 
This dilution of the peak is important to downstream consumers, especially if the spilled pollutant is 
toxic, causes off tastes or odors, or is otherwise objectionable.

Where C0 is the concentration at t = 0, that is, at the upstream boundary of the river section of interest. 
This may be the end of a mixing zone for an effluent discharge or a tributary. C(t) is the concentration 
after travel downstream for time t. Indicating distance downstream as x and stream velocity as V, the 
time of travel is t = x/V.
The coefficient k indicates how rapidly the pollutant disappears from the water; high k means faster 
disappearance. k has units of 1/time (time–1). If travel time is measured in days, k has units of day-1; if 
measured in hours then k has units of hr-1.

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
Example 8.2 The exponential decay model for pollutant disappearance in a river.
Assume the interesting behavior starts at the end of the mixing zone. Using the C0 = 20 mg/L chemical concentration 
from Example 8.1, the concentration after 10 hours of travel for k = 0.05 hour-1 is
C(10) = (20 mg/L)e–(0.05)10 = 12.1 mg/L
Figure 8.3a shows three pollutants decaying at different rates. The decay coefficients in these figures 
have units of 1/hour. Twenty hours travel in a river is 100 km, assuming an average velocity of 5 km/h 
(3 mile/h). It is unlikely that conditions will be constant for that distance, so a more realistic result may 
be that shown in Figure 8.3b, where for some reason the rate coefficient changes from k = 0.05/h to 
k = 0.2/h. A change like this could occur if the velocity is reduced and the removal efficiency increases 
due to settling. The chemical might disappear due to volatilization or the river might become more 
turbulent, which would increase the rate of removal. If the removal mechanism is biodegradation, the river 
might enter a shallow reach where the water is warmer and benthic activity accelerates the removal rate.

Oxygen Depletion in a River
The level of dissolved oxygen (DO) required for a healthy fishery is 6 mg/L or higher. Below this spawning 
is inhibited and growth and activity decline. DO in the range of 3–5 mg/L is stressful to fish, but can be 
tolerated for 12–24 hours. DO below 3 mg/L will not support fish populations.
The earliest water quality model, by Streeter and Phelps (1925), was used to predict dissolved oxygen 
concentrations in the Ohio River as a function of pollution load. The ‘sag’ describes the shape of the 
response curve, with DO being high before the pollutant is added and then decreasing to some minimum 
and later recovering toward the original level as the pollution is dissipated.
Dissolved oxygen (DO) and biodegradable organic substances are simultaneously consumed by bacteria. 
The rate of DO depletion is proportional to the concentration of organics.
As oxygen is being depleted it is also being replenished by algal photosynthesis and by the transport of 
oxygen from the atmosphere into the water. We will assume in this discussion that photosynthesis is 
negligible. (It is negligible at night and it may be unimportant in the daytime if turbidity is high.) The rate 
of transport of oxygen from air to water increases as the DO decreases. This is fortunate because when 
bacterial activity has reduced the oxygen level, reaeration is working at a higher rate to regain the balance.
The simplest model that captures these two competing mechanisms is the Streeter-Phelps model.

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
P0 = concentration of biodegradable pollutant at time t = 0 (mg/L).
k1 = exponential decay coefficient for the degradation of organic pollutants (day-1)
k2 = reaeration rate coefficient (day-1)
This is usually written in terms of the dissolved oxygen deficit (the gap between DO saturation 
concentration and the existing DO), so the equation in most other books looks different but describes 
the same mechanisms.
The dissolved oxygen saturation concentration for water is a function of temperature. The saturation 
concentration in fresh water at 20°C is 9.2 mg/L, at 15°C it is 10 mg/L. The saturation concentration in 
saline waters is lower than in fresh water.
P0 is the concentration of the pollutant at the head of the river segment being modeled. This may be at the 
downstream end of an effluent mixing zone, the mixing zone of an incoming tributary, or at the beginning 
of a river segment that is physically different than its upstream segment (i.e. different velocity or depth).
Values for the biodegradation rate coefficient, k1 are in the range of 0.05 to 0.5 day-1. The reaeration 
rate coefficient, k2, can range from 0.25 day-1 for sluggish streams to 0.45–0.7 day-1 for large streams of 
normal velocity to 1.15 day-1 for swift turbulent streams. The value for rapids and waterfalls is greater 
than 1.15. Both k1 and k2 depend on temperature; higher temperatures give higher k values, which means 
that everything happens faster.

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
Example 8.3 Dissolved oxygen concentration calculation in a river.
The upstream dissolved oxygen is DO(t=0) = 8.2 mg/L, the water temperature is 20°C so DOsat = 9.2 mg/L. The 
reaeration rate coefficient is k2 = 0.6 day–1  for the local river temperature, velocity, and depth. The biodegradation 
rate coefficient is k1 = 0.2 day–1. Inserting these values
DO(t) = 9.2 – 
0.2P0
 (e–0.2t – e–0.6t)–8.2e–0.6t
0.6–0.2
The pollutant disappears according to the exponential model, in general
P(t) = P0e–k1t
and for k1 = 0.2 
P(t) = P0e–0.2t
Figure 8.4 shows the predicted dissolved oxygen concentrations for three levels of pollution. At a pollution level of 
P0 = 10 mg/L the DO levels will support a healthy biological population, including all species of fish (unless they prefer 
cooler water temperatures). At P0 = 20 mg/L the DO is acceptable, but at P0 = 30 mg/L fish will be under great stress.

Segmented River Models
Advanced models include modifications of the simple model of the last section to account for photosynthesis, 
sediment oxygen demand, biodegradation, sedimentation, sediment scouring, adsorption, the influence 
of nitrogen and phosphorus, and dynamic conditions of loading and river flow. These models are basically 
still a prediction of the balance between oxygen consumption and oxygen replenishment. A widely used 
software package for advanced water quality modeling is QUAL2K, which is available from the USEPA.
One characteristic of all advanced models is that the river is segmented so that the model parameters 
(k1, k2 and others that may be needed for algae growth, ammonia oxidation, etc.) can be changed from 
segment to segment.
The calculations to do this are extremely simple, as Figure 8.5 shows, because once the known values of 
the k’s and the times are substituted, the exponential terms become numerical values, and the equations 
become simple linear equations that are easily solved. The subscript notation is cumbersome and a more 
convenient system is used. The first letter of the variable indicates pollutant (P) or dissolved oxygen (D), 
the second indicates the upstream (U) or downstream (D) end of the segment, and the number is the 
segment identifier, giving, for example, DU1 = dissolved oxygen upstream segment 1, PD2 = pollutant 
concentration downstream segment 2.

If there is no mixing zone the downstream value of one segment becomes the upstream value of the next. 
If there is a tributary or effluent to be mixed with the river, the values of P and D leaving the mixing 
zone become the initial values for the next segment.
When the initial conditions are known, the solution proceeds from upstream to downstream. When 
a specified critical condition must be maintained in the river, for example if DY3 must be 5 mg/L or 
higher, the calculations are done by working upstream.

DD1 = 9.2 – 
0.2PU1
 (e–0.2t – e–0.6t)–DUIe–0.6t

The exponentials are e–0.2(0.5) = e–0.1 = 0.905,  e–0.6(0.5) = e–0.3 = 0.741 and the model becomes
	
DD1 = 9.2 – 0.5 PU1(0.905 – 0.741) – DU1 (0.741) = 9.2 – 0.082 PU1 – 0.741 DU1

DD1 = 9.2 – 0.082(20) – 0.741(8.2) = 1.48 mg/L
For the pollutant
	
PD1 = PU1 e–0.2(0.5) = PU1 e–0.1 = 0.905 PU1 = 18.1 mg/L

Partitioning of Pollutants between Water, Air and Solids
A brief explanation of chemical partitioning is given because the term is used in the following sections. 
It refers to the ability of many organic chemicals to exist as a vapor, as a soluble molecule, and as an 
adsorbed molecule. What happens depends mainly on the chemical’s solubility. Water is a polar solvent. 
Most synthetic organic chemicals are non-polar compounds. They have a low solubility in water and 
a high affinity for organic matter in soil and suspended particulates. These compounds also tend to 
concentrate in the fatty tissues of living organisms.
Figure 8.6 is a graphical explanation of partitioning between air and water, and between dissolved and 
particulate material in the water.
Figure 8.6a shows 10 parts of a conservative chemical spilled into the water. After some time passes 
there are still 10 parts of chemical, but they are partitioned with 3 parts in the air and 7 parts in the 
water. Henry’s Law defines the partitioning between liquids and gases. Figure 8.6b shows three parts of 
chemical adsorbed to organic particles and three parts going to the air, leaving four parts in the soluble 
form. The tendency to adsorb is inversely proportional to the chemical’s solubility.
A reactive (non-conservative) chemical would disappear via chemical or biological reactions and there 
would be less than ten parts remaining, but whatever remained would still be partitioned between air 
and water.

Case Study: PCBs in the Fox River, Wisconsin
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were manufactured by adding chlorine to biphenyl. The resulting 
product was a mixture of chlorinated biphenyl groups, some with only 2 chlorine atoms attached, and 
some with seven or eight. Figure 8.7 shows examples of 7-Cl, 5-Cl and 4-Cl congeners. The biphenyl 
group has 10 positions where a Cl-atom can be attached, so there are many possible congeners. There 
are 169 congeners with 4 or more chlorine atoms.

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
A different kind of model is needed to deal with special chemicals, such PCBs. Figure 8.7 is a map of 
the Fox River, Wisconsin, showing areas of PCB contamination and the estimated PCB inventory in the 
sediments. The PCB model incorporates a number of transport and partitioning mechanisms. PCBs can 
be dissolved in water, volatilize to the atmosphere, settle and be resuspended from sediments, adsorb to 
dissolved organic carbon (DOC), or adsorb to particulate matter.
Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a broad classification for organic molecules of varied origin and 
composition within aquatic systems. The “dissolved” fraction of organic carbon is an operational 
classification. Many researchers use the term “dissolved” for compounds below 0.45 micrometers, but 
0.22 micrometers is also common, saving ‘colloidal’ or ‘particulate’ designations for larger particle sizes.
Particles subside into the sediments during low flow but are resuspended in high flow. Some forms can 
volatilize. Some PCB congeners are slowly biodegradable in the presence of oxygen, but not in conditions 
like river sediments where there is no oxygen. Others decompose in the sediments without oxygen. The 
more highly chlorinated PCBs adsorb strongly to organic matter, including soil and sediment.

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
It was estimated that the Fox River was discharging 140 to 220 kg/yr into Green Bay (Lake Michigan) 
and the goal was to keep the PCBs out of the lake (Fitzgerald & Steur 1996). There has been no input 
of PCBs to the river for many years, so the PCBs are carried on sediments that accumulated years 
ago and are scoured from the river bottom during times of high flow. The issue was whether the 
contaminated sediment should be dredged from the river, left in place, or somehow covered up to restrict 
migration. Leaving them in place could result in intermittent transport during high flow conditions due 
to resuspension of surface sediments. Subsurface sediments would only be released if high flow caused 
severe scouring of the river bottom.

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
The model was used to simulate total suspended solids and PCB concentrations at several locations for a 
period from 1989 to 1996. The results for the De Pere dam are shown in Figure 8.8. The daily river flows 
(not shown) are low for most of the year, but increase in the spring and early summer with seasonal 
rain and snow melt, which is when the TSS and PCB concentrations increase. The top panel shows 
measured (dots) and predicted (line) PCB concentrations, in nanograms per liter (ng/L). The bottom 
panel is measured and predicted total suspended solids (TSS). The TSS results are important because 
a large part of the PCB load is adsorbed to solids. Particulate PCB was in the range of 0.5 to .25 mg/
kg dry solid particulates. The model under-predicts the peak concentrations (most models do), but it 
captures the main features of TSS transport.
A 10-yr, $700 million dredging to remove 7.5 million cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediments from 
critical locations began in 1999. This is the largest PCB remediation project in the world. The dredged 
slurry is processed with hydrocyclones to remove sand, the fine sediment fraction is dewatered using 
plate-and-frame filters, the filtrate is treated by filtration and carbon filters. In the first phase (September–
December 1999) 640 kg of PCBs were removed from the river, 14.5 kg were transported downstream, 
2.6 kg were volatilized, and 0.1 kg were returned to the river as treated filtrate (USGS 2000).

Fate of Pollutants in Lakes
8.6.1	
Importance of Temperature and Density
The dynamics of a lake are driven by changes in temperature and water density. Pure water has its 
maximum density at a temperature of 4°C. As warmer water cools to 4°C, its mass stays the same but 
volume decreases so it is more compact. As it cools below 4°C the density decreases until it freezes. When 
water freezes at 0°C, its volume expands by 9 percent because a rigid open lattice of hydrogen-bonded 
molecules is formed. It is this open structure that makes ice less dense than liquid water.
Table 8.3 shows that the density difference between 4°C and 6°C is only 0.03 kg/m3. A density difference 
this small is neglected in most engineering situations but it is important in deep lakes and reservoirs.

Table 8.3 Density of water at 0 to 20°C (Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 53rd ed., 1972)
The water column may be uniform vertically in the winter and during spring and fall turnover. Turnover 
is when the lake water mixes thoroughly from top to bottom. If the water temperature during the year 
gets below 4°C a deep lake will stratify because of differences in water density. It may be covered with 
ice, thus blocking the entry of oxygen from the atmosphere. In the summer the water column will have a 
wind-mixed upper layer with dissolved oxygen and an active biota (the epilimnion), a relatively stagnant 
bottom layer (the hypolimnion), and an intermediate layer (the thermocline).

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
Figure 8.9 shows water temperature and dissolved oxygen in the Cherokee Reservoir of the Tennessee 
Valley Authority system on 11 March, 15 April, and 25 June in the year 1969. This seasonal pattern is 
consistent year to year. In March the reservoir is homogeneous; the temperature is a nearly uniform 5°C 
and dissolved oxygen of 10 mg/L. One month later, in April, the reservoir is stratifying, with warmer 
water near the surface and the colder water at the bottom. The dissolved oxygen levels in the deep water 
are starting to decline. By June the stratification is strongly established, as can be seen in the temperature 
profile, but even more clearly in the dissolved oxygen concentrations.
Another problem in discharging to lakes is to calculate the spatial changes in water quality. In the simplest 
case, where the water is well mixed vertically, the size and shape of the mixing zone is dependent on 
the pattern, direction, duration and velocity of the wind induced current, although advection through 
the lake may play some part. The temperature difference between the discharge and the lake water 
may also play a part in controlling the degree of mixing. Thermal stratification virtually eliminates the 
mixing of the surface layer (epilimnion) with the deeper water (hypolimnion). Only during the spring 
and autumn turnovers is there likely to be complete mixing of the discharge, otherwise it will tend to 
mix with the epilimnion.

8.6.2	
Lake Retention Time (Flushing Time)
Lakes occur either as part of a river system or as isolated entities. In both cases the water is retained for 
periods of days, months, or years. This retention time is generally sufficient to allow the development 
of planktonic algae, which provides food for zooplankton and fish. Death and decay of the plankton 
community provides food for a benthic community (dominated by bacteria, fungi and detritus feeders) 
via sedimentation.

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
Lakes are potentially a highly productive environment and may, over a period of time, pass from barren 
(oligotrophic) to highly productive (eutrophic). This may occur over decades or centuries, but can be 
accelerated by inputs of nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P). This process, known as eutrophication, results 
in a decline in water quality and a shift the dominant species of fish and plankton.
A further reason for avoiding waste discharges to lakes is that the recovery time is on the order of years 
or decades. Lake retention time (residence time or flushing time) is a calculated quantity expressing 
the mean time that water (or some dissolved substance) spends in a particular lake. At its simplest, it 
is the lake volume divided by either the mean rate of inflow of all tributaries or by the mean rate of 
outflow (ideally including evaporation and seepage). It roughly expresses the amount of time taken for 
a substance introduced into a lake to flow out of it again. The retention time is especially important 
where pollutants are concerned.
Retention time assumes that water in the lake is well-mixed rather than stratified, so that any portion 
of the lake water is much like any other. In reality, larger and deeper lakes are generally not well mixed. 
Many large lakes can be divided into distinct portions with only limited flow between them. Deep lakes 
are generally stratified, with deeper water mixing infrequently with surface water. These are often better 
modeled as several distinct sub-volumes of water.
Example 8.5 Residence times for Lake Superior and Lake Erie
Lake Superior and Lake Erie have the longest and shortest residence times of the five Great Lakes. Lake Superior has a 
surface area of 82,100 km2 and an average depth of 147 m, for a volume of 12,069 km3.
	
TSuperior = Volume/Outflow = 12,069 km3/63.2 km3/y  = 191 years
Lake Erie has a surface area of 25,700 km2 and an average depth of 19 m, for a volume of 488.3 km3
	
TErie = 488.3 km3/187.8 km3/y = 2.6 years
The other Great Lakes residence times are 99 years for Lake Michigan, 6 years for Lake Ontario, and 22 years for Lake 
Huron. A few other well-known lakes are Lake Geneva, Switzerland, = 11.4 years, Lake Como, Italy = 4.5 years, Lake 
Baikal, Russia = 330 years, and Lake Titicaca, Peru = 1343 years.

Phosphorus in Lakes
The active form of phosphorus in lakes is orthophosphate (PO4
3-), which is readily taken up by algae 
and other organisms. Some of the phosphorus is flushed out of the lake, but much of it can be retained 
and recirculated within the lake.

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
In lakes, phosphorus is the nutrient in least supply relative to plant needs. The N:P ratio in plant tissue 
is 10:1 to 15:1. If the ratio of N:P in water is greater than 15:1 then the lake is phosphorus limited. The P 
will be used up before the N is used and plant growth will be limited. Eutrophication in lakes cannot be 
controlled only by reducing nitrogen (Schindler et al. 2008). Reducing P will reduce primary productivity 
of algae, as shown by the graph of chlorophyll and P concentrations and the aerial photograph in the 
lower half of Figure 8.10.
Figure 8.10 Primary productivity and eutrophication is driven by the availability of phosphorus. Phosphorus exists in water as organic 
matter, particulate inorganic and organic forms, and dissolved inorganic (orthophosphate). The cycle is shown in the upper block. The 
graph shows how the productivity of chlorophyll (algae and plants) depends on the phosphorus concentration in the water. The aerial 
photo on the lower right shows an experiment in a Canadian lake. C, N & P were added on one side of a curtain; C & N (no P) were added 
on the other. The effect of phosphorus on eutrophication is striking. (Photo used with the kind permission of Schindler 1974).

Advanced Lake Models
A conceptual model, which may also be useful for simple modeling, has hypothetical zones along the 
length of the reservoir and by depth, as in Figure 8.11. The riverine zones at the inlet and in tributary 
embayments have narrow channelized basins with relatively high flow rates. The broad deep lake basin 
(the lacustrine zone) has low velocities and generally is relatively clear and less eutrophic.

Figure 8.12 Conceptual model for a lake. Often the water column will be divided layers or 
segments.
Figure 8.12 is a conceptual model for a lake, showing an interchange of chemical between the sediment 
and the water column. The water column contains dissolved organic carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and 
phosphorus in various forms, carbonate compounds, and traces of many other substances. There will 
also be particulate matter, some living (algae, bacteria, protozoa) and some dead (detritus). The living 
organisms consume the dissolved nutrients and oxygen. The dead organisms decay and release nutrients 
and consume oxygen. Zooplankton consume other organisms and detritus.
Figure 8.13 is a hydrographic a map of Hagg Lake, Oregon, showing depths (left) and a grid (right) 
that was constructed to identify rather homogeneous sections for modeling. The first requirement is a 
hydrologic model of inflows and outflow that will predict the lake volume and surface area. Surface area 
data are needed to predict photosynthesis and the volume data are needed to get the residence time and 
correct concentrations, based on inflows and outflows. The model used was QUAL2-W2 (Ferrari 2001, 
Cole & Wells 2002).

Fate of Pollutants in Estuaries
8.8.1	
The Tidal Cycle and Water Movement
An estuary is a narrow, semi-enclosed coastal body of water that has a free connection with the open sea 
and one or more rivers flowing into it, and within which the salinity of the water is measurably different 
than the salinity of seawater.
Estuaries were for many years regarded by large cities as a convenient location for discharging wastewaters. 
(Twenty-two of the world’s largest cities are located on estuaries.) This resulted in major estuaries 
becoming seriously polluted. This situation is exacerbated by the long recovery time, which is nearer to 
that of lakes than of rivers.
Estuaries form a transition zone between river and ocean environments and are subject to both marine 
influences, such as tides, waves, and the influx of saline water; and riverine influences, such as flows of 
fresh water and sediment. The inflows of both seawater and fresh water provide high levels of nutrients 
in the water column and sediment, making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the 
world. A healthy estuary is a productive nursery and growth environment for fish, shellfish, and other 
aquatic organisms. Also, migratory bird populations make essential use of estuaries.
Two of the main challenges of estuarine life are the variability in salinity and sedimentation. Many species 
of fish and invertebrates have methods to control or conform to the shifts in salt concentrations. Many 
animals also burrow to avoid predation and to live in the more stable sediment environment.

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
Biologically estuaries can be commercially important for two reasons: (a) they are home to benthic 
vertebrates such as prawns and flounders, and (b) they serve as the gathering grounds for salmon 
(upstream) and eels (downstream). Where migration of salmon occurs, very high water quality is required 
to attract the fish to enter the estuary and then to move upstream successfully while undergoing the 
profound physiological change from sea water to fresh water.
Phytoplankton, mainly diatoms and dinoflagellates, are primary producers in estuaries. They move with 
the water and can be flushed in and out with the tides. Their productivity is largely dependent upon 
the turbidity of the water. Another primary source of food for many organisms, including bacteria, is 
detritus from dead organisms.
Estuaries tend to be naturally eutrophic because land runoff supplies nutrients. With urbanization and 
industrial growth, run-off also now includes chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture and on lawns, 
waste from livestock and humans, and industrial inputs.
Water movement in estuaries is the complex result of a freshwater flow and a tidal oscillation, with 
additional momentum from the wind, and a density difference. The total distance travelled by a water 
particle from low water slack to high water slack and vice versa is referred to as the tidal excursion, as 
shown in Figure 8.14. This represents the maximum distance travelled by a water particle during the 
rising or falling limb of the tide. Tidal excursion is not to be confused with the distance travelled by the 
tide wave itself (e.g., high water), which propagates from the ocean to the end of the estuary each tide 
cycle, which may be up to 150 km.

A parcel of water moves to position 2 at the end of the ebb tide and back upstream 
to position 3 at the end of the flood tide. The net tidal excursion is the distance 
between 1 and 3. This is the movement due to fresh water advection into the estuary. 
Several tidal cycles may pass before a parcel of water moves from the estuary inlet 
to the sea.

Salinity, Mixing and Stratification
Density differences due to temperature and salinity influence tidal mixing, Figure 8.15, shows the typical 
3 percent increase in density that occurs from the freshwater inlet to the ocean. An estuary frequently 
has vertical gradients in salinity, depending on the mixing, as shown in Figure 8.16.
Saline coastal waters are carried into an estuary by the tides; freshwater inflows tend to wash the saltwater 
back out to sea. The presence of salt in an estuary produces a longitudinal density gradient, with water 
densities around the mouth of the estuary being greater (because of higher salt concentrations) than 
densities around the head of the estuary. This results in the enhancement of flood tide velocities near 
the bed and ebb tide velocities near the surface. When averaged over a tidal cycle, this behavior leads 
to residual currents, in which saline water flows upstream along the bottom of the estuary and less 
salty, even fresh water, flows seawards near the surface. This pattern of residual flows is referred to as 
gravitational circulation; it is driven by the gravitational forces resulting from density differences (see 
Figure 8.14b). Gravitational circulation can give rise to discharges that are 10 or 20 times greater than 
freshwater inflows. Gravitational circulation is an important mechanism of upstream sediment transport 
and the longitudinal dispersion of salt in estuaries.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

One major difference from the upstream river system is that high fresh water flows do not generate 
sufficient velocities on the bed of the estuary to wash out all the sediment and associated benthos. This 
particularly applies to stratified estuaries, where high freshwater flows cause an increased upstream 
movement of deep water. The biological consequences of this is the opportunity for building a much 
larger benthic community that depends on an adequate supply of dissolved oxygen to exist, or the 
accumulation of sediment which may adsorb high concentrations of toxins such as metals or organics.

The Fate of Pollutants in Water
The concentrations of a conservative pollutant in a well-mixed estuary are nearly the same in the surface 
layer and the bottom layers. In a stratified estuary the saline water flows along the bottom and is largely 
isolated from mixing with less dense wastewater discharges. The result is a high pollutant concentration 
near the surface, which is mainly seaward flowing river water, and a low concentration at the bottom.
A larger freshwater flow means a shorter residence time. A few Irish estuaries illustrate this. Galway Bay, 
a poorly flushed estuary, has an average residence time of from 59 days to several hundred days. The 
moderately-flushed Killary Harbor estuary average residence time is 40–50 days. Dublin Bay is well-
flushed with a residence time of 1–2 days. Ninety percent of a conservative dye injected into Dublin 
Bay will be flushed away after ten tidal cycles. To reach the same dilution in Killary Harbor takes 250 
tidal cycles.

Case Study – The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model
Now we take a brief look at the complex Chesapeake Bay estuarine system. This is one of the most 
important estuaries in the United States. The Chesapeake Bay Phase 3 Watershed Model includes studies 
and models of land use, hydrology, geology, air quality, and water quality. The watershed extends into 
seven states and the District of Columbia. There are 24 land-use classifications and the watershed is 
divided into 899 sub-sections. (USEPA 2010; www.chesapeakebay.net)

The water quality model has 54,000 cells, up to 15 layers deep (USEPA 2010). Figure 8.17 gives an idea 
of the structure of the model grid. There are 18 years of data to calibrate and test the model.
To compute algae and dissolved oxygen, 24 variables are used. A few of these are temperature, salinity, 
dissolved organic nitrogen, inorganic suspended solids, total phosphate, dissolved organic phosphorus, 
dissolved organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrate, chemical oxygen demand, diatoms, 
blue-green algae, micro-zooplankton and meso-zooplankton (Cerco & Noel 2004).
The predicted conditions are bottom-water hypoxia, the spring phytoplankton bloom, nutrient limitations, 
sediment-water interactions, and the nitrogen and phosphorus budget.
Figure 8.18 is an example of the model output that shows dissolved oxygen for June 2009. A large 
portion of the estuary, especially the deeper water, has zero dissolved oxygen (red). The surface water 
has sufficient oxygen for fish (DO > 4 mg/L) due to wind-aided aeration. The dissolved oxygen situation 
is better in the colder months of the year.

Fate of Pollutants in the Sea
8.10.1	
Dilution and Buoyant Jets
An ocean outfall is used to discharge an effluent some distance from the shore of large coastal cities 
and to achieve a high dilution factor. Because of the need to prevent deposition of material on beaches, 
discharge to the sea invariably occurs at some distance past the lowest low water mark.
If dilution of a pollutant is an acceptable disposal method, the dilution must be accomplished by injecting 
the low-density effluent below the high-density seawater. The density difference aids mixing. The effluent 
emerges as a jet from a diffuser and becomes buoyant due to the density difference and the momentum 
of the discharge. The jet entrains seawater and expands with a gradual reduction in both velocity and 
concentration. When the dilution factor reaches 50, the buoyancy is virtually zero.
Maximum dilution occurs when the effluent mixes all the way to the ocean surface. It is possible for a 
dense layer of seawater to inhibit the plume rise. This is analogous to the gaseous plume from a stack 
being trapped near the ground by heavy atmospheric conditions.

The Deer Island Boston Harbor Project
A recent and successful ocean outfall installation is part of the Boston Harbor Project, Figure 8.19. Boston 
treats its wastewater at the Deer Island Plant, the second largest treatment plant in the United States. 
With the former outfall locations, high pollutant concentrations were found within Boston Harbor and 
along the coastline immediately south. With the new outfall location, high concentrations are found 
only within a few kilometers of the outfall, concentrations are dramatically lower in Boston Harbor.

The outfall, Figure 8.20, has a design hydraulic capacity of 1,270 million gallons per day (4.8 × 106 m3/
day). The length is 49,624 ft (15.1 km) and the diameter is 24 ft (7.3 m). The effluent is discharged 
through 270 diffuser ports that have diameters of 0.49 ft (0.15 m) to 0.64 ft (0.20 m). A 400 ft (120 m) 
drop shaft feeds a 43,300 ft (13.2 km) outfall tunnel and a 6,600 ft (2.0 km) diffuser tunnel. The tunnels 
are in bedrock. The diffusers are seated on the sea floor some 250 ft (76 m) above the diffuser tunnel 
and 100 ft (30 m) below the water surface. [approximate metric conversions shown]

Conclusion
Useful water quality models range from the simple input-output calculation for a mixing zone, to 
segmented river models with 2 to 15 water quality variables, to compartmentalized models of stratified 
reservoirs, to the 24-variable, 54,000 cell Chesapeake Bay model.
The range of complexity that can be formulated and calculated is astonishing. Where one works within that 
range is determined by the available data and the local problem. The Chesapeake Bay estuary is complex 
and impressive, but it could not have been developed and verified without the excellent historical data.
Use the simplest model that will answer the important questions.

The Fate of Pollutants in Soil and Groundwater
9	 The Fate of Pollutants in Soil and 
Groundwater
9.1	
Groundwater Contamination
Contaminated groundwater problems often are not detected until many years after the initiating event. A 
chemical spilled onto the ground may slowly sink into the groundwater and then move a few meters per 
year until it is finally detected at a drinking water well. By then the relatively small problem of cleaning 
up a spill has become a large problem of cleaning a contaminated aquifer.
The largest and most serious contaminated groundwater sites were created through ignorance, carelessness, 
and accidents. Dangerous chemicals were dumped without much thought about their persistence and 
ability to disperse. Chemicals were spilled around factory loading docks. Underground storage tanks 
leaked. Industrial and military wastes were dumped into pits and lagoons that did not retain the materials. 
Landfills slowly released leachate. Table 9.1 lists the many ways that problems can originate.
Controlled applications of pesticides and herbicides can pollute groundwater and indiscriminate use has 
loaded aquifers and lakes with atrazine and other varieties.

The Movement of Groundwater
The flow of water in a saturated aquifer is defined by Darcy’s Law:
Q = KiA
where K = hydraulic conductivity (L/T), i = hydraulic gradient (L/L) and A = cross sectional area through 
which the flow is conducted (L2). Note that A is the area of cross-sectional face of the soil and not the 
area of the pore openings in the face. These terms are defined in Figure 9.2
The apparent average velocity of the groundwater is Darcy’s flux:	 	
V = Ki
The actual average velocity of the water through the soil pores is: 	
V = Ki/θ
where q is the soil porosity.
K varies over many orders of magnitude, from 10-9 for fine clay to 100 for coarse gravel. A crude scale 
of hydraulic conductivity of soils is
	
Clayey = 10-9 – 10-6 cm/s	
Silty = 10-7 – 10-3 cm/s
	
Sandy = 10-5 – 10-1 cm/s		
Gravelly = 10-1 – 102 cm/s
The change in hydraulic gradient provides the force to move the water. The easiest picture of this is the 
slope of the groundwater table below the ground surface. The flow moves in the downhill direction of the 
hydraulic gradient. This can be observed by installing observation wells. (There is a hydraulic gradient 
even when the aquifer is confined by an upper impervious layer, but it is less easy to picture.)

The Movement of Chemicals in Groundwater
A contaminant plume will spread and be diluted as it moves down gradient with the groundwater. If the 
distance, or time of travel, between the source of contamination and a drinking water well or river is 
sufficient, dilution may eliminate the potential problems of toxicity and unpleasant tastes and odors. To 
the contrary, if the dilution is not sufficient and a problem still exists, the volume of affected groundwater 
has grown, perhaps to a magnitude that makes it difficult and expensive to interrupt the contaminant 
movement or clean up the groundwater.

The Fate of Pollutants in Soil and Groundwater
Most contaminated sites involve a mixture of chemicals and many chemicals do not move at the average 
velocity of the groundwater. They move slower due to the effect of adsorption to the soil. This is particularly 
true for less soluble contaminants, which can move even hundreds of times slower than water. The effect 
is for the more soluble (less adsorbable) species to travel faster and farther than the less soluble ones.
This phenomenon is measured by the retardation factor, Rd.
d
R

of
 
Velocity

Velocity


A higher value of Rd means the chemical movement is slower relative to the groundwater movement.
Example 9.1 Movement of a non-reactive contaminant
How long will it take for a non-reactive contaminant to travel a distance of 10 m if Darcy’s flux is V = 5 cm/day 
through saturated soil. The porosity of the saturated soil is q = 0.5.
	
Vwater = V/q = (5 cm/day)/0.5 = 10 cm/day
	
Time for the chemical to travel 10 m = (10 m)(100 cm/m)/(10 cm/day) = 100 days
Example 9.2 Movement of a reactive contaminant
How long will it take for a reactive contaminant (Rd = 11.4) to travel a distance of 10 m if Darcy’s flux is V = 5 cm/day 
and the porosity of the saturated soil is q = 0.5.
	
The water is traveling at Vwater = (5 cm/day)/0.5 = 10 cm/day
	
The chemical is traveling at VR = Vwater /Rd = (10 cm/day)/(11.4) = 0.877 cm/day
	
Time for the chemical to travel 10 m = (10 m)(100 cm/m)/(0.877 cm/hr) = 1140 days
The retardation factor is strongly related to solubility – higher solubility means a lower retardation 
coefficient. For example, the solubility of chloroform is 8,200 mg/L and chlorobenzene is 500 mg/L; 
their retardations factors are 3 and 35.
Rd also depends on the chemical nature of the aquifer and on the chemical concentration. The retardation 
coefficient is higher at low concentrations, and low at high concentrations. This means it becomes more 
difficult to extract chemical from a contaminated site as it becomes cleaner. The residual adsorbed 
chemical is released more slowly from the soil.

Redirecting Groundwater Flow by Pumping
A pumped well changes the local hydraulic gradient and can be used to divert a contaminated flow away 
from drinking water wells. The pumped well can also be used to extract contaminated groundwater for 
treatment. Figure 9.3 shows how pumping creates a draw down cone (in effect, a drain hole) around the 
well that will collect and accelerate the withdrawal of groundwater.
Figure 9.4 shows a hypothetical spill or leak of an organic chemical pollutant that is dense enough to 
sink. It may also exist as a vapor in the unsaturated soil zone (the zone above the groundwater table), 
as a dissolved molecule in the moving groundwater, and be adsorbed onto the soil. A pump-and-treat 
facility is proposed to extract the contaminated water before reaches the city well water water supply.

Case Study: Tucson International Airport Area (TIAA) Superfund Site
Models are used to understand how a problem developed and to predict how it will unfold in the future. 
A model may be needed to estimate how much chemical was spilled or leaked into the groundwater, and 
when the material first entered the groundwater. Rarely does one find reliable records about quantities 
and kinds of chemical that were lost.
How quickly will the contaminant travel, and in which direction, and how will the concentrations change 
over time? Can the spread of the plume be contained by strategically located wells? How many wells 
would be needed, where should they be located, and what pumping capacity should be installed? As 
time goes on, and the plume changes in size and concentration, how should the containment or cleanup 
program be modified? Is the expected time scale of the project months or years?
There is no way to answer these questions without modeling. Monitoring data, even long records, cannot 
be extrapolated toward future conditions once we start containment or remediation.

Figure 9.5 Trichloroethylene (TCE) plume at the Tucson International Airport Area (TIAA) in 1987 before the 
Superfund cleanup began.
Figure 9.5 is a 1987 map of a trichloroethylene (TCE) plume at the Tucson International Airport Area 
(TIAA). At least twenty separate facilities have operated at the TIAA since 1942, including aircraft and 
electronics facilities that discharged waste liquids directly into the soil in the World War II era.
Trichloroethylene does not occur naturally in the environment. It is used as a metal degreaser, and 
may be found in paint and cleaning fluids. It evaporates easily, but if released onto soil it readily enters 
the groundwater. The state and Federal drinking water standards for TCE are 5 µg/L and 3 µg/L for 
1,4-Dioxane. Drinking water with these contaminates may cause kidney, liver, and lung damage, and 
lymphoma.

Figure 9.6 TCE plume in groundwater at the Tucson International Airport Area 
Superfund Site in 2010. TCE = 5 µg/L in drinking water. The dark red areas are where 
the TCE plume was above 5 µg/L TCE. The light red areas is where the 1,4-Dioxane 
plume was above 3 µg/L.The highest TCE concentrations were about 300 µg/L. 
Source: Arizona Dept. of Environmental Quallity. (More detailed maps of the TCE 
and 1,4-Dioxane plumes, that can be found by searching for TCE Plume, TIAA 
CERCLA Site, Tucson.)
The area was named a Superfund site in 1982 and subsequent sampling identified a main plume of 
contaminated groundwater approximately 0.5 miles (0.8 km) wide and 5 miles (8 km) long. In 1982, 
when cleanup started, the contaminants were found 25 to 30 meters below ground surface in an aquifer 
that is 20 to 30 meters thick. Additional smaller plumes of contamination north and northwest of the 
airport have been found. The plumes are moving west toward the river.
Figure 9.6 shows the TCE and 1,4-Dioxane plumes in 2010, after a 20-year, $20 million cleanup. More 
than 100 million cubic meters of groundwater have been extracted and treated to remove more than 
60,000 kg of volatile organic chemicals. The dark red areas are where the TCE plume was above 5 µg/L 
TCE. The light red areas are where the 1,4-Dioxane plume was above 3 µg/L. It may take another 20 
years of cleaning to meet the drinking water standard.

Conclusion
Groundwater modeling is a challenge because there typically is not a lot of data when the project begins. 
Air pollution modeling generally will have the most dense data sets and groundwater will be the most 
sparse. Monitoring wells need to be installed. Analyzing the water samples for toxic organic chemicals 
requires special methods. The groundwater moves slowly so doing repeated sampling over a short time 
does not provide a great deal of new information. The slow rates of movement and change dampen the 
sudden changes and seasonality that can complicate air and surface water quality modeling.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
10	 Guidelines for Environmental 
Protection
10.1	
Introduction
Investments in water supply and sanitation usually yield economic benefits. The reductions in adverse 
health effects and health care costs outweigh the cost of intervention. Nevertheless, environmental 
protection often comes after the development of schools, hospitals, telecommunications, transportation 
and other national needs. This was true in the United States and in Europe. And it usually comes under 
pressure from a collection of laws that protect environmental quality and public health.
Every pollution control project has a legal component. The laws are complicated. It is difficult, but 
necessary, to learn the applicable rules and regulations and work within the legal constraints they 
impose. They will dictate which chemicals and substances are to be controlled, and they constrain the 
quantities and concentrations that may be released into the environment. Some laws specify pollution 
control technology. Some prescribe analytical methods and how remedial investigations are to be done. 
They establish requirements for getting permits to discharge effluents and gaseous emissions, and to 
transport and store solid wastes.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
The laws have been developed with an understanding of the natural cycles of carbon, nitrogen and 
phosphorus. They are based on the science of toxicology and bioassays, and on the engineering methods 
of risk assessment and calculating the fate of pollutants in the environment. These are the subjects in the 
previous chapters.
In this chapter we undertake a brief survey of the most important World Health Organization guidelines, 
European Union directives, and United States federal laws. This is necessarily superficial, but those 
who are not familiar with environmental law may find the material helpful as a guide to finding more 
details, if they should be desired. Fortunately, vast amounts of information are readily available on web 
sites of the USEPA, the European Union, and the World Health Organization. The USEPA has delegated 
implementation of the laws to the states, as the European Union has done for its members, and this creates 
another second level of accessible information. Wikipedia is also an excellent source of information.
10.2	
International Environmental Agreements
The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, produced at the 1992 Earth Summit, consisted 
of 27 principles for future sustainable development around the world (Wikipedia). Three of these are:
•	 In order to achieve sustainable development, environmental protection shall constitute an 
integral part of the development process chain and cannot be considered in isolation from it.
•	 States shall enact effective environmental legislation. Environmental standards, management 
objectives and priorities should reflect the environmental and developmental context 
to which they apply. Standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate and of 
unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries, in particular developing countries.
•	 Peace, development and environmental protection are interdependent and indivisible.”
The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty that sets binding obligations on industrialized countries to 
reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The goal is to prevent “dangerous” human-induced interference 
of the climate system.
Many developed countries have agreed in two commitments periods. The first period applied to 
greenhouse gas emissions between 2008–2012. Developed countries may use emissions trading until 
late 2014 or 2015 to meet their first-round targets. The second commitment period applies to emissions 
between 2013–2020, but this amendment has (as of January 2013) not entered into legal force.
The 37 countries with binding targets in the second commitment period are Australia, all members of the 
European Union, Belarus, Croatia, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Norway, Switzerland, and Ukraine. Japan, New 
Zealand, and Russia participated in Kyoto’s first round but have not taken on new targets in the second 
commitment period. The United States signed but did not ratify the Protocol and Canada withdrew 
from it in 2011.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer of 1985 is a multilateral environmental 
agreement that was ratified by 196 states, including all United Nations members and the European 
Union. It acts as a framework for international efforts to protect the ozone layer, but it does not include 
legally binding reduction goals for the use of CFCs, the main chemical agents causing ozone depletion. 
These are laid out in the accompanying Montreal Protocol.

Drinking Water
The WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO 2011) explain the science and risk assessment 
methods behind the WHO chemical and microbiological standards. The guidelines provide toxicity data 
and explain how the guidelines were established for the toxic metals and organic chemicals listed in 
Table 10.1. Guidelines are also given for agricultural chemicals (nitrate and pesticides) and radionuclides.
The use of ‘guidelines’, as opposed to standards or mandatory limits, is in recognition that the minimum 
requirements for safety are universal, but the nature and form of drinking water standards may vary 
among countries.

Table 10.1 Guideline values for chemicals that are of health significance in drinking water (WHO 2011).
a Only chemical aspects of uranium addressed; radiation risk not included.
b For non-threshold substances, the guideline value is the concentration in drinking-water associated with an upper bound excess 
lifetime cancer risk of 10-5 (one additional cancer per 100 000 of the population ingesting drinking water containing the substance at 
the guideline value for 70 years). Concentrations associated with estimated upper-bound excess lifetime cancer risks of 10-4 and 10-6 
can be calculated by multiplying and dividing, respectively, the guideline value by 10.

Air Quality
WHO (2011) states these basic facts about air pollution:
•	 Air pollution is a major environmental risk to health.
•	 By reducing air pollution levels, we can help countries reduce the global burden of disease 
from respiratory infections, heart disease, and lung cancer.
•	 Exposure to air pollutants is largely beyond the control of individuals and requires action by 
public authorities at the national, regional and even international levels.
•	 The lower the levels of air pollution in a city, the better respiratory and cardiovascular health 
of the population will be.
•	 Urban outdoor air pollution is estimated to cause 1.3 million deaths worldwide per year. 
Those living in middle-income countries disproportionately experience this burden.
•	 Indoor air pollution is estimated to cause approximately 2 million premature deaths mostly 
in developing countries. Almost half of these deaths are due to pneumonia in children 
under 5 years of age.
The WHO Air Quality Guidelines (2009) represent the most widely agreed upon and up-to-date 
assessment of health effects of air pollution, recommending targets for air quality at which the health 
risks are significantly reduced. Table 10.2 summarizes the WHO air quality guidelines (2006).

Table 10.2 WHO Air Quality Guidelines (2006).
Outdoor urban air pollution, much of it generated by vehicles, is associated with higher rates of 
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Exhaust from gasoline and diesel engines contains irritating 
and toxic chemicals. Sulfur dioxide is corrosive. Ozone is dangerous to persons with breathing disorders 
(e.g., asthma). In general, particles emitted by fuel combustion processes may contain or carry more 
toxic compounds (e.g. metals) than particles from natural sources such as dust storms. SO2 emissions 
are contributed mainly by thermal power generation and NO2 is an indicator of vehicular pollution, 
although it is produced in almost all combustion reactions. Particulate matter (PM) is the most general 
indicator of pollution because it receives key contributions from fossil fuel burning, industrial processes, 
and vehicular exhaust.
Figure 10.1 is a World Health Organization map of deaths attributable to urban air pollution (WHO 2009).

Figure 10.1 maps the WHO estimates of premature deaths caused by urban air pollution. The 2008 estimate 
was some 1.3 million deaths around the world (WHO 2009) and that more than 1 million deaths could 
be avoided if the mean annual Air Quality Guideline values of PM10 = 20μg/m3 and PM2.5 =10 μg/m3 
were implemented. At present, total PM10 or PM2.5 mass concentrations per volume of ambient air are 
considered to be the best indicators of potentially health-damaging exposures for risk reduction purposes.
10.3.3	
Particulate Matter
Particulate matter (PM) affects more people than any other pollutant. The major components of PM are 
sulfate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, carbon, mineral dust and water. It consists of a complex 
mixture of solid and liquid particles of organic and inorganic substances suspended in the air.
The particles are identified according to their aerodynamic diameter, as either PM10 (particles with an 
aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm) or PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm). Particle shape and chemical 
composition as well as size are thought to influence their harmfulness, as do the metals or adsorbed 
organic chemical that adsorb to their surface. The PM2.5 fraction has also been measured for several years 
in the U.S. The EU has started to measure PM2.5, although the present standards only apply to PM10. 
Some measurements have also been initiated to study the very smallest particles, such as PM1 and PM0.1.
The very fine particles are considered the most harmful because they may be inhaled deep into the 
bronchioles, and interfere with gas exchange inside the lungs. Studies made in the U.S. and in Europe have 
shown that a rise in the concentration of small particles, even from low levels, causes a rise in mortalities 
from respiratory, cardiac and circulatory diseases, and more people seek hospital care for bronchitis and 
asthma. Even exposure to low levels for long periods is considered harmful. The Guidelines indicate 
that reducing particulate matter (PM10) pollution from 70 to 20 micrograms per cubic meter can cut air 
quality related deaths by around 15%.
The mortality in cities with high levels of pollution exceeds that observed in relatively cleaner cities by 
15–20%. Average life expectancy in the EU is reduced by 8.6 months due to exposure to PM2.5 produced 
by human activities. Calculations for Austria, Switzerland, and France indicate that PM10 particles at 
current levels cause 40,000 premature deaths a year, and the average life expectancy of people living 
in an urban environment is reduced by 18 months. A recent study on 19 European cities with a total 
population of 32 million concluded that reducing the levels of PM10 by just 5 µg/m3 would prevent more 
than 5,500 premature deaths annually in those cities. Furthermore, these particles trigger half a million 
asthma attacks each year and lead to a total of 16 million lost person-days of activity.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
In response to the growing body of evidence regarding the health impacts of particulates, the 2006 WHO 
Air Quality guidelines for the first time set guideline values for PM2.5 and PM10. The guidelines are
	
PM2.5	
10 µg/m3 annual mean	 	
25 µg/m3 24-hour mean
	
PM10 	 20 µg/m3 annual mean	 	
50 µg/m3 hourly mean
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has a standard of 50 μg/m3 annual mean for 
PM10 ambient air levels, and the annual mean limit value set by a European Union directive is 40 μg/m3.
As a reference point, New York City has an average PM10 = 13 µg/m3. The cleanest city in the world, 
as measured by air particulates, is Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, with PM10 = 6 µg/m3; the dirtiest was 
Ahvaz, Iran with PM10 = 372 µg/m3 (WHO 2011).
10.3.4	
Ozone (O3)
Ozone at ground level (not to be confused with the ozone layer in the stratosphere) is one of the major 
constituents of photochemical smog. It is formed by the reaction with sunlight (photochemical reaction) 
of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) from vehicle and industry emissions and volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs) emitted by vehicles, solvents and industry. The highest levels of ozone pollution 
occur during periods of sunny weather.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
Excessive ozone can cause breathing problems, trigger asthma, reduce lung function and cause lung 
diseases. In Europe it is currently one of the air pollutants of most concern. Several European studies 
have reported that every 10 µg/m3 increase in ozone exposure increases the daily mortality by 0.3%.
The previously recommended limit, which was fixed at 120 μg/m3 8-hour mean, has been reduced to 
100 μg/m3, based on recent conclusive associations between daily mortality and ozone levels occurring 
at ozone concentrations below 120 µg/m3.
10.3.5	
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
The major sources of anthropogenic emissions of NO2 are combustion processes (heating, power 
generation, and engines in vehicles and ships). NO2 is the main source of nitrate aerosols, which form an 
important fraction of PM2.5 and, in the presence of ultraviolet light, of ozone. At short-term concentrations 
exceeding 200 µg/m3, it is a toxic gas that causes significant inflammation of the airways. The guideline 
values are 40 µg/m3annual mean and 200 µg/m31-hour mean.
10.3.6	
Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)
The main anthropogenic source of SO2, a colorless gas with a sharp odor, is the burning of sulfur-
containing fossil fuels (coal and oil) for domestic heating, power generation, operating motor vehicles, 
and the smelting of mineral ores that contain sulfur.
SO2 can affect the function of the lungs and cause irritation of the eyes. Inflammation of the respiratory 
tract causes coughing, aggravates asthma and chronic bronchitis, and makes people more prone to 
respiratory tract infections. Mortality and hospital admissions for cardiac disease increase on days with 
higher SO2 levels. A proportion of people with asthma experience change in pulmonary function and 
respiratory symptoms after periods of exposure to SO2 as short as 10 minutes. The guideline values are 
24-hour mean = 20 µg/m3and 10-minute mean = 500 µg/m3.
10.3.7	
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
A large group of pollutants is known collectively as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They can occur 
either as gases or bound to particles. Several of the substances in this group contribute to the formation 
of ground-level ozone – which probably is the most significant health effect of this group as a whole.
The group includes known carcinogens such as benzene and various aromatic hydrocarbons. The nitrated 
polyaromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAH), several of which are present in diesel exhaust fumes, are some 
of the most carcinogenic substances known. At present the EU has a limit only for benzene, which is 
5 µg/m3.

European Union (EU Directives)
10.4.1	
Background
The European Union (EU) is a relatively new entity, but it rapidly assumed a leadership role in international 
environmental policy, starting in the late 1980s and strengthening thereafter. The EU Environmental 
Policy Handbook gives the history and explains the EU Directives (Scheur 2005).
10.4.2	
REACH Regulations – Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals
The REACH regulations took seven years to pass. It has been described as the most complex legislation 
in EU history and the most important in 20 years. It is the strictest law to date regulating chemical 
substances and will affect industries throughout the world.
REACH entered into force in 2007, with a phased implementation over the next decade. When it is 
fully in force, REACH will require all companies manufacturing or importing chemical substances into 
the EU in quantities of one tonne or more per year to register these substances with a new European 
Chemicals Agency (ECHA). Since REACH applies to some substances that are contained in objects, any 
company importing goods into Europe could be affected.
Bringing substances to the European market that have not been pre-registered or registered is illegal 
(known in REACH as “no data, no market”). Chemicals manufactured or imported in amounts of 1000 
tonnes were required to be registered by December 2010. The deadlines were June 2013 for 100 tonnes 
and June 2018 for 1 tonne. About 143,000 chemical substances marketed in the European Union were 
pre-registered by December 2008.
Substance Information Exchange Forums (SIEFs) were formed to allow all manufacturers, importers, 
and data holders who are dealing with the same substance to join forces and finances to create one 
registration dossier. A SIEF requires cooperation between many legal entities, which must find each 
other, communicate openly and honestly, share data, and share costs in a fair and transparent way.
There are special requirements for chemical substances of very high concern (SVHC). As of June 2012, 
there were 84 SVHCs. The European Chemicals Agency must be notified if the total quantity used is 
more than one tonne per year and the SVHC is present at more than 0.1% of the mass of the object. 
Applicants for authorization must include plans to replace the SVHC with a safer alternative (if no safer 
alternative exists, the applicant must work to find one).

Air Quality and Air Emissions
Air pollution has been a priority since the early days of EU environmental protection. In 2005 the EC 
adopted a thematic strategy on air pollution, and the Clean Air for Europe Programme (CAFÉ) provides 
technical analysis and policy development. The European Pollutant Emission Register, the first European-
wide register of industrial emissions into air and water, has been extended to include more emitting 
facilities, require more substances to be reported, encourage wider coverage and public participation, 
and require annual instead of triennial reporting.
The EU Limit Values (LV) and Target Values (TV) for ambient air quality are given in Table 10.3. The 
LV is fixed with the aim of avoiding, preventing or reducing harmful effects on human health and/or 
the environment as a whole, to be attained within a given period and not to be exceeded once attained. 
The TV is fixed with the aim of avoiding more long-term harmful effects on human health and/or the 
environment as a whole, to be attained where possible over a given period.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
The climate change levy seeks to reduce emissions in energy-intensive industry sectors (such as brewing, 
cement, printing, and animal feed). Emissions trading (cap-and-trade) offers economic incentives for 
achieving reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide). Companies that emit 
the pollutant are given credits or allowances which represent a right to emit a specific amount, and if 
they exceed their allowances they must buy credits from those who pollute less than their allowances. 
In theory, the more firms that need to buy credits, the higher the price of credits becomes, which makes 
reducing emissions cost-effective in comparison.
This is a simplified hypothetical example of how a cap-and-trade system might work. Two emissions 
sources, A and B, both emit 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The government gives each of them 95,000 
emission allowances with one allowance representing the right to emit 1 tonne of CO2. Both installations 
A and B are, therefore, 5,000 allowances short (5%) of covering their annual CO2 output. The plant owners 
face the same choice: either reduce their emissions by 5,000 tonnes, or purchase 5,000 allowances on 
the market. In order to decide which option to pursue, they will compare the costs of reducing their 
emissions by 5,000 tonnes with the projected market price for allowances. And, as permits become more 
limited and their prices rise, A and/or B might decide to invest in CO2 reduction strategies instead.

Water
Water resources are limited and supply and sanitation systems are under pressure from urbanization and 
climate change. The water policy of the EU is primarily codified in three directives:
•	 The 1991 Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive concerning discharges of municipal and 
some industrial waste waters;
•	 The 1998 Drinking Water Directive concerning potable water quality;
•	 The 2000 Water Framework Directive concerning water resources management.
The framework for water management aims to improve water quality, reduce risks from drought or 
flooding, and stop the deterioration of wetlands and other ecological habitats. The key concept is river 
basin management, which requires closer co-operation between competent authorities, often across 
boundaries. A River Basin Management Plan should set out how inland and coastal waters can achieve 
‘good status’ by the year 2015.
EU member states have enacted national legislation in accordance with these directives. The institutional 
organization of public water supply and sanitation remains the responsibility of each member state, not 
the EU.
10.4.5	
Waste
The EU defines waste as that which the holder discards or intends to discard, or is required to discard, 
a definition which aims to be as inclusive as possible. Sub-categories of waste include: municipal solid 
waste, hazardous waste, special waste, hospital and clinical waste, ash and slag from combustion processes, 
agricultural waste, sludge from waste water treatment, and mining waste.
The European Union produces 1.3 billion tonnes of waste each year, including manufacturing and 
construction and demolition waste but excluding mining and agricultural and forestry wastes. This 
amounts to about 3.5 tonnes of solid waste for every person (European Environment Agency 2002). 
The five major waste streams are manufacturing (26%), mining and quarrying (29%), construction and 
demolition (22%) and municipal solid waste (14%), and a large but not precisely known quantity of 
agricultural and forestry waste. About 27 million tones, or 2%, of this waste is hazardous waste (Eurostat 
2000). (Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, provides on-line access to economic and 
environmental data.).

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
A measure of the complexity and importance of waste management is that it has the longest section in 
the Handbook for Implementation of EU Environmental Legislation. The aim is to ensure recovery or 
disposal without pollution risk. The waste management hierarchy prioritizes (in descending order) re-use, 
recycling and recovery, use as a source of energy, incineration without energy, recovery, and landfilling 
(the least desirable option).
The key principles are:
•	 Proximity Principle. Waste should be disposed of as closely as possible to its place of 
generation, following the principle that environmental damage should, if possible, be 
rectified at the source.
•	 Producer Liability (Polluter pays). Liability rules ensure that any environmental damage is 
restored and the cost of cleanup work will be born by the person that generated the waste 
and not by the average taxpayer. Producers of waste must bear the costs of having licensed 
transporters and managers of waste handle their waste, especially hazardous waste. The 
owner of the land where waste is deposited, legally or illegally, also can be considered to be 
the holder of the waste and thereby responsible for ensuring its safe treatment or disposal 
(Eunomia 2003).
•	 Producer responsibility. Producer responsibility is different from producer liability. Producer 
liability deals with damage that is caused by a product that has to be compensated. Producer 
responsibility creates an obligation to recover products or to collect waste, to establish funds 
or schemes for recovery or recycling, to organize recycling or recovery, or consider product 
disposal during design and manufacture of the product.
10.5	
India and China
There is no umbrella of environmental regulations for Asia, but many countries have well codified 
environmental protection plans. Implementation and enforcement are increasing in proportion to 
economic growth and stability.
India and China are the two most important countries because of their large populations and their rapid 
industrialization. Since most of the growth in greenhouse gas emissions is projected to occur in developing 
countries, such as India and China, their successful enactment and enforcement of environmental 
regulations will contribute greatly to the well being of our planet.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
India has a rich history of environmental regulations. The Constitution of India states that it is the duty 
of the state to ‘protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the 
country’. It imposes a duty on every citizen ‘to protect and improve the natural environment including 
forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife’. Three important laws are:
•	 The Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Act (1974) established standards for water 
quality and effluents, and required polluting industries to seek permission to discharge waste 
into effluent bodies.
•	 The Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act (1981) provides for the control and 
abatement of air pollution.
•	 The Environment Protection Act (1986) filled many gaps in other laws. It authorizes the 
central government to protect and improve environmental quality, control and reduce 
pollution from all sources, and lay down procedures for setting standards of emission or 
discharge of environmental pollutants.
Actual enforcement of environmental regulations is done at the state level.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
China has been one of the top performing countries in terms of GDP growth (9.64% annually over 
the past ten years). The high economic growth has put immense pressure on its environment and the 
environmental challenges that China faces are greater than in most countries. In 1983, China implemented 
a sustainable development strategy outlined in Table 10.4.

China has taken several initiatives to increase its protection of the environment and combat environmental 
degradation:
•	 China’s investment in renewable energy grew 18% in 2007 to $15.6 billion, accounting for 
approximately 10% of the global investment in this area.
•	 In 2008, spending on the environment was 1.49% of GDP, up 3.4 times from 2000.
•	 The discharge of CO (carbon monoxide) and SO2 (sulfur dioxide) decreased by 6.61% and 
8.95% in 2008 compared with that in 2005.
•	 China’s protected nature reserves have increased substantially. In 1978 there were only 34 
compared with 2,538 in 2010. The protected nature reserve system now occupies 15.5% of 
the country’s land area; this is higher than the world average.

History
Until the 1970s the amount of pollution put into the environment in the U.S. grew along with the 
population and industrial productivity. In the 1960s and early 1970s there was great emphasis on 
wastewater treatment, with new laws and financial assistance from the government to cities to build 
treatment plants. In the late 1970s serious efforts and investments began to reduce air pollution, to 
improve the disposal of solid wastes, and to remediate sites where hazardous and toxic wastes had been 
improperly handled. This history and the general reduction in pollutant discharges and emissions are 
shown in Figure 10.2.
The 1990s emphasized clean manufacturing, green manufacturing, waste minimization and design for 
environment. These ideas have been well known and widely used by engineers from the 1940s, although 
with the less emotional names of water conservation, water recycling, water reuse, energy conservation, 
waste segregation, and material reclamation.
Figure 10.2 The progress of pollution control as a result of new legislation and serious financial investments starting 
in the late 1960s has been impressive.
Table 10.5 lists the major federal legislation related to environmental protection. Mechanisms for the 
control of toxic pollutants are contained in several federal regulations, such as the Toxic Substance 
Control Act (PL 94-469), Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(PL 96-510), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (PL 95-580), Clean Water Act (PL 95-217), Clean 
Air Act (PL 95-95), and the Safe Drinking Water Act (PL 93-523). PL indicates Public Law. CFR is Code 
of Federal Regulations. Appendix 4 explains how Federal laws and regulations are developed.

Pollution Prevention and Control: Part I 
Human Health and Environmental Quality
195 
Guidelines for Environmental Protection
The Clean Water Act (CWA) lists 148 pollutants, the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act (RCRA) 
lists 502, the Clean Air Act (CAA) lists 189, the Occupational Safety & Health Act (OSHA) lists 450, 
and the Emergency Planning & Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) lists 599. Only 49 chemicals 
are regulated under all five of these acts, 119 are regulated under 4 acts, and 768 are regulated under 
only one. Each list omits pollutants that are on all four other lists, and each list includes pollutants that 
are not on any other list. The Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act list a total of 269 pollutants and 
only 68 (25.3%) are common to both laws; all other two-way pairings of laws have a lower percentage 
of common pollutants with the lowest being 13% for CWA and OSHA (Dernbach 1977).
This is the result of each law having been formulated in isolation of the others and of Congress separately 
adopting the lists of pollutants for the statutes. It is also, in part, due to the USEPA having to develop 
the lists when less was known about the toxic properties of the chemicals and their behavior in the 
environment. We now have better scientific knowledge and years of experience. This means that the 
engineer may be able to negotiate terms of a discharge permit or cleanup regulation that take into account 
special features of a local problem.
Pollution prevention is one way for a discharger to avoid this snarl of regulations. Do not bring a listed 
chemical or substance into the factory as a raw material or raw material contaminant. Capture regulated 
pollutants at the source within the manufacturing process in as pure a form as possible to facilitate reuse 
or safe disposal. Do not burn substances that will cause a toxic emission, or burn them at such a high 
temperature that the substances are completely destroyed.
10.6.2	
The Safe Drinking Water Act
The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 is not a pollution control law, but it does directly protect 
human health by setting maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) on a list of inorganic chemicals and ions, 
organic substances, radioactive substances, and pathogenic microorganisms. The public water utility is 
responsible for maintaining these levels until the water arrives at the consumer’s tap. The MCL levels, 
the health effect, and the recommended treatment methods for each parameter are given in Appendix 
1. The best and most economical way to keep these chemicals out of drinking water is to control them 
in effluents and emissions.
10.6.3	
The Clean Water Act (CWA)
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the 
Water Quality Act of 1987, established the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). 
The federal government has delegated NPDES authority to all 50 states.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
Every point source discharge of wastewater, such as municipal treatment plants, industries, animal 
feedlots, aquatic animal production facilities, and mining operations, is required to have a NPDES permit. 
The permit specifies effluent limits, a compliance schedule, monitoring and reporting requirements, and 
any other terms and conditions necessary to protect water quality. Permits are renewed every five years, 
at which time the allowable effluent concentrations, mass discharge rates, or the specific compounds 
that must be monitored may be changed.
The categories of pollutants are listed in Table 10.6.
Conventional Pollutants
All dischargers must submit information on biochemical oxygen demand, chemical 
oxygen demand, total organic carbon, total suspended solids, and ammonia.
Conventional Pollutants, 
Radioactivity and Certain 
Inorganic Pollutants.
 Effluent limits for fecal coliforms, oil and grease, fluoride, nitrate and nitrite, 
phosphorus, sulfate, and bromide are established only if they are expected to be 
present.
Toxic or “Priority” 
Pollutants (129 pollutants 
listed).
All discharges are analyzed for cyanide, phenol, and heavy metals. Monitoring for 
other chemicals may be required if the effluent contains industrial process water (as 
opposed to storm water runoff).
Hazardous Substances 
and Asbestos
Monitoring will be required for additional toxic substances that are expected to be 
present.
Table 10.6 Categories of Pollutants used in the NPDES permit application.
The CWA sets forth water quality criteria for surface waters that protect human health from the harmful 
effects of pollutants in the water and from the consumption of fish. The criteria are based solely on data 
and scientific judgments: they do not consider economic or social impacts. The human health water 
quality criteria for the priority and non-priority pollutants are given in Appendix 2.
The act also sets aquatic life criteria for acute toxicity and chronic toxicity in freshwater and saltwater 
(see Appendix 3). These national guidelines are intended to protect the vast majority of the aquatic 
communities in the United States.
10.6.4	
Biosolids Management
Biosolids are the concentrated solid residue of wastewater that has been processed by biological treatment. 
This residue may be a slurry (3% to 8% solids by weight) or a semi-dry cake (18% or more solids by 
weight). The beneficial use of biosolids, which usually means recycling the biosolids as a soil conditioner 
or fertilizer on farms is encouraged, but it is also strictly regulated. Obviously, beneficial use can occur 
only if the biosolids present no unacceptable risk to humans or the environment. The USEPA’s ‘503 
regulations’ control risk by setting limits on nine metals, bacterial quality, and insect and vector control.
The risk assessment guidelines are more flexible than those used in Superfund and the Clean

Water Act. Superfund risk assessment protects the most exposed individual (MEI). The 503 
regulations protect a highly exposed individual (HEI), who lives in nearly normal conditions. The 
numerical standards and a discussion of the risk assessment methods were given in Chapter 
5. 10.6.5	 Industrial Pretreatment Regulations
Amendments to the original Clean Water Act (PL 92-500) deal specifically with the difficulties caused 
by industries putting toxic or hazardous substances into municipal sewers or treatment plants. The 
pretreatment rules prohibited the discharge of:
•	 Substances that create a fire or explosive hazard.
•	 Corrosive materials and discharges with a pH of less than 5.
•	 Solid or viscous materials in amounts that will obstruct flow or interfere with operation of a 
municipal wastewater treatment plant.
•	 Heated discharges that will inhibit, interfere with, or damage biological wastewater 
treatment processes, or which will create temperatures which exceed 65°C (150°F) in 
the wastewater collection system and 40°C (104°F) at the treatment plant unless other 
temperature limits have been approved.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
10.6.6	
The Clean Air Act
Air pollution is the release of unwanted particles (dusts and solid particles), gases (vapors or fumes), or 
aerosols (minute particles) into the air by either “natural” or “human” sources. An air pollution source 
can be stationary (industries) or mobile (automobiles). In the U.S. mobile sources contribute at least as 
much or more toxic compounds to the atmosphere than stationary sources.
Significant reductions have been made in outdoor air pollution in the United States. Between 1970 and 
2004, total emissions of the six major air pollutants regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) dropped by 54 percent. This is particularly impressive when noted that the gross domestic product 
increased 187 percent, energy consumption increased 47 percent, and U.S. population grew by 40 percent 
during the same time, which shows that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand 
in hand.
There are two types of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Primary standards are 
designed to protect the public health. Secondary standards are designed to protect the public welfare (e.g., 
vegetation and building materials). The NAAQS summarized in Table 10.7, specify the concentration 
(µg/m3) of a pollutant in ambient air above which humans or the environment may experience some 
adverse effects. The NAAQS differentiate between long-term and short-term exposure: some are based 
on short-term averages, while others are based on an annual average.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
Outdoor urban air pollution, much of it generated by vehicles, is associated with higher rates of 
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Very fine particles, less than 10 µm diameter, inhaled into the 
lungs are irritants and the particles may carry metals or adsorbed organic chemicals that are dangerous.
Ozone itself is not emitted. It is formed in the presence of sunlight, through a series of complex reactions 
involving volatile organic compounds. In extreme ozone non-attainment areas, sources with the potential 
to emit 10 tons of VOCs per year are considered “major.” In less seriously affected areas a major source 
may be defined as one that emits 50 ton/yr or even 100 ton/yr.
The 1990 Amendments established the Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP) program that regulates an 
additional 189 specific toxic compounds. A major HAP facility is one that emits, or has the potential to 
emit, 10 or more tons per year of any single HAP or 25 ton/yr of a combination of HAPs. Major HAP 
source categories must install Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) to achieve emission 
standards. Industrial facilities may be required to develop control technology on the basis of risk 
assessment. Emission rates in permits are specified as mass rates (e.g. lb/hr or tons/yr).
10.6.7	
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
The Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) of 1965, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) in 
1976, and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984 are collectively known as 
RCRA. RCRA controls hazardous waste generators, transporters, and treatment and disposal facilities 
and applies to wastes that were disposed of after November 1980. Appendix 5 is an expanded version 
of this summary of RCRA.
RCRA regulates hazardous wastes ‘from the cradle to the grave’. Any person, company, transporter, or 
previous waste disposal facility owner that ever had contact with any waste now located at a problem site 
is liable for problems arising from disposal of the waste. In the language of RCRA, they are a responsible 
party. In short, there is no way to contract away one’s liability for hazardous waste management. Thus, 
generators and waste handlers are forced to consider the long-term risks associated with disposal as well 
as the short-term costs.
RCRA, despite its name, does not require resource conservation and recovery, but it does encourage 
these practices by imposing standards for managing hazardous wastes today to prevent future problems. 
Actual recycling is unregulated (except waste burned as fuel), but generation, transportation, and storage 
of solid waste prior to recycling are regulated. In most cases, waste generated from treatment and storage 
of a hazardous waste remains a hazardous waste.
Solid waste is a regulatory term that does not refer to a material’s physical state. A solid waste is any 
discarded material that is not excluded or delisted. Delisting is the process by which a generator petitions 
on a case-by-case basis to have a hazardous waste reclassified as a nonhazardous waste.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
A discarded material is any material that is (1) disposed, stored, or treated before its disposal; (2) burned 
as a fuel, treated, recycled, abandoned, considered inherently waste-like; or (3) stored or accumulated 
before recycling. If the material does not fit this definition it is not a RCRA hazardous waste, but it may 
be regulated under others laws.
Hazardous waste is a subset of solid waste. For the material to be a hazardous waste it must first be a solid 
waste. A solid waste may be classified as hazardous because it is a listed hazardous waste or because it has 
characteristics that make it hazardous. The characteristics that make a waste hazardous are ignitability, 
corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity.
A special concern is the leaching of toxic components into groundwater and the potential for this to 
occur is measured using the Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP).
10.6.8	
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)
“Superfund” is the nickname for the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
Liability Act (CERCLA). Superfund provides the mechanisms for investigation, assessment, and 
remediation of past mistakes, in particular abandoned and contaminated sites that were not operating 
under a RCRA permit or where contamination is found and there is no responsible party willing or 
financially able to undertake cleanup. Appendix 6 is an expanded version of this summary of CERCLA.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) required EPA to involve the states 
in hazardous waste identification and cleanup activities. The states regulate many more uncontrolled 
hazardous waste sites than the USEPA. State-regulated sites do not have access to the Superfund Trust, 
but many states have similar programs for managing abandoned or underfunded sites.
A site under Superfund must be cleaned to specified levels using any technically and economically feasible 
means. Superfund activities conducted completely on a site do not require federal, state, or local permits, 
but must comply with any applicable regulations. RCRA, in contrast, specifies cleanup levels and cleanup 
technology, regardless of cost-effectiveness, and in addition the site must obtain the appropriate permits. 
RCRA corrective actions often require a facility to follow CERCLA guidance.
Under Superfund, hazardous substances are governed under strict liability, that is, liability even when 
there has been no negligence. This means that anyone who handles hazardous wastes is liable for all 
resulting injuries regardless of how much care has been exercised. This principle also holds under RCRA.
Hazardous waste sites are examined and rated with respect to the substances involved, their tendency to 
migrate from the site, their toxicity, and other factors related to environmental health and safety. Sites 
with high scores are placed on the National Priorities List (NPL). Listing does not mean that the site is 
an immediate threat to public health, but it is considered to have some significant, long-term threat to 
public health.
Each site on the NPL that is targeted for remedial action must conduct a remedial investigation (RI) 
and feasibility study (FS). Risk assessment is an important part of this process and it is done on each 
remedial option, including the ‘no action’ option. The final remedial action plan, known as the record 
of decision, or ROD, outlines the remediation goals and procedures. It will provide a public history of 
the site, the RI/FS, the risk assessment, the alternative cleanup methods considered, and the rationale 
behind the remedy selected.
10.6.9	
Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
The 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) is focused mainly on controlling chemical manufacturing 
and processing, and less on the treatment and disposal of wastes. TSCA regulates individual chemicals 
whereas RCRA regulates waste streams that may contain multiple chemical substances. EPA may regulate 
a chemical under TSCA only if that chemical is found to ‘present an unreasonable risk of injury to human 
health or the environment’. To determine unreasonable risk, EPA must conduct an economic cost/benefit 
analysis. RCRA does not require economic factors to be considered in its rulemaking.

10.6.10	 Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA)
The 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) created the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA), which was given the authority both to set and enforce workplace health and 
safety standards. The Act also established the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health 
(NIOSH), an independent research institute.
The ‘general duty clause’ requires employers to
•	 Maintain conditions or adopt practices reasonably necessary and appropriate to protect 
workers on the job;
•	 Be familiar with and comply with standards applicable to their establishments; and
•	 Ensure that employees have and use personal protective equipment when required for safety 
and health.
OSHA may act under the ‘general duty clause’ when four criteria are met:
•	 There must be a hazard
•	 The hazard must be a recognized hazard (e.g., the employer knew or should have known 
about the hazard, the hazard is obvious, or the hazard is a recognized one within the 
industry)
•	 The hazard could cause or is likely to cause serious harm or death and
•	 The hazard must be correctable (OSHA recognizes not all hazards are correctable).
This is theoretically a powerful tool against workplace hazards, but it is difficult to meet all four criteria. 
Therefore, OSHA has focused on basic mechanical and chemical hazards rather than procedures. Major 
areas which its standards currently cover are: toxic substances, harmful physical agents, electrical hazards, 
fall hazards, hazards associated with trenches and digging, hazardous waste, infectious disease, fire and 
explosion dangers, dangerous atmospheres, machine hazards, and confined spaces.
Employers must keep a record of every non-consumer chemical product used in the workplace. Detailed 
technical bulletins called material safety data sheets (MSDSs) must be posted and available for employees 
to read and use to avoid chemical hazards. OSHA also requires employers to report on every injury or 
job-related illness requiring medical treatment.

ISO 14000 Standards for Environmental Quality Management
The Organization de Standards International (ISO) sets standards for a wide range of products and 
management operations. They are internal standards (as opposed to government regulations) that guide 
a company to integrate environmental quality management systems within its business operations. The 
standards have no force of law. Compliance is voluntary.
The ISO 14000 family of standards pertains to how a product is produced, rather than to the product 
itself. The goal is to help companies (1) minimize operations that cause adverse changes to air, water, or 
land; (2) comply with applicable laws and regulations, and (3) continually improve pollution minimization 
and compliance.
Five areas are addressed in the ISO 14000 standard:
•	 Environmental Management Systems (EMS) comprises a written program; education and 
training; and knowledge of relevant local and federal environmental regulations.
•	 Environmental Performance Evaluations measure the impact a business is having on the 
environment by an inventory of air emissions and wastewater discharges.

Guidelines for Environmental Protection
•	 Environmental Auditing is a routine evaluation of a company’s environmental controls 
that defines the inputs (raw materials, energy) and outputs (waste streams, emissions), and 
identifies inefficiencies that have an environmental impact. Management is expected to 
implement changes as needed to reduce those impacts.
•	 Life Cycle Assessment evaluates the environmental consequences of a manufactured item 
from the time it is born (manufactured), during its life (use or operation), and death 
(disposal). The life cycle assessment usually covers the activities of suppliers, transporters, 
component manufacturers, and the final manufacturer, whereas the environmental audit 
covers just one company.
•	 Environmental Labeling allows an industry to identify environmentally friendly products.
The reasons for a company to seek ISO 14000 certification include greater efficiency and reduced 
operational costs, reduced environmental impacts, more favorable insurance rates, a competitive 
advantage with environmentally aware customers, and a positive image with its shareholders and 
customers. Third-party organizations, rather than ISO, award the certification.

Conclusion
Knowledge of environmental laws is essential in understanding which pollutants are critical targets for 
elimination by pollution prevention and which may be discharged because they are harmless or easy 
to treat.
The World Health Organization has expanded and refined its methods for evaluating conditions that may 
be dangerous to human health. It used a risk assessment approach for setting drinking water guidelines 
and air quality guidelines. It also collects extensive data on the state of world health, which is available 
in the World Health Report.
The European Union takes a leading role in international environmental policy. The member states have 
supported strict standards and enhanced their commitments to international environmental cooperation. 
The EU directives cover all aspects of environmental protection. Implementation is the responsibility 
of the member states.
A collection of U.S. Federal laws has developed to protect drinking water and to establish environmental 
limits on hundreds of specific chemicals and substances, including the priority pollutants in water and 
hazardous air pollutants. Enforcement of the laws has been delegated to the 50 states, which also handle 
the granting of permits. The laws are voluminous and complex and engineers frequently will consult 
with state environmental protection agencies about details.
Following an environmental ethic and making a noble effort toward environmental responsibility does 
not need to destroy profits. Many industries have voluntarily gone beyond the legal requirements, so it 
is clear that impressive results are not always explained by fear of fines and criminal prosecution.

Appendix 1
Notes on Water Quality Criteria:
1.	  MFL = million fibers per liter longer than 10 microns.
2.	 Action levels at the tap have been set instead of MCLs. Action levels are: Lead ≤ 0.015 mg/L 
and Copper ≤ 1.3 mg/L. Both must be met in at least 90% of samples.
3.	 Defined on basis of treatment technology.
4.	 Haloacetic acids: dichloroacetic acid (zero); trichloroacetic acid (0.02 mg/L); 
monochloroacetic acid (0.07 mg/L). Bromoacetic acid and dibromoacetic acid are regulated 
with this group but have no MCLGs.
5.	 Trihalomethanes: bromodichloromethane (zero); bromoform (zero); dibromochloromethane 
(0.06 mg/L); chloroform (0.07 mg/L)
6.	 For conventional or direct filtration, at no time can turbidity exceed 1 NTU, and samples 
for turbidity must be less than or equal to 0.3 NTUs in at least 95 percent of the samples in 
any month. Systems that use filtration other than the conventional or direct filtration must 
follow state limits, which must include turbidity at no time exceeding 5 NTUs.
7.	 Unfiltered systems are required to include Cryptosporidium in their existing watershed 
control provisions.
8.	 Minimum of 3 log removal (99.9%), MCLG = 0.
9.	 No more than 500 bacterial colonies per milliliter.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Life Criteria for Freshwater and 
Saltwater
The CWA sets aquatic life criteria for freshwater and saltwater which are given in Table A3.1. These 
national guidelines are intended to be protective of the vast majority of the aquatic communities in the 
United States.
The Criteria Maximum Concentration (CMC) applies to acute toxicity and the Criterion Continuous 
Concentration (CCC) applies to chronic toxicity. The CMC is an estimate of the highest concentration 
of a material in surface water to which an aquatic community can be exposed briefly without resulting 
in an adverse effect. The CCC is an estimate of the highest concentration of a material in surface water 
to which an aquatic community can be exposed indefinitely without resulting in an adverse effect.

Federal Law
All major industries and consulting companies employ some people whose responsibility includes being 
up to date on all relevant proposed, pending, and active rules. Current law must be known to secure 
compliance and avoid civil or criminal penalties, and to protect the discharger’s organization from 
unfavorable publicity. Proposed and pending regulations must be known in order to offer comments 
and advice that will influence the final regulation, and to be able to make orderly plans for compliance.

Figure A4.1 Relation of three branches of the U. S. government in making and enforcing environmental laws.
The process of creating a new law or regulation offers engineers, scientists, municipalities, and industries 
an opportunity to influence the scope and content of the law. In fact, the development process requires 
the solicitation of advice through written submissions and public hearings. All three branches of Federal 
Government – the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial – are active in environmental regulation. The 
relation of the three branches of government and the opportunity for public input are shown in Figure 
A4.1.
The Legislative branch enacts laws. The Executive branch – the President, the departments (Interior, 
Defense, etc.) and agencies within departments (e.g., Environmental Protection Agency) – develops the 
many details that are not specified by Congress by writing of rules and regulations. The Executive branch 
implements the laws, rules, and regulations.

Appendix 4
Courts are asked from time to time to decide whether a law is constitutional. They may also deal with 
questions such as: Is an agency developing rules in timely fashion? Do the developed rules follow 
Congressional intent? Is the rule being enforced according to the spirit and the intent of the law?
A proposed law is called a Bill. Bills may originate in either the House of Representatives or in the 
Senate. Bills originating in the Senate have an identifying number beginning with S. Bills originating 
in the House of Representatives are identified with HR. As an example, the Resource Conservation and 
Recovery Act (RCRA) began as bill HR 14496. It was passed to become Public Law 94-580 (PL 94-580). 
RCRA was later amended by HR 2867 and became PL 98-616.
A law can create a new agency or give an agency a new mission. Typically, several in-house versions of 
proposed rules are developed. When the agency director, the Office of Management and Budget, and 
U.S. President agree on a version, the rule is published for state agency officials to review and comment. 
Revisions are made based on comments received and the agency announces an advance notice of proposed 
rule making (ANPRM) and requests public input. This is the opportunity for the public and industry to 
question, comment, and advise. Then there are hearings and a proposed rule is put out for more public 
comment. After more hearings, the Final Rule will be published with background, and later, the Final 
Rule will be published with text only.
The Federal Register (FR) is published every business day. It covers only the Executive Branch. It contains 
in this order: Presidential Orders, [Final] rules and regulations, Proposed rules, Notices, and Special 
parts. All contents have background information. To use the Federal Register you need to know the 
annual volume number and the page number. For example, volume 50, page 614 is cited as 50 FR 614 
(January 4, 1985). Giving the date of publication is optional.
The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is published annually. It contains the Final rules and regulations. 
The CFR is divided into approximately 50 Titles that group similar topics and/or agencies. The hierarchical 
arrangement in a title is: Title, Subtitle, Chapter, and maybe even more specific subdivisions. The 
Environmental Protection Agency is in 40 CFR Parts 1–799, which is 799 parts in 9 volumes. The 
Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) is in 29 CFR 1910, which is one volume that has one part 
and many sections and subsections.

Appendix 5
16	 Appendix 5 – Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act 
(RCRA)
The Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) of 1965 was amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act (RCRA) in 1976 and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA). These three 
acts, collectively known as RCRA, regulate hazardous wastes ‘from the cradle to the grave’. They affect 
hazardous waste generators, transporters, and treatment and disposal facilities and apply to wastes that 
were disposed of after November 19, 1980.
The law imposes a “cradle to grave” obligation on waste generators. Any person or company (including 
transporters or previous waste disposal facility owners) that ever had contact with any waste now located 
at a problem site is liable to be held as a responsible party. Waste generators who may have contracted in 
good faith with a disposal firm many years ago, can find themselves held responsible for unacceptable 
consequences. This legal principle, along with the principle of “joint and several” liability, holds all parties 
equally responsible for hazardous waste cleanup. This means that waste generators, transporters, and 
operators of treatment, storage and disposal facilities are forced to consider the long-term risks associated 
with disposal as well as the short-term costs.

Appendix 5
RCRA requires all generators of hazardous wastes to apply for a permit prior to disposing of the waste. 
Generators can be classified as Large Quantity Generators, Small Quantity Generators, and Very Small 
Quantity Generators depending on the amount of waste that they produce. Generators can have Part A 
or Part B permits. Under Part A, a generator can store waste onsite for no more than 90 days and must 
contract with a licensed transporter. Part B permits allow generators to store waste for longer than 90 
days and require them to have specially designed collection areas that have secondary containment. 
Most large industries operate under Part B.
The only exception is for household generators (motor oil, pesticides, etc.) who bring wastes to municipal 
collection sites. The municipality is allowed to contract with a company that holds a permit to take 
responsibility for the household hazardous wastes.
If an operating disposal facility is found to be out of compliance or has a release of hazardous materials 
to the air, ground water, surface water, or land, the facility must undertake RCRA Corrective Actions 
in order to continue operating. If the facility is no longer operating and releases to the environment are 
discovered, the facility will be regulated under CERCLA and must undertake cleanup.
RCRA, despite its name, does not require resource conservation and recovery, but it does encourage 
these practices by imposing design and operating standards for proper management of hazardous wastes 
today so as to prevent future problems. And, it regulates the handling of materials that are to be recycled 
if they are classified as solid wastes.
Many recycling practices cause materials to be regulated under RCRA. The actual recycling process is 
unregulated (except waste burned as fuel), but generation, transportation, and storage prior to recycling 
are regulated if the waste is a solid waste. In most cases, waste generated from treatment and storage of 
a hazardous waste remains a hazardous waste. Determining whether a material is a RCRA solid waste 
is fairly straightforward unless it is to be recycled.
If the intent is to recycle a waste, it must be known what the waste is and how it is to be recycled in 
order to decide whether it is a solid waste according to RCRA.
RCRA does not specifically disallow any type of treatment or disposal technology but it does impose 
significant requirements (e.g. groundwater monitoring, leachate collection and treatment, and double 
liner construction) on land-based management methods (e.g. landfarming, ponds, and landfills), making 
these alternatives less attractive financially than in the past. As an example, the ban on disposing of 
liquids in landfills forces one to treat liquids that in the past could have been buried directly.
The important first step is to determine whether a waste is a RCRA hazardous waste. Hazardous waste 
is a subset of solid waste. For the material to be a hazardous waste it must first be a solid waste.

Appendix 5
Under RCRA, solid waste is a regulatory term that does not refer to a material’s physical state. This 
makes it possible, under certain conditions, for industrial wastewater to be classified as a solid hazardous 
waste. A solid waste is any discarded material that is not excluded by 40 CFR 261.4(a) or that has not 
been delisted. Delisting is the process by which a generator petitions on a case-by-case basis to have a 
hazardous waste reclassified as a nonhazardous waste.
A discarded material is any material that is (1) disposed, stored, or treated before its disposal; (2) burned 
as a fuel, treated, recycled, abandoned, considered inherently waste-like; or (3) stored or accumulated 
before recycling. If the material does not fit this definition it is not a RCRA hazardous waste, but it may 
still be regulated under others laws. The most important exclusion is sludge from municipal wastewater 
treatment plants.
These materials are excluded from the statutory definition of solid waste:
1)	 Domestic sewage, which is regulated under the Clean Water Act.
2)	 Any mixture of domestic sewage and any other waste that passes through a sewer system 
to a publicly owned treatment works. Under RCRA, one may legally dispose of a hazardous 
waste into a POTW system, but POTWs are subject to pretreatment standards under the 
Clean Water Act and they have local jurisdiction to legally prohibit discharges that may 
interfere with their system or that may cause them to violate their NPDES permit.
3)	 Industrial wastewater discharges that are point source discharges are subject to the Clean 
Water Act. This does not exclude wastewaters while they are being collected, stored, or 
treated prior to discharge, nor does it exclude sludges that are generated by industrial 
wastewater treatment.
4)	 Pulping liquors used in the production of paper in the Kraft process.
5)	 Spent sulfuric acid used to produce virgin sulfuric acid.
6)	 Secondary materials that are reclaimed and returned to the original process in which they 
were generated, provided that only tank storage is used, the material is not burned, the 
material is not used to produce a fuel, and the material is not accumulated for more than 12 
months prior to reclamation.
Materials that are classified as solid wastes, but excluded from the definition of hazardous wastes:
1)	 All household wastes and resource recovery facilities that burn only household wastes.
2)	 Manure and crops returned to the soil as fertilizers.
3)	 Fly ash, bottom ash waste, slag waste, a flue gas emission control waste generated primarily 
from the combustion of coal and other fossil fuels.
4)	 Drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, 
development, or production of crude oil, natural gas, or geothermal energy.

5)	 Waste containing primarily trivalent chromium and specified wastes from the tannery 
industry.
6)	 Specified solid wastes from the extraction and beneficiation or ores and minerals.
7)	 Cement kiln dust.
A solid waste may be classified as hazardous because it is a listed hazardous waste or because it has 
characteristics that make it hazardous. The characteristics that make a waste hazardous, separate from 
the listed hazardous wastes, are ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity. These characteristics are 
measured using standard available testing protocols. The responsibility for making these determinations 
falls on the waste generator.
One of the most significant concerns arising from hazardous wastes is the leaching of toxic components 
into groundwater. Because of this, the toxicity characteristic (TC) is measured using the Toxicity 
Characteristics Leaching Procedure test (TCLP). The waste is classified as a TC hazardous waste if 
the concentration of any contaminant in the leachate extracted from the TCLP exceeds the toxicity 
characteristic limits given in Table A5.1.

Appendix 6
17	 Appendix 6 – Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act 
(CERCLA)
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) is also known 
as Superfund. Superfund was enacted to correct past mistakes in hazardous waste management by giving 
the EPA authority that did not exist under RCRA. It is designed to provide mechanisms for investigation, 
assessment, and remediation of abandoned or uncontrolled sites, or areas that have environmental 
contamination that were not operating under a RCRA permit. An example is contamination detected at 
large federal facilities, such as military or Department of Energy facilities. Some well-known Superfund 
sites include Love Canal in Niagara Falls, NY and the Savannah River DOE site in South Carolina.
The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) provided $8.5 billion over the next 
five years for Superfund response activities and $500 million for Underground Tank program activities. 
It includes provision for citizens’ suits against anyone who violates any standard, regulation, condition, 
requirement, or order under the Act.
There is no clear line to distinguish when Superfund or RCRA applies because many provisions of the 
statutes overlap. In general, RCRA applies if an operating facility intends to continue its operations, or if 
the original owner intends to work with EPA under its permit and perform corrective action. CERCLA 
applies if the facility is not currently operating, if contamination from a past operation is detected at an 
operating facility, or if contamination is found in the environment and there is no Responsible Party 
willing or financially able to undertake cleanup. RCRA Corrective Actions often require a facility to 
follow CERCLA guidance.
A Responsible Party is defined in RCRA as any person or company, including transporters or previous 
waste disposal facility owners, that ever had contact with any waste now located at a problem site and 
has liability for problems arising from the past waster management practice. Under Superfund, hazardous 
substances are governed under strict liability. In tort law, strict liability is liability without fault. Therefore, 
one who engages in an activity that has an inherent risk of injury is liable for all injuries proximately 
caused by those activities, even without showing negligence. This means that anyone who handles 
hazardous wastes is liable for all resulting injuries regardless of how much care has been exercised. This 
principle also holds under RCRA.

Appendix 6
 Most Superfund actions are undertaken in cooperation with State environmental agencies, but Superfund 
activities conducted completely on a site, and not on any surrounding property, do not require federal, 
state, or local permits, but must comply with any applicable regulations. RCRA, in contrast, specifies 
cleanup levels and cleanup technology, regardless of cost-effectiveness, and in addition the site must 
obtain the appropriate permits.
Reporting spills of hazardous wastes is required under CERCLA, the Hazardous Materials Transportation 
Act, and the Clean Water Act. Under CERCLA, hazardous substances are simply a compilation of 
substances regulated under other federal statutes (CAA, RCRA, CWA, TSCA). The reporting requirement 
is triggered when the amount spilled reaches the reportable quantity (RQ), which may be 1, 10, 100, 1000 
or 5000 lb, depending on the intrinsic physical, chemical, and toxicological properties of the substance.
Hazardous waste sites are rated with respect to the substances involved, their tendency to migrate from 
the site, their toxicity, and other factors related to environmental health and safety. A site that scores 
high enough is placed on the National Priorities List (NPL). Sites on this list are considered to pose 
the most significant threat to human health or the environment. This does not mean that the site is an 
immediate threat to public health, but listing means that a site is considered to represent some significant, 
long-term threat to public health.

Appendix 6
Investigation, assessment, and remediation activities under CERCLA are financed in one of three ways.
•	 A Responsible Party may agree to undertake all activities, hire its own consultants, and pay 
all expenses. In this case, EPA would monitor activities.
•	 A Responsible Party accepts a settlement agreement with EPA and contributes money for 
current and foreseeable future activities. EPA puts this money into a Superfund Special 
Account and manages the account and the cleanup activities.
•	 If there is no Responsible Party or if the Responsible party is financially unwilling or unable 
to undertake activities, EPA makes use of the Superfund Trust Fund, which is appropriated 
by Congress.
Prior to 2003, the Trust Fund was funded by a value-added tax on chemicals, but the tax was not re-
appropriated. The Fund cannot be used for actions at Federal facilities; cleanup of these facilities must 
be funded out of each agency’s operating funds.
State-regulated sites do not have access to the Superfund Trust Fund, but many states have similar 
programs for managing abandoned or underfunded sites.
The National Oil and Hazardous Substance Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) contains the regulations 
for implementing both CERCLA and the Oil Pollution Act. The NCP provides the blueprint for responding 
to both oil spills and hazardous substances releases.
The NCP requires that a remedial investigation (RI) and feasibility study (FS) be conducted for each site 
on the NPL that is targeted for remedial action. This is the mechanism established to characterize the risks 
posed by the uncontrolled waste site and the site-specific potential remedial options. Risk assessment is 
an important part of this process and it is done on each alternative remedial action, including the ‘No 
Action’ option.
After selection of the preferred alternative, the proposed plan is issued, and following a public comment 
period, the selected alternative is documented in the record of decision (ROD). The ROD is the final 
remedial action plan. It serves the legal function of certifying that the remedy was selected according 
to the requirements of Superfund and the NCP. It is also the technical document that outlines the 
engineering components and remediation goals. It provides a public history of the site, the RI/FS, the 
risks posed by conditions at the site, the alternative cleanup methods considered, and the rationale 
behind the remedy selected.

Appendix 6
The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) required EPA to involve the 
states in hazardous waste identification and cleanup activities. Most uncontrolled hazardous waste sites 
are not regulated directly by EPA but through state programs. As of 2010, all 50 states, the District of 
Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico had programs comparable to Superfund for managing 
sites within their jurisdictions.
As of May 2013, 1,320 uncontrolled hazardous waste sites are listed on the NPL (Federal Register, May 
23, 2013). More sites are regulated under state regulations than directly under EPA. For example, there 
are 2,354 sites on the New York list. Many of these are gasoline stations with leaking underground storage 
tanks and minor spills and releases, but some include major sites that have not been added to the NPL.
