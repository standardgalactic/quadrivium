Introduction
This volume grew from a discussion by the editors on the diﬃculty of ﬁnding
good thesis problems for graduate students in topology. Although at any given
time we each had our own favorite problems, we acknowledged the need to
oﬀer students a wider selection from which to choose a topic peculiar to their
interests. One of us remarked, “Wouldn’t it be nice to have a book of current
unsolved problems always available to pull down from the shelf?” The other
replied, “Why don’t we simply produce such a book?”
Two years later and not so simply, here is the resulting volume. The intent
is to provide not only a source book for thesis-level problems but also a chal-
lenge to the best researchers in the ﬁeld. Of course, the presented problems
still reﬂect to some extent our own prejudices. However, as editors we have
tried to represent as broad a perspective of topological research as possible.
The topics range over algebraic topology, analytic set theory, continua theory,
digital topology, dimension theory, domain theory, function spaces, gener-
alized metric spaces, geometric topology, homogeneity, inﬁnite-dimensional
topology, knot theory, ordered spaces, set-theoretic topology, topological dy-
namics, and topological groups. Application areas include computer science,
diﬀerential systems, functional analysis, and set theory.
The authors are
among the world leaders in their respective research areas.
A key component in our speciﬁcation for the volume was to provide current
problems. Problems become quickly outdated, and any list soon loses its value
if the status of the individual problems is uncertain. We have addressed this
issue by arranging a running update on such status in each volume of the
journal TOPOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS. This will be useful only if
the reader takes the trouble of informing one of the editors about solutions
of problems posed in this book. Of course, it will also be suﬃcient to inform
the author(s) of the paper in which the solved problem is stated.
We plan a complete revision to the volume with the addition of new topics
and authors within ﬁve years.
To keep bookkeeping simple, each problem has two diﬀerent labels. First,
the label that was originally assigned to it by the author of the paper in which
it is listed. The second label, the one in the outer margin, is a global one and
is added by the editors; its main purpose is to draw the reader’s attention to
the problems.
A word on the indexes: there are two of them. The ﬁrst index contains
terms that are mentioned outside the problems, one may consult this index
to ﬁnd information on a particular subject. The second index contains terms
that are mentioned in the problems, one may consult this index to locate
problems concerning ones favorite subject.
Although there is considerable
overlap between the indexes, we think this is the best service we can oﬀer the
reader.

Introduction
The editors would like to note that the volume has already been a suc-
cess in the fact that its preparation has inspired the solution to several long-
outstanding problems by the authors.
We now look forward to reporting
solutions by the readers. Good luck!
Finally, the editors would like to thank Klaas Pieter Hart for his valu-
able advice on TEX and METAFONT. They also express their gratitude to
Eva Coplakova for composing the indexes, and to Eva Coplakova and Geertje
van Mill for typing the manuscript.

There are many set-theoretic topologists and set theorists in the Munici-
pality of Metropolitan Toronto. We have had a seminar for 15 years or so and
most of the regular participants have been there for around a decade. Thus
the Editors thought it useful for us to compile a list of problems that interest
us. This we have done in separate chapters arranged alphabetically by author
below.

Question 1. Is there a ccc non-pseudocompact space which has no remote 1. ?
points?
This is probably the problem that I would most like to see answered. A
remote point is a point of βX −X which is not in the closure of any nowhere
dense subset of X. However there is a very appealing combinatorial trans-
lation of this in the case X is, for example, a topological sum of countably
many compact spaces. It is consistent that there is a separable space with
no remote points (Dow [1989]). If there is no such example then it is likely
the case that V = L will imply that all such spaces do have remote points. I
believe that CH implies this for spaces of weight less than ℵω (Dow [1988b]).
Other references: for negative answers see van Douwen [1981], Dow [1983e],
and Dow and Peters [1987] and for positive answers see Dow [1982, 1989].
Question 2. Find necessary and suﬃcient conditions on a compact space X 2. ?
so that ω × X has remote points.
Of course there may not be a reasonable answer to this question in ZFC, but
it may be possible to obtain a nice characterization under such assumptions as
CH or PFA. For example, I would conjecture that there is a model satisfying
that if X is compact and ω ×X has remote points then X has an open subset
with countable cellularity. See Dow [1983d, 1987, 1988b].
Question 3. Is there, for every compact space X, a cardinal κ such that 3. ?
κ × X has remote points (where κ is given the discrete topology)?
It is shown in Dow and Peters [1988] that this is true if there are arbi-
trarily large cardinals κ such that 2κ = κ+.
Question 4.
If X is a non-pseudocompact space does there exist a point 4. ?
p ∈βX which is not the limit of any countable discrete nowhere dense set?
It is shown in van Mill [1982] that the above follows from MA. It is known
that MA can be weakened to b = c. However, if this is a theorem of ZFC it is
likely the case that a new idea is needed. The main diﬃculty is in producing
a point of βX −X which is not the limit of any countable discrete subset of
X (an ω-far point in van Douwen [1981]). The ideas in Dow [1982, 1989]
may be useful in obtaining a negative answer.
Question 5. Does U(ω1) have weak Pω2-points?
5. ?
A weak Pω2-point is a point which is not the limit of any set of cardinality
at most ω1. This question is the subject of Dow [1985]; it is known that
U(ω3) has weak Pω2-points.

[ch. 1
Question 6. Does every Parovichenko space have a c×c-independent matrix?
? 6.
This is a technical question which probably has no applications but I ﬁnd
it interesting.
A Parovichenko space is a compact F-space of weight c in
which every non-empty Gδ has inﬁnite interior. The construction of a c × c-
independent matrix on P(ω) uses heavily the fact that ω is strongly inacces-
sible, see Kunen [1978]. In Dow [1985] it is shown that each Parovichenko
space has a c × ω1-independent matrix and this topic is also discussed in
Dow [1984b, 1984a].
Question 7. Is cf(c) = ω1 equivalent to the statement that all Parovichenko
? 7.
spaces are co-absolute?
It is shown in Dow [1983b] that the left to right implication holds.
Question 8.
Is there a clopen subset of the subuniform ultraﬁlters of ω1
? 8.
whose closure in βω1 is its one-point compactiﬁcation?
This is a desperate attempt to mention the notion and study of coherent se-
quences (Dow [1988c] and Todorˇcevi´c [1989]). These may be instrumental
in proving that ω∗is not homeomorphic to ω∗
1.
Question 9. What are the subspaces of the extremally disconnected spaces?
? 9.
More speciﬁcally, does every compact basically disconnected space embed into
an extremally disconnected space?
E. K. van Douwen and J. van Mill [1980] have shown that it is consis-
tent that not every compact zero-dimensional F-space embeds and it is shown
in Dow and van Mill [1982] that all P-spaces and their Stone-ˇCech com-
pactiﬁcations do. It is independent of ZFC whether or not open subspaces of
βN\N are necessarily F-spaces (Dow [1983a]). There are other F-spaces with
open subspaces which are not F-spaces. The references Dow [1982, 1983c]
are relevant.
Question 10. Find a characterization for when the product of a P-space and
? 10.
an F-space is again an F-space.
A new necessary condition was found in Dow [1983c] and this had several
easy applications. See also Comfort, Hindman and Negrepontis [1969]
for most of what is known.
Question 11.
Is the space of minimal prime ideals of C(βN \ N) basically
? 11.
disconnected?

ch. 1]
Dow / Dow’s Questions
9
This problem is solved consistently in Dow, Henriksen, Kopperman and
Vermeer [1988]. This problem sounds worse than it is. Enlarge the topology
of βN \ N by declaring the closures of all cozero sets open. Now ask if this
space is basically disconnected. If there are no large cardinals then it is not
(Dow [1990]).
Question 12. Consider the ideal of nowhere dense subsets of the rationals. 12. ?
Can this ideal be extended to a P-ideal in P(Q)/fin ?
This strikes me as a curiousity. A positive answer solves question 11.
Question 13.
Is every compact space of weight ω1 homeomorphic to the 13. ?
remainder of a ψ-space?
A ψ-space is the usual kind of space obtained by taking a maximal almost
disjoint family of subsets of ω and its remainder means with respect to its
Stone-ˇCech compactiﬁcation. Nyikos shows that the space 2ω1 can be real-
ized as such a remainder and the answer is yes under CH (this is shown in
Baumgartner and Weese [1982]). This qualiﬁes as an interesting question
by virtue of the fact that it is an easily stated question (in ZFC) about βN.
Question 14. Is there a compact ccc space of weight c whose density is not 14. ?
less than c?
This is due to A. Blaszcyk. Todorˇcevi´c showed that a yes answer follows
from the assumption that c is regular. A reasonable place to look for a consis-
tent no answer is the oft-called Bell-Kunen model (Bell and Kunen [1981]);
I had conjectured that all compact ccc spaces of weight at most c would have
density ω1 in this model but Merrill [1986] shows this is not so. Todorˇcevi´c
is studying the consequences of the statement Σℵ1: “every ccc poset of size
at most c is ℵ1-centered”.
Question 15. Is it consistent that countably compact subsets of countably 15. ?
tight spaces are always closed? Does it follow from PFA?
This question is of course very similar to the Moore-Mrowka problem (Ba-
logh [1989]) and has been asked by Fleissner and Levy.
Question 16. Does countable closed tightness imply countable tightness in 16. ?
compact spaces.
This is due to Shapirovski˘ı, I believe. Countable closed tightness means
that if x ∈A −{x} then there should be a countable subset B ⊂A such that
x ∈B −{x}.

Question 17. Is every compact sequential space of character (or cardinality)
? 17.
ω1 hereditarily α-realcompact?
This question is posed in Dow [1988a]. Nyikos deﬁnes a space to be α-
realcompact if every countably complete ultraﬁlter of closed sets is ﬁxed.

1. The Toronto Problem
What has come to be known as the Toronto problem asks whether it is possible
to have an uncountable, non-discrete, Hausdorﬀspace which is homeomorphic
to each of its uncountable subspaces. In order to convince the reader of the
necessity of the various hypotheses in the question, deﬁne a Toronto space to
be any space X, which is homeomorphic to all of its subspaces of the same
cardinality as X. Hence the Toronto problem asks:
Question 1.1.
Are all Hausdorﬀ, Toronto spaces of size ℵ1 discrete?
18. ?
First note that the discrete space of size ℵ1 is a Toronto space and that,
furthermore, so are the coﬁnite and cocountable topologies on ω1; hence the
requirement that the space be Hausdorﬀis a natural one. Moreover, it is easy
to see that any inﬁnite Hausdorﬀspace contains an inﬁnite discrete subspace
and hence, any countable, HausdorﬀToronto space must be discrete. This is
why the question is posed only for uncountable spaces.
Not much is known about the Toronto problem but the folklore does contain
a few facts. First, any Hausdorﬀ, Toronto space is scattered and the number
of isolated points in any non-discrete, Hausdorﬀ, Toronto space is countable.
Consequently such a space must have derived length ω1 and be hereditarily
separable and, hence, must be an S-space. An even easier way to obtain a
model where the answer to Question 1.1 is positive is to notice that this follows
from the inequality 2ℵ0 ̸= 2ℵ1. The reason is that hereditary separability
implies that a space has only 2ℵ0 autohomeomorphisms while any Toronto
space of size λ must have 2λ autohomeomorphisms.
While it has already been mentioned that the Toronto problem is easily
answered for countable spaces, there is a version of the problem which remains
open and which might have some signiﬁcance for the original question. For
any ordinal α deﬁne an α-Toronto space to be a scattered space of derived
length α which is homeomorphic to each subspace of derived length α.
Question 1.2.
Is there an ω-Toronto space?
19. ?
Not even consistency results are known about this question and in fact
answers are not available even if ω is replaced by any α ≥2. For successor
ordinals the question must be posed carefully though and it is more convenient
to use the language of ﬁlters.
1.1. Definition. If F is a ﬁlter on X and G a ﬁlter on Y then F and G are
isomorphic if there is a bijection, ψ, from X to Y such that A ∈F if and only
if ψ(A) ∈G.
1.2. Definition. If F is a ﬁlter on X then F2 is the ﬁlter on X × X deﬁned
by A ∈F2 if and only if {a ∈X; {b ∈X; (a, b) ∈A} ∈F} ∈F and F|A is
the ﬁlter on X \ A deﬁned by B ∈F|A if and only if B ∪A ∈F.

Steprans / Steprans’ Problems
[ch. 2
1.3. Definition. A ﬁlter F on ω is idempotent if F is isomorphic to F2 and
it is homogeneous if F is isomorphic to F|X for each X ̸∈F.
By assuming that X is a counterexample to Question 1.1 and considering
only the ﬁrst two levels it can be shown that there is an idempotent homoge-
neous ﬁlter on ω.
Question 1.3.
Is there an idempotent, homogeneous ﬁlter on ω?
? 20.
As in the case of Question 1.2, not even a consistent solution to Question 1.3
is known. In fact only one example of an idempotent ﬁlter on ω is known and
it is not known whether this is homogeneous. Finally it should be mentioned
that the questions concerning Toronto spaces of larger cardinalities and with
stronger separation axioms also remain open.
Question 1.4. Is there some non-discrete, Hausdorﬀ, Toronto space?
? 21.
Question 1.5. Are all regular (or normal) Toronto spaces of size ℵ1 discrete?
? 22.
2. Continuous colourings of closed graphs
Some attention has recently been focused on the question of obtaining analogs
of ﬁnite combinatorial results, such as Ramsey or van der Waerden theorems,
in topology. The question of graph colouring can be considered in the same
spirit.
Recall that a (directed) graph G on a set X is simply a subset of
X2. If Y is a set then a Y -colouring of G is a function χ: X →Y such that
(χ−1(i) × χ−1(i)) ∩G = ∅for each i ∈Y . By a graph on a topological space
will be meant a closed subspace of the product space X2. If Y is a topological
space then a topological Y -colouring of a graph G on the topological space
X is a continuous function χ: X →Y such that χ is a colouring of G when
considered as an ordinary graph.
2.1. Definition. If X, Y and Z are topological spaces then deﬁne Y ≤X Z
if and only if for every graph G on X, if G has a topological Y -colouring then
it has a topological Z-colouring.
Even for very simple examples of Y and Z the relation Y ≤X Z provides
unsolved questions. Let D(k) be the k-point discrete space and I(k) the k-
point indiscrete space. The relation I(k) ≤X D(n) says that every graph on X
which can be coloured with k colours can be coloured with clopen sets and n
colours. It is shown in Krawczyk and Stepr¯ans [19∞] that if X is compact
and 0-dimensional and I(2) ≤X D(k) holds for any k ∈ω then X must be
scattered. Moreover, I(k) ≤ω+1 D(k) is true for each k and I(2) ≤X D(3) if
X is a compact scattered space whose third derived set is empty. This is the
reason for the following question.

§3] Autohomeomorphisms of the ˇCech-Stone Compactiﬁcation on the Integers
17
Question 2.1.
If X is compact and scattered does I(2) ≤X D(3) hold?
23. ?
Question 2.2. If the answer to Question 2.1 is negative then what is the least 24. ?
ordinal for which there is a compact scattered space of that ordinal height,
X, such that I(2) ≤X D(3) fails?
Question 2.3. More generally, what is the least ordinal for which there is a 25. ?
compact scattered space of that ordinal height, X, such that I(n) ≤X D(m)
fails?
The preceding discussion has been about zero-dimensional spaces but the
notation Y ≤X Z was introduced in order to pose questions about other
spaces as well. Let A(2) be the Alexandrov two point space with precisely
one isolated point.
Question 2.4. Does I(2) ≤R A(2) hold? What about I(2) ≤I A(2) where I 26. ?
is the unit interval?
Question 2.5.
Characterize the triples of spaces X, Y and Z such that 27. ?
X ≤Z Y holds.
3. Autohomeomorphisms of the ˇCech-Stone Compactiﬁcation on
the Integers
The autohomeomorphism group of βN\N, which will be denoted by A , is the
subject of countless unsolved questions so this section will not even attempt
to be comprehensive but, instead will concentrate on a particular category of
problems. W. Rudin [1956] was the ﬁrst to construct autohomeomorphisms
of βN \ N which were non-trivial in the sense that they were not simply
induced by a permutation of the integers. It was then shown by Shelah that
it is consistent that every autohomeomorphism of βN \ N is induced by an
almost permutation—that is a one-to-one function whose domain and range
are both coﬁnite. This was later shown to follow from PFA by Shelah and
Stepr¯ans in [1988] while Veliˇckovi´c has shown that this does not follow from
MA.
Let T denote the subgroup of A consisting of the trivial autohomeomor-
phisms—in other words, those which are induced by almost permutations of
the integers. In every model known, the number of cosets of T in A is either
1 or 22ℵ0 .
Question 3.1. Is it consistent that the number of cosets of T in A is strictly 28. ?
between 1 and 22ℵ0 ?

18
Steprans / Steprans’ Problems
[ch. 2
In his proof that T = A Shelah introduced the ideal of sets on which an
autohomeomorphism is trivial.
3.1. Definition.
If Φ ∈A deﬁne J (Φ) = { X ⊂ω : (∃f: X →ω) f is
one-to-one and Φ|P(X) is induced by f }
Hence Φ is trivial precisely if J (Φ) is improper—that is, contains ω. It
was shown in Shelah’s argument that, under certain circumstances, if J (Φ)
is merely suﬃciently large then Φ is trivial. This is of course not true in gen-
eral because if there is a P-point of character ℵ1 then there is an autohomeo-
morphism of βN \ N which is trivial on precisely this P-point. It might be
tempting to conjecture however, that if J (Φ) is either, improper or a prime
ideal for every autohomeomorphism Φ, then this implies that all such auto-
homeomorphisms are trivial. This is true but only for the reason that the
hypothesis is far too strong—after all if Φi: P(Ai) →P(Ai) is an autohome-
omorphism for i ∈k and the sets Ai are pairwise disjoint, then it is easy to
see how to deﬁne
⊕{Φi; i ∈k}: ∪{P(Ai); i ∈k} →∪{P(Ai); i ∈k}
in such a way that J (⊕{Φi; i ∈k}) = ⊕{J (Φi); i ∈k} Notice that this implies
that {J (Φ); Φ ∈A} is closed under ﬁnite direct sums; but not much else is
known. In particular, it is not known what restrictions on {J (Φ); Φ ∈A}
imply that every member of A is trivial.
Question 3.2.
Suppose that for every Φ, J (Φ) is either improper or the
? 29.
direct sum of prime ideals.
Does this imply that every automorphism is
trivial?
Even the much weaker hypothesis has not yet been ruled out.
Question 3.3. If J (Φ) ̸= ∅for each Φ ∈A does this imply that each Φ ∈A
? 30.
is trivial?
Rudin’s proof of the existence of non-trivial autohomeomorphisms shows
even more than has been stated. He showed in fact that, assuming CH, for
any two P-points there is an autohomeomorphism of βN \ N which takes one
to the other.
3.2. Definition. RH(κ) is deﬁned to be the statement that, given two sets
of P-points, A and B, both of size κ, there is Φ ∈A such that Φ(A) = Φ(B).
Deﬁne RT (κ) to mean that, given two sequences of P-points of length κ, a
and b, there is Φ ∈A such that Φ(a(α)) = Φ(b(α)) for each α ∈κ.
In this notation, Rudin’s result says that CH implies that RT (1) holds. It is
easy to see that, in general, RT (1) implies RT (n) for each integer n. Observe

§3] Autohomeomorphisms of the ˇCech-Stone Compactiﬁcation on the Integers
19
also, that RT (κ) implies RH(κ) and κ ≤λ and RT (λ) implies RT (κ). However
the answers to the following questions are not known.
Question 3.4.
If RH(κ) holds and λ ≤κ must it be true that RH(λ) also 31. ?
holds?
Question 3.5.
Does RT (1) imply RT (ω)?
32. ?
Question 3.6. Does RH(κ) imply RT (κ)?
33. ?
It should be observed that RT (1) is quite a rare property since an easy way
to get it to fail is to have a Pκ-point and a Pλ-point which is not a Pκ-point
and both κ and λ are uncountable. Indeed, the only models known to satisfy
even RT (1) are:
• models of CH (Rudin [1956]),
• models obtained by adding ℵ2 Cohen reals to a model of CH (Stepr¯ans
[1987]),
• models where there are no P-points (Shelah [1982]), and
• models where every P-point has character ℵ1 (Blass [1989]).
Hence the ﬁrst question which should be answered is the following.
Question 3.7.
Is RT (ω1) false?
34. ?
In order to make the property a bit easier to satisfy, the following deﬁnitions
can be formulated.
3.3. Definition. An exact-Pκ-point is a Pκ-point which is not a Pλ-point
for any λ such that κ < λ.
3.4. Definition. Deﬁne Rλ
H(κ) to be the statement that, given two sets of
exact-Pλ-points, A and B, both of size κ, there is Φ ∈A such that Φ(A) =
Φ(B). Deﬁne Rλ
T (κ) to mean that, given two sequences of exact-Pλ-points of
length κ, a and b, there is Φ ∈A such that Φ(a(α)) = Φ(b(α)) for each α ∈κ.
The Questions 3.4 to 3.7 can all be asked in this context as well.
The main reason for asking the questions in this section has been to provoke
some thought on how to construct autohomeomorphisms of βN \ N. At the
moment, all non-trivial such constructions fall into two categories: Inductive
constructions and approximations by trivial autohomeomorphisms along a
prime ideal. The ﬁnal question might be considered as a proposal for a new
way of constructing autohomeomorphisms of βN \ N. Notice that if it has a
positive answer then so does Question 3.5.

Steprans / Steprans’ Problems
[ch. 2
Question 3.8. If Φi: P(Ai) →P(Ai) is an autohomeomorphism for i ∈ω 35. ?
and the sets Ai are pairwise disjoint, is there Φ ∈A such that Φ|P(Ai) = Φi
for each i ∈ω?

Here are some problems that interest me. Most I have worked on; some I
have not. I have in general avoided listing well-known problems that I am
not particularly associated with, since they surely will be covered elsewhere
in this volume.
A. Normal Moore Space Problems
Tall [1984, 1979] and Fleissner [1984] are good references for normal Moore
spaces.
Question A1. Is it consistent with 2ℵ0 = ℵ2 that every normal Moore space 36. ?
is metrizable?
It is known to be consistent with 2ℵ0 being weakly inaccessible (Nyikos
[1982], Dow, Tall and Weiss [19∞b]). If—as once conjectured by Steve
Watson—2ℵ0 not weakly inacessible implies the existence of a normal non-
metrizable Moore space, there would be a simple proof of the necessity of
large cardinals to prove the consistency of the Normal Moore Space Conjec-
ture. The game plan would be to work with Fleissner’s CH example of a
normal non-metrizable Moore space (Fleissner [1982]) and weaken the hy-
pothesis. However, Fleissner and I conjecture the other way—namely that the
Conjecture is consistent with 2ℵ0 = ℵ2. In particular I conjecture that the
Conjecture holds in the model obtained by Mitchell-collapsing a supercompact
cardinal. (For Mitchell collapse, see Mitchell [1972] and Abraham [1983].)
There are enough Cohen reals in this model so that normal Moore spaces
of cardinality ℵ1 are metrizable (Dow, Tall and Weiss [19∞b]), so this
conjecture is a “reﬂection problem”—see below.
Question A2.
Is it consistent with GCH that normal Moore spaces are 37. ?
para-Lindel¨of?
A space is para-Lindel¨of if every open cover has a locally countable open
reﬁnement. This is an attempt to get as much of the Normal Moore Space
Conjecture as possible consistent with GCH. It is done for spaces of car-
dinality ≤ℵ1 in Tall [1988]. Any consistency proof would likely establish
the consistency with GCH of every ﬁrst countable countably paracompact
submetacompact space being para-Lindel¨of. Again, this is done for spaces
of cardinality ≤ℵ1 in Tall [1988]; indeed, ﬁrst countability is weakened
to character ≤ℵ1. It’s consistent with GCH that there’s a normal Moore
space that’s not collectionwise Hausdorﬀ, hence not para-Lindel¨of (Devlin
and Shelah [1979]).
Question A3. Does the existence of a normal non-metrizable Moore space 38. ?
imply the existence of one which is in addition is metacompact?
23

24
Tall / Tall’s Questions
[ch. 3
This is probably due to D. Traylor. It has been popular among Moore space
aﬃcionados. If there is a normal ﬁrst countable non-collectionwise Hausdorﬀ
space or if there is a normal locally metrizable non-metrizable Moore space,
there is a metacompact normal non-metrizable Moore space.
The former
result is in Tall [1974c]; the latter in Tall [1984] (due to Watson). The
interest is whether metacompactness makes normal Moore spaces that much
closer to being metrizable. Fleissner’s examples (Fleissner [1982]) are meta-
compact, so all the usual discussion about consistency results and the Normal
Moore Space Conjecture apply to the question of whether metacompact nor-
mal Moore spaces are metrizable.
Question A4. Does the consistency of para-Lindel¨of normal Moore spaces
? 39.
being metrizable require large cardinals?
Probably it does—although this has not been proved; the question is whether
one can get by with say a measurable instead of a strong compact. This idea
is due to Watson.
Although Fleissner’s CH example is para-Lindel¨of, his
singular cardinal one is not, which is why the question is open.
Question A5. Does the consistency of normal Moore spaces of cardinality
? 40.
2ℵ0 being metrizable require large cardinals?
A weakly compact cardinal will do (Nyikos [1983], Dow, Tall and Weiss
[19∞a]) but I don’t know whether it’s necessary. I suspect some (small) large
cardinal is necessary; it would be very interesting if that were not the case.
Question A6.
Is it consistent that every ℵ1-collectionwise normal Moore
? 41.
space is metrizable?
This is discussed in §F (Reﬂection Problems) below.
B. Locally Compact Normal Non-collectionwise Normal Problems
Question B1. Does the consistency of locally compact normal spaces being
? 42.
collectionwise normal require large cardinals?
Presumably the answer is “yes”, by methods like those Fleissner used to
show them necessary for ﬁrst countable spaces (Fleissner [1982]). In [19∞]
Balogh used a supercompact cardinal to obtain consistency.
The result
one would hope to generalize as Fleissner generalized his CH example is the
Daniels-Gruenhage example from ♦∗of a locally compact non-collectionwise
normal space (Daniels and Gruenhage [1985]).

§C]
Collectionwise HausdorﬀProblems
25
Question B2.
Is there a consistent example of a locally compact normal 43. ?
metacompact space that’s not paracompact?
Under V = L (or indeed in any model in which normal spaces of character
≤ℵ1 are collectionwise Hausdorﬀ) there is no such example (Watson [1982]).
In ZFC there is none such that for each open cover U there is an n ∈ω such
that U has a point n-reﬁnement (Daniels [1983]).
Question B3.
Is there a consistent example of a locally compact locally 44. ?
connected normal space that’s not collectionwise normal?
This problem is due to Nyikos. The only connection I know between lo-
cal connectivity and collectionwise normality is that locally compact locally
connected perfectly normal spaces are collectionwise normal with respect to
submetacompact closed sets (Alster and Zenor [1976], or see Tall [1984]).
Question B4. Is it consistent that normal k-spaces are collectionwise nor- 45. ?
mal?
k-spaces are precisely the quotients of locally compact spaces. Partial re-
sults have been achieved by Daniels [19∞].
Question B5. Is it consistent without large cardinals that normal manifolds 46. ?
are collectionwise normal?
Nyikos noted that a weakly compact cardinal suﬃces (Nyikos [1983]), or
see Tall [1982]. Rudin obtained a counterexample from ♦+ (Rudin [19∞]).
This problem is related to A5 above, since the components have size ≤2ℵ0.
C. Collectionwise HausdorﬀProblems
Question C1.
Is it consistent (assuming large cardinals) that every ﬁrst 47. ?
countable ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀspace is collectionwise Hausdorﬀ?
This is discussed in §F below.
Question C2. Suppose κ is a singular strong limit and X is a normal space 48. ?
of character less than κ. Suppose X is λ-collectionwise Hausdorﬀfor all λ < κ.
Is X κ-collectionwise Hausdorﬀ?
There is a consistent ﬁrst countable counterexample if normality is dropped
(Fleissner and Shelah [19∞]). There is a counterexample if there are no
inner models with large cardinals, again without normality (Fleissner and
Shelah [19∞]). The reason the conjecture implicitly stated is plausible is

26
Tall / Tall’s Questions
[ch. 3
that it is true for singular κ such that GCH holds on a tail of the cardinals
below κ (Fleissner [1974]). The conjecture has applications in Tall [1988]
(there Fleissner’s result is misstated).
The next problem is more technical. In general, anything one can prove
about collectionwise Hausdorﬀness in L, one can prove in the (reverse) Easton
model via forcing, and vice versa. The one remaining exception follows:
Question C3. Prove via forcing (in a natural way, not by forcing ♦for sta-
? 49.
tionary systems) in the (reverse) Easton model that ℵ1-para-Lindel¨of regular
spaces of character ≤ℵ2 are collectionwise Hausdorﬀ.
A space is ℵ1-para-Lindel¨of if every open cover of size ≤ℵ1 ha a locally
countable open reﬁnement. See Fleissner [1983] and Tall [1988].
D. Weak Separation Problems
In Tall [1976c] I deﬁned a space to be weakly (λ-) collectionwise Hausdorﬀ
if each closed discrete subspace (of size λ) included one of the same cardi-
nality which was separated by disjoint open sets. GCH (actually, for every
κ, 2κ < (2κ)+) implies normal spaces of character ≤2ℵ0 are weakly col-
lectionwise Hausdorﬀ(Tall [1976c], or see Tall [1984]), but, as mentioned
previously, is consistent with the existence of a normal Moore space which is
not collectionwise Hausdorﬀ(Devlin and Shelah [1979]). Analogously de-
ﬁne weak collectionwise normality as the possibility of separating λ members
of a discrete collection of size λ, for any λ.
Question D1.
Is it consistent (assuming large cardinals) that every ﬁrst
? 50.
countable weakly ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀspace is weakly collectionwise
Hausdorﬀ?
This is discussed in §F below.
Question D2.
Is it consistent that normal ﬁrst countable spaces are all
? 51.
weakly collectionwise normal but that there is one that’s not collectionwise
normal?
The next three problems are from Tall [1981]. Given a normal space X
and a closed discrete subspace Y , a basic function is a function which assigns
to each point in Y an open set about it which contains no other point of Y .
Given such a basic function f and a Z ⊆Y , the open set
f(Z) =

{f(y): y ∈Z}

§D]
Weak Separation Problems
27
may or may not be disjoint from f(Y −Z). Since X is normal, there will be
some f for which these sets are disjoint. In general, one would expect 2|Y |
basic functions would be needed to witness the normality of (the 2|Y | subsets
of) Y . In Tall [1981] I proved for Y ’s of cardinality ℵ1:
D.1. Theorem.
(a) If ≤ℵ1 functions witness the normality of Y , then Y is separated.
(b) Assuming a generalized Martin’s Axiom (e.g. BACH), if < 2ℵ1 func-
tions witness the normality of Y , then Y is separated.
(c) If 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 and < 2ℵ1 functions witness the normality of Y , then
there is an uncountable separated subset of Y .
Question D3. Is it consistent that there is a space X and a closed discrete 52. ?
Y such that < 2ℵ1 (better, < 2ℵ0) functions witness the normality of Y , but
(every uncountable Z ⊆) Y is not separated?
Question D4.
Is CH equivalent to the assertion that whenever < 2ℵ0
53. ?
functions witness the normality of Y , Y is separated?
Question D5. Does 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 imply that assertion?
54. ?
(See Watson [1985]) Stepr¯ans and Watson proved that 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 ≤ℵω1
implies countably paracompact separable spaces are collectionwise normal.
(Note weakly collectionwise Hausdorﬀimplies collectionwise normal for sepa-
rable spaces.) Of course 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 suﬃces if we replace countable paracom-
pactness by normality.
Question D6. Does 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 imply countably paracompact separable (ﬁrst 55. ?
countable?) spaces are collectionwise normal?
Both this and Problem D5 are related to the following long-open hard
problem, which I believe is due to Laver.
Question D7. Is it consistent that there is an F ⊆ω1ω, with |F| < 2ℵ1, 56. ?
such that F dominates all functions from ω1 to ω?
There is no such family if cf(2ℵ0) < min(2ℵ1, ℵω1), while the existence of
such a family implies the existence of a measurable cardinal in an inner model
(Stepr¯ans [1982], Jech and Prikry [1984]).

Tall / Tall’s Questions
[ch. 3
E. Screenable and Para-Lindel¨of Problems
Screenability (every open cover has a σ-disjoint open reﬁnement) and para-
Lindel¨ofness are not as well-behaved (or well-understood) as more familiar
covering properties. Among the many open problems, I have chosen the ones
that particularly interest me. I have already mentioned one: A4 above.
Question E1. Is there a real example of a screenable normal space that’s
? 57.
not collectionwise normal?
There’s an example under ♦++ (Rudin [1983]). Such an example would
be a Dowker space since screenable normal spaces are collectionwise nor-
mal with respect to countably metacompact closed sets (Tall [1982], or see
Tall [1984]).
Question E2.
Is there a consistent example of a normal space with a σ-
? 58.
disjoint base that’s not collectionwise normal?
Such spaces are of course screenable. Since they are ﬁrst countable, there
are no absolute examples unless strongly compact cardinals are inconsistent.
Question E3. Is there a real example of a para-Lindel¨of ﬁrst countable space
? 59.
which in addition is
(a) regular but not paracompact,
(b) countably paracompact (and/or normal) but not paracompact.
Under MA plus not CH, there is even a para-Lindel¨of normal Moore space
that’s not metrizable (Navy [19∞]). Similarly under CH (Fleissner [1982]).
Without ﬁrst countability, there exists a real example of a para-Lindel¨of nor-
mal space which is not collectionwise normal (Navy [19∞], or see Fleiss-
ner [1984]).
F. Reﬂection Problems
The problems in this section all ask whether, if a proposition holds at ℵ1 or
other small cardinal, it holds for all larger cardinals.
Question F1. Is it consistent (assuming large cardinals) that if a ﬁrst count-
? 60.
able space has all its subspaces of size ≤ℵ1 metrizable, then it’s metrizable?
This is due to P. Hamburger. A non-reﬂecting stationary set of ω-coﬁnal
ordinals in ω2 is a counterexample (Hajnal and Juh´asz [1976]), so large car-
dinals are needed. By L´evy-collapsing a supercompact cardinal, Dow [19∞]

§F]
Reﬂection Problems
29
establishes consistency for spaces that in addition are locally of cardinality
≤ℵ1.
The following problems were raised earlier.
Question A6. Is it consistent that every ℵ1-collectionwise normal Moore
space is metrizable?
A space is ℵ1-collectionwise normal if any discrete collection of size ℵ1 can
be separated. In Tall [19∞b], assuming the consistency of a huge cardinal,
I proved it consistent that ℵ1-collectionwise normal Moore spaces of size ≤
ℵ2 are metrizable. Assuming a not unreasonable axiom the consistency of
which is, however, not currently known to follow from the usual large cardinal
axioms, the cardinality restriction can be removed.
Question C1.
Is it consistent (assuming large cardinals) that every ﬁrst
countable ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀspace is collectionwise Hausdorﬀ?
This question is due to Fleissner. Again, in the L´evy model, the proposition
holds for spaces of local cardinality ≤ℵ1 (Shelah [1977]).
The question
here is whether countably closed forcing can separate an unseparated discrete
collection in a ﬁrst countable space.
Question D1. Is it consistent (assuming large cardinals) that every ﬁrst
countable weakly ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀspace is weakly collectionwise
Hausdorﬀ?
In Tall [19∞b], from the consistency of a huge cardinal I proved the con-
sistency of ﬁrst countable weakly ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀspaces being
weakly ℵ2-collectionwise Hausdorﬀ. Using an axiom the consistency of which
is not known to follow from the usual large cardinality axioms—but which
is considerably weaker than one previously alluded to—and a result of Wat-
son [19∞], I can indeed get from ℵ1 to all larger cardinals.
Daniels [1988] obtained a ﬁrst countable weakly ℵ1-collectionwise Haus-
dorﬀspace that is not weakly ℵ2-collectionwise Hausdorﬀ, assuming MA plus
2ℵ0 = ℵ2.
Question F2. Is there a (real) example of a ﬁrst countable space X such 61. ?
that X × (ω1 + 1) is normal, but X is not paracompact?
The hypothesis that X × (ω1 + 1) is normal is equivalent to X being nor-
mal and ℵ1-paracompact (Kunen, see Przymusi´nski [1984]).
(A space is
κ-paracompact if every open cover of size ≤κ has a locally ﬁnite open re-
ﬁnement.) A non-reﬂecting stationary set of ω-coﬁnal ordinals in ω2 is again

30
Tall / Tall’s Questions
[ch. 3
a counterexample (Tall [19∞b]).
Assuming a huge cardinal, it’s consis-
tent that there’s no ﬁrst countable normal hereditarily ℵ1-paracompact non-
paracompact space of cardinality ≤ℵ2 (Tall [19∞b]). It is also consistent
from a huge that ﬁrst countable T2 ℵ2-paracompact spaces of size ≤ℵ3 are
paracompact (Tall [19∞a]); thus the example called for must likely depend
essentially on ω1. In view of the situation at ℵ2, we can also ask without
normality.
Question F3. Is there a (real example of a) ﬁrst countable ℵ1-paracompact
? 62.
space that’s not paracompact?
G. Countable Chain Condition Problems
Question G1. Does 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 imply there is an S-space (or an L-space)?
? 63.
An S-space is a hereditarily separable regular space that’s not hereditarily
Lindel¨of. An L-space is a hereditarily Lindel¨of space that’s not hereditarily
separable. See Roitman [1984] for a survey on the subject. The question is
whether CH can be weakened to 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1.
Question G2. Is every ﬁrst countable T2 space satisfying the ˇSanin condition
? 64.
separable?
A space satisﬁes the ˇSanin condition if it has caliber κ for every regular
uncountable κ. If the density of a space with countable tightness satisfying
the ˇSanin condition is less than ℵω, it is countable (Tall [1974a]).
Thus
2ℵ0 < ℵω implies ﬁrst countable T2 spaces satisfying the ˇSanin condition are
separable. Compare this with the facts that CH implies ﬁrst countable T2
spaces with caliber ℵ1 are separable (Efimov [1969], or see Tall [1974a]),
and that MA plus not CH implies there is a ﬁrst countable T2 space with
caliber ℵ1 that is not separable (Tall [1977a]).
Question G3. Find interesting necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the
? 65.
inclusion ordering on a topology to include a Souslin tree.
See Kurepa [1967], Rudin [1952], and Tall [1976b]. In the latter, it is
shown for example that it’s suﬃcient for the space to satisfy the countable
chain condition, be T1 and locally connected, and to have every ﬁrst category
set nowhere dense.
Question G4. Does there exist a real example of a ﬁrst countable hereditarily
? 66.
normal countable chain condition space which is not hereditarily separable?

§H]
Real Line Problems
31
Under CH, there is a ﬁrst countable L-space (van Douwen, Tall and
Weiss [1977]) and hence an example. If 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1, such an example would
yield a ﬁrst countable L-space (Tall [1974b]). A model in which there were no
such space would both have to have no ﬁrst countable L-space and yet have ev-
ery ﬁrst countable normal space be collectionwise Hausdorﬀ(Tall [1974b])—
a very curious combination indeed!
Question G5. Is it consistent with GCH that precaliber ℵ1 implies precal- 67. ?
iber ℵω+1?
Spaces with precaliber ℵ1 do have precaliber ℵω+1 if one assumes the axiom
alluded to in §F (Tall [19∞b]).
H. Real Line Problems
The rational sequence topology (see Steen and Seebach [1978]), the Pixley-
Roy topology (see e.g., van Douwen [1977]), and the density topology (see
e.g., Tall [1976a]) are all strengthenings of the usual topology on the real
line.
For the ﬁrst two, there is a characterization of normal subspaces in
terms of their properties as sets of reals. By the same proof (Bing [1951],
Tall [1977b]) as for the tangent disk space, a set X of reals is normal in the
rational sequence topology iﬀit’s a Q-set in the usual topology, while X is
normal in the Pixley-Roy topology iﬀit’s a strong Q-set (Rudin [1983]).
Question H1. Characterize the normal subspaces of the density topology.
68. ?
In Tall [1978] I obtained the following partial result:
H.1. Theorem.
If Y is a normal subspace of the density topology, then
Y = S∪T , where S is generalized Sierpi´nski, T is a nullset such that Z∩T = ∅
for every nullset Z ⊆S, every subset of Z is the intersection of Z with a
Euclidean Fσδ.
(A set S of reals is generalized Sierpi´nski if its intersection with every
nullset has cardinality less than continuum.) The closure referred to is in
the density topology, so that even if the converse were proved, the resulting
characterization would not be quite satisfactory. On the other hand, under
MA plus not CH, one can construct a generalized Sierpi´nski S (namely one
of outer measure 1) and a nullset T disjoint from S such that S ∪T is not
normal (since |T | = 2ℵ0) and yet every null Z ⊆S is a Q-set.

1. Introduction
This assortment is a list of problems that I worked on between 1979 and 1989
which I failed to solve. Some of the problems are due to other topologists
and set theorists and I have attributed them when references are available in
the literature. An earlier list appeared in 1984 in the Italian journal, Rend.
Circ. Mat. Palermo. This list was entitled “Sixty questions on regular non-
paracompact spaces”. Thirteen of these questions have since been answered
(we shall give the numbering in that earlier paper in each case).
• Carlson, in [1984], used Nyikos’ solution from Nyikos [1980] of the
normal Moore space problem to show that if it is consistent that there
is a weakly compact cardinal then it is consistent that normal Moore
spaces of cardinality at most 2ℵ0 are metrizable. This solved Palermo #11.
• In [19∞a] Balogh showed at the STACY conference at York Univer-
sity that assuming the consistency of the existence of a supercompact
cardinal, it is consistent that normal locally compact spaces are collec-
tionwise normal thus solving Palermo #16. Tall had earlier established
this result for spaces of cardinality less than ℶω. See Tall’s B1.
• In [1985] Daniels and Gruenhage constructed a perfectly normal
locally compact collectionwise Hausdorﬀspace under ♦∗which is not
collectionwise normal, thus answering Palermo #22, Palermo #23 and
Palermo #24 in one blow.
• Balogh showed that under V = L countably paracompact locally com-
pact spaces are collectionwise Hausdorﬀand that under V = L count-
ably paracompact locally compact metacompact spaces are paracompact
thus answering Palermo #26 and giving a partial solution to Palermo #28.
• Burke showed that under PMEA, countably paracompact Moore spaces
are metrizable thus solving a famous old problem and incidentally an-
swering Palermo #30, Palermo #33 and Palermo #34.
• It turned out that Palermo #37 and Palermo #47 were somewhat ill-
posed since Fleissner’s CH space already in existence at that time an-
swered both in its ZFC version by being a para-Lindel¨of metacompact
normal space of character 2ℵ0 which is not collectionwise normal.
• Daniels solved Palermo #56 by showing that in ZFC the Pixley-Roy
space of the co-countable topology on ω1 is collectionwise Hausdorﬀ(it
was her question to begin with).

2. Normal not Collectionwise HausdorﬀSpaces
Problem 1.
(Palermo #2) Does CH imply that there is a normal not
? 69.
collectionwise Hausdorﬀspace of character ℵ2?
Problem 2.
(Palermo #4) Does ¬CH imply that there is a normal not
? 70.
collectionwise Hausdorﬀspace of character 2ℵ0?
A natural question which has never been asked explicitly but has occupied
a huge amount of thought is “What is the least character of a normal space
which is not collectionwise Hausdorﬀ?”. There are many independence results
here so we ask only that this number be calculated under each possible cardinal
arithmetic. The above are the two simplest cases.
These questions point out the two kinds of consistent theorems which we
have for getting normal spaces of small character to be collectionwise Haus-
dorﬀ. One is the V = L argument which requires character ≤ℵ1. The other
is the Cohen real or PMEA argument which requires character less than 2ℵ0.
To answer either of the above questions negatively would thus require, I think,
a new kind of consistency proof and that would certainly be interesting—and
challenging. To answer either of the above questions positively would be sim-
ply astounding.
Problem 3. Does 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 imply that there is no family of size less than
? 71.
2ℵ1 which generates the power set of ω1 under countable unions?
Problem 4. Is 2ℵ0 = 2ℵ1 = ℵ3 consistent with the existence of a family of
? 72.
size ℵ2 which generates the power set of ω1 under countable unions?
These questions arose in a paper (Watson [1988a]) which studied possi-
ble methods of lowering the character of Bing’s space directly. That paper
showed that the existence of such families of cardinality less than 2ℵ1 implies
the existence of a normal space of character less than 2ℵ1 which is not collec-
tionwise Hausdorﬀ. I am most interested in these questions however purely
as problems in combinatorial set theory.
Juris Stepr¯ans in [1982], and independently Jech and Prikry in [1984]
showed that the answer to the ﬁrst question is yes so long as either 2ℵ0 < ℵω1
holds or else 2ℵ0 = κ, (κ+)L < 2ℵ1 and the covering lemma over L is true
(note the connection with problem 26). Thus a solution in either direction
would be quite startling.
The other case of 2ℵ0 = 2ℵ1 brings to mind MAℵ1 which, however, implies
that the minimal size of such a family is 2ℵ1. The model where ℵω Cohen
reals are added to a model of GCH has such a subfamily of cardinality ℵω <
2ℵ0. This is a rather unsatisfying result and the second question is designed

§2]
Normal not Collectionwise HausdorﬀSpaces
41
to exploit this. This question probably has something to do with Kurepa’s
hypothesis.
Problem 5. (Palermo #7) Is there an axiom which implies that ﬁrst count- 73. ?
able normal spaces are ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀ, which follows from the
product measure extension axiom, from ♦∗, from ♦for stationary systems
and which holds in the reverse Easton model?
Problem 6. (Palermo #5) If ♦S holds for each stationary S ⊂ω1, then are 74. ?
normal ﬁrst countable spaces ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀ?
The ﬁrst problem was proposed to the author by Frank Tall. He wanted
to unify the various proofs (Tall [1977], Fleissner [1974], Shelah [1979],
Nyikos[1980]) of the consistency of the statement that ﬁrst countable normal
spaces are collectionwise Hausdorﬀ. I was unable to solve this question but
wrote a paper (Watson [1984]) in which I introduced an axiom Φ which
implies that ﬁrst countable normal spaces are ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀ,
which follows from ♦∗and from ♦for stationary systems. It thus provided a
uniﬁed (and simple) proof for both Fleisser’s result and Shelah’s result. The
referee noted that Φ held in a forcing model similar to the reverse Easton
model but I never checked whether it held in that reverse Easton model used
by Tall in 1968 to show the consistency of normal Moore spaces of cardinality
less than ℵω1 being metrizable. I was also never able to determine whether
the product measure extension axiom used by Nyikos implies Φ. I am still
interested in knowing whether this (or another) axiom can unify these four
proofs. An observer from outside the normal Moore space fraternity might
feel that this is a somewhat esoteric question but the fact of the matter is
that the consistency of normal ﬁrst countable spaces being ℵ1-collectionwise
Hausdorﬀwill remain of interest in the decades to come and a single proof
would enhance our understanding of the set theoretic nature of this property.
The second problem is an attempt to ascertain why ♦is not enough. She-
lah’s model in Devlin and Shelah [1979] in which there is a non-metrizable
normal Moore space satisﬁes ♦but exploits a stationary set on which ♦does
not hold. It is that result together with the two consistent theorems of Fleiss-
ner [1974] and Shelah [1979] which give rise to this desperate attempt to
ﬁgure out what is going on with ♦. After all, it is Fleissner who created ♦for
stationary systems so this is a question about the nature of ♦-principles, not
really a question about general topology at all. The Easton model can also
be included in problem 5 (see Tall [1988]).
Problem 7.
(Fleissner; Palermo #57; Tall’s C1) Does ZFC imply that 75. ?
there is a ﬁrst countable ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀspace which fails to be
collectionwise Hausdorﬀ?

42
Watson / Wishes
[ch. 4
This is a central question on reﬂection.
It has been much worked on.
In [1977] Shelah showed that the answer is yes for locally countable spaces
if a supercompact cardinal is L´evy-collapsed to ℵ2. On the other hand E(ω2)
is enough to construct a counterexample. Thus large cardinals are needed to
establish a consistency result if indeed it is consistent. In [1977b] Fleissner
has conjectured that L´evy-collapsing a compact cardinal to ℵ2 willl yield a
model in which ﬁrst countable ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀspaces are collec-
tionwise Hausdorﬀ. As in the pursuit of problem 11, far more eﬀort has gone
into obtaining a consistency result than has gone into trying to construct a
counterexample. The conventional wisdom is that the set-theoretic technol-
ogy is simply not ready yet and that we just have to wait. I conjecture that
there is a ZFC example and that we really have to look somewhere other
than ordinals for large ﬁrst countable spaces which are not paracompact.
Problem 8.
(Palermo #1) Does GCH imply that normal ﬁrst countable
? 76.
ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀspaces are collectionwise Hausdorﬀ?
In [1977], Shelah constructed two consistent examples of a normal Moore
space which is ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀbut which fails to be ℵ2-collection-
wise Hausdorﬀ. The ﬁrst satisﬁed 2ℵ0 = ℵ1 and 2ℵ1 = ℵ3 and the second
satisﬁed 2ℵ0 = 2ℵ1 = ℵ3. These cardinal arithmetics make the question quite
natural. Fleissner asked this question in [1977b].
Problem 9. (Palermo #6; Tall’s # C2) If κ is a strong limit cardinal, then
? 77.
are normal ﬁrst countable spaces which are < κ-collectionwise Hausdorﬀ, κ-
collectionwise Hausdorﬀ?
In Watson [19∞a], we showed that the answer is yes for strong limit
cardinals of countable coﬁnality even without normality (answering a question
from Fleissner [1977c]; in that paper Fleissner had proved the same result
assuming GCH). Aside from that nothing seems to be known about getting
normal ﬁrst countable spaces where collectionwise Hausdorﬀﬁrst fails at a
limit cardinal. In Shelah [1977], a consistent counterexample which is not
normal was obtained.
Problem 10.
(Palermo #3) Does CH imply that normal ﬁrst countable
? 78.
spaces are weakly ℵ2-collectionwise Hausdorﬀ?
The motive for this question is that the only examples of spaces which fail to
be weakly collectionwise Hausdorﬀare those which do not use pressing-down
arguments but rather simply ∆-system arguments.
Such examples always
seem to use an identiﬁcation of the unseparated set with a subset of the real
line. Of course, there is no reason why it should be this way but I spent a
lot of time trying to construct an example some other way and got nowhere.

§3]
Non-metrizable Normal Moore Spaces
43
On the other hand, a theorem would be quite surprising and would provide
convincing evidence that the Moore plane is canonical.
3. Non-metrizable Normal Moore Spaces
Problem 11. (Palermo #8; Tall’s A1) Does 2ℵ0 = ℵ2 imply the existence of 79. ?
a non-metrizable normal Moore space?
I only add that it is dangerous to spend 95% of the eﬀort on a question
trying to prove it in one direction. Very little eﬀort has gone into trying to
modify Fleissner’s [1982b, 1982a] construction of a non-metrizable Moore
space from the continuum hypothesis. In fact, there’s probably only about
two or three people who really understand his construction (I am not one of
them). If the conventional wisdom that collapsing a large cardinal should get
the consistency of the normal Moore space conjecture with 2ℵ0 = ℵ2, then
why hasn’t it been done?
Problem 12. (Palermo #9; Tall’s A3) Does the existence of a non-metrizable 80. ?
normal Moore space imply the existence of a metacompact non-metrizable
normal Moore space?
Problem 13. (Palermo #12) Does the existence of a non-metrizable nor- 81. ?
mal Moore space imply the existence of a normal Moore space which is not
collectionwise normal with respect to metrizable sets?
The reason this question remains of interest is that a tremendous amount
of eﬀort has gone into obtaining partial positive results. Rudin and Star-
bird [1977] and Nyikos [1981] both obtained some technical results of great
interest. Nyikos showed, in particular, that if there is a non-metrizable normal
Moore space, then there is a metacompact Moore space with a family of closed
sets which is normalized but not separated. In Watson [19∞a], it is shown
that if there is a non-metrizable normal Moore space which is non-metrizable
because it has a nonseparated discrete family of closed metrizable sets then
there is a metacompact non-metrizable normal Moore space. This means that
if you believe in a counterexample you had better solve problem 32 ﬁrst! If
you believe in a theorem as Rudin and Starbird and Nyikos did, you have a
lot of reading to do. I think there is a counterexample.
Problem 14. (Palermo #10; see Tall’s A2 and A4) Does the existence of 82. ?
a non-metrizable normal Moore space imply the existence of a para-Lindel¨of
non-metrizable normal Moore space?
The normal Moore space problem enjoyed lots of consistent counterexam-
ples long before para-Lindel¨of raised it’s head.
However in [1981] Caryn

44
Watson / Wishes
[ch. 4
Navy managed to show how to use MA + ¬CH to get a para-Lindel¨of ex-
ample. Fleissner’s CH example of a non-metrizable normal Moore space
from [1982b] turns out to be para-Lindel¨of (after all, he was modifying Navy’s
example). The only part that is not clear is whether the singular cardinals
hypothesis can get you a para-Lindel¨of counterexample to the normal Moore
space conjecture. Probably the best positive result that can be hoped for is
to show that Fleissner’s SCH counterexample can be modiﬁed to be para-
Lindel¨of. That would be a good result since a deep understanding of Fleiss-
ner’s space would be required and that space does have to be digested. A neg-
ative result is more likely and would really illustrate the diﬀerence between
Fleissner’s CH example and his SCH example from [1982b] and [1982a]
and that would be valuable.
Problem 15. (Palermo #14) Are ˇCech-complete locally connected normal
? 83.
Moore spaces metrizable?
Problem 16. (Palermo #13) Are normal Moore spaces sub-metrizable?
? 84.
4. Locally Compact Normal Spaces
Problem 17. (Palermo #15; Tall’s B2) Are locally compact normal meta-
? 85.
compact spaces paracompact?
I have spent a lot of time on this question.
It was originally stated by
Tall [1974] although it would be diﬃcult to appreciate a result proved
by Arhangel’ski˘ı in [1971] without thinking of it. In Watson [1982], it
was shown that, under V = L, locally compact normal metacompact spaces
are paracompact. However, the techniques for constructing examples under
MA + ¬CH (the usual place to look) did not seem to provide any way of
getting locally compact spaces and metacompact spaces at the same time.
In [1983] Peg Daniels showed in ZFC that locally compact normal bound-
edly metacompact spaces are paracompact. This surprising result raised the
hopes of everyone (except Frank Tall) that the statement in question might ac-
tually be a theorem in ZFC. It hasn’t worked out that way so far. Boundedly
metacompact really is diﬀerent from metacompact although most examples
don’t show this. If there is a theorem here in ZFC it would be an astounding
result. If there is an example in some model (as I think there is), it would
require a deeper understanding of the Pixley-Roy space than has so far ex-
isted. Either way this is a central question. Another related question with a
(much?) higher probability of a consistent counterexample is problem 18.

§4]
Locally Compact Normal Spaces

Problem 18. (Palermo #28) Are countably paracompact locally compact 86. ?
metacompact spaces paracompact?
Problem 19. Does MAℵ1 imply that normal locally compact meta-Lindel¨of 87. ?
spaces are paracompact?
This problem is related to problem 17. We mentioned that no consistent ex-
ample of a locally compact normal metacompact space which is not paracom-
pact is known. Actually, even constructing a consistent example of a locally
compact normal meta-Lindel¨of space which is not paracompact is non-trivial.
We constructed such a space in Watson [1986] but the proof makes essential
use of a compact hereditarily Lindel¨of space which is not hereditarily separa-
ble. These spaces do not exist under MA + ¬CH. Thus what this question
does is up the ante. Anyone except Frank Tall working on a counterexample
to problem 17 is probably using Martin’s axiom. So what we are saying is
“you’ll never do it—bet you can’t even get meta-Lindel¨of”. Of course, maybe
there is an example but that would require a completely diﬀerent approach to
getting meta-Lindel¨of together with locally compact and normal. That would
be just as interesting to me because I tried for a long time to get the results
of Watson [1986] using Martin’s axiom. Of course, such an example cannot
be done in ZFC because of Balogh’s result from [19∞b] that, under V = L,
locally compact normal meta-Lindel¨of spaces are paracompact.
Problem 20.
(Palermo #17) Does ZFC imply that there is a perfectly 88. ?
normal locally compact space which is not paracompact?
This is my favorite question. If there is an example then what a strange
creature it must be. A series of results running from Mary Ellen Rudin’s
result from [1979] that under MA + ¬CH perfectly normal manifolds are
metrizable runs through results of Lane [1980] and Gruenhage [1980] to
culminate in a result of Balogh and Junnila that, under MA+¬CH, perfectly
normal locally compact collectionwise Hausdorﬀspaces are paracompact. On
the other hand, under V = L, normal locally compact spaces are collectionwise
Hausdorﬀ. This means that, if there is in ZFC a perfectly normal locally
compact space which is not paracompact, then under MA + ¬CH it is not
collectionwise Hausdorﬀbut that under V = L it is collectionwise Hausdorﬀ.
Now there are two ways this can be done. First, by stating a set-theoretic
condition, using it to construct one space and then using its negation to
construct another space.
2ℵ0 = 2ℵ1 is the only worthwhile axiom I know
whose negation is worth something (although see Weiss [1975] and [1977]).
Second, by constructing a space whose collectionwise Hausdorﬀness happens
to be independent. This is ﬁne but the fragment of V = L is small enough
to force with countably closed forcing so the deﬁnition of such a space better
depend pretty strongly on what the subsets of both ω and ω1 are.
There

46
Watson / Wishes
[ch. 4
are however examples in most models. Under CH, the Kunen line (Juh´asz,
Kunen and Rudin [1976]) is an example of a perfectly normal locally compact
S-space which is not paracompact. Under MA + ¬CH, the Cantor tree with
ℵ1 branches is an example.
On the other hand, a consistent theorem would be amazing.
To get it
by putting together the two consistency proofs would be quite hard. The
MA + ¬CH result uses both p = c and the non-existence of a Suslin line so
that’s a lot of set theory. The V = L result can be done without CH but
then you have to add weakly compact many Cohen reals or something like
that (Tall [1984]). I haven’t tried this direction at all, although set-theorists
have. It looks impossible to me.
Problem 21. (Palermo #19) Does the existence of a locally compact nor-
? 89.
mal space which is not collectionwise Hausdorﬀimply the existence of a ﬁrst
countable normal space which is not collectionwise Hausdorﬀ?
I think the answer is yes. This belief stems from Watson [1982] where
an intimate relation between the two existence problems was shown. The
only thing that is missing is the possibility that there might be a model in
which normal ﬁrst countable spaces are ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀand yet
that in that model there is a normal ﬁrst countable space which fails to be
ℵ2-collectionwise Hausdorﬀ. This seems unlikely, though it is open, and yet
the question might be answered positively in any case (see Shelah [1977]).
A counterexample would have been more interesting before Balogh showed
the consistency of locally compact normal spaces being collectionwise normal.
However it may yet provide a clue to an answer to problem 17.
Problem 22. (Palermo #18; Tall’s B5) Are large cardinals needed to show
? 90.
that normal manifolds are collectionwise normal?
In 1986, Mary Ellen Rudin built a normal manifold which is not collec-
tionwise normal under the axiom ♦+. Meanwhile, Peter Nyikos [1989] has
shown that if the existence of a weakly compact cardinal is consistent then
it is consistent that normal manifolds are collectionwise normal. The most
likely solution to this problem is doing it on the successor of a singular cardi-
nal where ♦- like principles tend to hold unless there are large cardinals (see
Fleissner [1982a]). A consistent theorem that normal manifolds are collec-
tionwise normal probably means starting from scratch, where so many have
started before.
Problem 23. (Palermo #21) Does ZFC imply that normal manifolds are
? 91.
collectionwise Hausdorﬀ?
Mary Ellen Rudin’s example in problem 22 is collectionwise Hausdorﬀ. This
can be deduced from the fact that under V = L normal ﬁrst countable spaces

§5]
Countably Paracompact Spaces
47
are collectionwise Hausdorﬀ(Fleissner [1974]).
Thus no example of any
kind has yet been demonstrated to exist and all we have are a few consistent
theorems.
Problem 24. (Palermo #20; Tall’s B3) Are normal locally compact locally 92. ?
connected spaces collectionwise normal?
Reed and Zenor showed in [1976] that locally connected locally com-
pact normal Moore spaces are metrizable in ZFC. Zoltan Balogh showed
in [19∞d] that connected locally compact normal submeta-Lindel¨of spaces
are paracompact under 2ω < 2ω1. Balogh showed in [19∞c] that locally
connected locally compact normal submeta-Lindel¨of spaces are paracompact
in ZFC. Gruenhage constructed in [1984] a connected locally compact non-
metrizable normal Moore space under MA + ¬CH. Problem 24 attempts to
determine whether covering properties have anything central to do with these
phenomena.
Problem 25. (Palermo #25) Does ZFC imply that there is a normal ex- 93. ?
tremally disconnected locally compact space which is not paracompact?
In [1978] Kunen and Parsons showed that if there is a weakly compact
cardinal then there is a normal extremally disconnected locally compact space
which is not paracompact. In [1977] Kunen showed that there is an normal
extremally disconnected space which is not paracompact.
This is a great
question. I suspect that useful ideas may be found in Watson [19∞e] where
normal spaces which are not collectionwise normal with respect to extremally
disconnected spaces are constructed.
5. Countably Paracompact Spaces
Problem 26. (Palermo #27; Tall’s D6) Does 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 imply that separable 94. ?
ﬁrst countable countably paracompact spaces are collectionwise Hausdorﬀ?
In [1937] Jones showed that, under 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 normal separable spaces have
no uncountable closed discrete sets (and thus that separable normal Moore
spaces are metrizable). In [1964] Heath showed that, in fact, the existence of
a normal separable space with an uncountable closed discrete set is equivalent
to 2ℵ0 = 2ℵ1.
These results blend well with the ongoing problem of determining the rela-
tion between normality and countable paracompactness. The normal separa-
ble space with an uncountable closed discrete set is, in fact, countably para-
compact and so Fleissner [1978], Przymusi´nski [1977] and Reed [1980]
asked whether the existence of a countably paracompact separable space with

48
Watson / Wishes
[ch. 4
an uncountable closed discrete set is also equivalent to 2ℵ0 = 2ℵ1. Fleiss-
ner [1978] fueled this suspicion with a proof that the continuum hypothesis
implies that countably paracompact separable spaces have no uncountable
closed discrete set. In Watson [1985], we showed that the existence of such a
space is equivalent to the existence of a dominating family in ω1ω of cardinal-
ity 2ℵ0. This was somewhat satisfying since the equivalence of the existence
of such a family with 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 was known as an open problem in set theory.
In 1983, Stepr¯ans and Jech and Prikry independently showed that if the con-
tinuum is a regular cardinal and there are no measurable cardinals in an inner
model, then the latter equivalence holds. The general set-theoretic problem
remains open.
Back in general topology, what about ﬁrst countable spaces? The examples
that are used in all these results have character equal to the continuum. One
expects ﬁrst countability to be a big help but so far it seems useless in this
context. The drawback to this question is that if the answer is no, one ﬁrst
has to solve the set-theoretic question and then ﬁgure out how to lower the
character from the continuum to ℵ0. Getting the character down is always
interesting. On the other hand, if there is a theorem, that might involve a
hard look at the weak version of ♦invented by Keith Devlin (Devlin and
Shelah [1978]) and lots of people would be interested in an essential use of
that axiom.
Problem 27. (Palermo #31) Does 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 imply that special Aronszajn
? 95.
trees are not countably paracompact?
This question is quite attractive to some precisely because it is not a topo-
logical question. It is however a natural question about the structure of Aron-
szajn trees.
In [1980] Fleissner noted that the proof in Fleissner [1975] that under
MA + ¬CH, special Aronszajn trees are normal could be modiﬁed to show
that under MA + ¬CH special Aronszajn trees are countably paracompact.
We showed in Watson [1985], that under (∀stationary S ⊂ω1) ♦S, special
Aronszajn trees are not countably paracompact. This proof, however, was
implicit in Fleissner [1975, 1980]. Fleissner had shown that under V = L,
special Aronszajn trees are not normal but the key result that gave rise to the
present question is the proof by Shelah and Devlin [1979], that 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1
implies that special Aronszajn trees are not normal. Fleissner [1980] cites
a result of Nyikos that normal implies countably paracompact in trees. This
means that the present statement in question is weaker than the Devlin-Shelah
result.
Problem 28. (Palermo #32) If the continuum function is one-to-one and X
? 96.
is a countably paracompact ﬁrst countable space, then is e(X) ≤c(X)?

§5]
Countably Paracompact Spaces
49
This is just an attempt to conjecture a form of Shapirovski˘ı’s improvement
of Jones’ lemma at each cardinal. Recall that Jones proved in [1937] that sep-
arable normal spaces have no uncountable closed discrete set under 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1.
That proof was sharpened by Shapirovski˘ı to show that in normal ﬁrst count-
able spaces 2ℵ0 < 2ℵ1 implies that closed discrete sets of cardinality ℵ1 have
a subset of cardinality ℵ1 which can be separated by disjoint open sets. Thus
if there are no disjoint families of more than ℵ0 many open sets then there
are no closed discrete sets of cardinality ℵ1. That proof was observed to ex-
tend to higher cardinals by Frank Tall [1976] and neatly summarized in the
form: if the continuum function is one-to-one and X is a normal ﬁrst count-
able space then e(X) ≤c(X). The question is just asking whether this nice
statement about cardinal functions applies equally to countably paracompact
ﬁrst countable spaces. I believe that it does.
Problem 29. (Palermo #29) Does ♦∗imply that countably paracompact 97. ?
ﬁrst countable spaces are ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀ?
This question is just something that I expected would have a positive answer
but couldn’t make any headway on. Shelah [1979] showed that ♦∗implies
that normal ﬁrst countable spaces are ℵ1-collectionwise Hausdorﬀand every
other separation theorem which used normality eventually was extended to
countable paracompactness (see Watson [1985] and Burke’s use of PMEA).
The real question here is vague: “is there a distinction between the separation
properties of normality and countable paracompactness”. A negative answer
to the speciﬁc question would answer the vague question quite clearly. A pos-
itive answer would get a little closer to the combinatorial essence underlying
separation and that would be a worthy accomplishment.
Problem 30. Does the existence of a countably paracompact non-normal 98. ?
Moore space imply the existence of a normal non-metrizable Moore space?
This question was ﬁrst asked by Wage [1976] since, in that paper, he
showed the converse to be true. All the available evidence indicates that the
answer is yes. Peter Nyikos [1980] showed that PMEA implies that normal
Moore spaces are metrizable. This was later extended in a non-trivial way,
by Dennis Burke, who showed that, under PMEA, countably paracompact
Moore spaces are metrizable.
Problem 31. (Palermo #59) Does ZFC imply that collectionwise Hausdorﬀ99. ?
ω1-trees are countably paracompact?

6. Collectionwise HausdorﬀSpaces
Problem 32.
(Palermo #38) Is there a normal not collectionwise normal
? 100.
space which is collectionwise normal with respect to collectionwise normal
sets?
This apparently frivolous main question is intended to be a speciﬁc version
of a more serious question (ﬁrst asked in Watson [1988b]): Characterize
those spaces Y and categories C for which there exists a normal space which
is collectionwise normal with respect to discrete families of sets in C but not
collectionwise normal with respect to copies of Y . This tries to get at the heart
of many constructions like those in Watson [19∞e]. A less extreme question
is: Characterize those spaces Y for which there exists a normal collectionwise
Hausdorﬀspace which is not collectionwise normal with respect to copies of
Y . The main question is worth solving. If the answer is no, then I would be
amazed and it would solve problem 12. If the answer is yes, then I think we
would getting at the heart of a topic on which I have spent a great deal of
time (Watson [19∞e] is devoted to establishing partial results).
Problem 33. (Palermo #60) Does ZFC imply that there is a collectionwise

HausdorﬀMoore space which is not collectionwise normal with respect to
compact sets?
Problem 34.
(Palermo #39) Is there a normal collectionwise Hausdorﬀ

Problem 35.
(Palermo #40) Is it consistent that there is a normal ﬁrst
? 103.
countable collectionwise Hausdorﬀspace which is not collectionwise normal
with respect to compact sets?
In an unpublished result from 1980, Fleissner and Reed constructed, by
using a measurable cardinal, a regular collectionwise Hausdorﬀspace which
is not collectionwise normal with respect to compact sets. In [1983] Mike
Reed constructed in ZFC a collectionwise Hausdorﬀﬁrst countable regular
space which is not collectionwise normal with respect to compact metric sets.
He also obtained a collectionwise HausdorﬀMoore space which is not collec-
tionwise normal with respect to compact metric sets under the continuum
hypothesis or Martin’s axiom and asked the ﬁrst question. The answer could
well turn out to be yes since normality is not required and of course that would
be preferable to Reed’s results. If the answer is no, that is more interesting
because the proof would penetrate into the manner in which the closed unit
interval can be embedded in a Moore space and that would be quite exciting.
In Watson [19∞e], an example was constructed of a normal collectionwise

§6]
Collectionwise HausdorﬀSpaces
51
Hausdorﬀspace which is not collectionwise normal with respect to copies of
[0, 1]. In that example, the proof of not collectionwise normality is not a ∆-
system argument but rather a measure-theoretic argument. As a result, we
have no hope of using that method to get an example in which ℵ1 many copies
of [0, 1] cannot be separated unless there is a subset of the reals of cardinal-
ity ℵ1 which has positive measure. Thus an example answering the second
question would have to be essentially diﬀerent from that of Watson [19∞e]
and I do not believe such an example exists. On the other hand, a theorem,
under MA + ¬CH for example, would be quite interesting. The example of
Watson [19∞e] is badly not ﬁrst countable. Anyway, the only normal ﬁrst
countable collectionwise Hausdorﬀspaces which are not collectionwise normal
are Fleissner’s space of Fleissner [1976] and the ones based on Navy’s space
of Navy [1981] and Fleissner [1982b, 1982a]. The ﬁrst of these requires the
unseparated sets to be badly non-compact. The second requires the unsep-
arated sets to be non-separable metric sets. Neither of these constructions
is going to be easily modiﬁed to a positive solution to the third question. I
don’t think such a consistent example exists— it’s asking too much. On the
other hand, a negative answer means that rare thing: a ZFC result!
Problem 36. (Palermo #41) Does ZFC imply that normal ﬁrst countable 104. ?
collectionwise Hausdorﬀspaces are collectionwise normal with respect to scat-
tered sets?
Problem 37. (Palermo #35) Does V = L imply that normal ﬁrst countable 105. ?
spaces are collectionwise normal with respect to separable sets?
Problem 38. (Palermo #36) Does V = L imply that normal ﬁrst countable 106. ?
spaces are collectionwise normal with respect to copies of ω1?
The prototypes of normal collectionwise Hausdorﬀspaces which are not
collectionwise normal are Fleissner’s space of Fleissner [1976] and Navy’s
space of Navy [1981]. The latter space has an unseparated discrete family of
Baire spaces of weight ℵ1. These Baire spaces are very non-scattered. On the
other hand Fleissner’s space has a unseparated discrete family of copies of the
ordinal space ω1. These sets are scattered. The latter type has been success-
fully modiﬁed to be ﬁrst countable: that is Fleissner’s solution to the normal
Moore space conjecture (Fleissner [1982b, 1982a]). The ﬁrst question is try-
ing to ask whether the former type can be modiﬁed to be ﬁrst countable. This
is a question which has great intrinsic interest. A consistent method which
succeeds in lowering the character of the former prototype would undoubtedly
be quite useful in many other contexts. A positive answer would be unthink-
able. This ﬁrst question is however mostly a question about my own inability
to follow a proof in the literature. A paper (Fleissner [1982c]) has appeared
which gives a negative answer to this question. The idea of this paper is very

52
Watson / Wishes
[ch. 4
clever and introduces an axiom which has since been used (Rudin [1983])
to construct what is possibly the most clever example in general topology.
However I have spent a great deal of eﬀort trying to understand the proof
in Fleissner [1982c]. I have conversed with the author who has suggested
several changes. For various reasons I have been unable to locate anyone who
has checked all of the details. It is undoubtedly the case that the proof is
simply over my head but I just cannot follow it. In my stubborn fashion, I
still want to know the answer to this ﬁrst question. If these comments succeed
in provoking someone to read Fleissner [1982c] and then to explain it to me,
then they will have done both of us a favor, for they will have read an inspired
paper and, in addition, set my mind at ease (in August 1989 Bill Fleissner
circulated a corrigendum to that paper).
The second and third questions are follow-ups in my tribute to Fleissner’s
George (Fleissner [1976]), a normal collectionwise Hausdorﬀspace which
fails to be collectionwise normal with respect to copies of ω1.
This space
has been modiﬁed (Watson [19∞a]) to fail to be collectionwise normal with
respect to separable sets (S-spaces actually), under suitable set-theoretic as-
sumptions. The example of Fleissner [1982c] fails to be collectionwise nor-
mal with respect to copies of a space something like ω1. The second question
asks: “Can a S-space (like Ostaszewski’s space [1976]) be used?”. The third
question asks “Was it really necessary to use something diﬀerent from ω1?”.
Fleissner showed in [1977a] that it is consistent that normal ﬁrst countable
spaces are collectionwise normal with respect to copies of ω1 by collapsing an
inaccessible in a model of the constructible universe (see also Dow, Tall and
Weiss [19∞]). I think that the techniques that one would have to develop
in order to solve these questions would be useful in many areas of general
topology, and thus worth the eﬀort.
7. Para-Lindel¨of Spaces
Problem 39.
(Palermo #43) Are para-Lindel¨of regular spaces countably
? 107.
paracompact?
This is the main open problem on para-Lindel¨of spaces. The original ques-
tion was whether para-Lindel¨of was equivalent to paracompact– one more
feather in the cap of equivalences of paracompactness established by Stone
and Michael in the 1950s (see Burke’s article in the handbook of Set-Theoretic
Topology Burke [1984]). This question was ﬁnally solved by Caryn Navy, a
student of Mary Ellen Rudin, in Navy [1981]. Her construction was a rather
general one that permitted quite a lot of latitude; she obtained ﬁrst count-
able ones under MA + ¬CH using the Moore plane, she obtained a ZFC
example using Bing’s space. Fleissner [1982b, 1982a] later modiﬁed this
example to be a Moore space under the continuum hypothesis, thus solving

§7]
Para-Lindel¨of Spaces
53
the normal Moore space conjecture. Certain properties seemed hard to get
however. These diﬃculties each gave rise to questions which were listed in
Navy’s thesis. The main open problem listed above is due to the fact that
all the constructions are intrinsically countably paracompact. I tried for a
long time to build in the failure of countable paracompactness but each time
para-Lindel¨of failed as well. It may be useful to note that the whole idea of
Navy’s construction was to take Fleissner’s space of Fleissner [1979] which
was σ-para-Lindel¨of but not paracompact and build in a way to “separate”
the countably-many locally countable families so that one locally countable
reﬁnement is obtained. This way was normality. No other way of getting
para-Lindel¨of is known. I don’t think another way of getting para-Lindel¨of
is even possible– Navy’s method looks quite canonical to me (although see
Watson [19∞e]). I think the easiest way of getting a para-Lindel¨of space
which is not countably paracompact (at least consistently) is to iterate a nor-
mal para-Lindel¨of space which is not collectionwise normal in an ω-sequence
(see Watson [19∞c]) and solve problem 40. I tried to do this but got bowled
over by the details:
Problem 40. (Palermo #44) Is there a para-Lindel¨of Dowker space?
108. ?
Another question which has not really been looked at but which I think is
extremely important is:
Problem 41. (Palermo #42) Are para-Lindel¨of collectionwise normal spaces 109. ?
paracompact?
This was ﬁrst asked by Fleissner and Reed [1977]. So far, there are no
ideas at all on how to to approach this. Even the much weaker property of
meta-Lindel¨of creates big problems here:
Problem 42. (Palermo #58) Is it consistent that meta-Lindel¨of collection- 110. ?
wise normal spaces are paracompact?
In [1983] Rudin showed that under V = L, there is a screenable normal
space which is not paracompact.
This space is collectionwise normal and
meta-Lindel¨of reducing our search to a ZFC example (although to use such
a diﬃcult space to solve this question consistently seems overkill– but I don’t
know of a simpler one).
Problem 43.
(Palermo #46) Are para-Lindel¨of screenable normal spaces 111. ?
paracompact?
This question just throws in all the hardest properties and asks whether a
theorem pops out. I predict a ZFC example will not be seen in this century (at

54
Watson / Wishes
[ch. 4
least not from me). If para-Lindel¨of does indeed imply countably paracompact
then such an example does not exist in any case, since normal screenable
countably paracompact spaces are paracompact (Nagami [1955]).
Problem 44. (Palermo #45) Are para-Lindel¨of screenable spaces normal?
? 112.
There is an example of a screenable space which is not normal in Bing [1951]
but a lot of work has to be done to make it para-Lindel¨of.
Maybe that
is the place to start. Keep in mind that para-Lindel¨of spaces are strongly
collectiowise Hausdorﬀ(Fleissner and Reed [1977]).
8. Dowker Spaces
The next few questions are ZFC questions about Dowker spaces. It’s fairly
easy to come up with a question about Dowker spaces. Just ﬁnd a property
that Mary Ellen Rudin’s Dowker example in ZFC (Rudin [1971]) does not
have and ask if there is a Dowker space with that property. A lot can be
done in particular models of ZFC to obtain very nice, well-behaved examples
of Dowker spaces (see Rudin [1955], Juh´asz, Kunen and Rudin [1976], de
Caux [1976], Weiss [1981], Bell [1981] and Rudin [1984, 1983]) but, in
ZFC, there is only that one example around. I tried to construct another one
in 1982 but only succeeded in getting one from a compact cardinal (Wat-
son [19∞c]). On the one hand, this is worse than using CH or MA + ¬CH
but on the other hand, postulating the existence of a compact cardinal has
a diﬀerent ﬂavour than the other axioms. Anyway that example was scat-
tered of height ω and hereditarily normal thus giving rise to the next three
questions:
Problem 45. (Palermo #48) Does ZFC imply that there is a hereditarily
? 113.
normal Dowker space?
Problem 46.
(Palermo #55) Does ZFC imply that there is a σ-discrete
? 114.
Dowker space?
Problem 47.
(Palermo #54) Does ZFC imply that there is a scattered
? 115.
Dowker space?
The next two questions have been around for a while and rest on the follow-
ing pathological properties of Mary Ellen Rudin’s example (Rudin [1971]): It
has cardinality and character (ℵω)ω.
Problem 48. (Palermo #50) Does ZFC imply that there is a Dowker space

of cardinality less than ℵω?

Problem 49. (Palermo #51; Rudin [1971]) Does ZFC imply that there is a 117. ?
ﬁrst countable Dowker space?
Problem 50. (Rudin [1971]) Is there a separable Dowker space?
118. ?
In [1983], Rudin showed that under V = L, there is a screenable normal
space which is not paracompact. This space was quite diﬃcult to construct.
A ZFC example seems a long, long way oﬀ(although ♦has been known to
hold at large enough cardinals. On the other hand a consistent theorem would
ﬁnish oﬀthis nearly forty year old question implicit in Bing [1951]:
Problem 51.
(Palermo #49) Does ZFC imply that there is a screenable 119. ?
normal space which is not paracompact?
An even stronger property than screenable is that of having a σ-disjoint
base. It remains completely open whether a normal space with a σ-disjoint
base must be paracompact. The next question is conjectured to have a positive
answer. This would start to clear up the mystery surrounding screenability
and having a σ-disjoint base. A negative answer would require a good hard
study of Rudin’s space Rudin [1983] and that is worthwhile anyway.
Problem 52. (Palermo #52) Does ZFC imply that normal spaces with a 120. ?
σ-disjoint base are collectionwise normal (or paracompact)?
In reply to a question of Frank Tall, Rudin [1983] showed that the exis-
tence of a screenable normal non-paracompact space implies the existence of
a screenable normal non-collectionwise normal space. The next question asks
whether collectionwise normality really is quite irrelevant.
Problem 53. (Palermo #53) Does the existence of a screenable normal space 121. ?
which is not paracompact imply the existence of a screenable collectionwise
normal space which is not paracompact?
9. Extending Ideals
If I is an ideal on X then I measures A if and only if A is a subset of X and
either A ∈I or X −A ∈I. If an ideal I on X has the property that whenever
A is a family of κ many subsets of X there is a countably complete ideal which
extends I and which measures each of the elements of A, then we say that
the ideal I is κ-extendible. We say that an ideal I is κ-completable if there
is a proper ideal J which is κ-complete and which contains I. If an ideal I
on X has the property that whenever A is a family of κ many subsets of X
there is a countably complete ideal which extends I and which measures at
least λ many elements of A, then we say that the ideal I is (κ, λ)-extendible.

The idea of investigating these questions is due to Frank Tall whose interest
is responsible for all the questions in this section. In a paper with Stepr¯ans
(Stepr¯ans and Watson [1986]), we investigated many problems on the κ-
extendibility and the (κ, λ)-extendibility of ideals. Many of these questions
have remained open.
We showed in Stepr¯ans and Watson [1986] that if an ideal I is (κω)+-
completable then I is κ-extendible.
We showed that the converse is true
unless κ is greater or equal to either a weakly compact cardinal or something
called a Ξ-cardinal (in particular an ideal I is ω-extendible if and only if
I is (2ℵ0)+-completable). We also showed that, if there are no measurable
cardinals in an inner model and κ is not a Ξ-cardinal, then the κ-extendibility
of an ideal is directly dependent on the completability of the ideal. However,
if κ is a Ξ-cardinal and there are measurable cardinals in an inner model,
then the best we can say is that κ+-completable implies κ-extendible which
implies κ-completable.
We were able to show that adding ineﬀably-many
Cohen reals produced a model in which there is a κ-extendible ideal which
is not κ+-completable. Problem 54 tries to establish whether we can get a
cardinal (in a model which uses a large cardinal consistent with V = L) which
is not weakly compact but which acts like one with respect to extendibility.
Problem 55 asks whether we need an ineﬀable cardinal or could get away with
a weakly compact cardinal (which would be more satisfying).
Problem 54. Does the consistency of the existence of an ineﬀable cardinal
? 122.
imply the consistency of the existence of a cardinal κ which is not weakly
compact such that each κ-completable ideal is κ-extendible?
Problem 55.
Does the consistency of the existence of a weakly compact
? 123.
cardinal imply the consistency of the existence of a cardinal κ which is not
weakly compact and a κ-extendible ideal which is not κ+-completable?
The case of measurable cardinals is a bit diﬀerent. If κ is a measurable
cardinal then there is a κ+-extendible ideal which is not κ+-completable. If
κ is a compact cardinal then any κ-completable ideal is κ+-extendible. On
the other hand, if it is consistent that there is a supercompact cardinal, then
it is consistent that there is a cardinal κ which is not measurable and a κ-
completable ideal on κ which is κ+-extendible. Problem 56 asks whether a
supercompact cardinal is needed for the simplest κ-completable ideal.
Problem 56. Does the consistency of the existence of a measurable cardinal
? 124.
imply the consistency of the existence of a cardinal κ which is not measurable
and yet so that [κ]<κ is κ+-extendible?
The set theory involved in (κ, λ)-extendibility is even more interesting.

Extending Ideals
57
In [1978] Laver showed that if it is consistent that there is a huge cardinal
then it is consistent that GCH holds and [ω1]<ω1 is (ω2, ω2)-extendible. On
the other hand if ℵ3 Cohen subsets of ω1 are added to a model of GCH
then [ω1]<ω1 is (ω3, ω3)-extendible. This latter argument really needs ℵ3 thus
provoking problem 57.
Problem 57. Does the (ω2, ω2)-extendibility of [ω1]<ω1 imply the consistency 125. ?
of large cardinals?
Todorˇcevi´c has shown that [ω1]<ω1 is not (ω1, ω1)-extendible in ZFC. This
takes away any idea that a right-hand coordinate ℵ2 is any stronger than a
right-hand coordinate of ℵ1 thus giving rise to problem 58.
Problem 58.
Does the fact that [ω1]<ω1 is (ω2, ω1)-extendible imply that 126. ?
[ω1]<ω1 is (ω2, ω2)-extendible?
We know that [2ω1]<2ω1 is (µ, µ)-extendible whenever µ < 2ω1. On the other
hand, [2ω1]<2ω1 is not (2ω1, ω)-extendible whenever 2ω = 2ω1. This is not the
strongest conceivable negative consistency result thus raising problem 59.
Problem 59. Does ZFC imply that [2ω1]<2ω1 is (22ω1, ω) extendible?
127. ?
We showed that it is consistent with 2ω = ω1 and 2ω1 = ω2 that [2ω1]<2ω1 is
not (2ω1, 2ω1)-extendible. There is no reason to think that this is dependent
on a particular cardinal arithmetic which brings up problem 60.
Problem 60. Is it consistent with every cardinal arithmetic that [2ω1]<2ω1
128. ?
is not (2ω1, 2ω1)-extendible?
Problem 61 is an even broader question on which we have made no progress
at all. On the other hand, if it is consistent that there is a weakly compact
cardinal, then it is consistent that CH holds and that [2ω1]<2ω1 is (2ω1, 2ω1)-
extendible. It is not at all clear that a large cardinal is needed for this result
and that is problem 62.
Problem 61. Does ZFC imply that [κ]<κ is (2κ, 2κ)-extendible whenever 129. ?
2κ > 2ω1?
Problem 62. Does the consistency of the (2ω1, 2ω1)-extendibility of [2ω1]<2ω1
130. ?
imply the consistency of the existence of an inaccessible cardinal?

10. Homeomorphisms
In the 1895 volume of Mathematische Annalen, Georg Cantor wrote an arti-
cle Cantor [1895] in which a “back-and-forth” argument, which has become
standard (see, for example Eberhart [1977]), was used to show, among other
things, that, for any countable dense subsets A and B of the real line R, there
is a homeomorphism h: R →R which takes A onto B in a monotonic manner.
The study of the existence of homeomorphisms taking one countable dense
set to another was extended to more general spaces by Fort in [1962]. He
showed that the product of countably many manifolds with boundary (for ex-
ample, the Hilbert cube) admits such homeomorphisms. In 1972, the abstract
study was begun by Bennett [1972] who called such spaces “countable dense
homogeneous” or “CDH”.
Bennett asked a series of questions including: “Are CDH continua locally
connected?”. This question was answered by Fitzpatrick [1972] in the same
year who showed that CDH connected locally compact metric spaces are lo-
cally connected. Fitzpatrick has now asked the natural question:
Problem 63. Are CDH connected complete metric spaces locally connected?
? 131.
Ungar raised a new question in 1978: Is each open subspace of a CDH space
also a CDH space? He showed that the answer is yes for dense open subsets
of locally compact separable metric spaces with no ﬁnite cut-set. In [1954]
Ford deﬁned a space X to be strongly locally homogeneous if there is a base
of open sets U such that, for each x, y ∈U there is a homeomorphism of
X which takes x to y but is the identity outside U. In 1982, van Mill also
raised a question: Are connected CDH spaces strongly locally homogeneous?
In [19∞a] Fitzpatrick and Zhou answered these two questions negatively
for the class of Hausdorﬀspaces. Unfortunately, their spaces were not regular.
In Simon and Watson [19∞], Petr Simon and the author exhibit a com-
pletely regular CDH space which fails to be strongly locally homogeneous and
which contains an open subset which is not CDH. The construction uses the
classical tradition (see Stackel’s 1895 article Stackel [1895]) of constructing
smooth functions on R2 which take one countable dense set to another as
developed by Dobrowolski in [1976].
These examples still leave some natural questions:
Problem 64.
Is there a connected metric CDH space which has an open
? 132.
subspace which is not CDH? Is there a connected normal (compact) CDH
space which has an open subspace which is not CDH?
Fitzpatrick and Zhou [19∞b] have raised an interesting question which
nicely turns a strong property of our example against itself. The open subset
of that space is not homogeneous and so:

§10]
Homeomorphisms
59
Problem 65. Is there a connected CDH space with an open subset which is 133. ?
connected and homogeneous but not CDH?
Jan van Mill probably had in mind metric spaces (he does open the pa-
per with the comment that all spaces are separable metric) and so the next
problem is his:
Problem 66. Are connected CDH metrizable (or compact Hausdorﬀ) spaces 134. ?
strongly locally homogeneous?
In [1972] Bennett showed that strongly locally homogeneous locally com-
pact separable metric spaces are CDH. Bennett’s theorem proved to be in-
ﬂuential. In [1969] de Groot weakened locally compact to complete (see
proof on p.317 of Anderson, Curtis and van Mill [1982]).
In [1974]
Ravdin replaced strongly locally homogeneous by “locally homogeneous of
variable type” (which implies “representable” which is apparently weaker than
strongly locally homogeneous) for complete separable metric spaces. In [1974]
Fletcher and McCoy showed that “representable” complete separable met-
ric spaces are CDH while in [1976] Bales showed that “representable” is
equivalent to strongly locally homogeneous in any case.
In [1982] van Mill put an end to the sequence of weakenings of Bennett’s
theorem by constructing a subset of R2 which is connected locally connected
and strongly locally homogeneous but not CDH. In [19∞] Stepr¯ans and
Zhou contributed another lower bound by constructing a separable manifold
(thus strongly locally homogeneous and locally compact) which is not CDH.
Their manifold had weight 2ω and they asked whether it is consistent that
there is a separable manifold of weight less than the continuum which is not
CDH. In Watson [19∞d], we constructed a consistent example of a separable
manifold of weight less than the continuum which fails to be CDH. All of these
results leave:
Problem 67. Which cardinal invariant describes the minimum weight of a 135. ?
separable manifold which fails to be CDH?
The cardinal invariant which is the least cardinality of a dominating family
in ωω was shown by Stepr¯ans and Zhou to be a lower bound and I believe
that there is a nice answer to this question. I was unable to ﬁnd it myself
but think that a connection between these cardinal invariants and manifolds
would be quite interesting.
The next question uses the concept of n-homogeneity. A space X is said to
be n-homogeneous if for any two subsets {ai : i ≤n} and {bi : i ≤n} of X
there is a homeomorphism of X onto itself which takes each ai to bi. Thus
homogeneity is the same as 1-homogeneity.

[ch. 4
Problem 68. Are CDH connected spaces 2-homogeneous?
? 136.
In [1972] Bennett showed that CDH connected ﬁrst countable spaces
are homogeneous and asked “Are CDH continua n-homogeneous?”.
Un-
gar [1978] answered this question in 1978 by showing that, for compact
metric spaces, CDH is equivalent to n-homogeneous. Meanwhile, in [19∞]
Fitzpatrick and Lauer showed that the assumption of ﬁrst countability in
Bennett’s theorem was unnecessary.
In a paper with Stepr¯ans (Stepr¯ans and Watson [1987]), we investigated
the problem of when there is an autohomeomorphism of Euclidean space which
takes one uncountable dense set to another. A little thought makes it clear
that to have a chance of ﬁnding such a autohomeomorphism we need to try
to send one κ-dense set to another. A set A ⊂X is κ-dense if | A ∩V |= κ
for every non-empty open set V in X. We say that BA(X, κ) holds if, for
every two κ-dense subsets of X there is an autohomeomorphism H of X such
that H(A) = B.
The axiom BA(R, ℵ1) was shown to be consistent with
MA + ¬CH by Baumgartner in [1973] and then shown to be independent
of MA+¬CH by Abraham and Shelah in [1981]. We showed in Stepr¯ans
and Watson [1987] that MA + ¬CH implies that BA(Rn, κ) for each n >
1 and κ < 2ω.
This showed that R and Rn are diﬀerent insofar as these
autohomeomorphisms are concerned when n > 1 but leaves the question of
whether R2 is diﬀerent from R3 in this context.
Problem 69. Does BA(Rm, ℵ1) imply BA(Rn, ℵ1) when n and m are greater

than 1 and unequal?
We do think however that there is a positive answer for:
Problem 70. Does BA(R, ℵ1) imply BA(Rn, ℵ1)?
? 138.
There seems to be no apparent monotonicity on the second coordinate ei-
ther:
Problem 71. Does BA(Rn, κ) imply BA(Rn, λ) when κ ̸= λ?
? 139.
. . . and the best problem of all is Baumgartner’s:
Problem 72. Is BA(R, ℵ2) consistent?
? 140.
We actually obtained under MA + ¬CH a stronger result which we de-
note by BA+(Rn, κ) which states that if {Aα : α ∈κ} and {Bα : α ∈κ} are
families of disjoint countable dense subsets of Rn, then there is an autohomeo-
morphism H of Rn such that, for each α ∈κ, H(Aα) = Bα. The advantage of
this axiom is that at least it is monotonic in the second coordinate. However

Absoluteness

it is not clear that it is the same as the original question:
Problem 73. Does BA(Rn, κ) imply BA+(Rn, κ) when n ≥2?
141. ?
11. Absoluteness
In the summer of 1986, Alan Dow, Bill Weiss, Juris Stepr¯ans and I met for
a few weeks to discuss problems of absoluteness in topology. We compiled a
list of what we knew and what we did not know:
If one adds a Cohen subset of ω1, then the collectionwise normal space 2ω1
gets a closed copy of the Tychonoﬀplank and so becomes not normal.
If one forces with a Suslin tree, then one can embed the square of the
Alexandroﬀcompactiﬁcation of the discrete space of cardinality ℵ1 minus
the “corner point” in 2ω1, thus making that collectionwise normal space not
normal.
If adds a new subset of ω1 with ﬁnite conditions (that is, adds ℵ1 many
Cohen reals), then Bing’s space will cease to be normal.
Problem 74.
Can Cohen forcing make a collectionwise normal space not 142. ?
collectionwise normal? not normal?
Problem 75. Can one Cohen real kill normality?
143. ?
Problem 76. Is there, in ZFC, a countable chain condition partial order 144. ?
which kills collectionwise normality?
If you take (ω2 + 1) × (ω1 + 1) −{ω2, ω1} and then collapse ω2 into an
ordinal of cardinality ω1 and uncountable coﬁnality, it becomes collectionwise
normal.
If you take a (ω, b∗) gap and ﬁll it, you make a non-normal space into
one which is collectiowise normal. Cohen forcing does preserve non-normality
and non-collectionwise normality as demonstrated by Dow, Tall and Weiss
in [19∞].
Problem 77. Can countably-closed cardinal-preserving forcing make a non- 145. ?
normal space normal?
If you take the Alexandroﬀdouble of the reals but only use some of the
isolated points, then this space is metrizable if and only if the isolated points
are a relative Fσ. Thus countable chain condition forcing can make a non-
metrizable space into a metrizable space. If you take a non-normal ladder
system on a stationary costationary set and make it into a nonstationary set
by forcing a club, then you have taken a non-normal space and made it into
a metrizable space by a cardinal-preserving forcing.

Problem 80.
Can countably-closed forcing make a non-metrizable space
? 148.
metrizable?
Problem 81. Does countably-closed forcing preserve hereditary normality?
? 149.
We also looked at problems involving cardinal functions: If you take the
Alexandroﬀdouble with a Bernstein set of isolated points and make that set
into a relative Fσ by means of countable chain condition forcing then the
Lindel¨of number will have increased from ω up to 2ω.
On the other hand, an elementary submodel argument shows that the Lin-
del¨of number cannot increase up to (2ω)+ under countable chain condition
forcing.
The Lindel¨of number can however increase arbitrarily under countably
closed forcing– just add a Cohen subset of κ and look at 2κ.
Density (or Lindel¨of number) cannot be decreased under the covering lemma
but the topology on κ in which the bounded sets are the only proper closed
sets can be made separable by forcing κ to have coﬁnality ω and that forcing
is cardinal-preserving but denies the covering lemma.
Tightness can be increased by countable chain condition forcing from ω to
2ω but not past the continuum by using the quotient of ω1 many convergent
sequences.
Finally tightness can also be increased by countably-closed forcing by using
the binary ω1-tree and deﬁning a neighborhood to be the complement of
ﬁnitely-many branches.

12. Complementation
In 1936, Birkhoﬀpublished “On the Combination of Topologies” in Funda-
menta Mathematicae (Birkhoff [1936]). In this paper, he ordered the family
of all topologies on a set by letting τ1 < τ2 if and only if τ1 ⊂τ2. He noted
that the family of all topologies on a set is a lattice. That is to say, for any
two topologies τ and σ on a set, there is a topology τ ∧σ which is the greatest
topology contained in both τ and σ (actually τ ∧σ = τ ∩σ) and there is a
topology τ ∨σ which is the least topology which contains both τ and σ. This
lattice has a greatest element, the discrete topology and a smallest element,
the indiscrete topology whose open sets are just the null set and the whole
set. In fact, the lattice of all topologies on a set is a complete lattice; that
is to say there is a greatest topology contained in each element of a family
of topologies and there is a least topology which contains each element of a
family of topologies.
The study of this lattice ought to be a basic pursuit both in combinatorial
set theory and in general topology.
This section is concerned with the nature of complementation in this lattice.
We say that topologies τ and σ are complementary if and only if τ ∧σ = 0 and
τ ∨σ = 1. For simplicity, we call any topology other than the discrete and the
indiscrete a proper topology (both the discrete topology and the indiscrete
topology are uniquely complemented). As a result in ﬁnite combinatorics,
Juris Hartmanis showed, in [1958], that the lattice of all topologies on a
ﬁnite set is complemented. He also asked whether the lattice of all topologies
on an inﬁnite set is complemented. He showed that, in fact, there are at least
two complements for any proper topology on a set of size at least 3.
The next series of results were obtained by Manuel Berri [1966], Haim
Gaifman and Anne Steiner.
Gaifman [1961] brought some startling new
methods to play that foreshadowed some of the arguments of Hajnal and
Juhasz in their work on L-spaces and S-spaces (Hajnal and Juh´asz [1968,
1969]) and showed in 1961 that the lattice of all topologies on a countable
set is complemented. In fact, Gaifman showed that any proper topology on a
countable set has at least two complements. In [1966] Steiner used a careful
analysis of Gaifman’s argument to show that the lattice of all topologies on any
set is complemented. A slightly modiﬁed proof of Steiner’s result was given by

64
Watson / Wishes
[ch. 4
van Rooij in [1968]. The question of the number of distinct complements a
topology on a set must possess was ﬁrst raised by Berri [1966] before Steiner’s
theorem was obtained. He asked if every complemented proper topology on
an inﬁnite set must have at least two complements. Schnare [1968] showed
that any proper topology (even not T0) on a inﬁnite set has indeed inﬁnitely
many complements (see also Dacic [1969]).
The last paper on this subject appeared in 1969 and was written by Paul
Schnare as well (Schnare [1969]). In this paper, Schnare showed that any
proper topology on an inﬁnite set of cardinality κ has at least κ distinct com-
plements. He also pointed out that there are at most 22κ many complements
on a set of cardinality κ. By exhibiting examples of topologies on a set of car-
dinality κ which possess exactly κ complements, exactly 2κ complements and
exactly 22κ complements, Schnare showed under the generalized continuum
hypothesis that three values are possible for the number of complements of a
topology on an inﬁnite set and that these three values are attained.
In 1989, I obtained some results in Watson [1989] which solved the prob-
lem of establishing the exact number of complements of a topology on a ﬁxed
set of cardinality ℵn by showing that there are exactly 2n + 4 possible values
(although, depending on the cardinal arithmetic, some of these may coin-
cide). This removed the assumption of the generalized continuum hypothesis
in Schnare’s theorem in the countable case and showed that some assumption
of cardinal arithmetic is needed in all other cases. To be exact, the number
of distinct complements of any topology on a set of cardinality ℵn is either
1 or ℵκ
n where 0 < κ ≤ℵn or 2ℵn+2ωi where 0 ≤i ≤n. In particular, on a
countable set, exactly four values are possible: 1 or ℵ0 or 2ℵ0 or 22ω.
However, this still leaves open the original 1966 question of Berri:
Problem 88.
(Berri, rephrased in light of new results) Let κ be a ﬁxed
? 156.
cardinal. What is the set of possible numbers of complements of topologies
on a set of cardinality κ?
To make a speciﬁc conjecture:
Problem 89. Is the set of possible numbers of complements of topologies on
? 157.
a set of cardinality κ precisely:
{1} ∪{(sup{22α : α < λ})κ : λ ≤κ} ∪{κλ : λ ≤κ}?
A special case of this question is:
Problem 90. Can the number of complements of a topology on ℵω be at
? 158.
least (2ℵω)+ + sup{22κ : κ < ℵω} and yet equal to neither 22ωω nor (sup{22κ :
κ < ℵω})ω?

§12]
Complementation
65
Some insight into this question may be gained by pointing out that all
topologies on a set of cardinality κ, except for some simple and easy to describe
ones, have at least 2κ many complements. The interested reader may ﬁnd a
proof of this non-trivial fact in Watson [1989].
An additional piece of the puzzle may be provided by the fact that if κ is a
regular cardinal and X is a topological space of cardinality at least κ which
does not have 22κ many complements, then, in every complement, either
each point has a neighborhood of cardinality less than κ or the number of
complements is exactly λµ for some cardinals λ and µ.
I think that an answer to this question is going to involve a mixture of
set-theoretic topology and ﬁnite combinatorics. I worked on this question for
quite a while and just ran out of steam when I got to the singular cardinals.
Although questions 89 and 90 may seem a little technical, all they really ask
is “Is the answer to question 88 a deﬁnable set?”.
Other interesting questions on the number of complements deal with the
concept of a T1-complement. This is the appropriate notion for T1 spaces
where the 0 in the lattice is just the coﬁnite topology:
Problem 91.
How many T1-complements can a T1 topology on a set of 159. ?
cardinality κ have?
In [1967], Steiner and Steiner showed that of any pair of T1-complements
on a countable set, at least one is not Hausdorﬀ. In [1969], Anderson and
Stewart showed that of any pair of T1-complements, at least one is not
ﬁrst countable Hausdorﬀ. Anderson and Stewart also asked: Can a Hausdorﬀ
topology on an uncountable set have a HausdorﬀT1-complement? We showed
in Watson [19∞b] that there is a completely regular topology on a set of
cardinality (2ω)+ which is its own complement.
Problem 92.
It is consistent that any Hausdorﬀtopology which is its own 160. ?
T1 complement must lie on a set of cardinality at least (2ω)+?
A few months after we lectured on this result in Srn´ı in January 1989,
Aniszczyk constructed two T1-complementary compact Hausdorﬀspaces.
Problem 93.
Can two homeomorphic compact Hausdorﬀspaces be T1- 161. ?
complementary ?
Problem 94. Does every Hausdorﬀtopology have a T1-complement? What 162. ?
about every completely regular topology?
Other information on this topic can be found in Steiner and Steiner
[1968] and Anderson [1970].

[ch. 4
In the notation of Birkhoff [1967], the maximum number of mutually T1-
complementary topologies on a set of cardinality κ is the complementary width
of the lattice of T1 topological spaces on a set. In [1971] Anderson showed by
a beautiful construction that there are at least κ mutually (T1) complementary
topologies on a set of cardinality κ. In Stepr¯ans and Watson [19∞], we
showed that there do not exist uncountably many mutually T1-complementary
topologies on ω. It was also shown that it is consistent that there do not exist
ℵ2 many mutually T1-complementary topologies on ω1. On the other hand, it
was shown that, under CH, there are 2ℵ1-many mutually T1-complementary
topologies on ω1.
Problem 95.
Does there exist, in ZFC, a cardinal κ so that there are 2κ
? 163.
(or κ+) many mutually T1-complementary topologies on κ? What about if
κ = 2ω?
The general problem remains:
Problem 96. How many mutually T1-complementary topologies are there
? 164.
on a set of cardinality κ?
I think problems 95 and 96 are extremely interesting and believe that a
solution will require a potent mixture of ﬁnite combinatorics and set-theoretic
virtuosity.
Problem 97. Is there a triple of mutually complementary topologies which
? 165.
does not admit a fourth topology complementary to each of them ? What are
the sizes of maximal families of mutually complementary topologies?
Problem 98. Is there a set of inﬁnitely many but fewer than κ many mutually
? 166.
complementary topologies on a set of cardinality κ which does not admit
another mutually complementary topology?
In forthcoming papers with Jason Brown (Brown and Watson [19∞,
1989b, 1989a]) we study topologies on a ﬁnite set. These are identical with
preorders on a ﬁnite set (T0 topologies are identical with partial orders on a
ﬁnite set) and are thus of substantial interest to ﬁnite combinatorists. My
interest in the subject originates in the fact that the somewhat diﬃcult con-
struction of Watson [19∞b] can be viewed as a preimage of a non-trivial
topology on 18 elements. Many questions in this area have remained immune
to our eﬀorts. I mention only a few:
Problem 99. Which topology on a set of size n has the largest number of

We know which topology (other than the discrete or indiscrete) has the
least number of complements but we do not know which T0 topology (i.e.,
partial order) has the least number of complements.
Problem 100. What is the maximum number of pairwise complementary 168. ?
T0 topologies on a set of size n ?
Speciﬁcally, we know that the answer to this question lies asymptotically
between
n
100 log n and 0.486n but do not know whether there is a linear lower
bound. See also Anderson’s beautiful paper Anderson [1973].
Problem 101.
If G is the graph on the set of topologies on the integers 169. ?
formed by putting an edge between two topologies if and only if they are
complementary, then does G contain a copy of each countable graph ?
Problem 102. What is the diameter of the graph G?
170. ?
We know that the answer is either 6 or 7.
We say that a topology is “self-complementary” if some complement of that
topology is homeomorphic to the original topology.
Problem 103.
(Jason Brown) Characterize the self-complementary ﬁnite 171. ?
topologies.
We have established a characterization of the self-complementary ﬁnite T0
topologies (i.e., the self-complementary ﬁnite partial orders) and the ﬁnite
equivalence relations (viewed as preorders).
Problem 104.
Can every lattice with 1 and 0 be homomorphically embed- 172. ?
ded in the lattice of topologies on some set?
Problem 104 is the most important question in this section. I guess that the
answer is yes but I have no idea how to prove this. Note that the image of the
meet of two elements must be the topological meet of the images of the two
elements, the image of the join of two elements must be the topological join of
the images of the two elements and that, furthermore, the image of 0 must be
the indiscrete topology and the image of 1 must be the discrete topology. It is
this last requirement which is so diﬃcult. Embedding the inﬁnite lattice all of
whose elements except 0 and 1 are incomparable means producing an inﬁnite
mutually complementary family of topologies and there are only a few ways
of doing that— the intricate construction of Bruce Anderson [1971] and
the methods of Stepr¯ans and Watson [19∞]. Modifying those arguments
will not be easy.

13. Other Problems
Problem 105.
Give a topological proof of the fact that any connected
? 173.
metrizable manifold is the countable increasing union of compact connected
manifolds.
A few years ago, Raj Prasad asked me whether there was an elementary
proof of this fact, since he had needed it and had to resort to quoting fairly
deep results in low-dimensional topology to prove it. I came up with a proof
which had a hole in it and then another . . . . I still don’t know why this fact
is true. By the way, the manifold may have boundary but I can’t see why this
makes the problem any harder.
Problem 106.
Are there, under CH or otherwise, sets LARGE, SMALL
? 174.
⊂[ω1]ω such that
(i) If A is large and B is small, then there is a small inﬁnite C such that
C ⊂A −B,
(ii) If each An is small then there are ﬁnite sets Fn such that ∪{An −Fn :
n ∈ω} is small,
(iii) If A is uncountable then there is a large B ⊂A,
(iv) If A is small and B ⊂A then B is small.
I like this problem a lot. Under ♦, the answer is yes (see Ostaszewski
[1976]). Deeper is the fact that under the existence of a Suslin line, the answer
is yes (see Rudin [1972], although it’s hidden a little). I managed to get a few
set theorists interested in this question, two of whom promptly announced
that the answer is no under PFA. They both later withdrew this claim. The
reason I was looking at this in the ﬁrst place is slightly less interesting than
the sheer combinatorics. Kunen’s line (Juh´asz, Kunen and Rudin [1976])
had one advantage over Ostaszewski’s line: it could be done under CH. The
disadvantage is that it wasn’t countably compact and worse yet it didn’t have
that beautiful property that closed sets are either countable or cocountable.
If the answer to the above question is yes under CH then Ostaszewski’s
construction can be done under CH. To get a feel for the question take a
P-point ultraﬁlter on each element of a ♣-sequence.
Problem 107. Is there, in ZFC, a linear ordering in which every disjoint
? 175.
family of open sets is the union of countably many discrete subfamilies and
yet in which there is no dense set which is the union of countably many closed
discrete sets? Is there such a linear ordering if and only if there is a Suslin
line?
The Urysohn metrization theorem is to the Nagata-Smirnov-Stone metriza-
tion theorem as the Suslin problem is to this problem. It is incredible that

such a basic question about linear orderings is unsolved (and yet well-known
in various disguises).
Problem 108. Is there a topological space (or a completely regular space) in 176. ?
which the connected sets (with more than one point) are precisely the coﬁnite
sets?
This question was created while looking at an interesting paper of Tsvid
[1978]. He was asking simply whether (in a countable connected Hausdorﬀ
space) the connected sets could be a ﬁlter. That also remains unknown. I
hawked this question at the 1989 Spring Topology Conference at Tennessee
State University, asking for either a topological example (not necessarily even
T0) or on the other hand a proof that one couldn’t ﬁnd such a subset of the
plane. John Kulesza at George Mason University sent a proof to me a few
weeks later that there are no examples which are hereditarily normal Fr´echet
spaces. Later B. D. Garrett discovered a proof in Erd˝os [1944] (which Erd˝os
attributes to Arthur Stone) of the fact that there are no metrizable examples
(Kulesza rediscovered the same proof). I conjecture that there is an example
(probably even completely regular) and that the existence of such an example
depends on some hard ﬁnite combinatorics.

What constitutes a good mathematical problem? This is a diﬃcult question
for mathematicians—we are more capable of solving problems than evaluating
them. However for me, there is a sense in which every mathematical problem
is a good one. If you would ever hear me say “I don’t want to know the
answer to that question”, you would hear me wishing to be ignorant—and
likely succeeding!
However, this is not to say that I ﬁnd some problems better than others,
and certainly I don’t have time to work on all problems; so I have given some
thought to what constitutes a “better” problem, and I have obtained a list
of criteria, admittedly subjective and perhaps incomplete. It is just a list
of four attributes, such that if any mathematical problem has one of them,
then I really like it. First, I like a problem in which the solution will give
information about our basic objects of study—the unit interval, [0, 1], powers
of the two-point discrete space, the ordinals, βN, the irrationals and a few
other natural variations. Just as I wish to know all the topological properties
about some topological spaces, I want to know all the topological spaces which
possess some basic topological properties. So, second, I like a problem which
develops the theory by shedding light among cardinal invariants and other
basic topological properties. Third, I like a problem for which the solution
would give theorems analogous to existing important theorems. The hope is
that these results would someday be almost as useful as the originals. Fourth,
and most subjective of all, I like a problem which is simply nice—elementary
and easy to state, and intriguing.
With this in mind, here is my list of some problems that I would like to
solve. And I admit it—I have worked unsuccessfully on each of them.
A. Problems about Basic Spaces
A topological space X is said to have the Blumberg property whenever for
each function f: X →R there is a dense set Df such that f|Df is continu-
ous. H. Blumberg [1922] proved that every compact metrizable space has
the Blumberg property; however, not every compact Hausdorﬀspace has it
(Weiss [1977]). βN has it, but it is independent whether βN \ N has it. The
following are still wide open.
Question A1. For κ ≥ℵ1 does [0, 1]κ have the Blumberg property?
177. ?
Question A2. For κ ≥ℵ1 does {0, 1}κ have the Blumberg property?
178. ?
A topological space X is said to have the CIP, complete invariance prop-
erty, whenever for each closed subset Y of X there is a continuous fY : X →X
such that Y = {x ∈X : f(x) = x}. Not every compact metrizable space has
the CIP, but [0, 1]κ does, for κ < ℵ1 (Ward [1973]). For other κ, I do not
know.

Question A3. For which κ does [0, 1]κ have the CIP?
? 179.
Now {0, 1}κ does have the CIP for each κ, as does Rκ. However the CIP
behaves strangely, for example (βN)c has it, whereas βN does not (Martin
and Weiss [1984]).
B. Problems about Cardinal Invariants
The next problem was originally formulated by E. K. van Douwen.
It is
obvious that a compact space is globally small if it is locally small. However,
Question B1. Is there a bound on the size of countably compact, locally
? 180.
countable regular spaces?
In fact there are countably compact, locally countable regular spaces of
size ℵn for each positive integer n, Juh´asz, Nagy and Weiss [1979], and
assuming V = L there are such spaces of arbitrarily large size. Not much
more is known; however it still may be reasonable to extend the problem.
Question B2. Let X be a regular space and let λ be the least cardinal such
? 181.
that some open cover of size λ has no ﬁnite subcover and let κ be the least
cardinal such that every point has a neighbourhood of size < κ. How are λ, κ
and |X| related?
For a space X, let us consider the least cardinal κ such that any collection
U of fewer than κ open subsets of X has a nowhere dense choice function, i.e.,
F: U →X such that F(U) ∈U and the set {F(U) : U ∈U} is nowhere dense.
This κ is actually πd(X), which is deﬁned as the minimum of: {|B| : B is a
family of non-empty open sets and every dense open set contains an element
of B}. Also, π0(X) is deﬁned as the minimum of {π(U) : U is a non-empty
open subset of X}. We always have
πd(X) ≤π0(X) ≤2πd(X).
The question of M. van de Vel and E. K. van Douwen can now be stated.
Question B3. Is there a regular space X such that πd(X) < π0(X)?
? 182.
The answer is consistently yes. However (Juh´asz and Weiss [1986]), any
such X cannot be compact and πd(X) must be uncountable. If MA is as-
sumed, X cannot be separable.
Question B4. What is the relationship between the height and the width of
? 183.
a compact Hausdorﬀscattered space?

§C]
Problems about Partitions
81
Each scattered space X decomposes into a Cantor-Bendixson hierarchy
{Iα : α < β} in which Iα is the non-empty set of isolated points of X −{Iγ :
γ < α} and X = {Iα : α < β}. The ordinal β is called the height of X
and sup{|Iα| : α < β} is called the width of X. R. Telg´arsky originally asked
about compact scattered spaces of countable width. There are such spaces
of height β for each β < ω2, but whether or not there exists one of height
larger than or equal to ω2 is independent (Juh´asz and Weiss [1978], Baum-
gartner and Shelah [1987], Just [1985]). However, the following problem
is not completely solved.
Question B5. Does each compact Hausdorﬀspace of countable width have 184. ?
height less than ω3?
There are many omitting cardinals problems and no doubt they will be
discussed somewhere in this volume. A related problem, due to A. Hajnal
and I. Juh´asz (Rudin [1975]) follows.
Question B6.
Does each Lindel¨of regular space of cardinality ℵ2 have a 185. ?
Lindel¨of subspace of cardinality ℵ1?
Now, one might think that ℵ1 and ℵ2 are artiﬁcial here and should really
be replaced by 2ℵ0 and 22ℵ0 . However, if this is done, then the answer is
no—at least consistently, but as far as I know, not consistently with GCH,
see Juh´asz and Weiss [1989]. I think the problem is best left as stated.
C. Problems about Partitions
Two of the earliest and nicest theorems of general topology are due to F. Bern-
stein and R. Baire. Any separable metric space X can be partitioned into two
pieces such that no piece contains an uncountable closed subset of X. If any
complete metric space space X is partitioned into countably many pieces,
then one piece contains a subset dense in some open set of X. I would like
to consider a class of problems analogous to these theorems, in which the
sets to be avoided or captured by the partition are not deﬁned relative to the
whole space X, but are those subsets of X which are homeomorphic to some
prearranged space Y .
The basic relation to be studied can be written as X →(Y )1
ω which means
that whenever X is partitioned in countably many pieces, there is one piece
which contains a subset homeomorphic to Y . An oblique line through the
arrow will denote the negation of the relation.
Question C1.
Does each regular space X have the property that X ̸→186. ?
({0, 1}ω)1
ω?

82
Weiss / Weiss’s Questions
[ch. 5
Here {0, 1}ω is the usual Cantor set. Such partitions have been found for
all X of cardinality κ for which {λ : λ is a cardinal and c < λ < κ} is ﬁnite
(Weiss [1990]) and consistently for any regular space. Also, not much more
than this is known about the following restricted version.
Question C2.
Does every metrizable space X have the property X ̸→
? 187.
({0, 1}ω)1
ω?
On the other hand, there is the following general problem.
Question C3.
Which regular Y have the property that for some class of
? 188.
regular spaces C, X →(Y )1
ω for all X ∈C?
It is known that if the metrizable space X is not σ-discrete, and top α
denotes the ordinal α with the usual topology, then X →(top α)1
ω for all
countable α (Komj´ath and Weiss [1987]). However the following is open.
Question C4. Is it true that for all (countable) regular spaces Y , there is
? 189.
some regular space X such that X →(Y )ω
1 ?
As a particularly interesting case of this we have
Question C5. Is there a regular space X such that X →(top ω1)1
ω?
? 190.
The diamond principle implies that |X| > ℵ1 (Komj´ath and Weiss [1987]),
but this may be true without that assumption. Furthermore it is independent
whether X can be top ω1 (Silver, Shelah) or {0, 1}ω1 (Stepr¯ans, Shelah).
We now introduce the notation, as in Ramsey theory,
X →(Y )n
ω
for topological spaces X and Y and positive integer n to mean that whenever
the n element subsets of X, [X]n are partitioned into countably many pieces,
there is H ⊆X homeomorphic to Y such that [H]n is a subset of one piece
of the partition.
Question C6.
Is there a regular space X such that X →(top ω + 1)2
ω?
? 191.
There is no such X of size ≤ℵω, and consistently there is no such X (Haj-
nal, Juh´asz and Weiss [19∞]). Here is an inﬁnite schema of problems—one
for each positive integer n.
Question C7. Do there exist regular non-discrete spaces Xn and Yn such
? 192.
that Xn →(Yn)n
ω?

References
83
It is known that the answer is yes for n = 1 or n = 2 and that any possible Y3
must be countable (Hajnal, Juh´asz and Weiss [19∞]). Furthermore the
answer is consistently no for all n ≥4.
A negative answer to one of the
previous problems would generate the following question.
Question C8. What is the least positive integer n (if any exists) such that 193. ?
for all regular X there is a partition of [X]n into countably many pieces, such
that if [H]n is contained in only one piece of the partition, then H is a discrete
subspace of X?
This would mean that partitioning the n-element subsets of X “destroys”
all the topological properties of X. We know from above that n > 2; and it
is consistent that n = 4 (Juh´asz and Shelah [19∞], Weiss [19∞]).
There are more problems of this type—for example into a diﬀerent number
of pieces, or partitioning a basic topological space, etc.; see Weiss [1990].

1. Some Strange Questions
We discuss a circle of questions related to:
Question 1.1.
Is there in ZFC, an uncountable space1 which does not 194. ?
contain a copy of one of the following:
(i) an uncountable discrete space;
(ii) an uncountable subspace of the reals;
(iii) an uncountable subspace of the Sorgenfrey line?
(Recall that the Sorgenfrey line is the real line with the right half-open interval
topology.)
Let (α) be the statement that every uncountable space does contain one of
(i)–(iii). We will see in later sections that the question of the consistency of (α)
could be what lies at the heart of several longstanding problems concerning
the structure of perfectly normal compacta, and problems concerning the
characterization of continuous images of separable metric spaces. It is also
closely related to some Ramsey-type theorems for topological spaces.
There are consistent counterexamples to (α).
Indeed, hereditarily sepa-
rable non-Lindel¨of spaces (S-spaces) and hereditarily Lindel¨of non-separable
spaces (L-spaces), which exist assuming the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) or
other special axioms of set-theory (see, e.g., Roitman [1984] or Todorˇcevi´c
[1988]), contain counterexamples. For instance, if X is an S-space, then there
is a “right-separated” subspace Y = {yα}α<ω1 ⊆X; i.e., yα ̸∈{yβ: β > α} for
each α < ω1. No uncountable subspace of Y is Lindel¨of so Y cannot contain
copies of uncountable subspaces of the real line or Sorgenfrey line, and of
course Y contains no uncountable discrete subspace. S. Todorˇcevi´c [1983]
showed S-spaces cannot be constructed in ZFC. Indeed the Proper Forcing
Axiom (PFA), a strengthening of “Martin’s Axiom for ω1 many dense sets”
(MAω1) implies that there are no S-spaces. The consistency of no L-spaces
is still not known, but a relevant partial result is that under MA + ¬CH,
there are no ﬁrst countable L-spaces (Szentmikl´ossy [1978]).
A space X satisﬁes the countable chain condition (ccc) if every collection
of pairwise-disjoint non-empty open subsets of X is countable. A subset A of
X is discrete if the subspace topology on A is the discrete topology. Note that
X is hereditarily ccc (i.e., every subspace is ccc) if and only if X contains no
uncountable discrete subspace. So (α) can be restated as: “Every uncountable
hereditarily ccc space contains a copy of an uncountable subspace of the real
line or an uncountable subspace of the Sorgenfrey line”.
Now every hereditarily ccc space either contains an S-space or an L-
space, or is both hereditarily separable and hereditarily Lindel¨of (see Roit-
man [1984]). So it seems likely that any ZFC counterexample to (α) will be
1All spaces are assumed to be regular and T1.
87

Gruenhage / Perfectly normal compacta
[ch. 6
hereditarily separable and hereditarily Lindel¨of; certainly any ﬁrst countable
one will.
Note that each of the spaces (i)–(iii) in Question 1.1 is suborderable. (Recall
that suborderable spaces are precisely the subspaces of linearly ordered spaces;
or equivalently there is a linear ordering of the space such that each point has
a base of open or half-open intervals, or is isolated.) Consider the following
statement:
(β) Every uncountable space contains an uncountable suborderable
subspace.
Assuming MAω1, (β) is equivalent to (α); this is because MAω1 destroys
essentially the only counterexample to (β), namely, a left-separated subspace
of a Souslin line.
Another property that the three classes of spaces mentioned in Question
1.1 have in common is that they have a weaker metrizable topology; that is,
they are submetrizable. Even the consistency of the following statement is
unknown:
(γ) Every uncountable space contains an uncountable submetrizable
subspace.
M. Brod [19∞] shows that X is a counterexample to (γ) if and only if
f(X) is countable whenever f: X →R is continuous. She also observes that
Ostaszewski’s [1976] space, constructed using axiom ♦(a consequence of
V = L stronger that CH), is a counterexample, and Roitman has observed
that any Souslin line contains a counterexample. Any counterexample to (γ)
is of course a counterexample to (α) too; on the other hand, the author showed
(Gruenhage [1989]) that if there is a counterexample to (α), then assuming
MAω1, there is a submetrizable one.
The spaces (i)–(iii) have a property somewhat stronger than submetrizabil-
ity. A space is cometrizable if there is a weaker metric topology such that each
point has a neighborhood base consisting of sets closed in the metric topology.
The Sorgenfrey line, for example, is cometrizable with respect to the usual Eu-
clidean topology: {[a, x): x > a} is a neighborhood base at a. Cometrizability
is topologically interesting because most spaces in the literature obtained by
modifying the topology of some metric space are cometrizable; it’s a conve-
nient way of ensuring that the resulting space is regular. It’s also interesting
for us because we can answer our question for this class of spaces: assuming
PFA, every cometrizable space contains either an uncountable discrete space,
or a copy of an uncountable subspace of the real line or the Sorgenfrey line.
Thus PFA implies that the following statement (δ), which looks like a minor
strengthening of (γ), is equivalent to (α):

§2]
Perfectly Normal Compacta
89
(δ) Every uncountable space contains an uncountable cometrizable
subspace.
The cometrizable assumption helps in the proof of (α) because it allows one
to apply certain partition theorems for sets of reals - more on this in §3.
While the existence of S-spaces or L-spaces give counterexamples to (α),
and can be useful in ﬁnding counterexamples to (β) - (δ), the consistency of
these statements is unknown even under assumptions that preclude the exis-
tence of S-spaces or L-spaces. For example, add a ﬁrst-countability assump-
tion; then under PFA, every counterexample must be hereditarily separable
and hereditarily Lindel¨of. Or just consider the statements (α)–(δ) restricted
to spaces which are both hereditarily separable and hereditarily Lindel¨of; we
still have no answers.
In the following two sections, we will see more of the motivation behind
these questions (especially 1.1), and we will also see that consistency proofs
even for the restricted classes of spaces just mentioned above would have
interesting applications.
2. Perfectly Normal Compacta
There is a wide variety of non-metrizable perfectly normal compact spaces,
if one is willing to assume axioms of set-theory beyond ZFC. A Souslin line
compactiﬁed by including ﬁrst and last points is an example; many other ex-
amples can be constructed with the help of the CH (see, e.g., Burke and
Davis [1981] and Filippov [1969]). But essentially the only known example
in ZFC is Alexandrov’s “double arrow” space D = [0, 1] × 2 with the lexi-
cographic order topology2. Maybe D really is in some sense the only ZFC
example. The fundamental problem is: Can one make a precise formulation
of this and prove it?
An early attempt at this was due to D.H. Fremlin,
who asked: “Is it consistent that every compact perfectly normal space is
a continuous image of D × [0, 1]?”. This was answered in the negative by
W.S. Watson and W.A.R. Weiss [1988]. However, their counterexample
contains a copy of D; in fact, it’s D together with countably many isolated
points added in a certain way. Also, like D, it admits a ≤2 −to −1 map
onto a compact metric space. This led Fremlin to pose the following question,
which is still unsolved:
Question 2.1. Is it consistent that every perfectly normal compact space 195. ?
admits a ≤2 −to −1 map onto a compact metric space?
2This space is also called the “split interval”, because one can imagine obtaining it by
splitting each x ∈[0, 1] into two points x0 and x1, and giving it the order topology, where
xi < yj if x < y or if x = y and i < j.

90
Gruenhage / Perfectly normal compacta
[ch. 6
The connection isn’t immediately evident, but this is closely related to state-
ment (α) of the previous section. Using the fact that (α) holds for cometrizable
spaces, Fremlin [1984] obtained the following partial result: assuming PFA,
every perfectly normal compact space X admits a map f from X onto a com-
pact metric space M such that the set {x ∈M: |f −1(x)| ≥3} is ﬁrst-category
in M. Indeed, combining the main idea in Fremlin’s proof with some ideas
in Gruenhage [1988] shows that the statement of Question 2.1 is equiva-
lent, under PFA, to “(α) holds for subspaces of perfectly normal compacta”.
Another form of the fundamental problem is:
Question 2.2. Is it consistent that every non-metrizable perfectly normal
? 196.
compact space contains a copy of A×2 with the lexicographic order topology
for some uncountable A ⊆[0, 1]?
Note that it wouldn’t make sense to ask for containement of all of D:
if A ⊆[0, 1] is uncountable, then the quotient space D(A) of D obtained by
identifying (x, 0) and (x, 1) for x ̸∈A is still a non-metrizable perfectly normal
compactum.
In Gruenhage [1988] it is shown that if (α) holds for subspaces of perfectly
normal compacta, then under PFA, the answer to Question 2.2 is “yes”. So
it is also the case that a positive answer to 2.1 implies, under PFA, a positive
answer to 2.2. I don’t know if 2.1 and 2.2 are equivalent. Todorˇcevi´c observed
that a positive answer to 2.2 follows from (α) alone, because (α) implies the
consequence of PFA used in Gruenhage [1988], namely that every function
from an uncountable subset of R to R has a monotone restriction to some
uncountable subset of its domain.
It is easier to see how (α) gets involved in 2.2 than 2.1. Note that the
subspaces A × {0} and A × {1} of A × 2 are homeomorphic to subspaces of
the Sorgenfrey line. One can show by an inductive construction that a non-
metrizable perfectly normal compact space contains an uncountable subspace
Y such that Y contains no uncountable metrizable subspace. So if (α) holds,
Y must contain an uncountable Sorgenfrey subspace. See Gruenhage [1988]
to see how to push this to get a copy of some A × 2.
There are some more speciﬁc questions about perfectly normal compacta
that stem from the same fundamental problem of our lack of ZFC examples.
Question 2.3. Is it consistent that every perfectly normal locally connected
? 197.
compact space is metrizable?
This question is due to M.E. Rudin [1982]; its motivation comes from
a line of results that begin with her solution to a problem of Alexandrov:
Is every perfectly normal manifold (= Hausdorﬀand locally Rn for some n)
metrizable? Rudin and Zenor [1976] constructed a counterexample assuming
CH. A little later, Rudin showed that under MA + ¬CH, the answer to

§3]
Cosmic Spaces and Coloring Axioms
91
Alexandrov’s question is “yes”. D. Lane [1980] extended this to show that,
under MA+¬CH, every perfectly normal locally connected, locally compact
space is paracompact. It’s still a question whether or not “paracompact” can
be replaced by “metrizable” in Lane’s theorem. Since paracompact spaces are
metrizable iﬀthey are locally metrizable, this boils down to Question 2.3.
A compact Souslin line is a counterexample to 2.3, and others have been
constructed assuming CH (e.g. Filippov [1969], Burke and Davis [1981]).
In Gruenhage [1988], we showed that if (α) holds (for subspaces of perfectly
normal compacta), then the answer to 2.3 is “yes”.
The following question appears in Przymusi´nski [1984]:
Question 2.4. If X and Y are compact and X × Y is perfectly normaal, 198. ?
must one of X and Y be metrizable?
If X is perfectly normal and compact, and Y is compact metric, then it is
easily shown that X × Y is perfectly normal; so the question is whether this
is the only way a product of two compact spaces can be perfectly normal.
Rudin [1979] showed that, assuming axiom ♦, there are two Souslin lines
whose product is perfectly normal.
Todorˇcevi´c [1986] showed that if A
and B are disjoint subsets of [0, 1] such that there does not exist a one-to-one
monotone function from any uncountable subset of A to B, then D(A)×D(B)
is perfectly normal. The existence of such sets A and B is implied by CH,
and is consistent with MA + ¬CH. It’s not consisitent with PFA, so it’s
possible PFA could imply a positive answer to 2.4.
As mentioned earlier, Todorˇcevi´c observed that (α) implies every uncount-
able function from R to R contains an uncountale monotone subfunction; it’s
not diﬃcult to deduce from this that (α) implies a positive answer to 2.4. (It
is shown in Gruenhage [1988] that “PFA + (α)” implies a positive answer
to 2.4.)
3. Cosmic Spaces and Coloring Axioms
A space is cosmic if it is the continuous image of a separable metric space
X. Equivalently, X is cosmic if it has a countable network, i.e., a countable
collection N of subsets of X such that if x ∈U with U open, then x ∈N ⊆U
for some N ∈N.
There are several unsolved problems asking if cosmicity of X is implied by
certain conditions on X or its powers.
Question 3.1. Is X cosmic if:
199. ?
(a) Xω is hereditarily separable and hereditarily Lindel¨of?
(b) X2 has no uncountable discrete subspaces?
(c) X is a Lindel¨of semi-metric space?

92
Gruenhage / Perfectly normal compacta
[ch. 6
(d) X has the pointed ccc?
Recall that X is semi-metric if there is for each x ∈X a base b(x, n), n < ω,
such that y ∈b(x, n) ⇔x ∈b(y, n), and X has the pointed ccc if whenever
xα ∈Uα, α < ω1, where Uα is open, then xα ∈Uβ and xβ ∈Uα for some
β ̸= α. Note that cosmic spaces satisfy (a), (b) and (d); ﬁrst countable cosmic
spaces satisfy (c).
Question 3.1(a) is due to Arkhangel’ski˘ı [1978], (c) to Heath [1966],
and (d) to Tkachenko [1978]. E. Michael [1971] used CH to construct a
subset of the plane with the “bow-tie” topology which is a counterexample
to all four questions. C. Ciesielski [1987] constructed a counterexample to
(a), (b), and (d) consistent with MAω1.
Regarding (d), Hajnal and Juh´asz [1982] showed that for spaces of size
and weight ≤ℵ1, if every ﬁnite power of X has the pointed ccc, then under
MAω1, X is cosmic. Todorˇcevi´c [1988] later improved this by removing
the cardinality restriction, assuming PFA. In any case, the following question
of Juh´asz is relevant: “Is the pointed ccc productive?”. There are counterex-
amples consistent with MAω1 (see Gruenhage [1988]), but it’s conceivable
that PFA would imply positive answer, which would solve (d).
The following statement, closely related to (α) in §1, is in some sense
stronger than (a)–(d) above:
(ϵ)
A space X is cosmic iﬀX contains no uncountable discrete space
and no uncountable subspace of the Sorgenfrey line.
With MAω1, (ϵ) implies (α), for assuming MAω1, every uncountable cos-
mic space contains an uncountable metrizable subspace. Consistency of (ϵ)
implies positive answers to (c) and (d), and if consistent with PFA, would
give positive answers to (a) and (b) as well. See Gruenhage [1989] for more
details. Todorˇcevi´c observed that it follows from his result mentioned above
that under PFA, (α) and (ϵ) are actually equivalent. Like (α), statement (ϵ)
is true under PFA for the class of cometrizable spaces Gruenhage [1989].
On the other hand, Todorˇcevi´c [1988] showed that as long as b, the the
least cardinal of an unbounded family in ωω, is not equal to ω2, then there is
a cometrizable counterexample to (ϵ) and 3.1(a), (b) and (d). Note that this
subsumes the previously mentioned examples.
Fremlin and Todorˇcevi´c noticed that the argument for “(ϵ) holds for come-
trizable spaces” given in Gruenhage [1989] can be translated to show that
it follows from a certain partition relation for sets of reals. Let [X]2 denote
the set of all unordered pairs of elements of X. Call U ⊆[X]2 open if the cor-
responding set {(x, y) : {x, y} ∈U} of ordered pairs is open in X2. Following

Todorˇcevi´c [1988], we deﬁne the Open Coloring Axiom OCA3 as follows:
(OCA) Let X be a second countable space. If U ⊆[X]2 is open, then
either there exists an uncountable Y ⊆X with [Y ]2 ⊆U, or
X = 
n∈ω Xn with [Xn]2 ∩U = ∅for all n.
See Todorˇcevi´c [1988] or Fremlin [1984] for a proof that OCA implies
(ϵ). In Todorˇcevi´c [1988], it is also shown that the following is equivalent
to OCA:
(CSM) Let X be a second countable space, and suppose for each
x ∈X, we have assigned a closed set Fx ⊆X. Then either
there exists an uncountable Y ⊆X such that
y ̸= y′ ∈Y ⇒y′ ̸∈Fy
or X = 
n∈ω Xn such that
x ̸= x′ ∈Xn ⇒x ∈Fx′, or x′ ∈Fx.
Another version of CSM (also suggested by Todorˇcevi´c) worth considering
is the statement CSM′, where the conclusion of CSM is changed to either
there is an uncountable Y ⊆X such that
y ̸= y′ ∈Y ⇒y ̸∈Fy′ or y′ ̸∈Fy
or X = 
n∈ω Xn such that
x ̸= x′ ∈Xn ⇒x′ ∈Fx.
A natural way to try to improve the result that “(ϵ) holds for cometrizable
spaces” is to try to prove that OCA or CSM holds for more general spaces4,
e.g., hereditarily ccc spaces. Todorˇcevi´c [1988] states that CSM′ for hered-
itarily ccc spaces would imply (ϵ) for ﬁrst countable spaces. Both CSM and
CSM′ imply that the pointed ccc is ﬁnitely productive (since for any assign-
ment of neighborhoods Ux to points x ∈X, there would be an uncountable
Y ⊆X with y ∈Yy′ for every y ̸= y′ ∈Y ), so if consistent with PFA, would
give a positive answer to 3.1(d).
3In Abraham, Rubin and Shelah [1985], a version of OCA restricted to spaces of size
ℵ1 is denoted SOCA1, and a somewhat diﬀerent statement is denoted OCA. However,
SOCA1 fails in ZFC without the cardinality restriction, because what we would call the
“closed coloring axiom” is false in ZFC.
4CSM and CSM′ always imply OCA; it’s not known if any of the three statements
are equivalent in general.

1. Introduction
The aim of this paper is to collect some open problems on βω, the ˇCech-Stone
compactiﬁcation of the integers. It is recognized that a few of the problems
listed below may be inadequately worded, be trivial or be known. Of many
of the problems the origin is not known. For that reason we do not credit
anybody for posing a certain problem. We would like to thank our colleagues
who brought many of the problems to our attention.
In addition to this, we also comment on the status of the problems in the list
from the second author’s paper in the Handbook of Set-Theoretic Topology:
van Mill [1984], hereafter referred to as the βω-Handbook Paper.
2. Deﬁnitions and Notation
Many notions are deﬁned in the list, but many occur so frequently that we
collect them in this section.
If f is a function from ω to ω then βf: βω →βω is its Stone extension, i.e.,
βf(p) = {P : f ←[P] ∈p}.
The Rudin-Keisler (pre-)order ≤RK on βω is deﬁned as follows: p ≤RK q
iﬀthere is f ∈ωω such that βf(q) = p. Two points p, q ∈βω are called
RK-equivalent, in symbols p ≃RK q, if there is a permutation π: ω →ω such
that βπ(p) = q. We denote the RK-equivalence class of p by [p]RK.
Let P(ω) denote the power set of ω.
Let fin denote the ideal of ﬁnite
subsets of ω. The quotient algebra P(ω)/fin is naturally isomorphic to the
Boolean algebra of clopen subsets of ω∗= βω \ ω.
If A, B ⊆ω, then A is almost contained in B, abbreviated A ⊆∗B, if
|A \ B| < ω.
We denote the character of a point p ∈ω∗by χ(p), thus
χ(p)
=
min{ |B| : B is a local base at p in ω∗}
=
min{ |B| : B ⊆p generates p }.
A point p ∈ω∗is called a P-point, if for every function f from ω into itself,
there is an element P ∈p on which f is ﬁnite-to-one, or constant. Equiva-
lently, the intersection of countably many neighborhoods of p in ω∗is again a
neighborhood of p. A simple P-point is a point with a linearly ordered local
base. If in the above deﬁnition P can always be chosen so that f is one-to-one
or constant on P, then p is called selective. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal. A
subset A of a space X is called a Pκ-set if the intersection of fewer than κ
many neighborhoods of A is again a neighborhood of A. If A consists of one
point then that point is called a Pκ-point. A P-set is a Pω1-set.
For a discussion of MA and PFA, see Weiss [1984] and Baumgart-
ner [1984]. For information on the cardinals a, b, c, d and others, see the
contribution of Vaughan in this volume.

3. Answers to older problems
In this section we collect the problems from the βω-Handbook Paper that have
been solved. We list them, with their answers, using the original numbering.
2 Are there points p and q ∈ω∗such that if f: ω →ω is any ﬁnite-to-one map,
then βf(p) ̸= βf(q)?
Let us abbreviate the following statement by NCF (Near Coherence of
Filters):
for every p and q ∈ω∗there is a ﬁnite-to-one f: ω →ω such that
βf(p) = βf(q).
So the question is whether NCF is false. Under MA it is. But not in ZFC:
Shelah produced models such that for all p and q ∈ω∗there is a ﬁnite-to-one
map f: ω →ω such that βf(p) = βf(q) is a P-point of character ω1 (observe
that in this model CH is false, so that a point with character ω1 has small
character), see the papers Blass and Shelah [1987, 19∞]. The latter model
is the model obtained by iterating rational perfect set forcing (Miller [1984])
ω2 times; the former model is also obtained in an ω2-step iteration but the
poset used is somewhat more diﬃcult to describe.
This iteration however
can be modiﬁed to produce a model in which there are p and q in ω∗with
linearly ordered bases and with χ(p) = ω1 and χ(q) = ω2. This answered
a question of Nyikos who showed that if p and q in ω∗are simple P-points
with χ(p) < χ(q) then χ(p) = b and χ(q) = d and asked whether this situation
is actually possible.
The consistency of NCF implies among other things that the ˇCech-Stone-
remainder H∗of the half-line H = [ 0, ∞), which is an indecomposable con-
tinuum (see Bellamy [1971] and Woods [1968]), has (consistently) only one
composant. For details, see e.g., Rudin [1970]. In fact NCF is equivalent to
the statement that H∗has exactly one composant (Mioduszewski [1978]).
See the papers Blass [1986] and [1987] for more information on NCF.
6 Is there a ccc P-set in ω∗?
In [1989] Frankiewicz, Shelah and Zbierski announced the consistency
of a negative answer.
Now a ccc subset of ω∗is topologically quite small (it is nowhere dense for
example), and it is also interesting to know what nowhere dense P-sets can
look like. By way of an example one may wonder whether ω∗can be realized
as a nowhere dense P-subset of itself. The answer to this question is in the
negative. Just [19∞] recently showed the consistency of the statement that
no nowhere dense P-set in ω∗is homeomorphic to ω∗. In fact, Just showed
that “if A ⊆ω∗is a nowhere dense P-set and a continuous image of ω∗then
A is ccc” is consistent with ZFC.

Answers to older problems

8 Is the autohomeomorphism group of ω∗algebraically simple?
This problem was motivated by the question in van Douwen, Monk
and Rubin [1980] whether the automorphism group Aut(B) of a homoge-
neous Boolean algebra B is algebraically simple.
The Boolean algebra of
clopen subsets of ω∗is clearly isomorphic to the quotient algebra P(ω)/fin,
which is easily seen to be homogeneous. It can be shown that under CH,
Aut (P(ω)/fin) is algebraically simple, see ˇStˇep´anek and Rubin [1989].
However,van Douwen showed in [1990] that the group of trivial (see below)
automorphisms of P(ω)/fin is not algebraically simple. It follows that in
Shelah’s model (see Shelah [1982]) where every automorphism of P(ω)/fin
is trivial, Aut (P(ω)/fin) is not algebraically simple. Independently, Kop-
pelberg [1985] constructed a diﬀerent example of a homogeneous Boolean
algebra the automorphism group of which is not simple, under CH.
Let us take this opportunity to correct a small mistake in the βω-Handbook
Paper which caused some confusion. On page 537, line 8 it states:
As remarked in Section 2.2, Shelah [1978] has shown it to be con-
sistent that every autohomeomorphisms of ω∗is induced by a per-
mutation of ω.
This is not true of course. If F and G are ﬁnite subsets of ω then each bijec-
tion π: ω \ F →ω \ G induces a homeomorphism ¯π of ω∗and Shelah proved
that consistently, all homeomorphisms of ω∗are of this form.
Let us call
such homeomorphisms trivial or induced, and let Triv denote the subgroup
of Aut (P(ω)/fin) consisting of all trivial automorphisms. So van Mill mis-
quoted Shelah’s result. All results in the βω-Handbook Paper depending on
Shelah’s result (such as Theorem 2.2.1) are correct, as can be seen by making
trivial modiﬁcations to the proofs given.
Van Douwen’s argument is now easy to summarize: if h ∈Triv is represented
as above then the parity of |F|+|G| depends only on h; and the automorphisms
for which the parity is even form a subgroup of Triv of index 2.
10 Is every ﬁrst countable compactum a continuous image of ω∗?
To put this question into perspective, note that by Arkhangel’ski˘ı’s result
from [1969], every ﬁrst countable compactum has cardinality at most c and
hence has weight at most c, and hence is—under CH—a continuous image of
ω∗by Parovichenko’s result in [1963]. Pertinent to this question is also the
result of Przymusi´nski [1982] that every perfectly normal compact space is
a continuous image of ω∗. Problem 10 was recently answered in the negative
(necessarily consistently) by Bell [19∞] who modiﬁed an older construction
of his, Bell [1982], to obtain the desired counterexample.
12 Is there a separable closed subspace of βω which is not a retract of βω?
Such spaces were constructed by Shapiro [1985] and Simon [1987]. Simon,
using heavy machinery from independent linked families, directly constructed

102
Hart and van Mill / βω
[ch. 7
a closed separable subspace of βω which is not a retract; Shapiro constructed a
certain compact separable space and showed that not every copy of its absolute
in βω could be a retract of βω. See question 24 for more information.
13 Let (∗) denote the statement that every Parovichenko space is coabsolute with
ω∗. Is (∗) equivalent to CH?
Dow [1984] answered this question in the negative by establishing the in-
teresting fact that (∗) follows from the continuum having coﬁnality ω1. This
suggests a question that will be posed later on.
14 Let X be the Stone space of the reduced measure algebra of [0, 1].
Is it
consistent that X is not a continuous image of ω∗?
This question was answered in the aﬃrmative by Frankiewicz [1985], using
the oracle-cc method of Shelah [1982].
17 Is there a p ∈ω∗such that ω∗\ {p} is not C∗-embedded in ω∗?
Recall that X is C∗-embedded in Y if every continuous function from X to
[0, 1] can be extended over Y . This question has been solved completely now.
By an old result of Gillman [1966] it follows that under CH, for every p ∈ω∗
the space ω∗\ {p} is not C∗-embedded in βω. However, by a result of van
Douwen, Kunen and van Mill [1989] it is consistent with MA + c = ω2
that for every p ∈ω∗the space ω∗\ {p} is C∗-embedded in βω. In [1987]
Malykhin announced the result that if one adds c+ Cohen reals to any model
of set theory then one obtains a model in which ω∗\{p} is C∗-embedded in
ω∗for every p ∈ω∗. A proof may be found in Dow [1988a].
22 Is there a point p ∈ω∗such that some compactiﬁcation of ω ∪{p} does not
contain a copy of βω?
Ryll-Nardzewski and Telg´arsky [1970] showed that if p is a simple P-
point then the space ω∪{p} has a scattered (= every subspace has an isolated
point) compactiﬁcation. Thus the answer to this problem is in the aﬃrmative
under MA. On the other hand in [1987] Malykhin also announced that in
the same model as mentioned above for every p ∈ω∗every compactiﬁcation
of ω ∪{p} contains a copy of βω.
24 Is there a point p ∈ω∗such that if f: ω →ω is any map, then either βf(p) ∈ω
or βf(p) has character c in βω?
Since under MA each point in ω∗has character c in ω∗, the answer to this
question is trivially YES under MA. However, it is not YES in ZFC because
in answer 2 we already remarked that Shelah has constructed models in which
c = ω2 and in which (in particular) for every p ∈ω∗there is a ﬁnite-to-one
function f: ω →ω such that βf(p) has character ω1 in ω∗. In fact NCF
is equivalent to the statement that for every p ∈ω∗there is a ﬁnite-to-one
f: ω →ω such that χ(βf(p)) < d, so that every model for NCF provides a
negative answer to this question.

§4]
Autohomeomorphisms
103
4. Autohomeomorphisms
We consider the autohomeomorphism group of the space ω∗or equivalently
Aut (P(ω)/fin). Recall answer 8:
The autohomeomorphism group of ω∗may, but need not, be alge-
braically simple.
This prompts us to add a few problems about Aut (P(ω)/fin), the solutions
of which may shed some light on the possible algebraic structure of this group.
See also the contribution by Stepr¯ans to this volume.
Question 1. Can Triv be a proper normal subgroup of Aut (P(ω)/fin), and if 200. ?
yes what is (or can be) the structure of the factor group Aut (P(ω)/fin) /Triv;
and if no what is (or can be) [ Triv : Aut (P(ω)/fin)]?
For h ∈Aut (P(ω)/fin) we let I(h) = { A ⊆ω : h|A is trivial }, where
“h|A is trivial” means that there are a ﬁnite set F ⊆A and a one-to-one
f: A \ F →ω such that h(X) = f[X \ F] for X ⊆A. Let us observe that h is
trivial iﬀω ∈I(h), and that I(h) is an ideal.
To make the statements of some of the following questions a bit easier we
shall call h ∈Aut (P(ω)/fin): totally non-trivial if I(h) = fin, somewhere
trivial if I(h) ̸= fin and almost trivial if I(h) is a tall ideal. Recall that an
ideal I on ω is tall if every inﬁnite subset of ω contains an inﬁnite element of
I.
It is not hard to show that under CH there is a totally non-trivial auto-
morphism. Recently it was shown by Shelah and Stepr¯ans in [1988] that
PFA implies that every h ∈Aut (P(ω)/fin) is trivial, they also mention that
Velickovic showed it to be consistent with MA + ¬CH that a non-trivial
automorphism exists.
We ask the following questions:
Question 2.
Is it consistent with MA + ¬CH that a totally non-trivial 201. ?
automorphism exists?
Question 3. Is it consistent to have a non-trivial automorphism, while for 202. ?
every h ∈Aut (P(ω)/fin) the ideal I(h) is the intersection of ﬁnitely many
prime ideals?
Question 4. Does the existence of a totally non-trivial automorphism imply 203. ?
that Aut (P(ω)/fin) is simple?
Question 5. Does the existence of a non-trivial automorphism imply that 204. ?
Aut (P(ω)/fin) is simple?

104
Hart and van Mill / βω
[ch. 7
The proof in Shelah and Stepr¯ans [1988] suggests the following ques-
tions:
Question 6.
If every automorphism is somewhere trivial, is then every
? 205.
automorphism trivial?
Question 7. Is every ideal I(h) a P-ideal (if every automorphism is some-
? 206.
where trivial)?
An ideal I on ω is said to be a P-ideal if whenever {Xn : n ∈ω} is a
subfamily of I there is an X in I such that Xn ⊆∗X for all n ∈ω.
For the next group of questions we make the following deﬁnitions: if κ is a
cardinal and h ∈Aut (P(ω)/fin) call h
κ-weakly trivial if |{ p : h(p) ̸≃RK p }| < κ and,
κ-quasi trivial if for every p ∈ω∗there is Sp ⊆[p]RK such that
|Sp| < κ ∧∀q, q′ ∈[p]RK \ Sp : h(q) ≃RK h(q′) and |{ p : Sp ̸= ∅}| < κ
Let Wκ = { h : h, h−1κ-weakly trivial } and Qκ = { h : h, h−1κ-quasi trivial }.
It is known that Wκ is a normal subgroup of Qκ.
Question 8. Is it consistent to have a cardinal κ such that every automor-
? 207.
phism is κ-weakly trivial?
Question 9. Is it consistent to have a cardinal κ such that every automor-
? 208.
phism is κ-quasi trivial?
Question 10. Is it consistent to have Wκ ̸= Qκ = Aut (P(ω)/fin) for some
? 209.
regular κ ≤c?
Question 11.
(MA + ¬CH) if p and q are Pc-points is there an h in
? 210.
Aut (P(ω)/fin) such that h(p) = q?
Note: say p ≡q iﬀω = ·
n Pn = ·
n Qn (ﬁnite sets) such that
∀A ∈p ∃B ∈q ∀n |A ∩Pn| = |B ∩Qn|
and conversely. Clearly RK-equivalent points are ≡-equivalent. As a partial
answer to Problem 11 the following was shown to be consistent:
MA + ¬CH+ “for all Pc-points p and q, if p ≡q then there is an h ∈
Aut (P(ω)/fin) such that h(p) = q.”
We ask:
Question 12. Is ≡diﬀerent from RK-equivalence in ZFC?
? 211.

§5]
Subspaces
105
5. Subspaces
In this section we deal with subspaces of βω and ω∗. The following question
is well-known.
Question 13.
For what p are ω∗\{p} and (equivalently) βω\{p} non- 212. ?
normal?
There are several simple proofs that, under CH, for any p ∈ω∗, the spaces
βω\{p} and ω∗\{p} are not normal, see e.g., Rajagopalan [1972], War-
ren [1972], and van Mill [1986]. It was shown by Beslagic and Van Douwen
that CH may be relaxed to the equality r = c, here r is the least cardinality
of a “reaping” family; this is a family R of subsets of ω such that for every
subset X of ω there is an R ∈R such that R ⊆X or R ∩X = ∅.
However, for years no signiﬁcant progress has been made on Problem 13.
The best result so far is that if p ∈ω∗is an accumulation point of some count-
able discrete subset of ω∗, then ω∗\{p} is not normal. In [1982] Gryzlov
showed that also points that are not an accumulation point of any countable
subset of ω∗may have this property.
Related to this question is the following:
Question 14. Is it consistent that there is a non-butterﬂy point in ω∗?
213. ?
A butterﬂy point is a point p for which there are sets D and E such that
D ∩E = {p}. For a non-butterﬂy point p the space ω∗\{p} is normal.
In connection with Answer 17 one may also ask
Question 15. Is it consistent that ω∗\{p} is C∗-embedded in ω∗for some 214. ?
but not all p ∈ω∗?
Question 16.
What spaces can be embedded in βω?
215. ?
In [1973] Louveau proved that under CH, a compact space X can be
embedded in βω if and only if X is a compact zero-dimensional F-space of
weight at most c (or, equivalently, the Stone space of a weakly countably
complete Boolean algebra of cardinality at most c).
There is a consistent
example in van Douwen and van Mill [1980] of a compact zero-dimensional
F-space of weight c that cannot be embedded in any compact extremally
disconnected space (that is, the Stone space of a complete Boolean algebra).
So the CH assumption in Louveau’s result is essential. These remarks have
motivated Problem 16.
Question 17. Is CH equivalent to the statement that every compact zero- 216. ?
dimensional F-space of weight c is embeddable in ω∗?

106
Hart and van Mill / βω
[ch. 7
A compact space is basically disconnected if it is the Stone space of a σ-
complete Boolean algebra.
Question 18. Is there (consistently) a basically disconnected compact space
? 217.
of weight c that is not embeddable in ω∗?
A natural candidate for such an example would be the ˇCech-Stone com-
pactiﬁcation of an appropriate P-space (= a space in which every Gδ-set is
open). However, Dow and van Mill showed in [1982] that such an example
does not work. For more information, see the remarks following Problem 16
Motivated by Answer 6 we specialize Problem 16 to:
Question 19. Describe the P-sets of ω∗
? 218.
Finally, to ﬁnish the questions on embeddings we ask:
Question 20. Is there a copy of ω∗in ω∗not of the form D \ D for some
? 219.
countable and discrete D ⊆ω∗?
Of course Just’s result cited after Answer 6 blocks an “easy” way out of this
problem: a P-set homeomorphic to ω∗would certainly do the trick. However
it may still be possible for example, to realize ω∗as a weak P-set in ω∗.
Question 21. Is every subspace of ω∗strongly zero-dimensional?
? 220.
We have no information on this problem.
Question 22.
Is every nowhere dense subset of ω∗a c-set?
? 221.
A set D in a topological space is called a κ-set, where κ is a cardinal
number, if there is a disjoint family U of size κ of open sets such that D ⊆U
for every U in U. One may think of κ-sets as providing an indication of how
non-extremally disconnected a space is (in an extremally disconnected space
no nowhere dense set is even a 2-set). As is well-known, ω∗is not extremally
disconnected and we are asking whether it is, in a way, totally non-extremally
disconnected (c is the largest cardinal we can hope for of course). It should
be noted however that, as far as we know, it is also unknown whether every
nowhere dense set in ω∗is a 2-set. The reason we ask about c-sets is that all
partial answers seem to point into the direction of c: Balcar and Vojt´aˇs
showed in [1980] that every one-point set is a c-set. This was improved in
Balcar, Doˇckalkov´a and Simon [1984] to sets of density less than c.
Furthermore the answer to the general question is known to be YES if either
a = c, d = c, d = ω1 or b = d. More information, including proofs of the
above YES can be found in Balcar and Simon [1989].

Individual Ultraﬁlters

A positive answer to question 22 would provide a negative answer to the
following, natural sounding, question:
Question 23. Is there a maximal nowhere dense subset in ω∗?
222. ?
Here ‘maximal’ means that it is not nowhere dense in a larger nowhere
dense subset of ω∗. One can see with a little eﬀort that no c-set can be a
maximal nowhere dense set.
A compact space X is dyadic if it is a continuous image of a power of {0, 1}.
The absolute of a compact space X is the Stone space of the Boolean algebra
of regular open subsets of X.
Question 24.
Is there an absolute retract of βω that is not the absolute of 223. ?
a dyadic space?
Recall from answer 12 that not every separable closed subspace of βω is a
retract of βω. On the other hand it was shown by Maharam in [1976] that
such a subspace can be reembedded into βω in such a way that it is a retract
of βω.
This motivates the notion of an absolute retract of βω.
A closed
subspace X of βω is an Absolute Retract (AR) of βω if for every embedding
h: X →βω, h[X] is a retract of βω. It can be shown that if X ⊆βω is
the absolute of a dyadic space then X is an AR of βω and Shapiro [1985]
established the converse in case X is the absolute of some (compact separable)
space of weight at most ω1.
6. Individual Ultraﬁlters
In this section we collect some questions that ask for individual points in βω
or for special ultraﬁlters.
Question 25.
Is there a model in which there are no P-points and no 224. ?
Q-points?
Recall that p ∈ω∗is a Q-point if for every ﬁnite-to-one function f: ω →ω
there is an element E ∈p such that f is one-to-one on E. We already men-
tioned that Shelah produced a model in which there are no P-points (Wim-
mers [1982]). The continuum is ω2 in this model. On the other hand there is
also a model in which there are no Q-points (Miller [1980]). In this model—
Laver’s model for the Borel Conjecture (Laver [1976])—the continuum is also
ω2. The interest in Problem 25 comes from the fact that, by results from Ke-
tonen [1976] and Mathias [1978], if c ≤ω2 then there is either a P-point or
a Q-point.

Hart and van Mill / βω
[ch. 7
An ultraﬁlter p is called rapid if for every f ∈ωω there exists a g ∈ωω
such that ∀nf(n) < g(n) and g[ω] ∈p (in words: the counting functions of
the elements of p form a dominating family). Every Q-point is rapid.
Question 26. Is there a model in which there is a rapid ultraﬁlter but in
? 225.
which there is no Q-point?
The reason we ask this question is that in every model without Q-points
that we know of there are also no rapid ultraﬁlters.
In [1982] Shelah showed that it is consistent that there is, up to permu-
tation, only one selective ultraﬁlter. Of course one may then also ask:
Question 27.
Is it consistent that there is, up to permutation, only one
? 226.
P-point in ω∗?
Question 28. Is there a model in which every point of ω∗is an R-point?
? 227.
A point p ∈ω∗is an R-point if there is an open Fσ-set U ⊆ω∗such that
(i) p ∈U, and
(ii) ∀A ∈[U]<c : p ̸∈A.
Note that an R-point is not a P-point. So we are asking for a special model
without P-points. R-points were introduced in van Mill [1983] but have
played no role of importance so far. So this question is probably not very
much of interest.
Question 29. Is there p ∈ω∗such that every compactiﬁcation of ω ∪{p}
? 228.
contains βω?
This question was motivated by an example in van Douwen and Przy-
musi´nsky [1979]: there is a countable space with only one non-isolated point,
every compactiﬁcation of which contains a copy of βω. Compare this question
also with Answer 22: it is consistent that for every p ∈ω∗every compactiﬁ-
cation of ω ∪{p} contains a copy of βω. There is however, as far as we know,
no ZFC-construction of a point with these properties.
For the next question identify ω with Q.
Question 30.
Is there p ∈ω∗such that { A ∈p : A is closed and nowhere
? 229.
dense in Q and also homeomorphic to Q } is a base for p?
This question arose in the study of remote points.
A point p in βX \
X is called a remote point of X if for every nowhere dense subset D of X
one has p ̸∈D. For us it is important to know that Q has remote points
(van Douwen [1981b] and Chae and Smith [1980]). Q also has non-remote
points: simply take p ∈N, such a point is also a real ultraﬁlter on the set Q.

§7]
Dynamics, Algebra and Number Theory
109
Problem 30 asks for a not-so-simple non-remote point, which is still a real
ultraﬁlter on Q.
The answer is known to be YES under MAcountable.
A
related question is the following:
Question 31. Is there a p ∈ω∗such that whenever ⟨xn : n ∈ω⟩is a sequence 230. ?
in Q there is an A ∈p such that { xn : n ∈A } is nowhere dense?
For the next question let
G =

⟨fα : α ∈ω1⟩, ⟨gα : α ∈ω1⟩

be a HausdorﬀGap in ωω, and let
IG = { M : ∃h ∈Mω ∀α fα|M <∗h <∗gα|M }
Under MA + ¬CH this ideal is tall.
Question 32. (MA + ¬CH) Are there G and p (P-point, selective) such 231. ?
that p ⊆I+
G ?
This question is more delicate than it may seem: it is a theorem of Woodin,
see Dales and Woodin [1987], that under MA+¬CH one can ﬁnd for every
p ∈ω∗an h ∈ωω such that for all α ∈ω1 fα <p h <p gα, where f <p g
means that { n : f(n) < g(n) } ∈p.
Now let p be a Pc-point, and ﬁnd A ∈p such that A ⊆∗{ n : fα(n) <
h(n) < gα(n) } for all α. It follows that A ∈IG. Loosely speaking one can
say that to a Pc-point ω1 seems countable. What we are asking for here is an
ultraﬁlter with some strong properties that, in spite of MA+¬CH, considers
ω1 to be uncountable.
7. Dynamics, Algebra and Number Theory
For the next question identify ω with Z, and consider the shift σ: Z →Z
deﬁned by σ(n) = n + 1. Denote its extension to βZ also by σ, and likewise
its restriction to Z∗. For p ∈Z∗we let Op denote its orbit { σn(p) : n ∈Z }
and Cp is the closure of Op. Cp is called an orbit closure. An orbit closure is
called maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other orbit closure.
Question 33. Is there a point in ω∗that is not an element of any maximal 232. ?
orbit closure?
It would also be of interest to know the answer to the following, related,
question:
Question 34. Is there an inﬁnite strictly increasing sequence of orbit clo- 233. ?
sures?

110
Hart and van Mill / βω
[ch. 7
The next question is related to Furstenberg’s multiple recurrence theorem,
Furstenberg [1981]. A convenient way to state this theorem is for us: if
f and g are commuting continuous selfmaps of the Cantor set ω2 then there
are a p ∈ω∗and an x ∈ω2 such that p−lim f n(x) = p−lim gn(x) = x. The
question is whether one can switch quantiﬁers, i.e.
Question 35.
Is there a p ∈ω∗such that for every pair of commuting
? 234.
continuous maps f, g : ω2 →ω2 there is an x ∈ω2 such that p−lim f n(x) =
p−lim gn(x) = x?
There are ultraﬁlters p such that for every f there is an x such that x =
p−lim f n(x): take an idempotent in the semigroup ⟨ω∗, +⟩(see below), pick
y arbitrary and let x = p−lim f n(y). An equivalent question is whether the
Cantor cube c2 satisﬁes the conclusion of Furstenberg’s theorem. The answer
is known to be yes under MA.
Let Sω denote the permutation group of ω, it acts on ω∗in the obvious
way.
Question 36.
For what nowhere dense sets A ⊆ω∗do we have
? 235. 
π∈Sω π[A] ̸= ω∗?
Let n be the smallest number of nowhere dense sets needed to cover ω∗.
In Balcar, Pelant and Simon [1980] it is shown that c < n is consistent,
hence we can say “for all nowhere dense sets” in models for this inequality.
However also n ≤c is consistent, and in such models we do not have an easy
answer. Some nowhere dense sets satisfy the inequality in ZFC: singletons
work since |ω∗| > |Sω|. In addition Gryzlov has shown in [1984] that in
ZFC the following nowhere dense P-set also works:
A =

{ X∗: X ⊆ω and δ(X) = 1 },
where
δ(X) = lim
n→∞
|X ∩n|
n
if this limit exists (δ(X) is called the density of X in ω).
There is a natural nowhere dense set in ω∗the permutations of which
consistently cover ω∗: identify ω and ω2, and for every n ∈ω and f ∈ωω
put U(f, n) = { ⟨k, l⟩: k ≥n, l ≥f(k) }. The set B = { U(f, n)∗: f ∈ωω
and n ∈ω } is nowhere dense and 
π∈Sω π[B] = ω∗\ { p : p is a P-point }. A
probably more diﬃcult question is:
Question 37. For what nowhere dense sets A ⊆ω∗do we have { h[A] :
? 236.
h ∈H(ω∗) } ̸= ω∗?

§8]
Other
111
Again singletons work, but now the reason is deeper: ω∗is not homo-
geneous. Clearly the set B of the question 36 also satisﬁes { h[B] : h ∈
H(ω∗) } = ω∗\{ p : p is a P-point }. As a start one may investigate the set A
deﬁned above.
For the next set of questions we consider binary operations on βω. If ∗is
any binary operation on ω then one can extend it in a natural way to βω as
follows: ﬁrst deﬁne p ∗n for p ∈ω∗and n ∈ω by p ∗n = p−lim m ∗n; then if
q ∈ω∗we deﬁne p∗q = q−lim p∗n. It is not hard to verify that this operation
is continuous in the second coordinate. We shall be especially interested in
the cases ∗= + and ∗= ×.
In these cases ⟨βω, ∗⟩is a right-continuous
semigroup. A lot is known about these semigroups, see Hindman [1979] and
van Douwen [19∞b], but some questions still remain.
Question 38. Can ⟨βN, +⟩be embedded in ⟨N∗, +⟩?
237. ?
Question 39. Are there p, q, r and s in N∗such that p + q = r × s?
238. ?
Question 40. What are the maximal subgroups of ⟨βN, +⟩and ⟨βN, ×⟩?
239. ?
The next two questions are from van Douwen [1981a], where one can ﬁnd
much more information on the topic of these problems. To begin a deﬁnition:
a map h: X × Y →S × T is said to be elementary if it is a product of two
mappings or a product composed with (if possible) a reﬂection on S × T . Let
X be ω∗or βω.
Question 41. If h: X2 →X2 is a homeomorphism, is there a disjoint open 240. ?
cover U of X such that for all U, V ∈U the map h|U × V is elementary?
Question 42. If ϕ: X2 →X is continuous, is there a disjoint open cover U
241. ?
of X such that for all U, V ∈U the map ϕ|U ×V depends on one coordinate?
8. Other
The following question is one of the most, if not the most, interesting problems
about βω.
Question 43. Are ω∗and ω∗
1 ever homeomorphic?
242. ?
In spite of its simplicity and the general gut reaction: NO!, it is still unan-
swered. A nice touch to this question is its Boolean Algebraic variant:
are the Boolean Algebras P(ω)/fin and P(ω1)/[ω1]<ω ever isomorphic?
This variant also makes sense in the absence of the Axiom of Choice (AC):
the spaces ω∗and ω∗
1 then need not exist (Feferman [1964/65]); but the

112
Hart and van Mill / βω
[ch. 7
algebras P(ω)/fin and P(ω1)/[ω1]<ω always do. It would be very interesting
indeed if on the one hand in ZFC the spaces ω∗and ω∗
1 are not homeomorphic,
while on the other hand it would be consistent with ZF that P(ω)/fin and
P(ω1)/[ω1]<ω are isomorphic.
In Balcar and Frankiewicz [1978] it is shown that if ω∗and κ∗are
homeomorphic for some uncountable regular κ then there is a κ-scale in ωω.
As a consequence one obtains that if b < d the spaces ω∗and ω∗
1 are not
homeomorphic. The same conclusion follows from MA: if CH is true then
|ω∗| < |ω∗
1| and if CH is false then there is no ω1-scale. The results from
Frankiewicz [1977] allow one to conclude that ω∗
1 and ω∗
2 are not homeo-
morphic and that then, in fact, κ∗and λ∗are not homeomorphic if ω ≤κ < λ
and ⟨κ, λ⟩̸= ⟨ω, ω1⟩. Some of the consequences of a positive answer have been
shown to be consistent, see e.g., Stepr¯ans [1985].
Related to this question is the following:
Question 44. Is there consistently an uncountable cardinal κ such that ω∗
? 243.
and U(κ) are homeomorphic?
Here, U(κ) is the subspace of βκ consisting of all uniform ultraﬁlters. Let
us observe that for such a κ we would have cof(κ) = ω and 2ω = 2κ, see van
Douwen [19∞a] for more information, including a proof of the following
curious fact: there is at most one n ∈ω for which there is a κ > ωn with
U(ωn) and U(κ) homeomorphic.
Recall from question 36 that n is the minimal number of nowhere dense
sets needed to cover ω∗. For any dense-in-itself topological space X one can
deﬁne n(X) (wn(X)) as the minimal cardinality of a family of nowhere dense
sets that covers X (has a dense union).
The number wn(ω∗) is equal to
the cardinal h (see the article by Vaughan). It is straightforward to show
that n(Xn) ≥n(Xm) and wn(Xn) ≥wn(Xm) whenever n ≤m. The gen-
eral question is about the behaviour of the sequences ⟨n(ω∗) : n ∈N⟩and
⟨wn(ω∗) : n ∈N⟩. Some speciﬁc questions:
Question 45. When do the sequences ⟨n(ω∗) : n ∈N⟩and ⟨wn(ω∗) : n ∈N⟩
? 244.
become constant?
Question 46.
Is it consistent that n(ω∗) > n(ω∗× ω∗), that wn(ω∗) >
? 245.
wn(ω∗× ω∗)?
What is known is that n > c implies n(ω∗) = n(ω∗× ω∗).
Here we pose the question suggested by Answer 13:
Question 47.
Does the statement that all Parovichenko spaces are co-
? 246.
absolute (with ω∗) imply that cf(c) = ω1?

§8]
Other
113
Question 48. Let X be a compact space that can be mapped onto ω∗. Is X 247. ?
non-homogeneous?
Van Douwen proved in [1978] proved that the answer to this question is in
the aﬃrmative provided that X has weight at most c. In general, the problem
is unsolved. For more information, see the article by Kunen in this volume.
Question 49.
Is it consistent that every compact space contains either a 248. ?
converging sequence or a copy of βω?
Under various extra-set-theoretical assumptions compact spaces have been
constructed that contain neither a converging sequence nor a copy of βω, but
no ZFC-example is known. It is as far as we know also unknown what the ef-
fect of MA+¬CH is on this problem. Of this question there is also a Boolean
Algebraic variant: is it consistent that every inﬁnite Boolean Algebra has ei-
ther a countably inﬁnite homomorphic image or a complete homomorphic
image.
Question 50. Is there a locally connected continuum such that every proper 249. ?
subcontinuum contains a copy of βω?
Question 51. Is there an extremally disconnected normal locally compact 250. ?
space that is not paracompact?
Kunen and Parsons proved in [1979] proved that if κ is weakly compact,
then the space βκ \ U(κ) is normal but not paracompact. In addition, van
Douwen [1979] proved that there is a locally compact basically disconnected
(= the closure of every open Fσ-set is open) space which is normal but not
paracompact. This is basically all we know about this problem.
Question 52. Is every compact hereditarily paracompact space of weight at 251. ?
most c a continuous image of ω∗?
This question is related to Answer 10: Przymusi´nski showed that every per-
fectly normal (= hereditarily Lindel¨of) compact space is a continuous image
of ω∗, whereas the ﬁrst-countable nonimage by Bell is hereditarily metacom-
pact. Since perfectly normal compact spaces are (hereditarily) ccc, and since
separable compact spaces are clearly continuous images of ω∗, we are also led
to ask:
Question 53. Is every hereditarily ccc compact space a continuous image 252. ?
of ω∗?
The answer is yes under MAω1 by Szentmiklossy’s result from [1978]
that then compact hereditarily ccc spaces are perfectly normal, and under

CH by Parovichenko’s theorem, since compact hereditarily ccc spaces are of
size at most c, see e.g., Hodel [1984].

Question 57.
If I is the ideal of nowhere dense subsets of Q can I be

extended to a (tall) P-ideal?
See Dow [1990] for more information on this problem (a YES answer implies
that the space of minimal prime ideals of C(ω∗) is not basically disconnected).
The following question is probably more about forcing than about βω.
Question 58. Is there a ccc forcing extension of L, in which there are no
? 257.
P-points?
Now we formulate some problems on characters of ultraﬁlters. It it easy to
show that ω1 ≤χ(p) ≤c for all p ∈ω∗. Furthermore in [1939] Posp´ıˇsil has
shown that there are 2c points in ω∗of character c. This is the best one can
say: under MA we have χ(p) = c for all p ∈ω∗while by exercise VII A10 in
Kunen [1980] the existence of a p ∈ω∗with χ(p) = ω1 is consistent with any
cardinal arithmetic.
There are several models in which one has a p ∈ω∗with χ(p) < c, but
these models have a few properties in common.
The ﬁrst is that in all of these models there are P-points in ω∗.
These constructions fall roughly speaking into two categories: in the ﬁrst
of these, and the models from Kunen [1980] fall into this one, the ultraﬁlter
of small character is build in an iterated forcing construction and is almost
unavoidably a P-point.
In the constructions of the second category one normally starts with a model
of CH and enlarges the continuum while preserving some ultraﬁlters from the
ground model. Again the ultraﬁlters that are preserved are most of the time
P-points. An extreme case of this are the models for NCF from Blass and
Shelah [1987, 19∞]: there the ultraﬁlters that are preserved are precisely
the P-points and in the ﬁnal model we even have χ(p) < c if and only if p is
a P-point.

§8]
Other
115
In Hart [1989] the ﬁrst author showed that in the model obtained by adding
any number of Sacks-reals side-by-side there are many types of ultraﬁlters
of character ω1 including very many non P-points. Unfortunately all these
ultraﬁlters were constructed using P-points. This leads us to our ﬁrst problem:
Question 59.
Is there a model in which there are no P-points, but there is 258. ?
an ultraﬁlter of character less than c?
This is probably a very diﬃcult problem and an answer to the following
problem may be easier to give:
Question 60. Is there a model in which there is an ultraﬁlter of character 259. ?
less than c without any P-point below it in the Rudin-Keisler order?
The second property of these models is maybe not so obvious: in all models
that we know of there seems to be only one character below c. In the majority
of these models we have c = ω2 so that an ultraﬁlter of small character
automatically has character ω1. In various other models usually nothing is
known about ultraﬁlters other than the ones constructed explicitly. Thus we
get to our second problem: let Ξ = { χ(p) : p ∈ω∗and χ(p) < c }.
Question 61. What are the possibilities for Ξ; can Ξ be the set of all (regular) 260. ?
cardinals below c, with c large; what is Ξ in the side-by-side Sacks model?
In [1989] Frankiewicz, Shelah and Zbierski announce the consistency
of “c > ω2 and for every regular κ ≤c there is an ultraﬁlter of character κ”.
Here we mention a well-known question on the Rudin-Keisler order, which
has some partial answers involving characters of ultraﬁlters.
Question 62.
Is there for every p ∈ω∗a q ∈ω∗such that p and q are 261. ?
≤RK-incomparable?
It is known that there exist p and q in ω∗such that p and q are ≤RK-
incomparable (Kunen [1972]). However, the full answer to this problem is
not known yet, some partial positive results can be found in Hindman [1988]
and Butkoviˇcov´a [19∞b]; for example if p is such that χ(r) = c for every
r ≤RK then there is a q that is ≤RK-incomparable with p, and if 2κ > c for
some κ < c then such a q can be found for every p of character c. The ideas
in Blass and Shelah [1987, 19∞] may shed light on this problem.
The π-character of a point p in a space X is the minimum cardinality of a
family of nonempty open sets such that every neighborhood of p contains one
of them.

116
Hart and van Mill / βω
[ch. 7
Question 63.
Is there consistently a point in ω∗whose π-character has
? 262.
countable coﬁnality?
Under MA the π-character of any ultraﬁlter is c. It was shown by Bell
and Kunen in [1981] that there is always a p with πχ(p) ≥cof(c) and that it
is consistent that both c = ℵω1 and πχ(p) = ω1 for all p ∈ω∗.
Another character problem is the following:
Question 64. Is it consistent that t(p, ω∗) < χ(p) for some p ∈ω∗?
? 263.
The tightness t(p, X) of a point p in a space X is the smallest cardinal κ
such that: whenever p ∈A there is a B ⊆A with |B| ≤κ such that p ∈A.
For the next few questions we consider the product ω × I, the projection
π: ω × I →ω and its ˇCech-Stone-extension βπ. For p ∈ω∗we put Ip =
βπ←(p). It is not too hard to show that Ip is a continuum, and in fact a
component of the remainder of ω × I. Our ﬁrst question is:
Question 65. Are there p and q with Ip and Iq not homeomorphic?
? 264.
Ip has many cutpoints: for every f: ω →I the point fp = p−lim⟨n, f(n)⟩
is a cutpoint of Ip provided { n : f(n) ̸= 0, 1 } ∈p. The question is whether
there are any others.
Question 66. Are there cutpoints in Ip other than the points fp for f: ω →I?
? 265.
Under MAcountable such points exist, and it is conjectured that there are
none in Laver’s model (Laver [1976]) for the Borel Conjecture.
Question 67. How many subcontinua does Ip have?
? 266.
Smith [1986] and van Douwen [1977] have a few.
The next few questions come from analysis. We refer the reader to the book
by Dales and Woodin [1987] for more information on, and references for,
what follows.
It is an old problem of Kaplansky for what (if any) compact spaces X the
algebra C(X) admits an incomplete norm. For the moment call X incomplete
if C(X) does admit an incomplete norm. It is not overly diﬃcult to show
that if βω is incomplete then so is every space X. Moreover if some space is
incomplete then so is ω + 1 (the converging sequence).
The problem itself is solved to a large extent.
Dales and Esterle inde-
pendently showed that under CH the space βω—and hence every space—is
incomplete. Woodin showed that it is consistent with MA+¬CH that ω+1—
and hence every space—is not incomplete.
What remains is the following
question:

§8]
Other
117
Question 68.
If C(ω + 1) admits an incomplete norm then does C(βω) 267. ?
admit one too?
To make the question maybe a bit more managable and also to be able to
pose some more specialized problems we take the following facts from Dales
and Woodin [1987]: to begin observe that C(βω) is the same as ℓ∞. For
p ∈ω∗put Mp = { x ∈ℓ∞: p−lim x = 0 } and Ip = { x ∈ℓ∞: { n : x(n) =
0} ∈p }. The quotient algebra Mp/Ip is denoted by Ap. Now one can show
that βω is incomplete iﬀfor some p ∈ω∗the algebra Ap admits a non-trivial
seminorm. One can do a similar thing for ω+1. We write c0/p for the algebra
c0/Ip, where as usual c0 = { x ∈ℓ∞: lim x = 0}. Now ω + 1 is incomplete iﬀ
for some p ∈ω∗the algebra c0/p admits a non-trivial seminorm.
We see that if there is a p ∈ω∗such that Ap is seminormable then there is
a q ∈ω∗such that c0/q is seminormable. Problem 68 now becomes: “if c0/p
is seminormable for some p, is there a q such that Aq is seminormable?” A
stronger question is:
Question 69. If p ∈ω∗and c0/p is seminormable, is Ap seminormable?
268. ?
It would also be interesting to know the answer to the following:
Question 70. If p ∈ω∗and Ap is seminormable, is c0/p seminormable?
269. ?
Finally, to end this set, we mention a question connected to Woodin’s proof.
First we deﬁne a partial order << on the algebras Ap and c0/p: say a << b iﬀ
there is a c such that a = bc. If B is Ap or c0/p we call B weakly seminormable
iﬀthere are a nonempty downward closed—wrt. <<—subset S of B \ {0} and
a strictly increasing map of ⟨S, <<⟩into ⟨ωω, <∗⟩. It can be shown that if B is
seminormable, it is also weakly seminormable. In addition if there is a p such
that c0/p is weakly seminormable, there is also a q such that Aq is weakly
seminormable. Thus a positive answer to the following question would also
answer question 68 positively.
Question 71. If p ∈ω∗and Ap is weakly seminormable, is Ap seminormable, 270. ?
or is Aq for some other q?
We now turn to the Rudin-Frol´ık order ≤RF on ω∗, which is deﬁned as
follows: p ≤RF q iﬀthere is an embedding i: βω →βω such that i(p) = q. A
lot is known about this order but a few problems remain:
Question 72. What are the possible lengths of unbounded ≤RF-chains?
271. ?
In [1985, 1984] Butkoviˇcov´a has shown that ω1 and c+ are both possible.
Another question is related to decreasing ≤RF-chains:

118
Hart and van Mill / βω
[ch. 7
Question 73. For what cardinals κ is there a strictly decreasing chain of
? 272.
copies of βω in ω∗with a one-point intersection?
Van Douwen [1985] showed that c works. It is readily seen that for any
κ for which there is a positive answer to this question one gets a strictly
decreasing ≤RF-chain of length κ without a lower bound.
However Butkoviˇcov´a [19∞a] has shown that such chains exist for every
inﬁnite κ < c. What is needed, in case κ has uncountable coﬁnality, to produce
such a chain, is a strictly decreasing sequence ⟨Xα : α < κ⟩of copies of βω
and a point p in K = 
α<κ Xα which is not an accumulation point of any
countable discrete subset of K. Butkoviˇcov´a constructed such a sequence and
such a point directly, but one naturally wonders whether this can be done for
every sequence of copies of βω.
Question 74.
If κ ≤c has uncountable coﬁnality and if ⟨Xα : α < κ⟩is
? 273.
a strictly decreasing sequence of copies of βω with intersection K, is there
a point p in K that is not an accumulation point of any countable discrete
subset of K?
9. Uncountable Cardinals
In this section we collect some questions on ultraﬁlters on uncountable car-
dinals, and we are mainly interested in uniform ultraﬁlters here. We let κ
denote an arbitrary inﬁnite cardinal. To begin we ask whether ultraﬁlters of
small character may exist.
Question 75. Is there consistently an uncountable cardinal κ with a p ∈U(κ)
? 274.
such that χ(p) < 2κ?
Let us note that for “small” uncountable cardinals there is no easy ana-
logue of Kunen’s method mentioned above (see problem 59): to preserve the
cardinals below κ one seems to need a κ-complete ultraﬁlter, and that brings
us immediately to measurable cardinals. So we ask in particular:
Question 76. Is it consistent to have a measurable cardinal κ with a p ∈U(κ)
? 275.
such that χ(p) < 2κ?
And to stay somewhat down to earth we also ask speciﬁcally:
Question 77. Is it consistent to have a uniform ultraﬁlter on ω1 of character
? 276.
less than 2ω1 e.g., ω2?
A related and intriguing question is:

§9]
Uncountable Cardinals
119
Question 78. Is it consistent to have cardinals κ < λ with points p ∈U(κ) 277. ?
and q ∈U(λ) such that χ(p) > χ(q)?
A question with a topological background is the following:
Question 79.
If κ ≥ω is nonmeasurable and F is a countably complete 278. ?
uniform ﬁlter on κ+ then what is the cardinality of the set { u ∈U(κ+) : F ⊆
u }?
If the cardinality is 22κ+
then there are almost Lindel¨of spaces X and Y
with X × Y not even almost κ-Lindel¨of. For κ = ω the cardinality is indeed
22ω1, see Balcar and ˇStˇep´anek [1986].
The next question is purely topological. To state it we must make some
deﬁnitions. In general if A is a subset of a topological space X we let [A]<κ
denote the set { B : B ∈[A]<κ }. Furthermore if κ ⊆X ⊆βκ then βXκ
is the maximal subset of βκ for which every (continuous) f: κ →X has a
continuous extension ¯f: βXκ →X. The question is
Question 80.
Assume that κ is regular, that κ ⊆X ⊆βκ is such that 279. ?
[X]<κ = X and βXκ = X. Now if Y is a closed subspace of a power of X, is
then also X a closed subspace of a power of Y ?
The answer is yes for κ = ω, see Huˇsek and Pelant [1974] for the proof
and more information.
The following question is related to the analysis-type problems from the
previous section. If p is a (uniform) ultraﬁlter on κ then we denote by Rp
the ultrapower of R modulo the ultraﬁlter p. On it we deﬁne an equivalence
relation ≡by a ≡b iﬀthere is an n ∈N such that |a| < |nb| and |b| < |na|,
here < is the natural linear order of Rp. The equivalence classes under ≡are
called the Archimedean classes of Rp. The question is whether the cardinality
of Rp can be larger than the cardinality of Rp/ ≡, speciﬁcally:
Question 81. Are there κ and p ∈U(κ) such that |Rp| > |Rp/ ≡| = c?
280. ?
Dales and Woodin have shown that a positive answer is consistent relative
to the existence of a large cardinal.
We ﬁnish with two questions about ω1.
Question 82. Is there a C∗-embedded bi-Bernstein set in U(ω1)?
281. ?
A bi-Bernstein set is a set X such that X and its complement intersect
every uncountable closed subset of U(ω1).

Question 83. Are there open sets G1 and G2 in U(ω1) such that G1 ∩G2

For a decade now, the problem in the title has held a special fascination for
me. It is a problem that can be approached on many levels and from many
angles, and has led me and others oﬀon numerous unexpected tangents.
Before getting into that, a word about separation axiom: all through this
paper “space” will mean “Hausdorﬀspace”, but for ﬁrst countable, countably
compact spaces this implies regularity as well (Engelking [1977, p.398]).
For T1 spaces there is an easy example: reﬁne the coﬁnite topology on ω1 by
declaring initial segments to be open. It is the extra separation axiom that
makes the title problem so diﬃcult.
Set-theoretically, it has a strange dual personality. On the one hand, the
construction of examples under CH is one of the easiest of all consistency
results in topology; so easy that when Mary Ellen Rudin performed it in the
early 60’s, she did not bother to publish it, and even now I do not know
whether her construction was the ﬁrst. On the other hand, unless there is a
clever ZFC construction, we still do not seem to have the proper machinery
for solving it. It is one of a handful of problems (of which the normality of
2ωω + 1 is the best known) for which we have aﬃrmative answers if either
c = ℵ1 or c = ℵ2. Most of the sophisticated forcing construction nowadays
give these values to the continuum, and while there has been growing interest
in “mixed supports”, which does give interesting new models of c ≥ℵ3, little
of it has been directed towards the “no man’s land” of the title problem.
These are the models where ω1 < p and b < c (notation explained later).
Even today our supply of such models is quite meager, especially of models
of ω1 < p and b < d, from where a negative answer to the title question
(if indeed there is one) is most likely to come. I will however describe one
towards the end of this article.
Topologically, the problem has many “relatives”, some of which I described
in a 1986 survey paper (Nyikos [1988b]) for the proceedings of the Sixth
Prague Topological Symposium. Here we will mostly be concerned with “sub-
problems”: problems which ask for the construction of special kinds of spaces
as in the title. For example, it is not known whether one can always construct
locally compact or locally countable ones; in fact, we do not (although perhaps
we ought to) know whether the problem is made any harder by imposing these
extra conditions. (At present, it actually appears harder to construct exam-
ples that do not satisfy them!) On the other hand, here are some problems
where the diﬃculties seem genuinely diﬀerent:
Problem 1. Is there a separable, countably compact, noncompact manifold? 283. ?
Most of our current diﬃculty with Problem 1 is embodied in:
Problem 2. Is it consistent that there is a countably compact manifold of 284. ?

Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
In Nyikos [1982] and [1984] I emphasized those aspects of the theory of
nonmetrizable manifolds where there was a parallelism with the theory of
locally compact, locally countable spaces; but Problem 2 is one place where
extra “geometric” diﬃculties with manifolds disrupt our analogies.
To theory of ultraﬁlters ﬁgures prominently in another problem, which
seems to be the special case of “the Scarborough-Stone problem” in which
they seemed to be most interested (Scarborough and Stone [1966, Foot-
note 1]):
Problem 3. Is countable compactness productive for ﬁrst countable spaces?
? 285.
Here we have negative answers in all models of b = c (van Douwen [1984,
Example 13.1]), and in an assortment of models of p = ω1 (Nyikos and
Vaughan [1987]), though by no means all. In one way it is a special case of
the title problem: if there is a model where all separable, countably compact,
ﬁrst countable spaces are compact, then in that model we have an aﬃrmative
solution to Problem 3. (See the discussion following Problem 7 below.)
Two other problems have more to do with the nature of CH than with
topology, but I felt they are important enough to have oﬀered cash prizes in
the 1986 survey for their solution:
Problem 4.
Call a space an Ostaszewski space if it is locally compact,
? 286.
locally countable, countably compact, noncompact, and every open set is
either countable or co-countable. Is CH alone enough to imply the existence
of an Ostaszewski space? ($200 for yes, $50 for no.)
As is well known, an Ostaszewski space is perfectly normal: normality
comes from the fact that, of any of two disjoint closed sets, one is compact. It
is also hereditarily separable: it is scattered, and every subspace has countably
many (relatively) isolated points, which are dense in the space. (Scattered-
ness, which means that every nonempty subspace has at least one (relatively)
isolated point, follows easily from local compactness and local countability.)
Problem 5. Is CH consistent with the statement that every perfectly nor-
? 287.
mal, countably compact space is compact? ($100 either way.)
Back in [1977], Shelah wrote that he had been trying to convince oth-
ers of the importance of obtaining MA-like principles compatible with CH.
He gave one such, a 2-coloring axiom known as “Shelah’s principle”. How-
ever, this axiom is compatible with ♦and is thus not suitable for a negative
answer to Problem 4, nor a positive answer to Problem 5. In [1982, p.237]
Shelah gives a more complicated axiom which is compatible with CH and
implies all Aronszajn trees are special (Shelah [1982, p.241]). C. Schlindwein

has conjectured this axiom will give a negative answer to Problem 4 and an
aﬃrmative one to Problem 5.
As for the title problem, I have oﬀered (Nyikos [1988b]) $500 for a solution
by August of 1996. In a way, this is a bet that the problem will still be around
then; but it is a bet I would not mind losing.
The foregoing introduction only begins to explain why I am fascinated by
these problems. I hope that by the end of this article, I will have been able
to share this fascination with many readers.
1. Topological background
The title problem can be rephrased and extended using the following concepts.
1.1. Definition. A space is (strongly) ω-bounded if every countable (resp.
σ-compact) subset has compact closure.
One obviously has: strongly ω-bounded ⇒ω-bounded ⇒countably com-
pact.
Problem 6. Is it consistent that every ﬁrst countable, countably compact 288. ?
space is strongly ω-bounded?
If one omits “strongly” from this question, one has the negative version of
the title problem. There is some question about whether the two are actually
equivalent:
Problem 7. Is every ω-bounded, ﬁrst countable space strongly ω-bounded? 289. ?
An aﬃrmative answer to Problem 7 in ZFC has been claimed by a Yugoslav
topologist, but this claim has not been conﬁrmed.
An easy corollary of the Tikhonov theorem is that the class of ω-bounded
spaces and the class of strongly ω-bounded spaces are both productive. Thus if
Problem 6, or its variant with “strongly” dropped, has an aﬃrmative solution,
then it is consistent that Problem 3 does also.
For a deeper understanding of the title problem, one must know about
Property wD:
1.2. Definition. A space X satisﬁes Property wD if for every inﬁnite closed
discrete subspace D of X there is an inﬁnite D′ ⊂D which expands to a
discrete collection of open sets, i.e. there is a discrete family { Ud : d ∈D′ } of
open sets such that Ud ∩D′ = {d} for all d ∈D′. A space X satisﬁes Property
D if every countable closed discrete subspace expands to a discrete collection
of open sets.
Countably compact spaces satisfy Property D (and a fortiori Property wD)
by default. But much more importantly:

132
Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
1.3. Theorem.
Every ﬁrst countable, countably compact space satisﬁes
Property wD hereditarily.
Proof. Let X be ﬁrst countable and countably compact, and let Y ⊂X. If
Y has an inﬁnite closed discrete subspace D, then there is a point p ∈X \ Y
and a sequence ⟨di⟩→p from D. Let {Un}∞
n=1 be a local base at p, with
U1 = X and (by regularity of X) Un+1 ⊂Un for all n. For each di we pick an
open neighborhood Vi which is a subset of every Un containing di and missing
the ﬁrst (hence every) Um which does not contain di; and by induction we can
easily arrange for the Vi to be disjoint. Then {Vi}∞
i=1 is a discrete collection.
Every ﬁrst countable, separable, countably compact noncompact space that
has been constructed in one model or another, has always been built up by
induction beginning with some well-known separable, ﬁrst countable, non-
compact space and successively adding limit points to kill oﬀinﬁnite closed
discrete subspaces. It seems very likely that this will continue to be the only
means of producing these spaces. If so, then it is absolutely essential to be
able to insure that the intermediate subspaces satisfy wD hereditarily.
Now wD is a comparatively weak property; for instance, every realcompact
space satisﬁes it (Vaughan [1978]). It is therefore nice to know (Gillman
and Jerison [1960, 8.15]) that every ﬁrst countable, realcompact space is
hereditarily realcompact. True, a countably compact, realcompact space is
compact (Gillman and Jerison [1960, 5H]) but that need not discourage
us: we might still have a construction where the intermediate spaces are
(hereditarily) realcompact, while the ﬁnal space is not.
In fact, most of the CH constructions to date have actually built up the ﬁnal
space Xω1 as the union of an ascending sequence ⟨Xα : α < ω1 ⟩of metrizable
spaces, often countable ones. All known countably compact manifolds can be
built up like this, because (see Problem 2) they are all of weight ≤ℵ1, hence
the union of ≤ℵ1 open metrizable, second countable subspaces. However,
in some models the examples have to be “bigger”than this, and we still have
little understanding of how to maintain hereditary realcompactness at and
beyond the ω1st step.
For Property wD we have some good general reasults under certain set-
theoretic hypotheses. We give some of these in Section 3. They come under
the general strategy of “keeping everything nice until stage c”. The other
general strategy with which we have had a little success is “ﬁnishing up the
construction quickly”. This will be used in the following section, and part of
the time in Section 4.
2. The γN construction.
In [1970], Franklin and Rajagopalan gave a simple example of a space as
in the title, under a precise set-theoretic hypothesis. Their hypothesis, and

§2]
The γN construction.
133
also the construction, were phrased in terms of the Stone-ˇCech remainder N∗
of the discrete space N of positive integers.
Here we give a more elementary set-theoretic treatment. The hypothesis
can be stated in one of two equivalent forms: p = ω1 and t = ω1. Recall:
p = min{ |a| : a is a subbase for a ﬁlter of inﬁnite subsets of ω,
such that if B ⊂∗A for all A ∈a, then B is ﬁnite }
Here we use B ⊂∗A to mean that B \ A is ﬁnite and A \ B is inﬁnite.
One obtains the deﬁnition of t by restricting the subbase a to be totally
ordered by ⊂∗. Obviously, p ≤t; the question of whether equality holds is
probably the most basic unsolved problem relating to the “small uncountable
cardinals” of Hechler [1972] and van Douwen [1984]. A simple “diagonal”
argument shows p is uncountable, and Rothberger showed in [1948] that
p = ω1 implies t = ω1 (the converse is trivial); proofs of this and many other
facts cited here about p, t, b, and d may be found in van Douwen [1984].
See also J. Vaughan’s article.
The Franklin-Rajagopalan example was a countably compact version (which
exists iﬀt = ω1) of γN:
2.1. Notation. γN is the generic symbol for any locally compact space X
in which N is a dense set of isolated points, and X \ N is homeomorphic to ω1
with the order topology.
We use a deﬁnition of N that makes it disjoint from ω1, so that we will
identify γN\ N with ω1. The following is a recipe for constructing all versions
of γN.
2.2. Example. Let ⟨Aα : α ∈ω1 ⟩be a ⊂∗-ascending sequence of inﬁnite
subsets of N. (An easy “diagonal” argument allows one to construct such a
sequence in ZFC.) Set A−1 = ∅. On the set N ∪ω1, we impose the topology
which has sets of the form {n} (n ∈N) and Un(β, α] (n ∈N, β ∈ω1 ∪{−1},
α ∈ω1) as a base, where (β, α] means { γ ∈ω1 : β < γ ≤α } and
Un(β, α] = (β, α] ∪(Aα \ Aβ) \ {1, . . . , n}
where
{1, . . . , n} ⊂N.
It is easy to show by induction that U1(−1, α] is compact for each α and
hence N ∪ω1 with this topology is locally compact. Since Aα \ Aβ is inﬁnite
whenever β < α, the points of ω1 are nonisolated, hence N is dense. Thus
this gives a γN.
Conversely, given any γN and α < ω1, we can use regularity of γN and
compactness of [0, α] to put [0, α] and [α + 1, ω1) into disjoint open sets Uα
and V respectively. Then Uα (and also V ) will be closed as well, and we may
as well assume Uα is compact. Let Aα = Uα ∩N. Then it is routine to show
that ⟨Aα : α ∈ω1 ⟩is ⊂∗-ascending and that the topology imposed on N ∪ω1
by the above recipe is the one we started out with.

134
Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
Since every point of γN has a compact, countable neighborhood, γN is ﬁrst
countable. Of course, it is separable and noncompact.
2.3. Observation.
γN is countably compact if, and only if, no inﬁnite
subset of N is almost disjoint from all the Aα.
(Two sets are said to be
almost disjoint if their intersection is ﬁnite.) The existence of a ⊂∗-ascending
sequence ⟨Aα : α < ω1 ⟩of subsets of N, such that no inﬁnite subset of N is
almost disjoint from all Aα, is equivalent to t = ω1.
At the present time, models of t = ω1 are the rule rather than the exception.
Of course, CH implies t = ω1; but also, the addition of uncountably many
Cohen, or random, or Sacks, Laver, Mathias, Miller, Prikry-Silver or Matet
reals to any model of set theory will also give a model of t = ω1. At the present
state of the art, one almost has to list all possible ⊂∗-ascending ω1-sequences
of subsets of N and force to extend them, as in the construction of models of
MA, to get t > ω1. And then one must make an eﬀort to avoid having b = c,
which follows from MA and allows the construction in the following section.
Before that, here is a ﬁnal series of observations about γN. What makes
ﬁrst countability possible is that it stops where it does. Using an ascending
τ-sequence where τ > ω1 is perfectly feasible and one can use it to construct
“nice” ZFC examples of locally compact, normal spaces, some of them sequen-
tially compact, as in the case of δN in Franklin and Rajagopalan [1970]
and various examples of δN in Nyikos and Vaughan [1987]. But of course,
such spaces will not be ﬁrst countable if they simply mimic the deﬁnition in
Example 2.2. One can attempt to salvage ﬁrst countability by leaving out the
ordinals < τ of uncountable coﬁnality, but then one loses countable compact-
ness unless one had it for N ∪ω1 to begin with. There are ways of modifying
the construction further in some models of set theory, but they involve extra
work. See Section 5.
3. The Ostaszewski-van Douwen construction.
In 1973, Ostaszewski revolutionized set-theoretic topology by introducing an
extremely simple and powerful technique of building locally compact spaces
by transﬁnite induction. Assuming the axiom ♦, he used it to construct what
we called an Ostaszewski space in the introduction (Problem 4). The basic
building block of the technique is given by (2) →(1) in:
3.1. Lemma. Let X be a ﬁrst countable, locally compact, zero-dimensional
(that is, it has a base of clopen sets) space, and let D be a closed discrete
subspace of X. The following are equivalent.
(1) There is a ﬁrst countable, locally compact, zero-dimensional space Y
containing X in which D has a cluster point.
(2) There is an inﬁnite subset of D which expands to a discrete collection
of open subsets of X.

§3]
The Ostaszewski-van Douwen construction.
135
Proof. (1) →(2). As in 1.3.
(2) →(1). By local compactness, we may take the sets in the collection to
be compact and open, and the collection to be countable. Add a point y to
X and let Y = X ∪{y}. A base for the topology on Y consists of all open
subsets of X, together with all sets obtained by taking the union of {y} with
the union of all but ﬁnitely many members of the discrete collection.
Eric van Douwen ﬁne-tuned the technique to give a recipe (3.3 below) for
building all spaces of the following kind:
3.2. Definition. A space is an Ostaszewski-van Douwen space if it is locally
countable, regular, countably compact, noncompact, and separable.
One could also write “ﬁrst countable” or “locally compact” in place of
“regular” and have equivalent deﬁnitions. On the one hand, as pointed out at
the beginning of this article, every ﬁrst countable, countably compact space is
regular, and of course so is every locally compact space. On the other hand,
regularity plus countable compactness implies the existence of a local base,
at each point, of countably compact neighborhoods; when local countability
is added, local compactness follows, and with it ﬁrst countability.
Like the subclass of Ostaszewski spaces, Ostaszewski-van Douwen spaces
are scattered, and every locally compact scattered space, as well as every
Tikhonov space that is of cardinality < c, is zero-dimensional.
It is not known whether an Ostaszewski-van Douwen space exists in ZFC;
if one does, then the title problem would be solved by what has been written.
The following recipe thus has an optimistic hypothesis built into it at each
stage, one that we do not know how to guarantee in ZFC: the hypothesis is
that the space constructed up to that point satisﬁes wD (1.2). This hypothesis
does follow under various extra axioms, one of which is discussed after the
construction.
3.3. Construction. Let { Aα : α < c } list all countably inﬁnite subsets
of c.
Let ω be given the discrete topology.
For α ≥ω, α < c, assume
there is deﬁned on each inﬁnite β < α a locally compact, locally countable,
noncompact topology, with the relative topology on γ < β the same as the
one deﬁned on γ. If α is a limit ordinal, let the topology on α be that whose
base is the union of all bases on earlier β. In particular, β will be open in α,
and the induction hypothesis continues to hold for α + 1 in place of α.
If α = β + 1, we assume in addition that the topology on β satisﬁes wD.
Let Bα be the Aξ of smallest index which is a closed discrete subspace of
β. (If there is none, then β is countably compact and we are done.) Let Cα
be an inﬁnite, co-inﬁnite subset of Bα which can be expanded to a discrete
collection of open sets Uc (c ∈Cα) as in the deﬁnition of wD. Choose each
Uc so that it is compact and misses Bα \ Cα.
We make β the extra point in the one-point compactiﬁcation of { Uc : c ∈
Uα }. In other words, we deﬁne the topology on α = β +1 = β ∪{β} as in the

136
Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
proof of (2) →(1) in 3.1, with β playing the roles of both X (as a set) and
y (as a point). Then all the induction hypotheses are satisﬁed for α + 1 in
place of α. In particular, noncompactness follows from the fact that Bα \ Cα
is closed discrete, and wD because it cannot be destroyed in a regular space
by the addition of a single point.
This inductive construction either stops with wD violated at some limit or-
dinal, or else at some limit ordinal α ≤c, necessarily of uncountable coﬁnality,
where α is countably compact but not compact. By induction it follows that
ω is dense in α, so that in this latter case we have an Ostaszewski-van Dou-
wen space. In particular, if the construction continues to stage c, the resulting
space is countably compact because every countable subspace is a subset of
some α < c, and if it is closed discrete in α, it will eventually become the
least Aξ considered at some stage γ < c unless it acquires a limit point in the
meantime.
The construction cannot stop before stage p, because every regular, sepa-
rable, countably compact space of Lindel¨of number < p is compact (Hech-
ler [1975] and Nyikos [1982]), and because of the fact that p ≤b and
Theorem 3.7 below. However, it can stop at stage p even in models of p < b
(Nyikos [19∞b]).
This construction was independently arrived at by M. Rajagopalan in a
heavily disguised form. This is the V -process of Rajagopalan [1976], which
is done in βω. In particular, “Lemma 1.4” of Rajagopalan [1976] is the
hypothesis that the space constructed up to that point satisﬁes wD.
How can we insure that wD is never violated during the construction? One
way is to assume our universe satisﬁes b = c.
3.4. Definition. Given functions f, g: ω →ω, write f <∗g to mean there
exists n such that f(k) < g(k) for all k > n.
b = min{ |F| :
F is a <∗-unbounded (“undominated”) subset of ωω }
d = min{ |F| :
F is a <∗-coﬁnal (“dominating”) subset of ωω }
Obviously, b ≤d ≤c. It is also known (van Douwen [1984]) that t ≤b.
It may not be immediately obvious what relevance these concepts have to
property wD, so let’s think a little about how that property might be violated.
The spaces in the above construction are all regular, so that an elementary
induction allows us to expand any countable closed discrete subspace D to a
disjoint collection U = { Ud : d ∈D } of open sets, with Vd ∩D = {d}. Now if
U is not discrete, the points that witness this (in others words, the points x
such that every neighborhood of x meets inﬁnitely many members of U) are
outside  U and can even be assumed (by another application of regularity)
to be outside { U : U ∈U }. If we shrink the open sets still further, we
do not add new witnesses and may kill oﬀsome. That is, if U ′
d ⊂Ud for all
d ∈D, and every neighborhood of x meets inﬁnitely many U ′
d, then every

§3]
The Ostaszewski-van Douwen construction.
137
neighborhood of x meets inﬁnitely many Ud, but not necessarily conversely.
Using regularity, it is easy to kill oﬀany single witness or even any countable
set of witnesses by a judicious shrinkage of the Ud.
This shrinkage is coded using (ωω, <∗) in the proof of 3.7 below, whose idea
is essentially van Douwen’s. First we recall:
3.5. Definition. A space X is pseudonormal if, whenever F1 and F2 are
disjoint closed sets, one of which is countable, then there are disjoint open
subsets Ui such that Fi ⊂Ui for i = 1, 2.
3.6. Proposition. Every pseudonormal space is regular and satisﬁes Prop-
erty D.
Proof. Regularity is obvious, so that if D is a closed discrete subspace, it can
be expanded to a disjoint open collection U = { Ud : d ∈D }. Let V and U
be disjoint open sets containing D and the complement of  U, respectively.
Then { V ∩Ud : d ∈D } is a discrete open expansion of D.
3.7. Theorem. Every regular, ﬁrst countable space of Lindel¨of number < b
is pseudonormal.
Proof. Let X be as in the hypothesis and let D and F be closed subspaces
of X, with D = ⟨dn : n ∈ω ⟩. Assign to each d ∈D a nested countable local
base, Un+1(d) ⊂Un(d) for all n ∈ω, such that the closure of U0(d) misses F.
Assign to each x ∈F an open Vx ∋x such that V x misses D, and a function
fx: ω →ω such that Ufx(n)(dn) misses Vx.
Claim.
If fx <∗g, then no point of F ∩Vx is in the closure of U =
{ Ug(n)(dn) : n ∈ω }.
Once the claim is proven, let F ′ ⊂F be a set of cardinality < b, such that
{ Vx : x ∈F ′ } covers F. Let g ∈ωω be such that fx <∗g for all x ∈F ′.
Then U and X \ U are disjoint open sets containing D and F, respectively.
Proof of claim.
Let k be such that fx(n) < g(n) for all n ≥k. Then
{ Ug(n)(dn) : n ≥k } misses Vx, hence so does its closure, and the closure
of { Ug(n)d(n) : n < k } misses F.
3.8. Corollary (van Douwen [1984, 12.2]). Every regular, ﬁrst countable
space of cardinality < b satisﬁes Property D.
Hence if b = c, every initial stage of Construction 3.3 satisﬁes wD, and we
have:
3.9. Corollary (van Douwen). If b = c, there is an Ostaszewski-van Dou-
wen space.
3.10. Observation. The proof of 3.7 goes through if we replace countability
of D by the hypothesis that D is the union of countably many closed sub-
sets Dn, each of which has a countable family U of closed neighborhoods such

138
Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
that every neighborhood of Dn contains some member of U. Such is the case,
for example, if D is a σ-compact subset of a locally metrizable space.
We will use this observation in 6.
Now we show that any Ostaszewski-van Douwen space X can be produced
by Construction 3.3. Since X is scattered, it can be well-ordered, X = { xξ :
ξ < τ }, so that every initial segment is open, and so that { xn : n ∈ω }
is the set of all isolated points.
Also, since |X| ≤c (by separability and
ﬁrst countability) X has a base of countable, compact open sets, we can take
τ = |X| ≤c. For instance, ﬁrst take an arbitrary well-ordered { yα : α < τ }
where { yn : n ∈ω } is the set of all isolated points. Let xn = yn for all n ∈ω,
and if Xα has been deﬁned, let ξ be the least ordinal such that yξ ∈Xα.
Let K be a countable clopen neighborhood of yξ, and well-order K \ Xα so
that initial segments are open, K \ Xα = { xα+η : η < δ } for some countable
ordinal δ. This deﬁnes Xα+δ, and yξ ∈Xα+δ, and the induction can continue.
The whole space will be used up exactly at stage τ.
Now if α ≥ω, then xα is in the closure of Xα. Let { Vn : n ∈ω } be a
strictly decreasing local base at xα, consisting of countable, compact open
subsets of Xα+1 = Xα ∪{xα}. Let Dα
n = Vn \ Vn+1. Then { Dα
n : n ∈ω } is
a family of disjoint countable compact open sets, discrete in Xα. Since τ is a
limit ordinal, Xα+1 still has inﬁnite closed discrete subspaces.
It follows that X could have been obtained by Construction 3.3. All it takes
is a fortuitous choice of { Aα : α < c }. For example, for each α < τ we can
carefully pick Aωα to be a choice set for { Dω+α
n
: n ∈ω }, while if γ = ωα+m
(0 < m < ω) then we can pick Aγ to be a subset of Xα+1 which is not closed
discrete.
Precisely because of its complete generality, Construction 3.3 tells next to
nothing about the inner structure of the spaces constructed. In fact, it can
just as easily be a recipe for disaster. If there is a separable, locally compact,
locally countable space of cardinality < c which does not satisfy wD, it too
can be constructed by 3.3; the argument just given goes through. Of course,
if p = ω1, we can cleverly choose { Aα : α < c } and the expansions so as
to arrive at a countably compact γN by stage ω1. What we do not have at
present, and may never have, is an equally clever choice for higher values of
p.
Lacking these choices, we can always try imposing some extra structure on
the construction in the hope that Property wD will somehow continue to hold
until we arrive at a countably compact space. The V -process, as described in
Rajagopalan [1976], has an extra parameter involving the topology on βω.
Unfortunately, no new way of insuring the wD property has emerged from it
to date.
This is also the case with the technique of Nyikos [19∞b], which works
smoothly if one assumes wD at each stage of the construction but which
cannot guarantee it.
This technique makes the remainder (set of noniso-

139
lated points) a clopen subspace of some prefabricated locally compact, locally
countable, ω-bounded space Y of cardinality c. (Under CH, for instance, one
could take Y = ω1 and wind up with γN.) The existence of such Y is a modest
requirement: to negate it, one must assume the existence of inner models with
measurable cardinals. The construction begins with the discrete space ω and
proceeds by tearing oﬀcountable clopen chunks from Y and attaching them
to the subspace built from the earlier chunks. To play devil’s advocate: one
could just be pulling down isolated singletons from Y for the ﬁrst b stages,
and then be stuck with the following space.
3.11. Example (van Douwen [1984, 12.2]). Let ⟨fα : α < b ⟩be a <∗-
unbounded, <∗-wellordered family of increasing functions from ω to ω. Let
X be a space whose underlying set is ω × (ω + 1) ∪{ {fα} : α < b } where the
relative topology on ω × (ω + 1) is the usual one, and a neighborhood of {fα}
is any subset of x which contains {fα} together with a coﬁnite subset of fα.
Then X is locally compact, locally countable, separable, and fails to satisfy
wD since no inﬁnite subset of ω × {ω} can be expanded to a discrete open
collection. So X cannot be embedded in a ﬁrst countable, countably compact
space.
Other inductive constructions of separable, ﬁrst countable, countably com-
pact noncompact spaces can get stuck through having something like 3.11
embedded as a subspace. For instance, one can modify 3.3 to produce spaces
in which every point has a clopen neighborhood homeomorphic to the Cantor
set 2ω. All it takes is to start out with 2ω × ω and then follow 3.3, with the
diﬀerence that the subspace at stage α has underlying set (2ω × ω) ∪[ω, α)
in place of [0, α) = α. As long as b = c everything is OK, because the Lin-
del¨of number at initial stages is < b, but otherwise, what is to keep 3.11
from creeping in and ruining wD? A slim chance is tendered by the fact that
this modiﬁcation of 3.3 is not the only recipe for constructing ﬁrst countable,
separable, countably compact, noncompact spaces which are locally homeo-
morphic to 2ω. In the successor stages, we can take advantage of the fact
that { Uc : c ∈Cα } is homeomorphic to any dense proper open subset of
the Cantor set, and compactify it accordingly. If we are not interested in
local homogeneity, this idea can easily be modiﬁed using any ﬁrst countable,
zero-dimensional compact spaces.
This may be the place to mention a friendly debate I had with van Douwen
before van Douwen [1984] was in ﬁnal form. His 12.2 is as general as he
ever got along the lines of Theorem 3.7 above: he used cardinality in place
of Lindel¨of degree. When I pointed out that this extra generality could be
obtained with just minor changes in the proof, he responded that he could
see no new application for the extra generality. (I never did mention 3.10 to
him, but his response would probably have been the same.)
In a certain sense he was correct: the constructions outlined just now have
not, to date, given us solutions to the title problem in any model except

140

[ch. 8
the ones where Ostaszewski-van Douwen spaces are known to occur. Similar
constructions of manifolds (Section 6) have fared even worse so far. Still, 3.7
does make these other constructions possible under b = c, and that seemed
justiﬁcation enough to me.
4. The “dominating reals” constructions.
For almost ten years, the models in which separable, ﬁrst countable, countably
compact noncompact spaces were known to live all satisﬁed either p = ω1 or
b = c.
Then it was noticed by Juh´asz, Shelah and Soukup in [1988],
and by Nyikos in [19∞a] that the addition of dominating reals is at least
as eﬀective in producing pseudonormality as having Lindel¨of number < b.
Moreover, the arguments are so similar that the construction in this section
should have been discovered much earlier.
4.1. Definition. Let M be a model of ZFC. A function g: ω →ω is domi-
nating over M or a dominating real over M if f <∗g for all f ∈ωω ∩M.
There are many forcing constructions of dominating reals over a given model
M. A very simple ccc method is in Baumgartner and Dordal [1985]. Also,
any time one begins with a model M of d = κ and uses ccc forcing to produce
a model of MA + c > κ, one necessarily adds dominating reals to M.
4.2. Lemma. Let Mα be a transitive model of ZFC and let Mβ be a transitive
submodel of Mα satisfying ZFC, such that in Mα there is a dominating real
over Mβ. If X is a regular ﬁrst countable space with base B, and D and F
are disjoint closed subsets of X in Mβ with D countable, then in Mα there
are disjoint open sets U and V in the topology whose base is B, such that
D ⊂U, F ⊂V .
Proof. Let ⟨dn : n ∈ω ⟩∈Mβ be a listing of D as in the proof of 3.7, and
deﬁne U(d) = ⟨Un(d) : n ∈ω ⟩as in that proof, so that ⟨U(d) : d ∈D ⟩∈Mβ.
Also deﬁne ⟨Vx : x ∈F ⟩∈Mβ as in that proof.
Let g ∈Mα be a dominating over Mβ. Continue to follow the proof of 3.7,
except to have F ′ = F and omitting the condition |F ′| < b. Then no element
of F is in the closure of { Ug(n)(dn) : n ∈ω } = U, and U is an element of
Mα by the axioms of replacement and union. Let V = X \ U.
4.3. Corollary. If Mα, Mβ, X, B, and D are as in 4.2, and D is discrete,
then in Mα there is a discrete family of open sets expanding D.
Proof. Back in Mβ, let ⟨U(d) : d ∈D ⟩be a disjoint open expansion, and
let F = X \ { U(d) : d ∈D }. Then F ∈Mβ, and if U is as in 4.2, then
{ U ∩U(d) : d ∈D } is in Mα and is a discrete expansion of D.
An interesting consequence of 4.3 is that if X ∈Mβ is a ﬁrst countable,
pseudocompact space that is not countably compact, then in Mα it loses its

§4]
The “dominating reals” constructions.
141
pseudocompactness. On the other hand, a ﬁrst countable, countably compact
space might retain its countable compactness (and hence its pseudocompact-
ness). For example, in Baumgartner and Dordal [1985] there are models
Mβ and Mα as in 4.2, with CH holding in Mβ, such that any countably
compact γN in Mβ remains countably compact in Mα.
This follows from
Baumgartner and Dordal [1985, Corollary 3.4] and Observation 2.3. More
generally, the question of whether a proper forcing preserves an Ostaszewski-
van Douwen space in which the subspace of nonisolated points is ω-bounded,
reduces to the question of whether new closed discrete subspaces arise inside
the subspace of isolated points. (See comments following the proof of 4.4 be-
low.) There are some structural results about ideals in Nyikos [19∞b] which
might help with this reduced question.
At the opposite extreme, there is a construction, assuming b = c, of an
Ostaszewski-van Douwen space which is destroyed by the addition of any
real: a separable, locally compact, locally countable quasi-perfect preimage of
[0, 1] has this property because there is nothing “above” the added real, and
Example 13.4 of van Douwen [1984] has all these properties when X = [0, 1],
except for separability. However, the closure of the isolated points over Q has
all the desired properties.
Also, many people have independently observed that an Ostaszewski space
(Problem 4) cannot be destroyed by the addition of Cohen reals, although
Fremlin has an example (unpublished) of one that is destroyed by the addition
of a single random real.
As our insight into the title problem continues to deepen, it will probably
become increasingly important to know what sorts of forcing preserve what
sorts of ﬁrst countable, countably compact spaces. This theme will be taken
up after the proof of the following theorem, and also in the last section.
4.4. Theorem. Let M be a transitive model of ZFC with a sequence ⟨Mα :
α < κ ⟩, of transitive submodels, each satisfying ZFC, such that Mβ ⊂Mα
whenever α < κ, and
(i) For each A ∈M, ⟨A ∩Mα : α < κ ⟩∈M.
(ii) M |= κ is a limit ordinal of uncountable coﬁnality.
(iii) Each countable set of ordinals in M is in Mα and countable in Mα for
some α ∈κ.
(iv) If β < α, then Mα has a dominating real over Mβ.
Then there is an Ostaszewski-van Douwen space in M. Moreover, if α < κ
and X ∈Mα is a locally compact, locally countable space with base B, then
in M there is a locally compact, locally countable, countably compact space
containing X such that the relative topology on X has base B.
Proof. If Mα ∩P(ω) is countable in M for all α, then by (iii) M satisﬁes
CH and the ﬁrst conclusion holds. So suppose Mα ∩P(ω) is uncountable
in M for some α, and let a be a maximal almost disjoint (MAD) family of

142
Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
inﬁnite subsets of ω in Mα (that is, it is maximal in Mα; in Mα+1 it will lose
its maximality!) of cardinality c in Mα. Let Xα ∈Mα be the Ψ-space based
on a; that is, its points are elements of ω ∪a, and basic neighborhoods of
A ∈a are coﬁnite subsets of A ∪{A} which include the point A.
Then Xα is locally compact, locally countable, and uncountable in M, and
ω is a dense subspace. Once we prove the “moreover” part, and Y is any
locally compact, locally countable, countably compact space containing Xα,
then the closure of Xα in Y will be an Ostaszewski-van Douwen space; in
particular, it will be noncompact since it is uncountable.
So let X be as in the “moreover” part. We may assume the underlying set
of X is some ordinal λα. In M, let ⪯be a well-ordering of a “suﬃciently
large” set in M (to include as elements sets of every kind deﬁned below; one
can run through the argument to establish just how large to make the set).
Whenever a set in M is deﬁned in the sequel, we assume it is the ⪯-ﬁrst
member of its kind, so as to make the space we construct be a member of M.
Let ⟨Dξ : ξ ∈γα ⟩be a one-to-one listing in Mα of an almost disjoint family
of countably inﬁnite closed discrete subspaces of Xα = X, such that every
countably inﬁnite closed discrete subspace of Xα in Mα meets some Dξ in an
inﬁnite set. Let ⟨Vx : x ∈X ⟩be a listing in Mα of local bases Vx at each
x, with Vx = ⟨Vn(x) : n ∈ω ⟩being nested (i.e. Vn+1(x) ⊂Vn(x) for all n,x)
and each Vn(x) compact open, hence countable.
Claim. In Mα+1, there is a family ⟨Uξ : ξ ∈γα ⟩of discrete expansions, Uξ
a discrete expansion of Dξ to a family of Vn(x)’s, such that if ξ ̸= η, then at
most ﬁnitely many intersections U ∩V with U ∈Uξ, V ∈Uη, are nonempty.
Once the claim is proven, let Xα+1 = X ∪(λα + γα), with a local base at
λα + ξ being all sets of the form {λα + ξ} ∪( Uξ) \  F, where F ⊂Uξ
is ﬁnite. Then Xα+1 ∈Mα+1, and Xα+1 is a locally compact and locally
countable.
Proof of Claim. Let ⟨hξ : ξ ∈γα ⟩∈Mα be a set of bijections hξ: ω →Dξ.
For each ξ, η ∈γα, let fξη: ω →ω be such that Vfξη(n)(h(n)) does not meet
Vfηξ(m)(hη(m)) unless hξ(n) = hη(m); do this so that ⟨fξη : ξ, η ∈γα ⟩is in
Mα. Now if g: ω →ω is dominating over Mα, and ξ, η ∈γα, let m be such that
hξ(k) and hη(j) are distinct for all j, k ≥m and fξη(k), fξξ(k), fηη(k) and
fηξ(k) are all less than g(k) for k ≥m. Then Vg(j)(hσ(j)) and Vg(k)(hτ(k))
are disjoint for all j, k ≥m and for all choices of σ, τ ∈{ξ, η} except for σ = τ
and j = k. Hence if we take g ∈Mα+1 and let
Uξ = { Vg(n)(hξ(n)) : n ∈ω }
for all ξ < γα, then the Uξ’s satisfy all the properties in the claim. (Discrete-
ness can be veriﬁed as in the proof of 4.2 and 4.3 using the fact that each
Vn(xn) is closed as well as open, or one could apply 4.3 directly to shrink Uξ
further to a discrete expansion, all within Mα+1.) End of proof of Claim.
Now we can repeat the argument for Mα+1 and Mα+2 in place of Mα and

§4]
The “dominating reals” constructions.
143
Mα+1, letting λα+1 = λα + γα, and otherwise just changing the subscripts.
The general step in going from any Mγ to Mγ+1, to produce Xγ+1, is the
same. If γ is a limit ordinal, let λγ = sup{ λβ : β < γ } and let the topology
on Xγ = λγ be the one whose base is the union of the bases on the preceding
Xβ’s. Then Y = Xκ is the desired space. It is certainly locally compact and
locally countable, and by induction it even has Xα as a dense subspace. If A
is a countably inﬁnite subset of Xκ, then by (ii) and (iii) there exists γ < κ
such that A ⊂Xγ, A ∈Mγ, and Mγ |= A is countable. Then A will have an
accumulation point in Xγ+1, and this establishes countable compactness of
Y . (If A is closed discrete in Xγ, then A ∩Dξ is inﬁnite for some Dξ deﬁned
wrt Xγ, and then Dξ converges to λγ + ξ.)
Local countability was actually quite important in this argument; without
it, local compactness could easily be lost. For example, if we start out with
Xα = [0, 1] ∩Mα with the usual topology, then Xα would be locally compact
in Mα but would have no points of local compactness in Mα+1, because of the
nonconvergent Cauchy sequences one can deﬁne with the help of the added
reals. There are natural ways of adding points to recover local compactness, of
course, but they complicate the deﬁnition considerably. On the other hand,
if M and N are models of ZFC, and M is a submodel of N, then a com-
pact, countable space X in M retains both its properties in N. Indeed, X is
homeomorphic to a countable ordinal, and this property is upwards-absolute.
Conditions (i) through (iii) in 4.4 hold in any iterated forcing of uncount-
able (as seen in the ﬁnal model M) coﬁnality, in which supports are count-
able (again as seen in M). If the forcing, taken as a whole, is proper (as is
countable-support iteration of proper posets, or ﬁnite-support iteration of ccc
posets), then the ground model and M are in agreement on which sets are
uncountable (although cardinals greater than ω1 may be collapsed). Indeed,
if M is a model and P ∈M is proper, and G is an M-generic subset of P,
then every countable set of ordinals in M[G] is contained in a countable set
A in M (Shelah [1982, p.81]).
This also explains why an ω-bounded, locally compact, locally countable
space cannot be destroyed by proper forcing: we may assume the underly-
ing set is an ordinal, and then every countable subspace in the extension is
contained in a compact, scattered, countable subset in the ground model.
4.5. Example. Let M0 be a countable transitive model of ZFC+CH, and
let κ be a regular uncountable cardinal in M0.
Let ⟨Pα : α ≤κ ⟩be an
iterated ccc forcing with ﬁnite supports, so that for each α ⊂κ, Mα+1 |=
MA + c = ℵα+1, where Mα+1 = M0[Gα+1] for some Gα+1 generic over Pα+1.
The conditions of 4.4 are satisﬁed by ⟨Mα : α < κ ⟩and M = Mκ.
In
particular, since Mβ+1 satisﬁes MA, any set of fewer than ℵβ+1 functions
from ω to ω in Mβ+1 (such as Mβ ∩ωω) is dominated by some g ∈Mβ+1. So
there is an Ostaszewski-van Douwen space in Mκ. Also, any collection of fewer
than κ functions in Mκ appears in some earlier model and so is dominated in

144
Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
Mκ. On the other hand, it is easy to see that there is a dominating family
of cardinality κ in Mκ, so that b = d = κ. Similarly one shows that p = κ
in Mκ, whereas c = ℵκ. So if κ > ℵ1, then p > ℵ1 in the ﬁnal model and
b = d < c.
A similar model, but with a regular cardinal λ > κ in place of ℵκ, is
described in van Douwen [1984, 5.1]. (Caution: In this reference, the Mη,
fη etc. should be indexed by η < κ, not η < λ.)
The fact that b = d in 4.5 and van Douwen [1984, 5.1] is no accident: in
fact, it is easy to see that if M is as in Theorem 4.4, then there is a scale in M,
i.e. a dominating family well-ordered by <∗, of the same coﬁnality as κ; and
an elementary fact is that the existence of a scale of coﬁnality λ is equivalent
to b = d = λ. This gives rise to a natural question:
Problem 8.
Is b = d enough to imply the existence of an Ostaszewski-
? 290.
van Douwen space? A ﬁrst countable, separable, countably compact, non-
compact space?
Another natural question is how essential Property (iv) is to Theorem 4.4.
In one sense it is indispensable: in the presence of the ﬁrst three conditions,
⟨Mα : α < κ ⟩must have a coﬁnal subsequence satisfying (iv) in order for the
“Moreover” part to hold. For if ever we have an Mβ over which no g: ω →ω
in M dominates, then in Mβ there is a separable, locally compact, locally
countable space which cannot be embedded into an Ostaszewski-van Douwen
space (see next example). Moreover, a simple coding argument shows that if
there is a dominating G over Mβ in M, then there is one in some Mα, α < κ:
any g is a subset of ω × ω, and there is a bijection ψ: ω →ω × ω in M0. . .
4.6. Example. Let ⟨fα : α < d ⟩be a <∗-dominating family of increasing
functions from ω to ω which is almost disjoint (when each is considered as a
subset of ω ×ω). Such a family could be produced, for example, by beginning
with a dominating family ⟨gα : α < d ⟩, letting ⟨Aα : α ∈d ⟩be a 1–1 listing
of an almost disjoint family of inﬁnite subsets of ω, and then replacing gα by
an increasing fα which exceeds gα on every coordinate, and whose range is a
subset of Aα.
Let X be a space whose underlying set is ω×(ω+1)∪{ {fα} : α < d } where
the relative topology on ω × (ω + 1) is the usual one, and a neighborhood of
{fα} is any subset of x which contains {fα} together with a coﬁnite subset of
fα. Then X is locally compact, locally countable, and fails to satisfy wD since
no inﬁnite subset of ω × {ω} can be expanded to a discrete open collection.
(Compare 3.11.)
Now suppose X lives in some model M of ZFC, where the fα are now
understood to be dominating in M, and of course d means dM.

§4]
The “dominating reals” constructions.
145
4.7. Claim. Let M be a transitive submodel of N, where N is a transitive
model of ZFC. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) X is pseudonormal in N.
(ii) X satisﬁes wD in N.
(iii) Some inﬁnite subset of ω×{ω} expands to a discrete collection of open
sets.
(iv) There is in N a real dominating over M.
Proof. By Lemma 4.2, (iv)→(i), and (i)→(ii)→(iii) is trivial since ω × {ω}
remains closed discrete in N.
Finally, suppose A is an inﬁnite subset of ω such that, in N, A×{ω} expands
to a discrete collection { U⟨a,ω⟩: a ∈A } of open sets. Deﬁne g: A →ω by
letting g(a) be the least n such that ⟨a, k⟩∈U⟨a,ω⟩for all k ≥n, and for each
i ∈ω let f(i) = g(a) for the least a ∈A such that a ≥i. We will be done as
soon as we show f is dominating over M.
If f is not dominating over M, then there exists α such that B = { n :
f(n) ≤fα(n) } is inﬁnite.
Since fα is increasing, it follows that for each
b ∈B, the least member of A that is ≥b is in B also. So f(n) ≤fα(n) on
an inﬁnite subset of A, whence every neighborhood of {fα} meets inﬁnitely
many U⟨a,ω⟩, a contradiction.
Of course, X could have been any cardinality in the interval [d, c], and the
claim would have gone through.
An amusing question is whether X can be rigged so that X \ (ω × {ω}) is
pseudonormal in M. (This is true of Example 3.11, see van Douwen[1984,
proof of 11.4(e)].) This is equivalent to the more general-sounding question:
Problem 9.
Call a space X Ψ-like if it has a countable dense set D of 291. ?
isolated points, is locally compact and ﬁrst countable, and X −D is discrete.
Is there a pseudonormal Ψ-like space of cardinality d? More generally, what
is the maximum cardinality of a pseudonormal Ψ-like space? (From 3.11, it
is clearly ≥b.)
To show the equivalence, note that in 4.6, X (and hence X \ ω × {ω}) is
Ψ-like. Conversely, given a Ψ-like space Y of cardinality d which is pseudonor-
mal, identify its countable dense set of isolated points with ω, and choose for
each nonisolated point pα (α ∈d) a compact open neighborhood Uα with pα
as its sole nonisolated point. Let Aα = Uα \ {pα}. Then ⟨Aα : α ∈d ⟩is
almost disjoint, and we can deﬁne ⟨fα : α ∈d ⟩and X as in 4.6. Given a
countable subfamily ⟨fβ : β ∈B ⟩, let S be a countable set of ω which (by
pseudonormality) is almost disjoint from each Aα satisfying α /∈B, and such
that Aβ ⊂∗S for all β ∈B. For each β ∈B, let hβ be fβ minus the ﬁnitely
many ⟨i, j⟩∈fβ such that j /∈S. Then { hβ ∪{{fβ}} : β ∈B } is an open
subset of X \ (ω × {ω}) which does not have any {fα}, α /∈B, in its closure.

Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
Incidentally, there are Ψ-like spaces satisfying wD which are of cardinality
c (the maximum number possible). One is the Cantor tree, which is hered-
itarily realcompact since it admits a 1–1 continuous function into the plane
(Nyikos [1989] and Gillman and Jerison [1960, 8.17]). One can use it to
construct an X as above so that X \ ω × {ω} satisﬁes wD and, if desired, is
of cardinality c.
5. Linearly ordered remainders
In this section we extend the ideas behind γN to try to produce other ﬁrst
countable, countably compact spaces with N as a dense set of isolated points
and ordered remainder.
The beginning is simple. Suppose we have a γN which is not countably
compact, with A = { Aα : α ∈ω1 } an associated sequence in N. Can we
produce a ﬁrst countable, countably compact space by adding more points?
One condition under which the answer is yes is if A is the bottom half of some
tight (ω1, ω∗
1)-gap.
5.1. Definition. Let κ and λ be ordinals. A (κ, λ∗)-pre-gap, in P(N) is a pair
⟨A, B⟩where A and B are ⊂∗-totally ordered subsets of P(N), of coﬁnality
κ and coinitiality λ, respectively, and if a ∈A, B ∈B, then A ⊂∗B. (A set
with a largest element is understood to have coﬁnality 1.)
A (κ, λ∗)-pre-gap is a gap if there is no set C such that A ⊂∗C ⊂∗B for
all A ∈A, B ∈B. A set D is said to be beside the gap ⟨A, B⟩if it is almost
disjoint from all A ∈A and satisﬁes D ⊂∗B for all B ∈B. A tight gap is a
pre-gap that has no inﬁnite set beside it.
Despite the similarity in the deﬁnitions, there is a big diﬀerence between
gaps and tight gaps: while a tight gap is a gap, and there is an (ω1, ω∗
1)-
gap in ZFC (as shown by Hausdorﬀ), the existence of a tight (ω1, ω∗
1)-gap is
easily seen to imply t = ω1 and is, in fact, equivalent to it (Blaszczyk and
Szyma´nski [1982]).
Eric van Douwen used in [1976] an (ω1, ω∗
1)-gap to produce a ﬁrst count-
able, countably paracompact, non-normal space with N as a dense subset
and remainder the topological direct sum of two copies of ω1. The construc-
tion (5.2 below) is a straightforward modiﬁcation of the one for γN. In Nyikos
and Vaughan [1983] we used the same construction with a tight (ω1, ω∗
1)-gap
to produce a countably compact version of van Douwen’s space; the two prop-
erties are equivalent just as one has countable compactness of γN associated
with a “t = ω1-witnessing sequence” (Observation 2.3).
5.2. Construction. Let ⟨A, B⟩be an (ω1, ω∗
1)-pre-gap, with A = { Aα :
α < ω1 } and B = { Bα : α < ω1 } listed in an ascending and descending
order, respectively. Let ω∗
1 = ω1 × {−1} with the reverse of the usual order,
i.e. if β < α then ⟨β, −1⟩> ⟨α, −1⟩. Let Y = N ∪ω1 ∪ω∗
1. Points of N are

§5]
Linearly ordered remainders
147
isolated, basic neighborhoods of α ∈ω1 are just as in 2.2 (so that N ∪ω1 as
a subspace is a version of γN), while a neighborhood of ⟨α, −1⟩is any subset
of Y containing a set of the form
Vn[α, β) = { ⟨γ, −1⟩: β < γ ≤α } ∪(Bβ \ Bα) −{1, . . . , n}.
(Note that ⟨α, −1⟩is not in the closure of Bα, whereas α is in the closure of
Aα.)
The space Y is locally compact, locally countable, and countably paracom-
pact, is non-normal iﬀ⟨A, B⟩is a gap (van Douwen [1976]), and countably
compact iﬀ⟨A, B⟩is a tight gap (Nyikos and Vaughan [1983]).
The remainder Y \ N has a natural linear order the same as the order ⊂∗
on A ∪B, and the topology is the order topology. Since our main interest
is in what happens if t > ω1, we need to consider larger remainders (see the
end of Section 2), but we will keep them linearly ordered, and each will have
a ⊂∗-totally ordered sequence in N to go with it. Such setups are dealt with
at length in Nyikos [1988a], but with little attention to ﬁrst countability.
First countability in a LOTS entails that if an ascending sequence (resp.
descending sequence) in the remainder has uncountable coﬁnality, it cannot
have a supremum (resp. inﬁmum). On the other hand, countable compactness
does require suprema and inﬁma for countable sequences. So every ascending
sequence of uncountable coﬁnality “upstairs” (in Y \ N) will have to be met
by a descending sequence of uncountable coﬁnality. At the same time, we
will have some associated subsets of N, “downstairs”, totally ordered by ⊂∗,
and if t > ω1, then an ascending ω1-sequence and a descending ω∗
1-sequence
cannot form a tight gap, and if there is nothing “upstairs,” between the points
associated with them, then any inﬁnite set that is “beside the gap” will fail
to have a limit point.
So if t > ω1, then every ascending ω1-sequence in Y \ N will, in the two
examples below, have to be met by a descending sequence of coﬁnality > ω1.
For the sake of simplicity we take this to mean coﬁnality ω2 in Example5.3
below, which is a candidate for a space of the form Y \ N, but which may also
be of independent interest.
5.3. Example. Let Γ = { γ ∈ω2 : γ is a limit ordinal of uncountable coﬁna-
lity }. For each n ∈ω−{0} let Xn be the set of all sequences ⟨γ1, . . . , γn−1, α⟩
of length n whose ﬁrst n −1 terms are in Γ and whose last term is in ω2 −Γ,
and let Xω = ωΓ. Let X = { Xα : 1 ≤α ≤ω }. The order on X is “odd
forward, even reverse” lexicographical order. That is, given two sequences σ
and τ, if the ﬁrst k on which they disagree is odd, and σ(k) < τ(k), then
σ < τ; if k is even and σ(k) < τ(k), then σ > τ. Let X be given the order
topology.
If σ ∈Xω, then a local base for σ is all intervals of the form (σ2n, σ2n+1)
where σi = ⟨σ(1), . . . , σ(i), 0⟩for all i. If σ ∈X2n+1, then a local base at σ

148
Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
consists of the sets (⟨σ(1), . . . , σ(2n), β⟩, σ] where β < σ(2n+1). If σ ∈X2n,
we can use sets [σ , ⟨σ(1), . . . , σ(2n −1), β⟩) where β < σ(2n). These sets
are open, so that X is ﬁrst countable, and its isolated points are those whose
last term is a successor ordinal. It is also easy to see that Xω is dense in itself
while each Xn is scattered. An argument like the one which follows shows
that the subspace of all σ whose every term is in Γ is also dense in itself and
closed.
Also, X is countably compact. First suppose ⟨σn⟩n is increasing. Case 1.
For some k ∈ω, there are inﬁnitely many σn which diﬀer in the kth coordi-
nate. Let k be the least such coordinate. Since the sequence is increasing,
k is odd. Let α = sup{ σn(k) : n ∈ω }. Then the sequence converges to
⟨γ1, . . . , γk−1, α⟩where γ1, . . . , γk−1 “is agreed upon by all but ﬁnitely many
σn”. Case 2. Otherwise. Then, for each coordinate k, the sequence ⟨σn(k)⟩n is
eventually constant; let σ(k) denote this constant value. Then ⟨σ(k)⟩k ∈Xω,
and it is the limit of the sequence.
A similar argument works for an inﬁnite descending sequence, and of course
every inﬁnite subset of a LOTS has either an inﬁnite (strictly) ascending
sequence or an inﬁnite descending sequence.
A similar argument establishes that every ascending (resp.
descending)
sequence of order type ω1 is met by a descending (resp. ascending) sequence
of order type ω2: now Case I always holds, and the elements of the form
⟨γ1, . . . , γk−1, α, β⟩(β ∈ω2 −Γ) are coinitial (resp. coﬁnal) in the part of X
above (resp. below) the range of the sequence. It is also not hard to show
that an ascending ω2-sequence is met by a descending ω1-sequence unless it
is coﬁnal in X, while every descending ω2-sequence is met by an ascending
ω1-sequence.
So X is the right “shape” for embedding in a separable, ﬁrst countable,
countably compact space, but it could be the wrong size (if CH it is too
large, if t > ω2 it is too small), and other factors, discussed later, may con-
spire against countable compactness. However, if t ≥ω2 one can construct
with relative ease a prototype having all desired properties except perhaps
countable compactness.
5.4. Example ((t > ω1)). Let En (n ∈ω −{0}) be the set of all sequences
of the form σ = ⟨γ1, . . . , γn⟩, γi ∈Γ for all i. Let E = ∞
n=1 En. Extend the
above order on X to X ∪E by decreeing that if σ ∈En and n is even, then
σ < τ for all τ extending σ, while if n is odd, then σ > τ for all τ extending
σ, otherwise the ordering is deﬁned as before (“odd forward, even reverse”).
For instance, using parentheses to denote sequences,
(0) < (ω1, ω1) < (ω1, ω1, 0) < (ω1, 0) < (ω1).
Let A be a ⊂∗-totally ordered family of subsets of N, indexed by ∞
n=1(Xn∪
En) in order-preserving fashion. Such a family might be deﬁned by induction
on n, as follows.
By t ≥ω2, there is a ⊂∗-ascending ω2-sequence which

§5]
Linearly ordered remainders
149
can be indexed by X1 ∪E1. Suppose we have deﬁned all sets indexed by
Xi ∪Ei for all i ≤n. Each σ ∈Xn+1 ∪En+1 is of the form ⟨γ1, . . . , γn, α⟩
where α ∈ω2. Those with ﬁxed γ1, . . . , γn form an interval of n+1
i=1 Xi ∪Ei,
and if n is odd, the greatest member of this interval is ⟨γ1, . . . , γn, 0⟩, whose
immediate successors are τ = ⟨γ1, . . . , γn⟩and then ⟨γ1, . . . , γn + 1⟩. The set
Σ = { ⟨γ1, . . . , γn−1, α⟩: α < γn } is coﬁnal in the part of n+1
i=1 ∪Ei preceding
this interval.
Now B = { Aσ : σ ∈Σ } has been deﬁned as has Aτ, and
⟨B, {Aτ}⟩is not a gap because t ≥ω2, so there is a set B such that Aσ ⊂∗
B ⊂∗Aτ for all σ ∈Σ. Again applying t ≥ω2, we can choose a ⊂∗-descending
ω2-sequence ⟨Cα : α ∈ω2 } in Aτ \ B and then let Aγ1,...,γn,α = B ∪Cα. (We
omit ⟨⟩in the subscripts for simpliﬁcity.)
If n is even, the argument is dual: orders are reversed, and “greatest”,
“successors”, “coﬁnal”, “preceding”, and “descending” are replaced by their
opposites, Aτ \ B is replaced by B \ Aτ, and B ∪Cα is replaced by Aτ ∪Cα.
Let Y be the space whose underlying set is X ∪N, in which points of N are
isolated, and a local base at each σ ∈X is as follows. (Interval notation will
always denote intervals in X.)
If σ = ⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n, α⟩, and α > 0, a basic open set at σ is of the form
(τ, σ] ∪A where τ = ⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n, β⟩, β < α, and A is a coﬁnite subset of
Aσ \Aτ, while if α = 0 then a basic open set at σ is of the form {σ}∪A where
A is a coﬁnite subset of Aσ \ Aγ1,...,γ2n.
If σ ∈Xω, then for a local base at σ we use sets of the form
[⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n, 0⟩, ⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n+1, 0⟩] ∪A
where A is a coﬁnite subset of
Aγ1...,γ2n+1 \ Aγ1,...,γ2n.
With this choice and the earlier choices for σ ∈Xn, we have a base of clopen
sets. For example, if σ = ⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n, α⟩and τ = ⟨γ1, . . . , γ2, β⟩, β < α then
(τ, σ] = [⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n, β + 1⟩, σ] = (τ, ρ)
where
ρ = ⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n, α + 1⟩.
And if α = 0, then {α} = (τ, ρ) where τ = ⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n + 1⟩, and ρ is as
before. Note also that if σ ∈X, then σ ∈Aσ iﬀσ is of odd length iﬀAα is a
neighborhood of σ.
It is easy to see that Y is ﬁrst countable and separable. It is not locally
compact, nor is its closed subspace X, because no point of Xω has a compact
neighborhood.
5.5. Proposition.
Y is countably compact if, and only if, the following
conditions hold:
(i) The pair ⟨{ Aα : α < ω2}, {N}⟩is a tight (ω2, 1)-gap.
(ii) For each choice of ⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n⟩, n > 0, the sets indexed by

150
Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
{⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n, α⟩: α < ω2}
and the sets indexed by
{⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n−1, β⟩: β < γ2n}
together form a tight (ω2, ω∗
1)-gap.
(iii) For each choice of ⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n+1⟩, n ≥0, the sets indexed by
{⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n, β⟩: β < γ2n+1}
and those indexed by
{⟨γ1, . . . , γ2n+1, α⟩: α < ω2}
together form a tight (ω1, ω∗
2)-gap.
In other words, in the language of Nyikos [1988a], where ∗denotes Stone-
ˇCech remainder in βN, { A∗: A ∈A } is a clopen ω1-tunnel through βN \ N.
Proof. If any of the three conditions fails, then an inﬁnite subset S of N
beside the pre-gap will be closed discrete. For example, if S is beside the
pre-gap in (ii) and σ ∈X, then either there will be some β < γ2n such that
(γ1, . . . , γ2n−1, β) < σ, whence S ⊂∗Aγ1,...,γ2n−1,β and so σ /∈S; or else there
will be α < ω2 such that σ < (γ1, . . . , γ2n, α), and the closure of Aγ1,...,γ2n,α
will be a neighborhood of σ having ﬁnite intersection with S.
Conversely, suppose the three conditions are met. We already know X is
countably compact, so it suﬃces to show that every inﬁnite subset S of N has
a limit point in X. By (i), there is a least α1 < ω2 such that Aα1 ∩S = S1 is
inﬁnite. If α1 ∈Γ, then ⟨α1⟩is a limit point of S. If α1 ∈Γ, we continue as
follows.
Suppose α1, . . . , αn and Sn ⊂Aα1,...,αn have been deﬁned and n is odd and
αn ∈Γ, pick the least ordinal αn+1 such that Aα1,...,αn,αn+1 omits inﬁnitely
many points of Sn. If αn+1 /∈Γ, then ⟨α1, . . . , αn+1⟩is a limit point of Sn. If
αn+1 ∈Γ, let Sn+1 = Sn \ Aα1,...,αn+1.
If n is even and αn ∈Γ, let αn+1 be the least ordinal such that Sn =
Aα1,...,αn+1 = Sn+1 is inﬁnite. If αn+1 /∈Γ, we are done as before. If αn+1 ∈Γ,
we continue.
If we have been forced to choose αn for all n ∈ω, then every neighborhood
of ⟨αn⟩n contains inﬁnitely many points of S.
The crux of the matter is, whether it is consistent with t = ω2 that an A
satisfying 5.5 exists. It is not consistent with higher values of t because of (i),
and while consistency with t = ω1 is not out of question, it is not of much
interest as far as the title problem goes.
The method of constructing A outlined near the begininning of 5.4 only
produces pre-gaps. If the following problem has an aﬃrmative solution, a
simple modiﬁcation of the technique would produce (tight) gaps.
Problem 10.
Is it consistent with t = ω2 that every ⊂∗-ascending ω1-
? 292.

§5]
Linearly ordered remainders
151
sequence of subsets of N is the bottom half of some (ω1, ω∗
2)-gap? some tight
(ω1, ω∗
2)-gap?
This is easily seen to be equivalent to the “dual” problem of whether every
⊂∗-descending ω1-sequence is the top half of some (tight) (ω2, ω∗
1) −gap.
Hence an aﬃrmative solution could give new models where the title problem
has a positive solution.
Even without “tight”, the best we can hope for in Problem 10 is a consis-
tency result. As shown in Baumgartner [1984], PFA, which implies all the
“small uncountable cardinals” considered here, including c, are equal to ω2,
also implies there are no (ω1, ω∗
2)-gaps. (Caution: Baumgartner uses “gap”
to mean what is here called a “pre-gap”, and “unﬁlled gap” to mean what is
here called a “gap”. Also in the “natural candidate” following Baumgart-
ner [1984, 4.1] one needs to insert the following clause in the deﬁnition of
P(a, b): “and aα −n ⊂bβ −n for all aα ∈x, β ∈y.” Also, in the proof of
Baumgartner [1984, 4.2(c)], where ξ is deﬁned to be min(zα), that should
be the deﬁnition of η also.)
The following axiom, formally less demanding than the “tight” version of
Problem 10, is equivalent to the existence of an A satisfying 5.5. On the one
hand, every A as in 5.5 behaves like C below; on the other hand, an induction
very similar to that in 5.4 constructs a desired A ⊂C:
5.6. Axiom. There is a ⊂∗-chain C in P(N) with a coﬁnal subset { Aα : α <
ω2 } which forms a tight gap with {N}, such that:
(i) For all γ ∈Γ, ⟨{ Aα : α < γ }, { C ∈C : α < γ(Aα ⊂∗C) }⟩is a tight
(ω1, ω∗
2)-gap;
(ii) Given any tight (ω1, ω∗
2)-gap ⟨C′, C \ C′⟩with C′ ⊂C, there is a ⊂∗-
descending family { Bα : α < ω2 } in C coinitial with C\C′ such that,
for all γ ∈Γ,
⟨{ C ∈C : α < γ(C ⊂∗Bα) }, { Bα : α < γ }⟩
is a tight (ω2, ω∗
1)-gap
(iii) (The dual statement of (ii)).
There are some fairly obvious generalizations of 5.3 through 5.6 to regular
cardinals κ > ω2. The simplest kinds have Γ = { α ∈κ : α is of uncountable
coﬁnality } and then simply substitute κ for ω2 in the deﬁnitions of X and
Y . The analogue of Problem 10 is open for them too, and again the best we
can hope for is a consistency result, thanks to some models of MA + c = κ
in unpublished work of Kunen. Of course, the really interesting models are
those where b < c, and there Problem 10 and its analogue for higher κ seem
to be completely open.
The maximum generality that can easily be achieved by the ideas in this
section and Nyikos [1988a] is represented by the following theorem, whose

152
Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
proof is left to the interested reader. For the deﬁnition of a clopen ω1-tunnel
through βN \ N, see Nyikos [1988a].
5.7. Theorem. If there is a clopen ω1-tunnel C through βN \ N such that, if
C′ ⊂C, then C′ has a supremum (resp. inﬁmum) in C iﬀC′ has countable
coﬁnality (resp. coinitiality), then there is a ﬁrst countable, zero-dimensional,
countably compact noncompact space X with N as a dense set of isolated
points and X \ N totally ordered.
These conditions are easily met if t = ω1 by Example 2.2, but it is still not
known whether they are compatible with t > ω1.
6. Diﬃculties with manifolds
The dual personality of the title problem becomes even more acute when it
is restricted to manifolds. (By a manifold, we mean a connected space in
which every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to Rn for some ﬁnite
n.) On the one hand, the construction of a separable, countably compact,
noncompact manifold under CH is almost as easy as that of an Ostaszewski-
van Douwen space (Nyikos [1984, Example 3.10]). On the other hand, there
is Problem 2, and, worse yet:
Problem 11.
Is it consistent that there is a pseudocompact manifold of
? 293.
weight > ℵ1?
Unless the answer is “yes” in every model of b > ω1, we cannot say “yes”
to:
Problem 12. Is there a ZFC example of a pseudocompact manifold which
? 294.
is not countably compact?
The reason is that a pseudocompact space in which there is an inﬁnite closed
discrete subspace cannot satisfy wD, so by Theorem 3.7, if b > ℵ1, then the
weight must exceed ℵ1 also. In contrast, if b = ℵ1, then we know there is a
pseudocompact manifold that is not countably compact (Example 6.3).
Our extra diﬃculties stem from the fact that Property wD is no longer
enough for extending a manifold to a larger one (as opposed to extending it
simply to a ﬁrst countable space). If we do not want to raise dimension, then
there must also be a closed copy of [0, 1) in the manifold we want to extend.
Even that is not always enough (Example 6.3).
A precise condition is (2) in:
6.1. Theorem. Let X be an n-manifold. Then (1) ↔(2) →(3) in:
(1) There is an n-manifold Y containing X as a proper subspace.

§6]
Diﬃculties with manifolds
153
(2) There is, in X, a closed copy of Bn −{⟨1, 0, . . ., 0⟩} where Bn is the
closed Euclidean n-ball.
(3) There is a closed copy of [0, 1) in X.
Proof. If n = 1 then (2) and (3) are saying the same thing, and there are
exactly four 1-manifolds by the deﬁnition of “manifold” adopted here. R and
the open long ray obviously satisfy both (1) and (2); S1 and the long line
clearly satisfy neither. For the remainder of the proof we assume n ≥2.
(2) →(1). There is a well-known general method of adding a copy I of
[0, 1) to B = Bn −{⟨1, 0, . . ., 0⟩} so that the resulting space is homeomorphic
to B by a homeomorphism leaving the “boundary” of B (i.e. B −En where
En is the open unit n-ball) pointwise ﬁxed. The method is suggested by the
following pictures. As may be surmised, the original copy of B is dense in the
whole space.

Details may be found in Nyikos [1984, Section 3] or Rudin and Zenor [1976].
Now if X contains a closed copy of B, then we can perform this operation
and let Y = X ∪I with the obvious topology.
(1) →(3): Let y ∈Y \ X. By “invariance of domain”, X is open in Y , and
since X is not closed in Y we may take y ∈X. Let U be a neighborhood of y
homeomorphic to Rn, and let x ∈X ∩U. Let f: [0, 1] →U be an embedding
such that f(0) = x, f(1) = y. Then there is a (unique) r > 0 such that
f(s) ∈X for all s ∈[0, r) but f(r) /∈X. Then f →[0, r) is a relatively closed
copy of [0, 1) in X.
(1) →(2): Let U, y, and f be as above and let I = f →[0, r). We may
assume f was deﬁned so that there is a homeomorphism g of U with the
open unit n-ball such that the image of ran(f) is a straight line segment.
The image of X under g is then an open neighborhood of g→f →[0, r). Let
rn = r(1 −1/n) for each n ∈N. For each n there exists εn > 0 so that
the εn-ball around each point of g→f →[rn, rn+1] is a subset of g→X. Let
h: [0, r] →[0, 1] be a continuous monotone function such that 0 < h(p) < εn
whenever p ∈[rn, rn+1], h(r) = 0. Then the union of the closed h(p)-balls
around the points g(f(p)), p ∈[0, r), is the desired copy.
6.2. Corollary. If M is a pseudocompact n-manifold, then M cannot be
properly extended to an n-manifold.
Proof. This is well known for n = 1: the only pseudocompact 1-manifolds
are S1 and the long line. If n ≥2, then B = Bn −{⟨1, 0, 0 . . .0⟩} has an

154
Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
inﬁnite discrete family of open sets, and they will be discrete in any manifold
containing B as a closed subspace. Hence (2) fails for X = M.
The following example, besides showing (3) need not imply (2), is the best
example to date of a pseudocompact manifold that is not countably compact.
6.3. Example (b = ω1). Let C be the closed long ray, obtained by inter-
secting copies of (0, 1) between successive countable ordinals: C = { α + r :
α ∈ω1, r ∈[0, 1) }. Let M be the extended plane (i.e. the one-point com-
pactiﬁcation of R2) with the origin removed. The underlying set of X will be
M ∪C.
Intuitively, we replace the origin by C, attaching it to M so that it becomes
a continuation of the negative x-axis.
To get at points p on [0, ω) ⊂C,
we can approach them along straight line segments whose angle with the
positive x-axis approaches 0 as p →ω. The angle of approach will be the
same whether we approach from the positive half-plane or the negative half
plane. To approach ω and points beyond, we approach the origin along curves
that are asymptotic to the positive x-axis: the more sharply asymptotic, the
further up C the point approached.
Given p ∈C, all we need do is specify an arc in the upper half-plane H+
along which the point is to be approached. Its mirror image in the lower half-
plane H−will also approach p. Then, given a basic neighborhood (q, r) ⊂C
of p, we extend to an open neighborhood of p by taking all points within ε of
the origin (for some ε > 0) that lie between the arcs approaching q and r in
H+, and doing the same in H−. If r ≥ω, there will be some crossing of the
arcs, but the one attached to r in H+ will eventually be to the right of the
one attached to q in H+, and we can wlog conﬁne ourselves to ε that put us
in this region.
The negative x-axis approaches 0 ∈C. Any r ∈(0, 1] is approached along
π + 3πr/4. If r ∈[1, ω) it is approached along the line of slope 1/r.
For ω and beyond, we use a <∗-unbounded, <∗-well-ordered family of in-
creasing functions in NN, { fα : α < b = ω1 }, with fk(h) = kn for all
k ∈ω −{0}. In R2, let gα be (the graph of) a continuous increasing function,
with gα(1/n) = 1/fα(n) for all n. Let hα = gα|R+. Note that hi approaches
i ∈C for 0 < i < ω. We also have hα approach α ∈C for all α ∈ω1 −{0}.
For points in the interval (α, α + 1) we interpolate between hα and hα+1 in
orderly fashion.
To see that the resulting manifold X is pseudocompact, we show that every
inﬁnite sequence ⟨xn⟩in M \(the positive x-axis) has a cluster point, and use
the fact that this subspace is dense in X.
If ⟨xn⟩meets the negative x-axis A in inﬁnite many terms, it has a cluster
point in A ∪{∞} ∪{0} (0 ∈C). By symmetry we may assume xn ∈H+ for
all n. Then either (I) there exists ε > 0 such that ∥xn∥≥ε for inﬁnitely many
n, when there is a cluster point in the complement of the ε-ball centered on

§6]
Diﬃculties with manifolds
155
the origin or (II) inﬁnitely many xn lie to the left of some hα, when there is a
cluster point in M ∪[0, α]. Instead, if both conditions failed, there would be
an inﬁnite sequence of xn with declining positive abscissae, converging to 0,
and all but ﬁnitely many below the graph of any given hα. But this is easily
seen to violate <∗-unboundedness of the fα.
It is also easy to see that any closed initial segment of the positive x-axis
is a closed copy of (0, 1] in X.
Problem 13. If X is an n-manifold of weight < b which contains a closed 295. ?
copy of [0, 1), does X have a proper extension to an n-manifold?
Observation 3.10 sheds some light on this problem, taking us from the
weaker to the stronger of the following two conditions:
6.4. Definition. A closed copy I of [0, 1) in an n-manifold X is pre-tame
if there is an neighborhood of I homeomorphic to Rn, by a homeomorphism
taking I to a closed ray. I is strongly pre-tame if there is a closed neighborhood
of I homeomorphic to B
n −{⟨1, 0, . . ., 0⟩}, by a homeomorphism taking I to
{⟨r, 0, . . . , 0⟩: 0 ≤r < 1}.
Of course, Theorem 6.1 implies that an n-manifold has a proper extension
to an n-manifold iﬀit contains a strongly pre-tame closed copy of [0, 1). It
is easy to see that a strongly pre-tame copy of I is pre-tame, and the non-
negative x-axis in Example 6.3 is pre-tame but not strongly pre-tame. On the
other hand, as suggested above:
6.5. Lemma. A pre-tame copy of [0, 1) in a manifold X of weight < b is
strongly pre-tame.
Proof. Let U be a neighborhood witnessing pre-tameness of I. By Obser-
vation 3.10 there is an open neighborhood V of I whose closure in X is a
subset of U. An argument like that in (1) →(2) of Theorem 6.1, with V
playing the role of g→X there, produces a neighborhood homeomorphic to
B
n −{⟨1, 0, . . ., 0⟩} which is closed in U, hence in X.
6.6. Corollary. An n-manifold of weight < b has a proper extension to an
n-manifold iﬀit contains a closed pre-tame copy of [0, 1).
Thus Problem 13 can be re-phrased: if an n-manifold of weight < b contains
a closed copy of [0, 1), must it contain a closed pre-tame copy? I do not know
the answer even if “of weight < b” is dropped.
Unfortunately, Problem 13 is not the only hurdle to getting proper exten-
sions of n-manifolds of weight < b. By shifting our base of operations into
the ﬁrst quadrant, we can modify 6.3 to produce a 2-manifold of weight ℵ1
without a closed copy of [0, 1).

156
Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
6.7. Example. Our underlying set will be M ∪C as in 6.3, but the con-
struction is carried out in ZFC. This time, it will be the negative half of the
main diagonal (the ray θ = 5π/4) that approaches 0 ∈C, and r ∈(0, 1] ⊂C
is approached at angles π
4 (5 ± 3r).
In the ﬁrst quadrant we make use of an (ω1, ω∗
1)-gap in NN, i.e. a pair ⟨A, B⟩
of families of functions ⟨fα : α < ω1 ⟩, ⟨gα : α < ω1 ⟩so that fβ <∗fα <∗
gα <∗gβ whenever β < α, and such that for no f: N →N is it true that
fα <∗f <∗gα for all α < ω1. We may assume each fα and gα is increasing.
For a detailed discussion on how to produce such a gap, see Dales and
Woodin [1987, p.104 ﬀ].
Let h1 be the positive y-axis and k1 the positive x-axis; these both approach
1 ∈C. For α > 1 let hα and kα be continuous increasing functions from R+
to R+, satisfying hα(1/n) = 1/fα(n), kα(1/n) = 1/gα(n). Let the graphs of
hα and kα approach α ∈C, and interpolate naturally to approach points of
(α, α + 1) ⊂C.
There can be no closed copy of (0, 1] in the resulting manifold. Such a copy
would have to approach the origin, but this can only be done in a way that
eventually takes us between (the graphs of) any given hα and kα, but that is
impossible. (The reason it can only be done in this way is that if we take out
from X the part that is strictly below hα and strictly above kα from the point
where they no longer touch one another on the way to the origin, then what
is left is a countably compact space: a compact manifold-with-boundary with
a copy of the long ray glued on.) The reason this is impossible is that if we
take, for each n, a point ⟨1/n, yn⟩where the alleged copy touches the vertical
line x = 1/n, let kn be the integer closest to 1/yn whenever yn > 0, and leave
kn undeﬁned otherwise, then let f(n) = kn when kn is deﬁned and f(n) = 1
otherwise, then we will have fα <∗f <∗gα for all α.
Under CH it is possible to choose fα and gα so that X is countably com-
pact. On the other hand, if p > ω1, then X will have inﬁnite closed discrete
subspaces (see paragraph following construction 3.3), and then because b > ω1
these can be even expanded to discrete collections of open sets. Also, in ev-
ery model of ZFC one can modify the construction so as to leave a discrete
collection of open disks converging to the origin. So, if we want to build a
pseudocompact manifold of weight > ℵ1, we seem to be faced with the dev-
ilish task of insuring that no such subspace as our manifold arises before the
ﬁnal stage.
There is one loophole: it is possible to add a limit point to any given closed
discrete subspace of Example 6.7 by going to a third dimension: the usual
embedding of M in the one-point compactiﬁcation of R3 can be extended
to an embedding of X into R3 ∪C with a natural topology: “fatten” basic
neighborhoods vertically, but to approach points of C, make both the y- and z-
coordinates of the sequence converge to 0. Now modify that embedding so
that some discrete family of open sets in H+, rather than staying in the

§7]
In the No Man’s Land
157
xy-plane, becomes a family of bumps of height 1 with their bottoms on the
xy-plane coinciding with their boundaries.
The tops of these bumps then
converge to ⟨0, 0, 1⟩.
One problem with this loophole is that there are analogues of 6.7 in dimen-
sions n ≥3, such as its product with Sn−2, and we do eventually have to
settle upon a dimension for the ﬁnal manifold. Another problem is that we
do not know how to ﬁnd limit points for all closed discrete subspaces of 6.7
even by going to higher dimensions. If we relax the deﬁnition of “manifold” to
allow Hilbert cube manifolds, where “invariance of domain” no longer holds,
it might be possible to overcome these diﬃculties, but that remains to be
seen.
Besides these problems, there is even the one of whether there is a separable,
countably compact, noncompact manifold in all models of p = ω1, or even
b = ω1. The answer would be aﬃrmative if we knew how to solve Problem 14
below.
6.8. Definition. Given a function f ∈NN, deﬁne
f ↑= { ⟨i, j⟩∈N × N : j ≥f(i) }
f ↓= { ⟨i, j⟩∈N × N : j ≤f(i) }.

B = ⟨gα : α < τ ⟩, are such that (⟨f ↓
α : α < σ ⟩, ⟨g↑
β : β < τ ⟩) is a tight gap
in N × N.
Problem 14. Does p = ω1 or b = ω1 imply there is a tight (ω1, ω∗
1)-gap in 296. ?
NN?
It is not diﬃcult to construct such a gap under CH, but the general problem
remains open. Note that Example 6.7 is countably compact iﬀthe gap used
there is tight.
7. In the No Man’s Land
Alan Dow has recently shown me a model of ω1 < p and b < d, in which
it is not yet known whether there is a separable, ﬁrst countable, countably
compact, noncompact space. Here it is, with a slight modiﬁcation by Amer
Beˇslagi´c.
7.1. Model.
Beginning with any model of ZFC, let M1 be obtained by
adding ℵ2 Cohen reals. Then let M be a model of MA(ω1) obtained from M1
by an iterated ccc forcing of coﬁnality κ ≥ℵ3 with ﬁnite supports, such that
every poset at successors stages is of cardinality ≤ℵ1. (One can simply imitate

158
Nyikos / Countably compact spaces
[ch. 8
the usual Martin-Solovay method of bringing about MA(Kunen [1980, pp.
278–281]), but with the size of each Qα restricted to ≤ℵ1.) Dow has shown:
(∗) In M, the initial set of ℵ2 Cohen reals is not dominated.
Here, by a slight abuse of language, we are identifying a Cohen real A with
the unique order-preserving bijection f: ω →A. All that is needed to show
(∗) is that |Qα| ≤ℵ1 for all α and that supports are countable (which is not
the same as saying “countable supports”!).
From (∗) it follows that b = ℵ2 in M; it cannot be less because MA(ω1)
holds in M. On the other hand, because supports are ﬁnite, new Cohen reals
are added coﬁnally often and are not majorized by any function added at an
earlier stage; from this, and the fact that ccc forcing preserves coﬁnalities, we
get d ≥κ ≥ℵ3 in M. From MA(ℵ1) follows p > ω1 (hence p = ℵ2).
Problem 15. Is there a ﬁrst countable, separable, countably compact, non-
? 297.
compact space in M?
One possibility is that the ground model, or some intermediate model,
contains an Ostaszewski-van Douwen space of cardinality ≥ℵ2.
Could it
be that at least one such space is preserved during the forcing, just as the
unboundedness of the initial set of ℵ2 Cohen reals is?
In some cases, the answer is Yes. When the ground model satisﬁes p =
c = ℵ2 and is obtained from a model of GCH by ﬁnite-support ccc forcing,
then the ground model contains an Ostaszewski-van Douwen space with ω-
bounded remainder that is preserved in M. Details will appear in a future
paper, after some other models have been investigated.
For instance, if the ground model satisﬁes 2ℵ1 = ℵ2, and the iteration is of
length ℵ3, then p = ℵ2, hence b = ℵ2 = c, will be satisﬁed coﬁnally often in the
iteration, giving us natural candidates for a Yes answer there too. We could,
of course, try for a No answer by stretching out the iteration and keeping
b = ℵ1 until the ﬁrst ℵ3 stages are past. However, the fact that supports
are ﬁnite means that the names for the size-ℵ1 posets at successors stages
“live” on ℵ1 or fewer coordinates of the iteration. Picking carefully the posets
that kill oﬀvarious unbounded families, of size ℵ1, it will often be possible to
build up inner models of b = c = ℵ2, and then be faced with the question of
whether there is anything in M that kills oﬀall the Ostaszewski-van Douwen
spaces that live there.
Our knowledge of what preserves, or what kills, various Ostaszewski-van
Douwen spaces, is still very spotty, and less developed than our knowledge of
how to create them. A concerned eﬀort to improve it may well be repaid by
the illumination it brings into this no man’s land.

1. Introduction
The problems presented in this paper reﬂect the author’s view of Moore spaces
as the historical testing ground for topological pathology. Moore spaces were
initially but a ﬁrst stage towards R. L. Moore’s successful topological char-
acterization of the plane Moore [1932]. However, through his extensive use
of this concept in teaching “non-metric” topology to several generations of
gifted students, Moore spaces have become one of the most widely studied
class of spaces in topology. Their continuing relevance has been due to the
depth of positive theory shared with metric spaces, together with the wealth
of non-trivial counterexamples which diﬀerentiate them. Recall that many
of the now standard structures in general topology (e.g., subparacompact
spaces (Bing [1951] and McAuley [1956]), the collectionwise normal and
collectionwise Hausdorﬀproperties (Bing [1951]), Q-sets (Bing [1951] and
Heath [1964]), base of countable order theory (Worrell and Wicke [1965],
and Pixley-Roy constructions (Pixley and Roy [1969]) were direct products
of the study of non-metrizable Moore spaces. Furthermore, the rebirth of “set-
theoretic” topology in the past two decades was certainly due in a large part
to the normal Moore space conjecture Jones [1937] and its partial solutions
(e.g., Tall [1969],Fleissner [1974], Reed and Zenor [1976], Nyikos [1980],
Fleissner [1982b, 1982a]).
Of course, as anyone who cares to look through Moore’s notebooks at the
University of Texas will easily agree, most of Moore’s own interests concerned
the geometric and continua theory of Moore spaces. The work of his students
G. T. Whyburn, R. L. Wilder, F. B. Jones, G. S. Young, R. H. Bing, E. E.
Moise, R. D. Anderson, B. J. Ball, H. Cook and others reﬂects this legacy.
In this paper, the author has chosen to concentrate on a very short and
admittedly very personal list of problems which continue to interest and to
defy him after several years pursuit.
Organization of the paper
The next six sections contain problems related to the topics indicated. In
section 8, we discuss recent solutions to two problems which the author had
intended to include in the paper. References are given in section 9.
2. Normality
We now know that the normal Moore space conjecture is in the hands of the
gods and large cardinals (see Tall [1984] and Fleissner [1984]). However,
there remain several related problems which we can still hope either to estab-
lish in ZFC or at least show to be both consistent and independent, without
the use of large cardinals.

Reed / Moore Spaces
[ch. 9
Problem 2.1. Is each normal Moore space submetrizable?
? 298.
In Reed and Zenor [1976], the author and Phil Zenor showed that in ZFC
each normal, locally compact, locally connected Moore space is metrizable.
The key idea in the proof of this result was that each normal Moore space
of cardinality ≤c is submetrizable, i.e., admits a one-to-one continuous map
onto a metric space.
Using the same techniques, it follows that a normal
Moore space is submetrizable if and only if it has a σ-disjoint separating open
cover. Recall that a separating cover H of the space S is a cover such that for
all x, y ∈S such that x ̸= y, there exists H ∈H such that x ∈H but y /∈H.
It is easy to see that a space with a σ-disjoint separating open cover has
cardinality ≤λω, where λ is the cellularity. Hence, for example, the exis-
tence of a normal Moore space with cardinality greater than c but cellularity
c would provide a negative answer to the above question. By similar argu-
ments, a normal Moore space would be non-submetrizable if it contained a
discrete subset X of cardinality > c such that no subset of X of cardinality
> c could be screened by open sets. Under V = L, there exist no normal
Moore spaces of either type, since under this assumption each normal Moore
space is collectionwise Hausdorﬀand has a σ-discrete π-base (see 2.5). How-
ever, in [1984, p. 66], Juh´asz gives a ﬁrst countable space under (CH+ an
ω2-Souslin line) with cardinality greater than c but with cellularity c. The
author’s Moore space machine (Reed [1974c]) over this space produces a
Moore space with the same properties. However, whereas Juh´asz’s space is
normal, the Moore space will not in general be normal. The Pixley-Roy space
on a Q-set (Pixley and Roy [1969] is an example under (MA + ¬CH) of a
normal Moore space of cardinality ω1 but with cellularity ω. However, note
that if a Moore space is formed by a Pixley-Roy construction on a ﬁrst count-
able space X, the Moore space will have cardinality ≤λω, where λ is its
cellularity.
The above observations by the author have recently been analyzed and sig-
niﬁcantly extended by Miriam Brod in [1987, 1990]. For example, she has
characterized submetrizable spaces as those which admit a σ-discrete sepa-
rating cover of co-zero sets.
Also, she has made progress on deciding the
consistency of normality for Moore spaces such as the one over the above-
mentioned Juh´asz space.
Note that the full strength of normality is needed for a positive result.
In Wage, Fleissner and Reed [1976] and Reed [1980], the author gave
an example (under MA + ¬CH) of a countably paracompact, separable
Moore space of cardinality < c which is not submetrizable.
Problem 2.2.
Is it consistent with ZFC that the square of each normal

Moore space is normal?
In [1976] Howard Cook gave an example (under MA+¬CH) of a normal

§2]
Normality
167
Moore space whose square is not normal. This paper was never published. The
author announced in Reed [1986] that under MA + ¬CH, the Moore space
over X (in the sense of Reed [1976]) is such an example, for all X in the
class C of spaces formed via the intersection topology w.r.t. the real line and
the countable ordinals. Furthermore, the proof technique to show that the
squares are not normal also yields a simple proof that Cook’s original example
works. These results were presented at the 1986 Prague Symposium.
Problem 2.3.
If X is a normal, locally compact Moore space, must the 300. ?
square of X be normal ?
A positive answer to this question seems likely in ZFC. In [1974] Fleissner
has shown that under V = L, normal locally compact Moore spaces are
metrizable. Hence, one might look for a negative result under MA + ¬CH.
However, in [1976], Alster and Przymusi´nski showed that under MA,
if X is a cometrizable T2-space (i.e., admits a regular, one-to-one continuous
map onto a separable metric space) and the cardinality of X is less than c, then
Xω is normal. The author observed in Reed [1974d] that if X is a normal,
locally compact Moore space of cardinality ≤c then X is cometrizable, and
hence under MA the square of Xω is normal if the cardinality of X is strictly
less than c. This result was in turn extended by Alster and Przymusi´nski
(see [1977]) who showed that under MA, if X is a normal, locally compact,
separable Moore space then Xω is normal.
Problem 2.4. If the square of X is a normal Moore space, is X submetriz- 301. ?
able?
From the above remarks, it is clear that the product question and the sub-
metrizability question are linked. Cook has shown in [1976] that if X2 is a
normal Moore space, then X is continuously semi-metrizable and hence has
the three link property (equivalently a regular Gδ-diagonal (Zenor [1972])).
It is easy to see that each submetrizable space also has a regular Gδ-diagonal.
However, in Reed [1980] (see Wage, Fleissner and Reed [1976]), the au-
thor gave an example of a continuously semi-metrizable Moore space which is
not submetrizable. Note that a space with the three link property must have
cardinality ≤λω where λ is the cellularity, hence the method for constructing
possible counterexamples discussed in 2.1 is ruled out here. Also, note that
each of the known consistent examples of normal Moore spaces whose squares
are not normal are of small cardinality and submetrizable, but not cometriz-
able. Hence, a reasonable conjecture would be that under MA, the square
of a normal Moore space X of cardinality < c is normal if and only if X is
cometrizable (see Przymusi´nski [1977]).

168
Reed / Moore Spaces
[ch. 9
Problem 2.5. Is it consistent with ZFC that each normal Moore space is
? 302.
completable?
Recall that a Moore space X is complete if and only if it has a develop-
ment {Gn} such that if {Mn} is a non-increasing sequence of closed sets in X
such that for each n, Mn is contained in an element of Gn, then {Mn} ̸=
∅.
In Moore’s original terminology, this was Axiom 14, hence a complete
Moore space was a space satisfying Axioms 0 and all four parts of Axiom 1.
A metrizable Moore space is complete if and only if it admits a complete met-
ric. Furthermore, a completely regular Moore space is complete if and only
if it is ˇCech complete Creede [1971]. Each complete Moore space has the
Baire property.
A Moore space is completable if it can be embedded in a complete Moore
space.
The ﬁrst example of a non-completable Moore space was given in
Mary Ellen Rudin’s Thesis (see (Estill) Rudin [1950]).
In [1965] Fitz-
patrick showed that each completable Moore space has a dense metrizable
subspace, hence the ccc, non-separable Moore space constructed by Pixley
and Roy in [1969] is also non-completable.
A separable, non-completable
Moore space was constructed by the author in Reed [1972a].
In [1974],
Przymusi´nski and Tall showed that the Pixley-Roy space on a Q-set is
a normal Moore space. Hence, under MA + ¬CH, there exists a normal,
non-completable Moore space.
A necessary and suﬃcient condition for a
Moore space to be completable was given by Whipple in [1966].
An important concept in the analysis of completions of Moore spaces is
that of a π-base.
Recall that a π-base for a space is a collection of non-
empty open sets such that each non-empty open set in the space contains a
member of the collection. In [1967], Fitzpatrick showed that a Moore space
has a σ-discrete π-base if and only if it has a development satisfying Moore’s
metrization criterion at each point of a dense metrizable subset; this was later
extended by White who showed in [1978] that a Moore space has a dense
metrizable subset if and only if it has a σ-disjoint π-base. In Reed [1971a], the
author gave an example of a Moore space with a σ-disjoint base but without
a σ-discrete π-base.
In Reed [1974b] the author showed that a Moore space can be densely
embedded in a developable T2-space with the Baire property if and only if it
has a σ-discrete π-base. Thus, the normal Moore space under MA + ¬CH
from Przymusi´nski and Tall [1974] cannot even be densely embedded in
a developable T2-space with the Baire property. However, in [1974] Fleiss-
ner showed that under V = L, each normal Moore space is collectionwise
Hausdorﬀ. In [1967] Fitzpatrick showed that each normal collectionwise
HausdorﬀMoore space has a σ-discrete π-base. Hence, under V = L, we have
that each normal Moore space can be densely embedded in a developable
T2-space with the Baire property.

§3]
Chain Conditions
169
Problem 2.6. Is it true that a Moore space can be densely embedded in a 303. ?
Moore space with the Baire property if and only if it has a σ-discrete π-base?
Problem 2.7. Can each normal Moore space of weight ≤c be embedded in 304. ?
a separable Moore space?
In [1969] Jim Ott raised the question as to whether each Moore space of
weight ≤c can be embedded in a separable Moore space. In Reed [1976], the
author gave several partial solutions, including a positive answer for locally
compact Moore spaces of weight ≤ω1. In [1980] van Douwen and Przy-
musi´nski extended the same proof technique to obtain a positive answer for
all Moore spaces of weight ≤ω1. Furthermore, they gave an example con-
sistent with ZFC of a Moore space of weight c which cannot be embedded
in a separable Moore space. Hence Ott’s original question was shown to be
independent of and consistent with ZFC.
Again the question with regard to normality is related to submetrizability.
In [1977] Przymusi´nski showed that each cometrizable Moore space is a
closed subspace of a separable Moore space.
Hence, each normal, locally
compact Moore space of weight ≤c can be embedded as a closed subset of a
separable Moore space.
3. Chain Conditions
The study of chain conditions in Moore spaces is a very rewarding area for
those like the author who think that a theorem is but a poor consolation for
the lack of an interesting counterexample. The story of chain conditions in
Moore spaces is the search for interesting, non-trivial counterexamples.
The ﬁrst example of a ccc, nonseparable Moore space was given in (Es-
till) Rudin [1950] (one of the most horrendous constructions known to
mankind). Fortunately, a simple example (in fact, arguably the most nat-
ural non-metrizable Moore space) was given by Pixley and Roy in [1969].
Examples of Moore spaces with the DCCC but not the ccc were given by the
author in Reed [1974a], where he also noted that DFCC Moore spaces (DFCC
is equivalent to pseudocompactness for completely regular Moore spaces) are
separable. In Van Douwen and Reed [19∞], Eric van Douwen and the
author showed that the productivity of the ccc in Moore spaces is consistent
with and independent of ZFC, whereas there is a DCCC Moore space in ZFC
whose square is not DCCC.
Problem 3.1. Is each starcompact Moore space compact?
305. ?
Several questions concerning chain conditions in Moore spaces were raised
in Reed [1974a]. Most of these questions were answered in van Douwen and

170
Reed / Moore Spaces
[ch. 9
Reed [19∞]. However, van Douwen and the author were unable to decide
if there existed a 3-separable (equals DCCC) Moore space which was not 2-
separable (see Reed [1971a] and Reed [1974a] for details). The following
deﬁnitions arose in the attempt to analyze this question.
A space X is said to be n-starcompact if for every open cover U of X, there
is some ﬁnite subset V of U such that stn( V, U) = X.
A space X is said to be strongly n-starcompact if for every open cover U
of X, there is some ﬁnite subset B of X such that stn(B, U) = X.
A space X is said to be n-star Lindel¨of if for every open cover U of X,
there is some countable subset V of U such that stn( V, U) = X.
A space X is said to be strongly n-star Lindel¨of if for every open cover U
of X, there is some countable subset B of X such that stn(B, U) = X.
It is easy to see that if X is strongly n-starcompact then X is n-starcompact,
and if X is n-starcompact then X is strongly n + 1-starcompact. A similar
hierarchy holds for the star-Lindel¨of properties. For T3-spaces, strongly 1-
starcompact equals countably compact and n-starcompact equals the DFCC,
for n ≥2. For Moore spaces, 1-star Lindel¨of equals separable and n-star Lin-
del¨of equals the DCCC for n ≥2.
The existence of a 3-separable Moore space which is not 2-separable is
equivalent to the existence of a 2-star-Lindel¨of Moore space which is not
strongly 2-star-Lindel¨of. The author ﬁnally found such a Moore space in 1989
and presented it at the Oxford Topology Symposium. Actually, it was a space
he had constructed in 1987 as an example of a DCCC Moore space with a
σ-locally countable base (hence σ-para-Lindel¨of) which is not separable.
In investigating the above properties, van Douwen and the author were able
to give examples to show that all but three of the possibly distinct classes
in Moore spaces were in fact distinct. Ian Tree, a D.Phil. student at Ox-
ford, has recently pointed out the fact that strongly 2-starcompact is equiva-
lent to 2-starcompact for Moore spaces follows from results in Reed [1974a].
Hence, with the above result, there remains but one question. Let us call a
1-starcompact space simply starcompact. Is each starcompact Moore space
compact?
Eric van Douwen observed that the Tikhonov plank is starcompact but not
countably compact. Much later, the author showed that under b = ω1, a ﬁrst
countable space due to van Douwen and Nyikos given in van Douwen [1984]
is also such an example. Finally Bill Roscoe and the author were able to show
that under b = c, each starcompact Moore space is indeed compact. In fact,
it follows from the proof of this result that if X is a starcompact Moore space
which is not compact, then w(X) (the weight of X) is of countable coﬁnality
and b < w(X) < c.
The author acknowledges that the starcompact (and possibly the star-
Lindel¨of) properties have been studied by other authors under diﬀerent ter-
minology. In particular, upon a literature search it appears that the con-

§3]
Chain Conditions
171
cept of strong-starcompactness was introduced by Fleischman in his doctoral
thesis Fleischman [1970].
In [1986] Sarkhel introduced the concept of
starcompactness, and in [1984] Matveev deﬁned k-pseudocompactness in
a vein similar to the deﬁnitions of Fleischman. It is clear that the equiva-
lence of strongly 1-starcompact and countably compact and the equivalence
of strongly 3-starcompact and pseudocompact were known by some of these
authors. In addition, Scott Williams informed the author that he had inde-
pendently obtained certain of our lemmas about the weight of starcompact
Moore spaces in unpublished work.
Finally, Ian Tree, has completed the study of the above properties in Haus-
dorﬀspaces, and made several new connections between these properties and
well known topological structures (tree [1989]). A complete presentation of
the results mentioned here will appear in van Douwen, Reed, Roscoe and
Tree [19∞].
Problem 3.2. Does there exist in ZFC a Moore space with caliber (ω1, ω) 306. ?
whose square does not have caliber (ω1, ω)?
A topological space has caliber ω1 (respectively, caliber (ω1, ω)) if every
point-countable (respectively, point-ﬁnite) family of non-empty open sets is
countable, and has Property K if every uncountable family of non-empty open
sets has an uncountable linked (= pairwise non-disjoint) subfamily. Clearly,
separability implies caliber ω1, caliber ω1 implies caliber (ω1, ω), and caliber
(ω1, ω) implies the ccc. At a seminar in Oxford in 1987, Steve Watson showed
that, although the product of two separable spaces is always separable, and
it is consistent and independent that the product of two ccc spaces has ccc,
there is an example in ZFC of two spaces with caliber (ω1, ω) such that their
product lacks caliber (ω1, ω) (Watson and Zhou [1989]). The example given
was not ﬁrst-countable, and the author raised the question as to whether a
ﬁrst-countable example, or even a Moore space example, could be found. In
particular, since caliber ω1 is preserved by arbitrary products, it was unclear
whether caliber (ω1, ω) was in fact equivalent to caliber ω1 or the ccc for
Moore spaces.
In Reed [1974c], the author noted that his Moore space machine over a
ﬁrst countable T3-space produced a separable (respectively, ccc or DCCC)
Moore space if and only if the original space had the same property. Dave
McIntyre, a D.Phil. student at Oxford, has shown that the same situation
is true for the properties given above. Hence, it is suﬃcient to study only
ﬁrst countable T3-spaces. All the implications between the above calibers and
chain conditions have now been established for Moore spaces. Most of these
implications are due to McIntyre [1988]. In particular, using techniques
from van Douwen and Reed [19∞], McIntyre has shown that a Moore space
over a Souslin line has caliber (ω1, ω) but its square does not.

Reed / Moore Spaces
[ch. 9
An example of a Moore space in ZFC with caliber (ω1, ω) but not caliber
ω1 is given in Reed and McIntyre [19∞]. McIntyre has however now shown
that the square of this space does have caliber (ω1, ω). In fact, he deﬁnes a
space X to have property Kω if, for every family {Uα : α ∈ω1} of non-empty
open sets, there is an uncountable subset Λ of ω1 such that for each Γ ⊆Λ
with cardinality Γ = ω, 
α∈Γ Uα ̸= ∅. He then establishes that if X has
property Kω and Y has caliber (ω1, ω), then X × Y has caliber (ω1, ω). The
above Moore space example is shown to have property Kω.
Hence, the original question remains open in ZFC.
4. The collectionwise Hausdorﬀproperty
Although somewhat a red herring enroute to a solution of the normal Moore
space conjecture, this property has proved interestingly diﬃcult to investigate
and important in its set-theoretic implications.
Problem 4.1. Does there exist a σ-discrete, collectionwise Hausdorﬀnon-
? 307.
normal Moore space in ZFC?
The question of whether there exists a CWH non-normal Moore space was
ﬁrst raised by R. L. Moore to his students. The existence of such a space
was announced by John Worrell in 1964, but never published in the liter-
ature (although it apparently did appear in his thesis at the University of
Texas). The author presented a simple ﬁrst countable T3-space example at
a January, 1975 AMS meeting (Reed [1975b]). Moore space examples were
subsequently given under MA by Alster and Pol [1975], and ﬁnally in ZFC
by Wage in [1976]. The above question involving σ-discreteness reduces the
problem to its essence; it was often raised by the author in the early 1970’s. In
van Douwen and Wage [1979], it was given a positive answer under p = c.
The ZFC case remains open.
Problem 4.2. Does there exist a collectionwise HausdorﬀMoore space in
? 308.
ZFC which is not collectionwise normal w.r.t. compact sets?
A variety of such spaces were given by the author in Reed [1983] under
CH, MA, and other assumptions. However the existence of such a space in
ZFC remains open.
5. Embeddings and subspaces
Problem 5.1. Can each separable, complete Moore space be embedded in a
? 309.
DFCC Moore space?

§5]
Embeddings and subspaces
173
The DFCC is equivalent to Moore-closed in Moore spaces, and, as men-
tioned earlier, is equivalent to pseudocompact for completely regular Moore
spaces. Each DFCC Moore space is complete and separable (Green [1974]
and Reed [1974a]). This question is the remaining open question from the
list in Reed [1974a].
Problem 5.2. Can each locally compact, separable Moore space be densely 310. ?
embedded in a pseudocompact Moore space?
Each locally compact, separable Moore space can be embedded in a locally
compact, pseudocompact Moore space, and each such space which is zero-
dimensional at each point of a countable dense subset can be densely embed-
ded Reed [1976]. There exists a pseudocompact Moore space which contains
a copy of all metric spaces of weight ≤c (van Douwen and Reed [19∞]).
This question was also raised in Stephenson [1987], where much useful
information can be found. A related question from Stephenson [1987] is
the following: Can each locally DFCC, separable Moore space be densely
embedded in a DFCC Moore space?
Problem 5.3. Does there exist in ZFC a ﬁrst countable, perfect T3-space 311. ?
with no dense Moore subset?
From Reed [1972b], this is equivalent to asking for such a space with no
dense σ-discrete subset. Any ﬁrst countable L-space is a counterexample. It
is also not known in general in ZFC if there exist perfect, linearly ordered
T3-spaces or even simply perfect T3-spaces with no dense σ-discrete subsets.
These latter two questions have been independently raised by Dave Lutzer
and Bob Stephenson, respectively.
In Reed [1975a], the author gives an example in ZFC of a paracompact
ﬁrst countable T3-space which contains no dense Moore subset.
Problem 5.4. Under MA + ¬CH, does there exist a Moore space which is 312. ?
not the union of fewer than c metrizable subsets?
This question is from van Douwen, Lutzer, Pelant and Reed [1980],
where it was shown that
(1) each Moore space is the union of c closed metrizable subsets,
(2) there is a separable Moore space which is the union of ω1 closed metriz-
able subsets but which is not the union of fewer than ω1 metrizable
subsets, and
(3) under MA + ¬CH, there exists a Moore space which is not the union
of fewer than c closed metrizable subsets.

6. The point-countable base problem for Moore spaces
In Collins, Reed and Roscoe [19∞, this volume], the authors discuss
an open problem about the characterization of T1-spaces having a point-
countable base. As indicated, it is known that the property in question in
that paper suﬃces in the class of Moore spaces. There is however an older
problem in Moore spaces which is similar in many respects.
A base B for a space X is said to be uniform (respectively, weakly uniform)
if for each p ∈X and each inﬁnite subcollection H of B, each member of
which contains p, H is a local base for p (respectively, ∩H = {p}). A T3-space
has a uniform base if and only if it is a metacompact Moore space (Alek-
sandrov [1960] and Heath [1964]). Weakly uniform bases were deﬁned by
Heath and Lindgren in [1976].
In Davis, Reed and Wage [1976], the authors gave an example in ZFC
of a non-metacompact Moore space with a weakly uniform base. They also
showed that a Moore space having a weakly uniform base and with density
≤ω1 (in fact, with no more than ω1 isolated points) has a point-countable
base. However, under MA+ω2 < 2ω, they constructed a normal Moore space
with a weakly uniform base but without a point-countable base. The following
remains an open and interesting question:
Problem 6.1.
Is it consistent with ZFC that each Moore space with a
? 313.
weakly uniform base has a point countable base?
A more general issue concerns the existence in ZFC of any Moore space
with no point-countable base yet in which each subspace of cardinality ≤ω1
has a point-countable base. It is possible that under a supercompact reﬂection,
no such Moore space exists (see Tall [1988]).
7. Metrization
We close with two metrization questions. One is quite natural; the other is a
bit technical.
Problem 7.1.
Is each locally compact, locally connected pseudocompact
? 314.
Moore space metrizable?
In particular, one might ask if each pseudocompact Moore manifold (i.e.,
locally Euclidian) is metrizable. The existence of locally compact, pseudo-
compact non-compact Moore spaces such as the space constructed by Zippin
in [1934] or the space Ψ in Gillman and Jerison [1976] is a major feature
of Moore space pathology. A locally compact, locally connected Moore space
containing Ψ as a subset is given in Cook [1970]. It is easy to see that a pseu-
docompact Moore space is metrizable if it is pseudonormal or if it has a regular

§7]
Metrization
175
Gδ-diagonal. A related question concerns the existence of a locally compact,
locally connected pseudonormal Moore space which is not metrizable.
Problem 7.2. Is it consistent with ZFC that each (star-reﬁning)-paracom- 315. ?
pact Moore space is metrizable?
We now know that it is independent of and consistent with ZFC that count-
ably paracompact separable Moore spaces are metrizable (Wage, Fleissner
and Reed [1976]. The intended question here is to ﬁnd the right “metriza-
tion” property which is implied by (countably paracompact + separability)
and which can be proved both independent of and consistent with ZFC for
Moore spaces in general, without the use of large cardinals.
In an attempt to ﬁnd such a property, the author deﬁned the concept of
(star-reﬁning)-paracompact (sr-paracompact) spaces in Reed [1980]. [Note
the original name was starcompact, however it is changed here to avoid con-
fusion with the starcompact deﬁnitions in section 3.] A space X is said to
be sr-paracompact provided if U is a collection of open sets covering X, then
there exists a locally ﬁnite collection F of open sets covering X and reﬁning
{st(x, U) : x ∈X}.
Observe that a countably paracompact, separable space is clearly sr-para-
compact. Hence under MA+¬CH, there exist sr-paracompact Moore spaces
which are not normal (Reed [1980]) and normal, sr-paracompact Moore spaces
which are not metrizable (Tall [1969]). In addition, it is easily seen that
metacompact, sr-paracompact spaces are paracompact. Thus, under MA +
¬CH, there also exist normal Moore spaces which are not sr-paracompact
(e.g., normal, metacompact, nonmetrizable Moore spaces such as Heath’s “V-
space” over a Q-set).
The author had earlier considered sr-screenable and sr-strongly screenable
spaces with locally ﬁnite being replaced by σ-disjoint and σ-discrete, respec-
tively (Reed [1971b]). Note that any separable space is sr-strongly screenable,
whereas the tangent disc space over the real line is clearly (use a second cate-
gory argument) not sr-paracompact. Hence, there exist sr-strongly screenable
Moore spaces which are not sr-paracompact. The author does not know if
each sr-paracompact Moore space is sr-strongly screenable. However, in [1978]
Przymusi´nski has given an example of a Moore space with a locally ﬁnite
open cover which can not be reﬁned by a σ-discrete open cover. Clearly, for
normal Moore spaces, all three star-reﬁning properties are equivalent.
Finally, it is also an interesting question whether it is consistent without
large cardinals (perhaps, under V = L) that normal Moore spaces are sr-
paracompact. As observed by Miriam Brod in [1987], each sr-screenable
Moore space has a σ-disjoint separating open cover, hence each normal, sr-
paracompact Moore space is submetrizable.

8. Recent solutions
Two questions which the author had planned to include in this article have
recently been answered.
8.1. Theorem. It is consistent with ZFC that there exists a ∆-set which is
not a Q-set.
The concept of a ∆-set was originally deﬁned by the author in a lecture at
the 1975 Memphis State Topology Conference as a characterization of those
subsets of the real line over which a tangent disc space would be countably
paracompact. He raised the question of whether it was consistent with ZFC
to have a ∆-set which was not a Q-set, thereby producing a countably para-
compact, non-normal tangent disc space.
A ∆-set is an uncountable subset D of the real line such that for each
non-increasing sequence {Hn} of subsets of D with empty intersection, there
exists a sequence {Vn} of Gδ-sets w.r.t. D with empty intersection such that
for each n, Hn ⊆Vn.
Eric van Douwen observed that the term ‘Gδ-sets’ in the deﬁnition of a ∆-
set could be simply replaced by ‘open sets’. Furthermore, in [1977] Teodor
Przymusi´nski later proved that there exists a ∆-set if and only if there exists
a countably paracompact non-metrizable Moore space.
In [1989] Robin Knight has now shown the consistency with ZFC of
the existence of a ∆-set which is not a Q-set.
The remaining question is
whether this situation is also consistent with 2ω < 2ω1. If true, this would
show that CH could not be replaced by 2ω < 2ω1 in Fleissner’s the-
orem from [1978] that under CH, each countably paracompact, separable
Moore space is metrizable.
8.2. Theorem. There is an open-compact mapping from a Moore space to
ω1.
A. V. Arkhangel′ski˘ı asked the author if a countably compact T3-space
must be metrizable if it were the open-compact image of a T3 space with a
Gδ-diagonal. Recall that in [1973] Nagami proved that a compact T3-space
must be metrizable if it were the open-compact image of a Moore space, and
Chaber later obtained the same result for open compact images of T3-spaces
with a Gδ-diagonal.
The author has now answered Arkhangel′ski˘ı’s question in the negative.

A problem in Set Theoretic Topology which concerns us all, is, which prob-
lems are important?
There is no rational answer as the existence of this
volume proves. “Simple to state and diﬃcult to solve” is part of the answer,
although one can easily think of counterexamples to either of these require-
ments. “Either the theorem or the proof must have wide applications” or
“the question has been a stumbling block for many over many years” are
other aspects of an answer. Unlike, say Algebraic Topology, Abstract-Space-
General-Topology problems seem to me to be all over the map, often with
few recognizable relationships to each other, and very few hints as to which
problems are important. I have to work on a problem for a while to have any
feeling for its worth.
One looks for familiar pathologies and familiar set theoretic substructures.
The combinatorics may be ﬁnite and still very hard; one prefers for the com-
binatorics to be decidable in Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory together with the
Axiom of Choice (ZFC) but one must be aware that this may not be the
case. The problems I list here have mostly been listed in Rudin [1988]; I have
worked on all of them long enough to have some real respect for them; they
have all stood the test of time and labor by various people; and I feel any
solution to any of them would have applications at least to other problems
exhibiting similar pathologies. All spaces are assumed to be Hausdroﬀand
regular; actually most are assumed to be normal but I will always mention
this fact since the theme of these conjectures will be, how much strength can
you build into spaces by assuming normality?
I.
I have spent most of my time for the last several years working on
problems involving normal nonmetrizable manifolds.
A manifold here is just a locally Euclidean Hausdorﬀspace as opposed to
a metric one as in the usual deﬁnition. Our concern is usually metrizability
so we also assume that the manifold is connected.
I have shown in Rudin [1990] that ♦+ implies there is a normal not col-
lectionwise normal (but collectionwise Hausdorﬀ) manifold. Tall [1988] and
Balogh [19∞] have shown that it is consistent with ZFC that all normal
manifolds are collectionwise normal (and thus collectionwise Hausdorﬀ.) It
would be very nice to prove:
Conjecture 1. Every normal manifold is collectionwise Hausdorﬀ.
316. ?
I believe strongly that (1) is true, but I have no idea how to begin a proof.
Proving (2) would give an example that would amaze me.
Conjecture 2. There is a normal, nonmetrizable manifold with a countable, 317. ?
point separating, open cover.
That is, for every p ̸= q in the manifold, there is a member U of the
open family with p ∈U and q ̸∈U. If one instead assumes Hausdorﬀtype

Rudin / Some Conjectures
[ch. 10
separation, the resulting manifold is easily proved to be metrizable. I have
shown in Rudin [1989] that the Continuum Hypothesis implies (2); and the
manifold constructed is also a Dowker space. Balogh [1983] has proved that
Martin’s Axiom implies that a manifold satisfying (2) must have Lindel¨of
number = c. I have given an example of a normal separable, nonmetrizable
manifold in Rudin [1990]. I fear this conjecture is false, but I would like for
it to be true.
II.
The normal, not collectionwise normal pathology is a basic one. A
proof of Dowker’s set theory conjecture would not yield a manifold but would
give an especially elegant example of a 1-dimensional, connected, simplicial
complex, with the stars of all the vertices open, which is normal but not
collectionwise normal.
Conjecture 3. (Dowker [1952]) There is a set S and a ﬁlter F on S such
? 318.
that
(a) If F: S →F, then there is x ̸= y in S with y ∈F(x) and x ∈F(y),
but
(b) If X ⊂S, there is an F: S →F such that, for all x ∈X and y ∈
(S −X), either y ̸∈F(x) or x ̸∈F(y).
Dowker proves in [1952] that any example proving (3) must have |S| ≥ω2.
I prove in Rudin [1984] that one can choose S = R and deﬁne a separate ﬁl-
ter Fx for each x ∈S, and then, requiring that F(x) ∈Fx and F(y) ∈Fy,
satisfy (a) and (b). This construction yields a simplicial complex with the de-
sired properties and it enabled me to construct the normal, not collectionwise
normal, manifold in Rudin [1990]. However, after forty years we essentially
know only one way to construct a normal, not collectionwise normal, space:
use Bing’s G from [1951]; my construction uses Bing’s G. However to prove
Dowker’s conjecture, a problem of the same era as Bing’s G, we need a dif-
ferent technique. A diﬀerent technique would be very interesting; and it is
this fact which makes me push for a solution to this rather esoteric sounding
question.
III. Speaking of Dowker brings us to consider the Dowker space pathology.
A space is said to be a Dowker space if it is normal but not countably
paracompact; equivalently (Dowker [1951]), it is normal but its product
with an ordinary closed unit interval (or with any nondiscrete compact metric
space) is not normal. This pathology occurs in many classes of abstract spaces.
We know of the existence of only one such space (Rudin [1971]). It has few
nice properties; its cardinality and weight are (ℵω)ω. On the other hand, by
making various special set theoretic assumptions, we can prove the existence
of Dowker spaces having a remarkable variety of additional properties, many
of them with all of their cardinal functions small.
I have mentioned that

ch. 10]
Rudin / Some Conjectures
187
the Continuum Hypothesis implies the existence of a Dowker manifold with
a countable point separating open cover (Rudin [1989]); the character of this
space is, of course, countable while its weight and cardinality are ω1.
Conjecture 4. There is a Dowker space of cardinality ω1.
319. ?
This particular conjecture is picked out of a hat. I would be equally happy
to see a Dowker space of cardinality c; or one could replace cardinality in the
conjecture by some other cardinal function; or one could ask for a Dowker
square of two countably paracompact spaces (Beˇslagiˇc [19∞] has recently
constructed such a Dowker space assuming the Continuum Hypothesis.) What
I want is another Dowker space. After 20 years it is time. In any problem
where Dowker spaces are required, we can only give a consistency example
unless our one peculiar example can be modiﬁed to give an answer. It seems a
ridiculous state of aﬀairs. Of course part of the problem may be that we also
have few models for set theory in which we know that some class of Dowker
spaces does not exist.
A Dowker space problem on which I, personally, have spent too much time
is:
Conjecture 5. Every normal space with a σ-disjoint base is paracompact.
320. ?
This would be a beautiful theorem and I think it is true.
If there is a
counterexample, it must be a Dowker space (Nagami [1955]). In Rudin [1983]
I give an example of a screenable Dowker space constructed assuming ♦++;
the construction is messy and falls short of having a σ-disjoint base; it gives
me reason to hope that (5) is correct.
IV.
I consider conjecture (5) to be a generalized metric problem: after all,
a σ-locally ﬁnite base guarantees that a (regular) space is metrizable. There
are many problems in Set Theoretic Topology which ask about pathologies
that can perhaps occur in nonmetrizable spaces which imitate metrizability
in some way. Another old problem of this type in which I have only recently
become interested is:
Conjecture 6. M3 spaces are M1.
321. ?
In [1961] Ceder deﬁned M1, M2, and M3 spaces and proved that M1 ⇒
M2 ⇒M3. Gruenhage [1976] and Junnila [1978] proved that M3 = M2.
But whether M3 ⇒M1 or not is still unknown; and it would be a very nice
theorem if true.
A pseudobase for a space X is a family B of subsets of X such that, for every
x ∈X and neighborhood U of x, there is a B ∈B with x ∈(interior B) ⊂B ⊂
U. A space is M3 provided it has a σ-closure preserving closed pseudobase, and

188
Rudin / Some Conjectures
[ch. 10
M1 provided it has a σ-closure preserving open base. Gruenhage [1980] has
given an excellent survey of the partial results on this problem. Conjecture (6)
seems much less set theoretic to me than (5) and I would, therefore, expect
a real theorem or counterexample in this case (while I fear an undecidability
result for (5)).
Another class of generalized metric spaces for which there is an oddly dif-
ﬁcult conjecture is what I call Collins spaces.
One should be aware that
Mike Reed and Bill Roscoe are at least as involved with these spaces as Peter
Collins; but my contact has always been through Collins and so this is my
name for them.
A Collins space is one in which each point x has a special countable open
base Bx with the property that, if U is a neighborhood of a point y there
is a neighborhood V of y such that, for all x ∈V there is a B ∈Bx with
y ∈B ⊂U.
A rather easy theorem from Collins, Reed, Roscoe and
Rudin [1985] shows that a space is metrizable if and only if Bx’s can be
chosen for each x in such a way that the terms of each Bx form a nested,
decreasing, sequence.
Conjecture 7. Every Collins space has a point-countable base.
? 322.
Trivially every space with a point-countable base is a Collins space; and
every Collins space with a dense subset of cardinality ≤ω1 has a point-
countable base. One can prove a number of other very easy theorems like:
every open cover of a Collins space has a point-countable reﬁnement. However
the actual conjecture is hard to pin down. In truth I feel there must be a
counterexample to (7).
In her thesis of [1981], Caryn Navy constructed a variety of very pretty
normal, para-Lindel¨of but not paracompact spaces. All of Navy’s spaces were
countably paracompact and not collectionwise normal; one has to wonder if
this was an accident. The techniques used by Navy led to counterexamples for
several important metrization problems in which noncollectionwise normality
was the required pathology, see Rudin [1983] and Fleissner [1982].
Conjecture 8. Every normal, nonparacompact para-Lindel¨of space fails to
? 323.
be collectionwise normal.
Normal para-Lindel¨of seems like a nice property to me and much weaker
than paracompactness. No one has really explored the diﬀerence and, having
been useful once, it seems to me it might be useful again. This is perhaps the
most esotericly vague of my conjectures, but it is a pet idea.
V.
Normality in products (and the related shrinking of open covers) is
perhaps more important to me than to others for it has been a life-long theme
in my mathematics.

ch. 10]
Rudin / Some Conjectures
189
An open cover V = {Vα | α < κ} is a (closed) shrinking of an open cover
{Uα | α < κ} if Vα ⊂Uα for all α.
A space is normal if every ﬁnite open cover has a shrinking. A space is
Dowker if ω is the minimal cardinality of an open cover without a shrinking.
We deﬁne a space to be a κ-Dowker space (Rudin [1985]) if κ is the minimal
cardinality of an open cover which has no shrinking.
If κ is the minimal cardinality of a nondiscrete subset of a space X, then
the product of X with any κ-Dowker space is not normal.
We know exactly one (real) κ-Dowker space for each inﬁnite cardinal κ, see
Rudin [1985]. Under the assumption ♦++ we know exactly one normal space
all of whose monotone open covers have a shrinking having an open cover
with no shrinking, see Beˇslagiˇc and Rudin [1985].
Just as one example of a Dowker space does not suﬃce, one example of a
κ-Dowker space for uncountable κ does not suﬃce to give us much insight into
the possible pathologies and theorems in this area. In the case of uncountable
κ we even have a serious shortage of consistency results. This is a plea, not for
the proof of one conjecture, but for a cottage industry into our understanding
of normality in products.
I present a somewhat tongue-in-cheek proof that normality in products is
important:
(T): Tamano’s theorem [1960] that X is paracompact if and only if X ×Y
is normal for all compact Y .
(D): Dowker’s theorem [1951] that X is normal and countably paracom-
pact if and only if X × Y is normal for all compact metric Y .
Morita’s Conjectures (Morita [1975]):
M(a): X is discrete if and only if X × Y is normal for all normal Y .
M(b): X is metric if and only if X ×Y is normal for all Y such that Y ×M
is normal for all metric M.
M(c): X is metric and σ-locally compact if and only if X × Y is normal
for all normal countably paracompact Y .
The existence of κ-Dowker spaces for all κ, gives us M(a).
In [1975]
Morita proves that M(c) follows from M(b). In Chiba, Przymusi´nski
and Rudin [1986] it is shown that M(b) holds if and only if:
Conjecture 9.
There is an uncountable monotone open cover without a 324. ?
shrinking of a space X such that X × M is normal for all metric M.
In Beˇslagiˇc and Rudin [1985] it is shown that ♦implies (9).
If one wants a product to be normal, one needs a lot of structure on at least
one of the spaces. Structural problems are still diﬃcult even when one requires
one factor to be metric or compact, for instance. Some elementary sounding
problems which Beˇslagiˇc points out are diﬃcult (and unsolved) include:
(A) Given X × Y normal, Y compact, and every open cover of X has a 325. ?

190
Rudin / Some Conjectures
[ch. 10
shrinking. Does every open cover of X × Y have a shrinking?
(B) Given every open cover of X has a shrinking, and Y is a normal, perfect
? 326.
preimage of X. Does every open cover of Y have a shrinking?
(C) Given X is normal and Y is a collectionwise normal perfect image of X.
? 327.
Is X collectionwise normal?
VI.
The Lindel¨of property, like normality, is a delicate property; spaces
with strange open covers are hard to construct and they misbehave in prod-
ucts. A conjecture I worked on 25 years ago is:
13. The Linearly-Lindel¨of conjecture
? 328.
(Howes [1970] and Miˇsˇcenko [1962]): There is a normal, non-Lindel¨of space,
every monotone open cover of which has a countable subcover.
Interestingly enough there are still no signiﬁcant partial results.
Another beautiful “Lindel¨of” problem is:
14. Michael’s Conjecture (Michael [1971]): There is a Michael space.
? 329.
A Michael space is a Lindel¨of space whose product with the irrationals is
not Lindel¨of (or equivalently not normal). The space itself being regular and
Lindel¨of is, of course, normal.
In [1971] Michael gave an example, assuming the Continuum Hypothesis,
of a Michael space. More recently Alster [19∞] has constructed an example
from Martin’s Axiom. A new paper by Lawrence [19∞b] shows, among
other things, that there is a concentrated-Michael-space if and only if b =
ω1.
A space X is concentrated on a subset A if; for every open U ⊃A,
X −U is countable. A concentrated-Michael-space is one concentrated on a
closed subset A for which A× (irrationals) is normal. Michael’s example is
concentrated; but since ω1 < b is consistent with Martin’s Axiom, Alster’s
example is not concentrated. The number b is the minimal cardinality of an
≤∗unbounded family in ωω. If the Continuum Hypothesis is true b = ω1;
under Martin’s Axiom, b = c.
The most important unsolved Lindel¨of problem is surely:
Conjecture 15. There is an L-space.
? 330.
An L-space is a hereditarily Lindel¨of (regular) space which is not separable.
The best reading on the subject is Todorˇcevi´c’s new book [1989]; a com-
plete biography on the problem would take a small book. After much eﬀort
by many, Todorˇcevi´c has shown that the existence of S-spaces (hereditarily

191
separable non-Lindel¨of) is undecidable in ZFC. It has long been known to be
consistent with ZFC that there be both S and L spaces. Both pathologies
frequently occur in abstract space problems.
VII.
Box products are by their nature pathological, but they have been
and hard enough to please anyone. What one would like to know is which
box products are normal and which are paracompact.
I recommend van
Douwen [1980] and Williams [1984] for general information on the subject
and earlier references.
Early on it was proved by Kunen and me that the Continuum Hypothesis
implies that every box product of countably many locally compact, separable,
metric spaces (or countably many compact ordinals) is paracompact. Kunen
and van Douwen showed that for some countably many compact spaces of
character > ω1, the box product need not be normal.
Then van Douwen
showed that no nontrivial box product of metric spaces is normal if one factor
is the irrationals. Lawrence [19∞a] more recently showed that b = d or
c = d implies that every countable box product of countable metric spaces
is paracompact. (The same is true for locally compact metric spaces.) d is
the minimal cardinality of a ≤∗dominant (coﬁnal) family in ωω. The basic
problems remain:
Conjecture 16.
Every box product of ω1 copies of (ω + 1) is normal (or 331. ?
paracompact).
Conjecture 17.
Every box product of ω copies of (ω + 1) is normal (or 332. ?
paracompact).
One peculiarity is that normality and paracompactness in box products
seem hard to separate. The other is that we know almost nothing, even of a
consistency nature, about uncountable box products.
We have only touched the surface in this area.

1. Deﬁnitions and set-theoretic problems
Let ω denote the set of natural numbers, [ω]ω the set of all inﬁnite subsets of
ω and ωω the set of all functions from ω into ω. We give a brief discussion of
some problems which involve cardinal numbers deﬁned from various properties
on these and related sets such as the real and the irrational numbers. For
background on small cardinals, we refer to the article by Eric van Douwen, van
Douwen [1984]. In that article, van Douwen deﬁned eight small cardinals,
and studied six of them in detail. We take these eight cardinals as our starting
point, and begin with some preliminary deﬁnitions.
Two countable, inﬁnite sets are almost disjoint provided their intersection
is ﬁnite. A family of pairwise almost disjoint subsets of a set X is maximal
provided it is not properly contained in another pairwise almost disjoint family
of subsets of X. Let P(X) denote the power set of X, [X]ω the set of all
countably inﬁnite subsets of X, and [X]<ω the set of all ﬁnite subsets of X.
For A, B in [ω]ω, we say A is almost included in B (denoted A ⊂∗B)
provided A −B is ﬁnite.
For a family F ⊂[ω]ω, we say that F has the strong ﬁnite intersection
property provided every ﬁnite subfamily has an inﬁnite intersection, and an
inﬁnite set A is called a pseudointersection of F provided A⊂∗F for all F ∈F.
A family T ⊂[ω]ω is a (decreasing) tower provided there exist an ordinal
α and a bijection f: α →T such that β < γ < α imlies that f(γ) ⊂∗f(β),
and no inﬁnite set A is a pseudointersection of T .
A family U ⊂[ω]ω generates an ultraﬁlter (or is an ultraﬁlter base) provided
every ﬁnite intersection of elements of U contains an element of U, and for
every A ∈[ω]ω either there exists U ∈U such that U ⊂A, or there exists
U ∈U such that U ⊂ω −A. An ultraﬁlter base U is called free (or non-
principal) provided  U = ∅.
A family I ⊂[ω]ω is an independent family provided for every A, B ∈[I]<ω,
if A ̸= ∅and A ∩B = ∅then  A − B ̸= ∅.
A family S ⊂[ω]ω is a splitting family provided for every A ∈[ω]ω there
exists S ∈S such that |A ∩S| = |A −S| = ω.
We deﬁne the mod ﬁnite order ≤∗(a reﬂexive transitive order) on the set ωω
as follows: for f, g ∈ωω we say f ≤∗g provided there exists N ∈ω such that
for all n ≥N, f(n) ≤g(n).
A set X ⊂ωω is dominating (in the mod ﬁnite order) provided for every
f ∈ωω there exists g ∈X such that f ≤∗g, and X is bounded (in the mod
ﬁnite order) if there exists g ∈ωω such that f ≤∗g for all f ∈X.
We denote the cardinality of the continuum by c. Since German type is
often used for this cardinal, van Douwen and I used this same convention in
the mnemonic notation for the following cardinals which have been studied
under a variety of names (see Hechler [1972], van Douwen [1984, p.123],
and Vaughan [1979b]). When German type is not available, we use ordinary
197

198
Vaughan / Small Cardinals
[ch. 11
letters for these cardinals (including the cardinality of the continuum). The
mnemonic is derived from the key concept in the deﬁnition of a cardinal. The
cardinal b is called the (un)bounding number, d is the dominating number,
s is the splitting number, p is derived from the notion of P-points, t is the
tower number, i is the independent family number, and u the ultraﬁlter char-
acter number. The cardinal a can be called the almost disjointness number
(unfortunately, mnemonic does not necessarily imply euphonic).
a = min{ |A| : A ⊂[ω]ω is an inﬁnite, maximal almost disjoint
family in ω}.
b = min{ |B| : B ⊂ωω is unbounded in the mod ﬁnite order }.
d = min{ |D| : D ⊂ωω is dominating in the mod ﬁnite order }.
s = min{ |S| : S ⊂[ω]ω is a splitting family on ω}.
p = min{ |P | : P ⊂[ω]ω has the strong ﬁnite intersection property
but no X ∈[ω]ω is a pseudointersection for P }.
t = min{ |T | : T ⊂[ω]ω is a tower on ω}.
i = min{ | I | : I ⊂[ω]ω is a maximal independent family on ω}.
u = min{ |U| : U ⊂[ω]ω is a base for an ultraﬁlter on ω}.
Diagram 1 below, the shape of which is based on a similar diagram of Blass
[1989], is intended to display the basic relations among these cardinals. A line
connecting two cardinals indicates that the cardinal lower on the diagram is
less than or equal to the cardinal higher on the diagram (in ZFC). It would
be nice if the line also indicated that it is consistent that the two cardinals are
diﬀerent. For example, Rothberger proved t ≤b, and there is a model where
t < b (see van Douwen [1984, 3.1 and 5.3]). This aspect of the diagram,
however, is not completely settled (see 1.1).
The proofs of the results implied by Diagram 1, or references to them, can be
found in van Douwen [1984], except for the recent result of Shelah [1990],
who proved in ZFC that d ≤i (he also mentions a model in which the
inequality “d < i” holds).
These results of Shelah are included with his
permission as an appendix to this paper.

The ﬁrst two of these inequalities are of interest because they concern four
of the six cardinals studied by van Douwen in [1984]. We believe that (a) is
the most interesting. Concerning (a): Rothberger proved that p > ω1 if and

only if t > ω1 (Fremlin [1984, 14D]), and Szyma´nski proved that p is regular
(van Douwen [1984, 3.1(e)]) and that t cannot be real-valued measurable
(Szyma´nski [1988]). Given 8 cardinals there are 64 −8 = 56 questions of the
form “is κ < λ”. For the above 8 cardinals, the questions in 1.1 are the only
ones of this form which remain open (see van Douwen [1984], Blass and
Shelah [1987, 1989], Shelah [1984, 1990]).
There are many small cardinals which have been studied. Some of them are
probably of more interest than some of those deﬁned above. One interesting
cardinal that has been discovered in several contexts is the cardinal h, called
the distributivity number (the reason for the letter “h” is given below). A
family D ⊂[ω]ω is called a dense family provided for every X ∈[ω]ω there
exists Y ∈D such that Y ⊂∗X, and D is called an open family provided for
every Y ∈D and every X ∈[ω]ω, if X ⊂∗Y then X ∈D. The ordered set
([ω]ω, ⊂∗) is called κ-distributive if every set of less than κ dense open families
has non-empty intersection. The distributivity number is deﬁned by
h = min{D : D is a set of dense open families in [ω]ω with  D = ∅}.

[ch. 11
Now t ≤h ≤b, and h ≤s; see Balcar, Pelant and Simon [1980]. The
letter h comes from the word “height” in the interesting result, proved by
Balcar, Pelant and Simon, that in ZFC one can prove that there exists a tree
π-base for ω∗, and further
h = min{κ : there exists a tree π-base for ω∗of height κ}
where, as usual, ω∗= βω −ω and a family B of non-empty open sets is called
a π-base for a space X provided every nonempty open set contains a member
of B. A tree π-base T is a π-base which is a tree when considered as a partially
ordered set under reverse inclusion (i.e., for every t ∈T the set {s ∈T : t ⊂s}
is well-ordered by “⊃”). The height of an element t ∈T is the ordinal α such
that {s ∈T : t ⊂s and s ̸= t} is of order type α, and the height of a tree T
is the smallest ordinal α such that no element of T has height α.
For any topological space, the Nov´ak number (Balcar, Pelant and Si-
mon [1980]) (resp. weak Nov´ak number (van Mill and Williams [1983]))
of X, denoted n(X) (resp. wn(X)), is the smallest number of nowhere dense
subsets of X needed to cover X (resp. to cover a dense subset of X).
We consider here only the case X = ω∗and write n = n(ω∗).
It is easy to see that ω2 ≤t+ ≤n(ω∗) ≤2c (Hechler [1978, 4.11]). The
equality wn(ω∗) = h was proved in Nyikos, Pelant and Simon [19∞], and
gives one way to see that h ≤n. In Balcar, Pelant and Simon [1980]
it is proved that h ≤min{b, cf(c)}. In Cohen’s original models of not-CH
one has h = b = ℵ1 < ℵ2 ≤n. Blass pointed out to us that to get a model
where n < b, start with a model of MA in which c is at least ℵ3, and add
ℵ1 random reals (giving h = ℵ1 and b ≥ℵ3), and apply Balcar, Pelant
and Simon [1980, 3.5(i)] which says that if h < c then n ≤h+. In [1984]
Shelah gave a model where h < s = b. Dow has determined the value of
h in a number of models. For example, he has a model where h = s < b
(Dow [1989]).
A family G ⊂[ω]ω is said to be groupwise dense (Blass [1989]) provided
(a) G is an open family, and
(b) for every family Π of inﬁnitely many pairwise disjoint ﬁnite subsets
of ω, the union of some (necessarily inﬁnite) subfamily of Π is in G.
Clearly every groupwise dense family is a dense open family. Deﬁne
g = min{ |G| : G is a set of groupwise dense families in [ω]ω with
 G = ∅}.
Obviously h ≤g and it is known that g ≤d (Blass [1989]). There is a model
of Blass and Shelah where u < g and h < g (Blass and LaFlamme [1989]).
Blass has proved that if u < g then b = u and g = d = c (Blass [19∞]).
The next number requires no further deﬁnitions:

§1]
Deﬁnitions and set-theoretic problems
201
as = min{ |A| : A is a maximal family of almost disjoint subsets
of ω × ω that are graphs of functions from subsets
of ω to ω}
Balcar and Simon proved that s ≤as, and a ≤as ≤c. Shelah has a model
where a < as, and another where s < b ≤a (Shelah [1984]).
Let (P, ≤) be a partially ordered set (poset). A set D ⊂P is said to be
dense provided for every p ∈P there exists d ∈D such that d ≤p. A set
G ⊂P is a ﬁlter provided (a) for every g ∈G and every p ∈P, if g ≤p then
p ∈G, and (b) for every g and g′ ∈G there exists r ∈G such that r ≤g and
r ≤g′. The set (P ≤) satisﬁes the ccc provided every antichain is countable
(i.e., if A ⊂P, and A is uncountable, then there exist distinct a and a′ ∈A
and r ∈P such that r ≤a and r ≤a′). Let “MA(κ) for ccc posets” (or
“MA(κ)” for short) be the statement: for every ccc partially ordered set and
every family D of no more than κ dense subsets of P, there exists a generic
ﬁlter G for D (i.e., G is a ﬁlter and G ∩D ̸= ∅for all D ∈D). Deﬁne
m = min{κ : MA(κ) for ccc posets fails }
Of course, Martin’s Axiom is the statement “m=c”.
Fremlin [1984] has given a proper class of deﬁnitions mΦ, where Φ is a
class of partially ordered sets, similar to the deﬁnition of m. We mention
two of these here. A poset P is called σ-centered if there exists a partition
{Pi : i ∈ω} of P such that each Pi is centered (i.e., if p, q ∈Pi then there
exists r ∈Pi such that r ≤p, and r ≤q). Deﬁne
mσ−centered = min{κ : “MA(κ) for σ-centered posets” fails },
mcountable = min{κ : “MA(κ) for countable posets” fails }.
Bell [1981] proved that p = mσ−centered, thus m ≤p ≤mcountable.
Let L(κ) be the statement: If P is a ccc partially ordered set of cardinality
≤κ, then P is σ-centered (Fremlin [1984, 41L]). Deﬁne
l = min{κ : L(κ) is false }.
In [1987] Todorˇcevi´c and Veliˇckovi´c have proved that m = l, and as
a corollary, the result of Fremlin [1984, 41C(d)]:
cf(m) > ω (also see
Kunen [1988] and Problem 1.3).
A family B is called a π-base for a free ultraﬁlter u on ω provided for every
U ∈u there exists B ∈B such that B ⊂U. Deﬁne
πu = min{ |B| : B ⊂[ω]ω is a π-base for a free ultraﬁlter on ω}.
The reﬁnement number is deﬁned by
r = min{ |R| : R ⊂[ω]ω for every X ∈[ω]ω there exists R ∈R
such that R ⊂∗X or R ⊂∗ω −X}.

Price [1982] was the ﬁrst to (implicitly) consider this cardinal, and it was
discovered independently by Vojt´aˇs [19∞], J. Cicho´n, and Beˇslagi´c and
van Douwen [19∞]. The last two looked at r from the following point of
view: A set R ∈[ω]ω is said to reap a family F ⊂[ω]ω provided for every
F ∈F, |F ∩R| = |F −R| = ω. Thus, r is the smallest cardinality of a family
F such that no set R ∈[ω]ω reaps F.
Balcar (unpublished) has shown that r = πu.
Clearly no set reaps the
Boolean algebra generated by a maximal independent family; so πu = r ≤i,
and clearly r = πu ≤u.
Goldstern and Shelah [19∞] have a model
where r < u (thus this is also a model where πu < u). Also see Just [19∞].
In [1982] Price noted a model where r = c (for another such model, see
Beˇslagi´c and van Douwen [19∞]). In this context, a plausible deﬁnition
of a small cardinal is the smallest cardinality of a family F such that every
inﬁnite set A ⊂ω contains a member of F. Rothberger [1948] pointed out,
however, that since there exist almost disjoint families of cardinality c, every
such family F has cardinality c.
For sets A, B in [ω]ω we say that A splits B provided the partition of B,
{B ∩A, B −A}, consists of two inﬁnite sets (i.e., |B ∩A| = |B −A| = ω).
Using this term, the cardinal s is the minimal cardinality of a family S of
subsets of ω such that every inﬁnite subset of ω is split by some member of
S, and r is the minimal cardinality of a family R of subsets of ω such that no
inﬁnite subset of ω splits every member of R. We now think of characteristic
functions of subsets of ω.
For f ∈2ω, and A ∈[ω]ω, we say limA f = i
provided i ∈2 and the subsequence f|A converges to i in the discrete space
{0, 1} (thus, f −1(1) splits A iﬀf −1(0) splits A iﬀlimA f does not exist).
The cardinals r and s can be formulated in terms of sequences of zeroes and
ones as follows: s is the minimal cardinality of a family S ⊂2ω such that
for every A ∈[ω]ω there exists f in S such that limA f does not exist. Also,
r is the minimal cardinality of a family R of subsets of ω such that for every
f ∈2ω there exists A in R such that limA f exists. This leads to the following
two cardinals deﬁned by Vojt´aˇs [1988, 19∞]. Let l∞denote the set of all
bounded real valued sequences. Here, of course, for f ∈l∞and A ∈[ω]ω,
we deﬁne limA f = x provided the sequence f|A converges to x in the usual
topology on R.
sσ = min{ |S| ⊂l∞: (∀A ∈[ω]ω)(∃f ∈S) limA f does not exist },
rσ = min{|R| ⊂[ω]ω : (∀f ∈l∞)(∃A ∈R) limA f exists }.
It is easily seen that s = sσ, and rσ ≥r, but it is not known if r = rσ.
Some other cardinals which have been considered are the Ramsey number
(which also is denoted by r) Kc, up, q and q0. The Ramsey number is the
smallest cardinality κ of a family of functions πα: [ω]2 →2 such that for
every X ∈[ω]ω there exists α < κ such that for every i ∈ω, |πα(X −
i)| = 2 (Ihoda [1988]).
Blass has recently proved (unpublished) that the

§1]
Deﬁnitions and set-theoretic problems
203
Ramsey number equals min{b, s}. The cardinal Kc is deﬁned to be the smallest
cardinality of a family F ⊂ωω such that for every A ∈[ω]ω there exists
f ∈F such that f(A) = ω. In Cohen’s original models of not-CH Kc = ℵ1
(Hechler [1973]), and Nyikos recently has proved (unpublished) s ≤Kc ≤d.
The cardinal up is deﬁned as the smallest cardinality of a base for a P-point
in ω∗if there exists a P-point, and is deﬁned to be c if there do not exist
any P-points (there are models of set theory in which P-points do not exist
(Wimmers [1982]). It is easy to see that rσ ≤up (Vojt´aˇs [19∞]). The
cardinal q is deﬁned as the smallest cardinal such that no set of reals of this
size or larger is a Q-set (Gruenhage and Nyikos [19∞]) (a set X ⊂R is
a Q-set provided every subset of X is a Gδ-set in the subspace topology of
X). In [1948] Rothberger proved that p ≤q, and it is consistent that p < q
(Fleissner and Miller [1980]). The cardinal q0 is deﬁned the supremum
of the set of cardinals κ such that every subset of R of cardinality strictly less
than κ is a Q-set (Gruenhage and Nyikos [19∞]).
We now deﬁne some cardinals related to measure and category. Let I be
an ideal of subsets of a set. Deﬁne
add(I) = min{ |J | : J ⊂I and  J /∈I},
cov(I) = min{ |J | : J ⊂I and  J = R},
non(I) = min{ |Y | : Y ⊂R and Y /∈I}, and
cf(I) = min{ |J | : J ⊂I and I = {P(E) : E ∈J } }.
These cardinals have been studied mainly for the set R of real numbers,
and the ideals of meager (= ﬁrst category) sets and Lebesgue null sets. There
seems to be no standard notation for these two important ideals. We will
denote the ideal of meager sets by K and the ideal of Lebesgue null sets by L.
The cardinal cov(K) has been considered under several names (Miller
[1981, 1982b]), and it is known that cov(K) = mcountable (the key idea is in
Grigorieff [1975], and an explicit proof is in Fremlin and Shelah [1979]).
Bartoszynski [1987] proved that cov(K) is the least cardinal of any F ⊂ωω
such that for every g ∈ωω there exists f ∈F such that f(n) ̸= g(n) for all
n ∈ω. The ideal F of nowhere dense sets of R has also been considered; for
example, Fremlin [19∞b, 3B(b), 1J(b)] has proved cf(F) = cf(K). The rela-
tions among these cardinals can be displayed in the following diagram (called
Cicho´n’s diagram, see Fremlin [1983/84])). We have redrawn Cicho´n’s di-
agram to follow the conventions of Diagram 1 (in addition, the dotted en-
closures indicate the following two results: add(K) = min{b, cov(K)}, and
cf(K) = max{d, non(K)}). In the case c = ω2, a number of people have com-
bined to give models for all cases which the diagram allows for assignment of
the values ω1, and ω2; see Bartoszynski, Judah and Shelah [19∞]. Thus,
the shape of Cicho´n’s diagram is settled.
Not much is known about the relations among the cardinals in Cicho´n’s dia-
gram and the other cardinals above. The following diagram of Vojt´aˇs indicates

some of the known results. Among them are cov(K) ≤r (Vojt´aˇs [19∞]),
t ≤add(K) (Piotrowski and Szyma´nski [1987]), b ≤non(K) (Roth-
berger [1941]). Also, s ≤non(L) and s ≤non(K) are attributed to J. Brzu-
chowski in Cicho´n [1981]. Note that cov(K) ≤d follows at once from Bar-
toszynski’s characterization of cov(K) mentioned in the preceeding paragraph.
Given the above cardinals, it is natural to consider their exponentiations
(i.e., 2κ, 22κ, and possibly further exponentiations), and their coﬁnalities (if
not regular in ZFC). It is natural to ask how these cardinals are related
to each other. Furthermore, there are occasions when one wants to look at

three or more of these cardinals at the same time. Indeed there are so many
“obvious” open question about these cardinals that it is not possible to list
them all here (an auxiliary problem is to ﬁnd the most interesting among
these questions). We mention several speciﬁc questions.
Problem 1.2. Can a and s be singular?
334. ?
Problem 1.3.
Can m be a singular cardinal of coﬁnality greater than ω1?
335. ?
See Kunen [1988].
Problem 1.4. (Vojt´aˇs [1988]) Is r = rσ?
336. ?
In a letter of October 1989, W. Just notes that if r < rσ, then either r < u,
or cf([u]ℵ0) > u, and in the latter case u ≥ℵω and there is an inner model
where the covering lemma fails.

206
Vaughan / Small Cardinals
[ch. 11
Problem 1.5. Can cf(cov(K)) = ω?
? 337.
None of the other have countable coﬁnality; see Bartoszynski [1988],
Bartoszynski and Ihoda [19∞], Bartoszynski, Ihoda and Shelah [19∞],
Bartoszynski and Judah [19∞], Fremlin [1983/84], Ihoda and She-
lah [19∞], and Miller [1982a].
Problem 1.6. Can cf(cov(K)) < cf(add(K))?
? 338.
The same question is open for measure zero sets; see Bartoszynski and
Ihoda [19∞] and Bartoszynski, Ihoda and Shelah [19∞].
Problem 1.7. Is t ≤add(K)?
? 339.
Piotrowski and Szyma´nski [1987] proved that t ≤add(K).
2. Problems in topology
With many problems in topology, it is not immediately obvious whether small
cardinals are involved or not. An example of this is the following rather old
problem, raised in [1963] by Michael:
Problem 2.1.
Is there a Lindel¨of space whose product with the space of
? 340.
irrational numbers is not normal?
Consistent examples are known: any Lindel¨of subspace of the Michael line
has non-normal product with the irrationals, but such spaces exist iﬀb = ω1
(van Douwen [1984, 10.2]).
Alster [19∞] has proved that under MA,
there is a space that shows the answer is “yes”.
In Alster’s result, how-
ever, W. Fleissner has pointed out that the part of MA that Alster used
can be stated in the notation of small cardinals as “b ≤cov(K)”. Fleissner
also noted that a model considered by Miller [1982b] satisﬁes “cov(K) < b”.
Lawrence [19∞b] has proved that if X is Lindel¨of and has non-normal prod-
uct with the irrationals, then both the weight and cardinality of X are at
least min{b, ℵω}. Thus, the possibility is raised that the answer to Michael’s
question might be equivalent to some statement involving small cardinals.
Another old question, raised in 1966, is the Scarborough-Stone problem
(Scarborough and Stone [1966]). A space is called sequentially compact
(resp. countably compact) provided every sequence in the space has a conver-
gent subsequence (resp. cluster point). The problem asks:
Problem 2.2.
Is every product of sequentially compact spaces countably
? 341.
compact?

§2]
Problems in topology
207
It was recently solved in the negative by Nyikos for the class of T2-spaces,
but for the classes of T3-spaces or T3 1
2 -spaces, the problem has been solved
(in the negative) so far only by assuming some extra axiom such as b = c
(van Douwen [1980a, 13.1]). It has also been solved in the negative in some
models where b < c (Nyikos and Vaughan [1987]). Also see Vaughan[1984].
A related problem raised by Comfort [1977] comes from the theorem of
Ginsburg and Saks that states: if X2
 is countably compact then Xα is count-
ably compact for all α (as was noted by Comfort, the proof of Ginsburg and
Saks yields that if {Xi : i ∈I} is a family of spaces such that for all J ⊂I with
|J| ≤2c, we have {Xi : i ∈J} is countably compact, then {Xi : i ∈I} is
countably compact). The problem asks:
Problem 2.3. Can 2c be replaced by a smaller cardinal in this result, i.e., 342. ?
is there a cardinal κ < 2c such that for every space X, if Xκ is countably
compact then every power of X is countable compact?
Examples of Z. Frol´ık show that the answer is in the negative under the
assumption of the generalized continuum hypothesis, and examples of V. Saks
(assuming MA + ¬CH and weaker statements) show the same thing (cf.
Vaughan [1984]).
Problem 2.4. Is every product of h sequentially compact spaces countably 343. ?
compact?
See Nyikos, Pelant and Simon [19∞].
Problem 2.5.
(Nyikos [19∞b]) Does there exist a compact space which 344. ?
can be mapped continuously onto [0, 1]s and has the following property: there
exists a countable dense subset D such that every sequence in D has a sub-
sequence that converges to some point in the space?
Problem 2.6. Is there a compact T2-space X with no non-trivial convergent 345. ?
sequences and |X| < 2s?
Nyikos pointed out to me that a construction of Fedorchuk [1977] can be
adapted to show that there exists such an X of cardinality 2s.
Problem 2.7. Are there two countably compact topological groups whose 346. ?
product is not countably compact?
Under MA (i.e., m = c) the answer was given in the aﬃrmative by van
Douwen [1980b], and using a diﬀerent technique Hart and van Mill [19∞]
proved that if mcountable = c, then there exists a countably compact group H
such that H ×H is not countably compact. The problem is still open in ZFC.

208

[ch. 11
As far I know, the following variation of the Scarborough-Stone problem is
also open:
Problem 2.8. Is every product of sequentially compact, topological groups
? 347.
countably compact?
A space is called Fr´echet (or Fr´echet-Urysohn) if every point in the closure
of a set is the limit of a convergent sequence in the set.
Problem 2.9.
Is there a countable Fr´echet topological group that is not
? 348.
metrizable?
Such groups have been constructed assuming ω1 < p, or p = b (Nyikos
[19∞a]). A Σ-product of uncountably many copies of {0, 1} is a countably
compact, non-compact Fr´echet topological group, hence not metrizable (see
Engelking [1989, 3.10.D]).
Problem 2.10.
Is there a separable, ﬁrst countable, countably compact,
? 349.
non-normal T2-space? Is there one, which is also almost compact (a space X
is called almost compact provided |βX −X| = 1)?
If “separable” is not required, then such examples exist which are ω-bounded
(Vaughan [1979a, 1988]).
Problem 2.11.
Is there a separable, ﬁrst countable, countably compact,
? 350.
non-compact T2-space?
This problem is discussed by Nyikos in this book.
Let µcc (resp. µsc) denote the cardinality of the smallest separable Hausdorﬀ
space with no isolated points which is countably (resp. sequentially) compact.
Problem 2.12. Is µcc = p? Is µsc = a? is it consistent that µcc < µsc?
? 351.
See Beˇslagi´c, van Douwen, Merrill and Watson [1987].
Problem 2.13. Is the box product of countably many copies of the rational
? 352.
numbers paracompact (normal)?
Lawrence [19∞a] proved that the answer is in the aﬃrmative under either
assumption b = d, or d = c.
Problem 2.14. Is the box product of countably many copies of the conver-
? 353.
gent sequence ω + 1 normal?

§3]
Questions raised by van Douwen in his Handbook article
209
See van Douwen [1980a] and Williams [1984].
Many of the concepts considered in this paper can be extended to higher
cardinals. To illustrate this, we list two such questions.
Problem 2.15. Does there exist a ﬁrst countable, initially ℵ1-compact T2- 354. ?
space which is not compact?
A space is called initially ℵ1-compact provided every open cover of cardinal-
ity ≤ℵ1 has a ﬁnite subcover. This question was raised by Dow, who showed
that the answer is in the negative under CH and several other conditions
(Dow [1985]). Fremlin showed the answer is in the negative under PFA (see
Balogh, Dow, Fremlin and Nyikos [1988]).
Problem 2.16. (Comfort [1988]) Consider ω1ω as a product of ℵ1 count- 355. ?
able, discrete spaces with the product topology. What is the smallest number
of compact sets needed to cover ω1ω? In particular, (∗) can ω1ω be covered
by fewer than 2ℵ1 compact sets?
This is equivalent to asking if there exists a dominating (= coﬁnal) family
F ⊂ω1ω with |F| < 2ℵ1 with respect to the product order: f ≤g iﬀf(α) ≤
g(α) for all α ∈ω1 (Tall [1989]). It is the same question if we work with
respect to the mod countable order (Comfort [1977]), and therefore it is
known that the problem involves large cardinals: Jech and Prikry [1984]
have proved that if c is real-valued measurable, then the answer to (∗) is
“no”, and if the answer is “yes”, and 2ℵ1 has a certain property, then there
are models with large cardinals.
3. Questions raised by van Douwen in his Handbook article
In his article van Douwen [1984], van Douwen raised ten questions related
to small cardinals. For the convenience of the reader we will state all of them
here, and use his enumeration of these problems. The ones that have been
solved so far are van Douwen [1984, 6.6, 6.10, part of 6.11, 8.11, and 8.14].
Problem 6.6.
Is there a compact space of cardinality 2t which is not
sequentially compact?
Solution: Alan Dow has answered the above question in the positive by
noting that if X is compact Hausdorﬀand not sequentially compact, then
n ≤|X|, and by constructing a model (a variation on model V in Balcar,
Pelant and Simon [1980]) where 2t < n.

[ch. 11
Van Douwen’s question can be revived by asking: how can the cardinal,
which is deﬁned as the smallest cardinality of a compact, non-sequentially
compact space, be expressed as a set-theoretically deﬁned cardinal?
Problem 6.7.
For compact X, in ZFC does “every countable compact
? 356.
subspace of X is closed” imply “X is a sequential space”?
It is known that the answer is “yes” if c < 2t (van Douwen [1984, 6.4]).
Let
µ = min{κ : some product of κ sequentially compact spaces is
not sequentially compact}.
Problem 6.10.
Can the cardinal µ be expressed as a set-theoretically
deﬁned cardinal?
Solution:
µ = h (Nyikos, Pelant and Simon [19∞] and Friˇc and
Vojt´aˇs [1985] independently).
Problem 6.11.
(Restatement) Is every product of sequentially compact
? 357.
spaces countably compact (i.e., is {κ : some product of κ sequentially compact
spaces is not countably compact} non-empty)?
This is the Scarborough-Stone problem 2.2. If this set is non-empty, then
let
µ1 = min{κ : some product of κ sequentially compact spaces is
not countably compact}.
Can the cardinal µ1 be expressed as a set-theoretically deﬁned cardinal? It
is known that µ1 ≥n (Nyikos, Pelant and Simon [19∞] and Friˇc and
Vojt´aˇs [1985]).
Partial solution to the Scarborough-Stone problem: Nyikos [1988] has
shown that in ZFC there exists a family of Hausdorﬀ(non-regular) sequen-
tially compact spaces whose product is not countably compact.
This an-
swers the ﬁrst part of the above question. For regular (or T3 1
2 -spaces) all of
van Douwen [1984, 6.11] is still open in ZFC. Some consistency results are
discussed in 2.2.
Problem 8.11. If X is a separable metric space and (a) X is analytic or
(b) absolutely Borel, then is cf(K(X)) = k(X) = d?
Solution: By van Douwen [1984, 8.10] this question is clearly intended
for X that are not σ-compact, and for them, d ≤k(X) ≤cf(K(X)). Thus, the

§3]
Questions raised by van Douwen in his Handbook article
211
question reduces to: is cf(K(X)) ≤d? Here, cf(K(X)) denotes the smallest
cardinality of a family L of compact subsets of X such that for every compact
set K ⊂X, there exists L ∈L with K ⊂L. A space is called analytic if it is
the continuous image of the space of irrational numbers, and absolutely Borel
if it is a Borel set in any of its metrizable compactiﬁcations. The answer to
(b) is in the aﬃrmative, but the answer to (a) is independent of the axioms
of ZFC.
Concerning (a): Becker [19∞] has constructed a model in which there is
an analytic space X ⊂2ω with cf(K(X)) > d. On the other hand, under CH,
cf(K(X)) = d = ω1.
Concerning (b): van Engelen [19∞] proved that if X is co-analytic (abso-
lutely Borel sets are both analytic and co-analytic), then cf(K(X)) ≤d. The
same follows from Fremlin’s theory of Tukey’s ordering (Fremlin [19∞a, 4,
15, 16]). Also see Fremlin [19∞b].
Problem 8.14. Let S be a subset of a separable metric space X and assume
that S is absolutely Borel. Is it true that if S ∩clX(X −S) is noncompact,
then χ(S, X) = d?
Solution: Van Engelen and Becker have observed (independently) that the
answer is “yes”. It follows from van Engelen’s result “cf(K(X)) ≤d” and the
method of proof of van Douwen [1984, 8.10(c), 8.13(c)].
Problem 8.17. Is there a (preferably metrizable) not locally compact space X 358. ?
with ExpR(X) < Expω < ∞?
Here ∞is deﬁned to be larger than any cardinal, and
ExpR(X) = min{κ : X embeds as a closed subspace in κR}, and
Expω(X) = min{κ : X embeds as a closed subspace in κω}.
Let
ap = min{ |X| : X is ﬁrst countable and pseudocompact but not
countably compact}.
It is trivial that b ≤ap ≤a.
Problem 12.5. What is ap?
359. ?
Problem 12.6. Is there in ZFC a ﬁrst countable (preferably separable and 360. ?
locally compact) pseudocompact space that is not countably compact and
that has no uncountable closed discrete subset?
Problem 13.4. Is the following true in ZFC: Each ﬁrst countable space of 361. ?

212
Vaughan / Small Cardinals
[ch. 11
cardinality at most c is a quasi-perfect image of some locally compact space.
It is true under “b = c” (van Douwen [1984, 13.4]). Is the condition “of
cardinality at most c” essential?

A.1. Theorem. ZFC ⊢d ≤i.
A.2. Notation. Let A ⊆[ω]ω and Fn(A) = { f : f ﬁnite, dom(f) ⊆A,
rng(f) ⊆{0, 1} }. For the following f, g and h will always range over Fn(A).
For f ∈Fn(A), let
Xf =

a∈dom(f)
af(a),
where a1 = a, a0 = ω −a.
From now on let A be independent i.e., Xf is inﬁnite for all f.
Let I = IA = { A ⊆ω : ∀f∃g ⊇f
(Xg ∩A is ﬁnite) }.
Clearly, I is an ideal containing all ﬁnite sets and Xf /∈IA for all f.
A.3. Lemma (Assuming |A| < d). Let E ∈IA and assume that f ∈Fn(A)
and A0, A1, . . . , An, . . . ∈A (n ∈ω) are such that dom(f) ⊆A′ =def A −
{A0, . . .}, then there is a set E′ such that:
(α) E′ ∈IA.
(β) E′ ∩E = ∅
(γ) ∀g ∈Fn(A′): If g ⊇f then Xg ∩E′ is inﬁnite.
Proof. For any H: ω →ω let
E′
H =

n

(An −

i<n
Ai) ∩H(n)
	
−E.
Then clearly E′
H ∈IA and E′
H ∩E = ∅, so any E′
H satisﬁes (α) and (β). We
have to ﬁnd a suitable H such that (γ) is satisﬁed.
Note that if g ⊇f and dom(g) ⊂A′ then Xg ∩(An −
i<n Ai)−E /∈IA, so
in particular it is inﬁnite. (Since (An −
i<n Ai) is of the form Xh for some
h with dom(h) ∩dom(g) = ∅, it is not in IA.)
For each g ∈Fn(A′) extending f, let
Hg(n) = min(Xg ∩(An −

i<n
Ai) −E).

218
Vaughan / Small Cardinals
[ch. 11
Clearly Hg is a 1-to-1 function, and if Hg(n) < H(n), then Hg(n) ∈Xg ∩E′
H.
Hence if for inﬁnitely many n,
Hg(n) < H(n)
then
Xg ∩E′
H is inﬁnite.
Since |A| < d, we can ﬁnd H such that for all g ∈Fn(A) with g ⊇f there
are inﬁnitely many n for which Hg(n) < H(n).
Then E′ = E′
H satisﬁes the requirements of the lemma.
Proof of the Theorem: Assume A is an independent family of size < d.
We will show that A is not maximal.
Let N ≺⟨H(λ), ∈⟩for suﬃciently large λ with N countable and A ∈N.
Let {fn : n ∈ω} list Fn(A)∩N, such that each element of Fn(A)∩N appears
with even and with odd index. By induction choose En ∈N such that:
(A) En ∈IA
(B) En ∩(
l<n El) = ∅
(C) If fn ⊆g ∈Fn(A) and dom(g)∩N = dom(fn) then Xg ∩En is inﬁnite
We can do this by the previous lemma, letting E = 
l<n El, f = fn
and {A0, A1, . . .} ∈N be some family disjoint from dom(fn). (we can have
En ∈N by elementarity of N).
Now let Y = 
n E2n. Then A ∪{Y } is independent: Let g ∈Fn(A). Find
n such that f2n = g ∩N. Then Xg ∩Y contains Xg ∩E2n which is inﬁnite.
If g ∩N = f2k+1 for some k then Xg ∩(ω −Y ) contains Xg ∩E2k+1 which is
also inﬁnite. This ﬁnishes the proof of the theorem.
A.4. Remark. d < i is consistent: e.g., take a model of CH and add ℵ2
many random reals with countable support.
Then the old reals still form
a dominating family. But an independent family of size ω1 must be in an
intermediate model, so it cannot be maximal, since the next random real will
be independent from it. We can understand this argument more generally: if
the set of reals is not the union of fewer than λ sets of measure zero, then any
independent family of subsets of ω has cardinality at least λ. So if P is the
forcing of the measure algebra of dimension λ > ℵ0 then in V P one has i ≥λ,
whereas d is not changed by forcing with P.

In his landmark paper “Mappings and Spaces” [1966] A. V. Arkhangel′-
ski˘ı introduced the class MOBI (Metric Open Bicompact Images) as the in-
tersection of all classes of topological spaces satisfying
(i) Every metric space belongs to the class, and
(ii) the image of any space in the class under an open-compact map is also
in the class.
Recall that an open compact map is a continuous function such that the
images of open sets are open and the inverse image of points are compact.
In Bennett [1971] an equivalent deﬁnition of the class MOBI was obtained,
namely,
1. Definition. A space Y is in MOBI if there is a metric space M, a ﬁnite se-
quence (f1, . . . , fk) of open-compact maps and a ﬁnite sequence (X1, . . . , Xk)
of spaces such that
M
f1
−→X1
f2
−→· · ·
fk−1
−→Xk−1
fk
−→Xk = Y.
The space Y is said to be in the k-th generation of MOBI.
Note that in deﬁning the class MOBI no separation axioms are asserted. In
this paper only spaces that are at least T1 will be considered. Since bicompact
was used in Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1966] to denote compact and Hausdorﬀ, we will
assume that compactness implies T2.
In 1961 S. Hanai characterized the ﬁrst generation of MOBI.
2. Theorem (Hanai [1961]).
A space X is an open-compact image of a
metric space if and only if X is a metacompact developable space.
Thus a space Y is in the second generation of MOBI if and only if Y is the
open-compact image of a metacompact developable space.
In [1966, 5.7] Arkhangel′ski˘ı observed that all spaces in MOBI have a
point-countable base and asked many questions concerning this class. Most
of these questions were answered negatively by the following examples:
3. Example (Wicke and Worrell [1967, Example 3] (see Bennett and
Berney [1971])). There exists a Hausdorﬀnon-regular space Y in MOBI
that is not developable. Moreover, Y is not (countably) metacompact.
4. Example (Bennett [1971] (see Wicke and Worrell [1967, Exam-
ple 2])). There exists a regular space Y in MOBI that is Lindel¨of and hered-
itarily paracompact. The space Y is not developable (in fact, neither perfect
nor a p-space). Moreover, Y can be modiﬁed to a linearly ordered topological
space (see Bennett and Berney [1971, 3.3]).
The pathological spaces in MOBI described in the above examples are in
the second generation. The space Y in Example 3 is an open-compact image
of a regular metacompact developable space, while in the second example a

[ch. 12
Hausdorﬀnon-regular space was used in the ﬁrst generation. The following
theorem shows that this space cannot be regular.
5. Theorem (Wicke and Worrell [1967]). Let f be an open-compact map
from a regular space X onto a space Y . If X has a base of countable order
then so does Y .
Since metacompact developable (developable) spaces are precisely meta-
compact (submetacompact) spaces with bases of countable order (Wicke and
Worrell [1965]), Theorem 5 implies that if a space Y in the second genera-
tion of MOBI is not developable, then either it is not (sub)metacompact (as
in Example 3), or it is an image of a non-regular space in the ﬁrst generation
(as in Example 4).
In view of the above, it is natural to consider subclasses MOBIi (i =
1, 2, 3, 4) of the class MOBI obtained by adding to Deﬁnition 1 the assumption
that all the terms of the sequence (X1, . . . , Xk) are Ti-spaces.
In Chaber [1976], several examples of spaces in MOBI3 were constructed.
In particular, the following improvement of Example 3 was given:
6. Example (Chaber [1976]). There exists a regular space in MOBI3 that
is not developable (in fact, neither perfect nor a p-space), hence not submeta-
compact.
Finally, examples of spaces without a very weak covering property (weak
submetacompactness) were constructed, ﬁrst in MOBI2 (Chaber [1988a])
and, later, in MOBI3 (Bennett and Chaber [19∞d]). In general, it seems
to be helpful to look at the solution of a problem for MOBI2 while solving the
corresponding problem on MOBI3. In Chaber [1988a, 1988b] an example of
a space in MOBI2 without a very weak separation property was constructed.
It is not known whether such an example can be found in MOBI3.
Again, all these pathological spaces were found in the second generation of
MOBI. This suggests
Problem 1. Is each space in MOBIi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) in the second generation?
? 362.
Does there exist a k such that each space in MOBIi is in the k-th generation?
The ﬁrst part of Problem 1 was asked by Eric van Douwen, the second is
equivalent to the following:

productive?
Another question concerning the general properties of the classes MOBIi
(the last unsolved problem from Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1966] for i < 4) is

ch. 12]
Bennett and Chaber / The Class MOBI
225
Problem 3. (Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1966]) Are the classes MOBIi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) 364. ?
invariant under perfect maps?
The general problem for MOBI is
Problem 4. Find characterizations of the classes MOBIi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4).
365. ?
In Chaber [1988b] a class of spaces related to MOBI1 was characterized
(since this class can be described by Deﬁnition 1 if compactness is not assumed
to imply T2, the appropriate name for this class seems to be MOCI) as the
class of all T1-spaces with point-countable bases (all spaces in MOCI are in
the second generation and MOCI is invariant under perfect mappings).
This characterization, the earlier discussion and the fact that all spaces in
MOBI4 are perfect suggest a more speciﬁc version of Problem 4.
Problem 5.
366. ?
(1) Are all spaces with point-countable bases in MOBI1?
(2) Are all Hausdorﬀspaces with point-countable bases in MOBI2?
(3) Are all regular spaces with point-countable bases of countable order in
MOBI3?
(4) Are all perfectly normal spaces with point-countable bases of countable
order in MOBI4?
Note that the properties listed in Problem 5 are known to be satisﬁed by
all spaces in the corresponding class MOBIi. Examples 4 and 6 show that the
classes MOBIi become strictly smaller with the increase of i ≥2. We do not
know the answer to the following:
Problem 6. Are all Hausdorﬀspaces from MOBI1 in MOBI2?
367. ?
Problems 1–6 seem to be diﬃcult and closely related to Problem 4. The
lack of progress in investigating the general questions concerning MOBI led
to the study of subclasses of this class.
There are two natural methods of deﬁning natural subclasses of the classes
MOBIi. One can modify Deﬁnition 1 by putting additional restrictions either
on the initial metric space M or on the open-compact mappings f1, . . . , fk.
Let P be a topological property.
The subclass of MOBIi generated by
assuming that the metric space M in Deﬁnition 1 satisﬁes P (and the spaces
X1 . . . , Xk are Ti) will be denoted by MOBIi(P).
Clearly, all spaces in MOBIi(discrete) are discrete and all spaces in MOBIi
(locally separable) are locally separable (hence, metrizable if i ≥3). On the
other hand, almost all the examples of pathological spaces in MOBI start with
a σ-discrete metric space (Example 4 starts with a σ-locally separable metric
space).

226
Bennett and Chaber / The Class MOBI
[ch. 12
From Junnila [1978], it follows that the ﬁrst generation of MOBIi (σ-
discrete) is the class of σ-discrete metacompact developable Ti-spaces. The
examples from Chaber [1988a] and Bennet and Chaber [19∞d] show that
the second generation of MOBIi(σ-discrete) (i = 1, 2, 3) contains spaces that
are not σ-discrete (not even σ-locally separable). A property equivalent to
σ-discreteness in the class of metric spaces and invariant under open-compact
mappings is the property of having a closure-preserving closed cover by count-
able sets (Junnila [1978]). These results were used in Chaber [1988a] and
Bennett and Chaber [19∞c] to prove
7. Theorem. For a Ti-space Y , where i = 1, 2 (Chaber [1988a]) or i = 3
(Bennett and Chaber [19∞c]), the following conditions are equivalent:
(i) Y is the second generation of MOBIi(σ-discrete),
(ii) Y is in MOBIi(σ-discrete),
(iii) Y is in MOBIi and has a closure-preserving closed cover by countable
sets,
(iv) Y has a point-countable base (a point-countable base of countable
order for i = 3) and a closure-preserving closed cover by countable
sets.
Since the classes of spaces satisfying (iv) are invariant under perfect map-
pings, Theorem 7 gives partial solutions to Problems 1–6 for i ≤3.
One should emphasize that the proof of Theorem 7 for i = 3 is much more
diﬃcult than the proof for i < 3.
In fact, the proof from Bennett and
Chaber [19∞c] is the ﬁrst construction of an open-compact mapping using
the existence of the base of countable order and, therefore, giving an evidence
that the answer to Problem 5(3) could be ‘yes’.
In spite of the apparent
similarity, the gap between i = 2 and i = 3 was so big that the authors
needed an intermediate step (the inductive construction from Bennett and
Chaber [19∞b] giving a characterization of MOBI3(scattered)= MOBIi(σ-
discrete and complete)) in order to ﬁll it. Thus, it is not surprising that i = 4
is not considered in Theorem 7. We shall discuss the MOBI4 later.
A natural way to generalize Theorem 7 is to replace σ-discreteness with
σ-local separability. A property equivalent to σ-local separability in the class
of metric spaces and invariant under open-compact mappings is the property
of having a closure-preserving closed cover by separable sets.
We do not know whether Theorem 7 holds if σ-locally separable replaces σ-
discrete and separable sets replace countable in the closure-preserving closed
cover. The most interesting part of this question is
Problem 7. Is MOBI3(σ-locally separable) equal to its second (k-th) gener-
? 368.
ation?
Since the property of having a closure-preserving closed cover by separa-
ble sets is preserved, in both directions, by open-compact mappings between

ch. 12]
Bennett and Chaber / The Class MOBI
227
spaces with point-countable bases, the negative solution of Problem 7 would
imply the negative solution of Problem 1 (for i < 3 one should investigate the
number of generations needed to get MOBIi(separable)).
The class MOBI4 is axiom sensitive since the ﬁrst generation space is a
normal metacompact Moore space.
Thus, if all normal Moore spaces are
metrizable, then MOBI4 is just the class of all metric spaces. However, we do
not know what MOBI4 is in the models in which there are normal nonmetriz-
able Moore spaces. In fact, we do not know the answer to the following:
Problem 8. Is each space in MOBI4 metacompact?
369. ?
Problem 9. Is metacompactness preserved by open-compact mappings be- 370. ?
tween (perfectly) normal spaces?
What are the covering properties of an
open-compact image of a (perfectly) normal metacompact space?
If it could be shown that the open-compact image of a perfectly normal
metacompact space was weakly submetacompact then the image space would
be submetacompact. This would imply that any space in the second gener-
ation of MOBI4 would be developable. It is known that the open compact
image of a perfectly normal boundedly metacompact space is submetacompact
(Bennett and Chaber [19∞a]).
Almost all the results concerning MOBI3 were obtained by restricting the
area of investigation to the class MOBI3(scattered) (see Chaber [1976] and
Bennett and Chaber [19∞d, 19∞b, 19∞c]). The ﬁrst examples of non-
metacompact spaces in MOBI3 have been found in the class MOBI3(scattered
of height 2) (see Example 6 and Chaber [1976]). On the other hand, in Ben-
nett and Chaber [19∞b] it was shown that an open-compact image of a
normal metacompact space is metacompact if the domain is a scattered space
of height 2. Hence, all spaces in MOBI4(scattered of height 2) are metacom-
pact and the ﬁrst generation gives all of MOBI4(scattered of height 2). The
reasoning from Bennett and Chaber [19∞b] does not rule out the existence
of open-compact mappings deﬁned on normal scattered spaces of height 3 and
not preserving metacompactness.
Problem 10. Is every space in MOBI4(scattered) metacompact? What is 371. ?
the structure of MOBI4(scattered)?
Let us turn now to the second method of generating the subclasses of the
class MOBI.
In all our examples, as well as in the examples from Kofner [1982, Exam-
ple 2] and Chaber [1988a, 4.5], the ﬁrst mapping is ﬁnite-to-one while the
inﬁnite ﬁbres of the second mapping are convergent sequences. In Theorem 7
the situation is similar but the ﬁbres of the second mapping can be arbitrary
compact scattered metric spaces (convergent sequences suﬃce if i = 1, 2).

228
Bennett and Chaber / The Class MOBI
[ch. 12
This suggests considering subclasses MOBIi,S (MOBIi,I) of MOBIi generated
by assuming that all the ﬁres of the open-compact mappings f1, . . . , fk in
Deﬁnition 1 are scattered or, equivalently, countable (have isolated points).
Clearly, MOBIi(σ-discrete) ⊆MOBIi,S ⊆MOBIi,I ⊆MOBIi.
It is known (see Chaber [1982] and Choban [1978]), that the ﬁrst gen-
eration in MOBIi,I is the class of metacompact developable Ti-spaces having
a countable cover by closed metrizable subspaces (= open ﬁnite-to-one Ti-
images of metric spaces). Thus the ﬁrst generations of MOBIi,S and MOBIi,I
are equal and strictly smaller than the ﬁrst generation of MOBIi (unless i = 4
and there is no ‘reasonable’ nonmetrizable normal Moore spaces).
Problem 11.
Is the second generation of MOBIi,S equal to the second

generation of MOBIi,I? Find characterizations of (the second generations of)
these classes.

1. Introduction
A linearly ordered topological space is a triple (X, T , <) where < is a linear
ordering of the set X and T is the usual open interval topology deﬁned by <.
A generalized ordered space, also called a suborderable space, is a topologi-
cal space which can be embedded in a linearly ordered space. Introductory
material on generalized ordered spaces can be found in Lutzer [1971, 1980].
A topological space is perfect if each of its closed subsets is a Gδ-set. It is
not true that generalized ordered spaces must be perfect: consider the famil-
iar ordinal space [0, ω1). In fact, the hypothesis that a generalized ordered
space X is perfect is quite strong: a theorem in Lutzer [1971] shows that a
perfect generalized ordered space must be paracompact.
The structure of perfect generalized ordered spaces is not well understood
and the purpose of this paper is to remind readers of a few problems in the
theory of perfect generalized ordered spaces. These problems have already
appeared in the literature, and there is substantial overlap between this article
and Bennett and Lutzer [1977] and [1984b], and Lutzer [1983], but there
has been little progress to date.
2. Perfect subspaces vs. perfect superspaces
Generalized ordered spaces are, by deﬁnition, subspaces of linearly ordered
spaces. For many topological properties P, one can prove that a generalized
ordered space with property P can be embedded in a linearly ordered space
which also has property P. Examples of properties for which this is known
to be true include separabilty, metrizability, and paracompactness. Indeed,
for the last two of these three topological properties P, a generalized ordered
space with P embeds as a closed subspace of a linearly ordered space which
also has property P. The situation in which P = “perfect” is unclear, and we
have:
Question 1. Is it true that a perfect generalized ordered space can be em- 373. ?
bedded in a perfect linearly ordered space?
To put Question 1 in context, it may be worth mentioning that there is no
hope that a perfect generalized ordered space can be embedded as a closed
subset in a perfect linearly ordered space: the familiar Sorgenfrey line S
provides the required example, see Lutzer [1971].
However, S does not
provide the example necessary to answer Question 1 negatively, since S is a
dense subspace of the perfect linearly ordered space T = [0, 1] × {0, 1} with
the lexicographic ordering.

3. Perfect ordered spaces and σ-discrete dense sets
If a space X has a dense subset D which can be written as a countable union
of closed, discrete subsets, then D is said to be a σ-discrete dense subset of
X. In generalized ordered spaces one can prove:
3.1. Proposition. If a generalized ordered space X has a σ-discrete dense
subset, then X is perfect.
Proof. Let D = {D(n) : n ≥1} be a σ-discrete dense subset of X. It is
easy to see that every singleton subset of X is a Gδ-subset of X and hence that
every order-convex subset of X is a Fσ-subset of X. Now consider any open set
G and write G = {G(i) : i ∈I} where the sets G(i) are the maximal order-
convex subsets of G. Express each G(i) as G(i) = {F(i, m) : m ≥1} where
each F(i, m) is a closed converx subset of X. Let H(m, n) = {F(i, m) : i ∈I
and F(i, m) ∩D(n) ̸= ∅}. Each H(m, n) is closed in X and G = {H(m, n) :
m, n ≥1} so that G is an Fσ-subset of X.
The converse of 3.1 is not provable in ZFC as the following consistency
result shows. Recall that a Suslin line is a non-separable linearly ordered
topological space in which each collection of pairwise disjoint open sets is
countable. It is known that the existence of a Suslin line is consistent with,
and independent of, the usual axioms of ZFC.
3.2. Proposition. If there is a Suslin line S, then S is perfect but has no
σ-discrete dense subset.
Given that the converse of 3.1 is not provable in ZFC, it is reasonable to
ask whether it is false in ZFC, and that is the second question about perfect
ordered spaces. It was originally posed by M. Maurice and J. van Wouwe.
Question 2. Assuming only ZFC, is there an example of a perfect ordered
? 374.
space which does not have a σ-discrete dense subset?
The question posed by Maurice and van Wouwe is closely related to an
older problem posed by R. W. Heath.
Question 3. In ZFC, is there an example of a perfect linearly ordered space
? 375.
which has a point-countable base and yet which is not metrizable?
It is consistent with ZFC that such an example exists, as can be seen from
the following result established in Bennett [1968] and Ponomarev [1967].
3.3. Proposition. If there is a Suslin line, then there is a Suslin line having
a point-countable base.
The relation between Questions 2 and 3 may be seen from a result estab-
lished in Bennett and Lutzer [1984a]:

§4]
How to recognize perfect generalized ordered spaces
235
3.4. Proposition. Let X be a generalized ordered space having a σ-discrete
dense set and a point-countable base. Then X is metrizable.
Therefore, any space which answers Question 3 will also answer Question 2.
4. How to recognize perfect generalized ordered spaces
To prove that an arbitrary topological space is perfect, it is not necessary to
examine every closed set. It is easy to see that it will be enough to show that
every nowhere dense closed set is a Gδ-set, i.e., it is enough to consider the
small closed sets. In generalized ordered spaces, another approach is possible:
it turns out to be enough to consider only the large closed sets.
To say
that F is a regular closed set means that F = cl(int(F)). In Bennett and
Lutzer [1983] the following result is proved:
4.1. Proposition. A generalized ordered space X is perfectly normal if and
only if each regularly closed subset of X is a Gδ-set.
5. A metrization problem for compact ordered spaces
The solution of at least one problem in generalized ordered space theory will
hinge on being able to recognize whether a certain type of generalized ordered
space must be perfect. Recall that a collection C of subsets of X is minimal if
 D ̸=  C whenever D is a proper subcollection of C. A collection which can
be expressed as the union of countably many minimal collections is said to be
σ-minimal. The study of spaces which have σ-minimal bases was initiated in
Aull [1974]. In answer to one of the questions in Aull [1974], Bennett and
Berney [1977] proved that the lexicographic square L (i.e., the space [0, 1] ×
[0, 1] with the lexicographic ordering and the usual open interval topology)
is a compact, ﬁrst countable linearly ordered topological space which has a
σ-minimal base.
A key point about the structure of L—and this will be
important later—is that L has two parts. The ﬁrst is the open metrizable
subspace [0, 1]×]0, 1[ and the second is the pathological subspace [0, 1]×{0, 1}
which cannot have a σ-minimal base for its topology.
Examination of L and other examples suggests that the existence of patho-
logical subspaces may be the key to understanding generalized ordered spaces
which have σ-minimal bases. This leads to the following question ﬁrst posed
in Bennett and Lutzer [1977].
Question 4.
Suppose that X is a compact linearly ordered topological space 376. ?
and that every subspace of X has a σ-minimal base for its relative topology.
Must X be metrizable?
It is known that a space X as described in Question 4 must be ﬁrst count-
able, hereditarily paracompact, and such that for every subspace Y of X,

236
Bennett and Lutzer / Perfect Ordered Spaces
[ch. 13
there is a dense subspace M of Y which is metrizable. Further, there is a kind
of structure theorem for such spaces which has proved useful in the study of
other hereditary properties and metrizability in oredered spaces. The theo-
rem suggests that, like the lexicographic square L, such spaces have two, quite
diﬀerent, parts.
5.1. Proposition. Suppose that X is a ﬁrst countable paracompact gener-
alized ordered space. Then there are subspaces G and H of X satisfying:
(a) G is open and metrizable;
(b) H = X −G;
(c) H is dense in itself and can be written as H = D ∪E where D ∩E = ∅
and where [d1, d2] ∩D is not compact whenever d1 < d2 are points of
D (respectively [e1, e2]∩E is not compact whenever e1 < e2 are points
of E).

Introduction
It is the purpose of this article to show how the problem arose, to place it in
the context of the most natural of structuring mechanisms, to indicate some
powerful metrisation theorems which are available on the addition of a single
condition, and to review some recent work which gives some partial answers
and suggests lines of enquiry which should be further pursued. Despite the
attention shown to the problem over the last ﬁve years, we would not wish to
claim that the results presented here go more than a small distance towards a
solution. We believe that some new ideas are required and would encourage
our colleagues to provide them.
Since the review paper Collins [19∞] was given at the Baku Topology
Symposium in 1987, new insights have encouraged us to vary the presentation
and to include hitherto unpublished material.
All spaces will have the T1 separation axiom and N will denote the set of
natural numbers.
1. Origins
The structuring mechanism which spawned the problem arose in the search
for a simple, yet natural, condition which would produce a countable basis in
a separable space. The model was, naturally enough, a standard elementary
proof for a metric space with countable dense subset A.
If, in this context, x belongs to open U and a is an element of A ∩Sϵ(x),
where the open ball S3ϵ(x) ⊆U, then x ∈Sr(y) ⊆U for any y ∈Sϵ(x) and
any rational r such that ϵ < r < 2ϵ. The picture is given in Figure 1.

An essential feature of the above proof, which must be borne clearly in
mind in constructing generalisations, is the need, not only for Sr(y) to be
small enough to be within U, but also large enough to ‘pick up’ x. We shall
return to this point later.
The ﬁrst generalisation to be investigated (Collins and Roscoe [1984]),
which allows an immediate parody of the above proof, runs as follows. For
each x in a space X, let
W(x) = {W(n, x) : n ∈N}
be a countable family of subsets of X, each containing x. W = {W(x) : x ∈
X} is said to satisfy (A)1 if it satisﬁes
(A)
if x ∈U and U is open, then there exist a positive integer
s = s(x, U) and an open set V = V (x, U) containing x such
that x ∈W(s, y) ⊆U whenever y ∈V .
The picture is the same as Figure 1, once one sets V = Sϵ(x) and W(s, y) =
Sr(y). Second countability follows from separability when each W(n, x) is
open, or indeed is a neighbourhood of x (W satisﬁes ‘open (A)’, or ‘neigh-
bourhood (A)’). In fact, one can go further if W satisﬁes ‘neighbourhood de-
creasing (A)’, that is, if W(n + 1, x) ⊆W(n, x) holds for each x and n in
addition to the W(n, x) being neighbourhoods of x.
1. Theorem (Collins and Roscoe [1984]). In order that X be metris-
able it is necessary and suﬃcient that X has W satisfying neighbourhood
decreasing (A).
In Collins and Roscoe [1984], it is shown that eventually decreasing
neighbourhood (A) will not suﬃce for metrisability. Theorem 1 is proved in one
page, relying on no other results, and a number of classical metrisation the-
orems, such as those of Nagata-Smirnov and of Moore-Arkhangel′ski˘ı-Stone,
are quickly deduced.
We should like to stress how natural condition (A) is by restating Theorem 1
to provide a set-theoretic model for metric spaces.
2. Theorem (Collins and Roscoe [1984]). Suppose that for each x in a
set X there is a decreasing sequence W(x) = {W(n, x) : n ∈N} of subsets
of X, each containing x, such that
(1) given x and y, x ̸= y, there exists a positive integer m with y ̸∈W(m, x),
(2) given x in X and a positive integer n, there exist positive integers
r = r(n, x) and s = s(n, x) such that y ∈W(r, x) implies that x ∈
W(s, y) ⊆W(n, x).
1The names (A), (F) and (G) used for conditions in this paper are taken from Collins
and Roscoe [1984].

§1]
Origins
241
Then there is a metric for X such that, for each x in X, W(x) is a basis for
the neighbourhood system of x in the metric topology.
Condition (2) is just (A) re-stated in terms of the W(n, x)’s and obviously
strengthens the usual neighbourhood axioms for a topological space. Condi-
tion (1) ensures appropriate separation.
In the proof of second countability of a separable metric space given in
the last section, the same r suﬃced for each y in Sϵ(x). This is reﬂected in
condition (A) where s = s(x, U) does not depend on y ∈V . It is natural to ask
what happens if s also depends on y. We say (Collins and Roscoe [1984])
that W satisﬁes (G) if it satisﬁes
(G)
if x
∈
U
and U
is open,
then there exists an open
V = V (x, U) containing x such that x ∈W(s, y) ⊆U for some
s = s(x, y, U) ∈N whenever y ∈V .
The picture is much the same as before (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Condition (G)
Again, with analogous deﬁnitions, if W satisﬁes open (G), then separability
implies second countability (Lemma 3 of Collins and Roscoe [1984]). How
ﬁnely conditions (A) and (G) are balanced on the point of what is possible in
metrisation theory may be judged from the following results.
3. Theorem (Collins and Roscoe [1984]). There is a space X (the ‘bow-
tie’ space of L. F. McAuley [1955]) which has W satisfying neighbourhood
decreasing (G) but which is not metrisable.
4. Theorem (Collins, Reed, Roscoe and Rudin [1985]). In order that
X be metrisable it is necessary and suﬃcient that X has W satisfying open
decreasing (G).

Collins, Reed and Roscoe / Point-Countable Bases
[ch. 14
It should be noted that Theorems 1 and 4 are not inter-dependent.
The value of considering generalisations of open decreasing (G) is exempli-
ﬁed by the next result.
5. Theorem (Balogh [1985], Collins, Reed, Roscoe and Rudin [1985]).
A space is stratiﬁable(and hence a Nagata space if ﬁrst countable) if and only if
it has W satisfying decreasing (G) and has countable pseudocharacter.
Comparison of Theorems 4 and 5 prompts the following open question.
Problem 1. (Collins and Roscoe [1984]) Which spaces are characterised
? 377.
as having W satisfying neighbourhood decreasing (G)?
It is known (see Collins, Reed, Roscoe and Rudin [1985]) that there
are stratiﬁable (indeed, Nagata) spaces which do not have neighbourhood
decreasing (G).
It is another generalisation of open decreasing (G) which provides the title
of this article and the next section.
2. The point-countable base problem
Whilst investigating the structuring mechanism described in the last section,
the authors made a number of conjectures, many of which have now been
answered by theorems or counterexamples. Of those that remain, the point-
countable base problem is the most intriguing, both because of the number
of partial solutions that have been discovered and because of the eﬀort that
has been expended on it.
A basis for a space X is point-countable if every element of X is contained
in at most a countable number of elements of the basis. It may quickly be
deduced that, if X has such a basis B, then X has W satisfying open (G) (by
deﬁning W(x) = {B ∈B : x ∈B}). The converse remains an open question.
Problem 2. (The Point-Countable Base Problem (Collins, Reed, Roscoe
? 378.
and Rudin [1985])) If X has W satisfying open (G), need X have a point-
countable basis?
Note that it is not possible usefully to reduce ‘open non-decreasing W(x)’
to ‘open decreasing V(x)’ (which one might hope to do, so as to apply results
of the last section) by the formula
V (n, x) =
n

i=1
W(i, x)
since, even if W satisﬁes (G), V may not, as the V (s, x) may not ‘pick up’ x.
(See our comment in Section 2.)

§2]
The point-countable base problem
243
That a space be meta-Lindel¨of (a condition clearly implied by the existence
of a point-countable basis) does not require open (G), as the following result
shows. This result is not only useful, but exempliﬁes a common style of proof
found when (G) and related conditions are used.
6. Lemma (Moody, Reed, Roscoe and Collins [19∞]). If the space X
has W satisfying (G), then X is hereditarily meta-Lindel¨of (i.e., each open
cover has a point-countable open reﬁnement).
Proof. Suppose G = {Uα : α ∈γ} is an open cover of X, enumerated using
some ordinal γ. For each α ∈γ, deﬁne the set
Sα =

{V (x, Uα) : x ∈Uα \

β∈α
Uβ}
where V (x, U) is given by (G). By construction, S = {Sα : α ∈γ} is an open
cover of X. We claim that S is point-countable. If y belongs to Sα, then there
is xα ∈Uα\
κ∈α Uκ such that y ∈V (xα, Uα), and hence there is Wα ∈W(y)
such that
xα ∈Wα ⊆Uα.
There can only be countably many such α, for otherwise there would be two
ordinals α, β (with α ∈β, say) such that Wα = Wβ. But then xβ ∈Wβ ⊆Uα,
giving a contradiction. So, S is point-countable as claimed.
The fact that X is hereditarily meta-Lindel¨of follows simply from the ob-
servation that any subspace Y trivially has W′ satisfying (G).
A large number of partial answers have been found to the point-countable
base problem. Many of them turn out to be consequences of a simple Lemma
(which was actually discovered after many of its consequences). To state it,
we need the concept of a pointed open cover. A pointed open cover for a space
X with topology T is a subset P of X ×T such that {U : ∃x ∈X (x, U) ∈P}
is a cover for X. P is said to be point-countable if {(x, U) ∈P : y ∈U} is
countable for all y, and dense if
y ∈{x : (x, U) ∈P ∧y ∈U}
for all y. Note that we have not insisted that (x, U) ∈P implies x ∈U.2
7. Lemma (Moody, Reed, Roscoe and Collins [19∞]). If the space X
has W satisfying open (G), then X has a point-countable base if and only if
X has a dense, point-countable, pointed open cover.
2Indeed, it is often more natural to generate these pointed open covers in such a way
that x ̸∈U for some (x, U). However it is easy to show that if a space has W satisfying
open (G) and a dense, point-countable pointed open cover P, then there is another one,
P′, where all (x, U) have x ∈U.

244
Collins, Reed and Roscoe / Point-Countable Bases
[ch. 14
Proof. First suppose that X has a point-countable base B. For each non-
empty element U of B, pick an xU ∈U, and deﬁne P = {(xU, U) : U ∈
B \ {∅}}. It can be easily veriﬁed that P is a dense, point-countable, pointed
open cover. Conversely, deﬁne
B = {U ∩W : ∃x (x, U) ∈P ∧W ∈W(x)}.
Clearly, B is a point-countable collection of open sets. To see that B is a base,
consider any x ∈X and any open set O containing x. Since P is dense, there
must exist a (y, U) ∈P such that x ∈U and y ∈V (x, O). Pick a W ∈W(y)
for which x ∈W ⊆O. Then x ∈U ∩W ⊆O and U ∩W ∈B, so that B is a
base as required.
Notice how this proof follows the one that a separable space with W satisfy-
ing open (G) is second-countable. In fact, possessing a dense, point-countable
pointed open cover is a natural generalisation of separability: there are count-
ably many points available to have each point as a limit, only now, which
points are available varies from place to place. (Each point is available in an
open set.) Every separable space X with countable dense subset D has such
a pointed open cover {(x, X) : x ∈D}.
Given these two lemmas, it is possible to establish a number of results rather
easily. We now give sketch proofs of the three such theorems, in each case
showing how the dense, point-countable, pointed open covers are constructed.
8. Theorem (Moody, Reed, Roscoe and Collins [19∞]). If the space X
has W satisfying open (G) and has density ≤ℵ1, then it has a point-countable
basis.
Proof. If X is separable then we already know it is second countable, so we
may assume it has a dense subset D = {xα : α ∈ω1}. It is then easy to show
that the pointed open cover
P = {(xα, X \ {xβ : β ∈α}) : α ∈ω1} .
is point-countable and dense.
Considerable work has been done to show that, under the assumption that
large cardinals exist, if certain topological properties are true of all subsets
with cardinal ≤ℵ1 of a given space, then they are true of the space (see
F. D. Tall’s questions on reﬂection, this volume). In this vein, it has been
conjectured that, if every ≤ℵ1 subset of a ﬁrst countable regular space X
has a point-countable base, then X has a point-countable base. If this could
be proved, then, of course, Theorem 8 would answer the point-countable base
problem in the aﬃrmative for regular spaces, on the assumption of large
cardinals.

§2]
The point-countable base problem
245
9. Theorem (Moody, Reed, Roscoe and Collins [19∞]). If X is semi-
stratiﬁable and has W satisfying open (G), then it has a point-countable
basis.
Proof. We shall use the characterisation of semi-stratiﬁable given by G. D.
Creede in [1970], which states that a space X with topology T is semi-
stratiﬁable if and only if there exists a function g from N × X to T such
that
(i) {x} = {g(n, x) : n ∈N}, and
(ii) if y ∈X and (xn) is a sequence of points in X such that y ∈g(n, xn)
for all n, then (xn) converges to y.
Let g be such a function. By Lemma 6 we may let Un be a point-countable
open reﬁnement of {g(n, x) : x ∈X}. For each U ∈Un, choose xU such that
U ⊆g(n, xU). Deﬁne P =

(xU, U) : U ∈Un ∧n ∈N}. By construction, P
is a point-countable, pointed open cover. It also follows easily from (ii) above
that P is dense.
10. Theorem (Moody, Reed, Roscoe and Collins [19∞]). If X has W
satisfying open (G) and is the locally countable sum of spaces which have
point-countable bases (i.e., X = {Xλ : λ ∈Λ}, where each subspace Xλ has
a point-countable base and where there is a neighbourhood N(x) of each x
which meets only countably many Xλ), then X has a point-countable base.
Proof. In fact, we will show, without using the openness of W, that if each
Xλ has a dense, point-countable, pointed open cover Pλ then so does X. If
U is a set open in one of the Xλ, let U X denote some set chosen to be open
in X and such that U X ∩Xλ = U. The dense, point-countable, pointed open
cover of X is then given by
{(x,

{V (y, N(y) ∩U X) : y ∈U}) : λ ∈Λ, (x, U) ∈Pλ} .
G. Gruenhage has solved the point-countable base problem for GO-spaces.
11. Theorem (Gruenhage [19∞]).
Every GO-space with W satisfying
open (G) has a point-countable base.
And P. J. Nyikos [1986] and one of us (AWR) have established the fol-
lowing result (which does not use open (G)).
12. Theorem. If X is a ﬁrst countable, non-archimedean space which has
W satisfying (G), then X has a point-countable base.
We have demonstrated that the answer to the point-countable base problem
is ‘yes’ in a number of cases where there is extra structure for is available.
Our next result demonstrates that any counter-example must be particularly
unpleasant. It is a consequence of Lemma 6 and Theorem 10.

246
Collins, Reed and Roscoe / Point-Countable Bases
[ch. 14
13. Theorem (Moody, Reed, Roscoe and Collins [19∞]). If the space X
is a counterexample (i.e., has W satisfying open (G) but no point-countable
base) then there is a non-empty subspace X′ of X, every non-empty open
subset of which is also a counterexample.
Thus, if there is a counter-example, then it has a subspace which is a
counterexample and none of whose open sets (viewed as subspaces)
(1) have density ≤ℵ1,
(2) are semi-stratiﬁable
(3) are GO-spaces
(4) are non-archimedean
(5) or are locally countable sums of such spaces,
which excludes many common ways of constructing counter-examples.
It is worth remarking that the property of having W satisfying open (G)
shares a number of other properties with that of having a point-countable
basis. For example, both are countably productive and both are hereditary.
In [19∞] Gruenhage showed (i) that a submetacompact β-space with W
satisfying open (G) is developable (and hence has a point-countable base;
this result actually generalises Theorem 7 above), and (ii) that a countably
compact space with W satisfying open (G) is metric.
The next result gives a little more insight into the problem.
14. Theorem (Moody, Reed, Roscoe and Collins [19∞]). If X is a
space with W satisfying (G), then X has a point-countable pointed open
cover P such that
(i) (x, U) ∈P ⇒x ∈U, and
(ii) {x : (x, U) ∈P} is dense in X.
Thus, any space with W satisfying open (G) has a dense subspace with a
point-countable base (the set in (ii)).
The same techniques used in the proof of Theorem 8 demonstrate that
the point-countable base B for the dense subset D can be lifted to a point-
countable set B′ of subsets of X which are a basis for its topology at all points
in D. However, there is no obvious way of making them into a basis for the
whole of X.
The condition (G) may be strengthened to (G′) as follows:
(G′)
if x
∈
U
and U
is open,
then there exists an open
V = V (x, U) ⊆U containing x such that x ∈W(s, y) ⊆V
for some s = s(x, y, U) ∈N whenever y ∈V .
The picture here has changed in that now W(s, y) ⊆V rather than U. It is
easy to see that the W constructed earlier, for spaces with point-countable
bases, satisﬁes (G′). In fact, it is possible to prove the following result.

§3]
Postscript: a general structuring mechanism
247
15. Theorem (Moody, Reed, Roscoe and Collins [19∞]). X has W
satisfying (G′) if, and only if, it has a dense, point-countable, pointed open
cover.
Thus, if it also has W′ (not necessarily equal to W) satisfying open (G),
then it has a point-countable base. Unfortunately, the techniques used in the
proof of Theorem 15 do not seem to generalise to the weaker condition (G).
However, that result does give rise to the following problem (an aﬃrmative
answer to which would solve the point-countable base problem):
Problem 3. Does every space with W satisfying (G) have a dense, point- 379. ?
countable, pointed open cover?
Since almost all of our positive results about the point-countable base prob-
lem are consequences of Lemma 7 after constructing a dense, point-countable,
pointed open cover, there is reason to believe that this problem may be best
attacked via Problem 3. Direct analogues of all of Theorems 8–13 hold for
Problem 3. (We have shown that Gruenhage’s proof of Theorem 11 can be
adapted to show that any GO-space with W satisfying (G) has a dense, point-
countable, pointed open cover.) The single caveat is in the case of Theorem 8,
where the proof relies on ﬁrst countability (implied by open (G) but not (G)).
However any ﬁrst countable space with density ≤ℵ1 has a dense, point-
countable, pointed open cover, as does any space with cardinality ≤ℵ1.
We have already remarked that the property of having a point-countable,
pointed open cover is rather like separability. And, like separability, it is not in
general hereditary: a counterexample can be constructed by assuming c = ℵ2
and using the Sierpinski construction of a topology on the real line where a
neighbourhood of a point x consists of all points within ϵ > 0 which are not
less than x in an ω2 well-order. This space does not have such a pointed open
cover, but by adding the rational points of the plane in a suitable way the space
becomes separable. However, if Problem 3 were to have a positive answer,
then any space with W satisfying (G) would have this property hereditarily.
A simple modiﬁcation to the proof of Theorem 1 of Collins, Reed, Roscoe
and Rudin [1985] shows that the property is hereditary if the space has W
satisfying (G) (i.e., if X has such a W and a dense, point-countable pointed
open cover, then so does every subspace). This is a small piece of positive
evidence towards the conjecture.
3. Postscript: a general structuring mechanism
We have already seen that conditions (A) and (G) give a powerful structuring
mechanism for topological spaces when we impose various conditions on the
W(x). This mechanism can be further extended when we relax the condition
that each W(x) is countable. If W(x) is, for each x in a space X, a set of

248
Collins, Reed and Roscoe / Point-Countable Bases
[ch. 14
subsets of X containing x, we say W = {W(x) : x ∈X} satisﬁes (F) when it
satisﬁes
(F)
if x ∈U and U is open, then there exists an open V = V (x, U)
containing x such that x ∈W ⊆U for some W ∈W(y) when-
ever y ∈V .
The picture here is the same as in Figure 2. Every topological space clearly
has W satisfying open (F), and metrisability is given when X has W satisfy-
ing open decreasing (G), of which open (F) is a generalisation. Therefore, it
should not surprise the reader that restrictions on W satisfying (F) relate nat-
urally to certain well-known generalised metric spaces. W satisﬁes chain (F)
if each W(x) is a chain with respect to inclusion.
16. Theorem (Moody, Reed, Roscoe and Collins [19∞]).
If X has
W satisfying chain (F) and each W(x) = W1(x) ∪W2(x), where W1(x)
consists of neighbourhoods of x and W2(x) is well-ordered by ⊇, then X is
paracompact.
Not all paracompact spaces have such W.
Problem 4.
Characterise the spaces which have W satisfying chain (F),
? 380.
where the W(x) are
(i) all neighbourhoods,
(ii) well-ordered by ⊇, or
(iii) as in the statement of Theorem 14.
17. Theorem (Collins and Roscoe [1984]). If X has W satisfying chain (F),
then X is monotonically normal (in the sense of R. W. Heath, D. J. Lutzer
and P. L. Zenor [1973]]).
It is possible to characterise the spaces that have chain (F): we deﬁne a
space X to be acyclically monotonically normal if there is, for each x and
open U such that x ∈U, an open set V (x, U) such that
(i) x ∈U1 ⊆U2 ⇒V (x, U1) ⊆V (x, U2)
(ii) x ̸= y ⇒V (x, X \ {y}) ∩V (y, X \ {x}) = ∅
(iii) If n ≥2, x0, . . . xn−1 are all distinct and xn = x0, then
n−1

r=0
V (xr, X \ {xr+1}) = ∅.
Conditions (i) and (ii) are just the usual conditions for monotone normality,
and (iii) is an extension of (ii) (notice that (ii) is just condition (iii) when n =
2). The eﬀect of (iii) is to ban certain types of cycles, hence the name.
18. Theorem. A space X is acyclically monotonically normal if and only if
it has W satisfying chain (F).

However, we do not know if there are any monotonically normal spaces
which do not have chain (F). This leads to our ﬁnal problem.
Problem 5. Is every monotonically normal space acyclically monotonically 381. ?
normal?
(The deﬁnition of acyclic monotone normality, Theorem 15 and Problem 5
all ﬁrst appeared in Roscoe [1984] and were further discussed in Moody,
Reed, Roscoe and Collins [19∞].)
GO spaces and stratiﬁable spaces, the two best known classes of mono-
tonically normal spaces, are both acyclically monotonically normal (Moody,
Reed, Roscoe and Collins [19∞]), as are elastic spaces (Moody [1989]).
It is known that no counter-example can be scattered. In his thesis [1989],
P. J. Moody did a considerable amount of work on this problem and proved
that acyclic monotone normality has many of the same properties enjoyed by
monotone normality. He showed that there is a close relationship between
this problem and the problem of E. K. van Douwen [1975] of whether every
monotonically normal space is K0, since he observed that every acyclically
monotonically normal space is K0. He also showed that a counter-example
exists to van Douwen’s problem, and hence to ours, if there is what he terms
a λ-Gower space (see J. van Mill [1982]) which is monotonically normal, for
any inﬁnite cardinal λ. However, it is not known if such a space exists.

1. Introduction
This survey of open problems overlaps somewhat with a survey paper that
appeared recently in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences (Fitz-
patrick and Zhou [1989]). Again we remark how these problems range in
ﬂavor from the geometric to the set-theoretic.
If X is a topological space, then H(X) denotes the group of all autohome-
omorphisms on X. The statement that X is countable dense homogeneous
(CDH) means that
(1) X is separable, and
(2) if A and B are two countable dense sets in X, then there is an
h ∈H(X) such that h(A) = B.
The statement that X is densely homogeneous (DH) means that
(1) X has a σ-discrete dense subset, and
(2) if A and B are two σ-discrete dense subsets of X then there is
h ∈H(X) such that h(A) = B.
Here, by a σ-discrete set we mean the union of countably many sets, each
with the relative topology, being a discrete space. The statement that X is
strongly locally homogeneous (SLH) means that X has a basis of open sets U
such that if p and q are two point of U ∈U then there is an h ∈H(X) such
that h(p) = q and such that h(x) = x for every x not in U.
2. Separation Axioms
We have previously in Fitzpatrick and Zhou [1988] discussed countable
dense homogeneity and dense homogeneity in the context of T1-spaces. The
T1-hypothesis is redundant, that is, we have the following theorem:
1. Theorem (Fitzpatrick, White and Zhou [19∞]). Every topological
space that is CDH or DH is also a T1-space.
Note that if, instead of σ-discrete as deﬁned above, we mean by σ-discrete
the union of countably many sets, each with no limit points in the space, then
there exists a space that is DH but not T1, or even T0. To see this, consider
a sequence which converges to two diﬀerent points.
One might wonder whether additional separation axioms might follow in
the presence of CDH or DH. The answer is in the negative.
2. Example. That a CDH space may fail to be T2 is evinced by an uncount-
able space with the co-ﬁnite topology.
3. Example. That a CDH T2-space may fail to be T3 is evinced by the space
(R2, Γ′) discussed in Fitzpatrick and Zhou [1988].

4. Example. That a CDH, completely regular Hausdorﬀspace may fail to
be normal is evidenced by Moore’s manifold ΣB (Moore [1942]), proved in
Fitzpatrick and Zhou [1988] to be CDH.
We do not currently have examples to show that T3 does not imply T3 1
2 or
that T4 does not imply T5 or T6, in the presence of CDH.
3. The Relationship between CDH and SLH
Problem 1. Is every connected, CDH, metric space SLH?
? 382.
The connection between CDH and SLH was established by Bennett [1972]
in his ground-breaking paper on CDH spaces. Therein, he showed that if X
is locally compact, separable, metric, and SLH, then it is CDH. He did this
in order to exhibit CDH connected spaces that are not manifolds; his test
space was the Menger universal curve, shown by R. D. Anderson [1958] to
be SLH.
The condition of local compactness was relaxed to that of completeness by
Fletcher and McCoy in [1974] and by Anderson, Curtis and van Mill
in [1982]. In the nonseparable case it was proved by Fitzpatrick and Lauer
in [1987] that every completely metrisable SLH space is DH.
In [1982], van Mill showed that connected SLH Baire spaces need not be
CDH; actually, using transﬁnite induction, he established the existence of a
connected, locally connected, Baire, SLH subspace of the plane that is not
CDH, and he implicitly raised Question 1 above. Recently, W. L. Salts-
man [1989] has shown that the set of points in the plane whose coordinates
are both rational or both irrational provides an eﬀective example, with the
same properties: connected, locally connected, Baire, SLH, not CDH. We
have been told that E. K. van Douwen also knew of these properties of this
set. In the nonmetric case Stepr¯ans and Zhou [1988] have given an example
of a separable manifold (therefore SLH) which is not CDH.
As noted in Fitzpatrick and Zhou [1989], 0-dimensional spaces that are
CDH or DH must be SLH.
There are only two known examples of connected CDH spaces that are not
SLH: the example (R2, Γ′) of Fitzpatrick and Zhou [1988], and the “0-
angle” space of Watson and Simon [19∞]. The latter has the advantage of
being regular.
Recently, speculation as to a possible source for a metric counterexample
has centered on a class of spaces introduced by F. B. Jones [1942]. There,
using Hamel bases, he showed the existence of an additive, discontinuous
function f: R →R such that the graph of f, as a subspace of R2, is connected.
Let us, in this discussion, call such a subspace of R2 a Jones group, as all such
are topological groups. As R. W. Heath [1988] has observed, no Jones group
can be SLH. The question is, can one be CDH? Might they all be CDH? Well,

§4]
Open Subsets of CDH Spaces.
255
they needn’t all be CDH. Heath has shown in unpublished work that under
the assumption of the Continuum Hypothesis, there is a Jones group that is
not CDH. Saltsman [1989] has shown the same in ZFC. But whether there
is one that is CDH is a vexing question.
One might think that, in the case of continua (= compact, connected metric
spaces), we could get that CDH implies SLH. Even this is unknown. Recall
that Bennett showed in Bennett [1972], in this class, that SLH implies CDH.
G. S. Ungar [1978] showed that CDH continua must be n-homogeneous for
all n, and, therefore, 2-homogeneous, that is, homogeneous with respect to
pairs of distinct points. J. A. Kennedy [1984] showed that a 2-homogeneous
continuum X must be SLH, provided that X admits a nontrivial homeo-
morphism that is the identity on some nonempty open set. Whether every
2-homogeneous continuum must admit such an autohomeomorphism remains
an open question.
Problem 1’. Is every CDH continuum SLH?
383. ?
4. Open Subsets of CDH Spaces.
Problem 2. If X is CDH and metric and U is open in X, must U be CDH? 384. ?
The question as to when open subsets of CDH spaces inherit the CDH
property was raised by Ungar [1978].
The ﬁrst known results are
(1) components of CDH spaces are CDH and are, if nontrivial, open (Fitz-
patrick and Lauer [1987]), and
(2) components of DH spaces are DH and are, if nontrivial, open (proved
in the metric case in Fitzpatrick and Zhou [1988] and in the general
case in Saltsman [1989]).
So, some open subsets do inherit these properties. Other partial results are
as follows Fitzpatrick and Zhou [19∞].
(3) If X is locally compact, metric, and CDH, and every dense open set in
X is CDH, then so is every open subset.
(4) If X is CDH and metric, and U is a locally compact set that is both
open and closed in X, then U is CDH.
(5) If X is CDH, compact metric, and dim X ≤1, and U is open in X,
then U is CDH.
(6) If X is CDH, complete metric, and dim X = 0, and U is open in X,
then U is CDH. We note that CDH can be replaced by DH in this
result.
In the negative direction, the only known examples of CDH spaces with
open, non-CDH subspaces, are those in Fitzpatrick and Zhou [1988] and
Watson and Simon [19∞] mentioned earlier as examples where CDH does

256
Fitzpatrick and Zhou / Densely Homogeneous Spaces
[ch. 15
not imply SLH. They work as examples of both phenomena because they
have open connected subsets that are not homogeneous, and it is known that
connected CDH or SLH spaces are homogeneous, and SLH is inherited by
open subsets. This leads us to ask the following.
Problem 2’. If X is connected, CDH, and metric, and U is an open, con-
? 385.
nected set in X, must U be homogeneous? If U is homogeneous, is it neces-
sarily CDH?
Again, this is apparently unknown even for continua.
5. Local Connectedness
Problem 3. If X is a CDH, connected, complete metric space, must X be
? 386.
locally connected?
This is known to have an aﬃrmative answer in case X is also locally compact
(Fitzpatrick [1972]). But the only examples we know of CDH connected
metric spaces are also locally connected. A possible example here is Jones
group, which is, of course, far from being complete.
6. Cartesian Products
Problem 4. For which 0-dimensional subsets X of R is Xω homogeneous?
? 387.
CDH?
Problem 5. Is the ωth power of the Niemytzki plane homogeneous?
? 388.
That CDH, SLH, and 2-homogeneity are not preserved under ﬁnite prod-
ucts, even for continua, was established by K. Kuperberg, W. Kuper-
berg and W. R. R. Transue [1980]. On the other hand, it has long been
known that homogeneity of CDH can be induced in inﬁnite products. M. K.
Fort [1962] proved that the product of countably inﬁnitely many compact,
connected, metric manifolds with boundary is CDH. Recently, Z. Yang [1989]
has shown the same without the compactness hypothesis.
D. B. Moro-
tov [1985] proved that the ωth power of any ﬁrst countable, 0-dimensional,
compact Hausdorﬀspace must be homogeneous. Using Fort’s techniques, it
is not hard to see that the ωth power of the long ray is homogeneous.

7. Completeness
Problem 6.
Does there exist a CDH metric space that is not completely 389. ?
metrisable?
The answer is in the aﬃrmative, assuming either the Continuum Hypothesis
(abbreviated: CH) or Martin’s Axiom (abbreviated: MA). That CH implies
the existence of such a space was proved in Fitzpatrick and Zhou [19∞];
there we obtained a connected, locally connected, Baire, homogeneous, SLH
subset of the plane that is not completely metrisable. Baldwin and Beau-
doin [19??] have shown, assuming MA, that there is a CDH subset of the line
that is not completely metrisable. G. Gruenhage has, assuming CH, obtained
a CDH subspace of R of universal measure 0.
Problem 6’. Is there an absolute example of a CDH metric space of cardi- 390. ?
nality ω1?
8. Modiﬁcations of the Deﬁnitions.
B. Knaster called a space X bihomogeneous provided every two points in X
can be interchanged by means of an autohomeomorphism on X. Recently,
K. Kuperberg [19∞] has given an example of a homogeneous continuum
that is not bihomogeneous. Clearly, one could analogously deﬁne countable
dense bihomogeneity, dense bihomogeneity, and strong local bihomogeneity,
and investigate those properties in relation to the properties currently under
consideration.
In 1985, at the New York Independence Day Conference on Limits, on see-
ing Moore’s manifold ΣB as an example of a CDH space that is not DH, E. K.
van Douwen asked the following. Is Moore’s manifold ΣB homogeneous with
respect to σ-discrete sets that are homeomorphic to one another? If it is,
then is there an example of a CDH space that isn’t DH in this weaker sense?
Van Douwen’s question has now been answered (Fitzpatrick, White and
Zhou [19∞]). It may still be of interest to investigate this form of homo-
geneity and to determine conditions under which all σ-discrete dense sets are
homeomorphic.

1. The Problem
Throughout this paper, “space” always means “Hausdorﬀspace”. Most of
the spaces considered are compact. We use 2 to denote the 2-point space,
{0, 1}, with the (necessarily) discrete topology, and [0, 1] to denote the unit
interval with the usual topology. The cellularity of a space is the supremum
of all sizes of families of disjoint open sets in the space; thus, a space is ccc
iﬀits cellularity is ℵ0 or less. The weight of a space is the least cardinality
of a basis, and the character of a point in a space is the least cardinality of a
local base at that point.
A space, X, is called homogeneous iﬀfor any x, y ∈X, there is a homeo-
morphism, h, of X onto X, such that h(x) = y. For example, 2κ (with the
product topology) is homogeneous for any cardinal κ. Thus, homogeneous
compact spaces can be made arbitrarily large in the sense of the cardinal
functions cardinality, weight, and character; however the spaces 2κ are small
in the sense of cellularity, since they all are ccc. There are also non-ccc com-
pact homogeneous spaces; for example, let X be the space 2γ for an ordinal γ,
where now X has the order topology, using lexicographical order. By Mau-
rice [1964], if γ is countable and indecomposable (∀α < γ(α + γ = γ)), then
X is homogeneous. If γ = ω, then X is just the Cantor set, but if γ > ω (for
example, γ is the ordinal ωω), then X has cellularity 2ℵ0. However, since γ
really must be countable here, 2ℵ0 is the largest cellularity obtainable by this
method. Thus, a natural question, posed ﬁrst by van Douwen, is:
Problem. Is there a compact homogeneous space with cellularity greater 391. ?
than 2ℵ0?
Perhaps this question depends on the axioms of set theory, although as far
as I know, the problem is open under any axioms. In the following, I survey
some partial results, with the hope that it might be helpful in the solution.
For a much more detailed survey, see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1987].
If the answer is “yes”, you need a non-trivial technique for producing ho-
mogeneous spaces; unfortunately, I don’t know of any that seem helpful here.
There are a number of results on products. Trivially, the product of homo-
geneous spaces is homogeneous. It is true (Keller [1931]), and non-trivial,
that [0, 1]κ is homogeneous for any inﬁnite κ, but these all have the ccc.
Likewise, Motorov showed that Xκ is homogeneous whenever κ is inﬁnite and
X is compact, ﬁrst countable, and 0-dimensional, but the cellularity of such
a product cannot exceed 2ℵ0. It is easy to produce homogeneous Boolean
algebras, but their Stone spaces are not in general homogeneous (see, e.g., be-
low). Ordered spaces won’t work; in fact, every homogeneous compact LOTS
is ﬁrst countable (and hence has cardinality (and hence cellularity) no more
than 2ℵ0). For the proof, observe, by taking a nested sequence of intervals,
263

264
Kunen / Large Homogeneous Compact Spaces
[ch. 16
that every compact LOTS contains either a P-point or a point of countable
character. Thus, if X is a homogeneous compact LOTS, then either every
point is a P-point (so X is ﬁnite), or every point has character ℵ0.
If the answer is “no”, you need a non-trivial technique for proving compact
spaces nonhomogeneous. One such technique, due independently to M. E.
Rudin and Z. Frol´ık, establishes that N∗is not homogeneous. Here, N de-
notes ω with the discrete topology, βN is its ˇCech compactiﬁcation, and N∗
is the remainder, βN\N. We identify each point p ∈N∗with a non-principal
ultraﬁlter. If xn (n ∈ω) are points in any compact space, X, and p ∈N∗, we
deﬁne the p-limit, limp⟨xn : n ∈ω⟩, to be the (unique) y ∈X such that for
each neighborhood, U, of y, {n : xn ∈U} ∈p (viewing p as an ultraﬁlter).
Then, in N∗, they showed that for any such p, p is not a p-limit of any discrete
sequence of points. Thus, taking y to be a p-limit of a discrete sequence, no
homeomorphism of N∗can move p to y.
The property which distinguishes p from y in the above proof (being a p-
limit of a discrete sequence) is a little complicated. Under the Continuum
Hypothesis or Martin’s Axiom, a simpler proof would be to use W. Rudin’s
theorem that there is a P-point in N∗; however, Shelah showed that one
cannot prove outright in ZFC that there is such a P-point. However, there is
always a weak P-point. In general, a point, x ∈X is called a weak P-point iﬀ
x is not a limit of any countable subset of X. I proved in Kunen [1978] that
there is a weak P-point in N∗, a result which has since been greatly improved
by van Mill and others; see van Mill [1984]. Since every inﬁnite compact
space must also contain points which are not weak P-points, this establishes
the nonhomogeneity of N∗via a more quotable property.
The Rudin-Frol´ık proof is still of great importance, since their method
applies to spaces which do not contain weak P-points.
For example, one
can use the study of p-limits to prove that no inﬁnite compact F-space is
homogeneous (or even stronger results—see Section 2). Here, X is called a
compact F-space iﬀX is compact and in X, any two disjoint open Fσ sets have
disjoint closures. For example, N∗is a compact F-space. Not every compact
F-space has weak P-points; for example, the absolute of [0, 1] (equivalently,
the Stone space of the regular open algebra of [0, 1]) is separable, and thus
has no weak P-points.
The Stone space of any complete Boolean algebra is a compact F-space; this
provides a large class of examples of homogeneous Boolean algebras whose
Stone spaces are not homogeneous.
Conversely, van Douwen [1981] has
shown that there is a non-homogeneous Boolean algebra whose Stone space
is homogeneous.
Returning to the problem of homogeneous compact spaces with large cellu-
larity, it might be hoped that one might do this by taking products, in analogy
to the results mentioned earlier for ﬁrst countable spaces. If so, the factors
must be chosen with some care as we show in Section 2, for example, no prod-

§2]
Products
265
uct of inﬁnite compact F-spaces is homogeneous. So, it now seems natural
to consider the following classes of compact spaces, X, graded by successively
weaker homogeneity properties.
Class 1. X is homogeneous.
Class 2. For some compact Y , X × Y is homogeneous.
Class 3. X is a retract of a compact homogeneous space.
Class 4. X is a continuous image of a compact homogeneous space.
Perhaps Class 4 contains all compact spaces. Of course, if it contains any
compact space of cellularity greater than 2ℵ0, then the answer to the Problem
is “yes”.
Class 3 does not contain all compact spaces. If X is the closure in the
plane of the graph of sin(1/x), x ∈(0, 1], then Motorov has shown, by a
connectedness argument, that X is not a retract of any compact homogeneous
space; see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1987] for a more general result along this line.
Note that this X is a continuous image of the Cantor set, and hence in Class 4.
It is not clear whether Classes 2 and 3 are distinct, or whether they contain
all compact 0-dimensional spaces. By Motorov’s previously mentioned result,
every compact, 0-dimensional, ﬁrst countable space is in Class 2. It is also not
clear whether Class 2 contains any inﬁnite compact F-space; if so, then the
proof in section 2 puts some restrictions about what the Y can be. Speciﬁcally,
Y cannot be any compact LOTS or any compact metric space or any compact
F-space, or any product of such spaces.
Finally, a simple sequence is a trivial example to show that Classes 1 and 2
are diﬀerent, even for metric spaces.
2. Products
The results of this section show that any product of an inﬁnite compact F-
space with any collection of other compact F-spaces or “simple” compact
spaces is not homogeneous. I am not sure what the best deﬁnition of “sim-
ple” is to get the strongest result (perhaps “simple” = “any”), but it cer-
tainly includes all sequentially compact spaces. A space, X, is called sequen-
tially compact iﬀin X, every ω-sequence has a convergent subsequence. So,
2ω is sequentially compact, as is any compact metric space. Every compact
LOTS is sequentially compact (just choose the subsequence to be increasing
or decreasing). Many compact spaces fail to be sequentially compact; for ex-
ample, βN, or N∗, or 2κ for any κ ≥2ℵ0; our Theorem below will, however,
apply to 2κ, since it allows arbitrary products of sequentially compact spaces.
Martin’s Axiom implies that every compact space of weight less than 2ℵ0
is sequentially compact. This is not provable in ZFC, although our Theorem
will apply to such spaces anyway by the following extension, which we now
discuss.
Call a space, X, sequentially small iﬀwhenever A is an inﬁnite subset

266
Kunen / Large Homogeneous Compact Spaces
[ch. 16
of X, there is an inﬁnite B ⊆A whose closure does not contain a copy
of βN. Obviously, every compact sequentially compact space and every space
of weight less than 2ℵ0 is sequentially small. In fact, if all points of X have
character less than 2ℵ0, then X is sequentially small, since by a theorem of
Posp´ıˇsil (see van Mill [1984]), βN must contain a point of character 2ℵ0. No
inﬁnite compact F-space can be sequentially small, since in such a space the
closure of every inﬁnite set contains a copy of βN.
Then, our result is:
1. Theorem. Suppose X = 
α<κ Xα, where each Xα is either an inﬁnite
compact F-space or contains a weak P-point or has a non-empty sequen-
tially small open subset. Suppose further that at least one Xα is an inﬁnite
compact F-space. Then X is not homogeneous.
We begin with some preliminaries on products. If we have a product, X =

α<κ Xα, we shall use subscripts for the coordinates, and superscripts for
indices of sequences in X. Thus, we might consider a sequence, ⟨xn : n ∈ω⟩
from X; each xn would be a κ-sequence ⟨xn
α : α ∈κ⟩, where xn
α ∈Xα. If
S ⊆κ, we let πS be the natural projection from X onto 
α∈S Xα.
Now, let us look more closely at sequences. In any compact space, call the
sequence ⟨dn : n ∈ω⟩nicely separated iﬀthe dn are all distinct and there are
open neighborhoods, U n (n ∈ω) of the dn such that for all A ⊆ω,
cl(

n∈A
U n) ∩cl(

n/∈A
U n) = ∅.
We say that the U n nicely separate the dn.
Nicely separated is the “op-
posite” of being convergent; it implies that the closure of {dn : n ∈ω} is
homeomorphic to βN. If X is an F-space, every discrete ω-sequence is nicely
separated—just take the U n to be disjoint open Fσ sets.
By the next lemma, in a product space, “nicely separated” depends only
on countable subproducts.
2. Lemma. Suppose X = 
α<κ Xα, where each Xα is compact, and suppose
each dn ∈X (n ∈ω). Then in the following, (a) ⇒(b) and (b) ⇐⇒(c):
(a) For some α ∈κ, ⟨dn
α : n ∈ω⟩is nicely separated in Xα.
(b) For some countable S ⊆κ, ⟨πS(dn) : n ∈ω⟩is nicely separated in

α∈S Xα.
(c) ⟨dn : n ∈ω⟩is nicely separated in X.
Proof. It is easy to see that (a) ⇒(b) and (b) ⇒(c); just pull back the nicely
separating neighborhoods. To show (c) ⇒(b), let the U n nicely separate the
dn.
We may, by shrinking them if necessary, assume that each U n is an
open Fσ set; say U n = 
k F n,k, where each F n,k is closed. But then, by a
standard compactness argument, each U n is a cylinder over a countable set of
co-ordinates. That is, each F n,k is covered by ﬁnitely many basic subsets of

§2]
Products
267
U n; taking the union of the supports of these basic sets for all n, k produces
a countable S ⊆κ such that each U n = π−1
S πS(U n). Then the πS(dn) are
nicely separated by the πS(U n).
We remark that in Lemma 2, it is easy to produce examples where (b) does
not imply (a), even when κ = 2.
Next, we look more closely at weak P-points in N∗. As before, we identify
βN with the set of ultraﬁlters on ω and N∗with the set of non-principal
ultraﬁlters. If p ∈βN and φ: ω →ω, we deﬁne φ∗(p) ∈βN by: A ∈φ∗(p) ⇐⇒
φ−1(A) ∈p. If p, q ∈N∗, we deﬁne p ≤q iﬀthere is a function, φ: ω →ω
such that p = φ∗(q). It is easy to verify that ≤is transitive and reﬂexive.
This partial order is due to M. E. Rudin and H. J. Keisler. We call p and q
Rudin-Keisler incomparable iﬀp ̸≤q and q ̸≤p. Then we quote the following
lemma from Kunen [1978]:
3. Lemma. There are weak P-points, p and q in N∗such that p and q are
Rudin-Keisler incomparable.
The next lemma uses the method of M. E. Rudin and Z. Frol´ık to show that
in a compact F-space, a p-limit of a discrete sequence cannot be a q-limit of
any sequence, except in the trivial case of a constant sequence.
4. Lemma.
Suppose p, q ∈N∗are weak P-points and are Rudin-Keisler
incomparable. Let X be any compact F-space. In X, let ⟨dm : m ∈ω⟩be a
discrete sequence of distinct points, and ⟨en : n ∈ω⟩any sequence of points
(possibly not distinct). Suppose that x = limp⟨dm : m ∈ω⟩= limq⟨en : n ∈
ω⟩. Then {n : en = x} ∈q .
Proof. Let K be the closure of {dm : m ∈ω}, and K∗= K\{dm : m ∈ω}.
Choose open sets, U m (m ∈ω) so that each dm ∈U m, and the U m are
disjoint from K∗and from each other. Let A = {n : en ∈K∗}, B = {n : en ∈

m∈ω U m}, and C = ω\(A ∪B). Then one of A, B, C is in q, resulting in
three cases; the second and third will lead to contradictions.
Case 1: A ∈q: Deﬁne a map f on N by f(n) = dn. Then, by the properties
of the ˇCech compactiﬁcation, f extends to a map, which we also call f, from
βN onto K. Since X is an F-space, f is a homeomorphism, let g be its inverse.
If n ∈A, then g(en) ∈N∗, and g(x) = p = limq⟨g(en) : n ∈ω⟩. Since p is a
weak P-point, we must have that {n : en = x} = {n : g(en) = p} ∈q .
Case 2: B ∈q: For n ∈B, let φ(n) be that m such that en ∈U m. Then
p = φ∗(q), contradicting that p and q were Rudin-Keisler incomparable.
Case 3: C ∈q: Observe that for n ∈C, en /∈K. By induction on n ∈ω,
choose open Fσ sets, V n and W n, such that for each n,
(i) dn ∈V n ⊆cl(V n) ⊆U n.
(ii) If n ∈C, then en ∈W n.
(iii) cl(W n) is disjoint from K and from V i for all i ≤n (If n /∈C we can
take W n = ∅).

268
Kunen / Large Homogeneous Compact Spaces
[ch. 16
(iv) V n is disjoint from W i for all i < n; this is possible by (iii).
But then 
n∈ω V n and 
n∈ω W n are disjoint open Fσ sets and x is in the
closure of both of them (by (ii)), contradicting that X is an F-space.
Of course, it follows that no inﬁnite compact F-space can be homogeneous,
since a p-limit of a discrete sequence cannot be moved to the q-limit of any
discrete sequence by a homeomorphism. The two distinct “types” of points
we produce, “p-limit of discrete sequence” and “q-limit of discrete sequence”,
are not very “quotable”, but the types produced in the proof of our main
Theorem will be even less quotable. Lemma 4 will be false in a product of
two compact F-spaces, since in such a product a p-limit of a discrete sequence
along the x-axis can equal a q-limit of a discrete sequence along the y-axis.
Thus, a more complex argument is needed to refute the homogeneity of such a
product. First, we need to quote one more lemma, due to Malykhin [1979].
5. Lemma. If βN is embeddable in 
i∈ω Xi, then βN is embeddable in at
least one Xi.
Proof. (Theorem 1) The hypotheses on the Xα are not mutually exclusive,
but partition κ arbitrarily into 3 subsets, R, S and T , such that R ̸= ∅, and
such that each Xα is an inﬁnite compact F-space for α ∈R, contains a weak
P-point for α ∈S, and contains a non-empty sequentially small open set for
α ∈T .
Choose dn ∈X for n ∈ω as follows: For each α ∈R let ⟨dn
α : n ∈ω⟩
be a discrete sequence in Xα. For each α ∈S let the dn
α be all the same
weak P-point in Xα. For each α ∈T let Uα be a non-empty open subset of
Xα whose closure is sequentially small, and let the dn
α be all the same element
of Uα.
Let p and q be as in Lemma 3. Let x = limp⟨dm : m ∈ω⟩and y = limq⟨dm :
m ∈ω⟩. We assume that h is a homeomorphism of X with h(y) = x, and
derive a contradiction.
Let en = h(dn). The dn are nicely separated in X since R ̸= ∅; thus the
en are also nicely separated in X. Applying Lemma 1, ﬁx a countable J ⊆κ
such that ⟨πJ(en) : n ∈ω⟩is nicely separated in 
α∈J Xα.
Observe that for each α, xα = limq⟨em
α : m ∈ω⟩= limp⟨dm
α : m ∈ω⟩. We
consider the three kinds of spaces Xα separately.
First, for each α ∈J ∩R, we may apply Lemma 4 to Xα and choose an
Aα ∈q so that em
α = xα for all m ∈Aα.
We may do likewise for each
α ∈J ∩S, using the fact that xα is a weak P-point. Since J ∩(R ∪S) is
countable, we may now choose an inﬁnite B which is almost contained in each
of these Aα; so, for these α, em
α = xα for all but at most ﬁnitely many m ∈B.
So, for these α, {em
α : m ∈B} is ﬁnite. We are not claiming that B ∈q.
Next, for those α ∈J ∩T , apply the deﬁnition of “sequentially small”
ω times and diagonalize to get an inﬁnite D ⊆B so that for each such α,
cl({em
α : m ∈D}) does not embed βN. (At each application, one ﬁrst tries

§2]
Products
269
to ﬁnd a subsequence where the em
α are distinct; if this is impossible, then
{em
α : m ∈D} will be ﬁnite.)
For each α ∈J, let Pα = cl({em
α : m ∈D}). Then each Pα does not embed
βN, so neither does 
α∈J Pα by Lemma 5. But this is a contradiction; the
product contains the closure of {πJ(en) : n ∈D}, which is homeomorphic to
βN, since the points are nicely separated.
If one assumes the Continuum Hypothesis or Martin’s Axiom, some of the
minor steps along the way to the proof can be strengthened. Now, one can
take p and q to be selective; i.e., minimal in the Rudin-Keisler order. In the
proof of the Theorem, we can then indeed take B ∈q. Also, in Lemma 4,
we do not have to assume that the sequence ⟨dm : m ∈ω⟩is discrete; it is
enough to assume the dm are distinct, since then there will be an E ∈p such
that ⟨dm : m ∈E⟩is discrete anyway. However, it is not clear whether the
Theorem itself can be strengthened in any essential way.
The Theorem overlaps somewhat with results of van Douwen [1978], who
established nonhomogeneity by a diﬀerent method—considering cardinal func-
tions rather than limit points. He showed, for example, that if X is compact
and |X| > 2π(X), then no power of X is homogeneous. So, this gives a diﬀerent
proof that no power of βN is homogeneous.
Another method, emphasizing limit points again, also may be used to es-
tablish nonhomogeneity of products in some cases. Call a strict Fω1 any union
of the form {Uξ : ξ < ω1}, where each Uξ is open and contains the closure
of {Uη : η < ξ}. Call x an L-point of X iﬀx is in the boundary of a strict
Fω1. Observe that if X is a product of spaces, Xα, then x is an L-point of
X iﬀsome xα is an L-point of Xα. Thus, if each Xα contains a non-L-point
and some Xα contains an L-point, then the product is not homogeneous. So,
for example, the ordinal ω1 + 1 cross any product of ccc spaces and spaces
containing a point of countable tightness is nonhomogeneous.
Yet another nonhomogeneity result is due to Dow and van Mill [1980],
who showed that no compact space can be covered by nowhere dense ccc
P-sets.
Thus, if X is compact and contains a non-isolated P-point, then
X cross any compact ccc space is not homogeneous. This applies to X =
ω1 + 1, although here, the “L-point” argument gives a stronger result. More
interestingly, it applies when X is the LOTS, 2ω1, ordered lexicographically;
here, every point is an L-point, so that the “L-point” argument says nothing.
It seems that the state of the art on homogeneity of products can be sum-
marized by saying that there are a lot of special results, without any unifying
theme emerging yet.

0. Introduction
This note collects some open questions on three separate topics. Sections 1
and 2 are concerned with diﬀerent aspects of compact-covering maps, and
Section 3 with continuous selections. All our questions deal with fairly basic,
intuitive concepts, and the questions in Section 1 are of interest even for
subsets of the plane.
1. Inductively perfect maps, compact-covering maps, and count-
able-compact-covering maps
Recall that a surjective map f: X →Y (all maps are continuous) is inductively
perfect if there is an X′ ⊂X such that f(X′) = Y and f|X′ is perfect. (If X
is Hausdorﬀ, this X′ must be closed in X). Since the inverse image under a
perfect map of a compact set is always compact, every inductively perfect map
f: X →Y must be compact-covering (i.e., every compact K ⊂Y is the image
of some compact C ⊂X), and clearly every compact-covering f: X →Y
is countable-compact-covering (i.e., every countable compact K ⊂Y is the
image of some compact (not necessarily countable) C ⊂X).
The following two questions were raised in Michael [1981b], where their
background and motivation are explained. In essense, negative answers to
these questions would provide negative answers to two rather natural ques-
tions about whether two theorems about open maps remain valid for the larger
class of tri-quotient maps introduced in Michael [1977]. Unlike these moti-
vating questions, however, Questions 1.1 and 1.2 do not involve tri-quotient
maps and are entirely about elementary, standard concepts.
Question 1.1. Let f: X →Y be a map from a separable metrizable space X 392. ?
onto a metrizable space Y , with each f −1(y) compact.
(a) If f is countable-compact-covering, must f be compact-covering?
(b) If f is compact-covering, must f be inductively perfect?
Question 1.2. Let f: X →Y be a map from a separable metrizable space X 393. ?
onto a countable metrizable space Y . If f is compact-covering, must f be
inductively perfect?
The following remarks may be helpful.
1.3.
I don’t know the answer to Question 1.1 even when Y ⊂I (or even
Y = I for 1.1(a)), X ⊂Y × I, and f(y, t) = y.
1.4.
I don’t know the answer to Question 1.2 even when Y = Q (rationals),
X ⊂Y × I, and f(y, t) = y.
1.5. The answer to both parts of Question 1.1 is “yes” if f is open, or, more
generally, if f(U) is a Gδ in Y for every open U in X. (Indeed, every open
273

274

[ch. 17
map f: X →Y from a metric space X onto a paracompact space Y , with
every f −1(y) complete in the given metric on X, must be inductively perfect
(Michael [1959b, Corollary 1.2]). If Y is metrizable, this remains true with
“open map f: X →Y ” weakened to “tri-quotient map f: X →Y with f(U)
a Gδ in Y for every open U ⊂X” (Ostrovsky [1986, Theorem 2])).
1.6.
The answer to Question 1.2 is “yes” if f is open. (Indeed, every open
map from a ﬁrst-countable space X onto a countable regular space Y has a
cross-section (Michael [1981a, Theorem 1.1])).
1.7.
The answer to both parts of Question 1.1 is “yes” if X is completely
metrizable. (Indeed, every countable-compact-covering map f: X →Y from a
completely metrizable space X onto a paracompact space Y , with each f −1(y)
separable, is inductively perfect (Michael [1977, Theorems 1.6 and 6.5(a)
and Remark 5.3])).
1.8.
The answer to Question 1.2 is “yes” if each f −1(y) is completely
metrizable (and thus the answer to Question 1.1(b) is “yes” if Y is count-
able). (Indeed, every compact-covering map f: X →Y from a metrizable
space X onto a countable regular space Y , with each f −1(y) separable and
completely metrizable, is inductively perfect (Michael [1981b, 1.2(c) and
Theorem 1.4])).
1.9.
The answer to both parts of Question 1.1 becomes “no” if the sets
f −1(y) are not assumed to be compact (or at least complete), even if f is
open. For 1.1(a) this follows from Michael [1959b, Example 4.1], and for
1.1(b) from Michael [1977, Example 9.7].
1.10.
The answer to Question 1.1 becomes “no” if “countable-compact-
covering” is weakened to “sequence-covering” (in the sense that every conver-
gent sequence, including its limit, in Y is the image of some compact set (not
necessarily a convergent sequence) C ⊂X). See Michael [1979, (3)].
2. Quotient s-maps and compact-covering maps
Recall that a map f: X →Y is an s-map if every f −1(y) is separable.
Compact-covering maps were deﬁned in Section 1.
Question 2.1. (Michael and Nagami [1973, Problem 1.5]) If a Hausdorﬀ
? 394.
space Y is a quotient s-image of a metric space, must Y also be a compact-
covering quotient s-image of a (possibly diﬀerent) metric space?
The following remarks will help to explain the origin of this question.
2.2.
The answer to Question 2.1 is “yes” if “quotient” is strengthened to
“open” in both hypothesis and conclusion (Michael and Nagami [1973,
Theorem 1.4]).

§3]
Continuous selections
275
2.3.
The answer to Question 2.1 is “yes” if “s-image of a metric space” is
strengthened to “image of a separable metric space” in both hypothesis and
conclusion (Michael [1966, Theorem 11.4 and Corollary 11.5]).
2.4.
The answer to Question 2.1 is “yes” if “compact-covering” is weakened
to “sequence-covering” in the sense of (1.10) above (Gruenhage, Michael
and Tanaka [1984, Theorem 6.1 (b)→(a)]).
2.5. For a positive answer to Question 2.1, it would suﬃce to conclude from
the hypotheses that Y must be a compact-covering s-image of a metric space;
indeed, since Y is Hausdorﬀand (being a quotient image of a metric space)
a k-space, any compact-covering map onto Y must be quotient.
(That Y
must be a compact-covering image (rather than s-image) of a metric space
follows from Michael and Nagami [1973, Theorem 1.1] and Fillipov [1969,
Corollary 3]).
3. Continuous selections
The questions in this section are all related to the following result.
3.1. Theorem (Michael [1956c, Theorem 1] and [1956a, Theorem 3.2′′]).
Let X be paracompact, Y a Banach space, K ⊂Y convex and closed, and
ϕ: X →Fc(K) l.s.c. Then ϕ has a selection.
In the above theorem, Fc(K) = {E ⊂K: E ̸= ∅, E closed in K and convex},
ϕ: X →Fc(K) is l.s.c. if {x ∈X : ϕ(x) ∩V ̸= ∅} is open in X for every open
V in K, and f: X →K is a selection for ϕ if f is continuous and f(x) ∈ϕ(x)
for every x ∈X.
Theorem 3.1 remains true, with essentially the same proof, if Y is only a
complete, metrizable, locally convex topological linear space. More generally,
and with rather more eﬀort, one can show that if suﬃces if Y is only a complete
metric space with a suitably deﬁned “convex structure”; see Michael [1959a]
and a recent improvement by D. W. Curtis in [1985]. That is as far as our
knowledge extends in this direction; without dimensional restrictions on X, no
way has been found to signiﬁcantly weaken these rigid convexity requirements
on Y . (By contrast, if X is ﬁnite-dimensional, then there are purely topologi-
cal conditions on the sets ϕ(x) which are not only suﬃcient but also necessary
(Michael [1956b, Theorem 1.2]). It is hoped that answers to the following
questions may shed additional light on various aspects of this problem; my
conjecture is that all three answers are negative.
Question 3.2.
Let X be paracompact, Y an inﬁnite-dimensional Banach 395. ?
space, and ϕ: X →Fc(Y ) l.s.c. with each ϕ(x) a linear subspace of deﬁciency
one (or of ﬁnite deﬁciency) in Y . Must ϕ have a selection f such that f(x) ̸= 0
for every x ∈X?

276
Michael / Some Problems
[ch. 17
Before turning to our next question, observe that the assumption in The-
orem 3.1 that K is closed in Y cannot simply be omitted, even if X = I
(Michael [1956a, Example 6.2]).
Question 3.3. (Michael [1988b]) Does Theorem 3.1 remain true if K is
? 396.
only assumed to be a convex Gδ subset of Y ?
Question 3.4. Does Theorem 3.1 remain true if Y is only assumed to be
? 397.
a complete, metrizable (but not necessarily locally convex) topological linear
space?
The following remarks may be helpful.
3.5.
All three questions are open even if X is a compact metric space.
3.6.
The answers to all three questions are “yes” if dim X < ∞; see
Michael [1956b, Theorem 1.2] for Questions 3.2 and 3.4, and Saint-Ray-
mond [1984] or Michael [1988a, Theorem 1.3] for Question 3.3.
3.7.
The answer to Question 3.2 becomes “no” if the sets ϕ(x) are only
assumed to be inﬁnite-dimensional, closed linear subspaces of Y ; this result,
which answers Michael [1988b, Question 2], follows from a recent example
obtained independently by Dranishnikov [1988] and by Toru´nczyk and
West [1989]. (A somewhat simpler example, where the sets ϕ(x) are only
inﬁnite-dimensional, closed convex subsets of Y , can be found in Michael
[1988a, Example 10.2]).
3.8.
It follows from Michael [1988a, Theorem 1.4] that the answer to
Question 3.2 is “yes” if the function ψ: X →Fc(Y ), deﬁned by ψ(x) = ϕ(x)∩
{y ∈Y : ∥y∥≤1}, is continuous with respect to the Hausdorﬀmetric on
Fc(Y ) (rather than merely l.s.c.). In fact, this remains true even if the sets
ϕ(x) are only assumed to be inﬁnite-dimensional, closed linear subspaces of
Y .
3.9.
It follows from (3.8) that, if B is an inﬁnite-dimensional Banach space
and if X = B∗\{0} and Y = B\{0} (both with the norm topology), then
there exists a continuous f: X →Y such that u(f(u)) = 0 for every u ∈X
(Michael [1988a, Theorem 1.5]). If the answer to Question 3.2 is “yes”, then
such an f exists even when X carries the weak∗topology and Y the norm
topology.
3.10.
The usual proof of Theorem 3.1 (see Michael [1956c] or [1956a])
depends on the existence of a metric on K (the one obtained from the norm)
which is complete and which “relates well” to the natural convex structure
on K. Under the weaker hypotheses of Question 3.3, however, there exist
metrics on K satisfying either of these two requirements but apparently no

277
metric satisfying both of them. That helps to explain the diﬃculty in trying
to obtain a positive answer to this question.
3.11.
The answer to Question 3.3 is “yes” if (conv C)−⊂K (closure in Y )
whenever C is a compact subset of some ϕ(x) (by Michael [1959b, Theo-
rem 1.1] and [1956a, Propositions 2.6 and 2.3 and Theorem 3.2′′]). While this
condition is not always satisﬁed under the hypotheses of Question 3.3, it is
satisﬁed, for example, if K is the intersection of open convex subsets of Y or
if dim ϕ(x) < ∞for every x ∈X.
3.12.
Question 3.4 is related to the following old problem: Let Y be a
metrizable topological linear space. Must Y (or even every convex subset of
Y ) be an absolute retract? (Some discussions which relate to this problem
can be found in Klee [1960b, 1960a] and Dugundji [1965]).

The questions we shall consider, with two signiﬁcant exceptions—Ques-
tions 4 and 5, are problems in general topology in the sense that their solutions
would probably avoid either homological or deep geometrical methods. The
aim of our note is very limited. We would like to recall some natural questions
in dimension theory (all well-known to specialists and a few of them classical)
which appeal by the simplicity of the statement and illustrate the diversity
of the subject. We refer the reader to the articles by V. V. Fedorchuk,
V. V. Filippov and B. A. Pasynkov [1979], V. V. Fedorchuk [1988],
B. A. Pasynkov [1985], R. Engelking and E. Pol [1983] and the surveys
by J. Nagata [1967, 1983c, 1983b], where many other interesting problems
and extensive bibliographies of the topic can be found. An excellent exposi-
tion of homological dimension theory, not discussed here, is given by A. I.
Dranishnikov [1988], this survey includes his fundamental recent results.
Many problems in continua theory are concerned with dimension; we refer
the reader to the article by W. Lewis [1983] for that matter.
Our terminology follows Nagata [1983a]. For a completely regular space
X, dim X is the Lebesgue covering dimension dim βX of the ˇCech-Stone com-
pactiﬁcation of the space X, i.e., dim X ≤n if each ﬁnite cover of X by func-
tionally open sets has a ﬁnite reﬁnement by functionally open sets such that
each point belongs to at most n + 1 of them.
The Menger-Urysohn inductive dimension ind, i.e., the small inductive di-
mension, is deﬁned as follows: ind X = −1 if and only if X = ∅, ind X ≤n if
each point can be separated, in X, from every closed set that does not contain
it, by a closed set L with ind L ≤n−1; ind X is the minimal n with ind X ≤n,
or, if no such n exists, we say that X is inﬁnite dimensional (cf., sec. 14)
The large inductive dimension Ind, considered for normal spaces only, is
deﬁned similarly, only now one deﬁnes Ind X ≤n if and only if each pair of
disjoint closed sets can be separated, in X, by a closed set L with Ind L ≤n−1.
A separable metrizable space X is weakly inﬁnite-dimensional if for each
inﬁnite squence (A1, B1), (A2, B2), . . . of pairs of disjoint closed sets there are
closed sets Li separating Ai from Bi in X such that ∞
i=1 Li = ∅; otherwise
we shall call X strongly inﬁnite-dimensional.
Separable metrizable spaces that are countable unions of zero-dimensional
subspaces are called countable-dimensional.
Countable-dimensional spaces (in particular, all ﬁnite-dimensional spaces)
are weakly inﬁnite-dimensional and the Hilbert cube is strongly inﬁnite-di-
mensional.
A compact metrizable will be called a compactum.
The real unit interval will be denoted by I, and I∞denotes the Hilbert
cube, i.e., the countable inﬁnite product of copies of I.
1.
How large can the gap between the inductive dimensions be for non- 398. ?
separable metrizable spaces?

Pol / Dimension Theory
[ch. 18
Two fundamental facts in dimension theory are that dim X = ind X =
Ind X for any separable metrizable space X and that dim X = Ind X for any
metrizable X.
1.1. Question. Does there exist for each natural number n ≥1 a metrizable
? 399.
space X with ind X = 0 and Ind X = n?
Spaces of this kind were deﬁned only for n = 1, the simplest example
of such a (complete, of weight ℵ1) space was given by J. Kulesza [19∞];
all known spaces illustrating this phenomenon are related to P. Roy’s con-
struction from [1968]. No examples appeared to refute the impression that
for any metrizable X with ind X = 0 one has Ind(X × X) = Ind X, see
Mr´owka [1985]. It is also an open question if there are metrizable topologi-
cal groups G with ind G < Ind G.
2. How can the basic dimensions diﬀer for compact spaces?
? 400.
This question was raised by P. S. Aleksandrov in [1936]. Among many
examples illuminating this problem (see V. V. Fedorchuk, V. V. Filippov
and B. A. Pasynkov [1979, §2]) let us mention the following ones constructed
by V. V. Filippov in [1970]: for each natural number n ≥1 there exists a
compact space Fn such that dim Fn = 1, ind Fn = n, and Ind Fn = 2n −1.
2.1. Question Does there exist for each natural number n ≥2 a compact
? 401.
space Xn with dim Xn = 1, ind Xn = 2 and Ind Xn = n?
As was pointed out by Filippov in [1970], a positive answer would provide
for an arbitrary triple k < l < m of positive integers a compact space X
with dim X = k, ind X = l and Ind X = m. It seems that Question 2.1 is
open for n = 4.
A compact space X is chainable, if for each open cover U of X there exists
a continuous map f: X →I such that each ﬁber f ←(t) is contained in some
element of U (this implies dim X ≤1).
2.2. Question. Does there exist a chainable compact space X with ind X <
? 402.
Ind X?
A space X is homogeneous if for each pair of points x, y in X there exists
a homeomorphism h: X →X with h(x) = y.
2.3. Question. Does there exist a homogeneous compact space X with
? 403.
ind X < Ind X?

Pol / Dimension Theory
283
V. A Chatyrko (see Pasynkov [1985, p. 234 and p. 241]) constructed for
each natural n a chainable compact space Xn with ind Xn = n and a homo-
geneous compact space Yn with dim Yn = 1 and ind Yn = n.
3. Can multiplication by the space of irrationals increase the dimension of a 404. ?
space?
In [1978] M. Wage constructed a Lindel¨of space X with dim X = 0 such
that for a certain subset B of the irrationals, dim(X × B) > 0.
3.1. Question. Does there exist a completely regular space X such that 405. ?
dim(X × P) > dim X, where P denotes the space of irrationals?
An interesting discussion of this problem is given by K. Tsuda [1985,
remark 12.1]. Let us notice that if dim(X × M) > dim X + dim M, where X
is countably paracompact and M is metrizable then the product X × M is
not normal, see Nagata [1983a, p. 201].
4.
Does every k-dimensional subset of the n-dimensional cube In have a 406. ?
k-dimensional compactiﬁcation embeddable in In?
This is a problem of K. Menger [1928]. By a result of Shtanko [1971]
this is equivalent to the question if for each k the k-dimensional Menger
compactum M n
k in In is universal for all k-dimensional subsets of In.
5. Does there exist a cell-like map of a 2-dimensional compactum onto an 407. ?
inﬁnite-dimensional one?
A compactum K is cell-like if any continuos map of K into a polyhedron
is null-homotopic. A continuous map f: X →Y of a compactum X onto a
compactum Y is cell-like
indexcell-like map—seemap, cell-like if all ﬁbers f ←(y) are cell-like. In [1988]
Dranishnikov constructed a cell-like map of a 3-dimensional compactum
onto an inﬁnite-dimensional one, thus solving a classical problem in dimen-
sion theory (no cell-like map of a one-dimensional compactum can raise the
dimension see Walsh [1981, Corollary 3.3]).
It follows that there exists a cell-like map of the 7-dimensional cube I7 onto
an inﬁnite-dimensional compactum. G. Kozlowski and J. J. Walsh proved
in [1983] that no cell-like map deﬁned on I3 can raise the dimension, but for
the cubes of dimensions 4, 5 or 6 this remains open.
The following theorem of E. V. Shchepin, see Dranishnikov and Shchepin
[1986, Theorem 1 in §5] (closely related to results by R. D. Edwards, see

284
Pol / Dimension Theory
[ch. 18
Walsh [1981]), provides a reformulation of the problem considered in this
section.
Let K be a compactum in the Hilbert space ℓ2; the compactum K is the
range of a cell-like map deﬁned on an n-dimensional compactum if and only
if for each map f: L →K where L is a (n + 1)-dimensional compactum,
and every ϵ > 0 there exists a map u: L →ℓ2 such that dim(u[L]) ≤n and
∥u(x) −f(x)∥< ϵ for all x ∈L.
6. Does a countable union of zero-dimensional sets in the Hilbert cube which
? 408.
has positive dimension contain a one-dimensional subset?
This is a problem of L. A. Tumarkin [1962].
Let pj: I∞→I be the projection onto the jth coordinate.
6.1. Question. Is it true that for any countable-dimensional set E ⊆I∞
? 409.
there exists a decomposition E = E0∪E1∪. . . such that dim E0 ≤0, dim Ej ≤
1, for j ≥1, and for each j = 1, 2, . . . the projection pj[Ej] is countable?
If E provides a negative answer to this question then the Continuum Hy-
pothesis would allow one to deﬁne a subset M of E giving a negative answer
to Tumarkin’s problem. Let us sketch the argument.
To begin let us notice that there exists a pair A, B of disjoint closed sets
in the space E and a countable set Q ⊆I such that whenever Dj ⊆E are at
most one-dimensional sets with countable projection pj[Dj] disjoint from Q,
the union ∞
j=1 Dj does not separate A from B in E (such a pair can be found
in any collection A of pairs of disjoint closed sets in E with the property that
given F closed in E and p ̸∈F there is (C, D) ∈A with p ∈C and F ⊆D).
By the Continuum Hypothesis, all closed sets separating A from B in E can
be arranged in a sequence L1, L2, . . . , Lα, . . ., α < ω1, and all at most one-
dimensional Gδ-sets in I∞can be arranged into a sequence G1, G2, . . . , Gα, . . .,
α < ω1. Let us choose by transﬁnite induction points xα ∈Lα and distinct
points qjα ∈I \ Q such that whenever pj[Gα] is uncountable, qjα ∈pj[Gα],
and
{xα : α ≤ξ} ∩
∞

j=1

{p←
j (qjα) ∩Gα : α ≤ξ} = ∅
for every ξ. The choice of the pair A, B quaranteees that this procedure does
not terminate at a countable stage. Let M = {xα : α < ω1}. Each closed
set separating A and B in E hits M, so M has positive dimension. Suppose
N ⊆M is one-dimensional. Then, for some j, the projection pj[N] contains
a nontrivial interval J, see Walsh [1979].
Let α be an ordinal such that
p←
j [J] ∩N ⊆Gα ⊆p←
j [J] and consider the point qjα ∈J. Then p←
j (qjα) ∩
Gα ∩M ̸= ∅and we arrive at a contradiction with the choice of M.

7. Does there exist a weakly inﬁnite-dimensional compactum of positive di- 410. ?
mension without any subcompactum of dimension one?
In [1967] D. W. Henderson proved that each strongly inﬁnite-dimensional
compactum contains an inﬁnite-dimensional compactum all of whose sub-
compacta of positive dimension are strongly inﬁnite-dimensional (L. R. Ru-
bin [1980] has shown that “compacta” can be replaced by “sets”; this is
related to the result by Walsh quoted after Question 8). The following two
questions are related to the question we started with.
7.1. Question. Let f: S →T be a continuous map of a compactum S onto 411. ?
a compactum T with dim f ←(t) = 0 for all t ∈T . If T is weakly inﬁnite-
dimensional, is this also true for S?
7.2. Question. If X and Y are weakly inﬁnite-dimensional compacta, is it 412. ?
true that the product X × Y is weakly inﬁnite-dimensional?
If a map f: S →T would provide a negative answer to Question 7.1 then
T would contain a compactum K giving a negative answer to Question 7.2.
To see this, let us consider a countable-dimensional set M ⊆T intersecting
each one-dimensional subset of T (Pol [1986]).
Then, since f ←[M] is a
countable union of zero-dimensional sets in the strongly inﬁnite-dimensional
compactum S, there exists a nontrivial continuum C ⊆S \ f ←[M] and the
compactum K = f[C] has the required property.
In turn, if a pair X, Y of compacta provides a negative answer to Ques-
tion 7.2, then Henderson’s result quoted above yields a strongly inﬁnite-
dimensional compactum S in X ×Y such that each compactum ({x}×Y )∩S
is zero-dimensional (being weakly inﬁnite-dimensional) and hence the projec-
tion onto the ﬁrst coordinate, restricted to S provides a negative answer to
Question 7.1
8. Does there exist an inﬁnite-dimensional compactum whose square does not 413. ?
contain one-dimensional subsets?
J. Walsh [1979] constructed an inﬁnite-dimensional compactum all of
whose subsets of positive dimension are strongly inﬁnite-dimensional. The
following question was asked by J. van Mill [1983, remark 5.7].
8.1. Question. Does there exist an inﬁnite-dimensional compactum X none 414. ?
of whose ﬁnite powers Xn contain one-dimensional subsets?
Any inﬁnite-dimensional compactum K which is the range of a cell-like map
deﬁned on a 3-dimensional compactum (after Question 5 we quoted Dranish-
nikov’s result to that eﬀect) has the property that any ﬁnite-dimensional set E
in its nth power Kn has dimension at most 3n.

286
Pol / Dimension Theory
[ch. 18
In [1980] D. Ranchin modiﬁed an argument by W. Hurewicz [1932] to
deﬁne, assuming the Continuum Hypothesis, a separable metrizable space E
such that all uncountable subsets of every ﬁnite power En are inﬁnite-dimen-
sional.
8.2. Question. Does there exist an inﬁnite-dimensional separable metrizable
? 415.
space M not containing any subset of dimension one whose square M × M
does contain a one-dimensional subset?
It is unclear if there exists a ﬁnite-dimensional set E ⊆I∞× I∞such that
for each countable-dimensional C ⊆I∞, the set E \ (C × I∞∪I∞× C) has
positive dimension.
If such a set E indeed exists, the Continuum Hypothesis would allow one
to repeat Hurewicz’s argument to deﬁne a space M answering Question 8.2.
Let us indicate this argument:
The assumption about E yields the existence of a point p ∈E and a closed
subset F of E not containing p, such that no closed set separating p from F
in E can be a subset of a set of the form C × I∞∪I∞× C with C ⊆I∞
countable-dimensional.
Let us arrange, using the Continuum Hypothesis, all closed sets separating p
from F in E in a sequence L1, L2, . . . , Lα, . . ., α < ω1 and all zero-dimensional
Gδ-sets in I∞in a sequence G1, G2, . . . , Gα, . . ., α < ω1. For each α < ω1 one
can choose a point ⟨xα, yα⟩∈Lα\(Cα×I∞∪I∞×Cα), where Cα = 
β≤α Gβ,
and let M = {xα : α < ω1} ∪{yα : α < ω1}.
Since M intersects each Gα in an at most countable set, the uncountable
subsets of M are inﬁnite-dimensional. On the other hand, S = {⟨xα, yα⟩:
α < ω1} ⊆(M × M) ∩E is a ﬁnite-dimensional set of positive dimension,
as each closed set separating p from F in E hits S. Therefore, S contains a
one-dimensional subset, by the inductive character of dimension.
9. If a homogeneous compactum is not ﬁnite-dimensional, is it then strongly
? 416.
inﬁnite-dimensional?
The notion of homogeneity was recalled just before Question 2.3. It is even
unclear what the answer is if we assume that the homogeneous compactum
contains topologically each ﬁnite-dimensional cube In.
10. What is the compactness degree of the n-dimensional cube In with one
? 417.
open face removed?
The compactness degree cmp X of a separable metrizable space X is deﬁned
as follows (Isbell [1964]): cmp X = −1 iﬀX is compact, cmp X ≤n if each
point and each closed set not containg the point can be separated in X by

ch. 18]
Pol / Dimension Theory
287
a closed set L with cmp L ≤n −1 and cmp X is the minimal n for which
cmp X ≤n, or cmp X = ∞if no such n exists. The following question was
asked by J. de Groot and T. Nishiura in [1966].
10.1. Question. Let Jn = [0, 1]n+1 \ {0} × (0, 1)n. What is cmp Jn?
418. ?
It is unknown if cmp Jn −→∞. Let def X = min{dim( ˜
X\X) : ˜X is a
compact metrizable extension of X } be the defect of a separable metrizable
space X. Then cmp X ≤def X and def Jn = n.
In [1988] T. Kimura deﬁned for each n = 1, 2, . . . a closed subspace Kn of
the space J2n+1 such that cmp Kn ≤n and def Kn ≥2n (exact estimates are
not given in Kimura [1988]). K. P. Hart constructed for each n = 1, 2, . . . a
closed subspace Hn of J2n−1 with cmp Hn = 1 and def Hn ≥n (unpublished
notes, 1985), see also Kimura [19∞].
11.
Is the dimension of a compactum determined by the topology of its 419. ?
function space?
Let Cp(X) be the space of continuous real-valued functions on a completely
regular space X endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence.
11.1.
Question.
Let X and Y be completely regular spaces such that 420. ?
the function spaces Cp(X) and Cp(Y ) are homeomorphic.
Is it true that
dim X = dim Y ?
The answer is unknown even if X and Y are compacta. Gul′ko proved
in [19??] that for completely regular spaces X and Y , if Cp(X) and Cp(Y )
are uniformly homeomorphic with respect to their natural uniform structures
then dim X = dim Y .
12. What properties of a metric characterize the dimension of the induced 421. ?
topology?
The following is a conjecture of J. de Groot [1957] who proved it for
compacta.
12.1. Question. Given a metrizable space X, is it true that dim X ≤n if 422. ?
and only if there exists a metric d on X compatible with the topology such
that for each point x ∈X and any set A ⊂X\{x} of cardinality n + 2 there
are distinct points a, b ∈A with d(a, b) ≤min{d(x, c) : c ∈A }?
In [1964] J. Nagata gave a characterization of the dimension in terms
of metrics which implies in particular that the condition in this question is
necessary.

13. Questions concerning zero-dimensional maps with inﬁnite-dimensional
range.
One such question is Question 7.1; here we state two more.
13.1. Question. Let f: X →Y be a continuous map of a compactum X
? 423.
onto a compactum Y with dim f ←(y) = 0 for all y ∈Y . Does there exist
a nontrivial continuous function u: X →I into the unit interval such that
u[f ←(y)] is zero-dimensional for all y ∈Y ?
H. Toru´nczyk proved (unpublished) that if Y is a countable-dimensional
compactum then almost all maps u: X →I, in the sense of Baire category,
have this property.
13.2. Question. Let f: X →Y be an open map of a compactum X onto
? 424.
a compactum Y , such that all ﬁbers f ←(y) are homeomorphic to the Cantor
set. Does there exist a continuous map u: X →I such that u[f ←(y)] = I for
all y ∈Y ?
This question is taken from Bula [1983], where it is proved that for ﬁnite-
dimensional Y the answer is positive.
14. Questions concerning the transﬁnite extension of the inductive Menger-
Urysohn dimension.
All spaces in this part are metrizable and separable. If we allow n in the
deﬁnition of the small inductive dimension ind given at the beginning of this
note to be an arbitrary ordinal number, we obtain the transﬁnite extension of
the Menger-Urysohn dimension. The transﬁnite dimension ind, if deﬁned—we
abbreviate this by ind X ̸= ∞, has its values in the set of countable ordinals.
If ind X ̸= ∞then X is countable-dimensional and for complete spaces the
converse is also true.
14.1.
Question.
Given a countable ordinal α, does there exist a com-
? 425.
pactum Kα with ind Kα = α which contains topologically all compacta X
with ind X ≤α?
If “compactum” is replaced by “separable metrizable space” then the answer
is positive (Pol [1986]).
W. Hurewicz proved that if ind X ̸= ∞then X
has a compact metrizable extension ˜X with ind ˜X ̸= ∞. The following is a
conjecture of L. A. Luxemburg [1982, p. 449].
14.2. Question. Is it true that every separable metrizable space X with
? 426.
ind X = α + n, where α is a limit ordinal and n is a natural number, has a
metrizable compact extension ˜X with

289
ind ˜X ≤α + (2n + 1)?
14.3. Question. Let f: X →Y be a continuous map of a compactum X 427. ?
onto a compactum Y such that the transﬁnite dimension ind of each ﬁber
f ←(y) is deﬁned. Is it true that sup{ind f ←(y) : y ∈Y } < ω1?
Many problems concerning the transﬁnite dimension can be found in R. En-
gelking’s survey [1980].

Most of the topics related to continua have rather visible geometric or
analytic connotations, and the list of open problems presented in this article
is no exception. In a way it also reﬂects the authors’ tastes and experiences.
As is always the case when making a selection, these tastes and individual
preferences are unavoidable. Here they should only be viewed as implying
that the authors consider the problems important and interesting.
By a continuum we mean a compact, connected metric space and by a
mapping we mean a continuous function. The statement that the continuum
M has the ﬁxed point property means that, if f is a mapping of M into M,
then there exists a point x of M such that f(x) = x. The following problem
is a classic one. A great deal of research in the theory of continua during the
past ﬁfty years has been motivated by attempts to solve it, and it still remains
open.
Problem 1.
If M is a non-separating plane continuum, does M have the 428. ?
ﬁxed point property?
The roots of this problem certainly lie in the work of Brouwer [1912] who
proved that every mapping of the disk, and in general, of the n-cell, into itself
has a ﬁxed point. Some historical comments and additional information with
other references, concerning partial solutions of Problem 1, can be found in
an article written by Bing in the Scottish Book (Mauldin [1981, pp. 190-
192], see also Bing [1969]).
Related ﬁxed point problems and results are
discussed in a survey compiled by Lewis [1983]. Indeed, work on Problem 1
has led to many discoveries. One milestone in the progress on this problem
is an example of Bellamy [1979] of a tree-like continuum without the ﬁxed
point property. It is not known whether the modiﬁed example of Bellamy of
a tree-like continuum with a ﬁxed point free homeomorphism is planar.
A mapping is said to be an ϵ-map provided the preimage of each point
has diameter less than ϵ. An arc is a continuum which has only two non-
separating points. A simple closed curve is a continuum with the property
that each two-point subset separates it. A tree is a continuum which is the
union of a ﬁnite collection of arcs and which contains no simple closed curve.
A continuum is tree-like if, for each positive number ϵ, there is an ϵ-map of it
into a tree. A continuum is arc-like or chainable if, for each positive number
ϵ, there is an ϵ-map of it into an arc. If f is a mapping from X into X, a
point x of X is said to be a periodic point for f provided there exists a positive
integer n such that f n(x) = x (here f n denotes the nth composite of f with
itself).
Problem 2.
If M is a tree-like continuum and f is a mapping of M into M, 429. ?
does f have a periodic point?
The mappings of the examples of Bellamy, although free of ﬁxed points,
297

298
Cook, Ingram and Lelek / Continua
[ch. 19
nonetheless have periodic points. Problem 2 appears in at least two places:
The Houston Problem Book [1986, Problem 34] and Lewis [1983, Problem 35].
If M is a continuum and d is the metric on M, the span of M, denoted
σM, is deﬁned by σM = inf{ϵ : there is a subcontinuum Z of M × M such
that π1Z = π2Z and d(x1, x2) ≥ϵ for each (x1, x2) in Z}, where π1 and π2
are the standard projections, that is, π1(x1, x2) = x1 and π2(x1, x2) = x2 for
(x1, x2) ∈M × M. A triod is a continuum T which contains a subcontinuum
K such that T −K has more than two components. A continuum is said to
be atriodic if it contains no triod. A simple triod is a triod which is the union
of three arcs joined at a common end-point. A simple 4-od is a tree which is
the union of four arcs joined at a common end-point. Simple 4-ods as well as
simple triods are special kinds of trees. Suppose K is a collection of one or
more trees. A continuum is K-like if, for each positive number ϵ, there is an
ϵ-map of it into a tree from K.
Problem 3.
Does there exist a tree-like continuum M with positive span
? 430.
such that the plane contains uncountably many mutually exclusive homeo-
morphic copies of M?
The plane does not contain uncountably many mutually exclusive triods
(see Moore [1962, p. 222], originally Moore [1926]). However, the plane
contains an uncountable collection of mutually exclusive, simple-triod-like
continua with positive span (Ingram [1974]). The members of this collec-
tion are far from homeomorphic since the collection has no model (i.e., no
continuum can be mapped onto every member of the collection). In [1982]
Oversteegen and Tymchatyn have results in the direction of answering
this problem. In particular, they show that not every atriodic tree-like contin-
uum can be embedded in the plane and that there is a planar, atriodic tree-like
continuum M such that the plane does not contain uncountably many mutu-
ally exclusive homeomorphic copies of M. Problem 3 appears as Problem 3.8
in their abovementioned paper. There they also ask, in particular, if X ×C is
planar, where X is the continuum of Ingram [1972] and C is the Cantor set.
A continuum is hereditarily equivalent if it is homeomorphic to each of its
non-degenerate subcontinua. A continuum is decomposable if it is the union
of two of its proper subcontinua and is indecomposable otherwise.
Problem 4.
Does there exist an hereditarily equivalent continuum other
? 431.
than the arc and the pseudo-arc?
The arc and the pseudo-arc are hereditarily equivalent. In [1948] Moise
constructed the pseudo-arc to obtain an hereditarily equivalent continuum
which is not an arc. He called the continuum he constructed a pseudo-arc
because of its hereditary equivalence. In [1951b] Bing showed that each two
hereditarily equivalent indecomposable chainable continua are homeomorphic.

ch. 19]
Cook, Ingram and Lelek / Continua
299
In [1960] Henderson showed that the arc is the only decomposable hereditar-
ily equivalent continuum. In [1970] Cook showed that hereditarily equivalent
continua are tree-like, and thus there are no inﬁnite-dimensional hereditarily
equivalent continua.
Problem 5.
Does there exist an atriodic simple-4-od-like continuum which 432. ?
is not simple-triod-like?
The example of Ingram [1972] is atriodic, simple-triod-like and not arc-
like (i.e., not 2-od-like). Thus, Problem 5 and its obvious modiﬁcations are
natural in light of this type of example.
In [1983] Sam Young raises as
Problem 115 essentially this same question. The only diﬀerence is that in
place of “atriodic” he asks that every proper subcontinuum be an arc. Of
course, if every proper subcontinuum of a continuum is an arc, then the
continuum is atriodic (Ingram [1968]).
Problem 6.
Do there exist in the plane two simple closed curves J1 and J2 433. ?
such that J1 lies in the bounded complementary domain of J2 but the span
of J1 is greater than the span of J2?
Almost nothing seems to be known about the span of plane continua. Even-
tually, one wishes to know how span and surjective span of plane continua are
related. A good place to start seems to be with this fundamental, unanswered
question. It has been published in “The Houston Problem Book” as Problem
173 (dated 1981).
The symmetric span of M, denoted sM, is deﬁned in a manner similar to
that of the span of M changing only the condition π1Z = π2Z in the deﬁnition
of span to Z = Z−1, where Z−1 = {(x2, x1) : (x1, x2) ∈Z}. The surjective
span of M, denoted σ∗M, is also deﬁned similarly to the span with only one
additional requirement, namely that π1Z = π2Z = M.
Problem 7.
If M is a plane continuum, is σM = sM?
434. ?
The dyadic solenoid has long been known to be an example of a continuum
with positive span which has zero symmetric span. In [1984] Davis has shown
that sM ≤σM for all continua, and that if sM = 0, then M is atriodic and
hereditarily unicoherent.
Problem 8.
If M is a continuum and σM = 0, is M chainable?
435. ?
This is becoming a classic problem in the theory of continua. Problem 8
was ﬁrst stated in print in Lelek [1971]; the fact that chainable continua have
span zero had been known earlier (Lelek [1964]). A positive answer to this
problem would complete the classiﬁcation of homogeneous plane continua (see

300
Cook, Ingram and Lelek / Continua
[ch. 19
Oversteegen and Tymchatyn [1982] and also Davis [1984]). It is known
that continua of span zero, i.e., continua M such that σM = 0, are tree-
like (Oversteegen and Tymchatyn [1984]). A stronger result has been
recently established, namely that continua of surjective span zero (σ∗M = 0)
are tree-like, see Kato, Koyama and Tymchatyn [19∞].
A mapping f from X onto Y is said to be conﬂuent provided, for each
subcontinuum K of Y , each component of f −1(K) is mapped by f onto K. If
the last condition is satisﬁed by at least one component rather than by each
one, then the mapping is called weakly conﬂuent. A monotone mapping is a
mapping whose preimages of points are connected.
Problem 9.
Is the conﬂuent image of a chainable continuum also chainable?
? 436.
This problem also ﬁrst appeared in Lelek [1971]. In [1972] McLean has
shown that the conﬂuent image of a tree-like continuum is tree-like. Prob-
lems 8 and 9 then both lie in the general area of determining among tree-like
continua which ones are chainable. This question, although not speciﬁcally
stated in this list of problems, is fundamental to determining the structure
of one-dimensional continua and can be seen to have motivated a lot of the
work on the problems mentioned here. In [1978] Grace and Vought provide
an example of a chainable continuum and a weakly conﬂuent mapping of it
onto a simple triod (see also Cook and Lelek [1978]). In two special cases
Problem 9 is known to have an aﬃrmative answer: for monotone mappings
(Bing [1951a]) and for open mappings (Rosenholtz [1974]).
Problem 10.
Does there exist a tree-like continuum M such that no mono-
? 437.
tone image of any subcontinuum of M is chainable?
The construction of continua as inverse limits with atomic mappings, as in
Anderson and Choquet [1959], Cook [1967] and Ingram [1981], will not
produce such a continuum. The search for a solution to Problem 4 motivates
Problem 10.
Suppose M is an hereditarily equivalent continuum which is neither an
arc nor a pseudo-arc.
Then M is hereditarily indecomposable (Hender-
son [1960]) and M is tree-like (Cook [1970]), and, in light of Problem 8,
we might conjecture that M has positive span (hereditarily). It can then be
shown that there exists in M × M a continuum Z with the property that
π1Z = π2Z = M and, for each (x1, x2) in Z, M is irreducible from x1 to
x2 and, furthermore, that such is the case for every monotone image of M.
Thus, M would be a continuum as in Problem 10.
Problem 11.
Is it true that σX ≤2σ∗X for each connected metric space X?
? 438.
The inequalities which follow directly from the deﬁnitions of span, semi-
span, surjective span and surjective semi-span (Lelek [1976]) lead to several

References
301
questions related to this one (see Lelek [1977, p. 38]). On the other hand, an
example shows that σ∗X can be 1
2σX (Lelek [1976]) and the geometry of it,
and of a number of related constructions (West [1983]), is quite intriguing.
Problem 11 was originally published in The Houston Problem Book [1986], as
part of Problem 83 (dated 1975).

This paper deals with three problems that have had a continuous appeal
to researchers in the theory of continua since the start of the subject. The
three problems are the ﬁxed-point problem for nonseparating plane continua,
the classiﬁcation of hereditarily equivalent continua, and the classiﬁcation
of homogeneous continua. A common theme in these problems is that each
requires us to answer certain questions about tree-like curves, sometimes even
the same questions; furthermore, these questions seem to capture the essence
of continua theory as it has been practiced over the last several years.
I have asked several questions on each of these problems, questions chosen
mainly because they appeal to me. I don’t think any of them are inadequately
worded or already answered, but if so, I hope the reader will adjust for that.
I have made little attempt to associate a name with a question, for if I had
made an error there under the pressure of a deadline, it’s less likely I would
be forgiven for that. In particular, many of these questions were ﬁrst asked
by someone else, and if you solve one, I will be glad to help you ﬁnd out who
it was. I do claim that all these questions are interesting to me, and that
most continua theorists sense some underlying unity ﬂowing through these
questions.
A few problems that appeal to me could not be included under this rubric.
I have indulged myself by including them in a ﬁnal section of miscellaneous
questions.
Since this is a selection of problems and not a survey article, I have not
included references or many deﬁnitions. Surveys of the status of the classiﬁ-
cation problem for homogeneous continua, however, can be found in Rogers
[1983, 19∞].
A continuum is a compact, connected, nonvoid metric space. A curve is a
one-dimensional continuum. A map is a continuous function.
1. The Fixed-Point Property
No question has attracted more interest from continua theorists than the
following:
Question 1. Does every nonseparating plane continuum have the ﬁxed-point 439. ?
property?
Apparently the paper of Ayres in 1930 was the ﬁrst instance in which this
problem appeared in print. Ayres called it a “well known problem” and proved
that each homeomorphism of a nonseparating Peano plane continuum has a
ﬁxed point. In 1932 Borsuk improved this by proving that each map of a
nonseparating Peano plane continuum has a ﬁxed point.
This dichotomy between homeomorphisms and maps occurs more than once
in the history of this problem, and so the next question is natural.

Question 2. Does each nonseparating plane continuum have the ﬁxed-point

property for homeomorphisms?
In the case the homeomorphism extends to a homeomorphism of the plane,
the answer is yes.
R. H. Bing has shown that each one-dimensional, nonseparating plane con-
tinuum is tree-like.
Question 3. Does each planar tree-like continuum have the ﬁxed-point prop-

erty ?
Question 4.
Does each planar tree-like continuum have the ﬁxed point
? 442.
property for homeomorphisms?
D. Bellamy has exhibited a startling example of a tree-like continuum that
fails to have the ﬁxed-point property for homeomorphisms.
In 1938, Hamilton proved that each hereditarily decomposable, tree-like
continuum has the ﬁxed-point property for homeomorphisms.
The appro-
priate generalization to maps did not occur until 1976, when Manka proved
that every hereditarily decomposable, tree-like continuum has the ﬁxed-point
property.
In the late 1960’s, H. Bell and K. Sieklucki independently showed that any
counterexample to Question 1 must contain an indecomposable subcontinuum
in its boundary that is invariant under a ﬁxed-point-free map.
A natural
improvement to the Bell-Sieklucki result would be a positive answer to the
following question:
Question 5.
Can the Bell-Sieklucki result be improved to state that the
? 443.
indecomposable, invariant subcontinuum in the boundary is tree-like?
C. L. Hagopian has interesting partial results on these problems, many of
which use the Bell-Sieklucki theorem as a tool. A most interesting new result
along these lines is due to P. Minc, who showed that each weakly chainable,
nonseparating plane continuum has the ﬁxed-point property.
In light of the example of Bellamy and the construction of similar examples
by Oversteegen and Rogers, we need to understand more about the ﬁxed-point
property for tree-like continua.
Question 6. Does each T -like continuum (i.e., inverse limit of T ’s) have the
? 444.
ﬁxed-point property?
Question 7.
Does each hereditarily indecomposable, tree-like continuum
? 445.
have the ﬁxed-point property?

property?
Question 9. When does 2X have the ﬁxed-point property?
447. ?
2. Hereditarily Equivalent Continua
A continuum is hereditarily equivalent if it is homeomorphic to each of its
nondegenerate subcontinua. In 1921, S. Mazurkiewicz asked if each ﬁnite-
dimensional, hereditarily equivalent continuum is an arc. In 1930, G. T. Why-
burn proved that a planar, hereditarily equivalent continuum does not sep-
arate the plane.
Although the problem was posed as worthy of attention
by Klein in 1928 and Wilder in 1937, no further progress occurred until 1948,
when E. E. Moise constructed a pseudo-arc. The pseudo-arc is a hereditarily
indecomposable, hereditarily equivalent continuum in the plane, and so the
answer to Mazurkiewicz’s question is no.
The arc and the pseudo-arc are the only known hereditarily equivalent, non-
degenerate continua. G. W. Henderson showed that any new example must be
hereditarily indecomposable, and H. Cook showed that any new example must
be tree-like. J. T. Rogers observed that each continuum of dimension greater
than one contains uncountably many topologically distinct subcontinua.
Question 10.
Is every hereditarily equivalent, nondegenerate continuum 448. ?
chainable?
If the answer to this question is yes, then it is known that the arc and the
pseudo-arc are the only such examples.
Question 11. Does each hereditarily equivalent continuum have span zero? 449. ?
Oversteegen and Tymchatyn have recently shown that planar, hereditarily
equivalent continua have symmetric span zero.
Question 12. Does each hereditarily equivalent continuum have the ﬁxed- 450. ?
point property?
Question 13.
Is each indecomposable, hereditarily equivalent continuum 451. ?
homogeneous?

3. Homogeneous Continua
Question 14.
Is each homogeneous, nondegenerate nonseparating plane
? 452.
continuum a pseudo-arc?
If the answer is yes, then it is known that the nondegenerate homogeneous
plane continua are the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs.
Jones and Hagopian have shown that such a continuum must be hereditarily
indecomposable. Rogers has shown it must be tree-like. Oversteegen and
Tymchatyn have shown that it must have span zero and be weakly chainable.
Lewis has shown that it must contain a proper nondegenerate subcontinuum
that is not a pseudo-arc.
R. D. Anderson has shown that the circle and the Menger curve are the only
homogeneous, locally connected curves. The next step is to classify the impor-
tant class of so-called Type 2 curves—the aposyndetic homogeneous curves
that are not locally connected. All known examples of Type 2 curves can be
obtained as inverse limits of universal curves and covering maps. All of them
can be obtained as total spaces of Cantor set bundles over the Menger curve.

§3]
Homogeneous Continua

An aﬃrmative answer to Question 18 would be especially signiﬁcant, for it
would imply aﬃrmative answers to Questions 19, 20, and 21.
Question 22.
Suppose X is a homogeneous indecomposable curve whose 460. ?

If
X is not a solenoid, does X admit a continuous decomposition into tree-like
homogeneous curves so that the resulting quotient space is a solenoid?
Question 23. Is each tree-like, homogeneous curve a pseudo-arc?
461. ?
Aﬃrmative answers to Questions 15, 22, and 23 would be especially inter-
esting, for if the answer to each of these three questions is yes, then we can
classify homogeneous curves according to the following scheme: Each homo-
geneous curve would be
(1) a simple closed curve or a Menger universal curve, or
(2) the total space of a Cantor set bundle over a type (1) curve, or
(3) a curve admitting a continuous decomposition into pseudo-arcs such
that the quotient space is a curve of type (1) or (2), or
(4) a pseudo-arc.
Question 24. Is each tree-like, homogeneous curve weakly chainable?

0. Introduction and Notation
We consider only completely regular, Hausdorﬀspaces (= Tikhonov spaces).
In particular, our topological groups are Tikhonov spaces.
We do not distinguish notationally or grammatically between a topological
property T and the class of spaces with (or, in) T.
The class of (Tikhonov) spaces is denoted S; the class of homogeneous
spaces is denoted H; the class of topological groups is denoted G. Sometimes
for convenience we use C, CC, P and A to abbreviate the expressions com-
pact, countably compact, pseudocompact and Abelian, respectively. Thus for
example the expression G ∈CCAG means that G is a countably compact
Abelian topological group, and if T is a topological property then the expres-
sion X ∈TCH or X ∈CTH means that X is a compact homogeneous space
with property T.
The least inﬁnite cardinal number is denoted by the symbol ω; the symbols
α, γ, κ and λ denote inﬁnite cardinals, and as usual we write α = {ξ : ξ < α}.
The symbol α also denotes the set α with the discrete topology. The Stone-
ˇCech remainder of X is the space X∗= βX \ X; in particular, we write
α∗= β(α) \ α.
The Stone extension ¯f of a continuous function f: X →Y is that continuous
function ¯f: βX →βY such that ¯f|X = f. For p, q ∈X∗we write p ≈q if
there is a homeomorphism h of X onto X such that ¯h(p) = q.
For a transitive, reﬂexive relation (i.e., a pre-order) ≤E on a set S and for
p, q ∈S, we write p =E q if p ≤E q and q ≤E p. The relation ≤E is directed
downward if for all p, q ∈S there is r ∈S such that r ≤E p and r ≤E q.
The Rudin-Keisler pre-order ≤RK is deﬁned on ω∗by the condition p ≤RK q
if and only if there is f: ω →ω such that ¯f(q) = p. It is known that for p,
q ∈ω∗, the relation p =RK q holds if and only if p ≈q (see Comfort and
Negrepontis [1974, (9.3) and the notes to section 9] for a proof, and for
references to the literature).
The cardinality of a set X is written |X|. The weight, density character,
tightness and cellularity of a space X are written wX, dX, tX and cX, respec-
tively. A space X with cX ≤ω is a space with the countable chain condition
or, brieﬂy, a ccc space.
The symbols Z, R and T denote the integers, the reals, and the circle,
respectively, in each case with the usual algebraic operations and the usual
topology. We write
I = [0, 1] = {x ∈R : 0 ≤x ≤1}.
For a group G and A ⊆G, the symbol ⟨A⟩denotes the subgroup of G
generated by A; the torsion subgroup of G is denoted tG.

1. Embedding Problems
Of course every space X ∈S embeds into a topological group: The classical
result of Tikhonov [1929] shows how to embed X into RwX or TwX. (For
results on the embedding of non-Hausdorﬀspaces into compact homogeneous
spaces, see Korovin [1987].)
1A. p-compact spaces and groups; p-sequential spaces and groups
Following van der Slot [1966], we say that a topological property U is a
universal topological property if
(a) every compact space has U,
(b) the product of any set of spaces with U has U, and
(c) every closed subspace of a space with U has U.
Within the context of this article (Tikhonov spaces), the universal topo-
logical properties are exactly the topological extension properties deﬁned and
studied by Woods in [1975].
It is well known that for every universal topological property U and for
every space X there is a space βU(X), unique up to a homeomorphism ﬁx-
ing X pointwise, such that βU(X) has U, X is dense in βU(X), and every
continuous function from X to a space Y in U extends to a continuous func-
tion from βU(X) to Y .
This result, a special case of the adjoint functor
theorem of Freyd [1960, 1964], is accessible through arguments given by
Kennison [1965], van der Slot [1966, 1968], Herrlich [1967], Herrlich
and van der Slot [1967], Franklin [1971], and Woods [1975]; a systematic
exposition is given in Comfort and Negrepontis [1975].
Universal topological properties are easy to ﬁnd. For example, given any
topological property T such that I ∈T, the property U deﬁned by the con-
dition that X has U if and only if X is homeomorphic to a closed subspace
of a product of spaces in T is a universal topological property. A fertile class
of universal topological properties is suggested by the following deﬁnition.
1A.1. Definition. Let p be a non-principal ultraﬁlter on a discrete space α—
that is, p ∈α∗. A space X is p-compact if for every f: α →X the Stone
extension ¯f: β(α) →βX satisﬁes ¯f(p) ∈X.

§1]
Embedding Problems
317
In our context (Tikhonov spaces) this deﬁnition is equivalent to the deﬁni-
tion of p-compactness (for p ∈ω∗) given initially by A. Bernstein in [1970]
in connection with problems in the theory of non-standard analysis. It should
be noted that the p-limit concept of Bernstein [1970] coincides in important
special cases with the “producing” relation introduced by Frol´ık in [1967b,
1967a], with one of the orderings introduced by Katˇetov in [1961/62, 1968],
and with a deﬁnition given independently by Saks in [1972]. For proofs of
the fact that (for each p ∈α∗) p-compactness is a universal topological prop-
erty, see the original paper of Bernstein [1970], Ginsburg and Saks [1975],
Saks [1978], or Vaughan [1984]. In [1981] Kannan and Soundararajan
have shown for a vast class of properties U closely related to the universal
topological properties—the so-called PCS properties—that a space has U if
and only if it is p-compact for each p in some set or class of ultraﬁlters (living
perhaps on various discrete spaces). This result has been extended and formu-
lated in a categorical context by Hager in [1986]. For other results on spaces
required to be p-compact simultaneously for various p, see Woods [1975] and
Saks [1978].
It is known (Comfort and Ross [1966]) that the product of any set of
pseudocompact topological groups is pseudocompact. This makes it natural
to ask the following naive question: Is the product of countably compact
groups necessarily countably compact? An aﬃrmative answer (for arbitrary
products) is equivalent to the condition that there exists p ∈ω∗such that
every countably compact group is p-compact (see Comfort [1984, (8.9)]),
but it is apparently unknown whether this condition is consistent with the
axioms of ZFC. In the negative direction van Douwen [1980] used MA to
ﬁnd countably compact subgroups G and H of {−1, +1}c such that G × H
is not countably compact. (The papers of Malykhin [1987] and Hart and
van Mill [19∞] achieve the same conclusion with G = H ⊆{−1, +1}c. That
such a group G exists assuming MA had been announced, but not proved,
by van Douwen in [1980]. Malykhin [1987] assumes MA, while Hart and
van Mill [19∞] need only MAcountable.)
This positive and this negative
result suggest these three questions.
Question 1A.1. Is it consistent with ZFC that there exists p ∈ω∗such 475. ?
that every countably compact group is p-compact?
Question 1A.2.
Is it a theorem of ZFC that there exist two countably 476. ?
compact groups whose product is not countably compact?
Question 1A.3. Is there, for every (not necessarily inﬁnite) cardinal number 477. ?
α ≤2c, a topological group G such that Gγ is countably compact for all
cardinals γ < α, but Gα is not countably compact?
Concerning Question 1A.3, three comments are in order.

318
Comfort / Topological Groups
[ch. 21
(a) The restriction α ≤2c in 1A.3 should not be omitted, since Ginsburg
and Saks have shown in [1975] for each space X that if X2
 is countably
compact then Xα is countably compact for all cardinals α; indeed, the condi-
tion that X2
 is countably compact is equivalent to the condition that there
is p ∈ω∗such that X is p-compact.
(b) Question 1A.3 is the analogue for topological groups of one of the ques-
tions I posed some years ago (Comfort [1976]) in the context of (Tikhonov)
spaces. In [1985] Yang has shown in ZFC that a space X exists with X2

not countably compact but with Xα countably compact for all α < 2c if and
only if for every A ⊆ω∗with |A| < 2c there exists q ∈ω∗which is not ≤RK-
comparable to any p ∈A. The consistency with ZFC of this latter condition
has been established by Saks in [1979]. I do not know whether the existence
of such a space as above guarantees the existence of a group as in 1A.3, and
I do not know whether the existence of such a space is a theorem of ZFC.
(c) I am informed by van Mill that it is easy to augment the argument of
his paper with Hart (Hart and van Mill [19∞]) to answer 1A.3 positively
for α < ω (assuming MAcountable).
For ultraﬁlters p, q ∈ω∗we write p ≤C,S q if every q-compact space is
p-compact, and p ≤C,G q if every q-compact group is p-compact. (The com-
parison C on an arbitrary class T of spaces, denoted ≤C,T, would be deﬁned
as follows: p ≤C,T q if every q-compact space in T is p-compact.) It is clear
that ≤C,S⊆≤C,G in the sense that if p, q ∈ω∗and p ≤C,S q, then p ≤C,G q.
It is clear also that if for every q ∈ω∗every q-compact space X embeds as a
closed subspace of a q-compact topological group, then ≤C,S=≤C,G.
(Proof. Let p ≤C,G q and let X be a q-compact space. If X is closed in the q-
compact group G then X is p-compact because p ≤C,G q (so G is p-compact)
and p-compactness is closed-hereditary.)
This shows that an aﬃrmative answer to 1A.5 yields an aﬃrmative answer
to 1A.4.
Question 1A.4. Are the conditions p ≤C,S q and p ≤C,G q equivalent for

all p, q ∈ω∗(in other words, is the equality ≤C,S=≤C,G valid)?
Question 1A.5. For every q ∈ω∗, does every q-compact space embed as a

closed subspace into a q-compact topological group?
Conceivably ZFC settles 1A.4 aﬃrmatively, while 1A.5 is independent.

answer 1A.5 aﬃrmatively?
The relation ≤RK⊆≤C,S is easily established, but the orders ≤RK and
≤C,S do not coincide on ω∗/ ≈: in [1989] Garcia-Ferreira has shown in
ZFC that for every p ∈ω∗there is q ∈ω∗such that p =C,S q and p ≤RK

q and p ̸=RK q. Nevertheless the relations ≤RK and ≤C,S are intimately
related, as the following three theorems (all due to Garcia-Ferreira [1989])
make clear.
(1) p ≤C,S q if and only if there is r ∈ω∗such that r =C,S q and p ≤RK r.
(2) The space ω∗is downward directed under ≤RK if and only if ω∗is
downward directed under ≤C,S. (The ﬁrst of these conditions has been
shown by Blass and Shelah in [1987] to be consistent with the axioms
of ZFC.)
(3) If p is a weak P-point, then the three conditions p ≤RK q, p ≤C,S q
and p ≤C,G q are equivalent.
It follows from (3) that for p ∈ω∗conditions (a) and (b) below are equiv-
alent, and (c) implies each:
(a) p is ≤RK-minimal in ω∗;
(b) p is ≤C,S-minimal in ω∗and a weak P-point in ω∗;
(c) p is ≤C,G-minimal in ω∗and a weak P-point in ω∗;
In the model of Blass and Shelah [1987], the three conditions are equivalent.
The following two questions were suggested by Garcia-Ferreira.
Question 1A.7. For p ∈ω∗are the following conditions equivalent:
481. ?
(a) p is ≤C,S-minimal in ω∗;
(b) p is ≤C,G-minimal in ω∗;
(c) there is q ∈ω∗such that p =C,S q and q is ≤RK-minimal in ω∗?
Garcia-Ferreira has remarked in conversation that in the model of Blass
and Shelah [1987] the three conditions of 1A.7 are indeed equivalent.
From MA it follows—see Booth [1969, 1970] and Pfister [1985]—that
there exist (many) pairwise ≈-inequivalent (that is, pairwise =RK-distinct)
points in ω∗which are ≤RK-minimal in ω∗. In such a model, of course, ω∗is
not downward directed under ≤RK.
Question 1A.8. Does MA |= [ω∗is not downward directed under ≤C,G]?
482. ?
Following Kombarov [1983, 1985], we say for p ∈ω∗that a space X is
p-sequential if for every non-closed subset A of X there is f: ω →X such that
f[ω] ⊆A and ¯f(p) ∈X \ A. It is natural to consider the relation ≤G−F,S
deﬁned on ω∗by Garcia-Ferreira as follows: p ≤G−F,S q if every p-sequential
space is q-sequential. As it turns out, the relation ≤G−F,S coincides with
≤RK (Garcia-Ferreira [1989]); the trick to the proof is to proceed via
this “intermediate” equivalent property: the space ω ∪{p} (in the topology
inherited from β(ω)) is q-sequential. The relation ≤G−F,G is now deﬁned on
ω∗as expected: p ≤G−F,G q if every p-sequential group is q-sequential. The
appropriate analogues to 1A.4 and 1A.5 are these.
Question 1A.9. Is the equality ≤G−F,S=≤G−F,G valid?
483. ?

320
Comfort / Topological Groups
[ch. 21
Question 1A.10.
? 484.
(a) Does the space ω ∪{p} embed as a closed subspace into a p-sequential
group?
(b) Does every p-sequential space embed as a closed subspace into a p-
sequential group?
(The argument of Ordman and Smith-Thomas [1980] answers 2(b) aﬃr-
matively for kω-spaces; see Garcia-Ferreira [1989].)
An argument similar to the argument cited before 1A.4 shows that an aﬃr-
mative answer to 2(a) yields an aﬃrmative answer to 1A.9, but there remains
the analogue of 1A.6.
Question 1A.11. If M is a model of ZFC in which ≤G−F,S=≤G−F,G, must
? 485.
M answer 2 aﬃrmatively?
It is a theorem of Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1980] that the identity wG = tG is valid
for every compact group (indeed, if G is a compact group and the compact
set F ⊆G satisﬁes ⟨F⟩= G, then the cardinals wG, tG, wF and tF are all
equal Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1980, 3.8]). Since a p-sequential space has countable
tightness, it follows from Arkhangel′ski˘ı’s theorem that for a compact group G
the following conditions are equivalent:
(a) tG = ω;
(b) G is p-sequential for some p ∈ω∗;
(c) G is p-sequential for every p ∈ω∗.
The following three questions, which have evolved in conversations with
Garcia-Ferreira, now appear natural:
Question 1A.12. If G is a topological group and tG = ω, must there exist
? 486.
p ∈ω∗such that G is p-sequential?
Question 1A.13. (a) If X is a homogeneous space such that tX = ω, must
? 487.
there exist p ∈ω∗such that X is p-sequential? (b) What if X is compact?
It has been shown recently by Garcia-Ferreira, in [1989], using the fact
that the space ω∗is 2ω-directed in the order ≤RK (in the sense that if A ⊆ω∗
with |A| ≤2ω there is q ∈ω∗such that p ≤RK q for all p ∈A), that every
space X with |X| ≤2ω and tX ≤ω is p-sequential for some p ∈ω∗. In [1987]
Arkhangel′ski˘ı has conjectured that every compact homogeneous space X
such that tX ≤ω must satisfy |X| ≤2ω. It is clear that if Arkhangel′ski˘ı’s
conjecture is correct, then from this theorem of Garcia-Ferreira will follow an
aﬃrmative answer to 1A.13(b).

§1]
Embedding Problems
321
The question whether every compact space of countable tightness is se-
quential, raised by R. C. Moore and Mrowka in [1964], is answered in the
negative assuming diamond by Ostaszewski [1976] and independently, un-
der the same assumption, by Fedorchuk [1976]. Since the compact spaces of
Ostaszewski and Fedorchuk are of cardinality less than or equal to 2ω, they are
p-sequential (for some p ∈ω∗) by the theorem of Garcia-Ferreira [1989]
cited above. Recently, in [1988], Balogh, Dow, Fremlin and Nyikos have
used the proper forcing axiom to answer the Moore-Mrowka question in the
aﬃrmative; see Balogh [1989] for a detailed proof.
Since there exist spaces of countable tightness which are p-sequential for
no p ∈ω∗, a positive answer to the following question would yield a negative
answer to 1A.12.
Question 1A.14. Can every space X be embedded as a closed subspace into 488. ?
a topological group G such that tG = tX?
The answer is aﬃrmative when X is a kω-space (Garcia-Ferreira [1989]).
It is immediate from the theorem of Arkhangel′ski˘ı from [1980] cited just
after Question 1A.11 that for a non-degenerate compact group G and α > ω
the power Gα is p-sequential for no p ∈ω∗.
To answer in the negative (in ZFC) the question whether the product of
ﬁnitely many groups of countable tightness again has countable tightness, it
is enough to cite the argument of Malykhin [1987]. First, recall two nice
theorems from the literature:
(a) Przymusi´nski [1980]. There exist spaces X and Y such that Xn and
Y n are Lindel¨of spaces for all n < ω, but X × Y is not Lindel¨of; and
(b) Arkhangel′ski˘ı and Pytkeev (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1978, 4.1.2]). For
each space Z, the group C(Z) (in the topology inherited from RZ) has count-
able tightness if and only if Zn is Lindel¨of for all n < ω.
Now with X and Y chosen as in (a), the topological groups C(X) and C(Y )
satisfy tC(X) ≤ω and tC(Y ) ≤ω; but C(X) × C(Y ), which is topologically
isomorphic to C(Z) with Z the topological sum Z = X ⊕Y , satisﬁes t(C(X)×
C(Y )) > ω since X × Y is not Lindel¨of.
The following question, considered by Malykhin in [1987], remains un-
solved.
Question 1A.15.
Is there a topological group G such that ω = tG < 489. ?
t(G × G)?
In [1986] and [1987] Malykhin has shown that in the model of ZFC ob-
tained by adding a single Cohen real, there is in {−1, 1}ω+ an S-group G (that
is, a hereditarily separable, non-Lindel¨of group G) such that (tG = ω and)
t(G × G) > ω. If also MA holds and CH fails in the ground model, then G

[ch. 21
may be chosen Frechet-Urysohn; in this case, G is p-sequential for all p ∈ω∗,
and G × G is p-sequential for no p ∈ω∗.
Question 1A.16. Is it consistent with the axioms of ZFC that for p ∈ω∗
? 490.
the class of p-sequential groups is closed under ﬁnite products? Countable
products?
It must be mentioned that the questions listed above owe much to theo-
rems, conjectures and questions contributed by Arkhangel′ski˘ı in [1978,
1980, 1981b, 1987]. For example, in [1980, 1.17] Arkhangel′ski˘ı has conjec-
tured that every compact homogeneous space of countable tightness is ﬁrst
countable; Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1978, section 4] and [1987] contains fundamental
“positive” results on the stability of tightness under the formation of prod-
ucts, and Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1978] and [1980, page 21] raise questions about
embedding spaces into groups of countable tightness.
Most of the theorems enunciated and the problems posed in this section can
be phrased for other classes. For example, the class G of topological groups
may be proﬁtably replaced throughout by the class AG of Abelian groups.
1B. Closed Embeddings
Suppose that T ( = TS) is a topological property not closed under products.
In an eﬀort to investigate the behavior of TG under products, it is natural
to raise two questions: (a) Is the class T closed-hereditary? (b) Are there X
and Y ∈T such that X × Y ̸∈T and there exist embeddings X ⊆H ∈TG
and Y ⊆G ∈TG with X closed in H and Y closed in G? When (a) and (b)
can be answered aﬃrmatively, the proof is complete that the class TG is not
closed under products. A similar strategy, of course, may be attempted with
respect to the class TH.
This was the technique employed by van Douwen who, using the construc-
tion of Przymusi´nski [1980] referred to above, found two Lindel¨of groups G
and H such that G × H is not Lindel¨of.
(In Comfort [1984, 8.4] I indicated on the basis of a letter received from
van Douwen that his proof would appear in his paper van Douwen [19∞b].
More recently I have learned that the version of this paper now scheduled
for posthumous publication does not include this argument; it appears there-
fore that Comfort [1984, 8.4] is the most accessible published source for
van Douwen’s construction of two Lindel¨of groups whose product whose prod-
uct is not Lindel¨of.) Similarly, in [1983] Okromeshko has shown that for each
of the following properties T, every X ∈T embeds as a closed subspace (in-
deed, as a retract) into a space H(X) ∈TH: T = Lindel¨of, T = paracompact,
T = hereditarily paracompact, T = of tightness less than α. Since each of
these classes T is closed-hereditary and there is X ∈T such that X ×X ̸∈T,

§1]

it follows not only that TH is not closed under products but even that (for
each such T) there is Y = H(X) ∈TH such that Y × Y ̸∈TH.
Question 1B.1. (Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1980, 1981a, 1988]) (a) Is there a Lin- 491. ?
del¨of group G such that G × G is not Lindel¨of? (b) Can every Lindel¨of space
be embedded as a closed subspace of a Lindel¨of group?
What about the
Sorgenfrey line?
To ﬁnd a Lindel¨of group G such that G × G is not Lindel¨of it would suﬃce
to ﬁnd a Lindel¨of group G with a closed subspace which maps continuously
onto some Lindel¨of space X such that X ×X is not Lindel¨of. (For if A is such
a subspace of G then, since A × A maps continuously onto X × X, and A × A
is closed in G × G, the group G × G cannot be Lindel¨of.) This suggests the
following variant of Question 1B.1.
Question 1B.2. (a) Are there a Lindel¨of group G and a space X such that 492. ?
X ×X is not Lindel¨of and some closed subspace of G maps continuously onto
X?
(b) (Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1988]) Is the Sorgenfrey line the continuous image of
a Lindel¨of group?
Questions 1B.1(a) and 1B.2(a) should be considered in ZFC, since Ma-
lykhin, in [1986], using a ZFC-consistent axiom he calls N(ℵ1), has con-
structed a dense, hereditarily Lindel¨of subgroup of {−1, +1}ω+ such that
G × G is not a Lindel¨of space.
A nice construction of Uspenski˘ı [1983] shows (in just a few lines) how to
embed each space X as a retract into a suitable homogeneous space U(X)—
indeed, with U(X) homeomorphic to X × U(X). Using his construction re-
peatedly, Comfort and van Mill [1985] found a number of results similar in
spirit to those of Okromeshko [1983]. For example, there are pseudocompact
homogeneous spaces X0 and X1 such that X0 × X1 is not pseudocompact;
if MA is assumed (in order to ﬁnd two ≤RK-incomparable, ≤RK-minimal
points in ω∗), then X0 and X1 may be chosen countably compact.
Question 1B.3. Is there a pseudocompact, homogeneous space X such that 493. ?
X × X is not pseudocompact?
Question 1B.4. Is there a countably compact, homogeneous space X such 494. ?
that X × X is (a) not countably compact? (b) not pseudocompact?
Question 1B.4(a) is answered aﬃrmatively using MAcountable by the result
of Hart and van Mill [19∞] cited above. Since the product of pseudocom-
pact groups is pseudocompact (Comfort and Ross [1966]), questions 1B.3
and 1B.4(b) must not be carried from the class H over to the class G.

Comfort / Topological Groups
[ch. 21
In March, 1985, D. B. Motorov reported to a topological seminar at Moscow
State University (USSR) that the closure K in Euclidean 2-space of the graph
of the function f(x) = sin(1/x) (with 0 < x ≤1) does not embed as a retract
into any compact homogeneous space. As a consequence, there is no compact
space X such that K × X is homogeneous. (Our reference below to the pa-
per of Motorov [1985], like the reference given by Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1987,
(3.2)], is a triﬂe misleading, since it reduces to a single line with no substantial
mathematical content.) It is known, however, that every compact space em-
beds as a retract into a homogeneous space which may be chosen σ-compact
(Okromeshko [1983], Comfort and van Mill [1985]) or (for p ∈ω∗chosen
in advance) p-compact (Comfort and van Mill [1985]). This shows that
for every cardinal α there is a homogeneous σ-compact space X, and there is
a homogeneous countably compact space Y , such that cX > α and cY > α.
(For a proof, apply the theorems just cited to some compactiﬁcation of the
discrete space α+.) The following question remains open.
Question 1B.5.
(van Douwen) For what cardinal numbers α is there a
? 495.
compact, homogeneous space with cellularity greater than α? What about
the case α = c?
Maurice [1964] and van Mill [1982] have given examples in ZFC of
compact homogeneous spaces containing c-many pairwise disjoint non-empty
open subsets.
The statement that every compact space X embeds as a retract into (a)
a homogeneous σ-compact space, and as a retract into (b) a homogeneous
p-compact space, raises the question whether these enveloping spaces may be
chosen even to be topological groups. In general the answer in each case is
No.
(a) In [1983] Tkachenko has shown that every σ-compact group is a ccc
space. In a slightly diﬀerent direction, Uspenski˘ı [1982] has shown
that if α ≥ω and the group G has the property that for every non-
empty open subset U of G there is A ⊆G such that |A| ≤α and G =
AU, then cG ≤2α; further, the upper bound cG = 2α is realized for
suitable G. The principal result of Tkachenko [1983] is generalized
in Uspenski˘ı [1985].
(b) Every p-compact group, since it is countably compact and hence pseu-
docompact and hence totally bounded (Comfort and Ross [1966]),
is a ccc space (being a subgroup of its Weil completion).
Question 1B.6.
Does every countably compact space embed as a retract
? 496.
into a countably compact homogeneous space?
The existence of Haar measure shows cG ≤ω for every compact group G,
and Tkachenko’s theorem from [1983] gives the same inequality for σ-
compact groups G.
The inequality cG ≤ω cannot be shown for Lindel¨of

groups, since there exist Lindel¨of groups G such that cG = ω+. To see this
it is enough to embed the 1-point Lindel¨oﬁcation (call it X) of the discrete
space ω+ into a topological group K which is a P-space, for then the sub-
group G = ⟨X⟩of K is a Lindel¨of group such that cG = ω+. (A theorem
of Noble [1971] is helpful here: The product of countably many Lindel¨of
P-spaces is Lindel¨of. In particular Xω, hence Xn for each n < ω, is a Lin-
del¨of space; thus the map x = ⟨x1, . . . xn⟩→x1 · . . . · xn from Xn to ⟨X⟩has
Lindel¨of image, so ⟨X⟩itself, the union of countably many Lindel¨of spaces,
is Lindel¨of.) The required embedding X ⊆K may be achieved as in Tka-
chenko [1983] by taking for K the free topological group over X. (The fact
that the free topological group over a P-space is itself a P-space is easily
established; Tkachenko [1983] cites Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1980, (6.9)] in this
connection.)
Alternatively, as suggested in conversation by Jan van Mill,
one may note that the P-space modiﬁcation K = P({0, 1}ω+) of the group
{0, 1}ω+ (deﬁned as in 2B below) contains a natural copy of X.
The following natural question is apparently unsolved.
Question 1B.7.
Is the relation cG ≤ω+ valid for every Lindel¨of topological 497. ?
group?
Of course, the theorem cited above from Uspenski˘ı [1982] answers 1B.7
aﬃrmatively in case CH is assumed.
Following Comfort and van Mill [1988], for subclasses U and V of G
and a space X, we say that a topological group G is a free (U, V)-group over
X if
(a) X is a subspace of G,
(b) G ∈U, and
(c) every continuous f: X →H with H ∈V extends uniquely to a con-
tinuous homomorphism ¯h: G →H.
It is shown in Comfort and van Mill [1988] that (a) there is a free
(PAG, PAG)-group over X if and only if X = ∅, and (b) for every space
X there is a free (PAG, CAG)-group over X in which X is closed. These
results suggest the following question.
Question 1B.8.
For what non-empty spaces X does there exist a free 498. ?
(CCAG, CCAG)-group over X? For some X? For all X?
Question 1B.9.
Does every countably compact space X admit a free 499. ?
(CCAG, CCAG)-group over X in which X is closed?
Evidently, 1B.9 is an “ambitious” question. An aﬃrmative answer would
answer 1A.2 and 1B.4(a) aﬃrmatively, and 1A.1 negatively.
For constructions related to the one just cited, and for helpful references to
the literature, the reader might consult Morris [1982, 1984].

Comfort / Topological Groups
[ch. 21
2. Proper Dense Subgroups
Some topological groups do, and some do not, have a proper dense subgroup.
In this section we discuss some of the relevant literature and cite some un-
solved problems. For a proof of some of the theorems we quote or use, and
for additional references, see Hewitt and Ross [1963] and Comfort [1984].
2A. The General Case
The relation |G| = 2wG holds for each inﬁnite topological group which is
either (a) compact or (b) σ-compact and locally compact and non-discrete,
so each such group admits a proper dense subgroup H (indeed, even with
|H| < |G|).
It is tempting to conjecture that every non-discrete, locally
compact group admits a proper dense subgroup, but in [1976] Rajagopalan
and Subrahmanian have described in detail a number of (divisible, Abelian)
counterexamples.
A topological group G is said to be totally bounded (by some authors: pre-
compact) if, for every non-empty open subset U of G, G is covered by a ﬁnite
number of translates of U. It is a theorem of Weil [1937] that a topological
group G is totally bounded if and only if G is a dense subgroup of a compact
group. When these conditions hold, the enveloping compact group is unique
in the obvious sense. It is denoted G and is called the Weil completion of
G. Since a locally compact, totally bounded group is compact, the groups of
Rajagopalan and Subrahmanian [1976] cannot be totally bounded. Ac-
cordingly one may ask whether every inﬁnite totally bounded group has a
proper dense subgroup, but this question also is excessively naive: When an
Abelian group G is given its largest totally bounded topological group topol-
ogy (as deﬁned in 3F below), the resulting topological group G# has the prop-
erty that every subgroup of G is closed in G#. Since w(G#) = 2(|G|) > |G|,
it then becomes proper to ask: Does every inﬁnite totally bounded Abelian
group G such that wG ≤|G| have a proper dense subgroup? For wG = ω,
anything can happen: For 1 ≤i ≤4 there are totally bounded Abelian groups
Gi such that wGi = |Gi| = ω, G1 and G2 are torsion groups, G3 and G4 are
torsion-free, G1 and G3 have proper, dense subgroups, and G2 and G4 have
none (Comfort and van Mill [19∞]). If G is a totally bounded Abelian
group such that |G/tG| ≥wG > ω (in particular, if G is torsion-free with
|G| ≥wG > ω) then G has a proper dense subgroup, but for every strong
limit cardinal α of countable coﬁnality there is a totally bounded Abelian
torsion group G such that wG = |G| = α and G has no proper dense sub-
group. These restrictions on α are not known to be essential, and the following
questions are left unsolved in Comfort and van Mill [19∞].
Question 2A.1.
Let α be an inﬁnite cardinal number. Are there totally
? 500.

§2]
Proper Dense Subgroups
327
bounded Abelian torsion groups G0 and G1 such that Gi has no proper dense
subgroup and
(a) w(G0) = |G0| = α?
(b) w(G1) = |G1| = 2<α?
What if α is assumed to be a (strong) limit cardinal?
2B. The Pseudocompact Case
For certain topological properties T, there exist topological groups G with T
(that is, G ∈TG) such that wG > ω and no proper dense subgroup of G
has T. (Among known examples of such classes T are the class of ω-bounded
groups and the class CCG of countably compact groups.)
What happens with respect to pseudocompactness? Every pseudocompact
metric space is compact, so the case G ∈PG with wG = ω has no interest.
When G is Abelian (that is, G ∈PAG) with wG = α > ω, it is known
that G has a proper dense pseudocompact subgroup provided either that G is
zero-dimensional (Comfort and Robertson [1988]) or that G is connected
and one of the following ﬁve conditions holds:
(i) wG ≤c;
(ii) |G| ≥αω;
(iii) α is a strong limit cardinal and cf(α) > ω;
(iv) |tG| > c;
(v) G is not divisible (Comfort and van Mill [1989]).
Several questions arise, the following being typical.
Question 2B.1.
Does every pseudocompact group G of uncountable weight 501. ?
have a proper dense pseudocompact subgroup? What if G is Abelian? Con-
nected and Abelian?
If a counterexample is sought, perhaps the most accessible candidate not
excluded by known results lies in the torus of dimension c+:
Question 2B.2.
Let G be a dense, pseudocompact subgroup of Tc+. Must 502. ?
G have a proper dense subgroup?
Concerning an inﬁnite compact group K with wK = α, two powerful and
remarkable statements are available:
(1) There is a continuous surjection f: {0, 1}α →K;
(2) there is a continuous surjection g: K →Iα.
Statement (1) is due to Ivanovski˘ı [1958] (the Abelian case) and Kuz′-
minov [1959] (the general case); see also Hewitt and Ross [1963, (9.15,
25.35)] and Uspenski˘ı [1985, 1988]. Statement (2) is due to Shapirovski˘ı
[1975, 1980]; see also Balcar and Franˇek [1982], Gerlits [1976, 1980,
1978/81] and Juh´asz [1980].
We note that (1) and (2) furnish very brief

328
Comfort / Topological Groups
[ch. 21
proofs of the useful identities |K| = 2α and dK = log α; the original proofs
of these results were achieved over a period of years, before (1) and (2) were
available, by direct arguments.
Now for a space X = (X, ℑ) let P(X) = (P(X), ℑ′) denote the set X with
the smallest topology ℑ′ such that ℑ′ ⊃ℑand every ℑ−Gδ-set is ℑ′-open.
That is, P(X) carries the P-space topology generated by the topology of X.
It is clear that for K ∈CG as above the continuous functions f: {0, 1}α →K
and g: K →Iα remain continuous when the spaces {0, 1}α, K and Iα are
replaced by P({0, 1}α), P(K) and P(Iα), respectively. Since the ﬁrst and
third of these spaces are homeomorphic, it follows that dP(K) = dP({0, 1}α).
(In fact all three of those P-spaces are homeomorphic; see Choban [1976] for
a proof.) Beginning with a dense subgroup D of K such that |D| = log α,
a routine induction over the countable ordinals yields a countably compact
subgroup G of K such that D ⊆G ⊆K and |G| ≤(log α)ω. Since for any
compact space X a dense, countably compact subspace of X is Gδ-dense in
X—i.e., is dense in P(X)—we have
log α = dK = d({0, 1}α) ≤dP({0, 1}α) = dP(K) ≤(log α)ω
(∗)
for every K ∈CG with wK = α ≥ω.
Question 2B.3.
Is dP({0, 1}α) = dP(K) = (log α)ω a theorem of ZFC?
? 503.
Question 2B.3, which together with (∗) is taken from Comfort and Ro-
bertson [1985], is a special case of a question raised in a very general context
by Cater, Erd˝os and Galvin in [1978]. As observed in this paper, the
singular cardinals hypothesis (κλ ≤2λ ·κ+ for all inﬁnite cardinals) is enough
to settle 2B.3 aﬃrmatively. Indeed for our limited purposes one needs only
(log α)ω ≤c · (log α)+.
For K as above, the cardinal dP(K) is the least cardinality of a dense
pseudocompact subgroup of K (Comfort and Robertson [1985]). Present
attempts to ﬁnd a compact group K with wK = α and a dense pseudocompact
subgroup G for which |G| = dP(K) < (log α)ω seem to fail because present
methods produce a group G which is perhaps “too large”—G is even countably
compact. We are led to this question.
Question 2B.4.
Let G be a dense pseudocompact subgroup of a compact
? 504.
group K. Must K contain a dense countably compact subgroup C such that
|C| ≤|G|? Can one choose C ⊃G?
3. Miscellaneous Problems
3A. The Structure of LCA Groups
As is well-known (see for example Hewitt and Ross [1980]), the group ˆG
of continuous homomorphisms from a locally compact Abelian group G to

§3]
Miscellaneous Problems
329
the circle group T is itself a locally compact Abelian group in the compact-
open topology. A locally compact Abelian group G is said to be self-dual
if the groups G and ˆG are topologically isomorphic. The self-dual torsion-
free locally compact Abelian groups which satisfy certain additional condi-
tions (e.g., metrizable or σ-compact) have been identiﬁed and classiﬁed by
Rajagopalan and Soundararajan in [1969].
(As is remarked by Ar-
macost [1981] and Ross [1968] the stronger result announced earlier (Ra-
jagopalan and Soundararajan [1967]) was overly optimistic.)
Shortly
thereafter, as Armacost writes in [1981, (4.37)]: “Corwin [1970] initiated a
new and interesting approach to the problem of classifying the self-dual LCA
groups.” In its full generality, the following question is apparently still open.
Question 3A.1.
Classify the self-dual locally compact Abelian groups.
505. ?
For a related investigation of “duality” in a (not necessarily Abelian) con-
text, see Mukhin [1985].
3B. Inﬁnite Compact Groups
I ﬁrst heard the following question from Kenneth A. Ross about 20 years ago.
I do not know if it remains open today.
Question 3B.1.
Does every inﬁnite compact group contain an inﬁnite 506. ?
Abelian subgroup?
In dealing with 3B.1 it is enough to consider groups in which every element
has ﬁnite order. It is natural then to consider the following question, which
also dates back at least 20 years (Hewitt and Ross [1970, (28.23(b)]) and
is apparently still open.
Question 3B.2.
Must a compact group in which each element has ﬁnite 507. ?
order have the property that the orders of its elements are bounded?
McMullen [1974] contributes to both 3B.1 and 3B.2, while Herfort
shows in [1979] that a compact group hypothesized as in 3B.2 is of bounded
order if and only if each of its Sylow subgroups is of bounded order.
It is perhaps worthwhile to remark that an elementary argument based on
the Baire category theorem answers 3B.2 aﬃrmatively in the case of Abelian
groups. Indeed, the compact Abelian torsion groups have been classiﬁed in
concrete form; see for example Hewitt and Ross [1963, (25.9)]. The Baire
category argument applies readily to Abelian torsion groups which are as-
sumed only to be pseudocompact; see Comfort and Robertson [1988, §7]
for a proof and an application.

3C. The Free Abelian Group
Let G denote the free Abelian group on c-many generators. According to
recent correspondence from Michael G. Tkachenko, the group G admits no
compact (Hausdorﬀ) topological group topology but, assuming CH, G does
admit a countably compact topological group topology; this latter may be
chosen hereditarily separable, hereditarily normal, connected and locally con-
nected. It is unknown whether this or a similar construction is available in
ZFC.
Question 3C.1. (M. G. Tkachenko (ZFC)) Can the free Abelian group on
? 508.
c-many generators be given a countably compact topological group topology?
3D. A Universal Topological Group
Responding to a question posed by A. V. Arkhangel′ski˘ı and leaning on an
idea of V. G. Pestov, Uspenski˘ı [1986] has shown that there is a separa-
ble metrizable topological group G which contains (up to topological iso-
morphism) every separable metrizable topological group. Indeed the group
Homeo(Iω) of homeomorphisms of the Hilbert cube into itself, in the topology
of uniform convergence, is a realization of such a group G; as a space, this G
is homeomorphic to sequential Hilbert space ℓ2.
It is unclear whether the method of Uspenski˘ı [1986] can be adapted to
higher cardinal numbers, and the following question remains unsettled.
Question 3D.1.
For what cardinal numbers α is there a topological group
? 509.
G(α) of weight α with this property: Every topological group of weight α is
topologically isomorphic to a subgroup of G(α)?
Even in the case α = ω, the Abelian version of the question answered by
Uspenski˘ı’s theorem remains open.
Question 3D.2. (Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1987, (Problem VI.14)]) For what car-
? 510.
dinals α is there an Abelian topological group G(α) of weight α with this
property: Every Abelian topological group of weight α is topologically iso-
morphic to a subgroup of G(α)? Is α = ω such a cardinal?
There are other contexts in which the Abelian version of a natural ques-
tion appears to be less tractable than the general case. As motivation for
question 3D.3 below, Sidney A. Morris points to the well known fact that
for 1 < n < ω the free group F(n) on n generators contains F(m) for all
m < ω—indeed, even for m = ω—while the free Abelian group FA(n) on
n generators contains FA(m) if and only if m ≤n. Now for a space X, let
F(X) and FA(X) denote respectively the free topological group, and the free

Miscellaneous Problems
331
Abelian topological group, over X. (In the terminology and notation preced-
ing Question 1B.8 above, F(X) is a free (G, G)-group over X, and FA(X)
is a free (AG, AG)-group over X.) Early constructions of the groups F(X)
and FA(X) or of closely related groups are given by Markov [1941, 1962],
Graev [1962, 1950], Nakayama [1943], Kakutani [1981] and Samuel [1948];
see also Thomas [1974]. The papers of Morris [1982, 1984] oﬀer new results
in several directions concerning free groups and related topics, and they con-
tain extensive bibliographies.
It is known (Nickolas [1976]) that the free topological group F(I) contains
(up to topological isomorphism) the group F(X) for every ﬁnite-dimensi- onal
compact metric space. Proceeding by analogy with the results cited above
concerning F(n) and FA(n), Morris has conjectured that the group FA(I)
contains FA(X) (for X compact metric) if and only if the dimension of X is
0 or 1. As an arresting special case, he proposes the following test question.
Question 3D.3. (Morris [1984]) Is FA(I×I) topologically isomorphic with 511. ?
a subgroup of FA(I)?
The negative answer to 3D.3 anticipated by Morris will strengthen the “only
if” part of his conjecture. For the proof of the existence of an embedding of
FA(T) into FA(I), and for other evidence supporting the “if” direction of the
conjecture, see Katz, Morris and Nickolas [1984].
3E. Epimorphisms
A continuous homomorphism h: H →G, with H and G topological groups, is
said to be an epimorphism if for every two continuous homomorphisms f and
g from G to a topological group, the equality f ◦h = g ◦h guarantees f = g.
Because of our standing restriction here to Hausdorﬀtopological groups, it is
obvious that every continuous homomorphism h: H →G with h[H] dense in
G is an epimorphism. It is an intriguing question, raised years ago by Karl H.
Hofmann and considered subsequently by many workers, whether the “dense
image” homomorphisms are the only epimorphisms. The question may be
phrased as follows.
Question 3E.1. (Hofmann) Given a proper closed subgroup H of a (Haus- 512. ?
dorﬀ) group G, must there exist a topological group K and continuous ho-
momorphisms f, g: G →K such that f ̸= g and f|H = g|H?
It is obvious that the answer to Question 3E.1 is “Yes” when G has a proper
closed normal subgroup N containing H (in particular, when G is Abelian);
in this case one may take K = G/N, f the canonical homomorphism and g
the trivial homomorphism.

332
Comfort / Topological Groups
[ch. 21
The answer to Question 3E.1 also is “Yes” when G and K are required
to belong to the class of compact groups (Poguntke [1970]) or to the class
of kω-groups (LaMartin [1977]). For these and additional results, and for
comprehensive bibliographical surveys of the literature, see Thomas [1973,
1977], LaMartin [1976, 1977] and Nummela [1978].
3F. The Finest Totally Bounded Topological Group Topology
When G is Abelian the group Hom(G, T) of homomorphisms from G to T
separates points and accordingly the evaluation function i: G →THom(G,T) in-
duces a (Tikhonov) topology on G; the group G with this topology is denoted
G#. The Abelian group G# is totally bounded, and every homomorphism
from G to a totally bounded topological group H is continuous as a function
from G# to H. In particular, the topology of G# is the ﬁnest topology for G
relative to which G is a totally bounded topological group.
The following three questions are taken from van Douwen [19∞a].
Question 3F.1.
For |G| > ω, is G# a normal topological space? Always?
? 513.
Sometimes? Never?
If X is a space such that |X| < 2ω, and if p, q ∈βX with p ̸= q, then p
and q are separated in βX by a complementary pair of open-and-closed sets.
(For, having chosen a continuous f: βX →I such that f(p) = 0 and f(q) = 1,
ﬁnd r ∈I \ f[X]. The set f −1([0, r]) is open-and-closed in X, so its closure
in βX is open-and-closed in βX.) It follows that every X with |X| < 2ω
is strongly zero-dimensional in the sense that βX is zero-dimensional. It is
known, further, see van Douwen [19∞a] and Comfort and Trigos [1988],
that the groups G# are zero-dimensional.
Question 3F.2.
For |G| ≥2ω, is G# strongly zero-dimensional?
? 514.
Perhaps the boldest of van Douwen’s questions is this.
Question 3F.3.
Does |G| determine G# up to homeomorphism?
? 515.
Now for a locally compact Abelian group G = ⟨G, ℑ⟩, let G+ denote the set
G with the topology induced by the set of ℑ-continuous homomorphisms from
G to T. (G+ may be viewed as G with the topology inherited from its Bohr
compactiﬁcation. This is the ﬁnest totally bounded topological group topology
for G coarser than the locally compact topology ℑ.) F. J. Trigos has noted that
if G and H are both locally compact Abelian groups such that G+ and H+ are
homeomorphic as spaces, then G and H are also homeomorphic. (This fact
follows easily from work of Glicksberg [1962]; see Trigos [19∞] for a direct

treatment.) This suggests the following extended version of van Douwen’s
question 3F.3.
Question 3F.4. (Trigos [19∞]) If G and H are locally compact Abelian 516. ?
groups which are homeomorphic as spaces, must G+ and H+ be homeomor-
phic?
3G. Markov’s Fifth Problem
One of the questions posed in Markov’s celebrated paper [1962] on free
topological groups is this: If G is a group in which each unconditionally closed
subgroup H satisﬁes |G/H| ≥2ω, must G admit a connected topological
group topology? (A subset X of G is said to be unconditionally closed if X
is closed in each (Hausdorﬀ) group topology for G.) The question intrigued
Markov as a potential characterization of groups which admit a connected
topological group topology: It is obvious that if H is a closed subgroup of
such a group G then, since the coset space G/H is a continuous image of G,
one has |G/H| ≥2ω.
Remaining open for over 40 years, Markov’s problem has been recently
solved in the negative by Pestov [1988] and, independently, by Remus [19∞].
Pestov’s construction proceeds through the theory of pre-norms, locally con-
vex topological linear spaces, semidirect products, and equicontinuous group
actions, while Remus’ construction is more simple and direct. (Remus uses
two facts: (a) For α ≥ω every proper subgroup H of the group S(α) of
permutations of α satisﬁes |S(α)/H| ≥α, and (b) every topological group
topology on groups of the form S(α) is totally disconnected.)
The examples of Pestov and Remus are non-Abelian, and according to
Remus the following variant of Markov’s problem remains open and is worthy
of investigation.
Question 3G.1.
(Remus [19∞], following Markov [1962]) Is there an 517. ?
Abelian group G, with no connected topological group topology, such that
every unconditionally closed subgroup H of G satisﬁes |G/H| ≥2ω?
3H. Compact Images
The following somewhat specialized question has been suggested by Michael G.
Tkachenko (letter of April, 1989).
Question 3H.1.
Suppose that α is an inﬁnite cardinal number and X is 518. ?
a compact space with wX ≤2α such that X is the continuous image of
a σ-compact topological group G. Does it follow that dX ≤α? What if
wX ≤α+?

Comfort / Topological Groups
[ch. 21
The question is appealing since the answer is “Yes” in case G is assumed
compact. Indeed in this case, since G is dyadic by the result of Vilenkin and
Kuz′minov, the space X is itself the continuous image of {0, 1}2α (which, by
the Hewitt-Marczewski-Pondiczery theorem, has density character less than
or equal to α).
3I. Minimal Topological Groups
It is an old question of Markov [1962] whether every inﬁnite group admits
a non-discrete topological group topology.
Assuming CH, Shelah [1980]
found a group of cardinality ω+ with no such topological group topology.
The deﬁnitive solution of Markov’s problem—that is, the proof in ZFC of
the existence of a countable group with no non-discrete topological group
topology—is given by A. Ju. Ol′shanski˘ı; an account of his construction is
given by Adian [1980, section 13.4]. For the groups of Shelah and Ol′shanski˘ı,
of course, the discrete topology is a minimal topological group topology (and
is not totally bounded).
It was for many years an unsolved problem, aggressively pursued by the
Bulgarian school of topology and ﬁnally settled aﬃrmatively by Prodanov
and Stojanov in [1984], whether every minimal topological group topology
on an Abelian group is totally bounded.
Earlier, in [1979], Dierolf and
Schwanengel had given an example of a non-Abelian group with a minimal
topological group topology which is not totally bounded, and in [1971/72]
Prodanov had shown that the group Q of rational numbers admits no topo-
logical group topology which is both totally bounded and minimal (among all
topological group topologies); it had been known for some years before the
appearance of Prodanov and Stojanov [1984] that every minimal topo-
logical group topology on a divisible Abelian group is totally bounded, and
in [1984] Dikranjan had characterized those divisible Abelian groups which
admit a minimal topological group topology.
For an inﬁnite cardinal α, let F(α) and FA(α) denote respectively the
free group, and the free Abelian group, on α-many generators. It is known
that each of the groups F(α) admits a minimal topological group topology
(Shakmatov [1985]), but there do exist in ZFC groups of the form FA(α)
with no minimal topological group topology. Indeed Stojanov [1981] has
shown that FA(α) has a minimal topological group topology if and only if α
is admissible in the sense that there is a sequence αn of cardinals such that

n<ω 2αn ≤α ≤
n<ω 2αn. (It is not diﬃcult to see that for every cardinal
number β there is an admissible cardinal α > β and there is a non-admissible
cardinal α > β.)
The following two questions are perhaps the remaining outstanding ques-
tions in the theory of minimal topological group topologies. The second of
these was brought to my attention by D. B. Shakhmatov.

Question 3I.1. (Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1987]) Is every Hausdorﬀgroup a quo- 519. ?
tient of a minimal group?
Question 3I.2. For each group G, let ℜ(G) denote the set of (Hausdorﬀ) 520. ?
topological group topologies, partially ordered by inclusion. Is it true for each
α that the partially ordered sets ℜ(F(α)) and ℜ(FA(α)) are non-isomorphic?
3J. Almost Periodicity
A topological group is said to be (a) maximally almost periodic (b) minimally
almost periodic if the continuous homomorphisms on G to compact groups
(a) separate points (b) are all constant. The existence of a minimally almost
periodic group is given by von Neumann in [1934, section 18]. For a proof
that the special linear group SL(2, c) is such a group, even in its discrete
topology, see von Neumann and Wigner [1940], and Comfort [1984, sec-
tion 9.8] for an expository treatment. Ajtai, Havas and Koml´os [1983] have
shown that every inﬁnite Abelian group admits a topological group topology
which is not maximally almost periodic, and Hewitt and Ross [1963, sec-
tion 23.32] describe in detail a number of topological vector spaces which
are minimally almost periodic Abelian groups. In [1988] Remus has shown
that every free Abelian group, and every divisible Abelian group, admits
a minimally almost periodic topological group topology.
In a preliminary
version of the present manuscript the question was posed, following Pro-
tasov [1984] and Remus [1988], whether every inﬁnite Abelian group admits
a minimally almost periodic topological group topology. I am indebted to
D. Remus for suggesting (letter of September, 1989) the following elementary
construction, showing that the answer to this very general question is “No.”
For an arbitrary inﬁnite cardinal α and for distinct prime numbers p and q
set G = (
α Z(p))×Z(q); here Z(p) = {t ∈T : tp = 1}. Now deﬁne h: G →T
by h(u, v) = v with u ∈
α Z(p), v ∈Z(q). Then h is a non-constant ho-
momorphism from G to the compact group Z(q), and h is continuous with
respect to any topological group topology ℑfor G since the kernel of h, which
is 
α Z(p) × {1}, is the kernel of the (necessarily ℑ-continuous function)
G →G given by x →xp. (We use here the fact that a homomorphism from
a topological group to a ﬁnite group is continuous if and only if its kernel is
closed.)
The argument just given shows that for every inﬁnite cardinal α there
is an Abelian group G of bounded order such that |G| = α and G admits
no minimally almost periodic topological group topology. With the general
question cited from Prodanov [1971/72] and Remus [1988] thus dispatched,
there remains this residue.
Question 3J.1. Does every Abelian group which is not of bounded order 521. ?

336
Comfort / Topological Groups
[ch. 21
admit a minimally almost periodic topological group topology? What about
the countable case?
3K. Unique Polish Topological Group Topology
It is a theorem of Kallman [1986] that for many (locally) compact metric
spaces X, including the Cantor set and the Hilbert cube, the group Homeo(X)
of homeomorphisms from X onto X admits a unique complete separable
metrizable topological group topology. The paper Kallman [1986] contains
a number of questions, both general and speciﬁc, related to this result; the
following is one of the former.
Question 3K.1. For what spaces X does the conclusion of Kallman’s theo-
? 522.
rem hold?
3L. Algebraic Structures Weaker Than Groups
At the annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society in Baltimore,
Maryland in December, 1953, A. D. Wallace [1955] noted that several au-
thors had advanced arguments suﬃcient to prove that a compact topological
semigroup with two-sided cancellation is a topological Group. (By deﬁnition,
a topological semigroup is a semigroup S with a topology relative to which
multiplication from S × S to S is continuous.) As to whether “compact” may
be legitimately weakened to “countably compact”, Wallace [1955] remarked
that despite “several published assertions . . . [the issue] remains in doubt”.
The question, known commonly as “Wallace’s question”, remains unsettled
today, 35 years later.
Question 3L.1.
Is every countably compact topological semigroup with
? 523.
two-sided cancellation a topological group?
According to Mukherjea and Tserpes [1972], the answer is aﬃrmative
for semigroups which in addition are assumed to be ﬁrst countable. The same
conclusion is given by Grant in [19∞] for cancellative semigroups which
are weakly ﬁrst countable in the sense of Nyikos [1981] (these are the can-
cellative semigroups which satisfy Arkhangel′ski˘ı’s gf-axiom of countability
Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1966]).
Several authors have considered conditions under which a group with a
topology relative to which multiplication from G×G to G is continuous must
be a topological group. (The Sorgenfrey line shows that the Lindel¨of property,
and the property of Baire, are inadequate to make inversion continuous.) The
best-known theorem in this circle of ideas is due to Ellis [1957b, 1957a]: It
is enough that the group be locally compact (and that multiplication be con-
tinuous in each variable Ellis [1957a]). Raghavan and Reilly [1978] have
collected and contributed several results of this type; see also Pfister [1985].

3M. Algebraic Structures Stronger Than Groups
For F a ﬁeld and ℑa topology for F, the pair ⟨F, ℑ⟩is a topological ring if
subtraction and multiplication are ℑ-continuous; and ⟨F, ℑ⟩is a topological
ﬁeld if multiplicative inversion is also continuous. Since the closure of {0} is an
ideal in F, every nontrivial ring topology for F is a Hausdorﬀtopology. Since
every nontrivial ring topology contains a nontrivial ﬁeld topology (Gelbaum,
Kalish and Olmsted [1951]), each minimal ring topology for F is a ﬁeld
topology.
A subset A of F is bounded if for every neighborhood U of 0 there is a
neighborhood V of 0 such that V A ⊆U; and F is locally bounded if 0 has
a bounded neighborhood.
It is a theorem achieved by Turyn [1951], by
Fleischer [1953b, 1953a], and by Kowalsky and D¨urbaum [1953] that
the topology ℑof a topological ﬁeld ⟨F, ℑ⟩is locally bounded and minimal
if and only if ℑis induced by an absolute value or by a non-Archimedian
valuation.
(A non-Archimedean valuation v on F is a function v from F
to an ordered group G with largest element ∞adjoined such that v(0) = ∞,
v(ab) = v(a)+v(b), and v(a+b) ≥min(v(a), v(b)) for all a, b ∈F; the topology
given by v has as a base at 0 all sets of the form Np(0) = {a ∈F : v(a) > p} for
p > 0, p ∈G. Versions of the theorem just cited are given in Wiec¸law [1988,
(Theorem 5.3.8)] and in Shell [19∞, (§16.5)].) In his extensive list of open
problems concerning topological ﬁelds, Wiec¸slaw [1988, Chapter 15] begins
with an “old problem”:
Question 3M.1.
Is there a minimal topological ﬁeld ⟨F, ℑ⟩such that ℑis 524. ?
not locally bounded? What about the case F = Q?
In view of the characterization of locally bounded minimal ﬁeld topologies
cited above, this question may be phrased as follows.
Question 3M.2. (Kowalsky [1954]) Is every minimal Hausdorﬀﬁeld topol- 525. ?
ogy on a (commutative) ﬁeld induced by an absolute value or by a non-
Archimedean valuation?
The analogous question for noncommutative ﬁelds has been answered in
the negative by Hartmann [1988].
For background on topological ﬁelds and the theory of valuations, the reader
may consult Jacobson [1980], Shell [19∞], or Wiec¸law [1988].
It is well known that every topological ﬁeld is either connected or totally dis-
connected. Among the latter, all known examples are in fact zero-dimensional.
This suggests the following natural question.
Question 3M.3. (Niel Shell) Is every totally disconnected topological ﬁeldF
526. ?

Domain theory is an area which has evolved from two separate impetuses.
The ﬁrst and most prominent has been denotational semantics of high-level
programming languages. It was the pioneering work of Dana Scott which led
to the discovery that algebraic lattices, and their generalization, continuous
lattices could be used to assign meanings to programs written in high-level
programming languages. When Gordon Plotkin pointed out the need for more
general objects to use as mathematical models, the notion of a domain was
formulated, and the structure theory of domains has been a focal point for
research in denotational semantics ever since.
On the purely mathematical side, research into the structure theory of
compact semilattices led Lawson and others to consider the category of those
compact semilattices which admit enough continuous semilattice morphisms
into the unit interval to separate the points. In an eﬀort to give a purely
algebraic description of these objects, Hofmann and Stralka were lead to the
deﬁnition of certain complete lattices, and it was soon noted that these objects
were precisely the continuous lattices of Scott. This occured in the mid-1970’s,
and a ﬂurry of research activity arose which culminated in the comprehensive
treatise Gierz, Hofmann, Keimel, Lawson, Mislove and Scott [1980],
hereafter called the Compendium. A more complete discussion of this facet is
provided in the Forward and Historical Notes of the Compendium.
Our goal here is to outline some of those areas where domain theory and
topology interact. This has been one of the central features of the theory,
since the most important topology on a domain—the Scott topology—has a
completely algebraic characterization. In fact, all of the topologies which are
useful for domains are determined by their algebraic structure.
Let (P, ≤) be a partially ordered set. A subset D of P is directed if given
x, y ∈P, there exists z ∈P such that x, y ≤z. The order on P is a directed
complete partial order if every directed subset of P has a least upper bound.
In this case we refer to P as a directed complete partially ordered set or DCPO
for short.
A signiﬁcant contribution of the theory of continuous partially ordered sets
has been the explicit deﬁnition and use of a new order relation, one that
sharpens the traditional notion of order.
Let P be a DCPO and x, y ∈P. We say x is way below y, written x ≪y, if
given a directed set D ⊆P such that y ≤sup D, then x ≤d for some d ∈D.
A partially ordered set P is a continuous DCPO if it is a DCPO and satisﬁes
y ∈P
⇒
y = sup{x : x ≪y} = sup ⇓y,
and the set on the right is directed. If P is simultaneously a complete lattice
and a continuous DCPO, then it is called a continuous lattice.
The most important structures in the theory of continuous DCPO’s from
the viewpoint of computer science have been what are usually referred to as
Scott domains.

[ch. 22
An element k ∈P is compact if k ≪k, i.e., if sup D ≥k for D directed,
then k ≤d for some d ∈D. A DCPO P is algebraic if every element is a
directed sup of compact elements. Alternately, algebraic DCPO’s are referred
to as domains. If a domain (i.e., an algebraic DCPO) is a complete lattice,
then it is called an algebraic lattice.
Note that algebraic DCPO’s are a special subclass of the class of continuous
DCPO’s. In an algebraic DCPO the relation ≪is characterized by x ≪y iﬀ
there exists a compact element k such that x ≤k ≤y.
The following are basic properties of the relation ≪in a continuous DCPO.
(1) a ≪b ⇒a ≤b
(2) a ≪d, b ≪d ⇒∃c such that a, b ≤c and c ≪d
(3) a ≤b ≪c ≤d ⇒a ≪d
(4) a ≪c ⇒∃b such that a ≪b ≪c
(5) ⊥≪a, where ⊥is the least element.
The fourth property plays a crucial role in the theory and is referred to as the
“interpolation” property. A continuous DCPO is said to be countably based
if there exists a countable subset B of P such that p ≪q in P implies there
exists b ∈B such that p ≪b ≪q.
When one is working in the context of algebraic DCPO’s, properties of
continuous DCPO’s can generally be given alternate characterizations in terms
of the partially ordered set of compact elements. For example, an algebraic
DCPO is countably based iﬀthe set of compact elements is countable.
1. Locally compact spaces and spectral theory
We consider an illustrative topological example of naturally occuring contin-
uous orders. The next results are mainly drawn from Hofmann and Law-
son [1978] or Chapter V of the Compendium.
Let X be a topological space, let O(X) denote the lattice of open sets
ordered by inclusion, and let U, V ∈O(X). Then U ≪V iﬀfor every open
cover of V , there is a ﬁnite subcollection that covers U. In this context it
seems appropriate to say that U is compact in V .
We say that X is core compact if given x ∈V ∈O(X), there exists U open,
x ∈U ⊆V , such that U is compact in V .
1.1. Theorem. X is core compact if and only if O(X) is a continuous lattice.
For Hausdorﬀspaces, the core compact spaces are precisely the locally com-
pact spaces. Core compactness appears to be the appropriate generalization
of local compactness to the non-Hausdorﬀsetting, in the sense that basic
mapping properties of locally compact spaces are retained in this setting. For
example, X is core compact iﬀ1X ×f: X ×Y →X ×Z is a quotient mapping
whenever f: Y →Z is a quotient mapping (Day and Kelly [1970]). Also

§1]
Locally compact spaces and spectral theory
353
appropriate modiﬁcations of the compact-open topology for function spaces
exist so that one gets an equivalence between [X×Y →Z] and [X →[Y →Z]]
if Y is core compact (see Chapter II of the Compendium, and for later de-
velopments, Schwarz and Weck [1985] or Lambrinos and Papadopou-
los [1985]). Of course this equivalence is closely related to the categorical
notion of Cartesian closedness, a topic to which we return at a later point.
The spectral theory of lattices seeks to represent a lattice as the lattice of
open sets of a topological space. However, the constructions are more intuitive
if one works with the lattice of closed sets. We take this approach initially,
and set everything on its head at a later stage.
Suppose that X is a T1-space, and let L be the lattice of closed subsets
of X (ordered by inclusion). We let ˆX denote the set of atoms in L (which
correspond to the singleton subsets of X) and topologize ˆX by deﬁning a
closed set to be all the atoms below a ﬁxed member of the lattice L, i.e.,
{ {x} : {x} ⊆A} where A is a closed subset of X. Then the mapping from X
to ˆX which sends an element to the corresponding singleton set is a home-
omorphism.
Thus X may be recovered (up to homeomorphism) from the
lattice of closed sets.
The situation becomes more complex (and more interesting) for a T0-
space X.
In this case we let an element of X correspond to the closure
of the corresponding singleton set in the lattice L of closed sets. The fact
that X is T0 is precisely the condition needed for this correspondence to be
one-to-one. But how does one distinguish in a lattice-theoretic way the closed
sets that arise in this fashion? One easily veriﬁes that sets that are closures
of points are irreducible, i.e., not the union of two strictly smaller closed sets.
We are thus led to deﬁne the cospectrum, Cospec(L), to be the set of coprime
elements (p is coprime if p ≤sup{x, y} implies p ≤x or p ≤y) equipped
with the hull-kernel topology with closed sets of the form hk(a) = {p ∈L : p
is coprime, p ≤a}, for a ∈L.
A space is sober if every irreducible closed set is the closure of a unique
point. In precisely this case the embedding of X into the cospectrum of the
closed sets is a homeomorphism.
For any topological space X, there is a
largest T0-space ˆX having the same lattice of closed (open) sets as X, called
the sobriﬁcation of X.
The sobriﬁcation of X can be obtained by taking
ˆX to be the cospectrum of the closed sets; X maps to the sobriﬁcation by
sending a point to its closure. It can be shown that a space is core compact
iﬀits sobriﬁcation is locally compact.
(A space is compact if every open
cover has a ﬁnite subcover, and locally compact if every (not necessarily open)
neighborhood of a point contains a compact neighborhood of that point.)
We now dualize the preceding notions to the lattice of open sets. An element
p ∈L, p ̸= 1 is prime (resp. irreducible) if x ∧y ≤p ⇒x ≤p or y ≤p (resp.
x ∧y = p ⇒x = p or y = p). It can be shown that the irreducible elements of
a continuous lattice order generate (i.e., every element is an inﬁmum of such

354
Lawson and Mislove / Domain Theory and Topology
[ch. 22
elements) and that the prime elements of a distributive continuous lattice
order generate.
If PRIME L denotes the set of prime elements of L, then the collection of
sets of the form PRIME L ∩↑x (where ↑x = {y : x ≤y}) for x ∈L forms
the closed sets for a topology on PRIME L, called the hull-kernel topology.
PRIME L equipped with the hull-kernel topology is called the spectrum of L,
and is denoted Spec L. The following theorem results by showing that the
spectrum is sober (which is always the case) and locally compact when L is
continuous.
1.2. Theorem. Given any continuous distributive lattice L, there exists a
(unique) locally compact sober space X namely the spectrum Spec L such
that L is order-isomorphic to O(X).
As a consequence of the preceding considerations there results a duality
between distributive continuous lattices and locally compact sober spaces.
2. The Scott Topology
A distinctive feature of the theory of continuous orders is that many of the
considerations are closely interlinked with topological and categorical ideas.
The result is that topological considerations and techniques are basic to sig-
niﬁcant portions of the theory.
The Scott topology is the topology arising from the convergence structure
given by D →x if D is a directed set with x ≤sup D. Thus a set A is Scott
closed if A = ↓A = {z : z ≤x for some x ∈A} and if D ⊆A is directed,
then sup D ∈A. Similarly U is Scott open if U = ↑U = {y : x ≤y for some
x ∈U} and sup D ∈U for a directed set D implies d ∈U for some d ∈D.
By means of the Scott topology one can pass back and forth between an
order-theoretic viewpoint and a topological viewpoint in the study of DCPO’s.
Generally order-theoretic properties have corresponding topological properties
and vice-versa. For example, continuous morphisms between DCPO’s may be
deﬁned either as those order preserving functions which also preserve sups of
directed sets or as those functions which are continuous with respect to the
Scott topologies.
2.1. Example. The Scott-open sets in R∗= [−∞, ∞] consist of open right
rays. For a topological space X, the set of Scott-continuous functions [X, R∗]
consists of the lower semicontinuous functions.
Suppose that a DCPO P is equipped with the Scott topology, so that
it is now a topological space.
Then the original order may be recovered
from the topological space as the order of specialization, which is deﬁned
by x ≤y iﬀx ∈{y}.
Note that any topological space has an order of
specialization, and that this order is a partial order precisely when the space
is T0.

The Scott Topology
355
There are useful alternate descriptions of the Scott topology for special
classes of DCPO’s. For a continuous DCPO P, let ⇑z = {x : z ≪x}. It
follows from the interpolation property that ⇑z is a Scott open set. That {⇑z :
z ∈P} forms a basis for the Scott topology follows from the fact that each
x ∈P is the directed supremum of ⇓x. It follows that a continuous DCPO
is countably based iﬀthe Scott topology has a countable base. Alternately
the Scott open ﬁlters also form a basis for the Scott topology in a continuous
DCPO.
For domains, a basis for the Scott open sets is given by all sets of the
form ↑z, where z is a compact element. The argument is analogous to the
continuously ordered case.
Problem. Characterize those DCPO’s
527. ?
(i) for which the Scott topology has a basis of open ﬁlters, and
(ii) for which the topology generated by the Scott open ﬁlters is T0.
Analogously, characterize those T0 topological spaces X for which the Scott
topology on the lattice O(X) of open sets satisﬁes (i) or (ii). (Both are true
in the ﬁrst case if the DCPO is continuous and in the second case if X if
core compact.)
Given a partially ordered set P, there are a host of topologies on P for
which the order of specialization agrees with the given order. The ﬁnest of
these is the Alexandroﬀdiscrete topology, in which every upper set is an open
set, and the coarsest of these is the weak topology, in which {↓x : x ∈P}
forms a subbasis for the closed sets. The Scott topology is the ﬁnest topology
giving back the original order with the additional property that directed sets
converge to their suprema. It is this wealth of topologies that makes the study
of DCPO’s from a topological viewpoint (as opposed to an order-theoretic
viewpoint) both richer and more complex.
What spaces arise by equipping continuous DCPO’s with the Scott topol-
ogy? In general, a continuous DCPO equipped with the Scott topology gives
rise to a locally compact, sober (T0-)space. (A base of compact neighbor-
hoods of x in this case is given by ↑z for all z ≪x.) Indeed, the lattice of
Scott-open sets in this case is a completely distributive lattice (a lattice is
completely distributive if arbitrary joins distribute over arbitrary meets and
vice-versa; these are a special class of distributive continuous lattices). Con-
versely the spectrum of a completely distributive lattice turns out to be a
continuous DCPO (with respect to the order of specialization) equipped with
the Scott topology. Hence another characterization of continuous DCPO’s
equipped with their Scott topologies is that they are the spectra of com-
pletely distributive lattices (see Lawson [1979] or Hofmann [1981a]). These
results were generalized to a class of DCPO’s called quasicontinuous posets
in Gierz, Hofmann and Stralka [1983].

the Scott topology (alternately the Scott open ﬁlter topology) is a continuous
lattice, i.e., characterize those DCPO’s that are core compact with respect to
the Scott topology. In the opposite direction, characterize those distributive
continuous lattices for which the spectrum is a DCPO equipped with the Scott
topology.
A result of Scott [1972] asserts that continuous lattices equipped with the
Scott topology are precisely the injective T0-spaces (any continuous function
from a subspace A of a T0-space X into L extends to a continuous function
on all of X). Thus these are a generalization to the non-Hausdorﬀsetting of
the absolute retracts of topology.

lute neighborhood retracts, i.e., those T0-spaces Y such that any continuous
function from a subspace A of a T0-space X into Y extends to a continuous
function on some neighborhood of A in X.
Retracts play an important role in the theory of continuous DCPO’s. We
consider some of their most basic properties.
Let P be a DCPO. An (internal) retraction is a continuous morphism
r: P →P such that r ◦r = r. It was Scott’s observation that a continuous
retract of a continuous lattice is again a continuous lattice (Scott [1972]),
and the proof carries over to continuous DCPO’s.
2.2. Proposition. Let P be a continuous DCPO and let r: P →P be a
retraction. Then r(P) is a continuous DCPO, and the inclusion j: r(P) →P
is continuous.
A DCPO A is a retract of a DCPO P if there exist continuous morphisms
r: P →A and j: A →P such that r ◦j = 1A. In this case the function r is
called an (external) retraction. Note that j ◦r is an internal retraction on P
and that j: A →j(A) is an order isomorphism. Thus the previous proposition
yields
2.3. Corollary. A retract of a continuous DCPO is a continuous DCPO.
A special type of (external) retraction is the projection, where in addition
to the preceding conditions we require that j ◦r ≤1P . In this case we write
P
r⇌Q. If r is a projection, then j is unique, is automatically continuous,
and is given by j(y) = inf{x : r(x) ≥y}.
Continuous DCPO’s have an alternate characterization in terms of their
ideal completions, namely a DCPO P is continuously ordered iﬀthe mapping
SUP: Id(P) →P is a projection. The continuous embedding j: P →Id(P) is
given by j(x) = ⇓x, which is the smallest ideal with supremum greater than
or equal to x.

§3]
Fixed Points
357
It follows that every continuously ordered set is the retract of a domain and
that the class of continuously ordered sets is the smallest class of DCPO’s that
contains the domains and is closed with respect to taking retracts.
There is an inclusion functor from the category of sober spaces into the
category of T0-spaces, and there is a functor from the category of T0-spaces
into the category of partially ordered sets which sends a space to the order
of specialization. Both of these functors have left adjoints. The adjoint func-
tor for the order of specialization functor equips a partially ordered set with
the Alexandroﬀdiscrete topology. The functor sending a space to its sobri-
ﬁcation is the adjoint of the inclusion of sober spaces into T0-spaces. The
composition of these two functors sends a partially ordered set to the sobri-
ﬁcation of the Alexandroﬀdiscrete topology, which turns out to be the ideal
completion equipped with the Scott topology. Thus the sobriﬁcation of the
Alexandroﬀdiscrete topology gives a topological analog of the ideal comple-
tion. The topological retracts of these sobriﬁed Alexandroﬀdiscrete spaces
are the retracts in our earlier sense and, as we have seen previously, are the
continous DCPO’s. (These results appear in Hofmann [1981b].)
Problem. Investigate those “varieties” of topological spaces that are gener- 530. ?
ated by a certain class of spaces by taking the smallest class closed under
retracts and products (e.g., the continuous lattices endowed with the Scott
topology make up the variety generated by the two element lattice endowed
with the Scott topology, sometimes called the Sierpi´nski space). When do all
members of the variety arise as a retract of a product of generating spaces?
What classes arise when one starts with a set of ﬁnite T0 spaces? In the latter
case is the variety generated Cartesian closed (see later sections)? Is it ﬁnitely
generated?
3. Fixed Points
If f: D →D is a self-map deﬁned on the domain D, then a ﬁxed point for f
is an element x ∈D satisfying f(x) = x. Because they provide a method
to assign meanings to recursive constructs, the existence of ﬁxed points for
a continuous self-map f: D →D deﬁned on a DCPO D is crucial for the
application of domain theory to the semantics of programming languages.
They can also be used to solve domain equations by considering domains of
domains (see Winskel and Larsen [1984]).
It was a basic result of Tarski’s that any monotone self-map f: L →L
deﬁned on a complete lattice L has a least ﬁxed point, and, in fact the set
Fix(f) of ﬁxed points of f is a complete lattice. For a DCPO, the least ﬁxed
point of a continuous map f: D →D exists, and is given by x = 
n≥0 f n(⊥),
where ⊥is the least element of D. Surprisingly, little attention has been paid
to the structure of the set Fix(f) of ﬁxed points of such a function f. Recently

in [1988] Huth has characterized the conditions under which the set Fix(f)
is a consistently complete domain (that is, a complete algebraic semilattice)
if D is, and in this case, the map x →(↑x ∩Fix(f)): D →Fix(f) is a
continuous retraction. The question is whether this result can be generalized.
Problem. For which classes of continuous DCPO’s D and continuous self-

maps f: D →D is the set Fix(f) a continuous DCPO? When this is the case,
is Fix(f) a retract of D? In particular, one might investigate certain classes to
be introduced latter such as strongly algebraic and ﬁnitely separated DCPO’s.
4. Function Spaces
A crucial and characteristic property of countably based continuous DCPO’s
is that they are closed under a wide variety of set-theoretic operations. This
allows one to carry along a recursive theory. Such constructions break down
in the category of sets because one obtains sets of larger cardinality. Also
one can employ these stability features of continuous DCPO’s to obtain ex-
amples which reproduce isomorphic copies of themselves under a variety of
set-theoretic operations. (This is essentially the idea of solving domain equa-
tions.) It is these features that provide strong motivation for moving from the
category of sets to some suitable category of domains or continuous DCPO’s.
One of the most basic constructs is that of a function space. If X and Y are
DCPO’s, then [X →Y ] denotes the set of continuous morphisms (the order
preserving functions which preserve suprema of directed sets) from X to Y .
For a directed family of continuous morphisms, the pointwise supremum is
again continuous. So the set [X →Y ] with the pointwise order is again a
DCPO.
For topological spaces X and Y let [X →Y ] denote the set of continuous
functions from X to Y .
If X or Y is a DCPO, then we identify it with
the topological space arising from the Scott topology. If Y is a DCPO, then
[X →Y ] is also a DCPO with respect to the pointwise order on functions.
One veriﬁes that the supremum of a directed family of continuous functions
is again continuous, so directed suprema are computed pointwise in [X →Y ].
If X and Y are both DCPO’s equipped with the Scott topology, then the
function space [X →Y ] is just the set of continuous morphisms of the previous
paragraph.
Suppose additionally that X is a continuous DCPO. Let f: X →Y be a
(not necessarily continuous) order preserving function. Then there exists a
largest continuous morphism f: X →Y which satisﬁes f ≤f; f is given
by f(x) = sup{f(z) : z ≪x}.
Thus if Y X denotes the set of all order-
preserving functions from X to Y , the mapping f →f from Y X to [X →Y ]
is a projection. If X is an algebraic DCPO, then f is the unique continuous
extension of the restriction of f to the set of compact elements K(X).

§4]
Function Spaces
359
Under what conditions will [X →Y ] be a continuous DCPO? Let us ﬁrst
consider the case that Y = 2, where 2 = {0, 1} denotes the two-element chain
with 0 < 1 equipped with the Scott topology. Then f: X →2 is continuous iﬀ
f is the characteristic function of an open set of X. Hence there is a natural
order isomorphism between O(X), the lattice of open sets, and [X →2]. Since
O(X) is a continuous lattice iﬀX is core compact, we conclude that the same
is true for [X →2].
More generally, let us suppose that X is core compact and that Y is a
continuous DCPO with least element ⊥. Let f ∈[X →Y ], a ∈X, and f(a) =
b. Let z ≪b. Pick U open in X containing a such that f(U) ⊆⇑z (which
we can do since f is Scott continuous). Pick V open with a ∈V such that
V ≪U. Deﬁne g ∈[X →Y ] by g(x) = z if x ∈V and g(x) = ⊥otherwise.
It is straightforward to verify that g ≪f in [X →Y ] (see Exercise II.4.20 in
the Compendium) and that f is the supremum of such functions. However,
one needs additional hypotheses on X and/or Y to be able to get a directed
set of such functions. If L is a continuous lattice, then one can take ﬁnite
suprema of such functions g and obtain the principal implication of
4.1. Theorem. Let L be a non-trivial DCPO equipped with the Scott topol-
ogy. Then [X →L] is a continuous lattice iﬀX is core compact and L is a
continuous lattice.
Problem. Suppose P is a DCPO endowed with the Scott topology. Charac- 532. ?
terize those P for which [X →P] is a continuous DCPO for all core compact
spaces X. A likely candidate is the class of continuous L-domains, that is,
all continuous DCPO’s P in which the principal ideals ↓x are all continuous
lattices. Does one get the same answer if one restricts to the core compact
spaces which are also compact?
It is frequently desirable to model the notion of self-application (we may
think of programs that act on other programs, including themselves, or pro-
gramming languages that incorporate the λ-calculus, where objects are also
functions and vice-versa). This involves building spaces X homeomorphic to
[X →X]. These can be constructed in suitable subcategories of continuously
ordered sets by using projective limit constructions, where the bonding maps
are projections. This was the original approach of Scott in [1972], where
the lattice 2ω was shown to satisfy this equation. It has also been shown that
any domain D ≃[D →D] must contain a copy of 2ω (cf., Mislove [1986]).
Problem. How extensive is the class of countably based spaces for which X is 533. ?
homeomorphic to [X →X]? One such model is 2ω, with the Scott topology.
Are other such spaces which are algebraic DCPO’s locally homeomorphic to
2ω? If not, are there natural restrictions that one can impose so that this is
the case. One might be led here to a theory of manifolds modelled on 2ω.

5. Cartesian Closedness
Let X, Y and Z be sets and let α: X × Y →Z. Deﬁne ˆα: X →[Y →Z]
by ˆα(x)(y) = α(x, y). Then the exponential (or currying) function EXY Z =
E: [X × Y →Z] →[X →[Y →Z]] sending α: X × Y →Z to the associated
function ˆα: X →[Y →Z] is a bijection (a type of exponential law).
In
general, we call a category Cartesian closed if products and function spaces
are again in the category and the exponential function is always a bijection.
This is a convenient property for constructions such as those in the preceding
section and for other purposes.
Note that E restricted to the category of DCPO’s and continuous mor-
phisms is still a bijection, for if X, Y and Z are all DCPO’s, then one veriﬁes
directly that α preserves directed sups if and only if ˆα does (where [Y →Z]
is given the pointwise order). Hence the category of DCPO’s and continuous
morphisms is also Cartesian closed.
Again things rapidly become more complicated when one moves to a topo-
logical viewpoint. First of all, one has to have a means of topologizing the
function spaces [Y →Z]. In this regard we recall certain basic notions from
topology (see e.g., Dugundji [1964, Chapter XII]).
A topology τ on [Y →Z] is splitting if for every space X, the continuity
of α: X × Y →Z implies that of the associated function ˆα: X →[Y →Z]τ
(where ˆα(x)(y) = α(x, y)). A topology τ on [Y →Z] is called admissible (or
conjoining) if for every space X, the continuity of ˆα: X →[Y →Z]τ implies
that of α: X × Y →Z. Thus for ﬁxed Y , Z we have that EXY Z is a bijection
for all X if and only if the topology τ on [Y →Z] is both splitting and
admissible.
We list some basic facts about splitting and admissible topologies. A topol-
ogy τ is admissible iﬀthe evaluation mapping ϵ: [X →Y ]τ × X →Y deﬁned
by ϵ(f, x) = f(x) is continuous. A topology larger than an admissible topol-
ogy is again admissible, and a topology smaller than a splitting topology is
again splitting. Any admissible topology is larger than any splitting topology,
and there is always a unique largest splitting topology. Thus a function space
can have at most one topology that is both admissible and splitting, and
such a topology is the largest splitting topology and the smallest admissible
topology.
A standard function space topology is the compact-open topology. We need
a slight modiﬁcation of this that is suitable for core compact spaces. Let X
and Y be spaces, let H be a Scott open set in the lattice O(X) of open sets
on X, and let V be an open subset of Y . We deﬁne the Isbell topology on
[X →Y ] by taking as a subbase for the open sets all sets of the form
N(H, V ) = {f ∈[X →Y ] : f −1(V ) ∈H}.
If X is locally compact, then the Isbell topology is just the compact-open

§5]
Cartesian Closedness
361
topology. The next theorem asserts that the core compact spaces are the ex-
ponentiable spaces (see Isbell [1975], Schwarz and Weck [1985] or Lam-
brinos and Papadopoulos [1985]).
5.1. Theorem. Let Y be a core compact space. Then for any space Z the
space [Y →Z] admits an (unique) admissible, splitting topology, the Isbell
topology, and with respect to this topology the exponential function EXY Z is
a bijection for all X.
What happens if Y is not core compact? Then results of Day and Kelly
[1970] show that the Scott topology on [Y →2] is not admissible, but it is
the inﬁmum of admissible topologies. Thus there is no smallest admissible
topology on [Y →2], hence no topology that is both admissible and splitting.
In this case there is no topology on [Y →Z] such that EXY Z is a bijection for
all X. Thus any category of topological spaces which contains 2, is closed with
respect to taking function spaces with respect to some appropriate topology,
and is Cartesian closed must be some subcategory of core compact spaces.
These considerations reduce the search for large Cartesian closed categories
in Top to the following central problem (to which we return at a later point):
Problem. Find the maximal subcategories of the category of core compact 534. ?
spaces which contain 2 and which are closed with respect to taking ﬁnite
products and function spaces equipped with the Isbell topology (since this is
the one that yields that the exponential function is a bijection).
Suppose now that Z is a DCPO equipped with the Scott topology. Then
[Y →Z] is again a DCPO, and one can investigate how the Scott and Isbell
topologies compare on [Y →Z]. A direct argument from the deﬁnition of
the Isbell topology yields that a directed set of functions converges to its
pointwise supremum in the Isbell topology, and hence the Isbell topology is
coarser than the Scott topology. Since we have seen that the Isbell topology is
an admissible topology if Y is core compact, it follows that the Scott topology
is also admissible.
In [1982] Gierz and Keimel have shown that if Y is
locally compact and Z is a continuous lattice, then the compact-open and
Scott topologies agree on [Y →Z]. Analogously Schwarz and Weck [1985]
have shown that if Y is core compact and Z is a continuous lattice, then the
Isbell topology agrees with the Scott topology on [Y →Z]. More general
recent results may be found in Lawson [1988].
Problem. Let X be a core compact space and let P be a DCPO equipped 535. ?
with the Scott topology. Under what conditions on P do the Isbell and Scott
topologies on [X →P] agree?
If Y is core compact and second countable (i.e., the topology has a countable
base) and if Z is also second countable, then [Y →Z] equipped with the Isbell

362
Lawson and Mislove / Domain Theory and Topology
[ch. 22
topology is second countable (see Lambrinos and Papadopoulos [1985,
Proposition 2.17]). Hence if Y is core compact and second countable (e.g., Y
is a countably based continuous DCPO), Z is a countably based continuous
DCPO, and [Y →Z] is a continuous DCPO on which the Scott and Isbell
topologies agree, then [Y →Z] is a countably based continuous DCPO (since
being countably based is equivalent to the second countability of the Scott
topology).
The category of locally compact Hausdorﬀspaces is not Cartesian closed
since function spaces are not back in the category. This deﬁciency can be
overcome by considering the category of Hausdorﬀk-spaces with k-products
and k-function spaces taken in that category. Here, a topological space X is
a k-space (sometimes also called compactly generated) if a subset U of X is
open if and only if U ∩K is open in K for every compact subset K. In the T0
setting, compactness is too weak of a notion to use to deﬁne k-spaces precisely
as in the Hausdorﬀsetting. There have been attempts to ﬁnd an appropriate
alternate notion of a k-space in the T0-setting, for example Hofmann and
Lawson [1984], but it is not clear that the deﬁnitive word has yet been spoken.
Problem. Is there a Cartesian closed category of sober spaces (with appropri-
? 536.
ately modiﬁed products and function spaces) which provides the appropriate
generalization of the category of k-spaces? Does this theory encompass all
DCPO’s so that they are endowed with some topology making them k-spaces
and the continuous function spaces between them are precisely the Scott con-
tinuous functions?
6. Strongly algebraic and ﬁnitely continuous DCPO’s
The category of ﬁnite partially ordered sets and order preserving functions is
Cartesian closed. The full subcategories with objects lattices or (meet) semi-
lattices are also Cartesian closed. One can extend these categories by taking
projective limits where the bonding mappings are projections. For the ﬁnite
lattices (resp. semilattices), one gets the algebraic lattices (resp. the algebraic
semilattices). For all ﬁnite partially ordered sets one obtains objects which
are called strongly algebraic DCPO’s. They form a larger Cartesian closed
category than the algebraic semilattices and were introduced by Plotkin
in [1976] to have a Cartesian closed category available where one could carry
out certain power domain constructions and remain in the category. The mor-
phisms in these categories (as earlier) are the Scott continuous morphisms,
and the function spaces are the DCPO’s arising from the pointwise order of
functions. In the section on supersober and compact ordered spaces we will
relate these function spaces to the topological considerations of the previous
section.
One can consider all retracts of strongly algebraic DCPO’s and obtain an
even larger Cartesian closed category. These objects have been called ﬁnitely

§6]
Strongly algebraic and ﬁnitely continuous DCPO’s
363
continuous DCPO’s by Kamimura and Tang and studied in several of their
papers (see in particular Kamimura and Tang [1986]) (an alternate termi-
nology for such DCPO’s is “biﬁnite”). A DCPO P is a ﬁnitely continuous
DCPO iﬀthere exists a directed family D of continuous functions from P
into P with supremum the identity function on P such that the f(P) is ﬁ-
nite for each f ∈D. The strongly algebraic DCPO’s are characterized by
requiring in addition that each member of D be a projection. We take these
characterizations for our working deﬁnition of these concepts.
Frequently
one’s attention is restricted to the countably based case. Here the the di-
rected family of functions, respectively, projections with ﬁnite range may be
replaced by an increasing sequence of functions.
A potentially larger class of DCPO’s that share many of the properties of
the ﬁnitely continuous ones has recently been introduced by Achim Jung.
6.1. Definition. Let D by a DCPO. A continuous function f: D →D is
ﬁnitely separated if there exists a ﬁnite set M ⊆D such that for all x ∈D,
there exists m ∈M such that f(x) ≤m ≤x. A DCPO D with least element
is called a ﬁnitely separated domain if there exists a directed collection of
ﬁnitely separated functions with supremum the identity map on D.
Problem. Give an internal description of a ﬁnitely continuous (ﬁnitely sep- 537. ?
arated) DCPO that one can apply directly to determine whether a given
continuous DCPO is ﬁnitely continuous. Find a topological description of the
spaces obtained by endowing a ﬁnitely continuous (ﬁnitely separated) DCPO
with the Scott topology. A ﬁnitely continuous DCPO is ﬁnitely separated.
Under what conditions does the reverse containment hold? (Currently one
lacks any counterexample to the reverse containment.)
We list some basic properties of ﬁnitely continuous DCPO’s (derived by
Kamimura and Tang) and ﬁnitely separated DCPO’s (derived by Jung).
6.2. Proposition.
(i) Continuous latticesand complete continuous semilattices are ﬁnitely
continuous DCPO’s.
(ii) A ﬁnitely continuous DCPO is ﬁnitely separated, and these in turn are
continuous.
(iii) A retract of a ﬁnitely continuous (ﬁnitely separated) DCPO is again a
ﬁnitely continuous (ﬁnitely separated) DCPO.
(iv) Let P and Q be ﬁnitely continuous (ﬁnitely separated) DCPO’s. Then
[P →Q] is a ﬁnitely continuous (ﬁnitely separated) DCPO.
It follows directly from the last proposition that the ﬁnitely continuous
and ﬁnitely separated DCPO’s form Cartesian closed subcategories of the
DCPO category. Alternately if they are viewed as topological spaces endowed

364
Lawson and Mislove / Domain Theory and Topology
[ch. 22
with the Scott topology, then they form a Cartesian closed subcategory of
topological spaces.
In [1976] Plotkin gave an alternate characterization of strongly algebraic
DCPO’s in terms of the partially ordered set of compact elements, which we
do not pursue here.
In [1983a] Smyth used these to derive the following
result:
6.3. Theorem. Let P be a countably based algebraic DCPO with ⊥. If
[P →P] is also an algebraic DCPO, then P is a strongly algebraic DCPO.
This theorem shows that the largest Cartesian closed full subcategory of
countably based algebraic DCPO’s consists of the strongly algebraic DCPO’s.
This result has been signiﬁcantly generalized by Jung [1988]. He has shown
that there are two maximal Cartesian closed categories of domains with ⊥,
those which are strongly algebraic and those for which each principal ideal ↓x
is a complete lattice (the L-domains). When one moves to domains in general,
then the strongly continuous and L-domains each split into two maximal
Cartesian closed categories so that one obtains four altogether. One expects
analogous results to carry over to ﬁnitely continuous DCPO’s, but only partial
results exist at this time.
Problem. Do the ﬁnitely separated DCPO’s which are countably based form

the largest Cartesian closed full subcategory contained in the category of
countably based continuous DCPO’s with least element?
Problem. Characterize the maximal Cartesian closed full subcategories of the

category of continuous DCPO’s. When these are viewed as spaces (equipped
with the Scott topology), are they maximal Cartesian closed full subcategories
of the category of topological spaces and continuous maps?
We remark that A. Jung has recently shown that the category of ﬁnitely
separated DCPO’s with largest and smallest elements forms the largest Carte-
sian closed full subcategory in the category of continuous DCPO’s with largest
and smallest elements.
7. Dual and patch topologies
An alternate topological approach (from domain theory) to the construction
of various semantic models has been via the theory of metric spaces (see
Lawvere [1973] for one of the pioneering eﬀorts in this direction).
One
may consult, for example, the articles of Kent, Smyth, America and Rutten,
and Reed and Roscoe in Main, Melton, Mislove and Schmidt [1988]
for recent examples of this approach and for attempts to ﬁnd comprehensive
theories that encompass both approaches. In this problem survey we have

§7]
Dual and patch topologies
365
made no attempt to list open problems arising from this approach. However,
we include a brief description of one way of interrelating the two approaches.
Suppose d: X × X →R+ satisﬁes the triangle inequality.
We use d to
generate a topology on X by declaring a set U open if for each x ∈U, there
exists a positive number r such that N(x; r) ⊆U, where N(x; r) = {y :
d(x, y) ≤r}. (This is slightly at variance with the usual approach, but allows
us momentarily a useful generalization.) Then d∗(x, y) = d(y, x) gives rise to
a dual topology.
7.1. Example. Deﬁne d: R × R →R+ by d(x, y) = max{0, x −y}. Then d
generates the Scott topology on R, d∗gives the reverse of the Scott topology
(the Scott topology on the order dual), and the join of the two topologies is
the usual topology.
The situation can be considerably generalized by considering functions sat-
isfying the triangle inequality into much more general semigroups than the
positive reals R+ (see e.g., Kopperman [19∞]).
In this case we need to
specify an ordered semigroup S and a subset of positive elements S+ for the
codomain of the “distance” function. Suppose that P is a continuous DCPO.
We set S equal to the power set of P with addition being the operation of
union. We let S+, the set of positive elements, be the coﬁnite subsets. We
deﬁne the metric d by d(x, y) =⇓x\↓y, and then deﬁne the open sets precisely
as in the earlier paragraph for real metrics. This metric is called the canonical
generalized metric for a continuous DCPO.
7.2. Proposition. The topology generated by d is the Scott topology.
Given a T0-topology, each open set is an upper set and each closed set is a
lower set with respect to the order of specialization x ≤y ⇔x ∈{y}. There
are topological methods (as opposed to the previous metric approach) for
creating “complementary” topologies from the given topology in which open
sets in the new complementary topology are now lower sets (with respect to
the original order of specialization). “Patch” topologies then arise as the join
of a topology and a complement.
One speciﬁc topological approach has been the following (see Hofmann
and Lawson [1978] or Smyth [1983b]). Let X be a T0-topological space.
A set is said to be saturated if it is the intersection of open sets (this is
equivalent to being an upper set in the order of specialization). One deﬁnes
the dual topology by taking as a subbasis for the closed sets all saturated
compact sets. The join of these two topologies is called the patch topology.
Problem. Characterize those topologies that arise as dual topologies. If one 540. ?
continues the process of taking duals, does the process terminate after ﬁnitely
many steps with topologies that are duals of each other?
For a partially ordered set P, the weak topology is deﬁned by taking as a
subbase for the closed sets all principal lower sets ↓x for x ∈P. The weakd

366
Lawson and Mislove / Domain Theory and Topology
[ch. 22
topology is deﬁned to be the weak topology on the dual of P, the set P with
the order reversed. All sets of the form ↑x form a subbasis for the closed sets
for the weakd topology.
7.3. Proposition. Let P be a continuous DCPO. Then the dual topology for
the canonical generalized metric and the dual topology for the Scott topology
both agree and both yield the weakd topology.
The λ-topology (or Lawson topology) on a DCPO is obtained by taking
the join of the Scott topology and the weakd topology. It follows from the
last proposition that if P is a continuous DCPO, then the λ-topology is the
patch topology deﬁned from the canonical generalized metric and it is also
the patch topology arising from the Scott topology. We refer the reader to
Lawson [1988] for this result and a majority of the following results on the
λ-topology.
The λ-topology on a continuous DCPO P is Hausdorﬀ, for if x ̸≤y, then
there exists z ≪x such that z ̸≤y, and ⇑z and P \ ↑z are disjoint neighbor-
hoods of x and y, respectively. Indeed the set ⇑z × P \ ↑z misses the graph
of the order relation ≤, so that the order relation is closed in P × P. Such
spaces (in which the order is closed) are called partially ordered spaces.
If P is an algebraic DCPO, then the λ-topology is generated by taking all
sets ↑x for compact elements x to be both open and closed. It follows that P
with the Lawson topology is a 0-dimensional space. Hence it is the continuous
(as opposed to the algebraic) DCPO’s that can give rise to continuum-like
properties with respect to the λ-topology.
If S is a complete semilattice, then one can take all complete subsemilattices
which are upper sets or lower sets as a subbase for the closed sets and again
obtain the λ-topology. If S is a continuous complete semilattice, then the λ-
topology is compact and Hausdorﬀ, the operation (x, y) →x∧y is continuous,
and each point of S has a basis of neighborhoods which are subsemilattices.
Conversely, if a semilattice admits a topology with these properties, then
the semilattice is a continuous complete semilattice and the topology is the
λ-topology (see the Compendium, VI.3).
7.4. Example. Let X be a compact Hausdorﬀspace and let L be the semi-
lattice of closed non-empty subsets ordered by reverse inclusion and with the
binary operation of union. Then X is a continuous complete semilattice, the
traditional Vietoris topology on L agrees with the λ-topology, and this is the
unique compact Hausdorﬀtopology on L for which the binary operation of
union is continuous.
Let L be a distributive continuous lattice. Then its spectrum is a locally
compact space, and it is known that the patch topology on the spectrum agrees
with the relative topology that the spectrum inherits from the λ-topology on
L. It is also known that the spectrum equipped with the patch topology is

a Baire space and hence a polish space in the case that L is countably based
(see the Compendium).
Problem. Investigate those topological spaces which arise as the spectra of 541. ?
distributive continuous lattices equipped with the patch topology. Is the class
of all complete separable metric spaces included?
If it could be ascertained that a large class of spaces arise from the preceding
construction, then the fact they arise from locally compact T0 spaces might
be quite useful in studying their structure. For example, they have a natural
compactiﬁcation, sometimes called the Fell compactiﬁcation, that arises by
taking the closure in the λ-topology in the lattice L in which they arose (see
the article of R.-E. Hoffmann [1982]).
Problem. Given a compact metric space X and a dense open subset U, is 542. ?
there a topology on U making it a core compact sober space such that the
metric topology on U is the patch topology and X is the Fell compactiﬁcation
?
8. Supersober and Compact Ordered Spaces
A compact supersober topological space X is one in which the set of limit
points of an ultraﬁlter is the closure of a unique point.
These spaces are
in particular sober and also turn out to be locally compact (and hence the
lattice of open sets is a continuous lattice). The patch topology on such a
space is compact and Hausdorﬀ, and the order of specialization is closed in
(X, patch) × (X, patch). Hence in a natural way a compact ordered space
results.
Conversely, if X is a compact ordered space, consider the space (X, U),
where U consists of all open upper sets. Then (X, U) is a compact supersober
space (with the set of limit points of an ultraﬁlter being the lower set of the
point to which the ultraﬁlter converged in the original topology). The dual
topology consists of all open lower sets, the patch topology is the original
topology, and the order of specialization is the original order (see VII.1 Exer-
cises in the Compendium for the preceding results). Specializing to DCPO’s
and the Scott topology, we obtain
8.1. Theorem. A DCPO P is compact supersober with respect to the Scott
topology iﬀthe λ-topology is compact. In this case P is a compact ordered
space with respect to the λ-topology.
We note that the order dual of a compact partially ordered space is another
such. Hence the topology consisting of the open lower sets is also a compact
supersober space with dual topology the open upper sets.

368
Lawson and Mislove / Domain Theory and Topology
[ch. 22
The preceding theorem quickly yields
8.2. Proposition. If the λ-topology is compact for a DCPO P, then the
same is true for any retract.
It was shown in the Compendium that a continuous lattice or continuous
complete semilattice is compact in the λ-topology.
This result extends to
ﬁnitely separated DCPO’s.
8.3. Proposition (Jung).
A ﬁnitely separated DCPO is compact in the
λ-topology.

is locally compact. Characterize those distributive continuous lattices L for
which Spec L with the patch topology is locally compact.

space, P is a continuous DCPO, and [X →P] is a continuous DCPO for
which the λ-topology is compact.
In this connection A. Jung has recently shown that if D and E are DCPO’s
with least element and if [D →D], [E →E], and [D →E] are continuous,
then either D is λ-compact or E is an L-domain.
9. Adjunctions
Let f +: P →Q and f −: Q →P be order-preserving functions between the
partially ordered sets P and Q. The pair (f +, f −) is called an adjunction if
∀x ∈P, ∀y ∈Q, y ≤f +(x) ⇔f −(y) ≤x. (Such pairs are also sometimes
referred to as Galois connections, but many authors prefer to deﬁne Galois
connections in terms of antitone functions.) Adjunctions can be alternately
characterized by the property that 1Q ≤f + ◦f −and 1P ≥f −◦f +. Hence
f + is called the upper adjoint and f −the lower adjoint. The mapping f −is
sometimes referred to as a residuated mapping.
The upper adjoint f + has the property that the inverse of a principal ﬁlter
↑q in Q is again a principal ﬁlter in P (indeed this property characterizes
mappings that arise as upper adjoints). Hence if P and Q are DCPO’s, then
f + is Scott continuous iﬀit is λ-continuous. If Q is a continuous DCPO, then
f + is Scott continuous iﬀf −preserves the relation ≪(see Exercise IV.1.29
in the Compendium).
Note that projections are upper adjoints (with the
lower adjoint being the inclusion mapping), and hence are continuous in the
λ-topology.
The preceding remarks show that the Scott continuous upper adjoints form
a good class of morphisms to consider if one is working with the λ-topology. If

§10]
Powerdomains
369
P and Q are both continuous lattices, then these mappings are precisely the λ-
continuous ∧-homomorphisms, which in turn are the mappings that preserve
inﬁma of non-empty sets and suprema of directed sets. As we have seen in the
previous paragraph, there results a dual category consisting of the same ob-
jects with morphisms the lower adjoints which preserve the relation ≪. If one
restricts to algebraic lattices, then the lower adjoint must preserve the com-
pact elements. Its restriction to the compact elements is a ∨-preserving and
⊥-preserving mapping. In this way one obtains the Hofmann-Mislove-Stralka
duality (Hofmann, Mislove and Stralka [1974]) between the category of
algebraic lattices with morphisms the Scott continuous upper adjoints and
the category of sup-semilattices with ⊥and morphisms preserving ⊥and the
∨-operation.
10. Powerdomains
A powerdomain is a DCPO together with extra algebraic structure for han-
dling nondeterministic values. Their consideration is motivated by the desire
to ﬁnd semantic models for nondeterministic phenomena. Examples are fre-
quently obtained by taking some appropriate subset of the power set of a given
DCPO P (hence the terminology “powerdomain”). We think of the subsets
as keeping track of the possible outcomes of a nondeterministic computation.
Again one is motivated to ﬁnd categories where powerdomain constructions
remain in the category.
We quickly overview some of the standard powerdomain constructions. If
P is a DCPO with ⊥, then one can construct the Hoare powerdomain as all
non-empty Scott closed subsets. If P is a continuous DCPO, then this set
is anti-isomorphic to the lattice of open sets, and hence forms a continuous
(indeed completely distributive) lattice. The Smyth powerdomain is obtained
by taking all the upper sets which are compact in the Scott topology. (We
refer to Smyth [1983b] for a nice topological development of these ideas in a
general setting.) In the case of a continuous DCPO for which the λ-topology
is compact, these are just the closed sets in the weakd topology, which is again
anti-isomorphic to the lattice of weakd open sets. We have seen previously
that in the case that the λ-topology is compact, this topology is compact
supersober, hence locally compact, and hence the lattice of open sets is con-
tinuous.
One of the most interesting of the powerdomain constructions is the so-
called Plotkin powerdomain. This again lends itself to nice description in the
case that D is a continuous DCPO for which the λ-topology is compact (which
we assume henceforth). It will also be convenient to assume certain basic
facts about compact partially ordered spaces (see the Compendium, VI.1]).
Let P(D) denote the set of all non-empty λ-closed order-convex subsets. If
A ∈P(D), then A is compact, and hence ↓A and ↑A are closed. Since A is

370
Lawson and Mislove / Domain Theory and Topology
[ch. 22
order convex, A = ↓A ∩↑A. Hence A ∈P(D) iﬀit is the intersection of a
closed upper set and closed lower set. We order P(D) with what is commonly
referred to as the Egli-Milner ordering: A ≤B ⇔A ⊆↓B and B ⊆↑A.
10.1. Theorem. (P(D), ≤) is a continuous DCPO for which the λ-topology
is compact, provided the same is true of D.
We remark that Plotkin introduced the strongly algebraic (countably based)
DCPO’s because the Plotkin powerdomain is another such (Plotkin [1976]).
The same is true for ﬁnitely continuous DCPO’s, as has been shown by
Kamimura and Tang in [1987].
To get the directed family of functions
which approximate the identity and have ﬁnite range on P(D) from those on
D, simply consider A →h

f(A)

for each f in the approximating family on D.
The same technique works to obtain projections if D is strongly algebraic, and
in the countably based case one obtains a sequence of functions.

1. Background
In computer graphics and image processing a scene is often represented as
an array of 0’s and 1’s. The set of 1’s represents the object or objects in
the scene and the set of 0’s represents the background. The array is usu-
ally two-dimensional, but three-dimensional image arrays are produced by
reconstruction from projections in applications such as computer tomography
and electron microscopy (see Rosenfeld and Kak [1982, Chapter 11]). The
array elements are called pixels in the 2D case and voxels in the 3D case.
We identify each array element with the lattice point in the plane or 3-space
whose coordinates are the array indices of the element. The lattice points that
correspond to array elements with value 1 are called black points and the other
lattice points are called white points.
Let S be the set of black points.
In pattern recognition one sometimes
wants to reduce the black point set to a “skeleton” S′ ⊆S with the property
that the inclusion of S′ in S is “topology-preserving”. This is called thinning.
Figure 1 shows what eﬀect a thinning algorithm might have on a digitized ‘6’.
In Figure 1 the large black dots represent points in S, and the boxed black
dots represent points in the skeleton S′ ⊆S.
In this paper we are mainly concerned with the requirement that a thinning
algorithm must preserve topology. However, it has to be pointed out that a
thinning algorithm must satisfy certain non-topological conditions as well.
(For example, the skeleton produced by thinning the digitized ‘6’ in Figure 1
must look like a ‘6’, which means that the ‘arm’ of the 6 must not be shortened
too much.) The non-topological requirements of thinning are hard to specify
precisely1 and are beyond the scope of this paper.
For n = 2 or 3 write En for n-dimensional Euclidean space and write Zn
for the set of lattice points in En.
2. Two-Dimensional Thinning
The topological requirements of two-dimensional thinning are well under-
stood. Let S ⊇S′ be ﬁnite subsets of Z2. In this section we deﬁne what
it means for the inclusion of S′ in S to preserve topology. In fact we shall
give three diﬀerent but equivalent deﬁnitions.
Given any set T ⊆Z2 we can construct a plane polyhedron C(T ) ⊆E2
from T as follows. For each unit lattice square K let C(T, K) denote the
convex hull of the corners of K that are in T . Let C(T ) be the union of
the sets C(T, K) for all unit lattice squares K. (See Figure 2.) Then one
satisfactory deﬁnition of topology preservation is:
1See Davies and Plummer [1981] for an approach to thinning which incorporates a deﬁ-
nition of the non-topological requirements. However, a possible drawback of that approach
is pointed out in Hilditch [1983, page 121].

Figure 2: An example of the polyhedron C(T ). The points in T are repre-
sented by the large black dots.
Although S and S′ are sets of lattice points, this deﬁnition involves con-
tinuous maps between polyhedra. We now give an alternative deﬁnition of
topology preservation that is equivalent to Deﬁnition 2.1 but is entirely dis-
crete. This second deﬁnition is more accessible to non-mathematicians than
Deﬁnition 2.1. It is also easier to use in proofs that proposed thinning algo-
rithms preserve topology2.
Two points in Z2 are said to be 8-adjacent if they are distinct and each
coordinate of one diﬀers from the corresponding coordinate of the other by
at most 1; two points in Z2 are 4-adjacent if they are 8-adjacent and diﬀer
in exactly one of their coordinates. For p in Z2 we write N(p) for the 3 by 3
neighborhood of p consisting of p and the points that are 8-adjacent to p.
We say a set of lattice points T is n-connected if T cannot be partitioned
into two (disjoint) subsets A and B such that no point in A is n-adjacent to
a point in B. Thus every 4-connected set is 8-connected, but an 8-connected
set need not be 4-connected. An n-component of a non-empty set of lattice
points T is a maximal n-connected subset of T — in other words, a non-empty
n-connected subset X of T such that no point in X is n-adjacent to a point
in T −X.
2For an example of such a proof see Stefanelli and Rosenfeld [1971].

Note that T is 8-connected if and only if C(T ) is connected. In fact, the
set of lattice points in each component of C(T ) is an 8-component of T , and
the set of lattice points in each component of of E2 −C(T ) is a 4-component
of Z2 −T .
The discrete deﬁnition of topology preservation is:
2.2. Alternative Definition. Suppose S′ ⊆S are ﬁnite subsets of Z2.
Then the inclusion of S′ in S preserves topology if each 8-component of S
contains just one 8-component of S′, and each 4-component of Z2−S′ contains
just one 4-component of Z2 −S.
There is another natural deﬁnition of topology preservation, which is anal-
ogous to Deﬁnition 2.1 but is based on collapsing3 rather than deformation
retraction:
2.3. Alternative Definition. Suppose S′ ⊆S are ﬁnite subsets of Z2.
Then the inclusion of S′ in S preserves topology if there is a geometric sim-
plicial complex KS with a subcomplex KS′ such that |KS| = C(S), |KS′| =
C(S′), and KS collapses to KS′.
Note that in this deﬁnition |KS| = C(S) and |KS′| = C(S′) indicate equal-
ity and not just homeomorphism.
It is not hard to show that the Deﬁnitions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are equivalent.
Perhaps the easiest way is to show that 2.1 ⇒2.2 ⇒2.3 ⇒2.1.
A point p in a set of lattice points T ⊆Z2 is called a simple point of T if the
inclusion of T −{p} in T preserves topology. This is an important concept in
the theory of image thinning4. One can determine whether or not a point p
in T is a simple point just by looking at N(p). In fact, if p ∈T then p is a
simple point of T if and only if p is 4-adjacent to at least one point in N(p)−T
and (N(p) −{p}) ∩T is non-empty and 8-connected.
The following proposition gives a fourth characterization of a topology pre-
serving inclusion. It is a special case of a result proved by Ronse in [1986].
2.4. Proposition. Suppose S′ ⊆S are ﬁnite subsets of Z2. Then the inclu-
sion of S′ in S preserves topology if and only if there exist sets S1, S2 . . . Sn
with S1 = S, Sn = S′ and, for 0 < i < n, Si+1 = Si −{pi} where pi is a
simple point of Si.
The “if” part of this proposition is clear. The more interesting “only if”
part is proved by showing that if the inclusion of S′ in S preserves topology
then S −S′ contains a simple point of S.
The concept of a simple point can be used to give a useful suﬃcient con-
dition for topology preservation by a parallel thinning algorithm (Rosen-
feld [1975]). A point in T ⊆Z2 with coordinates (x, y) is called a north bor-
der point of T if the point with coordinates (x, y + 1) is not in T .

2.5. Proposition. Suppose S′ ⊆S are ﬁnite subsets of Z2 and each point
in S −S′ is a simple north border point of S that is 8-adjacent to at least two
other points in S. Then the inclusion of S′ in S preserves topology.
Many 2D thinning algorithms consist of a number of passes, where each pass
deletes some black points, but from one side of the picture only. (Thus the
ﬁrst pass may delete only north border points, while the second pass deletes
only “south border” points etc.) If all the points deleted in each pass of such
an algorithm are simple points that are 8-adjacent to at least two other black
points, then Proposition 2.5 shows that the algorithm is topologically sound.
3. Three-Dimensional Thinning
We now consider three-dimensional generalizations of Deﬁnitions 2.1, 2.2
and 2.3.
It is easy to generalize the deﬁnition of C(T ) to three dimensions. If T ⊆Z3
then for each unit lattice cube K let C(T, K) denote the convex hull of the
corners of K that are in T . Let C(T ) be the union of the sets C(T, K) for all
unit lattice cubes K.
Say that S is deformable to S′ if the inclusion of of S′ in S preserves
topology in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.1:
3.1. Definition. Suppose S′ ⊆S ⊆Z3. Then S is deformable to S′ if C(S′)
is a deformation retract of C(S).
For plane polyhedra P and Q, Q is a deformation retract of P if and only if
E2 −P is a deformation retract of E2 −Q.
However, this is not true of
polyhedra in 3-space5.
So the following is another valid generalization of
Deﬁnition 2.1:
3.2. Definition. Suppose S′ ⊆S ⊆Z3. Then S′ is complement deformable
to S if E3 −C(S) is a deformation retract of E3 −C(S′).
We have seen (in Deﬁnition 2.2) that for sets of lattice points in the plane
one can give a discrete formulation of the concepts of deformability and com-
plement deformability (which are equivalent in the 2D case). It turns out that
this is also possible for sets of lattice points in 3-space.
Two points in Z3 are said to be 26-adjacent if they are distinct and each
coordinate of one diﬀers from the corresponding coordinate of the other by
at most 1; two points in Z3 are 6-adjacent if they are 26-adjacent and diﬀer
in exactly one of their coordinates. For p in Z3 we write N(p) for the 3 by
3 by 3 neighborhood of p consisting of p and the points that are 26-adjacent
to p.
5For a counterexample, let P be a solid torus and let Q be a knotted simple closed curve
in P that winds around the hole of P just once. By Proposition 3.4 the polyhedron Q is a
deformation retract of P , but E3 −P is not a deformation retract of E3 −Q.

[ch. 23
With the same deﬁnitions of n-connectedness and n-components as before,
the set of lattice points in each component of C(T ) is a 26-component of T ,
and the set of lattice points in each component of E3−C(T ) is a 6-component
of Z3 −T .
One can deﬁne a discrete analog of the fundamental group for a set of lat-
tice points T ⊆Z3 with one point p in T chosen as the base point. We call
this group the digital fundamental group of T with base point p, and denote
it by π(T, p). (See Kong [1989] for the deﬁnition of the group. In Kong,
Roscoe and Rosenfeld [19∞] its basic mathematical properties are estab-
lished. In these references, the group π(T, p) is denoted by π((Z3, 26, 6, T ), p).)
The digital fundamental group has the property that for each base point p
in T ⊆Z3 the inclusion of T in C(T ) induces an isomorphism of π(T, p)
to π1(C(T ), p), and for each base point q in Z3 −T the inclusion of Z3 −T
in E3 −C(T ) induces an isomorphism of π(Z3 −T, q) to π1(E3 −C(T ), q).
Here π1 denotes the ordinary fundamental group.
Discrete characterizations of deformability and complement deformability
can be given in terms of the digital fundamental group:
3.3. Proposition.
Suppose S′ ⊆S are ﬁnite subsets of Z3.
Then S is
deformable to S′ if and only if the following conditions all hold:
(1) each 26-component of S contains just one 26-component of S′
(2) each 6-component of Z3 −S′ contains just one 6-component of Z3 −S
(3) for all p in S′ the inclusion of S′ in S induces an isomorphism of π(S′, p)
to π(S, p)
There is an analogous discrete characterization of complement deformabil-
ity. The validity of these characterizations is a consequence of the following
recently discovered result in geometric topology:
3.4. Proposition (C. Gordon, private communication, May 1989). Suppose
Q ⊆P ⊆E3, where both P and Q are ﬁnite polyhedra or both E3 −P
and E3 −Q are ﬁnite polyhedra. Then Q is a deformation retract of P if and
only if the following conditions all hold:
(1) each component of P contains just one component of Q
(2) each component of E3 −Q contains just one component of E3 −P
(3) for each point q in Q the inclusion of Q in P induces an isomorphism
of π1(Q, q) to π1(P, q)
One could call a 3D thinning algorithm topologically sound if the input
black point set is always deformable to the skeleton, and the skeleton is always
complement deformable to the input black point set. But from a theoretical
viewpoint such a deﬁnition would arguably be too weak6.
6For example, if S′ ⊆S ⊆
3 are any sets such that C(S) is a solid torus and C(S′) is
an unknotted simple closed curve that winds around the hole of the torus just once then
S is deformable to S′ and S′ is complement deformable to S — regardless of how C(S′)
may be linked with the hole of the torus.

§4]
Open Problems
383
A deﬁnition of topology preservation based on Deﬁnition 2.3 may be more
appropriate. Say that S is collapsible to S′ if the inclusion of S′ in S preserves
topology in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.3:
3.5. Definition. Suppose S′ ⊆S ⊆Z3. Then S is collapsible to S′ if there is
a geometric simplicial complex KS with a subcomplex KS′ such that |KS| =
C(S), |KS′| = C(S′), and KS collapses to KS′.
If S is collapsible to S′ then S is deformable to S′ and S′ is complement
deformable to S. The converse is true in the plane (as we have seen) but not
in 3-space7.
However, it turns out that if p ∈T ⊆Z3 then T is collapsible to T −{p}
if and only if T is deformable to T −{p}. (For a proof, see Kong [1985,
Chapter 4].) This result suggests a natural generalization of the concept of a
simple point to three dimensions:
3.6. Definition. A point p in T ⊆Z3 with the property that T is deformable
(and hence collapsible) to T −{p} is called a simple point of T .
As in the 2D case, one can determine whether or not a point p in T is a
simple point just by looking at the points in its neighborhood N(p). (See
Kong and Rosenfeld [1989, section 9].)
4. Open Problems
Is there a discrete characterization of collapsibility? The following conjecture,
if true, would provide just such a characterization:
Conjecture 1. Suppose S′ ⊆S are ﬁnite subsets of Z3 and S is collapsi- 545. ?
ble to S′. Then there are sets S1, S2 . . . Sn with S1 = S, Sn = S′ and, for
0 < i < n, Si+1 = Si −{pi} where pi is a simple point of Si.
Note that this conjecture is certainly true in the 2D case, by Proposition 2.4.
The problem of deﬁning topology preservation in 3D thinning was ﬁrst con-
sidered by Morgenthaler [1981]. He used a discrete approach, which leads
to a deﬁnition of topology preservation that is quite similar to the discrete
characterization of deformability given in Proposition 3.3. But the deﬁnition
may also be stated in continuous terms as follows:
4.1. Definition. Suppose S′ ⊆S are ﬁnite subsets of Z3. Then the inclusion
of S′ in S is topology preserving in the sense of Morgenthaler if the following
conditions hold:
(1) each component of E3−C(S′) contains just one component of E3−C(S)
7For a counterexample, let S be such that C(S) is an embedding of the dunce hat
(see Maunder [1980, page 352]) in E3, and S′ consists of a single point in S. Then S is
deformable to S′ and S′ is complement deformable to S, but S is not collapsible to S′.

Kong et al / Binary Digital Images
[ch. 23
(2) the inclusion of S′ in S induces a bijection of the free homotopy classes
of loops in C(S′) to the free homotopy classes of loops in C(S)
If S is deformable to S′ then the inclusion of S′ in S preserves topology in
the sense of Morgenthaler. Is the converse true? To establish the converse, it
would suﬃce to prove the following conjecture, which may be regarded as a
strengthened version of Proposition 3.4:
Conjecture 2. Suppose P ⊇Q are ﬁnite polyhedra in 3-space such that each
? 546.
component of E3 −Q contains just one component of E3 −P, and such that
the inclusion of Q in P induces a bijection of the free homotopy classes of loops
in Q to the free homotopy classes of loops in P. Then Q is a deformation
retract of P.
Finally, here is an open-ended problem whose solution could provide a useful
tool for verifying the topological soundness of a large class of 3D parallel
thinning algorithms:

1. Introduction
In this paper we present a uniform method to show the relationship be-
tween two well-known methods of assigning meaning to programming lan-
guages in which both recursion and concurrency—for simplicity in the sense
of interleaving—are expressible. These two methods are called denotational
and operational semantics.
Denotational semantics associates with each expression in the language an
element of a semantical domain, a denotation, in a compositional or homo-
morphic way, i.e., the meaning of an expression is a combination of the mean-
ings of its proper subexpressions. Moreover, ﬁxed point techniques are used
to handle recursion. Operational semantics, on the other hand, is assigning
meaning to an expression of the language in an entirely diﬀerent way. A so-
called transition system models the computation steps of an abstract machine
that is to execute the programs of the language. The operational semantics of
an expression then, is the collection of observable behaviours of this abstract
machine running the expression. From this brief description of denotational
and operational semantics, it may be clear that these two semantical methods
are totally diﬀerent in nature.
When for a particular language both an operational and a denotational se-
mantics are deﬁned, it is, of course, a natural question how these are related.
Since the operational semantics refers to a notion of computability via an
abstract machine, it is assumed to embody the actual behaviour of the state-
ments in the language, and therefore it is often considered as the more basic
semantics in the sense that it can (or even must) be used as a yard-stick to
‘measure’ the adequacy of the denotational semantics that is proposed. So, in
this view, establishing a relationship between the operational and denotational
model obtains the nature of a test of justiﬁability or correctness of the deno-
tational semantics. Ideally the operational and denotational meanings should
coincide, i.e., O = D. However, the requirement of denotational semantics to
be compositional often enforces the denotations to be more informative (and
hence more complicated) than the result of an operational semantics. If so,
we want to have O = α ◦D for some suitable abstraction operator α. This
is especially the case in the context of languages with concurrency operators
involving synchronisation.
Often the relationship between O and D must be obtained via hard tech-
nical work in an ad hoc fashion, not unlike the way in which completeness
proofs of logical systems are obtained. In this paper we propose a general
technique which, as we believe, can be used for many diﬀerent languages with
recursion. The idea is to introduce an intermediate semantics I, which is
very similar to the operational semantics, in that it is also based on transition
systems. However, now every conﬁguration—representing a state of the ab-
stract machine—is provided with information w.r.t. recursion. Indices which

accompany statements indicate their calling level. The intermediate seman-
tics can be represented as a least upper bound of a chain of approximations.
The n-th approximation is induced by the same transition systems but now
restricted to those conﬁgurations with indices less than or equal to n. The
approximations will improve by allowing a higher nesting of calls. As can be
seen by continuity arguments, the denotational semantics D is also a least
upper bound of chains of approximations. The equality of I and D will fol-
low from the equality—for each n—of the n-th approximation of I and D,
respectively.
We shall illustrate the method for a very simple basic language with—
besides recursion—operators for sequential, nondeterministic and parallel com-
position, where the last one is to be interpreted as an interleaving or shuﬄe
operator, i.e., the execution of its arguments progresses alternatively and not
simultaneously.
Finally, we remark that in both our denotational model and our relating
technique we introduce elementary order theoretical notions inspired by metric
topology, thus showing a fruitful application of this area of mathematics in a
perhaps somewhat unexpected ﬁeld.
This paper is organised as follows: §2 provides some mathematical pre-
liminaries concerning domains, operators and transition systems. In §3 we
introduce the sample programming language and provide an operational se-
mantics for it. §4 contains a denotational deﬁnition. In §5 we present our
equivalence result by introducing an intermediate model.
2. Mathematical Preliminaries
In this section we collect the mathematical prerequisites for the construction
and equivalence of the several semantical deﬁnitions in this paper.
To start with we appoint the mathematical structure compelling enough
coherence to serve as a domain of denotations. This is the notion of complete
partial order, which is generally used in the area of semantics of program-
ming languages. See e.g., Plotkin [1976], Stoy [1977], Brookes, Hoare
and Roscoe [1984].
We will present the slightly simpler notion of an ω-
complete partial order, ω-cpo for short, which already serves our purposes,
cf. de Bakker [1980]. The ordering will be interpreted as an approximation
relation between partial and total meanings. The ω-completeness captures a
notion of computability. Morphisms between ω-cpos are the so-called contin-
uous mappings. The main tool for making ﬁxed point constructions in this
context is known as (a simpliﬁed version of) the Knaster-Tarski theorem. See
Tarski [1955].
2.1. Definition.
(i) An ω-cpo is a partial order (D, ≤) which has a least element ⊥D and
in which every ω-chain ⟨xi⟩i has a least upper bound lubi xi.

§2]
Mathematical Preliminaries
391
(ii) Let D, E be ω-cpos. A mapping f: D →E is called continuous iﬀ
f is monotonic and moreover, for each chain ⟨xi⟩i in D it holds that
f(lubi xi) = lubi f(xi).
2.2. Theorem (Knaster-Tarski). Let D be an ω-cpo. Suppose f: D →D is
continuous. Then f has a least ﬁxed point µf. Moreover, µf = lubif i(⊥).
Proof. See de Bakker [1980].
To specify the objects in the semantical domain slightly more already we in-
troduce streams in the sense of Back [1983], Broy [1986] and Meyer [1985].
Streams are ﬁnite or inﬁnite sequences of (abstract) actions, possibly ending
in a distinguished marker ⊥(indicating that this stream is not completed yet).
A streams represents just one computation sequence. In order to deal with
the nondeterminism that will be incorporated in our programming language,
we have to resort to certain sets of streams, to a so-called powerdomain. Cf.
Plotkin [1976], Smyth [1978]. (On powerdomain constructions or more gen-
erally the solution of reﬂexive domain equations a vast amount of research on
the border line of mathematics and computer science has emerged. See e.g.,
de Bakker and Zucker [1982], Main [1987], Lawson [1988], America and
Rutten [1988].) Here we will follow the more concrete approach of Meyer
and de Vink [1988] that is more suitable to the type of denotational model
employed in this paper because of the availability of the extension and lifting
lemma for the construction of semantical operators.
2.3. Definition.
(i) Let A be a set. Distinguish ⊥̸∈A.The set of streams Ast over A is given
by Ast = A∗∪A∗. ⊥∪Aω. For x ∈Ast and n ∈N we deﬁne x[n] ∈Ast
as follows: x[0] =⊥, ⊥[n + 1] =⊥, ϵ[n + 1] = ϵ and (a.x′)[n + 1] =
a.(x′[n]). We stipulate x[∞] = x. The stream ordering ≤st on Ast is
deﬁned as follows: x ≤st y ⇔∃α ∈N∞: x = y[α], with N∞= N∪{∞}.
(ii) Let X ⊆Ast. X is ﬂat if ¬(x <st x′) whenever x, x′ ∈X. X[n] =
{x[n]|x ∈X}.
X is closed if for every x ∈Ast, x ∈X whenever
x[n] ∈X[n] for all n ∈N. X is bounded if X[n] is ﬁnite for all n ∈N.
X is compact if X is ﬂat, closed and bounded.
(iii) Let P∗(Ast) denote the collection of all compact subsets of Ast. The
Smyth-ordering ≤S on P∗(Ast) is deﬁned by X ≤S Y ⇔∀y ∈Y ∃x ∈
X: x ≤st y.
2.4. Theorem.
(i) (P∗(Ast), ≤S) is an ω-cpo.
(ii) (Extension Lemma) Put Af = A∗∪A∗.⊥. Let D be an ω-cpo. Suppose
f: (Af)k →D is monotonic. Then ¯f: (Ast)k →D deﬁned by ¯f(⃗x) =
lubif(⃗x[i]) is well-deﬁned and continuous.

392
Meyer and de Vink / Semantics
[ch. 24
(iii) (Lifting Lemma) If f: (Ast)k →P∗(Ast) is continuous and
F: (P∗(Ast))k →P∗(Ast)
is given by F(⃗x) = min({f(⃗x)|⃗x ∈⃗X}), then F is well-deﬁned and
continuous.
Proof. See Meyer and de Vink [1988].
Next we will give the deﬁnition of a transition system that will be used to
deﬁne the operational semantics presented in the next section. Intuitively,
transition systems describe the behaviours of abstract machines. Here a tran-
sition system is just a relation of type C ×L×C where C and L are arbitrary
sets (of conﬁgurations and labels, respectively). So a transition is a triple, say
(c, l, c′), representing a computation step from a source conﬁguration c to a
target conﬁguration c′ with observable activity l. For a transition system we
will require that from an arbitrary conﬁguration ﬁnitely many conﬁgurations
can be reached in one step involving ﬁnitely many labels. (Hence we consider
ourselves in a situation of bounded nondeterminism, i.e., at any moment there
are only ﬁnitely many alternatives.)
Sequences of transitions will be called computations. What can be observed
from all maximal computations starting from an initial conﬁguration c w.r.t.
a transition system t constitutes the so-called yield of t for c. We shall ﬁnd it
convenient to have available a characterisation of this yield function in terms
of a ﬁxed point construction.
In §5, where the equivalence of the operational and denotational semantics
of the particular programming language is addressed we will consider com-
putations that only involve source conﬁgurations of a certain type. Such a
restriction to a subclass of conﬁgurations induces derived notions of compu-
tation and yield. We observe that this restriction is a continuous operation
from the cpo of subsets of conﬁgurations (ordered by set-inclusion) into the
cpo of compact stream sets over labels.
2.5. Definition.
(i) Fix two sets C and L, the elements of which are called conﬁgurations
and labels, respectively. A subset t ⊆C × L × C is called a transition
system over C and L if #{(˜c, l, ˜c′) ∈t|˜c = c} < ∞whenever c ∈C.
T S(C, L) denotes the collection of all transition systems over C and L.
(ii) For t ∈T S(C, L) we deﬁne the set ICt of intermediate conﬁgurations
by ICt = {c ∈C|(∃l ∈L)(∃c′ ∈C) : (c, l, c′) ∈t} and the set FCt
of ﬁnal conﬁgurations by FCt = C \ ICt. We often write c
ℓ→t c′ if
(c, l, c′) ∈t.
(iii) Let t ∈T S(C, L).
A t-computation γ for c is a sequence of pairs
⟨ℓi, ci⟩i∈I such that I is an initial segment of N+ = N\{0} and ∀i ∈I :
ci−1
ℓi→t ci, where c0 = c. lgt(γ) denotes the length of the computation

γ; we put lgt(γ) = #I ∈N∞. We say that γ is ﬁnished, if lgt(γ) is ﬁnite
and clgt(γ) is a ﬁnal conﬁguration. We then deﬁne the yield of γ by
yld(γ) = ℓ1 · · · ℓlgt(γ) ∈L∗. If lgt(γ) is ﬁnite but clgt(γ) is non-ﬁnal, we
call γ unﬁnished and put yld(γ) = ℓ1 · · · ℓlgt(γ). ⊥∈L∗. ⊥. We say that
γ is inﬁnite if lgt(γ) = ∞. In this case we put yld(γ) = ℓ1ℓ2 · · · ∈Lω.
(iv) For c ∈C we deﬁne compt(c) = {γ|γ is a ﬁnished or is an inﬁnite t-
computation for c} Deﬁne the mapping yldt: C →P∗(Lst), called the
yield of t, by yldt(c) = {yld(γ)|γ ∈compt(c)}.
(v) Deﬁne the valuation function φt: C →P∗(Lst) of the transition system
t as the least ﬁxed point of Φt, where Φt ∈Map(C →P∗(Lst)), the
function space of mappings from C →P∗(Lst) to C →P∗(Lst), is
given by Φt(φ)(c) = {ϵ} if c ∈FCt, Φt(φ)(c) = min(∪{ℓ.φ(c′)|c
ℓ
→t
c′}) if c ∈ICt.
2.6. Lemma. Let t ∈T S(C, L). Then yldt = φt.
Proof. Fix t ∈T S(C, L). Note that yldt: C →P∗(Lst) is well-deﬁned. For
if c ∈C then the yield for c under t, yldt(c), is ﬂat, since yldt(c) ⊆L∗∪Lω.
Also, for all ¯c there exist only ﬁnitely many transitions ¯c
ℓ→t ¯c′, hence yldt(c)
is bounded. Moreover, by K¨onig’s Lemma it follows that yldt(c) is closed.
The well-deﬁnedness of φt relies on the continuity of ﬁnite sums in P∗(Lst)
and is left to the reader.
Put φt,0 = λ c.{⊥}, φt,n+1 = Φt(φt,n). Deﬁne yldt,n = λ c.yldt(c)[n]. We
prove by induction on n: yldt,n = φt,n. From this it follows by theorem 2.2
that yldt = lubn yldt,n = lubn φt,n = φt.
Clearly yldt,0 = φt,0, for yldt(c) is a non-empty set, since every conﬁgu-
ration admits a ﬁnished or inﬁnite computation. Suppose c ∈C. To prove:
yldt,n+1(c) = φt,n+1(c). Without loss of generality we assume c ∈ICt. So we
have yldt,n+1(c) = min{yld(γ)[n + 1]|γ ∈compt(c)} = min{ℓ.yldt(γ′)[n]|c
ℓ→t
c′, γ′ ∈compt(c′)} = min(∪{ℓ.yldt,n(c′)|c
ℓ→t c′}) = min(∪{ℓ.φt,n(c′)|c
ℓ→t
c′}) = φt,n+1(c).
2.7. Definition.
(i) Choose t ∈T S(C, L). Let C′ ⊆C be a subset of conﬁgurations. Deﬁne
φ′
t: C →P∗(Lst) as the least ﬁxed point of Φ′
t ∈Map(C →P∗(Lst)),
where Φ′
t is given by Φ′
t(φ)(c) = {ϵ} if c ∈FCt ∩C′, Φ′
t(φ)(c) =

t(φ)(c) = {⊥} otherwise. φ′

is called the restriction of φt to C′.
(ii) Fix C′ ⊆C. Let γ = ⟨ℓi, ci⟩i∈I be a t-computation. We say that γ is
a t-computation for c in C′ ⇔∀i ∈I : ci−1 ∈C′ (where by convention
c0 = c).

(i) Let t ∈T S(C, L) and C′ ⊆C. Let φ′

N∞).
Then we have that ⟨φt,n⟩n is a chain in C →P∗(Lst) and
φt,∞= lubnφt,n.
Proof. Left to the reader.
3. Operational Semantics
In this section we introduce the simple programming language Prog for which
we shall illustrate our method of designing equivalent operational and deno-
tational semantics.
Also a (parametrised) transition system is given, that
represents the computation steps of an abstract machine running the lan-
guage.
3.1. Definition.
(i) Fix a set A and a set X, the elements of which are called actions and
procedure variables, respectively. A is ranged over by a, X is ranged
over by x.
(ii) The class of statements Stat, with typical element s, is given by s:: =
a|x|(s1; s2)|(s1 + s2)|(s1 ∥s2).
(iii) The class of declarations Decl, ranged over by d, has elements of the
format x1 ⇐s1: · · · : xn ⇐sn where n ∈N, xi ∈X all distinct and
si ∈Stat (i ∈{1, . . . , n}). We say that the procedure variable xi is
declared in d with body si and write xi ⇐si ∈d, (i ∈{1, . . ., n}).
(iv) The class of programs Prog consists of pairs d|s, where d ∈Decl and
s ∈Stat such that each procedure variable x occurring in s and d is
declared in d.
A statement is either an action a in A, a procedure call x in X or a sequential
composition s1; s2, a nondeterministic choice s1+s2 or a concurrent execution
s1∥s2. We suppress parentheses if no confusion may arise.
Our main interest here is in the programming concepts embodied by the
syntactical operators and by recursion. Therefore, the programming language
Prog under consideration is kept uniform or schematic, since the elementary
actions are left unspeciﬁed. (Cf. de Bakker et al [1986].)
The restriction to syntactically closed programs d|s in Prog—each variable
in the program should be coupled with a body—facilitates an easy formulation

§3]
Operational Semantics
395
of the semantical deﬁnitions. However, the restriction could be dispensed with
at the price of appropriate precautions and exceptions below.
3.2. Definition.
We distinguish E which is called the empty statement.
We deﬁne StatE, with typical element ¯s, by StatE = Stat ∪{E}. We also
distinguish τ ̸∈A and put Aτ = A ∪{τ}. Aτ is ranged over by α.
The empty statement E is associated with successful termination, (cf. Apt
[1983]). It will be convenient below to allow the expressions ¯s; ¯s′, ¯s + ¯s′ and
¯s∥¯s′ for arbitrary ¯s, ¯s′ ∈StatE. Therefore we stipulate ¯s ∗E = E ∗¯s = ¯s for
¯s ∈StatE and ∗∈{; , +, ∥}.
The silent step τ—which plays a predominant role in algebraic approaches
to the semantics of concurrency as e.g., Milner [1980], Bergstra and
Klop [1986]—will be used in deﬁnition 3.3 below to indicate body replace-
ment. (As in de Bakker et al [1984].)
Next we give the deﬁnition of the transition system that we will associate
with a declaration d.The deﬁnition illustrates the syntax-directedness which
is typical for transition system based operational models. Such a Structural
Operational Semantics (originating from Hennessy and Plotkin [1979],
Plotkin [1981]), can be considered a proof system for proving transitions
and as a consequence the represented abstract machine can be considered as
a theorem prover. (We refer to the recent developments Badouel [1987],
Groote and Vaandrager [1989], Rutten [1989] for some interesting con-
sequences of this point of view.)
3.3. Definition. A declaration d ∈Decl induces a transition system d ∈
T S(StatE, Aτ) which is the smallest subset of StatE × Aτ × StatE such that
a
a→d E,
(Action)
x
τ→d s where x ⇐s ∈d,
(Proc)
if s
α→d ¯s then s; s′
α→d ¯s; s′,
(Seq)
if s
α→d ¯s then s + s′
α→d ¯s and s′ + s
α→d ¯s,
(Choice)
if s
α→d ¯s then s∥s′
α→d ¯s∥s′ and s′∥s
α→d s′∥¯s.
(Par)
The axiom (Action) states that an action a ∈A can always be executed
successfully after performing a. If a procedure call x is about to be executed,
a silent step τ is signaled and the computation continues with the body s of x,
which is looked up in the declaration. (Since d is syntactically closed such a
body is assumed to exist; since the declared procedure variables are pairwise

396
Meyer and de Vink / Semantics
[ch. 24
distinct the body is unique.) The three rules (Seq), (Choice) and (Par) can be
used to unravel composed statements. Alternative and parallel compositions
can perform the same actions (in Aτ) as their constituting components do. For
a sequential composition s; s′, however, this depends on the actions of its ﬁrst
component, for intuitively the execution of s′ is started after the execution of
s has ﬁnished.
3.4. Example. Suppose x ⇐a; x + b ∈d.
(i) x; c∥y
a→d (a; x + b); c∥y, for x
a→d a; x + b by (Proc), hence x; c
a→d
(a; x + b); c by (Seq), so x; c∥y
a→d (a; x + b); c∥y by (Par).
(ii) (a; x + b); c∥y
b→d c∥y, for b
b→d E by (Action), hence a; x + b
b→d E
by (Choice), so (a; x + b); c
b→d c by (Seq) and therefore by (Par)
(a; x + b); c∥y
b→d c∥y.
The operational semantics for a program d|s ∈Prog can now be deﬁned
straightforwardly. The declaration d speciﬁes the transition system; the state-
ment s speciﬁes the initial conﬁguration in which the computation starts. The
operational semantics will collect all the yields of the transition sequences in
d starting from s.
3.5. Definition. The operational semantics O: Prog →P∗(Ast
τ ) is deﬁned
by O(d|s) = yldd(s), where yldd is the yield function of the transition system
d ∈T S(StatE, Aτ).
This completes the construction of the operational semantics. The opera-
tional model will be compared to a denotational one to be constructed in the
next section.
4. Denotational Semantics
In this section we present a denotational semantics for the language under
consideration. It will assign to each program a denotation, i.e., an object
representing its meaning, in a suitably chosen mathematical domain. More-
over, the semantics will be compositional or homomorphic: the meanings of a
composed construct depends only upon the meaning of its constituting com-
ponents. Finally, we will use a technique based on so-called environments and
ﬁxed points to handle recursion.
Programs will be given meaning in the domain P∗(Ast
τ ). So compact stream
sets serve as denotations. (We have to resort to sets of streams, rather than
streams, in order to cater for nondeterminism.) In order to deal with proce-
dure calls we introduce the notion of an environment. Environments are used
to store and retrieve the meaning of procedure variables, i.e., mappings from
X to P∗(Ast
τ ). For a program d|s, the statement s will be evaluated w.r.t. an

§4]
Denotational Semantics
397
environment depending on the declaration d. So the deﬁnition of the denota-
tional semantics amounts to specifying the evaluation of a statement and the
environment corresponding to a given declaration.
The compositionality requirement for the evaluation of statements will be
met by designing for each syntactical operator, viz. ; , + and ∥, a semantical
one, written as ;D, +D and ∥D, respectively. We will have D(d|s1 ∗s2) =
D(d|s1)∗D D(d|s2) for ∗∈{; , +, ∥}. Each declaration induces an environment
transformation. We will take the least ﬁxed point of this transformation, say
ηd, for the environment associated with the declaration. For this to work we
need that this transformation is continuous. Since the transformation of an
environment η is in essence body replacement—a procedure variable will be
mapped on the denotation of its body w.r.t. η—we will need continuity of
the semantical operators ;D, +D and ∥D. In its turn this will be guaranteed
by the extension and lifting lemma, presented in §2, that we will use in the
construction of these operators.
4.1. Definition.
(i) We deﬁne ;D : P∗(Ast
τ ) × P∗(Ast
τ ) →P∗(Ast
τ ) as the extended and
lifted version of ;D : Af
τ × Af
τ →P∗(Ast
τ ), that is given by ϵ;D y = {y},
⊥;D y = {⊥}, αx;D y = α(x;D y).
(ii) We deﬁne +D: P∗(Ast
τ ) × P∗(Ast
τ ) →P∗(Ast
τ ) as the extended and
lifted version of +D: Af
τ × Af
τ →P∗(Ast
τ ), that is given by x +D y =
min{x, y}.
(iii) ∥D, ⌊⌊D: Af
τ × Af
τ →P∗(Ast
τ ) are given by ϵ⌊⌊D y = {y}, ⊥⌊⌊D y = {⊥},
αx⌊⌊D y = α(x∥D y), x∥D y = x⌊⌊D y+D y⌊⌊D x. We deﬁne ∥D: P∗(Ast
τ )×
P∗(Ast
τ ) →P∗(Ast
τ ) as the extended and lifted version of ∥D on Af
τ.
Having now available semantical interpretations for our syntactical opera-
tors we can proceed with the deﬁnition of the denotational semantics for Prog.
It follows the same general scheme as in e.g. de Bakker and Meyer [1988],
de Vink [1988].
4.2. Definition. Let Env = X →P∗(Ast
τ ), with typical element η, denote
the collection of environments.
(i) We deﬁne the statement evaluator S: Stat →Env →P∗(Ast
τ ) by
S(a)(η) = {a}, S(x)(η) = η(x), S(s1 ∗s2)(η) = S(s1)(η) ∗D S(s2)(η)
for ∗∈{; , +, ∥}.
(ii) For d ∈Decl we deﬁne an environment transformation Φd: Env →
Env, Φd(η)(x) = τS(s)(η) where x ⇐s ∈d.
(iii) The denotational semantics D: Prog →P∗(Ast
τ ) is deﬁned by D(d|s) =
S(s)(ηd) where ηd is the least ﬁxed point of Φd.
The deﬁnition of ηd in clause (iii) above appeals to the Knaster-Tarski
theorem 2.2. Therefore we have to check continuity of the transformation Φd
and hence of S. This boils down to continuity of the semantical operators,
which is guaranteed by the tools used for their construction.

398
Meyer and de Vink / Semantics
[ch. 24
4.3. Lemma.
(i) ;D , +D, ∥D are well-deﬁned and continuous on P∗(Ast
τ ).
(ii) S and Φd are continuous in η.
(iii) D is well-deﬁned.
Let d ∈Decl and ηd be the least ﬁxed point of Φd. From the lemma we
deduce the following. Deﬁne the environments ηd,k(k ∈N) inductively by
ηd,0 = λx.{⊥}, ηd,k+1 = Φd(ηd,k).
Then we have ηd = lubn ηd,n.
So the
denotational semantics D(d|s) = S(s)(ηd) can be represented as the least
upper bound of the chain ⟨S(s)(ηd,i)⟩i. This property will be exploited in the
next section devoted to the equivalence of the operational and denotational
deﬁnitions.
5. Equivalence of O and D
Having deﬁned both an operational and a denotational semantics for the pro-
grams in Prog the question rises whether the denotational model D is correct
with respect to the computational intuition captured by the operational model
O. Therefore the concern of this section is to prove the next theorem.
5.1. Theorem. O = D.
The strategy we shall exploit in proving theorem 5.1 is the following: First
we extend the operational semantics obtaining a similar so-called intermedi-
ate semantics I. (Similar in the sense that I is also transition system based.
Moreover it can almost directly be observed that O = I.)
Both the in-
termediate and denotational semantics—unlike the operational one—can be
represented as least upper bounds of chains of approximations as was indi-
cated already for the denotational semantics at the end of §4. We shall apply
a ﬁxed point induction technique at the level of the approximations in order
to establish the equality of the limits, i.e., I = D.
The conﬁgurations of the intermediate transition systems are so-called gen-
eralised statements—statements augmented with indices indicating the num-
ber of nestings of procedure calls—together with the empty statement E.
5.2. Definition.
(i) Let n be a typical variable of N. The collection of generalised state-
ments GStat is given by G: : = (s, n)|G1; G2|G1 ∪G2|G1∥G2. We put
GStatE = GStat ∪{E}.
(ii) For G ∈GStat we deﬁne ind(G)—the index of G—in N as follows:
ind(a, n) = 0, ind(x, n) = n + 1, ind(s1 ∗s2, n) = max{ind(s1, n),
ind(s2, n)}, ind(G1 ∗G2) = max{ind(G1), ind(G2)}.
(iii) For k ∈N we put GStatk = {G ∈GStat|ind(G) ≤k}.

§5]
Equivalence of O and D
399
The intermediate transition system d ∈T S(GStatE, Aτ) below that we
shall associate with a declaration d is much alike the induced transition system
d ∈T S(StatE, Aτ). Note that in Proc we increment the index since the body
s is considered to be of a deeper call level, (viz. n+1), than the procedure call
x itself, (of level n). The auxiliary rule Aux is used to distribute operators
inside out. It amounts to the identiﬁcation of the generalised statements of
the formats (s, n) ∗(s′, n) and (s ∗s′, n), respectively.
5.3. Definition.
(i) Let d ∈Decl.
The declaration d induces a transition system d ∈
T S(GStatE, Aτ) which is the smallest subset of (GStatE, Aτ, GStatE)
such that
(a, n)
a→d E,
(Action)
(x, n)
τ→d (s, n + 1), where x ⇐s ∈d,
(Proc)
if (s, n) ∗(s′, n)
α→d G
(Aux)
then (s ∗s′, n)
α→d G, for ∗∈{; , +, ∥},
if G
α→G then G; G′
α→d G; G′,
(Seq)
if G
α→d G then G + G′
α→d G and G′ + G
α→d G,
(Choice)
if G
α→G then G∥G′
α→d G∥G′ and G′∥G
α→d G′∥G.
(Par)
(ii) The intermediate semantics I: Prog →P∗(Ast
τ ) is deﬁned by I(d|s) =
yldd(s, 0) where yldd is the yield function of the transition system
d ∈T S(GStatE, Aτ).
The intermediate semantics of a program d|s is deﬁned as the yield func-
tion of the transition system d applied to the initial conﬁguration for s in
the intermediate model being (s, 0). So I(d|s) is a set of streams of labels.
Therefore lemma 5.4 below will not come as a surprise since the respective
transition systems are the same modulo conﬁgurations.
5.4. Lemma. O = I.
Proof.
By deﬁnition of O and I it suﬃces to show for all d ∈Decl,
s ∈Stat that yldd(s) = yldd(s, 0) where yldd is taken with respect to d ∈
T S(StatE, Aτ) and d ∈T S(GStatE, Aτ), respectively.
Deﬁne a projection π: GStatE →StatE as follows: π(E) = E, π(s, n) = s,
π(G1 ∗G2) = π(G1) ∗π(G2). By induction on the derivation for s
α→d ¯s,
G
α→d G we can establish (i) s
α→d ¯s & π(G) = s ⇒G
α→d G & π(G) = ¯s
for some G, and (ii) G
α→d G ⇒π(G)
α→d π(G).
From this we derive
straightforwardly yldd(s) = yldd(s, 0).
We proceed with exploiting the extra information available in generalised
statements. Intuitively it is clear that, for ﬁxed k, computations in GStatk are

400
Meyer and de Vink / Semantics
[ch. 24
ﬁnite. Inﬁnite computations will eventually encounter a conﬁguration of index
exceeding k, for such computations involve unbounded nestings of recursive
calls.
5.5. Theorem. Every d-computation in GStatk is ﬁnite.
Proof.
For s ∈Stat we deﬁne a complexity measure compl(s) in N+ as
follows: compl(a) = compl(x) = 1, compl(s1 ∗s2) = compl(s1) + compl(s2).
Let k ∈N. Associate with G ∈GStatE a polynomial wgtk(G) in N[X]—called
the weight of G—as follows: wgtk(s, n) = compl(s) · Xk+1−n if ind(s, n) ≤k,
wgtk(G1 ∗G2) = wgtk(G1) + wgtk(G2) if ind(G1 ∗G2) ≤k, wgtk(G) = 0
otherwise. Note, that we have wgtk(G) ̸= 0 ⇔G ∈GStatk.
Deﬁne an ordering ≤on N[X] by f ≤g ⇔f(n) ≤g(n) for almost all
n ∈N. Then it is the case that (N[X], ≤) is a well-founded partial order,
(i.e., a partial order in which every decreasing sequence is ﬁnite). Therefore
it suﬃces to prove: If G
α→d G in GStatk, then wgtk(G) > wgtk(G). Cf.
Klop [1980], Dershowith [1987].
Suppose G
α→d G with G ̸∈GStatk.
From wgtk(G) ̸= 0 in N[X] and
wgtk(G) = 0 we infer wgtk(G) > wgtk(G). So, assume G
α→d G with G ∈
GStatk. We show wgtk(G) > wgtk(G) by induction on the derivation of G
α→d
G. (Action) Trivial. (Proc) Say G = (x, n), G = (s, n + 1) with n, n + 1 ≤k
and x ⇐s ∈d. Clearly wgtk(G) = Xk+1−n > compl(s) · Xk−n = wgtk(G),
for k+1−n > k−n. (Aux) By induction hypothesis, for the weights of the left-
hand sides of premise and conclusion are equal. (Seq) Say G = G′′; G′, G =
G
′′; G′. By induction hypothesis or the above we have wgtk(G′′) > wgtk(G
′′).
So wgtk(G) = wgtk(G′′) + wgtk(G′) > wgtk(G
′′) + wgtk(G′) = wgtk(G).
(Choice) and (Par) Similar to the case (Seq).
Next we establish a compositionality result for the approximations of the
intermediate semantics. As a corollary to theorem 5.5 we have that this can
be obtained using the principle of Noetherian induction. (See Huet[1980].)
The collection of all computations in GStatk starting from a ﬁxed generalised
statement can be represented by a ﬁnitely branching tree. Since by theorem
5.5 all paths in this tree are ﬁnite it follows by K¨onig’s lemma that there
exists a uniform bound on the length of these computations which justiﬁes
the appropriateness of the principle.
5.6. Lemma. Let yldd,k be the yield function of the restriction of the tran-
sition system d to GStatk. Suppose G1, G2 ∈GStat. Then it holds that
yldd,k(G1 ∗G2) = yldd,k(G1) ∗D yldd,k(G2) for ∗∈{; , +, ∥}.
Proof. We only prove the case ∥. It suﬃces to show
{yld(γ)|γ ∈compd,k(G1∥G2)} = ∪{yld(γ1)∥yld(γ2)|γi ∈compd,k(Gi)}.
By strictness of ∥, we can assume ind(G1∥G2) ≤k.

(a) Let γ be a maximal d-computation for G1∥G2 in GStatk. Say
γ: G1∥G2
w→d Z
with Z ∈GStatE \ GStatk. Put ζ = ϵ if Z = E, ζ =⊥if Z ∈GStat \ GStatk.
To prove wζ ∈yld(γ1)∥yld(γ2) for some maximal d-computations γ1, γ2 for
G1, G2 in GStatk.
Without loss of generality γ: G1∥G2
α→d G1∥G2
w′
→Z
where G1
α→d G1 and αw′ = w.
′′G1 = E′′ Then we have γ: G1∥G2
α→d
G2
w′
→d Z.
Put γ1: G1
α→d E, γ2: G2
w′
→d Z.
Notice |w′| ≥1.
So wζ =
αw′ζ ∈α∥w′ζ = yld(γ1)∥yld(γ2).
′′ind(G1) ≤k′′ By induction hypothesis
there exist maximal d-computations γ′
1: G1
w′
→d Z1, γ2: G2
w2
→d Z2 in GStatk
such that w′ζ ∈w′
1ζ1∥w2ζ2 (with Zi corresponding to ζi, i = 1, 2).
Put
γ1: G1
α→d G1
w′
1
→d Z1. Then γ1, γ2 satisfy the conditions.
′′ind(G1) > k′′
Then we have wζ = α ⊥. Put γ1: G1
α→d G1 and choose an arbitrary (non-
empty) maximal d-computation γ2: G2
w2
→d Z in GStatk.
So it holds that
wζ = α ⊥∈α ⊥∥w2ζ2 = yld(γ1)∥yld(γ2).
(b) Let γ1, γ2 be maximal d-computations in GStatk for G1, G2.
Say
γ1: G1
w1
→d Z1, G2
w2
→d Z2. Choose wζ ∈w1ζ1∥w2ζ2. To prove wζ = yld(γ)
for some maximal d-computation γ: G1∥G2
w→d Z in GStatk. Without loss
of generality γ1: G1
α→d G1
w′
→d Z1 and wζ ∈w1ζ1⌊⌊w2ζ2. So w = αw′ and
w′ζ ∈w′
2ζ2∥w2ζ2.
′′G1 = E′′ Then we have wζ ∈α⌊⌊w2ζ2 = {αw2ζ2}. So
w = αw2, ζ = ζ2. Put γ: G1∥G2
α→d G2
w2
→d Z2. Then γ ∈compd,k(G1∥G2)
with yld(γ) = wζ. ′′ind(G1) ≤k′′ By induction hypothesis there exists γ′ ∈
compd,k(G1∥G2) such that γ′: G1∥G2
w′
→d Z, w′ζ = yld(γ′). Put γ: G1∥G2
α→d
G1∥G2
w′
→d Z. Clearly, γ ∈compd,k(G1∥G2) with yld(γ) = wζ. ′′ind(G1 > k′′
Then we have wζ = α ⊥. Put γ: G1∥G2
α→d G1∥G2. So γ ∈compd,k(G1∥G2)
with yld(γ) = α ⊥= wζ.
In order to deal with procedure calls in the proof of the main theorem
5.1 we need a little lemma concerning body replacement, which is a direct
consequence of the deﬁnition of (Proc) for the intermediate transition systems.
5.7. Lemma. Let d ∈Decl. Suppose x ⇐s ∈d. Then yldd,k+1(x, 0) =
τ.yldd,k(s, 0).
Proof. Since (x, 0)
τ→d (s, 1) is the only d-transition for (x, 0) in GStatk+1,
it suﬃces to show #: yldd,k+1(s, 1) = yldd,k(s, 0).
Deﬁne for G ∈GStatE the generalised statement G+1 as follows: E+1 = E,
(s, n) + 1 = (s, n + 1), (G1 ∗G2) + 1 = (G1 + 1) ∗(G2 + 1). Then # follows
from G1
α→d G1 in GStatk ⇒G1 + 1
α→d G1 + 1 in GStatk+1, and G1
α→d G1
in GStatk+1 & G0 + 1 = G1 ⇒∃G0: G0
α→d G0 in GStatk & G0 + 1 = G1,
which can be proved by induction on the derivation for Gi

Finally we have arrived at a position in which we can prove the operational
and denotational semantics for Prog equivalent. The proof now is based of the
compositionality of the intermediate semantics and on a continuity argument
on the level of approximations.
Proof. (of theorem 5.1) Let d ∈Decl, s ∈Stat. By lemma 5.4 it suﬃces to
show I = D. By theorem 2.2 and lemma 4.3 we have on the one hand I(d|s) =
yldd(s, 0) = lubk yldd,k(s, 0) and on the other hand D(d|s) = S(s)(ηd) =
lubkS(s)(ηd,k). Therefore it remains to prove ∀s ∈Stat ∀k ∈N: yldd,k(s, 0) =
S(s)(ηd,k). We prove this by induction on the pair (s, k).
′′(a, k)′′ Consider the conﬁguration (a, 0). There is only one maximal d-
computation for (a, 0) in GStatk, viz. (a, 0)
α→d E. So yldd,k(a, 0) = {a}.
By deﬁnition S(a)(ηd,k) = {a}.
′′(x, 0)′′ We have yldd,0(x, 0) = {⊥}, for
ind(x, 0) = 1 > 0. On the other hand S(x)(ηd,0) = ηd,0(x) = {⊥}. ′′(x, k+1)′′
By induction hypothesis and lemma 5.7 we have yldd,k+1(x, 0) = τ.yldd,k(s, 0)
= τ.S(s)(ηd,k) = Φd(ηd,k)(x) = ηd,k+1(x) = S(x)(ηd,k+1).
′′(s1 ∗s2, k)′′
By lemma 5.6 and the induction hypothesis we have yldd,k(s1 ∗s2, 0) =
yldd,k(s1, 0) ∗yldd,k(s2, 0) = S(s1)(ηd,k) ∗S(s2)(ηd,k) = S(s1 ∗s2)(ηd,k).
6. Conclusion and Open Problems
In this paper we have seen how we can relate denotational and operational se-
mantics for languages with recursion via an intermediate semantics that keeps
track of the recursion depth. We illustrated the method by considering a very
simple programming language that includes a basic form of concurrency. We
claim that the method presented here is universal in the sense that it can be
employed for a wide range of languages with more complicated forms of con-
currency, (cf. Meyer and de Vink [1988, 1989b, 1989a], de Vink [1988]),
although we cannot expect the equality of the operational and denotational
models (O = D) to hold any more. In general when dealing with commu-
nication of synchronisation one can not hope for a transition system based
operational semantics that is compositional as well. In these cases we should
settle for O = α ◦D for some abstraction operator α. However, in these cases
an intermediate semantics I might be employed along the lines followed in
this paper for which it can be established that I = D and O = α ◦I.
Although the technique for relating operational and denotational semantics
presented here can be extended to more realistic programming languages one
can argue about the treatment of recursion. In the operational semantics we
have the axiom x
τ→d s for x ⇐s in d. Hence we can observe—by means
of the label τ—the replacement of x by its body s. (This amounts to, e.g.,
D(d|x) = τD(d|s) for x ⇐s ∈d.)
If occurrences of τ are considered as undesirable observations one could
model the procedure call by using a rule (instead of an axiom), viz. x
α→d ¯s

§6]
Conclusion and Open Problems
403
if s
α→d ¯s for x ⇐s in d where α ranges over the collection of actions A
excluding τ. In order to make this to work one has to impose a guardedness or
Greibach condition on the bodies of the declared procedure variables, i.e., each
occurrences of a procedure variable is preceded (guarded) by an occurrence
of an action. This restriction guarantees that there exists a proper ﬁrst step
for each body s without spanning of an inﬁnite digression of procedure calls.
More formally, we can construct from the axioms and rules of the transition
system induced by the declaration d a proof validating an transition s
α→d ¯s
with α ∈A. (The notion of a ﬁrst step is exploited fruitfully in the metric
approach to denotational semantics as proposed by De Bakker et al that
uses contracting functions on complete metric spaces with Banach’s theorem
playing a similar role as the Knaster-Tarski theorem in the cpo setting. Cf.
de Bakker and Zucker [1982], de Bakker and Kok [1985], de Bakker
et al [1986], Kok and Rutten [1988], de Bakker and Meyer [1988], de
Bakker [1988], America et al [19∞] and de Bruin and de Vink [1989].)
Alternatively to the adoption of the guardedness condition is the interpre-
tation of ﬁnite strings of τ’s as a skip action, i.e., ϵ, and inﬁnite ones as
divergence, i.e., ⊥.
This brings us to the problem of so-called unguarded
recursion for which—to our knowledge—no satisfactory solution have been
given yet. In the context of the present paper this problem can be formulated
as follows:
Problem.
Does there exist a semantics D′ for the language Prog which is 548. ?
(i) compositional, i.e., D′(d|s1 ∗s2) = D′(d|s1) ∗D′ D′(d|s2) for every syntac-
tic operator ∗, handles (ii) recursion by means of ﬁxed point techniques, is
(iii) correct with respect to the operational semantics, i.e., D′ = O, and which
moreover satisﬁes (iv) D′(d|x) = D′(d|s) for each x ⇐s ∈d.
(Properties (i) through (iii) are satisﬁed by the denotational semantics D, but
property (iv) is not.)
From the operational point of view this interpretation of a procedure call
is quit appropriate. A slight extension to the set up of the deﬁnition of the
yield function of a transition system will take care of this.
However, the
ﬁxed point characterisation of the yield does not hold any more. For it can
very well be the case under this interpretation that operationally a program
will have a non-ﬂat and non-closed meaning. (E.g. intuitively in this setting
one would like to have ba∗∪{⊥} as the operational meaning of the program
x ⇐x; a + b|x in contrast to the treatment of section 3 where we would have
O(x ⇐x; a + b|x) = {τ nban|n ∈N} ∪{τ ω}. So O(x ⇐x; a + b|x) is non-ﬂat
and does not contain the limit point aω.)
When designing a denotational
semantics this should be considered a problem since we are forced to leave
the realm of cpos including the Knaster-Tarski theorem. (A similar argument
applies to the metric approach.) Therefore other mathematical structures, in

404
Meyer and de Vink / Semantics
[ch. 24
which ﬁxed point equations can be solved, will have to be recognised as deno-
tational domains before an appropriate answer to the question for a general
approach for constructing and relating operational and denotational semantics
for unguarded recursion can be given.

1. Introduction
The aim of this note is to present the current state of aﬀairs concerning the
topological classiﬁcation of incomplete metric spaces including linear spaces,
convex sets, groups and special ﬁnite-dimensional open problems. The follow-
ing are major goals in the theory of incomplete spaces:
(I) To give a topological classiﬁcation of metric linear spaces, their convex
subsets, and of metric groups.
(II) To recognize metric linear spaces, their convex subsets, and metric
groups, respectively, that are homeomorphic to pre-Hilbert spaces,
their convex subsets and additive subgroups, respectively.
(III) To classify universal ﬁnite-dimensional spaces that occur naturally in
classical topology.
The goals (I) and (II) go back to the program of Fr´echet [1928] and
Banach [1932] to recognize normed linear spaces that are homeomorphic
to pre-Hilbert spaces. Although this program has been realized quite satis-
factory for complete spaces, the incomplete case is still in its initial stage.
Goal (III) concerns for example the classical N¨obeling [1931] spaces and
their complements in the appropriate euclidean spaces, and also Geoghegan-
Summerhill [1974] pseudointeriors and pseudoboundaries. This goal is of
interest for incomplete and complete spaces as well. The recent results of
Bestvina [1988] and Dijkstra et al [19∞] have created new hope that
methods of inﬁnite-dimensional topology can be used in the ﬁnite-dimensional
case.
There has been much recent interest in characterizing the N¨obeling
spaces which are ﬁnite-dimensional analogues of R∞, the countable product
of lines (cf. Draniˇsnikov [1986], Chigogidze [19∞] and Chigogidze and
Valov [19∞]).
Almost all known results concerning (I), (II) and (III) were obtained by
using variations of the method of absorbing sets. For this reason we start
this article with a sketch of the theory of absorbing sets. The remaining part
of this note consists of current open problems. It is likely that our list of
problems is not complete and that some of the problems are inadequately
or clumsy worded, are easy to answer or are already known. Except for the
ﬁnal remarks, questions about nonseparable spaces and manifolds modeled on
incomplete spaces are not included in this text.
2. Absorbing sets: A Survey of Results
We start this section by recalling some necessary notions. A closed subset
A of a metric space X is a Z-set (resp. a strong Z-set) if given an open
cover U of X there exists a U-close to the identity map f: X →X such that
f(X) (resp. the closure of f(X)) misses A. We recall the notion of strong
universality. Let C be a class of separable metric spaces which is
411

412
Dobrowolski and Mogilski / Incomplete Metric Spaces
[ch. 25
(a) topological (i.e., for every C ∈C and every homeomorphism h: C →D
it follows that D ∈C);
(b) hereditary with respect to closed subsets (i.e., every closed subset of
any C ∈C belongs to C);
(c) additive (i.e., if C = C1 ∪C2, where C1, C2 are elements of C which
are closed in C, then C ∈C);
A space X is strongly C-universal if, for every map f: C →X from a space
C ∈C into X, for every closed subset D ⊆C such that f|D: D →X is
a Z-embedding (i.e., f is an embedding and f(D) is a Z-set in X) and for
every open cover U of X, there exists a Z-embedding h: C →X such that
h|D = f|D and h is U-close to f. We say that X is C-universal if C ⊆F0(X),
where F0(X) is the class of all spaces that are homeomorphic to a closed
subset of X.
Let C be a class. Then Cσ is the class of separable metric spaces C such
that C = ∞
i=1 Ci, where Ci is closed in C and Ci ∈C for i = 1, 2, . . ..
Let us point out that if C is a class which is topological and hereditary with
respect to closed subsets, then every absolute retract X which is a countable
union of strong Z-sets and is strongly C-universal is also strongly universal
for the class consisting of all spaces C of the form C = C1 ∪C2, where C1, C2
are elements of C which are closed in C.
Let us mention that the strong universality property is a local version of the
universality properties which characterize the Hilbert cube I∞(Toru´nczyk
[1980]) and the Hilbert space ℓ2 (Toru´nczyk [1981]). Namely, an absolute
retract X such that every Z-set in X is a strong Z-set is strongly C-universal
iﬀfor every open subset U of X and every open subset V of C, where C ∈C,
each map f: V →U can be arbitrarily closely approximated by Z-embeddings
into U.
Now we propose our version of the notion of absorbing set which seems to
be both useful and general. We say that a space X is inﬁnite-dimensional if X
is not a ﬁnite-dimensional space and we also use the following notation: X ∈
AE(n) if X is an absolute extensor for all at most n-dimensional spaces; and
X ∈AE(∞) if X is an absolute extensor for all metric spaces (equivalently,
X is an absolute retract).
Fix n ∈N ∪{∞}.
An n-dimensional separable metric space X is a C-
absorbing set if:
(abs1)
X ∈AE(n);
(abs2)
X is a countable union of strong Z-sets;
(abs3)
X ∈Cσ;
(abs4)
X is strongly C-universal.

§2]
Absorbing sets: A Survey of Results
413
Let k, n ∈N ∪{∞}. We say that an n-dimensional C-absorbing set X is
representable in a k-dimensional space M ∈AE(n) if X is homeomorphic to a
subset X0 in M such that M \ X0 is locally m-homotopy negligible in M (i.e.,
for every open set U ⊆M the inclusion U ∩X0 →U induces an isomorphism
of i-dimensional homotopy groups for i −1 < m, where m = ∞if k = ∞
or m = n otherwise. The set X0 is called a representation of X in M. If X
is itself a representation in M then we say that X is an absorbing set in M.
Usually we will represent absorbing sets in either Rk, where k ∈N ∪{∞}, or
in the Hilbert cube I∞.
The notion of C-absorbing set in R∞is taken from Bestvina and Mogilski
[1986] and generalizes concepts of Anderson [19∞], Bessaga and Pelczy´n-
ski [1970], Toru´nczyk [1970b, 1970a] and West [1970].
We now quote some fundamental facts concerning absorbing sets (see
Bestvina and Mogilski [1986]).
(A) Uniqueness Theorem: Let X and Y be C-absorbing sets in R∞.
Then for every open cover U of R∞there exists a homeomorphism
h: X →Y that is U-close to the inclusion X →R∞. If, in addition, X
and Y are countable union of Z-sets in R∞, then we can achieve that
the homeomorphism h extends to the whole space.
(B) Characterization Theorem: Let X be an inﬁnite-dimensional C-
absorbing set in R∞. Then every C-absorbing set Y is homeomorphic
to X.
(C) Z-Set Unknotting Theorem: Let X be a C-absorbing set in R∞.
Let U be an open cover of R∞and suppose that h: A →B is a home-
omorphism between Z-sets A and B in X. If h is U-homotopic to the
inclusion A →X and if B is an open cover of X, then there is a home-
omorphism H: X →X such that H|A = h and H is st(U, B)-close to
the identity.
(D) Factor Theorem: Let a class C have the property that C1, C2 ∈C
implies C1 × C2 ∈C and let Y be an inﬁnite-dimensional C-absorbing
set in R∞. Then X × Y is homeomorphic to Y for every retract X of
Y .
(E) Countable Union Theorem: Every C-absorbing set is also a Cσ-
absorbing set.
Here is a list of known absorbing sets that are representable in R∞.
(1) Every countable dense subset of R∞is an absorbing set for the class of
all ﬁnite sets (see Bessaga and Pelczy´nski [1975]).

414
Dobrowolski and Mogilski / Incomplete Metric Spaces
[ch. 25
(2) The space σ = R∞
f
= {(xi) ∈R∞: xi = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many i}
is an Rω-absorbing set, where Rω is the class of all ﬁnite-dimensional
compacta (Anderson [19∞], Bessaga and Pelczy´nski [1970])
(cf. also Bessaga and Pelczy´nski [1975] and Mogilski [1984]).
(3) There are Rn-absorbing sets σn in R∞and σk
n in Rk, where Rn is the
class of all at most n-dimensional compacta and k ≥2n + 1 (Dijk-
stra [1985] and Geoghegan and Summerhill [1974]).
(4) There are Rnm-absorbing sets σnm in R∞and σk
nm in Rk, where Rnm
is the class of all at most n-dimensional compacta embeddable in Rm,
where n = 0, 1, . . . and n ≤m ≤2n + 1 ≤k (Dijkstra and Mogilski
[19∞]).
(5) The space Σ = R∞
bd consisting of all bounded sequences of R∞is an R-
absorbing set, where R is the class of all compacta (Anderson [19∞],
Bessaga and Pelczy´nski [1970]) (cf. also Bessaga and Pelczy´nski
[1975] and Mogilski [1984]).
(6) For every countable ordinal β there exist an ordinal α ≥β and an Rα-
absorbing set σα in ℓ2, where Rα is the class of all compacta with trans-
ﬁnite dimension less than α (Dobrowolski and Mogilski [19∞a]).
(7) The space σ × R∞is a Gδ-absorbing set, where Gδ is the class of all
topologically complete separable spaces (see Bessaga and Pelczy´n-
ski [1975]; see also Bestvina and Mogilski [1986]).
(8) For every countable ordinal α ≥1 there exists a Uα-absorbing set Λα
in R∞, where Uα is the class of all absolute Borel sets of the additive
class α (Bestvina and Mogilski [1986]).
(9) For every countable ordinal α ≥2 there exists an Mα-absorbing set
Ωα in R∞, where Mα is the class of all absolute Borel sets of the
multiplicative class α (Bestvina and Mogilski [1986]).
(10) Every inﬁnite-dimensional, σ-compact locally convex metric linear
space E is a C(E)-absorbing set, where C(E) is the class of all com-
pacta embeddable in E (Dobrowolski [1989]).
(11) If X is a separable absolute retract and ∗∈X, then
X∞
f
= {(xi) ∈X∞: xi = ∗for all but ﬁnitely many i}
is a ∞
n=1 F0(Xn)-absorbing set (Bestvina and Mogilski [1986]).
(12) If X is a separable absolute retract which is a countable union of Z-
sets, then X∞is an F0(X∞)-absorbing set (Bestvina and Mogilski
[1986]).
The method of absorbing sets mentioned in the introduction applies (A) and
(B) to reduce the problem of homeomorphy of the spaces under consideration

§3]
General Problems about Absorbing Sets
415
to the problem of recognizing whether they are absorbing sets for the same
class. The most general results in this way are included in the next theorem.
Classiﬁcation Theorem:
(i) Every inﬁnite-dimensional metric linear space E such that E ∈(Rω)σ
is homeomorphic to σ (Curtis et al [1984]; see also Anderson [19∞],
Bessaga and Pelczy´nski [1970, 1975], Toru´nczyk [1970b] and
West [1970]).
(ii) Let X and Y be locally convex metric linear spaces such that X =
∞
i=1 Xi and Y = ∞
i=1 Yi, where all Xi and Yi are compacta. Then
X and Y are homeomorphic iﬀXi ∈F0(Y ) and Yi ∈F0(X) for all i
(Dobrowolski [1989]).
In particular, a σ-compact locally convex
metric linear space E is homeomorphic to Σ (resp. to σα) iﬀE is R-
universal (resp. E ∈(Rα)σ and E is Rα-universal) (Dobrowolski

3. General Problems about Absorbing Sets
In our opinion the research eﬀort in the theory of absorbing sets should concen-
trate either on enlarging the list of absorbing sets, improving and generalizing
the basic theorems (A)−(E) or recognizing absorbing sets listed in §2 among
objects naturally appearing in functional analysis or classical topology. In this
section we pose problems concerning the abstract theory of absorbing sets.

Under what conditions does there exist an arbitrarily close to the identity

or I∞)?
4. Problems about λ-convex Absorbing Sets
This section is devoted to the question of recognizing absorbing sets among
spaces equipped with an algebraic structure including metric linear spaces,
their convex subsets and also contractible metric groups. All such spaces X
have an equiconnecting structure, i.e., there exists a continuous map λ: X ×
X × I →X satisfying λ(x, y, 0) = x, λ(x, y, 1) = y and λ(x, x, t) = x for all

§4]
Problems about λ-convex Absorbing Sets
417
x, y ∈X and t ∈I. In general, let X be a contractible metric group with a
contracting homotopy φ of X to its unit element e; then the map
λ(x, y, t) = [φt(e)]−1φt(x y−1)y
(x, y ∈X)
deﬁnes an equiconnecting structure on X.
Every subset Y of a group X
satisfying λ(Y × Y × I) = Y is said to be λ-convex. In particular, if X is
a metric linear space then the λ-equiconnected structure of X deﬁned in the
above way for φt(x) = t x is just the convex structure of X and each λ-convex
subset Y of X is a convex subset of X.
We start with the following general question.
Question 4.1. When is a separable incomplete λ-convex set Y an F0(Y )- 559. ?
absorbing set?
At the very beginning we face the most outstanding question in inﬁnite-
dimensional topology:
Question 4.2. Is every λ-convex set an absolute retract? (It is even unknown 560. ?
whether every metric linear space is an absolute retract.)
Let us mention here that the problem of the topological classiﬁcation of
all closed convex subsets of separable complete metric linear spaces and of
separable metric groups has been reduced to the problem of recognizing the
absolute retract property (Dobrowolski and Toru´nczyk [1979], [1981]).
The last problem seems to be very diﬃcult: in general it has been solved
positively only for convex subsets of locally convex linear spaces (see Bessaga
and Pelczy´nski [1975]) and contractible groups which are countable unions
of ﬁnite-dimensional subsets (Haver [1973]). The topological classiﬁcation of
incomplete metric linear spaces creates a lot of new diﬃculties; therefore we
will concentrate on the problem of establishing the properties (abs1) −(abs4)
for λ-convex sets which are absolute retracts.
The next three questions concern the condition (abs2). Obviously this con-
dition implies that the space in question is of ﬁrst category.
Question 4.3. Let Y be an absolute retract λ-convex set. Is Y a countable 561. ?
union of Z-sets provided it is of ﬁrst category?
The answer to this question even for metric linear spaces would be very in-
teresting.
It is known that Borelian incomplete metric groups are of ﬁrst category
(Banach [1931]). Thus we ask:
Question 4.4. Let E be an incomplete pre-Hilbert space which is an absolute 562. ?

418
Dobrowolski and Mogilski / Incomplete Metric Spaces
[ch. 25
Borel set. Is E a countable union of Z-sets?
Question 4.5. Let Y be an absolute retract λ-convex set. Is every Z-set in
? 563.
Y a strong Z-set?
Let us mention that each Z-set is a strong Z-set in a separable absolute
retract X, where X is either a metric group or X is a convex subset of a com-
plete metric linear space such that its closure X is either an absolute retract
or is nonlocally compact (this follows from Bestvina and Mogilski [1986,
Proposition 1.7] and the results of Dobrowolski and Toru´nczyk [1981]).
Question 4.5 is interesting for compact convex subsets of nonlocally convex
linear spaces (see Roberts [1976, 1977]).
Question 4.6.
Let Y be an inﬁnite-dimensional λ-convex set which is
? 564.
an absolute retract.
Does the C-universality property imply the strong C-
universality property of Y ?
It is even unknown whether F0(Y ) is additive, where Y is a pre-Hilbert
space which is an absolute Borel set.
Question 4.7. Let Y be an inﬁnite-dimensional λ-convex set which is an
? 565.
absolute retract. Does every homeomorphism between Z-sets of Y extend to
a homeomorphism of the whole space Y ?
A general answer is unknown, even for Borelian pre-Hilbert spaces.
Question 4.8. Does every homeomorphism between compacta of a nonlo-
? 566.
cally convex metric linear space E extend to a homeomorphism of E?
By theorem (C), each inﬁnite-dimensional absorbing set in R∞is a ho-
mogeneous absolute retract and all inﬁnite-dimensional absorbing sets listed
in §2 have representations in R∞as linear subspaces. Therefore it is inter-
esting whether absorbing sets admit algebraic structures and how nice these
structures could be.
Question 4.9. Find an inﬁnite-dimensional absorbing set in R∞which does
? 567.
not admit a group structure.
Question 4.10. Let Y be a λ-convex absorbing set. Can Y be represented
? 568.
as a convex subset of a metric linear space?
Question 4.11. Let Y be an absorbing set which is a metric linear space
? 569.
(resp. a convex subset of a metric linear space). Can Y be represented as a
linear subspace of R∞or ℓ2 (resp. a convex subset of R∞or ℓ2)?

§5]
Problems about σ-Compact Spaces
419
Question 4.12. Let Y be an absorbing set which is represented as a linear 570. ?
subspace of R∞. Can Y be represented as a linear subspace of ℓ2?
Of the absorbing sets of (2), (5)–(9), (11) and (12) in §2 we know that they
can be represented in ℓ2 as linear subspaces. It is not clear whether every
absorbing set of (10) in §2 also admits such a representation.
5. Problems about σ-Compact Spaces
We start with questions concerning possible generalizations of the statements
(i) and (ii) of the Classiﬁcation Theorem (F) to nonlocally convex spaces.
Question 5.1. Let W ∈(Rω)σ be an inﬁnite-dimensional convex subset of 571. ?
a complete metric linear space. Is W homeomorphic to σ?
Question 5.2. Let E be an R-universal σ-compact metric linear space that 572. ?
is an absolute retract. Is E homeomorphic to Σ?
The answer is positive if E contains an inﬁnite-dimensional compact convex
set (Curtis et al [1984]).
Question 5.3. Let E be a σ-compact metric linear space that is an absolute 573. ?
retract. Is E a C(E)-absorbing set?
Is it enough to check the strong C(E)-universality property of E (see Do-
browolski [1986b]).
To answer 5.1 in the aﬃrmative, it is enough to show that W is a countable
union of strong Z-sets (Curtis et al [1984]). In general, it is known that
W is a countable union of Z-sets (Dobrowolski [1986a]). It can be checked
that every Z-set in W is a strong Z-set if, additionally, the closure W of W is
either an absolute retract or nonlocally compact (cf. Dobrowolski [1986a]).
Here are the two most intriguing special cases:
Question 5.4. Let W = conv{xi}∞
i=1 be the convex hull of countably many 574. ?
vectors xi of a nonlocally convex metric linear space, so that W is inﬁnite-
dimensional. Is each conv{xi}n
i=1 a strong Z-set in W?
Question 5.5. Let W ∈(Rω)σ be a dense convex subset of Roberts’ compact 575. ?
convex set in Roberts [1976, 1977]. Is every Z-set in W a strong Z-set?
Let us note that there are examples of (everywhere nonlocally compact)
σ-compact convex sets W in ℓ2 such that not all compacta are Z-sets in W
(Curtis et al [1984]). Thus a suitable analogue of 5.2 for convex sets should
be:

420
Dobrowolski and Mogilski / Incomplete Metric Spaces
[ch. 25
Question 5.6. Let W be an R-universal σ-compact absolute retract convex
? 576.
subset of a complete metric linear space such that all compacta are Z-sets in
W. Is W homeomorphic to Σ?
An answer, except for the case where W is nonlocally compact (see Curtis
et al [1984]), is unknown even for W contained in ℓ2.
We now ask questions concerning a generalization of the Classiﬁcation The-
orem (F) to metric groups.
Question 5.7. Let G ∈(Rω)σ be an inﬁnite-dimensional contractible metric
? 577.
group. Is G homeomorphic to σ? (Equivalently, is G strongly Rω-universal
(Dobrowolski [1986b])?)
In particular we ask:
Question 5.8. Is a group G such as in 5.7 Rω-universal? It is even unknown
? 578.
whether G contains a disk.
An interesting special case of 5.7 is:
Question 5.9. Let G be the (additive) group generated by a linearly indepen-
? 579.
dent arc in ℓ2. Assume moreover that G is contractible. Is G homeomorphic
to σ?
Question 5.10. Let H be a nonlocally compact separable complete metric
? 580.
group that is an absolute retract. Is there a subgroup G of H which is a
Rω-absorbing set in H?
It is known that H is homeomorphic to R∞(Dobrowolski and Toru´nczyk
[1981]). Moreover, H contains a subgroup which is an R-absorbing set in H.
Question 5.11. Let G be an R-universal σ-compact absolute retract metric
? 581.
group. Is G homeomorphic to Σ?
The following are particular cases of 5.11:
Question 5.12. Let G be the (additive) group generated by a linearly in-
? 582.
dependent copy of the Hilbert cube in ℓ2. Assume moreover that G is con-
tractible. Is G homeomorphic to Σ?
Question 5.13. Let LIP∂(In) be the group of Lipschitz homeomorphisms of
? 583.
the n-dimensional cube In that ﬁx the boundary. Is LIP∂(In) homeomorphic
to Σ?

§5]
Problems about σ-Compact Spaces
421
It is known that there are countably many diﬀerent topological types of
σ-compact pre-Hilbert spaces (see Bessaga and Pelczy´nski [1975]). There-
fore it is reasonable to ask:
Question 5.14. Are there continuum many topologically diﬀerent σ-compact 584. ?
pre-Hilbert spaces?
Question 5.15.
For a σ-compact space X, let γ(X) be the inﬁmum of 585. ?
ordinals α such that X is the union of a countable family of subcompacta
all having transﬁnite dimension less than α. Does the equality γ(E) = γ(F),
where E and F are pre-Hilbert spaces, imply that E and F are homeomorphic?
Recall that the well-known “product” questions whether for every inﬁnite-
dimensional pre-Hilbert space E, the products E×R and E×E are homeomor-
phic to E, were solved in the negative by van Mill [1987a] and Pol [1984].
Since the counterexamples are far from being σ-compact, let us ask:
Question 5.16.
Let E be a σ-compact pre-Hilbert space. Is it true that 586. ?
{C × I: C ∈C(E)} ⊆C(E) or, respectively, {C × D: C, D ∈C(E)} ⊆C(E)?
If the answer is positive then E ×R or, respectively, E ×E are homeomorphic
to E (Dobrowolski [1989]).
A very interesting special case of 4.11 is:
Question 5.17. Is every σ-compact linear subspace E of R∞homeomorphic 587. ?
to a pre-Hilbert space V ?
To get an aﬃrmative answer, it is enough to ﬁnd a one-to-one map of E onto
V (Dobrowolski [1989]).
The σ-compact absorbing sets described in (2) and (6) are countable-
dimensional. It suggests the following question.
Question 5.18.
Find interesting (diﬀerent from Σ and from that of Do- 588. ?
browolski and Mogilski [19∞a, Ex. 4.4]) σ-compact absorbing sets which
are not countable-dimensional.
The last question is a speciﬁcation of 4.7.
Question 5.19.
Does every homeomorphism between ﬁnite-dimensional 589. ?
compacta of a nonlocally convex σ-compact metric linear space E extend
to a homeomorphism of the whole space E?

6. Problems about Absolute Borel Sets
In the previous section we have discussed σ-compact absorbing sets. In the
Borel hierarchy they represent the ﬁrst additive class U1. The condition (abs2)
implies that there are no M1-absorbing sets; however there are absorbing sets
in all higher classes (see (8) and (9) in §2). Let K be a linearly independent
compactum in ℓ2. Then for every A ⊆K with A ∈Uα or A ∈Uα \ Mα for
α ≥1 (respectively, A ∈Mα or A ∈Mα \ Uα for α ≥2), span(A) ∈Uα
or span(A) ∈Uα \ Mα (respectively, span(A) ∈Mα or span(A) ∈Mα \
Uα). It shows that all classes of absolute Borel sets are representable among
pre-Hilbert spaces (moreover taking the Cantor set as K we get countable-
dimensional pre-Hilbert spaces; see Bessaga and Pelczy´nski [1975]. In a
similar way we obtain a linear representation of the absorbing sets Λα and
Ωα in ℓ2.
Question 6.1.
Let Λα and Ωα be subsets of a linearly independent com-
? 590.
pactum in ℓ2. Are span(Λα) and span(Ωα) strongly universal for the classes
Uα and Mα, respectively?
Question 6.2. Let A ∈Mα \ Uα, α ≥2, be a subset of a linearly indepen-
? 591.
dent Cantor set in ℓ2. Is (span(A))∞homeomorphic to Ωα? Equivalently, is
(span(A))∞universal for Mα?
More generally, we ask:
Question 6.3. Let X ∈(Mα+1 \ Uα+1) ∪(Uα \ Mα), α ≥1, be an absolute
? 592.
retract which is a countable union of Z-sets. Is X∞homeomorphic to Ωα+1?
The answer is positive for α = 1 (Dobrowolski and Mogilski [19∞b]).
Question 6.4. Are there uncountably (continuum) many topologically dif-
? 593.
ferent pre-Hilbert spaces in each of the classes Mα \ Uα and Uα \ Mα, α ≥2?
Question 6.5. Let C = Mα or Uα, α ≥2, and let E be a pre-Hilbert space
? 594.
which is C-universal. Is E strongly C-universal?
At the beginning of this section we have described a way of obtaining pre-
Hilbert spaces of arbitrarily high Borel complexity. Now, we will present a
way of constructing Borelian linear subspaces of R∞. Let F be a ﬁlter on the
set of natural numbers N (i.e., F is a nonempty family of subsets of N such
that ∅̸∈F, S1 ∩S2 ∈F provided S1, S2 ∈F, and T ∈F provided S ⊆T for
some S ∈F). Then the space
cF = {(xi) ∈R∞: ∀ϵ > 0 ∃S ∈F ∀i ∈S |xi| < ϵ}

§6]
Problems about Absolute Borel Sets
423
is a linear subspace of R∞. If F, as a subset of the Cantor set 2N, is an absolute
Borel set of the class Mα+1 or Uα, then cF ∈Mα+1, α ≥1, and also cF is a
countable union of strong Z-sets. Moreover, if F ∈(Mα+1\Uα+1)∪(Uα\Mα),
α ≥1, then cF ∈Mα+1 \ Uα+1 (see Calbrix [1985, 1988], cf. Lutzer et
al [1985] and Dobrowolski et al [19∞]).
Question 6.6. Classify topologically the spaces cF for Borelian ﬁlters F.
595. ?
Question 6.7. Let F be a Borelian ﬁlter. Is cF an F0(cF)-absorbing set?
596. ?
Question 6.8. Let F ∈(Mα+1 \ Uα+1) ∪(Uα \ Mα), α ≥1, be a ﬁlter. Is 597. ?
cF homeomorphic to Ωα+1?
It is even unknown whether cF is Mα+1-universal. The answer is yes for
α = 1 (Dobrowolski et al [19∞]).
We say that a ﬁlter F on N is decomposable if F contains all coﬁnite subsets
of N and there exists inﬁnite disjoint sets N1 and N2 such that N = N1 ∪N2
and the family Fi = {S ∩Ni: S ∈F} is a ﬁlter equivalent to F, i = 1, 2.
It can be shown that for a decomposable ﬁlter F the space cF is strongly
F0(cF)-universal (more generally, for such a Borelian ﬁlter the spaces cF and
c∞
F are homeomorphic) (Dobrowolski et al [19∞]).
Question 6.9. Let F ∈(Mα+1\Uα+1)∪(Uα\Mα), α ≥1, be a decomposable 598. ?
ﬁlter. Is F0(cF) = Mα+1?
A positive answer to this question yields homeomorphy of cF and Ωα+1.
Question 6.10.
Let F1, F2 ∈(Mα+1 \ Uα+1) ∪(Uα \ Mα), α ≥1, be 599. ?
decomposable ﬁlters. Are the spaces cF1 and cF2 homeomorphic?
Question 6.11. Let F0 be the ﬁlter consisting of all coﬁnite subsets of N. 600. ?
Does there exist a homeomorphism h: R∞→(R∞)∞such that h(cF0) =
(R∞
f )∞= Ω2?
It is known that cF0 and Ω2 are homeomorphic (Dobrowolski et al [1990]
and Cauty [19∞]).
Some of the above questions are also interesting for ﬁlters which are not
Borel. Since, in general, the cF need not be of the ﬁrst category (Lutzer et
al [1985]) we can not expect that cF is an absorbing set. Anyway, we ask:
Question 6.12. Let F be a ﬁlter on N. Is cF strongly F0(cF)-universal? Is 601. ?
cF homeomorphic to c∞
F ?
Question 6.13.
Let F1, F2 be ﬁlters on N such that there are maps 602. ?

Are the spaces

We ﬁnish this section with some “product” questions.
Question 6.14. Let X be a retract of an inﬁnite-dimensional Borelian pre-

Hilbert space E. Is X × E homeomorphic to E?
In particular, we ask:
Question 6.15.
Is E × R, E × E or E∞
f
homeomorphic to E, for every
? 604.
inﬁnite-dimensional pre-Hilbert Borelian space E?
If E is a countable union of Z-sets (cf. 4.4) and E × E is homeomorphic to
E, then also E∞
f
(and hence E × R) and E are homeomorphic.
Question 6.16. Let X be a retract of an inﬁnite-dimensional Borelian pre-
? 605.
Hilbert space E. Is X × E∞homeomorphic to E∞?
To get a positive answer it is enough to show that E is a countable union of
Z-sets.
Question 6.17. Let X be a retract of a pre-Hilbert space of ﬁrst category.
? 606.
Is X × E∞homeomorphic to E∞?
There exists a pre-Hilbert space E such that E is of the second category while
moreover the space σ is a retract of E. Thus E∞is of second category while
σ × E∞is of the ﬁrst category (Pol [19∞]).
7. Problems about Finite-Dimensional Spaces

n and σk
n, respectively?
Question 7.7. Let X = σk
n, σk

n, where k ≥2n + 1 ≥m ≥n, and 613. ?
f: X →Y be a UV n−1-map of X onto Y ∈AE(n). Prove that for every
open cover U of Y there exists an open cover B of Y such that for every
homeomorphism h: A →B between two Z-sets in X, with f ◦h B-close to
f|A, there exists a homeomorphism H: X →X, with H|A = h and f ◦H
U-close to f.
8. Final Remarks
8.1. Nonseparable absorbing sets. Formally, the deﬁnition of absorbing set
does not require separability. Natural spaces to represent nonseparable ab-
sorbing sets in are the Hilbert spaces ℓ2(A) for uncountable A. The following
examples corresponds to (2) and (7) of our list of separable absorbing sets in
§2:
a. Example. The linear subspace
ℓf
2(A) = {(xα) ∈ℓ2(A): xα ̸= 0 for ﬁnitely many a ∈A}
is an absorbing set for the class of all ﬁnite dimensional metric complexes with
no more than card(A) vertices (see West [1970]).
b.
Example.
The linear subspace (ℓ2(A))∞
f
is an absorbing set for the
class of all complete metrizable spaces with density at most card(A) (see
Toru´nczyk [1970a]).
Almost all questions of the Sections 3, 4 and 6 can be repeated for non-
separable spaces.
Since two C-absorbing sets in ℓ2(A) are homeomorphic,

426
Dobrowolski and Mogilski / Incomplete Metric Spaces
[ch. 25
answers to these questions could throw light on the topological classiﬁcation
of nonseparable incomplete metric linear spaces.
8.2.
Noncontractible absorbing sets.
The notion of absorbing set can be
naturally extended to absolute neighborhood retracts represented in R∞-
manifolds. Some of the questions of Sections 3, 4 and 5 make sense for non-
contractible absorbing sets. Especially, questions 5.7–5.12, formulated in the
absolute neighborhood setting, seem to be very interesting.

What follows amounts, by and large, to an annotated combination of sev-
eral lists I have been hoarding, expanding, polishing the last few years. It is
highly personalized—the title topic is far too extensive to allow treatment of
all its various components, so I have not even tried. Instead, the combination
identiﬁes questions mainly in the areas of manifold structure theory, decom-
position theory, and embedding theory. The more signiﬁcant issues, and the
one I prefer, tend to occur where at least two of these intersect, but admit-
tedly several of the problems presented are light-hearted, localized, outside
any overlap.
Before launching out into those areas named above, however, and mindful
that the eﬀort undoubtedly will invite disputation, I cannot resist stealing
the opportunity to restate some of the oldest, most famous problems of this
subject. Occasional reiteration spreads awareness, and this occasion seems
timely, which is justiﬁcation enough. Accordingly, well-versed readers should
not expect to discover new material in the opening list of “Venerable Con-
jectures”; either they should skip it entirely or they can scan it critically for
glaring omissions or whatever.
Any other readers will beneﬁt, I trust, by
ﬁnding such a list in one convenient place.
The bibliography is intended as another convenience.
Extensive but by
no means complete, it is devised mainly to oﬀer recent entry points to the
literature.
At inception this project involved a host of mathematicians. Late one Ore-
gon summer night during the 1987 Western Workshop in Geometric Topology,
several people, including Mladen Bestvina, Phil Bowers, Bob Edwards, Fred
Tinsley, David Wright (their names would have been protected if they were
truly innocent), set out to construct a list of lesser known, intriguing problems
deserving of wider publicity. They all made suggestions, and I kept the record.
The evening’s discussion led directly to a number of the problems presented
here, which at one time constituted a separate list, but which in my tinkering
I eventually grouped under topic headings. (No one else deserves any blame
for my rearrangements.) If a question had strong support that evening for
inclusion in the collection of “not-famous-enough problems”, or if it just had
marginal support with no major opposition, it shows up here preceded by an
asterisk.
Other problems sets about ﬁnite dimensional manifolds published within
the past decade should be mentioned.
Here are a few.
The most famous
is Kirby’s list(s) of low dimensional problems [1978, 1984]; the ﬁrst install-
ment is a bit old, but the second, put together after the 1982 conference on
four-manifolds, includes a thorough update. Thurston [1982] has set forth
some fundamental open problems about 3-manifolds and Kleinian groups.
Much to my surprise, I could ﬁnd no major collection focused on knot the-
ory questions2, although many such appear in Kirby’s lists, and information

1. Venerable Conjectures
V1. Poincar´e Conjecture.
? 614.
V2. (Thurston’s Geometrization Conjecture) The interior of every compact 3-
? 615.
manifold has a canonical decomposition into pieces with geometric structure,
in other words, into pieces with structure determined by a complete, locally
homogeneous Riemannian metric.
See Thurston [1982]. Of relatively recent vintage, this conjecture probably
does not qualify as “venerable”; nevertheless, its boldness and large-scale
repercussions have endowed it with stature clearly suﬃcient to support its
inclusion on any list of important topological problems. It ﬁts here in part
by virtue of being stronger than the Poincar´e Conjecture. A closely related
formulation posits that every closed orientable 3-manifold can be expressed
as a connected sum of pieces which are either hyperbolic, Seifert ﬁbered,
or Haken (i.e., contains some incompressible surface and each PL 2-sphere
bounds a 3-ball there).
*V3.
(Hilbert-Smith Conjecture) No p-adic group can act eﬀectively on a
? 616.
manifold. Equivalently, no compact manifold M admits a self-homeomorphism
h such that
(i) each orbit {hn(x)} has small diameter in M and
(ii) {hn|n ∈Z} is a relatively compact subgroup of the group of all home-
omorphism M →M.
V4. (PL Schoenﬂies Conjecture) Every PL embedding of the (n−1)-sphere
? 617.
in Rn is PL standard, or equivalently, has image bounding a PL n-ball.
The diﬃculty is 4-dimensional: if true for n = 4 then the conjecture is true
for all n.
V5. There is no topologically standard but smoothly exotic 4-sphere.
? 618.

§1]
Venerable Conjectures
435
This is the 4-dimensional Poincar´e Conjecture in the smooth category,
and an aﬃrmative answer implies the truth of V4. In broader terms Don-
aldson [1987] has asked which homotopy types of closed 1-connected 4-
manifolds contain distinct smooth structures; speciﬁcally, do there exist ho-
motopy equivalent but smoothly inequivalent manifolds of this type such that
the positive part of the intersection form on 2-dimensional homology is even-
dimensional?
V6. (A problem of Hopf) Given a closed, orientable manifold M, is every 619. ?
(absolute) degree one map f: M →M a homotopy equivalence?
Hausmann [1987] has split this problem into component questions and has
provided strong partial results:
(1) must f induce fundamental group isomorphisms? and if so,
(2) must f induce isomorphisms of H∗(M; Zπ)?
Hopf’s problem led to the concept of Hopﬁan group, namely, a group in
which every self-epimorphism is 1-1.
V6’. Does every compact 3-manifold have Hopﬁan fundamental group?
620. ?
Yes, if Thurston’s Geometrization Conjecture is valid (Hempel [1987]).
V7. (Whitehead Conjecture; Whitehead [1941]) Every subcomplex of an 621. ?
aspherical 2-complex is itself aspherical.
V7’.
If K is a subcomplex of a contractible 2-complex, is π1(K) locally 622. ?
indicable (i.e., every nontrivial, ﬁnitely generated subgroup admits a surjective
homomorphism to Z).
Groups with this property are sometimes called locally Z-representible. As
mentioned in Howie’s useful survey Howie [1987], an aﬃrmative answer im-
plies the Whitehead conjecture.
V8. (Borel Rigidity Conjecture) Every homotopy equivalence N →M be- 623. ?
tween closed, aspherical manifolds is homotopic to a homeomorphism.
Evidence in favor of this rigidity has been accumulating ; see for example
the work of Farrell and Hsiang [1983] and Farrell and Jones [1986].
More generally, Ferry, Rosenberg and Weinberger [1988] conjecture:
every homotopy equivalence between aspherical manifolds which is a homeo-
morphism over a neighborhood of ∞is homotopic to a homeomorphism.

Daverman / Finite-dimensional manifolds
[ch. 26
This is viewed as unlikely, because it is stronger than the Poincar´e con-
jecture. Indeed, when restricted to special spines (where all vertex links are
circles with either 0, 2 or 3 additional radii) of homology 3-cells, it is equivalent
to the Poincar´e Conjecture (Gillman and Rolfsen [1983]). Cohen [1975]
introduced a related notion, saying that a complex X is q-collapsible pro-
vided X × Iq is collapsible, and he showed (among other things) that all con-
tractible n-complexes X are 2n-collapsible. Best possible results concerning
q-collapsibility are yet to be achieved, but Bernstein, Cohen and Con-
nelly [1978] have examples in all but very low dimensions (suspensions of
nonsimply connected homology cells) for which the minimal q is approximately
that of the complex.
V10. (Codimension 1 manifold factor problem (generalized Moore problem))
? 625.
If X × Y is a manifold, is X × R1 a manifold?
The earliest formulations of this problem, calling for X to be the image
of S3 under a cell-like map (see the decomposition section for a deﬁnition),
date back at least to the early 1960s; see Daverman [1980] for a partial
chronology. In the presence of the manifold hypothesis on X × Y , Quinn’s
obstruction theory Quinn [1987] ensures the existence of a cell-like map from
some manifold onto X × R1. When X × R1 has dimension at least 5, the
question is just whether it has the following Disjoint Disks Property: any
two maps of B2 into X × R1 can be approximated, arbitrarily closely, by
maps having disjoint images.
No comparably simple test detects whether
a 4-dimensional X × R1 is a manifold. Since X × R2 does have the Disjoint
Disks Property mentioned above, Edwards’ Cell-like Approximation Theorem
(Edwards [1980]) attests it is a manifold.
*V11. (Resolution Problem) Does every generalized n-manifold X, n ≥4,
? 626.
admit a cell-like resolution? That is, does there exist a cell-like map of some
n-manifold M onto X?
In one sense this has been answered—Quinn [1987] showed such a resolution
exists iﬀa certain integer-valued obstruction i(X) = 1—but in another sense it
remains unsettled because no one knows whether i(X) ever assumes a diﬀerent
value. A large measure of its signiﬁcance is attached to the consequent charac-
terization of topological manifolds: a metric space X is an n-manifold (n ≥5)
iﬀX is ﬁnite dimensional, locally contractible, H∗(X, X−x) ∼= H∗(Rn, Rn−0)
for all x ∈X (i.e., X is a generalized n-manifold), X has the Disjoint Disks
Property, and i(X) = 1. Is the ﬁnal condition necessary?
V12. (Kervaire Conjecture (also known as the Kervaire-Laudenbach Conjec-
? 627.
ture)) If A is a group for which the normalizer of some element r in the free
product A ∗Z is A ∗Z itself, then A is trivial.

§2]
Manifold and Generalized Manifold Structure Problems
437
The main diﬃculty occurs in the case of an inﬁnite simple group A. See
Howie’s survey Howie [1987] again for connections to other more obviously
topological problems.
2. Manifold and Generalized Manifold Structure Problems
A generalized n-manifold is a ﬁnite dimensional, locally compact, locally con-
tractible metric space X with H∗(X, X −x) ∼= H∗(Rn, Rn −0) for all x ∈X.
As Problems V10 and *V11 suggest, the central problems are
(1) whether every generalized manifold X is a factor of some manifold
X × Y and
(2) whether X × R1 is always a manifold.
Implications of homogeneity have not been fully determined, neither for
distinguishing generalized manifolds from genuine ones nor for distinguishing
locally ﬂat embeddings of codimension one manifolds from wild embeddings.
M1.
Does there exist a homogeneous compact absolute retract of dimen- 628. ?
sion 2 < n < ∞?
Bing and Borsuk [1965] shows that every homogeneous compact ANR (=
absolute neighborhood retract) of dimension n < 3 is a topological manifold.
M2. (Homogeneous ENRs versus generalized manifolds) If X is a homoge- 629. ?
neous, locally compact ENR (= ﬁnite dimensional ANR, is X a generalized
manifold?
According to Bredon [1970] (see alternatively Bryant [1987]), it is pro-
vided
H∗(X, X −x; Z)
is ﬁnitely generated for some (and, hence, for every) point x ∈X.
M2’. Does every compact ENR X contain a point x0 such that H∗(X, X−x0) 630. ?
is ﬁnitely generated?
M3. Is every homogeneous generalized manifold necessarily a genuine mani- 631. ?

No if the 3-dimensional Poincar´e Conjecture is false (Jakobsche [1980]),
but otherwise unknown.

Browder, have recent results.
M5.
If M is a compact manifold, is the group Homeo(M) of all self-

Ferry [1977] proved Homeo(M) is an ANR when M is a compact Hilbert

M6.
Is every closed, aspherical 3-manifold virtually Haken (have a ﬁnite-

sheeted cover by a Haken manifold)?
Even stronger, does it have a ﬁnite
sheeted cover by a manifold with inﬁnite ﬁrst homology?
*M7.
Is every contractible 3-manifold W that covers a closed 3-manifold
? 635.
necessarily homeomorphic to R3?
Here one should presume W contains no fake 3-cells (i.e., no compact, con-
tractible 3-manifolds other than 3-cells). Elementary cardinality arguments
indicate some contractible 3-manifolds cannot be universal covers of any com-
pact one, and Myers has identiﬁed speciﬁc examples, including Whitehead’s
contractible 3-manifold, that cannot do so. Davis’s higher dimensional ex-
amples Davis [1983], by contrast, indicate this is a uniquely 3-dimensional
problem.
Local connectedness of limit sets of conformal actions on S3. A group G
of homeomorphisms of the 2-sphere is called a discrete convergence group if
every sequence of distinct elements from G has a subsequence gj for which
there are points x, y ∈S2 with gj →x uniformly on compact subsets of
S2 −{x} (or, equivalently, G acts properly discontinuously on the subset of
S2 × S2 × S2 consisting of triples of distinct points of S2). Its limit set L(G)
is the closure of the set of all such points x.

Suppose W is a contractible n-manifold such that, for every compact C ⊆W,
there exists an essential map Sn−1 →W −C. Is W topologically equivalent

The Lusternik-Schnirelman category of a polyhedron P, written cat(P), is
the least integer k for which P can be covered by k open sets, each contractible
in P. See Montejano’s survey Montejano [1986] [19∞] for a splendid array
of problems on this and related topics. Here are two eye-catching ones.
*M14. Does cat(M × Sr) = cat(M) + 1?
642. ?
Singhof [1979] has answered this aﬃrmatively for closed PL manifolds
where cat(M) is fairly large compared to dim(M).
M15. If M is a closed PL manifold, does cat(M −point) = cat(M) −1?
643. ?
M16. (Ulam-problem #68 in The Scottish Book Mauldin [1981]) If M is a 644. ?
compact manifold with boundary in Rn for which every (n −1)-dimensional
hyperplane H that meets M in more than a point has H ∩∂M an (n −1)-
sphere, is M convex?3

M18. If X is a compact, n-dimensional space having a strongly convex metric 646. ?
without ramiﬁcations, is X an n-cell? What if X is a generalized manifold
with boundary? In that case, is X −∂X homogeneous?
For deﬁnitions see Rolfsen [1968], which solves the case n = 3.

Is there a complex dominated by a 2-complex but not homotopy 647. ?

3. Decomposition Problems
A decomposition G of a space X is a partition of X; it is upper semicontinuous
if each g ∈G is compact and for every open set U ⊇g there exists another
open set V ⊇g such that all g′ ∈G intersecting V are contained in U.
Associated with G is an obvious decomposition map π: X →X/G sending
x ∈X to the unique g ∈G containing x; here X/G has the quotient topology.
The study of upper semicontinuous decompositions of a space X coincides
with the study of proper closed mappings deﬁned on X, but the emphasis
is much diﬀerent. Decomposition theory stresses, or aims to achieve, under-
standing of the image spaces through information about the decomposition
elements.
All decompositions mentioned in this part are understood to be upper semi-
continuous.
A compact subset C of an ANR is cell-like if it contracts in every pre-
assigned neighborhood of itself, a property invariant under embeddings in
ANRs; equivalently, C is cell-like if it has the shape of a point. A decompo-
sition (a map) is cell-like if each of its elements (point inverses) is cell-like. A
decomposition G of a compact metric space X is shrinkable iﬀfor each ϵ > 0
there exists a homeomorphism H: X →X such that diamH(g) < ϵ for all
g ∈G and d(π, π H) < ϵ, where d is a metric on X/G; a convenient phras-
ing stems from the theorem (cf. Daverman[1986, p. 23]) showing G to be
shrinkable iﬀπ: X →X/G can be approximated, arbitrarily closely, by home-
omorphisms. All elements in a shrinkable decomposition of an n-manifold are
both cell-like and, better, cellular (i.e., can be expressed as the intersection
of a decreasing sequence of n-cells).
The initial questions concern conditions precluding a decomposition (or a
map) from raising dimension.
D1. The cell-like dimension-raising map problem for n = 4, 5, 6.
? 649.
Dranishnikov [1988] has described a cell-like map deﬁned on a 3-dimen-
sional metric compactum and having inﬁnite dimensional image; this example
automatically gives rise to another such map deﬁned on S7. On the other
hand, Kozlowski and Walsh [1983] showed no such map can be deﬁned
on any 3-manifold. What can happen between these bounds is still open,
although Mitchell, Repovˇs and Shchepin [19∞] have characterized the
ﬁnite dimensional cell-like images of 4-manifolds in terms of a disjoint ho-
mological disk triples property. See also the surveys by Dranishnikov and
Shchepin [1986] and, more recently, Mitchell and Repovˇs [1988].

Can a cell-like map deﬁned on Rn have inﬁnite dimensional image if
? 650.
all point-inverses are contractible? absolute retracts? cells? starlike sets?

manifold X have a cell-like resolution? Does X × R1 have such a resolution?
Independent of the Poincar´e Conjecture, is X the cell-like image of a “Jakob-
sche” 3-manifold (i.e., an inverse limit of a sequence of 3-manifolds connected
by cell-like bonding maps, as in Jakobsche [1980]). Thickstun [1987] ver-
iﬁed this for X having 0-dimensional nonmanifold set.
D6.
(Thickstun’s Full Blow-up Conjecture Thickstun [1987]) A compact 655. ?
homology n-manifold X is the conservative strongly acyclic, hereditarily π1-
injective image of a compact n-manifold if for each x ∈X there exists a
compact, orientable n-manifold Mx and a map (Mx, ∂Mx) →(X, X −{x})
inducing an isomorphism on n-dimensional ˇCech homology.
(Terminology: a homology n-manifold is a ﬁnite-dimensional, locally com-
pact metric space for which H∗(X, X −x) ∼= H∗(Rn, Rn −0): by way of
contrast, a generalized n-manifold is an ANR homology n-manifold. A map
is conservative if its restriction to the preimage of the manifold set is an em-
bedding; it is hereditarily π1-injective if its restriction to the preimage of any
connected open set induces an injection of fundamental groups; it is strongly
acyclic if for each neighborhood U of a point preimage f −1(x) there exists an-
other neighborhood V of f −1(x) such that inclusion induces the trivial homo-
morphism H∗(V ) →H∗(U).) Thickstun avers (Thickstun [1987]) this may
be an overly optimistic conjecture, since it implies the resolution conjecture
for generalized n-manifolds and, therefore, the 3-dimensional Poincar´e Con-
jecture as well. He adds that according to M. H. Freedman the 4-dimensional
case implies 4-dimensional topological surgery can be done in the same sense
it is done in higher dimensions.
D7.
(The Approximation Problem for 3- and 4-manifolds) Which cell-like 656. ?
maps p: M →X from a manifold onto a ﬁnite dimensional space can be
approximated by homeomorphisms? Is it suﬃcient to know that, given any
two disjoint, tame 2-cells B1, and B2 ⊆M, there are maps µi: Bi →X
approximating p|Bi with µ1(B1) ∩µ2(B2) = ∅?

Daverman / Finite-dimensional manifolds
[ch. 26
The question carries a degree of credibility because for n ≥5 the condition is
equivalent to X having the Disjoint Disks Property, which yields an aﬃrmative
answer, see Edwards [1980].
Next, some problems about shrinkability of cellular decompositions of man-
ifolds. The 3-dimensional version of each has been solved, all but D12 aﬃr-
matively.
*D8. Is each decomposition of Rn involving countably many starlike-equiv-
? 657.
alent sets shrinkable?
A compact set X ⊆Rn is starlike if it contains a point x0 such that every lin-
ear ray emanating from x0 meets X in an interval, and X is starlike-equivalent
if it can be transformed to a starlike set via an ambient homeomorphism.
Denman and Starbird [1983] have established shrinkability for n = 3.
D9. Let f: Sn →X be a map such that if f −1f(x) ̸= x, then f −1f(x) is a
? 658.
standardly embedded n-cell. Can f be approximated by homeomorphisms?
Same question when there are countably many nondegenerate f −1f(x), all
standardly embedded (n−2)-cells. Although closely related, these are not for-
mally equivalent. See Everett [1979] and Starbird and Woodruff [1979]
concerning n = 3.
D10. Suppose G is a usc decomposition of n-space such that each g ∈G has
? 659.
arbitrarily small neighborhoods whose frontiers are (n−1)-spheres missing the
nondegenerate elements of G? Is G shrinkable? What if the neighborhoods
are Euclidean patches?
Woodruff [1977] developed the low dimensional result.
D11.
Suppose A ⊆Rn is an n-dimensional annulus. Is there a parametriza-
? 660.
tion of A as a product Sn−1 × I for which the associated decomposition into
points and the ﬁber arcs is shrinkable?
Daverman and Eaton [1969] did this when n = 3; work by Ancel
and McMillan [1976] and Cannon and Daverman [1981] combines with
Quinn’s [1982] homotopy-theoretic characterization of locally ﬂat 3-spheres
in R4 to take care of A ⊆R4 as well.
D12.
Is a countable, cell-like decomposition G of Rn shrinkable if every
? 661.
nondegenerate g ∈G lies in some aﬃne (n −1)-hyperplane?

§3]
Decomposition Problems
443
In the case that all nondegenerate elements live in one of two predetermined
hyperplanes, Bing [1962] produced a remarkable 3-dimensional counterexam-
ple and Wright [1982] established shrinkability for n ≥5, but the matter is
unsolved for n = 4.
The rich variety of nonshrinkable decompositions of R3 is not matched in
higher dimensions; a plausible explanation is that descriptions of unusual 3-
dimensional examples rely in unreproducable fashion on real world visualiza-
tion experience. The next two problems point to 3-dimensional constructions
lacking higher dimensional analogs.
D13.
Consider any sequence {C(i)} of nondegenerate cellular subsets of 662. ?
Rn≥4. Does there exist a nonshrinkable, cellular decomposition of Rn whose
nondegenerate elements form a null sequence {g(i)} with g(i) homeomorphic
to C(i)?
Starbird’s [1981] 3-dimensional construction prompts the question.
D14.
Is there a nonshrinkable decomposition of n-space into points and 663. ?
straight line segments? Into convex sets?
Armentrout [1970] provided a 3-dimensional example, and later Eaton
[1975] demonstrated the nonshrinkability of an older example developed by
Bing.
Presented next are some uniquely 4-dimensional issues. Most are relatively
unpredictable in that, like the second half of D12, higher/lower dimensional
analogs transmit conﬂicting information.
D15.
If X is the cell-like image of a 3-manifold M, does X embed in M ×R? 664. ?
More technically, if G is a cell-like decomposition of R3, regarded as R3×0 ⊆
R4, and if G∗denotes the trivial extension of G (i.e., G∗consists of the
elements from G and the singletons from R4−(R3×0)), is R4/G∗topologically
R4? This must be true if V10 has an aﬃrmative answer.
D16. If X is a cellular subset of 4-space and G is a cell-like decomposition 665. ?
of X such that dim(X/G) ≤1, is the trivial extension of G over 4-space
shrinkable? What if X is an arc?
No to the latter when n = 3 by Row and Walsh [1985] and yes for the
former when n ≥5 by Daverman [1979b].
D17. Is each simple decomposition of R4 shrinkable?
666. ?

444
Daverman / Finite-dimensional manifolds
[ch. 26
Here one starts with a collection {Ni} of compact n-manifolds with bound-
ary in Rn, with Ni+1 ⊆Int Ni, and studies the decomposition consisting of
singletons and the components of  Ni. It is called simple if each component
Ci of each Ni contains a pair of n-cells B1, B2 such that every component
C′ of Ni+1 lies in either B1 or B2. The remarkable nonshrinkable decom-
position of Bing [1962] mentioned in D12 is simple, whereas the Cell-like
Approximation Theorem of Edwards quickly reveals shrinkability when n > 4
Daverman [1986, p. 185].
D18.
If f: S4 →S4 is a map which is 1-1 over the complement of some
? 667.
Cantor set K ⊆S4, is f cell-like? What if f is 1-1 over the complement of a
noncompact 0-dimensional set?
Yes by work of McMillan [1969] for n = 3, but counterexamples exist for
n > 4 Daverman [1979a].
D19.
Can every cellular map θ: P →Q between ﬁnite 4-complexes be ap-
? 668.
proximated by homeomorphisms?
Henderson [1982a, 1982b] produced approximations in the 3-dimensional
case and counterexamples in higher dimensions.
Finite dimensional compact metric spaces X, Y are CE-equivalent if they
are related through a ﬁnite sequence
X = X0 ↔X1 ↔· · · ↔Xm = Y,
where “Xi ↔Xi+1” requires the existence of a cell-like surjection of one
of the spaces onto the other.
In short, the deﬁnition is satisﬁed iﬀsome
compactum Z admits a cell-like, surjective mappings onto both X and Y .
Ferry [1980] shattered a suspicion that CE equivalences might behave like
simple homotopy equivalences; he also made repeated remarks suggesting a
closer connection if one restricts to LC1 spaces—see D22 below.
D20. If X and Y are n-dimensional, LCn−1 compacta that are shape equiv-
? 669.
alent, are they CE-equivalent?
Daverman and Venema [1987a] have taken care of the always-diﬃcult
n = 1 case.
D21.
(Ferry) If X and Y are shape equivalent LCk compacta, are they
? 670.
UV k-equivalent?
Here one seeks a compactum Z as a source for surjective UV k mappings
onto X and Y , where “UV k” means that each point preimage has the shape
of an i-connected object, i ∈{0, 1, . . ., k}.

D22.
If X and Y are CE-equivalent, LC1 compacta, are they related through 671. ?
a ﬁnite sequence as in the deﬁnition of CE equivalence above where, in ad-
dition, all intermediate spaces Xi are LC1?
What happens for homotopy
equivalent but simple homotopy inequivalent polyhedra X, Y ?
The relationship does hold for LC0 spaces, see Daverman and Venema
[1987b].
D23. (Kozlowski) Suppose X is the inverse limit of a sequence of homotopy 672. ?
equivalences S2 ←S2. Is X CE-equivalent to S2?
D24. Let K ⊆Rn denote a k-cell. Under what conditions can K be squeezed 673. ?
to a (k −1)-cell, in the sense that there is a map f: Rn →Rn from which
f|K is conjugate to the “vertical” projection Bk →Bk−1 while f|Rn −K is a
homeomorphism onto Rn −f(K). What if K is cellular? What if each Cantor
set in K is tame?
Bass [1980] provides a useful suﬃcient condition and raises several other
appealing questions.
D25.
Given a cell-like map f: M →X of an n-manifold onto a ﬁnite di- 674. ?
mensional space, can f be approximated by a new cell-like map F: M →X
such that each F −1(x) is 1-dimensional? Speciﬁcally, can this be done when
n ∈{3, 4, 5}?
D26. Is there a decomposition of Rn into k-cells (k > 0) into copies of some 675. ?
ﬁxed compact absolute retract (̸= point)?
See Jones [1968] and Walsh and Wilson [1981].
D27. Is there a decomposition of Bn into simple closed curves? of a compact 676. ?
contractible space? of a cell-like set?
D28. (Bestvina-Edwards) Does there exist a cell-like, noncontractible com- 677. ?
pactum whose suspension is contractible?
Standard Notation: M is an (n + k)-manifold; G is a usc decomposition
of M into closed connected n-manifolds; B is the decomposition space M/G;
and p: M →B is the decomposition map. For convenience assume both M
and all the elements of G are orientable.
Due to similarities imposed on the set of point preimages, one can regard
the study of these maps p: M →B as somewhat comparable to the study of
cell-like maps. At another level, when all point preimages are topologically

the same, one can strive for much more regular sorts of conclusions suggested
by the theory of ﬁbrations and/or locally trivial bundle maps.
D29. Is B an ANR? What if the elements of G are pairwise homeomorphic?
? 678.
D30. Is B ﬁnite-dimensional?
? 679.
(It deserves emphasis here that if the elements of G are not required to be
genuine manifolds but merely to be of that shape, a fairly common hypothesis
in this topic, the product of Sn with a Dranishnikov dimension-raising cell-
like decomposition of Sk quickly provides negative solutions.) What if the
elements of G are simple closed curves?
D31. For which integers n and k is there a usc decomposition of Sn+k into n-
? 680.
spheres? into n-tori? into ﬁxed products of spheres? Into closed n-manifolds?
Does Rn+k ever admit a decomposition into closed n-manifolds (n > 0)?
D32. When n and k are both odd, does every closed (n + k)-manifold M
? 681.
admitting a decomposition into closed n-manifolds have Euler characteristic
zero?
D33. If G is a usc decomposition of an (n + k)-manifold M into n-spheres,
? 682.
where 2 < n + 1 < k < 2n + 2, is M/G a generalized k-manifold? What if

Investigations when k < n + 1 and k = n + 1 are detailed in Daverman

D38.
When n = 3 and k = 1 does there exist a decomposition G of a 687. ?
connected M containing homotopy inequivalent elements?
Information from Daverman [1985] surrounds this 4-dimensional matter,
comparable to D15–D19.
D39. Does there exist a compact 5-manifold W having boundary components 688. ?
M0 and M1, where π1(M0) ∼= 1 and π1(M1) ∼= A5, the alternating group on
5 symbols, such that W admits a decomposition G into closed 4-manifolds
(with M0, M1 ∈G)? closed 4-manifolds (with M0, M1 ∈G)?
Daverman and Tinsley [19∞] locate W when H∗(M1) ∼= H∗(S4) but not
when π1(M1) is an arbitrary ﬁnitely presented perfect group.
D40. Given a closed manifold N, does some (n + k)-manifold M admit a 689. ?
decomposition into copies of N such that p: M →B is not an approximate ﬁ-

4. Embedding Questions
E1. (Free surface problem) Suppose Σ is an (n−1)-dimensional-sphere topo- 692. ?
logically embedded in Rn and for every ϵ > 0 there exists a map f: Σ →Int Σ
(Int Σ = bounded component of Rn −Σ) moving points less than ϵ. Is the
closure of Int Σ an n-cell?
The 3-dimensional case has withstood attack for over 25 years, and talented
people have mounted attacks. Any particular counterexample, under multiple
suspension, would give counterexamples in all larger dimensions.
E2. (Burgess’s “locally spanned in” problem) An (n −1)-sphere Σ ⊆Rn is 693. ?
said to be locally spanned in Int Σ if corresponding to each p ∈Σ and each

448
Daverman / Finite-dimensional manifolds
[ch. 26
ϵ > 0 is an (n −1)-cell D with p ∈Int D ⊆Σ such that for every γ > 0 there
exists an (n −1)-cell E ⊆Int Σ, where E has diameter less than ϵ, and also a
homeomorphism ∂D →∂E moving the points less than γ. Must Σ bound a
topological n-cell if it is locally spanned in Int Σ?
This is unknown even for n = 3, although Burgess [1965] gave an aﬃrma-
tive answer then provided Σ can be uniformly locally spanned in Int Σ (where
there exists δ > 0 such that for all (n −1)-cells D ⊆Σ of diameter less than
δ and for all γ > 0 one has an (n −1)-cell E as above). However, for n > 3
it is still unsettled whether ever this uniform property implies Σ bounds an
n-cell.
*E3. (Uniform tangent balls) Suppose Σ is an (n −1)-sphere topologically
? 694.
embedded in Rn and there exists a ﬁxed δ > 0 such that for each p ∈Σ there
exists a round n-cell Bp of radius δ satisfying
(i) p ∈Bp and
(ii) Int Bp ⊆Int Σ
Is the closure of Int Σ an n-cell?
The answer is aﬃrmative when n = 3 (Daverman and Loveland [1981]).
E4. (0-dimensional homotopy taming sets) Given a map ψ: B2 →C, where
? 695.
C denotes the closure of an (n −1)-sphere complement in Rn, can one ap-
proximate ψ arbitrarily closely by a map ψ: B2 →C such that dim(ψ(B2) ∩
Fr C) ≤0?
E5. (Homogeneity versus wildness for codimension 1 embeddings) If Σ is an
? 696.
(n−1)-sphere topologically embedded in Rn such that for any points p, q ∈Σ
there is a self-homeomorphism h of Rn with h(Σ) = Σ and h(p) = q, must Σ
be ﬂat?
What is Σ is strongly homogeneous? A subset of Rn is said to be strongly
homogeneous (or, better, strongly homogeneously embedded) if every self-
homeomorphism extends to a space homeomorphism.
E6. Is every strongly homogeneous Cantor set in R3 (R4) tame?
? 697.
Wild Cantor sets in Rn≥5 can be strongly homogeneously embedded Dav-
erman [1979a]; the familiar Antoine necklace is homogeneously embedded
but not strongly so in R3.
E7. Is there a wild Cantor set K in R4 deﬁned by contractible objects?
? 698.

§4]
Embedding Questions
449
Speciﬁcally, K is to be expressed as K =  Mi, where each Mi is a compact,
contractible manifold (with boundary) and Int Mi ⊇Mi+1.
*E8. (Sticky Cantor Set) If X is an arbitrary wild Cantor set in Sn, do there 699. ?
exist arbitrarily small homeomorphisms h of Sn to itself with X ∩h(X) = ∅?
A suﬃciently strong counterexample would provide a negative solution
to D11.
Despite the diﬀerence in context, several people believe the following is a
closely connected question.
E8’. (Wright) Does the Mazur 4-manifold M 4—a compact, contractible man- 700. ?
ifold with non-simply connected boundary—have a pair of disjoint spines?
A spine of M 4 is a polyhedron to which M 4 collapses.
E9. Are objects X ⊆Rn that can be instantaneously pushed oﬀthemselves 701. ?
geometrically tame?
The central issue is whether codimension 3 objects X are 1−LCC embedded
(i.e., can maps B2 →R3 be approximated by maps into Rn −X?). Here the
hypothesis calls for an ambient isotopy θt, starting at the identity, such that
X ∩θt(X) = ∅for all t > 0. Wright [1976] has shown that Cantor sets with
this property are tame.
E10. (“Approximating” compacta by Cantor sets) Let P be a compact subset 702. ?
of Rn and U ⊇P an open set. Must U contain a Cantor set C such that
all loops in Rn −U which are contractible in Rn −C are also contractible
in Rn −P?
For n = 3 this is not at all diﬃcult, for n = 4 it is harder (Daverman and
Lay have an unpublished construction), and otherwise it is still open.
E11. Let λ: X →M denote a closed embedding of a generalized n-manifold 703. ?
X in a genuine (n + 1)-manifold M. Can λ be approximated by 1 −LCC
embeddings?
Yes for n ≥4 (see Daverman [1985, p. 283]—key ideas are due to Can-
non, Bryant and Lacher [1979]); what about for n = 3? What if X is
a generalized n-manifold with boundary? Ancel discusses this and related
problems in Ancel [1986].
E12. Which homology n-spheres K bound acyclic (n + 1)-manifolds N such 704. ?

that π1(K) →π1(N) is an isomorphism? Is there a homology 4-sphere exam-
ple?
E13. Let X be a cell-like subset of Rn. Does Rn contain an arc α with Rn−α
? 705.
homeomorphic to R −X?
For n ≥6, Rn has a 1-dimensional compact subset A with Rn−A ≈Rn−X
(Nevajdi´c [19∞]).
E14. Can there be a codimension 3 cell D in Rn (n > 5) such that all 2-cells
? 706.
in D are wildly embedded in Rn but each arc (each Cantor set) there is tame?
This question calls for new embedding technology, since existing examples
(Daverman [1975]) in which all 2-cells are wild essentially exploit the pres-
ence there of Cantor sets wildly embedded in the ambient manifold.
E15. Can every n-dimensional compact absolute retract be embedded in R2n?
? 707.
E16. Can every Sn-like continuum be embedded in R2n?
? 708.
A metric space X is Sk-like if there exist ϵ-maps X →Sk for every ϵ > 0.

S4 −Σ is topologically S1 × R3 but not smoothly so?

Here we consider four types of problems for compact metric spaces which
are of current interest in shape theory.
Earlier lists of problems include
Ball [1976], Borsuk [1975], Dydak, Kadlof and Nowak [1981], Ge-
oghegan [1979], Krasinkiewicz [1981], and Mardeˇsi´c and Segal [1987].
1. Cohomological and shape dimensions
Problem 1.1.
Suppose a metrizable and separable space X is the union 711. ?
of two of its subsets A and B whose cohomological dimensions cdimZ A and
cdimZ B are ﬁnite. Is the cohomological dimension of X ﬁnite? If cdimZ X is
ﬁnite does the inequality
cdimZ X ≤cdimZ A + cdimZ B + 1
hold?
Yes, if dim A is ﬁnite. The second part of the above problem was asked by
V. I. Kuz′minov in [1968] for any group G.
Problem 1.2.
Suppose f: X →Y is a closed map of metrizable spaces 712. ?
such that cdimZ X ≤n and there exist natural numbers m and k such that
rank(H∗(f −1(y)) ≤m and card(Tor H∗(f −1(y))) ≤k for all y ∈Y . Is the
cohomological dimension of Y ﬁnite?
Problem 1.3. Is there a compact ANR-space X of inﬁnite dimension such 713. ?
that its cohomological dimension cdimG X with respect to some non-trivial
group G is ﬁnite?
Recently, in [1988], A. N. Dranishnikov found an inﬁnite-dimensional
compactum X of cohomological dimension 3. It is known that cdimZ X ≤1
implies dim X = 1.
Problem 1.4. Is there an inﬁnite-dimensional compactum X of cohomolog- 714. ?
ical dimension 2?
Let PSn be the Postnikov n-sphere. It is the inverse limit of the Postnikov
system (see Spanier [1966, p.444]) {Ei, pi+1
i
} of Sn (i.e. πk(Ei) = 0 for k ≥i,
each bonding map pi+1
i
is a ﬁbre bundle with the ﬁbre being a K(πi, mi))
and there is a weak homotopy equivalence h: Sn →PSn. In [1988] A. N.
Dranishnikov proved that any continuous map f: A →PSn, A being a
closed subset of a compactum X with cdimZ X ≤n, extends over X. He
posed the following problem:
Problem 1.5. Suppose for any closed subset A of a given compactum X and 715. ?

[ch. 27
for any map f: A →PSn there is an extension f ′ over X. Is the cohomological
dimension of X at most n?
Problem 1.6. Suppose f: M n →X is a map from a closed n-manifold onto
? 716.
an ANR of ﬁnite dimension such that all the ﬁbers are of the same shape. Is
it true that the ˇCech cohomology of the ﬁbers is ﬁnitely generated?
Problem 1.7.
(D. R. McMillan) Given an Euclidean space En is there a
? 717.

iﬀall the maps f: X →Pn are null-homotopic?
Yes, if n ≤3.
Problem 1.8. Given a natural number n is there a ﬁnite polyhedron Pn such
? 718.

Problem 1.10.
Is the shape dimension of X × S1 equal to 3 for every
? 720.
movable X with Sd X = 2?

Problem 2.1. (J. Krasinkiewicz [1981], D. R. McMillan [1975]) Is a
? 721.
movable continuum pointed movable?
Problem 2.2. If the wedge X ∨Y of two continua is movable, is X pointed
? 722.
movable?
Yes, if pro-π1Y is not trivial.
As deﬁned by S. Mardeˇsi´c in [1981] a compactum X is an approximate
polyhedron (AP) if for each ε > 0 there is a polyhedron P and maps f: X →P,
g: P →X such that the distance d(gf(x), x) is less than ε for all x in X.
Problem 2.3. (Dydak and Segal [1981a]) Is X ∈AP pointed 1-movable?
? 723.
Yes, if X has the ﬁxed point property or its Euler characteristic (deﬁned
using the ˇCech homology groups) does not equal 0.

§2]
Movability and polyhedral shape
461
A compactum is called regularly movable provided it is the inverse limit of an
inverse sequence of ANR’s with bonding maps being homotopy dominations.
Problem 2.4. (Dydak and Segal [1981a]) Is X ∈AP regularly movable?
724. ?

725. ?
Problem 2.6. Is a movable continuum X regularly movable if pro-π1X is 726. ?
trivial?
Problem 2.7. (J. Krasinkiewicz [1981]) Does every non-movable contin- 727. ?
uum X contain a non-movable curve?
Problem 2.8. (D. R. McMillan [1975]) Suppose A × B is embeddable in 728. ?

Yes, if pro-π1X is equivalent to a group.
A compactum X is called an ANR-divisor provided Q/X ∈ANR, where
Q is the Hilbert cube.
Problem 2.12. Suppose X is an ANR-divisor and pro-π1X is trivial. Is 732. ?
there a polyhedron of the same shape as X?
Yes, if (a) Sd X is ﬁnite, (b) X is movable, or (c) X is acyclic.
Problem 2.13. If X and Y are ANR-divisors is X × Y an ANR-divisor?
733. ?
Problem 2.14. If X is shape dominated by an ANR-divisor is it an ANR- 734. ?

Yes, if Sd X is ﬁnite.

ﬁbers are closed k-manifolds and dim X is ﬁnite. Is X an ANR?

462
Dydak and Segal / Shape Theory
[ch. 27
The above problem is related to work of Daverman and Walsh [1987]
(which was the culmination of the previous eﬀorts of Coram-Duvall and Liem)
on upper semicontinuous decompositions of a manifold M n into closed, con-
nected k-manifolds. The primary question in that area is: Under what con-
ditions is the decomposition space a generalized (n −k)-manifold?
Problem 2.16.
A map f: X →Y of compacta has the property that for
? 736.
each n > 0 there is a map fn: Y →X with dist(f ◦fn, idY ) < 1/n. Is Y an
ANR if X is an ANR?
Yes, if Y ∈LC1.
Problem 2.17. Let X be a homogeneous ANR of ﬁnite dimension. Is it a
? 737.
generalized manifold?
Problem 2.18. Is there a homogeneous contractible ANR of ﬁnite dimen-
? 738.
sion?
Problem 2.19. (J. Bryant [19∞]) Suppose X is an ANR of ﬁnite dimen-
? 739.
sion and k ≥1. Is there a point x in X such that Hk(X, X −{x}; Z) is ﬁnitely
generated?
Problem 2.20.
Suppose X is an ANR such that for some integer n,
? 740.
Hk(X, X −{x}) is trivial for k ̸= n and Hn(X, X −{x}) ≈Z for all x in
X. Is the dimension of X ﬁnite?
3. Shape and strong shape equivalences
An inclusion i: A →X is called a shape equivalence if every map g from A to
a CW complex K extends uniquely over X up to homotopy.
An inclusion i from A to X is called a strong shape equivalence if both i and
the inclusion from A to the double mapping cylinder DM(i) of i are shape
equivalences.
A map f: X →Y is called a shape equivalence (strong shape equivalence) if
the inclusion from X to the mapping cylinder M(f) of f is a shape equivalence
(strong shape equivalence).
Problem 3.1. Is every shape equivalence a strong shape equivalence?
? 741.
Problem 3.2.
(J. Dydak and J. Segal [1981b]) Suppose A is a closed
? 742.
subset of a compact space X and f and g are maps from X to K coinciding
on A, where K is a CW complex. If the inclusion from A to X is a shape
equivalence and f|A = g|A, is f homotopic to g rel. A?

§3]
Shape and strong shape equivalences
463
Problem 3.3.
(J. Dydak and J. Segal [1981b]) Suppose A is a closed 743. ?
subset of a compact space X and f: A →Y is a shape equivalence. Is the
natural projection p: X →Y ∪f X a shape equivalence?
Problem 3.4. Suppose a map f: X →Y is a shape equivalence and x is a 744. ?
point in X. Is the map f from (X, x) to (Y, f(x)) a pointed shape equivalence?
See Dydak and Geoghegan [1982, 1986] for partial answers to this prob-
lem.
Problem 3.5.
Let the shape dimension of a compactum X be ﬁnite. Is 745. ?
there a shape equivalence f: X →Y (f is a map) where the dimension of Y
is ﬁnite?
Problem 3.6. Suppose f: M →X is a shape domination (i.e. fg = idX for 746. ?
some shape morphism g: X →M) and Sd X ≥n. Is f a shape isomorphism?
Problem 3.7. Given a space X, is there a strong shape equivalence f from 747. ?
X to Y such that for any space Z the natural function from [Z, Y ] (= the set
of homotopy classes of maps from Z to Y ) to SSh(Z, Y ) (= the set of strong
shape morphisms from Z to Y ) is a bijection?
The above problem is closedly related to a problem of Ferry [1980] on
improving compacta. A compactum X is improved (resp. n-improved) iﬀ
for all compacta Z (resp. of dimension ≤n) [Z, X] →SSh(Z, X) is a bijec-
tion. In [1980] S. Ferry has given conditions on X which imply it is shape
equivalent to an n-improved compactum for each n. S. Zdravkovska has
shown in [1981] that the wedge of S1 and the 2-dimensional Hawaiian ear-
ring is not shape equivalent to a 1-improved compactum. We do not know
if this space is equivalent to an improved space.
Finally, Geoghegan and
Krasinkiewicz (unpublished) have shown that the Case-Chamberlain contin-
uum is not equivalent to a 0-improved compactum. In case the answer to it is
positive one would get that the strong shape category SSH can be obtained
by localizing the homotopy category HT OP at strong shape equivalences (see
Dydak and Nowak [19∞] for a more detailed discussion).
Problem 3.8. Suppose i: X →Y is the inclusion of continua such that both 748. ?
X and Y/X are of polyhedral shape. Is i a shape equivalence if it induces
isomorphisms of all homotopy pro-groups?
Problem 3.9.
Suppose f: X →Y is a cell-like map and {An}∞
n=1 is a 749. ?
sequence of compacta in Y satisfying the following properties:
(a) f|f −1(A): f −1(A) →A is a shape equivalence whenever A is contained
in one of the An’s.

(b) f −1(y) is a one-point set for every y ∈Y −∞

Is f a shape equivalence?
Yes, if Y =
∞

An.
4. P-like continua and shape classiﬁcations
A mapping f: X →Y of a compactum X onto a compactum Y is said to be
an ε-mapping if the sets f −1(y) have diameters less than ε for all y in Y . A
compactum X is said to be Y -like if for every ε > 0 there exists an ε-mapping
of X onto Y . In [1963] and [1967] S. Mardeˇsi´c and J. Segal investigated
the notion of P-like continua where P is a polyhedron or, in particular, a
manifold. The following P-like continua have been classiﬁed up to shape:
(1) for P = Sn, Mardeˇsi´c and Segal [1971],
(2) for P = P n, real projective n-space, Handel and Segal [1973b],
(3) for P a ﬁnite wedge of Moore spaces of type (Zp, m), with m ≥3 and
p an odd prime, Handel and Segal [1973a],
(4) for P = T n, the n-dimensional torus, Keesling [1973] and Eberhart,
Gorhd and Mack [1974], and
(5) for P = CP n, n-dimensional complex projective space, Watanabe
[1974].
In contrast to the above cases where the cardinality of the shape classes is
inﬁnite, D. Handel and J. Segal, in [1973a], show that for each positive
integer n there is a polyhedron Pn−1 such that the number of shape classes
of Pn−1-like continua is exactly n.
In addition, A. Trybulec [1973] classiﬁed the movable curves up to shape.
L. S. Husch [1983] enlarged the class B of iterated 1-bouquets of 2-manifolds
to the class Bf of all ﬁnite connected coverings of elements of B and showed
that some Bf-like continua have simple shape. A. Kadlof [1977] obtained
several results concerning the shape groups, ˇCech homology and cohomology
groups of P-like compacta.
In [1973a] and [1974] Handel and Segal show that for a given polyhe-
dron P, the numeration of the shapes of P-like continua depends only on the
algebraic structure of the semigroup [P, P] of homotopy classes of maps of
P into itself under composition. So what is required is an algebraic descrip-
tion of shape classiﬁcation of sequences in semigroups patterened after the
ANR-system formulation of shape as in Mardeˇsi´c and Segal [1971].
Segal [1973] asked the following the question concerning manifold-like con-
tinua (as well as problem 4.2 which is related).
Problem 4.1. Is the cardinality of the set of shape classes of continua which
? 750.
are like a closed manifold M necessarily uncountable?

Problem 4.2. For a closed manifold M must the set [M, M] of homotopy 751. ?
classes of maps of M into itself be inﬁnite?
Kadlof [1977] raised the following two questions concerning P-like com-
pacta.
Problem 4.3. If (X, x0) is a movable P-like compactum with ﬁnitely gener- 752. ?
ated ﬁrst shape group π1 (X, x0), then is X an FANR?
Problem 4.4. If X is P-like and the ﬁrst shape group π1 (X, x0) is ﬁnitely 753. ?
generated is the nth shape group πn (X, x0) countable for n = 1, 2, . . .?

1. Introduction
The following list of problems was collected at the 1986 Arcata Conference on
algebraic topology, preceding the International Congress of Mathematicians in
Berkeley. The period leading up to this conference was a particularly exciting
one in algebraic topology, and it is hoped that these problems, collected by
J. F. Adams, W. Browder and myself, will stimulate further advances in the
area. I wish to thank all the contributors to the list.
2. Problem Session for Homotopy Theory: J. F. Adams
1. (A. Adem) Let G be a ﬁnite p-group. If Hn(G; Z) has an element of order 754. ?
pr, for some value of n, does the same follow for inﬁnitely many n?
Recall that a group P is perfect P = [P, P]. Let PG be the maximal perfect
subgroup of G.
2. (J. Berrick) Consider ﬁbrations F →E →B of connected spaces, where 755. ?
Pπ1E = 1 and F is of ﬁnite type. If H∗(F; Z) →E+ →B+ is iso, does it
follow that π1B = 1?
This question arises from the consideration of “plus-constructive ﬁbrations”,
i.e., those for which F + →E+ →B+ is also a ﬁbration.
3. (F. Cohen) Let [2]: Sn →Sn be a map of degree 2. When is Ωq[2]: ΩqSn →756. ?
ΩqSn homotopic to the H-like squaring map 2: ΩqSn →ΩqSn?
If q = 1, it is so iﬀn = 1, 3, 7. If q = 2, it can only be so if n = 2k −1; what
happens in this case? What happens for q = 3, n = 5?
Call a p-group P “necessary” if there is a non-zero class x ∈H∗(P; Z/(p))
which restricts to zero on all proper subgroups of P.
4. (M. Feshbach) Can one give a useful alternative description of the necessary 757. ?
p-groups?
Conjecture: for p = 2, P is necessary iﬀevery element of order 2 is central,
i.e., iﬀP contains a unique maximal elementary abelian 2-subgroup and this
subgroup is contained in the centre of P. (The obvious generalisation of this
conjecture to p odd is false.)
5. (B. Gray) For which values n, r is the ﬁbre Wn,r of the iterated suspension 758. ?
map Sn →ΩrSn+r, localised at p = 2, an H-space?
471

472
Carlsson / Algebraic Topology
[ch. 28
For p odd one should assume n even and replace Sn by the subspace Sn
p−1 of
the James construction; one then asks if the ﬁbre is a double loop space.
6. (B. Gray) Suppose Φ: Ω2S2np+1 →S2np−1 satisﬁes
? 759.
(a) Φ|S2np−1 has degree p (> 2).
(b) The composition
Ω2 S2n+1 ΩHp
−→Ω2 S2np+1 Φ→S2np−1
is nullhomotopic.
Is it then true that the composition
Ω3 S2np+1 ΩΦ
→ΩS2np−1 Σ3
→Ω3 S2np+1
is the triple loops on the degree p map?
7.
(K. Ishiguro) Let π be a ﬁnite group and G a compact Lie group. Is
? 760.
[Bπ, BG] a ﬁnite set? Let πp run over the Sylow p-subgroups of π. Is the
map
[Bπ, BG] →

p
[Bπp, BG]
injective?
8. (N. Kuhn) Find conditions on X and Y such that
? 761.
XK(n) ≈YK(n) ∀n ≥1 implies X ≈Y.
(Here K(n) is the nth Morava K-theory.)
9.
(N. Kuhn after D.C. Ravenel) Are all suspension spectra E harmonic
? 762.
(meaning that E is 
n≥0 K(n)-local)?
10. (N. Kuhn) Describe the equivariant cobordism MU ∗

ariant version of Landweber’s “exact functor” theorem.
11.
(N. Kuhn) Set up equivariant K(n)∗, E(n)∗and prove a “completion

theorem” for these theories.
12.
(N. Kuhn) Find good models for the inﬁnite loop spaces representing

complex-oriented cohomology theories as K(n)∗, E(n)∗.
Work of Barratt, Mahowald and Jones (The Kervaire invariant and the
Hopf invariant, to appear in the Proceedings of the emphasis year in Seattle)
leaves the following conjecture open:

13. Conjecture (M.E. Mahowald). If α ∈π2j−2 represents a framed mani- 766. ?
fold with Kervaire invariant one, then the composite
QS0
S→QP →Ω∞P ∧J
where S is the Snaith map, induces a nonzero map on α.
The conjecture is true if α has order 2. Also, there are other Kervaire in-
variant questions in the Proceedings of the Northwestern 1982, Contempory
Mathematics AMS vol. 19.
In numerical analysis it is often very useful to consider diﬀerences in a
sequence to gain understanding of how the sequence is put together. In topol-
ogy, diﬀerences might be constructed to be ﬁber of a map which is an iso-
morphism in the ﬁrst non-zero dimension of both spaces. Thus, the EHP
sequence tells us that, at the prime 2, the diﬀerence between Sn and ΩSn+1
is ΩS2n+1. Let W(n) be the diﬀerence between S2n−1 and Ω2S2n+1. Work
in Mahowald [1975] shows that each of the spaces W(n) has a resolution
by K(Z/2, n)’s which is a good approximation to the Adams resolution for
the stable Z/2 Moore space. Using the above language, the diﬀerence be-
tween W(n) and Ω4W(n + 1), which we call X(n), is constructed and shown
to have a resolution which has many properties of the stable resolution of
a spectrum whose cohomology is free on one generator over the subalgebra,
A1, of the Steenrod algebra generated by Sq1 and Sq2. It would be inter-
esting to construct a map from X(n) to the omega spectrum having as its
stable cohomology an appropriate A1. To do this at the chain level in the
Λ-algebra sense, as was done in Mahowald’s paper above, would already be
very interesting.
14.
Conjecture (M. E. Mahowald).
The diﬀerence between the X(n)’s 767. ?
approximates A2 and the diﬀerences between these diﬀerences approximates
A3, etc.
15. (M. E. Mahowald) Let Cn be the ﬁber of Ω2n+1S2n+1 →Ω∞P 2n ∧J. 768. ?
Find a stable space Bn and a map Cn →QBn which is a v2 equivalence.
Bn could be a subspace of the space L(2) of Mitchell and Priddy.
16. (M. E. Mahowald) The work of Devinatz, Hopkins and Smith suggests 769. ?
that the Freyd generating hypothesis is now approachable.
Let G be a ﬁnite p-group, X a ﬁnite G-complex, SX its singular subspace.
If G has order pe, then
Σ(pe −1)idim Hi(SX, Zp) ≤Σ(pe −1)idim Hi(X, Zp).

[ch. 28
17. (J .P. May) Are there other such generalizations of Smith theory?
? 770.
The point is that the homotopical structure of ﬁnite G-complexes is much
more restricted than Smith theory alone dictates.
18. (J. P. May) Give an algebraic analysis of the rationalized stable category
? 771.
of G-spaces.
Rational G-spectra fail to split as products of Eilenberg-MacLane G-spectra
for general compact Lie groups G, although this does not hold for ﬁnite G.
19.
(J. P. May) Let H ⊆J ⊆K ⊆G, where G is a compact Lie group.
? 772.
Suppose q(H, p) = q(K, p). Is q(J, p) = q(H, p)?
This is one of many questions involving the complextity of the lattice of closed
subgroups of G.
Let BGΠ be the classifying G-space for principle (G, Π)-bundles. For a G-
cohomology theory h∗
G, h∗
G(BGΠ) gives all h∗
G-characteristic classes for (G, Π)-
bundles.
20. (J. P. May) Calculate these groups in interesting cases.
? 773.
When h∗
G is Borel cohomology, complete information is easily obtained and
is quite unilluminating. When h∗
G is stable cohomology or K-theory, a com-
plete theoretical answer has been obtained (Adams, Haeberly, Jackowski, May,
1985) via generalizations of the Segal conjecture and the Atiyah-Segal com-
pletion theorem. When Π is Abelian, BGΠ ≈BΠ × K(R, 0), R(G/H) =
Hom(H, Π), and the Bredon cohomology of BGΠ is computable. This casts
doubt on methods based on reduction to a maximal torus.
The Borel construction on (G, Π)-bundles corresponds to a G-map
α: BGΠ →Map(EG, BΠ).
When G and Π are discrete or when G is compact Lie and Π is Abelian
compact Lie, α is a G-homotopy equivalence. When G is a ﬁnite p-group and
Π is a compact Lie group, Dwyer’s results show, essentially, that α is a p-adic
equivalence.

(For background and discussion of (22), (23) see Quinn [19∞].)
Let A be the ring of integers in a ﬁnite extension of the p-adic numbers
Qp. A formal A-module F over an A-algebra R is a formal group law over R
equipped with power series [a](x) for each a ∈A satisfying
(i) [1](x) = x;
(ii) [a1 + a2](x) = F([a1](x), [a2](x));
(iii) [a](x) ≡ax mod x2.
There is a well developed theory of such sets beginning with Lubin-Tate’s
work on local class ﬁeld theory. In particular there is a universal p-typical
formal A-module deﬁned over an A-algebra VA which is explicitly known and
which is a BP∗-module.
24. (D. C. Ravenel) Is there a spectrum SA such that BP ∗(SA) = VA?
777. ?
If the answer is yes then the Novikov E2-term for SA has many interesting
properties. SA is known to be an Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum when the ﬁeld
is algebraically closed. The spectrum SA ∧BP has been announced in many
cases by A. Pearlman.
T (n) is a spectrum with BP∗T (n) = BP ∗[t1, t2 · · · tn]. It ﬁgures in the
proof of the nilpotence theorem.
It is not diﬃcult to compute the Adams-Novikov E2-term for T (n) through
dimension 2(p2 + 1)(pn+1 −1). It is roughly this dimension that the ﬁrst
possible nontrivial diﬀerential occurs. In the case n = 0 this is the Toda
diﬀerential which kills α1βp, for p > 2.
25. (D. C. Ravenel) For n > 0, is this diﬀerential nontrivial?
778. ?
The usual extended power constructions do not settle the question.
For p > 2, β1 ∈πS
2p2−2p−2 is the ﬁrst even dimensional stable homotopy
element in positive dimensions.
26. (D. C. Ravenel) Find the smallest k such that βk
1 = 0.
779. ?
Toda showed (< 1970?) that k ≤p2 −p + 1 for all p > 2.
For
p = 3,
k = 6,
(Toda)
for
p = 5,
k = 18.

For a ﬁnite group G, the Segal Conjecture tells us that the stable cohomo-
topy group [BG, S0] is the completed Burnside ring of G, A(G)∧. Let LnS0
denote the Bousﬁeld localization of S0 with respect to ν−1
n BP. Let FnA(G)∧
denote the kernel of the map
A(G)∧= [BG, S0] →[BG, LnS0].
The problem is to determine the ideals Fn.

functor of K(n) ∗X or by showing that a suitable Eilenberg-Moore spectral
sequence converges.
McClure has done this for n = 1 and k = ∞. For n = 1 and k < ∞one could
then prove that the Smith map

is a K(1)∗-equivalence.

Arcata conference.)

H∗(B; Q) = Q[Xn1, . . . , Xnr]
where [n1, . . . , nr] = [4, 4, 48, 8, 812, 12, 16, 16, 20, 24, 24, 28]?

4. K and L-theory
4.1. J. Milgram, L. Taylor, B. Williams
The Quinn-Ranicki assembly map has been attacked by a factorization which
we can deﬁne on bordism as follows. There are pairings
L∗(Z[s]π) ⊗C →L∗+1∓1(Zπ)
(∗)
where C± is the knot group of S4k∓1 →S4k±1 (k ≥2) and the involution
on Z[s] is s →1 −s. Moreover, there is a “symmetric signature” Ω∗(Bπ) →
L∗(Z[s]π) such that the composite of the “symmetric signature” ⊗{trefoil
knot} is the obstruction to M × (Kervaire problem). The E8 knot S3 →S5
gives the obstruction to M × (Milnor problem).
A) Explain the presence of the knot group in the pairings (∗).
? 796.
In dimension 3 surgery can be done on homology though we don’t have
control of π1 of the resulting manifold. For example, results of Madson and
Milgram on the spaceform problem for the groups Q(8p, q, 1), (p, q) = 1, p, q
prime, show that for certain pairs such as (17, 133), the surgery obstruction
is trivial. Hence there exists a homology 3-sphere M 3 with a free action of
Q(136, 113, 1).
B) Find explicit examples of such actions. In particular what kinds of π1
? 797.
occur for M 3?
If π is ﬁnite, then the reduced surgery obstruction map
¯σ: Ωn(Bπ × G/TOP) →L′
n(Zπ)/Ln(Z)
factors through 4
i=1 Hi(π, Z/2). Here “ ′ ” denotes
ker(Wh1(Zπ) →Wh1(Qπ)).
C(a) Does ¯σ factor through 3
i=1 Hi(π; Z/2)?
? 798.
C(b) Determine the corresponding Ls-results.

D) Understand the relationship between L-theory and Hermitian K-theory

H→K Herm(R, α, ϵ) →L∗(R, α, ϵ),

Karoubi periodicity implies this conjecture is true when 1
2 ∈R. The hyper-
bolic map H: K(R) →K Herm(R, α, ϵ) factors through ˜H.
4.2. V. Snaith
A ﬁnite dimensional representation of a ﬁnite Galois group, G(L/K), where
L/K is a local ﬁeld extension is called a Galois representation. The Deligne-
Langlands local constants are homomorphisms WK: R(G(L/K)) →S1. (See
Tate: Proceedings of the Durham conference (1977), editor A. Fr¨olich.)
I have a general formula for WK(ρ) which is partially topological, partially
number theoretic, and very complicated. However, if ρ: G(L/K) →Un(C) is
the complexiﬁcation of ρ′: G(L/K) →On(R), Deligne [1976] showed that
WK(ρ) = SW2[ρ′] · WK(det ρ) ∈{±1, ±
√
−1}
where SW2[ρ] ∈H2(K; Z/2) ∼= {±1}.
Hence on RSO(G(L/K)), WK is
ISO(G(L/K))-adically continuous, in fact WK(ISO(G(L/K))3 = {1}.
On
RSp(G(L/K)), the symplectic representation ring, WK is {±}-valued.
Question. Is WK trivial on some IO(G(L/K)N · RSp(G(L/K))?
801. ?
5. Manifolds & Bordism
5.1. P. Gilkey
The eta invariant of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer deﬁnes maps
η: ˜K(S2k−1/G) ⊕˜K(S2n−1/G) →Q/Z
η: ˜ΩU
∗(BG) ⊕R0(G) ⊕R(U) →Q/Z
where G is a spherical space from group, R0(G) is the augmentation ideal
of the representation ring of G, and R(U) is the representation ring of the
unitary group. The ﬁrst is a perfect pairing and the second is non-singular
in the ﬁrst factor—i.e., the eta invariant completely detects the K-theory of
sperical space forms and equivariant unitary bordims of sperical space form
groups.
Question 1.
What is the situation for constant curvature 0 or constant 802. ?

480
Carlsson / Algebraic Topology
[ch. 28
curvature −1? Why is the eta invariant so successful in this setting?
The second map can also be interpreted as giving a map
η: ˜ΩU
∗(BG) ⊗R(U) →[bu∗(BG)]
For G = Zp (p-prime) it is well-known
˜ΩU
∗(BZp) ≃bu∗(BZp) ⊕Z[X4, X6, . . .].
We conjecture for spherical space form groups an additive splitting.
Question 2.
˜ΩU
∗(BG) = bU∗(BG) ⊕Z[X4, X6, . . .] and have proved it for
? 803.
G = Z4, G = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±h}. The proof of this additive isomorphism is
analytic; one wants a topological proof for the spherical space form groups in
general.
5.2. M. Kreck and S. Stolz
Problem. Suppose that G and G′ are compact simple Lie groups. Is it true
? 804.

Under certain circumstances, I have shown that equivariant homotopy equiv-
alence implies isovariant homotopy equivalence, in particular with a strong
“gap” hypothesis that
(a) dim M H < 1
2 dim M K, and
(b) (dim M H, dim M K) ̸= (1, 4)
for every pair of isotropy groups K ⊆H, where G is ﬁnite, acting PL. Weak-
ening condition (a), tom Dieck and L¨oﬄer have shown that a linking invariant
between ﬁxed point sets can occur which is an obstruction to equivalence.

If n1 = . . . = nl, this is known by work of Carlsson [1982] when G acts
trivially on homology, and Adem and Browder [1988] when ni ̸= 1, 3, 7 or
p ̸= 2.
6.2. M. Morimoto
Let G be a compact Lie group (possibly a ﬁnite group).
In the follow-
ing we treat only smooth actions. If a G-manifold has exactly one G-ﬁxed
point, then the action is called a one ﬁxed point action. E. Stein [1977],
T. Petrie [1982], E. Laitinen and P. Traczyk [1986] and M. Mori-
moto [19∞a, 19∞b] studied one ﬁxed point actions on spheres. We know
that S6 and S7 and some higher dimensional spheres have one ﬁxed point
actions. Recently M. Fureta [19∞] showed that S4 does not have one ﬁxed
point orientation preserving actions of ﬁnite groups, by observation of a mod-
uli space of self-dual connections of some principal SO(3)-bundle over S4,
and his idea originates from Donaldson’s work. Assuming Furuta’s result,
M. Morimoto showed that S4 does not have one ﬁxed point actions (Mori-
moto [19∞b]).
Problem A. Does there exist a one ﬁxed point action on S3?

We note that some 3-dimensional homology spheres have one ﬁxed point ac-
tions of A5, the alternating group on ﬁve letters.

From the results of R. Oliver [1979] and W.-Y. Hsiang and E. Straume

connected Lie groups.
In the above, Sn means the standard n-dimensional spheres and D4 means
the standard 4-dimensional disk.
Note: Recently, S. Demichelis has shown that a ﬁnite group acting locally
linearly and preserving orientation on a closed Z-homology 4-sphere has ﬁxed
point set a sphere.

Comments: Work of Kwasik and Schultz shows that topological S1-manifolds
satisfy many of the same global restrictions as in the smooth category. Also,
the answer is yes for free circle actions. Both of these suggest the answer is
yes in general. Finally, the answer to this question will be yes in many cases

when π is small, including the existence of exotic s-cobordisms (see Cappell
and Shaneson [1985], Kwasik [1986b] and forthcoming work of Kwasik and
Schultz). However, our overall understanding is far from complete. For π ﬁnite
the realization question is connected to the existence of nonlinear free ﬁnite

A classical theorem of Jordan about ﬁnite subgroups G of O(n) states: There

Let G be a compact Lie group whose identity connected component G0 is
abelian (i.e., G0 is either a trivial group or a torus T k with k ≥1) and as-
sume that the quotient group G/G0 has a normal, possibly trivial, 2-Sylow
subgroup. If G acts smoothly on M = Dn or Rn, there is the following re-
striction on the set F of points in M left ﬁxed by G. Namely F is a stably
complex manifold in the sense that F has a smooth embedding into some Eu-
clidean space such that the normal bundle of the embedding admits a complex
structure; cf. Edmonds and Lee [1975]. In particular, F is orientable and
all connected components of F are either even or odd dimensional.
Assume further that either (i) G/G0 is of prime power order or (ii) G/G0
has a cyclic subgroup not of prime power order. In case (i), it follows from
Smith Theory that F is Z-acyclic when G = G0 = T k with k ≥1, and F is
Zp-acyclic when |G/G0| = pa with p prime, a ≥1. In case (ii), if M = Dn,
Oliver’s work implies that χ(F) ≡1(modnG), where nG is the Oliver integer
of G.
It turns out that for G as above, these restrictions on F are both
necessary and suﬃcient for a compact smooth manifold F (resp., a smooth
manifold F without boundary) to occur as the ﬁxed point set of a smooth
action of G on a disk (resp., Euclidean space). This raises the question which
smooth manifolds can occur as the ﬁxed point sets of smooth actions of G on
disks (resp., Euclidean spaces) for other compact Lie groups G. In particular,
the following related problems are still unsolved.
Problem A. Let G be a compact Lie group such that G/G0 is not of prime
? 822.
power order but each element of G/G0 has prime power order. Is there a
smooth action of G on a disk (resp., Euclidean spaces) such that the ﬁxed
point set is not a stably parallelizable manifold?
Problem B. Is there a compact Lie group G which can act smoothly on a
? 823.
disk (resp. Euclidean space) with ﬁxed point set F consisting both of even and
odd dimensional connected components? Can some of them be nonorientable
manifolds? In particular, can F be the disjoint union of a point, a circle, and
the closed (resp., open M¨obius band)?
Problem C. Is there a compact Lie group G such that each component
? 824.
smooth manifold (resp., each smooth manifold without boundary) can occur
as the ﬁxed point set of a smooth action of G on a disk (resp., Euclidean
space)?
Comments.
Ad. 1. If such a G acts smoothly on Dn or Rn, then at any two ﬁxed points,
the representations of G are equivalent. In particular, each ﬁxed point set
connected component has the same dimension; cf. Pawalowski [1984].

Ad. 2. According to the above discussion, if such a ﬁnite group G exists, G
has a cyclic subgroup not of prime power order and G is an even order group
whose 2-Sylow subgroup is not normal.

exists, G is as in Ad. 2 and nG = 1 in the case of smooth actions of G on

0. Introduction
This paper is an introduction to knot theory through a discussion of research
problems. Each section (there are eleven) deals with a speciﬁc problem, or
with an area in which problems exist. No attempt has been made to be either
complete or particularly balanced in the composition of these problems. They
reﬂect my combinatorial bias, and my conviction that many problems in graph
theory (such as the four color problem) are really problems in the theory of
knots.
In this sense the theory of knots goes beyond topology into the combina-
torial structures that underpin topology. In the same sense, knot theory is
also deeply related to contexts in theoretical physics, and we have touched
on some of these connections, particularly in relation to the Jones polynomial
and its generalizations.
Knot theory had its inception in a combinatorial exercise to list all possibil-
ities for vortex atoms in the aether. It has always lived in the multiple worlds
of combinatorics, topology and physics. This is every bit as true as it was a
century ago. And the plot thickens!
I shall let the problems speak for themselves. Earlier problems introduce
information and terminology that occurs (with appropriate reference) in the
later problems. In retrospect, a few fascinating classes of problems have not
been touched here, so I shall mention them in this introduction. They are
the problems of the understanding of frictional properties of knots (give a
good mathematical model for it), understanding knotted orbits in dynamical
systems, understanding physical conﬁgurations of knots and links under vari-
ous conditions (tensions, ﬁelds, . . . ), and the applications of knot theory and
diﬀerential geometry to chemistry and molecular biology.
It gives me great pleasure to thank the following people for very helpful
conversations: G. Spencer-Brown, John Conway, Louis Crane, Jim Flagg,
Ivan Handler, Vaughan Jones, Carol Marians, Ken Millett, Kunio Murasugi,
Mario Rasetti, and Dan Sandin.
1. Reidemeister Moves, Special Moves, Concordance
For our purposes, a knot is a diﬀerentiable embedding of a circle into three
dimensional space, and a link is an embedding of a collection of circles. Two
links are said to be ambient isotopic, if there is a continuously parametrized
(over the interval [0, 1]) family of such embeddings so that the ﬁrst link cor-
responds to the parameter value 0, and the second link corresponds to the
parameter value 1.
Any link may be projected to a plane in three-space to form a link diagram.
The link diagram is a locally 4-valent planar graph with extra structure at the
vertices of this graph indicating which segment of the diagram crosses over
489

[ch. 29
the other in the three dimensional embedding. The usual convention for this
information is to indicate the undercrossing line by drawing it with a small
break at the crossing. The over-crossing line goes continuously through the
crossing and is seen to cleave the under-crossing line:


These diagrams can be used to formulate a purely combinatorial theory of
links that is equivalent to the theory of link embeddings up to ambient isotopy
in three dimensional space. The combinatorial theory is based on the Reide-
meister moves (Reidemeister [1948]). (See Figure 1.) These moves (along
with the topological moves on the 4-valent planar graph underlying the link
diagram) generate ambient isotopy for knots and links in three dimensional
space. Two diagrams are related via a sequence of Reidemeister moves if and
only if the link embeddings that they represent in three-space are ambient
isotopic. (See Burde and Zieschang [1986] for a modern proof of this fact.)

Figure 1: Reidemeister Moves
One can add extra moves to the Reidemeister moves, thereby getting larger
equivalence classes and (in principle) invariants of ambient isotopy. For exam-
ple, consider the following switch move (called the Gamma move in Kauff-
man [1983]) on oriented diagrams:

Γ


(An orientation of a diagram consists in assigning a direction of travel to each
link component. This is indicated by arrows on the diagram.)
In Kauffman [1983] it is shown that the equivalence relation generated by
the Reidemeister moves plus the switch (call it pass equivalence) has exactly

§1]
Reidemeister Moves, Special Moves, Concordance
491
two equivalence classes for knots. (There is a similar statement for links but
I shall not go into it here.)
The trefoil knot

represents one class, and the trivial knot

represents the other class.
Switch equivalence is interesting because every ribbon knot is pass equivalent
to the unknot.
A ribbon knot is a knot that bounds a disk immersed in three space with only
ribbon singularities. A ribbon singularity consists in a transverse intersection
of two non-singular arcs from the disk: One arc is interior to the disk; one arc
has its endpoint on the boundary of the disk. Examples of ribbon knots are
shown in Figure 2.


Figure 2: Ribbon Knots
In the diagram of a ribbon knot a sequence of switches can be used to
remove all the ribbon singularities. Thus a ribbon knot is pass equivalent to
an unknot. Since the trefoil knot is not pass equivalent to the unknot, we
conclude that the trefoil is not ribbon.
The interest in the problem of ribbon knots lies in the fact that every ribbon
knot is slice. That is, every ribbon knot bounds a smoothly embedded disk in
the upper four space H4 (if the knots and links are in the Euclidean space R3,
then H4 = R+ × R3 where R+ = {r : r ≥0, r a real number}.) A knot that
bounds a smoothly embedded disk in upper four space is called a slice knot

492
Kauffman / Knot Theory
[ch. 29
(Fox and Milnor [1966]). We would really like to characterize slice knots.
In fact, it remains an open question:
Problem 1. Is every slice knot a ribbon knot?
? 825.
The problem of detecting slice knots is very deep, with distinct diﬀerences
between the case in dimension three and the generalizations to higher dimen-
sional knots. The most signiﬁcant work on the slice problem in dimension
three, deﬁnitively discriminating it from higher dimensions, is due to Cas-
son and Gordon [1978].
While their invariants detect signiﬁcant exam-
ples of non-slice knots that are algebraically slice (from the viewpoint of the
Seifert pairing), the method is in general very diﬃcult to apply. Thus: One
would like to have new and computable invariants to detect slice knots. (See
Problem 2 below.)
The appropriate equivalence relation on knots and links for this matter of
slice knots is the notion of concordance. Two knots are said to be concordant
if there is a smooth embedding of S1 × I into S3 × I with one knot at one
end of the embedding and the other knot at the other end. A slice knot is
concordant to the unknotted circle. (The embedding of the slice disk can
rise only a ﬁnite height into four-space by compactness. Locate a point of
maximal height and exercise a small disk. This proceduces the concordance.)
Concordance is generated by the Reidemeister moves, in conjunction with
the passage through saddle point singularities, and the passage through min-
ima and maxima. A minimum connotes the birth of an unknotted circle, and
a maximum connotes the death of an unknotted circle.
Of course, the entire history of the concordance is constrained to trace out
an annulus (S1 × I) embedded in the four-space. It is this constraint that
makes the subject of knot and link concordance so diﬃcult to analyze. It is
easy to construct slice knots, but very hard to recognize them!
Later, we shall raise this question of slice knots and behaviour under con-
cordance with respect to various invariants such as the Jones polynomial
(Jones [1985]). The question is:
Problem 2.
Are there any new and simple invariants of concordance?
? 826.
It is possible that we are overlooking the obvious in this realm.
2. Knotted Strings?
String Theory is usually formulated in dimensions that forbid the considera-
tion of knots. We can, however, imagine string-like particles tracing out world
sheets in four dimensional spacetime. A typical string vertex will then be an

embedding of a sphere with four holes in S3 ×I so that two holes are in S3 ×0
and two holes are in S3 × 1:

→
S3 × I.
Just as with knot concordance (Section 1), the embedding can be quite
complex, and this complexity will be indexed by the appearance of singulari-
ties in the hyperspace cross sections S3 × t for t between zero and one. The
singularities are births, deaths and saddle points. It is interesting to note that
in this framework, a knot and its mirror image can interact to produce two
unknots! See Figure 3.


Figure 3: Interaction.
Thus, this embedded string theory contains a myriad of “particle states”
corresponding to knotting and the patterns of knot concordance (Section 1).
While the physical interpretation of knotted strings is ambiguous, the math-
ematics of interacting knots and links is a well-deﬁned and unexplored terri-
tory.

Problem 4. Does the original Jones polynomial (Jones [1985]) detect knot-
? 828.
tedness?
There are many polynomial invariants of knots and links that general-
ize the original Jones polynomial (Akutsu and Wadati [1988], Freyd,
Yetter, Hoste, Lickorish, Millett and Ocneaunu [1985], Ho [1985],
Hoste [1986], Jones [1987, 1989], Kauffman [1989a, 19∞a, 1990a], Lick-
orish and Millett [1987], Lickorish [1988], Reshetikhin [1987, 1989],
Turaev [1987], Witten [1989]), and the same problem can be addressed
to them. Nevertheless, the problem is most charming when phrased to the
original Jones polynomial. It is, at base, a combinatorial question about the
structure of the bracket state model (Kauffman [1987b]) that calculates this
polynomial.
Recall the bracket, [K]. It is, at the outset a well-deﬁned three variable
polynomial for unoriented link diagrams—deﬁned by the equations
1.
[] = A[] + B[]
2.
[K] = d[K],
[] = d
In these equations the small diagrams stand for parts of otherwise identical
larger diagrams. The second equation is to be interpreted as saying that an
isolated loop (Jordan curve) contributes a factor of d to the polynomial. Since
we assume that A, B and d commute, it follows easily that ⟨K⟩is well-deﬁned
on unoriented diagrams. Call this polynomial the three-variable bracket. It
is not an ambient isotopy invariant as it stands, but a specialization of the
variables yields the Jones polynomial.
To be precise, one easily ﬁnds the following formula:
[] = AB[] + (ABd + A2 + B2)[].
Hence, if we choose B = A−1 and d = −A2 −A−2, and deﬁne the topological
bracket, ⟨K⟩, by the formula
⟨K⟩(A) = [K](A, A−1, −A2 −A−2)/[]
then
⟨⟩= ⟨⟩
achieving invariance under the second Reidemeister move. It is then easy(!)
to see that this topological bracket is invariant under the third Reidemeister
move as well. Finally, we get the formulas
⟨⟩= (−A3)⟨⟩
⟨⟩= (−A−3)⟨⟩

§3]
Detecting Knottedness
495
(Thus ⟨K⟩is not invariant under the ﬁrst Reidemeister move. It is invariant
under II and III. This is called invariance under regular isotopy.)
3.1. Theorem (Kauffman [1987b]). The original Jones polynomial VK(t)
is a normalized version of the special bracket. In particular,
VK(t) = fK(t−1
4 )
where fK(A) = (−A3)−w(K)⟨K⟩, K is oriented, w(K) is the sum of the cross-
ing signs of K, and ⟨K⟩is the topological bracket evaluated on K by forgetting
K’s orientation.
We can restate the question at the beginning:
Problem 4.1.
Does there exist a knot K (K is assumed to be knotted) 829. ?
such that ⟨K⟩is a power of A?
Such a knot would have extraordinary cancellations in the bracket calcula-
tion.
One way to begin to look into this problem is to consider the structure of a
state summation for the bracket. That is, we can give a speciﬁc formula for the
bracket as a combinatorial summation over certain conﬁgurations of the link
diagram. I call these conﬁgurations “states” of the diagram—in analogy to
the states of a physical system in physical mechanics. In a sense, each model
for a link invariant has its own special set of states. The states for the bracket
are particularly simple: let U be the four-valent plane graph underlying a
given link diagram K. A (bracket) state of U is a collection of Jordan curves
in the plane that is obtained by splicing each crossing of U in one of the two
possible ways—as shown in Figure 4.
K
U
S
Figure 4: S is a state of U
For a given link diagram K, each state S of K has vertex weights A or B at
each crossing of K. These weights depend upon the relationship of the local
state conﬁguration and the crossing in the link diagram. If C is a crossing

and Q is a local state conﬁguration, then I let [C|Q] denote the vertex weight
contributed by C and Q. The rules are as shown below:

If K is a link diagram and S is a state of K, then [K|S] denotes the product
of the vertex weights from K and S over all the crossings of K.

We then have the speciﬁc formula

where the summation extends over all states of the diagram, and ∥S∥denotes
the number of Jordan curves in the state S.
In the case of the special bracket, this summation becomes
⟨K⟩=

Ai(S)−j(S)(−A2 −A−2)∥S∥−1.
Here the summation extends over all the states of the diagram, and i(S) and
j(S) denote the number of sites in the states that receive vertex weights of
A and A−1 respectively. From this formula, we see that the whole diﬃculty
in understanding cancellation phenomena in the bracket is concentrated in
the presence of the signs (−1)∥S∥in the state summation. In the cases of
alternating links (Kauffman [1987b], Murasugi [1987]) and adequate links
(Lickorish [1988]) it is possible to see directly that there is no non-trivial
cancellation (i.e., the polynomial ⟨K⟩detects knottedness for alternating and
adequate knots and links).
In general, it is quite possible that there is a
topologically knotted diagram K with enough cancellation to make ⟨K⟩into
a power of A.

4. Knots and Four Colors
A simple, classical construction relates arbitrary planar graphs and (pro-
jected) link diagrams. This is the construction of the medial graph associated
to any planar graph embedding. See Figure 5.
The medial graph is obtained as follows: In each region of the plane graph
G (A plane graph is a graph that is embedded in the plane), draw a Jordan
curve that describes the boundary of the region. For ease of construction, the
curve should be drawn near the boundary. Now each edge of the graph will
appear as shown below (with the dotted line representing the original edge,
and the solid lines representing the Jordan curves).


Once for each edge in G, replace the parallel Jordan curve segments with a
crossing as shown below and in Figure 5.

The resulting locally four-valent plane graph is the medial graph, M(G).


Figure 5: The graph G and its medial graph M(G)
The upshot of this medial graph construction is that the class of locally
four-valent plane graphs is suﬃciently general to capture all the properties of
the entire class of plane graphs. Since knots and links project to locally four-
valent plane graphs, this means that in principle, all combinatorial problems
about plane graphs are problems about link diagrams. A problem about link
diagrams may or may not be a problem about the topology of links, but it
is interesting and possibly very signiﬁcant to see the relationship between
combinatorial problems and their topological counterparts.

[ch. 29
A ﬁrst example of this correspondence is the chromatic polynomial, CG(q).
This is the number of vertex colorings by q colors of the graph G such that
vertices that share an edge receive distinct colors (i.e., CG(q) is the number of
proper vertex colorings of G with q colors.). It is easy to see that CG satisﬁes
the following formulas
C
 = C
 −C

C•G = qCG
Here •G denotes the disjoint union of G with an isolated point, and the small
diagrams indicate (in order from left to right) an edge in the graph G, the
deletion of this edge, the contraction of this edge to a point. Thus the ﬁrst
formula states that
CG = CG′ −CG′′
where G, G′ and G” stand for the original graph, the graph with a speciﬁc
edge deleted, and the graph with this edge contracted to a point, respectively.
On translating this formula to the medial graph we ﬁnd

Since one must keep track of the direction of splitting in terms of the original
graph it is best to work with a shaded medial, thus:

This scheme is quite convenient for working with colorings of graphs. In par-
ticular, it suggests that the chromatic polynomial is very similar to the bracket
polynomial. In fact, we can use the crossings of a knot diagram to encode the
chromatic polynomial as a bracket calculation. (See Kauffman [1989d].) The
result is as follows: Associate to each plane graph G an alternating link dia-
gram K(G) by taking the medial M(G), and arranging a link diagram over
M(G) with crossings chosen to be of “A-type” for each edge of G (See Figure 6
for this convention.) Deﬁne a special bracket via
{ } = { } −q−1/2{ }
{ K} = q1/2{K}
Then CG(q) = qN/2{K(G)} where N denotes the number of vertices of the
original graph G.
This formula shows that the chromatic polynomial for a plane graph can be
put into exactly the same framework as the Jones polynomial for a given link.
Now the classical combinatorial problem about the chromatic polynomial for

Figure 6: G and its alternating link diagram K(G)
plane graphs is to show that it does not vanish for q = 4 when G has no
loop and no isthmus (See Kempe [1879], Whitney [1988]). We see from this
reformulation that this diﬃculty is very similar to the diﬃculty in showing
that the Jones polynomial detects knottedness.
These remarks solve neither the knot detection problem nor the coloring
problem, but it is signiﬁcant to ﬁnd that these problems share the rung in the
inferno.
5. The Potts Model
The chromatic polynomial of Section 4, is a special case of the dichromatic
polynomial, a polynomial WG(q, v) in two variables, q and v, associated with
an arbitrary graph G via the formulas
W
 = W
 −vW

W•G = qWG
That is, W is a generalization of the chromatic polynomial. It specializes
to the chromatic polynomial when v = 1.
Just as we expressed the chromatic polynomial as a bracket calculation, we
can also express the dichromatic polynomial in a similar way. Generalize the
special bracket of Section 4 via the rules:
{ } = { } + vq−1/2{ }
{ K} = q1/2{K}
Then one has the formula
WG(q, v) = qN/2{K(G)},
where N denotes the number of vertices of the graph G (G is a plane graph
for this discussion.) and K(G) is the alternating link diagram associated with
the plane graph G via the medial construction (See Section 4).
Now it is well-known (Baxter [1982]) that the dichromatic polynomial of a
graph G can be interpreted as the partition function of a statistical mechanics

500
Kauffman / Knot Theory
[ch. 29
model based on G. This model, known as the Potts model depends upon q
local states at the vertices of the graph, and the variable v is related to the
temperature in the model via the equation z = exp( 1
kT )−1 (anti-ferromagnetic
case) where T denotes temperature, and k is a constant (Boltzman’s constant).
The partition function is a summation over the physical states of the model
of probability weighting for these states. The weights depend upon energy,
temperature and Boltzman’s constant. In this very simple model, a state σ is
an assignment of values (colors, spins,. . . ) to each vertex of the graph. The
energy, E(σ), of the state σ is then deﬁned to be the number of coincidences
of spins for pairs of vertices that are connected by an edge in the graph. The
partition function is the summation
ZG =

σ
exp

( 1
kT )E(σ)

where the sum extends over all states of the given graph.
The basic result is that ZG = WG(q, exp( 1
kT ) −1). Hence
ZG = q
N
2 {K(G)}{q, exp( 1
kT ) −1}.
Note that this formula says that the Potts partition function at zero temper-
ature is the chromatic polynomial.
For G a rectangular lattice in the plane it is conjectured (Baxter [1982])
that the Potts model has a phase transition (in the limit of large lattices)
for the temperature value that symmetrizes the model with respect to graph
and dual graph in the plane. In terms of the special bracket link diagram
representation of the model, this means that we demand that q
1
2 = exp( 1
kT )−1
since this creates the symmetry
{ } = { } + { }
corresponding in link diagrams to the desired duality.
Many problems about the Potts model ﬁnd their corresponding formula-
tions in terms of this special bracket for linked diagrams. In particular, it is
at once obvious from the special bracket expansion for the Potts model that
the Potts model can be expanded over the Temperley-Lieb algebra—with this
algebra represented diagramatically via braid monoid elements of the form

There are a number of important questions about the relationship of the
Temperley-Lieb algebra and other structures of the model near criticality.
For example, one would hope that this approach sheds light on the relation-
ship with the Virasoro algebra in the continuum limit of the Potts model at
criticality. In general we can ask:

§6]
States, Crystals and the Fundamental Group
501
Problem 7. Does the link diagrammatic approach lend insight into proper- 831. ?
ties of the Potts model?
We can also ask whether the concepts of statistical mechanics can be used
in the topological context. For example,
Problem 8.
What does the phenomena of phase transition mean in the 832. ?
context of calculating link polynomials for large links?
Problem 9.
Is there a way to extract topological information from the 833. ?
dynamical behaviour of a quasi-physical system associated with the knot?
Finally, to return directly to the knot theory, one might wonder:
Problem 10. Is the Potts partition function viewed as a function on alter- 834. ?
nating link diagrams a topological invariant of these diagrams?
Instead of being nonsense, this turns out to be a deep question! It requires
interpretation. The apparently correct conjecture is this:
Problem 11. Let K be a reduced alternating diagram, then we conjecture 835. ?
that [K](A, B, d) is an ambient isotopy invariant of K.
(A diagram is reduced if there are no simplifying type I moves and it is
not a connected sum of two non-trivial diagrams.) This conjecture has its
roots in the classical conjectures of Tait, Kirkwood and Little who suggested
that two reduced alternating projections of the same link are related by a
sequence of higher-order moves called ﬂypes. A ﬂype takes a tangle with two
crossed input strands and two output strands, and turns the tangle by one half
twist (180 degrees). This moves takes alternating projections to alternating
projections. It is easy to see that the full three-variable bracket polynomial is
invariant under ﬂyping. Thus the Flyping Conjecture of Tait, Kirkwood and
Little implies the topological invariance of the full bracket for the reduced
alternating projections.
This, in turn, implies the invariance of the Potts
partition function for an associated reduced alternating link.
It appears that the Potts partition function contains real topological infor-
mation. Perhaps eventually it will be seen that the Tait Flyping Conjecture
follows from subtle properties of statistical mechanics.
6. States, Crystals and the Fundamental Group
The fundamental group of the complement of the link can be described as a
special sort of state of the link diagram. In order to illustrate this point and
to ask questions related to it, I shall describe a structure that simultaneously

502
Kauffman / Knot Theory
[ch. 29
generalizes the fundamental group, the Alexander module, and the Quandle
(Joyce [1982]). We shall call this algebraic structure related to an oriented
link diagram the crystal of K, C(K). (See Kauffman [1987a, 19∞b]).
The crystal is obtained by assigning an algebra element to each arc in the
diagram, and writing a relation at each crossing in the form shown below:

a
b
c = ab

a
b
c = ab
In this formalism the mark,
(or
, (there are left and right versions of the
mark) is a formal operator that is handled like a root sign (√) in ordinary
algebra. That is, the mark has the role of operator and parenthesis. It acts
on the expression written within it, and it creates a parenthetical boundary
for the result of the operation. The concatenation ab is regarded as a non-
commutative product of a and b. The crystal is a formal algebra that is given
to be associative and (possibly) non-commutative.
Products in the crystal are built via the following rules:
(1) If a and b are in C, then ab, a b, a and a are in C.
(2) The labels for the arcs on the link diagram are in C.
(3) All elements of C are built via these three rules.
The crystal axioms are:
2. xa a = x for all x and a in C.
3. x ba b = xab for all x, a and b in C. (and the variants motivated
below.)
The axioms are labelled 2. and 3. to correspond to the Reidemeister moves 2.
and 3. The diagrams in Figure 7 show this correspondence with the moves.
Here we have used a modiﬁed version of the type III move (a detour) that is
valid in the presence of the type two move.
By our assumption about the Crystal Axioms, the crystal acts on itself via
C × C −→C : (a, b) −→ab (or a b).
Given the associativity of the concatenation operation in the crystal, we see
that Axiom 2 asserts that the operator subset
C∗= { x ∈C : x = a or x = a for some a ∈C }

is a group (of automorphisms of C) under the crystal multiplication. This
group is the fundamental group of the link complement. (Compare the for-
malism with that of the Wirtinger presentation (Crowell and Fox [1963])
of the fundamental group.) If we wish to emphasize this group structure then
we can write the axioms as:
2. a a = 1,
aa = 1,
3. ab = ba b,
a b = b a b,
ab = b ab ,
a b = b a b.
These are the operator identities, but the important point to see is that we
associate one group element to each arc of the diagram, and that there is one
relation for each crossing in the form shown below:

This is the familiar Wirtinger relation for the fundamental group.
The quandle (Joyce [1982], Winker [1984]) is generated by lassos, each
consisting in an arc emanating from a basepoint in the complement of the
link, plus a disk whose boundary encircles the link—the interior of the disk is
punctured once transversely by the link itself. One lasso acts on another to
form a new lasso a ∗b (for lassos a and b) by changing the arc of a by ﬁrst
travelling down b, around its disk, back to basepoint, then down the original
arc of a. Since one can travel around the disk in two ways, this yields two
possible operations a ∗b and a ∗b. These correspond formally to our abstract
operations ab and a b. See Figure 8.

The crystal contains more than the fundamental group, and in fact it classi-
ﬁes knots up to mirror images. (See Joyce [1982].) I have deﬁned the crystal
so that it is a regular isotopy invariant (invariant under the second and third
Reidemeister moves. It is nevertheless the case that the group C∗(K) is in-
variant under all three Reidemeister moves. The quandle is a quotient of the
crystal. We translate to the quandle by writing a∗b = ab. This has the eﬀect
of replacing a non-commutative algebra with operators by a non-associative
algebra.
Simple representations of the crystal show its nature. For example, label
the arcs of the link diagram with integers and deﬁne ab = a b = 2b −a. (This
operation does not depend upon the orientation of the diagram.) Then each
link diagram will have a least modulus (not equal to 1) in which the crossing

§6]
States, Crystals and the Fundamental Group
505
equations can be solved. For example, the modulus of the trefoil is three:

0
1
−2
−1
a ∗b = 2b −a
modulo 3
This shows that the number three is an invariant of the trefoil knot, and it
shows that we can label the arcs of a trefoil with three colors (0, 1, 2) so that
each crossing sees either three distinct colors or it sees only one color. The
invariantce of the crystal tells us that any diagram obtained from the trefoil
by Reidemeister moves can be colored in the same way (i.e., according to
the same rules). In general, there is a coloring scheme corresponding to each
modulus, and any knot can be colored with (suﬃciently many) labels. Note
that for a diagram isotopic to a given diagram there may appear diﬀerent
colors, since not all the colors will necessarily be used on a given diagram
(even for a ﬁxed modulus).
In any case, this modular approach to link invariants shows us a picture
of a link invariant arising as a property of a special sort of “state” of the
diagram (The state is a coloring of the arcs according to the crystal rules.).
That property is the modulus. It is the least integer that annihilates all the
state labels. The states themselves are arranged so that if the diagram is
changed by a Reidemeister move, then there is a well-deﬁned transition from
the given state to a state of the new diagram.
The same picture holds for the classical Alexander polynomial. Here the
crystal represents the Alexander module by the equations
ab = ta + (1 −t)b
a b = t−1a + (1 −t−1)b
Note that when t = −1 we have the formalism of the modular crystal described
above. The labels a, b, . . . on the arcs of the link diagram are generators of a
module (hence additively commutative) over the ring Z[t, t−1]. Each crossing
in the diagram gives a relation that must hold in the module. The classical
Alexander polynomial is deﬁned (up to units in Z[t, t−1]) as the generator of
the annihilator ideal of the Alexander module. Once again, we have gener-
alized states of the diagrams (labellings from the Alexander module) and a
topological invariant arising from the properties of these states.
Problem 12. A fundamental problem is to ﬁnd new ways to extract signiﬁ- 836. ?
cant topological information from the crystal. We would like to ﬁnd a useful
generalization of the crystal that would completely classify links—including
the information about mirror images.

506
Kauffman / Knot Theory
[ch. 29
I have taken the time to describe this crystalline approach to the classical
invariants because it is fascinating to ask how the classical methods are related
to the new methods that produce the Jones polynomial and its generalizations.
At the present time there seems to be no direct relationship between the Jones
polynomial and the fundamental group of the knot complement, or with a
structure analogous to the Alexander module. This means that although the
newer knot polynomials are very powerful, they do not have access to many
classical techniques. A direct relation with the fundamental group or with
the structure of the crystal would be a real breakthrough.
There is a theme in this quest that is best stated in the metaphors of
mathematical physics. A given physical system has physical states. As time
goes on, and as the system is changed (possibly as the system is topologi-
cally deformed) these states undergo transitions. The patterns of the state
transitions reﬂect fundamental properties of the physics of the system. The
usual method of statistical mechanics is to consider not the transitions of the
states, but rather the gross average of probability weighting over all the pos-
sible states. This average is called the partition function of the system. The
two points of view—transition properties and gross averages—are complemen-
tary ways of dealing with the physics of the system. They are related. For
example, one hopes to extract information about phase transition from the
partition function. Phase transition is a signiﬁcant property of state changes
in the system.
In the knot theory we have the same schism as in the physics—between the
contexts of state transition and state averaging. The tension between them
will produce new mathematics and new relations with the physics.
7. Vacuum-Vacuum Expectation and Quantum Group
An intermediate position related to the philosophy at the end of Section 6 is
the fact that a statistical mechanics model in d+1 dimensions of space can be
construed as a quantum statistical mechanics model in d dimensions of space
and 1 dimension of time. (This is called d + 1-dimensional space-time.)
In the case of the knot invariants, this philosophy leads to the invariant
viewed as a vacuum-vacuum expectation for a process occurring in 1 + 1-
dimensional space-time, with the link diagram in the Minkowski plane. For
knots in three-space, the process occurs in a 2 + 1-dimensional space-time.
Here the picture is quite intuitive. One visualizes a plane moving up through
three dimensional space. This is the motion through time for the ﬂatlanders
living in the plane.
The ﬂatlanders observe a complex pattern of particle
creation, interaction and annihilation corresponding to the intersection of the
moving plane with a link embedded in the three dimensional space.
In order to calculate the vacuum-vacuum expectation of this process, the
ﬂatlanders must know probability amplitudes for diﬀerent aspects of the

§7]
Vacuum-Vacuum Expectation and Quantum Group
507
process—or they must have some global method of computing the ampli-
tude. In the case of the Jones polynomial and its generalizations the global
method is provided by Witten’s topological quantum ﬁeld theory (See Wit-
ten [1989]).
For now we shall rest content with a simpler calculation more suited to
linelanders than to ﬂatlanders The simplest version of a quantum model of
this kind is obtained from the planar knot and link diagrams. There we can
call attention to creations, annihilations and interactions in the form of cups,
caps and crossings. Note that the crossings go over and under the plane of
the diagram. This model has just a bit more than one dimension of space in
its space-time.

As illustrated above, I have associated each cup, cap, or crossing with a
matrix whose indices denote the “spins” of the particles created or interacting,
and whose value denotes a generalized quantum amplitude taking values in
an (unspeciﬁed) commutative ring.
Following the principles of quantum mechanics, the amplitude is the sum
(over all possible conﬁgurations of spins) of the products of the amplitudes for
each conﬁguration. In order for this amplitude to be an invariant of regular
isotopy, we need matrix properties that correspond to topological moves. Thus
we require

Now, the remarkable thing about this approach is that it is directly related to
the non-commutative Hopf algebra constructions (called quantum groups) of
Drinfeld and others (See Drinfeld [1986], Manin [1988], and Reshetikhin
[1987]). In particular, the so-called Double Construction of Drinfeld exactly
parallels these extended Reidemeister moves (extended by the conditions re-
lated to creation and annihilation). (For example, the twist move corresponds
to the existence of an antipode in the Hopf algebra via the use of the Drinfeld
universal solution to the Yang-Baxter Equation.)
This context of link invariants as vacuum-vacuum amplitudes is a good
context in which to ask the question:
Problem 13.
Do these vacuum-vacuum amplitude invariants completely
? 837.
classify knots and links?
The abstract tensor formalism of cup, cap and interaction satisfying only
the properties we have listed does give a faithful translation of the regular
isotopy classes of knots and links into a category of formal tensor products.
In order to calculate an invariant these tensor symbols must be replaced by
actual matrices.
Problem 14. I conjecture that for a given pair of links that are distinct, there
? 838.
exists a representation of the abstract tensor formalism that distinguishes
them.
(In fact I conjecture that there is a representation of the Drinfeld
double construction, i.e., a quantum group, that distinguishes them.)
The abstract tensor structures are related to the duality structure of confor-
mal ﬁeld theories, and to invariants of three manifolds obtained in a number

§8]

of related ways (Crane [1989], Reshetikhin [1989], Witten [1989]). There
is not space in this problem list to go into the details of all these construc-
tions. However, the basic idea behind the constructions of the three-manifold
invariants in the Reshetikhin-Turaev approach is to add extra conditions to
the link polynomials so that they become invariants of framed links and so
that they are further invariant under the Kirby moves (See Kirby [1978]).
This insures that the resulting polynomials are invariants of the three mani-
fold obtained by surgery on the framed link. The fundamental group of the
three manifold is obtained as a quotient of the fundamental group of the given
link complement.
Problem 15.
We now face the important question of the sensitivity of 839. ?
these new invariants of three-manifolds to the fundamental group of the three-
manifold.
If the new three manifold invariants can be non-trivial on simply connected
compact three-manifolds, then there will exist a counterexample to the clas-
sical Poincar´e Conjecture. The structure of these new invariants will provide
a long sought after clue to the solution of this venerable conundrum. (The
Poincar´e Conjecture asserts that a compact simply connected three manifold
is homeomorphic to the standard three dimensional sphere.)
8. Spin-Networks and Abstract Tensors
Another relationship between quantum networks and three dimensional spaces
occurs in the Penrose theory of spin networks (Penrose [1971]). Here the
formalism of spin angular momentum in quantum mechanics is made into a
purely diagrammatic system. Each spin network is assigned a combinatori-
ally computed norm. (The Penrose norm has the form of a vacuum-vacuum
expectation for the whole network, but here the network is not embedded in
a space-time. This bears an analogical relation with the amplitudes for knots
and links that depend only upon the topology of the embedding into space-
time and not upon any given choice for an arrow of time.) These norms, in
turn can be used to compute probabilities of interaction between networks,
or between parts of a given network.
Probabilities for interaction lead to a deﬁnition of angle between networks.
The angle is regarded as well-deﬁned if two repeated measurements yield the
same result. The upshot of the Penrose work is the Spin-Geometry Theorem
that states that well-deﬁned angles between subnetworks of a (large) network
obey the dependency relation of angles in a three dimensional space. In other
words, the properties of three dimensional space begin to emerge from the
abstract relations in the spin networks.
One would hope to recover distances and even space-time in this fashion.
The Penrose theory obtains only angles in a fundamental way.

Problem 16. I conjecture (Kauffman [1990b]) that a generalization of the
? 840.
spin networks to networks involving embedded knotted graphs will be able to
realize the goal of a space-time spin geometry theorem.
Here it must be understood that the embedding space of the knotted graphs
is not the ﬁnal space or three manifold that we aim to ﬁnd. In fact, it may be
possible to use a given embedding of the graph for calculating spin network
norms, but that these norms will be essentially independent of the embedding
(just so the Penrose spin nets are calculated through a planar immersion of
the net, but they depend only on the abstract net and cyclic orders attached
to the vertices).
In this vision, there will be constructions for new three dimensional man-
ifolds, and these manifolds will carry the structure of signiﬁcant topological
invariants in the networks of which they are composed.
In order to bring this discussion down to earth, let me give one example
of how the spin networks are already generalized by the vacuum-vacuum,
amplitude models for the Jones polynomial. If we take the bracket (Section 3)
at the value A = −1, then the bracket relation becomes
⟨⟩+ ⟨⟩+ ⟨⟩= 0.
This relation is identical to the generating relation for the Penrose binor
calculus—a translation of SL(2, C) invariant tensors into diagrammatic lan-
guage. The binor calculus is the underpinning of the spin networks. As A is
deformed away from −1 (or from 1) the symmetry of these networks becomes
the quantum group SL(2)q. (A = √ε)
Thus the link diagrams as abstract tensor diagrams already show themselves
as a generalization of the spin networks.
9. Colors Again
To come fully down to earth from Section 8, here is a spin network calculation
that computes the number of edge colorings of a trivalent plane graph:
Associate to each vertex in the graph the tensor √−1ϵabc where ϵabc denotes
the alternating symbol—that is, a, b and c run over three indices {0, 1, 2};
the epsilon is zero if any two indices are the same, and it is the sign of the
permutation abc when the three indices are distinct.
Call an assignment
of indices to all the edges of the graph an em edge coloring if each vertex
receives three distinct indices. For each edge coloring σ of G, let ∥σ∥denote
the product of the values √−1ϵabc from each vertex. Thus ∥σ∥is the product
of the vertex weights assigned by this tensor to the given edge coloring. Deﬁne
the norm, ∥G∥of a graph G to be the sum of these products of vertex weights,
summing over all edge colorings of the graph.
Then one has the following result:

§9]
Colors Again
511
9.1. Theorem (Penrose [1971]). If G is a trivalent plane graph, then the
norm of G, ∥G∥, is equal to the number of edge colorings of G. In fact the
norm of each coloring is +1 if G is planar. In general, the norm for immersed
graphs (with edge-crossing singularities) obeys the following equation
∥∥= ∥∥−∥∥
with the value of a collection of (possibly overlapping) closed loops being
three (3) raised to the number of loops.
In this theorem, the norm can be evaluated for non-planar graphs by choos-
ing a singular embedding of the graph in the plane, and then computing the
norm as before. (Crossing lines may be colored diﬀerently or the same. We
are actually coloring the abstract graph.) The immersion of the graph in the
plane gives a speciﬁc cyclic order to the edges of each vertex, and this deter-
mines the norm computation. Of course, any graph with no colorings receives
a norm zero, but non-planar graphs that have colorings can also receive norm
zero. For example, the graph below has zero norm:

An embedding with singularities may not enumerate all the colorings with
positive signs. The simplest example is

Remark: The problem of edge colorings for trivalent graphs is well-known
to be equivalent to the four color problem for arbitrary plane graphs. Thus
the spin network evaluation is another instance of the four color problem
living in relation to a context composed of combinatorics, knot theory and
mathematical physics. The relation with the knot theory could be deepened

512
Kauffman / Knot Theory
[ch. 29
if we could add crossing tensors to the Penrose formula so that it computed
the coloring number for arbitrary (not necessarily planar) trivalent graphs.
This is a nice challenge for the knot diagrammatic approach.
The simplest known snark (a snark is a non-edge colorable trivalent graph)
is the Petersen graph—shown below:

The Peterson graph is to combinatorics as the M¨obius strip is to topology—a
ubiquitous phenomenon that insists on turning up when least expected. Tutte
has conjectured that the Petersen graph must appear in any snark.
This chromatic spin-network calculation can be reformulated in terms of
link diagrams if we restrict ourselves to plane graphs. Then the medial con-
struction comes directly into play: Take the medial construction for the triva-
lent graph.

Associate link diagrammatic crossings to the crossings in the medial con-
struction to form an alternating link (as we have done in Section 4). Deﬁne
a state expansion on link diagrams via
∥∥= ∥∥−∥∥
where the value of a collection of loops (with singular crossings) is three to
the number of loops. This norm computes the same coloring number as the
Penrose number. (Exercise!)
Heuristics
One of the advantages of the coloring problem in relation to our concerns
about state models and topology is that, while the coloring problem is very
diﬃcult, there are very strong heuristic arguments in favor of the conjecture
that four colors suﬃce to color a plane map, (and equivalently that trivalent
plane maps without loop or isthmus can be edge colored with three colors
distinct at each edge.)

§9]
Colors Again
513
At an edge in a trivalent map I shall deﬁne two operations to produce
smaller maps. These operations are denoted connect and cross-connect as
illustrated below:





connect
cross-connect
Call a trivalent map that has no edge coloring and that is minimal with
respect to this property critical. It is obvious that if G is critical and we form
H by connecting or cross-connecting an edge of G, then the two local edges
produced by the operation must receive the same color in any coloring of H.
(If they are diﬀerent, then it is trivial to produce a coloring of G by using a
third color on the edge deleted by the operation.) Call a pair of edges twins
if they must receive the same color in any coloring of a graph H. Say that G
forces twins at an edge e of G if the edges resulting from both connect and
cross-connect at e are twins.
Thus
9.2. Theorem. A critical trivalent map G forces twins at every edge of G.
In order to design a critical map it is necessary to create maps with twins.
A simple example of a pair of twins is shown below.

To give a feel for the design problem, suppose that the diagram below
represents a trivalent critical map. (I have drawn it in a non-planar fashion
for convenience. We are discussing the matter of design of critical maps in
the abstract)

If this map is critical then the edge that is shown must force twins. The

514

pattern of the forced pairs simpliﬁes as shown below.


connect
cross-connect
The simplest example that I can devise to create forcing from both pairs is
as shown below

This graph is isomorphic to the Petersen graph.
Thus we have seen how one is lead inevitably to the Petersen graph in an
attempt to design critical trivalent maps. The design side is a strong arena
for investigating the coloring problem.
A similar arena exists in knot theory via the many examples that one can
construct and compute, however I do not yet see the problem of designing
knots that are undetectable in any similar light. The graph theory may yield
clues. Time will tell.
Problem 17.
Can Knot Theory solve the Four Color problem and what
? 841.
does the truth of the four color theorem imply for three-dimensional topology?
10. Formations
A diagrammatic approach to coloring trivalent maps clariﬁes some of the
issues of Problem 17, and allows us to raise a central issue about map coloring.
This diagrammatic technique goes as follows.
Regard the three colors as
red (
), blue (-----) and purple (-----). That is, regard one color
(purple) as a superposition of the other two colors, and diagram red by a solid
line, blue by a dotted line, and purple by a combination dotted and solid line.
With this convention, any edge three coloring of a trivalent graph has the
appearance of two collections of Jordan curves in the plane. One collection
consists in red curves. The other collection has only blue curves. The red
curves are disjoint from one another, and the blue curves are disjoint from one
another. Red and blue curves share segments corresponding to the edges that
are labelled purple. Thus red curves and blue curves can interact by either
sharing a segment without crossing one another (a bounce), or by sharing in
the form of a crossing (a cross).

§10]
Formations
515


Figure 9: Bouncing and Crossing
These two forms of interaction are illustrated in Figure 9. I call a coloring
shown in this form of interacting Jordan curves a formation. The terminology
formation and the idea for this diagrammatic approach to the coloring problem
is due to G. Spencer-Brown [1979].
The existence of edge colorings for trivalent plane maps is equivalent to the
existence of formations for these maps. This point of view reveals structure.
For example, we see at once that the product of imaginary values (for a given
coloring) in the spin network calculation of the norm, ∥G∥, for planar G
is always equal to one. For each bounce contributes 1, while each crossing
contributes −1, and the number of crossings of a collection of Jordan curves
in the plane is even.
A deeper result has to do with parity. In an edge three coloring the parity
of the total number of alternating color cycles (called here cinguli) remains
unchanged under the operation of switching a pair of colors along a cingulus
(a simple operation). One can use the language of formations to prove this
result (see Spencer Brown [1979], Kauffman [1986], and compare with
Tutte [1948]).
In the language of formations a simple operation is accomplished by draw-
ing a curve of one color along a curve of the opposite color (red and blue
are opposite, as are red/blue alternating and purple). (Note that in a for-
mation the red cinguli index cycles of alternating red and purple, while the
blue cinguli index cycles of alternating blue and purple.)
After the curves
are superimposed, common colors are cancelled. This cancellation is called
idemposition. For example

While parity is preserved under simple operations, the parity necessarily
changes under a Spencer-Brown switching operation (G. Spencer-Brown

516
Kauffman / Knot Theory
[ch. 29
[1979]) at a ﬁve-region. Spencer-Brown’s operation is performed to replace
one extension problem by another. We are given a conﬁguration as shown
below:
Q
6
?
6
?
This conﬁguration, I shall call a Q-region. It has two missing edges denoted
by arrows. If these edges could be ﬁlled in to make a larger formation, the
result would be a coloring of a larger map.
The problem corresponds to having a map that is all colored except for one
ﬁve-sided region.
Problem 18. One wants to rearrange the colors on the given map so that
? 842.
the coloring can be extended over the ﬁve-sided region.
If one can always solve this problem then the four-color theorem follows from
it.
In the category of non-planar edge three-colorings it is possible for a Q-
region problem to have no solution involving only simple operations.
The switching operation replaces the Q-region by another Q-region, and
changes the parity in the process. In the language of formations, the switch
is performed by drawing a red curve that replaces one missing edge, idem-
poses one edge, and travels along a blue cingulus in the original formation to
complete its journey. See the example below.
Problem 19. Switching Conjecture: I conjecture that a Q-region in a
? 843.
planar formation that is unsolvable by simple operations before the Spencer-
Brown switch becomes solvable by simple operations after the switch.
Of course this conjecture would solve the four color problem, and one might
think that it is too good to be true. I encourage the reader to try it out on
formations of weight three (that is with exactly one red, one blue, and one
red/blue alternating cingulus). Q-regions at weight three are always unsolv-
able by simple operations. Switch a weight three Q-region problem and you
will ﬁnd higher weight (since parity changes and weight can’t go down).
The switching conjecture aside, it is now possible to indicate a proof of the
four color theorem that is due to G. Spencer-Brown.
Spencer-Brown’s Proof:
It suﬃces to consider a formation with a Q-region. If the weight is larger than

three then there is an extra cingulus (red, blue or red/blue alternator) other
than the three cinguli involved at the Q-region. If this extra cingulus can be
used in a sequence of simple operations to solve the Q-region then we are done.
If this cingulus can not be used in any such sequence, then the extra cingulus
is ineﬀective, and from the point of view of the Q-region it is invisible to
the problem. Hence the formation with an ineﬀective cingulus is structurally
smaller, and hence is solved by induction. If there is no extra cingulus in the
formation, then the weight is equal to three. Apply the switching operation.
Now the weight is greater than three. Hence there is an extra cingulus, and
the ﬁrst part of the argument applies. Q.E.D.
Problem 20. Understand this proof!
844. ?
The crux of the matter in bringing this proof to earth lies in understanding
the nature of an eﬀective cingulus. The proof is an extraordinary guide to
understanding the map color problem. In G. Spencer-Brown [1979] the
argument is extended to show that a formation with an extra cingulus can
always be solved by complex operations.
Of course one would like to know what is the relationship among quan-
tum physical, statistical mechanical and topological structures and these deep
combinatorial matters of the coloring problem. Full understanding of the four
color theorem awaits the unfolding of these relationships.
11. Mirror-Mirror
The last problem on this set is a conjecture about alternating knots that
are achiral. A knot is achiral if it is ambient isotopic to its mirror image.

518
Kauffman / Knot Theory
[ch. 29
We usually take the mirror image as obtained from the original diagram by
switching all the crossings. The mirror is the plane on which the diagram is
drawn.
Let G(K) denote the graph of the diagram K. That is, G(K) is obtained
from a checkerboard shading of the diagram K (unbounded region is shaded
white). Each black region determines a vertex for G(K). G(K) has an edge
for each crossing of K that is shared by shaded regions.
Let M(K) denote the cycle matroid of G(K) (See Welsh [1988] for the
deﬁnition of the matroid.). Let M ∗(K) denote the dual matroid of M(K).
Problem 21.
Conjecture. K is alternating, reduced and achiral, if and
? 845.
only if M(K) is isomorphic to M ∗(K) where M(K) is the cycle matroid of
G(K) and M ∗(K) is its dual.
This conjecture has its roots in the observation that for all the achiral
reduced alternating knots of less than thirteen crossings, the graphs G(K)
and G∗(K) (the planar dual) are isomorphic. One might conjecture that this
is always the case, but Murasugi has pointed out that it is not so (due to
ﬂyping—compare with Section 5). The matroid formulation of the conjecture
avoids this diﬃculty.

by Ross Geoghegan entitled Open Problems in Inﬁnite-Dimensional Topology,
which appeared in Geoghegan [1979]. That problem set was the result of
a satellite meeting of inﬁnite-dimensional topologists held at the 1979 Spring
Topology Conference in Athens, Ohio, for the purpose of updating an ear-
lier list published as an appendix to T. A. Chapman’s volume, Lectures on
Hilbert Cube Manifolds, in the C.B.M.S. series of the American Mathematical
Society (Chapman [1976]). That volume, the monograph Selected Topics in
Inﬁnite-Dimensional Topology, by Cz. Bessaga and A. Pelczy´nski [1975],
and the new text by J. van Mill [1989b] are the basic introductory sources
for the subject. However, the interested reader might well want to consult
Anderson [1972] and several other basic references for overlapping ﬁelds,
such as Borsuk [1967, 1975], Dydak and Segal [1978], Mardeˇsi´c and
Segal [1982], Hurewicz and Wallman [1948], Nagata [1965], Daver-
man [1986], Chapman [1983b], Anderson and Munkholm [1988], Anosov
[1969], Ballmann et al [1985], Gromov [1979, 1987], Brown [1982, 1989],
Beauzamy [1988].
In view of the amount of progress in the ﬁeld, it was generally recognized
ﬁve years ago that a revision of Geoghegan [1979] was desirable; however,
the revolution in the ﬁeld wrought by the work of A. N. Draniˇsnikov during
the last two years has made it imperative, since he has solved the problem
that was perhaps the main focus of Geoghegan [1979]. His negative solution
in Draniˇsnikov [1988a] of P. S. Alexandroff’s [1936] question Does in-
tegral cohomological dimension equal Lebesgue covering dimension on metric
compacta? solved at one stroke the most fundamental and resistant question
in the dimension theory of separable metric spaces and one of the most dif-
ﬁcult questions of the theory of ﬁnite- and inﬁnite- dimensional manifolds,
as well as one of the most diﬃcult problems of shape theory. Speciﬁcally,
Draniˇsnikov proved the following:
1.1. Theorem. There exists a compact metric space X of integral cohomo-
logical dimension c −dimZ(X) = 3 and dim(X) = ∞.
1.2. Corollary. (Edwards [1978], Walsh [1981]). There exists a cell-like
map f : X →Y of a 3-dimensional compactum onto an inﬁnite dimensional
compact metric space.
Draniˇsnikov, Dydak, and Walsh are planning a book on cohomological di-
mension theory which should be indispensable to an understanding of this
subject.
Inﬁnite-dimensional topology aspires to encompass all topological aspects
of all inﬁnite-dimensional spaces and subsets of interest in mathematics and
the applications of the ideas, techniques, and philosophy of the ﬁeld in ﬁnite-
525

dimensional settings. Of course, the possibilities, even obviously promising
ones, are far too numerous for the relatively small number of mathemati-
cians currently active in the ﬁeld to cover. As a result, the topics that have
been developed reﬂect in part the interests and backgrounds of the people
in the ﬁeld, in part the problems and developments of related disciplines,
and in part sheer chance.
Thus, interactions with stable homotopy the-
ory and K-theory have included spectacular results (Chapman [1974], Tay-
lor [1975], Ferry [1977b], Toru´nczyk [1977], Farrell and Hsiang [1981],
and Draniˇsnikov [1988a]), as well as applications of K-theoretic invariants
to the geometric topology of Q-manifolds analogous to the ﬁnite-dimensional
theory. On the other hand, the algebraic topology of function spaces and
automorphism groups has been essentially left to others, and, after the early
1970’s, a burgeoning investigation of topological questions connected with
Diﬀerential Topology, Diﬀerential Geometry, and Global Analysis has almost
ceased after early sweeping early successes.
Nevertheless, as emphasized by Geoghegan, there is a recognizable unity of
technique and of central problems to be met, and the ﬁeld has a distinct inter-
nal coherence despite the tendencies of individual researchers to concentrate
on problems associated with very diﬀerent disciplines, e.g., Dimension The-
ory, Geometry of Banach Spaces and allied Functional Analysis, Geometric
Topology of n-manifolds, Shape Theory, and Point-Set Topology.
The Problem List is traditionally limited to metric topology. I have made
no eﬀort to expand its scope. It is also usually broken into various sections,
to which format I have adhered.
I have also followed the custom of not
attributing problems to the people who submitted them. However, I want
to thank those who have done so as well as those who have given detailed
discussions of the current status of problems in Geoghegan [1979]. Without
their help, this problem list and update would not have been possible. These
people include C. Z. Bessaga, K. Brown, S. Ferry, R. Daverman, J. Dijkstra,
A. Draniˇsnikov, J. Dydak, T. Dobrowolski, F. T. Farrell, A. Fathi, S. Ferry,
R. Geoghegan, J. Henderson, M. R. Holmes, C .B. Hughes, J. Keesling, N.
Hingston, G .R. Livesay, E. Michael, J. van Mill, J. Mogilski, Nguyen To
Nhu, D. Repovˇs, J. Rogers, L. Rubin, K. Sakai, E. ˇSˇcepin, H. Toru´nczyk, Vo
Thanh Liem, J. Walsh, R. Wong, and D. Wright. The usual caveat should
be repeated here: with probability one, I have made errors of substance in
interpreting what is known and what is open. Also, some of the problems
may be mis-formulated, or trivial, or already solved. If an important topic is
omitted, as several are, it is because it was not represented in the submitted
problems and I did not feel competent to write on the topic myself. As a result,
for example, shape theory developments are primarily left to other sections
of this book, and the exciting area termed “Geometric Methods in Group
Theory” together with shape questions at the ends of Q-manifold K(π, 1)’s
is almost totally neglected, with regret. It will be treated in a forthcoming

article.
The symbol ≈will denote “is homeomorphic with”, and ≃means “homo-
topy equivalent with”.
2. CE: Cell-Like Images of ANR’s and Q-Manifolds
2.1. General Discussion
The acronym CE comes from Cellular Equivalent.
A set is cell-like (CE)
provided that it is compact, metric, and deforms to a point in each of its
neighborhoods in some, hence every, ANR in which it is embedded. (These
are the sets with the shape of a point.)
A proper map is a CE mapif it
is surjective and each point inverse is cell-like. The following theorem sum-
marizes various theorems about CE maps by Moore, Lacher, Armentrout,
Siebenmann, Chapman, and Kozlowski (cf. Lacher [1977] for an excellent
discussion and bibliography on the topic).
2.1.1. Theorem.
For a proper map f: X →Y between locally compact
metric spaces,
(1) if X and Y are ANR’s, the following are equivalent:
(a) f is CE.
(b) f is an hereditary homotopy equivalence.
(c) f is an hereditary shape equivalence.
(d) f is a ﬁne homotopy equivalence.
(2) if Y is ﬁnite-dimensional, the following are equivalent:
(a) f is CE.
(b) f is an hereditary shape equivalence.
(3) if X and Y are Q-manifolds or n-manifolds, the following are equivalent:
(unless n = 3 and counter-examples to the Poincar´e Conjecture are
present),
(a) f is CE.
(b) f is a uniform limit of homeomorphisms h: X →Y .
f is an hereditary homotopy equivalence provided that f: f −1(U) →U is a
proper homotopy equivalence for each open set U ⊂Y ; it is an hereditary
shape equivalence if f: f −1(A) →A is a shape equivalence for each closed
subset A ⊂Y ; it is a ﬁne homotopy equivalence if it is an α-equivalence for
all open covers α of Y; it is an α-equivalence if it has an α-homotopy inverse,
i.e., a map g: Y →X and homotopies F: g ◦f ≃idX and G: f ◦g ≃idY such
that G is limited by α and F is limited by f −1(α) = {f −1(U) | U ∈α}. (G is
limited by α provided that each homotopy track G(x×I) lies in some member
of α.)
CE maps lie at the heart of manifold topology and ANR theory. Note that
by their very nature, the existence of a CE map f: X →Y onto an ANR

528

[ch. 30
or manifold gives little information about the local properties of the domain
(although, being acyclic, f is a ˇCech cohomology isomorphism by the Vietoris-
Begle Theorem). The natural questions, then, concern what may be inferred
about the target from information about the domain. These questions are
extremely important in applications.
This is seen in its purest form in the theory of Q-manifolds, and there,
in the proof of H. Toru´nczyk’s topological characterization of Hilbert cube
manifolds Toru´nczyk [1980] (cf. Edwards [1978]):
2.1.2. Theorem. A locally compact ANR is a Q-manifold if and only if each
pair g, h: Q →X of maps of Q into X may be approximated by maps with
disjoint images.
The proof proceeds by ﬁrst ﬁnding a CE resolution f: M Q →X of X
by a Q-manifold, and then by approximating f with a homeomorphism.
(There is an analogous program for characterizing n-manifolds, beginning
with a compact ANR homology manifold, employing Quinn’s Resolution The-
orem (Quinn [1983, 1987]) to obtain a CE resolution by an n-manifold, and
Edwards’ Theorem (Daverman [1986]) or (Quinn’s depression of it into 4-
manifolds 1982b]) to approximate the CE map by a homeomorphism if the
ANR has Cannon’s Disjoint Discs Property (DD2P), which is the same as
the approximation hypothesis in Toru´nczyk’s Theorem except Q is replaced
by D2. At the moment, it is unknown whether the integral obstruction to CE
resolution encountered by Quinn is ever realized (Good Problem!), but the
theory is extraordinarily successful in its present form owing to the fact that
the obstruction vanishes if any point of X has an Euclidean neighborhood.)
Surprisingly, in the absence of an hypothesis such as ﬁnite-dimensionality
or ANR on both domain and range, CE maps may fail to be even shape equiv-
alences. The following collects work of Taylor [1975], Keesling [1975], Ed-
wards [1978], Draniˇsnikov [1988a, 19∞b], van Mill [1981], Kozlowski
et al [1981], and Walsh [1981]:
2.1.3. Theorem.
(1) There exists a CE map from an inﬁnite dimensional metric compactum
onto the Hilbert cube that is not a shape equivalence.
(2) There exists a CE map from the Hilbert cube to a compactum every
point inverse of which is a Hilbert cube that is not a shape equivalence.
(3) For each n ≥6, there exist CE maps from compact n-dimensional
manifolds to inﬁnite-dimensional compacta.
The main questions in this section remain as in Geoghegan [1979]: Let
f: X →Y be CE, where X and Y are locally compact.
Question 1 If X is an ANR, under what conditions is Y an ANR?
? 846.

§2]
CE: Cell-Like Images of ANR’s and Q-Manifolds
529
Question 2 If X is a Q-manifold, under what circumstances is Y also a 847. ?
Q-manifold?
A most common occurrence of CE maps is in decompositions or as quo-
tient maps. In this context, one usually knows the domain and that the map
is CE, but one may not know that the map is a shape equivalence (Tay-
lor [1975]), much less that it preserves the ANR property (Keesling [1975],
Kozlowski [19∞]). In fact, a CE map f: X →Y between locally compact
metric spaces with X ﬁnite dimensional will preserve the ANR property if
and only if it is an hereditary shape equivalence which is equivalent to the
requirement that it raises the dimension of no saturated closed subset of X
(as hereditary shape equivalences cannot raise dimension) (Kozlowski [19∞]
(cf. Ancel [1985]), Addis and Gresham [1978], Gresham [1980]). There
are good discussions in Geoghegan [1979], Walsh [1981], Draniˇsnikov
and ˇSˇcepin [1986], and Mitchell and Repovˇs [19∞].
2.2. Progress on Problems of Section CE
The 1979 Problem List gave 11 problems connected with Questions 1 and 2.
Here, they will be denoted by (79CE1), etc. Eight of these have been explicitly
solved in the ensuing decade. In particular, Question 2 above is now well
understood due to the eﬀorts primarily of Daverman and Walsh. The thrust
of this development is that by Toru´nczyk’s Characterization of Q-manifolds,
Question 2 reduces ﬁrst to Question 1 and then to consideration of the general
position property that any two maps of Q into Y should be approximable by
maps with disjoint images. This is easily seen to be equivalent to the disjoint
n-discs property for all n (DDnP), which is the same general position property
for each n-cell. Daverman and Walsh provided a reduction of that property,
and hence of Toru´nczyk’s Criterion, to DD2P plus for each n > 2 a disjoint
ˇCech homology carriers property which is vastly more easy to apply, which
they did.
CE 1 (79CE1) If f: X →Y is surjective with X an ANR and each f −1(y) is
an AR, must Y be an AR?
No, van Mill [1981]. This problem is originally from Borsuk [1967]. Adding
work of Kozlowski et al [1981] and Draniˇsnikov [1988a] provides counter-
examples with all f −1(y) ≈D7.
CE 2 (79CE2) If f: X →Y is approximately right invertible, and X is a 848. ?
compact ANR, must Y be an ANR? an FANR?
Open. Toru´nczyk (unpublished) has proved this under the additional hypoth-
esis that Y be LC1. Y must be movable. (Y is approximately right invertible

530
West / Infinite Dimensional Topology
[ch. 30
if for all ϵ > 0 there is a map g: Y →X such that f ◦g is ϵ-close to the identity.
FANR is the Shape version of ANR, and is equivalent to shape domination
by a ﬁnite CW-complex.)
CE 3 (79CE3) If f: X →Y is a reﬁnable map and X is a compact ANR,
? 849.
must Y be an ANR? an FANR?
Open. Ford and Rogers introduced reﬁnable maps in Ford and Rogers [1978]
and showed that under these hypotheses, f is approximately right invertible.
Ford and Kozlowski showed that Y is an ANR if X is ﬁnite-dimensional and
Y is LC1 (Ford and Kozlowski [1980]). (Reﬁnable maps are those that
may be uniformly approximated by maps with point inverses all of diameter
less than ϵ for each ϵ > 0.) With X a compact ANR, f must be approxi-
mately right invertible. The problem is reduced by Toru´nczyk to determining
whether Y is LC1 (cf. remark to CE2.)
CE 4 (79CE4) Let f: Dn →Y be a CE map. Must Y be an AR?
No.
This is open for n = 4 and 5 (CE12).
Kozlowski showed CE4 is in
general equivalent to the non-existence of dimension-raising CE mappings of
metric compacta in Kozlowski [19∞] (cf. van Mill [1986], Nowak [1985]
for explicit alternative analyses); Edwards and Walsh showed that the exis-
tence of a CE dimension-raising map deﬁned on a compactum of dimension
n is equivalent to the existence of a counter example to Alexandroﬀ’s Prob-
lem of integral cohomology dimension n (Edwards [1978], Walsh [1981]);
Draniˇsnikov gave a counter-example to Alexandroﬀ’s Problem of integral co-
homological dimension 3 in Draniˇsnikov [1988a] and a counter example to
CE4 for n = 6 in Draniˇsnikov [19∞a] and has recently eliminated the case
n = 6 in Draniˇsnikov [19∞b]. It is known that no CE map of a space of
dimension 1 raises dimension. Dimension 2 is open and already a good prob-
lem (cf. Daverman [19∞] for current progress.) However, no cell-like map
deﬁned on a 2-dimensional AR raises dimension Schori [1980]. For mani-
folds, R. L. Moore’s great theorem Moore [1932] rules out dimension 2 and
Kozlowski and Walsh [1983] rules out dimension 3.
CE 5 (79CE5) If in (79CE4) the non-degenerate point inverses are arcs, must
? 850.
Y be an AR?
Open. Of interest because of its connection with decomposition space ques-
tions.
CE 6 (79CE6) If X = Dn or Rn and f: X →Y is CE, must Y be contractible?

§2]
CE: Cell-Like Images of ANR’s and Q-Manifolds
531
No. van Mill [1986] and Nowak [1985] showed this would imply the non-
existence of dimension-raising CE maps. The precise range of the phenomenon
is unknown.
CE 7 (79CE7) Produce a direct proof that if f: M 2n+1 →Y is a CE map,
M is a manifold without boundary, and Y is ﬁnite-dimensional (equivalently,
is an ANR) and has the DDP, then Y has the DDnP.
Done by Bryant [1986].
CE 8 (79CE8) If f: Q →Y is a CE map onto an AR, must Y ≈Q if
(1) the collection of non-degenerate point inverses is null (at most ﬁnitely
many of diameter > ϵ for each ϵ > 0) or
(2) the closure in Y of the non-degeneracy set (the set of points with non-
degenerate point inverses) is zero-dimensional?
No. Daverman and Walsh [1981], or more concretely by applying the in-
ﬂation technique of Daverman [1981] to Daverman and Walsh [1983a].
CE 9 (79CE9) Let f: Q →Y be a CE map with Y an AR. Suppose that 851. ?
Y × F ≈Q for some ﬁnite-dimensional compactum F. Must Y × In ≈Q for
some n? What about n = 2 or n = 1?
Yes. Daverman and Walsh [1981] showed that Y ×I2 ≈Q. The case n = 1
is open.
CE 10 (79CE10) If f: Q →Y is a CE map with a countable set of non-
degenerate point inverses, each of which is cellular, is Y ≈Q? What about
Y × I?
No. The second counter-example to (CE8) is a counter to this; in this case,
Y × I ≈Q.
(Here, cellular means ∞
i=1 Ki, where the Ki’s are a nested
sequence of co-dimension zero Hilbert cubes with bi-collared boundaries.)
CE 11 (79CE11) If f: Q →Q is a CE map with zero-dimensional non-
degeneracy set, is each point inverse cellular?
No. Daverman has done this.

Other problems involving CE maps appear in other sections.
3. D: Dimension
3.1. Introduction
This is another section that has seen great advances in the past decade. Di-
mension Theory is a mature and complex subject, and this List only discusses
some aspects of it that seem closely tied to the inﬁnite-dimensional manifolds
either through interest or common technique. The connection has been pri-
marily through the CE mapping problem and related questions. At present,
the interaction is more intense than ever before. Some references in dimension
theory, some with open questions and extensive bibliography are Hurewicz
and Wallman [1948], Nagata [1965], Engelking [1978], Pasynkov et
al [1979], Engelking [1980], Engelking and Pol [1983], Walsh [1981],
Rubin [1986], Draniˇsnikov and ˇSˇcepin [1986].
The three most outstanding results are:
• The Edwards-Walsh proof (Edwards [1978], Walsh [1981]) that there
exist cell-like dimension-raising mappings of manifolds if and only if
there exist inﬁnite-dimensional metric compacta of ﬁnite integral coho-
mological dimension.
• Draniˇsnikov’s [1988a] proof that there exists an inﬁnite-dimensional
compact metric space X with integral cohomological dimension three.

§3]
D: Dimension
533
• Pol’s [1981] construction of an inﬁnite-dimensional compact metric
space that is neither countable dimensional nor strongly inﬁnite dimen-
sional.
A space X is strongly inﬁnite dimensional provided that it contains an in-
ﬁnite essential family {(Ai, Bi)}∞
i=1, i.e., a sequence of disjoint pairs of closed
subsets with the property that if {Si}∞
i=1 is a collection of closed separators
of the (Ai, Bi)’s (Si separates Ai and Bi), then ∞
i=1 Si ̸= ∅. It is weakly
inﬁnite dimensional if not strongly inﬁnite dimensional. There are two vari-
ants of weak inﬁnite dimensionality: X is weakly inﬁnite dimensional in the
sense of Alexandroﬀ(AWID) provided that for each sequence {(Ai, Bi)}∞
i=1
as above, there is a sequence {Si}∞
i=1 of separators with ∞
i=1 Si = ∅; it is
weakly inﬁnite dimensional in the sense of Smirnoﬀ(SWID) provided that
the separators may always be chosen so that n
i=1 Si = ∅for some n depend-
ing on {(Ai, Bi)}∞
i=1. If the n is independent of {(Ai, Bi)}∞
i=1, then X has
dimension ≤n. A space is said to be of countable dimension provided that it
is a countable union of ﬁnite-dimensional subsets. Note that there is an ob-
vious formulation of these essential families deﬁnitions in terms of mappings
into In and Q.
A space X is of cohomological dimension ≤n with respect to the abelian
group G ( dimG(X) ≤n) provided that for each closed subset A ⊂X the
inclusion homomorphism
i∗: Hn(X; G) →Hn(A; G)
is surjective. There is an obvious extension for any cohomology theory.
It is well known that all the above deﬁnitions agree for ﬁnite dimensional
compact metric spaces with Lebesgue’s covering dimension and inductive di-
mension (Hurewicz and Wallman [1948], Walsh [1981]) provided that one
uses G = Z. Since Hn(A; G) is naturally equivalent to the set of homotopy
classes [A, K(G, n)] of maps into an Eilenberg-MacLane space of type (G, n),
this may be given a uniﬁed treatment (cf. Walsh [1981]).
3.2. Progress on Problems of Section D
D 1 (79D) If f: X →Y is a CE map with X compact and ﬁnite dimensional,
must Y be ﬁnite-dimensional?
No.
By combined eﬀorts of Draniˇsnikov [1988a], Edwards [1978], and
Walsh [1981]. Yes, if X is a 3-manifold, Kozlowski and Walsh [1983].
D 2 (79D1) (Alexandroﬀ) Is there an inﬁnite-dimensional compact metric
space with ﬁnite integral cohomological dimension?
Yes. Draniˇsnikov [1988a].

such that in the following sequence every ﬁnite composition is essential?

p1 f2
−→Sn+p1 f1

Open. The primary interest in this problem was a claim by R. Edwards that
such a system implies the existence of a dimension-raising cell-like map. It is
at present unknown whether there exists any inﬁnite sequence of dimension
lowering maps of spheres each ﬁnite composition of which is essential.
D 4 (79D3) Classify “Taylor examples”. In other words, what kinds of com-
? 857.
pacta can occur as CE images of Q?
Open. Taylor [1975] used Adams’ [1966] inverse system similar to the one
above to produce a map from the inverse limit to Q. There is relevant work
in Daverman and Walsh [1983b]. Devinatz et al [1988] probably implies
a classiﬁcation of all examples of the sort constructed by Taylor.
D 5 (79D4) Does every inﬁnite-dimensional compact ANR contain n-dimen-
? 858.
sional closed sets for each n?
Open.
D 6 (79D5) Let X be a compact AR such that for every ﬁnite-dimensional
? 859.
compact subset A ⊂X and every open set U ⊂X H∗(U, U −A) = 0. If X
has the DD2P, then must X have the DDnP for all n?
Open.
D 7 (79D6) Does there exist an inﬁnite-dimensional compactum which is
neither of countable dimension nor strong inﬁnite dimension?
Yes. This question of P. Alexandroﬀis answered by the example in Pol [1981].

863. ?
Property C lies between countable dimensionality and AWID. A space X has
Property C provided that for each sequence {U}∞
i=1 of open covers there is
an open cover V = ∞
i=1 Vi, where each Vi is a collection of pairwise disjoint
open sets reﬁning Ui. It is known (Rohm [19∞a, 19∞b]) that products of σ-
compact C spaces are C-spaces and that the product of an AWID compactum
with a C-space is AWID.
D 12 Is there a compact metric space of Pol type (i.e., neither strongly 864. ?
inﬁnite dimensional nor countably inﬁnite dimensional) containing no strongly
inﬁnite dimensional subspace? What about strongly countable dimensional
subspaces?
Pol’s example has both; it also has Property C.

If so, then Draniˇsnikov can show that the answer to part (2) of (D14) above
is “Yes”.

4. SC: Shapes of Compacta
4.1. Introduction
Shape Theory and Inﬁnite-Dimensional Topology have been interacting deeply
since the inception of each. Quite possibly the most fruitful interaction was
also one of the earliest: Chapman’s Complement Theorem, which states that
two metric compacta are of the same shape if and only if, when embedded in
the Hilbert cube as Z-sets (i.e., π∗(U, U −X) = 0 for each open set U ⊂Q),
their complements are homeomorphic and goes on to provide a category iso-
morphism with a weak proper homotopy category of the complements (Chap-
man [1972]). This suggested the question: If we use proper homotopy, what
is the relation to Shape Theory? This spawned what is now known as Strong
Shape. Quite a few of the deeper questions in Shape Theory are particularly
diﬃcult or false for the inﬁnite-dimensional spaces, e.g., Whitehead theorems,
pointed versus unpointed shape, and CE maps. Note that Draniˇsnikov’s ex-
ample together with the analyses of Kozlowski [19∞] and Edwards [1978],
Walsh [1981] imply that CE maps of ﬁnite-dimensional compacta need not
be Shape equivalences if the images are not ﬁnite-dimensional. A point of
philosophy that bears repetition is that many phenomena of homotopy the-
ory that involve inﬁnite sequences of spaces of ever increasing dimension may
be realized as geometrical properties of the inﬁnite dimensional compacta or
at the ends of locally compact manifolds.
For maps, Shape equivalence and Strong Shape equivalence have quite con-
crete characterizations: an inclusion of metric compacta i: A →X is a Shape
equivalence provided that
1. each map f: A →K extends to a map F: X →K, whenever K is a
CW-complex, and
2. all such extensions are homotopic.
A map f: X →Y of metric compacta is a shape equivalence provided that the
inclusion of X into the mapping cylinder Mf of f is a shape equivalence; f is

a strong shape equivalence if in addition, the inclusion of X into the double
mapping cylinder Mf ∪X Mf is a shape equivalence.
The problems in this section are limited to those that are directly concerned
with constructions and phenomena arising in the Q-manifold setting, or di-
rectly related to it. For shape theory per se and its applications to the theory
of continua, the reader should consult other sources.
4.2. Progress on Problems of Section SC
SC 1 (79SC1) Can cell-like maps raise dimension?
Yes. Draniˇsnikov [1988a].
SC 2 (79SC2) If f: X →Y is a CE map with non-degeneracy set of countable
dimension, must f be a shape equivalence?
No. Daverman and Walsh [1983a].
SC 3 (79SC3) Let M
f→X
g←N be a diagram of CE maps, where both M 872. ?
and N are compact Q-manifolds and X is a metric compactum. Is there a
homeomorphism h: M →N such that g ◦h is arbitrarily close to f?
Open. Ferry has provided an uncontrolled homeomorphism (but not a con-
trolled one) M ≈N, which allows the assignment of a unique simple homotopy
type to X, that carried by M. He has also shown that the natural idea of
declaring CE maps of compacta to be simple homotopy equivalences produces
only homotopy theory, even if one restricts attention to ﬁnite-dimensional
spaces dominated by compact polyhedra Ferry [1980b], cf. Ferry [1981a].
SC 4 (79SC4) If X and Y are shape equivalent UV 1 compacta, is there a 873. ?
ﬁnite diagram
X = X0 ←→X1 ←→. . . ←→Xn = Y
where each ←→is an hereditary shape equivalence either from Xi to Xi+1 or
from Xi+1 to Xi?
Open.
An hereditary shape equivalence is a map f: X →Y such that for
each closed subset A of Y , f | f −1(A): f −1(A) →A is a shape equivalence.
This problem is solved aﬃrmatively if X and Y are 1-dimensional (Daver-
man and Venema [1987a]). This sort of chain of equivalences deﬁnes the
concept “hereditary shape equivalent”. In this way, we get “CE equivalent”,
etc.
Kozlowski [19∞] showed that for ﬁnite dimensional spaces, heredi-
tary shape equivalence coincides with CE equivalence, cf. Dydak and Se-
gal [1978]. Ferry [1980a] has shown that the UV 1 condition is necessary,

538

[ch. 30
even for 1-dimensional continua. A compact metric space X is UV k provided
it embeds in Q so that for each neighborhood U of X in Q, there is a smaller
one V such that the inclusion V →U is zero on πi for all i ≤k. There
is much relevant work in this general area. See Taylor [1975], Edwards
and Hastings [1976b], Ferry [1980b, 1980c], Hastings [1983], Daver-
man and Venema [1987a, 1987b], Ferry [1987], Mrozik [19∞a, 19∞b]
Krasinkiewicz [1977, 1978], Ferry [19∞b]. In particular,
• Taylor [1975] shows that CE equivalent inﬁnite dimensional continua
need not be shape equivalent.
• Edwards and Hastings [1976b] show shape equivalent compacta are
strong-shape equivalent.
• Ferry [1980b] shows that for compacta homotopy equivalence implies
CE equivalence.
• Ferry [1980c] shows that a compactum X is shape equivalent with an
LCn continuum if and only if pro-πk(X) is stable for each k < n and
is Mittag-Leﬄer for k = n. It also shows that a compactum X with
pro-π1(X) trivial is shape equivalent with a compactum Y for which
the shape and strong shape are indistinguishable by ﬁnite dimensional
compacta.
• Hastings [1983] shows that suspensions of strong shape equivalences
are CE equivalences, so that suspensions of shape equivalent compacta
are CE equivalent.
• Daverman and Venema [1987a] show that CE equivalence agrees with
shape equivalence for locally connected, one dimensional compacta and
generalizes the example of Ferry [1980a] to give for each n ≥1, n-di-
mensional LCn−2 continua shape equivalent with Sn but not CE equiv-
alent with Sn.
• Chigogidze [1989] shows that shape equivalent LCn compacta are
UV n-equivalent.
• Daverman and Venema [1987b] show that locally connected continua
are homotopy equivalent if and only if they are CE equivalent in the
category of locally connected continua.
• Ferry [1987] shows that UV k-equivalent k-dimensional compacta are
shape equivalent and that, conversely, if X is a continuum with pro-
π1(X) proﬁnite, then continua shape equivalent with X are UV k equiv-
alent with it for all k.

§4]
SC: Shapes of Compacta
539
• Mrozik [19∞a, 19∞b] shows that if X is a continuum with pro-π1(X)
not proﬁnite, then there are continua shape equivalent with X that are
not CE equivalent with X.
• Krasinkiewicz [1977] shows that continuous images of pointed-1-mova-
ble continua are pointed-1-movable, and Krasinkiewicz [1978] shows
that pointed-1-movable continua are shape equivalent with locally con-
nected continua.
• Ferry [19∞b] shows that for continua, proﬁniteness of pro-π1 is equiv-
alent to every continuum in the shape class being the continuous image
of a CE set, which is equivalent to every continuum in the shape class
being the continuous image of a UV 1 continuum.
SC 5 (79SC5) Characterize ANR divisors. Is the property of being an ANR 874. ?
divisor invariant under shape domination?
Open.
P is an ANR divisor if there is an embedding of P in some ANR
X such that X/P is an ANR. Dydak has shown ﬁnite shape dimensional P
are ANR divisors if and only if they are nearly 1-movable and have stable
pro-homology (cf. Dydak [1978, 1979]).
SC 6 (79SC6) When is the one-point compactiﬁcation of a locally compact 875. ?
ANR an ANR?
Open. Note that if X is compact and embedded in Y , then Y/X is the one-
point compactiﬁcation of Y −X. If Y * is the one-point compactiﬁcation of
Y , then Dydak’s characterization of ﬁnite dimensional ANR divisors extends
to (SC6): Y * is an ANR if and only if the end of Y is nearly 1-movable and
has stable pro-homology. The interesting case is the inﬁnite dimensional one.
Dydak has an example of an ANR divisor of inﬁnite shape dimension and thus
not an FANR (i.e., not shape dominated by a ﬁnite complex). This problem is
quite important. For example, the classiﬁcation of compact Lie group actions
on Q that are free oﬀa single ﬁxed point needs this as an ingredient. (See
Section GA in this Problem List and the discussion in Geoghegan [1979].)
SC 7 (79SC7) Is there a theory like that of Chapman and Siebenmann [1976] 876. ?
for completing a non-compact Q-manifold into a compact one by adding a
shape Z-set?
A closed subset A ⊂X of a locally compact ANR is a Z-set if for every
open cover U of X there is a homotopy F: X × I →X that is limited by U
and stationary oﬀthe star st(A) of A in U such that f0 = idX and for each
t > 0, ft(X) ⊂X −A. If we require only ft(X −A) to miss A for t > 0, and
only that f be supported on st(A, U), then A is a shape Z-set.

Open. However, for n-manifolds, the complement theorem of Liem and Ven-
ema [19∞] captures the essence of this question and goes beyond it.
SC 9 (79SC9) Let X be an FANR and a Z-set in Q, and let h be a homeo-

morphism of X that is homotopic to the identity in each of its neighborhoods
in Q. Is there a nested sequence Mi ⊇Mi+1 of compact Q-manifold neigh-
borhoods of X with ∞
i=1 Mi = X and an extension of h to a homeomorphism
H of Q such that for all i, H(Mi) = Mi?
Open. It implies all compact FANR’s are pointed FANR’s, a result obtained
by Hastings and Heller [1982].
SC 10 (79SC10) If X and Y are Z-sets in Q and if f: Q −X →Q −Y
? 879.
is a proper map that is a weak proper homotopy equivalence, is it a proper
homotopy equivalence? In other words, is every shape equivalence of metric
compacta a strong shape equivalence?
Open. Two proper maps f, g: X →Y are weakly properly homotopic provided
that there is for each compact set C ⊆Y a compact set K ⊇f −1(C)∪g−1(C)
and a homotopy F: X ×I →Y from f to g such that F((X −K)×I)∩C = ∅.
D. Edwards and Hastings have proved that every weak proper homotopy
equivalence is weakly properly homotopic to a proper one (Edwards and
Hastings [1976b]). This shows that shape equivalent compacta are strong-
shape equivalent.
SC 11 (79SC11) Let X and Y be connected Z-sets in Q. Let base rays be

chosen for the ends of Q −X and Q −Y . Let f: Q −X →Q −Y be a proper,
base ray preserving map that is invertible in “base ray preserving weak proper
homotopy” theory. Is f a proper homotopy equivalence?
Open. This would be true if Q were ﬁnite dimensional. Dydak and Ge-
oghegan [1986a, 1986b] have made signiﬁcant progress on this topic. For
shape theoretic reformulations of (79SC10) and (79SC11), see Dydak and

This is true for compacta such that pro-π1 is proﬁnite (Ferry [1987]).

two countable dimensional compacta, then ind(Y ) ≤β(ind(X))?

X and Y CE equivalent? Are they UV ω-equivalent?
SC 19 Let X be a ﬁnitely dominated compactum with Euler characteristic 888. ?
χ(X) = 0. Is the Nielsen number of the identity map of X always zero?
In Geoghegan [1981], it is shown that this is equivalent with a conjecture
of H. Bass concerning the integrality of the Hattori trace. He shows that it
is true provided that ˜K0(Z[π1(X)]) is torsion, which obtains, for example,
when π1(X) is ﬁnite. Geoghegan’s argument makes use of Ferry’s solution
(Ferry [1981a, 1980b]) of a problem of J.H.C. Whitehead which shows that
for all ﬁnitely presented groups G, all elements of ˜K0(Z[G]) may be realized as
the obstructions to homotopy-ﬁniteness of ﬁnitely dominated metric continua
X with π1(X) = G. See also Edwards and Geoghegan [1975].

One’s Euler characteristic depends on one’s homology or cohomology theory.
5. ANR: Questions About Absolute Neighborhood Retracts
5.1. Introduction
The term ANR will be used indiscriminately to denote “absolute neighbor-
hood retract for metric spaces” and “absolute neighborhood extensor for met-
ric spaces”. The characterization of inﬁnite dimensional ANR’s in a practical
way is one of the most resistant of problems. This is now the hard part of
identifying inﬁnite-dimensional manifolds. The majority of the problems in
this entire problem set are concerned with ANR’s and the ANR property and
are distributed under the other headings, so this section is short, but not
by neglect of the topic. Repeated here are three useful suﬃcient conditions
collected in Geoghegan [1979] that do not appear in the textbooks:
• A locally contractible metric space that is of countable dimension or has
Property C is an ANR (Geoghegan and Haver [1976]), Addis and
Gresham [1978], Gresham [1980], Ancel [1985]).
• X is an ANR iﬀfor some space E, X × E has a basis of open sets such
that the intersection of any ﬁnite subcollection is either empty or path
connected and with trivial homotopy groups (Toru´nczyk [1978]).
• Y is an ANR if there are an ANR X and a map f: X →Y onto a dense
subset of Y such that for any open cover V of Y there is a homotopy
ht from f to fgf that is limited by V. Kozlowski [19∞], Coram et
al [1985].
On the other hand, two excellent counter examples to two reasonable conjec-
tures are:
• It is not suﬃcient to postulate a basis of contractible open sets, even for
compacta Borsuk [1967, Chapter 5, Section 11] (Cf. Daverman and
Walsh [1983b]).
• It is not suﬃcient to postulate that maps deﬁned on compact sets may
be extended continuously (van Mill [1986]).

homeomorphisms in X?
Open. A subset A of X is termed hazy (Kozlowski) if the inclusion U −A →U
is a homotopy equivalence for each open set U of X.
The point is that
Kozlowski has shown that if X −X0 is hazy and X0 is an ANR, then X is an
ANR, and the two X0’s are known to be ANR’s, Haver [1973], Keesling and
Wilson [1975]. In the second part, it is known that the relevant inclusions

X has the compact extension property provided that each map into X deﬁned
on a compact metric space A extends to any separable metric space containing
A. This is proposed in light of van Mill’s [1986] example which is a space
with the compact extension property that is not an ANR.
Many more problems and questions concerning ANR’s occur throughout
this chapter. See especially the sections on homeomorphism spaces and linear
spaces.
6. QM: Topology of Q-manifolds
6.1. Introduction
For background, the two generally available sources are Chapman [1976] and
the new book by van Mill [1989b]. The essential advance covered in van
Mill’s book but not in Chapman’s is also the most important theorem in the
subject: Toru´nczyk’s Characterization Theorem (Toru´nczyk [1980]) which
states that a locally compact ANR X is a Q-manifold if and only if for each
n and each ϵ > 0 each pair of maps f, g: In →X may be ϵ-approximated
by maps with disjoint images. (It is interesting that Toru´nczyk and Cannon
divined the same concept at the same time, and apparently totally indepen-
dently.) This result, and its reﬁnement by Daverman and Walsh [1981] to a
question of maps of D2 and disjoint carriers for ˇCech homology n-cycles, pro-
vides an extremely eﬀective tool for identifying Q-manifolds. (The diﬃculty
now rests primarily in veriﬁcation of the ANR property, which is still a ma-
jor diﬃculty for strongly inﬁnite-dimensional spaces.) The emphasis has thus
shifted from questions of identiﬁcation to questions of structure and maps.

546
West / Infinite Dimensional Topology
[ch. 30
Here, f is an α-equivalence provided it is a homotopy equivalence and there are
a homotopy inverse g of f and homotopies F: gf ≃idN and G: fg ≃idM that
are limited by the open covers α and f −1(α), respectively. This is still a very
good problem. There has been much recent work on the general topic of Con-
trolled topology, Cf. Connell and Hollingsworth [1969], Quinn [1979,
1982a, 1982b, 1983, 1987], Chapman [1983b, 1984], Daverman [1986], An-
derson and Munkholm [1988].
Ferry [1977b] and Toru´nczyk [1977]
proved that the homeomorphism group of a compact Q-manifold is an ANR,
from which is drawn in Ferry [1977b] the fact that suﬃciently ﬁne covers
α will do.
(This is one version of Ferry’s α-approximation theorem.
Cf.
Chapman and Ferry [1979], Ferry [1979].)
In general, it is important
to know the analog of this for the more general controlled set-up where N
is equipped with a control map p: N →X, for various kinds of spaces X.
The general problem is obstructed, but there are many cases in which it is
not. (See also Chapman [1980, 1981a, 1982, 1983a, 1983c], Anderson and
Hsiang [1976, 1977, 1980], Chapman and Ferry [1977, 1978, 19∞, 1979,
1983], Hughes [1983, 1985, 1987, 1988], Hughes et al [19∞a], Ferry and

West [1989]).

of M by contractible open sets such that the intersections of subcollections of
U are either contractible or void. Is M homeomorphic with N(U) × Q?
Open. Here, N(U) is the nerve. The hypotheses guarantee that the barycen-
tric maps M →N(U) are homotopy equivalences.
The α-approximation
theorem says “Yes” for suﬃciently ﬁne U. Does Cauty [1986] bear on this?
QM 5 (79QM5) Is there a Q-manifold version of Quinn’s End theorems?
? 906.
A version of this was done in Chapman [1982]. There is continuing work on
controlled topology of Q-manifolds within which there is room for a re-working
of this result. (See, for example, a sequence of papers by Chapman [1980] and
Hughes [1983, 1985, 1987], Hughes et al [19∞a].) There is more to be said
on this topic. The Farrell-Jones controlled h-cobordism theorem with foliated
control space with hyperbolic leaves (Farrell and Jones [1988a, 1988b])
should also be investigated in this context.
The issue is structure on the
control space involving objects where there is no obstruction and control is
transverse to them. On the general topic, Quinn has suggested that his Finite
Structure Spectrum in Quinn [1979, 1982a, 1982b] be reworked from a Q-
manifold point of view. Perhaps Toru´nczyk and West [1989] will be useful
here.

p: N →B are maps such that (1) p is UV 1 and (2) f is a p−1(δ)-equivalence,
then f is p−1(ϵ)-homotopic to a homeomorphism?
Yes. Chapman [1983a] has done this in a more general form over ﬁnite di-
mensional compact metric B with ﬁber conditions more general than the UV 1
condition here. Of interest is the case that B is not of ﬁnite dimension. The
problem is reformulated with B an arbitrary metric compactum is (QM26).
QM 7 (79QM7) If Y is a locally compact polyhedron, when can one add a
compactum A to Y so that Y ∪A is a compact ANR and A is a Z-set in

If and only if the Chapman and Siebenmann [1976] obstruction vanishes.
This is equivalent to the stabilized question. See the discussion following.
QM 8 (79QM8) If Y is a locally compact ANR such that the Q-manifold
Y × Q can be compactiﬁed by adding a compact Z-set A (in which case the
compactiﬁcation is a Q-manifold), is it possible to compactify Y by adding a
compact Z-set?
Yes. The closure in Y × Q ∪A of Y × {0} is the sought ANR compactiﬁca-

locally compact polyhedron and the ﬁbers are Q-manifolds. Does there exist
a locally compact polyhedron P, a PL map q: P →B, and a ﬁber preserving
homeomorphism h: M →P × Q?
Open. The compact-ﬁber case was established by in Chapman and Ferry
[19∞] (cf. Burghelea [1983].) The general case does not appear to be in
the literature. There is now no reason to restrict the question to polyhedral
bases.

F?
Here, compactiﬁcation is taken in the sense of Chapman and Siebenmann
[1976]. This was done over any compact polyhedral base in Metcalf [1985].

QM 11 (79QM11) Is every Hurewicz ﬁbration over a compact ANR base with
compact Q-manifold ﬁbers a locally trivial bundle?
No. In Toru´nczyk and West [1989] is given an example of a ﬁbration of
a Hilbert cube by convex Hilbert cubes over a Hilbert cube that is not a
bundle. Also given is a ﬁbred version of Toru´nczyk’s criterion that detects
bundles among the ﬁbrations with compact ANR ﬁbers (In Chapman and
Ferry [1977] it is shown that if the base is locally ﬁnite dimensional, then
the ﬁbration is always a bundle.)

Open. Note that the answer is “No” if “Hurewicz ﬁbration” is weakened to
“cell-like map with discs as point inverses”, as a consequence of Draniˇsnikov
[1988a].
QM 13 (79QM13) Let p: M →S2 be an approximate ﬁbration, where M is

Open. This is not true for p: M →S1, Ferry [1977a].
QM 14 (79QM14-16) Let p: M →B be an approximate ﬁbration with M a
compact Q-manifold and B a compact polyhedron. What is the obstruction
to:
(1) approximating p by an h-block bundle map,
(2) deforming p to an h-block bundle map,
(3) approximating p by locally trivial bundle maps,
(4) deforming p to a locally trivial bundle map?
An h-block bundle map p′: M →B is such that there is a space F and for
each simplex σ of B, a homotopy equivalence hσ: p′−1(σ) →σ × F such that
for each face τ of σ, hσ | p′−1(τ): p′−1(τ) →τ × F is a homotopy equiva-
lence. In Chapman and Ferry [1983], examples are given over S2 of ap-
proximate ﬁbrations that are homotopic to bundle projections, yet cannot
be approximated by them. In Hughes [1983], Hughes shows that approx-
imate ﬁbrations may be approximated by bundle maps if and only if they
are homotopic to bundle maps through approximate ﬁbrations. In Hughes
et al [19∞a], Hughes, Taylor and Williams give a classiﬁcation of manifold
approximate ﬁbrations over a ﬁnite-dimensional manifold and show that the
problem of approximation by bundle maps may be viewed as a lifting prob-
lem, hence is obstructed by certain cohomology classes in the base. In more
recent work, they have identiﬁed the obstructions to approximation by block

is a ﬁnite-dimensional polyhedron, and A is ﬁnite dimensional, then A may
be embedded ﬁber-wise in B × Sn so that its complement is a ﬁbration, i.e.,

denotes the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of M. Wong [1988] has proved
that Cz(M × [0, 1)) = cat(M). Singhof [1979] has proved cat(L × S1) =
cat(L) + 1 in the case that L is a closed manifold. This is a reformulation of
a problem of Ganea [1971].
7. GA: Group Actions
7.1. Introduction
In this section, the terminology “G-” will mean either “equivariant” or “in
the category of spaces with actions of G and equivariant maps”.
The single most fundamental transformation group problem involving (pos-
sibly) inﬁnite dimensional spaces is perhaps P. Smith’s generalization of Hil-
bert’s Fifth Problem, generally known as “The Hilbert-Smith Conjecture”..
It asks whether a locally compact topological group acting eﬀectively on an
n-manifold must be a Lie group. The connection with inﬁnite dimensions is
that the problem is reduced in Montgomery and Zippin [1955] to whether
there is an eﬀective action of the p-adic integers
Ap = lim
←(Zp ←Zp2 ←. . .)
on an n-manifold M n, and that if there is, then the homological dimension of
the orbit space M n/Ap = n + 2, whence
ind(M n/Ap) = n + 2 or ∞
(Yang [1960], Bredon et al [1961]). (As of this moment, it is not clear
whether the Hilbert-Smith Conjecture is open: there is a new paper recently
circulated by L. McAuley claiming to contain a proof, but it has not as of this
writing been veriﬁed; anyone interested in this question should consult that
manuscript, if not McAuley.)

§7]
GA: Group Actions
553
There has been relatively little progress as of this writing on the group
actions problems posed in the 1979 Problem List Geoghegan [1979]. Its ex-
position is suﬃciently good that it needs no updating, except to note that
the papers of Vo Thanh Liem discussed have now appeared Vo Thanh
Liem [1979, 1981, 1983]. The progress that has been made is due to him.
The interested reader should consult Geoghegan [1979] and these papers.
The primary focus there was on actions on Q that are free oﬀa single ﬁxed
point, called “based-free” actions. This focus derived from the idea that these
should be the simplest after the free actions on Q-manifolds and ought to be
relatively easy to classify. After twenty years of inconclusive work using ele-
mentary methods, it appears that this is not the case, but that the based-free
actions form instead another location in the theory of Q-manifolds and inﬁ-
nite dimensional topology where serious input from stable homotopy theory is
needed before the most basic questions such as the Anderson Conjecture are
settled. (This was the case in Taylor’s example as well as in Draniˇsnikov’s.)
The topic of group actions on Q-manifolds has been developed in another
direction, which has proven to be much more manageable as well as fruitful
for applications to the ﬁnite-dimensional context. M. Steinberger and J. West
have investigated a class of actions which are universal for equivariant topol-
ogy in the same way that Q is universal for separable metric spaces. For a
ﬁnite group G, let QG = 
i>0 Di, where Di is the unit disc of the regular real
representation V = R[G] = {
g∈G rgg | rg ∈R}, with h ·  rgg =  rg · hg.
QG is a Hilbert cube that contains every irreducible real representation of
G inﬁnitely many times.
It is an absolute retract for G-spaces and every
separable metric G-space embeds in it equivariantly. It is also equivariantly
homogeneous, and it is reasonable to consider manifolds that are locally home-
omorphic with QG, i.e., QG-manifolds. This hypothesizes that the actions are
locally linear and thus cannot exhibit the local diﬃculties that have made the
based-free case so diﬃcult.
Steinberger and West have established for QG-manifolds all the basic theo-
rems of inequivariant Q-manifold theory that do not rely upon the vanishing
of algebraic K-theoretic invariants (Steiberger and West [1986, 19∞b,
1985]). The point of this discussion is to motivate an extension of this the-
ory to Lie groups. For compact Lie groups, G, there is a good model for a
universal linear action on a Hilbert cube, QG. In particular, if G is compact
and Lie, then let QG = 
i>0,ρ Dρ,i be the product of the unit balls of all the
irreducible orthogonal representations of G, each representation disc being
represented inﬁnitely often. Let G act on QG by simultaneous action on all
the factors. Some questions about this action appear below.
A major development in the interface between topology and group theory is
the area beginning to be called “Geometric Methods in Group Theory”. The
idea is to understand the structure of groups by use of spaces upon which
they act. An example is group cohomology—introduced as the cohomology of

554
West / Infinite Dimensional Topology
[ch. 30
an Eilenberg-MacLane space K(G, 1) = E/G where E is a contractible space
on which G acts freely (see Brown [1982]). If G has torsion, then it is known
that dim(E) = ∞. Another is Tits’ “buildings” (Brown [1989]). See also
Serre [1980], Gromov [1987]. Many questions about precisely the topolog-
ical and combinatorial properties of the simplest spaces E for a given class
of groups are of interest to a wide audience. This is an attractive area cur-
rently undergoing explosive growth that should interact strongly with inﬁnite-
dimensional topology. (GA11) is an example of questions in this area, as is
(GA29). So is (HS23).
7.2. Progress on Problems of Section GA
GA 1 (79GA1) (Anderson) Let h: Q →Q be a based-free involution. Must
? 930.
h be topologically conjugate with the linear action “−1”?
(Here, Q = 
i>0[−1, 1]i.)
Open. This holds for h if and only if the ﬁxed point has a basis of contractible
invariant neighborhoods (Wong [1974]) or, equivalently, the space of free
orbits is movable at inﬁnity (Berstein and West [1978]), or the full orbit
space is dominated by a CW-complex, which is equivalent to its being an AR
(West and Wong [1979]). This is ensured if the action factors as a product
of ﬁnite-dimensional actions (Berstein and West [1978].)

of principal Z2 bundles of CW complexes and bundle maps, each the identity
on S∞, such that if fi−1: (Bi, RP ∞) →(Bi−1, RP ∞), is the map of base pairs
covered by ˜fi then (i) each (Bi, RP ∞) is relatively ﬁnite, (ii) each (Bi, RP ∞)
is relatively 1-connected, (iii) each ˜fi is null homotopic, and (iv) each ﬁnite
composition of fi’s is essential (as maps of pairs)?
Open. This is equivalent to (GA1) above (Berstein and West [1978]).
GA 4 (79GA4) Let the compact Lie group G act semifreely on Q in two ways

such that their ﬁxed point sets are identical. If the orbit spaces are ANR’s,

Open. HG(Q) denotes the equivariant homeomorphisms of Q. Vo Thanh

diﬀerence between these questions?)
Open. Vo Thanh Liem [1979] has shown that for free actions of ﬁnite groups,
this is always possible.
GA 7 (79GA8) Let α be a semi-free action of a ﬁnite group G on Q with 936. ?
ﬁxed point set F a Hilbert cube Z-set. When is α equivalent with the product
σ × idF , where σ is the standard action of G on Q? What if F = In?
Open. Vo Thanh Liem [1981] has shown that if α is conjugate to a ﬁber-
preserving action over In of Q × In and if for each t ∈In, α |Q×t is standard,
then the answer is “Yes” in the second case. In general, he has proved that
for a ﬁnite group G acting on a Q-manifold M, if the ﬁxed point sets M H of
the subgroups of G are locally ﬂat Hilbert cube submanifolds of M, then the
orbit space M/G is a Q-manifold (Vo Thanh Liem [1981]).

imal provided that every orbit is dense. C. Read has recently constructed
a bounded linear operator on l1 such that the orbit of every point but 0 is
dense. (cf. Beauzamy [1988], pp. 75ﬀ, 345, 358.)

GA 10 Does every compact connected Q-manifold with zero Euler charac-

teristic admit a minimal homeomorphism? Does it admit a minimal ﬂow?
The Euler characteristic zero hypothesis is necessary, as otherwise ﬁxed point
theory shows there is a ﬁxed point. Glasner and Weiss [1979] have shown
that S1 × Q admits a minimal homeomorphism.
GA 11 Let G be the group of PL homeomorphisms of the unit interval with
? 940.
singularities in Z[1/6] and slopes in the multiplicative group generated by 2/3.
Is G ﬁnitely generated?
Discussion: Brown and Geoghegan [1984] discovered the ﬁrst interesting
example of an inﬁnite dimensional discrete group G with the ﬁniteness prop-
erty F∞. This means that there is a K(G, 1) complex with only ﬁnitely many
cells in each dimension. (It is the same group that Dydak showed was a univer-
sal detector of “non-splittable” homotopy idempotents on π1 (Dydak [1977]),
and the demonstration of the inﬁnite dimensionality of the K(π, 1) of which by
Hastings and Heller [1982] showed that “non-splittable” homotopy idem-
potents occur only on inﬁnite dimensional spaces, so that compact FANR’s
are pointed FANR’s.) The intuition of Brown and Geoghegan was that this
group should be the ﬁrst example in a theory of “inﬁnite dimensional arith-
metic groups”. This intuition was reinforced when Brown later constructed
three inﬁnite families of inﬁnite dimensional F∞groups, with the original G as
the ﬁrst member of one of these families (Brown [1987]). All of the groups in
these families can be viewed as “arithmetically deﬁned” PL homeomorphism
groups of an interval, a circle, or a Cantor set, and the results obtained about
them were obtained by using a suitable notion of “triangulation” to construct
contractible complexes on which the groups act.
The long-term goal is to develop a general theory of inﬁnite dimensional
arithmetic groups analogous to the Borel-Serre theory for ordinary arithmetic
groups.
The ﬁrst step, however, is to understand some slight variants of
Brown’s three families, where one knows practically nothing. There are many
questions one could ask about the groups, but the above is a concrete one
which illustrates how little is currently known.
The problem in trying to
answer such a simple-looking question is that one does not know how to
construct a useful complex on which a PL homeomorphism group like G acts,
except in the special case where the group of allowable slopes is generated
by integers. For an analysis of the ﬁnite-piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of
the line, see Brin and Squier [1985] (cf. Brown and Geoghegan [1984],
Brown [1987], Bieri and Strebel [19∞], Ghys and Sergiescu [1987],
Greenberg [1987], Stein [19∞]).
If G is compact and Lie, then let QG = 
i>0,ρ Dρ,i be the product of the
unit balls of all the irreducible real representations of G, each representation

disc being represented inﬁnitely often. (By the Peter-Weyl theorem, the irre-
ducible representations of compact Lie groups are all ﬁnite dimensional and
may be assumed to be into the orthogonal groups, O(n), cf. Montgomery
and Zippin [1955], and are countable.) Let G act on QG by simultaneous
action on all the factors.
GA 12 Does the basic Q-manifold theory as expounded in Chapman [1976] 941. ?
extend to QG manifolds? In particular, is there a QG-manifold version of
the material of Chapters I-IV of Chapman [1976] (Approximation of map-
pings by equivariant embedding, Equivariant Z-set Unknotting, Equivariant
Stability)?
In the case that G is ﬁnite, Steinberger and West have established for QG-
manifolds all the basic theorems of inequivariant Q-manifold theory that do
not rely upon the vanishing of algebraic K-theoretic invariants (Steinberger
and West [1986, 19∞b, 1985]).
In particular, every theorem in Chap-
man [1976] prior to Corollary (29.5) is true in this setting.
Additionally,
if X is a locally compact metric G-ANR, then X × QG is a QG-manifold,
using QG yields a Toru´nczyk-style Characterization of QG-manifolds, and the
group of equivariant homeomorphisms of a compact QG-manifold is a G-ANR.
However, Equivariant Handle Straightening, Equivariant Triangulation, and
Topological Invariance of Equivariant Whitehad Torsion (deﬁned using stable
matrix algebra or equivariant simplicial moves) are false. Although compact
QG-manifolds are equivariantly dominated by ﬁnite G-CW complexes (here G
must act by cell-permutation), they may fail to have the equivariant homotopy
types of ﬁnite G-CW-complexes Quinn [1979, 1982a, 1982b], Steinberger
and West [1986, 1985]. Moreover, although not equivariantly triangulable,
all compact QG-manifolds are equivariantly homeomorphic with manifolds of
the form M n × QG, where M n carries a locally linearizeable action of G.
They have been able to apply this theory to aid the analysis of the locally
linearizable G actions on n-manifolds (Steinberger and West [1986, 1985,
19∞b, 1987a, 1987b, 19∞a, 1988, 1989]), where it serves to provide a stable
equivariant Whitehead group for locally linear G-actions that may not ad-
mit equivariant handle decomposition, a topological equivariant s-cobordism
theorem, and a complete obstruction to equivariant handle decomposition
for those manifolds with no codimension 2 incidences of ﬁxed point sets of
diﬀerent subgroups and no low-dimensional ﬁxed point sets.

A mapping cylinder neighborhood is a neighborhood N that is a compact QG-
manifold with equivariantly bicollared (in M) boundary L also a QG manifold
and such that N is the mapping cylinder of a map from L to X. The issue of
splitting by a non locally linear co-dimension one submanifold has come up
in the ﬁnite-dimensional case for G ﬁnite, but is likely irrelevant here, as it is
expected that a “Toru´nczyk Criterion” will be available.

each closed subgroup H of G at least 6-dimensional and none of them of codi-

∅(M) is a Hilbert manifold for all compact Hilbert

monds showed AG
∅(M) is locally contractible when M is a ﬁnite dimensional

discrete group acting freely and properly discontinuously on X. Under what
conditions is the action of G linearizeable, i.e., topologically conjugate with
the restriction to some locally compact, convex subset C of ℓ2 of a subgroup
of Gl(C)?
In the above, the orbit space X/G will be an Eilenberg-MacLane space of
type K(G, 1) and a Q-manifold. For a given group, they will all be homotopy

560

[ch. 30
equivalent. Thus, they will be homeomorphic if simple homotopy equivalent
(inﬁnite simple homotopy equivalent if not compact). A homeomorphism be-
tween the orbit spaces will lift to an equivariant homeomorphism, and an
equivariant homeomorphism will generate a homeomorphism of orbit spaces.
A complication can occur at the ends of X. Are shape theoretic invariants
at the ends suﬃcient to classify these actions? Do stable homotopy consider-
ations enter? If G is ﬁnitely generated free abelian, and if X/G is compact,
then X/G is homeomorphic with T k × Q, as all homotopy equivalences are
simple in this case and are thus homotopic to homeomorphisms.
Note that the based-free question above is contained in this problem, for
one may take a convex Hilbert cube and delete an extreme point, leaving a
locally compact convex set.
These questions can obviously be formulated for Lie groups as well.
GA 27 For a given ﬁnite or discrete group G classify the free properly dis-
? 956.
continuous actions of G on contractible Q-manifolds.
This is much more general than the convex Q-manifold problem above be-
cause of complications at the ends in the manifolds. For example, note the
implications of M. Davis’ examples of compact n-manifolds with contractible
universal cover not homeomorphic with Rn (Davis [1983]).
It is quite certain that in this Q-manifold setting there are questions that
are not algebraically obstructed and that can be answered directly using the
elementary but powerful techniques, such as controlled engulﬁng, that are
available. In the past decade, there has begun to be a ﬂow of information
from the topological theory of manifolds to the algebraic K-theory achiev-
able, in retrospect, by Q-manifold methods. Many of these results amount to
“vanishing” theorems in the algebraic K-theory and are of considerable im-
portance. Ferry [1977b], Farrell and Hsiang [1981, 1983], Farrell and
Jones [1986a, 1986b, 1988a, 1988b, 19∞], Quinn [1979, 1982a, 1982b, 1985].
There are several other questions concerning group actions on Q-manifolds
here and there.
See, e.g., the section on inﬁnite dimensional manifolds in
nature.
GA 28 Let G be a ﬁnitely presented group. Is G semistable at ∞?
? 957.
Semistability at inﬁnity of a ﬁnitely presented group is a topological property
of the universal covers ˜X of the ﬁnite cell complexes X with π1(X) = G:
X is semistable at ∞provided that each two proper maps r, s : [0, 1) →˜X
converging to the same end of ˜X are properly homotopic. Note that this is
a shape-theoretic property of the ends. Mihalik has made an extensive study
of this property Mihalik [1983, 1985, 1986, 1986, 1987, 19∞], which forces
H2(G, Z[G]) to be free abelian (Geoghegan and Mihalik [1985]). He has
shown that 0-ended and 2-ended groups are semistable at ∞, and has reduced

the general case to 1-ended groups (Mihalik [19∞]). G is said to be simply
connected at inﬁnity provided that for each compact set C of ˜X there is a
larger one K such that loops in ˜X −K are null homotopic in ˜X −C. This
forces H2(G, Z[G]) to vanish. See Geoghegan and Mihalik [1985] for this
and further explanation of the relation between the shape theory of the ends
of ˜X and the cohomology of G.
8. HS: Spaces of Automorphisms and Mappings
8.1. Introduction
There has been a signiﬁcant amount of work on this topic over the past decade,
but the most fundamental problem, determining whether or when the homeo-
morphism group H(M n) of a compact n-manifold M n, n > 2, when equipped
with the compact-open topology, is an ANR, and hence a Hilbert manifold,
is untouched. Chapter X of Geoghegan [1979] is devoted to this problem
and contains an excellent discussion of several reductions to simpler ones.
That discussion will not be repeated below. As a point of information, it
is known that when M is compact and PL, the subgroup HPL(M n) is a σ-
manifold (Keesling and Wilson [1975], Geoghegan and Haver [1976]).
Also, for n = 1, 2, H(M n) is known to be a Hilbert manifold (Luke and
Mason [1972]).
There have been interesting developments in at least two directions: mea-
sure preserving transformations, by Nguyen To Nhu, J. Oxtoby, and V. Prasad,
and uniform and Lipschitz isomorphisms, by K. Sakai and R. Wong.
8.2. Progress on Problems of Section HS
HS 1 (79HS1-3) Let M n be a compact n-manifold.
Is H(M n) a Hilbert 958. ?
manifold?
Open. The answer is “Yes”, for n = 1 (R. Anderson, R. Bing) and for n = 2,
Luke and Mason [1972]. The discussion in Geoghegan [1979] shows that
this is equivalent to showing that H(M n) is an ANR, or that H∂(M n) is
an ANR, where H∂(M n) is the homeomorphisms that are stationary on the
boundary.
HS 2 (79HS4) Is every open set in H∂(Bn) dominated by a CW-complex?
959. ?
Open. Geoghegan [1979] indicates how this implies H(M n) is a Hilbert
manifold.
It is known that if M n is a PL manifold, then in the identity
component Ho(M n) of H(M n), the PL-homeomorphisms are dense and even
form an fd-cap set (Geoghegan and Haver [1976]). They are also known
to be an ANR and even a manifold modeled on the linear span σ in ℓ2 of an

562
West / Infinite Dimensional Topology
[ch. 30
orthonormal basis (Keesling and Wilson [1975]). The fd-cap property is
deﬁned after HS18 and ensures that for each open set U of Ho(M n), the inclu-
sion U ∩PLo(M m) →U is an isomorphism on πn for each n. It follows that
in order to settle (HS1) it is suﬃcient to demonstrate Kozlowski’s haziness,
which is the strong local homotopy negligibility. (See the discussion around
(ANR4).)
HS 3 (79HS5) Let M be a compact n-manifold. Let H(M) denote the closure
? 960.
of H(M n) in the space of continuous self-maps of M in the uniform conver-
gence topology. Is there a (continuous) map H(M) →H(M) arbitrarily close
to the identity map of H(M) with image in H(M n)?
Open.
HS 4 (79HS6) Is H(M) an ANR?
? 961.
Open. If H(M) is an ANR then it is a Hilbert manifold, since it is ℓ2-stable
according to Toru´nczyk and to Geoghegan [1972, 1973]. Haver has shown
that H(M) −H(M n) is a countable union of Z-sets, so that if H(M) is an
ANR, so is H(M).
8.3. More Problems on Mapping Spaces
HS 5 Let M be a compact Q-manifold and as in (HS3) let H(M) denote the
? 962.
uniform closure of its homeomorphism group. Is H(M) a Hilbert manifold?
This is open even for M = Q.
HS 6 Let M n be a compact n-manifold.
Let R(M) denote the space of

retractions of M (compact-open topology) and let Ro = R(M) −idM. Is
R(M) an ANR? If ∂M = ∅, is Ro(M) a Hilbert manifold? If ∂M ̸= ∅is
R(M) a Hilbert manifold?
The answer is yes for n = 1, 2, ∞, by work of Basmanov and Savchenko, Cauty,
and Chapman and Sakai, respectively (Basmanov and Savchenko [1987],
Cauty [1986], Chapman [1977b], Sakai [1981a], cf. Nhu et al [19∞]).
HS 7 Is R(M) −idM locally homeomorphic with H(M)?
? 964.
Let X be a non-discrete metric compactum and Y a separable metric space
without isolated points. Let C(X, Y ) be the space of maps from X to Y with
the sup metric, and let LIP(X, Y ) ⊂C(X, Y ) be the Lipschitz maps. Let
k-LIP(X, Y ) = {f ∈LIP(X, Y ) | lip(f) ≤k},

§8]
HS: Spaces of Automorphisms and Mappings

where lip(f) is the Lipschitz constant. Let PL(X, Y ) denote the PL maps,
and let HLIP(X) be the Lipschitz homeomorphisms (both h and h−1 being
required to be Lipschitz).
HS 8 If Y is not a smooth manifold, can one put a smooth structure on 965. ?
C(X, Y ) in a “natural” way?
If Y is a topologically complete ANR, then C(X, Y ) is a Hilbert manifold
(Geoghegan [1972, 1973]). Henderson [1969] showed each Hilbert mani-
fold embeds in Hilbert space and admits a smooth structure. Kuiper and
Burghelea [1969] showed that homotopy equivalent smooth Hilbert mani-
folds are diﬀeomorphic, so the structure is unique.
Let Q∞= lim→(Q = Q × 0 →Q × Q = Q × Q × 0 →. . .). Re-equipped
with the bounded-weak* topology (direct limit of radius n balls, each with
the (analysts’) weak* topology), ℓ2 becomes homeomorphic with Q∞.
HS 9 Can a topology be induced “naturally” on C(X, Y ) to get a Q∞- 966. ?
manifold?
If X and Y are polyhedra, then PL(X, Y ) is a σ-manifold (Keesling and
Wilson [1975]). Let R∞= lim→(R →R2 →. . .). Then R∞and σ may be
regarded as topologies on the same set.
HS 10 Is there a natural way to topologize PL(X, Y ) as an R∞-manifold?
967. ?
HS 11 Under what conditions is LIP(X, Y ) a Σ-manifold? Does it suﬃce 968. ?
for Y to be a locally compact ALNE (= absolute neighborhood extensor for
the class of metric spaces and locally Lipschitz maps)?
Suﬃcient is that Y be a locally compact locally convex set in a normed linear
space, an Euclidean polyhedron, or a Lipschitz manifold. Cf. Sakai [19∞a],
Sakai and Wong [1989a].
HS 12 Under what conditions is k-LIP(X, Y ) a Q-manifold?
969. ?
Suﬃcient is that Y be an open subset of a locally compact convex set in a
normed linear space (Sakai and Wong [1989a]).

564
West / Infinite Dimensional Topology
[ch. 30
an (ℓ2, Σ, σ)-manifold triple?
Yes, if Y is open in Euclidean space Sakai [19∞b]. A manifold triple im-
plies charts that preserve the containment and simultaneously provide charts
for each object, e.g., if N is a locally ﬂat codimension 3 submanifold of
M n, then (M, N) is a (Rn, Rn−3)-manifold pair. (C(X, Y ), LIP(X, Y )) and
(C(X, Y ), PL(X, Y )) are known to be (ℓ2, Σ)- and (ℓ2, σ)-manifold pairs (Sak-
ai [19∞a], Geoghegan [1973]).
HS 14 If X is a Lipschitz n-manifold, is HLIP(X) a Σ-manifold?
? 971.
Yes, if X is an Euclidean polyhedron of dimension ≤2; (H(X), HLIP (X)) is
then an (ℓ2, Σ)-manifold pair Sakai and Wong [1989b].
HS 15 If X is a Q-manifold, what metric conditions on X guarantee that

Z-set unknotting may be achieved in Q by members of Hλ(Q), but not with
control. Prasad [1979] has shown that Hλ(In) is a dense Gδ in H(In). Nhu
has shown that the space of all measure preserving bijections of Lebesque

if t ≥1, while q(t) is analogously deﬁned using 1 and 2 as the singularities,
again with slope 2 between them. Is F amenable?

566
West / Infinite Dimensional Topology
[ch. 30
A discrete group is amenable provided that it admits a translation invari-
ant mean, i.e., averaging functional on the set of bounded measurable real
valued functions. (A geometric heuristic deﬁnition good for subgroups G of
Lie groups is that the ratio of the number of points of G near the surfaces
of balls to those in the interiors in the Lie group goes to zero “suﬃciently
rapidly” as diameter goes to inﬁnity to allow an integral to “work”.)
F
is the “Thompson-Minc” group. See Brin and Squier [1985] (cf. Hast-
ings and Heller [1982], Dydak [1977], Brown and Geoghegan [1984],
Brown [1987, 19∞]), where it is shown that the entire group of PL home-
omorphisms of R1 with ﬁnitely many singularities contains no free subgroup
of rank 2 and a complete presentation is given. A negative answer would give
a ﬁnitely presented counter example to a conjecture of von Neumann.
9. LS: Linear Spaces
9.1. Introduction
There has been a lot of movement in this branch of inﬁnite dimensional topol-
ogy. The locally convex, complete, metrizable vector spaces were character-
ized topologically by Toru´nczyk [1981], which was available when Geoghe-
gan [1979] was prepared. Since then, the focus has been on the classiﬁcation
of incomplete subspaces of Fr´echet spaces and the study of the topology of
the non locally convex vector spaces. Despite many advances, the topology
of these spaces retains its mystery. The basic reference is still Bessaga and
Pelczy´nski [1975]. The separate chapter in the present book by Dobrowolski
and Mogilski should be consulted on this topic for the authoritative discussion
on incomplete spaces.
Some terminology is as follows: a linear space is a topological vector space,
a real vector space with a topology under which addition and scalar multi-
plication is continuous. A linear metric space has topology determined by
a metric, and will always have translation invariant metrics.
If there is a
complete metric, then there are complete translation invariant ones; complete
linear metric spaces are called F-spaces.

˜X = {λ: X −0 →R | ρ(λ, 0) ≡

Assume without loss of generality that for each x d(tx, 0) is strictly increasing
in t. ˜X is an F-space with invariant metric ρ. Let µ: ˜X →X by
µ(λ) =

λ(x)x.
Does µ admit a continuous cross section?
Open. The interest of this problem stems from the fact that ˜X is homeomor-
phic with a Hilbert space, so is an AR; existence of a cross section implies X
and the kernel of µ are AR’s.
LS 3 (79LS3) Is every inﬁnite dimensional F-space X homeomorphic with 983. ?
X × s? with X × Q? with X × R?
Open. Van Mill [1987] gave incomplete normed (hence not F-space) counter
examples to all three questions.
LS 4 (79LS4) Let X be an inﬁnite dimensional F-space. (a) Are compacta 984. ?

Open. Partial solutions: (a) Yes, if X has a strictly weaker linear Hausdorﬀ
topology (Dobrowolski and Riley). (b) Yes, for ﬁnite-dimensional compacta
(Dobrowolski [1989], cf. Borges [1987]). A set A in a space X is negligible
provided that X −A ≈X.
LS 5 (79LS5) Does every inﬁnite dimensional F-space X contain an fd-cap
set?
Yes, any Hamel basis. Rephrase by asking for cap sets. (If X is an AR, then
Mazur’s Lemma implies “Yes”.)
LS 6 (79LS6) Let K be a convex subset of an F-space X. Is K an AR? If K 985. ?

AR, it is not known for p ϵ (0, 1) whether linear subspaces of Lp are AR’s,
much less convex compacta (see comment to LS7).

11.1. Introduction
The characterization of Q-manifolds and ℓ2-manifolds by Tor´unczyk [1980,
1981] has been followed up throughout the decade.
Much work has been
done on obtaining analogous characterizations of manifolds modeled on the
incomplete linear metric spaces. In general, see the article by Dobrowolski
and Mogilski in this volume.
The most pressing need is for a simple and useful topological characteri-
zation of ANR’s (more precisely, Absolute Neighborhood Extensors for the
class of metric spaces) among the metric spaces of inﬁnite dimension. In the
ﬁnite dimensional spaces, we have Kuratowski’s theorem that the ANR’s coin-
cide with the locally contractible spaces, which was extended to the countable
unions of ﬁnite dimensional compacta by Geoghegan and Haver [1976] and
to metrizable spaces with Property C by Gresham [1980]. This fails even for

where each Xn is an AR and each fn is a CE map, is the inverse limit X

There is a simple characterization: It is not hard to see that X is an AR. Then
by Toru´nczyk’s Theorem (Toru´nczyk [1980]) one need only show that each
pair f, g: Q →X, of maps may be approximated by maps f ′, g′: Q →X with
disjoint images. For a given ϵ > 0, there would then have to be an integer
n(ϵ) such that the projections of f and g into Xi may be ϵ-approximated
by maps with disjoint images whenever i > n(ϵ). That this will also suﬃce
follows from the fact (Lacher [1977]) that CE maps between ANR’s admit
“ϵ cross sections” for all ϵ > 0. However, this condition may not be easy to
apply. Simpler criteria should be sought. To begin, is it suﬃcient to require
that all point inverses of an projections X →Xn be inﬁnite-dimensional?

always vanishes, then combined results of Cannon, Edwards, and Quinn show
that X is an n-manifold, n > 4, provided it is an ANR homology n-manifold
and has the DDP. A space X is a homology n-manifold if for each
x ∈X, Hi(X, X −x; Z) ∼= Hi(Rn, Rn −0; Z).
The last three are not inﬁnite-dimensional questions, but they are of inter-
est.
12. N: Inﬁnite Dimensional Spaces in Nature
12.1. Introduction
It bears repeating that the past vitality of the ﬁeld and its future strength
depend fundamentally on its connections with other branches of mathematics.
Historically, inﬁnite dimensional topology of the sort under consideration here
was motivated by founders of the ﬁeld of functional analysis (Fr´echet, Banach)
and developed strongly by functional analysts (Bessaga, Kadets, Pelczy´nski
and Klee with the aims of classifying vector spaces and convex sets (still a
major focus even after the tremendous advances of the past) and by Eells to
support Global Analysis.
The ﬁeld has gained strength from the initially unexpected connection of
Q-manifolds with ﬁnite dimensional manifolds unearthed by Chapman: the

§12]
N: Inﬁnite Dimensional Spaces in Nature
577
Whitehead group and other K-theoretic invariants fundamental to the anal-
ysis of homeomorphisms of n-manifolds survive intact upon stabilization by
Cartesian product with Q, and in most cases, the topological questions to
which they are important also survive.
In essence, the Q-manifolds form a simultaneous stabilization of the ﬁnite-
dimensional manifolds, the locally compact simplicial complexes, and the lo-
cally compact ANR’s, in which local complexities are stabilized away but
global aspects of the topology is retained by the local compactness with the re-
sult that the ﬁrst-order global homeomorphism theory of these spaces becomes
in the Q-manifolds virtually the same as the K-theory. The simpliﬁcation is
at times more subtle than might be expected. For example, Chapman [1980]
discovered and Hughes [1983, 1985] has exploited the fact that engulﬁng is
canonical in Hilbert cube manifolds (in the sense that one may do engulﬁng
continuously parameterized by a parameter in an arbitrary metric space). It is
this simpliﬁcation that has made it possible to prove several theorems of vital
import to ﬁnite dimensional manifolds and polyhedra in the setting of Hilbert
cube manifolds and even to fashion Q-manifolds into a tool for investigating
ﬁnite dimensional questions of this sort.
Some examples are the following:
• Chapman’s proof (Chapman [1974]) of the topological invariance of
Whitehead torsion for compact polyhedra (that homeomorphisms are
simple homotopy equivalences) ﬁrst stabilizes a homeomorphism and
then in the Q-manifold setting deforms it to something that is obviously
a stabilization of a simple homotopy equivalence.
• Compact ANR’s were shown to be homotopy equivalent with compact
polyhedra by demonstrating (West [1977]) that they may be embed-
ded in Q-manifolds with mapping cylinder neighborhoods, which, being
compact Q-manifolds, are homotopy equivalent to compact ANR’s by
work of Chapman.
• the proof that homeomorphism groups of compact Q-manifolds are ANR
’s (independently by Ferry [1977b] and Toru´nczyk [1977]) provided
the ﬁrst widely applicable topological condition (beyond being a homeo-
morphism) guaranteeing that certain homotopy equivalences were sim-
ple.
This was explicitly shown by Ferry [1977b] to imply that ho-
motopy equivalences between ﬁnite CW-complexes are simple provided
they are controlled homotopy equivalences with suﬃciently ﬁne con-
trol in the target. This should perhaps be considered as the theorem
that really began the burgeoning ﬁeld now known as “controlled topol-
ogy”. It and the ensuing work by Chapman and Ferry directly motivated
Quinn [1979, 1982a, 1982b] to prove the Connell-Hollingsworth Conjec-
tures (Connell and Hollingsworth [1969]). It was also picked up
immediately by Farrell and Hsiang [1981] to prove the vanishing of

578
West / Infinite Dimensional Topology
[ch. 30
the Whitehead group and reduced projective class group of the inte-
gral group ring of any discrete torsion-free subgroup of the isometries
of Euclidean n-space that has odd- order holonomy. To my knowledge,
this was the ﬁrst time that manifold techniques were applied to obtain
computations in algebraic K-theory, an enterprise that is now a big
business.
The working out of these ideas is currently one of the principal currents in
inﬁnite dimensional topology.
Function spaces have received a certain amount of attention, but they
should receive much more; it is here that inﬁnite dimensional manifolds natu-
rally arise, unavoidably, and with the most importance in mathematics. How-
ever, except for the ANR property of homeomorphism groups of compact
manifolds, there has been little contact with other areas of mathematics. The
general lack of interaction with other branches of mathematics in this area is
no doubt one of the reasons for its relative neglect. It needs an infusion of
new ideas and problems.
There was a promising movement in Hilbert manifolds in the late 1960’s,
but that was abandoned when D. Henderson showed they all embed as open
subsets of the model space and that homotopy equivalences are always homo-
topic to homeomorphisms (Henderson [1969]). A problem of P. A. Smith
concerning linearization of Zp actions on S3 is formulated as a ﬁxed point
problem on a Hilbert manifold and is included as (N5) to suggest a new di-
rection.
Several papers have pointed out mapping space ideas of promise in the
function spaces department that should be followed up:
• Geoghegan [1976] followed by Jones [1976] and Colvin [1985] have
examined spaces of mappings into ﬂat and hyperbolic manifolds and
found that several mapping space constructions lead through natural
restrictions to spaces of maps that have compact Q-manifold closures
in other spaces.
(Examples are maps f into Riemannian manifolds
of nowhere positive sectional curvature that have k-th derivative of
bounded norm or bounded “energy” .)
• Sakai [19∞a], Sakai and Wong [1989a, 1989b, 19∞] have been devel-
oping a theory of Lipschitz homeomorphisms and mappings of manifolds
with an eye to proving that they ﬁt in between the piecewise linear maps
and the continuous ones and that charts may be had for, say, the homeo-
morphism spaces that are modelled on various pairs and triples of vector
spaces with the sub-elements of the pairs and triples being incomplete
subspaces of Hilbert spaces.
• Sakai and Wong in the above series also develop the idea of a stabilized
ﬁnite dimensional homeomorphism of a Q-manifold and investigate the

§12]
N: Inﬁnite Dimensional Spaces in Nature
579
role these play in the above setting. These papers produce new and nat-
ural manifolds of maps modelled on various incomplete linear subspaces
of Hilbert space.
• J. Oxtoby and V. Prasad (Oxtoby and Prasad [1978], Prasad [1979])
have done foundational work on spaces of measures on Q or In.
• Fedorˇcuk [1986, 1982], Nguyen To Nhu [19∞] and Nguyen To
Nhu and Ta Khac Cu [19∞] have studied spaces of measures on ANR’s
and spaces of measure preserving transformations.
Hyperspaces is another point of contact. There has been a certain amount
of work done by Curtis, Sakai, Nhu, and Heisey and West, as well as many
others. This has been mostly of a follow up nature to theorems of the 1970’s.
It appears, however, that there are opportunities in new directions generated
by work in diﬀerential geometry by Gromov [1979, 1981, 1983, 1986, 1987]
Grove [1987] and currently being exploited by Grove and Peterson [1988].
Of particular interest for inﬁnite dimensional topologists is the use of the hy-
perspace of metric compacta (isometry classes) with a metric that combines
the Hausdorﬀmetric and the natural Lipschitz metric when the spaces are
Lipschitz equivalent. In this space, the subspaces comprised of Riemannian
manifolds with curvature and diameter bounds are of interest to the diﬀeren-
tial geometers and are shown under suitable hypotheses to form precompact
sets. This is used in proofs that within these bounds, the set of homotopy
types or even homeomorphism types of manifolds are ﬁnite. These spaces
and subspaces and their limits, completions, and compactiﬁcations should be
a fruitful ﬁeld for investigation.

non-void closed subsets with the Hausdorﬀmetric induced from a translation

structure of the orbit space 2G/G?
Open.
Toru´nczyk and West examined the case G = S1 in Toru´nczyk
and West [1978] and found that there is a wealth of Q-manifold Eilenberg-
MacLane spaces of type K(Z(P ), 2) in it for any subset P of primes, where
Z(P ) denotes the integers localized away from the primes in P. (The struc-
ture occurs as a direct system of Q-manifold K(Z, 2) = CP ∞= BS1’s ac-
cording to the lattice of inclusions of the closed subgroups of S1 in such a
way that the union of the manifolds in a particular subsystem is in fact a
Q-manifold and a K(Z(P ), 2).) For example, (2S1 −{S1})/G is a Q-manifold
Eilenberng-MacLane space with second homotopy group isomorphic with the
rational numbers. Heisey and West have extended this analysis to the case
G = S1 × S1 (Heisey and West [1988], Heisey and West [19∞]).
In
this context, it should be of interest to relate the topology of the hyperspace
of closed subgroups of a Lie group to the hyperspace of all closed subsets.
The closed subgroups have been found to exhibit interesting topology even
in the simple case of R2 (Hubbard and Pourezza [1979]), where knotting
phenomena are present.

S3. Let E be the space of all locally ﬂat unknotted simple closed curves in
S3. Let α∗denote the induced Zp-action on E. Must α∗have a ﬁxed point?
This is equivalent to a longstanding conjecture of P. Smith. If the answer
is “Yes”, then all free Zp actions on S3 are conjugate to linear ones. This
is true if p = 2 (Livesay [1960]).
Both the action and the simple closed
curves may be taken smooth, if desired, in which case a certain amount of
smooth machinery is available. E is an inﬁnite dimensional manifold homotopy
equivalent with the space of great circles on S3. The Lefshetz number of α∗
is non-zero, indicating a ﬁxed point, were the Lefschetz ﬁxed point theorem
valid in this situation. Is there an invariant compact ANR (e.g., Q-manifold
of simple closed curves) in E homotopy equivalent with E? (The Lefschetz
theorem applies to compact ANR’s.)

of the most promising possibilities in the ﬁeld of Q-manifolds at present. The
work of Farrell and Jones combines a great deal of n-manifold theory with the
dynamics and arrives at a situation where controlled h-cobordism theorems
are needed (and proved) to establish vanishing theorems for the K-theory. The
h-cobordism theorems are the moral equivalent of homeomorphism theorems
in Q-manifold theory. The connections and structures that exist in the Q-
manifolds of this nature should be understood.

By a space we mean a Tikhonov topological space. The main role in Cp-
theory is played by the topological ring Cp(X) formed by all continuous real-
valued functions on a space X in the topology of pointwise convergence. The
starting point is J. Nagata’s Theorem in Nagata [1949]: if the topological
rings Cp(X) and Cp(Y ) are topologically isomorphic then the spaces X and Y
are homeomorphic. This result leads to the following general questions. When
are Cp(X) and Cp(Y ) linearly homeomorphic as linear topological spaces?
When are Cp(X) and Cp(Y ) homeomorphic as topological spaces? We say
that X and Y are l-equivalent, and write X
l∼Y , if Cp(X) and Cp(Y ) are
linearly homeomorphic.
If Cp(X) and Cp(Y ) are just homeomorphic, we
write X
t∼Y and say that the spaces X and Y are t-equivalent. It is known
that l-equivalent spaces X and Y need not be homeomorphic: for example
the spaces I and I × {0, 1} (where I is the unit segment) are l-equivalent
and not homeomorphic. One can show that all uncountable zero-dimensional
metrizable compacta are l-equivalent (Baars and de Groot [1988]).
When are X and Y l-equivalent? t-equivalent? Which topological proper-
ties are preserved by l-equivalence? By t-equivalence? We call such properties
l-invariants and t-invariants . The Cp-theory is formed around questions of
this kind. This brings it in contact with many parts of general topology as
well as with topological theory of function spaces and with general theory of
linear topological spaces.
A major direction in Cp-theory is represented by duality theorems: here we
ﬁnd topological properties of X which can be characterized by topological or
by linear topological properties of Cp(X).
Another important general problem in Cp-theory is the following one. Given
a class P of topological spaces, characterize those topological spaces Y which
can be topologically embedded into Cp(X) for some X ∈P. Observe that the
compact spaces Y which can be topologically embedded into Cp(X) where X is
compact are exactly the Eberlein compacta (Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1984]). One
of the principal advantages of the topology of pointwise convergence is that
it provides us with a better supply of compact sets in C(X) than practically
any natural topology on C(X)—as this topology is the weakest one.
The reader is referred to the rather comprehensive surveys Arkhangel′ski˘ı
[1988b], [1987] and [1984] for more details and more discussions. See also van
Mill [1987b] and Baars, de Groot and van Mill [1986].
Below we use the following notations. By  we denote the free topological
sum; M ≃L means that M and L are linearly homeomorphic; N+ is the set
of all positive integers and N = N+ ∪{0}; by X, Y and Z we denote Tikhonov
spaces. We say that X and Y are u-equivalent, and write X
u∼Y , if Cp(X)
and Cp(Y ) are uniformly homeomorphic as uniform spaces (with respect to the
uniformity of pointwise convergence). By R we denote the linear topological
space of real numbers. For the deﬁnitions of tightness, Fr´echet-Urysohn prop-
erty, Souslin number and of other topological concepts see Engelking [1989].

[ch. 31
When X is compact then CB(X) is the Banach space C(X).
There are many good problems in Cp-theory; some of them, which I con-
sider very interesting, important, natural and probably diﬃcult to solve are
presented here—but of course this list is far from being complete. Good luck
to you if you are going to attack them!
Problem 1. Let X be an inﬁnite space. Is it true that Cp(X) × R is linearly
? 1026.
homeomorphic to Cp(X)? What if X is compact?
Problem 2. Is it true that the topological spaces Cp(X) × R and Cp(X) are
? 1027.
homeomorphic for any inﬁnite space X? What if X is compact?
Problems 1 and 2 may be reformulated as follows. Let X be an inﬁnite
topological space and let X+ be the space obtained by adding one new isolated
point to X. Are the spaces X and X+ l-equivalent? Is it true that X
t∼X+?
It is also quite natural to ask whether the spaces X and X+ are u-equivalent
for any inﬁnite space X.
One can show that the answer to problem 2 is “yes” if X contains a non-
trivial convergent sequence (see Gul′ko [1986]). Observe that Cp(X) can
always be represented in the form Cp(X) ≃M × R where M is some locally
convex linear topological space over R.
Observe that for every inﬁnite-dimensional Banach space B the space B×R
is homeomorphic to B by Kadetz’s Theorem and its generalizations. On the
other hand, it is still unknown whether B × R is linearly homeomorphic to B
for every inﬁnite-dimensional Banach space B (this is a well-known and quite
important open problem in the theory of Banach spaces).
The last question is related to Problem 1 in the following way. Let X be
compact and assume that Cp(X) × R is linearly homeomorphic to Cp(X).
Then the Banach spaces CB(X) × R and CB(X) are also linearly homeomor-
phic (see Pavlovski˘ı [1982] and Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1980]). It follows that a
positive answer to Problem 1 for compact X would imply a positive answer to
the following question on Banach spaces which is a special case of the question
on Banach spaces discussed above:
Problem 3. Let X be an inﬁnite compact space. Is it true that the Banach
? 1028.
spaces CB(X) and CB(X) × R are linearly homeomorphic?
(They are (topologically) homeomorphic.)
Observe that according to van Mill [1987a] there exists an inﬁnite-dimen-
sional normable linear topological space L such that L is not homeomorphic
to L × R.
Other general problems on Cp(X) of the same type as Problems 1 and 2
are the following ones. Find out when Cp(X) × Cp(X) is linearly homeomor-
phic to Cp(X). Find out under what restrictions on a topological space X

ch. 31]
Arkhangel′ski
/ Cp-theory

the topological space Cp(X) × Cp(X) is homeomorphic to the topological
space Cp(X). In other words, when is X  X
l∼X? When is X  X
t∼X?
Let T (ω1 + 1) be the space of all ordinal numbers not exceeding the ﬁrst
uncountable ordinal number ω1 with the usual topology. It was shown by
S. P. Gul′ko that Cp(T (ω1 + 1)) × Cp(T (ω1 + 1)) is not homeomorphic to
Cp(T (ω1 + 1)). Thus T (ω1 + 1)  T (ω1 + 1) is not t-equivalent to T (ω1 + 1).
Problem 4. Let X be an inﬁnite metrizable space. Is it true that Cp(X) is 1029. ?
linearly homeomorphic (is homeomorphic) to Cp(X) × Cp(X)? Is this true
for every compact metrizable space X?
Problem 5.
Is it true that for every space X the space Cp(X) × Cp(X) 1030. ?
can be represented as a continuous image of the space Cp(X)? What if X is
compact?
It was shown by Marciszewski [1983] that there exists a metrizable linear
topological space L which cannot be continuously mapped onto its square
L × L. In [19∞], Marciszewski has also constructed a compact space X
such that Cp(X) × Cp(X) is not homeomorphic to Cp(X).
Observe that R = Cp({0}) can be mapped continuously onto R × R =
Cp({0}) × Cp({0}) = Cp({0, 1}).
If the answer to Problem 5 is “yes” then the following will be true: if Cp(X)
is Lindel¨of then Cp(X) × Cp(X) is Lindel¨of. The last assertion is not proved
so far. Thus we have:
Problem 6. Let X be a space such that Cp(X) is Lindel¨of. Is it true that 1031. ?
the space Cp(X) × Cp(X) is Lindel¨of? What if X is compact ?
This is one of many questions of the following kind: assume that Cp(X)
has topological property P, does it follow then that Cp(X) × Cp(X) also has
property P? It is well known that many topological properties are not pro-
ductive in general; among such properties are normality, paracompactness,
Lindel¨ofness, countable tightness and many other properties. But the spaces
Cp(X) are always “regular” topological objects—ﬁrst, they are formed in a
standard way, and, second, these spaces are prevented from turning patholog-
ical by very strong algebraic barriers—by the natural ring algebraic structure
of Cp(X) which “sticks” to the topology of Cp(X). So that we may expect
that many topological properties may become productive for the spaces Cp(X)
or at least that they will be preserved by the square operation. For example
it was established in this direction that if the tightness of Cp(X) is count-
able then the tightness of Cp(X) × Cp(X) is countable, that if Cp(X) is a
Fr´echet-Urysohn space then Cp(X) × Cp(X) is a Fr´echet-Urysohn space (see
Pytkeev [1982a]).

Problem 7. Let X be a space such that Cp(X) is normal. Is it true that
? 1032.
Cp(X) × Cp(X) is normal? What if X is compact?
The Souslin number c(Cp(X)) of the space Cp(X) is always countable (as
Cp(X) is dense in RX—see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1982]). It follows that Cp(X) is
paracompact if and only if it is Lindel¨of. Thus we don’t have to formulate
“the square problem” for paracompact Cp(X)—it is equivalent to Problem 6.
H. H. Corson [1959] has shown that if Y is a dense subspace of the product
of any family of separable metrizable spaces and the space Y × Y is normal
then Y is collectionwise normal. Thus if the answer to Problem 7 is “yes”
this would imply that Cp(X) is collectionwise normal whenever it is normal.
Actually the last equivalence was shown to be true by E. A. Reznichenko (see
Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1987, 1989b]). But the following question remains open:
Problem 8. Let X be a zero-dimensional space, D = {0, 1} and assume that

the space Cp(X, D) is normal. Is it then true that Cp(X, D) is collectionwise
normal? What if X is compact?
Some positive results in this direction were obtained under special set-
theoretic assumptions (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1987, 1989b]).
The following problems may provide an approach to Problems 6 and 7.
Problem 9. Is it possible to represent the Sorgenfrey line (the “arrow space”)
? 1034.
as a closed subspace of Cp(X) where Cp(X) is Lindel¨of?
where Cp(X) is
normal?
If the answer to the last question is positive then Problem 6 would be
answered negatively. Observe that it is not possible to embed the Sorgenfrey
line into Cp(X) where X is compact. This depends on the following fact:
if X is compact then the closure of every countable subset A ⊆Cp(X) in
Cp(X) is a space with a countable network (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1976]).
Problem 9 is a particular case of the following general question.
Problem 10.
Is it possible to represent the Sorgenfrey line as a closed
? 1035.
subspace of some linear topological space which is Lindel¨of?
It is also unknown whether one can represent the Sorgenfrey line as a closed
subspace of a Lindel¨of topological group (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1981]).
There are several interesting open questions similar to Problems 9 and 10.
Problem 11.
Is it possible to represent every Lindel¨of space as a closed
? 1036.
subspace of a Lindel¨of linear topological space? of a Lindel¨of Cp(X)?
Problem 12. Is it possible to represent every paracompact space as a closed
? 1037.
subspace of a paracompact linear topological space?

Problem 13.
Is it possible to represent every normal space as a closed 1038. ?
subspace of a normal linear topological space?
In Problems 11, 12 and 13 we may restrict ourselves to locally convex linear
topological spaces over R.
In connection with Problem 13 observe that not every normal space ad-
mits a closed embedding into a normal space Cp(X). Indeed, according to
Reznichenko’s Theorem (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1989b]), if Cp(X) is normal
then Cp(X) is collectionwise normal. It follows that if X is a normal space
which is not collectionwise normal then X is not homeomorphic to a closed
subspace of Cp(X) where Cp(X) is normal. But the following question re-
mains open:
Problem 14. Let X be a collectionwise normal space. Is X homeomorphic 1039. ?
to a closed subspace of a collectionwise normal linear topological space (not
necessarily locally convex)?
Problem 15. Is it true that every space Y of countable tightness is home- 1040. ?
omorphic to a subspace (to a closed subspace) of Cp(X) where the tightness
of Cp(X) is countable?
The tightness of Cp(X) is countable if and only if Xn is Lindel¨of for each
n ∈N+ (Arkhangel′ski˘ı and Pytkeev [1982b]). Thus we can reformulate
Problem 15 in the following way. Let Y be a space of countable tightness. Is
it possible to ﬁnd a space X such that Xn is Lindel¨of for every n ∈N+ and
Y is homeomorphic to a subspace of Cp(X)? This reformulation suggests the
following version of Problem 15:
Problem 16. Is it true that every space Y of countable tightnessis homeo- 1041. ?
morphic to a subspace (to a closed subspace) of Cp(X) where X is Lindel¨of?
Problem 17. Is it true that every space Y of countable tightness is homeo- 1042. ?
morphic to a subspace (to a closed subspace) of a linear topological space of
countable tightness?
Observe that every countable space Y is homeomorphic to a closed subspace
of Cp(X), where Cp(X) has a countable network and hence is a space of
countable tightness. Indeed, one can take X to be Cp(Y )—then Cp(Y ) has
a countable base and Cp(Cp(Y )) has a countable network (Arkhangel′ski˘ı
[1976]).
Not every countable space can be realized as a subspace of Cp(X) where
X is compact (V. V. Uspenski˘ı, see Uspenski˘ı [1978] and Arkhangel′ski˘ı
[1989b]). The countable Fr´echet-Urysohn fan can serve as a counterexample
(Uspenski˘ı [1978]).

/ Cp-theory
[ch. 31
In connection with Problem 15 it should be mentioned that not every count-
able Fr´echet-Urysohn space can be topologically embedded into a Fr´echet-
Urysohn linear topological space. This follows from Nyikos [1981]: if G is a
Fr´echet-Urysohn topological group then G is a ⟨4 −FU⟩-space (i.e., G is a
strongly Fr´echet-Urysohn space, see Michael [1971] and Nyikos [1981]).
Problem 18. (N. V. Velichko) Let Cp(X) be a hereditarily Lindel¨of space.
? 1043.
Is it true that (Cp(X))n is hereditarily Lindel¨of for all n ∈N+?
P. Zenor [1980] and Velichko [1981] have independently shown that
(Cp(X))n is hereditarily Lindel¨of for all n ∈N+ if and only if Xn is heredi-
tarily separable for all n ∈N+. Thus we can reformulate Problem 18 in the
following way: is it true that if Cp(X) is hereditarily Lindel¨of then Xn is
hereditarily separable for all n ∈N+.
Let us recall that the spread of Y , denoted s(Y ), is the supremum of cardi-
nalities of discrete subspaces of Y . Very close to Problem 18 is the following
question:
Problem 19.
Let the spread of Cp(X) be countable. Is it true that the
? 1044.
spread of (Cp(X))n is countable for all n ∈N+?
It is known that s(Cp(X))n ≤ℵ0 for all n ∈N+ if and only if s(Xn) ≤ℵ0
for all n ∈N+ (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1989b]). Thus Problem 19 can be stated
in this form: let s(Cp(X)) ≤ℵ0; is it true that s(Xn) ≤ℵ0 for all n ∈N+ ?
If X is a zero-dimensional space then the answer to Problems 18 and 19
is positive (Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1989b]). Another case when Problems 18 and 19
get positive solutions is described by M. Asanov (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1989b]).
It is known that if hl(Cp(X) × Cp(X)) ≤ℵ0 then all Xn are hereditarily sep-
arable and that if s(Cp(X) × Cp(X)) ≤ℵ0 then s(Xn) ≤ℵ0 for all n ∈N+
(see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1989b, 1984]). Observe that Velichko has shown that
if Cp(X) is hereditarily separable then (Cp(X))n is hereditarily separable for
all n ∈N+ and Xn is hereditarily Lindel¨of for all n ∈N+ (Velichko [1981]).
Let SA denote the following assertion: every hereditarily separable space
is hereditarily Lindel¨of.
S. Todorˇcevi´c has shown in Todorˇcevi´c [1983]
that SA is consistent with the usual system ZFC of axioms of set theory.
Arkhangel′ski˘ı has proved that under SA the answer to Problems 18 and 19
is positive (Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1989a]) so that it is not possible to construct
counterexamples to Problems 18 and 19 in ZFC.
Problems 18 and 19 can also be formulated for higher cardinal numbers.
Problem 20. Let X and Y be t-equivalent spaces. Is it true that dim X =
? 1045.
dim Y ? What if X and Y are compact?
For a compact space X, dim X is the Lebesgue covering dimension of X.
If X is not compact we put dim X = dim βX, where βX is the ˇCech-Stone

compactiﬁcation of X. V. G. Pestov has shown that if X is l-equivalent to
Y then dim X = dim Y (Pestov [1982]). Another problem inspired by the
theorem of Pestov is the following one:
Problem 21.
Assume that Cp(X) can be mapped by a linear continuous 1046. ?
mapping onto Cp(Y ). Is it true that dim Y ≤dim X? What if X and Y are
compact?
Problem 22. Assume that Cp(X) can be mapped by an open linear contin- 1047. ?
uous mapping onto Cp(Y ). Is it true that dim Y ≤dim X? What if X and Y
are compact?
It can be shown that if X is a compact space which does not contain a
topological copy of the Tikhonov cube Iℵ1 then Cp(X) cannot be mapped by
a linear continuous mapping onto Cp(Iℵ1) (A. V. Arkhangel′ski˘ı).
The following question is obviously related to Problems 21 and 22.
Problem 23. Let Cp(Y ) be a linear topological factor (shortly: an l-factor) 1048. ?
of Cp(X)—i.e., Cp(X) ≃Cp(Y ) × M for some linear topological space M. Is
it true that dim Y ≤dim X?
For compact metrizable spaces this was shown to be true by A. N. Dran-
ishnikov [1986]. For all compact spaces this was proved by Arkhangel′ski˘ı
and Choban. For arbitrary Tikhonov spaces the question remains open.
Let us say that X and Y are weakly topologically equivalent (notation: X
w∼
Y ) if X is homeomorphic to a closed subspace of Y and Y is homeomorphic
to a closed subspace of X.
Problem 24. Is it true that weakly topologically equivalent metrizable spaces 1049. ?
are always l-equivalent? Is this true at least for compact metrizable spaces?
For non-metrizable compact spaces the answer to the last question is “no”.
Indeed let X = Iℵ1 and Y = Iℵ1  A where A is any compact subspace
of Iℵ1 the Souslin number of which is uncountable. Then X and Y are not
t-equivalent as the Souslin number is preserved by t-equivalence in the class
of compact spaces (Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1987]).
Problem 25. Is it true that every inﬁnite compact space is t-equivalent (l- 1050. ?
equivalent) to a compact space containing a non-trivial convergent sequence?
If the answer is “yes” then X+
t∼X (X+
l∼X) for every inﬁnite compact
space X. A related question is:

610
Arkhangel′ski
/ Cp-theory
[ch. 31
Problem 26. Is it true that every non-empty compact space is l-equivalent
? 1051.
(t-equivalent) to a compact space containing a point of countable character?
For a space X we put Cp,1(X) = Cp(X) and Cp,n+1(X) = Cp(Cp,n(X)).
Problem 27. (S. P. Gul′ko) Let X be a compact space such that all spaces
? 1052.
Cp,n(X), where n ∈N+ , are Lindel¨of. Is it true that X is a Corson com-
pactum?
Recall that Corson compacta are deﬁned to be compact subspaces of Σ-
products of unit segments (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1989b] and Gul′ko [1979]).
It is known (Sokolov [1986]) that if X is a Corson compactum, then Cp,n(X)
is Lindel¨of for all n ∈N+ . Gul′ko has shown that if X is a compact space
such that Cp(X) is a Lindel¨of Σ-space then X is a Corson compactum and
O. G. Okunev under the same restrictions on X and Cp(X) has shown that
all Cp,n(X) are Lindel¨of Σ-spaces (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1989b]).
Problem 28. Let X be a Lindel¨of space and let Y be a compact subspace
? 1053.
of Cp(X). Is it true that the tightness of Y is countable?
One can show that under the assumptions in Problem 28 the space Y cannot
be homeomorphic to the compactum T (ω1 + 1) (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı and
Uspenski˘ı [1986]).
It was shown by Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1988a] that under
additional set-theoretic assumptions (consistent with ZFC) the answer to the
last question is positive. Of course if Xn is Lindel¨of for all n ∈N+ then
the answer to Problem 28 is “yes”—in this case the tightness of the whole
space Cp(X) is countable (Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1976]).
It is not clear at all what happens if we formulate Problem 28 for higher
cardinals.
Problem 29. (O. G. Okunev) Let Y be a compact subspace of an inﬁnite
? 1054.
space Cp(X). Is it true that the tightness of Y does not exceed the Lindel¨of
degree of Cp(X)?
Problem 28 can be reformulated in the following way. Let X be a compact
space such that there exists a Lindel¨of subspace Y of Cp(X) separating the
points of X—i.e., such that for every two diﬀerent points x1, x2 ∈X one can
ﬁnd f ∈Y such that f(x1) ̸= f(x2). Is it true that the tightness of X is
countable? To show that this question is equivalent to Problem 28 one only
has to apply the evaluation mapping ψ: X →Cp(Y ).
Let us recall that a space Y is co-Lindel¨of if there exists a Lindel¨of space X
such that Y is homeomorphic to a subspace of Cp(X).
Problem 30. Is it true that every continuous image of a compact co-Lindel¨of
? 1055.

ch. 31]
Arkhangel′ski
/ Cp-theory
611
space is co-Lindel¨of?
The answer “yes” to the last question will imply a positive answer to Prob-
lem 28. Indeed, every subspace of a co-Lindel¨of space is co-Lindel¨of, and if
X is a compact space of uncountable tightness then some closed subspace of X
can be mapped continuously onto T (ω1 + 1) (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1978]).
One can state Problem 30 for perfect mappings as well.
Problem 31. Let X be a compact space such that ℵ1 is a caliber of Cp(X). 1056. ?
Is it true that X is metrizable?
Our assumptions imply that X has an ℵ1-inaccessible diagonal in the sense
of M. Huˇsek (see Huˇsek [1977] and Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1987]). It was shown
by Zhou in [1982] that it is consistent with ZFC to assert every such compact
space is metrizable. Thus one cannot expect to construct a counterexample
in ZFC.
Problem 32. Let X and Y be t-equivalent compact spaces. Is it true that 1057. ?
the tightness of X and Y are equal, i.e., is it true that t(X) = t(Y )?
For non-compact spaces O. G. Okunev has shown that even l-equivalence
does not preserve tightness (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1989b, 1985]).
On the
other hand, it was shown by V. V. Tkachuk that in the class of compact
spaces tightness is preserved by l-equivalence (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1989b]).
Problem 33. Let X
l∼Y , where X is a compact Fr´echet-Urysohn space. 1058. ?
Must Y be a Fr´echet-Urysohn space as well?
What if X
t∼Y and Y is
compact?
For compact sequential spaces the answer is “yes”.
Problem 34. Let X be a Hewitt-Nachbin space such that Cp(X) is Lindel¨of. 1059. ?
Must then X be Lindel¨of?
If X is the Σ-product of uncountably many unit segments then X is normal
countably compact but not compact and hence not Lindel¨of while Cp(X) is
Lindel¨of (see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1987]). I do not have any idea how diﬃcult
Problem 34 will prove to be.
Problem 35. Let X and Y be l-equivalent separable metrizable spaces and 1060. ?
let one of them be ˇCech-complete.
Is it true that the other space is also
ˇCech-complete1?
1Remark by the editors: this question was answered recently in the aﬃrmative by Pol,
Baars, de Groot and Pelant.

/ Cp-theory
[ch. 31
This question is quite natural as Okunev has shown that in the class of
separable metrizable spaces local compactness is preserved by l-equivalence
(see Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1987]).
Let Y be a (closed) subspace of X. A t-extender (l-extender) from Y to
X is a continuous (linear continuous) mapping ψ: Cp(Y ) →Cp(X) such that
ψ(g)|Y = g for every g ∈Cp(Y ). We say that Y is t-embedded (l-embedded)
in X if there exists a t-extender (l-extender) from Y to X. Every closed sub-
space of any metrizable space is l-embedded in it. Each compact metrizable
space is l-embedded in every space containing it (see Dugundji [1951]).
Problem 36. Let τ > ℵ0. Is it true that Dτ is t-embedded in Iτ?
? 1061.
Here Dτ = {0, 1}τ. Observe that Dτ is not l-embedded in Iτ for τ > ℵ0.
Problem 37.
Is it true that every compact space is l-embedded (is t-
? 1062.
embedded) into some topologically homogeneous compact space?
It was shown by D. Motorov that there exists a compact metrizable space
which is not a retract of any topologically homogeneous compact space. This
was generalized by Arkhangel′ski˘ı in [1985]. If the answer to Problem 37 is
positive (at least in the case of t-embeddings) then there exists a topologically
homogeneous compact space X such that the cellularity c(X) of X is as large
as we want—in particular we can choose such X so that c(X) > 2ℵ0. This
would answer a well-known question of E. K. van Douwen.
Problem 38. Let S be the convergent sequence together with its limit point,
? 1063.
i.e., S = {0, 1
n: n ∈N+}. Is it true that for every compact metrizable space X
the spaces X and X × S are l-equivalent? or t-equivalent?
The answer is “yes” for all inﬁnite compact polyhedra.
Problem 39. Let X be a compact space such that Cp(Cp(X)) (= Cp,2(X))
? 1064.
is Lindel¨of. Is it true that Cp(X) is Lindel¨of?
More problems on Cp(X) are formulated in the surveys Arkhangel′ski˘ı
[1988b, 1987] and in the book Arkhangel′ski˘ı [1989b].
I think that most of the problems formulated in this article are interesting
and diﬃcult enough—I venture to speculate that at least half of them will
remain unsolved in 1996 and at that at least ﬁve of them will remain open at
the beginning of the third millennium.

1. Topologically Equivalent Measures on the Cantor Space
Two measures µ and ν deﬁned on the family of all Borel subsets of a topolog-
ical space X are said to be homeomorphic or topologically equivalent provided
there exists a homeomorphism h: X →X such that µ = νh−1. This means
that for each Borel set E, µ(E) = ν(h−1(E)). The measure µ is said to be
a continuous image of ν if h is only required to be continuous.
Oxtoby
and Ulam [1941] characterized those probability measures, µ, on the ﬁnite
dimensional cubes [0, 1]n, which are homeomorphic to Lebesgue measure—µ
must give each point measure zero, each nonempty open set positive measure
and the boundary of the cube must have µ measure zero. Later Oxtoby
and Prasad [1978] extended this theorem to the Hilbert cube. The situation
regarding the Cantor set remains unsolved—even for product measures.
Let X = {0, 1}N and for each r, 0 ≤r ≤1, let µ(r) be the inﬁnite product
probability measure on X determined by r: µ(r) = ∞

1−r and µn(1) = r, for all n. For each r, let E(r) = {s: µ(r) is homeomorphic
to µ(s)}.
First, let us note when one of these product measures is a continuous image
of another.

Conversely, let us assume that (1) and (2) hold. Let E be a subset of {0, 1}n
such that E has exactly ai members e with #(e) = i. Notice that if σ ∈{0, 1}N,
then σ has a unique representation as
σ = t1 ∗t2 ∗t2 ∗t3 · · · ,

where for each i, ti is in {0, 1}n. Deﬁne f: {0, 1}N →{0, 1}N by f(σ)(i) = 1,
if and only if ti ∈E. Clearly, f is a continuous map of {0, 1}N into {0, 1}N

From this it follows that µ(r) is the image of µ(s) under f.
1.2. Example. µ(1/2) is the image of µ(1/

2).
Let us note that there are many maps which take µ(s) to µ(r). For if f is
such map, then since µ(s) = µ(s) ◦h, where h is a homeomorphism induced
by a permutation, µ(r) = µ(s) ◦f ◦h. Theorem 1.1 characterizes those shift
invariant product measures µ(s) and µ(r) such that each is a continuous image
of the other.

A number of references can be drawn from Theorem 1.1. For each r, let F(r) =
{s: each of µ(r) and µ(s) is a continuous image of the other}. Navarro-
Bermudez [1979, 1984] showed:
1.5. Theorem. For each r, F(r) is countable and F(r) ⊇E(r). If r is ratio-
nal or transcendental, then E(r) = F(r) and consists of exactly its obvious
members: E(r) = {r, 1 −r}.
Huang extended this theorem by proving the same result in case r is an
algebraic integer of degree two. The situation is more complicated for the
other algebraic numbers. For example, Huang [1986] proved:
1.6. Theorem. For each n > 2, there is an algebraic integer r ∈(0, 1) of
degree n and a number s ∈(0, 1) such that r and s satisfy relations of the
form (9) and (10) and s ̸= r and s ̸= 1 −r.
Let us examine Huang’s algebraic integer of degree three. It is the unique
real solution of
r3 + r2 −1 = 0
(A)
(It is perhaps worth noting that 1/r is the smallest Pisot-Vijayaraghavan
number.) Now, set
s = r2.
(B)
Clearly, s ̸= r and s ̸= 1 −r. Oxtoby and Navarro-Bermudez [1988]
showed that for this r and s, the measures µ(r), µ(1 −r), µ(s), and µ(1 −s)
are topologically equivalent.

F(r) consists of exactly the four numbers r, 1 −r, r2 and 1 −r2?

2. Two-Point Sets
Mazurkiewicz [1914] showed that there is a “two-point” subset M of R2, i.e.,
M meets each line in exactly 2 points. Direct generalizations of this result
were given by Erd¨os and Bagemihl [1957]. The axiom of choice plays a
central role in the construction of M. The problem naturally arises as to how
eﬀective such a construction can be.

622
Mauldin / Problems arising from Analysis
[ch. 32
Problem 2.1. Is there a Borel set M in R2 which meets each straight line
? 1068.
in exactly two points? Can M be a Gδ set?
Larman [1968] has shown that M cannot be an Fσ set. But, even whether
M can be a Gδ set is unknown. It is known that if M is an analytic set
then M is a Borel set. This follows for example from the fact that every
analytic subset A of R2 such that each vertical ﬁber Ax has cardinality ≤2
lies in a Borel set B such that each vertical ﬁber has cardinality ≤2. Miller
has shown that V = L implies that M can be taken to be a coanalytic set
(Miller [1989]).
I have proven the following.
2.2. Theorem. A two point set M must always be totally disconnected, i.e.,
every connected subset of M consists of a single point.
Larman’s Theorem follows from this since each σ-compact subset of R2
which meets each vertical line in two points contains the graph of a continuous
function deﬁned on some interval.
Problem 2.3. Must a two-point set M always be zero-dimensional?
? 1069.
Note that if E is a subset of the plane which meets each line in 2ω points then
there is a two-point set M lying in E. Since there is such a subset E of the
plane which is both zero-dimensional and of planar Lebesgue measure 0, M
can be both zero-dimensional and of Lebesgue measure 0. On the other hand,
one can construct M such that M meets each closed subset of R2 which has
positive Lebesgue measure. Thus, M can also be taken to be non-Lebesgue
measurable. It should be noted that the property of being a partial two-point
set cannot necessarily be extended. For example, the unit circle meets each
line in no more than two points but of course we cannot even add a single
point to this set and retain this property.
Problem 2.4. Can a zero-dimensional partial two-point set always be ex-

tended to a two-point set?
(van Mill and I note that this is true assuming CH holds).
3. Pisot-Vijayaraghavan Numbers
Let S be the set of all Pisot-Vijayaraghavan numbers. Thus, x ∈S if and
only if x is an algebraic number, x > 1 and all its conjugates have moduli
less than 1. Salem [1983] proved that the countable set S is also a closed
subset of R. Siegel [1944] showed that the smallest element of S is the root
of x3 −x2 −1. Pisot and Dufrenoy [1953] showed that the smallest number
in the Cantor-Bendixson derived set of S is the root of x2 −x −1.

4. Finite Shift Maximal Sequences Arising in Dynamical Systems
A particular countable linear order type arises in one-dimensional dynamics.
A simple case occurs in the iteration of the critical point in a scaled family of
unimodal maps of the unit interval one-dimensional dynamics. For example,
consider the quadratic map q(x) = 4x(1 −x) on the unit interval, [0, 1]. For
each λ, 0 ≤λ ≤1, consider the itinerary, Iλq(1/2), of the critical point of the
scaled map, λq. Thus
Iλq(1/2)(i) =



R,
if (λq)i(1/2) > 1/2,
C,
if (λq)i(1/2) = 1/2,
L,
if (λq)i(1/2) < 1/2.
We make the convention that the sequence stops at the ﬁrst C if there is a C
in the sequence. Thus, a ﬁnite itinerary arises from a value of λ such that 1/2
is periodic under λq. The set of all possible itineraries has been abstractly
characterized as follows. First, consider the parity-lexicographic order on the
space S of all ﬁnite and inﬁnite sequences of R, L and C such that if the
sequence has a C there is only one C and it is the last term of the sequence.
Thus, if A = (A1, A2, . . .) and B = (B1, B2, . . .) are elements of S, then A ≤B
provided Ai < Bi, where i is the ﬁrst place where A and B disagree and we
use the order L < C < R if there are an even number of R’s preceding Ai in
A and we use the reverse order if there are an odd number. An element A
of S is said to be shift maximal provided A is not less than any of its shifts,
σi(A) = (Ai+1, Ai+2, . . .) in the parity-lexicographic order.
4.1. Theorem. An element A = (A1, A2, A3, . . .) is the itinerary of 1/2 under
the quadratic map, q, for some value of λ if and only if A is shift maximal.
This theorem is true not only for the quadratic map but for a general wide
class of maps of [0, 1] onto [0, 1] (See Collet and Eckman [1980] and Beyer,
Mauldin and Stein [1986].)
Problem 4.2. What is the order type of the countable set of ﬁnite shift- 1073. ?
maximal sequences in the parity-lexicographic order?
5. Borel Selectors and Matchings
Consider the hyperspace of all compact subsets of the unit interval, K(I).
There are exactly 2 continuous selectors. If f: K(I) →I is continuous and

624
Mauldin / Problems arising from Analysis
[ch. 32
for each compact set K, f(K) ∈K, then either f(K) = max(K) for all K or
else f(K) = min(K) for all K. In Mauldin [1980], I showed that there are
ω1 Borel measurable selectors fα: K(I) →I such that if K is an uncountable
compact set, then the values fα(K) are distinct.
Problem 5.1. Can one prove in ZFC that there are continuum many Borel
? 1074.
measurable selectors on K(I) such that for each uncountable compact set K,
the selected points of K are all distinct?
There does exist such a family of Borel selectors if instead of the un-
countable compact sets, one considers the family of compact perfect sets
(Mauldin [1979]).
Problem 5.2. Let B be a Borel subset of [0, 1]×[0, 1] such that each horizon-
? 1075.
tal and each vertical ﬁber of B is co-meager. Can B be ﬁlled up by a collection
of pairwise disjoint graphs of Borel isomorphisms of [0, 1] onto [0, 1]?
Debs and Saint-Raymond [1989] have shown that B does contain a Borel
matching—the graph of some Borel isomorphism. This result is false if co-
meager is replaced by Lebesgue measure one. An example of such a set is
given in Graf and Mauldin [1985] and in more detail in Mauldin and
Schlee [1989]. More problems on this theme are given in Mauldin [1989].
6. Dynamical Systems on S1 × R—Invariant Continua
Fix a > 0 and B > 0 and deﬁne a map T : S1 × R →S1 × R by
T (ei2πx, y) = (ei2πax, B(y −A(x)).
In order for the map to be well-deﬁned and continuous, we assume A: R →R
is continuous, has period 1 and that a is a positive integer. For convenience,
we assume ∥A∥= 1. Note that T maps the ﬁber {ei2πx} × R one-to-one and
onto {ei2πax} × R. Also, T restricted to the ﬁber is an orientation preserving
similarity map with similarity ratio
B: ∥T (e2πix, y) −T (e2πix, z)∥= B|y −z|.
This map or close relatives have been studied by Kaplan, Mallet-Paret
and Yorke [1984], Moser [1969] and Fredrickson et al [1983]. In order
to examine the dynamics of T , note that
T n(ei2πx, y) = (e2πianx, Bny −
n−1

p=0
Bn−pA(apx)).

§6]
Dynamical Systems on S1 × R—Invariant Continua
625
If a = 1, then the dynamics are quite simple. If B = 1, then T n(e2πix, y) =
(e2πix, y −nA(x)) and the asymptotic behaviour is clear. If B ̸= 1, then the
graph G, of
f(x) = (
B
B −1)A(x)
lifted to the cylinder is invariant. If 0 < B < 1, this graph is a universal
attractor. In fact, for each x and y, T n(e2πix, y) →(e2πix, G(x)). If B > 1,
this graph is a repeller. The points of the cylinder above the graph iterate to
+∞and those below iterate to −∞.
From this point on, we assume a ≥2. Now the map T is a-to-1:
T −1(e2πix, y) =
!
(e2πi((x+k)/a), B−1y + A((x + k)/a)): k = 0, . . . , a −1
"
.
If B > 1, then the graph of the continuous, period 1 function f which satisﬁes
the functional equation:
f(ax) = B(f(x) −A(x))
is invariant. Or, setting b = 1/B,
f(x) = A(x) + bf(x).
The unique solution of this equation is the Weierstrass function:
f(x) =
∞

p=0
bP A(apx).
The graph of f on the cylinder is a nowhere diﬀerentiable invariant 1-torus. It
is also a universal repeller. The points of the cylinder above the graph iterate
to +∞and those below iterate to −∞. The capacity dimension of this graph is
2+log b/ log a, in some cases (Kaplan, Mallet-Paret and Yorke [1984]).
The Hausdorﬀdimension of this set is a long standing unsolved problem. It is
widely believed that the capacity dimension is the Hausdorﬀdimension. The
best estimates in the general case are given in Mauldin and Williams [1986].
Problem 6.1. Find the Hausdorﬀdimension, γ, of this graph. Moreover, ﬁnd 1076. ?
the exact Hausdorﬀdimension function—if there is one. In other words, ﬁnd a
slowly varying function L(t) such that 0 < Hh(f) < ∞, where h(t) = tγL(t).
If 0 < B < 1, then T has an attracting continuum M. This is seen by
noticing that if |y| ≤
B
1−B , then
|B(y −A(x))| ≤B(|y| + |A(x)|) ≤B(
B
1 −B + 1) =

Then M is an invariant continuum which separates S1 × R and M attracts
the orbit of all points. Pat Carter and I have shown that T acts chaotically
on the continuum M. The case 0 < B < 1 is very diﬀerent from the case
1 < B, in fact I conjecture:
Problem 6.2. Is it true that M is a Sierpi´nski curve? In particular, is this
? 1077.
true if A is the tent map on [0, 1]?
Let us remark that in general M is not a graph in this case. Let us assume
M is the graph of a function from S1 into R. Since the graph is compact,
there is a continuous period one map f: R →R such that M is the graph of
the lift of f to the cylinder. Since
T (ei2πx, f(x)) = (ei2πax, B(f(x) −A(x))),
the function f must satisfy the functional equation
f(ax) = B(f(x) −A(x)),
for all x. Or,
f(x) = A(x) + 1
B f(ax).
However, Pat Carter and I have shown that for some functions, the unique
solution of this equation which is continuous at zero does not have period one.
This class includes the case when A is nonnegative. In particular, if A is the
tent map, M is not a graph.

7. Borel Cross-Sections
Let X be an indecomposable continuum and consider the decomposition of X
into its composants and let R be the corresponding equivalence relation: R
is a Borel subset of X × X and each equivalence class is a meager, dense, Fσ
subset of X. I have raised the following question over the past ﬁfteen years,
but it probably has been known much earlier.
Problem 7.1. Is there a Borel subset B of X which meets each equivalence 1079. ?
class in exactly one point?
While this question remains unsolved, there is one case for which the answer
is no. The continuum X is said to be strictly transitive in the sense of category
provided that for each subset E of X which has the Baire property and which
can be expressed as the union of some composants either E or X \E is meager
(Kuratowski [1968]).
7.2. Theorem. Let X be an indecomposable continuum which is strictly
transitive in the sense of category. There is no Borel cross-section for the
composants of X.
Proof. Assume that there is a Borel cross-section B. For each subset E of
X, let sat(E) be the union of all composants which meet E. Notice that if E
is a Borel set, then sat(E) of E is analytic, since sat(E) = proj2(R∩(E ×X))
and, therefore, sat(E) has the Baire property. Deﬁne a probability measure,
µ, on the Borel subsets of B as follows: µ(E) = 1, if sat(E) is co-meager, and
µ(E) = 0, otherwise. Then µ gives each singleton measure 0, and each Borel
subset of B has measure 0 or 1. This is impossible.
There are a number of indecomposable continua which are strictly transi-
tive: Knaster continua (Kuratowski [1968]) and those admitting a Polish
group action for which the orbit decomposition consists of the composants
(Rogers [1986]).

One can argue quite convincingly that continuum theory ﬁrst arose from
problems in dynamics even before there was a deﬁnition of a topological space.
It is rather diﬃcult (and, we suppose, pointless) to give a deﬁnition of a
dynamical system that is general enough to cover all of the situations in which
the term is used. There is a common underlying goal in the study of dynamical
systems though, and that is to gain an understanding in some qualitative
sense (topological or statistical) of the orbit structure of iterative processes.
Here we will restrict our consideration to dynamical systems consisting of self
maps of metric spaces. We make no claim to being encyclopedic, even with
this restriction. Our intention is to show the reader that strange topology
has come up in dynamics from the beginning, to impart some of the ﬂavor of
the ﬁeld of dynamical systems, and to introduce the reader both to some of
the applications of continuum theory to the study of dynamical systems and
to the problems coming into continuum theory from dynamical systems. We
begin with some deﬁnitions and notation.
Let X be a metric space and let f: X →X be a continuous map. Given x
in X, the orbit of x is the set O(x) = {f n(x) : n ≥0}, where by f n(x) we
mean f(f n−1(x)) for n ≥1 and f 0(x) = x. The point x is a ﬁxed point of f
if f(x) = x. More generally, x is a periodic point if f n(x) = x for some n ≥1;
in this case O(x) is ﬁnite and the period of x (or of O(x)) is the cardinality
of O(x). If x is in X and there is an open set O in X containing x such
that {f −n(O) : n ≥0} is a disjoint collection, then x is a wandering point
for f. If there is a point x in X such that O(x) is dense in X, then f is
said to be transitive. A closed set A in X is an attracting set for f, or an
attractor, if there is an open set U containing A such that ∞
n=0 f n(U) = A,
and f(U) ⊆U. (Please note that this is not the only deﬁnition of attracting
set being used.) A closed set D of the space X is minimal for f if f(D) = D
and for x ∈D, {f n(x) :≥0} is dense in D. If D = X, then f is minimal.
A continuum X is indecomposable if every proper subcontinuum of X is
nowhere dense in X. If it is not indecomposable, then it is decomposable. A
continuum is hereditarily indecomposable (decomposable) if every nondegen-
erate subcontinuum is indecomposable (decomposable). An open chain C in
the space X is a ﬁnite collection C = {C0, C1, . . . , Cn} of open sets such that
Ci ∩Cj ̸= φ if and only if |i −j| ≤1. An open circular chain C is a ﬁnite
collection C = {C0, . . . , Cn} of open sets such that Ci ∩Cj ̸= φ if and only if
|i −j| ≤1 or i = 0, j = n. A continuum is chainable (circularly chainable) if
for each ϵ > 0, it has an open chain (circular chain) cover of mesh less than ϵ.
In 1913, C. Carath´eodory, needing to deal with the fact that although an
open, connected, simply connected subset U of S2 is homeomorphic to the
interior of a disk, its boundary need not be a simple closed curve, or even
anything close to a simple closed curve, developed in a pair of papers his
theory of prime ends. (For a modern, topological treatment and the original
references, see Mather [1982].)
Central to Carath´eodory’s theory is the
635

Barge and Kennedy / Continua and Dynamics
[ch. 33
following theorem:
1. Theorem (Carath´eodory). Let W be a connected, simply connected open
set in S2 with W −W containing more than one point. There is a compact-
iﬁcation W ⋆of W such that W ⋆is homeomorphic to a closed disk D where
points in W are associated with points in the interior of D. (W ⋆−W is the
collection of Carath´eodory’s prime ends.) Further, if F: S2 →S2 is a homeo-
morphism with F(W) = W, then F|W extends to a map F ⋆: W ⋆→W ⋆.
What exactly does this do for us? It means that one way we can study
the dynamics of F is by studying the corresponding dynamics on S1 and
D, which have been extensively studied. For what Carath´eodory has found
is a conjugacy: there is a homeomorphism β from D to W ⋆and if ˆF =
β−1F ⋆β, then β ˆF = F ⋆β. The maps ˆF and F ⋆will have the same dynamical
properties. Associated with the prime ends are continua in W −W which
Carath´eodory calls impressions and principal sets. (If the map β above were
only a continuous surjection (but still β ˆF = F ⋆β), then we would say that ˆF
and F ⋆were semi-conjugate. In this case ˆF and F ⋆share some, but not all,
dynamical properties.)
An important concept due to Poincar´e is that of rotation number. If g is
an orientation preserving homeomorphism of S1, π is the standard covering
map from R to S1 (i.e., π(x) = exp(2πix) and G: R →R is a map such that
πG = gπ, deﬁne pG(x) = limn→∞Gn(x)/n for x in S1. The rotation number
r(g) is then the unique number r in [0, 1) such that pG(x) −r is an integer.
This number is independent of the choice of x and G. Loosely, what this
number measures is the average rotation under iteration of g, of a point on
the circle. A homeomorphism g of S1 has a rational rotation number if and
only if it has periodic points. It has a ﬁxed point if and only if it has rotation
number 0.
By means of prime end theory, one can talk about the rotation numbers of
those points of W −W accessible from W (i.e., those points p in W −W such
that there is an arc A in W such that A ∩(W −W) = {p}.)
In [1932], G. D. Birkhoff used the notion of rotation number of accessible
points to study the dynamics of an annulus map having an unusual invariant
set G. This set G is the boundary set for an open set G1, which contains
one boundary circle, and for another disjoint open set G2, which contains the
other boundary circle. The set G has the property that it contains a dense set
of points accessible from G1 with one rotation number, and another dense set
of points accessible from G2 with, surprisingly, a diﬀerent rotation number.
Charpentier, in [1934], later proved that this continuum is indecomposable.
(Our source for this information and some of what follows is Alligood and
Yorke [1989].)
Cartwright and Littlewood in [1945] and [1951] further developed the
study of the relationship between the dynamics of prime ends and the dynam-
ics of the boundary of an invariant region in the course of studying second

order diﬀerential equations in the plane. In their investigations, they found
that, at certain parameter values, an associated Poincar´e homeomorphism
admits a certain invariant plane separating continuum and they conjectured
that this continuum contains an indecomposable continuum. It has recently
been proven that this continuum of Cartwright and Littlewood is indecom-
posable (see Barge and Gillette [1988]). Also, J. Mather has used prime
ends to study the invariant sets of area-preserving homeomorphism of the an-
nulus in Mather [1979] and [1981], and K. Alligood and J. Yorke have used
them to investigate the dynamics of accessible points on basin boundaries in
Alligood and Yorke [1989].
In early “dynamical systems” as practiced by Poincar´e, the system was typ-
ically the solution to a diﬀerential equation modeling some physical process.
Periodic orbits correspond to periodic physical phenomena and it was just
such phenomena that were most commonly observed in nature. This at least
partially explains why much of the theory at present has to do with periodic
points and their distribution.
A beautiful theorem regarding periodic points due to A. N. Sarkovski˘ı is
the following. Let the integers be ordered by 3 ◁5 ◁7 ◁9 ◁. . . ◁2(3) ◁2(5) ◁
2(7) ◁. . . ◁22(3) ◁22(5) ◁. . . ◁2n+1 ◁2n ◁. . . ◁2 ◁1.
2. Theorem (Sarkovski˘ı’s Theorem, Sarkovski˘ı [1964]).
If f: I →I is
a continuous map of the compact interval I and f has a periodic point of
period n, then f has a periodic point of period m for all m such that n ◁m.
Spaces other than I on which this theorem remains valid have been found
(e.g., hereditarily decomposable chainable continua (Minc and Transue
[1989a]), and certain ordered spaces (Schirmer [1985]), and modiﬁcations
of the theorem work on the circle (Block, Guckenheimer, Misiurewicz
and Young [1979]) and on certain trees (Alseda, Llibre and Misiurewicz
[1989], Baldwin [1988], and Imrich and Kalinowski [1985]). A nice proof
of the Sarkovski˘ı Theorem can be found in Block, Guckenheimer, Misi-
urewicz and Young [1979].
One sees from Sarkovski˘ı’s Theorem that if a map of a compact interval has
a periodic orbit of period not a power of two then the map has inﬁnitely many
periodic orbits of inﬁnitely many diﬀerent periods. Such a map also has orbits
exhibiting various types of complicated behavior. (See Li and Yorke [1975].)
Maps with the above dynamical properties are sometimes referred to as
being chaotic. In physical applications, the space X may be a collection of
possible states of some system and the map f: X →X the law by which states
evolve. Chaotic dynamical properties of f then correspond to complicated and
computationally unpredictable evolution in the physical system.
The most widely used measure of complexity of a dynamical system is topo-
logical entropy. There are a number of equivalent deﬁnitions of topological
entropy, one of which we give now. Let f: X →X be a map of the compact

638
Barge and Kennedy / Continua and Dynamics
[ch. 33
topological space X with metric d. Let ϵ > 0 and n in N be given. The set
E ⊆X is said to be (n, ϵ)-separated (under f) provided that for each x, y in
E, x ̸= y, there is a k in {0, 1, . . ., n −1} such that d(f k(x), f k(y)) ≥ϵ. Let
S(n, ϵ, f) = max{|E| : E is (n, ϵ)-separated}. Thus S(n, ϵ, f) is the greatest
number of orbit segments {x, f(x), . . . , f n−1(x)} of length n that can be dis-
tinguished one from another provided we can only distinguish between points
of X that are at least ϵ apart. Now let h(f, ϵ) = lim supn→∞ln S(n, ϵ, f)/n
and let h(f) = limϵ→0 h(f, ϵ). The number h(f) is called the topological en-
tropy of f. It is an easy exercise to show that h = h(f) is independent of the
(equivalent) metric used and that h is an invariant of topological conjugacy.
If h(f) > 0 then, for some ϵ > 0, the number S(n, ϵ, f) of distinguishable
orbit segments of length n grows exponentially with n.
This behavior is
consistent with complicated dynamics and, in fact, is sometimes given as the
deﬁnition of chaotic dynamics. For maps f: I →I of the compact interval
I there is the pleasing (in view of Sarkovski˘ı’s Theorem) result: h(f) > 0 if
and only if f has a periodic orbit of period not a power of 2 (see Bowen and
Franks [1976] and Misiurewicz [1979]).
Although a connection between periodicity and entropy persists for maps of
continua other than the interval, the correspondence is generally less precise.
For example, in [1980] Katok has proven that if f: M 2 →M 2 is a C1+α
diﬀeomorphism of the compact surface M 2 and h(f) > 0, then some power
of f has periodic orbits of all periods. On the other hand, Rees [1981] has
constructed an example of a positive entropy homeomorphism of the two-
dimensional torus that is minimal. (Every orbit is dense so, in particular,
there are no periodic orbits.)
As topologically simple as the compact interval I is, it is remarkable that
maps of I can have such complicated dynamical properties. Even the much
studied quadratic family fλ: [0, 1] →[0, 1] deﬁned by fλ(x) = λx(1 −x),
λ in [0, 4], is not completely understood.
(See May [1976] and Collet
and Eckmann [1980] for an introduction to this family.) Homeomorphisms
of I, on the other hand, are dynamically quite trivial. (For the interested
reader, R. Devaney’s book, An Introduction to Chaotic Dynamical Systems
(Devaney [1976]), contains a good elementary discussion of the dynamics of
the interval. Another text we might recommend is P. Walters’ An Introduc-
tion to Ergodic Theory (Walters [1982]), the second half of which is about
topological dynamics.)
In some sense, possible dynamical properties of homeomorphisms of a space
are dictated by the topology.
In order to take advantage of this for non-
homeomorphisms (endomorphisms) one can pass to inverse limits. By this we
mean the following. Let f: X →X be a map of the compact metric space
X and let (X, f) be the inverse limit space (X, f) = {(x0, x1, . . .) : xi ∈
X, f(xi+1) = xi for i = 0, 1, . . .}. Then (X, f) is also a continuum with
metric d((x0, x1, . . .), (y0, y1, . . .)) = ∞
i=0 |xi −yi|/2i where | | denotes the

metric in X. The map f then induces the shift homeomorphism
ˆf: (X, f) →(X, f) deﬁned by ˆf((x0, x1, . . .)) = (f(x0), x0, x1, . . .).
The dynamical properties of f and ˆf are nearly identical. For example,
h(f) = h( ˆf), n is a period of a periodic orbit of f if and only if n is a
period of a periodic orbit of ˆf, etc. Topologically, (X, f) may be much more
complicated than X, but at least ˆf is a homeomorphism. Generally speaking,
the increased topological complexity of (X, f) is a reﬂection of dynamical
properties possessed by f that are not possible for homeomorphisms of X.
For example, if f: I →I is a map of the compact interval I possessing
a periodic orbit of period not a power of 2, then (I, f) contains an inde-
composable subcontinuum. Conversely, if f is piecewise monotone and (I, f)
contains an indecomposable subcontinuum then f has a periodic orbit of pe-
riod not a power of 2. This and related results can be found in Barge and
Martin [1985a, 1987, 1985b], and Ingram [1987].
Inverse limits have also proven useful in describing attractors in dynamical
systems.
(For a general discussion of the notion of an attractor see Mil-
nor [1985].) In [1967], R. F. Williams shows that if A is a suﬃciently nice
one-dimensional attractor of a diﬀeomorphism F of the manifold M, then F|A
is topologically conjugate to the shift map induced on an inverse limit space
(K, f), where f: K →K is an endomorphism of the branched one-dimensional
manifold K. Conversely, given a diﬀerentiable endomorphism f of a branched
one-manifold K, the inverse limit (K, f) can be embedded in the 4-sphere S4
and the shift map extended to a diﬀeomorphism of S4 possessing (K, f) as
an attractor. The result is that suﬃciently nice, but still very complicated,
attractors can be understood, topologically and dynamically, in terms of a
one-dimensional map.
In a similar vein, it is not diﬃcult to show (Barge and Martin [1990])
that, given any map f: I →I of the compact interval I, the inverse limit
space (I, f) can be embedded in the plane R2 and the shift map ˆf extended
to a homeomorphism F: R2 →R2 in such a way that (I, f) is an attractor
for F. For some (all?) f this can be done so that F is a diﬀeomorphism
(Misiurewicz [1985], Barge [1988]). Deciding which planar attractors or
invariant sets can be modeled using inverse limits on relatively simple spaces
is a more diﬃcult problem.
In [1982] Michael Handel constructed a remarkable example, an area-
preserving C∞diﬀeomorphism f of the plane with the pseudocircle PC as a
minimal set. The pseudocircle PC can be characterized as a plane separating,
hereditarily indecomposable circularly chainable continuum. This extraordi-
nary continuum contains no nontrivial continuous images of arcs, is nearly
homogeneous but not homogeneous (i.e., if x is in PC, {h(x) : h: PC →PC
is a homeomorphism } is dense in PC, but not equal to PC), and imitates

640
Barge and Kennedy / Continua and Dynamics
[ch. 33
somewhat a compact abelian topological group with its nice group of “ro-
tations” (Kennedy and Rogers [1986]). If the requirement that f be area
preserving is dropped, PC can be made an attracting set for f. There is a well
deﬁned irrational rotation number for f|PC, but f|PC is not semi-conjugate
to a rotation on S1.
Every nondegenerate proper subcontinuum of a pseudocircle is a contin-
uum known as a pseudoarc. Pseudoarcs can be characterized as chainable
hereditarily indecomposable continua. They are homogeneous, have the ﬁxed
point property, and don’t separate the plane. R. H. Bing showed that if one
puts the Hausdorﬀmetric on the collection of all plane continua, then the
collection of all pseudoarcs is a dense Gδ-subset of this space. George Hen-
derson [1964] has expressed the pseudoarc P as an inverse limit system on
the interval with one bonding map. (His bonding map is surprisingly simple.
Its graph looks much like the graph of g(x) = x2, x ∈[0, 1], with little notches
in it.) P. Minc and W. Transue [1989b] have constructed a map f on I
such that the inverse limit space (I, f) is a pseudoarc and ˆf is transitive. It
then follows from this and the work of Barge and Martin in [1990] that the
pseudoarc can be embedded in R2 in such a way that the shift map ˆf on P
can be extended to a homeomorphism F on R2 so that (I, f) = P is a chaotic
attractor for F. Using diﬀerent techniques, J. Kennedy, in [1989a, 1989b]
and [1990], has constructed a chaotic homeomorphism on the pseudoarc and
one with positive entropy.
As we have glimpsed then, the complexity of a dynamical system is reﬂected
in the complexity of its invariant sets, and this is where continuum theory
can and has come into the picture. Even in relatively well behaved dynamical
systems these invariant sets can be complicated.
At the beginning of the chapter on topological methods in his book on
partial diﬀerential equations J. Smoller [1983] makes the following remarks:
“The invention of modern topology goes back to Poincar´e, who was led to it in
his study of the diﬀerential equations of celestial mechanics. Its development
was taken over, for quite a while, by people who interestingly enough, seemed
to have completely forgotten its origins. Perhaps this really was necessary
in order that the subject develop rapidly.” Although topologists have not
been looking at these continua from a dynamical perspective, they have been
looking at them ever since the early 1920’s and the papers and questions of
Knaster and Kuratowski in the ﬁrst volumes of Fundamenta Mathematica.
A large body of knowledge exists about these continua and many potentially
useful tools have been developed. Also, the knowledge gained from considering
these dynamical problems will almost surely add to our knowledge of the
continua themselves.
We end with a list of some unsolved problems and, for the reader who
wishes more details on the topics just discussed, a list of references.

In this note I want to pose some questions about the diﬀerence between
one-dimensional and two-dimensional dynamical systems. The theory about
one-dimensional maps is rather complete. Let us mention some of these results
and analyze to what extent they can be generalised to the two-dimensional
case.
1. The existence of periodic points
One of the best known results on the dynamics of one-dimensional maps is
the one by Sarkovski˘ı. Take the following ordering on N:
3 ≺5 ≺7 ≺. . . ≺2n + 1 ≺. . . ≺2 · 3 ≺2 · 5 ≺2 · 7 ≺. . .
≺2m · 3 ≺2m · 5 ≺2m · 7 ≺. . . ≺. . . ≺2n ≺. . . ≺2 ≺1.
1.1. Theorem (Sarkovski˘ı, see Sarkovski˘ı [1964] and Block, Gucken-
heimer, Misiurewicz and Young [1979]). Let I be an interval and f: I →I
a continuous map. If f has a periodic orbit of period n then f has periodic
orbits of period m for all integers n such that n ≺m.
In fact one can prove much more than is stated here. For example, if f: I →
I has a periodic point p of period 4 such that p < f(p) < f 2(p) < f 3(p) then
f has also periodic orbits of periods 2n for each n. Furthermore inﬁnite orbits
(with certain ordering) also imply the existence of other orbits. Finally, from
the theory of Milnor and Thurston [1978] it follows that the dynamics of a
map f: I →I with a ﬁnite number of turning points is essentially determined
by the orbits of its turning points.
The idea of the proof of this theorem can be sketched as follows. Let p
be a periodic point of f of period n and O = {p, f(p), . . ., f n−1(p)}. Let
I1, . . . , In−1 be the intervals connecting consecutive points of O.
Because
f is continuous, f(Ii) covers at least one of the intervals I1, . . . , In−1.
In
particular, for each inﬁnite sequence of intervals J0, J1, J2, . . . such that Ji is
equal to one of the intervals I1, . . . , In−1 and such that f(Ji+1) ⊃Ji, there
exists a point x ∈J0 such f i(x) ∈Ji for all i ≥0. Choosing appropriate
sequences Ji one can construct the required periodic points.
Clearly this theorem is not valid in the two-dimensional case: a rotation
on a disc over degree 2π/3 has only periodic points of period 3 and 1. How-
ever, this example is misleading: using W. Thurston’s classiﬁcation of isotopy
classes of homeomorphisms on surfaces, see Thurston [1988] and Bleiler
and Casson [1988], one can prove the following
1.2. Theorem (Gambaudo, van Strien and Tresser [1990]).
Let D be a disc in the Euclidean plane and let f: D →D be a homeomor-
phisms from D onto its image. Assume that f has a periodic point p of period
three and let O = {p, f(p), f 2(p)}. Furthermore assume that O is knotted in
the following sense: there exists an arc γ connecting p and f(p) in D \ O such
647

648
van Strien / One- versus two-dimensional dynamics
[ch. 34
that f 3(γ) is not homotopic to γ in D \ O. Under these conditions f has
periodic orbits of each period.
That results of this type were to be expected already follows from Ph.
Boyland [1988].
The idea of the proof of this theorem goes roughly as follows. Let O be
a ‘knotted’ periodic orbit of f of period 3.
Using Thurston [1988], one
can prove that f: D \ O →D \ O is isotopic to a so-called pseudo-Anosov
map g (for this one uses that O is knotted). Using an index argument due
to Nielsen, see Asimov and Franks [1983], one can show that each periodic
orbit of g persists when one takes maps which are isotopic to g. In particular
it is suﬃcient to prove that g has periodic orbits of each period. Since the
dynamics of this pseudo-Anosov is ‘supported’ on a branched-manifold (called
a train-track), a collapsing procedure associates to g a continuous interval map
with a periodic orbit of period 3. By Sarkovski˘ı’s theorem the interval map
and therefore g has periodic orbits of each period.
In the proof of this theorem it is essential that one ends up with a train-
track that collapses to an interval. In general this is not the case: sometimes
the train-track collapses to a circle or to some branches manifold.
Question 1.
Describe the periodic orbits O of f: D →D for which Sarkov-
? 1088.
ski˘ı’s theorem remains valid (in terms of the action of f∗: π1(D \ O) →π1(D \
O)).
Question 2. Is it possible to extend these results to inﬁnite orbits?
? 1089.
Furthermore, if an interval f: I →I is analytic then it has at most a ﬁnite
number of turning points and therefore, as we remarked above, its dynamics
is essentially determined by the orbits of a ﬁnite number of points (its turning
points).
Question 3. Is there an analogue of this statement if f: D →D is analytic?
? 1090.
2. The boundary of ‘chaos’
In this section we shall say that a map is chaotic if its topological entropy is
positive. Non-chaotic interval maps can be easily characterised:
2.1. Theorem (Bowen and Franks [1976]). Let f: I →I be continuous.
Then f is non-chaotic if and only if every periodic orbit of f has period 2n
for some n ≥0. More precisely, suppose p is a periodic point of period 2n
and denote the orbit of p by O. Then there exists a periodic point q of period
2n−1 and a component J of I \ O containing q such that f i maps J onto a
component of I \ O for i = 1, . . . , 2n−1.

§2]
The boundary of ‘chaos’
649
This result shows that there is a clear tree structure on the set of periodic
orbits. The transition from non-chaotic to chaotic is also clear:
2.2. Theorem.
Take any one-parameter family fµ of continuous interval
maps depending continuously on the parameter. If fµ is chaotic for µ > µ0
and non-chaotic for µ < µ0 then fµ0 is non-chaotic, has periodic orbit of
periods 2n for every n ∈N and no other periods.
Of course this theorem is again false for homeomorphisms f: D →D (con-
sider the rotation of the disc from above). However, there is an exact analogue
of this theorem:
2.3. Theorem (Gambaudo, van Strien and Tresser [1989a]).
Let f: D →D be a homeomorphism onto its image. Then f is non-chaotic if
and only if every periodic orbit is rotation compatible. Furthermore, any two
periodic orbits are either disjoint, or they lie nested, or one is the parent of
the other.
Here a periodic orbit is rotation compatible, if it is also the periodic orbit
of a homeomorphism which is conjugate to a map which is built by successive
surgeries of rotations, see Gambaudo, van Strien and Tresser [1989a].
Partial results in this direction were already obtained in Boyland [1987].
Given a periodic orbit structure, it is not hard to construct homeomor-
phisms which have precisely these periodic orbits. However, if one gives an
inﬁnite number of periodic orbits it is not clear whether one can construct
C∞diﬀeomorphisms with these periodic orbits.
Question 4.
Which periodic structures can be represented by C∞diﬀeo- 1091. ?
morphisms? Is it for example possible to ﬁnd a C∞diﬀeomorphism with zero
topological entropy which has periodic orbits of periods 3n for each n ∈N
where each periodic orbit of period 3n+1 circles around the periodic orbit of
period 3n?
It is not too diﬃcult to show that there exist such C∞diﬀeomorphisms
with periodic orbits of periods pn if pn grows suﬃciently fast. For this one
can use the techniques of Franks and Young[1981]. However,
Question 5. Is it possible to construct such periodic orbits if f: D →D is 1092. ?
analytic?
Related to this is Smale’s question. In 1962, S. Smale asked whether there
exists a diﬀeomorphism f: D2 →D2 which has no periodic attractors, but
such that each of its periodic orbits is hyperbolic. R. Bowen, J. Franks
and L. S. Young proved that there exist C2 diﬀeomorphisms of the disc with
these properties. These example can not be easily made smoother. Indeed:

650
van Strien / One- versus two-dimensional dynamics
[ch. 34
2.4. Theorem (van Strien [1990]). The diﬀeomorphisms of R. Bowen, J.
Franks and L. S. Young are not conjugate to C3 diﬀeomorphisms.
The impossibility of smoothening these diﬀeomorphisms is caused by the
amount of twisting and the invariant curves which these diﬀeomorphisms have.
However, going about it much more carefully, one can prove the following
2.5. Theorem (Gambaudo, van Strien and Tresser [1989b]).
There exist analytic diﬀeomorphisms on D2 such that all of its periodic orbits
are hyperbolic and none of them are sinks or sources.
These diﬀeomorphisms were not constructed by hand but the existence was
deduced from the theory of renormalizations. More speciﬁcally, there is a
(small) codimension-one surface in the space of analytic diﬀeomorphism of
the disc such that each diﬀeomorphism which belongs to this surface has the
required properties. This surface is the stable-manifold of the so-called renor-
malization operator. This renormalization operator is ﬁrst deﬁned using the
corresponding renormalization operator acting on interval maps f: [0, 1] →
[0, 1]: to f one associates the restriction of f 2 to some interval (up to rescal-
ing). One can show that this operator has a hyperbolic ﬁxed point (in the
space of interval maps).
It turns out that one can extend this to diﬀeo-
morphisms of the disc which are ‘almost’ one-dimensional (in the sense that
they are close to a non-invertible map which sends the disc to a curve). The
non-invertible map is a hyperbolic ﬁxed point of this extended renormaliza-
tion operator and the stable manifold of this operator is the required surface.
Since the renormalization operator is only deﬁned for almost one-dimensional
maps, we can ask
Question 6. Can this surface be more globally deﬁned, using a topological
? 1093.
two-dimensional analysis of the renormalization operator?
In Gambaudo, van Strien and Tresser [1989b] it is shown that this
small codimension-one surface separates chaotic and non-chaotic maps. There-
fore we ask:
Question 7. Is it possible to characterize the boundary of the chaotic diﬀeo-
? 1094.
morphisms for diﬀeomorphisms of D as was done in the one-dimensional case
in Theorem 2.2. Has this boundary the structure of a stratiﬁed manifold?
3. Finitely many sinks
Of course a C∞map on an interval can have an inﬁnite number of attracting
ﬁxed points. However, it turns out that analytic one-dimensional maps can
have at most a ﬁnite number of periodic attractors:

§4]
Homeomorphisms of the plane
651
3.1. Theorem (Martens, de Melo and van Strien [1990]). Let f: I →I
be analytic. Then f can have at most a ﬁnite number of periodic attractors.
In this theorem is shown that all periodic attractors of high periods must
necessarily attract a critical point of f. The corresponding statement is false in
the two-dimensional case: Newhouse [1979] has shown that many (analytic)
diﬀeomorphisms on D2 have an inﬁnite number of periodic attractors.
Question 8. Give some geometric properties of the basins of these periodic 1095. ?
attractors.
Question 9. Does there exist an open set of such diﬀeomorphisms?
1096. ?
The proof of the existence of an inﬁnite number of attractors strongly uses
C2 estimates.
Question 10. Does there exist a one-parameter family of homeomorphism 1097. ?
such that for each nearby family there exist parameters for which the corre-
sponding homeomorphism has an inﬁnite number of periodic attractors?
4. Homeomorphisms of the plane
Clearly if f: R →R is a homeomorphism with periodic point then f has also
ﬁxed points. Brouwer proved that the same result also holds on the plane:
4.1. Theorem (Brouwer).
Let f: R2 →R2 be an orientation preserving
homeomorphism. If f has a periodic point then f has a ﬁxed point.
Using Thurston’s classiﬁcation theorem and Nielsen’s condition for unre-
movable ﬁxed points, J. M. Gambaudo proved the following strengthened
version of this result.
4.2. Theorem (Gambaudo [1989]). Let f: R2 →R2 be a C1 orientation
diﬀeomorphism. If f has a periodic point O then f has a ﬁxed point P which
is linked with O.
Here O are P are linked if the corresponding closed curves of the suspen-
sion-ﬂow of f on R2 × S1 are linked as knots in R3. (Another way to deﬁne
this would be to say that they are linked if one cannot ﬁnd an isotopy fµ,
µ ∈[0, 1) of f and disjoint curves Oµ and Pµ through the periodic points such
that Oµ and Pµ are periodic points of fµ and such that Pµ goes to inﬁnity as
µ →1 and such that Oµ stays bounded.)
Question 11. (Gambaudo) Can one choose P so that the linking number 1098. ?
between O and P is non-zero?

[ch. 34
5. Maps of the annulus
An old conjecture of Birkhoﬀstates that any area preserving diﬀeomorphism
f: A →A without periodic orbits is conjugate to a rotation of the annulus.
This conjecture is false for smooth maps. Indeed,
5.1. Theorem (Handel [1982], Herman [1986] and also Fokkink and
Oversteegen [1990]).
There exists a C∞diﬀeomorphism of A which is
area-preserving, has no periodic points and which is not conjugate to a rota-
tion of the circle.
Question 12. Does there exist an analytic diﬀeomorphism with these prop-
? 1099.
erties?
Question 13. Does there exist an analytic diﬀeomorphism f: A →A without
? 1100.
periodic points such that such that for some x in the interior A, the omega-
limit of x contains points of both boundary components of A?
These last two questions may well be related to the existence of C∞Den-
joy counter-examples and the non-existence of analytic examples with these
properties, see Hall [1981] and Yoccoz [1984]. More precisely, in the one-
dimensional case one shows these counter-examples cannot arise using the
distortion of cross-ratio’s, see Yoccoz [1984] and Martens, de Melo and
van Strien [1990]. Is it possible to ﬁnd a two-dimensional analogue of these
distortion results?
