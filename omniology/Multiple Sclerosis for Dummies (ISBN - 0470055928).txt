Foreword
I
t was twenty-some years ago when I first realized that my body was trying
to tell me that there was something wrong. I had no idea what was hap-
pening nor would I know what to do about it if I did.
First there were the problems with my legs, then my arms, then my balance.
With all the changing symptoms and the doctors not knowing what I had, I
thought I had contracted hypochondria. I knew I had something, but what? I
asked myself, “What is this? Does it have a name?”
When I found out I had multiple sclerosis, other than finally having a label for
my problem, I still had no idea what to do with it. It was complicated. It was
unpredictable. And there was no cure!
I was lost and had no idea which way to go.
Had I had a wonderful book as simple to navigate, yet as comprehensive as
Multiple Sclerosis For Dummies, my family and I would have saved a lot of
time and aggravation.
It took me years to realize that the most constructive way to deal with my MS
was by playing an active role as part of my health care team. While you won’t
be able to be a doctor after reading Multiple Sclerosis For Dummies, you will
be much more capable of asking your doctor the right questions, and that
makes you an effective component of your own treatment.
While getting MS is no joke, Multiple Sclerosis For Dummies offers humor as
another essential element for understanding and facing your MS. MS can take
a lot of things away from you, but it cannot take away your sense of humor.
Multiple Sclerosis For Dummies is like a global positioning system for your
condition; it’ll keep you from feeling lost.

Introduction
B
eing diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) is definitely a bummer, but
living with it doesn’t have to be. This book is all about how to live your
life with MS without making a full-time job of it. After diving in, you’ll be more
informed and more prepared no matter how your MS behaves.
If you’ve never heard of MS before and you want to know what may be in store,
this book is definitely for you. You also want to take a gander through this book
if all you’ve ever heard about MS is the bad stuff. We suggest this because the
fact is, you’ve probably met several people at work, at the gym, or in your
neighborhood, who have MS and you didn’t even know it. And, even if the
people you happen to know with MS don’t seem to have a symptom or care in
the world, you now have another good reason to keep reading: Everyone’s MS
is different and no one can predict exactly what yours will be like.
The three of us — a neurologist, a nurse, and a psychologist — have worked
with, and learned from, people with MS for over 30 years (actually it’s 82
years if you add our careers together end to end!). We wrote this book as a
team effort so we could send a loud and clear message that you’re not alone.
Health professionals trained in neurology, nursing, psychology, rehabilitation
medicine, and a variety of other disciplines, as well as voluntary organiza-
tions, such as the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, are ready to help you
every step of the way.
About This Book
Don’t worry: In this book, we’re not going to try and tell you everything there
is to know about MS. Instead, we only give you what you need in order to
make educated choices and comfortable decisions. We provide lots of infor-
mation that’s easy to access and easy to swallow regarding what happens in
MS — what kinds of symptoms it can cause, how it can affect your life at home
and at work, what you can do to feel and function up to snuff, and how you
can protect yourself and your family against the long-term unpredictability 
of the disease. We also throw in useful tips, introduce you to the members of
your healthcare team, and point you in the direction of other useful resources.
And we even promise to make you chuckle once or twice along the way.

Feel free to pick and choose what you want to read — you don’t have to take
a cover-to-cover approach if you’re more comfortable with a hop, skip, and
jump style. Each chapter tackles a different aspect of living with MS so that
you can zero in on the stuff that’s most relevant to you.
Conventions Used in This Book
We used the following conventions throughout the text to make things 
consistent and easy to understand:
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 Bold is used to highlight the action parts of numbered steps.
 Because most people with MS receive their MS-related care from a neurol-
ogist (a physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of dis-
eases of the nervous system), we use the terms neurologist, doctor, and
physician interchangeably whenever we’re referring to the person who’s
treating your MS. When we’re talking about other medical specialists —
such as internists, family practice doctors, urologists, gynecologists,
physiatrists, psychiatrists — we refer to them by their specialty titles.
 We talk about a lot of medications in this book, which you may or may not
ever need. In case you do, we always give the brand name first, because
that’s the one you’re most likely to see in advertisements or hear other
people talk about, followed by the chemical name in parentheses.
What You’re Not to Read
Even though we poured heart and soul into every page of this book, we know
that you won’t want to read it all — and most likely you won’t need to. So, we
make it easy for you to identify “skippable” material by sticking it into sidebars.
This is the stuff in the gray boxes that’s interesting and related to the topic at
hand, but not essential for your health and well-being.
Foolish Assumptions
Even though no two people have MS in exactly the same way, we assume that
you — our readers — still have quite a few things in common. We’ve written
this book with these thoughts about you in mind:
2
Multiple Sclerosis For Dummies 

 You have MS or care about someone who does.
 However much you already know about MS, you want to know more —
in language that’s easy to access and easy to understand.
 You’re looking for ways to manage your MS and the symptoms it can cause.
 You want to be healthy, active, and productive in spite of whatever 
challenges MS is throwing your way.
 You wish you had a crystal ball, but you’re willing to settle for some
helpful suggestions on how to deal with the unpredictability of MS.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into seven parts to help you gather all the information
you need about MS. However, every part can stand alone, so you don’t have
to read one before another. In fact, if you’re looking for only a few things in
particular, just check out the table of contents or the index and skip directly
to those topics. The following is a rundown of the seven parts.
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life
Whether MS has entered your life with a bang or a whimper, you need to
know what it’s all about. So, in this part, we fill you in on the basic facts as
well as the big mysteries that remain to be solved. We show you the usual
steps involved in getting a diagnosis and suggest ways to handle any reac-
tions that you may have during those early days (as well as those that may
crop up as the realities of the disease begin to sink in). This part also gives
you good ideas on how to begin making room in your life for a chronic, unpre-
dictable illness — without giving it more of your attention than it needs.
It’s always good to know that you don’t have to deal with tough stuff on your
own — so, in this part, we also spend some time introducing you to the
healthcare professionals who are going to help you manage your MS.
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS
The best way to feel more confident in the face of any new challenge is to
come up with a game plan. And you’re in luck because this part of the book is
designed to do just that. It helps you get started with the planning process
and gives you tips on how to work with your healthcare team to make the
treatment choices that best meet your needs.

Introduction

Each chapter describes a part of the MS treatment package — including all
the immediate and longer-term strategies for slowing disease activity, dealing
with pesky relapses, and managing symptoms. We talk about the importance
of early treatment and describe the available options. And, we zero in on
ways to manage the physical symptoms that can pop up along the way, as
well as the ones that can mess with your head, such as mood changes and
problems with memory and thinking.
Alternative medicine is a hot topic for people with MS, so in this part, we also
give you pointers on how to sift through the available products and services
to find those that are safe and effective for people with MS.
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well
You can be healthy with MS — in fact, the healthier you are the better you’re
going to feel. So, this part is all about how to take care of yourself with a
healthy, balanced diet, the right kind of exercise, restful sleep, and some
good stress management strategies.
Throughout the chapters of this part, we emphasize the importance of 
looking beyond your MS (or your family member’s MS) to develop an overall
wellness plan involving regular checkups by your family doctor and dentist
and the preventive health screens recommended for your age group.
In this part, we also give you an idea of what to do when your MS isn’t behav-
ing very nicely. When the disease progresses in spite of available treatments,
it’s important to know how to manage your symptoms, avoid messy compli-
cations, and keep your life on track.
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues
The key to coping well with your MS is finding ways to fit it into your life. So,
in this part, we begin with a reminder that people’s responses to your MS are
going to depend in large part on how you present it to them. We then go on 
to give you lots of strategies for helping others understand what your MS is
all about.
We also include a chapter that shows how to make MS part of the family. This
chapter describes the ways in which families are affected when someone
they love gets MS, and it also shares tips to help family members communi-
cate and problem-solve more comfortably.

Multiple Sclerosis For Dummies 

Because MS is diagnosed most often during early adulthood, when people are
busy starting or adding to their families, this part fills you in on all the good
news for prospective parents (yes, people with MS can have happy, healthy
kids!). It gives you lots of parenting tips to help you deal with those bundles
of joy that quickly grow into toddlers and teens.
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets
The hallmark of MS is its unpredictability. Because everyone’s MS is different
and no one has a crystal ball, anxiety about the future is pretty common. To
reduce that anxiety as much as possible, this part is all about making sure
that you’re armed and ready to deal with whatever comes along.
We give you tips on how to stay in the work force as long as you’re interested
and able, strategies for getting and maintaining insurance coverage, and rec-
ommendations for how to plan effectively for the unpredictable future. When
you’re living with MS, developing these kinds of safety nets can help you feel
less vulnerable and more in control.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this part, we give you some key suggestions in a handy top-ten format. One
chapter lists ten tips to live by when you have MS and another lists the mis-
taken notions about MS that you can finally put to rest. We round out this
part with ten strategies to make traveling with MS as trouble-free as possible.
Part VII: Appendixes
This is the last-but-definitely-not-least part. We start with a glossary so you
can look up any of those technical words that trip you up when you’re read-
ing about MS, attending an educational meeting, or even talking to your
doctor. Then we point you toward some important resources that you may
want to tap along the way — including other books that zero in on some of
the issues covered here, Web sites with accurate, up-to-date information, and
community agencies and organizations that you can tap for information or
assistance if the need arises.

another specialist on your healthcare team.
Where to Go from Here
This book is organized so that all you need to do is shut your eyes and point
in order to find complete information about one aspect of MS or another. If
you prefer the eyes-open method but aren’t sure where you want to start, we
recommend Part I. It gives you basic info about MS and how it’s diagnosed, as
well as some tips for sorting out all of the feelings that an MS diagnosis can
stir up. If you’ve already been there and done that, you may want to check
out specific treatment strategies in Part II, or discover ways to feel more
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed in Part III. If you’re wondering how MS may
affect your relationships with the important people in your life, you can focus
on Part IV. And if you’re someone who likes to get all your ducks in a row
from the get-go (and even if you’re not), you can check out Part V for sugges-
tions on how to feel securely prepared in spite of the unpredictability of MS.
No matter where you choose to begin, begin now. Make it your priority to
educate yourself about MS and the strategies you and your family members
can use to live well in spite of it.

Part I
When MS
Becomes Part 
of Your Life

In this part . . .
W
e’re guessing that multiple sclerosis (MS) has
become part of your life recently. Either you or
someone you care about has been diagnosed with MS and
you’re wondering what it’s all about. This part gives you
the big picture, starting with an overview of what doctors
know — and don’t know — about this chronic, unpre-
dictable disease and what you can do to live comfortably
and productively in spite of it. The good news is that you
aren’t ever alone in your efforts to overcome the chal-
lenges of MS — your healthcare team, which we introduce
to you in this part, will always be right beside you.

Chapter 1
Meeting MS Face to Face
In This Chapter
 Exploring how MS affects your body
 Determining what triggers MS
 Recognizing the uniqueness of your MS
 Taking a peek at the available MS treatments
 Understanding the impact of MS on your family and work life
 Gearing up to keep your life on track
B
ecause you’ve picked up this book, we’re assuming that your doctor has
delivered the news that you have multiple sclerosis (MS). Or, perhaps
he or she said that you may have this disease, or that you probably have 
this disease (which makes you wonder why you can’t get a clear answer).
Whether you got the news yesterday or several months ago, you’re probably
trying to figure out what it means for you, for your future, and for your family.
In other words, you have about a zillion questions about what’s in store.
Chances are, the answers you’ve received so far haven’t been all that 
satisfying — mostly because MS still can’t be cured, no one knows what
causes it, and no doctor can predict with any certainty how your MS is 
going to behave in the future. However, the good news is that the treatment
options are expanding, and people with MS are busy getting on with their
lives — and you will too.
In this chapter, which is an introduction to MS and an overview of what 
we cover in the rest of the book, we fill you in on the available MS info —
including what scientists have been able to discover about the workings of
this disease and what questions remain to be answered. We explain why your
MS is different from everyone else’s, and we introduce you to the treatment
strategies that can help you manage your MS. Finally, we glance at the ways
that MS can affect life at home and at work, and we show you what you can
do to ensure the best possible quality of life for you and the people you love.

Introducing the Roles Your Immune 
and Nervous Systems Play in MS
Surprise! Even though MS is described as the most common neurologic disor-
der diagnosed in young adults, the problem doesn’t appear to originate with
the nervous system. Instead, decades of research have pointed to the body’s
immune system as the culprit. Some kind of malfunction in the immune
system interferes with the functioning of the body’s nervous system, resulting
in the symptoms commonly associated with MS. The current thinking is that
the glitch is an autoimmune problem, which basically means that your body 
is mistakenly destroying some of its own healthy tissues and cells. But, this
thinking has yet to be proven. We explain the autoimmune process in the sec-
tion “What happens in MS” later in the chapter, but for now, it’s important to
understand how the immune system is supposed to work when it’s healthy.
The immune system: Your 
body’s frontline defender
The immune system — which is a complex network of glands, tissues, and cir-
culating cells — is your body’s frontline defense in the fight against infection
by viruses, bacteria, and other bad guys. When confronted with an infection,
the immune system gears up to neutralize the foreign invader and make you
healthy again.
In order for your immune system to do its job properly, it has to be able to
distinguish between the good guys (the cells, tissues, and organs that make
up your body) and the bad guys (any foreign invader, such as a virus or 
bacteria that doesn’t share your genes). And get this: The immune system 
is so powerful that it would reject a pregnant woman’s developing fetus
(which shares only some of her genes) if the hormones of pregnancy didn’t
suppress her immune system. (Check out Chapter 16 to read more about 
how pregnancy hormones appear to affect MS.)
The nervous system: Your body’s CEO
The nervous system, which controls all bodily functions, is made up of neu-
rons, each of which consists of a cell body and its long extension — the axon.
And each axon is covered by a protective or insulating coating called myelin.
The neurons are gathered into small- and large-sized bundles called nerves.
10
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

The system is basically divided into two parts: The central nervous system
(CNS), which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves, is the target
of the damage done in MS. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes the
branching network of nerves and axons that connects the CNS to muscles,
sensory organs, and glands in the rest of the body.
The nervous system conducts three basic kinds of electrical signals 
throughout the body:
 Motor signals: These signals, which move from the CNS, through the
PNS, and to muscles and other organs, control movement, strength, 
and other bodily functions.
 Sensory signals: These signals go back to the CNS from the eyes, ears,
skin, and other sensory organs, and they provide information about the
environment from those organs.
 Integrative signals: These signals travel from nerve cell to nerve cell
within the nervous system and are thought to be responsible for many
cognitive functions, such as thinking and memory (check out Chapter 9
for information about cognitive changes in MS).
These electrical signals are like the current in an electrical wire: When every-
thing is working fine, they travel long distances along the myelin-covered
axons in the CNS, jumping from one axon to another as needed. The myelin
(like the rubber or plastic insulation around an electrical wire), is what helps
speed the electrical signals on their journey and smoothes out any bumps
along the way.
What happens in MS
After you understand the role of the immune system and the nervous system,
you can begin to understand how MS affects them. In autoimmune diseases
like MS (and rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, and Type I diabetes,
among others), the immune system loses the ability to distinguish the good
guys from the bad guys, and so it starts attacking the normal tissues in the
body. In MS, this autoimmune response targets the myelin coating around the
axons in the CNS as well as the axons themselves.
The autoimmune attack happens because of a breakdown in the blood-brain
barrier (BBB), which allows immune cells that have been living harmlessly in
your blood to travel into your CNS to attack the myelin and axons, resulting
in the symptoms associated with MS. The autoimmune process in MS follows
these steps (see Figure 1-1):
1. The inflammation that occurs during an MS relapse (also called an attack
or exacerbation) damages the BBB, allowing the movement of immune
cells into the CNS. (Skip to Chapter 6 for more info about MS relapses.)
11
Chapter 1: Meeting MS Face to Face

2. Toxic substances are released into the CNS, which can increase 
inflammation and result in the breakdown of myelin (in a process 
called demyelination) and the axons.
3. Nervous system cells called astrocytes move into the locations where the
damage has occurred and they form scar tissue (giving rise to the name
multiple sclerosis, which means multiple scars).
The results of the autoimmune process aren’t all that pretty: The inflamma-
tion can cause swelling, which interferes with the conduction of signals in the
nervous system. The demyelination results in a loss of insulation around the
neurons’ axons, which slows or interrupts nervous system conduction. And
finally, the axons can be broken (a process referred to as axonal loss), which
breaks the connections between the nervous system and parts of the body.
(Figure 1-2 shows the steps involved in demyelination and axonal loss.) This
whole process results in the symptoms that we describe in Chapters 7, 8, and 9.
(Flip to Chapter 6 to read about the treatments that can reduce the inflamma-
tion and slow the destructive process.)

Taking advantage of the body’s 
natural healing process
The body has a natural capacity to heal some of the damage caused by MS.
For example, partial healing occurs following each MS relapse. Here’s how it
works: The inflammation that occurs during an MS relapse causes edema —
the accumulation of fluids at the site of the damaged myelin (picture what
happens when you sprain your ankle). Edema results in swelling that com-
presses the myelin-coated axons and interferes with the transmission of
nerve signals. As the inflammation and swelling disappear, and the relapse
comes to an end, some of the axons begin to decompress and are able to
function normally again. The reduction of inflammation can happen through 
a natural healing process, or can sometimes be prodded along with steroid
medications (which you can read about in Chapter 6).
In addition, the myelin coating that has been damaged by the inflammation
has some ability — but not a whole lot — to heal or regenerate. As long as
the axon itself remains intact, the natural regeneration of myelin can smooth

out the conduction of nerve impulses and result in some amount of improve-
ment of symptoms over time. Check out the National MS Society Web site at
www.nationalmssociety.org/myelin for more information on myelin
and current research efforts to stimulate this natural healing process.
After the nerve fiber itself has been damaged or severed, and scar tissue has
formed, healing is much more difficult. Unfortunately, doctors haven’t yet
found a way to repair damaged axons or to remove the scars. Researchers
are focusing a lot of attention on how to promote this kind of repair — and
this is precisely where stem cell research may be most relevant in MS. To
read about stems cells and their potential value in the treatment of MS, go to
www.nationalmssociety.org/stemcell.
Exploring Possible MS Triggers
Assuming that MS is, in fact, an autoimmune disease, it’s important to figure
out what actually triggers the immune system’s attack on the nervous system.
Most scientists agree that no single virus or bacterium causes MS all by itself.
They have also concluded that no single thing in the environment or in a
person’s diet is directly responsible for the disease.
Currently, scientists believe that the disease is caused by a combination 
of several factors — including gender, racial or ethnic, geographic, genetic,
and lifestyle factors that interact with an infectious trigger of some kind 
(for example, one or more viruses or bacteria) to stimulate the autoimmune
process. This means that when a person with a genetic susceptibility to 
MS meets up with the environmental trigger or triggers, his or her immune
system overreacts in a way that sets off the abnormal autoimmune process.
This sounds simple enough, but the question of why some people get MS and
others don’t remains one of the great mysteries of this disease. Solving this
mystery is important because identifying the factors that make some people
susceptible to MS and others not would help scientists figure out the cause of
MS. And, identifying the cause would make it a whole lot easier to find more
effective treatment and, eventually, a cure.
Gender clues
The fact that MS doesn’t occur equally in women and men has long piqued
the curiosity of scientists and physicians. It turns out that some interesting
differences exist between the sexes (in regard to MS, that is) that may pro-
vide important clues to the cause of MS:
14
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

 MS is two to three times more common in women than in men. However,
prior to the onset of puberty, boys are as likely to get MS as girls (check
out Chapter 15 for more info about MS in kids).
 Men tend to develop MS at a later age than women do, and they’re more
likely than women to be diagnosed with primary-progressive MS. (You
can read more about the disease courses in the section “Distinguishing
the four disease types” later in the chapter.)
Ethnic or racial clues
MS isn’t unique to one racial or ethnic group, but certain groups are much
more susceptible than others. Scientists are using the following clues to help
themselves understand the genetic and environmental factors that may be
causing these group differences:
 MS is most common among Caucasians of northern European ancestry.
 African-Americans and Hispanics develop MS half as often as
Caucasians.
 Asians develop MS less frequently than Caucasians and generally have
different types of symptoms.
 MS is rare (or unheard of) in pure Africans, Inuits, and some isolated pop-
ulations around the world that have never mingled with other groups.
Geographical clues
The geographical distribution of MS has been known for a long time: In 
general, the further you live from the equator, the greater your chances are 
of developing MS. Like a lot of other aspects of MS, no one knows why this 
is true, but here are some possible explanations:
 Genetic/ethnic: Residents in the temperate areas of the world (except
certain groups like the Inuits) tend to be of northern European descent.
 Climatatic/meteorologic: Residents of the tropics have greater exposure
to the sun and vitamin D, which may offer some protection against MS.
 Infectious: Certain types of infectious agents may be more common in
temperate areas of the world.
Each of these possible explanations is the subject of intensive study in the
MS research community.
15
Chapter 1: Meeting MS Face to Face

An interesting wrinkle in the geographical data — which no one can yet
explain — suggests that timing may be the key. Data, particularly from Israel
and South Africa, suggest that people who migrate from their birthplace
before puberty take on the MS risk factor of their new home, whereas people
who migrate after puberty maintain the risk level associated with their birth-
place. Just remember that these are statistical statements that characterize
large groups of people, not single people within that group. This means that
these statements provide no kind of guarantee for you or your children. So,
there’s no need to pack your bags and relocate to the tropics.
Genetic clues
MS isn’t an inherited disease. However, the evidence is quite strong that a
genetic factor contributes to a person’s risk of developing MS. The following
facts point to a genetic component:
 Approximately 20 percent of people with MS have a close or distant 
relative with MS.
 The risk for someone who has one close relative with MS is 3 to 5 per-
cent (compared to less than 1 percent in people without a relative with
MS). For a person in a multiplex family — which has several members
with MS — the risk of developing MS is even higher. Keep in mind, how-
ever, that even within the same family, close relatives can experience
very different disease courses, symptoms, and levels of disability.
 If one identical twin develops MS, the risk for the other twin is about 30
percent — proving that the disease isn’t directly inherited. Because
identical twins share identical genetic traits, the risk would be would 
be 100 percent if genetics told the whole story.
Lifestyle clues
You’ve probably asked yourself (and your doctor) a hundred times what 
you did — or didn’t do — to cause your MS. Just remember that it’s clear
from the study of geography, ethnicity, and genetics that the cause of MS —
whatever it turns out to be — isn’t anything simple or direct. You didn’t do
anything to cause MS to happen.
However, here are some intriguing findings related to lifestyle:
 Even though exposure to sunlight and vitamin D is primarily determined
by how close to the equator a person lives, it may also be related to time
spent outdoors. One study also found that people who got extra vitamin
D from a daily multivitamin were at a lower risk for MS.
16
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

 Some studies have suggested that dietary factors may play a role in
determining a person’s susceptibility to MS. For example, it has been
suggested that Inuits don’t get MS because of their fish-heavy diet.
 A few studies have suggested that smoking may increase a person’s risk
of developing MS as well as the risk for disease progression, but no one
has a clue why this may be true. So, if you’re looking for yet another
reason to quit smoking, its possible relationship to MS is a good one.
It’s difficult to separate out these lifestyle findings from other factors because
none of them happen in isolation. Genetics and geography are also operating
regardless of one’s smoking, sunning, or eating habits. So, in the meantime,
flip to Chapter 11 for more info about diet and general wellness.
Understanding Why Your MS is 
as Unique as Your Fingerprint
Here’s something to think about: If you went to a large gathering of people
with MS, chances are high that you wouldn’t meet anyone whose MS was just
like yours. MS is so variable from one person to the next that your experience
with MS will be totally unique.
Even though the cause of this variability isn’t clear, it probably has to do with
the genetic and geographic factors we talk about in the section “Exploring
Possible MS Triggers” earlier in the chapter. In addition, the inflammatory
process that damages myelin and axons can happen just about anywhere in
the central nervous system, with the random targets resulting in different
kinds of symptoms (check out the section “Scanning the possible symptoms”
later in the chapter).
Distinguishing the four disease types
A little over a decade ago, a group of MS specialists — researchers and 
clinicians — got together to develop a common language for talking about
MS. The group identified the following four disease types or courses:
 Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS): MS begins as a relapsing-remitting 
disease about 85 percent of the time. RRMS is characterized by unpre-
dictable periods of worsening (called relapses, exacerbations, or attacks)
followed by remissions. A remission may be complete, meaning that the
person returns to his or her pre-relapse level of functioning, or partial,
meaning that some of the symptoms are likely to be permanent.
17
Chapter 1: Meeting MS Face to Face

 Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS): Within about 10 years, approxi-
mately 50 percent of those who are diagnosed with RRMS transition to
SPMS, which is characterized by a steady (but not necessarily rapid)
progression of disability without any remissions. These folks generally
have fewer or no relapses as time goes on.
 Primary-progressive MS (PPMS): For about 10 percent of people, MS 
progresses right from the beginning, without any relapses or remissions.
PPMS seems to differ from RRMS and SPMS in terms of its underlying dis-
ease process — it has less inflammatory action going on in the brain and
spinal cord and more tissue degeneration and destruction early on. These
differences may be the reason that the current treatments for MS (check
them out in Chapter 6) — which mainly target the inflammation — work
much better in relapsing forms of MS than they do in PPMS.
 Progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS): A very small number of people (less
than 5 percent) are diagnosed initially with a progressive form of the dis-
ease, but then experience some relapses down the road.
Check out Figure 1-3 for a quick glance at the four disease types.

Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

Even though these categories may seem nice and neat, they really aren’t.
Within each of the groups is a tremendous variability, so don’t be surprised 
if your MS doesn’t quite fit any of the descriptions outlined here.
For example, regardless of their disease type, some folks may experience a
course that’s mild and relatively stable for many years, while others (more
often those with PPMS or severe SPMS) may have a rapidly disabling course
(see Chapter 13 for more on dealing with advanced disease). Unfortunately,
no one can predict with any certainty whose MS is going to do what, which
has led most MS specialists to conclude that early treatment with one of the
available medications (refer to Chapter 6) is the best way to hedge your bets.
Scanning the possible symptoms
MS symptoms can involve virtually any sensory or motor function that’s 
controlled by the central nervous system. This means that the list of possible
symptoms is long — including fatigue (by far the most common), visual
changes, walking problems, and tremor (Chapter 7); bladder and bowel 
problems, sexual difficulties, sensory changes, and speech and swallowing
problems (Chapter 8); and mood changes and problems with thinking and
memory (Chapter 9).
Most symptoms tend to come and go, but some may come and stay. And they
can range from mild to quite severe. The good news is that most people don’t
develop all of these symptoms, and most of the symptoms are treatable.
MS symptoms don’t show up in any particular order. Often, however, visual
changes are what bring someone to the doctor. Then, once in the doctor’s
office, it’s pretty common for someone to remember an episode of one or
more of these symptoms during high school or college that came and went
without anyone paying much mind. That’s why your doctor asks you so many
questions and takes such a careful medical history when trying to arrive at a
diagnosis. (Flip to Chapter 2 for information about the diagnostic process.)
Perusing the MS Treatment Menu
Reading about all the MS symptoms can definitely be an eye-opening experi-
ence. In fact, both your eyes and your mouth may be hanging wide open
when you do. But try not to panic. With the help of your treatment team (flip
to Chapter 4 for details), you can figure out how to manage your symptoms
and take the necessary steps to control the disease as much as possible.
19
Chapter 1: Meeting MS Face to Face

Because MS is so complex, treatment involves several different strategies, all
of which are discussed in detail in Part II. However, for now, here are snap-
shots of several steps you can take to feel and function up to snuff:
 Use disease-modifying therapy. Your doctor will discuss with you
whether you’re a candidate for treatment with one of the disease-
modifying therapies (flip to Chapter 6 for details). For example, if you
have relapsing-remitting MS or secondary-progressive MS and are having
periodic relapses, you’re probably a candidate. These medications don’t
cure MS, but they do reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. And,
they probably slow the progression of the disease to some degree.
 Manage your relapses. Relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations)
can be treated with corticosteroids if necessary. Even though the corti-
costeroids don’t have any long-term impact on the disease, they’re often
effective in reducing the inflammation and bringing the relapse to an end
more quickly. When you have a relapse, you and your doctor will decide
whether the symptoms are interfering enough with your everyday activi-
ties to warrant treatment. (Check out Chapter 6 for more on managing
your relapses.)
 Manage your symptoms. You and your healthcare team will work
together to manage your symptoms effectively (see Chapters 7, 8, and 9).
Successful symptom management relies on effective teamwork — with
you being a key player on your team. Your job is to report symptoms
promptly, follow through with the treatment plan, and provide feedback
on what treatments do and don’t work for you. And, remember, as your
symptoms change, so will the strategies you use to manage them.
 Work with the rehabilitation team: Like the mechanics that keep your
car finely tuned and road-ready, the rehab team helps you get in gear
(check out Chapter 4 for more on this team). Physical and occupational
therapists can help you do what you want to do, comfortably and safely,
and prevent yucky complications. They’re the experts when it comes to
finding the right tools to solve problems with walking, seeing, holding on
to stuff, or anything else you’re having trouble with.
 Promote your overall health and wellness. Feeling your best involves
more than just managing your MS. So, it’s important that you not focus
on your MS to the exclusion of your general health. Unfortunately, being
diagnosed with MS doesn’t protect you from the health problems that
plague all mortals. This means that you have to get the proper nutrition,
exercise, and preventive healthcare (Chapter 11) and you have to
manage the stresses of your everyday life (Chapter 12).
20
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

 Seek out emotional support. Living with MS isn’t a piece of cake. Even for
those whose symptoms remain mild and manageable, the unpredictability
alone is enough to stress people out. So, Chapter 3 shows you how to deal
with your new diagnosis and come to grips with a chronic illness. The fact
is that adjusting to this intrusion in your life — and your family’s life — is
an ongoing process that begins with your first symptoms and continues
through all the changes that MS can bring.
Fortunately, you don’t have to cope with this alone. Throughout this
book, we suggest ways to get the support you need — from your health-
care team, from the National MS Society and other organizations, and
from those close to you. Check out Part IV for suggestions on how to
communicate with others about your MS and about how to deal with the
emotional stresses that MS can cause for you and the people you love.
Recognizing How Your MS 
Affects Your Loved Ones
When you throw a pebble into a lake or stream, there’s always a ripple effect.
Getting diagnosed with MS is similar because when one person in a family is
diagnosed with MS, the entire family is affected by it. To help you adjust, we
devote Chapter 15 to making MS a part of your family. Even though the symp-
toms are yours, your loved ones share everything from the impact of those
symptoms on daily life to the financial pressures caused by MS. And like you,
each family member is going to react to all of these challenges.
Talking about the tough stuff
One of the first hurdles for family members is figuring out how to talk com-
fortably — and honestly — with one another about the intrusion of MS in
their lives. No one asked for MS, and no one likes it, so all of you are likely 
to feel sad, anxious, and maybe even a little resentful about the whole thing.
Talking about these heavy-duty feelings can be difficult, particularly when
you’re all worried about creating more upset or worry for people you love.
Family members also tend to have different ways of dealing with tough stuff.
For example, you may be a talker while your partner is the strong, silent type.
These different — and sometimes conflicting — coping styles are another
barrier to communication. So Chapter 15 offers you strategies for starting —
and continuing — the tough conversations.
21
Chapter 1: Meeting MS Face to Face

Keeping daily life on track
As you may have noticed, MS symptoms can disrupt the rhythms of daily 
life. You may find that you can’t do some things as well or as fast as you 
used to do them, and that you need to swap some chores and responsibilities
with other family members. If you and your family members are finding that
plans — especially outings and trips — are disrupted by pesky symptoms or
unexpected relapses, check out Chapter 15 for ideas on how to keep the good
times rolling, and Chapter 23 for ten traveling tips to keep in mind.
Because MS symptoms are so unpredictable, you may all need to be a lot
more flexible and creative than you have ever been before. Your goal as a
family is to make sure that MS doesn’t interfere with your plans and priorities
any more than absolutely necessary.
Maintaining healthy partnerships
Couples generally don’t know what they’re getting into with that “in sickness
and in health” line. So chances are, you’re probably learning from scratch
how to adapt your partnership to the challenges of MS. In Chapter 15, we 
provide strategies to help you keep your partnership feeling comfortable 
and balanced. And in Chapter 8, we tell you how to manage the symptoms
that can interfere with your sexual relationship. Regardless of the path your
MS takes, the goal is to maintain a healthy, mutually satisfying partnership.
If you aren’t already in a committed relationship, you’re probably in the
dating scene, which is challenging enough without MS symptoms getting in
the way. If this sounds like your situation, turn to Chapter 14 for tips on how
to talk about your MS with a prospective partner.
Becoming confident parents
When young adults are diagnosed with MS, some of the first questions they
ask are about having kids. Young women want to know how a pregnancy will
affect their MS and whether their MS will harm the baby. Men and women
both have questions about how MS will affect their ability to be good parents.
Although Chapter 16 gives you all the details about conception, pregnancy,
childbirth, and breastfeeding, here’s a sneak preview: Women and men with MS
can be terrific parents of healthy, happy children. We suggest some important
22
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

stuff to keep in mind when making your family plans — such as the unpre-
dictability of MS, the depth of your financial resources, and the strength of
your support system. And, we recommend some strategies to help you and
your partner come to the decisions that are right for both of you.
But, we don’t stop with childbirth, because that’s over in a jiffy. Chapter 17 
is full of parenting tips, including how to talk to your kids about MS, how to
keep your MS symptoms from getting in the way of quality time with your
kids, and how to keep MS from being the center of everyone’s attention.
Minimizing the Impact of 
MS on Work and Play
MS is generally a relapsing-remitting disease, which means that symptoms
come and go in an unpredictable way. So, don’t make big decisions about any
major life activities in the middle of a relapse or a particularly stressful week.
Too many people end up leaving the workforce when they’re first diagnosed
or during a subsequent relapse, only to discover a few weeks or months
down the road that they’re feeling fine — but now they’re unemployed. (If
stress is getting you down, flip to Chapter 12 for ways to manage it.)
If you’re considering leaving your job because of your MS, be sure to take
advantage of all the legal protections that are available to you before thinking
about disability retirement. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and
other statutes are in place to help you stay employed as long as you want
and are able to. Chapter 18 describes the provisions of the ADA, gives you
pointers on how and when to disclose your MS at the workplace, and walks
you through the steps for requesting accommodations from your employer.
Fun and recreation are just as important as work. Too often, people begin to
give up activities they can no longer do easily or well. Before they know it,
they’ve given up a lot of the things that make their life fun, full, and interest-
ing. We talk a lot in this book about getting comfortable with doing things dif-
ferently. After you decide that it’s okay to be creative, you’ll find a way to do
just about everything that’s important to you. People with MS swim, ski, sail,
play golf, go camping, and travel all over the world. Chapter 7 describes the
tools and strategies that can help you get around some of your symptoms,
and Chapter 23 gives you ten tips for travel.

Chapter 1: Meeting MS Face to Face

Taking Steps to Protect 
Your Quality of Life
Given the unpredictability of MS, you’re probably wondering what you can do
to safeguard your quality of life. The short answer is: You have to be a master
at thoughtful planning and decision-making. We know that most folks don’t
enjoy second-guessing the future, but the best way to ensure your comfort
and security down the road is to get all your ducks in a row now. So, check
out Chapter 19 for info on how to ensure that your insurance coverage is the
best that it can be, and Chapter 20, which gives you tips on how to plan for
an unpredictable future. In the meantime, here’s the shorthand prescription
for protecting your quality of life: Hope for the best, but plan for the worst.
You aren’t alone. Lots of people are with you on your MS path, including the
scientists who continue to look for answers, the health professionals who
want to partner with you in your care, and the voluntary health organiza-
tions, such as the National MS Society, that offer information and support. 
We offer this book as a friendly guide through the process.

Getting a Diagnosis

 Realizing why an MS diagnosis takes so long
D
iagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) is a bit like going on a treasure hunt —
you need to collect a lot of stuff in order to get the prize — or in this
case, the booby prize.
To make your treasure hunt just a bit easier, in this chapter, we discuss the
diagnostic criteria of MS, and we describe the various kinds of tests your
doctor may do to make the diagnosis and find the cause for whatever symp-
toms or problems you’re having. We also explain why the diagnostic process
can sometimes take a long time. You can believe us when we tell you that
physicians today are as eager as you are to find the right answer. Unlike the
old days when little help was available to a person with MS, now several safe
and effective treatments are available to help slow the disease and reduce the
risk of permanent neurologic damage. So, a prompt, accurate diagnosis is a
goal that you and your doctor share.
Clarifying the Diagnostic Criteria
One of the reasons that MS can be so difficult to diagnose is that neurologists
(physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of nervous system
disorders) have not yet found any specific tests that can be used to identify
it. For example, you can’t culture it like you do with strep throat, or see it on
a chest X-ray like you can with pneumonia. Instead, an MS diagnosis is a 
clinical one, which means that the doctor pieces it together from a variety 
of sources, including your past history, the symptoms you report, the results
of the neurologic examination, and whatever other tests may be needed.

So, if you go to your primary care physician with problems or symptoms that
sound like MS, he or she may recommend that you see a neurologist to help
sort out the evidence. Chapter 4 gives you tips on how to find the right neu-
rologist and other MS specialists for your healthcare team.
Before we describe exactly what’s involved in the diagnostic process, you
first have to understand what the neurologist is trying to find. In order to
make a diagnosis of MS, he or she must find evidence of dissemination in time
and space. Yes, it’s truly a mouthful, but it’s a good term to know because it’s
the basis for the long-established diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis. In
a nutshell, what this term means is:
 The diagnosis requires objective evidence of two relapses (in other words,
two episodes of demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS), which
includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves). Demyelination is the
term used to describe the damage caused to the myelin coating surround-
ing the nerve fibers. A relapse (also known as an attack, exacerbation,
episode, or flare) is defined as the sudden appearance or worsening of an
MS symptom (or symptoms) that lasts at least 24 hours (although in real-
ity, most attacks last several days or weeks).
Take a look at Chapter 1 for a description of the disease process. Also,
see the section “Identifying a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)” later in
this chapter if your doctor says that you may have MS because you’ve
experienced a single clinical episode or event caused by demyelination
in your CNS.
 The two relapses must be separated in time (by at least one month) and
in space (as evidenced by areas of inflammation or damage in different
areas of the CNS).
 There must be no other explanation for these relapses or for the symp-
toms that the person is experiencing. In other words, the physician must
rule out all other possible diseases or conditions that may be causing
the problems.
In the early days, neurologists had to rely exclusively on a person’s medical
history, current symptoms, and the results of the neurologic exam (which 
we describe in the upcoming section “Getting Familiar with the Neurologist’s
Diagnostic Tools”) to see if these criteria for an MS diagnosis had been met.
However, in 2001, the International Panel on the Diagnosis of Multiple
Sclerosis, under the leadership of W.I. McDonald, FRCP, issued a refinement 
of the criteria (referred to in the MS world as the McDonald criteria) that
described how certain kinds of laboratory tests could be used to provide
additional evidence of dissemination in time and space.
26
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

In other words, the diagnosis of MS still requires evidence of at least two
relapses that have occurred in different parts of the CNS and different points
in time, but there are now more tools at the neurologist’s disposal for collect-
ing that evidence.
In 2005, the International Panel met again to review data collected since 
2001 and to tweak the criteria. These revisions, conveniently called the 
“2005 Revisions to the McDonald Diagnostic Criteria for MS,” help enhance
the speed and accuracy of an MS diagnosis. You can take a peek at the
specifics on the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Web site at
www.nationalmssociety.org/clinicianresources.
Getting Familiar with the Neurologist’s
Diagnostic Tools
Fortunately, the MS world has moved beyond the days of the hot bath test —
when physicians used to put people in a hot bath to try and bring out MS
symptoms. They used this quick-and-dirty — okay, quick-and-clean —
method because they knew that heat tends to slow nerve conduction in
someone with MS and cause their symptoms to flare up (check out Chapter 6
for info about the effects of heat on MS).
Today, neurologists rely on a person’s medical history, the neurologic exam,
and a variety of laboratory tests to help confirm the diagnosis and rule out
other conditions. Here are some other conditions that your doctor needs to
rule out before confirming a diagnosis:
 Infections such as Lyme disease, syphilis, and HIV/AIDS
 Inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or other
causes of vasculitis
 Metabolic problems such as vitamin B12 deficiency or certain genetic
disorders
 Diseases of the spine
All these conditions and more are running through your doctor’s mind as he
or she tries to find an explanation for your symptoms.

process, go to www.nationalmssociety.org/diagnose.
27
Chapter 2: So, What Is it, Doc? Getting a Diagnosis

Medical history
The neurologist’s ability to piece together the evidence of a diagnosis is 
only as good as the information that he or she is given. So, come to the
appointment with all your medical records and test results, and be prepared
to answer a lot of questions about past and present complaints, relevant
family history, the places you’ve traveled, your use of alcohol or drugs, 
and any medications you take. This information is valuable in three ways:
 It helps the neurologist rule out other problems (for example, a virus
contracted while visiting another part of the world, neurologic problems
resulting from substance abuse, and side effects from medications).
 It lets the neurologist know whether you have any history in your family
of MS or other autoimmune diseases.
 It can indicate whether you have ever experienced any symptoms — no
matter how mild or fleeting — that may be indicative of MS. Examining
your history is one of the primary ways the neurologist has for identify-
ing past MS relapses.
For example, suppose Susie goes to her neurologist complaining of
numbness and tingling down her right side that began about a week ago.
When taking her history, the neurologist finds that Susie experienced an
episode of blurred vision when she was a teenager. The blurred vision
passed after a few days and no one gave it another thought. However, 
for the doctor, these separate events point to a diagnosis of MS.
The point is, don’t show up empty-handed for your appointment with the
neurologist. He or she can take your history and examine you, but can’t 
give you any definitive information or even know what tests to recommend
without reviewing your records, including previous test results and other
doctors’ findings.
Neurologic exam
The neurologic exam is an important tool both for diagnosing MS and for
assessing disease progression over time. It’s important to understand the
components of this examination because you’re likely to experience it many
times over the course of the disease.
During the neurologic exam, the doctor will evaluate both your symptoms
and signs of MS. Symptoms are the problems or changes you’re reporting.
Because every person experiences and describes symptoms differently,
they’re always very subjective. However, this subjectivity doesn’t make the
28
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

symptoms less important, it just means that the neurologist has to rely on
your experience of them to try and get a handle on what the problems may
be and how severe they are. Examples of symptoms include problems with
vision, walking, fatigue, bladder or bowel control, and so on.
On the other hand, signs are more measurable and objective pieces of evi-
dence that you may have never even noticed, including involuntary eye
movements, altered reflexes, or evidence of spasticity (tightness) in your legs
(check out Chapter 7 for more information about this common symptom).
The neurologic exam usually evaluates the following:
 Functioning of the cranial nerves: The neurologist will evaluate the 12
individual nerves in your head that control the senses, such as vision
and touch, and activities related to talking and swallowing.
The neurologist can check for damage in your optic nerve by test-
ing your visual acuity using an eye chart, and by looking through
an ophthalmoscope to examine the head of the optic nerve (the
optic disc). A pale optic disc may indicate earlier damage to the
nerve even if you don’t remember ever experiencing any problem
with your vision. The doctor also checks for double or blurred
vision (by evaluating your eye movements), abnormal responses 
of the pupils, and other signs of neurologic damage.
The neurologist also assesses the movements of your tongue and
throat, evaluates the strength of your facial muscles, and checks
for reduced or altered sensations in your face.
 Strength and coordination: The neurologist may evaluate your strength
by pushing on your arms and legs and asking you to resist the pressure.
You may also be asked to squeeze his or her hand as hard as you can to
determine your level of strength.
To evaluate your coordination, the neurologist may ask you to do 
the following:
• Walk down the hall so he or she can assess your speed and stability.
• Stand and move the heel of one foot up and down the opposite leg
(which is often called the heel-knee-shin test).
• Walk on your heels and then on your toes.
• Walk a tandem gait by placing the heel of one foot directly against
the toe of the other foot in alternating fashion.
• Touch his or her finger and then your nose many times rapidly
(called the finger-to-nose test), first with the eyes open and then
with them closed.
29
Chapter 2: So, What Is it, Doc? Getting a Diagnosis

 Sensation: The neurologist may evaluate your position sense by asking
you to close your eyes and describe where your hands and feet are in
space. He or she may test your vibration sense by placing a tuning fork
against various parts of your body. The doctor may also touch you softly
or use very gentle pinpricks or a cotton ball at various points on your
arms or legs to check for changes in sensitivity to touch.
 Reflexes: The neurologist may check your reflexes (at the ankle, knee,
and elbow) to see if they’re equal on both sides of your body.
Testing for the Babinski reflex (named after the French neurologist Josef
Babinski) is also important because this abnormal sign in anyone more
than one year old is always an indication of damage in the central ner-
vous system. To do this test, the doctor runs a blunt instrument down
the side of your foot from the heel to the little toe. The normal plantar
reflex to this stimulus is to curl your toes (as generally happens when-
ever a person’s foot is tickled). The abnormal (Babinski reflex) response,
which is common in MS, is for your toes to fan upward and outward.
 The presence of Lhermitte’s sign (named after Jean Lhermitte, another
French neurologist): The neurologist may ask you whether you ever expe-
rience a sudden, fleeting, electric-like shock down your body when you
bend your head forward. The presence of this neurologic sign can be
used to confirm damage in your CNS. Even though Lhermitte’s sign can
occasionally occur for other reasons, it’s generally attributable to MS.
The neurologist probably will do this kind of in-depth exam only during your
initial visit. Unless you’ve experienced a major change in your symptoms or
you’re participating in a clinical trial (research study) of some kind, he or she
will most likely do an abbreviated version of the exam during subsequent
check-ups, focusing primarily on any new problems you may have.
Various medical tests
When a patient’s medical history and neurologic exam provide evidence of
two episodes of demyelination that are separated in time and space, no other
tests are technically needed to make the MS diagnosis. However, other tests
are used to confirm the diagnosis or to help the neurologist identify a second
episode of demyelination (if it wasn’t apparent from the history or exam),
and to rule out other diseases that could be masquerading as MS. We explain
these tests in the following sections. Read on for details.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Figure 2-1 shows a conventional MRI scanner. The MRI scan is a highly-
sensitive, non-invasive way to view areas of damage in the CNS.
30
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

A contrast material called gadolinium, delivered by intravenous infusion
during the scan, is often used to highlight new or active areas of inflammation
in the CNS caused by a breakdown in the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is
the barrier that generally works to keep bad stuff from passing from your
bloodstream into your CNS. (Check out Chapter 1 for more information about
what happens in the immune system when you have MS.)
As part of the diagnostic process, most neurologists want to see an MRI scan of
your brain and spinal cord. Even though an MRI scan is a valuable tool in the
diagnostic process, it can’t, by itself, determine if a patient has MS. Normal
aging and other diseases besides MS can cause plaques (also called lesions or,
more informally, spots or scars) in the brain that look like MS. So, your doctor
has to use other tools to ensure an accurate diagnosis. Also, neurologists know
that about 5 percent of people with definite MS can have a normal-appearing
brain MRI scan, at least for awhile, which means that scanning may need to be
repeated in a few months in order to help confirm the diagnosis or rule it out.
However, the longer the brain scan remains normal, the more the MS diagnosis
would have to be called into question.
Current MRI technology allows doctors to view the CNS in different ways, and
they’ve discovered that different types of scans yield different kinds of infor-
mation. When studying your MRI images, the neurologist is looking for evi-
dence of new disease activity as well as signs of more chronic damage to the

31
Chapter 2: So, What Is it, Doc? Getting a Diagnosis

axons, which are the parts of nerve cells that carry messages from one cell to
another (these damaged axons are called black holes). He or she is also look-
ing to find the total amount of damage that has occurred, which is referred to
as lesion load. (Flip to Chapter 1 for more information about the damage that
MS can cause to the myelin and the axons in the CNS.)
Be sure to ask your neurologist to review your MRI images with you so that
he or she can explain what kinds of changes have occurred in your brain or
spinal cord and what these changes indicate about your MS. Because docs
tend to use a lot of technical jargon when they talk about MRI scans, be sure
to ask questions if you don’t understand the information you’re being given.
A conventional MRI scanner is an enclosed cylindrical magnet. The scanning
procedure requires that you lie perfectly still for several seconds to several
minutes at a time, for a minimum of 45 minutes or so. So, if you have diffi-
culty in enclosed spaces (for example, if you suffer from claustrophobia), the
physician making the referral can give you a sedating medication prior to the
scan. Alternatively, some MRI facilities offer machines with openings on the
sides. To date, however, the scans taken in open-sided machines don’t pro-
vide the same degree of clarity.
Because an MRI scanner uses strong magnets to obtain images of the body, 
it can’t be used by patients who have cardiac pacemakers or certain kinds of
metal implants. So, when scheduling the scan, the MRI office staff member will
ask whether you have any prosthetic joints, a pacemaker, any implanted ports
or infusion catheters, an intrauterine device (IUD), or any metal plates, pins, or
screws from prior surgeries. Not all metal causes a problem, so don’t assume
that you can’t have an MRI just because you’ve had a pin or screw implanted
some time in the past. The staff member will also ask if you have any body tat-
toos or tattooed eyeliner (some people with tattoos have reported swelling or
burning in the tattooed areas, and some tattoos contain metallic components
that can interfere with image quality).
At the time of the scan, the MRI technician will ask you to remove anything
that may interfere with the quality of the images of your head, such as hair-
pins, jewelry, eyeglasses, hearing aids, and removable dental work. Because
of the loud banging noise made by the scanner, the technician will offer you
ear plugs or earphones to wear during the procedure. If the gadolinium
enhancement we mentioned earlier in this section is required, he or she will
insert an intravenous needle into your vein. You’ll then be positioned com-
fortably (sort of) on a sliding table that rolls into the cylindrical tube. You’ll
be able to communicate with the technician at all times in the event that you
need assistance.
Other than the discomfort you feel from having to lie perfectly still in a con-
fined space with loud noises banging in your ears (sounds fun, huh?), the MRI
procedure is painless.
32
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

Evoked potential testing
Evoked potential tests, or EP tests, are recordings of the central nervous
system’s electrical response to the stimulation of specific nerve pathways
that are commonly affected in MS (for example, visual, auditory, and sensory
pathways).
These electrical responses are recorded from brain waves by using electrodes
taped to your head. Because demyelination results in a slowing of response
time, EPs can sometimes provide evidence of demyelination along nerve path-
ways that isn’t otherwise apparent to the neurologist from the medical history
or neurologic exam.
For example, if Susie goes to her neurologist with one symptom that’s charac-
teristic of MS, such as numbness and tingling or extreme fatigue, but she has
no evidence in her history of a prior neurologic event, the neurologist may
request EP testing to look for another area of demyelination that never
caused Susie to experience any symptoms.
Of the three types of EP tests that neurologists use (visual, auditory, and 
sensory), the visual evoked potential test is the most useful in diagnosing 
MS because 80 percent of people with the disease have slowed responses on
this test. The Revised McDonald Criteria include specifications for its use in
reaching a confirmed diagnosis of MS. So, if Susie’s visual EP is abnormal, her
neurologist has evidence of two separate areas of demyelination, helping to
confirm the MS diagnosis. But, if Susie’s EPs are all normal, the doctor needs
to continue looking for additional evidence of demyelination.
When you’re undergoing an EP test, a gel (to promote electrical conduction)
and electrodes are applied to your head and body at certain locations that
are determined by the type of response being recorded. For example, when
visual evoked responses are recorded, the electrodes are placed at the back
of your scalp over the brain areas that register visual stimuli. For other EP
tests, the electrodes are placed at different points on the head and body.
Different stimuli are delivered for each test. For example, a strobe light or
screen with a checkerboard pattern is flashed for the visual test; clicking
noises or a tone are delivered through headphones for the auditory test; 
and a mild electrical pulse is delivered at the wrist or knee for the general
sensory test. The procedure, which takes approximately 45 minutes per test,
is non-invasive and completely painless except for the slight (and we mean
slight) discomfort caused by the mild shock given for the sensory evoked
potential test.
Lumbar puncture
The lumbar puncture, or LP (also known as the spinal tap), allows your neurol-
ogist to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that bathes your spinal cord.
The doctor obtains the CSF by inserting a spinal needle into your lower spine
(see Figure 2-2).
33
Chapter 2: So, What Is it, Doc? Getting a Diagnosis

The CSF is then analyzed for evidence of an abnormal immune response in
the CNS. Specifically, the neurologist is looking for increased production of
certain immune proteins (IgG). Using a method called protein electrophoresis,
some of this IgG may show up as stripes or bands (called oligoclonal bands).
Approximately 79 to 90 percent of patients with MS have these bands, making
them an important piece of evidence in the diagnostic process.
Because other conditions can also produce oligoclonal bands and because 10
to 21 percent of people with MS can actually have normal cerebrospinal fluid
findings, the LP by itself can’t make the diagnosis. However, the findings can
help the neurologist confirm other evidence of MS. The Revised McDonald
Criteria also include specifications for the use of oligoclonal bands and ele-
vated IgG in arriving at a confirmed diagnosis of MS.
The LP, which generally isn’t high on anyone’s list of fun things to do, can be
performed in about 20 minutes in your neurologist’s office. The doctor will
inject a local anesthetic into your back. He or she will then insert a spinal
needle into the fluid-filled space that surrounds the nerves below the bottom
end of your spinal cord, withdraw a small amount of CSF (we promise that it’s
really not as awful as it sounds), and then ask you to straighten your legs.

Immediately after removing the needle, the doctor will apply pressure to the
puncture site and then ask you to lie still for about 45 minutes. This waiting
period helps minimize the risk of severe headache caused by the leakage of
CSF, which occurs following approximately 20 percent of LP procedures.
Blood tests
Even though no definite blood tests exist for MS, blood tests can positively
rule out other causes for neurologic symptoms, such as Lyme disease, 
collagen-vascular diseases, certain hereditary disorders, and HIV/AIDS.
Identifying a clinically isolated syndrome
A clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is a first clinical episode lasting at least 24
hours that is caused by demyelination in one or more sites in the CNS. It can’t
be diagnosed as MS because one episode doesn’t meet the criterion for dis-
semination in time (described in the “Clarifying the Diagnostic Criteria” sec-
tion earlier in this chapter). A person with CIS can have a single neurologic
sign or symptom (for example, an attack of optic neuritis) that’s caused by a
single lesion, or more than one sign or symptom (for example, an attack of
optic neuritis accompanied by weakness on one side) that results from
lesions in more than one site. A person who experiences a clinically isolated
syndrome may or may not go on to develop multiple sclerosis.
So, if Susie goes to the neurologist with a single attack of optic neuritis, the
doctor’s challenge is to determine what the chances are that she’s going to
experience a second demyelinating event in the future (which would fulfill
the diagnostic criteria for MS). Neurologists know from CIS studies that when
a person with CIS also has brain lesions on an MRI scan that are similar to the
those seen in MS, the patient has a high risk of a second demyelinating event,
and therefore a diagnosis of MS, within several years. They also know that
the more lesions there are, the higher the risk. However, individuals who
experience CIS with no brain lesions on an MRI scan, and normal spinal fluid,
are at relatively low risk for developing MS over the same time period. This
means that the neurologist is going to look carefully at Susie’s brain MRI —
and repeat it over time — to help figure out the next steps to take.
To date, three large studies have been carried out (and a fourth is underway)
to determine whether early treatment of CIS actually delays the second
demyelinating event, and therefore the diagnosis of MS. So far, each of the
interferon medications — Avonex (interferon beta-1a), Betaseron (interferon
beta-1b), and Rebif (interferon beta-1a) — has been shown to delay the
second demyelinating event (see Chapter 6 for more on these medications),
and Avonex and Betaseron have been FDA-approved for this use. The study
with Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) will be ongoing for some time.
35
Chapter 2: So, What Is it, Doc? Getting a Diagnosis

As with many other situations in MS, there are no right or wrong answers
when it comes to treatment of CIS. Some people are ready to begin an
injectable medication this early in the game — before the diagnosis has been
confirmed — while others aren’t. The best strategy is to review your options
thoroughly with your neurologist. (Flip to Chapter 6 for more information
about the importance of early treatment.)
Understanding Why the Road 
to Diagnosis Can Be Full 
of Twists and Turns
Given all the tests available to help confirm or rule out a diagnosis of MS,
you’re probably wondering why it sometimes takes so long for the diagnosis
to be confirmed. In the old days, before MRI technology and EP testing, a
diagnosis could sometimes take years if a person’s second relapse didn’t
occur for a long time. Fortunately, neurologists today usually arrive at
answers more quickly because the available tests are used to identify 
other areas of demyelination that never caused recognizable symptoms.
But — and this is a big but — the diagnosis still can’t be made until evidence
of a second relapse is found, separated in time and space from the first. So, 
if a person has a neurologic episode of some kind, but then doesn’t have
another one for several years, doctors have no way to make a definitive diag-
nosis (flip to the section, “Identifying a clinically isolated syndrome” earlier
in the chapter for details about this situation). Living with the possibility of
MS hanging over their heads is difficult for people. However, it’s also difficult
being told they have MS when it turns out later that they really don’t.
For this reason, getting a second opinion — preferably from an MS specialist
neurologist — is generally a good idea (see Chapter 4). Don’t worry about
offending your doctor by seeking a second opinion — a good doctor won’t
mind at all. In fact, the best docs encourage it.

You’ve Been Diagnosed — 
So What’s Next?
In This Chapter
 Dealing with your reactions to the news
 Figuring out what to do and whom to tell
 Dealing with the long-term emotions and unpredictability of MS
 Sorting through your options
N
ow that you have a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), you’re probably
trying to figure out what happens next. That’s a good question, because
one of the major challenges we talk about in this chapter is how unpredictable
MS can be. At this point, you may be experiencing one or more uncomfortable
or annoying symptoms, or the symptoms that led to your diagnosis may have
all but disappeared. Either way, you now have to deal with the fact that MS is
part of your life — and no two people deal with it exactly the same way.
So, in this chapter, we describe the most common reactions people have 
to receiving an MS diagnosis, as well the longer-term feelings that can come
into play as time goes on. We also recommend some initial steps for your MS
journey and propose strategies for dealing with the changes, challenges, and
choices that a chronic illness like MS can bring to your life.
First Things First: Sorting 
Out Your Feelings
Everyone’s initial reaction to getting an MS diagnosis is going to be different.
Whatever you’re experiencing, whether it’s shock, denial, anxiety, anger, or
even relief (or some combination of all of these), keep in mind that these
reactions are normal, and that you — and those who care about you — are
going to reexperience some variation of them whenever MS brings new 
symptoms and challenges into your life.

As tempting as it may seem, trying to ignore these feelings or keep them
under wraps will just make it more difficult for you to begin taking care of
yourself and your MS. The following sections help you recognize and deal
with these common reactions to an MS diagnosis.
Shock: “This can’t be happening”
Shock is a pretty typical first reaction. But, it generally doesn’t last all that
long because the day-to-day realities of symptoms, doctor visits, tests, treat-
ment decisions, and insurance companies tend to drive the diagnosis home
pretty quickly. If you experience this reaction, cut yourself a little slack and
recognize that you’re going through a stressful time. Take a little breathing
time. After you’ve relaxed a bit, start the process of finding out what you
need to know about MS, and then mobilize your support team (flip to 
Chapter 4 for details).
Denial: “This isn’t happening”
Denial, that uncanny ability humans have to avoid feelings and thoughts that
feel too stressful and difficult to handle, can feel wonderful. It’s what allows
people to plow ahead and live their lives in spite of whatever awful problem
is confronting them. Without some healthy denial, a person newly diagnosed
with a chronic disease like MS may just feel like giving up and giving in to
whatever the disease has in store. So, as you can imagine, we’re in favor of a
reasonable dose of denial. If you’re curious what a reasonable dose is, think
of it this way: It’s simply the amount that allows you to think about your MS
without jumping to the conclusion that all will be doom and gloom.
On the other hand, we also know that denial can get in the way. It can stop
people from educating themselves about the disease, from making thoughtful
treatment decisions, from planning effectively for a future characterized by
unpredictability, and from talking openly with loved ones about ways to 
support one another.
Because 75 to 85 percent of people are diagnosed with a relapsing-remitting
course (see Chapter 1 for a description of this course), denial can be particu-
larly tempting. For example, following an episode of heightened disease activity
and uncomfortable symptoms, a remission comes along. You feel fine — just
like your old self — and you desperately want to believe that the doctor was
wrong and that nothing is wrong with you. But, you have to remember this: The
38
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

medications currently available are most effective early in the disease. You may
not be feeling any symptoms, but the disease is active nonetheless, and perma-
nent damage to nerve cells can occur even in the earliest stages of the disease.
In fact, recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that
even the white matter in the brain that appears normal (called, appropriately
enough, normal-appearing white matter) on brain scans isn’t really normal —
the disease has begun to alter it (flip to Chapter 1 to see how MS affects the
central nervous system (which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic
nerves). So, the point at which you’re tempted to try and forget the whole
thing is the very time when medications can begin reducing disease activity
and the risk of permanent disability. In other words, act now; don’t bury your
head in the sand.
Confusion: “Why me?”
When bad things happen to you, it’s natural to want to know why. Particularly
because the cause of MS remains a mystery, people are quick to wonder if
something they did — or didn’t do — made them get MS. So, we want to
emphasize here (and again when we talk about progressive disease in Chapter
13) that there’s nothing you or anyone else did to make you get MS, and there’s
nothing you or anyone else could have done to prevent it. Unfortunately, MS is
just one of those unfair and painful things that can happen to anyone — and
for no good reason at all.
Anxiety: “What’s going to happen to me?”
The fact of the matter is that for the rest of your life you’ll be wondering what
your MS has in store for you. You’ll ask yourself and your doc: “What’s going
on with me today — and what’s likely to go on tomorrow, next month, or next
year?” The anxiety that surrounds the unpredictability of MS typically begins
long before the diagnosis — when a person begins experiencing strange
symptoms — and continues until that person develops a strategy or mindset
to deal with the unknown.
The trick seems to lie in finding a balance between taking each day as it
comes and taking steps to protect your quality of life regardless of what 
the future brings. (Check out Part V for several chapters on how to strike 
this balance.)
39
Chapter 3: You’ve Been Diagnosed — So What’s Next?

Anger: “Why can’t you fix 
what’s happening to me?”
While anger is a pretty normal reaction to a life-changing disease, the challenge
lies in figuring out where to direct that anger. Initially, you may find yourself
angry at the doctor for giving you this news, at the medical community for not
being able to cure it, or at some higher power for letting it happen. Over time,
you may also find yourself angry at the pharmaceutical companies for the
prices of their products, the insurance company for their high co-pays or lim-
ited formularies, or your town or workplace for not being more accessible for
someone with a disability. The list can get pretty long.
When all that anger doesn’t make your MS go away, it can begin to spill over
into other areas of your life — for instance, with your partner, your kids, your
colleagues, or even your most loyal friends. So, right from the get-go, it’s a
good idea to begin figuring out how to put that anger to work. Using anger
positively allows you to focus and fuel your coping strategies; it can energize
your efforts to find answers, solve problems, and overcome obstacles that
get in your way.
Relief: “Thank goodness — I thought 
it was something worse!”
For anyone not experiencing relief following an MS diagnosis, this reaction
probably seems impossible. But, for those people who thought they might
have a brain tumor, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease), or any
number of other frightening things, MS is greeted as a much better option. 
An MS diagnosis may also be a relief for people who were told to consult a
mental health specialist because their mysterious symptoms were “all in
their head.” For them, the diagnosis comes as a welcome validation of the
symptoms — either physical or cognitive — that they have been living with.
Finally they can get the support and treatment they need.
Even though a feeling of relief is comfortable in the short term, it’s important
not to let that feeling get in the way of doing what you need to do to — like
making important treatment decisions and beginning to figure out how to fit
MS into your life. (Check out Chapter 5 for ideas on how to start managing
your MS.)

Deciding on the Next Steps
Following a major change in your life, trying to figure out what to do next can
be tricky. Some people get so caught up in wanting to make the right choices
that they find it difficult to make any at all. So, here are our suggestions for
getting started.

Other important resources for people 
with a recent diagnosis
If you or someone you love has recently been
diagnosed with MS, you may be wondering “So
what do I do now?” Because emotions can kick
in quickly, whatever words the doctor said after
giving you the diagnosis may be lost in a blur.
Obviously, you’ll have opportunities to talk about
it further in follow-up visits, but it may reassure
you to know that many helpful resources are
available to help you navigate the next few
days, weeks, and months.
The National MS Society offers a variety of pub-
lications and programs:
 The best place to start is with a learn-at-
home program called Knowledge is Power
(www.nationalmssociety.org/
knowledge), which is available by mail or
online.
 The Society’s resource page for those with
a recent diagnosis is www.national
mssociety.org/newlydiagnosed.
 Webcasts are available atwww.national

all you need, but if you’re itching to read more,
you may find the following books particularly
useful as well:

Catch your breath before making 
any major changes or decisions
People diagnosed with MS may do a surprising number of things during their
first moments of shock — quit jobs, leave relationships, take to their beds,
tell the world about the diagnosis, decide never to have children, and so on.
Consider yourself forewarned: You need to give yourself time to explore the
disease and live with its ups and downs before deciding to change your life.
You may be surprised to discover that you really don’t have to change much
at all.
We have known too many people who resign from their jobs (“I’ll never be
able to do this kind of work any more”) or break off engagements (“I could
never saddle the person I love with my MS”) in the throes of an early exacer-
bation, only to find themselves jobless and bored to tears — not to mention
lonely — when the MS goes into remission. So, give yourself a chance to get
to know your MS a bit before taking any drastic steps.
Have a heart-to-heart conversation with
your neurologist about treatment
We can’t emphasize enough how important it is to consider early treatment
with one of the approved disease-modifying therapies — before significant,
irreparable damage can occur. So, broach the subject with your neurologist
as soon as possible. Your doctor can help you figure out if you’re a good can-
didate for this kind of treatment, if now is the right time to start, and which
one of the medications may be best for you (you can review all the options in
Chapter 6).
To find out more about the importance of early treatment and the role of the
disease-modifying therapies in managing your MS, check out the Disease
Management Consensus Statement from the MS specialist physicians on the
National MS Society’s Medical Advisory Board (www.nationalmssociety.
org/consensus).
Begin talking about MS with 
the people in your life
The quickest way to feel less alone with your new diagnosis is to begin talk-
ing about it with others. However, figuring out whom to tell, and when to tell
them, isn’t always easy. Some people — particularly those who have been
waiting for some time to get a diagnosis — want to rush out and tell everyone
42
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

they know that the mystery has finally been solved. Other people, however,
tend to want to keep it a secret, telling no one or as few people as possible.
The most reasonable approach is probably somewhere in the middle.
Try picturing yourself surrounded by circles of gradually increasing size.
Your best bet is to start by talking first with those in your “inner circle,” and
then gradually working your way outward on a need-to-know basis. (Chapter
14 is filled with ideas about how to talk comfortably with various people in
your life about your MS.)
Telling the most important folks first
In general, sharing information with your partner, your best friend, your 
parents — whomever you feel closest to — is the place to start. Those 
closest to you — the people who know you well enough to sense when 
something is wrong even without you telling them — can help you begin the
process of living with MS. In turn, you can help them understand what the
disease is all about.
There are no hard-and-fast rules about how to share this information with
others, but it’s helpful to keep in mind that each person’s reaction will be 
different. You need to be prepared to deal with their feelings (as well as your
own) and to provide some basic information about the disease.
Figuring out who else needs to know
Deciding who else to clue in can be tricky — mostly because spur-of-the-
moment decisions about disclosing your MS can have long-term implications,
particularly in relation to your current job and future career options (flip to
Chapter 18 for more information about disclosure on the job).
The point is that once the information is public, you can’t take it back. You
may, for example, want people to know that MS is responsible for all of the
symptoms you’re currently experiencing. But, if the disease goes into remis-
sion and your symptoms get better, you may wish you hadn’t told quite so
many people — particularly your boss or colleagues at work whose attitudes
about chronic illness or disability are likely to impact their interactions with
you over the long-term.
For more help with your disclosure decisions, we recommend the publication
“Disclosure: The Basic Facts,” which is available on the National MS Society
Web site at www.nationalmssociety.org/disclosure or by calling
(800) FIGHT-MS (800-344-4867). In the meantime, here are some pointers:
 Give yourself and those closest to you some time to get used to the idea
before trying to figure out who else needs to know.
 Before making any decisions about disclosing your MS at your work-
place, check out Chapter 18. Even though you may decide that you want
your co-workers to know what’s going on, it’s worthwhile to spend a
43
Chapter 3: You’ve Been Diagnosed — So What’s Next?

little time thinking about what you want them to know and why you
want them to know it.
 If you have children, be sure to keep them in the loop. Not only does this
help them understand what’s going on, it also ensures that they hear this
important information from you rather than from a well-meaning relative
or friend who accidentally spills the beans. (See Chapter 17 to find out
when and how to share this information with your kids.)
 If you’re currently dating, you don’t have to disclose your diagnosis the
first time you meet someone. But, don’t wait until you’re walking down
the aisle either. (Flip to Chapter 14 for tips on knowing when and how to
broach the topic with someone you’re interested in.)
Make a commitment to your health
Sometimes people get so bogged down thinking about, or dealing with, their
MS, that they forget that MS is only one aspect of their overall health and
well-being. Like filling your pantry before a snowstorm or your gas tank
before a long trip, getting and staying healthy and fit is the best possible
preparation for your MS journey.
MS doesn’t provide any magical protection against other common health
problems, so it’s just as important for you as it is for everyone else to take
good care of yourself by getting regular checkups and pursuing a healthy
lifestyle. For some ideas on how to feel your best now and into the future,
refer to Chapter 11, which is all about strategies for maintaining your health
and wellness in spite of MS, starting with getting sufficient rest and exercise,
eating a healthy diet, and managing your stress.
Facing the Longer-Term Challenges 
of a Chronic Illness
Living with MS differs from most people’s prior experiences with illness. The
first and foremost difference is that MS doesn’t go away. Most people are
used to temporary inconveniences, such as the flu, a strep throat, or a sinus
infection — all of which are pretty awful while they’re around, but mercifully
gone after a short course of treatment (or the patience to wait them out).
Until a cure is found, however, MS is here to stay. It may be quiet and well-
behaved much of the time, but it’s always there. And it’s this fact that you
may find difficult to get a handle on. Suddenly nothing is quite the same, but
you can’t tell how different it’s going to be from one day or week to the next.

Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

This unpredictability challenges people’s efforts to make decisions and plans.
In this section, we describe some of the most common reactions to these
longer-term challenges, and we suggest strategies for how to deal with them.
The how-to of healthy grieving
You may be asking “What’s grieving got to do with it? I’m still here. MS 
isn’t going to kill me. What’s to grieve?” But, believe it or not, grieving is an
important — and healthy — part of living with MS. It’s what prepares and
empowers you (and those who care about you) to identify satisfying and 
creative ways to deal with whatever changes MS brings to your life.
Even though the process of grieving is different for different people, certain
aspects of it are the same for everyone — starting with a feeling of loss.
Recognizing feelings of loss
For many people, an MS diagnosis is life’s first big kick in the teeth. Because
people are most often diagnosed in their 20s or 30s, MS may represent the
first significant threat to those powerful feelings of strength and invincibility
that motivate young adults to take on the world. This first chink in their
armor can feel like a loss of control over their destiny, and grieving over 
that loss is the first important step to managing it.
As if being diagnosed with MS isn’t hard enough on your self-esteem, the symp-
toms of the illness can also lead to significant feelings of loss. Symptoms that
appear and disappear without warning can threaten a person’s feelings of con-
fidence and control (see the upcoming section “Living with Unpredictability”).
The best way to sum up the losses is to say that the road ahead, which once
looked and felt pretty smooth and straight, now has some unpredictable
bumps and turns in it. Just remember that it’s okay to feel sad about that.
To help them feel as if they aren’t losing control, many of our patients talk
about starting each day with what they call the “MS body check.” It’s a little
bit like taking morning roll call to see who has shown up for the day. The roll
call may sound a bit like this: “How’s my left leg doing today? Hmmm, are
those fingers still a little numb? How’s the right eye — am I still seeing two of
everything when one would be quite sufficient?” The body check is their way
of sorting out what’s going on with their MS from the get-go so that they can
make their plans for the day accordingly.
A word to the wise: People express grief differently. While crying is probably
the most obvious way to express feelings of loss and sadness, anger, irritabil-
ity, and withdrawal are pretty common too. (Flip to Chapter 9, where we talk
about how to distinguish some of these normal expressions of distress and
sadness from more serious mood changes and depression.)
45
Chapter 3: You’ve Been Diagnosed — So What’s Next?

Answering the “Who am I now?” question
You spend a lifetime assembling an image of who you are. A helpful way to
think about this is to visualize one of those jigsaw puzzles made from a
favorite photograph. Since birth, you’ve gradually added pieces to your
puzzle — your personality style, sense of humor, special strengths and weak-
nesses, and tastes for this and that. But, then, when MS comes along, you
suddenly have an oddly-shaped piece that needs to be added, and it takes
some time to figure out how to make that piece fit into the whole picture. The
first step is to deal with the loss of the puzzle as you knew it. The picture you
had of yourself — your self-image — suddenly requires some tweaking. In a
sense, you need to get to know yourself all over again.
People react in a variety of ways to the task of redefining themselves. Some
people “go to pieces” initially — expressing their grief by throwing up their
hands in despair and temporarily losing sight of who they are. Others muster
their emotional defenses and try to avoid adding the new piece to their
puzzle for as long as possible. Then there are those people who gently nudge
the pieces of their puzzle this way and that in an effort to figure out just how
MS is going to fit in without jumbling the puzzle too much. All of these are
part of the grieving process.
The most comfortable outcome of this grieving process is to find that your
puzzle is still intact — to recognize that you’re still you, with all the things
that make you unique, interesting, lovable, and strong, in spite of the new
piece that you have to add. In fact, healthy grieving allows you to put the
other pieces in your puzzle to work. For example, you can use your coping
skills, creativity, and determination to figure out how to manage any changes
that MS brings to your life.
Don’t forget that the process is a continuous one: Each time a new symptom
appears or the disease alters the way you do things, the grieving happens 
all over again. You’ll be fiddling with those puzzle pieces forever. Of course,
everyone (with MS or without) goes through exactly the same process as
time, life events, and aging bring about changes. You’ll have the advantage,
however, because you’ll already know how to make the adaptive process
work for you.
In case you’re thinking that every new piece in the puzzle is going to be
unwelcome and uncomfortable, here’s the good news: When going through
the grieving process, you’ll discover strengths and talents you never knew
you had. Solving problems, meeting challenges, and figuring out creative
workarounds all add to feelings of pride, mastery, and self-esteem.
46
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

Letting go of the past and grabbing hold of the future
Healthy grieving involves letting go of the past so you can get on with the
future. From one day, month, or year to the next, your MS may alter none,
some, or many of your daily activities. When it does get in your way, you
need to be ready to go after your goals in spite of it, and the only way you’ll
be able to do that is to be ready to do things differently.
If, for whatever reason, your original goals aren’t possible any more, don’t
assume that you have no goals in your future. Instead, allow yourself to think
about different goals or perhaps a new direction. It’s natural to be sad and
angry when things don’t go as smoothly as they used to or when goals have
to be changed — that’s what grieving is all about. The next step, however, is
to put that emotional energy to use in order to map a new plan for yourself.
Living with unpredictability
Most people spend their childhood years waiting eagerly to become adults.
They’re convinced that as adults, they too will be in charge and have control
over what happens in their day-to-day lives. Of course, the average, healthy
person is never in control of as much as he or she would like to be, but add in
MS and you get a harsh reminder that life can be pretty unpredictable. In this
section, we show you how to grapple with the extra dose of unpredictability
that MS can bring to everyday life.
Addressing the “Why can’t they tell me 
what’s going to happen next?” question
Among people with MS, one of the most frequently heard questions is about
what’s going to happen next. We have had many patients say to us, “I can
handle the way things are today — if someone could just tell me that nothing
else is going to go wrong, I know that I could manage.” This same sentiment is
expressed by those with one or two mild symptoms as well as those with
many severely disabling symptoms. The point is that people generally cope
pretty well with the changes that MS brings — after a period of upset, they
figure out how to adapt and change the way they do things. The bigger chal-
lenge, however, is never knowing when they may have to adapt all over again.
The hard truth about MS is this: It may be difficult to predict from morning to
night (let alone from one week, month, or year to the next) how you’re likely
to feel. Similarly, no one can tell you with any certainty just how your MS is
likely to behave over the long term. Statistically speaking, the following fac-
tors seem to predict a better outcome:
47
Chapter 3: You’ve Been Diagnosed — So What’s Next?

 Fewer relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations) in the initial years
following the diagnosis (Check out Chapter 1 for more information about
MS relapses.)
 Longer interval between relapses
 More complete recovery from relapses
 Relapses that are primarily sensory in nature (for example, numbness,
tingling, visual changes)
 Fewer findings on the neurologic exam after five years
Unfortunately, however, no matter what predictions you receive, you have 
no guarantees. So, your optimal strategy will always be to hope for the best
while being prepared for whatever else comes along (check out Chapter 20
for strategies to help you feel prepared).
Taking control of the uncontrollable
We understand that controlling the uncontrollable sounds a bit like trying 
to organize the raindrops, but the fact is that there is a lot you can do to live
more comfortably with a chronic, unpredictable disease. For example, do the
following:
 Educate yourself: The more you know about MS, the better prepared
you’ll be to deal with whatever comes your way. Even though keeping
your head in the sand may feel like a comfortable strategy, it leaves you
uninformed and off-guard. By becoming familiar with the kinds of symp-
toms and changes that MS can cause, you’re primed to recognize and
deal with them if they happen to occur.
 Create your support network: The starting point for dealing with an
unpredictable disease like MS is to recognize that you don’t have to do 
it alone.
From the get-go, your best strategy is to identify your resources (for
example, voluntary health organizations, such as the National MS
Society and the Multiple Sclerosis Association of American, Internet
sites, and community resources) and recruit your team (family mem-
bers, friends, colleagues, other people with MS, health professionals,
and anyone else whose input you value). Over time, this network will 
be crucial to your coping efforts.
 Start treatment early: Even though doctors still don’t have a cure for
MS, several medications have been shown to slow disease progression
and reduce the number and severity of attacks (flip to Chapter 6 for
details). Early treatment can help prevent some of the irreversible
damage that’s known to occur even in the earliest stages of the disease.
48
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

 Get to know your body: Because no one else’s MS is quite like yours,
your own body’s behavior will be your very best source of information
and guidance. For example, pay attention to important cues: Does heat
make your symptoms feel worse? Or are you more sensitive to cold?
When is your energy at its peak? How do you react to stress? Are you
better able to concentrate and remember things earlier in the day or
later? Do you have side effects from any of the medications you’re
taking? Does it take you longer to do things than it used to?
And while you’re busy trying to figure out all this important information
for yourself, remember to share it with the key people in your life. No
one can read your mind, and being clued in to how your MS behaves
makes it easier for people to provide help and support when you need 
it (Chapter 14 has tips for how talk with others about your MS).
 Plan activities for the “best” part of your day: You may start the morn-
ing feeling ready to take on the world and end the day ready to take a
long vacation. After you have a pretty good idea of how your body
reacts over the course of a day, try to plan accordingly.
If you have more energy in the morning, plan to get the big stuff done
early. If a nap in the afternoon gives you an energy boost, figure out how
best to make use of that bonus. If thinking and concentrating become
more difficult as the day wears on, be sure to tackle the mind-bending
tasks first thing. (Check out Chapter 7 for strategies to manage some of
the various symptoms that can occur with MS).
 Always have a back-up plan: One day you’re loaded for bear and the
next you just feel loaded down. The best way to deal with the demon 
of unpredictability is to be prepared for it: Every big plan should have 
a back-up. Even though this extra planning may seem tiresome and
impractical, our patients tell us that it gradually becomes second nature.
For example, people get into the habit of thinking about alternatives just
in case their fatigue kicks in, their symptoms flare, or a relapse happens.
This is a particularly important strategy for parents (see Chapter 16).
 Put all that emotional energy to the best possible use: No, it isn’t fair
that you got MS. Yes, you resent that you can’t do all the things you want
to do the way you used to do them. And, yes, you’re angry about having
to deal with challenges and uncertainties that others don’t have to face.
But, remember, anger that isn’t put to good use is just a wasteful drain 
of precious energy. You’ll feel better and function better if you direct all
that energy toward your goals, taking on the challenge of MS by meeting
it one day at a time.
49
Chapter 3: You’ve Been Diagnosed — So What’s Next?

Tap that anger to do something good for yourself: Rearrange the stuff in
your kitchen to make it more accessible; call your National MS Society
chapter to find out how to advocate for the rights of people with disabil-
ities; join a self-help group in your community or start one of your own;
or talk to your boss about some accommodations that would allow you
to be more comfortable and productive on the job (see Chapter 18). In
other words, doing is better than stewing.
Making Treatment and Lifestyle 
Choices That Work for You
When we started our careers in MS more than 25 years ago, the major issue
confronting people with MS was that all of their choices were being taken
away. People were told that no treatment was available for their MS, and
“that they should quit their jobs, go to bed, and give up on any ideas of
having children. And besides all that, they were told that exercise was bad
“for them. Fortunately, those days are gone.
Today, your choices are unlimited. MS specialists are telling people with MS
to continue pursuing their dreams and doing whatever works for them. It’s
true that those of you diagnosed with MS in your teens, twenties, or thirties
will be living with this disease for decades. But, there’s no need to make a
career of MS. You have the opportunity to carve out your own path, making
the choices along the way that make the most sense for you. The goal is to
figure out how to accommodate the unpredictability of MS into the life you
want to live.
You may encounter some unexpected roadblocks along the way, and you may
have to take an unexpected detour every now and then, but you’re still the
one in the driver’s seat. The more flexible and creative you’re willing to be,
the more options you’ll have available to you.
Minimizing the stress of decision-making
Considering that options used to be sparse, having more of them is definitely
a step in the right direction. But, in our professional roles as physician, nurse,
and psychologist, we have also heard from people with MS (and their families)
how stressful choices can be. In other words, having no choices felt awful, but
having lots of choices brings its own set of challenges — particularly when the
“right” and “wrong” answers aren’t clearly marked. What’s “right” for one
person may be way off the mark for someone else.
50
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

Getting comfortable with the decision-making process and with the decisions
you end up making, is important to living comfortably with a chronic illness
like MS. So, each chapter of this book gives you the information you need to
make educated choices that feel right for you.
Here are just some of the areas in which the options for people with MS have
increased dramatically in recent years: Choosing among treatment options
(Chapter 6); managing symptoms (Chapters 7, 8, and 9); making family plan-
ning decisions (Chapter 16); and making employment decisions (Chapter 18).
Don’t be surprised when the people who care about you most — your partner,
parents, extended family members, friends, and colleagues — have lots of
opinions about what you should and shouldn’t do and about what’s best for
you. In fact, get used to the idea that you’ll likely get a lot more advice than
you actually want. As if hearing all this unwanted advice weren’t challenging
enough, the kicker is that much of that advice is likely to be conflicting or
even contradictory. Your challenge, together with your partner, is to sift
through the various opinions to find what works for you. Above all, realize
that you aren’t going to please everyone.
Getting the professional help and 
personal support you need
In addition to your loves ones, several key players can help you identify your
options and support your decision-making efforts along the way. First and
foremost on this list are MS professionals. Referrals to professionals who are
knowledgeable about MS are available from the National MS Society (800-
FIGHT-MS) or from the Consortium of MS Centers (see a listing of member cen-
ters at www.mscare.org/cmsc/index.php?option=com_peoplebook&
Itemid=500). Your personal physician may also be familiar with specialists
in the area.
Consider the following professionals:
 MS specialist neurologists and nurses: These professionals are the best
sources of information about treatment (take a look at Chapter 4 for sug-
gestions on how to put together your treatment team). It’s their job to
get to know you and your MS, and to recommend the treatment options
that will be most beneficial for you.
MS specialists can also offer helpful information about the course of
your MS and any indicators about how your MS may progress down the
road. Even though they can’t make definitive predictions, they can 
certainly tell you the factors that you need to be thinking about as you
consider your treatment and lifestyle options. If the health professionals
with whom you’re dealing aren’t willing or able to have this kind of con-
versation with you, it may be time to look around.
51
Chapter 3: You’ve Been Diagnosed — So What’s Next?

 Rehabilitation professionals (including physical and occupational
therapists): Rehabilitation professionals can help you function at your
best by doing the following:
• Evaluating your needs and making recommendations for home and
office modifications to increase accessibility and conserve energy.
• Identifying tools and adaptive devices to enhance your comfort,
productivity, and safety.
• Designing exercise programs to enhance your health, safety, and
mobility.
 Vocational counselors: These counselors are trained to help you think
through your employment options. Depending on your career path and
the kinds of MS symptoms you’re experiencing, you may want to discuss
with an employment specialist how best to safeguard your future earn-
ing power.
 Financial consultants: Financial consultants can help you plan for the
financial uncertainties of the future, such as reduced income due to 
disability-related retirement, treatment costs, and the possible need 
for long-term care of some kind.
 Mental health professionals: These professionals are a great resource
for anyone who values an objective third ear. Clinicians who are experi-
enced with chronic illness, and with MS in particular, can appreciate the
complexities of the plans and decisions you’re trying to make. Having
thoughtful and supportive input as you try to sort through your options
can be invaluable.
You can also get support from others with MS. However, self-help groups —
also called support groups — sometimes get a bad rap (one group may be all
doom-and-gloom, another has someone who monopolizes the conversation
without contributing very much, and another hangs its hat on miracle cures).
The fact is that, like everything else, some are wonderful and some aren’t.
But, when you find the right one for you, it can be the perfect place to share
ideas with other people who “get it,” brainstorm some problem-solving ideas,
learn from others’ successes, and get helpful feedback.
Every support group is different: Some are professionally led and others are
peer led; some are more social and others have a more lecture and discussion
format; some meet every week and others meet monthly; and some have a
fixed membership targeting a particular group (for example, people with MS,
partners, couples, the newly diagnosed, those people with more advanced dis-
ability, and so on) and others are open to anyone who wants to attend. It may
take some trial and error to find a group that’s just right for you, but it’s truly
worth the effort, particularly if you’re trying to sort through important deci-
sions in your life. You can call the National MS Society at (800) FIGHT-MS or
the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America at (800) 532-7667 for information
about groups in your area.

Creating Your Healthcare Team
In This Chapter
 Choosing and working with your physician
 Meeting the other key players on an MS healthcare team
 Locating an MS treatment center
Just about anyone would admit that today’s healthcare system is complex
(to say the least) and less than user-friendly — for example, figuring out
which managed care plan would actually cover your medical costs is almost
an impossible feat. You’re in an age of specialization that requires all con-
sumers to be knowledgeable, assertive, and organized about their own care.
The average, mostly healthy person, at one point or another, comes across a
healthcare challenge, but those faced with a chronic, unpredictable illness
like multiple sclerosis (MS) may find the challenge even more daunting.
To help you avoid as many healthcare challenges as possible, in this chapter,
we show you how to find and coordinate the care and support you need. A
growing community of healthcare professionals who have the expertise and
experience to help you manage your MS is readily available. Unfortunately, a
bunch of not-so-good ones (who have the best of intentions but little knowl-
edge about MS) are also ready to “help” you out. So that you don’t settle with
the latter group, we’ll show you how to scout out the best talent.
Working with Your Physician
Even though you are and will continue to be the center of your healthcare
team, your neurologist is the glue that holds the team together. Most people,
whether they’re initially diagnosed by their general practitioner or referred
to a neurologist for the assessment and diagnosis, receive their subsequent
MS care from a neurologist. Because neurologists are trained in diseases of
the nervous system, they’re the physicians best qualified to diagnose and
treat MS. Under ideal circumstances, your neurologist coordinates your care
by identifying your treatment needs and referring you to the specialists who
can best address your needs.

Finding a neurologist with 
the qualities you value
Because your relationship with your MS doctor will be a long and personal
one (you may be discussing oh-so-comfortable subjects like leaky bladders
and flagging sex lives), it’s important to find someone you feel comfortable
with. Comfort means different things to different people, but some key ele-
ments are trust, good communication, and mutual respect. The following sec-
tions discuss these elements and the other factors you want to look for.
Training and expertise
Keep in mind that not all neurologists are the same. Most general neurolo-
gists see patients with a variety of conditions, including stroke, Parkinson’s
disease, epilepsy, migraines, and perhaps MS. In other words, throughout his
or her career, a neurologist may have seen many patients with MS, or very
few. So, the fact that a physician is a board-certified neurologist doesn’t guar-
antee any particular expertise in the treatment of MS.
If you have the luxury of choosing among neurologists in your healthcare
plan and in your geographic area, one of the key bits of information you need
to obtain before making a decision is the neurologist’s experience and train-
ing in MS. As a starting point, you can contact the National MS Society at
(800) FIGHT-MS (800-344-4867) for a list of MS specialists in your area. You
can also ask your insurance company if your plan covers any MS specialists.
If you don’t have the luxury of choosing among a number of neurologists, you
may want to create a tag team — a local doctor who handles your routine
care and an MS specialist with whom you and your doctor confer periodi-
cally. The specialist, who’s likely to be more up-to-date on the latest treat-
ments and symptom management strategies, can provide recommendations
for you and your own doctor to follow. You may need to travel or pay out-of-
pocket to go to a specialist, but the peace of mind you get knowing that
you’re receiving the best care and guidance possible is well worth it. (See the
section “Knowing when to call in the MS specialist” later in the chapter for
more details.)
If your current doctor says that nothing can be done for your MS, you’re
putting your care in the wrong person’s hands. So, search out the specialists
in your area through your insurance company or the National MS Society.
Bedside manner
You know yourself best, so be honest with yourself and decide what qualities
are most important to you in a doctor. For some people, warm and fuzzy is
54
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

the key qualification — if they don’t feel comfortable and cozy in the doctor’s
office, they don’t want to be there no matter how knowledgeable the doc is.
For others, MS expertise trumps everything else, even if the doctor has the
charm of a toad. Most people try to find some combination of both. Whether
or not the neurologist is chatty or charming, you probably need to find some-
one whose personal style meshes well with your own.
Accessibility and convenience
In addition to knowledge and personality, it’s important to consider how
accessible the doctor is — in person or by telephone:
 Access to the office: Find out how accessible the neurologist’s office is.
Even if you aren’t having any mobility problems at the moment, some
time down the road, particularly during a relapse, you may need to see a
physician whose office is easy to get to and easy to get into.
It’s amazing how many doctor’s office aren’t accessible to people in
wheelchairs or scooters. Check out the accessibility ahead of time —
nothing is more frustrating than making your way to a doctor’s office
only to find that you have to park six blocks away and you can’t maneu-
ver your wheelchair over the curb.
 Communication: Find out whether the doctor is available for phone
calls. Most neurologists don’t take calls during office hours, but you
should be able to leave a message and get a return call from the doctor
or nurse within a reasonable period of time (a day or two is not unrea-
sonable). Having this kind of communication with the doctor’s office is
important because questions about symptoms and medication side
effects are common. You’ll find it comforting to know that you can count
on getting a call back when you have a question or concern.
Ability to deal with the tough stuff
It’s important to have a doctor who doesn’t shy away from difficult topics
and who works comfortably with other MS specialist clinicians. You need a
doc who is
 Ready to answer the hard-to-answer questions: As you probably know,
MS is unpredictable and knowing exactly what lies in store for you is dif-
ficult. Nevertheless, you need to be able to talk with your MS physician
about the treatment and lifestyle decisions you’re trying to make with
the expectation that he or she will take the time to respond honestly and
thoughtfully. Your decisions need to be based on the best information
your doctor can give you about your disease course. If your neurologist
doesn’t seem willing or comfortable having these kinds of conversations
with you, it’s probably time to look for another doctor.
55
Chapter 4: Creating Your Healthcare Team

Don’t stick with someone who’s a bit too glib with false assurances that
you have nothing to worry about. For example, many doctors, particu-
larly those without much experience in MS, find it difficult to deliver
painful news. They’re very quick to reassure people that their disease is
mild or that their prognosis is good, without taking the time to explain
how complex and unpredictable the disease can be. When doctors aren’t
realistic, their patients can feel betrayed if the disease suddenly worsens
down the road. So, look for a doctor you can trust to be forthright and
realistic with you about your MS.
 Comfortable with teamwork: Try to determine whether your doctor
knows when to call in the troops. The most experienced MS physicians
know that MS care involves a lot of teamwork. They recognize the
invaluable contributions made by all healthcare professionals. Some
doctors work in MS centers where the other disciplines, such as nursing,
rehabilitation, social work, and psychology, are available at a single site.
Others collaborate with these specialists around the community.
The important point is that your doctors see themselves as working 
collaboratively in an interdisciplinary framework that assures you the
kind of care you need. The doctor who feels that he or she is the only
provider you need to handle your MS care is probably not your best bet.
Establishing a pattern of routine care
After the diagnosis has been confirmed, and you and your neurologist have
decided on a course of treatment, the next step is to establish a pattern for
your routine care. Most MS specialists like to see their patients about twice 
a year — more often if the MS has been active, and less often if things are
pretty quiet or the patient is being monitored by a local neurologist closer to
home. The purpose of these visits is to monitor disease progression and make
sure that their symptoms are being adequately managed (see Chapters 7, 8,
and 9 for details on managing symptoms). During these visits, the neurologist
performs a neurologic exam to pick up on important information about your
MS that you may not be aware of (see Chapter 2). Increasingly, MS specialists
are also recommending periodic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to
help them with their treatment decisions.
If your doctor indicates that there’s no need to see you on a regular basis, or
simply leaves it up to you call if there’s a problem, he or she isn’t monitoring
your MS closely enough.
Making the most of your doctor visits
Your neurologist, of course, is trying to keep you as healthy as you can be,
but don’t forget that you have an equally important role to play. The best
56
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

neurologists often say that they’re only as good as the information they get
from their patients.
Here are some tips for making your doctor visits count:
 Bring your medical records to your first visit. Any time you’re seeing a
neurologist for the first time, it’s important to bring as much of your
medical history as possible, including MRI films, test results, and
records from your previous doctors.
 Be on time. Everyone gets frustrated when forced to wait hours on end
in a doctor’s office, but the fact is that people arriving late for appoint-
ments is one reason that doctors fall behind. They’re also trying to give
each patient the attention he or she needs, and one day it may be your
appointment that runs over the scheduled time.
 Keep track of your symptoms. There’s no need to make a career out of
this, but brief notes on your calendar about your latest ups and downs
can help you remember problems or changes that you want to mention
during your office visit.
 If you have a lot of stuff going on with your MS, prioritize the prob-
lems. Chances are that your doctor won’t want to tackle every symptom
at once because it’s generally recommended to start only one new med-
ication at a time in order to check for side effects. So, if your bladder
problems are making you crazy, don’t wait until the last minute of your
visit to mention them to your doc.
 Come prepared with a list of your questions and make sure the most
important ones are at the top of the list. Most regular visits last from 
15 to 20 minutes, and a majority of the time is usually taken up with the
neurologic exam and a review of your symptoms, medications, and any
problems you’re having with side effects.
If you need to talk in depth about a particular issue, such as sexual or
cognitive issues or anything else that may take time, you may want to
consider scheduling an extra appointment or a phone call so that nei-
ther you nor the doctor feels rushed.
 Make sure to keep your doctor informed about all the medications (over-
the-counter as well as prescription, including their dosages) and treat-
ment strategies you’re using for your MS or other conditions. In fact,
keeping a complete list in your wallet for easy reference is a good idea.
It’s important to keep your doctor informed because over-the-counter
products can contain ingredients that interact with your prescription
drugs, worsen symptoms, and affect your immune system in negative
ways. And any of the medications you take may have side effects that
individually or collectively make your MS symptoms worse. (See
Chapter 10 for more about the pros and cons of complementary and
alternative therapies.)
57
Chapter 4: Creating Your Healthcare Team

 Don’t expect your neurologist to have time to review a fistful of arti-
cles you’ve printed from the Internet. But, if you see something of par-
ticular interest or concern, it’s reasonable to ask about it. Most doctors
are happy to take a look, particularly if it’s something they’ve not heard
about before.
You can also call the National MS Society for this kind of information. The
Society’s information and referral specialists are trained to handle your
questions. You can call (800) FIGHT-MS or e-mail generalmailbox@
nmss.org with your questions.
 Don’t hold back — speak up when you’re concerned. The doctor can’t
read your mind any more than anyone else can, so don’t hesitate to talk
to your doctor about your symptoms and concerns.
 Bring an extra pair of ears (or a tape recorder). Most people aren’t at
their most relaxed state when they’re in a doctor’s office. You may be so
focused on what your next question is going to be that you forget to
listen to what the doctor is saying. You may be so worried about what
the doctor is going to say that you don’t remember the answer all that
accurately. Or, you may have some memory issues that make it difficult
to remember what the doctor says.
To head off any forgetfulness or worry, you may want to bring a tape
recorder to the appointment so that you can listen to it again later. Some
people also like bringing a relative or friend along to listen. If neither of
these options is possible for you, it’s also okay to ask your neurologist
to write down the key points, particularly relating to a new prescription
or other treatment issues. In many MS centers, you’ll find that informa-
tion is routinely given in written form as well as oral.
Knowing when to call in the MS specialist
If no MS specialist is available in your insurance plan or in your geographic
area, you may be relying on your family doctor or a general neurologist for
your routine care. However, sometimes you do need to contact a specialist.
Here are some of the times when you may want to connect with a specialist:
 When you need to know your options: Several treatment options are now
available for MS (flip to Chapter 6), so if the doctor you’re currently seeing
is only comfortable prescribing one or two of these medications, it may
be worth your while to consult with someone — at least initially — about
what all your options are.
 When your doctor doesn’t have MS experience: If the doctor you’re
currently seeing has had limited experience with MS, it’s a good idea to
schedule a yearly appointment with a specialist — even if you have to
travel or pay out-of-pocket to do so. This yearly appointment ensures
that you’re getting the most up-to-date information.
58
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

MS specialists are used to providing these kinds of consultations to
people from all over the world, and they’ll happily write a letter to your
own doctor to convey findings and recommendations. Many family doc-
tors and general neurologists welcome this kind of input, particularly if
their experience with MS is limited. If you’re seeing a physician who
makes you feel uncomfortable about going to see a specialist, you may
want to consider working with another physician.
 When your MS escalates and interferes with your life: Because every-
one’s MS is so different, very little about MS care is “routine.” If your MS
progresses significantly in spite of treatment, your symptoms begin inter-
fering in a major way with your everyday activities, or you’re having
troublesome side effects with your medications, a consultation with a
specialist may be well worth your while. They’ve seen so many people
with MS that they’re more likely to have seen a patient whose situation
is similar to yours than a doctor who has seen very few MS patients.
 When your doctor doesn’t routinely involve other specialties in your
care: In this case, a consultation with a specialist will help you identify
ways in which nursing, rehabilitation, social work, mental health profes-
sionals, and many others may be of assistance to you.
Getting a second opinion
Even those people who are seeing an MS specialist sometimes feel the need
to get a second opinion. And MS specialists would be the first to acknowledge
how much of MS care is a combination of art and science. Given how many
unanswered questions there are about MS, and the fact that none of the avail-
able treatments is completely effective in controlling the disease, doctors
have differing opinions on how to handle just about every aspect of care.
59
Chapter 4: Creating Your Healthcare Team
MD to MD: Sharing valuable resources
Your doctor has an important MS resource 
that he or she may not even know about. The
National MS Society offers a program called
MD-on-Call, which allows any physician to
obtain a free consultation from an MS special-
ist on the Society’s Medical Advisory Board. 
All your physician needs to do is call (866) 
MS-TREAT (866-678-7328) or send an e-mail 
to MD_info@nmss.org. Your physician can
also request a literature search, articles from
the Society’s medical library, information about
insurance, and guidance on how to set up an
MS specialty center. If you think it may be diffi-
cult or uncomfortable to suggest this resource
to your doctor, you can get a brochure describ-
ing the service for your doc by calling (800)
FIGHT-MS (800-344-4867). You can then offer it
to your doctor in case he or she hasn’t heard
about it.

Second opinions are particularly valuable in complex situations where the
standard care or initial plan of attack isn’t working as well as you expect. For
example, if your MS hasn’t responded adequately to any of the approved dis-
ease-modifying therapies, you may need to be given a combination of medica-
tions. Or, if your symptoms haven’t been well-controlled with the first-line
strategies, you may need to try something different. The second opinion may
offer some useful insights or new ideas.
So, if you decide to go after another opinion, you can ask your neurologist for
the names of colleagues he or she respects highly, or you can contact the
National MS Society (800-FIGHT-MS) for additional recommendations.
The challenge for you, of course, is what to do with two different opinions.
Ultimately, you need to rely on someone’s expertise. You may take the second
opinion back to your own doctor and let him or her decide whether it’s a rea-
sonable one to pursue. Or you may decide that you want to stay with the
second doctor. Some people have pursued third opinions to decide which
option is best (think game-winning tie-breaker).
Rounding Up Other Key Players
In this section, we talk about the other professionals who may become
involved in helping you manage life with MS. If you’re fortunate to have
access to a comprehensive MS center, you may find many of these specialists
all in one place. Otherwise, you’ll need to round them up on your own.
As you read the following sections, you may wonder how you could ever 
possibly need all of these people on your healthcare team. Chances are you
won’t. Most people with MS experience only a few of the possible symptoms.
But, some people face a lot more, so it’s important for them to know who’s
out there and ready to help. The professionals described here have the
expertise to handle whatever gets thrown your way.
The nurse for education, 
guidance, and support
Over the past several years, nurses have taken on a key role in MS care, and
you’ll find that many MS doctors are fortunate enough to have a nurse on
staff. Nurses are involved in:
 Providing education to MS patients and their families
 Helping patients implement the doctor’s treatment recommendations —
particularly in relation to disease-modifying therapies and symptom
management
60
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

 Responding to patients’ questions and concerns
 Coordinating clinical trials for new drug treatments
Given the limited amount of time that most doctors have to spend with their
patients these days, the nurse’s role is particularly important in ensuring the
comprehensiveness of your care. The nurse may be the one who responds to
your phone calls, renews your prescriptions, trains you in self-injection tech-
niques, helps you manage your side effects, and connects you with the spe-
cialists involved in your care. The nurse can be a tremendous ally and
support person — in other words, he or she is your new best friend.
The rehabilitation specialists 
to help you keep on truckin’
Rehabilitation promotes a person’s independence, safety, and overall quality
of life. It’s a personalized, interactive process designed to help each person
maintain the highest possible level of function, given whatever impairments
the MS may have caused. Each of the rehab specialists described in this sec-
tion contributes something unique to MS care. Unfortunately, insurance cov-
erage for these services varies greatly from one insurance plan to another, so
you’ll have to look carefully into your coverage to determine which services
may be covered for you, and for how many visits.
Your physician — usually your neurologist or a physiatrist (a specialist in
physical medicine and rehabilitation) — functions as the rehabilitation team
leader. As needs are identified (preferably as early in the disease as possible
before crises have a chance to develop), the physician refers you to the
appropriate specialist. These early interventions, which introduce you to
energy management strategies, an exercise regimen, and ways to feel and
function at your best, help you to be an active partner in your own care.
61
Chapter 4: Creating Your Healthcare Team
Rehabilitation recommendations 
for people with MS
The National MS Society’s Medical Advisory
Board recently developed a consensus state-
ment concerning the role of rehabilitation in 
MS care. The paper, which is called “Reha-
bilitation: Recommendations for Persons with
Multiple Sclerosis,” is available online at
www.nationalmssociety.org/expert
opinionpapers. It was written to provide
guidance to physicians, nurses, therapists,
insurers, policy makers, as well as people with
MS, concerning the optimal use of physical
rehabilitation strategies in MS care. This docu-
ment is important to read and share with your
healthcare providers because it can be used to
guide treatment and demonstrate the importance
of rehabilitation to your insurance company.

All of the following professionals work with you to ensure that your needs 
are met.
Urologist
A urologist takes care of your urinary system, and if you’re male, he or she
takes care of your sexual organs as well. Because urinary symptoms are so
common in MS, you may get to know your urologist pretty well over the
years. (Check out Chapter 8 for info about bladder and sexual symptoms.)
Physical therapist
The physical therapist’s (PT’s) role is to evaluate and improve your strength,
mobility, balance, and posture, and to provide fatigue and pain management.
PTs evaluate your abilities and then use this information, along with the infor-
mation you provide about your needs and priorities, to develop a treatment
plan. The plan involves exercises to address your physical symptoms — fatigue,
weakness, stiffness, impaired balance — as well as training in the use of the
most appropriate mobility aids. In other words, they help you create the tool
chest we talk about in Chapter 7 — and, they’re the world’s best cheerleaders.
Occupational therapist
An occupational therapist (OT) helps you maintain the everyday skills that are
essential to your activities at home and at work. OTs are among the most cre-
ative people on earth — they know a tool or workaround for any activity you
can imagine. OTs know all the helpful gadgets, from easy-to-hold cooking
utensils to pre-tied elastic shoelaces that save you from having to tie your
shoes when your fingers are numb or tingly.
When an OT works with you, he or she will help in four main areas:
 Strength and coordination of your upper body
 The use of assistive technology to enhance your independence and pro-
ductivity at home and at work
 Fatigue management, with strategies to conserve your energy, simplify
and expedite tasks, and manage your stress
 The use of compensatory strategies to deal with any problems you may
have with thinking, sensation, or vision
OTs can evaluate your home space and work space, and then recommend
ways to make those environments work comfortably for you.
Speech/language pathologist
Speech/language pathologists (S/LPs) evaluate and treat speech and swallow-
ing problems that can be caused by impaired muscle control in the lips,
62
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

tongue, soft palate, vocal cords, and diaphragm. So, the goals of treatment
are to help you communicate effectively, and to address any swallowing diffi-
culties that may be affecting your health, comfort, and safety. S/LPs also 
evaluate and treat problems with memory, organization, and planning and
problem-solving.
Vocational rehabilitation counselor
Vocational rehab counselors (also referred to as employment or career coun-
selors) help people determine their work options. For example, by using infor-
mation from other members of the rehabilitation team about your physical,
cognitive, and emotional challenges, the counselor can make recommenda-
tions about disclosure, job accommodations, additional skills training, and
retraining for alternative careers. While some rehab counselors work privately,
others work in rehabilitation facilities and in state vocational rehabilitation
offices.
The mental health specialists to help 
you keep your head on straight
When most people hear the words “mental health specialists” they usually
think of only psychologists and psychiatrists. But, in fact, there are a variety
of specialists in the mental health field. No matter what emotional challenges
you’re having, you’re sure to find just the right professional to guide you.
In case you’re thinking “I’m not crazy! I don’t need any help from these kinds
of doctors!” we’d just like to point out that these specialists come in handy
even if you’re healthy, happy, and sane. The mental health professionals who
work in MS are used to working with healthy patients — those who were
doing fine until the disease came along but then needed some education,
coping strategies, emotional support, and problem-solving tools for dealing
with this new challenge in their lives. In fact, your friendly mental health pro-
fessional can be a lot like your accountant or lawyer — someone you call
when you have a problem to solve or an issue to discuss. The good thing
about this type of setup is that in the event that you do begin to experience
any of the emotional changes that MS can cause (see Chapter 9), your mental
health professional can offer the treatment and referrals you need.
Fortunately, most insurance plans cover at least some outpatient mental ser-
vices, but typically not at the same level that they cover medical services.
Check with your insurance plan to see what types of mental health services it
will cover and for how long.
63
Chapter 4: Creating Your Healthcare Team

Psychiatrist
Psychiatrists are physicians with a mental health focus. They diagnose and treat
emotional changes (refer to Chapter 9 for details on handling MS-specific
mood and emotional changes). In most states, psychiatrists are the only pro-
fessionals in the mental health group that can prescribe medications. If a
person who’s being treated by a psychologist, social worker, counselor, or
other psychotherapist needs medication to stabilize his or her mental health,
the therapist will refer that person to a psychiatrist.
Clinical psychologist
Even though some clinical psychologists do neuropsychological testing and
cognitive remediation, their primary work in the clinical setting involves indi-
vidual, group, and family counseling to help people sort out challenging
issues or relationships in their personal and professional lives.
Social workers
Social workers, depending on their licensure and area of interest, wear two
hats: They offer individual, group, and family counseling in a variety of set-
tings, and some also have special expertise in case management. When wear-
ing their case management hat, social workers help people identify and
coordinate the community resources they need.
Counselors and marriage and family therapists
Like psychologists and social workers, counselors and marriage and family
therapists provide counseling in a variety of settings. These professionals can
help family members deal with the impact that a chronic illness like MS can
have on family life.
Even though their training and licensure vary considerably, all of these
mental health professionals can provide invaluable support for your efforts
to live comfortably with MS. Your local chapter of the National MS Society
can refer you to therapists who are familiar with MS and the impact it can
have on individuals and families who are living with its challenges. (Check
out Chapter 15 for more information on making MS a part of your family).
Neuropsychologist
A neuropsychologist is a psychologist with special training and expertise in
brain-behavior relationships. Clinical neuropsychologists assess, diagnose,
and treat cognitive symptoms in people with MS. They evaluate a person’s
cognitive strengths and deficits and use this information, along with informa-
tion provided by other healthcare providers, to plan and implement treatment
strategies. Most insurance plans offer some coverage for cognitive evalua-
tion, but coverage for the treatment of cognitive problems is spotty at best,
so check it out carefully with your insurance plan.
64
Part I: When MS Becomes Part of Your Life 

The general medical doctors
Your family doctor, dentist, and — if you’re female — the gynecologist are
also key players in helping you take care of yourself. Chapter 11 is all about
how to be healthy with MS. The main thing to remember is that having MS
isn’t a reason to neglect other aspects of your care.
Considering Comprehensive 
MS Treatment Centers
Beginning in the late ’70s, experts in the MS field recognized the potential
impact of MS on a person’s physical, emotional, cognitive, social, and voca-
tional well-being. They realized that a team approach was needed to provide
the necessary care and support to individuals and families living with MS
(think “it takes a village . . .”). Their idea was for each person with MS to be
seen by a team of professionals who work collaboratively in a single place
(think of it as one-stop shopping). Patients benefit from receiving coordi-
nated, comprehensive care without having to find each of these specialists
independently. Clinicians benefit because they can pool their expertise and
support each other’s efforts to provide optimal care.
Currently, you can find quite a few MS specialty centers around the country,
each offering some variation on this ideal arrangement. You can find a list of
National MS Society-affiliated clinics (by state) at www.nationalmssociety.
org/clinics. In addition, the Consortium of MS Centers (CMSC), an organi-
zation for health professionals involved in MS care, lists its member centers
at www.mscare.org/cmsc/index.php?option=com_peoplebook&
Itemid=500.
Even though many good MS centers exist, there certainly aren’t enough. So,
the reality is that you may need to create your own team. Your primary care
physician may be willing to be your team manager, particularly if you have
other health issues besides your MS. If not, your neurologist may be willing
to take the job. Otherwise, it’s up to you.
Putting your team together can be a challenge for even the savviest of con-
sumers, so here are some strategies to keeping in mind:
 Get referrals (from your physician or the National MS Society) to profes-
sionals with experience and expertise in MS.
 Keep copies of all your medical records (you can request photocopies
from your doctor’s office, usually for a fee), and store your own MRI
65
Chapter 4: Creating Your Healthcare Team

scans. No one will care about your MRI scans as much as you do, and
they’ll come in handy for your neurologist to make comparisons over
time (or for you to take with you if you decide to change doctors or get a
second opinion).
 Keep the members of your team in the loop by asking each clinician to
copy the other key players on letters and reports.
 Make sure that each clinician is aware of your medical history — 
including your MS and any other conditions you’re dealing with — and
that he or she has a list of all the medications you’re taking.
If, at any point, it all starts to feel unmanageable — if, for example, you’re expe-
riencing a lot of complications with your MS or have been unlucky enough to
be diagnosed with more than one illness that requires complex care — you
can contact the National MS Society for information about the care manage-
ment services available in your area. Care managers are professionals who
are trained to help coordinate your care and identify helpful community
resources.

Part II
Taking Charge 
of Your MS

In this part . . .
M
ultiple sclerosis (MS) can’t be cured yet, so the
goal instead is to manage it comfortably. So, this
part is all about working with your healthcare team to
minimize the impact of the disease on your everyday life.
We begin by mapping out all the strategies that go into
treating a chronic illness, and then start you on the road
to developing your own treatment plan. We also give you
tons of tips on dealing with each of the specific symptoms
that MS can cause.

Chapter 5
Developing Your Management
Plan to Take Charge of Your MS
In This Chapter
 Making the best use of available MS treatment strategies
 Getting used to the idea of doing things differently
 Planning your treatment with a treatment template
A
s with many other situations in life, attitude is key when starting life
with multiple sclerosis (MS). Feisty, determined, and stubborn are all
good qualities to bring to the table. But, it’s also important to make sure that
you’re fighting the right battles. Because MS can’t be cured yet, winning the
war against it isn’t possible. So, setting out to “beat this thing” can be a setup
for feelings of failure if the disease progresses in spite of your best efforts.
Here’s what we recommend instead: Decide, beginning today, that you’re
going to take charge of your MS by meeting each of the smaller battles head
on. We help you get started by outlining in this chapter the various treatment
strategies recommended by MS specialists. Then we show you how to set
realistic goals for your care and give you a handy template for designing and
implementing your treatment strategies.
It’s important to work closely with your neurologist and the other clinicians
on your healthcare team to design and implement the plan that best meets
your needs. The information in this chapter will help you do just that.
Using Multiple Strategies to Manage MS
It wasn’t very long ago that treatment options for people with MS were nonex-
istent. Patients diagnosed with MS were told to just go home and learn to live
with it. Our mentor, Dr. Labe Scheinberg — acknowledged by many to be the

father of comprehensive MS care — referred to that unfortunate time as the
“diagnose and adios” era of MS treatment. Fortunately, the world of MS care
has come a long way since then. Today, management strategies for MS fall
into five main categories (sort of like an a la carte menu), which we discuss in
the following sections. As you and your healthcare team work to manage
your MS, you’ll be using some or all of these strategies.
Modifying the disease course
Even though doctors still don’t know how to cure MS, they now have several
medications that have been shown to reduce disease activity (turn to
Chapter 6 for more details). These medications help control the disease by:
 Reducing the number, frequency, and severity of acute relapses (which
are also called attacks or exacerbations)
 Reducing the number of new brain lesions as shown on magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI)
 Possibly reducing or delaying future disability
The National MS Society’s Disease Management Consensus Statement (www.
nationalmssociety.org/consensus), which reflects the opinions of the
nationally recognized experts on the Society’s Medical Advisory Board, makes
the following recommendations about early treatment with a disease-modifying
therapy:
 Treatment with one of the disease-modifying therapies should be consid-
ered as soon as possible following a diagnosis of MS with active disease
(for example, recent relapses or new lesions on MRI). Treatment may
also be considered for some patients with a first attack who are at high
risk of developing MS (this situation is known as clinically isolated syn-
drome, which is discussed in Chapter 2).
 Treatment should be continued unless the person is no longer benefiting
from it, the side effects are intolerable, or a better treatment becomes
available.
Managing acute relapses
Even though the disease-modifying therapies have been shown to reduce the
number of relapses, they don’t stop them completely. Because some relapses
will still occur, managing them is an important aspect of MS care (see Chapter 6).
When you have a relapse, you and your doctor can decide whether to treat it
(usually with high-dose corticosteroids) or let it resolve itself.
70
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

Depending on the kinds of symptoms you experience during a relapse and
the number of symptoms that remain after the relapse is over, you may also
be referred for rehabilitation to help speed your recovery. Take a look at the
section “Enhancing function through rehabilitation” later in this chapter for
more information on the rehab team and the services it can provide.
Taking charge of your symptoms
Symptom management is a key element of MS care (check out Chapters 7, 8,
and 9 for details). The process begins with your first visit to the MS doctor’s
office and continues for the rest of your life. Because MS doesn’t significantly
alter your life span, you and your doctor will be working together over the
long haul to manage whatever symptoms you experience.
In order to manage your symptoms effectively, both you and your doctor have
certain duties to fulfill: Your job is to keep the doctor informed of the symp-
toms and changes you experience, follow the treatment regimen he or she
recommends, and report back on the outcome. Your doctor’s job is to listen
to the information you provide, suggest management strategies, and tweak
those recommendations based on your feedback. Take a look at Chapter 4 for
more information on how to work effectively with your physician.
Enhancing function through rehabilitation
Rehabilitation is a branch of medicine that focuses on a person’s ability to func-
tion. The job of rehabilitation specialists, including physiatrists, physical thera-
pists (PTs), occupational therapists (OTs), and speech/language pathologists
(S/LPs), is to help you maintain the highest possible level of function, comfort,
and safety, given whatever impairments MS may cause (see Chapter 4 for more
info on the work of your rehab team). Beginning at the time of diagnosis, these
specialists can help you manage your energy supply, identify strategies to
help you function optimally at home and at work, and develop a personalized
exercise regimen that’s suited to your abilities and limitations.
Over the course of the disease, the rehab folks are the creative problem-solvers.
They’re the ones who help you identify the strategies and tools you need to
keep doing the things that are important to you. Their ingenuity and know-how,
combined with your determination and willingness to try new and different
approaches to your daily activities, makes for a dynamic duo (take a look at
the section “Tapping Your Creativity and Flexibility” later in the chapter for
more on getting creative with your approaches).
71
Chapter 5: Developing Your Management Plan to Take Charge of Your MS

Providing psychosocial support
Living with a chronic illness isn’t anybody’s idea of fun. And some days, your
MS may ask more of you than you have to give. Fortunately, you don’t have to
go it alone. You have access to lots of support services — in your community,
from the National MS Society (www.nationalmssociety.org) and other
MS organizations, and from mental health professionals who specialize in
helping individuals and families adapt to life with a chronic illness. (Check
out Appendix B to discover some of these resources.)
The biggest roadblock in getting these services will be your own attitudes
toward them. If you consider reaching out for support a sign of weakness,
you’ll be depriving yourself of valuable partnerships. If, on the other hand,
you see support services as one more tool you can use to manage MS, you’ll
feel more prepared to handle whatever comes your way.
The psychotherapists who specialize in chronic illness see themselves as
consultants or coaches who can help you chart your course (see Chapter 4
to find out more about the members of your healthcare team). You may, for
example, want to talk about your new diagnosis and plan your next steps in
an environment that’s less nerve-racking than the doctor’s office. Then, you
may go back some time later to talk about changing symptoms, employment
issues, or parenting challenges. And further down the road, you may go again
to talk about retirement or long-term care options. Sometimes it just helps to
have a place to deal with feelings and brainstorm some strategies.
If necessary, the mental health professionals are also available to help you with
the mood and cognitive changes that are so common in MS (flip to Chapter 9).
Psychotherapists work with you to identify and manage any mood changes
you’re experiencing, and they can refer you to a psychiatrist if further evalua-
tion or medication is needed. Neuropsychologists evaluate and treat cognitive
changes.
Taking care of your health
All of the MS treatment strategies in the world won’t do you a bit of good if
you neglect your overall health. We think this is so important that we devote
Part III of this book to guidance on how to be healthy and feel well.
A word to the wise: MS can take up so much of your attention and your doctor’s
that other important aspects of your health are neglected. The tendency will
be for you and others to attribute everything to your MS even though other
things can happen as well. MS doesn’t provide any protection from cancer,
heart disease, or stroke (which are the primary causes of death for people
72
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

with and without MS). Your best bet is to rely on your MS healthcare team for
your MS care, but also to maintain an ongoing relationship with your family
doctor, your optometrist, and your dentist (and gynecologist if you’re a
woman) for full tune-ups on a regular basis.
And remember that inactivity caused by MS fatigue and mobility problems
can lead to weight gain. Those extra pounds aren’t good for anyone’s overall
health, and they tend to increase the fatigue and make it even more difficult
for you to get around. To avoid that vicious cycle, talk to your doctor or a
nutritionist about a healthy diet that’s right for you.
It’s a good idea to sort out early on who’s going to oversee your healthcare.
In the good old days, the family doctor took on that role — checking you over
from head to toe, making referrals to specialists when needed, and generally
ensuring that the right hand knew what the left was doing. In today’s system,
however, healthcare is much more specialized and fragmented. So, you need
to find out who’s handling the job for you — your neurologist, your family
doctor, or even you. If you find the responsibility seems to be all yours, the
National MS Society can point you to community resources that may be able
to help with the process. Contact the Society by calling (800) FIGHT-MS
(800-344-4867).
Tapping Your Creativity and Flexibility
Even with optimal use of the available treatment strategies, there’s still no
magic bullet. MS is a chronic disease that’s likely to progress over time, and
most people can expect to experience at least some change in their physical
or cognitive abilities (or both). So you may be called upon to learn how to do
things differently than you did in the past. Not too surprisingly, this task of
relearning is a huge hurdle for some folks — particularly for those who feel
that things that have to be done differently just aren’t worth doing any more.
Grieving, which is a normal (and healthy) process that people go through
when they need to let go of someone or something, is an essential part of
living well with MS. When you grieve, you’re letting go of “the way things
were” in order to think about “the ways things can be.” (See Chapter 3 for
more on the role of grieving in MS.)
The possibilities are limitless after you’re able to wrap your head around the
idea of doing things differently. The world of assistive technology (AT) offers
tools and gadgets to help you manage virtually every aspect of daily life. Pay
a visit to www.abledata.com, which provides information about AT, or go to
an abilities fair in your area to get an idea of the range of stuff that’s available.

Your rehab specialists will be your “lifeguards,” making sure that you find the
right tools and learn how to use them safely and effectively. (Refer to
Chapters 7 and 9 for more on how AT can help you keep doing the things that
are important to you.)
Creating Your Own Treatment Template
Given all the treatment strategies you’re likely to need over the course of
your MS, you’re probably wondering how to figure out what to do and when
you should do it. Of course, your neurologist will likely be guiding you — but
we thought a treatment template would be useful to help you:
 Think about the types of treatment you need
 Identify the professionals who are most qualified to provide your treat-
ment (Check out Chapter 4 for a description of the professionals
involved in MS care.)
 Facilitate conversations with your doctor and other healthcare
providers
The following steps will help you use the template most effectively:
1. Identify the problem you’re trying to solve.
For example, deciding to start a disease-modifying therapy, learning to
self-inject, identifying helpful job accommodations, choosing a mobility
aid to help with balance problems, figuring out how to manage your
fatigue, or finding out how to talk to your kids about MS.
2. Determine which kind of intervention(s) you think you need.
For example, disease management, relapse management, symptom man-
agement, rehabilitation, or psychosocial support.
3. Identify the appropriate health professional.
For example, a neurologist, an MS nurse, a rehabilitation specialist, a
mental health professional, a family doctor, or another specialist.
The treatment template can provide a kind of roadmap as you look for solutions
to the challenges you encounter. Your access to the treatment interventions
described in this chapter depends on the availability of MS specialists in your
area and the kind of health insurance coverage you have. It’s a good idea 
to check over your insurance policy carefully to see exactly what kinds of
treatments and services are and aren’t covered. The National MS Society
(800-FIGHT-MS) can refer you to local MS specialists.

Chapter 6
Managing the Disease Course and
Treating Relapses
In This Chapter
 Becoming familiar with the disease-modifying therapies
 Recognizing and treating MS relapses
 Seeing MS treatment as the art it is
Just because there’s no cure for multiple sclerosis (MS) doesn’t mean that
there’s no treatment for it. In fact, a variety of treatment strategies have
been shown to make MS much easier to deal with. In Chapter 5, we outline a
comprehensive plan for managing your MS — including the five basic treat-
ment strategies that you and your healthcare team can use to manage your
MS and help you feel your best. In this chapter, we take a closer look at two
of those strategies — managing the disease course and treating relapses —
both of which are important right from the get-go.
First, we describe the six FDA-approved medications that have been shown
to have a positive impact on the course of MS, and explain how you and your
doctor can decide if you’re a good candidate for one of them. We also talk
about what you can expect from these medications in terms of treatment ben-
efits, side effects, and possible risks, and we emphasize the importance of
starting treatment early in the disease course.
Then we give you a heads up about MS relapses (also called attacks, exacer-
bations, flare-ups, or episodes) — including what they are, how they’re diag-
nosed, and how the decision is made to treat a relapse or not. Because
corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for significant relapses, we make
sure you know what to expect in terms of their benefits and side effects.
Even though having more treatment options to choose from is a good thing, it
also tends to make people a little anxious about picking the right one. So our
goal in this chapter is to give you the information you need to talk comfortably
with your healthcare team about the treatment options that are best for you.

Managing the Disease Course
Managing MS is a little like managing an unruly toddler — sometimes it’s diffi-
cult to tell who’s winning but it’s up to you to do everything you can to main-
tain control. To help you maintain control of your MS, in this section, we give
you the lowdown on early treatment, and then introduce you to the medica-
tions that have been shown to slow or modify the disease course (which is
why they’ve been given the catchy name “disease-modifying therapies” or
DMTs for short). We start with the immunomodulating medications because
they’re the ones your doctor is most likely to recommend early on, and we
finish with a discussion of the immunosuppressant medications that are avail-
able for folks with a more progressive disease course. While immunomodulators
alter selected actions of the immune system, the immunosuppressants tem-
porarily shut down the body’s normal immune functions (flip to Chapter 1 to
read about what’s up in your immune system).
Keep in mind as you read about these medications that none of them is con-
sidered safe for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Be sure to let your
doctor know if you’re thinking about getting pregnant so that your treatment
planning can take into account your best interests as well as your baby’s
(check out Chapter 16 for more info about pregnancy and MS).
Understanding the whys and wherefores 
of early treatment
Here’s one of the trickiest things about MS: Even before you know you have
this disease or before it has caused you any significant symptoms or prob-
lems, it’s having a field day in your central nervous system (CNS). Studies with
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown that a significant amount of
damage to the myelin coating around the nerve fibers in your CNS, as well as
to the nerve fibers (axons) themselves, begins early on. In fact, five to ten
times more disease activity is detectable by MRI than is clinically detected by
you or your doctor. And this sneaky disease activity may eventually translate
into clinical symptoms and disability. Although the myelin in the CNS has some
ability to repair itself (see Chapter 1), the damage to the nerve fibers — referred
to as axonal loss — appears to be more permanent. This nerve fiber damage
is most likely the cause of the progressive disability that occurs in MS.
What all this means for you is that even though there are no guarantees with
this unpredictable disease, the earlier you begin treatment with one of the
disease-modifying therapies, the better shot you have at slowing disease
activity and reducing future disability. Another good reason to start treatment
early is that all of the DMTs we describe in this part of the chapter primarily
78
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

target inflammation in the CNS, and you guessed it: Inflammation is most
common during the early stages of the disease. Therefore, the earlier you get
started with treatment, the more effective these medications are likely to be.
Getting familiar with the 
immunomodulators
Five immunomodulating medications, which alter certain functions of the
immune system, have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of MS. Of
those medications, four are considered first-line options — the ones that your
doctor may discuss with you right off the bat. The fifth is more likely to be
recommended only if none of the first-line medications seem to be effective
for you.
All of these drugs — which are taken on an ongoing basis — are expensive.
And although much of the cost may be covered by your health insurance, not
every insurance plan includes all five drugs in their formulary. You may find,
for example, that your plan covers two or three of the immunomodulating
medications but not the others. You and your doctor can take that into con-
sideration when making the decision about which of the medications is best
for you. You may also find that your monthly co-payment is significantly 
different — higher or lower — than someone else’s for the same drug. This
difference in co-payments occurs because the manufacturers of the drugs
negotiate different deals with different insurance companies (flip to Chapter 19
for more information about health insurance). Your best strategy for finding
out your cost for any of these medications is to consult your insurance plan.
But, keep in mind that medication prices can change frequently because the
manufacturers are free to raise or lower them whenever they choose.
Each of the drug companies runs a program designed to help people apply
for and use all the state and federal programs for which they’re eligible.
These companies also help people who are uninsured or underinsured (and
who meet certain income-and-assets criteria) through patient assistance pro-
grams. Because these criteria take into account many factors, including high
healthcare costs, many middle-income people are eligible for assistance. The
companies invite you to call the toll-free numbers listed in the following sec-
tion for information about financial assistance.
Injectable immunomodulating medications: First-line treatments
Avonex, Betaseron, Copaxone, and Rebif are the four injectable immunomod-
ulating medications available for the treatment of MS. These medications,
which primarily target inflammation in the CNS, are generally recommended
for any person who experiences relapses — whether he or she has relapsing-
remitting MS (RRMS), secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), or progressive-
79
Chapter 6: Managing the Disease Course and Treating Relapses

relapsing MS (PRMS). They aren’t recommended, however, for people diag-
nosed with primary-progressive MS (PPMS) because PPMS — which has no
relapses or remissions — has not been shown to respond to any of these
medications. (Check out Chapter 1 for a description of the four disease
courses in MS.)
None of the four injectable immunomodulating medications is head and
shoulders above the others, so you don’t have to worry about making the
“best” choice. None of them stops the disease in its tracks either. But, each
has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of MS relapses and the
number of new lesions (also called plaques or scars,) seen on MRI scans.
Studies indicate that some or all of these meds may also slow disease pro-
gression and the accumulation of disability.
The following list describes how each medication works.
 Interferon beta medications: Although no one is exactly sure how the
interferon beta medications work in MS, they seem to impact the immune
system in several ways — including slowing the trafficking of immune
cells across the blood-brain barrier into the CNS and decreasing produc-
tion of the messenger proteins that cause inflammation.
80
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 
The debate about neutralizing antibodies
Antibodies are immune system proteins that
develop in response to foreign substances,
such as viruses and bacteria. Some — but not
all — people who take an interferon beta med-
ication (Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif) develop a
form of antibody known as a neutralizing anti-
body (NAb), so called because it interferes with
the biological activities of the interferon. When
they occur, NAbs typically develop 12 to 18
months after the start of treatment. Even though
NAbs seem to have an impact on relapse rates,
the development of new lesions in the CNS, and
perhaps on disease progression, neurologists
are still learning how best to use this informa-
tion in treating their patients. Here are the fac-
tors that doctors must take into consideration:
 The higher-dose, more frequently adminis-
tered interferons (Betaseron and Rebif),
which have been shown to produce more
NAbs than the lower-dose interferon
(Avonex), may also provide greater short-
term benefit than the lower-dose interferon.
 Some people seem to do well on their inter-
feron medication in spite of developing NAbs,
while others do poorly on an interferon
medication even without developing NAbs.
For these reasons, most MS specialist neurolo-
gists believe that treatment decisions are best
made by evaluating how a person is feeling and
functioning rather than by measuring NAbs. If a
person’s MS remains very active in spite of
being on an interferon medication and he or she
tests positive for NAbs on more than one occa-
sion, the doctor may recommend that the
person switch to a non-interferon medication.

The interferons should be used with caution by anyone who’s depressed
or has a history of depression because some evidence indicates that
these meds may increase depressive symptoms. So, if you’re feeling
depressed or have a history of depression, be sure to let your physician
know about it. This conversation will help you and your doctor make the
best possible treatment decisions for you while also keeping an eye on
your mood (see Chapter 9 for more on MS and depression).
The interferon beta medications include the following:
• Avonex (interferon beta-1a): Avonex has been shown in clinical
trials to reduce the frequency of relapses and the number of new
or active lesions on MRI scans, and to slow disease progression.
It’s approved to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (which
includes secondary-progressive MS in those people who continue
to have relapses). Avonex has also been shown to delay the onset
of MS in people who have experienced one clinical episode of
demyelination (damage to the myelin in the CNS) that puts them at
risk for developing MS (look at Chapter 2 for more information
about clinically isolated syndrome, or CIS). The FDA has approved
Avonex for this purpose.
For more information, contact Avonex Alliance at (800) 456-2255,
or online at www.avonex.com, www.msactivesource.com, or
www.healthtalk.com.
• Betaseron (interferon beta-1b): Betaseron has been shown in clini-
cal trials to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses and
reduce the number of new or active lesions on MRI scans. It’s
approved in the U.S. to treat relapsing forms of MS (which includes
secondary-progressive MS in those people who continue to have
relapses). Like Avonex, Betaseron has also been shown to delay
the onset of MS in people with CIS and has been approved by the
FDA for this use.
For more information, contact Pathways at (800) 788-1467 or (800)
948-5777 (for financial issues). Or, you can research Betaseron
online at www.betaseron.com, www.mspathways.com, or
www.championsofcourage.org.
• Rebif (interferon beta-1a): Rebif has been shown to reduce the fre-
quency of relapses and the number of new or active lesions on MRI
scans, and slow the progression of disability. It’s approved in the U.S.
to treat relapsing forms of MS (which includes secondary-progressive
MS in people who continue to have relapses). Like Betaseron and
Avonex, Rebif has demonstrated its ability to delay the onset of MS
in people with CIS, but it isn’t FDA approved for this use.

MSLifeLines at (877) 447-3243 or online at www.mslifelines.com.
81
Chapter 6: Managing the Disease Course and Treating Relapses

 Copaxone (glatiramer acetate): Copaxone has been shown to reduce
the frequency of relapses and the number of new or active lesions on
MRI scans. It’s approved in the U.S. to treat relapsing-remitting MS. As
with the interferons, no one is sure exactly how Copaxone works, but it’s
believed that it works by changing “bad guy” lymphocytes into “good
guy” lymphocytes. These good guys cross the blood-brain barrier into
the CNS to suppress inflammatory activity.
For more information, contact Shared Solutions at (800) 887-8100 or
online at www.sharedsolutions.com or www.mswatch.com.
For a simple way to think about the possible actions of the interferons and
Copaxone, picture a barroom: The interferons guard the door (which in MS
terms is the blood-brain barrier) so that the bad guys can’t get in. Copaxone
makes up the good guys (bouncers) who work inside the bar to break up fights.
Although the medications have all been shown to reduce disease activity in
people with relapsing forms of MS, they differ in the following ways:
 In the dosing, frequency, and route of delivery:
• Avonex: 30 micrograms once a week by intramuscular (into the
muscle) injection
• Betaseron: 250 micrograms every other day by subcutaneous
(under the skin) injection
• Copaxone: 20 milligrams (or 20,000 micrograms) every day by 
subcutaneous injection
• Rebif: 44 micrograms three times a week by subcutaneous injection
 In the side effects they cause:
• Avonex: Flu-like symptoms following injection (which lessen over
time for many people). Rarer: depression, mild anemia, elevated
liver enzymes, and liver toxicity.
• Betaseron: Flu-like symptoms following injection (which lessen
over time for many people); injection-site reactions. Rarer: depres-
sion, elevated liver enzymes, and low white blood cell counts.
• Copaxone: Injection-site reactions. Rarer: a reaction immediately
after injection, which includes anxiety, chest tightness, shortness
of breath, and flushing. This reaction lasts 5 to 10 minutes and has
no known long-term effects.
• Rebif: Flu-like symptoms following injection (which lessen over
time for many people); injection site reactions. Rarer: Elevated
liver enzymes, liver toxicity, and low white blood cell counts.
82
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

You may find it difficult to get excited about these injectable medications, but
the fact is that they’re all quite manageable (and the good news is that some
oral medications are currently being evaluated in clinical trials). You can
learn to do the shots yourself, on a schedule that’s convenient for you. And
you can do them in the comfort of your home or office. Even though each has
advantages and disadvantages to consider in terms of frequency and route of
injection and side effects, they all offer significant benefits.
Your job is to work with your doctor to figure out which medication will be
most effective and easiest to manage given your particular needs, prefer-
ences, and lifestyle. The best medication for you is the one that you can take
on a consistent basis until something more effective comes along.
Tysabri: A first-line alternative
Tysabri (natalizumab), the newest of the immunomodulating options, was 
initially approved by the FDA in 2004, but then it was withdrawn from the
market by the manufacturer (Elan) because of safety concerns. It was approved
by the FDA for return to the market in June 2006 for use by people who have
relapses — which means that folks who have primary-progressive MS or 
secondary-progressive MS without relapses aren’t candidates for this 
medication.
Tysabri is delivered every four weeks by intravenous infusion, (a slow drip
through a needle inserted into a vein). The most common side effects include
headache, fatigue, urinary tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections,
joint pain, and chest discomfort. This medication is designed to hamper the
movement of potentially damaging immune cells from the bloodstream, across
the blood-brain barrier, and into the brain and spinal cord. Tysabri has been
shown to reduce the risk of progression of disability, the number of relapses,
and the development of new or enlarging lesions on MRI scans.
Even though Tysabri has never been compared directly with the injectable
medications, the clinical trial data suggest that it’s more effective in reducing
relapses, lesions on MRI, and the risk of disability progression. However,
these benefits come with significantly greater risks. Three people who had
been in clinical trials involving Tysabri (two in a trial for MS and one in a trial
for Crohn’s disease) developed a rare, but rapidly progressive brain disorder
called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML. Two of the people
died, including one person who had been diagnosed with MS (but the diagno-
sis in now in question).
PML is thought to be caused by the JC virus (JCV). Most people are exposed
to this virus in childhood and carry it in a dormant state but never become
ill. PML occurs almost exclusively in individuals with suppressed immune
83
Chapter 6: Managing the Disease Course and Treating Relapses

systems (such as people with AIDS or those who take immunosuppressant
medications to treat cancer or receive an organ transplant). The immune sup-
pression allows the virus to cause disease. The symptoms of PML include
mental deterioration, vision loss, speech disturbances, loss of coordination,
paralysis, and ultimately coma and usually death.
The people in the MS clinical trial who developed PML were taking Tysabri in
combination with Avonex. Right now, no one knows the precise risk of devel-
oping PML while on Tysabri alone or in combination with another DMT, but
the risk within the clinical trials group equaled about one in one thousand.
The FDA has assumed that same level of risk in their approval for Tysabri’s
return to the market.
Because of the significant risks involved, Tysabri isn’t typically used as a
first-line treatment. The FDA recommends that it only be offered to people
who haven’t received adequate benefit from the first-line MS medications or
have been unable to tolerate the injections or the side effects associated with
those medications.
In accordance with the FDA’s requirements, the drug’s manufacturers (Biogen
Idec and Elan) have developed procedures for the careful tracking of adverse
events, which generally translates to mean “when bad things happen to good
people while undergoing a particular treatment.” They also have established
a large observational study to help evaluate the long-term safety of Tysabri.
In addition, the FDA included the following requirements in their approval of
Tysabri’s return to the market:
 Tysabri is not to be given to people who have weakened immune sys-
tems (for example, from leukemia or lymphoma) or who are taking any
other immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medication, including
the DMTs described in this chapter.
 Tysabri is available only to patients who have enrolled (along with their
physicians) in a mandatory registry program called “TOUCH.”
 Tysabri will be given only at registered infusion centers where the med-
ical personnel have been trained in its proper use and in the risks of PML.
 Prior to each infusion, the patient and infusion nurse must complete a
checklist to identify any new signs or symptoms that require evaluation
by a physician.
 The prescribing physician should evaluate patients at 3 and 6 months
after the first infusion of Tysabri and every 6 months thereafter.
As you read the information about Tysabri, some of you undoubtedly said “One
in thousand — I’d take that risk in a minute if it was offered to me!” However,
others of you said “I wouldn’t touch that drug with a 10-foot pole!” This is one
84
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

of those situations where the right and wrong answers aren’t clearly marked.
Should the situation arise, you’ll be weighing the risks and benefits with your
healthcare team and family members in order to make the choice that’s right
for you.
Turning to immunosuppressants
Immunosuppressant medications, which shut down the body’s immune
system, are primarily used to treat certain types of cancer. Some are also
used to treat MS when the first-line medications described in the previous
section have been ineffective. For this reason, they’re sometimes referred to
as rescue therapies.
Novantrone
Novantrone (mitoxantrone) was approved by the FDA to treat people with
relapsing-remitting MS that’s rapidly getting worse, as well as people with
progressive-relapsing or secondary-progressive MS (check out the disease
courses in Chapter 1). This medication appears to work by suppressing the
activity of the cells that lead the attack on myelin in the CNS. In the clinical
trial leading to its approval, Novantrone was found to delay the onset of the
first relapse requiring treatment with corticosteroids (see the section
“Treating an acute relapse” later in the chapter), and to delay the time to
increased disability. It also was shown to reduce the number of relapses
requiring treatment and the number of new lesions seen on MRI scans. This
medication is given by intravenous infusion every three months.
Novantrone can cause damage to the heart, so it’s only recommended for
those people whose heart function is completely normal. But don’t worry —
your doctor will carefully evaluate the health of your heart with an echocar-
diogram or a multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan before prescribing this
medication to you. Here’s the lowdown on these tests:
 An echocardiogram is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to evalu-
ate heart function.
 The MUGA scan is a different kind of non-invasive test that evaluates the
health of the heart wall and the ventricles (the heart’s pumping stations).
As an added measure, the use of Novantrone is limited to 8 to 12 doses over 2 to
3 years, and repeat cardiac testing is recommended prior to each dose. In addi-
tion, Novantrone carries with it an increased risk for secondary acute myeloge-
nous leukemia. However, this condition is thought to occur more commonly in
patients who have been treated previously with another immunosuppressant or
who have been using Novantrone in combination with other chemotherapy or
radiotherapy.
85
Chapter 6: Managing the Disease Course and Treating Relapses

Other immune-suppressing drugs
In addition to Novantrone, several other immunosuppressants are used to
treat a case of MS that doesn’t seem to be responding to the first-line treat-
ments. Even though their specific use in MS hasn’t been approved by the
FDA, the following immunosuppressants are used:
 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide): Cytoxan is a potent immunosuppressive
drug that’s usually given to treat cancer. It has been used for treating MS
for many years, but mostly in uncontrolled studies where it was often
(but not always) reported to improve the condition of people with pri-
mary- or secondary-progressive MS.
 Imuran (azathioprine): Imuran suppresses the immune system and is
commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis. It’s also part of the chemotherapy regimen for some cancers.
 Leustatin (cladribine): Leustatin is a medication that has been used to
treat hairy cell leukemia. Pilot studies suggested a benefit in both relaps-
ing-remitting MS and progressive MS.
 Methotrexate: Methotrexate is a synthetic immunosuppressive drug
that’s highly effective in the short-term against rheumatoid arthritis. At
least one study found it useful in treating secondary-progressive MS.
If you’re a woman or man of baby-making age, you need to consider the possi-
ble impact of any of these immunosuppressant medications on fertility. (See
Chapter 16 for more information about how to guarantee a good supply of
those eggs and sperm). Because immunosuppressants can temporarily or
permanently interfere with the menstrual cycle or damage eggs and sperm,
you may want to consider storing some of your eggs or sperm for future use.
And, remember, none of these medications are safe for use during pregnancy
because they can harm the developing fetus.
Setting realistic expectations for the DMTs
One of the keys to success with the DMTs is knowing what you can reason-
ably expect from them, and what you can’t. So here it goes:
 These medications aren’t cures for MS, and they aren’t designed to make
you feel better.
 When effective, these medications can help reduce the number and
severity of relapses and decrease the numbers of new lesions that
appear on your MRI scan.
 With these medications, you’re still likely to experience a relapse every
now and then, and you’ll probably find new lesions on the MRI (although
not as many new ones as before). You may also still have a lot of the
same old symptoms.
86
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

The fact is that on a day-to-day basis you aren’t going to know whether the
medication you’re taking is actually “working” for you. Because the goal of
the disease-modifying medications is to slow disease activity, you and your
doctor will determine the effectiveness of your treatment by tracking your
relapses, keeping an eye on your symptoms, and perhaps repeating your MRI
scans on a yearly basis.
You’re taking a DMT based on the assumption that the medication will do for
you what it did for the people in the clinical trial that evaluated it — which is
to slow disease activity. By keeping your expectations realistic, you’ll be able
to stick with the program no matter what medication you’re on. In the event
that your physician determines that the treatment isn’t helping sufficiently to
slow your disease, he or she will suggest trying another one of the medica-
tions to see if it does the trick. Clinical trials are currently in progress to
determine whether any of these medications can be used safely and effec-
tively in combination.
A word about primary-progressive MS
If you’ve been diagnosed with primary-progressive MS, we know that you’re

Using your resources to dig up additional info
about the DMTs
Getting a handle on the available disease-mod-
ifying therapies is no easy task, but several
resources are available to help you.
You can contact the National MS Society at 800-
FIGHT-MS (800-344-4867) to ask questions about
any of the medications. In addition, the Society
offers the following publications to assist you in
finding out about the medications and dis-
cussing them with your healthcare team:
 The Disease Modifying Drugs: This handy
pocket-size brochure gives you an over-
view of the disease-modifying therapies in
MS. You can find this brochure at www.
nationalmssociety.org/dmd.
 Putting the Brakes on MS: This brochure
provides an extensive discussion of the 
medications, including some vignettes
describing a few people’s experiences. To

decide.
You can also contact the manufacturers of 
the medications for such information as admin-
istration procedures, side effects, and the
availability of financial assistance. The tele-
phone numbers and Web sites for each of 
the companies can be found in the section
“Injectable immunomodulating medications:
First-line treatments” earlier in this chapter.
Keep in mind, however, that the companies are
marketing their products to you at the same
time that they’re providing information and sup-
port. Be sure to discuss any questions you have
with your healthcare team.

Chapter 1 for information on the many disease courses). We don’t blame you
either. The entire MS community — including healthcare professionals, scien-
tists, and people with MS — is waiting along with you. The treatments we 
discuss earlier in this chapter primarily target inflammation in the CNS. And
because little or no inflammation is involved in primary-progressive MS, these
medications aren’t effective for you. Of course, there’s still a lot you can do to
take care of yourself. For example, the symptom management strategies we
describe in Chapters 7, 8, and 9 and the rehab strategies in Chapter 13 can
help you feel and function at your best. Scientists and clinicians are working
to understand the underlying mechanisms of primary-progressive MS in
order to develop effective treatments.
Managing Relapses
The majority of people with MS (except those with primary-progressive MS)
experience relapses (also called attacks, exacerbations, or flare-ups) during
the early phases of the disease. Folks often call them “exasperations,” either
by accident or on purpose, and for good reason: They never come at a good
time, they generally produce one kind of discomfort or another, and more
often than not they interfere with everyday life at least to some degree. So
that you can get on with your life as quickly as possible, we filled the follow-
ing sections with information about what relapses are (and aren’t) and how
they’re treated.
Defining a relapse
A relapse, which is defined as the appearance of new symptoms or the aggra-
vation of old ones, lasts at least 24 hours (more often a few days or weeks) and
is associated with inflammation and demyelination in the brain or spinal cord.
(Check out Chapter 1 for more information about demyelination in the CNS.)
The first key point in the relapse definition is that the symptoms you experi-
ence during a relapse are caused by disease activity in the CNS — in other
words, they’re the outward sign of changes in your brain or spinal cord. The
second key point is that the episode needs to last for at least a day to be con-
sidered the real thing. These key points are important to keep in mind because,
as you’ve probably noticed, MS symptoms frequently act up for short periods
of time — minutes, hours, or maybe even a day or two. But, most of these
wannabe relapses aren’t caused by disease activity in the CNS, which means
they aren’t true relapses. When symptoms act up for reasons other the dis-
ease itself, they’re called pseudoexacerbations.
88
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

Recognizing the relapse wannabe
Symptoms can act up for a variety of reasons — most of which are in
response to a temporary increase in your body temperature instead of any
underlying disease activity.
Even a half-degree elevation in your core body temperature can cause a pseu-
doexacerbation. For example, you may notice some discomfort in the follow-
ing situations:
 When you’re exercising in a hot environment or for prolonged periods of
time (Check out Chapter 11 for suggestions on how to keep your cool
while exercising.)
 When you’re running a fever caused by a virus or some kind of infection —
most commonly a urinary tract infection (UTI)
 When the weather is hot or humid or both
If you experience a heat-related pseudoexacerbation, don’t panic — your MS
isn’t progressing. The symptoms will gradually subside as your body temper-
ature returns to normal. Keep in mind, though, that if your flu or urinary tract
infection lasts several days, the pseudoexacerbation isn’t likely to simmer
down until the infection is gone.
You may also find that your symptoms act up when you’re particularly tired
or stressed out. This reaction isn’t too surprising considering that most people
(with MS or without) tend to feel crummy when they’re exhausted or under
pressure. So, again, don’t panic — this blip in your symptoms doesn’t mean
that your MS is getting worse. Chances are that you’ll begin feeling better after
a good night’s rest or after a little fun and relaxation. You can read about strate-
gies for managing your fatigue in Chapter 7 and your stress in Chapter 12.
Knowing when to call the doctor
If your symptoms suddenly take a turn for the worse, or you experience a
symptom that you’ve never had before, take a minute to think about what
might be causing it. If you’re overheated, tired, or particularly stressed out,
take a little time to chill out. If the situation doesn’t improve by the next day
or so, it’s time to check in with your neurologist. Just remember: Virtually
nothing that happens in MS is a dire emergency, so don’t feel that you have to
rush to the ER or call the doctor at 2 a.m.
Because any kind of infection can cause MS symptoms to flare up, your doctor
will probably first check to see if you have a UTI that may be causing the prob-
lem. UTIs are very common in MS (check out Chapter 8 for more information
about urinary symptoms and UTIs), and they can aggravate other symptoms
89
Chapter 6: Managing the Disease Course and Treating Relapses

even before you’re aware of the bladder problem. After the UTI is treated,
your other symptoms will quiet down.
While you’re visiting his or her office, the doctor will also do a neurologic
exam (see Chapter 2 for a description of the exam) to look for anything that
has changed significantly since your last exam. These findings, in combina-
tion with the information you provide about the changes in your symptoms,
enable the doctor to determine whether you’re experiencing a true relapse.
Treating an acute relapse
The fact is that most MS relapses gradually resolve on their own over a
period of days, weeks, or months. In other words, the inflammation underly-
ing the relapse eventually dies down, taking with it all or some of the symp-
toms it caused. So, following a relapse, you may feel and function just like
your old self, or you may find that some of your symptoms stick around for a
long time or even forever.
Given that most relapses gradually get better on their own, you’re probably
wondering how your doctor decides whether to treat a relapse or not. Here’s
the bottom line answer: In general, neurologists will treat the relapse with
corticosteroids if it’s interfering significantly with your daily life.
For example, if your vision or ability to walk are impaired — and you can’t drive
your car, function at work, or take care of your kids — your doctor is likely to
recommend treatment. If, however, your symptoms are less invasive — maybe
you’re experiencing increased fatigue, some numbness or tingling on your left
side, or spasticity (increased stiffness) — the recommendation may be to treat
whatever symptoms you’re having and let the relapse resolve on its own. The
main reason that doctors don’t treat every relapse that comes along is that
the corticosteroids that are used are more of a quick fix than a long-term
solution — and they can pose problems of their own (see the upcoming sec-
tion “Managing the side effects of corticosteroids” for details).
Understanding corticosteroid treatments
Corticosteroids are hormones that are produced in the human body by the
adrenal glands (these are very different from the anabolic steroids used by
athletes, so don’t get your hopes up for next year’s World Series). When pre-
scribed as a medication, these hormones have a number of physiologic
effects on different organ systems, but they’re most widely used for their anti-
inflammatory actions. For example, in MS, corticosteroid medications help
reduce the inflammation that occurs during a relapse so that the relapse comes
to an end more quickly. A study is currently underway to determine if these
meds also have some long-term benefit on the progression of the disease.
90
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

Some corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, are generally given
orally. Others, such as Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone) and Decadron (dex-
amethasone) are given by intravenous infusion. Most MS specialists recom-
mend a three- to five-day course of high-dose intravenous (IV) steroids as the
treatment of choice for severe MS attacks because this regimen seems to pro-
vide maximum benefit with the fewest side effects. This treatment may require
hospitalization, but it’s also common to have the intravenous treatment on
an outpatient basis. Your doctor may also prescribe what’s called a steroid
taper — a gradually decreasing dose of oral steroids over a one- to two-week
period — to prolong the benefit of the medication while easing you off it
more slowly.
As an alternative to IV steroids — particularly for attacks that aren’t quite as
severe — a short course of high-dose oral steroids may also be appropriate.
Your neurologist will work with you to figure out the best option for your par-
ticular circumstances.
What to expect from corticosteroids
The physician’s goal in prescribing corticosteroids is to help you get back on
track more quickly — especially if your relapse is interfering with your daily
activities. In other words, the corticosteroids jump-start your recovery from
the attack. But, they don’t have any impact on your ultimate level of recovery
from the attack.
While most people do well with these medications, it’s difficult to predict
exactly what your response will be. You may, for example, feel dramatically
better within a couple of days — so good and energized, in fact, that you wish
you could stay on corticosteroids forever (one woman commented that her
closets are always at their cleanest when she’s on corticosteroids). Or, you
may experience little relief from your symptoms, in which case you and your
doctor will focus on managing your symptoms and wait for the relapse to
resolve itself. Or, if the relapse is particularly severe, your neurologist may
recommend another treatment strategy (see the section “Alternatives to cor-
ticosteroids” later in the chapter).
You may find corticosteroids easy to tolerate and you may enjoy the energy
boost, or you may find yourself struggling with some pretty intense irritabil-
ity or mood swings ranging from “high” and energized during the treatment
to down and depressed as you come off the medication.
It’s important to be aware of the range of possible corticosteroid reactions
because they can all happen to anyone at one time or another. In other words,
responding positively to corticosteroids during one relapse doesn’t necessar-
ily mean that you’ll respond positively the next time, and having one negative
experience doesn’t mean they’ll all be negative.
91
Chapter 6: Managing the Disease Course and Treating Relapses

Managing the side effects of corticosteroids
Although most people tolerate treatment well, corticosteroids can produce a
variety of side effects — both immediate and long-term — and it’s because of
these side effects that doctors recommend the short three- to five-day course.
The immediate side effects can include stomach irritation, elevation of blood
sugar, water retention/weight gain, restlessness, difficulty sleeping (which is
why the closets get cleaned), and mood swings. Chances are that you won’t
run into any problems, but your doctor can prescribe medication to help you
sleep or to minimize stomach irritation if necessary.
Corticosteroids should never be used on an ongoing basis because they can
cause acne and unwanted hair growth, along with much more serious and
debilitating problems such as stomach ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis
(thinning of the bones).
Alternatives to corticosteroids
For anyone who can’t obtain corticosteroids (shortages have occurred in the
past) or who is unable to tolerate the side effects, the FDA has approved the
use of a medication called H.P. Acthar Gel, which is made from adrenocorti-
cotropic hormone, or ACTH for short. Like corticosteroids, ACTH treats the
relapse but doesn’t affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the MS.
It’s administered by daily intramuscular injection over a two- to three-week
period. The possible side effects include vomiting, changes in appetite, diar-
rhea, constipation, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, and sweating. And like
corticosteroids, ACTH shouldn’t be used on an ongoing basis.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), which is a medication that’s generally
delivered by monthly intravenous infusion, is another option for people who
can’t tolerate, can’t obtain, or don’t respond well to corticosteroids. However,
MS specialists vary considerably in their opinions about the effectiveness of
IVIg. And plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) is available for someone who’s
experiencing a particularly severe relapse that won’t respond to treatment
with high-dose corticosteroids.
Bringing in the rehab team
In spite of whatever treatment your doctor prescribes for a relapse, some
symptoms may remain. This is an ideal time to call on the expertise of the
rehabilitation professionals (see Chapter 4). If, for example, you’re left with
weakness in one or both legs, problems with balance, or more fatigue than
you’ve been used to dealing with, a physical therapist can help. He or she can
work with you to improve your walking and to identify the mobility aid that
could best help you maintain your balance and conserve your energy (flip to
Chapter 7 for more on managing physical symptoms). The occupational ther-
apist can recommend modifications to your home or work space to make it
92
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

easier for you to get around and get stuff done. If your relapse left you with
some memory or attention problems, your best ally is a neuropsychologist
who can scope out the problem and recommend some ways to compensate
(check out Chapter 9 for strategies dealing with memory problems and other
cognitive changes). As you can see, after a relapse is over, there’s a lot you
can do to help yourself get back in the groove.
Getting Comfortable with Your 
Treatment Decisions
Any good MS doctor will tell you that treating MS is as much an art as it is a
science — in other words, it’s more creative problem-solving than hard-and-fast
rules. Even though tremendous progress has been made toward understand-
ing the disease and developing medications to treat it, there’s no cure at this
time and no single treatment plan that works for everyone.
The artistry involves you and your healthcare team working together to
develop a treatment plan that meets your needs (take a look at Chapter 5 for
suggestions on creating your personal disease management plan). And
although your treatment plan will probably include some of the medications
described in this chapter, keep in mind that none of them are cure-alls or magic
potions — they slow things down, but they don’t stop ’em. You’ll probably
experience relapses even while taking a DMT, and your symptoms are going
to continue to do their thing. But this doesn’t mean that you’ve failed in any
way or chosen the wrong treatment. When docs use that terrible term “treat-
ment failure,” they don’t mean you! You didn’t fail the treatment — the treat-
ment failed you by not doing all that you hoped and expected. Rest assured,
when treatments fail, your physician will work with you to figure out what
other treatments to try.
In the meantime, keep your eye on the big picture: Work with your healthcare
team to manage your symptoms (check out Chapters 7, 8, and 9), and remem-
ber that feeling healthy is about more than just your MS. See Chapter 11 for
tips on how to make exercise and healthy eating a part of your wellness strat-
egy and Chapter 12 for suggestions on how to manage the stresses of every-
day life.

Managing Fatigue, Walking
Problems, Visual Changes, 
and Tremor
In This Chapter
 Understanding and addressing the causes of MS fatigue
 Dealing with visual changes
 Enhancing mobility and independence
 Minimizing the impact of tremor
M
ultiple sclerosis (MS) can cause a whole slew of symptoms. While
most people experience only a few of them over the course of the dis-
ease, others have to deal with many more. Unfortunately, there’s no way to
predict which symptoms you may experience or to what degree, but our goal
is to help you feel more prepared to manage whatever symptoms do occur.
In this chapter, we focus on four MS symptoms — fatigue, visual changes, walk-
ing problems, and tremor. Even though these symptoms may not seem to have
anything in common — other than being annoying — the management of each
of them relies, at least in part, on the marvels of assistive technology (AT). AT
refers to all of the tools, products, and devices — from the simplest to the most
complex — that can make functioning (and therefore daily life) easier for you.
Don’t let this chapter overwhelm you. The strong message here is that there
are many strategies to manage problems with fatigue, walking, vision, and
tremor. And you don’t have to handle any of it alone. Your rehab team mem-
bers are sure to be your closest allies — they’ll help you be in the best shape
you can and they’ll show you how to use AT to the max. Think of it this way:
You wouldn’t try to build a house without a tool chest full of good stuff, so
there’s no need to manage MS without a full set of tools either.

Foiling Your Fatigue
Fatigue is the most common (and often the most disabling) symptom
reported by people with MS. In fact, somewhere between 75 and 90 percent 
of people with MS complain about fatigue, with a good 50 percent identifying
it as the symptom having the greatest impact on their daily lives. Fatigue is
one of those frustrating symptoms that you can feel but others can’t see. So,
you need to be ready to educate the important people in your life — your
family members and friends, your boss, and even your doctor — about how
your fatigue feels and how it affects your day-to-day activities. Check out
Chapter 14 for suggestions on how to talk to others about what’s up with
your MS.
Along with cognitive impairment, fatigue is a primary cause of early depar-
ture from the workforce, so effective fatigue management needs to be high 
on everyone’s priority list from the get-go. The good news is that there are
strategies to help you deal with whatever level of fatigue you’re experiencing.
The critical point about fatigue management is that it’s an ongoing process.
In other words, you’ll have to tweak it as the fatigue, your activities, or your
priorities change.
Identifying and dealing with 
the causes of fatigue
People with MS can feel tired for a lot of reasons. The trick is to identify all
the factors that are contributing to your fatigue and then take steps to
address each one of them. The following sections explain some of the most
common causes of fatigue.
The extra effort required by everyday activities
When symptoms of MS, such as weakness, balance problems, stiffness, or
vision problems, make carrying out daily activities more difficult, you may find
yourself having to work harder to do the same things that you did before —
which will probably leave you feeling a lot more tired. If, for example, it takes
more time and effort to get dressed, make breakfast, climb in and out of your
car, and walk from your car to your office, you may have used up all your
energy before the day even starts. Your energy supply is similar to a bank
account: The larger and more frequent your withdrawals, the sooner you run
out of resources (for some great “banking” tips, take a look at the “Managing
your energy bank to help put your sleepiness to bed” section later in this
chapter).
96
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

The best approach to managing your fatigue is to begin thinking creatively
about how you carry out your daily activities. The following list suggests
ways to help you streamline those activities and make the best use of your
energy supply. As you think about how to apply these ideas at home and at
work, remember that the rehabilitation specialists on your healthcare team
are great resources. They’re the experts when it comes to energy manage-
ment and labor-saving strategies (you can read more about the role of physi-
cal and occupational therapists in Chapter 4). Here’s the list of tips:
 Open up the tool chest. The perfect time to put AT to use is when your
fatigue is negatively affecting your daily life. Why stand in the shower
when you can sit on a shower chair? Why use a manual can opener when
an electric one can do the job faster and with less effort? Take a careful
look at all the gadgets that have been designed to make life easier for
you. Visit Abledata (www.abledata.com) to discover what AT has to
offer, and check out service.maddak.com/catalog.asp and www.
independentliving.com for a quick look at some creative gadgets
and tools for everyday use.
Using a mobility aid, such as a cane or motorized scooter, can help you
conserve energy for the important things. What’s the point of using all
your energy to get from point A to point B if you’re so tired once you get
there that you can’t enjoy yourself or be productive? We talk more about
mobility aids in the section “Getting Around Walking Problems” later in
the chapter.
 Substitute organization for effort. Make sure that your work spaces at
home and at the office are well-organized and readily accessible. For

Other valuable resources for 
symptom management

each of the symptoms in this chapter. You can

and June Halper (Demos Medical Publish-
ing, 2005).

Have; The Answers You Need, 3rd edition,
by Rosalind Kalb (Demos Medical Publish-
ing, 2004).

rosis, 4th edition, by Randall T. Schapiro
(Demos Medical Publishing, 2003).

example, why put the items you use most in out-of-the-way places? And
why put the tools you need for a particular task in six different places
when you can store them together?
 Ask for reasonable accommodations in the workplace. Think how
much energy and effort you would save if you had a parking spot closer
to the building, an office closer to the bathroom, and a flex-time sched-
ule that allowed you to work during your high-energy hours. (Flip to
Chapter 18 for more information about asking for reasonable accommo-
dations in the workplace.)
 Make things easier for yourself — not more difficult. For example, plan
meals that require a minimum of preparation, and gather all your ingre-
dients in one place before starting to cook. Make your bed one side at a
time to avoid trips back and forth. Throw the laundry bag down the
basement stairs rather than trying to carry it. The possibilities are end-
less. Check out the book by Shelley Peterman Schwarz called 300 Tips
for Making Life with Multiple Sclerosis Easier, 2nd edition (Demos Medical
Publishing, 2006).
 Give yourself permission to do things differently and ask for assis-
tance when you need it. One of the biggest hurdles to dealing with MS
fatigue is getting used to the idea that you may not be able to do every-
thing the way you did it before. After you’ve decided that it’s okay to
adapt to the changes, you’ll be able to come up with creative strategies
and workarounds to save energy and time.
The side effects of medications
People with MS often take a variety of medications, many of which have
sleepiness as a side effect. So, the more medications you’re taking, the more
likely it is that they’re contributing to your feelings of fatigue. Here are some
examples of medications that can cause feelings of fatigue or drowsiness:
 The three disease modifying therapies made from interferon beta —
Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif. Fatigue is most common right after the
injection.
 Medications used to treat spasticity (stiffness), including baclofen,
Zanaflex (tizanidine), and Valium (diazepam).
 Medications used to treat pain, including Neurontin (gabapentin), Tegretol
(carbamazepine), Klonopin (clonazepam), and Cymbalta (duloxetine).
 Some of the medications used to treat depression, including Zoloft (ser-
traline), Paxil (paroxetine), and Effexor (venalfaxine).
If fatigue is a problem, talk with your physician about your medications and
medication schedule. It may be possible to reduce the side effects by adjust-
ing the dose or dosing schedule of some of the medications. Your doctor may
even be able to substitute a different medication that causes less fatigue or
drowsiness.
98
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

Sleep disturbances
Disrupted sleep isn’t restful or refreshing — so you probably want to do
something about it as soon as possible. The first step in dealing with sleep
problems is to talk about them with your doctor. Sleep problems are one of
those subjects that can easily be forgotten during a busy office visit, so add it
to your list of questions if it’s an issue for you. The next step is to work with
your doctor to address all the factors that disrupt your sleep. For example,
any of the following can interfere with a good night’s rest:
 Corticosteroids: The corticosteroids used to treat some MS relapses are
notorious for interfering with sleep. The energy boost they provide may
help you get your closets cleaned, but they won’t let you sleep very much
(check out Chapter 6 for more information about relapse management).
If corticosteroids prevent you from sleeping, your doctor can prescribe
a sleep medication for the time period that you’re taking them.
 Frequent nighttime urination: This condition, which is called nocturia,
can really interfere with a good night’s sleep (take a look at Chapter 8 for
information about bladder management).
So, if your bladder is giving you too many wake-up calls, a referral to a
urologist is definitely a good idea.
 Spasms: Painful nighttime spasms caused by spasticity in your legs can
jolt you right out of a good night’s sleep (we talk more about pain man-
agement in Chapter 8).
For painful spasms in your legs, your doctor can prescribe an anti-
spasticity or muscle relaxant medication.
 Periodic limb movements (PLMs): PLMs, which include jerkiness or
spasms that occur only during sleep, are more common in people with
MS than in the general population. These movements can disrupt your
sleep even if you aren’t aware of them (your sleep partner will be sure to
tell you about them though!). Although these movements can sometimes
be very slight — such as a flexion of your big toe — they may be intense
enough to interrupt your regular sleep cycle.
Your doctor can prescribe a medication such as Lioresal (baclofen),
Klonopin (clonazepam), or Neurontin (gabapentin) to reduce the number
of PLMs and help you sleep soundly through the ones that do occur.
 Depression and anxiety: Although some depressed people feel like
sleeping all the time, many find it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep.
(Go to Chapter 9 for information on treating depression.)
If you or your physician think that depression or anxiety may be respon-
sible for your sleep problems, a referral to a mental health professional
for an evaluation is the best next step.
99
Chapter 7: Managing Fatigue, Walking Problems, Visual Changes, and Tremor

The effects of deconditioning
People who don’t get enough exercise gradually get out of shape, which means
that their muscles are weaker and less toned and their cardiovascular system
doesn’t function as efficiently as it did before. This kind of deconditioning is
pretty common in anyone with MS whose mobility has been impaired. If you’re
unable to get around as easily as you used to, you may find that physical
activity wears you out much more quickly.
In the old days, people with MS were told that they shouldn’t exercise.
However, it’s now known that a regular exercise program, geared to your abil-
ities and limitations, can reduce fatigue, increase your cardiovascular fitness,
and enhance your mood (take a look at Chapter 11 for more information about
exercise). A physical therapist or personal trainer who’s familiar with MS can
design a program to help you get back in shape.
Primary MS fatigue
In addition to all the other things that can make you feel tired or sleepy, you
can add to the list another type of fatigue, commonly referred to as lassitude,
that’s unique to people with MS. Lassitude is thought to result from poor
nerve conduction caused by damage to the myelin around the nerve fibers in
the central nervous system, or CNS (check out Chapter 1 for an overview of
what happens to myelin in the CNS). Because of the demyelination, your
body has to work harder just to transmit messages between your brain and
other parts of your body. Unlike normal fatigue, MS lassitude
 Tends to come on suddenly
 Generally occurs on a daily basis
 Can occur at any time of day, even in the morning after a restful night’s
sleep
 Generally increases as the day progresses
 Can worsen temporarily with heat and humidity
 Is much more likely to interfere with everyday activities
Lassitude may respond well to medication, so talk to your doctor about
whether a prescription would work for you. Even though no medications
have been approved specifically for the treatment of MS fatigue, several are
known to provide relief for some people. For example, talk to your doctor
about the following medications:
 Amantadine: This antiviral medication has been found to relieve fatigue
in some people with MS.
 Provigil (modafinil): This medication is FDA-approved for the treatment
of narcolepsy. The trials in MS have had mixed results, but many people
find that it reduces feelings of sleepiness and tiredness.
100
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

 Prozac (fluoxetine): This antidepressant may reduce feelings of fatigue,
particularly if you’re also experiencing depression.
 Ritalin (methylphenidate): Some people find this stimulant very benefi-
cial for managing their fatigue.
While one or another of these medications may be helpful, it’s usually a
process of trial and error to find the one that’s best for you. No medication,
however, can take the place of adequate rest and exercise, the creative use of
assistive technology, and other energy-saving strategies.
Managing your energy bank to help 
put your sleepiness to bed
As a person with MS, energy will always be one of your most precious
resources — so don’t waste it. Your best overall strategy for managing MS
fatigue is to monitor your energy use as carefully as you monitor the use of
your money. Think of yourself as having an energy bank account, complete
with deposit and withdrawal slips. Your goal is to keep a good supply of energy
in your account at all times, which means that if you make a pretty good-sized
withdrawal, you need to be ready to make a deposit or two to make up for it.
For example, if you know you’re looking forward to a night on the town, you
probably want to schedule in a rest time that afternoon and an extra hour to
sleep the next morning. Here are some tips for managing the bank:
 Keep an energy log for a week or two, making note of your peak
energy and fatigue periods over the course of each day. This log will
help you plan your calendar more wisely, with high-energy activities
scheduled during your best hours, and easier, more restful activities
scheduled during your low points.
 Set priorities so that you save your energy for the stuff that’s most
important. Learning to let go of the less important things (or delegating
them to someone else) is a great way to conserve your energy.
 Pay attention to the signals your body sends you. If you start to feel
tired, take a breather. You’ll be surprised how much better you feel after
a few minutes in a quiet place with your feet up.
 Don’t over-do it. If you push yourself to the max on a good day, you may
hit a wall and end up paying for it over the next week. It’s a much better
strategy to spread your energy usage more evenly over the week —
keeping your withdrawals and deposits as even as you can.
If you do push too hard and suddenly feel your symptoms begin to flare up
(feeling tingly or numb or noticing a change in your color vision, for exam-
ple), don’t panic — the symptoms will subside as you rest and your body
cools down. This is called a pseudoexacerbation (see Chapter 6) because it
101
Chapter 7: Managing Fatigue, Walking Problems, Visual Changes, and Tremor

mimics the changes you might experience with a real relapse or exacerba-
tion. However, these wannabe relapses are caused by a temporary eleva-
tion in your core body temperature rather than by disease progression.
 Make full use of the tools and devices that are available. Doing so isn’t
giving in to MS, it’s taking charge of it. Check out the section “Using aids
to take charge of your mobility” later in the chapter for more details on
these helpful tools.
 Eat a balanced diet to ensure that your body is getting the appropriate
nutrients. A high-fiber, low fat diet not only supplies the fuel for your
energy bank, but it also helps you maintain a healthy weight. Nothing
causes more fatigue than dragging around extra pounds. Go to Chapter 11
for recommendations about diet.
Envisioning Solutions to Vision Problems
Visual symptoms are common in MS. In fact, eighty percent of people with
the disease experience some type of visual problem at one time or another,
and it’s the first symptom for many. These symptoms can come and go over
the course of the disease as a result of inflammation in the optic nerve or
parts of the brainstem. They also may worsen temporarily when your body
temperature is elevated by exercise or a fever. Knowing about the kinds of
changes that can occur is important for a couple of reasons: First, the changes
can be abrupt and frightening, and second, vision problems can interfere with
everyday activities in a significant way. Being knowledgeable about the avail-
able treatments and resources helps you feel a bit more prepared and helps
you get back on track more quickly if these symptoms do happen to you.
In the following sections we describe the vision problems that are common in
MS and clue you in on the strategies for handling them.
Managing visual symptoms
The visual symptoms that occur with MS can be divided into two types — those
that affect vision directly and those that affect eye movement. Neither type
can be addressed with standard eyeglasses because the underlying causes
are related to damage in the CNS. MS vision problems are treated by your neu-
rologist or a neuro-ophthalmologist (a physician who specializes in eye problems
that are neurologic in origin) rather than your regular eye doctor.
Whether you have MS-related eye problems or not, you need to continue receiv-
ing standard eye and vision care from your optometrist or ophthalmologist.
102
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

Vision problems
Optic neuritis, or inflammation of the optic nerve, is the most common visual
disorder associated with MS, and it’s often the first symptom that people expe-
rience. With optic neuritis, you can have any or all of the following problems:
 Vision loss in one eye (Even though loss in both eyes simultaneously is
rare, it isn’t uncommon for visual changes in the other eye to occur
during subsequent episodes of optic neuritis.)
 Blind spots in the center of the visual field
 Faded or washed-out color vision
 Reduced contrast sensitivity, which makes it difficult to see things that
don’t contrast sharply with their background (for example, gray print on
blue paper)
 Pain behind the affected eye
 Visual phenomena, such as flashes of light
 Slowed response of the pupils to changes in light
Your symptoms are likely to worsen over the course of a few days or weeks
and then gradually improve. Some people recover within a month while
others need up to a year or more. Most people regain normal or near-normal
vision, but you may find that the quality of your vision, including contrast
sensitivity and color vision remains somewhat off. Keep in mind that any of
the changes can affect your daytime and nighttime driving.
Optic neuritis may resolve on its own, meaning that patience is all you need.
However, a regimen of high-dose, intravenous corticosteroids — for example,
a three- to five-day course of Solu-Medrol (methylprednisolone), which is some-
times followed by several days of a tapering dose of oral steroids — can
speed your recovery.
So, the question becomes whether or not to treat. Because corticosteroids
don’t have any long-term benefit, and because they can have unpleasant side
effects for some people, waiting it out is a reasonable option (flip to Chapter 6
for more information about relapse management). If, however, your ability 
to function at home or work is being compromised by the changes in your
vision, most MS specialists recommend treatment. Most specialists also rec-
ommend treatment if the optic neuritis is your first MS symptom because IV
corticosteroids given at that time can delay a second demyelinating event in
some people — and therefore the diagnosis of MS (take a look at Chapter 2
for an overview of the diagnostic criteria). In the short-term, we suggest
marking doorways, stairs, and steps with high-contrast tape, turning up the
lights as high as you can, and eliminating glare by moving mirrors and other
shiny objects and by wearing glasses with polarizing lenses.
103
Chapter 7: Managing Fatigue, Walking Problems, Visual Changes, and Tremor

Inflammation of the optic nerve can also occur without causing any symptoms.
In other words, the damage occurs to the optic nerve without you noticing 
any changes in your vision. That’s why the visual evoked potential test (see
Chapter 2) can be so useful in making the MS diagnosis. This test can detect
evidence of demyelination even though you’re unaware of the problem.
The symptoms of optic neuritis can flare up when your body is overheated,
whether it’s from exercise, hot, humid weather, or a fever. This phenomenon
is so common that it has a name — Uhthoff’s phenomenon. Even if you were
unaware of ever having had optic neuritis, you could experience a temporary
flare-up of the symptoms, which resolves fairly quickly after your body tem-
perature returns to normal. Uhthoff’s phenomenon is an example of a pseu-
doexacerbation that can occur when your body is overheated (see Chapter 6
for more on pseudoexacerbations).
Because it only takes a small elevation in core body temperature to cause
this phenomenon in some people, it’s a good idea to keep yourself cool with
air conditioning and cold drinks, particularly when exercising or during peri-
ods of hot weather.
Eye movement problems
Several different muscles control your eye movements. So, in order for your
eyes to move in a coordinated fashion, these muscles must be perfectly in
synch with one another. The most common problems caused by incoordina-
tion in these muscles include the following:
 Nystagmus: This tiny repetitive movement of the eye (generally up and
down or side to side) occurs in 40 to 60 percent of people with MS.
These movements can be so small that you’re unaware of them, or sig-
nificant enough to cause impaired vision (with objects appearing to
jump around), nausea, loss of balance, and disorientation. In other
words, the world can feel pretty wiggly.
The problem may resolve on its own (though it’s unlikely) or it might
respond to a regimen of high-dose IV or oral corticosteroids. Unfortunately,
nystagmus can be pretty persistent. Some medications have been helpful
for some people, including baclofen, Klonopin (clonazepam), Neurontin
(gabapentin), and Transderm Scop (scopolamine), but the results aren’t
earth-shattering. Work is being done on optical devices to stabilize the jig-
gling visual environment of people with nystagmus, but these devices
aren’t available yet. In the meantime, a magnifying glass, large-print materi-
als, and other low-vision aids may be useful (take a look at the upcoming
section “Exploring longer-term management strategies”).
 Diplopia (double vision) and blurry vision: These problems are caused
by eyes that don’t dance well together. In other words, each eye is doing
its own thing. The doctor may prescribe a course of steroids to try and
104
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

resolve the problem quickly. Like nystagmus, however, these problems
don’t tend to respond to corticosteroids as well as optic neuritis does.
You can patch one eye or frost one lens of your eyeglasses to eliminate
the second image. It doesn’t matter which eye you cover, the second
image will disappear — and there’s no reason to alternate the eye you
patch. The opinions about how often or how long you should use an eye
patch aren’t unanimous. Some physicians encourage patching only while
driving or reading, in hopes that the brain will gradually adapt to the
two images and merge them into one. Other doctors feel that patching is
fine, no matter how often or how long you do it.
Mechanical or surgical interventions may also be helpful with the
double vision. For example, a prism can be added to the surface of your
eyeglasses or to the prescription itself to help align the images from
your two eyes, or surgery on the muscles of the eye may help to realign
your vision. However, these interventions shouldn’t be tried if your
symptoms are fluctuating a lot; waiting until your vision has stabilized
will avoid multiple prescription changes or the need to repeat surgery.

Exploring longer-term management 
strategies
Unfortunately, there are no quick fixes for some of the vision problems that
can occur with MS. So, if your vision remains impaired in spite of all of the
interventions mentioned earlier in this chapter, contact a low-vision specialist.
Unlike the neurologist or neuro-ophthalmologist who focuses primarily on
diagnosing your symptoms and trying to manage them medically, low-vision
specialists zero in on how your vision problems affect your everyday life.
Low-vision specialists are licensed optometrists or ophthalmologists with a
special expertise in analyzing and addressing the impact of vision loss on daily
activities. They pay special attention to your activities at home and work, as
well as your hobbies and interests, and recommend aids and strategies to help
you make the most of the vision you have. The specialist may be able to pre-
scribe or recommend optical devices that meet your specific needs.
One particularly useful visual aid is the closed circuit television (CCTV),
which magnifies right onto a TV screen hard-to-see things, such as photos,
letters, book pages, and labels on your prescription medications. Your com-
puter can also be modified to magnify text or translate text into voice and
vice versa. The Low Vision Gateway, a Web site sponsored by the Internet
Low Vision Society, provides a list of computer programs for people with low
vision (see the upcoming sidebar “Low vision resources” for contact info).
Getting Around Walking Problems
“Am I going to end up in a wheelchair?” is one of the questions that MS doc-
tors hear most. The simple answer is that most people don’t become severely
disabled by their MS or need to use a wheelchair on a full-time basis. However,
two-thirds of people eventually need some kind of mobility device — such as a
cane, walker, or scooter — to help them be as active as they want to be. In other
words, walking may be somewhat impaired, but mobility doesn’t have to be.
In the following sections we describe the many ways in which a person’s
walking can be affected by MS, and describe the management strategies and
tools that can be used to help you stay comfortably mobile.
Addressing the sources of the problem
When you have MS, many different factors can affect your ability to walk
easily and safely, so the first step is to identify the sources of the problem.
Read on for an overview of the things that can trip you up.
106
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

Fatigue
As we talk about in the section “Foiling Your Fatigue” at the beginning of the
chapter, lassitude and fatigue resulting from overexertion or deconditioning
can make it difficult for you to do the things you want to do — including walk-
ing. Activities like climbing the stairs or walking around the block, which
used to feel easy, may begin feeling like marathons. So, it’s important to
remember that managing your fatigue will also help your walking.
Spasticity
Spasticity or stiffness in your limbs, which is the result of increased muscle
tone caused by demyelination, can interfere with walking. Limbs that are stiff-
ened by spasticity are more difficult — and therefore more tiring — to move.
The most common sites for spasticity are the muscles of the calf, thigh, but-
tock, groin, and sometimes the back. The stiffness can range from mild and
barely noticeable to severe and painful.
Here’s the tricky thing about spasticity: If you’re experiencing any weakness
in your legs, a little bit of stiffness can actually help you stand and walk. Too
much stiffness, on the other hand, is uncomfortable and tiring. So, the goal is
to manage your spasticity in such a way that you have just the right amount.
Here are some tips for managing your spasticity:
 Treat the problems that are known to increase spasticity. These prob-
lems include a distended bladder or bowel, urinary tract or other types
of infections, pain of any kind, and pressure sores (take a look at
Chapter 13 to find out more about complications of MS).
 Ask your physical therapist to recommend a stretching plan. The plan
should include both active stretching (that you do on your own) and
passive stretching (that you do with a helper who stretches some mus-
cles for you).
Take a look at the National MS Society’s stretching booklets online at
www.nationalmssociety.org/stretching and www.national
mssociety.org/stretchinghelp or by calling (800) FIGHT-MS
(800-344-4867).
 Ask your doctor about medications to treat your spasticity. The most
commonly used medications are Lioresal (baclofen) and Zanaflex (tizani-
dine). Just remember that dosing is important because too little medica-
tion won’t provide relief and too much will make you tired and weak.
The best plan is to start low and work up gradually until the optimal
degree of spasticity (not too much and not too little) is reached. Be
patient — it may take some time to reach this optimal point.
Severe spasticity that doesn’t respond to tolerable doses of these oral
medications is best managed with a surgically-implanted pump that
delivers baclofen directly to the spinal cord. Because the medication
107
Chapter 7: Managing Fatigue, Walking Problems, Visual Changes, and Tremor

goes straight to the spinal cord, this recent miracle of modern medicine
relieves spasticity with a much lower dose of medication — thereby
avoiding the unpleasant side effects of fatigue and weakness.
Dizziness and vertigo
Although dizziness (a sensation of light-headedness or inability to maintain
balance) and vertigo (a sensation that you’re spinning or the world is spin-
ning around you) don’t directly affect walking ability, they sure can make it
unpleasant to move around. They generally occur in MS for one of two rea-
sons: demyelination in areas of the brain stem that control balance, or
demyelination that interferes with messages from the inner ear to the brain.
Because both of these problems can occur for other reasons, it’s important
to rule out other causes before assuming that MS is the culprit.
Here are some tips that may help get you back on your feet:
 If the sensations are worse when you change position, a physical thera-
pist can give you exercises that help build your tolerance to motion.
 Niacin, a component of the vitamin B complex that dilates blood vessels,
sometimes provides relief.
 Antihistamines, such as Benadryl (diphenhydramine), Antivert (meclizine),
or Dramamine (dimenhydrinate) may relieve mild dizziness or vertigo.
 Medications in the benzodiazepine family such as Valium (diazepam),
Klonopin (clonazepam), Ativan (lorazepam), and Xanax (alprazolam)
may suppress the workings of the inner ear that can cause dizziness.
The dilemma you face in trying to manage dizziness and vertigo is that 
the medications that provide the best relief — the antihistamines and 
benzodiazepines — are also known to cause drowsiness. So work with your
doctor to find the lowest possible dose that relieves your discomfort without
zonking you out.
Weakness
Weakness is a tricky symptom. Like fatigue, you have to figure out what’s caus-
ing it in order to manage it effectively. Weakness can be caused by the following:
 Deconditioning: This type of weakness, which results from impaired
mobility or couch potato-itis, can be improved with exercise (take a look
at the section “Foiling Your Fatigue” earlier in the chapter). Progressive
resistive exercise with weights will gradually strengthen a muscle that’s
weak from lack of use.
 Demyelination of the nerve fibers that stimulate the muscles: This is a
different kettle of fish because with this kind of weakness, the muscles are
fine but the nerves that transmit signals to them are damaged. Without
those signals, the muscles can’t do their thing. Even though it’s important
to keep these muscles toned with appropriate exercise, lifting weights
108
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

won’t improve their strength because the nerves providing signals to
those muscles aren’t working. The good news is that exercise can
strengthen the surrounding muscles that are being used to compensate
for the weakened ones.
Managing weakness involves a balancing act: In order to minimize weakness,
you first have to make sure that your fatigue and spasticity are under control.
Then you have to figure out which exercises will be beneficial and which may
make things worse. A physical therapist can work with you to develop an
exercise program to meet your needs. For example:
 An aerobic program tailored to your level of ability can improve your
overall strength and conditioning.
 Weight-resistance training can strengthen muscle groups that are weak
from a lack of use.
 Passive range-of-motion exercises performed by the physical therapist
can help keep all of your muscles flexible and toned even if they aren’t
receiving adequate messages from impaired nerves.
To manage your weakness most effectively, you also need to take advantage of
the tools and mobility aids available to enhance your safety and conserve
your energy. For example, if weakness in your foot and ankle is causing your
toes to drag, not only will you trip a lot, but you’ll also use a lot of valuable
energy trying to lift those toes up all the time. An ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) is a
lightweight plastic brace worn inside your shoe that keeps your foot and toes
at the appropriate angle so that you don’t have to work so hard. An AFO is
made-to-order for you by an orthotist (a person who designs, fabricates, and
fits braces and other orthopedic devices prescribed by your physician). Even
though an AFO may not seem all that appealing at first (women like to cover
them up with slacks), you’ll pretty quickly find that its pros outweigh its cons.
Mobility aids such as canes, crutches, walkers, and motorized scooters also
help compensate for weakness. No one likes to think about needing these
kinds of aids, but they’re valuable tools for anyone who’s experiencing a lot
of weakness These aids can make it possible for you to conserve your energy
for the big stuff. And, besides, walking isn’t always the smartest or safest way
to get where you want to go. (Take a look at the section “Using Aids to take
charge of your mobility” later in the chapter.)
Sensory changes
Sensory changes such as numbness and pins-and-needles sensations in your
legs and feet can also interfere with walking. For example, it’s difficult to walk
comfortably and safely when you can’t feel the ground. Unfortunately, no
medications specifically deal with numbness. However, pins and needles may
respond to a medication like Neurontin (gabapentin) or Lyrica (pregabalin).
The best strategy is to wear whatever shoes provide you with the most com-
fort and the best “feel” for the ground. You also need to closely watch where
109
Chapter 7: Managing Fatigue, Walking Problems, Visual Changes, and Tremor

you’re going in order to avoid stubbing or stepping on surfaces that are too
hot or too sharp. If the sensory changes in your feet cause you to feel less
secure, a cane will provide greater stability.
Balance problems
Most problems with balance are caused by lesions in the cerebellum. Like
numbness, there are no medications to improve your balance. However, if
you find yourself stumbling, contact a physical therapist. He or she can rec-
ommend exercises to help improve balance.
For severe balance problems, mobility aids are the tools of choice. The specific
tool depends on how much support you need to be safe on your feet. A cane,
which provides support on one side of your body, may be sufficient. But, if
one-sided support isn’t enough for you, you can increase the support by using
two canes, crutches, or a walker. Each has its particular charm — check out
the “Using aids to take charge of your mobility” section to see what tweaks
your fancy. A physical therapist can help you identify the best tool for you
and teach you how to use it effectively.
Vision problems
If you can’t see where you’re going, you surely can’t walk around safely and
comfortably. Look at the section “Envisioning Solutions to Vision Problems”
earlier in the chapter for details on managing any visual symptoms that may
be interfering with your mobility.
Using aids to take charge of your mobility
Walking around is much more complicated than most people realize. If you
want walking to be safe and comfortable, a lot of stuff needs to be in good
working order. The thing is — and we mean this in all sincerity — walking can
be overrated. People walk to get where they want to go and do something
important after they get there. But, in all likelihood, you can still do those
things even if you use a different way to arrive at your destination.
Your best strategy is to think in terms of maximizing your mobility, even if
your walking isn’t as reliable as it used to be. Mobility aids come in all shapes
and sizes. They’re tools, just like lawn mowers, dishwashers, computers, and
vacuum cleaners. They (like lawn mowers, dishwashers, and any other tool
you can think of) exist to conserve energy and time and to help you do some-
thing more easily and efficiently. Your physical therapist can help you pick
the tools that will get you where you want to go.
MS is highly variable and unpredictable. You may need a mobility aid today
but not tomorrow, or this month but not next. Yes, MS is generally a progres-
sive disease, but it often travels in a roundabout path. For example, you may
110
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

need to use a walker or wheelchair during a severe exacerbation, but you
may be fine without one after the exacerbation has subsided. Luckily, rehabil-
itation specialists help you figure out what tools you need to remain mobile
during the attack, while also giving you an exercise regimen to get you back
on your feet ASAP.
Canes
A cane is used to support your weaker side, so the best strategy is to hold it
in your opposite hand. However, any old cane won’t do. While the style is
pretty much up to you, the cane definitely needs to be the right height to pro-
vide the support you need. Your physical therapist can help you figure out
what size cane you need.
People generally want a cane that looks as little like a cane as possible. So,
they look for decorative walking sticks (or do the decorations themselves) or
collapsible canes that can remain out of sight until needed. Keep in mind,
however, that a cane won’t be useful unless it does what you need it to do.
So, decorate it all you want, but make sure that the cane is sturdy enough to
support you, that the handle is comfortable to hold and gives you enough
surface to grip firmly, and that the tip doesn’t slip easily. If you need more
support than a regular cane can provide, you have the option of using a quad
cane, which has four small feet attached to a platform in place of the tip. Or
you can use two canes instead of just one.
A cane stored in your briefcase, the trunk of your car, or the back of your
closet doesn’t provide a whole lot of support. If you need it, bring it out of
storage and use it.
Forearm crutches
Forearm crutches (also called Lofstrand or Canadian crutches) are good if
you need more support than a cane can offer. They differ from standard
crutches in that they have a cuff that goes around your lower arm and a
handle perpendicular to the crutch that helps support your weight. Forearm
crutches don’t require as much upper arm strength as regular crutches or
canes so they help conserve valuable energy.
Walkers
A walker, which moves in front of you instead of to the side of you, provides
much more stability and requires much less energy than crutches or canes.
But, no one likes the idea of walker because the first image that comes to
mind is always an elderly person shuffling along with an aluminum walker
that makes quite a bit of noise. Fortunately, the walker options have
increased. Depending on your needs, you have the option of many brightly-
colored styles, complete with four wheels, handbrakes, a convenient seat for
resting when you get tired, and a basket to hold stuff.

Chapter 7: Managing Fatigue, Walking Problems, Visual Changes, and Tremor

Motorized scooters
Believe it or not, motorized scooters are actually designed primarily for
people who can walk! Scooter-lovers simply want a way to conserve energy
over long distances — sightseeing trips, visits to zoos and museums, long
“walks” in the country, and exhausting trips to the grocery store or mall. In
fact, many department stores and malls provide scooters on a first-come,
first-served basis for their customers. After you get where you want to go,
you can park your scooter and walk, with or without a cane for support. In
other words, a scooter is like a golf cart for everyday use.
Motorized scooters come in three-wheeled and four-wheeled styles, with a
wide variety of options in terms of size, weight, battery life, type of tire, and
color. Each style has its pluses and minuses, so it’s important to think care-
fully about how you’re going to use it. For example, a lightweight scooter that
goes easily in and out of the trunk of your car will have less battery power
than a heavier machine with bigger batteries. A scooter with heavy-duty tires
is ideal for outside use but unnecessary for inside your home or office. And
finally, a three-wheeled scooter may look more attractive to you, but they
generally offer less stability on turns and bumps than those with four wheels.
Here’s something else to keep in mind about a scooter: Even though you may
worry that using one will make you look “disabled,” people generally find that
driving a scooter helps them feel and look stronger, more stable, and more 
in control. When you’re confidently driving around in your spunky-colored
scooter, your loved ones don’t have to worry about you tripping or falling or
being able to keep up. In fact, they’ll generally have to run to keep up with you.
Wheelchairs
Before you panic at the mere thought of using a wheelchair, just remember
that sitting in one doesn’t mean that your butt gets glued there. You can use a
wheelchair when and if you need it, without worrying that sitting down from
time to time will cause your legs to get weaker or your walking to get worse.
And, you can use a wheelchair for short distances or long. Lots of people opt
to keep a folding chair in the trunk of the car in case they “run out of gas” or
know they’re going to be doing something strenuous.
Wheelchairs come in a variety of motorized and non-motorized styles,
depending on your needs and preferences. Motorized wheelchairs offer more
support and positioning options (sort of like the seat of your car) than
manual wheelchairs or scooters but are generally heavier and less portable
than the other options. Although most people never need to use a wheelchair
on a full-time basis, it’s good to know that there are safe, comfortable chairs
that allow people to work full-time, take care of their kids, travel around the
world, play sports, and even dance if they want to.
112
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

Even though most insurance policies do cover the cost of a wheelchair or
scooter, they generally don’t cover both. So, you need to think about which
type of mobility aid best meets your needs. If you decide that you need more
than one type, you’ll have to pay for the additional ones on your own.
Taming Tremor
Tremor is tough — of all the symptoms of MS, it’s probably the one with the
least satisfactory treatment options. It’s a close relative of the balance problems
caused by demyelination in the cerebellum. The most common tremor in MS is
called an intention tremor. This type of tremor is a relatively slow back-and-forth
movement of the hands, arms, or legs that occurs when you make a purposeful
(intentional) movement, such as reaching out to pick something up. When your
doctor has you do the finger-to-nose test (touching your index finger to the tip
of your nose several times rapidly), he or she is looking for tremor.
Folks with tremor can have a difficult time with daily activities, so it’s impor-
tant that you find healthcare professionals (generally a neurologist and an
occupational therapist) who’ll work with you to find a solution. The following
strategies are used for managing tremor:
 Medication: The challenge here is that many of the medications that
have been used to manage tremor are also pretty sedating, so you may
be trading tremor for sleepiness. The trick is to start with a low dose
and work up gradually until you get some relief. You may need to try
several different types of medication before you find something that
works for you. Here are some of the most commonly used medications:
• Atarax (hydroxyzine): Antihistamines such as this one may be
useful if your tremor is worsened by stress.
• Klonopin (clonazepam): The sedating properties of this drug may
help to calm the tremor down.
• Inderal (propranolol): This beta-blocker works for some people,
but it’s generally more useful with the other kinds of tremor that
aren’t seen in MS.
• Zofran (ondansetron): This antinausea medication works pretty
well but costs a fortune.
• Mysoline (primidone): This highly sedating medication, which 
has some antiseizure properties, sometimes helps when nothing
else does.
113
Chapter 7: Managing Fatigue, Walking Problems, Visual Changes, and Tremor

• Topamax (topiramate): This migraine medication, which is also
used to treat certain non-MS tremors, may provide some benefit
for intention tremor.
As you can see, the medication options aren’t great, but they’re all worth
trying.
 Mechanical options: Such options — which use physical or behavioral
strategies rather than medicinal ones — are offered by your occupa-
tional therapist (OT). Consider these tips:
• Stabilizing your forearm against your body, a table, or a chair may
be helpful because the tremor typically involves the entire arm.
• A brace may help reduce unwanted movements in your wrist
during particular tasks such as writing or eating, but the brace
should be removed after the activity is finished. Wearing the brace
full-time would reduce mobility in your joints and lead to weak-
ened muscles.
• Weighting, an option in which you attach light weights to your
wrists or ankles, provides stability and cuts down on your tremor.
You can also add weight to the object you’re using. Weighted uten-
sils, for example, can make eating easier, while a heavier pen can
improve your writing. Additional weights, of course, are more
tiring to use, so you need to balance your need for stability with
your need to conserve energy.
Unfortunately, none of these options eliminate tremor. Instead, your goal
is to find the strategies that minimize its impact on your daily activities.
For people with a severe tremor that hasn’t been helped by any of these 
medications or mechanical strategies, a technique called deep brain stimula-
tion (DBS) may be helpful. DBS involves brain surgery to implant wires deep
into specific brain regions that control movement. The wires are attached 
to an internal pacemaker-like device that can be programmed according to
the person’s need. This device is currently approved by the FDA only for
Parkinson’s disease, but it has been used successfully in some people with MS.

on’t panic! Bladder and bowel, sex, pain, and speech and swallowing
problems have nothing in common. We aren’t suggesting that they go
together or that you should expect to have all of them. However, if you
happen to have problems in any of these areas, we want to make sure that
you have the information you need to manage them effectively. And, because
these types of symptoms can sometimes be difficult to talk about (particu-
larly bowel, bladder, and sexual changes), we want you to feel prepared to
discuss them with your doctor or nurse without too much embarrassment.
So, in this chapter, we talk about all these symptoms and the best ways to
manage them.
Eliminating Elimination Problems
In case you’ve been experiencing some changes with bladder or bowel func-
tion and haven’t figured out why, here’s the skinny: Approximately 80 to 90
percent of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience a problem with
bladder function at one point or another. Bowel changes are less frequent,
but they’re still important to recognize and know how to manage. No one
likes to feel out of control, and we’re guessing that bladder and bowel control
are at the top of most people’s priority lists! Given how early toilet training

happens in life, it isn’t too surprising that problems in this area are so threat-
ening to self-confidence and self-esteem. This section talks about the types of
changes that can occur and suggests strategies to get you back in the driver’s
seat (and off the toilet seat).
Managing your bothersome bladder
Basically, you’ll come across two types of bladder problems in MS: Keeping it
in when you want to and getting it out when you want to. Sounds pretty
basic, doesn’t it?
Introducing the parts involved in the process
It turns out that there are some key players involved in peeing. For example:
 The kidneys remove waste products from your blood, producing approx-
imately one ounce of urine per hour.
 The bladder (a muscular sac resembling a balloon) gradually stretches
to hold the accumulating urine.
 The urethral sphincter is the gatekeeper for your bladder; it remains
closed until your bladder needs to empty, and then it opens to allow the
urine to pass out of your body.
 The urethra is the hollow tube that that the urine passes through on its
way out of your body.
When the plumbing is working . . .
When the urinary system is working without a hitch, here’s what happens:
1. After six to eight ounces of fluid have accumulated in your bladder,
nerve endings in the bladder wall send a signal — “It’s getting full in
here!” — to the area of the spinal cord that controls the voiding reflex
(which is also known as the urination reflex).
2. The spinal cord shoots a signal to your brain — “Time to find a 
bathroom!” — and you head in that direction.
3. When you’re ready, the brain talks back to the spinal cord, which, in
turn, sends two important messages: It tells the bladder to contract (to
push out the accumulated urine) and it tells the urethral sphincter
muscle (the gatekeeper) to relax and let the urine come out.
In other words, the nervous system circuitry needs to be in good working
order so that the necessary messages get where they need to go. And, the
bladder and the urethral sphincter need to work in complementary fashion.
But, as you can imagine, when MS lesions — areas of inflammation, demyeli-
nation, or neuronal damage in the brain and spinal cord — mess up the
works, various types of problems can occur.
116
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

When the plumbing isn’t working . . .
Bladder problems in MS can be divided into the following two types:
 Storage problems: These problems happen when the bladder is small
and overly active (spastic). Rather than expanding to hold the accumu-
lating urine, the bladder begins to contract as soon as a small amount
has been collected. And to top it off, the urinary sphincter keeps open-
ing to let the urine out. So, instead of a nice, relaxing trip to the bath-
room, you experience intense and frequent urges to pee — sometimes as
often as every 15 to 20 minutes. You may also experience dribbling or
even the occasional flood.
If you’re having this type of bladder problem, contact your neurologist,
urologist, or nurse specialist. He or she can give you medication to calm
the hyperactive bladder. Fortunately, you can choose from several med-
ications, so you and your healthcare professional can experiment to find
the one that provides the greatest benefit with the fewest side effects.
The most commonly used medications include: Ditropan (oxybutynin),
Detrol (tolterodine), Sanctura (trospium chloride), and Vesicare (solife-
nacin succinate), among others. Each of these medications can reduce
urinary frequency and the feelings of urgency so that you can get to the
bathroom more comfortably.
 Emptying problems: These problems happen when the bladder and the
urinary sphincter are out of sync with one another. When the bladder
contracts to push out the accumulated urine, the urinary sphincter con-
tracts rather than relaxing, trapping the urine inside. With this kind of
bladder, you may experience urinary frequency, urgency, dribbling, and
perhaps incontinence. You may also feel as though you need to urinate
but then find yourself sitting or standing there waiting (and waiting, and
waiting) for something to happen.
Contact your doctor if you’re having these emptying problems because
(as with storage problems) medication may help you. If your bladder
only retains a small amount of urine after your best efforts to empty it,
the problem may respond to Lioresal (baclofen), an antispasticity med-
ication that can help relax the sphincter.

Other valuable resources for 
symptom management
Take a look at the National MS Society’s List of
Publications (www.nationalmssociety.
org/pubcatalog) to find brochures about
each of the symptoms in this chapter. You can
download the publications from the Web site or
request them by calling (800) FIGHT-MS (800-
344-4867). Or check out Multiple Sclerosis: 
A Self-Care Guide to Wellness, 2nd edition, by
Nancy Holland and June Halper (Demos Medical
Publishing, 2005).

Otherwise, the best strategy for emptying the bladder involves intermit-
tent self-catheterization (ISC). Don’t faint — it’s really not as bad as it
sounds. You insert a plastic tube (about the size of a thin straw) into
your urethra (hint: for guys that’s through the opening in your penis; for
women, it’s through an opening above the vagina) and empty your blad-
der at a convenient time and place — generally every 4 to 6 hours or so.
It’s painless (yes, we really mean painless) and quick, so you can do it
anywhere you happen to be. ISC eliminates the unpleasant symptoms
and may actually improve your bladder function to the point that you no
longer need to do it. Your doctor may also prescribe a medication like
Ditropan (oxybutynin) or Sanctura (trospium chloride) to stop symp-
toms of urgency and to extend the length of time between catheteriza-
tions. In case you’re wondering, women have an easier time than men
getting used to the idea of ISC, but men find the procedure easier to
learn because they can actually see what they’re doing.
Determining which problem you’re suffering from
You may have noticed that storage problems and emptying problems cause
very similar symptoms, which means that neither you nor the healthcare pro-
fessional can tell what’s going on just from the symptoms you’re having.
The simplest procedure for diagnosing the problem is to measure the amount
of urine left in your bladder after you urinate (this leftover urine is called
residual urine). To do this, the physician or nurse either inserts a catheter to
remove and measure the residual urine, or does a bladder ultrasound to mea-
sure it. If the residual is less than 100 cubic centimeters (about three
ounces), the problem is generally with storage; if the residual is greater than
that, the problem is probably with emptying.
Both storage and emptying problems can have you scurrying to the bathroom
multiple times during the night. This problem is called nocturia. Because dis-
rupted sleep is a major contributor to fatigue in MS, taking care of your blad-
der symptoms will actually help solve two problems at once.
Staying on the lookout for urinary tract infections
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in one or more of the structures in
the urinary system. It’s a common problem in MS — so common, in fact, that
this is one of the first things your doctor will check any time your symptoms
act up (see Chapter 6 for more information about the role that infections and
fever can play in causing pseudoexacerbations of MS). Anyone with an empty-
ing problem is at risk for a UTI because urine that sits around builds up bacte-
ria. However, women are generally at greater risk for a UTI than men because
their anal, urethral, and vaginal openings are so close together (which is why
women are encouraged to wipe from front to back).
A mild UTI may cause nothing more than increased urgency and frequency of
urination. With a more significant infection, though, you may experience burn-
ing or discomfort when urinating or foul-smelling urine. You may also see
118
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

blood or mucous in the urine. Because so many of the symptoms of a UTI can
also be caused by other bladder problems, the doctor will culture a urine
specimen to look for bacteria. After the bacteria are identified, the doctor can
prescribe the appropriate antibiotic.
If you get an antibiotic for your UTI, be sure to take it for the full number of
days it has been prescribed because a UTI quickly recurs if it’s not fully treated.
Even worse is the fact that an untreated UTI can pose a serious threat to your
health.
Preventing urinary tract infections
The best way to deal with UTIs is to prevent them in the first place. Here are
some strategies you can try:
 Empty your bladder completely — by urination if you can and by ISC
if you can’t. Double-voiding may also help. For example, after you’ve fin-
ished peeing, wait a few seconds, stand up if you’ve been sitting down or
move a bit if you’ve been standing up, and then try again. The move-
ment can restimulate the urination process.
 Drink plenty of fluids. Many people with MS try to manage a misbehav-
ing bladder by cutting down on fluids. This is called the “If I don’t drink,
I won’t have an accident” philosophy. However, cutting back on fluids
causes the urine to become overly concentrated, which significantly
increases your risk of infection. Because liquids help flush wastes, min-
eral deposits, and bacteria from your system, we recommend drinking
six to eight glasses of water per day. Other fluids are okay too, but keep
in mind that caffeine, the aspartame in diet sodas, and alcohol are big-
time bladder irritants that will increase urgency and frequency.
 Keep your urine as acidic as possible. Acidic urine is less friendly to
bacteria. You can maximize acidity by increasing your daily intake of
protein, cranberries (or their juice), plums, and prunes, and by decreas-
ing your intake of citrus fruits and juices, milk and milk products, bever-
ages or antacids containing sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate,
and potatoes.
If you’re prone to recurrent UTIs, your doctor may prescribe a long-term, low-
dose antibiotic, such as Septra (sulfamethoxazole), to reduce the amount of
bacteria is your system.
Dealing with your bowel symptoms
Like bladder control, bowel control depends on a healthy nervous system in
which nerve signals flow smoothly between your gastrointestinal tract, spinal
cord, and brain.
119
Chapter 8: Handling Problems with Bladder and Bowel Function, Pain, and More

When the plumbing is working . . .
Here’s how the system is supposed to work:
1. The stomach partially digests the food you eat and then sends it to the
small intestine, which in turn sends it, with slow, propulsive movements,
to the large intestine.
2. After it makes its way to the large intestine, the food passes through four
sections, the last of which is called the sigmoid colon, where the fluids
are absorbed and a solid mass is formed. When the mass moves from
the sigmoid colon into the rectum, you feel the urge to have a bowel
movement.
3. After the rectum has filled, nerve endings in the rectal wall send mes-
sages to the spinal cord, which signals the internal sphincter (which is
normally closed) to open, allowing the mass to pass through the anal
canal. The internal sphincter is controlled by the spinal cord, which
means you don’t have conscious control over it. The external sphincter
(which is also part of the anal canal) is controlled jointly by the spinal
cord and brain, which gives you the control to decide when and where
to take care of business.
When the plumbing isn’t working . . .
When your various parts can’t “talk” to each other, normal bowel activities
can get messed up, and that’s when you need to contact your neurologist or
nurse. The most common problem is constipation. Diarrhea and incontinence
occur much less frequently.
Constipation, which is defined as infrequent (compared to your usual habits)
or difficult (painful or hard to pass) bowel movements, is caused by the fol-
lowing factors:
 Demyelination in the areas of the brain and spinal cord that control
bowel function. This demyelination can slow the process to the point
that too much fluid is withdrawn from the stool. The result is a hard, dry
mass that’s difficult and sometimes painful for you to pass.
 Symptoms that limit your mobility. Symptoms such as weakness,
fatigue, or stiffness slow bowel activity, which results in a dry, hard
stool.
 Limited fluid intake. When you stop drinking fluids in an effort to
manage your bladder problems, you deprive your body of the fluids it
needs to function properly. To make up for this, your body absorbs more
fluid from the stool as it passes through your system. The result, again,
is a hard stool that’s difficult to pass.
 Some medications. Certain medications, particularly those used to treat
bladder problems, may slow bowel activity and result in — you guessed
it — a hard stool that’s difficult to pass.
120
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

Diarrhea (loose watery stools) is actually uncommon in MS. If you experience
this kind of change, you and your doctor should be looking for a different
cause. What can happen in MS, however, is that moist stool from higher up in
the colon can leak out around hardened stool that’s trapped in your rectum.
In other words, the real problem is constipation rather than diarrhea.
Loss of bowel control can also occur in MS when your brain doesn’t receive
the necessary signals telling you that you need to go. Fortunately, this prob-
lem is pretty rare, and the same strategies that we talk about in the next sec-
tion will also help your avoid unpleasant accidents.
Developing a regular bowel regimen
The keys to comfortable bowel management are preventing the problems in
the first place and developing a regular bowel regimen. But, remember, “regu-
lar” doesn’t necessarily mean “daily.” Instead, it just means at an interval
that’s normal for you (probably every one to three days). The following
strategies will help you keep things moving along:
 Drink six to eight glasses of liquid per day.
 Eat a diet that’s high in fiber, such as raw fruits and vegetables, nuts,
seeds, and whole grain cereals and breads. (See Chapter 11 for more info
about healthy eating.)
 Pick a consistent time of day for a relaxed bowel movement. The ideal
time is about 20 minutes after a meal (breakfast is generally best because
you’re at home before the start of your busy day), when your natural
gastro-colic reflex is working to move contents through the bowel.
Using additional medications
Sometimes, even the best regimen in the world doesn’t solve the problem. If
this is the case for you, medications can be useful. But, the trick is to use the
least potent one that does the job — you don’t have to bring in the canons if
a BB gun will do. Work closely with your doctor or nurse to find the program
that works best for you. Some combination of the following over-the-counter
strategies may be the most helpful:
 Daily use of a high-fiber product like Metamucil or Citrucel may be suffi-
cient to promote regular bowel movements.
 Regular use of a stool softener like Colace can help with hard, dry stools.
 If the first two aren’t sufficient, a mild laxative, such as Pericolace or
Perdiem, can produce a bowel movement. Stronger laxatives should be
avoided if possible because they’re generally habit-forming.
 Glycerin suppositories may be sufficient to stimulate a bowel movement.
If that isn’t effective, a Dulcolax suppository may do the trick.
 Enemeez Mini-Enema is a lubricating suppository that safely stimulates
bowel action.
121
Chapter 8: Handling Problems with Bladder and Bowel Function, Pain, and More

You can occasionally use Fleet or other enemas to address a major blockage,
but you shouldn’t use them on a regular basis because your bowel may
become dependent on them.
Sizing up Sexual Symptoms
Because MS can affect your sexuality in a variety of ways, it’s an important
subject for us to talk about in case you experience any changes along the
way. In this section, we describe the kinds of problems that can occur and
then show you the strategies for dealing with them.
Identifying the changes you 
may be experiencing
Sexual feelings and responses are pretty complicated, even without MS. Like
the bladder and bowel functions we talk about in the section “Eliminating
Elimination Problems” earlier in this chapter, sexual feelings and responses
depend on healthy, intact wiring between the brain and spinal cord. They’re
also sensitive to other factors. For example, consider these all-to-familiar
statements: “I’m just not in the mood right now,” “Not right now honey, I have
a headache,” “I’m too tired to even think about it,” and “I hate my body.” In
other words, how you feel emotionally and physically, as well as how you feel
about yourself, can affect how you feel and respond sexually. And because all
of this is challenging even for people without MS, you can imagine how MS
symptoms might make things even more complicated.
Sexual changes are actually pretty common in MS. Approximately 85 percent
of men report at least occasional problems, with the most common being get-
ting or maintaining an erection. And, approximately 50 to 75 percent of
women report problems, the most common of which are loss of interest and
changes in vaginal lubrication and sensation.
When MS lesions get in the way
So, first things first: When everything goes smoothly, sex can feel pretty easy
and automatic — you don’t have to do much work because your body basi-
cally takes over. For example, when your body or mind is stimulated in a sexual
way, your body responds, and, if you’re male, you get an erection, and if you’re
female, you get vaginal lubrication and engorgement. The sexual excitement
builds to the point of orgasm and everything is hunky-dory.
However, when MS lesions damage the nerves that carry messages between
your brain, spinal cord, and whatever parts you happen to consider your
122
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

erogenous zones, the messages get short-circuited. And when the messages
get short-circuited, the following changes can happen:
 Things that used to turn you on may not do it for you anymore.
 Your mind may have sexy thoughts and feelings, but your penis or
vagina or nipples may not do their usual thing.
 You may not enjoy being touched or stroked on the same parts of your
body that you used to.
 Your body may feel aroused and ready to go but peter out along the way.
 Everything may be just fine except that you can’t seem to reach orgasm
(very, very frustrating after all that excitement and effort).
When MS symptoms — or the medications 
used to treat them — get in the way
Other MS symptoms can get in the way of your sex life too. Here are some
examples:
 If you’re overwhelmed by MS fatigue, just getting through the day may
be a chore and may leave you with little energy for sex.
 Stiffness in your legs may make all those kinky positions you used to
love virtually impossible.
 Sensory changes may cause parts of your body to respond to touch dif-
ferently than they used to so that something that used to feel good now
feels irritating or painful.
 If your bladder is giving you a lot of grief, you (not to mention your part-
ner) may be so worried about accidents that you’re unable to relax and
enjoy yourself.
 Depression can certainly put a damper on sexual feelings.
 Even cognitive changes can get in the way. If you’re having trouble main-
taining focus or you’re easily distracted, you may find maintaining sexual
arousal difficult (which is why guys are told to think about baseball scores
when they’re trying to postpone ejaculation as long as possible).
In addition to the MS symptoms themselves, some of the medications you
may be taking to manage those symptoms can also get in the way. For exam-
ple, consider the following:
 Antidepressant medications can interfere with arousal and orgasm.
 Antispasticity medications and medications to treat pain can make you
too tired to care.
123
Chapter 8: Handling Problems with Bladder and Bowel Function, Pain, and More

 Bladder medications can dry you up in more ways than one (dry mouth
and vaginal dryness are common side effects).
 The beta-interferon medications can cause flu-like symptoms that make
you just want to crawl into bed (alone) for a day or so.
When your own — or other people’s — attitudes get in the way
Today’s culture is filled with many loud and clear attitudes about sex. Everyone
is supposed to be young, healthy, thin, and sexually alluring. No flab, blem-
ishes, wrinkles, baldness, or infirmities of any kind are allowed. With these
messages coming at you from all sides, you may wonder how it’s possible to
be sexual now that you have MS. Consider these common reactions: “This
doesn’t even feel like my body any more. How can I be attractive to someone
else if I don’t feel attractive to me?” and “How can I feel sexy when I’m barely
keeping my head above water?” Sexuality begins in your mind (even though it
doesn’t usually feel that way) so being sexual when you have MS begins with
feeling comfortable with yourself and your body.
And chances are, you aren’t the only one in your relationship having hang-
ups about all this. Your sexual partner may be worried about hurting you or
tiring you out. Or, he or she may feel guilty or selfish about wanting to have
sex even though you’re tired. If MS has interfered with your relationship in
other ways — for example, by making it necessary for you to shift around
your roles and responsibilities a bit — you both may be finding it difficult to
sort out your feelings about each other and the relationship. All these feel-
ings and attitudes can get in the way of sexual feelings and expression.
Silence isn’t golden: Talking 
is the first step
The biggest roadblock to getting help with sexual problems is silence. Too
often, people tend to clam up about issues like this that make them uncom-
fortable. The best way to get the big white elephant out of your bedroom is to
begin talking about it with your doctor and your partner.
Talking with your doctor
Most MS specialists ask their patients about sexual symptoms because they
know that the problems are common. However, other physicians don’t. The
fact is that no one is all that comfortable talking about sex (not even doctors!).
And if you’re single or gay or lesbian, the subject is even less likely to come up.
Because your doctor may be one of those who’s uncomfortable talking about
sex, it’s probably going to be up to you to broach the subject in order to get
the information and help you need. If the very thought of talking about sexual
stuff with your doctor or nurse makes you cringe, you may want to take this
book or one of the National MS Society brochures about sexuality and intimacy
124
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

along with you to help the conversation along (you can find the brochures at
www.nationalmssociety.org/sex).
When you visit your healthcare professional, he or she will either make treat-
ment recommendations or refer you to a specialist for additional help. Some
urologists specialize in male sexual problems. And women are most likely to
receive the information and assistance they need from MS specialist nurses
or mental health professionals, or from their gynecologist.
Talking with your partner
Although communicating with your healthcare professional is very impor-
tant, talking with your partner should also be right up there on your priority
list. After all, it takes two to tango, and even the most loving partners can’t
read each other’s minds.
If you haven’t talked much about sex before, this is the time to start, because
changes in sexual feelings and responses can be easily misunderstood or mis-
interpreted. To illustrate our point, consider a common scenario:
Janice is incredibly exhausted. She finally gets the kids to sleep and can’t
wait to snuggle into bed and get some rest. Her husband, Phil, is looking for-
ward to a little play time with his beautiful wife. Janice can tell that Phil is
feeling affectionate and starts to worry. She loves him a lot, and never
wants to disappoint him, but the truth is, she hasn’t been that interested in
sex lately. She just hasn’t felt like herself — she’s so tired all the time, and
the last couple of times they had sex, she couldn’t really get into it. It felt like
someone had turned off the switch. She ended up just feeling let down and
frustrated. Sex had always been really good for them so she’s wondering
what’s wrong with her. Phil picks up on Janice’s negative vibes (the fact that
she’s facing away from him gives a pretty good clue) and starts to worry.
The sex wasn’t so great the last couple of times — he could tell that Janice
wasn’t having her usual fun time. Maybe he doesn’t turn her on anymore —
he’s not in as great of shape as he used to be. Or, maybe she finds him
boring after all this time. Or, maybe she’s having an affair. . . .
When worries and fears begin to build, it doesn’t take long for couples to find
themselves feeling pretty uncomfortable. For example, in this scenario, Phil
may begin to pull away emotionally because he doesn’t want to be rejected.
Then Janice may start to worry that Phil doesn’t love her or find her attrac-
tive any more. And the list goes on and on.
If you’re facing a similar situation, remember that communication has a much
higher chance of success than this type of attempted mind-reading, so find a
comfortable time and start the conversation. Use brochures from the National
MS Society to jump-start the process (you can find the brochures at www.
nationalmssociety.org/sex). Knowing that sexual changes can be a part
of MS may help clarify the situation and relieve you both about what’s going
on between the two of you.

Treating your sexual symptoms
Now that we’ve told you about all the sexual changes that can happen when
you have MS, you’re probably wondering what you can do to treat them. Well,
you’ve come to the right place. In this section we describe the management
strategies for each of the problems you may encounter. Because some of the
strategies are unique to one sex or the other, we talk about those first, and
then we describe the strategies that apply to everyone.
Ladies first
We’ll go ahead and get the bad news out of the way first: There’s no magic
bullet. Although the manufacturers of Viagra (sildenafil) tried very hard to
demonstrate its usefulness for women as well as for men, they stopped their
clinical trials in women after concluding that women’s sexual responses are
much more “complex” than men’s (surprise, surprise). Just remember that if
MS affects your ability to get aroused or reach orgasm, this is, in fact, a huge
loss — and this loss shouldn’t be minimized by you, your partner, or your
doctor. The good news is that many women find pleasure in closeness, cud-
dling, and sensual physical contact even if they can’t reach orgasm.
In the meantime, here are a few tips to enhance your comfort and pleasure:
 Get to know your own body very well from head to toe. For example,
figure out what feels good, what doesn’t feel good, what you enjoy, and
what’s definitely off-limits, and then share that information with your
partner. Through self-exploration, many women have discovered eroge-
nous zones they didn’t even know they had — like the crook of the

 Use a water-soluble lubricant such as Astroglide, KY Jelly, or Replens
to deal with vaginal dryness. Don’t scrimp — the more the better. But,
avoid petroleum jelly products because they can promote infection.
 If numbness or sensory changes are a problem, try getting some addi-
tional stimulation with a vibrator. Vibrators now come in many differ-
ent styles — surely one will be able to get you going. Don’t be bashful,
try one. Check out the sidebar for helpful resources.
If none of these tips work for you, you can try out some of the symptom man-
agement strategies that we talk about in the section “For all you lovers out
there” later in this chapter.
For the men
Erectile problems have recently hit prime-time television. Particularly if you
watch sporting events, you’ll be bombarded with commercials for the erection-
enhancing medications Cialis (tadalafil), Levitra (vardenafil), and Viagra (silde-
nafil). If you have difficulty getting or maintaining an erection, talk to your
doctor because one of these medications may be helpful for you. Clinical expe-
rience indicates that they’re effective for about 50 percent of men with MS.
Here are a couple of important things to keep in mind about these oral 
medications:
 These medications don’t increase sexual desire or cause erections to
happen. Instead, they allow an erection to occur when your penis is
stimulated. In other words, these medications increase blood flow to the
penis only after a sufficient amount of physical stimulation has occurred.
 Even though each of these medications is readily available over the
Internet, we strongly recommend that you consult with your physi-
cian before taking any of them. We say this because they can interact
with other medications you may be taking. For example, if you take a
nitrate medication such as Nitrostat or Transderm-Nitro to lower your
blood pressure, Cialis, Levitra, and Viagra can cause your pressure to
drop too far.
Injectable medications, such as Prostin-VR (alprostadil), papaverine, and
Regitine (phentolamine), are another option for treating erectile dysfunction.
When you want to have an erection, you inject the medication (with a very
fine needle) into a point at the base of your penis that’s relatively insensitive
(we know what you’re thinking, but it’s really not that bad). Most guys describe
the sensation as something like being flicked with a towel. Unlike the oral med-
ications, the injectables produce an erection within a few minutes, whether or
not you feel aroused or your penis has been stimulated, so many men prefer
this option. The erection usually lasts an hour or until you ejaculate.
127
Chapter 8: Handling Problems with Bladder and Bowel Function, Pain, and More

When using an injectable medication, keep the following cautionary facts 
in mind:
 Priapism (an erection that lasts too long) can occur with these medica-
tions. It’s important to adhere to the prescribed dose of medication and
use it only as your doctor recommends — in this case, more isn’t better.
An erection that lasts more than four hours can cause irreparable damage
to your penis (so contact your physician immediately if you run into this
problem).
 Approximately 7 to 10 percent of men develop scarring (in the form of a
small bump or nodule) at the injection site. However, proper training in
injection technique greatly reduces this risk. If you develop scarring of
this type, it’s important to discuss it with your doctor so that you can be
appropriately treated, because progressive scarring can lead to a curva-
ture of the penis. Luckily though, the nodule usually disappears after
you stop using the injections.
Other options for managing erectile dysfunction include surgically-implanted
penile prostheses that work mechanically rather than chemically, or a vacuum
tube that creates a vacuum around the flaccid penis to produce an erection.
For more information about all of these options, check out Multiple Sclerosis:
A Guide for Families, 3rd edition, by Rosalind Kalb (Demos Medical
Publishing, 2006.)
For all you lovers out there
Keep in mind that arousal doesn’t always have to come first. Sometimes,
engaging in a little sensual cuddling is enough to get your juices going even
when you think your arousal switch is in the off position.
Sometimes, however, arousal or performance isn’t the problem. Instead,
other MS symptoms may be getting in the way of your sex life. If this is the
case, do what you need to do to take care of them. Consider the following
problems (and solutions):
 Fatigue can put sex on the bottom of your priority list. However, man-
aging your fatigue effectively will give you more energy to get it on. Try
to plan sexual activity for times of the day when you have more energy —
even if it means getting up a little earlier in the morning to make time
before the busy day begins. (Check out Chapter 7 for more details on
managing your fatigue.)
 Stiffness or spasticity can interfere with comfortable positioning.
Flexibility is key to whatever acrobatics you might enjoy. You can do
stretching exercises or use medications to relieve your spasticity and
loosen up your limbs. (Flip to Chapter 7 for more tips to sidestep your
spasticity.)
128
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

 Bladder problems can put a damper on sexual activity. To avoid
embarrassing accidents (and to allow yourself to relax and be in the
moment), empty your bladder or catheterize yourself before you have
sex. Although some partners find the prospect of urinary accidents
pretty uncomfortable, most take it in stride after they understand what
the problem is and what you’re doing to take care of it. (Refer to the sec-
tion “Eliminating Elimination Problems” earlier in the chapter for more
ways to manage your badly behaved bladder.)
 Weakness can make sexual activity difficult and tiring. For example,
being on top may feel much more tiring than lying on your back, or lying
on your side may be the most restful of all. It’s a good idea to experi-
ment with different positions to find out what puts the least strain on
weakened muscles. This is one of those situations where it helps to
think creatively — just because you’ve always had sex one way doesn’t
mean it’s your only option. Who knows what you might discover!
 Cognitive changes can cause you to be distracted, which in turn
makes it difficult for you to become or stay aroused. So, it’s important
to create a sensual, distraction-free environment for sex. Unless you’re
watching a great sexy movie that turns you on, shut off the TV. Do what-
ever feels most soothing and sensual with the lights, and make sure you
aren’t going to be interrupted or distracted by goings-on in the house.
If you think your medications are getting in the way, the best place to start is
with a conversation with your doctor. Sometimes it’s possible to change the
dose or the timing of the dose in order to relieve a problem you’ve been having.
If, for example, you’re taking a bladder medication that causes vaginal dry-
ness or pain, or if you’re taking spasticity medication that makes you very
tired, the doctor may change the dosing schedule to make you more comfort-
able for sexual activity. If you’re taking an antidepressant that interferes with
sexual arousal or orgasm, you may be able to skip a dose before sex. While
this is definitely not recommended at the beginning of a major depressive
episode, it can work well for someone who has been comfortably stable on an
antidepressant for several weeks or months. So it’s possible to adjust your
medications, but only after talking with your doctor.
If your head is getting in the way — you’ve lost your self-confidence, you
don’t feel attractive any more, you’re too worried or preoccupied to think
about sex these days, or your partnership is under so much strain that sex
isn’t high on the priority list — chatting with a mental health professional can
be wonderfully helpful.
Sex is about more than just a few body parts, and intimacy is about more
than just sex, so fixing those parts is only half of the solution to MS-related
sexual changes. If you’re having trouble communicating, trusting one another,
or dealing with whatever changes the MS is causing in your relationship,
chances are that all the Viagra or Astroglide in the world won’t solve the
129
Chapter 8: Handling Problems with Bladder and Bowel Function, Pain, and More

problem. So, don’t be too bashful about talking with a couple’s therapist if
things are dicey — he or she can help you get back on track. (Refer to Chapter
3 for more on dealing with the feelings and reactions you’re having and to
Chapter 15 for details on what your partner or family may be going through
as well.)
Sidestepping Sensory 
Symptoms and Pain
MS can cause many different kinds of sensory changes, most of which are
annoying and uncomfortable but not serious. In other words, you may hate
them but they don’t indicate big-time disease progression, and they generally
aren’t incapacitating. For example, numbness and pins and needles in the
arms or legs are both very common. From the doctor’s perspective, there’s
no need to treat these symptoms unless they’re particularly bothersome, in
which case a short course of high-dose corticosteroids may be helpful.
Pain deserves prompt attention because it can be distracting, debilitating,
and depressing — and who needs that? For years, people were told that MS
doesn’t cause pain. Well, it does and it can have a significant impact on your
quality of life. At least 50 percent of folks with MS experience pain at one time
or another. Pain in MS can be divided into the following two main types:
 Primary pain: This pain, which is also called neuropathic pain is caused by
inflammation and demyelination along the sensory pathways in the brain
and spinal cord. In other words, this kind of pain has a neurologic basis.
 Secondary pain: This type of pain occurs as an indirect result of other
problems. For example, if your posture has changed as a result of weak-
ness or stiffness in your legs, you may begin to experience pain in your
back or hips.
Primary pain
Several different types of pain can occur as a result of damage to the nerves:
 Dysesthesias, the most common pain in MS, are achy, burning sensations
that generally occur in your arms, legs, or trunk. The “MS hug” is a tight,
band-like sensation around your chest or mid-section.
 Trigeminal neuralgia is a severe, lancing or stabbing pain in the face (in
the area of the trigeminal nerve).
 Lhermitte’s sign is an electrical sensation that some people with MS expe-
rience. This sensation travels down their spine and into their legs when
they bend their head forward.
130
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

Medications are the first-line treatment for neuropathic pain. The treatment
process requires somewhat of a try-and-see approach because pain is an indi-
vidual experience and people respond differently to the medications. The
usual strategy is to start at a low dose of one medication and work up to an
effective level. The key is to find a medication level that provides relief with-
out causing too much sleepiness or any other unpleasant side effects. Your
neurologist may recommend lower doses of more than one medication at a
time in order to maximize effectiveness while minimizing side effects.
Even though no medications have been specifically approved for the treat-
ment of MS pain, a wide variety has been used with some success:
 Antiseizure medications, including Tegretol (carbamazepine) and
Neurontin (gabapentin) are commonly used to treat trigeminal neuralgia
and dysesthesias.
 Lyrica (pregabalin) is FDA-approved to treat neuropathic pain from dia-
betes and is currently being studied in MS.
 Cymbalta (duloxetine hydrochloride) is FDA-approved for the treatment
of depression and for neuropathic pain caused by diabetes. It has been
used successfully for MS-related pain as well, particularly dysesthesias.
 Tricyclic antidepressants, including Elavil (amitriptyline), Norpramine
(desipramine), and Pamelor (nortriptyline) are also helpful with 
disesthesias.
For trigeminal neuralgia that doesn’t respond to any of the medications, the
doctor may recommend a surgical procedure called a percutaneous rhizotomy.
Although the procedure can be done in a variety of ways, the common goal is
to deactivate the trigeminal nerve sufficiently to block the sensation of pain.
Significant pain may also accompany certain symptoms of your MS. For exam-
ple, the muscle stiffness (spasticity) that’s so common in MS (take a look at
Chapter 7) can cause extremely painful spasms. These spasms can be man-
aged with the antispasticity medications baclofen and Zanaflex (tizanidine).
Valium (diazepam) can be particularly helpful for painful nighttime spasms in
the legs and feet. Optic neuritis (also described in Chapter 7), may be accom-
panied by severe eye pain that generally responds to a short course of high-
dose intravenous corticosteroids.
Primary pain doesn’t respond to the standard pain medications used for
injuries, such as aspirin, Tylenol (acetaminophen), or the various formula-
tions of ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil), because the source of the pain is differ-
ent. Primary pain also doesn’t respond well to narcotics.
Although medications of various types can be extremely useful for managing
your pain, you can also consider other alternative options. Acupuncture, for
instance, may be helpful for some types of pain (however it hasn’t be studied
131
Chapter 8: Handling Problems with Bladder and Bowel Function, Pain, and More

extensively in MS). Some people find meditation and other relaxation strate-
gies to be beneficial as well. (Flip to Chapter 10 for more on the ups and
downs of alternative medicine.)
Secondary pain
Secondary pain is pretty common in MS because weakness, spasticity, and
other MS symptoms can affect your whole musculoskeletal system. Your
neck, lower back, and knees are the usual suspects when it comes to prob-
lems. The best way to address this kind of pain is to try and prevent it in the
first place with the right types of exercise, careful attention to your posture
while walking and sitting, and optimal use of the correct mobility aids (when
needed). Your rehabilitation team (see Chapters 4 and 7) can recommend
strategies to help maintain your comfort and flexibility.
If and when you develop secondary problems with your neck, back, or knees,
it’s important to make sure that the healthcare professional who’s treating
you is aware of your MS and its relationship to the problems you’re having.
This is definitely a time when it’s helpful to get the professionals on your
team to talk to one another. For example, an orthopedist consulted about a
knee or back problem may recommend certain types of weight-bearing exer-
cise on the assumption that your difficulties are the result of weak muscles
when, in reality, the underlying problem has to do with impaired nerve con-
duction to those muscles.

Cannabinoids: Deriving benefits from marijuana
Cannabinoids are chemical derivatives of mar-
ijuana plants. Recent research efforts have
focused on trying to capture the benefits of
cannabinoids for various problems, including
neuropathic pain, while minimizing the side
effects and health risks associated with smoked
marijuana. Health Canada, the drug regulatory
agency for Canada, recently approved the 
use of Sativex, an oromucosal spray (which
means that it’s sprayed into the mouth and
absorbed through the mucous membrane),
developed from marijuana extracts by GW
Pharmaceuticals, for the treatment of MS-
related pain. The company hasn’t yet applied to
the U.S. Food and Drug administration for
approval, but it has been given the go-ahead by
the FDA to test the drug in the United States.
The approval in Canada was based on data indi-
cating that Sativex reduced central pain (pain
induced by damage or dysfunction in the brain
and spinal cord) and sleep disturbance in a
small, short-term study involving 66 people with
multiple sclerosis. A larger study is now under-
way in Canada. For more information about the
issues surrounding the use of marijuana and 
its derivatives for treatment of MS symptoms,
take a look at the National MS Society’s state-
ment on marijuana at www.nationalms
society.org/marijuana.

Many people with neck or back pain consult a chiropractor. Even though the
data from studies on chiropractic therapy suggest that it may benefit lower
back pain, you need to consult with your neurologist before beginning treat-
ment. Because of your MS, manipulations of your spine may not be in your
best interest.
Sorting out Speech and 
Swallowing Problems
Lesions in the brain can affect speech and swallowing. Even though these
types of problems are less common than many of the others we talk about in
this book, it’s important to be aware of them because they can have a big
impact on your quality of life — slurring your speech can definitely give
people around you the wrong impression, and nothing is more frightening
than randomly choking on your dinner. We talk about these problems together
because they’re evaluated and treated by the same clinician — the speech/
language pathologist (S/LP). Flip to Chapter 4 for more information about this
important member of the rehab team.
Speech and voice problems: 
Articulating the facts
Like the other functions we talk about in this chapter, normal speech and
voice quality depend on complex messaging in the central nervous system.
When the nerve impulses can’t travel where they need to go, speech and
voice quality become impaired. Approximately 25 to 40 percent of people
with MS experience these kinds of problems at one time or another. Dysarthria
is the term used to describe problems relating to speech production, such as
slurring, unclear articulation, and problems with volume control. Dysphonia
is the term for problems with voice quality, such as harshness, poor pitch
control, excessive nasality, increased breathiness, or hoarseness.
Problems with speech and voice quality can come and go during relapses or
periods of extreme fatigue. If you begin to experience any changes that interfere
with everyday communication, request a referral to an S/LP. Individualized ther-
apy techniques can relieve many of these problems, and the sooner you start
treatment, the better your outcome is likely to be. Your healthcare professional
or the National MS Society (800-FIGHT-MS or 800-344-4867) can refer you to
an S/LP with experience in MS.
133
Chapter 8: Handling Problems with Bladder and Bowel Function, Pain, and More

The S/LP will test the muscles in your mouth and throat that are necessary
for speech and will evaluate your respiratory function and your ability to
control pitch and loudness. He or she will also perform a motor speech evalu-
ation to determine if your breathing, voice production, articulation of words,
and flow of speech are working appropriately together. And lastly, the S/LP
will complete a communication profile to figure out what your communication
needs are at home and at work — for example, checking to see if you talk
mostly in one-on-one situations with people who know you well or if you
need to be able to communicate in large, noisy groups. Ultimately, the S/LP’s
goal is to ensure that you can communicate effectively with others whenever
and wherever you want to.
After the S/LP has identified whatever problems you’re having, he or she
develops an individualized treatment program for you, typically consisting of
a daily exercise routine for your lips, tongue, soft palate, vocal cords, and
diaphragm. He or she may also give you some strategies to compensate for
any problems you’re having with speech clarity. If necessary, the S/LP may
also recommend certain medications to help manage the problems. An anti-
spasticity medication like Lioresal (baclofen) or Zanaflex (tizanidine) may
help if your problems with voice quality and loudness are caused by spastic-
ity. If tremor in your vocal cords, jaw, lips, or tongue is causing the problem,
the doctor may recommend a medication such as Klonopin (clonazepam).
And, finally, if fatigue is contributing to your problems with voice control and
volume, you may find amantadine or Provigil (modafinil) useful.
For more detailed information about the assessment and treatment of speech
problems, take a look at the book Multiple Sclerosis: The Questions You Have;
The Answers You Need, 3rd edition, by Rosalind Kalb (Demos Medical
Publishing, 2004).
Watching out for swallowing problems
Swallowing isn’t as simple as it seems — in fact, the process involves about
30 muscles in your mouth and throat and eight of your cranial nerves. So, as
you can imagine, MS lesions can interfere at any point in the process, from
when you put food in your mouth to when it arrives in your stomach.
When the nerve impulses that make swallowing possible aren’t working cor-
rectly, you develop dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing. When this happens, food
can pass into your airway and lungs, causing you to choke and cough. Over
time, particles of food that remain in the lungs can cause aspiration pneumonia,
(we talk about this serious complication in Chapter 13). Fortunately, most
people with MS won’t develop this kind of serious problem. But, if you notice
that your eating has become much slower, you have difficulty swallowing 
134
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

different kinds of food (liquids, for example, may give you more problems
than solids, or certain kinds of solid foods may cause you more difficulty
than others), or you find yourself coughing a lot during or after meals, ask
your doctor for a referral to an S/LP.
The S/LP will evaluate your swallow with a test called a videofluoroscopy (also
referred to as a modified barium swallow), that tracks via X-ray a bolus of
food as it travels from your mouth down to your stomach. Depending on the
type of problem you’re having, the S/LP can teach you safe swallowing exer-
cises that improve muscle coordination during swallowing and recommend
modifications in the way you eat or the consistency of the foods you eat.
For more detailed information about the management of swallowing problems,
take a look at the book Multiple Sclerosis: The Questions You Have; The Answers
You Need, 3rd edition, by Rosalind Kalb (Demos Medical Publishing, 2004).

Getting Your Head around
Problems with Thinking and Mood
In This Chapter
 Dealing with cognitive impairment
 Understanding how cognitive changes are evaluated and treated
 Keeping mood swings and other emotional changes in check
 Treating and overcoming depression
T
alk about adding insult to injury! Not only can multiple sclerosis (MS)
cause a wide variety of physical symptoms, it can also affect the way
people think and feel emotionally. It’s important to understand what these
changes are, and how they may affect you because early recognition and
treatment are key to managing these symptoms successfully.
In this chapter, we discuss the ways that MS can affect your cognition and
describe how these problems are evaluated and treated. We also talk about
the mood changes that are so common in MS, with particular emphasis on
strategies for managing mood swings and depression.
Handling Problems with 
Thinking and Memory
For many people, the idea that MS can affect the way they think is the most
frightening aspect of this disease. “I can handle the physical symptoms, just
don’t mess with my mind” is a pretty common refrain. Surprisingly enough,
cognitive changes weren’t even acknowledged or addressed by the medical
community until about 25 years ago (which is somewhat perplexing given that
Jean-Martin Charcot noted these symptoms in his early descriptions of MS in
the late 1800s). For years, patients were told that MS couldn’t affect the mind
or that it did so only rarely. But fortunately, MS researchers and clinicians
have finally begun to focus significant attention on this important problem.

As you read about cognition in the following sections, remember that cogni-
tive dysfunction isn’t an emotional disorder — a person can have problems
with thinking and memory without having an emotional problem.
Defining cognition
The term cognition refers to the higher-level functions of the human 
brain, including:
 Processing incoming information (attention and concentration)
 Acquiring, storing, and retrieving new information (learning and memory)
 Organizing and manipulating information to prioritize and problem-solve,
as well as plan and execute complex activities (executive functions)
 Acting on information and communicating it to others (expression)
Even though the list makes these functions sound separate and independent,
remember that they’re in fact interdependent. For example, you can’t remem-
ber something without having paid attention to it in the first place; you can’t
organize information in an effective way if you can’t remember it; nor can you
deal with information effectively or communicate it to others without having
learned and organized it in a meaningful way. Therefore, problems in any one
of these functions can affect how you think and perform.
Understanding how MS can 
affect your cognition
Research studies on cognitive function in MS have demonstrated that as
many as 50 to 66 percent of people will experience some cognitive changes
over the course of the disease. Even though the severity of these changes 
can vary from mild to quite severe, we’re happy to report that the majority of
these changes are in the mild-to-moderate range. So, don’t panic. The follow-
ing sections give you the information you need to recognize any problems
that you may be having and figure out what to do about them.
It’s important to familiarize yourself with the kinds of changes that can 
occur because:
 Cognitive changes can occur at any time, and their severity doesn’t
appear to correlate with either length of time since diagnosis or the
level of a person’s physical disability. For example, a person with signifi-
cant physical limitations, who has had MS for some time, can be totally
free of cognitive symptoms, while a person with a recent diagnosis and
few physical symptoms can have significant cognitive impairment.
138
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

 Even relatively mild symptoms can have a pretty big impact on vari-
ous activities of daily living. For instance, people with MS are more
likely to leave the workforce because of cognitive symptoms and fatigue
than because of mobility problems! Early departure from the workforce
is a critical issue for people with MS, but it can often be avoided with
adequate symptom management (see Chapter 18 for details).
 Cognitive fatigue can interfere with your ability to get things done.
Research has shown that people with MS who are concentrating very
hard on a cognitively strenuous task can experience a kind of mental
fatigue that feels like acute “brain drain.” Fortunately a brief rest from
the task will generally help you get back on track.
 Cognitive changes tend to progress slowly over time. Even though MS
relapses can include a sudden worsening of cognitive symptoms as well
as physical ones, which tend to improve as a relapse ends, problems
with thinking and memory don’t generally disappear completely.
 The sooner these kinds of cognitive problems are identified, the
easier it is to develop effective strategies to manage them. Small 
problems are always easier to work around than bigger ones. When
you’re able to put your finger on a problem with thinking or memory
early on, you can find ways to compensate for it before the problem
begins to interfere significantly with your daily life.
Like the physical symptoms that can occur in MS, the cognitive changes are
highly variable from one person to another. One person may experience a 
lot of problems while another person experiences none or very few. In other
words, no two people experience the same changes in exactly the same way.
However, the following types of problems are the most common in MS.
Memory
Memory is the function that seems to be most affected in MS. Even though
memory is a complex process involving many different components, the
major impairment in MS is in learning and retaining new information, which 
is why people complain that they can remember everything that happened 
20 years ago but not what happened this morning.
Until fairly recently, experts believed that the primary memory problem for
people with MS was with the retrieval of information that had been stored 
in memory. In other words, these experts believed that a person could learn
new information and tuck it away in memory, but then be unable to recall or
retrieve it from storage when needed.
More recent evidence suggests that the problem may involve the initial learn-
ing phase. People with MS may need longer time or a few more repetitions to
learn and store new information successfully. After it has been stored, how-
ever, it can generally be recalled without difficulty. For example, if you have
139
Chapter 9: Getting Your Head around Problems with Thinking and Mood

memory problems, it may take you longer than someone without memory
problems to memorize a list of words. But once you have the words memo-
rized, you’ll remember them just as well as the other person does.
Information processing
Slowed processing is important because it may be the primary reason why 
a person with MS needs more time or repetitions to learn new information.
When processing is impaired, the person has trouble keeping up with incom-
ing information, whether it’s from conversations, TV shows, or books. People
describe this slowing by saying, “I can still do everything I used to be able to
do, but it all seems much slower — like my brain needs to be oiled.”
Attention and concentration
Attention and concentration, which form the basis for many other cognitive
functions, can also be impaired by MS. For example, people who are used to
being able to focus on many complex and competing tasks at the same time
may notice some frustrating changes, such as being easily distracted by
interruptions or competing stimuli, having difficulty moving smoothly from
one task to another, or finding it more difficult to multi-task (an essential skill
in any occupation, particularly parenthood).
Executive functions
Executive functions include the high-level processes of planning, prioritizing,
and problem-solving. Research has shown that people with MS may find
thinking through complex problems or projects more difficult because they
lose the mental agility to shift from concept to concept along the way. People
often describe this impairment as “feeling stuck” or “lost in a maze.”
Visual perceptual skills
Visual perceptual skills, which include simple perception or recognition of
objects, as well as sense of direction and orientation in space, can be affected
in MS. These problems can interfere with activities ranging from reading a
map or driving, to programming your VCR or dealing with those pesky “some
assembly required” projects.
Verbal fluency
Verbal fluency includes the ability to find the word you’re looking for quickly
and easily. “It’s on the tip of my tongue” is a particularly common complaint
from those who have MS, as is “I’m talking to someone and all of a sudden I’m
stuck without the word I need.” People who experience these kinds of prob-
lems may feel less confident about their ability to talk smoothly and comfort-
ably with others.
140
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

General intelligence
People with MS sometimes say they feel “dumber.” The good news is that gen-
eral intelligence is usually not affected in MS. However, individual functions
that make up general intelligence, such as memory, reasoning, or perceptual
skills, can be affected or slowed temporarily during a relapse or more perma-
nently over the course of the disease. So, a person’s intelligence quotient (IQ),
which is a composite score made up of individual subtest scores on all these
functions, can become lower over time. The fact that several of the subtests
rely heavily on speed and dexterity also contributes to lower IQ scores in
those individuals who are experiencing problems with manual dexterity. This
impact on IQ scores is important to know about because a drop in IQ score is
one of the factors that’s used to determine eligibility for Social Security
Disability Insurance, which is discussed in Chapter 18.
Deciding when an evaluation is in order
Taking a bunch of tests to see how your brain is working may not be your
idea of fun, but consider some of the reasons why you may decide to go for 
it anyway:
 When the neurologist asks you to remember three words or count 
backwards by 7s (part of the brief mental status exam that neurologists
sometimes do to evaluate cognition, which picks up only very severe
problems), you do just fine. But you’ve been experiencing some worri-
some changes, and you want to understand what’s going on.
 You’ve received some feedback from family members or colleagues that
you aren’t quite up to snuff these days.
 Your job has become more difficult and you want to figure out what’s
going on and address the problem before your boss addresses it for you.
 You’re considering a career change because of difficulties you’ve begun
to experience in your current work. An assessment of your strengths
and weaknesses can help you identify other potential career paths.
 You’re considering applying for Social Security Disability Insurance
(SSDI) and you know that cognitive dysfunction is one of the four factors
that determine eligibility for a person with MS (check out Chapter 18 for
more information on SSDI).
 You aren’t experiencing any problems at the moment but you know that
MS can affect a person’s cognition and you want to establish a baseline
against which to compare future evaluations.
The most important thing to know about a comprehensive cognitive 
evaluation is that it gives you valuable information about your strengths as
well as any areas of difficulty. This information comes in handy as you begin
to develop strategies to compensate for any problems you’re experiencing.
141
Chapter 9: Getting Your Head around Problems with Thinking and Mood

Knowing what to expect 
during an evaluation
The cognitive evaluation is a series of tests (generally referred to as a test 
battery, which includes paper-and-pencil items and puzzles of various types)
that’s designed to evaluate the full range of cognitive functions. Evaluations
are performed by neuropsychologists as well as some occupational thera-
pists (OTs) and speech/language pathologists (S/LPs). Even though the three
disciplines approach the evaluation process a bit differently, and use some-
what different tests, all are interested in evaluating how and to what degree
cognitive changes are affecting your ability to function at home and at work.
(Flip to Chapter 4 to read more about these professionals.)
A full cognitive evaluation can take six to eight hours to complete, but it’s
generally spread out over a couple of days to minimize the effects of fatigue.
Also, shorter test batteries can be used to determine whether the more
extensive battery is warranted. Your neurologist may be able to refer you to 
a local clinician for the evaluation. Otherwise, the National MS Society can
provide a list of neuropsychologists, OTs, or S/LPs in your area who have
experience in MS (call 800-FIGHT-MS or 800-344-4867). If no one in your area 
is familiar with MS, you can also see a brain injury specialist because some 
of the symptoms are similar and the test battery is virtually the same. Full
evaluations can be quite expensive, so make sure you discuss cost, payment
options, and insurance coverage ahead of time.
The test items are designed to tap your abilities and limitations. You’ll likely
find that some are easy for you and others much more difficult — just like the
mix you had on your standardized tests in grade school and the SATs later
on. You may also find — if you’re in fact experiencing cognitive changes —
that some tasks that you once found easy now seem more difficult.
The clinician doing the testing will carefully study your test results and com-
pare them to data from the general population of people in your age bracket.
He or she will also use your school and work history, as well as the results 
of the certain tests to determine what your abilities were prior to MS, and
which, if any, seem to have changed from that baseline. Most importantly, 
the clinician will use your scores to determine your cognitive strengths —
because these strengths will be your most powerful tools to compensate for
any deficits you may have.
Let’s say, for example, that you have a lot of trouble remembering stuff from
telephone conversations or meetings (auditory memory), but you have a
phenomenal memory for stuff you see or read (visual memory). In this case,
notes, pictures, or other visual cues could be helpful memory aids for you.
Or, maybe you have memory problems but you’re a whiz at organization. You
can figure out ways to substitute organization for memory in many areas of
daily living. (See the section “Employing practical strategies for managing
daily cognitive challenges” later in the chapter for more details.)

Identifying treatment options
So you’re probably wondering what you do with all this evaluation info once
you have it. You’ll work with your doctor as well as the clinician who evalu-
ated you to decide on a treatment plan that works for you.
The treatment of cognitive symptoms falls into three categories:
 Symptomatic treatments: Even though a variety of medications have 
been evaluated, only the drug Aricept (donepezil), which is FDA-approved
for treatment in Alzheimer’s disease, has shown some modest (but not
spectacular) benefit for MS-related memory problems.
Because the cognitive problems that occur in MS are completely 
unrelated to Alzheimer’s disease, there’s no particular reason to expect
great things from Aricept, but some neurologists are happy for their MS
patients to give it a try.
 Disease-modifying therapies: These therapies — the interferons
(Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif) and Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) — have
all been shown to reduce the number and severity of attacks and to
reduce central nervous system lesions as shown on MRI scans.
Because there’s fairly extensive evidence to show that cognitive problems
correlate to the total amount of lesion area in the brain (referred to as
lesion load), it’s reasonable to assume that starting a disease-modifying
therapy early in the disease would be a good strategy for reducing the 
risk and progression of cognitive symptoms. So, if you don’t already have
reason enough to start treatment with one of the disease-modifying thera-
pies, this could be the powerful incentive you need. (Check out Chapter 6
for more details on these therapies.)

Finding additional information about cognition
If you want to read more about MS-related cog-
nitive changes, check out the following resources
for some firsthand accounts of personal experi-
ences, info about the research that’s being done,
and a variety of strategies to help you compen-
sate for any changes you’re experiencing:
 The National MS Society’s Web Spotlight on
Cognition at www.nationalmssociety.
org/cognition.
 Multiple Sclerosis: Understanding the Cognitive
Challengesby Nicholas LaRocca and Rosalind
Kalb (Demos Medical Publishing, 2006). This
book is a guide to symptoms, assessment,
treatment, and management strategies.
 Improving Your Memory For Dummies by
John Arden (Wiley Publishing, 2002).

 Cognitive remediation: This type of treatment, which is also called 
cognitive rehabilitation, is a practical, solution-oriented approach to
managing cognitive changes. Offered by neuropsychologists, OTs, and
S/LPs, cognitive rehabilitation consists of the following interventions:
• Restorative interventions: These interventions are like physical
therapy for the brain. The clinician uses your test results to iden-
tify areas of deficit and then gives you exercises that may help
strengthen the impaired functions.
The best examples of this kind of intervention are computerized
exercises to improve attention and memory. Even though the
research has shown that people’s performance on certain types 
of tasks improves with these exercises, the improvements don’t
carry over very well to everyday life. After all, how many people
live their lives in front of a computer screen in a quiet room with
no distractions?
• Compensatory interventions: These seem, by all accounts, to be the
most useful. They consist of finding workarounds, or strategies to
compensate for whatever cognitive ability has been compromised. In
the same way that people use calendars to help themselves remem-
ber dates, address books to help keep track of contact information,
and computers to make it easier and faster to process information,
the cognitive rehabilitation specialist can help you can identify tools
and strategies to compensate for whatever problems you’re having.
Although there are an unlimited variety of workaround possibili-
ties, the most common ones involve substituting organization for
memory — for example, lists, filing systems, work and family calen-
dars, and “tickler” mechanisms, such as alarms on your watch or
computer to remind you to take a medication or go to an appoint-
ment. The remediation specialist can also recommend strategies to
improve attention, reading comprehension, executive functions,
and others.
Other factors like depression and stress also can affect cognition, so be sure
to talk with your doctor if you’re concerned that either of these problems
may be interfering with your thinking or memory. You can read about ways 
to manage depression later in this chapter. (Flip to Chapter 12 for information
about stress management.)
Employing practical strategies for 
managing daily cognitive challenges
Even though there’s no substitute for working with a specialist to identify 
and design effective compensatory strategies, here are some common sense
suggestions that you can use to begin managing any difficulties you may be
144
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

having. Your first step is to get comfortable with the idea that it’s okay to do
things differently — creative flexibility is your key to success. From there:
 Develop a personal organizer (paper or electronic) that has your impor-
tant information in one place, including appointments, contact informa-
tion, to-do lists, a tickler system for birthdays and anniversaries, and
whatever else you need.
 Create a family calendar to track everyone’s activities, and make each
family member responsible for writing down the important stuff.
 Set up a filing system to organize important papers so that everything
has its place.
 Deal with the mail on a daily basis to avoid unnecessary accumulation
(sort out the junk and put the important stuff in a safe place).
 Create a system to process incoming bills, including a tickler system to
ensure that they’re paid on time.
 Establish a consistent “home” for glasses, keys, and wallets to avoid
endless hunting expeditions.
 Create a computerized master checklist for repetitive tasks such as 
grocery shopping or packing for a trip.
 Establish a file of driving directions to carry with you in your car.
 Create a distraction-free zone in the house for tasks or conversations
requiring concentration.
 Schedule your day so that the activities requiring the most cognitive effort
can happen when you’re at your best, which is often earlier in the day.
 Make sure that each telephone in the house has a pen and pad of paper
near it.
 Create step-by-step project templates to help you stay on track with
multistep tasks such as preparing a meal, balancing your checkbook,
preparing your income taxes, and planning a vacation.
Managing the Emotional Ups and Downs
In addition to the array of emotional reactions that people can have to a chal-
lenging disease like MS (take a look at Chapter 3 for a rundown of the most
common), some important kinds of emotional changes seem to be part of the
disease itself. The distinction between reactions and changes is an important
one because many people find it easier to seek help for emotional issues that
they know are part and parcel of their MS.
145
Chapter 9: Getting Your Head around Problems with Thinking and Mood

The kinds of changes we talk about in this section don’t have anything to do
with being a sissy or with being crazy or weak. Instead, they’re emotional
symptoms that can often be caused by the same changes in the central ner-
vous system that cause the physical and cognitive symptoms we talk about
earlier in this chapter and in Chapters 7 and 8.
Controlling mood swings
Mood swings are by far the most common emotional change seen in people
with MS. Even though these moods are much less intense than the mood vari-
ations seen in bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive disorder),
they can be very uncomfortable for people with MS and their family mem-
bers. People describe themselves (and their partners and children are happy
to verify it) as unusually moody, irritable, cranky, and quick-to-anger. (By the
way, bipolar disorder is more common in MS than in the general population.)
Even though it’s certainly true that a person with MS can have a lot to feel
cranky about, particularly if it’s been a bad day, many of the mood swings in
MS seem to bear little relationship to the severity of the disease or to day-to-
day symptom activity. In other words, these mood swings sometimes seem to
happen out of the blue — as if they have a mind of their own.
Here are some strategies that people with MS have found useful for dealing
with mood swings:
 Talk it up: Even though your mood swings may be neurologic in origin,
they can still be relieved somewhat by talking about them. In support
groups, for example, people share their stories, discover how other
people have dealt with their mood issues, and generally get more com-
fortable with the idea that mood swings are just one more aspect of MS
146
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 
Letting loose on the unsuspecting
This brief story shows that even the most pleas-
ant people can become moody and irritable:
One of our patients was standing in a grocery
aisle trying to decide between two brands of
laundry detergent. Because of problems with
attention and distractibility, his efforts were
hampered by the hustle and bustle in the store
and by two women who were talking loudly sev-
eral feet away from him. Finally, overcome with
frustration, he loudly shouted, “Shut up!” This
very polite, generally mild-mannered man was
extremely surprised and embarrassed by his own
behavior. He said of himself that he no longer had
the same control over his emotions — he felt as
though the nuts and bolts had been loosened a
bit. Others have described themselves as feeling
raw, or super-sensitive to irritants around them.
If you’re experiencing increased irritability or
uncomfortable bouts of temper, be sure to let your
doctor know.

that they need to come to terms with. So, talking about your mood
swings actually gives you more of a sense of control over them.
 Identify your triggers: It’s also important to pay attention to the things
that seem to trigger your mood swings. For example, if particular situa-
tions make you tense or irritable, it’s a good idea to try to create a buffer
for yourself — remove yourself from the situation, practice some deep
breathing or meditation, or speak up about what’s bothering you.
 Get moving: Exercise can be very beneficial. A significant body of
research in MS points to the benefits on mood of both cardiovascular
exercise (which is of course geared to a person’s abilities and limita-
tions) and yoga. And, in the end, almost everyone feels better when
they’re getting sufficient exercise.
 Discuss meds with your doc: When the mood swings don’t respond to
any of the other interventions, a low dose of Depakote (depakene) can be
very effective. This medication, which is primarily used to treat seizures,
seems to make the swings less dramatic and helps people feel more like
themselves again. An antidepressant medication may help as well. So, if
you’re experiencing uncomfortable mood swings, don’t hesitate to tell
your physician.
Getting a handle on uncontrolled 
laughing or crying
Uncontrolled laughing or crying, which is a relatively uncommon phenome-
non, has been given many different names over the years, including emotional
incontinence (but no one liked that term very much), pathological laughing and
crying (they didn’t like that too much either), pseudobulbar affect (because of
the area of the brain that’s thought to be involved), and most recently, involun-
tary emotional expression disorder (IEED).
This kind of uncontrolled laughing or crying is thought to result from damage
in the prefrontal cortex of the brain that interferes with the corticobulbar
tracts (which control emotions), and it occurs in about 10 percent of people
with MS. Even though it’s generally (but not always) found in those with more
progressive disease and significant cognitive changes, it’s equally common in
both women and men.
When a person experiences this kind of uncontrolled laughing or crying, he
or she cries without feeling sad or upset or laughs without feeling amused or
happy. And once started, the laughing or crying can’t be stopped voluntarily.
For obvious reasons, this involuntary behavior can be extremely upsetting
and embarrassing for the person with MS (and for anyone else who happens
to be in the room). Imagine for a moment how it would feel to burst out
laughing at your mother-in-law’s funeral or your boss’s retirement party, or 
to cry in the middle of a business meeting or blind date.
147
Chapter 9: Getting Your Head around Problems with Thinking and Mood

As with the mood swings that are so common, it’s important to remember
that uncontrolled laughing or crying isn’t a sign of craziness or stupidity or
any of the other labels that may come to mind. And people with this problem
are no more depressed than other people with MS.
Over the years, doctors have tried a variety of medications to control these
uncontrolled episodes of laughing and crying. Even though people who 
experience them aren’t clinically depressed, the medications that have been
most effective were the antidepressants Elavil (amitriptyline) and Prozac
(fluoxetine). Sinemet (levodopa), a drug used in Parkinson’s disease, has also
been used. Most recently, an experimental drug that’s a combination of dex-
tromethorphan and an enzyme inhibitor to sustain an effective level of the
dextromethorphan is being studied for the treatment of uncontrolled laugh-
ing and crying. So, if you (or a family member) are experiencing this problem,
be sure to consult a physician.
Dealing with severe depression
We’re going to spend a lot of time talking about depression here — not to
depress or upset you — but to get your attention and clarify what’s meant 
by the term.
Defining depression
Severe depression is common in MS — significantly more common, in fact,
than in the general population or with other chronic diseases. More than 50
percent of people with MS will experience a major depressive episode at some
point during the illness. Did that get your attention? Depression is generally
unrelated to the time since diagnosis or to the level of disability. In other
148
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 
Crying when there’s nothing to cry about
One of our patients found herself crying when-
ever she was in an emotionally charged situation.
Whether trying to have a conversation with her
boss, a small disagreement with her husband, or
a motherly conversation with the teenagers, she
always seemed to break out into tears. This
bright, articulate, and capable woman became
extremely self-conscious in any situation that
might elicit the unwanted response.
After we determined that she wasn’t depressed
or otherwise distressed, we suggested that she
focus on identifying and heading off the emotional
build-up that seemed to precipitate the tears.
With this suggestion, she became adept at sens-
ing the increase in emotional tension, and would
subsequently take a timeout to breathe deeply.
Even though it was a tad embarrassing to have to
say to people, “Just give me a minute here to
gather my thoughts,” it was a lot less embarrass-
ing than bursting into uncontrolled tears.

words, it can occur early in the disease in people with little or no disability.
This means that it isn’t just a reaction to the challenges of living with a
chronic, unpredictable disease, but also a symptom of the disease itself.
What do we mean by depression? For starters, remember this: Many people
use the term casually in everyday conversation — “I’m so depressed,” “This
job is really depressing me,” or “This book is so depressing” — that they tend
to lose sight of what depression really is.
So, we’re not talking about having a down day or feeling discouraged or blue
about a lousy date, a disappointment at work, a bad exam grade, or even a
chronic disease. What we’re talking about is a serious medical condition,
referred to as clinical depression or major depression, which can have signifi-
cant consequences on your health and well-being. People who are depressed
carry an additional, unnecessary emotional burden. They can’t enjoy life, par-
ticipate actively in their own care, or plan or problem-solve effectively. And
they’re difficult to live with.
When left untreated, severe depression can even lead to death. Studies have
indicated that the rate of suicide in MS is over seven times higher than in the
general population. In fact, it’s one of the leading causes of death in MS after
cancer, heart disease, and stroke.
Recognizing the signs
Depression differs from the normal grieving we talk about in Chapter 3, but 
it can be difficult to differentiate on a day-to-day basis because some of the
feelings are so similar. Depression also differs from the mood swings we talk
about in this chapter. But, again, it may be difficult to distinguish between 
the two because depression can manifest itself in ways other than sadness 
or melancholy (for example, it can be shown through irritability and sullen-
ness). The key element that distinguishes depression from these other mood
states is its persistence over an extended period of time.
For the doctor to diagnose a major depressive episode, a person must have
experienced at least five of the following nine symptoms (one of which must
be either depressed mood or decreased interest) for most of the day every
day for a minimum of two weeks:
 Depressed mood (feeling blue, down-in-the-dumps, hopeless)
 A significantly reduced level of interest or pleasure in most or all activities
 A considerable weight loss or gain (5 percent or more change of weight
in a month when not dieting) or change in appetite
 Frequent thoughts of death or suicide (with or without a specific plan),
or attempt of suicide
 Difficulty falling or staying asleep (insomnia), or sleeping more than
usual (hypersomnia)
149
Chapter 9: Getting Your Head around Problems with Thinking and Mood

 Behavior that’s agitated or slowed down, which is readily observable 
by others
 Feeling fatigued or very low in energy
 Having thoughts of worthlessness or extreme guilt
 A diminished ability to think, concentrate, or make decisions
A quick review of this symptom list tells you why depression can be tricky 
to diagnose in people with MS. Each of the last five items on the list can also
occur in MS, even in the absence of depression. So, a consultation with a
mental health specialist with experience and expertise in MS may be required
to make the diagnosis.
Unfortunately, physicians still don’t routinely ask about patients’ moods. If 
you notice any significant changes in your mood (or your family members or
friends do), it’s important to bring these changes to your physician’s attention.
You have no need to feel embarrassed or awkward — mood changes are as
much attributable to your MS as any other symptom, and are among the most
treatable.
Discovering the causes of depression in MS
Even though it seems clear that depression is as much a symptom of MS as a
reaction to it, the cause for the depression isn’t clear. Like mood swings and
IEED, depression seems to be caused, at least in part, by neurologic changes
in the mood control centers of the brain.
150
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 
The Goldman Consensus Statement on 
Depression in Multiple Sclerosis
Following review and approval by the National
Multiple Sclerosis Society’s Medical Advisory
Board, the “Goldman Consensus Statement on
Depression in MS” was published in 2005 in 
the journal Multiple Sclerosis (volume 11, pp.
328–337). This document grew out of a concern
among MS specialists about the lack of recog-
nition and inadequate treatment of this serious
condition.
The Goldman Consensus Group, made up of
experts in the field of MS and psychiatry, has
provided recommendations for the recognition,
diagnosis, and management of depression. One
recommendation is that people with MS be rou-
tinely screened for depression during their visits
to the neurologist so that those who indicate
possible symptoms of depression can be
referred for a thorough evaluation. Because this
recommendation may never be implemented as
widely as it should be, we strongly urge you to
share the Goldman Statement with your physi-
cian and discuss any changes in your mood.
Your doctor or the National MS Society (800-
FIGHT-MS or 800-344-4867) can refer you to
mental health specialists with expertise in MS.

It’s also important to mention here that some of the medications currently
used to treat MS may increase the risk of depression, or worsen existing
depression, in some people. For example, the following medications have the
potential to affect mood:
 Corticosteroids: When taking high doses of these medications to treat
an MS relapse (see Chapter 6) some people feel energized — almost
giddy — but then find themselves going into a real funk as they come 
off of them. If you have a history of depression, make sure that your
physician is aware of this when corticosteroids are prescribed.
 Interferon medications: These medications, which are approved to
treat relapsing forms of MS, each carry warnings about depression
(check out Chapter 6 for a rundown of these medications). Even though
there was some initial concern from the clinical trial of Betaseron (that
the medication may increase a person’s risk of depression and suicide),
subsequent studies with the medication and the other interferons
haven’t borne this out. The individuals who experienced the depressive
episodes while on these medications usually had histories of depression
that preceded the trials.
The bottom line is that the labeling of each of these medications con-
tains a warning about depression, causing some patients and doctors 
to be reluctant to use them. The expert consensus seems to be that the
medications are safe, but if you’re taking an interferon medication and
experience a significant change in your mood — with or without a his-
tory of depression — you should talk about it with your doctor.
Neither Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) nor Tysabri (natalizumab), two other
approved disease-modifying therapies in MS, has been associated with any
mood problems.
Treating your depression
Depression is a treatable condition, but there are challenges. The biggest 
challenges to treatment are the reluctance of people to seek help for it and the
failure of clinicians to diagnose it accurately and manage it aggressively. Just
as people don’t like the idea that MS can mess with their thinking as well as
their bodies, they don’t like the idea that it can wreak havoc on their emotions
either. This dislike is certainly understandable, but it isn’t a good reason to
deprive yourself of the means to feel better and get on with your life.
Seeking help for depression doesn’t mean that you’re giving in to it. Instead,
it means you’re strong enough to take charge of your well-being. Because the
research shows that depression doesn’t just clear up by itself, the sooner you
begin to take care of it, the sooner you’re going to feel better.
151
Chapter 9: Getting Your Head around Problems with Thinking and Mood

The consensus among mental health specialists is that the best treatment 
for severe depression is a combination of antidepressant medication and 
psychotherapy. Even though each has been shown to provide some benefit,
the combination is thought to be the most beneficial.
Here are a few key things to remember about antidepressant medication:
 Antidepressant medication can take up to four to six weeks to have a
noticeable effect.
 If you stop taking your medication as soon as you feel better, the depres-
sion is likely to return. It’s important, then, to stay on your medication
until your doctor recommends otherwise.
 The antidepressant medications currently on the market (and there are
about a zillion) have different modes of action and different side effects.
So, be patient — it may take some time to find the medication and
dosage that work best for you.
 Even though neurologists, internists, family practice doctors, and some
nurses can prescribe antidepressant medications, they usually aren’t
specially trained in this area. Psychiatrists are familiar with all the 
available antidepressants and have the expertise to identify the best
medication or combination of medications to meet your needs. They’ll
monitor your depression on an ongoing basis to ensure that it’s treated
adequately. It’s not enough to feel better; the goal is to feel good.
 Psychiatrists who are familiar with MS are ideal if you need a prescrip-
tion for an antidepressant. Second best is the psychiatrist who’s willing
to learn about your MS and talk to your neurologist. It doesn’t help
much to get good treatment for your depression if the side effects of the
medication make your MS symptoms worse (for example, some medica-
tions may increase your fatigue).
 Because you may be taking several other medications for your MS, it’s
critically important that the person treating your depression is aware of
these medications and their potential interactions.
 Virtually all of the available antidepressant medications have sexual side
effects, with Wellbutrin (bupropion) being the least problematic in this
regard. If you’re severely depressed, you may not care much about sex
right now. Or, if your MS is interfering with your sexual function (see
Chapter 7), you may figure that one more hit in that area doesn’t really
matter. But, if sexual activity is important in your life, be sure to discuss
this with the person who’s prescribing antidepressant medication for you.
After your mood is stabilized, the doctor can recommend strategies —
such as changing the timing of your medication or skipping a dose every
now and then — to minimize the impact on your sexual activities.

Considering Complementary 
and Alternative Medicine
In This Chapter
 Recognizing CAM and its allure
 Separating fiction from fact
 Understanding the potentially useful therapies
 Being an educated consumer
T
hese days, people are looking for ways to take charge of their own health
and wellness. In the United States, a huge industry has developed around
this need to go beyond what traditional medicine can offer. The appeal of
nontraditional therapies and treatments seems to be particularly strong for
anyone who has a chronic illness that mainstream science hasn’t been able
to cure. So, it isn’t surprising that the use of nontraditional interventions is
high among people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In fact, most people with MS
have used some form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) at
one time or another.
To help you be a knowledgeable CAM consumer, in this chapter, we define
CAM and explain how it differs from mainstream medicine. We also empha-
size the importance of placebo-controlled clinical trials to evaluate the safety
and effectiveness of any treatment, and we let you know which types of CAM
have been shown to benefit people with MS. We stress the importance of talk-
ing with your doctor about all aspects of your treatment plan and of finding
safe and effective ways to combine CAM strategies with your standard MS
care. And, most importantly, we give you strategies for evaluating the various
types of substances and practices that are touted as “cures” for MS. Our goal
is for you to be an educated consumer.

Defining CAM
CAM, short for complementary and alternative medicine, includes those sub-
stances or therapies that a person chooses to use along with the treatments
prescribed by his or her physician (complementary), as well as those that a
person uses instead of prescribed treatments (alternative). We’re happy to
report that most people with MS are choosing to use the nontraditional ther-
apies as a complement to their regular MS treatment.
Over the years, CAM has been defined in several different ways, with the
defining characteristic being that the practices fell outside of traditional 
medicine. Today, more and more researchers are trying to evaluate these
interventions with the same rigorous studies that have traditionally been
used to evaluate standard treatments. As any CAM therapy or substance
demonstrates its safety and effectiveness in clinical trials, it makes its way
into mainstream medicine. Exercise, for example, is now recognized as an
important component of regular healthcare.
The National Institutes of Health divides CAM into the following categories:
 Biologically based therapies: This category includes special diets,
herbal medicine, vitamin and mineral supplements, and pharmacologic,
biological, and instrumental therapies (for example, bee venom therapy,
candida treatment, chelation therapy, cooling therapy, removal of dental
amalgams, enzyme therapy, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy).
 Alternative medical systems: These systems include acupuncture and
traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, and homeopathy.
 Lifestyle and disease prevention: In this category, the main approach
considered is exercise.
 Mind-body medicine: This group includes treatments such as biofeed-
back, hypnosis and guided imagery, meditation, music therapy, pets,
prayer and spirituality, T’ai Chi, and yoga.
 Manipulative and body-based systems: Massage body work (for exam-
ple, chiropractic, Feldenkrais, Pilates, reflexology, and Tragerwork) and
unconventional physical therapies (colon therapy and hippotherapy)
make up the treatments in this category.
 Biofield medicine: Therapeutic touch is in this category.
 Bioelectromagnetics: This category includes magnets and 
electromagnetic therapy.
154
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

Understanding the Allure
CAM is a huge industry in the United States, encompassing a wide variety 
of practitioners and products. The first step to becoming an educated 
consumer of CAM products and services is to understand their allure. For
example, consider the following reasons why people are attracted to CAM:
 People like the idea of taking control of their bodies, their lives, 
and their health. Products that claim to offer that kind of control 
have wide appeal.
 Safe, healthy, and natural are all buzzwords these days. They’re used
to promote a lot of products, including some that are safe and healthy,
and some that aren’t. Because of the way they’re advertised, many con-
sumers believe that the products they can buy without a prescription —
in a grocery store, pharmacy, or health food store — are somehow safer
and healthier than the ones their doctors prescribe. The simple fact is
that we know less about many of them than we know about prescription
medications that have been evaluated by medical experts.
 People living with MS and other chronic diseases are understandably
frustrated by the long wait for a cure. The available MS medications
(check out Chapter 6 for a description of the approved disease-modifying
therapies) are only partially effective, and folks are impatient for some-
thing better. To these people, anything that promises to “cure MS” or
“strengthen the immune system” sounds like the silver bullet.
Putting CAM to the Test
CAM is a mixed bag of goodies: Some treatments are beneficial, some won’t
hurt you but won’t do much good either, and some are out-and-out dangerous.
In the face of all the ads and testimonials (for example, “I threw away my
cane!” and “I was totally cured!”), here are some key points to keep in mind:
 If a cure for MS had already been found, the National MS Society and
other MS organizations would have broadcast it far and wide.
 Because not all products and services are equally regulated in this 
country, you need to know how to evaluate what’s out there.
 What you see (on a package, in an ad, and on the Internet) isn’t 
necessarily what you get.
155
Chapter 10: Considering Complementary and Alternative Medicine

In the following sections we explain why you can’t believe everything you
hear about a CAM treatment, and we give you some tips on how to sort
through the CAM bag of goodies to find what’s right for you.
Your MS doctor and your pharmacist are your best sources of information
about which CAM strategies may be helpful for you without interfering with
your prescription medications.
Understanding the role of the FDA
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for ensuring the
safety and effectiveness of a whole host of things, including prescription
drugs, medical devices, such as pacemakers or MRI machines, the nation’s
food supply, and cosmetics. Even though that may sound like a lot, just
remember that the list doesn’t include any of the supplements sold in stores
or the treatment strategies prescribed by nonmedical practitioners.
Because CAM interventions aren’t regulated, manufacturers and practitioners
are free to say whatever they want about them. Unlike the pharmaceutical
companies, for example, who can’t print or say anything about their products
that the FDA hasn’t approved, the manufacturers of supplements are free to
do as they please. When you pick up a supplement such as echinacea or St.
John’s Wort at the store, you can’t even be sure that the labeling on the box
matches the contents of the bottle, let alone that the claims made about the
products are true. The situation is the same with bee venom therapy, magnet
therapy, or any other nontraditional therapy. So you, as the consumer, need a
way to sort out the claims (check out the section “Becoming a Cautious CAM
Consumer” later in the chapter for details).
Sorting out the wheat from the chaff
We bet it’s music to your ears when you hear someone say “You’ve got to try
this! My MS got so much better. It was like a miracle!” Who doesn’t want to
feel better? Just remember that one person’s experience with a therapy or
supplement can be very different from someone else’s. So, one guy’s blog
may be filled with reports of success while your buddy from the support
group didn’t feel any better and had some really unpleasant side effects.
Given the natural ups and downs in the disease course and the fact that MS
symptoms tend to come and go unpredictably, it’s impossible to tell if a 
treatment works without testing it on a whole lot of people.
156
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

Appreciating the power of the placebo response
Physicians and researchers have repeatedly found that people with a variety
of diseases will improve any time they’re given a new treatment — even if the
treatment used is a placebo (a fake pill, injection, or other substance that
looks and feels just like a the real thing). And the evidence suggests that it’s
not all in their heads. Even though the response may be partially psychologi-
cal (“I really, really want this to work.”), some studies have shown that cer-
tain chemical changes in the body also contribute to the effect. Unlike the
benefits provided by a true treatment, however, the placebo benefits don’t
last long.
Understanding the role of the double-blind, 
placebo-controlled clinical trial
Given the powerful nature of the placebo response, it isn’t all that surprising
that many people feel better — at least temporarily — any time they try
something new. So, the only way to sort out the placebo response from a true
treatment response is to test the treatment in a double-blind placebo-con-
trolled clinical trial, which sounds a lot more complicated than it is.
Researchers rely on clinical trials to evaluate a potential treatment. Placebo-
controlled trials are designed to demonstrate a potential treatment’s superior-
ity to placebo. These trials typically involve two matched groups — one that
receives the study drug and one that receives a placebo. All of the study 
participants — patients, doctors, and research staff — are blinded, meaning
that they’re kept from knowing who’s getting the real drug and who’s getting
a placebo. The placebo effect is so strong that a hefty percentage of the
placebo group will show some improvement in their condition — sometimes
as high as 70 percent. In order for the study drug to “prove” itself the better
candidate, the treatment group needs to show greater benefit than the
placebo group over the full length of the study. And it needs to provide 
this benefit without significant side effects.
The disease-modifying therapies that have been approved for use in MS
(check out Chapter 6) have all been tested successfully using large, blinded,
placebo-controlled trials. Because most CAM interventions have never been
put through this kind of rigorous evaluation, there’s no way to know how safe
and effective they really are.
The placebo-effect isn’t a bad thing — feeling better is always a reasonable
goal. For instance, even though physicians rely on controlled trials to tell
them which treatments offer more than a placebo response, many CAM 
practitioners try to harness the power of the placebo response to give their
patients relief. The goal of treatment in MS, however, is to control the disease
and its symptoms safely over the long haul.
157
Chapter 10: Considering Complementary and Alternative Medicine

Identifying CAM Interventions That May
Be Useful in Managing MS Symptoms
Although few CAM treatments have been studied in large controlled trials,
enough small studies have been done with some of the treatments to indicate
which may prove useful and which may not. In the following sections we fill
you in on what’s been found so far.
If after reading this book you want to do some more reading on CAM 
interventions used by people with MS, take a look at the book, Alternative
Medicine and Multiple Sclerosis, 2nd edition, by Allen Bowling, MD, PhD
(Demos Medical Publishing, 2006).
Herbs, vitamins, and other CAM 
options that go into the body
CAM treatments come in many varieties, including those that are swallowed,
injected, infused, or inhaled. For example, take a look at the following:
 Bee venom therapy: Bee venom contains proteins that affect the
immune system. However, the exact mechanism isn’t known. This ther-
apy can produce rare, but potentially serious adverse effects, including
severe allergic reactions and death. A recent clinical trial demonstrated
that bee venom is no better than a placebo for treating MS.
 Diets and fatty acid supplements: Although many types of diets have
been proposed to treat MS over the years, study results regarding diets
and fatty acid supplements aren’t conclusive at this time.
Most MS specialist neurologists recommend a balanced diet that’s low 
in saturated fats and high in fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Some
evidence suggests that supplements of omega-6, omega-3, and vitamin E
may also be beneficial.
 Herbs: Herbs should be used with caution by people with MS because
there are some that may actually worsen MS or interact with MS medica-
tions. The message concerning herbs and MS is similar to that for uncon-
ventional medicine and MS as a whole: Some of them may be beneficial,
some may be harmful, and nearly all have yet to be fully understood.
Having said that, consider the following:
158
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

• Herbs that may be of benefit for certain MS-specific symptoms
include kava kava for anxiety, valerian for insomnia, cranberry for
preventing urinary tract infections, and psyllium for constipation.
• Herbs to avoid because they stimulate the immune system (which
is already overactive in MS) include alfalfa, arnica, astragalus,
boneset, calendula, cat’s claw, celandine, drosera, echinacea,
garlic, Asian and Siberian ginseng, licorice, mistletoe, reishi 
mushroom, saw palmetto, shiitake mushroom, and stinging nettle.
 Homeopathy: Homeopathy, a system of medicine that was developed 
in the 1800s, is a low-risk, low-to-moderate-cost therapy with unproven
effectiveness in MS. It shouldn’t be used in place of conventional med-
ications for controlling disease activity.
 Hyperbaric oxygen: This form of oxygen therapy increases the oxygen
content of the blood and tissues of the body. Studies have repeatedly
demonstrated that hyperbaric oxygen isn’t an effective treatment for MS.
 Low-dose naltrexone (LDN): Naltrexone is approved in the United 
States for the treatment of alcohol and opioid addictions. At much lower
doses it’s being prescribed by some doctors for the treatment of several
diseases, including MS and other autoimmune conditions. A very small
uncontrolled trial was recently completed in Crohn’s disease, but LDN
hasn’t yet been studied in MS.
 Marijuana: The use of marijuana, in addition to being illegal in the
United States, is associated with significant side effects. And, the 
possible interactions of marijuana with prescription medications 
aren’t well-understood. Research is underway on marijuana-related
chemicals to see if they can safely reduce pain, spasticity, and bladder
symptoms in MS.
 Prokarin (formerly called Procarin): Limited information is available
about the safety and effectiveness of this expensive skin patch treatment
that contains histamines, caffeine, and other undisclosed ingredients.
Although a clinical trial indicated that it may be useful for the treatment
of MS-related fatigue, the opinion of the National MS Society’s Medical
Advisory Board is that its limited benefits don’t justify its costs.
 Vitamins and other supplements: People with MS should be cautious
with vitamin supplements because they, like other forms of CAM, are a
mixed bag of goodies. For example, consider the following findings:
• Antioxidant vitamins (A, C, and E) offer possible benefits (by
decreasing the harmful effects of free radicals that are involved 
in the damage to your myelin and axons) and pose possible risks
(by stimulating the already overactive immune system).
159
Chapter 10: Considering Complementary and Alternative Medicine

• Vitamin C doesn’t appear to be effective for the prevention or
treatment of urinary tract infections.
• Vitamin B6 is tricky; too little B6 can interfere with normal nervous
system functioning whereas too much B6 harms the nervous
system and can actually cause MS-like symptoms.
• A small subgroup of people with MS may have a vitamin B12 
deficiency and should be treated with vitamin B12 supplements.
• People who take higher amounts of vitamin D may have a reduced
risk of developing MS. However, vitamin D doesn’t alter the disease
course in people who already have the disease. Taking too much
vitamin D can damage your liver.
• Vitamin D helps to maintain healthy bones by increasing the
body’s absorption of calcium. Sufficient quantities of vitamin D 
and calcium are essential for preventing osteoporosis (bone loss).
(Check out Chapter 11 for information about the risk of osteoporo-
sis in MS and recommendations for keeping your bones healthy.)
• Calcium EAP (calcium-2-aminoethylphosphate — also known as
calcium orotate) is a compound developed by Dr. Hans Nieper in
the 1960s. It’s very expensive and its safety and efficacy in MS have
never been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial.
• Selenium, zinc, DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone), and melatonin
may all activate the immune system and should therefore be used
in low doses or not at all.
Exercise, prayer, and other CAM options
done independently or in a class
Some forms of CAM involve activities that you can do on you own or in
groups. For example, consider these activities:
 Aromatherapy: Aromatherapy, in which the essential oils from certain
kinds of plants are inhaled or applied by massage, has a low risk and a
reasonable cost. Several small clinical studies suggest it’s beneficial for
anxiety and depression, but further research is needed.
 Cooling: Reducing a person’s body temperature slightly (with a cooling
vest or other cooling strategy) may help speed nerve conduction in
people with MS. Limited research studies have found that cooling pro-
duces improvement in many MS-associated symptoms, including weak-
ness, fatigue, spasticity, walking difficulties, urinary difficulties, speech
160
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

disorders, visual difficulties, sexual problems, incoordination, and 
cognitive difficulties. Cooling therapy may soon make the transition 
to standard medical practice in MS.
 Exercise: Exercise that’s geared to a person’s abilities and limitations
not only promotes general health but may also have beneficial effects 
on MS symptoms, including weakness, walking difficulties, muscle stiff-
ness, osteoporosis, low back pain, bladder difficulties, bowel problems,
fatigue, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and anger. People with MS who
are heat-sensitive should avoid becoming overheated (check out
Chapter 11 for tips on how to exercise comfortably).
 Prayer and spirituality: These are being evaluated to determine
whether they can improve overall health or improve the course of a 
disease. Research is underway to evaluate their effectiveness in MS.
 T’ai Chi: This low-risk therapy is a component of traditional Chinese
medicine that combines the physical benefits of exercise with the 
relaxing effects of meditation. T’ai Chi may improve walking ability 
and decrease stiffness in people with MS.
 Yoga: Yoga is relatively inexpensive and safe. Even though it hasn’t been
rigorously investigated, it may relieve anxiety, pain, and spasticity. Many
chapters of the National MS Society offer yoga programs (call 800-FIGHT-
MS or 800-344-4867).
Acupuncture, massage, and other CAM
options performed by a practitioner
The following CAM interventions are provided by a clinician or practitioner
with specialized training or expertise:
 Acupuncture: Acupuncture, a component of traditional Chinese medi-
cine, involves inserting thin needles into specified acupuncture points
on the body to alter the body’s energy flow. In small and preliminary
studies in MS, acupuncture has provided some relief of anxiety, 
depression, dizziness, pain, bladder difficulties, and weakness.
 Biofeedback: Biofeedback uses monitoring equipment to make a
person’s bodily functions (for example, heart rate) visible so that the
person can learn to modify or control the function. It may be beneficial
for some MS-associated conditions, including anxiety, insomnia, pain,
bladder and bowel incontinence, and muscle stiffness.
161
Chapter 10: Considering Complementary and Alternative Medicine

 Chelation therapy: This type of therapy involves intravenous infusions
of chemicals that bind to chelates (harmful metals) in blood. Although
it’s effective for treating cases of heavy-metal toxicity such as lead poi-
soning, there’s no scientific evidence that chelation therapy is effective
in MS. It’s very expensive, and serious side effects (including kidney
injury, bone marrow damage, and even death) may result.
 Chiropractic: This therapy involves manipulations of the spine to 
correct mild bone abnormalities that are thought to exert pressure 
on the nerves. There’s no strong published evidence that chiropractic
therapy is beneficial for MS attacks or for altering the course of the 
disease. Users of chiropractic should be aware of the rare side effects,
including stroke.
 Dental amalgam removal: The removal of dental amalgams (the 
silver-colored fillings dentists use to repair cavities) is based on the 
idea that the mercury contained in them is toxic to the body’s nervous
and immune systems. In spite of the hype this treatment has received
over the years, there’s no evidence that removing dental amalgams 
and replacing them with other materials has a beneficial effect on MS.
 Hippotherapy: Therapeutic horseback riding offers possible benefits for
walking difficulties, spasticity, weakness, bladder and bowel problems,
and depression.
 Hypnosis and guided imagery: Neither hypnosis nor guided imagery
has been fully investigated. Both are well-tolerated, low-to-moderate-
cost therapies that may relieve anxiety and pain in people with MS.
 Magnets and electromagnetic therapy: Low-intensity magnets and puls-
ing electromagnetic fields have been used in medicine for hundreds of
years in an effort to correct what are thought to be electrical imbalances
in the body. A few small studies have suggested that pulsing electromag-
netic fields may improve spasticity and bladder problems in MS, but fur-
ther studies are needed to evaluate their efficacy and safety.
 Massage: Massage, which involves many different techniques, helps to
relax muscles and relieve stress. Even though it hasn’t been extensively
studied in MS, limited studies in other conditions suggest that it may
improve mood and reduce spasticity and certain types of pain.
Becoming a Cautious CAM Consumer
You and your family members are likely to be bombarded with sound-bites
and advertising regarding various types of CAM. In your eagerness to get a
grip on your MS and feel better, you may be persuaded to try a little bit of
162
Part II: Taking Charge of Your MS 

this and a little bit of that, without carefully considering the pros and cons.
Here are some suggestions to help you become a savvier consumer:
 Be cautiously skeptical: Take every claim with a grain of salt until you
see solid evidence from a controlled clinical trial.
 Always ask the following questions, and don’t give up until you 
have the answers: What does the treatment involve? How and why is 
it supposed to work? How effective is it? What are the risks? How much
does it cost?
 Talk with your doctor and pharmacist about any CAM intervention
that you’re considering: These professionals are your best sources of
information about possible risks and interactions with your prescribed
medications. When you don’t mention the CAM you’re using, it’s like
asking your doctor to treat your MS with a blindfold on.
 Watch out for the following red flags:
• Advertisements that rely heavily on testimonials or anecdotal 
evidence rather than objective data on efficacy, safety, and cost
• Marketing hype that makes exaggerated claims of “miraculous”
results for a variety of different diseases
• Promises of relief from lots of different symptoms (products that
claim to fix everything probably don’t fix much of anything)
• Claims to strengthen your immune system (The MS immune
system is already overactive, so additional boosts may be 
harmful.)
• Products with secret ingredients
• An antimedical emphasis that berates conventional medicine
• Expensive, highly invasive treatments with no supporting data 
or scientific rationale
 Don’t trip over the following misconceptions:
• “Natural” doesn’t necessarily mean “safe.” Even though some 
natural compounds are safe and beneficial, others can be toxic.
• Even supplements that are beneficial can contain chemicals that
are potentially harmful.
• More isn’t necessarily better. As with prescription medications,
higher supplement doses aren’t necessarily more effective than
lower doses, and the additive effects of multiple supplements 
may actually be harmful.

Staying Healthy
and Feeling Well

In this part . . .
A
n important strategy for living comfortably with 
multiple sclerosis (MS) is knowing how to take care
of the whole you — so that you’re primed to meet what-
ever challenges MS brings your way. To help you take the
best possible care of yourself, we provide info on preven-
tive healthcare, and we show you how to handle your
stress. This part also gives the lowdown on how you and
your care partner can maintain your health and quality of
life if and when the disease progresses in spite of every-
one’s best efforts.

Paying Attention to Your Health —
It’s Not All about MS
In This Chapter
 Making wellness a comprehensive plan
 Protecting your health with routine checkups
 Eating the right stuff
 Understanding the importance of exercise
 Setting yourself up for success
M
ultiple sclerosis (MS) can really grab your attention. Matter of fact, 
it may take so much of your time and energy that you don’t have any
left to think about other important health issues (for example, dental care
and routine physical checkups). And if you and your doctor are focusing
exclusively on your MS care, neither of you may take the time to think about
preventive healthcare strategies or wellness. Besides, no one who’s been
“blessed” with MS should have to worry about anything else, right?
Unfortunately, the fact is, the healthier you are, the more comfortable you’ll
be and the better able to deal with whatever challenges MS brings your way.
So, in this chapter, we talk about important strategies for feeling and func-
tioning at your best, including timely checkups, routine screenings for other
health problems, healthy eating, a regular exercise regimen, good dental care,
and adequate rest.
Enhancing Your Wellness by Paying
Attention to the Whole You
Wellness is all about feeling the best you possibly can. And remember that
you can most definitely be well even though you have MS. You can achieve
wellness by paying attention to the whole you and by making sure that you
have the following:

 Adequate rest (Check out Chapter 7 for tips on how to deal with MS
fatigue and maximize your energy.)
 Good stress management strategies (Chapter 12 is all about managing
the stresses of everyday life.)
 Whatever form of spiritual sustenance you want and need
 A healthy diet
 The right kind of exercise program
A feeling of balance (and we don’t mean the walking-on-a-tightrope kind) is also
important. For instance, a healthy life includes time for work and recreation,
togetherness and solitude, and busy times and vegging out. Balance also
comes from making sure that MS doesn’t steal the show. The goal is for MS to
take up no more of you and your family’s time, energy, and resources than it
actually requires (flip to Chapter 15 for more on these family matters).
For a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to wellness, take a look at these
resources:

Have a Chronic Illness, by David Spero (Hunter House, 2002)
 Multiple Sclerosis: A Self-Care Guide to Wellness, 2nd edition, edited by
Nancy Holland and June Halper (Demos Medical Publishing, 2005).
Scheduling Routine Checkups 
to Protect Your Health
Even though MS is definitely enough for any one person to have to handle, it
doesn’t protect you from other health problems. Although some people with
MS report that they get fewer colds than they used to (maybe that overactive
immune system is good for something after all!), you can expect to deal with
all the usual things — colds, flu, and stomach bugs — along the way. And
most people with MS die from all the same stuff as everyone else — cancer,
heart disease, and stroke. So, remember, you’re not off the hook when it
comes to taking care of your health.
In addition to whatever care you’re getting for your MS, it’s important that you
have a primary care physician or nurse on your team who can give you a gen-
eral tuneup on a periodic basis and refer you for the health screens that are
recommended for your age group. Few neurologists provide this kind of care
on a routine basis because they’re focusing their attention on your MS needs.
168
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

For ideas about what type of preventive care you personally need, check 
out the National MS Society’s brochures, Preventive Care Recommendations
for Adults with MS: The Basic Facts (www.nationalmssociety.org/
preventive) and Dental Health: The Basic Facts (www.nationalmssociety.
org/dental). You can also request these brochures by calling (800) FIGHT-
MS (800-344-4867). If you want friendly e-mail reminders about your health
screening tests, check out www.myhealthtestreminder.com. (For more
information about the safety of various types of vaccinations for people with
MS, take a look at Chapter 23.)
Gynecological exams, mammograms, chest X-rays, colonoscopies, routine
dental care, and other procedures may pose an accessibility challenge if you
have mobility issues or use a mobility aid, such as a motorized scooter or
wheelchair. So, when you make your appointment, check to make sure that
the facility and testing equipment are fully accessible and that someone will
be available to provide assistance if you need it. Nothing is more frustrating
than arriving for a scheduled appointment only to discover that you can’t get
through a doorway, onto an examining table, or close to an X-ray machine. If
you have trouble locating accessible facilities, call the National MS Society at
(800) FIGHT-MS for recommendations in your area.
Making Healthy Eating a Priority
Unfortunately, you can’t eat your way around MS. Even though a variety of
special diets have been promoted as MS cures, none have been shown in 
controlled trials to alter the course or severity of MS (check out Chapter 10
for more information on the role of clinical trials in evaluating alternative 
and complementary therapies). Like everyone else, you’ll benefit most from a
healthy diet that provides the recommended nutrients for a person your age
and that promotes good cardiovascular health.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has recently created a new, more
personalized version of the familiar Food Pyramid (mypyramid.gov). When
you type in information about your age, sex, and activity level, it tells you how
much of each food group you need to eat on a daily basis, as well as tips on
what foods offer the best bang for your buck. The bottom line, no matter what
your individual needs are, is that you get the most benefit from a diet that
 Contains a balance of grains, fruits, vegetables, lean meats (or meat 
substitutes), and low-fat dairy products
 Provides you with only as many calories as you need
169
Chapter 11: Paying Attention to Your Health — It’s Not All about MS

Taking MS into account when 
planning your menu
In addition to a balanced, low-fat, high-fiber diet (and a daily multivitamin),
MS specialist neurologists and nutritionists recommend that you keep the 
following important points in mind:
 Calories count. If you eat more calories than you burn, your weight will
go up — it’s as simple as that. Along with its other benefits, exercise
burns calories. So, if you’re less mobile or active than you used to be
because of your MS, to maintain the same weight, you need to reduce
the number of calories you’re taking in.
And, in order to make all your calories count, the best strategy is to get
them from nutritious foods rather than from those yummy but not-so-
nutritious desserts and junk foods that do nothing for your waistline or
your well-being.
 Calcium protects your bones. Everyone needs hefty amounts of calcium
for strong bones and teeth. However, a person with MS — particularly
women at or near menopause — may be at increased risk for osteoporo-
sis (bone loss) for a couple of reasons:
• Mobility problems, fatigue, weakness, and spasticity (stiffness) can
all contribute to a reduction in physical activity, including weight-
bearing exercise, which, in turn, can lead to bone loss.
• The corticosteroids that are used to treat MS relapses (exacerba-
tions) can increase the risk of bone loss.
• Heat sensitivity, fatigue, and reduced mobility may decrease the
amount of time spent in the sun, which affects your exposure to
vitamin D (which is necessary for calcium absorption).
We recommend 1,000 mg per day of calcium for women and men
between the ages of 25 and 65, and 1,500 mg per day for postmenopausal
women. Because vitamin D promotes the absorption of calcium, for best
results, you should try to obtain 400 international units (IU) of vitamin D
from the foods you eat or from a dietary supplement.
 Fluids help fight urinary tract infections. People who are experiencing
bladder problems tend to cut back on liquids in order to avoid having to
pee all the time. However, reduced fluid intake can worsen fatigue and
constipation, and can increase the risk of urinary tract infections. So, 
do your best to drink eight glasses of liquid per day (and take a look at
Chapter 8 for additional bladder management strategies).
Water is hands-down the best, but low-calorie sodas (without aspartame
if you have an ornery bladder), skim milk, seltzer, and plain tea or coffee
(decaffeinated for that same ornery bladder) come in second. And finally,
high-calorie sodas and fruit juices take a definite third. Ice cream, yogurt,
sorbet, gelatin-based desserts, and soups are also good sources of fluid.
170
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

 With enough fiber, all systems are a go. Constipation is a common
problem in MS (flip to Chapter 8 for some good management strategies).
So, if you’re less physically active and don’t drink enough fluids, the
problem is likely to be even worse. And some of the medications used to
treat common MS symptoms — such as amantadine for fatigue, baclofen
for spasticity, and the medications for overactive bladder — may also
contribute to the problem. But, adequate fiber intake can help a lot. You
should aim for about 25-30 grams a day, from foods such as whole grain
breads and cereals, brown rice and whole wheat pasta, dried beans,
lentils, and peas, and vegetables, fruits, and nuts.
Battling the barriers to healthy eating
Even with the best of intentions, maintaining good eating habits can be diffi-
cult. But, being alert to some of the ways that MS symptoms can interfere
with healthy eating can help you stay on track. For example, consider these
troublesome symptoms:
 Fatigue: If just getting through the day takes all your energy, putting 
time and effort into healthy meals can seem overwhelming (take a look
at Chapter 7 for suggestions on how to manage MS fatigue). So, rather
than eating balanced meals, you may find yourself grabbing the nearest
(unhealthy) snacks. Or you may reach for the quick fix — a blast of
something sugary that gives you a momentary boost but then leaves 
you feeling tired and hungry — rather than protein, which reduces
fatigue and helps you maintain a more consistent blood sugar level.
Pretty soon you have a vicious cycle going, with fatigue contributing 
to poor nutrition and poor nutrition fueling your fatigue.
A nutritionist can recommend healthy dishes that are easy to prepare.
An occupational therapist (OT) can give you lots of energy-saving tips,
including recommendations for helpful cooking gadgets and tools, ideas
on how to arrange your cooking space, and strategies for simplifying
your shopping trips. Check out Chapter 5 for more information about
these members of your rehab team, and call the National MS Society 
for referrals to specialists who are experienced in MS (800-FIGHT-MS).
 Depression: Like fatigue, depression is common in MS. And, unfortu-
nately, people who are depressed may experience significant changes in
their appetites — either eating a lot less or a lot more than they used to.
Neither extreme is particularly healthy.
If you’ve lost interest in food or don’t seem to enjoy eating the way you
used to, or if you find yourself eating a lot of not-so-healthy comfort food
to boost your spirits, be sure to let your doctor know. Other things, like
fatigue and certain medications, can cause appetite changes, but it’s still
important to find out if depression is the culprit. (Flip to Chapter 9 for
more on mood changes and MS.)
171
Chapter 11: Paying Attention to Your Health — It’s Not All about MS

 Accessibility or mobility issues: Sometimes people have difficulty
putting together healthy meals because they can’t navigate the stores 
or their kitchens the way they used to. For example, foods may be on
inaccessible shelves, pots and pans may be stuck in out-of-the-way
places, the kitchen may be too small to accommodate a scooter, and 
the counters may be too high. So, when things get more challenging, 
you may find yourself skipping meals or relying more heavily on pre-
pared foods or take-out. We’re not big fans of either of these strategies. 
If you find yourself eating more prepared foods, be sure to check out the
ingredients because many frozen foods are high in sodium or fat, which
can raise blood pressure and cause you to put on the pounds.
A nutritionist can point you in the direction of some healthier products
and can also suggest some simple menus that you can fix in a jiffy. 
Also, an OT can help you figure out how to make your cooking space
more organized and accessible so that the items you need are within
your reach.

food selection and preparation, check out the National MS Society’s booklet,

Improving Your MS and Overall 
Wellness with Exercise
Here’s the basic message: Exercise is good for you. Even though it wasn’t all
that long ago that people with MS were told not to exercise, we now know
that physical activity geared to your abilities and limitations provides many
benefits, including
 Reducing your fatigue (difficult to believe but absolutely true)
 Maintaining and increasing your endurance and the flexibility of your
joints and muscles
 Improving your cardiovascular health
 Improving bowel and bladder functions
 Strengthening your bones
 Improving your mood
172
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

Overcoming the hurdles
In spite of all the good reasons to get out there and move around, people with
MS often find it challenging. Here are the most common hurdles and some
strategies for getting over them:
 “I’m too tired to even think about exercise.” Exercising to increase
your energy level doesn’t sound logical, but it works because it
improves cardiovascular function and tones your muscles. The trick 
is to start small and build up gradually. Pick a time of day when your
energy is pretty good and do something physical, even if it’s only a 
little — swim a half a lap, walk to the next driveway and back, spend 
one minute on the treadmill, or make one trip up the stairs.
Set your goals within reach so that every step is a victory, and don’t
raise the bar until you’re comfortable. If it takes a few days or a week to
go to the next level, so be it. Allowing yourself to do things differently —
or at a different pace — than you used to, is your key to success (see
Chapter 3 for details). Your physician or physical therapist (PT) can
help you design an exercise regimen that’s just right for you.
 “I hated exercising before I had MS and I don’t like it any better now.”
Okay, so you don’t enjoy jogging, swimming, aerobics, or anything else
that makes you think of sweat. But keep in mind that physical activity
doesn’t have to be competitive and you don’t have to go to the gym.
Instead, you can work in your garden, walk in the mall, join a yoga class,
or take a walk with your best friend. If you love to watch movies, set up
a TV in front of your treadmill or recumbent bicycle, and exercise with
your favorite stars — you can see them but they can’t see you, so it all
works out. Chances are that you’ll add a few more minutes to your rou-
tine just to see what happens in the next scene.
 “The competition was what I loved, and if I can’t do it competitively, I
don’t want to do it at all.” All you competitive folks out there probably
have the toughest challenge of all. When being the best or the fastest or
the toughest isn’t possible, you need to redefine your goals. Perhaps you
can level the playing field a bit by getting into adaptive sports of some
kind — adaptive skiing, wheelchair basketball, or disability-friendly
ropes courses (the National MS Society can fill you in on opportunities
in your area). Or, maybe you can decide to compete with yourself rather
than with others — by challenging yourself to swim one more lap or
speed up your walk around the block.
You may need to experiment with a few different activities to find some-
thing that satisfies your competitive urges. And believe it or not, you
may even find yourself enjoying non-competitive activities that you
never took the time to try before.
173
Chapter 11: Paying Attention to Your Health — It’s Not All about MS

 “If I can’t do it as well as I did before, I’m not interested.” In Chapter 3,
we talk about how important it is to grieve over the old stuff so you can
get on with the new — and this is a case in point. If you pride yourself on
your fabulous tennis serve or glorious golf swing, and MS suddenly gets
in the way, you’re going to have to grieve over that loss before you can
start thinking about what’s next. After you get your head around the idea
of doing your sport differently or less gracefully, you may find that there’s
still a lot to enjoy about it — the essence of the game, the companion-
ship, or the time spent out-of-doors.
If you become unable to pursue the sport at all, it will take you a while 
to find satisfying substitutes. You’ll probably have to try a few different
things before you find something you like, but the chances are great that
you’ll find something to enjoy.
 “It takes me so much longer to do stuff that I never have time to exer-
cise any more.” Time is one of your most valuable resources, especially
when you have MS. So, the more demands you have on your time and
the longer it takes you to do the things that are important to you, the
more important it is to think through your priorities. If physical activity
improves your mood and helps you feel more mobile and energetic, you
may want to put it pretty high on your priority list. You don’t need to
carve out a lot of time either — just 15 to 20 minutes a day will do the
trick (and you don’t even have to do it all at once!). Choose an activity
that’s close by and convenient so you don’t have to spend a lot of extra
time getting there and back.
Exercising your options
You don’t have to be a great athlete to get physical. People with MS can 
enjoy a wide variety of activities. Here are some that you may want to try:
 Water activities in a cool pool: These are ideal if your MS is heat-
sensitive. Most people do well in water that’s no warmer than 80 to 
84 degrees. The buoyancy of the water makes swimming and water 
aerobics safe and comfortable even if you have weakness or balance
problems. The National MS Society can give you information about MS
aquatics programs in your area.
 Aerobic exercise: Aerobic exercise is any activity that raises your 
pulse and respiration rates. Running or walking outside or on a tread-
mill, cycling outside or on a stationary bike, and rowing are the activities
that people generally think of as aerobic exercise. But, you can actually
raise your heart rate by simply sitting in a chair and doing windmills
174
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

with your arms. You only need to do 15 minutes a day to get the aerobic
benefits, and research has shown that you can get the same benefits
even if you divide the time into three five-minute periods over the
course of the day.
 Yoga: This is an excellent, noncompetitive form of exercise that 
combines healthy breathing techniques with movements that improve
flexibility and balance. Yoga is also a wonderful stress-reliever. Many
chapters of the National MS Society offer yoga programs that are geared
toward your abilities and limitations, so call (800) FIGHT-MS to find out
about programs in your area.
 T’ai Chi: This gentle martial art that’s made up of slow-motion move-
ments can maintain or improve balance, flexibility, and strength. Like
yoga, T’ai Chi is an excellent activity for reducing feelings of stress.
 Stretching exercises: These types of exercises are important for main-
taining comfort and flexibility, particularly if you’re experiencing spastic-
ity. Stretching helps you loosen up tight muscles and maintain full range
of motion in your joints.
Take a look at Stretching for People with MS (www.nationalmssociety.
org/stretching) and Stretching with a Helper for People with MS
(www.nationalmssociety.org/stretchinghelp). You can also
request hard copies of these brochures by calling (800) FIGHT-MS.
 Weight training with free weights or exercise machines: This can help
you tone your muscles and increase your flexibility and endurance.
Remember, however, that lifting weights can’t strengthen muscles that
have been weakened by poor nerve conduction. After the nerves that
stimulate the muscles have been damaged by MS, those muscles aren’t
likely to become stronger with exercise. Weight-training will, however,
help to strengthen the surrounding muscles that you use to compensate
for those that are no longer working up to snuff.
 Therapeutic horseback riding: This activity promotes balance and
strength (just think of all the effort it takes to keep yourself upright on
the back of a moving horse!), and it’s great for stretching out leg muscles
tightened by spasticity.
Clearly you have a lot of options. But be sure to talk to your doctor or physi-
cal therapist before starting any new exercise program, just to make sure that
you’re opting for an activity that’s appropriate and safe given whatever your
current symptoms are. Experiment with various activities until you find one
that’s right for you. Remember that the best exercise program is one that you
enjoy enough to do on a regular basis.
175
Chapter 11: Paying Attention to Your Health — It’s Not All about MS

Maximizing your comfort 
and safety during exercise
The goal of exercise is to feel and function better. But, the old “no pain, no
gain” philosophy doesn’t apply here — there’s no need to push yourself to
the limit. Here are some tips to help you be comfortable and safe while 
getting the greatest possible benefit out of your physical activities:
 Try to plan your exercise during peak energy times. There’s no point
in starting when you’re already exhausted. If you begin to exercise and
quickly get very tired, take a short break. Sometimes it only takes a few
minutes to feel ready to go again.
 Take a few minutes to warm up before (and cool down after) any 
vigorous activity. For instance, it’s a good idea to drink a glass of cold
water or juice before you start to help keep your body temperature
down. And loosen up your joints with gentle stretches or rotations to
avoid strain. After you finish exercising, gently stretch out the muscles
you’ve been using to avoid cramping and stiffness, and take another
drink to cool yourself off.
 Don’t push yourself beyond your limits. It’s much healthier and more
effective to get moderate exercise on a regular basis than to push your-
self to exhaustion once and then be too worn out to do anything for the
rest of the week.
 Exercise in a cool environment. Even a slight elevation in your core
body temperature — as little as half a degree — can cause your symp-
toms to act up. These little flare-ups, which are called pseudoexacerba-
tions, are nothing to worry about; they’ll disappear after your body has
cooled down again (see Chapter 6 for more details). If your MS is partic-
ularly sensitive to the heat, you can protect yourself by sipping cold
water during your workout, wearing a commercially-available cooling
garment, such as a vest, bandanna, or headband, and staying close to a
fan or air conditioner.
 If you’re balance-challenged, be sure to stand near a wall or chair
when you exercise, or ask someone to spot you. If you don’t feel 
sure-footed enough to balance standing up, your physical therapist 
can recommend exercises for you to do while seated on a chair or mat.
 Watch out for slippery floors in exercise facilities and around pools.
So that you don’t slip and fall, it’s a good idea to wear non-skid shoes
any time you’re going to be maneuvering on a wet floor.
176
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

 Before engaging the services of a personal trainer, make sure that he
or she has some experience with people with MS. Trainers who are
unfamiliar with MS generally don’t understand the limitations imposed
by MS fatigue or by muscles that have been weakened by lack of nerve
conduction. Your physician or physical therapist can recommend an
exercise regimen for you to do with your trainer. Be sure you work with
your trainer to set realistic goals given your level of ability.
For more information about exercise and MS, check out the National 
MS Society’s booklet, Exercise as Part of Everyday Life, at www.
nationalmssociety.org/exercise or by calling (800) FIGHT-MS.
Increasing Your Chances of Success
Turning over a new leaf is never easy. Anyone who has made a New Year’s
resolution knows how challenging it can be to change behavior — and this
whole chapter is about changing your behavior in ways that will enhance
your health and wellness. So, whether you’re trying to be more vigilant about
your medical or dental checkups, improve your diet, or increase your level of
physical activity, the best strategy is to come up with a plan that you can live
with. Follow these guidelines to set yourself up for success:
 Set reasonable goals. Unreasonable expectations only set you up 
for failure.
 Focus on the things you can change rather than on those you can’t.
Even though MS is here to stay — at least for the time being — you can
do a lot to take care of yourself and feel well.
 Don’t get caught up in your “failures.” If you have a momentary lapse
from your new diet or exercise regimen, don’t beat yourself up about it.
Instead, try to put that energy into getting back on track tomorrow. An
occasional day off is good for the soul.
 Work with a buddy to make things easier and more pleasant. Partners,
neighbors from down the street, or friends from your support group are
all good candidates for an exercise partner. And chowing down with a
diet buddy can make those low-cal meals taste better too.
 Every time you do something good for yourself — whether it’s eating
something healthy, getting some good exercise, or getting a mammo-
gram or chest X-ray — pat yourself on the back. Recognizing the things
you do to take care of yourself is an important step toward feeling more
in control of your body and your health in spite of MS.

Handling Stress without

In This Chapter
 Seeing how MS relates to stress
 Knowing when you’re stressed
 Determining what stresses you out most
 Using the stress management strategies that work for you
I
magine this all-too-familiar scene: A young woman goes to her neurologist in
a tizzy. She has two young kids and has recently gone back to work because
her husband is worried about getting laid off. The babysitter is moving away,
the basement flooded during the last storm, and her parents need help moving
into their new retirement home. Not to mention that she was recently diagnosed
with multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic illness that seems to do whatever it
wants to do whenever it wants to do it. People are telling her that stress isn’t
good for her MS and she’s panicked that she’s going to get worse. She’s trying
to rid her life of stress, but somehow it’s not working.
Chances are that your life feels just as stressful at times because, well, life is
like that. So, if you have stress in your life (we assume that’s all of you), and
you have MS — or care about someone who does — this chapter is for you. We
talk about the relationship between stress and MS — what is known and 
what isn’t — and we suggest strategies for living more comfortably with
whatever stresses come your way.
Understanding the Relationship
between Stress and MS
Not all stresses are alike. Even though people use the term stress a lot — “I’m so
stressed.” or “The stress is really getting to me.” — they’re actually referring to
many different kinds of experiences. These experiences run the gamut from the

hassles of daily life, such as traffic jams, bickering children, and misplaced keys,
to sudden crises, such as the death of a loved one or the loss of one’s home, to
ongoing stresses like financial worries or marital problems. And research sug-
gests that the various types of stress may interact with MS in different and
sometimes contradictory ways. For example, consider the following facts:
 Sudden acute stresses, such as car accidents or missile attacks (yes,
that’s actually been studied!), seem to have no impact on either the
onset or progression of MS. In fact, some evidence suggests that brief
traumatic stresses may even reduce a person’s risk of MS relapses.
 A large study found that the death of a person’s child significantly
increased his or her risk of developing MS.
 Ongoing, chronic trauma or stress seems to increase the risk of 
MS relapses.
In other words, the relationship between stress and MS isn’t at all clear. 
To make it even more complicated, the research in this area also suggests
that the impact of a person’s life stresses depends in large part on his or her
coping and problem-solving skills and support system. Because MS varies so
much from one person to another, and no two people have the same coping
mechanisms or resources, no one can really predict how life’s stresses are
going to affect you or anyone else. So, rather than worrying about how the
unavoidable stresses of daily life are going to affect your MS, your best bet 
is to figure out how to manage those stresses more comfortably.
Recognizing Your Own Signs of Stress
Because everyone’s situations and coping skills are different, you can safely
assume that no one’s stresses are exactly like anyone else’s — and neither
are their strategies for dealing with those stresses. So, your best bet is to
identify the things in your life that stress you out. Then you can figure out the
strategies that are most helpful to you in dealing with them. A good place to
start is by learning to recognize how you feel when you’re stressed. Sounds
easy, right? Not so fast! Because everyone reacts differently to different stres-
sors, it’s impossible to create a master list. But, in this section, we go over
the most common physical and emotional responses.
From sweaty palms to pounding hearts:
Knowing your physical signs of stress
The human body is programmed to respond to life-threatening events. 
You may remember the old fight-or-flight response you learned about in 
high school biology. This response, which is leftover from the days when 
180
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

the earliest humans had to scramble for survival, is built into everyone’s 
physiological makeup. When confronted with a threat, your body, including
the immune system, goes into high gear in preparation to protect itself.
Fortunately, modern life doesn’t generally involve imminent physical danger,
but the physiological processes are still active in everyone. So, because of
these processes that affect your body, some of the most obvious responses
to stress are physical ones. For example, you may
 Develop a rapid heart beat
 Have sweaty palms
 Get knots in your stomach
 Find your mouth going dry
 Feel worn out
 Develop a pounding headache
Some of the physical responses to stress may be difficult to distinguish 
from your MS — such as feeling worn out or getting a dry mouth (which is a
common side effect of the medications used to treat bladder problems). With
all this stress-related physiological activity going on, it’s not all that surpris-
ing that MS symptoms may kick in a bit more as well. You may experience
blurry vision or you may feel more tingly, for example. These changes are
generally short-lived and calm down when you do.
Anxiety and irritability: Knowing 
your emotional signs of stress
Not only does the body react to stress, but the mind does too. Some common
emotional reactions to stress include feeling
 Anxious or worried about a lot of things
 Irritable or grumpy much of the time
 Down in the dumps
 Overwhelmed and overcommitted
 Pessimistic and gloomy
You may also find yourself anticipating the worst all the time, or you may be
having a lot of nightmares. All of these thoughts and experiences may make 
it difficult for you to get a good night’s sleep, concentrate, make decisions, or
enjoy what you’re doing. (Because problems with concentration and decision
making can also be symptoms of MS, be sure to check out Chapter 9 for more
information about cognition.)
181
Chapter 12: Handling Stress without Giving Up Your Life

Many of these feelings and experiences can also occur with depression. If
“you find yourself feeling down pretty consistently for more than a couple of
weeks, be sure to consult your physician. Depression is common in MS and
deserves to be treated promptly. (Flip to Chapter 9 for more information
about how to recognize and treat depression.)
Identifying the Major Stresses in Your Life
When you’re feeling stressed out and overwhelmed, it’s important that you
try to sort out the good, the bad, and the ugly. By that we mean figuring out
what the sources of your stress may be, deciding whether they give you more
pleasure than pain, and differentiating between those you can do something
about and those you can’t.
To help you get the sorting process started, you may want to keep a stress diary
for a couple of weeks to see what your stresses are all about. This diary doesn’t
need to be anything elaborate, just some brief notes about what’s going on
when you notice yourself feeling stressed. A small pad or pocket calendar works
well because you can keep it handy for those stressful moments on the go.
The following sections show you some real-life examples of how to sort out
various stressful situations. Even though these examples may not be specific
to you, you can still use our advice to handle your specific situation.
Dealing with the devil: Job stress 101
Whether anyone likes it or not, stress is an inevitable product of having a job.
Unfortunately, though, MS can cause you to have even more stress than the
average worker. Just remember that even if your job is incredibly stressful, 
it still provides you with income, interesting challenges, enjoyable relation-
ships with co-workers, and health insurance. Not a bad trade-off.
So, if you decide that keeping your job is a good thing, you have to identify
the particular things about your job that cause you stress (and then deter-
mine whether you can actually control the stress and how). Perhaps your
boss is a pain, the nine-to-five schedule is grueling given your fatigue level,
and your office is about a zillion miles from the nearest bathroom.
Chances are you can’t do a whole lot about your boss, so it’s not worth spend-
ing a lot of time and energy thinking about him or her. On the other hand, you
know that some people in the office are taking advantage of flextime and even
working from home some days. And you think that one of the offices closer 
to the bathroom may be opening up soon. So, you could talk to your boss
(charmingly, of course) about accommodations that may make your work life
a little less stressful (check out Chapter 18 for more information about on-the-
182
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

job accommodations). In other words, the goal is to zero in on the things that
you may actually be able to change instead of wasting energy on those that
you can’t.
Handling family stress with 
grace and composure
As with job stress, it’s important that you deal with your family stress by
determining the stressors and deciding whether they’re controllable or not
(is your Aunt Frieda really controllable?). So, suppose that your family comes
to your house for the holidays every year. This is a tradition that you and the
family really enjoy. You love decorating the house, feeding everyone a deli-
cious meal, and having lots of presents for everyone to open. For you, family
time is what the holidays are all about. But this year, you’re exhausted and
your symptoms are acting up, the kids have been a real pain lately, and your
husband is so busy at work that he’s virtually no help at all.
Even though asking your sister-in-law to host the family this year is definitely
an option, it’s important to think about what you’d gain and what you’d lose
by turning the event over to her. In other words, don’t throw the baby out
with the bath water. If having the family at your house gives you pleasure,
figure out how to do it with less stress. You can, for example, do the following:
 Order presents online instead of going to the mall.
 Order food from a restaurant instead of cooking (or start cooking now and
put stuff in the freezer so you don’t have to do all of it at the last minute).
 Hire someone to clean the house, or have a family powwow to talk about
how to divvy up the chores.
 Let your husband know that the decorating job is his — even if he has to
do it at 3 a.m.
As we talk about in Chapter 3, one of the most important strategies for
coping with MS (and reducing your stress) is getting comfortable with the
idea that it’s okay to do things differently.
Controlling the uncontrollable: 
Managing your MS stress
So, you say you’re incredibly stressed out about your MS. You worry all the time
about getting worse, losing your job, and ending up in a wheelchair. Clearly,
your first choice for getting rid of this stress in your life would be to dump the
disease — but that’s not exactly possible. The next best choice is to focus on
the things you can do something about rather than the things you can’t.
183
Chapter 12: Handling Stress without Giving Up Your Life

For example, you can talk with your doctor to make sure you’re doing all 
the right things to slow the progression of your MS. You can also make an
appointment with a vocational rehabilitation counselor to talk about your job
situation and career options in case you become unable to do your current
job (Chapter 18 covers all of your employment woes). The next step is trying
to figure out what frightens you most about a wheelchair. Even though most
people never need one, it doesn’t hurt — and it generally helps — to visualize
how you would manage at home, at work, and in the world if you were using a
scooter or chair. You may even want to talk with some people with MS who
use mobility aids to see how they’ve managed with them. The National MS
Society can put you in touch with folks who’d be happy to talk with you. You
can contact the Society by calling (800) FIGHT-MS (800-344-4867).
You can deal with the stress of MS by taking on the individual fears and 
challenges one by one. You’ll be surprised how much more confident and
prepared you’ll feel after you go head-to-head with each boogeyman.
Developing Your Stress Management Plan
Given all the hoopla about stress, you’re probably wondering how to get a
handle on the stresses in your own life (see the “Recognizing Your Own Signs
of Stress” section to figure out how to identify your stressful triggers). The
first step in your stress management plan is to remind yourself (repeatedly, if
necessary) that stressing yourself out about stress is pointless. Here’s why:
 Trying to eliminate stress is impossible. It simply can’t be done
because stress is inherent in everyday living. When people try to get 
rid of stress in their lives, they end up feeling anxious and inadequate
when it doesn’t work. And even if they partially succeed, they’re often
dissatisfied with the results.
 Giving up activities that are important to you — like your job —
because they’re stressful is a lose-lose strategy. You may lose some 
of the stress in your life, but you also lose income and a major source 
of satisfaction and self-esteem. And, it turns out that unemployment is
pretty stressful, too.
 Happy events are also stressful — and you certainly don’t want to 
rid your life of those. Marriage, a new baby, the holidays, buying a new
house, and planning a vacation are all examples of events that cause
stress even though they’re pleasurable and exciting. If all of these
stresses were eliminated, life would be pretty bland.
When people try to control their MS by ridding their lives of stress, they may
feel guilty when their symptoms act up or the disease progresses anyway. In
other words, they blame themselves when their MS misbehaves. Just remem-
ber that it’s difficult enough to deal with a chronic, unpredictable disease
184
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

without also taking blame for it. It makes a lot more sense to follow your neu-
rologist’s recommendations for managing your MS (check out Part II for lots
of information about managing MS and its symptoms) while also figuring out
how to manage the stresses of your everyday life. Together, these strategies
will help you feel and function at your best.
Like managing your MS, managing stress is an ongoing process — it isn’t
something you can do once and then forget about. In this section, we give
you some pointers for how to begin dealing with the MS-related stresses
you’re experiencing now and those that may crop up in the future. You can
also check out Stress Management For Dummies by Allen Elkin (Wiley, 1999)
for a much more detailed overview of general stress management strategies.
Figuring out your priorities
Part of adapting to life with MS is adapting to the unpredictability of your
symptoms and their potential impact on your everyday life. As you probably
know, MS symptoms can make it more difficult for you to do all the things
your want to do. So, if you’re feeling stressed out about keeping up with stuff,
and you’re worried about how to meet everyone else’s needs and expecta-
tions, it’s time to set some priorities for yourself.
Keeping in mind that you can’t be much good to anyone else if you aren’t
taking adequate care of your own needs, you need to make sure that you’re
making time for yourself and setting clear limits with others about what you
can and can’t do for them. Identifying your personal priorities can help you
figure out how to put your time and energy to the best possible use (take a
look at Chapter 7 for other ideas on managing your energy supply).
To start sorting out where your priorities lie, take a look at your work and
personal calendars for the last month. Put a smiley face next to each activity
that was meaningful, enjoyable, or productive, and a frowning face next to
each activity that was unnecessary, a waste of time, or unproductive. It’s
amazing how much time people spend doing things that are actually unim-
portant to them.
Setting realistic goals
If you overcommit, overplan, and overpromise, you’re setting yourself up for
stress. On the flip side, if you set realistic goals you’re setting yourself up for
success. So, if you find that it’s taking you longer to do things, take your produc-
tivity into account when you plan your day. For example, if your fatigue is over-
whelming later in the day, plan the big stuff for the mornings. You’ll feel a lot
less stressed if you can look back at the end of a day and feel good about what
you’ve accomplished. In the end, you have to pick and choose the things that
are most important to you and give yourself enough time to succeed at them.
185
Chapter 12: Handling Stress without Giving Up Your Life

Here’s something to try: For the next week, write out your planned schedule
for each day, guesstimating how long each activity is going to take. Then,
after you’re finished with that particular activity, make a note of how long
each one actually takes. This kind of information can help you plan a lot 
more realistically in the future.
Cutting yourself some slack
Sometimes people are their own worst enemies and they beat up on them-
selves for not doing things well enough or fast enough. For example, are you
harder on yourself than you are on everyone else? Do you beat yourself up
when you don’t do everything just right? Are you always doing the “should-a,
would-a, could-a” thing? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you
have to remember this: Chances are high that you’re going to have days
when you just can’t do everything on your list, or that you won’t be able to
do things exactly the way you want to. Instead, it’s important to be proud of
what you can do and forgiving of what you can’t.
If you’re experiencing a lot of pressure from the people around you, they need
to cut you some slack as well. So talk to them about what’s going on with you.
(Chapter 14 is all about how to talk about your MS with other people.)
Taking some practical steps
Daily life is filled with small stresses that can quickly add up to be bigger
ones. In other words, it isn’t any one thing — such as struggling with the but-
tons on your blouse, getting stuck in traffic, or misplacing the folder that you
need for your first meeting — that wears you down. Instead, it’s the fact that
they all happened before your first cup of coffee and you’re behind schedule
before the day has even started. So that you don’t get bogged down by the
small stuff, here are a few suggestions for eliminating some of those pesky
problems:
 Give yourself extra time to get where you need to go. Feeling rushed
all the time is uncomfortable for everyone, but it’s even worse when
you’re dealing with a bunch of MS symptoms that slow you down.
 Organize your living and work spaces so that everyday items have a
regular home. Nothing is more stressful than spending half your time
looking for the stuff you need (and the other half trying to maneuver
around the many piles littering the floors).
 Do things the easy way rather than the hard way. Take shortcuts
“whenever you can, use the best tools that assistive technology (AT)
“has to offer, and call in the troops when you need help (Chapter 7 has
more information on AT).
186
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

 Build rest times into your day. Once you’re exhausted, everything feels
more stressful. Taking the time to refresh your body and your mind will
help keep stress at bay.
 Every day, think of one thing you want to do just for yourself, and then
make sure you do it. It’s easy to spend all your time doing things for
other people — your partner, kids, boss, and colleagues are all lined up
with demands on your time and energy. Taking the time to do something
for yourself isn’t selfish — it’s essential to your health and well-being.
 Plan ahead. Feeling more prepared for various tasks always makes you
feel less stressed. Here are some tips to help you plan:
• Organize your tasks (household chores, errands, work activities)
in chunks that make sense. Rather than running all over the place
helter-skelter, figure out all the activities that need to be done in a
certain part of town, in the basement, or on the floor where your
boss’s office is, and then do those things all at the same time.
Doing things systematically is a lot less stressful than running
yourself ragged by going back and forth.
• If going to the supermarket freaks you out or wears you out, plan
your trip ahead of time. Use a standardized grocery list that’s orga-
nized according to the aisles in the store (your store may actually
have one of these). Check off the items you need that week and go
only to the aisles where they are. Besides taking less energy, this
strategy cuts way down on impulse buying, which can save you
money!
• If you’re traveling, do an accessibility check well ahead of time. Be
specific about what your needs are so that you get the appropriate
accommodations when you arrive. (Take a look at Chapter 23 for
ten tips for traveling with MS.)
• If you’re getting lost more while driving, plan your route ahead 
of time and carry a set of directions in your car. If you do this for
every trip, you’ll have a handy file of directions in your glove com-
partment. Just be sure to write or type them in large size print so
you can see them easily while you’re driving. (Check out Chapter 9
for more information on cognitive symptoms.)
• If you have bladder issues, don’t wait until you have to pee to
figure out where the nearest bathroom is. Scope out the bathrooms
as soon as you arrive at a new place so you won’t have to stress
about getting there on time.
• If you’re stressed out about an upcoming event, take time to plan 
it out in your head (or write it down if that makes you feel better).
Try to sort out what you’re worried about and rehearse your strat-
egy for dealing with it. Mastering something successfully in your
head is the first step to mastering it in real time.
187
Chapter 12: Handling Stress without Giving Up Your Life

• Keep a firm hold on your sense of humor. Your humor can get you
through a lot of tough times and can help you defuse stress along
the way.
The examples are endless. What they all have in common is the fact that
they give you a greater feeling of control, which means you feel less
stressed.
For many more ideas, take a look at the book, 300 Tips for Making Life with
Multiple Sclerosis Easier, 2nd edition, by Shelley Peterman Schwarz (Demos
Medical Publishing, 2006).
Tapping available resources
Another good way to relieve some of the pressure on yourself is to make the
best possible use of your available resources. No matter what problem you’re
trying to solve, you can bet that someone or something out there can help. It
may be a person with the expertise that you don’t have, a tool or mobility aid
that you’ve never considered before, or just a ready source of good information.
Any time you’re feeling as though everything is sitting smack on your shoulders,
let your fingers do the walking — in the phone book and on the Internet — to
see what’s out there for you. Call the National MS Society (800-FIGHT-MS) for
help in locating national and local resources. And visit your local bookstore
because you’re likely to find a For Dummies book on just the right topic.
Zoning in on your “MS-free zone”
When you find that keeping up with your old pace becomes difficult, it’s easy
to begin feeling as though MS is taking over your life and is hogging the whole
show. The bigger the MS looms, the more stressed and out of control you
feel. This overwhelming feeling tends to happen with advanced disease, but 
it can be just as valid an issue for people with a recent diagnosis.
One good way to confront these feelings and lessen your stress is to spend
some time in your MS-free zone (MSFZ). While the MSFZ isn’t a magical king-
dom, it’s almost as good. Your MSFZ is the place where your MS can’t reach
you. Whether it’s reading a good book, listening to music, praying, giggling
with a friend over lunch, working with clay, or whatever, it’s your place to
take a timeout and regroup. Your MSFZ is by invitation-only, and your MS 
isn’t invited. Time in your MSFZ can feel as restful as a nap, as refreshing 
as a minivacation, and as satisfying and relaxing as a warm cuddle.

Practicing stress management techniques
Because stress management isn’t a one-size-fits-all proposition, the menu of
techniques is extensive. We outline some of the basic types here, but you can
check out Stress Management For Dummies for all the details on how to apply
these strategies and others to the wide variety of stresses (MS-related and
not) in your life. The key is figuring out what works best for you and sticking
with it. But, be ready to tweak the technique if your needs change. Here are
the basics:
 Exercise is a known stress reliever, and believe it or not, with all the 
different kinds of exercise out there you’re sure to find something you
enjoy — team sports, aerobics, weight machines, Tai Chi, yoga, swim-
ming, cycling, and the list goes on and on.
The National MS Society can refer you to Society-sponsored exercise
programs in your area (800-FIGHT-MS), or to a physical therapist who
can design an exercise regimen that meets your specific needs and limi-
tations. (Take a look at Chapter 11 for more information about exercise
and MS.)
 Relaxation strategies don’t burn up a lot of calories, but they’re great for
relieving stress. You may need to try a few before you find the one that
works best for you. Keep in mind that learning to relax takes practice, so
it generally takes a month or so to really get the benefits. Here are some
strategies you can try:
• Deep breathing exercises: The great thing about deep breathing 
is that it can be done anywhere, any time. We recommend that 
you start and end your day with some relaxed, comfortable deep
breathing. Also, spend a few extra minutes breathing deeply any
time you’re feeling particularly stressed out.
• Visualization: This exercise involves clearing your mind of every-
thing except for the one scene you want to focus on. Pick a scene
that’s filled with pleasurable stimuli — your favorite beach, a 
beautiful park, mountains covered with snow — and enjoy your
“visit.” You need to be able carve out several minutes in a quiet
place for this relaxation exercise to work properly.
When practicing visualization, we suggest starting with a few
cycles of deep breathing. Then spend five to ten minutes experi-
encing as many details of your scene as you possibly can — the
sights, sounds, smells, and anything else that your imagination 
can conjure up.
189
Chapter 12: Handling Stress without Giving Up Your Life

• Meditation: For those of you who find visualization to be a piece 
of cake, meditation is the next step. The goal of meditation is to
concentrate on a particular word, phrase, or sound (called a
mantra), which you repeat silently or aloud over and over again. 
To meditate properly, you need a good 15 to 20 minutes a couple 
of times a day (preferably on a consistent schedule).
With practice, you can use the focused repetition of meditation to
block out other thoughts, sights, and sounds. The word or sound
you choose to repeat doesn’t matter as long as it’s something
soothing and comforting. Being able to remain focused for more
than a couple of minutes takes quite a bit of practice, but the
payoff is a real sense of calm.
• Progressive muscle relaxation: Relaxing each of your 17 muscle
groups in sequence is a great way to get your whole body into a
comfortable and relaxed state. You can do this exercise sitting in a
chair or lying on your bed. Either way, the process involves tensing
and relaxing individual parts of your body and taking the time to
notice how the changes feel. You can start from the top and work
your way down or you can start from your fingers and toes and
move inward toward the center of your body. Whatever you do,
don’t forget the small parts, such as your eyes, tongue, and jaw.
Progressive relaxation makes for a relaxing start to the day and a
peaceful way to prepare your body for sleep.
If you have significant spasticity (stiffness) in certain muscles, 
tensing them may cause a spasm. Ask your neurologist or physical
therapist for recommendations on how to best exercise those
muscle groups. (Take a look at Chapter 7 for more information
about spasticity.)
Developing effective stress management techniques takes time, practice, 
and patience. If you find it difficult to get into any of the techniques, or if 
you continue to feel stressed out in spite of your best efforts, you may want
to consult an expert. The National MS Society (800-FIGHT-MS) can refer you
to a mental health professional (such as a psychologist, social worker, or
counselor) in your area who can help you find ways to manage your stresses
more comfortably. Also, check out the National MS Society booklet, Taming
Stress in MS for detailed instructions (www.nationalmssociety.org/
brochures-tamingstress1.asp).

Chapter 13
Coping with Advanced MS
In This Chapter
 Getting an overview of the treatment options
 Keeping a positive quality of life
 Knowing your possible long-term care options
 Keeping caregivers comfy
You may be wondering whether you should read this chapter. If that’s the
case for you, check out the following pointers: If your multiple sclerosis
(MS) is galloping along at a rapid clip and causing you a lot of problems, you
definitely want to spend some time on this chapter. If, however, you’re an MS
“beginner,” don’t feel like you have to read this chapter right now. In fact, you
may never need to read it. It’s simply here for those folks — and their family
members — who need and want to explore the grittier side of MS. When we say
gritty, we mean when the disease progresses in spite of everyone’s best efforts
and when symptoms are tougher to manage. Even though we’re happy to say
that the majority of people with MS don’t ever become severely disabled, we
also know very well that saying so is little comfort for those who do.
So, if your MS is feeling too hot to handle, this chapter is specifically for you.
We talk about the options you have in terms of treatment, and we provide
ideas for making your environment as MS-friendly as possible. We also give
you tips for avoiding uncomfortable and potentially dangerous complica-
tions. Finally, we spend some time talking about support and care options 
for those of you who are having difficulty managing things at home. In case
you’re a family member or friend who’s providing care for someone you 
love, we end this chapter with some important tips for you.
Scouting Out the Treatment Scene
Chances are high that the first question on your mind is about the treatment
options for your progressive MS. Before we get to your answer, though, we
want to remind you that four disease types or “courses” have been identified
in MS (you can read about them in Chapter 1). The vast majority of people

are initially diagnosed with a relapsing-remitting course that’s characterized
by periodic attacks (relapses) followed by periods of remission. Other people
experience a more steadily progressive course from the very beginning.
But, whether you were diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS that eventually
became more steadily progressive, or your MS has been progressive from the
outset, the treatment scene is nowhere near as crowded as we would like it to
be. We’re optimistic, however, that some of the drugs currently under study
will turn out to be safe and effective options.
Understanding your disease-
management options
Here’s the deal: All six disease-modifying medications that are approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat MS have been shown 
to be effective for people who experience relapses (flip to Chapter 6 for a
description of these medications). So, as long as you continue to have
relapses, you’re still a good candidate for most, if not all, of these medica-
tions. However, the evidence is pretty strong that these medications have
their greatest impact early in the disease, primarily by reducing the number
and severity of relapses. The following sections show you your options if you
aren’t a candidate for the disease-modifying medications.
Options for people who don’t have relapses
If you don’t have relapses — that is if you have primary-progressive MS
(and have never had relapses) or secondary-progressive MS (and used to 
have relapses but no longer do) — your options are much more limited.
Novantrone (mitoxantrone) is the only one of the six medications that has
been approved for people with secondary-progressive MS whether or not
they continue to have relapses. And to date, no medication has been found to
be effective for primary-progressive MS. That doesn’t mean that those of you
with progressive disease are out in the cold, however.
If your MS appears to be progressing significantly in spite of whatever 
treatments have already been tried, your neurologist may recommend a
chemotherapy drug, such as Imuran (azathioprine), Cytoxan (cyclophos-
phamide), or methotrexate. Even though none of these medications has 
been specifically approved for use in MS, doctors have found that they 
may help to slow the disease course for some people.
These medications — like Novantrone — are immunosuppressants that are
also used to treat various forms of cancer. Because these meds work by sup-
pressing the entire immune system (rather than selected parts of the immune
system as occurs with the five immunomodulating therapies), they all carry a
certain degree of risk. The risks include infection, impaired fertility, and
heightened risk of certain types of cancer.
192
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

Another strategy recommended by some MS neurologists is pulse steroid
treatment, which involves intravenous infusion of 1,000 mg of methylpred-
nisolone once a month for a period of 6 to 24 months.
Because the research evidence for the chemotherapy drugs and for pulse
steroids isn’t conclusive, and none have been specifically approved by the
FDA for use in MS, your insurance company may not be willing to cover them.
Experimental options for very active MS
You may also hear or read about a couple of experimental treatments that are
being used to control very active, progressive MS, so we want to give you a
heads-up about what they are. One option is bone marrow transplantation. This
is a procedure in which your immune cells — including those that are thought
to be causing damage in your central nervous system — are destroyed and then
replaced using immune stem cells from your bone marrow. Another option is a
process called plasmapheresis. In this procedure, the plasma in your blood,
which is thought to contain certain immune factors that are stimulating your
MS, is replaced with healthy plasma.
Each of these highly invasive treatments has been studied in small numbers
of people with mixed results. Because they both pose significant risks and 
are still considered experimental, they may not be reimbursable by most
insurance policies.
193
Chapter 13: Coping with Advanced MS
Other valuable resources for dealing 
with your progressive MS
Here are some books that can help you decide
how to best handle your progressive disease:

Multiple Sclerosis by Patricia K. Coyle and
June Halper (Demos Medical Publishing,
2001).
 Multiple Sclerosis: A Self-Care Guide to
Wellness, 2nd edition, edited by Nancy
Holland and June Halper (Demos Medical
Publishing, 2005).
 Multiple Sclerosis: The Questions You
Have; The Answers You Need, 3rd edition,
edited by Rosalind Kalb (Demos Medical
Publishing, 2004).
In addition, the National MS Society offers sev-
eral brochures that deal with progressive dis-
ease. You can download the publications from
www.nationalmssociety.org/major
changes or you can request them by calling
(800) FIGHT-MS (800-344-4867).

The fact that the available medications aren’t particularly helpful for progres-
sive MS doesn’t mean that you have no other options. On the contrary, this is
the time to call in the troops. A healthcare team — particularly one at an MS
care center that’s staffed by specialists — has a great deal to offer people like
you who have more advanced disease. In the following sections we give you
lots of tips for taking the best possible care of yourself.
Exploring ways to feel and 
function at your best
The goal of treating MS is to help you feel and function well. So, together, you
and your healthcare team can identify and implement strategies to manage
your symptoms and keep you active, comfortable, and safe.
Managing your symptoms
Comprehensive symptom management is essential to feeling and functioning
well. So, if your doctor says that nothing more can be done to control your
symptoms, find a different doctor — pronto. There are medications and 
management strategies to address virtually every symptom of MS (check 
out Chapters 7, 8, and 9 for full discussions of the symptoms and the ways to
manage them). Even though you can’t totally eliminate your symptoms, you
and your healthcare providers can work together to identify the strategy 
(or combination of strategies) that provides you with the greatest relief and
comfort. The right strategy (or combination of strategies) also helps to pre-
vent problems like infection, bone loss, and joint problems (see the section
“Taking steps to prevent unnecessary complications” a little later in the 
chapter for more).
Working with the rehabilitation specialists
Rehabilitation is particularly valuable if and when your disease starts to
progress significantly. Depending on the level of intervention you need, you
may receive rehabilitative services on an outpatient or inpatient basis. For
example, your neurologist may refer you to a physical therapist (PT) or an
occupational therapist (OT) for a certain number outpatient sessions, which
are followed up by a personalized program for you to implement at home. Or,
you may be referred for a 10- to 14-day inpatient stay at a rehabilitation facility.
At a rehab facility, you’ll receive a thorough assessment by each member of the
rehabilitation team, and then you’ll go through intensive therapy in each area.
The program is typically followed up with a personalized at-home regimen.
All of the members of the rehabilitation team are working together to help
you maintain the highest possible level of function and comfort, given what-
ever limitations you may have. (Flip to Chapter 4 for a complete look at the
members of the rehabilitation team.)
194
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

Staying healthy
When your MS starts taking a lot of your time, energy, and focus, you may
find that you have a tendency to neglect other aspects of your health. You
may find that because you see your MS doctor fairly frequently, you begin to
rely on the neurologist or nurse for your general healthcare as well. But, we
know from published research data that this strategy doesn’t work very well.
People who see MS specialist neurologists for all of their care have been
found to be in less good health than their peers who also see their internist
or family physician in addition to their MS docs.
So, remember that even though your neurologist will be paying close atten-
tion to your MS needs, he or she will probably not be checking your weight,
blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and other health parameters. Nor
will your neurologist be reminding you about the health screening measures
recommended for your age group (for example, chest x-rays, ECGs, mammo-
grams, prostate exams, and colonoscopies).
Having MS doesn’t protect you from developing other health problems. Like
the general population, most people with MS die of cancer, heart disease, and
stroke. Because of this similarity to the general population, you need to take
the same care of your health as anyone else (see Chapter 11 for more on
taking care of your general health).
Taking steps to prevent unnecessary 
complications
By now, one of your friends or family members has probably mentioned to
you that he or she knew someone who died of MS. Don’t let that scare you.
Even though in rare cases death can result from a virulent, rapidly progres-
sive form of MS or from severe complications in people with advanced MS,
most people who have the disease die from cancer, heart disease, and stroke
like everyone else.
The primary MS health risks are caused by preventable complications including
 Urinary tract infections: These types of infections are relatively
common in MS. The important message here is that untreated urinary
tract infections not only make other MS symptoms feel worse, but they
can also lead to serious kidney problems and urosepsis (which occurs
when bacteria in the bloodstream are resistant to treatment). For these
reasons, prompt diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections 
(by your neurologist, primary care physician, or urologist) is important.
(Refer to Chapter 8 for more about the management of common urinary
symptoms, strategies for reducing the risk of infections, and treatment
alternatives when infections occur.)
195
Chapter 13: Coping with Advanced MS

 Spasticity (stiffness): This symptom is a common one in MS (see Chapter
7). When left untreated, spasticity can lead to contracture, or “freezing” of
the joints, which is a painful and debilitating problem. The best way to
avoid contracture is to use a regimen of stretching (and medication, if
needed) to keep your joints flexible. Your neurologist and physical thera-
pist can recommend the appropriate treatment strategies for you.
 Dysphagia: Some people with MS develop dysphagia (problems with
swallowing). Coughing or choking while eating may be a sign that you’re
developing a swallowing problem. It’s important to report these kinds 
of changes to your physician promptly because when left untreated,
swallowing problems can lead to aspiration pneumonia, which is caused
when food particles travel into the lungs rather than through the esoph-
agus and into the stomach where they belong. This, like all types of
pneumonia, can be serious, debilitating, and potentially dangerous. 
A speech/language pathologist can assess the type and severity of the
problem you’re having, and he or she can recommend the appropriate
interventions.
Also important to remember is that people who have trouble swallowing
may not get adequate nutrition. In this case, a consultation with a nutri-
tionist may be recommended.
 Skin problems: If you spend extended periods of time in a scooter,
wheelchair, or bed, you need to take particularly good care of your skin
because you’re at risk for pressure sores (which are also known as bed
sores). These sores appear when various parts of your body are in con-
stant contact with your bed or chair. Over time, this pressure restricts
blood flow, resulting in damage to the skin in those areas. The buttocks
and heels are particularly vulnerable to pressure sores, as are any bony
areas, such as hips, elbows, and ankles.
So, if you’re experiencing significant mobility impairment, it’s important
to check your skin carefully every day for signs of redness or irritation.
Report any changes to your doctor immediately. The best way to deal
with pressure sores is to prevent them from happening in the first place
by making sure you lift your butt (or other part of your body) off the bed
or chair every hour or so. Keeping your skin dry, but moisturized can
also help. Just remember that after sores develop, they can be difficult
to heal and threatening to your health.
 Osteoporosis: The risk of osteoporosis (the thinning of your bones) is
increased for anyone with limited mobility who gets insufficient
amounts of weight-bearing exercise. Frequent use of corticosteroids is
also known to increase the risk of osteoporosis. So, if you spend signifi-
cant amounts of time in a wheelchair or scooter (or if you take corticos-
teroids often), it’s a good idea to get a baseline bone density evaluation,
which is generally done by a radiologist, and you should have periodic
screenings thereafter. Also make sure that you’re taking in the recom-
mended amount of calcium (Chapter 11 has the information you need
about calcium intake and dietary recommendations).
196
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

 Depression: Keep in mind that the primary cause of suicide in MS is
untreated or undertreated depression. So, given that depression is very
common in MS, and that the suicide rate in MS is significantly higher
than in the general population, it’s important for you to remember that
depression is one of the disease’s most treatable symptoms. Don’t hesi-
tate to get whatever help you need. (Take a look at Chapter 9 for a dis-
cussion of depression and mood swings.)
While the risk of these complications is real, the good news is that doctors
now have the know-how to prevent many unnecessary complications of MS.
And with the advent of antibiotics, the infections (for example, urinary tract
and kidney infections, as well as pneumonia) that once were fatal for many
people are now much more easily treated.
Maintaining Your Quality of Life
The phrase “quality of life” means different things to different people. For
example, what’s important in your life may differ from what’s important in
someone else’s life. The challenge, however, is the same for everyone who’s
dealing with the more advanced symptoms of MS: Find ways to keep life full,
active, and satisfying despite whatever symptoms you may have. So, in this
section, we offer some strategies for doing just that.
Holding on to what’s important to you
Unfortunately, some people have a tendency to give up activities when they
can no longer do them the way they used to. You may, for example, give up
skiing because your balance and energy aren’t what they used to be. Then,
you may find that long walks with your partner are a lot more difficult and
tiring than they used to be. And then you may decide that you can’t really
take your kids to the zoo anymore. Finally, one day, you realize you’ve given
up a whole lot of things that made your life fun, full, and interesting.
Even though you may think you have to give up all the good stuff, we propose
a different strategy: Figure out ways to do your favorite activities differently
by using assistive technology (AT), or try out some alternative activities that
may be just as satisfying. We know doing things differently is tough — so
that’s why we spend so much time talking about grieving in Chapter 3.
If you already have a “tool chest” of gadgets to help you do the things you
want to do — congratulations — just keep adding to it. But, if you don’t have
that tool chest yet, your rehab team can help you figure out exactly what
kinds of tools would work best for you (check out Chapter 7 for more on AT
and Chapter 4 for more on the rehab team). We knew a man who kept his
“tool chest” in the trunk of his car. Each day he’d think about the activities on
197
Chapter 13: Coping with Advanced MS

his schedule, and he’d use whichever tool — cane, crutches, walker — that
best fit the bill. In other words, he let the activities determine the tools
instead of trying to make any one tool meet all of his needs.
The fact is that people with MS do enjoy adaptive skiing and other modified
sports. Moms and dads can enjoy watching a soccer game or going to the zoo
in a motorized scooter. A cruise can be just as much fun as trekking in Tibet.
The key is recognizing that, even though the activities may be different or
you may have to do them differently, they can still be part of a full and
rewarding life.
Stay in touch: Preserving your 
connections with other people
Most social interactions are built around shared activities and interests. For
example, you may go out to dinner with certain friends and play golf or go on
trips with others. So, as you can imagine, when the activities are challenged,
the relationships with these people may be challenged as well. When you find
yourself in a situation like this, you may be worried about slowing everyone
else down, being a nuisance, or feeling uncomfortable (even though you
shouldn’t!). Your friends may also feel awkward, or they may even shy away
from you when the usual basis for the relationship is altered.
When your activity-level changes, you need to take the lead: Reach out to
your friends and suggest alternative plans. Most often, when you do this,
you’ll find that your friends care more about you than they do about the
activity, and they’re usually happy to do things differently or a bit more
slowly if they know it helps you. You may also find that they’re perfectly 
willing to participate in another activity altogether. In the case of those
people who care more about the activity than they do about you and your
well-being — well, they probably weren’t such good friends to begin with.
Establishing goals and enjoying the 
satisfaction of meeting them
Everyone needs to have goals. The satisfying process of setting achievable
goals and meeting them is what allows you to feel productive, useful, and 
successful. If your MS progresses, you may find that some of your original life
goals need to be tweaked or even changed entirely. You may, for example,
need to alter your career ambitions (perhaps by becoming a school adminis-
trator rather than a classroom teacher or a music teacher rather than a 
performer) or trade competitive team sports for individual sports. The first
step in making these kinds of transitions is healthy grieving. In other words,
before you can identify and work toward new goals, you need to allow yourself
198
Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

to feel sad about the old ones (see Chapter 3 for more details on grieving).
After you’ve dealt with your losses, you can begin to think about and experi-
ment with some new possibilities. The key is to always have something to
strive for — something that energizes you and taps your talents and creativity.
If you find yourself running out of ideas for goal-setting, think about speaking
with a mental health professional to help you get started.
Keeping your self-image well-polished
People with more advanced MS can sometimes lose sight of who they are
when the disease begins to affect them in so many different ways. They may
begin to question their value to themselves and others.
If you find yourself starting to have these kinds of thoughts, take a careful
look at that jigsaw puzzle picture of yourself that we talk about in Chapter 3.
You’re made up of many pieces — you have qualities, interests, abilities, and
quirks that you’ve acquired over a lifetime. Even though MS may have
affected many areas of your life, chances are high that those unique parts of
you are still there. Your challenge, then, lies in figuring out new ways to
engage those special parts of you.
If you’re having trouble getting started, have a heart-to-heart with a few of your
close family members, friends, and colleagues. They’ll be happy to remind you
what they love about you, what qualities and talents you share with them
every day, and how you can still provide them with help and support in their
daily lives. And if you need some suggestions about how to get these conversa-
tions started, consider doing a little prep work with a therapist or counselor
(check out Chapter 4 for more info on mental health professionals).
Finding your “MS-free zone”
If and when you start to feel as though MS is affecting every part of your life,
you need to go on a treasure hunt. The prize is your MS-free zone — that part
of you that MS just can’t touch. This part is different for every person: It may
be your love of music, sense of humor, spirituality, passion for soap operas,
or any one of the zillion other things that tend to make people happy. Your
MS-free zone is simply a refuge from the demands of MS — a place where 
you can go to regroup when life feels overwhelming. Your zone is a valuable
resource because it can give you the emotional energy you need to tackle 
the difficult stuff that goes along with the disease.
So, think about what moments in your day or week give you the greatest
sense of freedom and relief. You’ll know when you’ve found your MS-free zone
because you won’t be able to wait to go there periodically for a “breather,”
and you’ll feel energized by your time there.
199
Chapter 13: Coping with Advanced MS

If you’re having trouble getting in touch with your MS-free zone, your friends
and family may be able to help you figure out what it is. If they can’t, contact
a good mental health professional for assistance.
Helping yourself by helping someone else
Sometimes helping someone else is the best way to take your mind off of
what ails you. Many people with MS have told us how much better they feel
when they know they’re doing something that makes a difference to other
people, whether at home or at their jobs, in a support group of some kind, 
or doing volunteer work. Volunteer opportunities come in all shapes and
sizes. You can, among so many others, help out at your kid’s school, support
a political candidate, visit the elderly in nursing homes, provide rides for
someone who can no longer drive, read to someone with a visual impairment,
or serve meals in a homeless shelter.
If you’re interested in doing some kind of volunteer work but haven’t found
what you’re looking for, think about contacting VolunteerMatch (www.
volunteermatch.org), which is a national nonprofit organization that’s
dedicated to helping people find a great place to volunteer. VolunteerMatch
offers an online searchable database of volunteer opportunities to help you
find an organization to volunteer with. This site also provides other features
and services, such as personalized alert e-mails that list new opportunities in
your area.
You can also call the National MS Society at (800) FIGHT-MS (800-344-4867) to
find out what volunteer opportunities your National MS Society chapter may
offer. The Society is a volunteer-driven organization that thrives on the tal-
ents of people just like you.

How much of you is your MS?
If you want to know how much space MS takes
up in your life, here’s an exercise to try: Draw a
large circle that represents you and your life.
Now shade in the area of the circle that is your
MS. Is it just a tiny wedge of your pie or is it a
giant-sized portion? Is it a bigger part of you and
your life than you want it to be? Can you think of
any ways to turn it into a more manageable
piece? Do you think it’s the disease itself or your
feelings and attitudes about it that are taking up
so much space? If you’re having difficulty
answering these questions, you may want to
consider talking them over with family mem-
bers, other people with MS, or a mental health
counselor. These folks may be able to help you
get back in touch with those non-MS parts of
yourself.

Discovering Long-Term Care 
Services (Just In Case)
Like many people, you probably find the idea of long-term care to be really
scary. Over the years, many, many people with MS have asked each one of us,
“Am I going to end up in a nursing home?” The short answer is that the vast
majority of people don’t. However, a person with MS may need assistance —
sometimes more than their family members can handle alone. So, in this sec-
tion, we talk about some of the options that people have for getting the 
services they need at home and elsewhere. We urge you to plow ahead 
even though reading about this topic may be uncomfortable.
Knowing the types of long-term care available can help you and your family
members figure out what works best for all of you now, and in the future
should your needs change. Knowing your options helps you feel more in con-
trol and more prepared. The last thing you want to do is make a difficult long-
term care decision during a crisis, when you don’t have your wits about you.
And, remember, if your situation stabilizes and you find that your care needs
don’t increase, you haven’t lost anything except the time it took you to have
these discussions. (Chapter 20 gives you financial planning tips to help you
feel more prepared for whatever comes down the pike).
We strongly urge you to work as a team with your family members when
making long-term plans and decisions so that no one feels left out of the
process. This helps to ensure that everyone’s questions, feelings, and con-
cerns can be heard and dealt with. If you find it difficult to begin the conver-
sation, get some help: Your neurologist, nurse, or the National MS Society
(call 800-FIGHT-MS) can help you think through the options and identify good
facilities in your area. A mental health professional can help your family talk
with each other more comfortably, ensuring that each person’s feelings and
ideas get to be heard. This shouldn’t be a conversation about who’s doing
what to whom — it should be about what options work best for all of you.
Defining long-term care
The term long-term care refers to a wide range of services designed to help
you or a family member carry out daily life activities. These services run the
gamut from housekeeping help, personal assistance in your home, adult day
health programs, and respite care to community assisted living options and
nursing home care. The number of options available may seem a bit mind-
blowing, so keep in mind that you can use the expertise of professionals called
care managers (also referred to as care coordinators or case managers).
201
Chapter 13: Coping with Advanced MS

These professionals can help you sort it all out, generally on a fee-for-service
basis. Care managers specialize in information and referral, patient advocacy,
and coordination of health and social services. In other words, they can be
your eyes and ears in the search for community resources and your naviga-
tor as you sort out options and make decisions. For information about local
care manager options, contact the National MS Society at (800) FIGHT-MS.
Most of the services we talk about here have traditionally been geared
toward the elderly. Not too surprisingly, younger adults with disabilities 
want opportunities to socialize with people their own age, to participate in
age-appropriate activities, to have access to the most up-to-date computer
technology, and to be able to choose from the kinds of menus that appeal 
to them. The good news is that a lot of progress has been made toward 
identifying the unique needs of younger folks with disabilities. You can call
the National MS Society at (800) FIGHT-MS for help in identifying whatever
resources in your area may be more suited to your needs.
Getting help in your home
When looking for help in your home, the two primary options are hiring
someone from a community home care agency or finding someone on 
your own. Although each option has advantages and disadvantages as 
well as different cost implications, a home helper generally offers the 
following services:
 Companionship and supervision
 Assistance with basic housekeeping tasks, including light cleaning, 
cooking, and errands
 Personal care, including assistance with dressing, bathing, going to 
the bathroom, and grooming
 Nursing care, including help with medications and certain kinds of 
medical procedures
 Rehabilitation services, including physical therapy, occupational 
therapy, speech/language therapy, and social work services
For some great tips on how to hire help at home, check out Hiring Help at Home:
The Basic Facts at www.nationalmssociety.org/hiringhelp as well as the
information for family caregivers provided by the National Association for Home
Care & Hospice at www.nahc.org/famcaregiver.html.

Part III: Staying Healthy and Feeling Well 

Looking into adult day care
Adult day programs, which are sponsored by various community agencies,
provide a range of social and wellness programs, as well as some personal
care. The services available in adult day programs generally include:
 Meals
 Social activities
 Rehabilitation therapies
 Counseling
 Personal care
 Nursing assistance

services, call (800) FIGHT-MS or go to www.nationalmssociety.org/

Long-term care resources
It wasn’t too many years ago that people facing
long-term care decisions had no resources to
help them. Rest assured that the National MS
Society (800-FIGHT-MS or 800-344-4867) is aware
of community resources and is happy to help you
and your family members with any decisions you
have to make. You can also get valuable infor-
mation from the following resources:

Identifying assisted living options
Many communities have assisted living residences where a person who needs
help with daily activities can receive individualized support and healthcare
services. The goal of these facilities is to provide people with the assistance
they need while at the same time ensuring them safety and as much indepen-
dence as possible. Assisted living residences typically provide the following
services:
 A call system for emergencies
 Meals in a common area, if needed or wanted
 Housekeeping
 Transportation to doctor appointments and social events
 Medication management
 Health promotion programs
 Social programs
Assisted living residences may offer single rooms, studio apartments, or
larger apartments, and they may stand alone or be part of a larger healthcare
facility that offers various types of living and care options. You can get the
National MS Society’s guidelines on assisted living by calling (800) FIGHT-MS
or on the Web site at www.nationalmssociety.org/prcpublications.
Considering nursing home care
Nursing home care is an option when you feel that you’ve exhausted all other
possibilities. Even though no one wants to think about moving into a nursing
facility, you may find it comforting to know that they exist if safe care at
home is simply no longer possible. As difficult as it may be to believe, a good
nursing home can sometimes enhance the quality of life for someone with
severe disabilities. Some of the benefits of nursing home care include
 Twenty-four hour care by qualified staff members
 Opportunities to participate in social and recreational programs
 A sense of safety and security that’s no longer possible at home
 Assistance for a family member whose health and well-being are being
severely affected by caregiving activities
The National MS Society’s guidelines for nursing home care are available by call-
ing (800) FIGHT-MS or at www.nationalmssociety.org/prcpublications.

Important Tips for Caregivers
This section is for those of you who are caring for a loved one with MS.
Particularly as a person’s MS progresses, the medical team’s focus will
increasingly be on his or her medical, psychological, and social needs. So,
you may find yourself feeling “out in the cold” — and rightly so. MS literature
sometimes refers to caregivers, particularly partners in the caregiving role,
as “the invisible patient” because their needs tend to go unnoticed. Because
you may be the sole supporter of your own cause, here are some important
things that you can do to ensure your own health and well-being:
 Remember that your physical and emotional health are just as impor-
tant as your partner’s. The caregiving role is both demanding and drain-
ing, and we know that caregivers tend to neglect their own health while
caring for the other person. If you have trouble remembering to take
care of yourself, keep in mind the flight attendant’s message on every
flight: “If you’re traveling with a child or someone needing assistance,
put your own oxygen mask on first and then assist the other person.” In
others words, you can’t be of much help to someone else if you don’t
first take care of yourself. So, make sure you
• Follow the recommended health prevention and screening mea-
sures for your age group.
• Carve out time for your own relaxation and recreation.
• Seek out support for yourself as needed.
 Speak up on your own behalf. Particularly if your partner’s MS
becomes more advanced, the physician may recommend a treatment or
strategy that involves you, without spending a lot of time thinking about
the treatment’s impact on your life, health, or comfort. For example, the
doctor may recommend that you assist with a stretching regimen or
with the other person’s medications. Or, he or she may suggest that 
you help with the activities of daily living, such as bathing, dressing, 
or going to the bathroom.
If, because of your own work schedule, health needs, or other issues, you
feel that you can’t follow the doctor’s recommendations, it’s important to
say so. It doesn’t do anyone any good when the doctor recommends an
intervention that isn’t workable. Either the doctor or the National MS
Society (800-FIGHT-MS) can work with you to figure out what resources
you can tap for assistance.
205
Chapter 13: Coping with Advanced MS

 Learn how to ask for help from others. The best strategy when asking
for help is to be specific. Instead of saying to your relative, friend, or
neighbor, “I really need some help,” you’ll get far better results by being
more specific. No one can read your mind, and most people don’t want
to risk offending you by guessing. So, instead, try “I’d like to get out to
do some errands on Friday — could you stay with Jim from 2 p.m. to 
4 p.m. so I don’t have to worry about leaving him alone?” Or, “Jane
needs to get to the doctor next Monday at 3 p.m. and I have to be out 
of town. Could you possibly take her?” Most people are happy to help
when they know what you need and when.
 Don’t assume you can do it all alone. Depending on your partner’s
needs, you may need to consider hiring some additional assistance. You
can choose from a variety of types and levels of assistance that are avail-
able from outside agencies (check out the section “Discovering Long-
Term Care Services” earlier in the chapter for details). The members of
your healthcare team or the National MS Society can help you identify
assistance options in your area.
 Let others know that this is about you too. You may get awfully tired 
of hearing “Oh, how’s Mary doing?” or “What’s the doctor saying about
Hank’s MS these days?” People tend to forget that MS involves the whole
family, not just the person who has it. It may not be worth it for those
who ask in passing, but it’s important to let the people closest to you
know that you’d like them to ask about you too. You can generally get
the ball rolling by putting a word in here and there about yourself. Or,
you can just be dead honest and say something like, “You know, it would
really make me feel good if you could ask me how I’m doing too, because
even though Steve is the one with MS, I’m living with it too!”

your life. You may be the one with the diagnosis and
the symptoms, but there are people at home and at work
who care about you and are affected by what’s going on
with you. Most folks will take their cue from you, so in this
part we give you lots of suggestions about how to talk
with others about your multiple sclerosis. We also guide
you through some of the family and parenting issues that
are likely to come up along the way.

Chapter 14
Presenting Your MS Face 
to the World
In This Chapter
 Educating others about your MS
 Talking about your MS in a dating situation
 Communicating the amount of help you need
You probably thought that dealing with your own feelings about being
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) was hard enough. Well, guess what?
You have to deal with everyone else’s feelings as well. This task wouldn’t 
be so difficult if all the people in your life reacted in the same way, or if you
could predict what the various responses might be. But, the reality is that
each person’s response reflects his or her personality, communication style,
emotional reactions to the news, and — most importantly — knowledge about
MS. So, you need to be prepared to educate, explain, comfort, and reassure
(or whatever else is called for). The bottom line, however, is that people will
take their cues from you: The way you see your MS and present it to the
world is the way they’ll tend to see it too.
In this chapter, we talk about tricky stuff, such as how to deal with the person
who starts crying about your MS, the one who tells you all about what hap-
pened to her best friend’s cousin, or the friend who doesn’t say anything at
all. We also suggest ways to ask for help and how to politely turn it down, and
we discuss when and how to talk about MS with someone you’re dating. (Check
out Chapter 17 for advice on how to talk about MS with your children.)
Explaining Your MS to Others
The first step in preparing yourself to deal with the reactions of others is to
put on your teaching hat. If you want others to understand you and your MS,
you’re the one who’s going to have to educate them.

Providing the basics
A person’s knowledge of MS can range from nothing at all (“What’s that? Oh,
it’s that telethon disease, right?”) to know-it-all (“You really need to go to
Timbuktu for that cure I read about last week on the Internet — it’s a mira-
cle!” or “Oh, I know what that is. My aunt has had it for 50 years and you
could never tell it to look at her!” or “My friend’s mother has that and she’s in
a nursing home.”). So, you need to be ready to tell people what MS is and
isn’t, and how it’s affecting you and your life.
Like any other teacher, you need to start by learning your subject. Educating
yourself — with this book and the other helpful resources that are out 
there (see Appendix B) — prepares you to answer questions and correct 
misinformation.
The National Multiple Sclerosis Society, as you may already know, is one valu-
able resource. Brochures describing virtually every aspect of life with multi-
ple sclerosis are available from the Society’s Web site at www.nationalms
society.org/brochures or by calling (800) FIGHT-MS (800-344-4867). What
Everyone Should Know About Multiple Sclerosis (suitable for the whole family),
What is Multiple Sclerosis?, and Living with MS are great brochures to give to
anyone who has a lot of questions or gives you that “deer-in-headlights” look.
One of the most important pieces of information to share with others is that
MS is a variable and unpredictable disease that affects each person differ-
ently. So, after you’ve given them the basic information about MS (which you
can either describe in your own words or provide via print materials), the
next task is to tell them about your MS. Here are some tips:
 Clarify for people that you’re not one of “Jerry’s Kids.” The Jerry
Lewis Telethon is for muscular dystrophy, which is a neuromuscular dis-
ease that primarily affects children. Instead, remind them that multiple
sclerosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease that affects the central
nervous system, primarily in adults.
 Explain that MS affects different people in different ways. Tell them
that although some people with MS become severely disabled, most
don’t. Emphasize that your MS is your own and that nobody else’s will
be exactly the same.
 Reassure those who burst into tears. People may burst into tears just
when you’re feeling a bit in need of comfort yourself. Reassure them that
several effective medications are available to treat MS and that you’re
doing all the recommended things to take care of yourself. You can also
tell them that it’s okay to spend the next five minutes feeling sad together,
but then you’d much prefer to talk about the other stuff that’s going on
in your life and theirs. This is particularly helpful when you just don’t
have the emotional energy to cheer someone else up about your disease.
210
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

 Depending on how much information you’re looking to share, you can
describe the ways that MS affects you. This is a good opportunity to
explain how variable symptoms can be from morning to evening or from
one day to the next. You also want to give people a feel for some of those
symptoms they can’t readily see, such as severe fatigue, numbness or
tingling, pain, or problems with attention or memory.
If they’re interested in finding out more about any of the symptoms you
have, or other symptoms that a person with MS might have, you can
offer them a booklet from the National MS Society (for example, Fatigue:
What You Should Know, Gait or Walking Problems: The Basic Facts, or
Vision Problems: The Basic Facts).
 Dodge fad “cures” and “miracle” drugs. In response to well-meaning
advice about what medications to take, cures to try, or foods to eat or
not eat, the best strategy is usually to explain that you and your neurolo-
gist are working together to choose the best management strategies for
your particular disease course and symptoms.
Dealing with common reactions
Even though you can’t predict exactly how the people in your life are likely to
respond to your MS diagnosis, you’re likely to encounter some fairly common
reactions at one time or another from family, friends, and colleagues. Here
are some suggestions for how to deal with them.
Handling “How are you?”
People ask the question “How are you?” many times a day, often without even
thinking about it. However, now when you hear it, it may not feel like such a
simple question any more. When someone asks you how you are, it will be up
to you to decide how much they really want to know and how much you want
to say. Read on for some clues.
The fact is that most people who ask don’t really care — they’re just being
polite and making small talk. So, we recommend not wasting your energy
trying to tell them the truth if it’s going to take a while. If you suddenly
launch into a detailed account of what does and doesn’t feel good that day,
most people will be pretty startled. So, for the folks who are just making
polite conversation, a simple “fine, thanks” should do the trick.
For the people close to you, who really do want to know how things are
going, you have some options: If there’s time, and you’re in the mood, you
can fill them in. If you’re busy doing or thinking about other things and don’t
want to be distracted by your MS at the moment, you can say something like,
“Let’s get a cup of coffee later and I’ll fill you in on all the gritty details.” Or, a
simple “Pretty much the same” works, too.
211
Chapter 14: Presenting Your MS Face to the World

But what about those people who gaze at you mournfully and say “How are
you?” as though you’re at death’s door? You need to decide whether the
person who’s asking is someone who really cares about you and how you’re
doing or just likes hearing about someone else’s problems. Many people find
it easiest to just say (with a surprised, quizzical look) “Why fine, thanks! How
about yourself?”
Fielding the “But you look so good!” comment
Just when you’re hoping that the important people in your life get what
you’re saying about your MS, you’re likely to hear this very common
response from family members, friends, and colleagues: “But you look so
good!” Figuring out how to respond to this double-edged sword can pose
quite a challenge. On the one hand, it’s always nice to know that others think
you look good. On the other hand, this is a tough comment to hear when
you’re feeling really crummy — exhausted, numb and tingly, or weak as a wet
noodle. Interpreting the underlying message of this comment is even tougher.
Is the person trying to reassure and encourage you? Or is the real message a
bit of a dig: “You look too good to be sick, so why aren’t you doing all the
things I need you to do for me?”
Your best strategy for responding to this comment is probably to try and sort
out the underlying message before giving a response. If the person is an
acquaintance or someone with whom you don’t have a close family or work-
ing relationship, you may just want to say “thank you” and move on. If, how-
ever, it’s someone close to you, who needs to understand that there’s more to
MS than meets the eye, you may want to consider the following options:
 “I’m afraid that what you see isn’t always what you get! I wish I felt as
good on the inside as I seem to look on the outside. Unfortunately, MS
has a lot of symptoms that don’t show.”
 “Thanks — but today’s not one of my better days. Could I have rain
check, please? This MS fatigue is really killing me. Maybe we could post-
pone our dinner for another night.”
 “I know I promised to take you to the mall today, but my vision is too
blurry to drive right now. Let’s see whether it’s better tomorrow after
I’ve had a chance to rest, and we can try then.”
 “The heat and humidity are really getting to me — I feel like I can hardly
move. Would you mind if we had the meeting in my office where it’s
cooler? Plus, that saves me from having to walk all the way to the confer-
ence room.”
The key here is that you’re the teacher, so decide how much information you
want to share, and be prepared to explain some of the less visible ways MS
can affect you.
212
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

Responding to unsolicited advice
Whether you want it or not, you’re likely to get a lot of advice from people
about how to take care of yourself and manage your life. Our patients tell us
that they’re always being sent little newspaper and magazine clippings filled
with information about the latest “MS cure” or health fad.
Family members, friends, and colleagues may weigh in on everything from
treatment decisions (take something — don’t take something) and employment
decisions (quit — don’t quit), to family-planning decisions (have children —
don’t have children), and dietary decisions (eat this — don’t eat that). When
you’re first diagnosed and still trying to figure out what’s what, the advice
may feel great. But then you discover that what one person says is the com-
plete opposite of what someone else says. Even when you talk to other
people with MS, you get contradictory suggestions for managing the disease.
Most people who give advice are doing so out of care and concern for you.
The upside of this is that they’re reaching out to provide help and support.
The downside is that some people get really cranky when you don’t do what
they suggest. The best strategy with the cranky folks is just to say “thank
you” and let them know that you (and your partner) will be thinking carefully
about all these decisions with the help of your healthcare team. You can read
more about getting comfortable with treatment and lifestyle decisions in
Chapter 3.
Understanding that silence doesn’t always mean someone doesn’t care
Sometimes it happens that people clam up when faced with an uncomfort-
able situation. For example, say you tell a good friend or colleague that
you’ve been diagnosed with MS and you hear nothing from him or her but
silence. Or, maybe you’re having a really bad day and no one seems to be
offering any help with that heavy door or that stack of papers you dropped.
Or, perhaps you come back to work with a new cane after being treated for a
relapse and people look uncomfortable but don’t say anything.
You wonder what’s going on, right? Okay, so some people aren’t very nice
and they don’t care, but generally that’s not the case. Here are some other
possibilities to consider:
 An MS diagnosis is a shock for them as well as for you. When people
don’t know what to say or how to say it, they sometimes say nothing at
all. They may need a little time — and a little help from you — to know
how to respond.
 When people don’t offer help, it’s often because they don’t know
whether you want it. We talk more about this in the “Communicating
Your Needs” section later in this chapter, but, for now, keep in mind that
213
Chapter 14: Presenting Your MS Face to the World

no one can read your mind. People who want to help but don’t want to
embarrass you or hurt your feelings may hold back until you give the
signal — by asking for assistance or taking their arm, for example.
 When you show up with a new mobility device or helpful gadget,
people may wait to see whether you’re going to talk about it. They
may be curious, concerned, or even excited to see you using a helpful
new tool, but they may also be reluctant to ask a question or make a
comment. Again, you need to lead the way. If you’re willing or even eager
to talk about it, an introductory comment from you will inevitably lead
to questions and comments from others.
Remembering that MS is part 
of you but not all of you
You — as well as the family members, friends, and colleagues you decide to
talk to about your MS — may sometimes need a reminder that you’re still you
in spite of whatever changes the MS brings along.
If you become so preoccupied with your MS that it’s all you think or talk
about, other people will follow your lead. They may happily talk about noth-
ing but MS for awhile, but eventually most will get bored with the subject and
start to distance themselves from you. Even though MS is probably the
biggest thing on your mind, it’s important to remember that the people close
to you still want to connect with the you they knew before. Just like before
you were diagnosed, your ideas, interests, opinions, and sense of humor are
still important to them.

Showing off your equipment
No, we don’t mean that kind of equipment.
People’s reactions to mobility aids, such as
canes and electric scooters will vary tremen-
dously, so be careful not to jump to conclusions.
One of our patients waited months before
deciding to use her new scooter in public. She
was very embarrassed and sure that people
would stare and feel sorry for her. During her
public “debut,” a man ran up and said, “What a
great gadget — where did you get it? I want to
get one for my wife. Do they come in blue?”
Maybe the fact that her scooter was scarlet red
and looked pretty spiffy made it easier for this
man to break the ice. So, keep in mind that most
types of mobility equipment now come in
designer colors and some, like canes, for exam-
ple, can be decorated in a variety of ways.
Believe it or not, mobility aids can make a fash-
ion statement. Refer to Chapter 7 for more info
on assistive technology.

On the other hand, if you avoid the subject and people still insist on treating
you like a sick person — talking only about your health, your symptoms, or
your medications — it’s time to help them shift the focus. You can remind them
that your life is full of things besides MS. Here are some strategies to try:
 Introduce other subjects to let them know that you like to think and talk
about other things.
 Ask about them — their life, loves, kids, work, and health — to show
how important they are to you.
 Make a date for an outing or activity to let them know that you’re still up
for fun and excitement.
 If they don’t take the hint, tell them that you like to get on with your life
and keep your MS on the back burner whenever possible.
 If you get really desperate, tell them that talking about MS all the time is
really boring.
 Go the extra mile to help people get to know you and see what’s behind
your mobility equipment.
Disclosing Your Diagnosis 
to a Prospective Partner
Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed in the 20s, 30s, and 40s, when many
people are looking for their significant others. Dating isn’t all that easy under
215
Chapter 14: Presenting Your MS Face to the World
Thanks, but I can speak for myself
In today’s high-style, high-speed, youth/health-
oriented culture, many people aren’t all that
comfortable with illness or disability. When
meeting you for the first time, some people may
assume that because you have difficulty walk-
ing, for example, you can’t hear, think, or talk
either. Or they may assume that you won’t have
much to offer them. Even though your patience
may be stretched to the limit, this is an opportu-
nity to educate people and help them feel more
comfortable. Give them a chance to get to know
you and pretty soon they’ll see you and begin to
forget about the mobility aid. As an example,
consider the following situation: Sarah and John
were out for dinner to celebrate their anniver-
sary. They picked a handicapped accessible
restaurant so that John wouldn’t have any diffi-
culty maneuvering around the tables in his
motorized scooter. When the server approached
the table to take their order, she turned to Sarah
and said, “What would he like for dinner?” Sarah
smiled at the server and said, “He’ll be happy to
let you know what he wants.” John, recognizing
that the world has a lot to learn about MS, and
disability in general, simply said, “Thanks — I’ll
have the steak, medium-rare, please.”

the best of circumstances, so getting diagnosed with a chronic illness obvi-
ously adds another challenge. No one likes rejection, and everyone tries to
find ways to avoid it. So, it may be tempting at times to leave the playing field
in order to avoid the risk of being hurt or rejected by someone who’s turned
off by your MS. However, the result of that strategy isn’t so comfy either. This
section gives you some ideas of how to present your MS in the dating world.
Say you’re about to go out on a date with this incredibly attractive person
you’ve been eyeing for a long time. Your MS is behaving pretty well at the
moment and you’re wondering whether you should talk about it. Or, perhaps a
friend has fixed you up with someone she “knows you’ll just love.” Now you’re
trying to figure out whether to bring your cane so you’ll feel steadier on your
feet or whether you should tough it out and hope for the best in the two-inch
heels you’ve been dying to wear. Or, maybe you want to ask someone out but
you’re just not sure whether you have an obligation to talk about your MS.
You may even be wondering whether the dating part of your life is over —
because, after all, who would want to get into a relationship with a person
who has MS? The truth of the matter is that people with MS do go on dates,
fall in love, and find partners for life. However, in addition to the challenges
described endlessly in popular magazines, there are a few added ones for
those living with an unpredictable illness. The starting point for dealing with
these challenges is communication.
Here are some helpful hints for making dating a little easier:
 Reaching out to a new person always involves some risk and nobody
ever knows what the final outcome will be until they try. Even though
it’s true that some people may be put off by your MS, others won’t be,
particularly if you remember to show off your whole self, of which MS is
only a part.
 A first date doesn’t have to be a show-all, tell-all event (although that
can be fun too!). Don’t feel like you have to start with a “Hello, my name
is Harry and I have MS” declaration. Your goal the first time you’re out
with someone is to figure out whether it was worth your time and effort
and if you ever want to see that person again.
If you have any visible symptoms — your leg drags or you use a cane to
help with balance — you have the option to explain it, but you don’t
have to. The bottom line is that you don’t owe any information on a first
date that you’re not comfortable sharing.
 After you know that the other person is someone you want to spend
more time with, get to know better, and develop more of a relation-
ship with, start sharing more information. A very good rule of thumb is
to ask yourself when you would want to know similar information about
the other person.
Most people have issues in their lives — health-, family-, or work-related
issues — that they have some concerns about sharing. Generally when
216
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

people with MS begin talking about their health issues, they find that
other people have one thing or another to share as well.
 When you decide that it’s time to talk about your MS, you need to be
prepared to let the person react in his or her own way. This may be
difficult. One person may come back at you with a lot of questions, while
another may dismiss it with “Oh, that’s no big deal.” Or, another person
may clam up.
It’s a good idea to plan ahead a bit: Consider your personal style: Do you
tend to use a lot of humor or are you more comfortable with facts and
figures? Also consider the other person’s style and try to anticipate possi-
ble reactions, questions, or concerns. This is where you need to don your
teaching hat (refer to the “Explaining Your MS to Others” section earlier in
this chapter for more info on how to teach others about your MS). And
then you need to sit back and give the person time and space to react.
You may think that the best strategy is to put off talking about your MS until the
relationship is really solid. Even though this may be tempting, the better strat-
egy is to take the risk early on — before you’ve invested your heart and soul.
Long-term relationships are full of challenges, with or without MS thrown in.
Just think — no matter what the situation, a relationship requires you to be able
to communicate comfortably, problem-solve together, and work effectively as a
team. Even though it may be scary to think about discussing your diagnosis,
your current symptoms and treatments, and the unpredictability of MS, avoid-
ing these topics in the early days of a relationship is a set-up for stress and con-
flict down the road. It’s impossible to build a strong relationship on a foundation
of half-truths. Instead, it’s better to get it all out in the open so that you can
begin to work together to address this and other challenges in your lives.
217
Chapter 14: Presenting Your MS Face to the World
Don’t wait: Last minute disclosures are risky
We heard a story recently about a young man
who told his fiancée about his MS on the eve of
their wedding. When asked why she cancelled
the wedding, she responded that it had nothing
to do with his having MS — that she could
handle. The reason was that he hadn’t trusted
her enough with this important part of his life.
For her, honesty and trust were far more impor-
tant than MS. Had the young man taken the risk
of disclosing his diagnosis early on, he would
have saved himself a lot of worry and discov-
ered something pretty nice about the woman he
loved. This story underlines that having, or not
having, MS is seldom the most important factor
in a relationship.
So, even though talking about your MS with
someone you really like is difficult, it’s far better
to get it out in the open early on. Everyone
needs to find out how a prospective life partner
feels about important life issues and you may be
pleasantly surprised to discover that MS isn’t
the most important thing you bring to the table.

Communicating Your Needs
Even though you may feel like it some days, your MS isn’t written all over
your face. Particularly if you’re dealing with any of the disease’s less visible
symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, bladder problems, or cognitive
changes, other people may not have a clue what’s going on with you or what
you may need — or not need — from them. We’ve already said this, but it
bears repeating: No one can read your mind. It’s up to you to let people know
when, and if, you need something from them and how they can be of most
help. And by the way, don’t assume you can read their minds either: The fact
that people don’t jump to offer assistance doesn’t mean that they don’t care.
Two-way communication is the key.
Giving clear messages
You may have mixed feelings about getting assistance from others. On the
one hand, you want to do all the things you used to do, just the way you used
to do them. On the other hand, some days are better than others and some
tasks are harder than they used to be. When it’s a good day, you want to do
everything yourself and you want others to know that you can. When it’s a
bad day, though, you wish someone would step up to the plate and help. The
problem, of course, is that people aren’t likely to know what kind of day
you’re having unless you tell them. See the sidebar “You can’t have your cake
and eat it too” for a case in point.
218

You can’t have your cake and eat it too
Sandra’s husband, Jim, was in a no-win situa-
tion. He wanted to be helpful to his wife but
could never seem to figure out how and when
to help. Sandra had always been a fiercely inde-
pendent person who liked to do things in her
own way and in her own time. When she was
diagnosed with MS, Sandra made a point of
saying that she wanted to remain as indepen-
dent as possible. So, to respect her wishes, Jim
tried to hold back and wait to be asked before
he helped. But he quickly figured out that
Sandra was pretty ticked off at him for not help-
ing out more. When he finally asked what the
problem was, she told him, “If you really love
me, you would know when I was feeling
crummy and needed your help.” Poor Jim. The
truth is that even people who love you a lot
won’t necessarily know how you feel unless you
tell them. In fact, the people who love you the
most may be so concerned about hurting your
feelings or doing the wrong thing that they find
it hard to do anything at all. Too much guess-
work is an emotional minefield. So, the solution
is to have a “heart-to-heart” talk about how
you’re going to let the other person know what
you need and when — whether it’s assistance
of some kind, a pat on the back on a really good
day, or just a hug.

The best strategy for communicating your needs is to ask for help when you
need it and to thank people and politely decline when you don’t. However,
when you do need help, always be sure to let people know exactly what kind
of assistance would be most useful to you.
Staking out your independence
Everyone gives help in a slightly different way: Some people do it by telling
you what to do; others by offering to do things for you (or simply doing them
without asking); and some by asking whether you want help with anything.
The last group is the easiest to deal with because they’re relying on you to
tell them if and when you need their assistance. The first two groups are more
challenging because they assume that they already know what you need.
Your best strategy when dealing with those people who think that they know
best is to thank them for their care and concern and promise them that you’ll
let them know when you need assistance. The important message to get across
to them is that doing things for yourself — even if it takes a bit longer than it
used to — is a source of pride and satisfaction that you don’t want to give up.
If you’re experiencing problems with walking or balance, you may find that
some people — particularly those who love you the most — begin to hover
protectively. If you find people looking like they’re ready to catch you at any
moment (or standing as far away as possible so they won’t get crushed),
that’s a pretty good sign that you appear unsteady and at risk.
Even though the decision to use a mobility aid is distressing for many people
(we talk about this in Chapter 7), using one is an effective way of letting the
people around you know that you’re doing everything that you can to get
around safely and independently. It sends a clear message: “I have some diffi-
culty with walking, balance, or fatigue, and I’m dealing with it.” The important
benefit here is that people will feel more relaxed and comfortable around
you, instead of worrying all the time about what help you might need.
219
Chapter 14: Presenting Your MS Face to the World
Seriously, I’m not drunk!
Jack resisted using a mobility aid for quite some
time. Even though he had to rely on walls or fur-
niture to help him maintain his balance, Jack
was convinced that walking with a cane would
make him look disabled. One day as he was
making his way unsteadily down the street, a
passerby called out to him, “Why don’t you do
your drinking at home?” That was all Jack
needed to decide it was time for a cane. Not
only would the cane provide stability, it would
also send a clear message that his problem had
nothing to do with alcohol consumption.

P.S. The doctor can’t read your mind either
You’re a key player in your MS care. Neither the neurologic exam nor an MRI can
tell the doctor everything that’s going on in your body. This means that even
the most experienced of MS specialist physicians can’t do the job alone —
your input is essential.
Because the information you provide during your office visits enables your
doctor to formulate treatment recommendations, this is no time to put on a
show! Believe it or not, some patients cancel their appointments because
they aren’t feeling well (illogical, but true); some withhold information about
their symptoms because they don’t want to be a “bad” patient (even though
this isn’t school and no one is being graded); some put on a happy face
because they don’t want to be thought of as complainers (this isn’t a popular-
ity contest). We’ve even known patients who have told the doctor that every-
thing was fine because they didn’t want the doctor to “feel bad.”
The point is, your healthcare providers need information that only you can
provide. This information includes the following:
 Symptoms you’re experiencing
 Physical or emotional changes you’ve noticed since your last visit
 Problems or side effects you’re having with your medications
 Difficulties you’re having with everyday activities — at home and work
Unfortunately, your time with the doctor or nurse may be limited. So, the
best strategy for using that time well is to come prepared to talk about any
problems you’re having. If you’re only concerned about one issue at the
moment, give it all you’ve got: Make sure to describe what’s been happening
and how it’s affecting your daily life. If you have a whole litany of problems,
try to prioritize them in your own mind before telling the doctor. Chances are
that everything can’t be addressed at once, so you and the doctor need to
tackle the most important things first.
Some of the most common problems people have are the most difficult to
talk about. But, doctors and nurses don’t blush easily, and those who are
experienced in MS care know all about the bladder and bowel symptoms,
sexual issues, and problems with thinking and memory (we call those the big
three) that plague many people with MS. For heaven’s sake, don’t hold back.
And if your doctor never asks about these kinds of problems, or doesn’t seem
comfortable when you bring them up, it’s definitely time to start looking for
another doctor!

H
ere’s a visual for you: Imagine that a stranger shows up on your
doorstep one day. This stranger, who’s all loaded down with suitcases
and duffel bags, comes into your house, spreads his belongings throughout
each room, and refuses to go home. You’re the first one to meet this stranger,
but in no time you’re making introductions to the rest of the family. Over
time, each person in the family needs to develop some kind of relationship
with this new member of your household.
As you may have already noticed, multiple sclerosis (MS) plays the stranger
role well. It can easily take over your house and overwhelm your family. But,
we come to the rescue with this chapter. We talk about how families can find
room in the house for the MS stranger without giving it more space than it
actually needs. The process starts with a recognition of each person’s reac-
tions and feelings and continues with good old-fashioned communication.
Even though communication isn’t the easiest challenge, with it comes team-
work and the ability to deal with the messy stranger’s habits and quirks.
Addressing Your Family Members’
Feelings about Your Diagnosis
People who have been diagnosed with MS can have all sorts of reactions and
feelings over the course of the disease (see Chapter 3 for a complete discus-
sion). But, you have to remember that all of these same feelings are shared

by family members too. For example, here are just a few of the emotions that
your family may experience:
 Grief: This normal expression of loss is common. Just like the person with
MS, family members have developed a picture of their family and the life
they share together. When MS changes one member’s abilities to share in
activities or carry out his or her everyday responsibilities, there’s a sense
of loss. Family members may think “Our family is different, and things will
never be the same.” or “Who are we now that MS has changed our family?”
 Anxiety: This is a normal reaction among family members when some-
one they love has been diagnosed with MS. Children and adults share
some common concerns: They worry about what will happen to this
person — right now and over the long haul. They also worry about how
this illness will affect their own lives.
More specifically, the partner may wonder what will happen to the
couple’s plans and dreams, as well as to their partnership. The partner
may also worry that all the responsibility will fall into his or her hands.
The children may worry that their parent won’t be there to take care of
them, that they may catch the disease, or that they somehow caused the
disease (see Chapter 17 for more information about how to help children
with their concerns). And finally, aging parents may worry about who will
take care of their adult child after they’re gone and, more immediately, who
will be able to help them as they’re aging themselves (flip to the section
“When Your Child Has MS” later in this chapter for more on this topic).
 Anger: Partners and children as well as aging parents may feel anger
over this unexpected change in their lives.
“This isn’t what I signed up for!” is a very real feeling for some partners. “It’s
not fair that my dad can’t play ball with me!” is one variation on a pretty
common theme for kids who have a parent with MS. And older parents who
need to provide care for their disabled adult child may very well wonder
what happened to that peaceful, well-deserved retirement they’d been
anticipating for so long. Many times, angry family members look for some-
one to blame and somehow end up blaming each other or themselves.
 Guilt: This common feeling happens when a person feels responsible for a
family member’s MS. Parents and children are particularly prone to taking
the blame and feeling guilty. They may think “What did I do to cause this?”
Guilt is also a pretty common reaction to angry feelings that don’t seem
nice. For example, a partner may feel guilty for resenting an illness that
the other person didn’t ask for and can’t control.
The tricky thing about families is that no two people are likely to experience
or express these feelings at the same time or in exactly the same way. The
result can be a bumpy ride on an emotional roller coaster. So, put on your
seatbelts and get ready to acknowledge that each of you has a lot of feelings
about this stranger called MS, and that it’s going to take some time and prac-
tice to get comfortable with those feelings.
222
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

Communicating Effectively with 
Adult Family Members
Now that you’ve been diagnosed with MS, family life may feel a little different —
and you and your family may find it difficult to talk to each other about it. So,
just at the point when you need to communicate with one another about
what’s going on and what you’re going to do about it, talking feels really diffi-
cult. The rest of this chapter focuses on the strategies adults need to talk
comfortably with one another. We provide suggestions for talking with kids
about MS in Chapter 17.
Recognizing communication barriers
It’s common for people to have trouble talking to each other about stressful
or frightening things. Here are some reasons why a family living with MS may
find it difficult to discuss what’s going on:
 No two people have exactly the same coping style. One person clams up
while another person talks. Or maybe one person wants to forget about the
problem for as long as possible while the other wants to become an expert
on the subject. Given that MS keeps changing over time, it’s not too sur-
prising that people’s coping styles are likely to conflict on a routine basis.
The tendency, of course, is for everyone in the family to think his or her
own coping strategies are the best. The fact is, however, that family mem-
bers need to recognize and respect these individual differences before any
kind of comfortable conversation can take place. And, everyone needs to
be careful not to misinterpret the differences. For example, the fact that
your partner doesn’t want to read books about MS or go to support groups
doesn’t mean he or she doesn’t care or isn’t as sad or anxious as you are.
 People have a lot of misconceptions about MS. Each person’s ideas
about the disease are based on someone with MS that they have met or
read about. Because everyone’s MS is different, the result is a hodge-
podge of information. In addition, many people still confuse MS with
muscular dystrophy or other disabling diseases.
 Family members often worry about upsetting each other. In other
words, family members feel so protective of one another that none of
the tough stuff ever gets talked about.
For example, a partner may think to himself “She’s so worried about her
MS right now. I can’t possibly talk to her about how moody she has been
or about my concerns over our finances.” Or, he may think “She’s trying
so hard to have a positive attitude about her MS, I don’t see how I can
talk to her about planning for the future.” And, the person with MS may
be thinking to herself “My husband has already taken on so many extra
223
Chapter 15: Making MS a Part of the Family

chores around here, I can’t possibly tell him I don’t think I should be dri-
ving right now.”
 Some subjects are just uncomfortable. Sex, bladder and bowel, and cogni-
tive problems immediately come to mind. Under the very best of circum-
stances, many couples have trouble talking about sex. So, if MS begins to
interfere with sexual activities, talking about it may be too difficult — 
particularly if the couple didn’t talk about sex when it was great! The same
can be true for bladder and bowel symptoms. Not too many people feel
comfortable talking about bladder accidents or bowel problems — adults
just aren’t supposed to have to worry about those things. The common
theme here, of course, is embarrassment. These are touchy issues that
people find difficult to discuss — even with someone they love.
 The subject of money can generate a lot of heat in any family — with
or without a chronic disease to complicate things. More couples argue
about their finances than just about anything else. Given how costly MS
can be (take a look at the section “Coping with the direct and indirect
costs” later in this chapter for details), it isn’t too surprising that cou-
ples sometimes disagree on how the family’s resources should be
divvied up.
Communication is essential — it’s the foundation for just about everything
else that families have to do in order to live comfortably with MS. Without
effective communication, people can’t support one another or problem-solve
successfully.
Getting the ball rolling toward 
more open communication
Communication is a complex process, so don’t expect to be a pro right off 
the bat — most people aren’t. To get started, the following sections give you
some tips for communicating with your adult family members.
Acknowledge your different communication styles
The starting point for good communication is recognizing that each of you may
have a different way of going about it. For example, you strong, silent types may
need to think about approaching things more openly — at least as far as MS is
concerned. And you chatty types may need to remember that not everyone else
is as fired up to talk about everything in such great detail as you are. Your goal
should be to find common ground, beginning with the recognition that you can’t
begin to figure out how you’re going to incorporate MS into your lives without
talking about it.
224
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

Study up on MS
To enhance your communication, you need to make it a point to get better
acquainted with your illness. This doesn’t mean that you have to become the
world’s expert on MS, but you do need to know enough to make wise choices
and sound decisions. Many of these choices and decisions are going to affect
the whole family, so it’s important to be able to talk about them and share
opinions openly. Knowing your stuff and communicating it is the best way we
know of to avoid confusion, resentment, and “I told you so” conversations
down the line. Because people tend to like their information in different for-
mats, here’s a menu to consider:
 Reading materials: Printed stuff is great because you can take it with
you and indulge at your convenience. Books that are appropriate for all
ages are available at just about any bookstore or library (see the recom-
mended readings in Appendix B). Also, the National MS Society has a
library of brochures on virtually every aspect of MS. These brochures
are available online (www.nationalmssociety.org/brochures) or
by calling (800) FIGHT-MS (800-344-4867).
 National MS Society Web Spotlights: The Spotlight series is designed for
folks who want to zero in on a particular topic without having to hunt
around. You can access spotlights on a variety of topics at www.national
mssociety.org/spotlight. Each spotlight will point you toward all
the information on the site that relates to that topic.
 Online programs: These types of programs are attractive because you
can access them 24-7 and you don’t have to be sociable about it. Online
programs can be the perfect venue for those of you who aren’t comfort-
able disclosing your MS or seeing others who have it. The National MS
Society offers programs on a wide variety of topics (www.nationalms
society.org/webcasts). Many of the manufacturers of the MS med-
ications offer programs as well.
 Live programs: These programs are just the ticket for people who like
the personal touch. You can see the speaker and ask your questions first-
hand, meet others with MS and exchange war stories and tips, and get to
know a whole new group of people. Even though you may be reluctant to
meet folks whose MS is worse or better or different than yours, remem-
ber this: Many people find that getting to know others who are living and
dealing with different types of symptoms can actually be reassuring.
 Support groups: If you’re one of those people who feels more comfort-
able, less anxious, and less alone when getting information in a group
setting, support groups may be perfect for you. Call the National MS
Society (800-FIGHT-MS) or the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America
(800-532-7667) for information about local support groups.
For those who like the group feeling but don’t enjoy or can’t get to a
group meeting, chat rooms and bulletin boards also offer this kind of

supportive environment. Check out the National MS Society’s MS World
chat room at www.nationalmssociety.org/chat and the forums
offered by the MS Foundation at www.msfocus.org/services/
svc_forums.html. Keep in mind, however, that the information you
get will vary with its source — not everything you hear at a support
group or online chat will be relevant to you or accurate. So be sure to
check with your doctor or the National MS Society to verify any informa-
tion that feels iffy to you.
When accessing any information, pay attention to the source so you can be
on the lookout for subtle — or not so subtle — biases in the information.
Whereas the National MS Society and other nonprofit groups are committed
to providing unbiased information, the pharmaceutical companies are always
wearing two hats when they develop consumer information: They’re provid-
ing education about MS while trying to sell you their product.
Given all the avenues for accessing information, there’s no reason why you
and your partner or other family members need to pursue the same ones.
The challenge is for each of you to find out your favorite way to gather infor-
mation, and then figure out how to talk about it.
Make the time to talk
Given how busy everyday life is, it’s easy to keep putting MS conversations
on the back burner, particularly when you’re a little uncomfortable about
them in the first place. So, you may need to set aside some special time for
this. It’s important that you have some time when you won’t be interrupted
by kids or phone calls and that you have plenty of time to share everything
that’s on your minds (sort of like sex!). You may even think about scheduling
regular times — a Sunday afternoon walk or a dinner out — to make sure that
these conversations get the attention they need.

Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 
A note about communicating long distance
For those of you who have parents or siblings
that live far away, you need to think about what
information to share and when. Families who
are spread out tend to have different rules about
sharing health information. Some families talk
about absolutely everything (aches and pains,
doctor visits, medical tests, diagnoses, treat-
ments, and so on) — it’s the shared expectation
and everyone does it. Other families are more
private, and they don’t share any information
until there’s a treatment plan in place or a
funeral (and maybe not even then).
Think about what the rules are in your family
and whether they may need to be tweaked a
tad. We advocate openness about health
issues, but it’s really up to you. Keep in mind,
however, that after your loved ones know about
your MS, they’ll have reactions, questions, and
concerns. And, the fact that your loved ones
can’t see you readily will usually heighten their
anxiety. So, be prepared to educate, answer
questions, and give periodic updates. Parents,
in particular, tend to hover. They are, after all,
still parents.

Avoid competition
Because everyone in the family is affected when MS joins the family, family
members sometimes have a tendency to get into a contest about who has it
worse — the person with the diagnosis or those whose lives have been
changed by a disease they don’t even have. This happens most when people
don’t have a comfortable way to talk about their feelings. The feelings stay
bottled up and everyone feels unsupported. And when people start feeling
unsupported they begin to say things like this:
 “You have no idea how I feel. MS is changing my whole life, I feel lousy,
and you just keep going on about your business as though nothing were
wrong.”
 “You have no idea how I feel. I’m doing all the work around here — on
top of my full-time job. I don’t have any time for myself any more, and
you’re always too tired to do anything fun.”
 “Just ’cause Mom’s got MS, I’m stuck with more chores than any other
kid I know.”
Families do best when they can lay the blame on the MS rather than on each
other. This reduces unhelpful competition and labels the problem for what it
is — a challenge that everyone in the family needs to meet. Some families we
know have even given the MS a name — like Fred or Marietta — to help them
remember that their shared goal is figuring out how to live with the MS.
Get a jump-start if you need it
Sometimes getting started is the most difficult part of communicating.
Families that don’t have a lot of practice with this kind of communication
may need to practice a bit to get the hang of it. Educational meetings and
support groups can be good places to practice.
For those of you who like to get your practice more privately, family thera-
pists can be a great resource to help you start the conversation. Call the
National MS Society at (800) FIGHT-MS for the names of therapists in your
community who have experience with chronic illness and disability issues.
Keeping the Family Rhythm Going so
Your MS Doesn’t Steal the Show
All families have a rhythm of their own. You may not hear the music playing
in the background, but over time, each family establishes patterns, proce-
dures, and schedules for everyday living. This rhythm is part of what pro-
vides the feelings of safety and security that people look for from family life.
Unfortunately, MS can disrupt your family’s rhythm just the way that having
227
Chapter 15: Making MS a Part of the Family

weekend visitors temporarily changes the way you do things. But, because
this visitor isn’t going home, your challenge is to figure out how to fit MS into
your lives with the least amount of disruption possible.
MS can be greedy. From time to time it can tap all the family’s resources —
money, energy, and time being the most obvious. This is why it’s important to
give MS some space in your life without giving it more than it needs. Every
member of the family is at a different place in his or her life, and each needs a
share in the family’s resources. If MS saps too much of any of these resources,
the result is a disabled family — rather than a family with one person who
has a disability.
Coping with the direct and indirect costs
The direct and indirect costs of MS in this country come to almost $60,000
per person per year (for an annual cost of $24 billion!). About half of this is
related specifically to healthcare (medications, doctor visits, hospitaliza-
tions, and so on). The rest is accounted for by lost wages, unpaid caregiving
activities, and other items. Fortunately, most people with MS have good
health insurance coverage (flip to Chapter 19 for a detailed discussion of
insurance issues). Nevertheless, the out-of-pocket expenses can be high.
Because the expenses for MS are high, we urge families to consult a financial
planner early on. Even though it’s never possible to predict how your MS will
progress, or what expenses will be involved, it’s a safe bet that you’ll come
across expenses that you never counted on having. A planner can help you
anticipate possible expenses and identify strategies to meet these expenses
should they arise (see Chapter 20 for some financial planning strategies).
One of the reasons that financial planning is so important is that MS isn’t the
only hungry mouth waiting to be fed. Summer camp, orthodontia, vacations,
college expenses, and retirement are always on the sidelines waiting for their
fair share of the pot. Unfortunately, these typical life expenses don’t disap-
pear just because MS comes along. The goal is to ensure that MS doesn’t take
more of the pie than necessary.
Managing energy and time
One of the big complaints about MS is that it takes a lot of time and effort. For
the person with MS, the drain on time and effort is more obvious — it may take
longer, with a greater amount of effort than before, to get the same things done.
Simply getting around can sometimes be exhausting. In fact, basic activities
may take so much of the person’s energy that little is left over for extras, 
228
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

particularly if he or she is experiencing MS-related fatigue (check out Chapter 7
for info on this and other symptoms).
But, family members may feel their energy being drained as well. They may
be pitching in to help with various activities, or they may be taking on more
responsibilities than they had before. Everyone may find that MS calls on
them to be more flexible, more creative, and more solution-focused — all of
which can sometimes feel extremely tiring. In fact, another complaint from
families is that “nothing is spontaneous any more” — they feel that every-
thing takes more planning, more prep time, and more work.
Here are some strategies for making sure that your family’s energy resources
are used wisely:
 Focus on what’s most important. The key lies in figuring out where 
you — individually and collectively — want to focus your time and
energy resources. Then, you should let those priorities guide your
choices and plans. (Check out the section “Establishing family priori-
ties” later in this chapter for details.)
 Make sure that your home is arranged to maximize accessibility,
safety, comfort, and ease of operation. Doing so will enable the person
with MS to navigate safely and independently while saving all of you a
lot of time and energy. An occupational therapist can advise you on this
kind of environmental design (see Chapter 4). And after you’ve arranged
the house the way you want it, try to remember that keeping things in
their proper places means less searching and organizing.
 Make every effort to plan strategically. Whether it’s errands, a family
outing, a household project, or a holiday gathering, take the time to
think things through completely. Doing so will save all of you a lot of
time and energy in the long run. (Flip to Chapter 12 for some tips on how
plan your activities strategically.)
 Share the workload. Many families have traditionally divided the labor
around the house into boy jobs and girl jobs — “You clean the gutters
and I clean the floors” or “You deal with the kids and I deal with the
lawn.” However you have divided things in the past, you may need to
begin thinking about tasks in a different way. You need to figure who can
do which tasks with the best outcome and the least effort — even if a
boy ends up doing a “girl task” and vice versa.
 Use mobility aids. Mobility aids can benefit the whole family. This is
sometimes a hard sell, but the point is that the right piece of equipment —
a cane or motorized scooter for example — can make it possible for family
members to enjoy activities and each other’s company. When mom uses
a motorized scooter to go to the zoo, for example, the entire family can
participate, everyone can move at a comfortable pace, and no one has
to worry about her falling or getting exhausted.
229
Chapter 15: Making MS a Part of the Family

Establishing family priorities
One of the things we hear a lot from families is “MS really helped us get our
priorities straight.” For these families, the MS made them stop and think
about what things in life were most important to them, and what they needed
to do to make those things happen. Obviously, the priorities are going to be
different for each family, but the process is the same.
For example, one family may decide that quality family time is a top priority.
Given that dad has a lot of MS fatigue, they need to figure out how to take
that into account when planning shared activities. Maybe they decide that
dinner will be 30 minutes later every day to give dad a chance for a power
nap when he gets home from work. Or, maybe they decide that the kids can
take over mowing the lawn so dad can use that time to rest up for the after-
noon soccer game (and dad agrees to take his scooter to the field so he 
doesn’t get too tired to cheer the team).
The examples are endless, but the point is that the family needs to identify a
priority and then figure out how to make it happen. Other priorities may
include making family trips accessible (see Chapter 23), increasing monthly
savings, or having more company at the house so mom can stay connected
with all her friends. The goal is to ensure that everyone’s needs are balanced.
Problem-solving: Many heads 
are better than one
Living with MS takes creativity and flexibility. Each new challenge that comes
along demands a response; otherwise MS threatens to run the show. Your
best strategy for meeting MS challenges head-on is for you and your family to
put your heads together to come up with a plan. This strategy provides more
brain power to deal with the problem, and it also helps make sure that every-
one buys into the solution.
If, for example, mom is having problems with balance, she and her family can
think about ways to deal with it — perhaps by rearranging the furniture to
make the house more convenient for her, helping her pick out a snazzy new
scooter, or considering a move to a one-story house. Or, if the co-pay on her
medications has increased, the family can work together to figure out where
those extra dollars are going to come from each month. One of the advan-
tages of this kind of shared approach to problem-solving is that everyone
feels some ownership of the process.

Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

Building and Maintaining Healthy
Partner Relationships
MS can challenge even the best of partnerships. There isn’t a young couple in
the world — unless they grew up in families in which someone had a chronic
illness or disability — that has a clue what “in sickness and in health” really
means. The challenge is no doubt easier for those of you who already have a
history together. You’ve had an opportunity to get to know another, build a part-
nership of whatever sort works best for you, and get comfortable with your indi-
vidual tastes, strengths, and foibles. The same strengths and resources you
have brought to bear in other difficult situations will help you with MS as well.
Those of you who are younger may have a tougher time simply because you
may not know each other as well and may have less of a foundation together.
Basically, you’re getting to know each other at the same time as you’re get-
ting to know MS. Fortunately, no one needs to go it alone. Many resources
and strategies are available to help couples manage the stresses and strains
that a chronic illness like MS can cause.
Making time for each other
As everyone knows, family life is busy under even the best of circumstances.
Jobs, kids, and chores can be so time- and energy-consuming that many cou-
ples describe themselves as “ships passing in the night.” And even the passing-
in-the-night part isn’t all that much fun because both members of the couple
are so tired. We advocate quality time together for any couple, but it’s particu-
larly important after MS joins the family. Relationships need time and space to
grow and thrive — it may sound hokey but it’s true. For instance, the communi-
cation and shared problem-solving we talk about in this chapter can’t happen
unless you make time for them — and you won’t make time unless you decide
that communicating and joint problem-solving are high on the priority list.
We’re big fans of “date night.” Many couples find that if they don’t actually
schedule this kind of time together, it never seems to happen. Not every date
needs to involve soul-searching discussions (although these are important
every now and then). The important thing is that you’re taking time to spend
together, without all the distractions that grab your attention at home.
Because fatigue can be such a major issue in MS, it’s important to plan your
time together when fatigue is at a minimum. Some couples grab a few min-
utes early in the morning, when energy is generally highest, to enjoy a chat or
a cuddle before the family’s day begins. Evening dates may be a problem
231
Chapter 15: Making MS a Part of the Family

because of the fatigue factor, so some couples stake out one weekend after-
noon a month for themselves. It doesn’t matter how you make it happen, it
only matters that you do.
Keeping the intimacy alive
When the word “intimacy” is used these days, everyone tends to assume it’s
all about sex. But, there’s definitely more to it than that. In fact, we purposely
talk about sexual issues in another chapter to convey that intimacy is much
more than just your sexual relationship (you can high-tail it to Chapter 8 right
now if you’re looking for the juicy stuff.). Intimacy involves all of the things
that keep your partnership healthy and satisfying, including:
 Communication: The couples who communicate most successfully are
those who can listen as well as talk, and who can recognize their points
of agreement while acknowledging their differences. Too often couples
clam up when they don’t see eye to eye or when things start to get tense.
Because MS is likely to throw a lot of new challenges your way, it’s
important to be able to talk about your issues and priorities — even if
the conversations get a bit dicey at times.
 Trust: Partners need to be able trust that it’s safe to express themselves
without fear of rejection or ridicule. In other words, they need to know
that the relationship is a safe place for revealing their feelings, needs,
and concerns. They also need to feel confidence in the resilience of the
relationship. If every bump in the road is a possible reason for one of
you to jump ship, neither of you will ever feel safe, let alone intimate.
 Mutual concern: Every intimate partnership is a two-way street. Even
when one partner has been diagnosed with a chronic illness, the other
partner’s well-being should be of equal concern. Try to make sure that
both of you are getting equal billing.
 Respect: Intimacy can’t happen without mutual respect. Particularly if
roles and responsibilities change as a result of MS, it’s important that
the person with MS continues to feel like a respected partner.
 Sex: The sexual relationship is an important way for couples to express
and experience their intimacy. Because MS can sometimes alter sexual
feelings and responses (and therefore interfere with sexual activities),
it’s critically important that couples get whatever help they need to deal
with any changes that occur.
Unfortunately, MS seems to have its own don’t ask, don’t tell policy —
doctors don’t often ask and patients don’t often tell — so sexual difficul-
ties don’t get proper attention. Don’t let your doctor off the hook. If
you’re experiencing changes in your sexual relationship, speak up. Your
doctor can help you figure out what is and isn’t related to MS and can
refer you to a counselor or sex therapist for help.
232
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

Maintaining a balanced partnership
Over time, every partnership develops its own set of ground rules. These
ground rules are often unplanned and unspoken, but they’re real just the
same. According to these rules, each partner has areas of responsibility, such
as breadwinner, chief cook and bottle washer, primary parent, gardener, gro-
cery shopper, bill payer, and so on. The division of labor, however it evolves,
ensures that the work gets done and that each person feels cared for. Some-
times something will come along to disrupt the pattern temporarily, but it
generally rights itself pretty quickly. For example, families go through this
when someone gets a cold or the flu. For a few days, everyone chips in to
help the family member who’s not feeling well. Then, as soon as the person
feels better, everyone goes back to the usual routine.
When MS comes along, partnerships can get thrown out of whack. If one part-
ner begins having difficulty managing his or her end of things, the ground
rules gradually start to shift. The shift may last for weeks or months — until
the current exacerbation is over — or forever. Here’s the risk in this situation:
The partner whose disability is getting in the way gradually begins relinquish-
ing responsibilities. The other partner steps in to pick up the slack and pretty
soon, the person with MS isn’t contributing his or her share. And nobody
feels good about it. The person with MS feels guilty and his or her partner
begins to feel tired, overburdened, and perhaps resentful.
From the get-go, it’s a good idea to assume that partnerships thrive best
when they’re balanced. For example, if the partner with MS begins to have
difficulty with an activity, keep the partnership balanced by doing a swap of
chores. It doesn’t matter what the swap is as long as both of you still feel
valued. Unfortunately, one of the biggest obstacles to this kind of swap tends
to be people’s sensitivity about gender roles. In these situations, you may
hear things like “But she’s supposed to do the cooking, the housework, and
the carpooling.” or “He always cut the grass, shoveled the snow, repaired
stuff, and paid the bills.” Our advice? Get over it! The strength of your part-
nership will depend on your ability to be flexible when and if you need to be
(not on whether you’re doing the “right” chores).
What to do when one partner can’t 
participate in joint activities
Imagine what happens when a couple that has always played tennis or golf
together, or hiked or skied together, suddenly finds that these joint activities
aren’t possible any more because of MS. As you can probably guess, this
change can be particularly challenging for those couples whose social lives
have been built around these activities. Generally, the scenario plays out in
one of the following ways: Both partners stop the activity (and one feels sad
233
Chapter 15: Making MS a Part of the Family

and guilty while the other feels sad and resentful) or one partner stops the
activity (and one feels sad and angry and the other feels guilty). We don’t
think either of these options is a particularly good way to go. So, here are
some alternative strategies:
 Don’t assume that you know what your partner is feeling about this.
Get the subject out in the open and figure out what’s going to work best
for your relationship.
 Brainstorm about options that may work for both of you. For example,
here are some suggestions:
• Substitute another activity that you both enjoy as much as the one
that you’re now unable to do.
• One partner continues the activity while the other comes along to
enjoy the social part.
• One partner continues the activity while the other finds an enjoy-
able alternative.
• One partner engages in the activity on a less frequent basis and
you do something together the rest of the time.
 Whatever option you choose, make sure that your together-time 
doesn’t get lost. Sharing time feeds and fuels your relationship, so do
what you need to do to preserve some opportunities to enjoy time
together (see the section “Making time for each other” earlier in the
chapter for more details).
 Maintain your social connections. If, for example, your social life has
revolved around the tennis club, you need to figure out how to maintain
connections with friends even if you aren’t playing as much tennis as
you used to. This can be a real challenge, particularly if your “friends”
turn out to be more interested in your tennis game than you. Obviously
people like that aren’t really your “friends,” so you’ll have to look around
for ways to broaden your horizons with other people, such as friends
from work, friends from your church or synagogue, or friends from
neighborhood organizations.
Turning a caregiving relationship 
into a care partnership
Maintaining a healthy partnership can become especially difficult if MS pro-
gresses significantly (check out Chapter 13 for more on managing advanced
MS). The more disabled a person with MS becomes, the more involved the
partner is likely to be in his or her care. Caregiving activities can run the gamut
from occasional assistance with daily activities like taking medications, but-
toning buttons, and preparing meals to full-time, hands-on care with dressing,
bathing, using the bathroom, and eating.
234
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

When one person is always on the caregiving end and the other is always on
the care-receiving end, the relationship is no longer balanced. The give-and-
take foundation for the partnership has been lost. But, it really doesn’t need
to be. Except in the case of severe cognitive impairment, which fortunately is
relatively rare in MS (you can read more about this in Chapter 9), every
person can contribute significantly to a partnership, even if he or she has to
do it differently.
Here are some tips for creating a care partnership:
 Make sure that each of you feels like a contributing member of the
partnership. Figure out together what the person with MS can do to sup-
port the activities of the household. Be creative and remember that assis-
tive technology can make many things possible (see Chapter 7 for details).
 Ensure that both of you are being givers and receivers. Healthy part-
ners need to let their MS partners know what they need; even if the part-
ner with MS can’t do much in the way of physical activities, he or she
can give a lot in the way caring, support, humor, advice, and so on.
 To the extent possible, keep caregiving activities separate from your
couple time. For example, hire outside caregiving help if you need it and
can afford it. Make dates for together-time that doesn’t involve caregiv-
ing activities. Or, come up with some activities that you can share and
enjoy, such as watching movies, reading aloud, and going out to dinner.
When Your Child Has MS
As challenging as it can sometimes be to have MS, parents say that it’s even
more difficult when your child has it. No one ever wants anything bad to
happen to their kids. When a child is diagnosed with MS — either as a young-
ster or as an adult — parents tend to feel overwhelmed with a lot of feelings,
including anxiety, guilt, and anger. In this section, we talk about the issues
confronting parents when their child has MS.
Helping your adult child with MS
Because MS is primarily a disease of young adults, a lot of middle-aged or
elderly parents are left wondering what to do to help their kids who have
been diagnosed. Clearly, the old “keep ’em home from school and give ’em
lots of fluids until the fever goes away” doesn’t really work. Yet the same feel-
ings that made you want to care for and protect your kids from harm when
they were little are still there even though your kid is now 30, 40, or even 50.
The result is that you may tend to fall back on old parenting techniques that
235
Chapter 15: Making MS a Part of the Family

don’t apply any more. Here are some tips on how you can still parent when
your child is a full-fledged adult:
 Have a heart-to-heart with your adult child, with the goal being to figure
out how you’re going to support each other in this situation. Parent-
child relationships are a form of care partnership, so you and your child
need to figure out what each of you can do to take care of the other.
For example, your child needs to recognize that you’re concerned and
feel just as protective and parental as you always did. You, in turn, have
to recognize that your child is now a grown-up who needs to deal with
this life change in his or her own way.
 Negotiate what you can expect from one another. Your adult child may
just want emotional support, or he or she may welcome advice, financial
assistance, hands-on help, or a hundred other things. So, you need to be
prepared to talk about what you can and can’t provide. On the other
hand, your child may want to sort things out alone for awhile. This is a
reasonable request, but as concerned parents, you also have every right
to request periodic updates.
 In the event that your adult child becomes too disabled to manage on
his or her own, discuss care options. As we emphasize in Chapter 20,
discussions about long-term care and related topics are most effective
when they happen along the way. Even though most people don’t ever
require this level of care, discussing the options ahead of time gives
family members the opportunity to sort our their feelings and needs so
that difficult choices don’t have to be made during a crisis. (You can find
more info on the care options in Chapter 13.)
One option may be for your child to come back and live with you, but
it’s important to talk about all the options in order to make sure that
everyone’s needs are being met. If the solution doesn’t work for you and
your adult child, then it’s not working.
 If your child moves back into your home for health or financial rea-
sons, renegotiate the parent-child “contract.” Otherwise, each of you
will fall back on whatever rules were in place the last time you lived
together (which was probably in your child’s teenage years). Any child
who has lived independently will want to continue to have a certain
amount of privacy and freedom to come and go. You, on the other hand,
may begin to worry about your child’s welfare and safety just as you did
in the old days — particularly if he or she now has mobility, visual, or
cognitive problems that may affect driving or other activities.
An honest conversation will go a long way toward helping you sort out a
plan that works for everyone. In general, we recommend that you and
your child maintain as much independence as possible, while keeping
each other informed of schedules and whereabouts and coming together
when you want to spend time together as a family.
236
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

 Because this is a care partnership, everyone needs to be on both the
giving and receiving end. If your adult child finds it necessary to return
to your home, he or she may feel guilty about imposing in this way, and
may be concerned about not being able to provide you with the assis-
tance that you may need as you get older. But, there are many ways for
all of you to take care of each other. Work it out so that everyone is a
contributor to the household.
 If the situation gets too tense or emotional as you try to figure out a
plan that works for all of you, consider talking with a family coun-
selor. This isn’t an easy change for anyone, and an objective third party
can often help the conversation along.
Young children and teens get MS too
This section is for those of you who have a young child or teen with MS. We
want you to know up front that you aren’t alone and that a lot of resources
are available to help you and your child. So, before you do anything else, you
may want to check out “Young Persons with MS: A Network for Families with
a Child or Teen with MS,” which is a support program developed collabora-
tively by the National MS Society and the MS Society of Canada.
You can get more information about the Network by calling (866) KIDS-W-MS
(866-543-7967) or by going online (www.nationalmssociety.org/
pednetwork).
Understanding childhood MS
Of the 400,000 people in the United States with MS, approximately 8,000 to
10,000 of them are children or adolescents. Initial symptoms have been seen
as early as 13 months old, with a diagnosis as young as 2 years old. The
majority, however, are diagnosed in their teens. An additional 10,000 to 15,000
youngsters have experienced at least one symptom suggestive of MS. Some —
but certainly not all — of these will go on to develop MS. Although, in most
cases they won’t actually be diagnosed until they’re adults.
The advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology, combined with 
a growing awareness of pediatric MS among adult and pediatric neurologists
and pediatricians, has made it possible to identify children with MS earlier
than ever before. Even though the information about these kids is accumulat-
ing gradually, we want to fill you in on what’s known so far:
 As is true with adults, no one knows why one child gets MS and another
doesn’t. In general, it’s thought that a person with a certain genetic pre-
disposition comes into contact with some kind of environmental trigger
prior to adolescence that causes the disease to occur (you can read
237
Chapter 15: Making MS a Part of the Family

more about the genetic factor in Chapter 1). Doctors still don’t know
what the trigger is or what causes the disease to become active so early
in some children. However, we guarantee you that neither you nor your
child did anything to make it happen.
 You can’t predict how your child’s MS will progress. However doctors
do know that most people with MS remain able to walk, even though
they may need a cane or other assistive device to help them.
 Right now, the diagnostic criteria for MS in children are the same as
in adults. As more information is gathered about these kids, however,
the criteria may ultimately be revised somewhat for this younger group.
You can read more about the diagnostic criteria in adults in Chapter 2.
Here’s the challenge when it comes to diagnosing younger folks: When a
child or teen goes to the doctor with a single episode of neurologic symp-
toms that are characteristic of demyelination (damage to the myelin coat-
ing and nerve fibers in the central nervous system), the doctor needs to
decide if this is a one-time event in the child’s life, or the first event in what
will eventually turn out to be MS. To complicate matters, it isn’t unusual
for children to experience single neurologic events known as acute dis-
seminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Although some neurologic symp-
toms and signs of ADEM are similar to those of MS — such as vision
problems or difficulties with balance, sensation, or strength — others
are quite different.
 Like treatment in adults, the treatment of MS in children involves
managing acute attacks, modifying the disease course, and managing
the symptoms. Unfortunately, though, many of the medical treatments
described in this book have been studied extensively in adults but have
not been studied in children under 18. And although several medications
have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
use in adults with MS (see Chapter 6), none has been specifically approved
for use in pediatric MS. This means that your child’s physician has to
rely on his or her clinical judgment — and that of experts in the field —
when making decisions about what to prescribe.
 Cognitive symptoms are an important issue for any person with MS,
but they’re of particular concern in kids because of their potential
impact on school performance. Because cognitive changes (including
problems with attention, memory, information processing, and problem-
solving) can occur early in the disease — even as a first symptom — it’s
important to educate yourself about them so you can be on the lookout.
(See Chapter 9 for a description of the cognitive changes in adults.) If
you (or the teacher) notice any changes in your child’s performance,
consider a cognitive evaluation. The goal is to identify any changes early
on so that the school can provide whatever assistance your child needs
to learn comfortably and function at his or her best.

secondary schools. Contact the Network by calling (866) KIDS-W-MS.

Parenting when your child has MS
Parenting is difficult enough without throwing MS into the mix. So, we
included this section to give you some tips to handle it all. The following sug-
gestions should address some of your most immediate concerns:
 Talk openly with your child about his or her diagnosis. It’s far better to
give your child accurate information about what’s going on than to let
his or her imagination fill in the blanks. The information you give also
provides the vocabulary he or she needs to ask questions. Open and
honest communication with kids also promotes feelings of safety and
trust. In other words, when you feel comfortable talking about the diffi-
cult stuff, your child will feel confident that he or she is in good hands.
 Be prepared for the reaction. How a child reacts to an MS diagnosis 
will depend a lot on his or her age. In general, however, it’s important to
remember that most kids tend to take their cues from their parents. If
you’re anxious or upset, for instance, your child will be too. So, the truth
(provided at an age-appropriate level) is important, but so is reassur-
ance that he or she will be okay.
 Involve your child in the treatment planning process from the get-go.
The treatment of MS is ongoing, so when kids are included in the deci-
sions, they feel safer, more knowledgeable about what’s happening, and
more in control. Because all of the current treatments involve injections,
it’s important for youngsters to feel like part of the treatment team when
decisions are made. For example, because the symptoms of MS tend to
relapse, particularly in the early years, your child will be getting injec-
tions even when he or she is feeling absolutely fine. Without plenty of
discussion, a child may not understand why he or she must continually
be poked and prodded. After all, who ever heard of getting a shot when
you’re feeling fine?
 Help your child deal with his or her doctors. Kids with MS are going to
have ongoing relationships with a variety of health professionals. They’ll
undergo a lot of medical tests, neurologic examinations, and evaluations
of various kinds. You can help your child feel more comfortable and less
afraid in the doctor’s office if you stay calm yourself. We also suggest
trying to find out ahead of time what’s likely to happen during the visit
so you can give your kid a heads-up. Also, consider helping your young-
ster engage in age-appropriate conversations with the doctors, nurses,
and other specialists — the more comfortable your child can become
with each member of the treatment team, the safer and more relaxed he
or she will feel in the long run.
Teenagers may gradually feel the need to handle some of the doctor visits
on their own. If your child has been able to develop a trusting relation-
ship with the doctor, he or she may prefer to be examined and talk to
the doctor without you there. Even though this may be incredibly diffi-
cult for you, it’s important to respect your teenager’s need for privacy.
We suggest a three-way agreement among you, your teen, and the doctor
239
Chapter 15: Making MS a Part of the Family

that acknowledges your child’s wish for privacy and independence. But,
make it clear that important medical decisions will be made by all of you
together.
 Don’t be overprotective. Because MS is so unpredictable, your child may
feel really crummy one day and perfectly fine other days. Even though
your first instinct may be to try and protect him or her from overexer-
tion in an effort to keep the MS from doing its thing, your best bet is to
let your kid be a kid whenever he or she feels up to it. Children’s bodies
will generally give them pretty good clues about what they can and can’t
do. If you have concerns about this, a three-way conversation with the
doctor can help you and your child sort this out.

Introducing the first network of regional pediatric
MS Centers of Excellence
In 2005, the National MS Society awarded $13.5
million for six regional Centers of Excellence to
treat and study childhood MS. These centers
offer optimal medical and psychosocial support
to children under 18 and their families (with
funds available to families in need of trans-
portation, lodging, and medical care). The cen-
ters are located in geographically diverse areas
in order to serve as many children and families
living with MS as possible. They’re staffed by
teams of pediatric and adult MS experts who
lead the field in MS diagnosis and treatment.
The centers include the following:
 Center for Pediatric-Onset Demyelinating
Disease at the Children’s Hospital of Alabama
(in connection with the University of Alabama
at Birmingham)
 Pediatric MS Center at Jacobs Neurological
Institute (in connection with State University
of New York at Buffalo)
 Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota

around Your MS
In This Chapter

 Knowing what issues to consider when it comes to parenthood
 Making your family-planning decisions easier with some strategies
M
any people are in their 20s and 30s when they’re diagnosed with multi-
ple sclerosis (MS) — which is smack in the middle of the time when
most folks are building their careers and starting their families. So, “Can I
have children?” or “Will having a baby make my MS worse?” are among the
first questions young women are likely to ask their doctors upon diagnosis.
Similarly, men want to know if MS is going to affect their ability to father a
child. And, both women and men worry whether MS will affect their ability to
be good parents and whether their children are going to develop MS.
To help you make the best family-planning decisions for you and your family,
in this chapter we answer all of your questions. We show you the impact of
MS on fertility, pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding, and then we show
you the impact of pregnancy and childbirth on MS. We also discuss your
medication options in the weeks preceding, during, and following pregnancy,
and we provide suggestions on how best to think through your family-plan-
ning decisions, given how unpredictable MS can be.
MS and Babies: Here’s the Good News!
The good news for couples is that women and men with MS can be effective,
involved parents of healthy, happy children (check out Chapter 17 for info
about the pleasures and pitfalls of parenting). Even though the message prior

to about 1950 was that women with MS shouldn’t even consider having kids,
the research since then has confirmed repeatedly that MS and motherhood
can go together just fine. Men with MS haven’t received as much attention in
this area, but no research suggests that MS interferes with a man’s ability to
father a healthy child or to be a good parent. To give you some solid reassur-
ance, we include the following sections, which show you exactly what doc-
tors today know about the connection between having babies and having MS.
Fertility isn’t affected by MS
We’re sure that you’re thrilled to know that MS doesn’t affect the production
of eggs or sperm (or their ability to form healthy embryos). But, unless
you’re ready to hear the pitter-patter of little feet, the fact that your fertility
factories are functioning means that you and your partner need to make the
same decisions about birth control as everyone else. And, it’s also important
to know that some of the medications used to treat MS or its symptoms —
including corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, and antibiotics — can reduce the
effectiveness of oral contraceptives. So, couples are advised to use additional
protection if the woman is taking any of these medications.
Even though sperm production isn’t affected by MS, problems with erectile
function or ejaculation can interfere with conception. So, guys who are expe-
riencing difficulty getting or maintaining an erection, or ejaculating, may want
to consult a urologist about treatment for the problem. (Check out Chapter 8
for more information about changes in sexual function.)
Pregnancy hormones reduce 
disease activity
To understand how pregnancy hormones reduce MS activity, first consider
what these hormones actually do: They suppress a woman’s immune system
so that her body doesn’t reject the developing fetus as a foreigner. This, in
turn, helps out your MS because as the hormone levels rise over the nine
months of pregnancy, your likelihood of having a relapse (exacerbation)
decreases — particularly during your third trimester when the hormone
levels are highest. Lots of women with MS say they feel so good when they’re
pregnant that they wish they could stay pregnant forever.
As the pregnancy hormones return to normal levels during the three to six
months following delivery (or the termination of the pregnancy by sponta-
neous or elective abortion), a woman’s risk of relapse rises significantly
before it levels off to her pre-pregnancy rate. So, as a group, women have
about a 10 percent risk of having a relapse while pregnant, and a 29 percent
242
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

risk of a relapse soon after the pregnancy ends. However, the best way to pre-
dict your own risk of having a relapse following delivery is to look at your
rate of relapses during the year before you got pregnant. The more active
your MS was prior to your pregnancy, the more likely you are to experience a
relapse in the months after your baby is born. See the “Minding your medica-
tions” section later for tips on how you may be able to reduce your risk of
relapse after pregnancy.
Pregnancies don’t increase a woman’s
long-term disability level
Women with MS who have had one or more pregnancies don’t become any
more disabled over the long run than women with MS who have no pregnan-
cies. In fact, some research even suggests that women with MS who have
been pregnant fare slightly better than women who have not, although the
reasons for this aren’t clear. This means that even though your risk of having
a relapse increases immediately following pregnancy, the risk is a short-term
one, without any implications for your eventual disability level.
Childbirth isn’t a piece of cake for anyone
but women with MS do just fine
Despite popular belief, moms with MS deliver their babies just like other
women do (you know, with lots of yelling, grunting, and gnashing of teeth).
And just like women without MS, you have anesthesia options to make child-
birth a little easier. If you want or need anesthesia, all types are considered
safe for you to use — the choice is up to you and your physician.
A recent, large-scale study of all pregnancies in Norway suggests that the
number of forceps deliveries and deliveries by Caesarian section is some-
what higher in women with MS than in the general population. The most
likely explanation is that women with MS may become more fatigued during
labor than other women. Or, they may have other symptoms such as sensory
changes that make it difficult to feel the contractions, or spasticity (stiffness)
or weakness that may make pushing more difficult. If you’re having significant
problems with fatigue, weakness, or spasticity, be sure to discuss them with
your obstetrician before you head to the hospital to deliver.
Even though evidence shows that moms with MS do well during pregnancy
and delivery, some obstetricians and anesthesiologists in various parts of the
country may be reluctant to take you on as a patient because they mistakenly
consider pregnancy and delivery in a woman with MS to be “high risk.” So, be
243
Chapter 16: Planning a Family around Your MS

sure to discuss your pregnancy and delivery with your obstetrician from the
get-go, and make an appointment to meet with the anesthesiologist ahead of
time. These conversations can help ensure that your big day is as comfortable
and stress-free as it can possibly be. (Check out www.nationalmssociety.
org/pregnancyinfo for information about pregnancy and delivery that you
can share with your doctors.)
Parents with MS have healthy babies
As we’ve mentioned before, doctors used to think that pregnancy and MS
didn’t go together. They believed that pregnancy and delivery could make a
mom’s MS worse or that she could miscarry or have an unhealthy child.
However, recent research has shown that women with MS can have healthy,
full-term babies with no increased risk of miscarriages or fetal abnormalities.
Children who have a parent with MS do have a somewhat higher risk of devel-
oping MS than children in the general population, but the risk remains rela-
tively low at approximately 3 to 5 percent. (Take a look at Chapter 1 for more
information about the genetics of MS.) Unfortunately, no test or genetic study
currently exists that can determine your child’s risk of developing MS.
Breastfeeding is definitely an option
Women with MS who wish to breastfeed are definitely encouraged to do so —
it won’t increase your risk of an MS relapse and it’s great for the baby. The only
reason your doctor may discourage nursing is if he or she feels it’s important
for you to restart your disease-modifying medication right away to reduce
your risk of relapses (see the section “Considering Key Issues when Making
Family-Planning Decisions” later in the chapter for more on your medication
options). Another consideration is that you may be very tired after your baby
is born (the combination of MS fatigue and new-mom fatigue can be a real
doozy), so you need to make sure that you have sufficient energy to nurse
and that you have adequate help around if you need it.
If you’re breastfeeding, your baby will nurse every two to four hours for the
first several weeks. These frequent feedings will help you build up your milk
supply, but they’re also pretty tiring. So ask the happy dad or another support
person to bring you the baby for the night feedings so you can conserve your
energy. After the supply is well-established, you can pump milk during the
day for nighttime bottle feedings, which dad or another helper can cheerfully
provide at 2 a.m. Or, if necessary, you can use formula for those feedings.
244
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

Considering Key Issues when Making
Family-Planning Decisions
Starting a family or adding to it is a big decision for any couple, and there are
even more issues to consider when one of the parents has MS. All prospec-
tive moms and dads face some uncertainties in their future, but those with
MS face even more because of the unpredictability of the disease.
Minding your medications
The goal during pregnancy is always to be taking as few medications as possi-
ble in order to avoid problems for your growing baby. Before trying to become
pregnant, be sure to discuss all the medications you’re taking (prescription
and over-the-counter) with your physician so that changes or substitutions
can be made prior to conception if needed.
The disease-modifying medications and pregnancy planning
We emphasize in Chapter 6 that early and ongoing treatment with one of the
disease-modifying therapies — the interferon medications, Copaxone (glati-
ramer acetate), or Tysabri (natalizumab) — is important to controlling your
disease. But, here’s the hitch: None of these medications are approved for
use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
For safety reasons, the effects of the disease-modifying medications can’t
actually be studied during pregnancy, but the data collected from women
who accidentally became pregnant while on an interferon medication suggest
that the meds may cause a slight increase in the risk of miscarriage or fetal
malformation. The data from Copaxone users so far show no increased risks
but most neurologists and obstetricians still recommend that women stop
the medication prior to becoming pregnant. At this time, there are no preg-
nancy data for Tysabri, but it isn’t considered safe for use by pregnant women.
Until more information becomes available, we strongly recommend that you
stop your disease-modifying therapy at least one month prior to trying to
conceive (after consulting with your doctor, of course). And you should con-
sult with your doctor right away if you become pregnant unexpectedly while
on medication. If you haven’t yet started a disease-modifying medication and
are considering becoming pregnant within the coming year, you may want to
wait until your baby is born to begin treatment in order to avoid having to
start and stop.
245
Chapter 16: Planning a Family around Your MS

But, you don’t need to panic about being without your meds because preg-
nancy hormones actually provide some protection against MS disease activ-
ity (see the section “Pregnancy hormones reduce disease activity” earlier in
the chapter for details). In fact, pregnancy hormones essentially reduce
relapses by about the same amount as the disease-modifying therapies.
Unfortunately, none of the pharmaceutical companies have paid any atten-
tion to medication issues for men. No data have been collected regarding babies
who were conceived while a father was taking one of the disease-modifying
medications. Most physicians aren’t concerned about the impact of the father’s
medications on the baby — but, if you prospective fathers want to be super-
careful, you can talk to your physician about interrupting your medication
schedule while you and your partner are trying to conceive.
Your options during and after pregnancy
It’s great that pregnancy hormones provide some protection against MS dis-
ease activity during pregnancy, but what do you do while you’re trying to get
pregnant or if you choose to breastfeed? During these months you’re obvi-
ously not receiving any protection against disease activity, so as you make
your family-planning decisions, you need to be thinking about how long you
want to be off your medication.
For example, if your MS has been particularly active in the year prior to your
pregnancy and it remains active during your pregnancy, you may want to
consider getting back on medication as soon as you deliver, which means
that you’ll have to bottle feed your baby rather than nurse. Some neurolo-
gists are also prescribing intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) right after deliv-
ery to reduce the risk of relapses. However, if your MS has been pretty stable,
you can probably postpone medication until you decide to stop nursing.
The effects of immunosuppressants on fertility
The immunosuppressant medications used to treat some progressive forms
of MS can affect egg and sperm production and can harm a developing fetus
(flip to Chapter 6 for more details on the immunosuppressant meds). So, you
women out there should take a pregnancy test prior to starting any of these
medications (and prior to subsequent doses of those medications that are
taken every several months). Also, because of the potential of these drugs to
cause sterility, men should consider banking sperm and women should con-
sider harvesting their eggs for future use.
Remembering that babies don’t 
stay babies very long
When women talk to us about their baby-making plans, they wonder how they’ll
feel after the baby is born or whether they’ll be able to take care of the baby
246
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

properly. These are all great questions, but it’s also important to remember
that babies grow up pretty fast. In other words, you need to consider how
you and your partner will manage your growing child. So, as you talk through
your feelings and thoughts about baby-making, try to imagine your new baby
turning into an active toddler and your active toddler turning into a busy pre-
teen and then — gulp — a teen. (Check out Chapter 17 for info on parenting
with MS.)
Facing the uncertainties: The future 
doesn’t come with guarantees
Everyone is faced with lots of uncertainties in life. However the unpre-
dictability of MS — from day to day and over the long haul — makes big life
decisions (like whether to start a family) even more complicated. Your best
bet is to try and think through — individually and as a couple — what you
would do if things got tough. Figure out how you would cope, what strategies
you would use, and what resources you have available to you. Thinking
through the future possibilities — rosy and not so rosy — helps you make
more informed decisions. And whatever you decide, you’ll know that your
choices have taken into account the complexities of living with MS. (Refer to
Part V for more details on planning for a future with MS.)
When you’re making your family-planning decisions, keep in mind that all the
good news we give you in this chapter (see the section “MS and Babies:
Here’s the Good News!” earlier in this chapter) is based on group statistics.
The odds are in your favor — but they aren’t guaranteed. In other words, if
you’re one of the women who has a severe, disabling relapse following deliv-
ery, it won’t matter to you that the vast majority of women do fine.
Strategies for Smart Decision-Making
Family-planning decisions are never easy, especially when MS is present. So,
in this section we provide you with some strategies that will help you as
you’re trying to decide whether you should have a baby.
Consult your MS doctor
No doctor has a crystal ball, but the level of disease activity you have experi-
enced so far and the kinds of symptoms you have may give your neurologist
some idea of how your MS is likely to behave over the long haul. Of course,
you certainly have no guarantees, but talking about what may happen with
your MS can highlight the important issues for you to consider.
247
Chapter 16: Planning a Family around Your MS

For example, your doctor may suggest that you give yourself a year or two to
stabilize on your disease-modifying medication before stopping it to become
pregnant. Or, he or she may encourage you to begin your family sooner
rather than later because you’re doing well right now and the future is less
certain.
Evaluate your financial situation
Even though financial considerations are important for any couple that’s
making family-planning decisions, the potential impact of MS on employment
makes this a particularly important topic to discuss with your partner. You can
implement strategies to keep your place in the workforce (see Chapter 18),
but the bottom line is that you may not be able to work as long you had antic-
ipated. The fact that you may not work as long as you would have hoped is
important for a couple of reasons:
 Your family income may not be as great as you would like it to be down
the road, particularly given the fact that two-income families are pretty
much the norm these days.
 The partner without MS may need to take on a bigger share of the wage-
earning responsibilities. For example, a mom who planned to stay home
with school-age kids may find that she needs to work full-time because
her partner with MS can’t.
Money worries are no fun, so make sure that you and your partner sit down
and discuss your financial situation. If you need some expert advice, call the
National MS Society at (800) FIGHT-MS (800-344-4867) for a free consultation
through its Financial Education Partners program.
Take a good look at your teamwork
Parenting under the best of circumstances takes a lot of flexibility, patience,
creativity, and endurance. With MS in the picture, it can require even more.
So, given how unpredictable MS can be, one of the most important things to
consider in your family-planning discussion is your teamwork.
For instance, ask yourself the following questions: Can you roll with the
punches? How rigid are your roles and responsibilities in the household? Can
you picture yourself as a stay-at-home dad or a working mom? How’s your
sense of humor? Can you talk about tough stuff when you need to? The answers
to questions like these give you a sense of how well-oiled your teamwork is —
and better teamwork sure makes for easier parenting.
248
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

Check out your support network
Some couples live surrounded by family, friends, and neighbors while others
are pretty much out there on their own. There’s no reason to run and join a
commune, but it’s worthwhile to think about the resources that you have
available in the event that you need some assistance now and then. For exam-
ple, you can find support people in all sorts of places: in your family, in your
community, at work, at your church or synagogue, and through your local
National MS Society chapter.
Have a heart-to-heart with your partner
Decisions about if and when to have kids can be pretty emotional. People
generally have strong feelings about this issue one way or another. And to
top it all off, communicating about heavy stuff can sometimes be difficult.
You don’t want to upset your partner or give someone you love more to
worry about than he or she is already dealing with. But, the fact is, holding
back feelings or concerns — particularly about hot topics like family-planning
decisions, family finances, and relationship issues — can come back to bite
you later on (see Chapter 15 for more about family communication issues).
If you’re scared to death about the future, about your partner’s ability to take
care of kids now that he or she has MS, or about your own ability to pick up
the slack if you have to, now’s the time to get those feelings out in the open.
Chances are, you both have some worries, and now’s the time to share them.
The notion that “two heads are better than one” has some merit because
together you can think through the stuff that’s worrying you and figure out
how you can deal with it.
If you need help having this kind of discussion, your healthcare provider or
the National MS society (800-FIGHT-MS) can refer you to a counselor who can
help mediate.
Talk to other parents living with MS
No matter what your concerns are, sometimes it’s reassuring to talk to others
who are in your same boat. For example, you can read everything there is to
know about parenting (and Chapter 17 would be a great start), but there’s
nothing better than a real-life chat. Picking the brains of moms and dads with
MS who live the day-to-day joys and challenges of parenthood is by far your
best way to get information about pregnancy, delivery, chasing energetic 
249
Chapter 16: Planning a Family around Your MS

toddlers, or anything else that’s on your mind. If you don’t know anyone in
your community who has MS, the National MS Society (800-FIGHT-MS) can
help you get in touch with other couples to talk to. Or you can check out the
Society’s chat room at www.nationalmssociety.org/chat.
Remember that your plans can change
Many people arrive at adulthood with some preconceived ideas and dreams
about parenthood. They know whether they want to have kids and they know
exactly how many they want. And sometimes they have a detailed vision of
what parenthood will be like. If, for any reason, you decide to change your
parenting plans — to not have kids, to have fewer than you originally planned,
or to adopt rather than having your own, it’s important to remember that this
change of heart can feel kind of like a loss. Even if you’re comfortable with
the decision, you’re confident that it’s the right one for you, and you’re happy
with the outcome, you may find that some grieving goes along with it. If you’re
feeling the need to grieve, go for it! Grieving is part of coping with a disease
that sometimes upsets the apple cart (see Chapter 3 for more on healthy
grieving).
Whatever you decide about having children, the choices are yours and only
yours — not your doctor’s, not your parents’, and not your friends’. You may
get a lot of opinions about what you should or shouldn’t do, but the only
right decision is the one that you and your partner make together.

Parenting: It Wasn’t Easy 
Before You Had MS!
In This Chapter
 Talking to your kids about MS
 Getting around MS symptoms that interfere with parenting activities
 Identifying key parenting strategies
A
s a parent or prospective parent with multiple sclerosis (MS), you’re
probably worried about what effect your illness or disability will have
on your children. You may wonder if you’ll be able to give them what they
need or whether they will have to take care of you. So, here are some things
we’ve learned from our own research and clinical experience and from others
who have studied this issue:
 Kids who have a parent with MS generally do well emotionally, socially,
and academically.
 Many children develop a strong sense of responsibility and take pride in
learning how to do things independently.
 Children learn a lot from watching a parent meet life’s challenges — and
it makes them proud.
 When children grow up with someone who has a disability, they tend to
develop a greater sensitivity to the needs of others.
 Living with family challenges can bring family members closer to one
another.
In other words, don’t assume that having a parent with MS has to be a
downer for your children. On the other hand, it’s important to acknowledge
your children’s feelings and worries about MS because sweeping them under
the carpet doesn’t really work in the long run. Your job as a parent is to find
the balance. And in the rest of this chapter, we help you do just that.

Keeping the Communication Lines Open
You may be wondering whether it’s a good idea to tell your kids about mom
or dad’s MS. You may worry that the information will scare them or give them
too much to worry about. You may be afraid that they will see you differently
or feel embarrassed. Or, you may simply not know how to begin. So, in this
section, we give you some pointers that may make your decision a little bit
easier. We explain why we think it’s so important for you to be up front with
your kids. We talk about how to respond to their major worries and how to
explain whatever symptoms you may be having.
Telling the kids about your 
MS makes good sense
As you may have already figured out, MS doesn’t just affect one person in the
family — it impacts everyone — so each family member needs to develop
some kind of relationship with the illness. And open discussion is the best
foundation we can think of for building comfortable relationships.
You know your children better than anyone else does. So, ultimately, you’re
the one who needs to decide what’s best for them and for the family. It’s our
experience, though, that there are some good reasons for introducing MS to
kids early on. The following sections explain a few.
Kids have a sixth sense about what’s going on anyway
Contrary to popular belief, kids of all ages are pretty quick to pick up on what’s
happening around them. If you’re tense, worried, or upset, chances are that
your children — no matter how young they are — are clued into it right away.
Even if they don’t quite know why you’re upset, they sense your mood and
interpret it as best they can. This means that without information from you,
their imaginations will take over, and the problems they imagine are likely to
be even more frightening than whatever the reality happens to be.
Big news items should come from you
Your kids need to hear about the important stuff directly from you for the fol-
lowing reasons:
 Someone else may not have the most accurate information or the best
way of presenting it to your kids.
 Children don’t like being the last to know about something important.
252
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

 When parents find it too difficult to talk about something, kids quickly
conclude that it must be something really terrible or shameful.
 Hearing the information from you helps them feel secure and confident
that you’re on top of things.
The longer you put off talking about your MS, the more likely it becomes that
your children will end up hearing about it from someone else — most likely a
well-meaning friend or relative who accidentally spills the beans.
Hearing the information from you is a green light for asking questions
When a big, gray elephant is hanging out in the living room and no one’s talk-
ing about it, it’s easy for children to conclude that the subject is off-limits.
But, when you talk about what’s going on, your kids get the message that it’s
okay to ask their questions and tell you what’s on their minds. And, you’ve
given them the vocabulary they need to put their questions into words.
Accurate information about the disease relieves kids’ guilt
Children have a tendency to see themselves as the center of the universe.
Younger kids, in particular, are likely to assume that anything going on around
them is somehow related to them. So, when you aren’t feeling well or you’re
upset or tense, they’re likely to assume that they’re the cause of the problem.
However, giving them accurate information about MS will reassure them that
they haven’t done anything to make you sick. Check out the sidebar “Tapping
resources for kids” for some age-appropriate materials that you can share
with your children.
Women are at increased risk for an MS relapse three to six months following
childbirth (see Chapter 16 for more details). This means that for quite a few
of you out there, your MS appeared right after the birth of a child. Kids can
easily misinterpret this kind of family folklore as a statement of blame, and
they can begin to feel guilty. A good discussion about the possible causes of
MS can help lay these feelings to rest.
In the same way, statements like “You’re really stressing me out; cut it out or
you’re going to make my MS worse” lay a heavy load on kids. So, try not to
use your MS as a behavior-controlling tool.
Your openness about MS provides a good model 
of family sharing and problem-solving
If you have MS, believe it or not, you may have a bit of a blessing in disguise —
you now have the opportunity to model for your kids how people help one
another deal with life’s challenges. Children who see that it’s okay to talk
openly within the family about problems that arise are much more likely to
come to you when they hit snags along the way.

Chapter 17: Parenting: It Wasn’t Easy Before You Had MS!

Sharing info with your children 
when secrecy is important
Sometimes your kids’ needs conflict with your own. For example, say that
you and your wife want to talk to the children about your MS, but you haven’t
told anyone at work yet because of concerns about job security (see Chapter
18 about MS and employment). You’re worried that after the kids know, the
information will gradually spread around the neighborhood and get to your
boss’s ears. What do you do?
This situation definitely has no easy answers. Ultimately, you need to make
your decision based on what you know about your kids and about your work
environment. Just remember that by the time they’re 6 or 7 years old, most
youngsters understand privacy and secrets pretty well. They can appreciate
the idea that some things only get talked about at home. Any child who has
had bed-wetting issues, for example, knows exactly how important it is to
keep some stuff private.

From the mouth of babes
Here’s what some kids have to say about having
a parent with MS:
Joshua (age 12): “My life has been changed for-
ever. My mom was diagnosed with MS in 2000.
We have been fighting this disease for about
five years. One morning my mom woke up and
had double vision. She didn’t know what was
wrong. She went to the doctor to have some
tests, and the tests showed that she had MS.
My mom now has to stay cool so we sold our
hot tub. She also switched from a full-time job
to a part-time job. She can’t do a lot of physical
activity, so we bought a bicycle she can ride
with one of us so she can still enjoy our family
bike rides. With these changes, our family is still
as strong as ever. MS has made our family
much closer than we were before. We are
thankful for everything — even MS.”
Sarah (age 14): “My mom has MS. I have three
brothers, so I’m the only girl. I always try to help
my mom, because with MS, she gets weak in all
sorts of places. Even though she’s weak and
hurts, she still does things for us. (It’s like she
has a million arms, because she loves us more
than anything!) She takes us to the movies, our
friend’s birthday parties, out to lunch. Even
though my mom has MS, she still is the best
mom in the world!”
Amy Jo (age 12): “My mom has multiple sclero-
sis. It all started one morning when her hands
were tingling. She just thought they were
asleep, but soon her whole body was numb.
When we got the news, we cried for hours. My
mom was afraid to tell us, but says she found
the strength because she was able to tell us two
of the most important things: We could not
catch this from her and she would not die from
MS. She explained to us that although she didn’t
know everything about the disease, we could
ask her anything, and if she didn’t know the
answer we would figure it out together. My
mom has a very positive attitude. We have all
learned a lot about the power of having a posi-
tive attitude.”

Finding ways to broach the big issues
After you decide to talk to your kids about MS, you may be wondering what
to say and how to say it. Here are a few basic things to keep in mind:
 Children have individual needs and learning styles. One wants all the
details and another just likes the big picture. One wants to talk and ask
questions while another wants to read a book or watch a video. Some
kids will ask a lot of questions and show a lot of interest while others
won’t appear to have the slightest bit of interest or curiosity. Because
one size definitely doesn’t fit all, you have to tailor your conversations
to each child’s needs — preferably one-on-one.
 One conversation won’t do it. Don’t expect to be able to gather all your
children in the living room, give a short explanation of MS, and be done
with it. Talking to kids about MS is a lot like talking to them about sex —
you start with the amount of information they need at the time, and grad-
ually expand on it as they get older and their needs (and your worries)
change.
 Regardless of how old they are — preschoolers or teens — all kids
share a few major worries. Here are a few of those worries:
• “Are you going to die?” When they ask this question, you can tell
younger children that “Once in a while, MS can make someone so
sick that they die, but most people live to be old. But, you don’t
need to worry about that because we will always take care of you.”
Tell older children “People sometimes die of complications of their
MS — like serious infection — but most people live very close to a
normal lifespan.”
• “Am I going to catch it?” Here’s what to tell younger children:
“You can’t catch MS like a cold or the chicken pox — it isn’t conta-
gious.” Tell your older children: “MS isn’t contagious, but some
people have genes that make them more likely to develop it than
other people. The risk, however, is low.”
• “Did I make you get sick?” Tell both younger and older children
the following: “No, you didn’t make me sick. There’s nothing that
you or anyone else did to make this happen.”
Your children may not come right out and ask these questions, but they
need the answers in whatever way you feel most comfortable giving them.
 Let your kids know what you’re doing to take care of yourself. Nothing
is more reassuring for your children than knowing that you have a good
doctor who’s working with you to treat your MS in the best possible way.
Also, don’t worry about keeping your treatments and medications a
secret. When you share info about your treatments, your kids feel more
confident that you’re in charge and that your illness is under control. In
fact, if you take an injectable medication to manage your MS, your kids
are will be very impressed with how brave you are.
255
Chapter 17: Parenting: It Wasn’t Easy Before You Had MS!

Depending on your children’s ages and level of interest (and your neurolo-
gist’s bedside manner) you may want to schedule a time for the kids to come
to the office with you so they can watch the neurologic exam and ask the doc
some questions.
At one time or another, you may need to go into the hospital for treatment —
perhaps during a relapse — or into an inpatient rehabilitation program.
Children may be frightened about your hospital stay, particularly if grandma
or some other friend or relative died during a hospital stay. Take the time to
explain exactly why you’re going to the hospital, what’s going to happen
while you’re there, and when you expect to be home. Daily phone conversa-
tions and visits, if possible, can help reduce kids’ worries.
Explaining those pesky invisible symptoms
Children have a difficult time understanding symptoms they can’t see. For
instance, they can see that you trip or lose your balance and need a cane or
scooter to help you walk. And they can see (and probably think that it’s
funny) that you drop things a lot. But kids have a much harder time getting a
handle on fatigue, cognitive, mood, or vision problems, or other symptoms
that aren’t as visible to them. For example:
 Children know that when they’re tired, they can go to bed or take a nap
and feel much better when they wake up. But, it’s difficult for them to
understand that sometimes you feel just as tired when you wake up as
you did when you went to sleep. Older kids, in particular, may think that
you aren’t interested in doing stuff, or that you aren’t trying very hard
(this is a situation when open communication is particularly helpful).
 Children know that many people wear glasses. So, they may find it diffi-
cult to understand why your vision problems can’t be fixed with a new
pair of glasses or contact lenses.
 Kids understand pain — something hurts until it’s better, and then the
pain goes away. Chronic pain, however, is likely to be much more diffi-
cult for them to comprehend.
 Problems with thinking and memory are particularly difficult for chil-
dren to understand and easy for them to misinterpret. They may think
that you aren’t interested enough to pay attention to what they’re
saying, or that you’re “getting dumb.” You can help your kids under-
stand the challenges you’re experiencing by involving them in some of
the strategies that you use to compensate for your cognitive problems.
You may want to give your kids the opportunity to “try on” some of your phys-
ical symptoms. Obviously, these “try-ons” don’t give the full picture, but they
offer kids a hint of what some MS symptoms can feel like. Here’s how to do it:
256
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

 Let your kids wear some light ankle weights while they walk around for a
little while. This will give them a sense of what it feels like when your
legs and ankles feel tired and weak.
 Put an elastic bandage around their knees or elbows so they can feel
what spasticity (stiffness) feels like.
257
Chapter 17: Parenting: It Wasn’t Easy Before You Had MS!
Tapping resources for kids
The National MS Society offers a lot of good
resources to help you explain MS to your chil-
dren. Here are a few of them:
 Timmy’s Journey to Understanding MS is a
fun cartoon about Timmy and his dad that
helps explain MS to younger children. Call
(800) FIGHT-MS (800-344-4867) to request a
copy (DVD or video).
 Keep S’myelin is a free newsletter for chil-
dren who are 6 to 12 years old. Each issue
has information about a specific MS symp-
tom or issue, cartoons, games, and a pull-
out section for parents that provides
information and resources to help you talk
to your kids about MS. You can subscribe by
calling (800) FIGHT-MS. Or, you can find the
interactive, online version of each issue at
www.nationalmssociety.org/ks.
 Two brochures are available specifically for
children:

Someone You Know Has MS: A
Booklet for Families (for kids 5 to 12 years
old). You can access this brochure at www.
nationalmssociety.org/family
book.

When a Parent Has MS: A Teenager’s
Guide. To access this brochure, visit www.
nationalmssociety.org/teen
guide.
 “The Journey Club” is a chapter-sponsored
education program for parents with MS and
their children who are 5 to 12 years old. The
sessions provide entertaining activities
designed to help families discuss issues
related to the family’s journey with MS,
including symptoms, emotional issues, and
changes in family life.
 Chapter-sponsored children’s camps give
kids who have a parent with MS the oppor-
tunity to discover a lot about MS while
enjoying recreational activities.
 Chapter-sponsored “Family Days” offer fam-
ilies the opportunity to socialize while learn-
ing about MS in lectures and workshops.
To find out about the programs your chapter has
to offer, call (800) FIGHT-MS.
Parents are sometimes reluctant to make use of
these resources with their children. They have
all kinds of reasons, including busy schedules, a
reluctance to make MS a focus of attention, and
a worry that their children will be upset by what
they read, see, or hear. Parents also say to us
(and themselves), “Oh, we’re doing fine — we
don’t need that yet.” But, these resources are
for everyone — even those families who are
“doing fine.” Don’t wait for some kind of family
crisis to get involved in these activities. It’s
much easier to help your kids understand your
MS as you go along than to wait for a crisis that
will be much more difficult to deal with.

 Place an elastic bandage around your kids’ chests or tummies. This can
give them a pretty good imitation of the uncomfortable sensory symp-
tom that feels like an “MS hug.”
 Smear a little petroleum jelly on a pair of sunglasses to demonstrate
what blurry vision looks like.
 Stick a little square of cellophane tape in the center of each eyeglass to
show what patchy vision can look like.
 Have your kids put on kitchen gloves, and then tell them to try and
button a shirt, pick up pennies, or unwrap a piece of hard candy. This
will help them see how sensory changes in your hands can make it diffi-
cult for you to do things.
 Tell you kids to spin in a circle until they’re dizzy. When they’re dizzy,
tell them that is what vertigo can feel like for you.
Mood changes are more difficult to demonstrate, but they’re just as impor-
tant to explain. Kids definitely know when you’re down or cranky. And they’re
quick to assume that they’re the cause — particularly if you take your moods
out on them. So, it’s a good idea to talk about your mood swings if you have
them. And be sure to tell your kids that your moods aren’t because of them.
Parenting around Your MS Symptoms
You probably have some set ideas about what parents ought to be able to do
with and for their children. If you don’t have kids yet, you may be picturing
the way your mom and dad did things with you. If you already have children,
you’re probably busy comparing what things were like before you got MS
with how you’re feeling now. Whatever your situation, you’re probably worry-
ing about how MS can or will get in the way of doing stuff with your kids. So,
in this section, we talk about some ways to get around your symptoms and
think more flexibly about being a parent with MS.
“I’m so tired that I’m in 
bed before they are!”
If you experience MS fatigue, you know that when you hit that wall, there’s no
way around it — all of a sudden, you’re simply out of gas (we talk about strate-
gies for managing MS fatigue in Chapter 7). Unfortunately, MS fatigue is likely
to peak just about the same time that the kids are coming home from school,
dinner needs to be cooked, and the family is getting together for the evening.
If you’re coming home from a long day at work, you may not have much
258
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

energy left for anyone or anything. Here are some ideas to help you make the
most of your family time:
 Make good use of power naps. If you can carve out 30 minutes to rest
before the kids get home, do it. Or, if you can come in from work and
rest for a little while before joining the family, do it. Kids will understand
your need for rest time as long as you explain the plan and promise to
do something with them afterwards.
If you don’t need or want to sleep during your rest time, you can invite
your kids to read with you, tell you about their day, or play a quiet game.
 Set your priorities. If quality time with your kids is high on your list,
spend less time on the things that aren’t as important. Figure out what
you want to do with each child — help with homework, read a bedtime
story, or watch a program — and plan around it. You don’t need to
spend a lot of time — you just need to make the time you have count.
 Keep things simple. Dinner doesn’t need to be a banquet. Come up with
some simple but nourishing menus, and do things the easiest way possi-
ble (for example, by using pre-cut salad ingredients or planning menus
that provide plenty of leftovers).
Take a look at the book by Shelley Peterman Schwarz called Multiple
Sclerosis: 300 Tips for Making Life Easier (Demos Medical Publishing,
2006) for ideas on how to save your energy for the important stuff.
 Ask for help. It’s okay to ask family members to pitch in and help — and
to remind them how everyone will benefit in the long run. For instance,
consider these examples: “Sara, if you help me with the dishes tonight,
we’ll have more time to spend on your science project.” Or, “Honey, would
you make the kids’ lunches so I can sit and read with them for a while?”
Just remember that teamwork makes the chores go faster and you may
even have some fun while you’re doing them.
Sometimes, MS fatigue has the last word. If you need to lie down, invite your
kids to join you for a bedtime story or a nice chat and a cuddle.
“How can I be a good dad 
if I can’t even play ball?”
In spite of what you may think, there are lots of ways to be a good parent.
Take some time to think about what kids need most. Sure, every child is dif-
ferent, but they all need to be loved, and to feel safe, secure, and cared for.
Even though you may think that playing catch, building treehouses, or baking
elaborate desserts is what being a dad or mom is all about, the reality is that
it’s about being there for your kids — no matter how you’re able to do that.
259
Chapter 17: Parenting: It Wasn’t Easy Before You Had MS!

We’ve known a lot of dads who couldn’t run around and play catch, but who
still coached the team or cheered loudly from the sidelines. And we’ve know
a lot of moms who went on class trips, volunteered at school, or became
Brownie or Cub Scout leaders even though they were using a scooter or
wheelchair. The point is that your kids want you to care about what they do
and they want you to be involved — even if you have to do it differently than
you ever imagined.

More from the mouth of babes
Here’s some more of what kids have to say
about living with a parent or grandparent with
MS:
Sean (age 8): “When I was 5 years old, my mom
lost her eyesight in one eye. So, we went from
one doctor to another and after many tests, they
found out she had MS. I remember her being
happy to finally know what was happening with
her body. I can’t say we are happy she has MS,
but at least we can do things to make things
easier for her. We go to her doctor’s as a family
sometimes. Her doctor is so cool. He always sits
down with us to make sure we understand what
is happening to her body. My favorite parts of
the day are spent with my mom. She swims a lot
and plays lots of games. The part about MS that
is hard is watching her take a shot every day.
But I don’t like anything that hurts her. I know
the most frustrating part of MS for her is that
she is so tired and gets frustrated easily. I do
more chores than most of my friends, but that’s
okay. That’s what family is all about.”
Sallie (age 9): “My mom has MS. Sometimes it’s
hard having a mom with MS but I know that she
needs help. I love my mom a ton. Me and my
brother think MS can be a bother but I love my
mom for who she is and I hate MS for what it is.”
Timothy (age 6): “My mom got MS. She said she
wouldn’t lose MS until they find a cure. It made
me want to find a cure right away. I was very
scared when my mom went to the hospital. I
didn’t know if she was going to die but my dad
said she wasn’t going to die from MS. She has
trouble walking sometimes but she is still a good
mom. I try to help her when I can. I don’t know
a lot about MS but I know it is [in] her central
nervous system. But sometimes it makes her
drop stuff or forget things. My mom said she
could be in a wheelchair too but I told her that
would be okay and that I would push her. I know
some day they will find a cure and my mom will
be better forever.”
Kelles (age 11):
My Hero Grandma
I have a special hero,
her name is Grandzanne.
She teaches me lots of things,
most important that “I can!”
She’s had lots of hard things in her life,
she’s in a wheelchair, too.
But that has never stopped her,
from what she wants to do.
For years she was a teacher,
and now she writes a book.
She’s always like to fight MS,
no matter how much control it took.
Grandzanne is my role model.
She’s never down . . . instead,
she always looks on the bright side,
eager to see what’s ahead!

“How can I discipline ’em 
if I can’t catch ’em?”
Moms and dads who can’t get around as quickly or easily as they used to
worry about how they’ll be able to discipline their children. In other words, if
they can’t outrun their kids, how can they maintain any kind of control? Well,
the fact is that most kids can outrun their parents eventually anyway — with
or without MS. So, discipline has to be about more than just moving fast enough
to catch kids or give them a wallop on the bottom. When it isn’t more than that,
any smart kid will quickly realize that staying out of reach is the best strategy.
Discipline needs to be about clear, consistent expectations, firm limits, pre-
dictable consequences, and mutual respect — all of which are possible with
or without MS. Obviously, the earlier the groundwork is laid, the easier it is. If
discipline in your household has always depended on your ability to move
faster, it will be tougher now to restructure things. So, think about having
some family discussions about rules and expectations. Even young kids can
participate in this kind of family powwow. Let them help in setting some of
the rules and determining some of the consequences — you’ll be surprised at
how much more willing your children are to live by these rules when they’ve
had some say in the situation.
Parental teamwork is key to effective discipline. In other words, it’s important
for parents to agree on the rules and be consistent in enforcing them. Here
are a few suggestions to reinforce your teamwork:
 Agree to support each other’s decisions. The quickest way to sabotage
your disciplinary efforts is to let your kids play one of you off against the
other. If Johnny gets a “no” about something from mom, and then gets a
“yes” from dad, guess who Johnny’s going to ask first the next time around?
So, if you aren’t sure whether the answer to Johnny should be yea or
nay, talk it over with your partner first and then give Johnny the answer.
If you aren’t sure whether Johnny has already asked his other parent,
find out before giving your answer.
 Try to avoid the “Just wait until your father (or mother) gets home!”
school of discipline. First of all, this method diminishes your own
parental role, and second, it sets the other parent up as the tough guy
(or gal). If a kid’s behavior demands some consequences, make those
consequences clear right then and there.
 Make sure that the MS doesn’t diminish your parental role in anyone’s
eyes — starting with your own and your partner’s. If the consistent
message to the kids is that you’re in charge (no, this isn’t a democracy),
you’ll find that your ability to set and enforce limits with your kids will
be greatly enhanced.

Chapter 17: Parenting: It Wasn’t Easy Before You Had MS!

Employing Effective Parenting Strategies
Parenting is never easy — it wasn’t a piece of cake before MS came along and
it won’t be now. So, this section gives you some strategies to keep in mind.
Call a spade a spade: Let MS take 
the blame when it needs to
Sometimes MS is going to get in the way of things that you or your kids want
to do. But, by being open about the disease and your symptoms, you make it
easier for your kids to understand why plans sometimes need to be changed
or activities need to be postponed. It’s okay for them to be angry at the MS
(just like it’s okay for you to be angry at it). And, in the end, they’ll feel a lot
less guilty about expressing anger at the disease than at you.
To get the ball rolling, you can start by sharing your own anger at the disease —
by saying, for example, “I get so mad at my MS when it keeps me from doing
something I want to do with you. I was really looking forward to our bike ride
today, but I’ll give you a rain check on the bike ride and we can think of a fun
substitute for today.”
Polish up your creativity and flexibility
Whether you like it or not, MS is going to get in the way sometimes. Relapses
or day-to-day symptoms have a way of interfering with the best-laid plans.
The key for anyone, particularly for parents, is to have a backup plan. In fact,
we recommend having a backup strategy for any major outing, trip, or activ-
ity. This may sound like negative thinking, but it’s actually a way for families
to hope for the best while planning for the worst. Kids (and adults) learn to
roll with the punches more easily when they know that they can count on
something really good in the near future.
It’s important not to let MS steal the show. If your MS symptoms are affecting
your ability to enjoy some favorite family activities, don’t be shy about doing
them in a different way than you normally do. Ask the rehab professionals for
suggestions on how to adapt some of those activities to the demands of your
MS (see Chapter 7 for more information about the role of the rehabilitation
team in managing your MS). If, for example, fatigue or balance problems are
making bike riding more difficult, think about investing in a tandem bike or a
three-wheeler. Flexibility is the key — if you’re willing to think about doing
things differently, you can do almost anything.
262
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

Call on your support network
Grandparents, uncles, aunts, neighbors, and friends can be wonderful sources
of support. Even though you may want to do everything with your kids all of
the time, the reality is that you may need to pick and choose your activities.
So, instead of asking your kids to give up the activities that you can’t partici-
pate in, think about getting some other folks involved to take your place.
Children can get a lot of support and enjoyment from other adults in their life.
For example, if you’re fortunate enough to have your kids’ grandparents in
the area, this week’s soccer game may be a great opportunity for them to
enjoy their grandchild. They go cheer at the game while you rest up, and then
give you the play-by-play as soon as they get home. Or, if you can’t be chauf-
feur this month, perhaps a neighbor could take over driving the kids for a
while — and you do something for her after you’re back on your feet.
Remember, MS isn’t always to blame —
other people’s teenagers are a pain too
Parents with MS have a tendency to blame everything on their MS — if
Susie’s moping around the house, Jimmy’s not doing well in school, Carol’s
having nightmares, or Sam’s locked in his room all the time, it must be the

MS. Even though MS may certainly be the problem, it generally isn’t (take a
look at the section “Handle little problems before they get bigger” later in the
chapter to be sure).
Kids hit all kinds of bumps in the road that may have absolutely nothing to
do with you or MS. By jumping to the wrong conclusion, you may miss other
things going on with your children that need your attention. Or, you may beat
yourself up with a lot of guilt when it’s just standard teenage stuff. It’s impor-
tant to keep an open mind (as well as open eyes and ears) so you can figure
out what’s making your child upset. For example:
 Susie may be moping because she’s angry at you for being different from
other dads, or she may be ticked off that you wouldn’t let her get that
tattoo she’s been wanting for months.
 Sam may be locked in his room because he’s fed up with your MS, or he
may be sad because he hasn’t been able to get a date for the prom.
Handle little problems 
before they get bigger
When your kids are acting up or you’ve noticed differences in their behavior
or mood, you may want to know how to tell if they’re running into problems
due to your MS or if something else is going on. Even though you don’t want
to jump to the conclusion that MS is the root of all evil, you also don’t want
to miss the times when it is.
Here are some typical scenarios and the best ways to handle them:
 Your 5-year-old starts wetting his bed after two years with a “clean”
record. You’re reading a bedtime story and he tells you that he’s afraid
something bad is going to happen to you. He saw all the medicine in the
refrigerator and peeked at those needles in the box, and now maybe he
thinks that you’re going to die.
Explain to him that the medicines are good for you and that they’re help-
ing your MS. Also, consider going online with him to look at some issues
of Keep S’myelin (see the sidebar “Tapping resources for kids” for details),
so that he can understand more about how you take care of your MS.
 Your 10-year-old suddenly stops bringing friends home. When you
have a heart-to-heart, you discover that his friends have been teasing
him about your scooter and he’s feeling embarrassed.
Consider calling his teacher and volunteering to come in and talk to the
kids about MS and give them a chance to see the scooter up close.
 Your 14-year-old suddenly becomes preoccupied with her health. While
you’re riding in the car one day (this is the best place for conversations
264
Part IV: Managing Lifestyle Issues 

because everyone’s a captive audience), your daughter asks what her
chances are of getting MS.
To best deal with this question, call the National MS Society for some
info about genetics. You can also ask her if she’d like to come to your
next neurologist appointment to get some reassurance from a pro.
 Your 17-year-old starts making noises about living at home for college.
When pressed, she tells you that she’s worried about the costs of living
on campus and thinks she should stay around to help.
In this case, reassure her that the college money is set aside — and that
it’s important to you that she has this college experience. You can work
out a deal that she will get a part-time job to help pay for her extras.
And, be sure to reassure her that you’ll keep her posted on how you’re
doing and let her know immediately if her help is needed.
Obviously, not all problems are this easily resolved, but these scenarios point
out how youngsters’ worries can show up in their everyday behavior. With a
little prodding, though, you can usually get to the root of things and get your
kids talking about what’s on their minds.
Allow kids to be kids
Moms and dads with MS may need to look to others — their partners, chil-
dren, extended family members, and friends — for help with their daily activi-
ties or their care (see Chapter 15 for details about care partnerships in MS).
But sometimes, children are given more caregiving responsibilities than they
can handle. Even though this doesn’t happen often, in this section, we want
to emphasize that kids need to be able to be kids — not miniature adults. So,
we give you several tips on how to avoid overloading your kids.
Avoid assigning too many chores
Having chores around the house is not a problem for kids. Many kids who
have a parent with MS end up doing a few more household chores than their
peers, but it’s generally not a big deal. Particularly if everyone in the house-
hold pitches in, and the chores are done on a rotating basis so that no one
person always get stuck with the yucky ones, the kids don’t seem to mind
much. In fact, children and teens are often pretty proud of their contribution
to the household and the skills they develop.
The problem begins when household chores interfere with schoolwork,
social activities, sports, and so on — the activities that are important to a
child’s development and well-being. So, if your children don’t have time to do
their own stuff, you probably need to reassess and adjust the situation.
265
Chapter 17: Parenting: It Wasn’t Easy Before You Had MS!

Be careful not to heap on too much responsibility
Developing a sense of responsibility is healthy for kids. However, being given
responsibilities that are more than they can handle isn’t. Kids get anxious
when your expectations exceed their abilities, particularly when they believe
that your safety and well-being depend on them.
For example, consider the story of Wendy, a 5-year-old who became upset
when her mom started falling a lot. She felt that it was her job to take care of
her mother, but didn’t have the strength or the know-how to help. After
awhile, Wendy was scared to be home alone with her mom. When the mom’s
neurologist heard about the problem, he referred Wendy’s mom to a physical
therapist (PT) to learn how to use a walker, and an occupational therapist
(OT) to learn how to make their home safer and more accessible. The OT
also helped Wendy and her mom develop a plan to handle any future falls.
Now, emergency numbers are posted by the phone, her mom is more stable
on her feet, and Wendy isn’t scared to be home alone with her any more.
So, while developing a sense of responsibility is a good thing, too much of a
good thing isn’t healthy for any child. If you need more help than your chil-
dren are able to provide safely and confidently, talk over your options with
your healthcare team and call the National MS Society (800-FIGHT-MS or
800-344-4867) for tips on finding help in your home.
Establish boundaries
Sometimes kids — particularly those of single parents — end up having to
provide more personal care than is appropriate. For example, a mom or dad
who needs help with dressing, bathing, or toileting may call on a son or
daughter for help. Even though this kind of situation is sometimes unavoid-
able, young children and teens shouldn’t be involved in a parent’s intimate
care because it’s too uncomfortable for both the parent and the child. Every
effort should be made to make other arrangements, either by enlisting the
help of adult relatives or by hiring someone to provide the assistance.
Contact the National MS Society by calling (800) FIGHT-MS if you need assis-
tance finding resources in your community to help with your care.

In This Chapter
 Understanding why people with MS leave the workforce
 Recognizing important benefits of continued employment
 Stepping up to your employment challenges
 Exploring the ADA and how it works for you
 Exhausting your options before leaving the workforce
I
t wasn’t all that long ago when one of the first “prescriptions” for someone
newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) was to “quit your job and go
home and rest.” So, following the doctor’s advice, lots of people trudged
home, put their feet up, and then got really bored. Today things are different.
Even though MS may affect your employment situation at some point along
the way — depending on the types of symptoms you have and the kind of
work you do — we now know that quitting work doesn’t have to be part of
your treatment plan.
This chapter, then, is about how you can keep working as long as you’re able
and eager to do so. We explain why people leave their jobs — the symptoms,
the attitudes (their own and other people’s), and the environmental obsta-
cles that nudge them out of the workforce. And, we give you the information
you need to make the choices that are right for you and your family.
Understanding the High Rate 
of Unemployment in MS
So, you want to know why people with MS leave work. Well, even though lots
of different factors are to blame, an underlying theme is a lack of information
about available options. Here are a few of the most common reasons why
people end up leaving the workforce:

 Their symptoms are making it difficult for them to function at work.
More folks leave the workforce because of fatigue and cognitive issues
than any other symptoms. Others may leave because they’re experienc-
ing embarrassing problems — with their bladder or bowel, for example.
What isn’t clear is how many of these individuals are unaware of the
treatment strategies and on-the-job accommodations that may help
them remain comfortably on the job (check out Chapters 7, 8, and 9 for
detailed information about managing symptoms and the section
“Knowing Your Rights under the ADA” later in this chapter for more
details on job accommodations). They may quit before learning about
the resources that are available to help them, only to discover that they
feel much better in a few weeks or months but have no job to go back to.
 Their well-meaning families, friends, and health professionals may be
encouraging them to get away from all the stress. If this sounds like
your situation, just remember that the relationship between stress and
MS is murky at best, and unemployment (and therefore lack of money)
isn’t such a hot antidote to stress. Instead, take a look at Chapter 12 for
some more practical (and less expensive!) stress management strategies.
 They’re just too uncomfortable about their diagnosis to disclose it to
anyone else. Because some amount of disclosure is required to request
work accommodations, these folks never get to see how modifications in
their work environment or schedule could help them do their job (flip to
“Disclosing your MS in the workplace” later in this chapter for details).
 Their symptoms are causing problems with driving and transporta-
tion. Without information about possible car modifications, community
carpooling programs, or community transportation options, they leave
work because they think they can’t get there. Check out Chapter 4 to see
how occupational therapists (OTs) can get you on the move again, and
call the National MS Society (800) FIGHT-MS (800-344-4867) to be
referred to a qualified specialist in your area.
Counting the Reasons to Keep on Truckin’
Apart from the obvious — that working brings in a paycheck — you can find
lots of other reasons why staying in the workforce may be in your best inter-
est. For example, consider the following:
 Adding to your financial security is a good thing. The longer you
remain in the workforce, the more you can put into savings and the
higher your benefits are likely to be in the event that you do need to
take disability retirement someday. In the long run, building financial
security is likely to reduce your stress a lot more than leaving the work-
force does.
270
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

 Fringe benefits are valuable. The fringe benefits provided by your 
job — such as health insurance — may be among your most valuable
assets. So, you really want to think twice before giving those up (flip to
Chapter 19 for more detailed information about insurance).
 Your work is a key part of your identity. People often define them-
selves, at least in part, by the kind of work they do. When you leave the
workforce, you may be giving up a big chunk of your identity — not to
mention an important source of self-esteem and self-confidence — 
without even realizing it.
 Feeling productive is important. Most folks like to feel as if they’re con-
tributing — to their families, to their communities, and to society as a
whole. In fact, one of the biggest issues for people who become severely
disabled, by MS or any other condition, is how to continue to feel valu-
able to the world around them. So leaving the workforce early because
of MS can short-circuit those feelings of productivity.
 Self-sufficiency feels good. Feeling self-sufficient is a big part of feeling
like a competent grown-up. Feeling dependent — and not in control of
your own financial resources and choices — can be a real bummer. So,
while the idea of being able to rely on disability benefits or other people
can be comforting when you’re in the throes of a relapse, you may find
that it isn’t so comfortable over the long haul.
 Being a role model for others feels good, too. When you find ways to
meet challenges in the workplace (or anyplace else for that matter), you
become a role model for others — your kids, other people with disabili-
ties, and anyone else who’s paying attention. And that’s something to
feel really good about.
Speed Bumps Ahead: Recognizing 
the Job-Related Challenges
Depending on your symptoms, the kind of work you do, and the environment
in which you work, you’re bound to run into challenges along the way. Some of
these challenges may be related to your symptoms and others may have more
to do with attitudes (yours and other people’s) about your MS. Being on the
alert for these challenges will make it a lot easier for you to meet them head-on.
When symptoms get in the way
For many kinds of jobs, some combination of good symptom management
and reasonable job accommodations from your employer can keep you work-
ing for a long time. We know that approximately 40 percent of people with MS
are still employed 20 years after their diagnosis. This means that lots of
271
Chapter 18: Keeping Your Place in the Workforce

people are finding ways to work around their symptoms. (Check out Chap-
ters 7, 8, and 9 for details on how to manage your specific symptoms.)
Sometimes, however, your particular line of work and your MS simply don’t
mix. If your job is a physical one, problems with weakness, balance, or coor-
dination may make it impossible for you to be safe and productive. A con-
struction worker, for example, may have relatively mild symptoms but may
still be unable to do the job. If your work is all in your head, so to speak, then
cognitive changes may interfere with your effectiveness as a lawyer or scien-
tist (even though problems with walking may not). In other words, there are
some job functions that are so dependent on particular abilities that even the
slightest changes in those abilities interfere to a significant degree.
If and when you hit the fork in the road — where you’ve exhausted the possi-
ble on-the-job accommodations and you’re unable to function in your current
job because of your symptoms — you have two options:
 Make use of your talents in other types of employment
 Retire on disability and perhaps put your talents to work in some volun-
teer capacity
Even though making changes in your work life can be difficult and painful,
keep in mind that a fork in the road can also provide unexpected opportuni-
ties to try something new, explore a hidden talent, or go in a new direction.
Take a look at the National MS Society’s publication, A Place in the Workforce,
at www.nationalmssociety.org/workforce for some eye-opening info
about what people with MS can do when they put their minds to it.
The members of your healthcare team are your key allies in your employ-
ment efforts. (Check out Chapter 4 for more information on these helpful 
professionals.) For example:
 The neurologist and nurse can help you implement optimal symptom
management strategies.
 Physical and occupational therapists can recommend the tools, mobility
aids, and environmental changes you need to be effective in your job.
 A vocational rehabilitation counselor can help you identify strategies to
stay in your job or sort out your options if you think a change is in order.
When attitudes get in the way
Sometimes attitudes — your own or other people’s — get in the way of your
job even more than MS symptoms do. For example, many people mistakenly
assume that anyone with a chronic illness or disability can’t be a productive
employee or a valuable member of the team. Fortunately, attitudes can 
be changed with a little patience, some good information, and effective 
communication.
272
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

Dealing with your own attitudes
It’s a good idea to take a look at how you think about MS and disability in gen-
eral because negative attitudes can trip you up as easily as weakness, stiff-
ness, or any other physical MS symptom can. For example, maybe you’ve
always thought that a person with MS couldn’t or shouldn’t work; that
anyone who used a mobility aid wasn’t very smart; that your job could only
be done one way; or that no one at your workplace would ever understand
your situation. In other words, your attitudes may interfere more with your
creativity and productivity at work than your MS does.
If your knee-jerk response to managing your MS symptoms at work tends to
be a negative one — “It’ll never work.” or “It’s not worth the effort.” — you
may want to think about a little attitude tuneup. We talk a lot in this book
about getting comfortable with the idea of doing things differently, because
the more flexible and creative you can be, the more easily you’ll be able to
come up with strategies to work around whatever physical or cognitive chal-
lenges you have. After you have these workarounds sorted out for yourself,
you’ll be ready to confidently pitch your ideas to your boss and co-workers.
If you’re more of a rose-colored-glasses type, you may have a tendency to
plow ahead without thinking things through. Even though cockeyed optimism
can be a wonderful thing, it’s also helpful to be informed and cautious where
employment is concerned so that the choices you make are in your own best
interest. Slow down just enough to get your ducks in a row by
 Giving some careful thought to how your MS may impact your produc-
tivity at work — now or down the road. The situation generally works
out a lot better if you can identify and address the problems you’re
having before you boss does it for you.
 Getting familiar with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) so you know what protections the law provides — and
doesn’t provide. Check out the section “Knowing Your Rights under the
ADA” later in the chapter for details.
 Thinking carefully through your disclosure decisions. These decisions
can have long-lasting consequences because once the information about
your MS is out there, you can’t take it back. (For more info, check out
the section “Disclosing your MS in the workplace” later in the chapter.)
Dealing with other people’s attitudes
After you’ve done your own attitude check, you’re ready to deal with what-
ever other people may be thinking. Your boss, for example, may have known
someone with MS who became severely disabled. He may assume that
anyone with MS will have the same problems and will therefore be a big liabil-
ity on the job. Or, he may worry that your MS will drive up the company’s
insurance rates. Your colleagues may assume that you won’t be able to hold
your own weight, which could mean extra work for them.
273
Chapter 17: Keeping Your Place in the Workforce

People tend to carry around a lot of misconceptions and prejudices, so your
job will be to help folks understand more about your MS. Flip to Chapter 14
for some suggestions on how to present your MS face to the world. And if you
decide you’re ready to disclose your MS, you may want to give your boss and
colleagues a copy of the National MS Society brochure, Information for
Employers (www.nationalmssociety.org/employerinfo). The Society’s
general information brochures (www.nationalmssociety.org/general
info) are also great for giving people background info about the disease.
You’ll be giving the people in your workplace a helpful attitude check when
you work around your MS symptoms to remain a productive employee.

Knowing Your Rights under the ADA
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was passed in 1990, pro-
hibits discrimination on the basis of disability — in employment, public ser-
vices, public accommodations, and telephone services. When it comes to
employment, the ADA basically says that personnel decisions — hiring, pro-
moting, and firing — must be made without regard to a person’s disability
status. This means that the provisions of the ADA, which we discuss in this
section, are your best legal protection on the job. That being said, the ADA
isn’t a bulletproof vest, so you need to proceed with care.
Disclosing your MS in the workplace
When you’re trying to decide who in your office should know about your MS,
it’s important to remember that disclosure in the workplace should generally
be on a need-to-know basis. So ask yourself the following questions:
 Who needs to know?
 Why do they need to know?
 How much do they need to know?
 What’s the best way to provide the information that they need?
Take the time to think through the answers to these questions carefully. Before
disclosing your MS to anyone at work, you should research the issues and con-
sult with the experts to ensure that you’re making the right decision. The rea-
sons for all this caution are pretty straightforward: After the information is
public, you can’t take it back; you can never be sure that other people will have
your best interests at heart, particularly if your interests conflict with theirs;
and you want to keep as many options open for yourself as possible.
When it’s best to disclose
After you’ve asked all of the appropriate questions, you’re ready to survey
the situation and decide whether you’re ready to tell your boss or your office
mates. Here are the best reasons for disclosing your MS at work:
 You have visible symptoms. After you begin having symptoms that
others can see or that require you to use some kind of mobility aid, you
may want to explain what’s going on before they come to their own con-
clusions. Particularly if you aren’t as steady on your feet as you used to
be, you want to make sure that no one mistakes your imbalance for
problems with drugs or alcohol.
275
Chapter 17: Keeping Your Place in the Workforce

 Your productivity is down or you’re missing a lot of work days. If you
become concerned that your productivity isn’t what it used to be, it’s a
good idea to bring up the subject before your boss does. But, make sure
you’re ready to explain what the problems are — and what you’re plan-
ning to do about them — before having the conversation. Any boss will
feel better knowing that you have a plan for solving the problem.
 You feel more comfortable with things out in the open. Being open
about things may simply be your style. Or you may feel that your work
environment is such that total frankness is the best way to go. Use your
best judgment, but keep in mind that even the most supportive employ-
ers can become less supportive when they believe that their own inter-
ests are threatened.
Some people feel strongly that they need to be totally frank in a job
interview. Even though this honesty may be admirable, it may not be
smart. Remember that under the ADA, a prospective employer can’t ask
if you have a disability unless your need for an accommodation to do
the job is visibly apparent. So, unless you need an accommodation for
the interview process or for the job itself, you may want to keep mum.
There’s no reason for you to include information about your MS on your
resume! Even if you have a gap in your work history, don’t include infor-
mation about your MS diagnosis. Of course, if you’re asked during a job
interview about the gap, it’s important not to lie. At that point, it will be
up to you decide how much information you want to share. You can, for
example, say that you were dealing with some health issues, or you can
go into an explanation about your MS.
 You want to request accommodations. Maybe everything is still going
fine on the job — you make it through the day, your productivity is
good, and no one has a clue what’s going on. But, you’re wasted by the
end of the day and convinced that you’re going to crash if you don’t
make some changes. In this case, even though you have no obvious or
visible reason to disclose, you’re required to disclose that you have a
disability if you want to request some on-the-job accommodations.
Planning your disclosure strategy
After you’ve decided to disclose your MS, it’s important to plan your strategy
carefully. Follow these steps for a smooth disclosure:
1. Figure out who’s the best person at work to talk to.
You may need to talk to your boss, someone in the human resources
department, or maybe your project manager. The answer will differ
depending on your work setting. Your goal is to get the information to
the people who need to know, not to be a source of office gossip.
2. Plan your disclosure statement with someone who is knowledgeable
about the provisions of the ADA.
276
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

A National MS Society staff person can provide guidance for the disclo-
sure process. You can request assistance by calling (800) FIGHT-MS. You
can also discuss disclosure issues with someone at the Job Accommoda-
tion Network (JAN) at (800) 526-7234. After you have your strategy all
figured out, rehearse it several times with a couple of family members 
or friends.
3. Make your disclosure, but stick with the minimum amount of informa-
tion that will get you what you need.
If you’re planning to ask for an accommodation, the law only requires
that you provide some verification from your physician that you have a
disability. Technically, you aren’t even required at the outset to say that
you have multiple sclerosis. In reality, though, most employers want
more details.
If your employer asks for more information, including your diagnosis, you
may not have a whole lot of options. After you disclose your diagnosis,
you need to be prepared to help the person understand what MS is and
how it affects you. And you have to keep explaining if your situation
changes over time. Be open to questions — this is an educational process.
In making your disclosure, you’re letting your employer or prospective
employer know that you have a condition that affects you at work and that
with the appropriate accommodations you can excel at the job.
Understanding the terms used in the law
One of the key provisions of the ADA requires any employer with 15 or more
employees to provide reasonable accommodations for qualified workers who
have disabilities that make it possible for them to perform their essential job
functions. (However, remember that not all employers are covered by this law.
For example, the federal government isn’t required to comply with the ADA
employment provisions because it’s prohibited from discriminating against
employees with disabilities by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.)
To help you make sense of these laws and terms, consider the following 
definitions:
 A disability is any impairment that substantially limits a major life activ-
ity (seeing, hearing, walking, working, reading, and so on).
 An accommodation is a modification that makes it possible for a person
with a disability to apply or test for a job and perform the major func-
tions of the job. Here are examples of accommodations that could be
made for a person with MS:
• Altering the job application or testing procedures to accommodate
a person’s fatigue or mobility problems
277
Chapter 17: Keeping Your Place in the Workforce

• Providing special equipment, such as air conditioning for someone
with heat sensitivity or adaptive computer software for someone
with a vision problem
• Creating a flexible work schedule, such as allowing for telecommut-
ing, part-time schedules, or rest periods during the day
• Modifying the office space or bathrooms to make room for a
motorized scooter
• Providing a parking space close to the office entrance
 A reasonable accommodation is one that doesn’t cause the employer
undue hardship. In other words, the employer is expected to make every
effort to meet the employee’s needs unless the accommodation would
be too expensive or disruptive for the business. In reality, most accom-
modations requested by people with MS aren’t particularly costly.
 Essential job functions are the key activities in a particular job. They’re
the functions that require special expertise and that are specifically writ-
ten into the job description.
Even though employers are required to make reasonable accommodations,
they aren’t required to lower the standards that exist for all employees, elimi-
nate important job functions, or provide accommodations that would hurt
the business in a significant way. If you’re unable to perform the essential
functions of the job, even with reasonable accommodations, an employer can
terminate your employment.
Requesting reasonable accommodations
Under the ADA, the responsibility for requesting accommodations lies with
you. So, you need to be the one to figure out exactly what you need, and you
need to be the one to initiate the conversation. Don’t wait until your supervi-
sor starts complaining about your performance. We encourage you to keep
an eye on your own performance, recognize when it’s slipping, and figure out
what changes could be made that would help bring your performance back
up to snuff. Here are some tips to keep in mind when you’re thinking of asking
for workplace accommodations:
 Consult with your healthcare team. For instance, vocational rehabilita-
tion counselors and occupational therapists are particularly good at
identifying helpful accommodations.
 Request accommodations that will specifically enhance your perfor-
mance, and be prepared to explain how your employer will benefit.
 Be open to counter-suggestions. Your employer may have ideas that
could be just as useful as your own.
278
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

 Think creatively about ways in which assistive technology of vari-
ous kinds may be helpful. Some great resources include the Job
Accommodation Network (JAN), the ADA&IT Technical Assistance
Center, ABLEDATA, your local vocational rehabilitation agency, and your
occupational therapist (check out the sidebar “Get to know your
employment resources” for more details on these resources).
Some of your fellow employees may resent any accommodations that are
made for you — particularly if your symptoms are mostly invisible and they
misinterpret the changes as preferential treatment. If you think that people
are getting a little hot under the collar, be ready to explain how the accommo-
dations help you get the job done. After your co-workers understand the pur-
pose of the accommodations, they’ll get the picture that everyone benefits
from the outcome, not just you.
Calling in the EEOC
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which oversees
enforcement of the employment title of the ADA, is a good resource to know
about in case you and your employer can’t come to an agreement about
accommodations. Before calling in the big guns, however, it’s a good idea to try
to work things out with your employer if at all possible in order to avoid the
legal hassles. For instance, if you don’t get your first choice accommodation —
because your employer thinks it would be too expensive or too difficult to pro-
vide — see if you can come up with a compromise solution. If, after your best
efforts, no agreement is reached, you can file a complaint with the EEOC.
The EEOC can also assist you if
 You believe you’ve been terminated unfairly.
 Your work environment is hostile or discriminatory.
 The work environment has negatively changed since your disclosure.
 You believe you’ve been overlooked for job promotions or training
because of your disability.
If you need to file a complaint with the EEOC, be sure that you’re prepared
with careful documentation (which you’ve stored on your computer at home
rather than at the office!). Take the time to research the system so that you
know the ins and outs and can get the most help possible. For instance, it’s
important to know that EEOC claims have to be filed within a specific time-
frame after the alleged incident.

Thinking about Leaving Your Job
At one time or another (particularly after a really long, hard week, month, or
year of feeling crummy or battling difficult symptoms), you may find yourself
thinking about packing up and heading out of the office.
Deciding to leave your job is a complex decision that needs to be made care-
fully and in consultation with the experts, such as your physician, your voca-
tional rehab counselor, your rehab team, and anyone else whose expertise
you value. In this section, we provide you with some basic information to
jump-start those important conversations, as well as some significant issues
to keep in mind when making your decision.
Exhausting your short-term leave options
Before you make any long-term decisions, it’s important to make sure that
you’ve made full use of any available short-term leave options. For example:
 Find out if your company offers any kind of short-term disability policy
that would allow you to leave work for a defined period of time.
 Check out the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
at www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fmla. This act, which was passed in 1993,
requires that any employer with 50 or more employees who live within 
a 75-mile radius of the work locations (and all public or government
employers) to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for quali-
fied individuals who are dealing with a personal or family medical situa-
tion. The 12 weeks can be taken at one stretch or in chunks, with no
impact on your job or health benefits. To be eligible for FMLA, you need to
• Be working for an employer who’s covered by this law
• Have worked with that employer for at least 12 months
• Have worked at least 1,250 hours in the past 12 months
Looking into long-term disability options
If, in spite of all necessary accommodations and short-term leave options,
you’re still unable to perform your essential job functions, it’s time to look at
the alternatives. Perhaps other positions in your company would be more
suitable. Or maybe you could be retrained for work in some other field. If nei-
ther of these options seems feasible, you need to find out what disability
options you have. We discuss the most common options in the following two
subsections.
280
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

Long-term disability
Before making any final decisions, be sure to check out your company’s long-
term disability plan — particularly the definition of disabled that’s being used
by the plan (the definition tends to be very specific and very strict) and the
benefit it provides. The benefit provided is usually a percentage of your last
salary earned, so going to part-time employment before going out on this
type of disability plan is generally not a good idea. Make sure that you under-
stand how your company’s policy works so that you can compare it with the
benefits provided by Social Security. Most private long-term disability carri-
ers require you to apply for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) as well
because they can subtract from their benefit whatever you receive from SSDI.
Social Security Disability Insurance
Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which is a program run by the
Social Security Administration (SSA), is based on your prior work history. For
easy-to-understand information about SSDI, go to www.socialsecurity.
gov or www.nationalmssociety.org/SSDI.
Here are the requirements you must fulfill in order to be eligible for SSDI:
 You must have worked for a sufficient number of years (some of them
recently) and paid Social Security taxes.
 A physician must determine that you’re too disabled to work at any job.
 You can’t be working at the present time — or if you are, you must be
earning less than the level of “substantial gainful employment,” which is
$860 per month or $1,450 per month for those who are blind. These
amounts are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the cost of living.
For a person with MS, the SSA recognizes four impairments: gait (walking),
vision, cognitive problems, and fatigue (you can read more about these symp-
toms and their management in Chapters 7 and 9). In order to qualify for SSDI,
your neurologist must be able to document a significant deficit in at least one
of these four areas. Most SSDI applications are initially denied, in part
because physicians, including neurologists, have no training in how to fill
them out, and the application is a generic one that doesn’t lend itself well to
the impairments caused by MS. Be sure to check out the National MS Society
Web site at www.nationalmssociety.org/SSDI for a toolkit that helps
you and your neurologist file effective SSDI applications. If your initial appli-
cation is denied, don’t despair — you can appeal the SSA’s decision. If
needed, the National MS Society (800-FIGHT-MS) can refer you to an attorney
who can help you with the process.
If you qualify for SSDI and later decide that you want to try returning to work,
the SSA offers various kinds of work incentives to help you gradually transi-
tion back into the workforce. You can read more about the SSA’s work incen-
tives at www.socialsecurity.gov/work.

Chapter 17: Keeping Your Place in the Workforce

Making the choices that are right for you
When all is said and done, you know yourself and your situation better than
anyone else does. You’re the only one who can decide what works best for
you. If you’re pouring every ounce of energy into your job — leaving little or
no energy for yourself or your family — continuing to work may not be in
anyone’s best interest (yours or your family’s). If, on the other hand, your
work is a major source of personal gratification, take the time to look for grat-
ifying alternatives before leaving the workforce. All in all, achieving balance
in your life is important to your overall health and wellness.
In this situation, the “right” and “wrong” answers are never clearly marked.
So, you need to think carefully about your options and go for the one that
feels right for your situation. Fortunately, you don’t have to do this alone.
Your healthcare team and the National MS Society can help you find the infor-
mation you need to make an informed decision.

Getting a Grip on Insurance
In This Chapter
 Figuring out strategies for getting and keeping health insurance
 Taking the best advantage of your health coverage
 Following the steps to a successful insurance appeal
 Understanding disability insurance
 Considering other types of insurance
You’ve probably noticed that doctors, hospitals, prescription drugs,
mobility equipment, and a lot of other things that you may need to stay
healthy despite your multiple sclerosis (MS) cost a lot of money. But, luckily,
the bitter pill of healthcare costs is a lot easier to swallow when health insur-
ance picks up the tab — and the more your insurance covers, the better it
tastes.
In this chapter, we explain some of the basics of health insurance, as well as
disability, life, and long-term care insurance, so that you can take advantage
of the coverage and benefits for which you’re eligible. Our goal is to help you
figure out how to get and keep the insurance that you need so you can spend
less money out of your own pocket and less time worrying about it.
Considering Your Health Insurance
Options — It’s All about Eligibility
Because the United States doesn’t have universal health coverage, different
people come by their insurance eligibility in different ways, as the following
sections explain.
No matter how you get your health coverage, make sure that you know the
basic facts about the eligibility rules for your health plan. Without that knowl-
edge, you may make some faulty assumptions that could cost you a bundle.

For more detailed info about your insurance options, check out Health
Insurance Resource Manual: Options for People with a Chronic Illness or
Disability, 2nd edition, by Dorothy Northrop, Stephen Cooper, and Kimberly
Calder (Demos Medical Publishing, 2007).
Employment-based insurance programs
Most people in the United States have health insurance because they’re 
eligible for a group health plan from their employer or a family member’s
employer. Members of trade unions (and their dependents) are usually 
eligible for group coverage through the union.
If you’re eligible for group health benefits from an employer or union, it’s best
to enroll as soon as possible. In most cases, you’ll pay a small portion of the
premium through a regular payroll deduction, and your employer will pay the
balance. Federal law guarantees that no one can be singled out and denied
group health benefits on the basis of his or her health status (check out
“Protecting your coverage with HIPAA later in the chapter). Even if you don’t
enroll in the health plan until after your MS diagnosis, you’re still eligible.
But, anyone who delays enrollment for any reason is likely to be charged a
higher premium when they do enroll.
Keep in mind that employers aren’t required by law to offer health insurance
plans to their employees or their family members, and they’re free to make
changes in their insurance packages at any time.
Public health insurance programs
Many people are covered by a government-funded, public health insurance
program because they meet the established eligibility criteria. Public health
insurance programs are designed to meet the needs of people working for the
military or the government, or who don’t have access to other coverage
because of unemployment, age, income level, or disability. Public insurance
includes the following programs:
 Government employee benefits: Federal government employees can
enroll in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). State
and municipal employees are offered comparable programs.
 Medicare: This government entitlement program is designed to provide
health coverage for people outside the work force. To be eligible for
Medicare, you must meet one of the following requirements:
• You must be at least 65 years old.
• You must have been deemed “disabled” by the Social Security
Administration (SSA) for at least 24 months. (Check out Chapter 18
for more info about Social Security Disability.)
284
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

 Medicaid: This government entitlement program provides health insur-
ance for low-income people. To be eligible, you must meet the specific cri-
teria determined by your state government. (Check out 64.82.65.67/
medicaid/states.html for information about each state’s program.).
Although the states vary considerably, eligibility is based on your
income, your assets, and your marital and immigration status.
 State Child Health Insurance Programs (S-CHIPs): These public insur-
ance programs provide coverage to children 18 and under in every state.
Eligibility benefits are determined by each state, but families with
incomes too high for Medicaid eligibility can often enroll their children
in S-CHIP programs.
 TRICARE: This program provides health benefits for people in the
Active, Reserve, and Guard forces of the uniformed services and their
dependents.
 VA benefits: The Veterans Administration provides health benefits to
people who were honorably discharged from active military service.
Self-employment options
People who are self-employed — and therefore not eligible for coverage from
an employer’s group health plan or a public program — need to go shopping
for it themselves. And, we warn you now: Shopping for insurance isn’t easy. If
you’re self-employed, you’ll be shopping for individual insurance.
With this type of insurance, you not only have to pay the full cost of the cov-
erage yourself (shop around because the costs can vary a lot), but the eligi-
bility for it is typically based on your health status. In other words, it’s more
difficult to qualify for individual insurance if you have a medical condition.
Those people with a diagnosis of MS (or any other expensive health condi-
tion) are routinely (and legally!) denied coverage because insurance compa-
nies want to avoid the responsibility of insuring people who are known to
pose a significant financial risk.
Options if you don’t have health insurance
If you have MS (or any other serious health condition) don’t start your search
for insurance by calling insurance companies or brokers, or filling out lots of
application forms for insurance. Instead, begin by finding out what you are eligi-
ble for in spite of your “high risk” condition. The good news is that most states
have, or are moving toward, some mechanism to provide health insurance for
people who aren’t eligible for any of the programs we talk about earlier in this
section, or who are “un-insurable” due to their high risk. Read up on your state’s
laws and programs on www.healthinsuranceinfo.net; the site also pro-
vides info on programs such as “high-risk pools” that may meet your needs.
285
Chapter 19: Getting a Grip on Insurance

Keep in mind that finding a plan for which you’re eligible doesn’t mean that it
will fit your budget. But, we recommend that you get yourself insured if at all
possible, even if your only option is a plan with a monthly premium of $1,000
or a $4,000 annual deductible. If you’re physically able to work, your best
option is to find a job with an employer who offers health benefits. As we dis-
cuss in the next section, you can’t be denied enrollment in a group employer-
sponsored health plan because you have MS.
Keeping a Tight Hold on 
Your Health Insurance
To get and keep health insurance in this country, you have to be eligible for
it. Unfortunately, keeping the insurance you have can become difficult as
your life situations change. But, Congress and many states have passed laws
to protect your eligibility as you go through the most common life transi-
tions, such as getting too old to be covered by your parents’ insurance
policy, getting divorced, getting laid off from your job, or retiring. We discuss
the two biggies in the following sections: COBRA and HIPAA.
Continuing coverage with COBRA
COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act) was passed into law
by Congress in 1986. It protects your right to continued eligibility under your
group health plan for a certain number of months after coverage would oth-
erwise end — which is a particularly valuable protection for anyone with
high or unpredictable medical costs like those associated with MS care.
COBRA is also important because lapses of sixty-three days or more in health
insurance coverage make it difficult for a person to enroll in a new plan. With
a few exceptions, COBRA guarantees this right of continued eligibility for all
qualified beneficiaries (covered employees and their covered spouses and
dependents) for a limited time period after employment ends, provided the
former employee pays the former employer (or a designated third party) the
full premium plus a 2 percent surcharge. After you pay this premium and sur-
charge, your employer no longer pays any part of the cost of your coverage.
Qualifying for COBRA
COBRA protection is triggered by several different kinds of events:
286
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

 For employees:
• Your employment is terminated voluntarily or involuntarily for any
reason except gross misconduct.
• You change your work status to part-time and become ineligible for
your employer’s health plan.
 For spouses of covered employees (domestic partners aren’t covered):
• Your husband or wife (the covered employee) is terminated volun-
tarily or involuntarily for any reason except gross misconduct.
• Your husband or wife changes his or her work status to part-time,
resulting in ineligibility for the employer’s health plan.
• Your husband or wife becomes entitled to Medicare.
• You get a divorce or legal separation.
• Your husband or wife dies.
 For dependent children:
• The qualifying events for dependent children are the same as for
spouses (see the previous bullet)
• Child loses dependent status according to the plan rules (typically
by passing the age limit).
Putting COBRA benefits into action
The law requires your employer to notify you about your COBRA rights when
you join the group health plan and then again when you’re about to leave the
plan because of one of the triggering events listed in the section “Qualifying
for COBRA.” As a qualified COBRA beneficiary, you have 60 days from the
date of the COBRA offer to tell your employer whether you plan to elect or
reject the continued coverage. COBRA coverage begins on the same day that
the other coverage ends — without any gap in protection.
You can elect COBRA for yourself and any family member who’s covered
under the same plan. If your spouse is the covered employee, he or she can
elect it for you if you’re covered under the same plan.
Determining how long you receive COBRA benefits
The length of time that you receive COBRA benefits depends on what trig-
gered your COBRA eligibility. For example:
 If your job is terminated or your work hours are reduced, the COBRA
benefit period is 18 months.
 If the triggering event is loss of dependent status for an adult child, a
divorce or legal separation from, or the death of, your insured spouse,
the benefit period is extended to 36 months.
287
Chapter 19: Getting a Grip on Insurance

 If any qualified beneficiary (employee, spouse, dependent child)
becomes disabled during the first sixty days of COBRA coverage, he or
she may extend coverage for an additional 11 months.
To be eligible for this extension, you must give the insurance plan
administrator a copy of the Social Security Administration’s disability
determination within 60 days of receiving it. But bear in mind that the
premium can legally be increased by 50 percent for months 19 through
29. For more info on Social Security Disability, flip to Chapter 18.
Some additional facts about COBRA
COBRA is a complex federal law with a lot of twists and turns. So, if you’re
stumped, check with your health plan administrator or with the U.S.
Department of Labor (www.dol.gov) for more details. In the meantime, here
is some additional info:
 Federal law requires every employer with 20 or more employees to offer
COBRA benefits. However, many states go beyond this to require smaller
employers and other federally exempted employers to offer COBRA-like
benefits.
 By law, qualified beneficiaries (covered employees and their spouses
and dependents) are guaranteed benefits identical to those received
immediately before qualifying for COBRA.
 The cost of COBRA isn’t standardized because group health insurance
plans vary. Prepare for some sticker shock — but take comfort in the
fact that the COBRA premiums are lower than those for an individual
plan (because COBRA is an extension of group coverage).
 People who retire early on Social Security Disability are at risk of being
uninsured during the 24 months they must wait before Medicare kicks in
(check out the section “Public disability insurance: SSDI” later in the
chapter). So, it’s critically important for anyone leaving the workforce to
use their right to COBRA benefits to cover that gap. These same people
should also plan their finances accordingly (check out Chapter 20 for
more on financial planning with MS).
 When you elect COBRA, you’re agreeing to pay the premium for contin-
ued health benefits for yourself and, possibly, your dependents. Failure
to pay in a timely manner can result in termination of coverage — and
reinstatement is unlikely.
 Every piece of information that you receive in writing from your former
employer or COBRA administrator is a legal document, so keep it for
your personal protection.
288
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

Protecting your coverage with HIPAA
HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), like COBRA,
is another complex federal law designed to help protect people who have or
who are seeking insurance. However, unlike COBRA, this law specifically pro-
vides protection to people with a history of health problems. Here’s the gist
of what HIPAA does:
 It provides antidiscrimination protections. HIPAA guarantees that you
can’t be denied enrollment in a group health plan (generally an employ-
ment-based plan) on the basis of your health status, and you can’t be
charged a higher premium because of a disease or disability.
 It limits preexisting condition exclusions. HIPAA limits the length of
time (12 months for first-time enrollment in a health plan and 18 months
if you enroll any time other than the official open-enrollment period)
that a health plan can deny coverage for a preexisting condition. A preex-
isting condition is any health condition you had during the six-month
period before your new plan started — in other words, any health prob-
lem for which you saw a health professional or for which you were
treated (including taking a prescribed medication).
HIPAA also gives you (and your covered dependents) credit for the
amount of time you were insured by your previous plan (referred to as
prior coverage) and applies that credit to the preexisting condition exclu-
sion period of your new plan. This is called creditable coverage.
To help you prove your creditable coverage, HIPAA requires health plans
to give anyone who leaves a plan a certificate of coverage indicating the
amount of time he or she was covered. However, keep in mind that prior
coverage is not creditable if you have a gap of 63 or more days without
coverage.
HIPAA’s protections apply to most health plans, including employment-
related group policies, union and association plans, Medicare, Medicaid,
high-risk pool insurance, and more. Exceptions include so-called “temporary”
health policies, certain student plans, catastrophic or disease-specific poli-
cies, private disability policies, and dental or vision coverage.
When considering the purchase of any health insurance policy, be sure to ask
if it would be considered creditable coverage under HIPAA. For more informa-
tion about HIPAA, consult your employer, your health plan administrator, or
your state department of insurance.
The following section provides a few examples to help you get your head
around the logistics of COBRA and HIPAA.
289
Chapter 19: Getting a Grip on Insurance

Seeing COBRA and HIPAA work as a team
Making sense out of COBRA and HIPAA may be easier with a few examples.
Here are three that illustrate how these two complex laws can work together
to help you:
 George was diagnosed with MS while working for the ABC Corp. and was
insured by ABC’s group health plan. After three years at ABC, he took a
job with XYZ International and enrolled in their group health plan.
George was uninsured for nine days between the end of his ABC cover-
age and the start of his XYZ coverage. For any new employee that has
been uninsured for 63 or more days, XYZ’s plan excludes coverage for
preexisting conditions for the first 12 months of the employee’s cover-
age. Because George was uninsured for only nine days, all of his care
costs were covered as soon as his new plan went into effect.
 Annette, who has MS, was covered by her husband Greg’s group health
plan for the ten months he worked for DEF Corp. At ten months, he was
laid off. They didn’t elect COBRA because they couldn’t afford the premi-
ums. Within a month, Greg got a new job at HIJ Co. and immediately
signed up for the health plan they offered him and his family. Unfortu-
nately, Annette’s MS qualified as a preexisting condition, and HIJ’s plan
had a 12-month preexisting condition exclusion period. But, HIPAA
enabled Greg to apply the ten months of Annette’s prior coverage from
DEF to the 12-month exclusion period so that they only had to absorb
the uncovered costs for anything specifically related to her MS for two
months.
 Janet, a person with MS, lost her job and health benefits when her
employer downsized. She didn’t elect COBRA because of the expense.
Janet found another job three months later. Because more than 63 days
had elapsed between the two jobs, Janet didn’t get any credit for her
prior coverage and she had no insurance for MS-related healthcare
expenses for a full year. But, other, non-MS-related costs were covered.
If Annette or Janet had elected COBRA, they would have remained covered
until their new group coverage took over. When you have an expensive health
condition, it’s worth your while to invest in COBRA in order to stay covered
until you have a new policy, even if you have to borrow the money to do it.
Understanding the Ins and Outs 
of Your Health Insurance Plan
Given the soaring cost of healthcare in the United States, health insurance cov-
erage may be a person’s most valuable asset. And it’s particularly valuable for
290
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

anyone with MS because the costs related to managing this disease — includ-
ing medications, hospital stays, and mobility equipment — can be high. This
section is designed to help you ask the right questions about your current cov-
erage or about any health plan that you’re considering joining in order to make
sure that it offers the greatest possible coverage for your MS needs.
To take best advantage of your health coverage, you need to make careful
choices based on the cost and practical implications of the following factors:
 Who’s covered under the policy — employee, spouse, dependents?
(Those who are covered are considered qualified individuals.)
 Is this a managed care plan in which you can save money by going to in-
network doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies? Is it worth it to you to see
MS specialists who aren’t in the network? Do you know exactly how the
referral system works and how much more expensive it may be to use
specialists that aren’t in the network?
 Is there a waiting period before a qualified individual is covered? Is there
a period of time during which your MS or other preexisting condition
will not be covered? If yes, how long?
 How much is the annual deductible? Is it for each family member 
separately, or for the whole family in combination? Is there a separate
deductible for prescription drugs, mental health benefits, or other 
services?
 How much of the cost of covered services (co-insurance percentage) do
you have to pay after the deductible has been met? Is there a fixed dollar
amount (co-payment) for services such as doctor visits?
 What are the renewal conditions? Under what circumstances can your
health plan (or employer or union) increase your premium?
 Is there a stop loss provision that limits the amount of your out-of-pocket
expenses? If yes, what’s the maximum out-of-pocket amount you would
have to pay for the deductible, co-insurance, and co-payments per year
before the plan begins picking up the full tab?
 Is there a maximum amount that the health plan will pay while you’re eli-
gible for coverage (or in your lifetime)?
 What services, medical equipment, and supplies does the plan cover?
You may want to check out things like physical therapy, occupational
therapy, mobility aids, catheters, and so on.
 What’s the prescription drug benefit? Are there tiers of drugs that
require different co-insurance or co-pay amounts (as is happening
increasingly with the approved disease-modifying medications)? Are all
of your medications included in the formulary?
 Does the health plan have arrangements with a mail-order pharmacy or
medical equipment supplier that could save you money?
291
Chapter 19: Getting a Grip on Insurance

 What isn’t covered by the policy? For example, what are the limits on
• Your choice of hospital and the number of covered hospital days?
Are other hospital expenses covered?
• The amount paid for doctor visits, including in-network and out-of-
network doctors?
• The number of visits or the amount of annual coverage for mental
health benefits?
Filing Successful Insurance Appeals
It turns out that it isn’t enough to know how to get and keep your health
insurance — you also need to know how to file an appeal if your insurance
plan refuses to pay for something your doctor has prescribed for you —
which can happen with a lot with the medications and services that are used
to manage MS. Many people don’t pursue their right to appeal because they
don’t think they can win. But the fact is, when done properly, over 50 percent
of appeals are successful. So, in this section, we show you the steps to take.
Step 1: Check your coverage
Start by reexamining your health plan manual to make sure that what you
thought would be covered actually is. If the service (such as physical or
occupational therapy) or treatment (such as injectable medication) you need
is specifically excluded by your policy, the chances of winning coverage for it
on appeal are slim to none. If the policy doesn’t specifically exclude it, how-
ever, it’s definitely to your advantage to try the appeals process.
Step 2: Confirm why coverage was 
denied or was less than expected
Carefully review the explanation of benefits form — the insurance company’s
official response to your claim — to see why coverage was denied or is being
reimbursed for less than the cost. These explanations often appear as codes,
with explanatory notes at the bottom of the page or on the back. If the prob-
lem requires a simple fix, such as correcting a code number or supplying a bit
of missing information, make the change and resubmit your claim to the
same place you or your doctor sent it originally. If everything’s in order on
the claim, and they’re still denying coverage, your next step is to appeal.
292
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

Step 3: File an appeal
To give yourself the best chance at success, study your plan’s appeal proce-
dures (sometimes found in the section on grievances and appeals in your plan
manual). It’s important to follow these procedures carefully — especially the
deadlines. Here are some basic guidelines:
 Write a clear and simple letter. Give the facts and a concise explanation
of why you believe your claim should be paid. This letter should be no
more than one page.
Be sure to include your insurance ID number, the specific claim number
(if applicable), the name and contact information of your healthcare
provider, and the date of service (if applicable).
 Keep detailed records. Health insurance policies and anything else that
the insurance companies give you in writing are legal documents — so
hang on to them.
Also, keep detailed notes about all interactions with your insurer, includ-
ing dates and names of company representatives you speak with on the
phone. Save copies of claims and bills, appeal letters and any attach-
ments, and other relevant communications.
 Follow up. If your appeal is denied, go to the next level of appeal —
don’t assume that this happens automatically. The second appeal will
still be an internal appeal, but it will involve a reconsideration of your
original claim among a higher level of professionals within your plan.
If your second appeal is denied, you may be eligible for an external
review of your claim by a panel of health professionals who have no affil-
iation to your health plan. Contact your state department of insurance
to ask about any external appeal rights you may have in your state.
 Discuss your appeal with your healthcare provider. If the dispute is over
the medical necessity of a treatment, your physician’s input in the form of
a letter that includes studies demonstrating the treatment’s benefit will be
invaluable. Make sure that your healthcare providers have a copy of your
appeal letter on file. Be sure to let them know about the National MS
Society’s publication Health Insurance Appeal Letters: A Toolkit for
Clinicians at www.nationalmssociety.org/appealletters.
Replacing Your Income with 
Disability Insurance
Whereas health insurance helps pay for your healthcare costs, disability
insurance helps replace your income if you become too disabled to earn 
a living. You can purchase disability insurance on your own. Or, some
293
Chapter 19: Getting a Grip on Insurance

employers offer disability insurance (through a commercial insurance com-
pany) to their employees as a benefit. In addition to this type of commercial
insurance, the Federal government provides public disability insurance
through programs administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA).
These programs are financed via the taxes paid by workers and employers.
Commercial and public disability plans define “disability” differently (the fol-
lowing sections explain the differences). Both, however, put the burden of
proving your disability on you and your doctor.
Commercial disability insurance
Commercial disability insurance (as distinguished from public disability insur-
ance) is available through some employers or may be purchased privately to
protect you in the event that you become unable to continue in your current
job because of a disability. Because every commercial disability policy is a
contract, the definition of “disability” can vary a lot depending on the terms
of that contract. So, don’t make any assumptions about your coverage. Take
the time to familiarize yourself with your policy’s definitions and conditions
early on — well before you ever consider filing a claim.
After you’ve been diagnosed with MS (or a variety of other conditions, includ-
ing common problems such as lower back pain), it can be difficult (if not
impossible) to qualify for commercial disability insurance. Employers can’t
deny it, but the insurance companies may not be willing to take you on. If you
decide to try and buy it on your own, it may help to work through an insur-
ance broker or to speak with someone in the underwriting department
(rather than the sales department) of an insurance company because the
underwriting folks are less likely than the sales folks to turn you down out-
right. If you’ve already been diagnosed, the chances of approval will probably
depend on how well you’re doing when you apply.
Never lie about your medical condition or history on an application for insur-
ance! Don’t volunteer anything you aren’t asked for, but don’t commit fraud
by providing inaccurate information — doing so will seriously jeopardize
your ability to buy any type of insurance ever again.
Even if you have commercial disability insurance, you can still apply for ben-
efits from SSA (see the following section “Public disability insurance: SSDI”).
In fact, commercial insurers are eager to transition disabled policyholders
into Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and are likely to require you to
file the application.

Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

Public disability insurance: SSDI
The main public disability insurance you need to be aware of is Social
Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). SSDI pays benefits to you and certain
members of your family if you’re insured, meaning that you worked and paid
Social Security taxes for a sufficient period of time.
The eligibility criteria for SSDI are clearly defined in the law, and this program
is strictly for those who are unable to be gainfully employed because of a
physical or mental impairment that lasts at least 12 months. An impairment
isn’t simply a diagnosis of a disease or condition; it’s a measure of how
impaired one is as a result of that disease or condition. Check out the SSA
Web site at www.ssa.gov for lots of helpful information about the eligibility
criteria and the application process.
If you’re considering applying for SSDI benefits, review the eligible MS-related
impairments (vision, walking, and cognitive problems, and fatigue) carefully
and honestly with your doctor to make sure that you’re in agreement about
which may apply to you. To help with this discussion, take a look at the SSDI
toolkit on the National MS Society Web site at www.nationalmssociety.
org/socialsecurity.asp. The components of the kit will help you under-
stand the application process and the criteria used by the SSA. The kit also
provides you and your doctor with the information and template letters you
need to file an effective application.
The SSA will notify you in writing when you’ve been deemed disabled, and it
will provide the exact start date of the disability. Beginning with that start
date, you’ll have a waiting period of five months until the payment of benefits
begins. Make sure you factor this waiting time into your personal financial
plans.
Twenty-four months after your SSDI benefits begin (29 months after the onset
of disability) you’ll automatically qualify for Medicare. Contact Medicare at
www.medicare.gov or at (800) MEDICARE (800-633-4227) if you don’t
receive information regarding the program before your 29th month of disabil-
ity. The move to Medicare coverage (from your group insurance plan or from
COBRA) is another critically important transition period for your personal
financial planning because you’ll need to make important decisions about
your coverage, including your prescription drug plan. (Check out the section
“Continuing coverage with COBRA” earlier in the chapter for more info.)
People with disabilities who gain eligibility for Medicare when they’re under
65 must make all the same choices about their Medicare benefits as those
who retire into the program. So, if this is you, go to www.medicare.gov and
click on “Compare Medicare Prescription Drug Plans” to get started. And
295

don’t hesitate to contact the National MS Society by calling (800) FIGHT-MS
(800-344-4867) if you need to consult with someone about your options.
Finally, it’s good to know that Social Security Administration offers incentives
to people who think they may want to try returning to the workforce. You can
return to work on a trial basis (referred to as a trial work period) without
jeopardizing your eligibility for benefits. Check out more information about
SSA’s work incentives at www.ssa.gov/work.
A Brief Word about Life and 
Long-Term Care Insurance
Life insurance, which is designed to help support your family in the case of
your death, is sold exclusively through the commercial marketplace. The
commercial marketplace includes many financial institutions and commercial
insurers. Even though many employers offer life insurance as an elective ben-
efit to their employees, they aren’t required to. A diagnosis of MS generally
doesn’t disqualify a person from obtaining life insurance, but it may jack up
your premiums a bit or result in some limitations to your coverage.
Many people use their life insurance as a tool for planning their personal and
family finances. It’s a good idea to talk this over with an experienced financial
planner to figure out how to put your insurance policies to work for you. Call
the National MS Society (800-FIGHT-MS) to obtain free financial education and
advice services through the Society’s partnership with the Society of
Financial Service Professionals. (Check out Chapter 20 for more details on
planning for a life with MS.)
Long-term care insurance, which helps pay for home healthcare and nursing
home care, generally isn’t available for anyone who has already been diag-
nosed with MS. However, your family members may want to look into this
type of coverage for themselves — either through their employer or with a
private insurance company.

Chapter 20
Planning for a Future with MS
In This Chapter
 Planning for the unpredictability of MS
 Studying the present and looking into the future
 Making sound financial decisions
E
ven though you may not think of yourself as a big-time gambler, chances
are you’ve bet on quite a few things in your life. You may bet that good
things will happen — by buying a lottery ticket, for example. Or, you may bet
that bad things will happen — by buying car insurance, life insurance, or lia-
bility insurance. And all this betting is normal for just about anyone. But,
when you throw in multiple sclerosis (MS), you now have one more wild card
to contend with. Whether you’re into betting or not, the fact is that life with
MS is a bit of a crapshoot. The only surefire bet for anyone living with MS is
that the future is unpredictable.
So, in this chapter, we talk about ways to look that unpredictability in the eye
and figure out how to plan for it — financially and otherwise. We also explain
how to assess your current situation so that you can anticipate the kinds of
challenges or changes that could arise in the future. With this groundwork
laid, you can begin to construct a safety net for yourself and your family.
Preparing for the Worst While 
Hoping for the Best
Encouraging folks to plan for the worst is a hard sell. Who, after all, wants to
spend time thinking about all the yucky things that can happen in life? Some
people even think that it’s bad luck — they believe that planning for those
things may make them happen. Other people don’t want to “waste” the good
times worrying about possible bad times. And people with MS often say that
they don’t want to give any more time, energy, or thought to MS than they
absolutely have to. They say “We’ll deal with that problem (disease progres-
sion, disability, job change, and so on) if and when we need to.”

In this section, we’re going to try and sell you on the idea that careful plan-
ning is one of the best gifts that you can give yourself and your family. If you
gear up to deal with whatever challenges MS can bring, and then find down
the road that your MS has actually remained pretty stable and manageable,
you haven’t lost anything except some planning time. But, if you lay down
some plans and the disease progresses enough to interfere with your life in a
significant way, you’ll already have some safety nets in place to meet the
challenges head on.
Facing those scary “what-ifs?”
When you heard the words, “You have MS” from your doctor, you may have
had some scary thoughts: “What if I end up in a wheelchair?” “What if I can’t
work?” or “What if my vision doesn’t clear up?” It turns out that most people
have one or two what-ifs that scare them more than anything else, and with
human nature being what it is, those are exactly the things they don’t want to
spend time thinking about.
The best way to deal with the stuff that scares you the most is to take the
time to think about what you would do if those scary things actually hap-
pened. Formulating a strategy — by consulting with the experts, identifying
helpful resources, and developing a contingency plan — helps you feel pre-
pared. And when you feel prepared, you can worry less about the future and
enjoy the present more.
So if, for example, you’re worried that your MS symptoms will interfere with
your ability to stay employed, now is the time to meet with a vocational
counselor or occupational therapist to figure out what kinds of accommoda-
tions in the workplace may help you stay on the job or what other kinds of
work you may be able to do. It’s also the perfect time to meet with a financial
planner to talk about what you can begin doing now to protect your financial
security down the road.
Taking charge of your future
In spite of the unpredictability of MS, you can do a lot to feel prepared.
Because MS is so variable from one person to the next, and people’s life cir-
cumstances are so different, no one-size-fits-all solutions exist. But, the
process involved in developing a safety net is basically the same for 
everyone.
298
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

When you’re ready to take charge of your future, follow these steps:
1. Take the time to learn about the ways MS can change over time.
For example, even though MS is an unpredictable disease, it’s helpful for
your planning purposes to know that the majority of people who are
diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS transition to a more progressive
course within twenty-five years. (Check out Chapter 1 for more details
on the course of MS.)
2. Let yourself think ahead (even if it’s scary).
Even though a head-in-the-sand approach may feel more comfortable, it
won’t serve you well in the long run. But, thinking ahead about ways
that MS may affect your lifestyle can help keep you one step ahead if and
when you experience major changes.
3. Ask the right questions of the right people.
You don’t have to figure everything out alone. Legal, vocational, and
financial experts can help you get your thoughts in order. Share your
concerns about employment and your financial future — whatever they
may be — and let these folks guide you.
4. Develop the plan that feels right for you.
Even with input from all the experts, you’re the only one who can decide
exactly what’s right for you. So, gather all the information you can, and
then take whatever steps you need to in order to feel prepared —
whether that means increasing your savings, requesting accommoda-
tions in the workplace, or training for a different kind of career.

5. Take steps now to begin putting the plan into action.
At this stage, you bravely forge ahead, bringing your plan to life. Acting
on your plan will help you feel stronger and more prepared no matter
what MS brings your way.
6. Go on with your life.
We want smart planning to be part of your life, but we certainly don’t
want it to be the most important part. Don’t get so wrapped up in plan-
ning for your future that you forget to live your life and enjoy the present.
Navigating the Planning Process: 
It’s as Easy as One, Two, Three
Financial planning is all about figuring out how to pay the piper — now and in
the years to come. It’s designed to ensure that you have adequate resources
to meet your present needs as well as any needs you anticipate down the
road. So, successful planning depends on your anticipation of as many of
your future needs as possible.
The planning process starts with the following three basic questions — and
your answers to these questions form the basis for your plan:
 Where are you now?
 What might the future bring?
 What can you do now to be ready?
These questions may seem daunting, especially when your MS is acting par-
ticularly unpredictable. So, in the following sections, we go over each of
these questions in detail.
Where are you now?
It’s inventory time — but don’t worry, it’s not as difficult as it sounds. The
key areas to focus on include your health, finances, insurance coverage,
employment situation, and family life. Taking this kind of inventory allows
you to step back and take a look at the big picture of your life, with an eye to
how these five important areas may interact in the years ahead and how you
may tweak the picture to meet your future needs.
300
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

Taking a look at your health
Your health is about more than just your MS. So, when you review your cur-
rent situation, remember to take into account your overall health and fitness
as well as what’s going on with your MS. For example, ask yourself if you’re
up-to-date with the health screening exams for people your age. Also, keeping
in mind that like everyone else, people with MS are likely to die of heart dis-
ease, cancer, and stroke, ask yourself about your risk factors: Do you have a
family history of any of these health problems? Are you overweight? Do you
smoke? Do you exercise regularly and eat a balanced diet? (Take a look at
Chapter 11 for more info about wellness strategies.)
When it comes to surveying your MS, ask yourself whether your disease
course is active or stable (your doctor can help you answer this one if you
aren’t sure), and whether you’re following the doctor’s recommendations for
slowing disease progression and managing your symptoms. Even though it
isn’t the most fun thing to do, take the time to think about how your symp-
toms are affecting your everyday activities. For example, are things feeling
pretty manageable at the moment, or not? If the answer is no, be sure to talk
that over with your doctor to see what other strategies may be helpful.
Checking out your finances
As you can imagine, when you have an unpredictable disease like MS, taking
a long, hard look at your financial health is important. Even though you don’t
want to think about it now, your medical bills may end up rising later due to
disease progression (or you may need to hire extra help), and so you want to
be prepared financially for whatever happens.
When you’re checking out your finances, be sure to include the plus column
and the minus column. You can do this in a variety of ways — by writing lists
of your sources of income and expenses, by keeping a daily journal of monies
coming in and monies going out, or by filling out a loan application (by the
time you fill in all those blanks, you’ll know your situation pretty well!). Just
keep in mind that it always feels better to start with the plus column. Here
are the specifics you should consider:
 Sources of income: These incoming sources can include income, assets,
all forms of financial support (including child support and alimony), VA
benefits, interest and dividends, food stamps, public assistance, rental
income, life insurance policies, employee benefits, and anything else you
can think of.
 Expenses: These outgoing sources can include housing, food, trans-
portation, utilities, clothing, loans, mortgages, car payments, interest on
credit balances, employer deductions, alimony, property taxes, insur-
ances, medical care, prescriptions, rehab, personal assistance, and any-
thing else that drains the coffers.
301
Chapter 20: Planning for a Future with MS

You may consider getting a credit report from one of the three credit report-
ing agencies — Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion — to see where you stand.
You’re entitled to one free report per year from each of these agencies. Check
out www.annualcreditreport.com, which is the central Web site that the
three companies created so that the public can easily request free reports.
Reviewing your insurance coverage
Having good health insurance coverage is important for the average person,
but for someone who has a long-term disease, it’s even more important
because things can get costly. So, for the purposes of financial planning, the
important thing is to figure out the costs associated with the coverage you
have. For example:
 Review your health insurance plan to see exactly what it does and 
doesn’t cover, keeping in mind that non-covered expenses end up
coming out of your pocket.
 Calculate what you’re paying now for premiums, co-pays, co-insurance,
deductibles, prescription coverage, and any other associated expenses.
When you figure this number into your health-related expenses, keep in
mind that costs can vary significantly from year to year.
 If your employer offers more than one health plan, take the time to com-
pare them, keeping in mind that the plan with the lowest premium is
likely to give you higher out-of-pocket expenses down the road. And if
you chose your current plan before your MS diagnosis, check to see if
it’s still the most appropriate one for you in terms of what it covers, the
doctors you see, and the medications you take.
 If your insurance comes through your employer (or your partner’s
employer), check to see if it’s a fully insured or self-insured plan — the
difference can have some financial implications.
With a self-insured plan, your employer acts as the insurance company
and doesn’t have to follow any state regulations — which means that you
have to go to court to fight any unfavorable decisions. A fully insured pro-
gram, which the employer purchases from an insurance company, pro-
vides greater consumer protection because it’s regulated by the state.
With this kind of plan, you can request an independent review by the state
if you have an unsuccessful appeal concerning your coverage. About 60
percent of people with employer-based coverage have self-insured plans.
 Check out whether you have any disability insurance through your
employer. It turns out that most people think they have it but they actu-
ally don’t. Remember that after you’ve been diagnosed with MS, chances
are you won’t be able to purchase a new policy.
If you’re fortunate enough to have disability coverage, read the find
print to find out how it defines disability, how much it pays and for how
long, and how long you have to wait for it to kick in after you’ve filed for
it. And check to see if you’re allowed to do any kind of work when you’re
receiving benefits.
302
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

Getting a handle on insurance coverage now — before you run into any kind
of crisis, is a critical piece of your financial safety net. Check out Chapter 19
for detailed information about insurance coverage — how to get it and how
to keep it.
Scoping out your employment situation
Employment equals income for most people — so it’s definitely in your best
interest to take a hard look at your current work situation. The key to good
planning is to ask yourself some difficult, but important, questions:
 Is your job stable? Are there mergers or layoffs in the offing? Is a new
boss coming in who’s likely to clear the ranks? Is the company in good
financial shape? Have your recent performance reviews been positive?
 What’s happening with your MS? Is your MS behaving lately? Is it pretty
stable? Are your symptoms pretty much under control? Do you feel
pretty good?
 How’s your job performance? Are you performing up to snuff? Are you
able to handle the essential functions of your job? Do the symptoms you
have interfere with the kind of work you do? Do you need some accom-
modations to help you function at your best — and if so, have you
already asked for them?
This is no time to be a cockeyed optimist (optimist, yes; cockeyed optimist,
no). Providing honest answers to these questions will help you do whatever
you need to do to stay productively employed for as long as you want and
are able to do so. Being honest with yourself will also help you plan effec-
tively if a change in your work situation is looming. (Check out Chapter 18 for
all the ins and outs of working with MS.)
What might the future bring?
By this point in the planning process you should have assessed your current
situation (see the section “Where are you now?” earlier in the chapter). Now
it’s time to bring out the crystal ball. You can’t predict the future, but you can
try to anticipate some of the changes or challenges that may crop up down the
road. And anticipating these changes can help you stay in control of your life.
Life changes
With or without MS, life is full of changes — some more expected than others.
Marriage, starting a family, moving to take a new job, caring for elderly par-
ents, getting a divorce, and going back to school for an advanced degree are
just a handful of those changes you can expect. As you develop your financial
plan, it’s important to take these kinds of changes into account and think
about how your MS fits into the picture. For example, are there any changes
you would like to make sooner rather than later — such as returning to school
303
Chapter 20: Planning for a Future with MS

or having a child — because of concerns about your MS progressing? Or does
your partner need to alter his or her career plans based on the possibility that
you may not be able to remain in the workforce as long as you planned?
Changes in your MS
We talk a lot in this book about how unpredictable MS can be. Nevertheless,
an important part of good planning is letting yourself think about the changes
that might happen.
For instance, your symptoms may continue to be more annoying than 
disabling — requiring only minor tweaks in the way you do things. Or, you
may find that you need a mobility aid, additional medications, or some help
from the rehab team to keep yourself functioning at your best (take a look at
Chapter 7 for more information about rehabilitation strategies to manage
your MS). Sometimes, though, MS symptoms can have a greater impact that
calls for some heavy-duty help — perhaps some personal assistance with
your care, modifications to your home or car, a motorized scooter or wheel-
chair, or whatever else it takes for you to stay active and comfortable.
All of these modifications have financial implications that are important to
keep in mind as you try to create a financial safety net for yourself and your
family. A motorized scooter, for example, can be quite expensive, so you may
want to check how much of the cost would be covered by your insurance.
Also, your insurance plan may cover some of the MS medications and not
others, or cover physical therapy services but not those provided by an occu-
pational therapist. You may consider building a medical savings account for
yourself to help pay for some of the extras that your insurance doesn’t cover.
Employment changes
Changes in your employment situation may be planned or unplanned, posi-
tive or negative — but they all need to be taken into account when you plan
for the future. If you or a family member retire from the workforce or cut
down on your hours, your income inevitably goes down. On the other hand, a
promotion for you or your partner can add a big chunk to the plus column.
Also, if your MS progresses to the point that you’re unable to work — even
with the job accommodations we talk about in Chapter 18 — your disability
retirement income is likely to be lower than your current salary. Private dis-
ability insurance generally only covers a portion of your current income.
Social Security Disability Insurance payments are also significantly lower
than your current salary. Anticipating the possibility of this kind of change in
your finances can help you plan for it more effectively.
Financial changes
Your financial situation can change in either direction for many reasons.
Windfalls happen and so do unexpected problems. For example, your incom-
ing funds could get a hefty boost from Aunt Bertha’s will or from the piece of
304
Part V: Creating Your Safety Nets 

property your parents left to you and your sibs. Or, you may pay off the car
loan, send in your last mortgage check, or finally get that last kid through col-
lege. Any of these would significantly up your disposable income. Of course,
losing child support or alimony or buying a new car or house could signifi-
cantly zap your disposable income.
Unanticipated expenses are obviously the real challenge. The best strategy,
then, is to assume that you’ll have some of these unexpected expenses, and
then you can try to build in enough give in your budget to absorb them. Here
are some expenses you can plan for (even if they never actually happen):
 Home modifications to stay as active as you want to be: These modifi-
cations, such as widening doorways for wheelchair access or building a
ramp, can be costly, but they’re worth their weight in gold.
Remember, however, that many state vocational rehabilitation services
will cover the cost of home modifications that make it possible for you
to remain in the workforce, so be sure to call the National MS Society
(800-FIGHT-MS or 800-344-4867) for the names and numbers of people to
contact in your state.
 Medical treatments or wellness interventions that aren’t covered by
your insurance plan: As you can imagine, these out-of-pocket expenses
can also pack a wallop. Your insurance company, for example, may deny
coverage for your physical therapy visits or the massages that are so
helpful for your spasticity (stiffness). Or, you may want to join a gym or
exercise class to help reduce your fatigue or build your endurance. Even
though these costs are related to your MS, they, too, would likely come
from your own pocket.
Changes in your insurance coverage
Insurance is a moving target these days — the industry is changing so rapidly
that it’s often difficult to keep up. Companies can change the benefits they
offer, increase their co-pays or co-insurance amounts, and fiddle with their
formularies (the list of drugs they cover). And your employer can raise your
portion of the premium from year to year. Even worse, some employers are
now pulling back from providing insurance coverage altogether, or they’re
providing such bare-bones coverage that you’re pretty much on your own.
(Check out Chapter 19 for more information about how to maximize and pro-
tect your health insurance coverage.) We encourage you to read your insur-
ance plan carefully, as well as any updates provided by your employer or the
insurance company, in order to avoid too many unpleasant surprises.
Changes in your family
In addition to trying to anticipate changes within your immediate family —
such as having children and saving for their college education — it’s impor-
tant to think about whether your extended family is available to help you in
the future. In the old days, people could pretty much count on assistance
from family members if the need arose because family members usually lived
305
Chapter 20: Planning for a Future with MS

close together and more women stayed home to raise their children. Today,
families are more spread out, with many couples relying on two incomes just
to get by. And their own life changes — new babies, retirement, illness,
returning to the workforce — may make it impossible for relatives to assist
you with your own life changes. This means that any help you may need
down the road may have to be hired from the community, which obviously
would be an added expense (whether you planned for it or not).
What can you do now to be ready?
After you’ve surveyed your current situation and you’ve looked into the
future to see what changes may happen, it’s time to begin the actual planning
process by talking to the right people and gathering all the information you
need. Like other complex issues related to your life with MS, you don’t have
to do this alone.
Talking to the right people
The most important piece of advice we can give you regarding the actual
planning process is to get your guidance from the experts. Even though you
can — and should — get input from your friends and family, your best help
will come from the professionals who have a working knowledge of the
rights and protections that are available to folks with chronic illnesses or
disabilities.
The folks you may need to get in touch with include the following:
 Financial planners: These professionals help people set financial goals
and then figure out how to meet them. The goals may include invest-
ments, tax planning, asset protection, retirement planning, and estate
planning. It’s never too early to have a chat with one of these folks. You
can go to the Web site of the Certified Financial Planner Board of
Standards (www.cfp.net) to see a listing of certified financial planners
in your area or to determine if your accountant is a certified financial
planner. Or, you can call the National MS Society (800-FIGHT-MS) to find
out more about the free financial education and advice offered through
Financial Education Partners, a collaborative program with the Society
of Financial Service Professionals.
 Accountants: Your accountant knows how to help you get the best
return for your money. He or she may be able to inform you if you’re
overlooking certain tax deductions that you could be taking because of
your disability. Or, he or she may be able to show you ways to use the
equity in your house to generate some needed funds. If you have no dis-
ability insurance, the accountant may also be able to advise ways to
invest some money now that would provide the same kind of benefits
later on.

 Elder law attorneys: These attorneys specialize in legal issues affecting
the elderly and people with disabilities. They’re particularly skilled in
public benefits, such as Medicaid and Medicare (see Chapter 19), but
they also can help with wills, trusts, long-term care planning, and estate
planning. Find an attorney in your area who’s certified by the Board of
Certification of the National Elder Law Foundation (NELF), by going to
www.nelf.org/findcela.asp.
 Social Security attorneys: These professionals specialize in helping
people obtain Social Security Disability Insurance (for those who have
worked and paid Social Security taxes) and Supplemental Security Income
(for those with little or no income) if and when they need it. The primary
resource for these specialists is the National Organization of Social
Security Claimant Representatives (NOSSCR). You can contact the
NOSSCR referral service at 800-431-2804 during East Coast business hours.
 Care managers: These experts navigate the health and social service
systems, and they know the eligibility requirements for available ser-
vices. They’re the perfect matchmakers — they help you get the care
and services you need. Care managers are typically social workers or
nurses (hint: they usually have the initials CMC or CCM after their
name). The National MS Society can refer you to a professional care
manager in your area. To contact the Society, call (800) FIGHT-MS.
 Credit counselors: A credit counselor can help you if you have accumu-
lated significant debt and need assistance regaining sound financial foot-
ing. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling is a nonprofit
organization with member agencies around the country. You can talk
with a credit counselor in your area by calling (800) 388-2227.
In addition to tapping the right professionals, it’s important to keep the commu-
nication lines open with your family members. Some (or all of you) may shy
away from discussions about the future, but, in the end, the best way to relieve
everyone’s anxieties is to get them out in the open. Talking over what you would
do if the MS progressed to the point that more day-to-day help was required is a
good place to start. If getting this kind of conversation going proves to be a 
challenge, think about sitting down with a family counselor to jump-start the
process. (Flip to Chapter 15 for more details on making MS a part of the family.)
Maximizing your employment options
Now’s the time to make sure that you have all of your ducks in a row at work.
Check out Chapter 18 for recommendations on how to maximize your pro-
ductivity on the job and maintain your place in the workforce as long as
you’re willing and able to. If you haven’t already taken the time to review
your job situation (your current performance, the impact of any MS symp-
toms you’re having, the kinds of accommodations that may help you function
more comfortably and effectively, and the short-term disability and leave
options that are available at your job), don’t put it off. Too many people wait
until their job is in jeopardy before trying to take steps to protect it — and by
that time, it’s often too late.

Chapter 20: Planning for a Future with MS

Becoming familiar with the appropriate laws and regulations
To plan effectively, you need to be aware of the laws and regulations that
exist to protect you. We talk about them in more detail in the chapters on
employment (Chapter 18) and insurance (Chapter 19), but here they are in
one tidy list:
 The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): This act provides rights
and protections that help people with disabilities stay employed and
involved in the community.
 COBRA: These health benefit provisions from the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 help people maintain health
insurance when they leave their jobs and lose their job-related health
benefits.
 HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): This act
prohibits employers who provide health coverage from discriminating
against an employee because of a preexisting condition (a health problem
he or she had before the current coverage began).
 The Olmstead Decision: This legislation, which was approved by the
Supreme Court, makes it a requirement for states to provide home- and
community-based services to help people with disabilities remain in
their homes and their communities.
Now is as good a time as any to check out these important laws and regula-
tions to see how they may benefit you in the future, if the need arises. It’s
always better to become familiar with them before you hit a bump in the road
than when you’re smack in the middle of a crisis.

myths that you want to toss out as quickly as possible,
and ten suggestions for how to globe-trot with comfort

Chapter 21
Ten Must-Do’s for Living with MS
In This Chapter
 Gathering information about MS
 Taking the best possible care of yourself
N
o one asks to be diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) and no one’s
happy when it happens. But long gone are the days when a person
could do nothing but “go home and learn to live with it.” No matter what
you’ve heard elsewhere, you can live a full and satisfying life with MS, and
this chapter gives you the top ten strategies for doing just that.
Educate Yourself about MS
Information can help put you in the driver’s seat. Armed with accurate info
about MS, you’ll feel more in control and more prepared to be an active part-
ner in your care. Because doctors still haven’t found a cure for MS, managing
it involves a lot of choices (check out Part II for details on managing your
MS). And informed choices are better choices.
MS information is available from lots of sources — of which some are better
than others — so pick carefully! The best information sources are your
healthcare team (flip to Chapter 4 to find out how to create your team), the
National MS Society and other MS organizations, and government Web sites
(take a look Appendix B for additional resources). And don’t forget this 
book — it’s chock-full of information. Just check out the table of contents or
the index to find the topic you’re interested in. The pharmaceutical compa-
nies that manufacture the MS medications also provide excellent information,
but it’s important to be able to distinguish the marketing messages from the
educational messages. Because the Internet is a mixed bag of good and bad
info, be sure to check stuff out with your healthcare team.

Work with Your Neurologist
MS is a long-term disease that requires an ongoing partnership with your neu-
rologist. So, it’s well worth the effort to find a doctor you trust, respect, and
can talk to. See your neurologist at least once a year and come prepared with
plenty of information: Your input — how you feel and the symptoms you’ve
been having — is essential to effective treatment planning (Chapter 5 gives
you tips on creating a mastery plan). For a list of ways to make the most of
your partnership with your MS doctor, check out the Cheat Sheet at the
beginning of the book.
Start Treatment Early
If you’ve been diagnosed with a relapsing form of MS — or your doctor
believes that you’re heading in that direction — you may be a perfect candi-
date for one of the approved disease-modifying therapies (see Chapter 6).
Irreversible nerve damage can occur early in the disease course, so getting
on treatment early is the best way to head off some of that damage. If you
aren’t a candidate for one of these therapies, you still have many options to
feel better and manage your symptoms (see Part II for management tips).
Make MS a Part of the Family
When one person in a family gets MS, the whole family lives with it. So, edu-
cation for family members — including kids — is important. And learning
how to communicate comfortably and openly about the disease and how it
affects all of you will make it a lot easier to plan, problem-solve, and support
one another (flip to Chapter 15 for more on these family matters).
Voluntary health organizations like the National MS Society (www.national
mssociety.org) and the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (www.
msaa.com) have educational materials and programs for every member of
the family. The Multiple Sclerosis International Federation even has informa-
tion about MS in six languages (www.msif.org). And if you need help start-
ing the family powwow, call the National MS Society at (800) FIGHT-MS
(800-344-4867) for a referral to a family counselor to get the ball rolling.
312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Develop Your Support Network
In spite of how alone you may have felt when you first heard your diagnosis,
you don’t have to deal with it on your own. It’s never too early to start build-
ing your support system — beginning with your healthcare team and close
family and friends, and gradually branching out into your community. You’ll
be amazed at all the resources that are available to help you. Call the
National MS Society at (800) FIGHT-MS for the names of MS specialists and
the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America at (800) 532-7667 for info about
their support programs and services. As you reach out to others, be ready to
let them know how they can help — most people are more than willing to
pitch in when they know what you need.
Plan for the Future
MS is an unpredictable disease — and this unpredictability is what tends to
scare folks the most. The best way to deal with uncertainty is to plan for it —
financially, vocationally, and any other way you can think of. As it turns out,
planning for the best doesn’t prepare you for much of anything because the
best hardly ever happens in life. Planning for the worst, however, helps you
feel more prepared and less vulnerable no matter what comes along. Check
out Part V for three helpful chapters regarding how to prepare for the future.
Planning doesn’t have to be a downer. Wise planning can help you pursue
your goals with confidence and optimism — without having to focus too
much attention on your MS.
Feel Healthy and Well
Despite popular belief, you can actually be healthy with MS. And the health-
ier you are, the better you’re going to feel no matter how your MS is behav-
ing. So, don’t let MS hog all your attention.
Because having MS doesn’t protect you from other medical problems (see
Chapter 11), it’s important to protect your health with a balanced diet, regu-
lar exercise, and periodic medical and dental checkups (your neurologist
won’t be worrying about your heart, lungs, or gums, or reminding you to get
a Pap smear or a mammogram). You also need to find healthy ways to
manage the unavoidable stresses of daily life (see Chapter 12). If you find it
difficult to do all these healthy things for yourself, don’t panic. Whatever you
eat, drink, or do, you’re not going to make your MS get worse. And keeping
active isn’t going to make your MS worse either — your body will let you
know if you need to take a rest or cool down — so enjoy yourself.
313
Chapter 21: Ten Must-Do’s for Living with MS

Create Your Tool Chest
The key to keeping MS from getting in your way is to figure out strategies to
work around it. When problems with fatigue, vision, mobility, or any other MS
symptom interfere with your daily activities, your choice is to either give up
the activities or find some tools, mobility aids, or other gizmos to help you
get the job done (see Chapter 7 to check out some helpful devices).
Using tools doesn’t mean you’re giving in to MS. Instead, it means you’re fig-
uring out how to take charge of it. The more creative and flexible you’re will-
ing to be in the way you do things, the more things you’ll be able to do.
Monitor Your Mood
Depression is one of the most common and treatable symptoms of MS (check
out Chapter 9). In fact, you have at least a 50 percent chance of developing a
significant depression at some point along the way — and it can happen early
or late in the disease, regardless of what your physical symptoms may be.
Depression isn’t about being a wimp or a chicken. Depression is a part of this
disease just like any other symptom, which means it deserves to be treated.
Facing the challenges of MS is difficult enough without being depressed, so
talk to your doctor if you experience a significant change in your mood.
Counseling or antidepressant medication have both been shown to be effec-
tive in treating depressive symptoms.
Keep Your Sense of Humor Well-Oiled
MS certainly isn’t a laughing matter, but finding things to laugh about, and
people to laugh about them with are key to making peace with this disease.
For some, laughing about bladder or bowel symptoms, problems with think-
ing and memory, or wheelchairs can be difficult. But support groups and
Internet chat rooms are hotbeds of humor. Get a group of MS folks together
and you’ll quickly see that humor is part of the game plan for living with this
disease.
Being able to laugh about something has a way of taking the sting out of it,
which is the first step toward making the problem feel more manageable.

Chapter 22
Ten MS Myths Debunked
In This Chapter
 Ignoring the top ten MS myths
 Understanding that each person’s MS is unique
C
hances are that if you’ve heard about multiple sclerosis (MS) before, you
haven’t heard much that was good. In fact, you may have heard only
about wheelchairs, nursing homes, or even death — not a pretty picture. You
tend to hear more about the bad stuff because the good stuff isn’t as visible.
When people with MS are busy living their lives, other folks may not even
know that they have MS. So, just in case you’ve got some mistaken ideas
about what MS is and isn’t and what it does and doesn’t do, this chapter will
clear up some of the myths.
MS is Fatal
Maybe you’ve heard about someone who died from MS. The fact is that most
people with MS die from cancer, heart disease, and stroke — just like every-
one else. Statistically speaking, the MS life span is very close to normal. But,
of course, there are some situations that can shorten a person’s life, includ-
ing a very rare and rapidly progressive form of MS that leads to an early
death. Sometimes severe complications of MS, such as serious infections that
don’t respond to treatment, can eventually be fatal, too. And severe depres-
sion that isn’t treated can sometimes end in suicide. So, be sure to let your
doctor know about any big changes in your mood (see Chapter 9).
Everyone Eventually Needs a Wheelchair
Even though they may need to use a mobility device, such as a cane or
motorized scooter, to help with balance or fatigue, the fact is that two-thirds
of people with MS remain able to walk. Think of it this way:

 Approximately one-third of people with MS have a relatively mild disease
course with manageable symptoms and little or no disability.
 Approximately one-third of people have a moderate disease course with
more bothersome symptoms and a greater disability as time goes on.
 Approximately one-third of people experience a severe course that’s
significantly more disabling.
So, while most people with MS don’t need a wheelchair on a full-time basis,
doctors currently have no way to predict which path a person’s MS will take.
Because There’s No Cure, There’s Nothing
You Can Do about Your MS
True enough — there is no cure for MS yet. But, the good news is that over
the last 15 years, more progress has been made in the treatment of MS than
in all the time since the disease was described in 1868 by Jean-Martin
Charcot. MS treatment is now a package deal — complete with medications
to manage your relapses and the disease course (check out Chapter 6), reha-
bilitation strategies to keep you safe, active, and complication-free (check out
Chapter 7), and emotional support to help you sort it all out (check out
Chapter 9).
People with MS Can’t Handle Stress
After diagnosis, one of the first things you may hear from well-meaning family
members and friends, from some health professionals, and from info on the
Internet is that stress isn’t good for you. Even though it’s clear that too much
stress isn’t particularly good for anyone, the fact is that the relationship
between stress and MS just isn’t all that clear. Whatever the final conclusion
turns out to be, the bottom line is that life is stressful, so trying to rid your
life of stress can become a stressful and ultimately fruitless effort.
Before you rush to try and eliminate all the stresses from your life — particu-
larly a major activity such as employment (which also provides income and a
sense of accomplishment) take time to think through your decision. Being
unemployed isn’t exactly a stress-free bed of roses. We’d rather see you
figure out how to manage the stresses in your life more comfortably (see
Chapter 12) than to give up those things that give your life meaning, purpose,
and satisfaction (flip to Chapter 18 for info about MS and employment).
316
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

People with MS Shouldn’t Have Children
Fortunately, this myth is on the way out. Since about 1950, the research has
shown that men and women with MS can have healthy babies and happy
kids: MS doesn’t affect pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. And these
events, in turn, have no long-term effect on a woman’s level of disability. In
fact, the hormones of pregnancy offer some protection against MS relapses.
Even though children who have a parent with MS have a somewhat higher
risk of developing MS than other children, the risk remains fairly low. (Check
out Chapters 16 and 17 for some in-depth info about parenting with MS.)
“Natural” Treatments Are Safer
Don’t be seduced by advertising for “natural” treatments. Even though pre-
scription medications are strictly regulated in this country, dietary supple-
ments aren’t. For example, the manufacturer of a prescription medication
can’t make any claims about its product that haven’t been proven in rigorous
clinical trials, but the manufacturer of a supplement can make any claims it
wants — calling the supplement “safe,” “healthy,” “effective,” or anything else
to catch your eye and pocketbook. And, the fact that something comes from
nature doesn’t make it safe, non-toxic, or free of side effects. (Check out
Chapter 10 for more on supplements and other alternative treatments.)
No One Can Understand How You Feel
It’s certainly true that no one else is standing in your shoes. Given that every-
one’s MS is different, your experience is definitely your own. But, there are
lots of folks in the MS circle (in support groups, online, at the National MS
Society and other MS organizations, and on your healthcare team) who get it.
They understand the feelings of loss, anger, and anxiety that you live with, as
well as the challenges and frustrations that crop up every day. And they
understand the sense of accomplishment you feel when you overcome them.
The more you’re willing to share, the more understanding you’ll find in
others. Check out www.faceofms.org to hear people’s stories and share
your own if you choose.

Chapter 22: Ten MS Myths Debunked

Having a Relapse Means Your
Medication Isn’t Working
The available medications can’t cure MS or stop the disease in its tracks. This
means you’re likely to have some relapses (hopefully fewer) and experience
some disease progression (hopefully less) even though you’re faithfully
taking your medication.
Remember, having a relapse or some disease progression doesn’t mean that
the medication isn’t working or that you need to switch medications. You and
your doctor can decide together when and if it’s time to try something else.
Scientists Aren’t Making Any Progress
Actually, progress has never been faster! In the 1970s, scientists found new
and better ways to explore the workings of the immune system. In the early
1980s, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology gave doctors the first
“picture” of the damage done by MS to the brain and spinal cord. This amaz-
ing technology provides a bird’s-eye view of the underlying disease process
and a sensitive way to evaluate new treatments. Researchers are collaborating
on a hunt for MS genes. And the research into how damaged tissue in the cen-
tral nervous system may be repaired has moved into high gear. For a glimpse
of the exciting world of MS research, check out the work of The Myelin Project
(www.myelin.org), the Accelerated Cure Project (www.acceleratedcure.
org), and the Nancy Davis Center Without Walls (www.erasems.org) as well
as the National MS Society’s overview of progress in MS research at www.
nationalmssociety.org/researchprogress.
If You Can’t Walk, Your Life Is Over
For those who fear being unable to walk more than anything else in life, noth-
ing we say is likely to reassure you. But we’ve known countless men and
women who have stayed mobile, productive, adventurous, and involved
while sitting down. They work, play, travel, make love, make babies, and
make a life. If you want to be convinced, we urge you to meet some of those
folks for yourself — in support groups, at educational meetings, or in your
community — and get to know them. They may even tell you that it’s easier
to smell the roses when you’re a little bit closer to the ground.

Ten Tips for Trouble-Free Travel
In This Chapter
 Traveling confidently with MS
 Planning ahead
 Prepping for unforeseen troubles
T
he world is your oyster. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) travel all
over the world — on business, on vacation, and so on. They sightsee,
trek, snorkel, and go white-water rafting, and you can too. In this chapter, we
suggest ways to go where you want to go and do what you want to do when
you get there.
The key to your travel enjoyment is a readiness to be creative and flexible.
The more willing you are to adapt your activities to the demands of your MS,
the more places you’ll be able to go and the more fun that you’ll have.
Tap the Right Resources
Even though you may feel like an intrepid explorer the first time you venture
out on a long trip with your MS, remember that many, many others have gone
before you — so be sure to tap into their expertise. Here are some resources
to check out:
 Take a look at The Access-Able Travel Source (www.access-able.com)
for detailed information about traveling with a disability.
 Visit the National MS Society’s travel page (www.nationalmssociety.
org/travel) for additional resources and travel ideas.
 Check out the books There is Room at the Inn: Inns and B&Bs for Wheelers
and Slow Walkers, and Barrier-Free Travel: A Nuts and Bolts Guide for
Wheelers and Slow Walkers, both by Candy Harrington (Demos Medical
Publishing).

Calm Your Medical Concerns
Have a frank talk with your neurologist about any concerns you have regard-
ing your trip. Although very little of what happens with MS is a medical emer-
gency, you’ll feel more relaxed if you’ve talked about what to do and whom to
call if you have a relapse far from home. (See Chapter 6 for info about MS
relapses.)
Keep in mind that heat and overexertion can cause your symptoms to act up
temporarily, so take time to cool down and rest up before jumping to the con-
clusion that you’re having a true relapse. Infections can also kick your symp-
toms into high gear, so if you’re prone to urinary tract infections, ask your
doctor for a supply of medication to take with you just in case.
You’ll also feel reassured by having the name and phone number of a local
medical facility in your destination city or cities. Take a minute to join the
International Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers (www.iamat.
org). This nonprofit organization lists English-speaking doctors all over the
world.
Save Energy for the Fun Stuff
In addition to budgeting your money for a trip, it’s important to budget your
energy. Figure out how much you can comfortably do each day, leaving time
for rest breaks along the way. Don’t plan such a jam-packed trip that you get
exhausted just thinking about it. And most importantly, don’t stand when you
can sit or walk when you can ride. By making the best use of mobility aids,
you can conserve the energy you need to have fun (check out the Cheat
Sheet at the beginning of the book for more tips on saving your energy).
Check Ahead for Accessibility
Everyone defines accessibility differently. Your definition will depend on your
personal needs — do you need an elevator, air conditioning in your hotel
room, or a grab bar in the shower? Travel agents that specialize in accessible
travel know how to check whether a certain place or activity is accessible,
but they can’t do the detective work without knowing what your needs are.
So, take the time to think through exactly what you’re likely to need at every
step along the way. Of course, nothing is fail-safe, so prepare yourself for
some occasional creative problem-solving.
320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Rent Accessible Vehicles
In this day and age, you can rent just about anything anywhere. A knowledge-
able travel agent can help you find accessible equipment in cities all over the
world. For example, you may want to rent an RV (it’s great to have a bath-
room handy for long car trips!), a car with hand controls, a wheelchair-acces-
sible van, or a motorized scooter for gadding about. Just be sure to give your
agent plenty of notice and details about your specific needs.
Keep Your Cool
Getting overheated is one of the quickest ways to sap your energy and cause
your symptoms to act up. So try to schedule your trip for the coolest, least
humid seasons, and plan your activities during the early and later parts of
the day. Wear layers of lightweight, light-colored clothing and a head cover-
ing, and invest in a commercial cooling vest or bandanna that you can wear
when it’s really hot. Make the most of air conditioning and sip cold water
throughout the day.
Navigate Air Travel with Confidence
Air travel has become a lot more complicated for everyone, but you can do
several things to make it easier and more comfortable for yourself including
the following:
 Call the airline a few days ahead of time to let them know of any special
needs you may have.
 Pick your seat carefully by figuring how much legroom you need and
how close to the bathroom you want to be.
 If you have access to a computer, print out your boarding pass ahead of
time (most airlines make them available up to 24 hours prior to depar-
ture) to reduce waiting time at the airport and to guarantee your seat.
 Get to the airport early to allow for long security lines and to avoid
having to rush. And use curbside check-in to save your energy.
 Pack smart so the things you need to access easily are right on top, and
pack lightly so you aren’t lugging around more luggage than you need.
 If you check any mobility equipment, such as a motorized scooter, tag all
parts with your name and telephone number, and consider bringing the
manuals in case your equipment needs to be disassembled (and there-
fore reassembled).
321
Chapter 23: Ten Tips for Trouble-Free Travel

Safely Pack Your Prescriptions
Be sure to pack all of your medications in your carry-on bag, along with a
complete list of all your prescription and non-prescription drugs.
If you take an injectable medication, carry the vials and syringes in their orig-
inal package, complete with the prescription label so that the security guards
won’t confiscate it. A letter from your doctor isn’t good enough — you really
do need the prescription label. If any of your medications need to be refriger-
ated, make sure you have adequate packaging to protect them until you
arrive at your destination (and check ahead to make sure there’s a refrigera-
tor where you’re going). And don’t forget to bring along a safe used-needles
container.
Get Vaccinated
Traveling outside of the United States often involves a vaccination of one
kind or another. Vaccinations for the flu, hepatitis B, tetanus, measles, and
rubella are safe for you unless you’re currently having a major relapse (in
which case you should wait four to six weeks after the onset of the relapse to
have the vaccination) or you’re taking a medication that suppresses your
immune system, such as Novantrone (mitoxantrone), Imuran (azathioprine),
Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), or methotrexate. If you’re currently on one of
these immunosuppressants, you need to avoid the live, attenuated vaccines,
such as varicella or the vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella, because
you’re at greater risk of developing the disease.
The consensus among MS experts is that you shouldn’t be denied access to
health-preserving and potentially life-saving vaccines because of your MS.
Follow the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines for each vaccine
(www.cdc.gov/travel/vaccinat.htm).
Look for Adventure
The most important thing to remember is that you can have fun just like
everyone else. Spend a little time scouting on the Internet for accessible
options — safaris to Africa, European tours, sky-diving, deep-sea diving, ski
trips to Vail — whatever suits your fancy. Don’t assume that you can’t do
something until you’ve taken the time to research it carefully. You’d be sur-
prised at all the things that people with MS are up to.

Appendixes

In this part . . .
T
he three appendixes in this part are the frosting on
the cake. We start with a glossary so you can check
out all those words you hear in your doctor’s office or
stumble over in multiple sclerosis (MS) publications. Then
we give you a list of medications that are commonly used
in MS — either to manage the disease or treat the symp-
toms. And we end with a menu of helpful resources —
including books that focus on particular topics in this
book, Web sites, and agencies and organizations. You’ll no
doubt find these resources useful along the way.

Appendix A
Glossary
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): A hormone that’s extracted from the
pituitary glands of animals or made synthetically. ACTH stimulates the
adrenal glands to release glucocorticoid hormones, which help reduce
inflammation. ACTH may be used to treat acute relapses.
advance (medical) directive: A directive to medical personnel and family
members that preserves a person’s right to accept or reject a course of med-
ical treatment even after the person becomes mentally or physically incapaci-
tated to the point of being unable to communicate those wishes. Advance
directives can be in the form of a living will or a healthcare proxy.
ankle-foot orthosis (AFO): An ankle-foot orthosis is a brace, usually plastic,
that’s worn on the lower leg and foot to support the ankle and correct foot
drop. The AFO promotes correct heel-toe walking. See foot drop.
antibody: A protein produced by certain cells of the immune system. The
protein is produced in response to bacteria, viruses, and other types of for-
eign antigens.
antigen: Any substance that triggers the immune system to produce an anti-
body; generally refers to infectious or toxic substances such as viruses or
bacteria.
aspiration: Inhalation of food particles or fluids into the lungs.
aspiration pneumonia: Inflammation of the lungs due to aspiration.
assistive devices: Any tools (canes, walkers, shower chairs) that are
designed, fabricated, or adapted to assist a person in performing a particular
task.
assistive technology: A term used to describe all of the tools, products, and
devices, from the simplest to the most complex, that can make a particular
function easier (or simply possible) to perform.

ataxia: The incoordination and unsteadiness that result from the brain’s fail-
ure to regulate the body’s posture and the strength and direction of limb move-
ments. Ataxia is most often caused by disease activity in the cerebellum.
attack: See relapse.
autoimmune disease: A process in which the body’s immune system causes
illness by mistakenly attacking healthy cells, organs, or tissues in the body
that are essential for good health. Multiple sclerosis is believed to be an
autoimmune disease.
axon: The extension of a nerve cell (neuron) that conducts electrical
impulses to other nerve cells or muscles.
axonal damage: Injury to the axon in the nervous system, generally as a con-
sequence of trauma or disease. This damage may involve temporary,
reversible effects or permanent severing of the axon.
B-cell: A type of lymphocyte (white blood cell), manufactured in the bone
marrow, which makes antibodies.
Babinski reflex: A neurologic sign in MS in which stroking the outside sole of
the foot with a pointed object causes an upward movement of the big toe
rather than the normal bunching and downward movement of the toes. This
abnormal response indicates damage to the motor pathways in the brain and
spinal cord. See sign.
black hole: A dark area on a T1-weighted MRI scan that indicates destruction
of myelin and nerve fibers. Black holes occur in areas where repeated inflam-
mation has occurred.
blinding: An attempt to eliminate bias in the interpretation of clinical trial
outcomes by having at least one party involved in the clinical trial be
unaware of which patients are receiving the experimental treatment and
which are receiving the control substance. See double-blind clinical study
and single-blind clinical study.
blood-brain barrier: A cell layer around the blood vessels in the brain and

Finding Helpful Information Online
The Internet is a mixed bag of ever-changing information. The sites we’ve
listed here are helpful starting points in your ongoing search for information.
As you continue your search, remember that not all information is created
equal. The bottom line is — you can’t believe everything you read. If you see
something on the Internet that seems too good to be true, it probably is. So,
check things out with your healthcare team or the National MS Society, and
don’t make any big changes in your MS treatments without running them by
your neurologist first.
