Chemoreception 
Chemoreceptors include: 
    - taste buds (tongue)  
    - receptors in carotids (O2, H+, CO2) 
    - neurons in brain (osmolarity) 
    - odor receptors (nose) 

Chemoreception & Taste

Taste Modalities 
Five Sensations:   
 
sweet (sugars) - GPCRs 
 
sour (H+) – ion channels 
 
salt (Na+) – ion channels 
 
bitter (plant alkaloids) - GPCRs 
 
umami (glutamate) - GPCRs 
Taste ligands dissolved in saliva bind to chemoreceptors (proteins) on 
taste buds. Receptor binding raises intracellular Ca++ causing the 
release of neurotransmitters (graded potentials). This leads to the 
initiation of action potentials in the postsynaptic neuron (primary 
neuron).  

~400 olfactory receptor types but 
can discriminate 10,000 odors!

Odorant molecules in nasal mucus bind to receptors located on the cilia of olfactory neurons. Olfactory receptors are 
primary afferent neurons (6 million in nasal epithelium). Odorant receptors are G-protein coupled receptors. Activation 
triggers graded potentials which lead to action potentials. 

Key Concepts 
   
 
 
 
Taste receptor cells in the tongue detect 
chemicals associated with five basic taste 
qualities: umami (meat flavor), salt, sour, 
sweet, and bitter.  Their areas of 
distribution overlap and sensation of taste 
results from combinations of taste receptor 
activation. 
 
 
Smell results from the activation of 
olfactory receptors in the nose.
