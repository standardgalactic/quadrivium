Introduction
Introduction
This is the second volume containing examples from Functional analysis. The topics here are
limited to Topological and metric spaces, Banach spaces and Bounded operators.
Unfortunately errors cannot be avoided in a ﬁrst edition of a work of this type. However, the author
has tried to put them on a minimum, hoping that the reader will meet with sympathy the errors
which do occur in the text.

Weierstraß’s approximation theorem
Example 1.1 Let ϕ ∈C1([0, 1]). It follows from Weierstraß’s approximation theorem that Bn,ϕ(θ)
converges uniformly towards ϕ(θ) and that Bn,ϕ′(θ) converges uniformly towards ϕ′(θ) on [0, 1].
Prove that B′
n,ϕ(θ) →ϕ′(θ) uniformly on [0, 1].
Hint: First prove that B′
n,ϕ(θ) −Bn−1,ϕ′(θ) converges uniformly towards 0 on [0, 1].
Next prove that if ϕ ∈C∞([0, 1]), then we have for every k ∈N that B(n)
n,ϕ(θ) →ϕ(k)(θ) uniformly on
[0, 1].

Finally, we get by induction that if ϕ ∈Ck([0, 1]), then B(k)

Example 1.3 Let (M, d) be a metric space.
We deﬁne the open ball with centre x0 and radius r > 0 by
B(x0, r) = {x ∈M | d(x, x0) < r}.
We denote a subset A ⊂M open, if there for any x0 ∈A is an open ball with centre x0 contained in
A.
Show that an open ball is an open set.
Show that the open sets deﬁned in this way is a topology on M.
B(x_1,r_1)
B(x_0,r)
x_0
x_1
Let x1 ∈B(x0, r), i.e. d(x0, x1) < r. Choose
r1 = r −d(x0, x1) > 0.
We claim that
B(x1, rr) ⫅B(x0, r).
If x ∈B(x1, r1), then
d(x1, x) < r1 = r −d(x0, x1),
and it follows by the triangle inequality that
d(x0, x) ≤d(x0, x1) + d(x1, x) < d(x0, x1) + r −d(x0, x1) = r,
proving that x ∈B(x0, r). This holds for every x ∈B(x1, r1), so we have proved with the chosen
radius r1 that
B(x1, r1) ⫅B(x0, r),
hence every open ball is in fact an open set.
Then we shall prove that the system T generated by all open balls is a topology. Thus a set T ∈T
is characterized by the property that for every x ∈T there exists an r > 0, such that B(x, r) ⫅T.

1) It is trivial that M itself is an open set.
That ∅is open follows from the formal deﬁnition:
∀x0 ∈∅∃r ∈R+ : B(x0, r) ⫅∅.
Since there is no point in ∅, the condition is trivially fulﬁlled.
2) Let T = 
j∈J Tj, where all Tj ∈T . If x0 ∈T, then there exists a j ∈J, such that x0 ∈Tj. Since
T ∈T , there exists an r ∈R+, such that
B(x0, r) ⫅Tj ⫅T,
thus T ∈T .

3) Let T = n
j=1 Tj, where all Tj ∈T . If T = ∅, there is nothing to prove. Therefore, let x0 ∈T.
Then x0 must lie in every Tj ∈T , j = 1, . . . , n, so there are constants rj ∈R+, j = 1, . . . , n,
such that B(x0, rj) ⫅Tj. Now put t = min rj ∈R+ (notice that there is only a ﬁnite number of
rj > 0). Then
B(x0, r) ⫅B(x0, rj) ⫅Tj
for every j = 1, . . . , n,
and hence also in the intersection,
B(x0, r) ⫅
n

j=1
Tj = T.
Using the deﬁnition of T this means that T ∈T .
We have proved that T is a topology.
Example 1.4 Let (M, d) be a metric space. We say that a mapping T : M →M is continuous in
x0 ∈M if, for any ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that for all x ∈M we have
d(x0, x) < δ
=⇒
d(Tx0, Tx) < ε.
Show the T is continuous in x0 if and only if
xn →x0
=⇒
Txn →Tx0.
Show that T is continuous if the open sets are deﬁned as in Example 1.3.
Recall that xn →x0 means that
(1) ∀δ ∈R+ ∃n0 ∈N ∀n ≥n0 : d(xn, x0) < δ.
Assume that T is continuous in x0 ∈M and that xn →x0. We shall prove that Txn →Tx0, i.e.
∀ε ∈R+ ∃n0 ∈N ∀n ≥n0 : d(Txn, Tx0) < ε.
Let ε ∈R+ be arbitrary. Since T is continuous, we can ﬁnd to this ε > 0 a constant δ = δ(ε) ∈R+,
such that
(2) ∀x ∈M : d(x0, x) < δ
=⇒
d(Tx0, Tx) < ε.
Using that xn →x0, we get by (1) an n0 ∈N corresponding to δ = δ(ε) [in fact an n0 ∈N
corresponding to ε ∈R+], such that
∀n ≥n0 : d(xn, x0) < δ = δ(ε).
It follows from the continuity condition (2) that d(Tx0, Txn) < ε for n ≥n0, hence
∀ε ∈R+ ∃n0 ∈N ∀n ≥n0 : d(Txn, Tx0) < ε,
and we have proved that if T is continuous in x0 ∈M, then
xn →x0
=⇒
Txn →Tx0.

Then assume that T is not continuous at x0 ∈M, thus
(3) ∃ε ∈R+ ∀δ ∈R+ ∃x ∈M : d(x0, x) < δ ∧d(Tx0, Tx) ≥ε.
We shall prove that there exists a sequence (xn), such that xn →x0, while Txn does not converge
towards Tx0.
Choose ε > 0 as in (3). Putting δ = 1
n we get
∀n ∈N ∃xn ∈M : d(x0, xn) < 1
n ∧d(Tx0, Txn) ≥ε.
Then it follows that xn →x0 and Txn cannot be arbitrarily close to Tx0, thus (Txn) does not converge
towards Tx0.
Assume that T ◦−1(A) is open for every open set A. Choose x0 ∈M and A = B(Tx0, ε). Then A is
open, so T ◦−1(A) is open according to the assumption. It follows from x0 ∈T ◦−1(A) that there is a
δ ∈R+, such that
B(x0, δ) ⫅T ◦−1(A).
For every x0 ∈B(x0, δ), thus d(x, x0) < δ, we get Tx ∈B(Tx0, ε), hence d(Tx, Tx0) < ε, and we
have proved that T is continuous.
Conversely, assume that T is continuous, and let A be an open set, thus
∀x0 ∈A ∃r ∈R+ : d(x0, x) < r
=⇒
x ∈A.
We shall prove that T ◦−1(A) is open, i.e.
∀y0 ∈T ◦−1(A) ∃R ∈R+ : B(y0, R) ⫅T ◦−1(A).
This is done indirectly. Assumem that
∃y0 ∈T ◦−1(A) ∀R ∈R+ : B(y0, R) \ T ◦−1(A) ̸= ∅,
thus
∃y0 ∈T ◦−1(A) ∀R ∈R+ ∃y /∈T ◦−1(A) : d(y0, y) < R.
Since T is continuous at y0, it follows that
∀r ∈R+∃R ∈R+∀y ∈M : d(y0, y) < R =⇒d(Ty0, Ty) = d(x0, Ty) < r.
We conclude that Ty ∈A contradicting that y /∈T ◦−1(A), and the claim is proved.

1. Topological and metric spaces
Example 1.5 In a set M is given a function d′ from M × M to R that satisﬁes
d′(x, y) = 0
if and only if
x = y,
d′(x, y) ≤d′(z, x) + d′(z, y)
for all x, y, z ∈M.
Show that (M, d′) is a metric space.
If we choose z = y in the latter assumption and then use the former one, we get
d′(x, y) ≤d′(y, x) + d′(y, y) = d′(y, x) + 0 = d′(y, x),
proving that
d′(x, y) ≤d′(y, x)
for all x, y ∈M.
By interchanging x and y we obtain the opposite inequality, d′(y, x) ≤d′(x, y), hence
d′(x, y) = d′(y, x)
for all x, y ∈M,
and d′ is symmetric.
Using this result on the latter assumption we get the triangle inequality
d′(x, y) ≤d′(x, z) + d′(z, y).
It only remains to prove that d′(x, y) ≥0 for all x, y ∈M in order to conclude that d′ is a metric.
This follows from
0 = d′(x, x) ≤d′(x, y) + d′(y, x) = 2d′(x, y),
so the two conditions of the example suﬃce for d′ being a metric.
Example 1.6 Let (M, d) be a metric space.
The diameter of a non-empty subset A of M is deﬁned as
δ(A) = sup
x, y∈A
d(x, y)
(≤∞).
Show that δ(A) = 0 if and only if A contains only one point.
If A = {x} only contains one point, then
δ(A) = sup
x, y∈A
d(x, y) = d(x, x) = 0.
If A contains at least two points, choose x, y ∈A, where x ̸= y, from which we conclude that
δ(A) = sup
t, z∈A
d(t, z) ≥d(x, y) > 0,
and the claim is proved.

d1(x, y) =

1. Topological and metric spaces
a) It is trivial that d1(x, y) ≥0, because d(x, y) ≥0.
b) Then we see that d1(x, y) = 0, if and only if the numerator d(x, y) = 0, i.e. if and only if x = y.
c) The condition d1(x, y) = d1(y, x) follows immediately from d(x, y) = d(y, x).
d) It remains only to prove the triangle inequality
d1(x, y) ≤d1(x, z) + d1(z, y).
Now d(x, y) ≤d(x, z) + d(z, y), and the function
f(t) =
t
1 + t = 1 −
1
1 + t,
t ≥0,
is increasing. Hence
d1(x, y)
=
d(x, y)
1 + d(x, y) = f(d(x, y))
≤
f(d(x, z) + d(z, y)) =
d(x, z) + d(z, y)
1 + d(x, z) + d(z, y)
=
d(x, z)
1 + d(x, z) + d(z, y) +
d(z, y)
1 + d(x, z) + d(z, y)
≤
d(x, z)
1 + d(x, z) +
d(z, y)
1 + d(z, y)
=
d1(x, z) + d1(z, y).
Summing up, we have proved that d1(x, y) is a metric on M.
2) It follows from
d1(x, y) =
d(x, y)
1 + d(x, y) = 1 −
1
1 + d(x, y) ≤1,
that
δ1(A) = sup
x, y∈A
d1(x, y) ≤1
for every subset A.
3) a) If the metric d is not bounded on M, then there are subsets A, such that δ1(A) = 1.
In fact, we choose to every n ∈N points xn, yn ∈M, such that
d(xn, yn) ≥n −1
for n ∈N.
As mentioned previously, f(t) =
t
1 + t is increasing, so
d1(xn, yn) = f(d(x, y)) ≥f(n −1) = n −1
n
= 1 −1
n.
Putting
A = {xn | n ∈N} ∪{yn | n ∈N},
it follows that δ1(A) ≥1 −1
n for every n ∈N, thus δ1(A) ≥1. On the other hand, we have
already proved that δ1(A) ≤1, so we conclude that δ1(A) = 1.

b) If instead d is bounded on M, then M has itself a ﬁnite d-diameter, δ(M) = c < ∞, and
δ1(M) =
c
1 + c = 1 −
1
1 + c < 1.
There are many examples of such metrics. The most obvious one is the well-known
d0(x, y) =
 0
for x = y,
1
for x ̸= y,
where
˜d0(x, y) =
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎩
0
for x = y,
1
2
for x ̸= y.
We get another example by starting with the bounded d1 above. Then
d2(x, y) =
d1(x, y)
1 + d1(x, y) =
d(x, y)
1 + 2d(x, y),
with δ2(A) ≤1
2 for every subset A ⫅M.
4) It follows from
d1(xn, x) = 1 −
1
1 + d(xn, x),
that the condition d1(xn, x) →0 is equivalent with 1 + d(xn, x) →1, thus with d(xn, x) →0, and
the claim is proved.
Example 1.8 Let (M1, d1) and (M2, d2) be metric spaces.
Show that M1 × M2 can be made into a metric space by the following deﬁnition of a metric d:
d ((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) = d1(x1, y1) + d2(x2, y2).
Show that also d⋆given by
d⋆((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) = max {d1(x1, y1), d2(x2, y2)}
deﬁnes a metric on M1 × M2.
1) Clearly,
d ((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) ≥0
and
d⋆((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) ≥0.
2) If (x1, x2) = (y1, y2), i.e. x1 = y1 and x2 = y2, then
d ((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) = 0
and
d⋆((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) = 0.

d⋆((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) = 0,
then both
d1(x1, y1) = 0
and
d2(x2, y2) = 0,
and it follows that x1 = y1 and x2 = y2, and hence (x1, x2) = (y1, y2).
3) The symmetry is obvious.
4) The triangle inequality holds for both d1 and d2. Hence, it also holds for d and d⋆. In fact,
d ((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) = d1(x1, y1) + d2(x2, y2)
≤{d1(x1, z1) + d1(z1, y1)} + {d2(x2, z2) + d2(z2, y2)}
= {d1(x1, z1) + d2(x2, z2)} + {d1(z1, y1) + d2(z2, y2)}
= d ((x1, x2), (z1, z2)) + d ((z1, z2), (y1, y2)) ,
and
d⋆((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) = max {d1(x1, y1), d2(x2, y2)}
≤max {d1(x1, z1) + d1(z1, y1), d2(x2, z2) + d2(z2, y2)}
≤max {d1(x1, z1), d2(x2, z2)} + max {d1(z1, y1), d2(z2, y2)}
= d⋆((x1, x2), (z1, z2)) + d⋆((z1, z2), (y1, y2)) .
Example 1.9 Show that in any set M we can deﬁne a metric by
d(x, y) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
0
if x = y,
1
if x ̸= y.
Then we call (M, d) for a discrete metric space.
Characterize the sequences in M where d(xn, x) →0.
1) Clearly, d(x, y) ≥0.
2) Clearly, d(x, y) = 0, if and only if x = y.
3) Clearly, d(x, y) = d(y, x).
4) Finally, it is almost trivial that
d(x, y) ≤d(x, z) + d(z, y),
because the left hand side is always ≤1. If the right hand side is < 1, then both d(x, z) = 0 and
d(z, y) = 0, and we infer that x = z and z = y, hence also x = y. This implies that the left hand
side d(x, y) = 0, and the triangle inequality is fulﬁlled.

Summing up we have proved that (M, d) is a metric space.
If d(xn, x) →0, then choose ε = 1
2. There exists an n0 ∈N, such that
d(xn, x) < ε = 1

for n ≥n0.
This is only possible, if d(xn, x) = 0, i.e. if
xn = x
for all n ≥n0.
We conclude that all the convergent sequences are constant eventually.

1. Topological and metric spaces
Example 1.10 Let (M, d) be a metric space and consider M as a topological space with the topology
stemming from the open balls (the ball topology).
Recall that a set A is closed if M \ A is open.
Show that A ⊂M is closed if and only if
xn ∈A,
xn →x
=⇒
x ∈A.
Show that if (M, d) is a complete metric space and A is a closed subset of M, then (A, d) is a complete
metric space.
Assume that A is closed and let xn ∈A be a convergent sequence in M, i.e. xn →x ∈M. We shall
prove that x ∈A.
Indirect proof. Assume that x /∈A, i.e. x ∈M \ A, which is open.
There exists an r > 0, such that
B(x, r) ⫅M \ A,
i.e.
B(x, r) ∩A = ∅.
Now, xn →x, so there exists an nr ∈N, such that
d(xn, x) < r
for n ≥nr,
and we see that xn ∈B(x, r) ∩A = ∅, which is not possible. Hence our assumption is wrong, so we
conclude that x ∈A.
Conversely, assume for every convergent sequence (xn) ⫅A the limit point lies in A. We shall prove
that A is closed, or equivalently that M \ A is open.
Indirect proof. Assume that M \ A is not open. There exists an x ∈M \ A, such that
∀r ∈R+ ∃y ∈A : d(x, y) < r.
If we put r = 1
n, n ∈N, with corresponding y = xn, we deﬁne a sequence in A, which converges towards
x, thus x ∈A according to the assumption. This is contradicting the assumption that x ∈M \ A.
Hence this assumption must be wrong, and x ∈A as requested.
Finally, assume that (M, d) is a complete metric space and that A is a closed subset of M. We shall
prove that (A, d) is complete.
Let (xn) be a Cauchy sequence on A. Then (xn) is also a Cauchy sequence on the complete metric
space M, thus (xn) converges in M towards the limit x ∈M. However, A is a closed subset, so it
follows from the previous result that x ∈A. We have proved that every Cauchy sequence (xn) on A
has a limit x ∈A, which means that (A, d) is complete.

1. Topological and metric spaces
Example 1.11 Show that
d(x, y) = | arctan x −arctan y|
deﬁnes a metric on R.
The deﬁnition includes an absolute value, hence d(x, y) ≥0 for all x, y ∈R.
The function arctan t is strictly increasing on R, hence d(x, y) = 0, if and only if x = y.
Clearly, d(x, y) = d(y, x).
The triangle inequality follows from
d(x, y) = | arctan x −arctan y| ≤| arctan x −arctan z| + | arctan z −arctan y| = d(x, z) + d(z, y).

Show that

and ﬁnd a similar inequality when d1 is replaced by d2.
Show that if a sequence (xn) converges to x in one of these metrics, then we have coordinate wise

Finally,

is a metric, because the ﬁrst three conditions again are trivial, and the triangle inequality follows from
|xi −yi| ≤|xi −zi| + |zi −yi|
for every i = 1, . . . , k,
thus
|xi −yi| ≤d∞(x, z) + d∞(z, y)
for every i = 1, . . . , k,
and by taking the maximum once more,
d∞(x, y) ≤d∞(x, z) + d∞(z, y).
We have now proved that d1, d2 and d∞are all metrics.

Remark 1.1 A simple squaring shows that d2(x, y) ≤d1(x, y), which can also be seen on the ﬁgure
(the simple proof is left to the reader). This means that
d∞(x, y) ≤d2(x, y) ≤d1(x, y) ≤k · d∞(x, y).
♦
Using that xni →xi for every i = 1, 2, . . . , k, if and only if d∞(xn, x) →0, we conclude from the
inequalities
d∞(x, y) ≤d1(x, y) ≤k · d∞(x, y),
d∞(x, y) ≤d2(x, y) ≤

that this is fulﬁlled if and only if d1(xn, 0) →0, and if and only if d2(x, y) →0.

|xi −yi|.
Hint: Show that the space of bounded complex sequences ℓ∞is a complete space and show then that
c is a closed subset, then apply Example 1.10.
Let xn = (xn

∀ε > 0 ∃N ∈N ∀m, n ≥N : d (xm, xn) < ε.
This means that

In particular, (xn

(xi) is a Cauchy sequence, i.e.
(4) ∀ε > 0 ∃I ∈N ∀i, j ≥I : |xi −xj| < ε.
It follows from
|xi −xj| ≤|xi −xn

and (xn

1. Topological and metric spaces
Example 1.14 In the set of bounded complex sequences ℓ∞equipped with the metric from exercise
12 we consider the sets c0 consisting of the sequences converging to 0 and c00 consisting of the sequences
with only a ﬁnite number of elements diﬀerent from 0.
Investigate if c0 and/or c00 are closed subsets of ℓ∞.
The sequence

belongs to ℓ∞, though it does not belong to c00. Choose

Then xn ∈c00 and xn →x =

/∈c00, hence c00 is not closed.
Let xn = (xn

2, · · · ) ∈c0 be convergent in ℓ∞, i.e. limi→∞xn
i = 0 for every n. There exists an
x ∈ℓ∞, such that
∀ε > 0 ∃n0 ∀n ≥n0 : ∥x −xn∥∞= sup

We shall prove that limi→∞xi = 0. Now,
|xi| ≤|xi −xn

First choose n, such that ∥x −xn∥∞< ε

Then choose I, such that |xn

2 for every i ≥I. Summing up we get for all i ≥I that
|xi| < ε

2 = ε.
We infer that limi→∞xi = 0, thus (xi) ∈c0, and we have proved that c0 is a closed subset of ℓ∞.

Contractions
Example 1.15 Consider the metric space (M, d), where M = [1, ∞[, and d the usual distance. Let
the mapping T : M →M be given by
Tx = x
2 + 1
x.
Show that T is a contraction and ﬁnd the minimal contraction constant α. Find also the ﬁxed point.
First compute

Now, x, y ≥1, so 0 < 1
xy ≤1, and the function

xy
has the range

. We conclude that α = 1

The ﬁxpoint satisﬁes the equation Tx = x, thus
x = x
2 + 1
x,
hence x
2 = 1
x,
i.e. x2 = 2.
Since x ≥1, the ﬁxpoint must be x =
√
2, which also is easily seen by insertion.
Since α = 1
2 < 1, it follows from the above that it is the only ﬁxpoint.
Example 1.16 A mapping T from a metric space (M, d) into itself is called a weak contraction if
d(Tx, Ty) < d(x, y),
for all x, y ∈M, x ̸= y.
Show that T has at most one ﬁxed point.
Show that T does not necessarily have a ﬁxed point.
Hint: One should take Tx = x + 1
x for x ≥1.
Let T be a weak contraction, and assume that both x and y are ﬁxpoints, i.e. Tx = x and Ty = y.
If x ̸= y, then
d(x, y) = d(Tx, Ty) < d(x, y),

which is not possible. Hence y = x, and there is at most one ﬁxpoint.
Deﬁne Tx = x + 1

It follows from 0 < 1
xy ≤1 for x, y ≥1, that
|Tx −Ty| < |x −y|
for x ̸= y,
and T is a weak contraction on [1, +∞[.
The weak contraction Tx = x + 1
x does not have a ﬁxpoint, because Tx = x would imply that 1
x = 0,
which is not possible.
Example 1.17 It is very common in mathematical analysis to consider iterations of the form
xn = g(xn−1),
where g is a C1-function. Show that the sequence (xn) is convergent for any choice of x0 if there is
an α, 0 < α < 1, such that
|g′(x)| ≤α
for all x ∈R.
It follows from the Mean Value Theorem that one to any x and y can ﬁnd t = t(x, y) between x and
y, such that
g(x) −g(y) = g′(t) · (x −y),
thus
|g(x) −g(y)| = |g′(t)| · |x −y| ≤α |x −y|.
This proves that g is a contraction, and the claim follows from Banach’s Fixpoint Theorem.
Example 1.18 To approximate the solution to an equation f(x) = 0, we bring the equation on the
form x = g(x) and choose an x0 and use the iteration xn = g(xn−1). Assume that g is a C1-function
on the interval [x0 −δ; x0 + δ], and that |g′(x)| ≤α < 1 for x ∈[x0 −δ; x0 + δ], and moreover
|g(x0) −x0| ≤(1 −α)δ.
Show that there is one and only one solution x ∈[x0 −δ; x0 + δ] to the equation, and that xn →x.
Noticing that |g′(x)| ≤α < 1 on the interval [x0 −δ; x0 +δ], the claim follows from Banach’s Fixpoint
Theorem, if we only can prove that the iterative sequence (xn) lies entirely in the interval [x0−δ, x0+δ].
We prove this by induction.

1. Topological and metric spaces
It is obvious that x0 ∈[x0 −δ, x0, δ].
Assume that xn ∈[x0 −δ, x0 + δ]. Then we get for the following element xn+1 = g(xn),
|xn+1 −x0|
=
|g(xn) −x0|
≤
|g(xn) −g(x0)| + |g(x0) −x0|
≤
α |xn −x0| + (1 −α)δ
≤
α δ + (1 −α)δ = δ,
proving that xn+1 ∈[x0 −δ, x0 + δ], and the claim follows.
Example 1.19 Solve by iteration the equation f(x) = 0 for f ∈C1([a, b]), f(x) < 0 < f(b) and f ′
bounded and strictly positive in [a, b].
Hint: Take g(x) = x −λ f(x) for a smart choice of λ.
Putting
g(x) = x −λ f(x),
λ ̸= 0,
it follows that f(x) = 0, if and only if g(x) = x. Now,
g′(x) = 1 −λ f ′(x)
and
0 < k1 ≤f ′(x) ≤k2,
so
1 −λ k2 ≤g′(x) ≤1 −λ k1.
If we choose λ = 1
k2
, then
0 ≤g′(x) ≤1 −k1
k2
= α < 1,
and the mapping g : [a, b] →[a, b] is increasing and a contraction, so it has by Banach’s Fixpoint
Theorem precisely one ﬁxpoint in [a, b].

Example 1.21 A mapping T : R →R satisﬁes a Lipschitz condition with constant k, if
|Tx −Ty| ≤k|x −y|,
for all x, y ∈R.
1) Is T a contraction?
2) If T is a C1-function with bounded derivative, show that T satisﬁes a Lipschitz condition.
3) If T satisﬁes a Lipschitz condition, is T then a C1-function with bounded derivative?
4) Assume that Tx −Ty| ≤k |x −y|α for some α > 1. Show that T is a constant.
1) If k ≥1, then T is not necessarily a contraction.
If instead 0 ≤k < 1, then T is always a contraction.
2) It follows from the Mean Value Theorem that
|T(x) −T(y)| = |T ′(t)| · |x −y|,
where t = t(x, y) lies somewhere between x and y.
Since |T ′(t)| ≤k, it is obvious that T fulﬁls a Lipschitz condition.

have constructed a mapping T /∈C1, which satisﬁes a Lipschitz condition. (It is of course possible

This proves that T is diﬀerentiable everywhere of the derivative 0. Then T is a constant.
Example 1.22 Let T be a mapping from a complete metric space (M, d) into itself, and assume that
there is a natural number m such that T m is a contraction.
Show that T has one and only one ﬁxed point.
If T m is a contraction, then T m has a ﬁxpoint x, thus T mx = x. When we apply T on this equation,
we get
T m+1x = T m(Tx) = Tx,
hence Tx is also a ﬁxpoint of T m.
Since T m is a contraction, the ﬁxpoint is unique, so Tx = x, and we have proved that x is a ﬁxpoint
for T.
Conversely, if x is a ﬁxpoint for T, then x is also a ﬁxpoint for T m, because Tx = x implies that
T mx = T m−1(Tx) = T m−1 = · · · = Tx = x.
We have assumed that T m is a contraction, hence the ﬁxpoint for T m is unique. This is true for every
ﬁxpoint x for T, hence it must be unique.

t ∈[a, b],
where v ∈C([a, b]), k ∈C([a, b]2) and μ ∈C.

where c = max |k|. Then show (by looking at d∞(T mx, T my)) that T m is a contraction for some m

There exists in particular an M ∈N, such that
α = |μ|mcm · (b −a)m

for all m ≥M.
Thus, if m ≥M, then T m is a contraction, and T m has a ﬁxpoint x. An application of Example 1.22
shows that x is also a ﬁxpoint for T, and x is the unique ﬁxpoint of T.
Let x0 ∈C0([a, b]). Deﬁne by iteration xm+1 = Txn. Then xm = T mx0. The sequence (xm·n)
converges towards x. The same does the sequence (xmn+j), where j = 0, 1, . . . , m −1, because
xmn+j = T mn 
T jx0
 
= T mn+jx0.
Summing up we conclude that (xn) itself converges towards x, and the claim is proved.

Example 1.28 Let C0([a, b]) be equipped with the metric
d(x, y) = max
t∈[a,b] |x(t) −y(t)|.
We deﬁne an operator (a mapping) S by
Sx(t) =
" b
a
k(t, s)x(s) ds,
where k is a continuous function on [a, b] × [a, b]. Let (xn) be inductively given by
(7) xn+1 = u + μ Sxn,
and put zn = xn −xn−1. Prove that (7) equivalently can be written
(8) zn+1 = μ Szn.
Put x0 = u, and prove that (7) implies the Neumann series
x = lim
n→∞xn = u + μ Su + μ2S2u + · · · .
We note that
xn+1(t) = u(t) + μ
" b
a
k(t, s)xn(s) ds = u(t) + μ Sxn(t).
Putting zn = xn −xn−1, we get
zn+1
=
xn+1 −xn = u + μ Sxn −u −μ Sxn−1
=
μ S(xn −xn−1) = μ Szn.
If |μ| <

(b −a)c, then xn →x. It follows from
xn = xn −xn−1 + xn−1 −zxn−2 + xn−2 + · · · + x1 −x0 + x0 = x0 + z1 + · · · + zn,
and
zn = μ Szn−1 = · · · = μnSnx0,
that 
n zn is convergent, and we have
x = lim

x(s) ds = 1
by means of the Neumann series, where we assume that ∥μ| < 1.
Try also to solve the equation
directly.
In this case, u(t) = 1 and k(t, s) = 1, a = 0 and b = 1, thus |μ| < 1 is a reasonable requirement (cf.
Example 1.28). It follows from Example 1.28 that
x = 1 + μ S + μ2S21 + · · · .
We get from S1 =
# 1
0 1 ds = 1, that S21 = 1. Then by induction, Sn1 = 1, hence
x = 1 + μ + μ2 + · · · =

1 −μ.
We now solve the equation directly. It follows from the rearrangement
x(t) = 1 + μ

that x(t) = a must be a constant. Then by insertion,
a = 1 + μ · a,
hence
x(t) = a =

which apparently holds for every μ ̸= 1, and not just for |μ| < 1.

Example 2.1 In the vector space C([a, b]) we consider the functions
e0(t), e1(t), . . . , en(t),
where ej(t) is a polynomial of degree j, where j = 0, 1, . . . , n,
Show that e0, e1, . . . , en are linearly independent.
Since e0(t) = e0 ̸= 0, we infer from a0e0 = 0 that a0 = 0, and the claim is true for k = 0.
First let ek(t) = tk, and assume that the claim is true for k = 0, 1, . . . , n. Now let
a0 + a1t + · · · + antn + an+1tn+1 ≡0
for t ∈[a, b].
We get by a diﬀerentiation,
a1 + 2a2t + · · · + nantn−1 + (n + 1)an+1tn ≡0
for t ∈[a, b],
thus kak = 0, k = 1, 2, . . . , n+1, according to the assumption of induction. We conclude that ak = 0
for k = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1, which by insertion gives the condition a0 = 0. Then it follows by induction
that {tn | n ∈N0} are linearly independent.

Example 2.2 Let U1 and U2 be subspaces of the vector space V . Show that U1 ∩U2 is a subspace.
Is U1 ∪U2 always a subspace? If no, state conditions such that U1 ∪U2 is a subspace.
If U1 and U2 are subspaces, then
∀λ ∀u, v ∈Ui : u + λ v ∈Ui,
i = 1, 2.
If u, v ∈U1 ∩U2, then in particular, u, v ∈Ui, i = 1, 2, thus u + λ v ∈Ui, i = 1, 2, according to the
above. It follows that u + λv ∈U1 ∩U2, hence U1 ∩U2 is also a subspace.
On the other hand, U1 ∪U2 is rarely a subspace. E.g. the X-axis and the Y -axis are two subspaces in
R2, and it is obvious that the union of the two axes is not a subspace.
The condition is that U1 ⫅U2, or U1 ⫆U2. In fact, if one of these conditions is satisﬁed, then it is
obvious that U1 ∪U2 = Ui, where i is one of the numbers 1, 2.
If this condition is not fulﬁlled, then there exist
u1 ∈U1 \ U2
and
u2 ∈U2 \ U1.
Assume that u1 + u2 ∈U1 ∪U2, e.g. u1 + u2 ∈U1. Then u2 = (u1 + u2) −u1 ∈U1 contradicting the
assumption. Hence we conclude that u1 + u2 /∈U1 ∪U2, and U1 ∪U2 is not a subspace.

Example 2.3 Let V denote the set of all real n × n matrices.
Show that V with the usual scalar multiplication and addition is a vector space.
Is the set of all regular n × n-matrices a subspace of V ?
Is the set of all symmetric n × n matrices a subspace of V ?
The ﬁrst question is trivial: Since 0 is the zero element, and since 0 is not regular, the set of all regular
matrices is not a subspace.
The set of all symmetric matrices is of course a subspace. In fact, if (aij) and (bij) are symmetric,
thus aij = aji and bij = bji, then
λ(aij) + (bij) = (λ aij + bij),
where
λ aij + bij = λ aji + bji,
hence (λ aij + bij) is again symmetric.
Example 2.4 In the space C([a, b]) we consider the sets
U1 = the set of polynomials deﬁned on [a, b].
U2 = the set of polynomials deﬁned on [a, b] of degree ≤n.
U3 = the set of polynomials deﬁned on [a, b] of degree = n.
U4 = the set of all f ∈C([a, b]) with f(a) = f(b) = 0.
U5 = C1([a, b]).
Which of the Ui, i = 1, 2, dots, 5, are subspaces of C([a, b])?
U1 = the set of all polynomials is a subspace.
U2 = the set of all polynomials of degree ≤n is a subspace.
U3 = the set of all polynomials of degree = n is not a subspace. E.g. 0 does not belong to U3.
U4 = the set of all f ∈C0([a, b]) with f(a) = f(b) = 0 is a subspace.
U5 = C1([a, b]) is a subspace.

Example 2.5 In C([−1, 1]) we consider the sets U1 and U2 consisting of the odd and even functions
in C([−1, 1]), respectively.
Show that U1 and U2 are subspaces and that U1 ∩U2 = {0}.
Show that every f ∈C([−1, 1]) can be written in the form f = f1 + f2, where f1 ∈U1 and f2 ∈U2,
and that this decomposition is unique.
If f, g are odd (even) functions, then f + λ g is again an odd (even) function. Hence U1 and U2 are
subspaces.
If f ∈U1 ∩U2, then both
f(−t) = f(t)
and
f(−t) = −f(t),
thus f(t) = −f(t) for all t, and we conclude that 2f(t) ≡0. We conclude that f ≡0.
We see from
f(t) = f(t) + f(−t)

+ f(t) −f(−t)
2
,
where
f(t) + f(−t)
2
is even,
and
f(t) −f(−t)

is odd,
that such a splitting exists.
Assume that
f(t) = f1(t) + f2(t) = g1(t) + g2(t),
where f1 and g1 are odd, while f2 and g2 are even. Then
f1(t) −g1(t) = g2(t) −f2(t) ∈U1 ∩U2 = {0},
hence f1 −g1 = 0 and g2 −f2 = 0. We conclude that f1 = g1 and f2 = g2, and the splitting is unique.

Normed spaces
Example 2.6 In the space C1([a, b]) we have the norm
∥f∥∞= sup
t∈[a,b]
|f(t)|.
Show that we could take supt∈(a,b) |f(t)| instead.
Show that C1([a, b]) with the sup-norm is not at Banach space.
Show that
∥f∥⋆

t∈[a,b]
|f(t)| + sup
t∈[a,b]
|f ′(t)|
is also a norm on C1([a, b]) and that it is a Banach space with this norm.
Every f ∈C1([a, b]) is continuous, so
sup
t∈[a,b]
|f(t)| = sup
t∈(a,b)
|f(t)|,
and we can use any of the two sup-norms.
It follows from Weierstraß’s Approximation Theorem that the set P of polynomials on [a, b] is dense
in C0([a, b]) in the uniform norm. Since
P ⊂C1([a, b]) ⊂C0([a, b])
and C1([a, b]) ̸= C0([a, b]), we infer that C1([a, b]) cannot be complete, thus (C1([a, b]), ∥· ∥) is not a
Banach space.
Then we shall prove that ∥· ∥⋆

∞≥0.
2) If

|f(t)| + sup
t∈[a,b]
|f ′(t)| = ∥f∥∞+ ∥f ′∥∞= 0,
then in particular ∥f∥= 0, so f = 0, because f is continuous.

We have proved that ∥· ∥⋆
∞is a norm on C1([a, b]).
It “only” remains to prove that (C1([a, b]), ∥· ∥⋆
∞) is a Banach space.
Let (fn) be a Cauchy sequence, i.d.
∀ε > 0 ∃N ∈N ∀m, n ∈N : m, n ≥N
=⇒
∥fm −fn∥⋆
∞< ε.
It follows from ∥f∥⋆
∞= ∥f∥∞+ ∥f ′∥∞, that ∥f∥∞≤∥f∥⋆
∞and ∥f ′∥∞≤∥f∥⋆
∞, thus (fn) and (f ′
n)
are Cauchy sequences in the Banach space (C0([a, b]), ∥· ∥∞). Hence there are continuous functions
f, g ∈C0([a, b]), such that
fn →f
and
f ′
n →g.
Notice that it is not possible from this directly to conclude that
a) f ∈C1([a, b]),
b) f ′ = g.
A proof is required:
Deﬁne a function h ∈C1([a, b]) by
h(x) =
" x
a
g(t) dt + f(a),
x ∈[a, b].

We shall prove that h(x) = f(x). It suﬃces to prove that fn →h uniformly, because the limit function

|fn(a) −f(a)| < ε

When we divide by a > 0, we get
m∥x∥= 1
a ∥x∥≤|∥x∥| ≤b
a ∥x∥= M∥x∥,
and we have proved that any two norms on a ﬁnite dimensional subspace are equivalent.
Since
m∥x∥≤|∥x∥| ≤M∥x∥,
0 < m ≤M,
and
1
M |∥x∥| ≤∥x∥≤1
m |∥x∥|,
are equivalent, it suﬃces to prove that if U is closed with respect to ∥· ∥, then U is also closed with
respect to |∥· ∥|.
It is well-known (cf. Example 1.10) that U is closed, if and only if
xn ∈U and xn →x
=⇒
x ∈U.
Assume that U is closed with respect to ∥· ∥, and let (xn) ⫅U be a sequence for which
|∥xn∥| →0
for n →+∞,
thus (xn) is convergent with respect to the norm |∥· ∥|. We shall prove that x ∈U. However,
∥xn −x∥≤1
m |∥xn −x∥| →0
for n →+∞,
so also xn →x with respect to the norm ∥·∥. It follows from the condition of Example 1.10 (applied
with respect to ∥· ∥) that x ∈U, and the claim is proved.
Example 2.10 Show that a compact set in a normed vector space V is closed and bounded.
If V is ﬁnite dimensional, show that a closed and bounded set is compact.
Assume that U is compact in V , i.e. every sequence (xn) ⫅U has a subsequence (yn), which converges
towards an element y in U. We shall prove that U is closed and bounded.
Assume that (xn) ⫅U is convergent in V , thus xn →x ∈V . It follows from Example 1.10 that U
is closed, if we can prove that also x ∈U.
According to the assumption there is a subsequence (yn) of (xn), such that yn →y ∈U. However,
since xn →x, also yn →x, and since the limit value is unique in normed spaces, we conclude that
x = y ∈U, and it follows that U is closed.

Then we shall prove that if U is compact, then U is bounded. Indirect proof. Assume that U is
unbounded. Let x1 ∈U be arbitrarily chosen. There exists an x2 ∈U, such that
∥x2∥≥1 + ∥x1∥.
Choose inductively a sequence (xn) ⫅U, such that
∥xn+1∥≥1 + ∥xn∥.
Then note that if xn and xn+p, p ∈N are any two elements, then
∥xn+p∥≥1 + ∥xn+p−1∥≥2 + ∥xn+p−2∥≥· · · ≥p + ∥xn∥,
hence
∥xn+p −xn∥≥∥xn+p∥−∥xn∥≥0 ≥1
for alle p ∈N,
proving that no subsequence of (xn) is convergent, and U is not compact.
We get by contraposition that if U is compact, then U is bounded.
Assume now that V is ﬁnite dimensional and that U is bounded and closed. Let e1 . . . , ek denote a
basis for V , and let the constant c > 0 be chosen as in Example 2.8, such that

Since yj ∈U, and U is closed, we get y ∈U according to Example 1.10, and the claim is proved.

Example 2.12 In ℓ∞, the vector space of bounded sequences, we consider the sets U1 and U2, where
U1 denotes the set of sequences with only ﬁnitely many elements diﬀerent from 0 and U2 the set of
sequences with all but the N ﬁrst elements equal to 0.
Are U1 and/or U2 closed subspaces in ℓ∞?
Are U1 and/or U2 ﬁnite dimensional?
It follows from
xn =

and
xn →

k∈N
/∈U1,
that U1 is not closed.
Of course U1 is a subspace, and since every ﬁnite dimensional subspace is closed (which U1 is not),
we conclude that U1 is not ﬁnite dimensional.
On the other hand, U2 and RN are isomorphic, so U2 er is a closed and ﬁnite dimensional vector
space, dim U2 = N.
Example 2.13 Let (V, ∥· ∥) be a normed vector space, and let U be the unit ball,
U = {x ∈V | ∥x∥≤1}.
Prove that U is compact, if and only if V is ﬁnite dimensional.
Obviously, U is closed and bounded. If V is ﬁnite dimensional, then it follows from Example 2.10
that U is compact. It remains to be proved that if U is compact, then V is ﬁnite dimensional.
Indirect proof. Assume that V is not ﬁnite dimensional. Choose any x1 ∈U, such that ∥x1∥= 1.
Then x1 generates a subspace V1. Then by Riesz’s lemma (Example 2.11) there exists an x2 ∈U,
such that
∥x2∥= 1
and
∥x2 −λx1∥≥1

for all λ.
By induction, using Riesz’s lemma in each step, we obtain a sequence xn ∈U of unit vectors, ∥xn∥= 1,
such that

We have in particular,
∥xn −xm∥≥1

for n ̸= m,
proving that (xn) does not contain any convergent subsequence. Hence U is not compact.
We get by contraposition that if the unit ball U is compact, then the vector space V is ﬁnite dimen-
sional.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Let g ∈C([a, b]), and let q be given by 1

Most of the claims have already been proved, included the estimate ∥Tg∥≤∥g∥1. We shall only proof
that we even get equality. The trick is to choose a suitable f ∈C([a, b]). We have
Tgf =

f(t)g(t) dt.
Since g(t) is continuous, we get
g(t) = ei ϕ(t) |g(t)|,
where ϕ(t) can be chosen continuous in every interval, in which g(t) ̸= 0.
Choosing

Example 2.16 Show that a closed subspace of a Banach space is itself a Banach space.
Let U be a closed subspace of a Banach space V . Since V is complete, it follows from Example 1.10
that U is also complete, hence U is a Banach space.
Example 2.17 Let Vi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, be normed vector spaces, with norms ∥· ∥i, i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
The product space V1 × V2 × · · · × Vn = .n
i=1 Vi is deﬁned by
n
/
i=1
Vi = {(x1, x2, . . . , xn) | xi ∈Vi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n}.
In .n
i=1 Vi we use coordinate wise addition:
(x1, x2, . . . , xn) + (y1, y2, . . . , yn) = (x1 + y1, x2 + y2, . . . , xn + yn),
and scalar multiplication:
λ(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = (λx1, λx2, . . . , λxn),
and we deﬁne the norm by
∥(x1, x2, . . . , xn)∥=
n

i=1
∥xi∥i.
Show that .n
i=1 Vi with this norm is a normed vector space, and show that if all the spaces Vi with
their respective norms are Banach spaces, then .n
i=1 Vi is a Banach space.
We shall prove the claim by induction over n. For n = 1 there is nothing to prove.
If n = 2, then clearly V1 × V2 is a vector space with the operations addition and scalar multiplication
deﬁned above. Then we shall prove that
|(x1, x2)∥= ∥x1∥1 + ∥x2∥2
is a norm.
Clearly, ∥(x1, x2)∥≥0, and if ∥(x1, x2)∥= ∥x1∥1 + ∥x2∥2 = 0, then both ∥x1∥1 = 0 and ∥x2∥2 = 0,
thus x1 = 0 og x2 = 0.
Furthermore,
∥λ(x1, x2)∥= ∥(λx1, λx2)∥= ∥λx1∥1 + ∥λx2∥2 = |λ| (∥x1∥1 + ∥x2∥2) = |λ| · ∥(x1, x2)∥.
Finally,
∥(x1, x2) + (y1, y2)∥
=
∥(x1 + y1, x2 + y2)∥= ∥x1 + y1∥1 + ∥x2 + y2∥2
≤

and we have proved that ∥· ∥is a norm on V1 × V2.
Then assume that both V1 and V2 are complete, and let ((xn

It follows from
∥xn

t = 1, 2,
that (xn
i )n are Cauchy sequences on Vi, i = 1, 2, hence convergent with limit values xi, i = 1, 2. By
this construction we then get
∥(x1, x2) −(xn
1, xn
2)∥= ∥x1 −xn
1∥1 + ∥x2 −xn
2∥2 →0
for n →+∞,
proving that (xn
1, xn
2) →(x1, x2) ∈V1 × V2.
We have proved that V1 × V2 is complete, thus
(V1 × V2, ∥· ∥) is a Banach space.
Assume that the claims are true for some n ∈N (this is true by the above for n = 1 and for n = 2),
and consider .n+1
i=1 Ui, where each Ui is a normed vector space (a Banach space). We deﬁne
V1 =
n
/
i=1
Ui
and
V2 = Un+1.
It follows from the assumption of the induction that (V1, ∥·∥⋆
n) is a normed vector space (or a Banach
space) under the given assumptions, and the same is true for the space (V2, ∥· ∥n+1). It only remains
to notice that
∥(x1, x2, . . . , xn)∥⋆
n = ∥x1∥1 + ∥x2∥2 + · · · ∥xn∥n,
hence
∥(x1, . . . , xn, xn+1)∥= ∥(x1, . . . , xn)∥⋆
n + ∥xn+1∥n+1.
It follows that 0n+1
i=1 Ui is a normed vector space (or a Banach space) under the given assumptions.
Example 2.18 Assume that V and U are normed spaces and f : V →U is a continuous mapping,
and assume that X ⊂V is a compact subset. Show that the image f(X) ⊂U is compact.
Show that a real function attains both maximum and minimum on a compact set.
There are several deﬁnitions of compactness.
We shall here use sequential compactness, which is
deﬁned by X being sequential compact, if every sequence on X has a convergent subsequence.
We shall prove that if f : V →U is continuous, and X ⊂V is compact, then the image f(X) ⊂U is
also compact.
Let (yn) ⊂f(X) be any sequence on the image f(X). There exists a sequence (xn) ⊂X, such that
yn = f(xn) for every n ∈N. Since X is compact, (xn) has a convergent subsequence (x′
n) ⫅(xn),
where x′
n →x0 ∈X for n →+∞.
Now, f is continuous at x0 ∈X, so to every ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0, such that
∥f(x′
n) −f(x0)∥U < ε
for ∥x′
n −x0∥V < δ.

Then (x′
n) →x0 implies that there exists an n0 ∈N, such that
∥x′
n −x0∥V < δ
for all n ≥n0.
We have for the same n0 that
∥f(x′
n) −f(x0)∥U < ε
for all n ≥n0,
which means that (f(x′
n)) converges towards f(x0), thus every sequence (yn) = (f(xn)) ⫅f(X) has
s convergent subsequence (y′
n) = (f(x′
n)). Note for the limit point that f(x0) ∈f(X).
Assume that f : X →R is continuous, where X is a compact subset of a normed space. It follows
from the above that f(X) ⫅R is compact, thus closed and bounded in R. In particular, f has both
a maximum value and a minimum value.

2) It is well-known that the claim does not hold in the simplest possible Banach space (R, |·|), because
there exist conditional convergent series like e.g.

Example 2.21 Let (V, ∥· ∥) denote a normed space.
Let V ′ denote the set of all bounded linear
functionals on (V, ∥· ∥). The set V ′ is organized as a vector space by the operations
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x),
for all x ∈V,
(αf)(x) = α f(x),
for all x ∈V,
and we introduce a norm on V ′ by
∥f∥′ =

∥x∥≤1
|f(x)|.
Prove that (V ′, ∥· ∥′) is a Banach space. It is called the dual space V .
We shall ﬁrst show that ∥· ∥′ is a norm on V ′. It is obvious that ∥f∥′ ≥0. If ∥f∥′ = 0, then
sup
∥x∥≤1
|f(x)| = 0.
Then we have

It follows from f(0) = 0 that f(x) = 0 for every x ∈V , thus f ≡0. Furthermore,
∥αf∥′ = sup

|αf(x)| = |α| · sup

∥x∥≤1
|fn(x) −fm(x)| < ε
for all m, n ≥N,
i.e. we have for every x, for which ∥x∥≤1 that (fn(x)) is a Cauchy sequence in C, hence convergent.
For any x ̸= 0 it follows that

then we have deﬁned a functional on V for which in particular f(0) = 0. It remains only to prove
that 1) f is linear, and at 2) f is bounded. However,
f(x + λy) =
lim
n→+∞fn(x + λy) =
lim
n→+∞{fn(x) + λfn(y)} = f(x) + λf(y),
proving the linearity. Then

Choose n, such that for all m ≥n,
∥fn −fm∥′ = sup
∥x∥≤1
|fn(x) −fm(x)| < 1.
Then fm(x) ∈B(fn(x), 1) for every x, for which ∥x∥≤1. Since fm(x) →f(x) for m →+∞, we have
f(x) ∈B(fn(x), 1), so |fn(x) −f(x)| ≤1 for all x, for which ∥x∥≤1. From this we infer that
sup
∥x∥≤1
|f(x) −fn(x)| ≤1.
Therefore, if n is chosen as above, then it follows from (11) that ∥f∥′ ≤1+∥fn∥′, hence f is bounded,
and we have proved that every Cauchy sequence on V ′ is convergent, i.e. V ′ is a Banach space.

Example 2.23 Prove that if f : R →R is monotonous, then f has at most countably many points of
discontinuity.
We may assume that f is increasing, thus f(x) ≥f(y) for x > y. We may even restrict ourselves to
the interval [0, 1], because the number of intervals of the form [n, n + 1], n ∈Z, is countable. This
means that we may assume that f(x) = 0 for x ≤0, and f(x) = 1 for x ≥1.
Let {xj | j ∈J} be the set of all points of discontinuity in [0, 1]. Then to any xj we can ﬁnd an
interval Ij with interior points on the Y -axis, such that f(x) /∈Ij for all x ∈[0, 1], i.e. one jumps over
the values in Ij over.
Every Ij can be “numbered” by a rational number qj ∈Ij, because Q is dense in R. This means that
{xj | j ∈J} contains just as many elements, as there are diﬀerent elements in
{qj | j ∈J} ⫅Q.
Now, Q is countable, so {qj | j ∈J} is countable, and thus {xj | j ∈J} is at most countable.
Deﬁne

Then f is monotonous of the countably many points of discontinuity
 1
n
 n ∈N \ {1}

, showing
that there exist monotonous functions with a countable number of points of discontinuity.
An alternative proof is the following: We may as before assume that f is increasing on the interval
[0, 1] with f(x) = 0 for x ≤0 and f(x) = 1 for x ≥1.
If x0 is a point of discontinuity, then f(x) ≤f(x0) for every x ≤x0. Hence, if xn ↗x0, then (f(xn))
is an increasing bounded sequence of numbers, so (f(xn)) is convergent with the limit value c.
Let yn ↗x0 be another such sequence of numbers. Then (f(yn)) →c′. We shall prove that c = c′.
This is done indirectly.
Assume (e.g.) that c < c′, and let 0 < ε < c′ −c. Corresponding to this ε there exists an N, such that
|c′ −f(yn)| = c′ −f(yn) < ε
for all n ≥N.

2. Banach spaces
To any yn we can ﬁnd an xm, such that yn < xm < x0, hence
f(yn) ≤f(xm)
[≤c].
Then it follows that
ε < |c′ −c| = c′ −c = c′ −f(yn) + f(yn) −c < ε + f(yn) −c,
so f(yn) −c > 0, and we have come to the contradiction
c < f(yn) ≤f(xm) ≤c
for n ≥N.
We therefore conclude that c′ = c.
Since the limit value is the same, no matter how xn ↗x0 is chosen, we conclude that
c =
lim
x→x0−f(x).
We prove in a similar way that limx→x0+ f(x) exists, and that these two values are diﬀerent at any
point of discontinuity.
Deﬁne the jump at a point of discontinuity x0 as
σ0 =
lim
x→x0+ f(x) −
lim
x→x0−f(x) > 0.
If x0 < x1 are both points of discontinuity, then it follows from that the function is monotonous that
lim
x→x0+ f(x) ≤
lim
x→x1−f(x).
Let {xj | j ∈J} denote the set of point of discontinuity in [0, 1]. The image is contained in [0, 1],
hence

xj
σj ≤1,
and the sum is ﬁnite. Every σj > 0, so the sum is at most countable, thus J ⫅N, and the claim is
proved.

Example 2.27 Let
F = {f ∈C2([0, 1]) | f(0) = f(1) = 0} ⫅L2([0, 1]).
1) Show that ∥f ′∥2 ≤∥f∥· ∥f ′′∥for f ∈F.
2) Let f ∈F. Show that |f(x)| ≤∥f ′∥√x for 0 ≤x ≤1, and deduce that
∥f∥≤

3) Show that for f ∈C2([0, 1]) with f(0) = f(1) we have
∥f ′∥≤

4) Show by a counterexample that the result from question (3) is not valid for general f ∈C 2([0, 1]).
1) We deduce from f ∈C2([0, 1]) and f(0) = f(1) = 0 and a partial integration, followed by an
application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality that

If ∥f ′∥2 = 0, the inequality is obvious.
If ∥f ′∥2 > 0, we obtain the inequality when we divide by |f ′∥2.
We derived the above by assuming that f ∈F, thus f(0) = f(1) = 1.
Now, let f(0) = f(1) = c. Then f(x) −c ∈F, hence
∥f ′∥2 = ∥(f −x)′∥2 ≤
1
√
2 ∥(f −c)′′}2 =

√
2 ∥f ′′∥2 .
4) Finally, let f(x) = a x. Then f ′(x) = a and f ′′(x) = 0, hence
∥f ′∥2 = |a|
og
∥f ′′∥2 = 0,
and the inequality is not fulﬁlled for any a ̸= 0.
Example 2.28 1) Let 1 ≤p ≤q ≤∞. Show that ℓp ⊂ℓq.
2) Let 1 ≤r < p < 2r and assume that the sequence (xn) satisﬁes

n=1
n |xn|p < ∞.
Show that (xn) ∈ℓr.
1) If (xn) ∈ℓp, then +∞
n=1 |xn|p < +∞. In particular, xn →0 for n →+∞, hence there exists an
N ∈N, such that |xn| < 1 for all n ≥N + 1.

Let 0 < s < 1. We shall somehow way apply H¨older’s inequality with ˜p = 1

By the assumption, the former factor is ﬁnite for every s ∈]0, 1[. The task is to choose s in this

First note that ∥x∥= ∥x∥p, where p = 1
2 < 1.
The ﬁrst two conditions of a norm are trivially fulﬁlled, so we shall only consider the triangle inequality.
We shall prove that it is not satisﬁed. It suﬃces to ﬁnd two vectors x and y, for which the triangle
inequality does not hold.
Choose x = (1, 0) and y = (0, 1). Then ∥x∥= ∥y∥= 1, and
∥x + y∥= ∥(1, 1)∥= (

hence
∥x + y∥= 4 > 2 = ∥x∥+ ∥y∥,
and the triangle inequality is not fulﬁlled, and ∥· ∥is not a norm.

Figure 5: The unit “ball” corresponding to ∥· ∥.
Remark 2.3 It is not hard to prove that if ∥·∥is a norm, then the corresponding unit ball is convex.
(However, not every convex set will induce a norm).
Since the set, which should be the unit ball clearly is not convex (cf. the ﬁgure), ∥· ∥is not a norm.
♦
Remark 2.4 Even if ∥· ∥1
2 is not a norm in the usual sense, there exist some applications of it,
e.g. in the theory of Hp spaces in Complex Function Theory, and the “norm” of such functions can
nevertheless be given a reasonable interpretation.♦

Bounded operators
Example 3.1 Let T be a linear operator from a normed space V into a normed space W.
Show that the image T(V ) is a subspace of W.
Show that the kernel (or null-space) [ker(T) is a subspace of V .
If T is bounded, is it true that T(V ) and/or ker(T) are closed?
1) Let w1, w2 ∈T(V ) ⫅W, and let λ be a scalar. We shall prove that
w1 + λw2 ∈T(V ).
Remark 3.1 It is here of paramount importance that the ﬁeld of the scalars is the same both
places. If e.g. T : V →W is given by
Tx = x + i · 0,
where V = (R, +, ·, ∥· ∥, R) and W = (C, +, ·, ∥· ∥, C), then T is linear, and T(V ) is a subspace of
the 2-dimensional space (C, +, ·, ∥·∥, R) over R. It is, however, not a subspace of the 1-dimensional
space W = (C, +, ·, ∥· ∥, C) over C, so the claim is not true in this case. ♦
It follows from the assumption w1, w2 ∈T(V ) that there exist v1 and v2 ∈V , such that w1 = Tv1
and w2 = Tv2.
If we put v = v1 + λv2 ∈V , then
T(V ) ∋Tv = T(v1 + λv2) = Tv1 + λ Tv2 = w1 + λ w2.
2) Now ker(T) = {v ∈V | Tv = 0}, and T is linear. Hence, if v1, v2 ∈ker(T), and λ is a scalar, then
T(v1 + λv2) = Tv1 + λ Tv2 = 0 + λ · 0 = 0,
thus v1 + λ v2 ∈ker(T), and ker(T) is a subspace.
3) If T is bounded, then T is continuous. Now {0} ⊂W is closed, so ker(T) = T ◦−1({0}) is closed.
On the other hand, T(V ) need not be closed, which is demonstrated by the example below.
Choose V = W = C0([0, 1]) with the norm ∥· ∥∞, and let T : V →W be given by
Tf(t) =
" t
0
f(s) dx,
t ∈[0, 1].
Then T is bounded,
|Tf(t)| =

3. Bounded operators
Furthermore,
T(V ) = {w ∈C1([0, 1]) | w(0) = 0}
is dense in
{w ∈C0([0, 1]) | w(0) = 0} ⊂W,
without being equal to it.
That T(V ) is dense, is seen in the following way: Every polynomial of constant term 0 lies in
T(V ). The claim then follows by a suitable variant of Weierstraß’s Approximation Theorem.
There exist of course C0-functions which are not of class C1, hence T(V ) is not equal to the
smallest closed subspace
{w ∈C0([0, 1]) | w(0) = 0}
which contains T(V ) (because T(V ) is dense in this space).
Example 3.2 In the Banach space ℓp, 1 ≤p ≤∞, we have a sequence (xn) converging to an element
x, where
xn = (xn1, xn2, . . . )
and
x = (x1, x2, . . . ).
Show that if xn →x in ℓp, then xnk →xk for all k ∈N.
If xnk →xk for all k ∈N, is it true that xn →x in ℓp?
Let xn →x in ℓp, 1 ≤p < ∞, thus ∥x −xn∥p →0 for n →∞, i.e.
∞

k=1
|xk −xnk|p = ∥x −xn∥p
p →0
for n →∞.
If p = ∞, then xn →x in ℓ∞means that
∥x −xn∥∞= sup
k
|xk −xnk| →0
for n →∞.
In both cases we get for every ﬁxed k that
|xk −xnk| ≤∥x −xn∥p →0
for n →∞,
thus xnk →xk for n →∞, and the ﬁrst claim is proved.
On the other hand, if xnk →xk for every ﬁxed k, then we cannot conclude that xn →x in ℓp. Just
choose
xn = (δnk) = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . )
with 1 on place number n, and 0 otherwise.

We have for this sequence that xnk →0 for every ﬁxed k, thus x = 0.
On the other hand,
∥xn∥p = ∥xn −0∥p =


k=1
|δnk|p

p

for 1 ≤p < +∞,
and
∥xn∥∞= ∥xn −0∥∞= 1,
so none of these sequences converges towards, i.e. the sequence does not converge in any ℓp, 1 ≤p ≤
+∞.
Example 3.3 Let T be a linear mapping from Rm to Rn, both equipped with the 2-norm. Let (aij)

that V is ﬁnite dimensional. Show that T must be bounded.

Indirect proof. Assume that (12) does not hold, i.e. assume that
(13) ∀N ∈N ∃λN,1, . . . , λN,n :
n

j=1
|λN,j| > N
------
n

j=1
λN,jej
------
V
.
Due to the homogeneity we may assume that λN,j is chosen, such that
n

j=1
|λN,j| = 1.
Then it follows from (13) that ∥vN∥V ≤1
N , hence
vN =
n

j=1
λN,jej →0
for N →∞.
Now, e1, . . . , en is a basis for V , hence λN,j →0 for N →∞for every j = 1, . . . , n. In particular,
there is an N0 ∈N, such that for every N ≥N0 we have |λN,j| < 1
2n. This gives us the following
contradiction

j=1
|λN,j| <

2n = 1
2.
We have now proved that (13) does not hold, hence (12) holds instead, and as proved previously (12)
implies that T is bounded, and the claim is proved.
Example 3.5 Let T be a linear operator from a ﬁnite dimensional vector space into itself. Show that
T is injective if and only if T is surjective.
Let T : V →V be linear, where dim V = n. Let e1, . . . , en form a basis. Now, T is linear, so T is
injective, if and only if Tu = Tv, i.e. T(u−v) = 0 implies that u = v, or put in another way, u−v = 0.
Thus T is injective, if and only if
(14) Tv = 0
=⇒
v = 0.
Now assume that T is injective. We shall prove that Te1, . . . , Ten ∈V are linearly independent.
Assume that λ1Te1 + · · · + λnTen = 0. Then by the linearity,
0 = λ1Te1 + · · · + λnTen = T (λ1e1 + · · · + λnen) ,
and we conclude using (14) that
λ1e1 + · · · + λnen = 0.
Since e1, . . . , en is a basis for V , we must have λ1 = · · · = λn = 0, and it follows that Te1, . . . , Ten
are n linearly independent vectors in the image T(V ). Then
n ≥dim T(V ) ≥n,
thus
dim T(V ) = n,

3. Bounded operators
hence T(V ) = V , and we have proved that T is surjective.
Assume conversely that T is surjective. To the basis formed by e1, . . . , en ∈V corresponds the vectors
f1, . . . , fn ∈V , where
Tf1 = e1,
. . . ,
Tfn = en.
If λ1f1 + · · · + λnfn = 0, then we conclude that
0 = T (λ1f1 + · · · + λnfn) = λ1Tf1 + · · · + λnTfn = λ1e1 + · · · + λnen.
Using again that e1, . . . , en form a basis for V , we infer that λ1 = · · · = λn = 0, which again implies
that f1, . . . , fn form a basis for V .
If v = λ1f1 + · · · + λnfn satisﬁes Tv = 0, then
0 = Tv = T(λ1f1 + · · · + λnfn) = λ1Tf1 + · · · + λnTfn = λ1e1 + · · · + λnen,
and we infer again that λ1 = · · · = λn = 0, hence v = 0, and (14) is fulﬁlled, so T is injective.
Example 3.6 Let T be the linear mapping from C∞(R) into itself given by Tf = f ′.
Show that T is surjective?
Is T injective?
Let f ∈C∞(R). Deﬁne g ∈C∞(R) by
g(t) =
" t
0
f(s) ds,
t ∈R.
Clearly, Tg = g, so T(V ) = C∞(R), and T is surjective.
Deﬁne instead
g1(t) = 1 +
" t
0
f(s) ds = 1 + g(t) ∈C∞(R).
Then
Tg1 = f = Tg,
and since g1 ̸= g, it follows that T is not injective.

Example 3.7 Let I = [a, b] be a bounded interval and consider the linear mapping T from C([a, b])
into itself, given by
Tf(t) =

f(s) ds.
We assume that C([a, b]) is equipped with the sup-norm.
Show that T is bounded and ﬁnd ∥T∥.
Show that T is injective and ﬁnd T −1 : T(C([a, b])) →C([a, b]).
Is T −1 bounded?
When
Tf(t) =
" t
a
f(s) ds
for t ∈[a, b],
then
|Tf(t)| =

" t

" t
a
|f(s)| ds ≤∥f∥∞
" t
a
ds = (t −a)∥f∥∞≤(b −a) · ∥f∥∞,
thus
∥Tf∥∞≤(b −a) · ∥f∥∞,
proving that T is bounded and ∥T∥≤b −a.
Choose f(t) = 1 for every t ∈[a, b]. Then ∥f∥∞= 1, and
Tf(t) =
" t
a
ds = t −a
for t ∈[a, b],
hence
∥Tf∥∞= sup
t∈[a,b]
(t −a) = b −a,
and we conclude that ∥T∥≥b −a, whence by the previously proved result, ∥T∥= b −a.
Assume that
Tf(t) =
" t
a
f(s) ds ≡0.
Since f ∈C([a, b]), we have Tf ∈C1([a, b]) with
d
dt Tf(t) = f(t) ≡0,
which shows that f ≡0, so T is injective.
It follows from the above that T(C([a, b])) ⫅C1([a, b]). We get from Tf(a) = 0 that even
T(C([a, b])) ⫅{g ∈C1([a, b]) | g(a) = 0}.

3. Bounded operators
Conversely, if g ∈C1([a, b]) and g(a) = 0, then f = g′ ∈C([a, b]), and Tf = g, and the image becomes
T(C([a, b])) = {g ∈C1([a, b]) | g(a) = 0}.
Finally, it is immediately seen that
T −1 : T(C([a, b])) →C([a, b])
is given by T −1g = g′.
The operator T −1 is not bounded. We have e.g. that (t −a)n ∈T(C([a, b])), and
∥(t −a)n∥∞= sup
t∈[a,b]
|(t −a)n| = (b −a)n.
It follows from T −1(t −a)n = n(t −a)n−1 that
∥T −1(t −a)n∥∞= n(b −a)n−1 =
n
b −a ∥(t −a)n∥∞,
proving that there is no constant c > 0, such that
∥T −1f∥∞≤c ∥f∥∞,
for all f ∈T(C([a, b])),
and T is not bounded.

3. Bounded operators
Example 3.8 Let T be a bounded linear operator from a normed vector space V into a normed vector
space W, and assume that T is surjective. Assume that there is a c > 0, such that
∥Tx∥≥c ∥x∥
for all x ∈V.
show that T −1 exists and that T −1 ∈B(W, V ).
We require that T −1 exists, so we shall ﬁrst prove that T is injective, i.e. if Tx = Ty, then x = y.
The mapping T is linear, so this is equivalent with that T(x −y) = 0 implies that x −y = 0, or by a
slight change of notation:
Assume that Tx = 0. Prove that x = 0.
When Tx = 0, then it follows from the assumption that
0 ≤∥x∥≤1
c ∥Tx∥= 0,
thus ∥x| = 0, hence x = 0,
and the claim is proved.
We have proved that T is injective, thus T −1 exists. Now T(V ) = W, so T −1 : W →V , and T −1 is
deﬁned on all of W. It remains only to be proved that T −1 is bounded.
Let y ∈W. Then x = T −1y is deﬁned. It follows from the assumption that
∥T −1y∥= ∥x∥≤1
c ∥Tx∥= 1
c ∥T(T −1y)∥= 1
c ∥y∥,
which shows that T −1 is bounded, ∥T −1∥≤1
c , and it follows that T −1 ∈B(W, V ).
Example 3.9 Let V and W be two normed spaces. Prove that B(V, W) is a normed vector space and
that B(V, W) is a Banach space, if W is a Banach space.
It is well-known that B(V, W) is a vector space.
Deﬁne ∥T∥by
∥T∥= sup{∥Tx∥W | ∥x∥V ≤1}.
Then clearly, ∥T∥≥0. If T ̸= 0, then there exists an x ∈V , such that Tx ̸= 0, and we conclude that
∥T∥= 0, if and only if T = 0.
Furthermore,
∥αT∥= sup{∥α Tx∥W | ∥x∥V ≤1} = |α| · sup{∥Tx∥W | ∥x∥V ≤1} = |α| · ∥T∥.
Finally,
∥T1 + T2∥
=
sup{∥(T1 + T2)x∥W | ∥x∥V ≤1} ≤sup{∥Tx∥W + ∥T2x∥W | ∥x∥V ≤1}
≤
sup{∥T1x∥W | ∥x∥V ≤1} + sup{∥T2x∥W | ∥x∥V ≤1} = ∥T1∥+ ∥T2∥,
and we have proved that ∥· ∥is a norm on B(V, W), and B(V, W) is a normed vector space.

3. Bounded operators
We now assume that W is a Banach space, thus every Cauchy sequence on W is convergent. We shall
prove that B(V, W) becomes a Banach space with the norm introduced above. Let (Tn) be a Cauchy
sequence on B(V, W), i.e.
∀ε > 0 ∃N ∈N ∀m, n ≥N : ∥Tm −Tn∥< ε.
Then it follows from the deﬁnition that
∥Tm −Tn∥= sup{∥(Tm −Tn)x∥W | ∥x∥V ≤1} = sup{∥Tm −Tnx∥W | ∥x∥V ≤1} < ε.
In particular, we have for every x ∈V , for which ∥x∥V ≤1 that
∀ε > 0 ∃N ∈N ∀m, n ≥N : ∥Tmx −Tnx∥W < ε,
which is the condition for (Tnx) being a Cauchy sequence on W. We assumed that W was a Banach
space, so it is complete. This implies that (Tnx) is convergent, and it follows that (Tn(λx)) = (λ Tnx)
is also convergent in W for every λ, and the condition ∥x∥V ≤1 has become superﬂuous.
Deﬁne an operator T : V →W by
Tx =
lim
n→+∞Tnx,
x ∈V.
Then
T(x + λy) =
lim
n→+∞Tn(x + λy) =
lim
n→+∞{Tnx + λTny} =
lim
n→+∞Tnx + λ
lim
n→+∞Tny = Tx + λ Ty,
which shows that T is linear.
It remains to be proved that T ∈B(V, W), i.e. that T is bounded. If x ∈V with ∥x∥V ≤1, then
∥Tx∥=
---- lim
n→+∞Tnx
---- ≤sup
n∈N
∥Tnx∥≤sup
n∈N
∥Tn∥.
Since (Tn) is a Cauchy sequence, we have supn∈N ∥Tn∥< +∞, and we conclude that T ∈B(V, W).
Thus we have proved that the Cauchy sequence (Tn) ⫅B(V, W) converges towards T ∈B(V, W), and
we have proved that B(V, W) is a Banach space.
Example 3.10 Let S, T ∈B(V, V ). Prove that the composite mapping ST (deﬁned by (ST)x =
S(Tx) for x ∈V ) belongs to B(V, V ), and that
∥ST∥≤∥S∥· ∥T∥.
When S, T ∈B(V, V ), the composition ST is deﬁned (and linear) on all of V . We shall only prove
that ST is bounded. Now, for every x ∈V ,
∥(ST)x∥V = ∥S(Tx)∥V ≤∥S∥· ∥Tx∥V ≤∥S∥· ∥T∥· ∥x∥V ,
so
∥ST∥= sup{∥(ST)x∥V | ∥x∥V ≤1} ≤sup{∥S∥· ∥T∥· ∥x∥V | ∥x∥V ≤1} = ∥S∥· ∥T∥.

3. Bounded operators
Example 3.11 Let V be a Banach space and let T ∈B(V ) be such that T −1 exists and belongs to
B(V ).
Show that if ∥T∥and
--T −1 ≤1, then
∥T∥=
--T −1 = 1,
and ∥Tf∥= ∥f∥for all f ∈V .
It follows from the assumptions that T is bijective,
(15) Tf = g,
T −1g = f.
We ﬁrst prove that
∥Tf∥= ∥f∥
for every f ∈V.
This follows from
∥Tf∥≤∥T∥· ∥f∥= ∥f∥=
--T −1f
-- ≤
--T −1-- · ∥g∥= ∥g∥= ∥Tf∥.
Hence we must have equality everywhere, and in particular,
∥Tf∥= ∥f∥
for all f ∈V,
and
--T −1g
-- = ∥g∥
for all g ∈V.
Finally, we get
∥T∥=

{∥Tf∥| ∥f∥= 1} = sup{∥f∥| ∥f∥= 1} = 1,
and
--T −1-- = sup{∥T −1g∥| ∥g∥= 1} = sup{∥g∥| ∥g∥= 1} = 1.
Example 3.12 Let H denote a Hilbert space and let T ∈B(H) and assume that there is a positive c
such that
|(Tx, x)| ≥c ∥x∥2
for all x ∈H.
Show that T −1 exists and belongs to B(H).
Assume that Tx = 0. Then
0 = |(Tx, x)| ≥c ∥x∥2 ≥0,
from which we conclude that x = 0, and we have proved that T is injective, so T −1 exists.

3. Bounded operators
If x = T −1y for some y ∈H, then it follows from the estimate
c ∥x∥2 = c
--T −1y
--2 ≤
(y, T −1y)
 ≤∥y∥·
--T −1y
-- ,
that
--T −1-- ≤1
c , so T −1 is bounded on the image T(H).
It remains to prove that the image T(H) is all of H. Let x ⊥T(H). Then we get again that
0 = |(Tx, x)| ≥c ∥x∥2,
which proves that x = 0 is the only vector, which is perpendicular to the image, so T(H) = H. Since
T −1 is bounded, it has a continuous extension to T(H) = H, and it follows that T −1 ∈B(H).

Example 3.13 Let p > 1 and let f(x, t) ≥0 be a (measurable) function on R2 such that

ﬁrst for p > 1, and then for p = 1.
3) Let g ∈Lp(R) and h ∈L1(R). We deﬁne the convolution g ⋆h by
g ⋆h(t) =

R
g(t −x) h(x) dx.
Show that convolution with an L1(R)-function is a linear and bounded mapping from Lp(R) into
Lp(R) for any p > 1.

2) We may of course assume that f(x, t) ≥0, because we can in general replace f by |f|, which gives
a more “narrow” estimate. Then we can use the result from 1.

3) Given h ∈L1(R)- Deﬁne an operator T by
Tg(x) = g ⋆h(x),
for the g ∈Lp(R), p > 1, for which this expression makes sense. Then clearly, T is linear.
Let g ∈Lp(R). Using 2) above we get the following estimate, where we allow ourselves to write
∥g ⋆h∥before we have proved that it makes sense,
∥Tg∥p
