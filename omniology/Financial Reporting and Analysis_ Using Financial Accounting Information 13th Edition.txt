Preface
T
his book teaches financial accounting from both the user’s and the preparer’s perspec-
tives. It includes the language and the preparation of financial statements. Reliance is
placed on actual annual reports, 10-Ks, and proxy statements. Sufficient background
material is included, facilitating its use for students who do not have prior courses in
accounting or finance.
Tell me, I’ll forget.
Show me, I may remember.
Involve me, I’ll understand.
This proverb describes the approach of this book—involving students in actual financial
statements and their analysis and interpretation. Its premise is that students are better pre-
pared to understand and analyze real financial reports when learning is not based on over-
simplified financial statements.
From this basic premise come the many changes to this edition. Those changes, sup-
ported by our technology tools, focus on the goal of this text, which is to involve students in
actively learning how to read, understand, and analyze the financial statements of actual
companies. These changes are discussed in this preface.
Significant Items
The following notable items are available in this edition to increase its relevance to students
and its flexibility for instructors:
1. Coverage of ethics has been expanded.
2. International accounting has been updated to reflect the substantial changes that have
taken place. This includes model financial statements.
3. Internet exercises have been updated and new exercises added.
4. Questions have been updated and new questions added.
5. Problems have been updated and new problems added.
6. Where appropriate, cases have been updated and new cases added. This includes more
than 70 revised and new cases.
7. Exhibits and cases are extensively based on real companies to which students would
relate.

• Access to Thomson ONE—Business School Edition™This high-tech feature is available
with every new book. This access to a version of the professional research tool allows
students to become familiar with the software that is used in practice. Chapter cases on
the text Web site, for every chapter with the exception of Chapter 13, walk users step-
by-step through those databases as they learn how to access financial information cov-
ered in the text. Thomson ONE—Business School Edition provides information on 500
companies, combining a full range of fundamental financials, earnings estimates, market
data, and source documents with powerful functionality.
Market index information is available for a variety of indexes. The database gives
you the ability to compare firms against their peers in a portfolio context. There are
detailed historical and current financial statements from several different sources. Also
available as summary information is financial ratio analysis. Historical stock price infor-
mation and analysis, along with earnings estimates, is presented. Both fundamental and
technical financial analysis is provided. Recent news reports are available. Filings the
company has made with the SEC, such as 10-K and 10-Q, are also available.
The Thomson ONE—Business School Edition provides information on market
indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor’s 500.
It also provides a powerful and customizable report-writing function that enables you
to develop custom financial reports for the firm.
• FinSAS Financial Statement Analysis Spreadsheets (by Donald V. Saftner, University of
Toledo) allow students to perform analysis on any set of financial statements using the
ratios covered in the text. Users enter income statement, balance sheet, and other data
for two to five years. The result is a 2- to 5-year ratio comparison by liquidity, long-term
debt-paying ability, profitability, and investor analysis. The result also includes
common-size analysis of the income statement (horizontal and vertical) and common-
size analysis of the balance sheet (horizontal and vertical). Downloadable in Excel® from
the product Web site through CengageBrain.com, FinSAS can save users hours of num-
ber crunching, allowing them to concentrate on analysis and interpretation.
• Flexible (by Donald V. Saftner, University of Toledo) is designed to accompany and
complement FinSAS. Flexible allows for common-size analysis (horizontal and vertical)
of any financial schedule as well as statements. Flexible can be used to analyze financial
statements (common-size) in a different format (user-defined) from the format of Fin-
SAS. Downloadable in Excel® from the product Web site through CengageBrain.com,
like FinSAS, Flexible can save users hours of number crunching, allowing them to con-
centrate on analysis and interpretation.
Actual Companies
The text explains financial reporting differences among industries, including manufacturing,
retailing, service firms, and regulated and nonregulated industries. The text also covers
personal financial reports and financial reporting for governments and other not-for-profit
institutions.
Statements of actual companies are used in illustrations, cases, and “To the Net” cases.
The actual financial statements highlight current financial reporting problems, including
guidelines for consolidated statements, stock-based compensation, postretirement benefits,
and the harmonization of international accounting standards.
Extensive Use of One Firm
An important feature of this text is the extensive use of one firm, Nike, Inc., as an illustra-
tion. By using Nike’s 2011 financial report and industry data, readers become familiar with
a typical competitive market and a meaningful example for reviewing financial statement
analysis as a whole. (See Chapters 6 through 10 and Summary Analysis—Nike, Inc.)

Flexible Organization
This text is used in a variety of courses with a variety of approaches. It provides the flexibil-
ity necessary to meet the needs of accounting and finance courses varying in content and
length. Sufficient text, questions, “To the Net” Web site cases, problem materials and cases
are presented to allow the instructor latitude in the depth of coverage. Access to Thomson
ONE—Business School Edition™is also included with every new book. Accounting princi-
ples are the basis for all discussion so that students can understand the methods used as well
as the implication for analysis. The following is an outline of our chapter coverage:
Chapter 1 develops the basic principles of accounting on which financial reports are based.
A review of the evolution of GAAP and the traditional assumptions of the accounting model
helps the reader understand the statement and thus allows for a better analysis. An extensive
review of harmonization of international accounting standards in included. Also included is
financial reporting for small and medium sized entities (SMEs).
Chapter 2 describes the forms of business entities and introduces financial reports. This
chapter also reviews the sequence of accounting procedures completed during each account-
ing period. It includes other financial reporting topics that contribute to the understanding
of financial reporting, such as the auditor’s report, management’s discussion, management’s
responsibility for financial statements, and summary annual report. The efficient market
hypotheses, ethics, consolidated statements, accounting for business combinations, and the
SEC-paper filings-Edgar-XBRL are also covered.
Chapter 3 presents an in-depth review of the balance sheet, statement of stockholders’ eq-
uity, and problems in balance sheet presentation. This chapter gives special emphasis to
inventories and tangible assets. A model IFRS balance sheet has been included. Also included
are subsequent events.
Chapter 4 presents an in-depth review of the income statement, including special income
statement items. Other topics included are earnings per share, retained earnings, dividends
and stock splits, legality of distribution to stockholders, and comprehensive income. A model
IFRS balance sheet has been included.
Chapter 5 is an introduction to analysis and comparative statistics. Techniques include ratio
analysis, common-size analysis, year-to-year change analysis, financial statement variations
by type of industry, review of descriptive information, comparisons including Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual, and North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS), relative size of firm, and many library sources of industry data.
Chapter 6 covers short-term liquidity. This chapter includes suggested procedures for analyzing
short-term assets and the short-term debt-paying ability for an entity. This chapter discusses, in
detail, four very important assets: cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inven-
tory. It is the first to extensively use Nike as an illustration.
Chapter 7 covers long-term debt-paying ability. This includes the income statement considera-
tion and the balance sheet consideration. Topics include long-term leasing, pension plans, joint
ventures, contingences, financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, financial instruments
with concentrations of credit risk, and disclosures about fair value of financial instruments.
Chapter 8 covers the analysis of profitability, which is a vital concern to stockholders, cred-
itors, and management. Besides profitability ratios, this chapter covers trends in profitability,
segment reporting, gains and losses from prior period adjustments, comprehensive income,
pro forma financial information, and interim reports.
Chapter 9, though not intended as a comprehensive guide to investment analysis, introduces
analyses useful to investors. Besides ratios, this chapter covers leverage and its effect on earn-
ings, earnings per share, stock-based compensations, and stock appreciation rights.
Chapter 10 reviews the statement of cash flows, including ratios that relate to this statement.
This chapter also covers procedures for developing the statement of cash flows.

nancial ratios, the degree of conservatism and quality of earnings, forecasting financial fail-
ure, and analytical review procedures, management’s use of analysis, use of LIFO reserves,
graphing financial information, management of earnings, and valuation.
Chapter 12 covers problems in analyzing six specialized industries: banks, utilities, oil and
gas, transportation, insurance, and real estate. The chapter notes the differences in state-
ments and suggests changes or additions to their analysis.
Chapter 13 covers personal financial statements and financial reporting for governments
and other not-for-profit institutions.
A very extensive glossary defines terms explained in the text and terms frequently found in
annual reports and the financial literature. The text also includes a bibliography of referen-
ces that can be used in exploring further topics in the text.

Chapter

Introduction to Financial
Reporting
U
sers of financial statements include a company’s managers, stockholders, bondhold-
ers, security analysts, suppliers, lending institutions, employees, labor unions, regula-
tory authorities, and the general public. These are internal and external stakeholder
groups. They use the financial reports to make decisions. For example, potential investors
use the financial reports as an aid in deciding whether to buy the stock. Suppliers use the fi-
nancial reports to decide whether to sell merchandise to a company on credit. Labor unions
use the financial reports to help determine their demands when they negotiate for employees.
Management could use the financial reports to determine the company’s profitability.
Demand for financial reports exists because users believe that the reports help them in
decision making. In addition to the financial reports, users often consult competing informa-
tion sources, such as new wage contracts and economy-oriented releases.
This book concentrates on using financial accounting information properly. It introduces
a basic understanding of generally accepted accounting principles and traditional assump-
tions of the accounting model. This aids the user in recognizing the limits of financial reports.
The ideas that underlie financial reports have developed over several hundred years. This
development continues today to meet the needs of a changing society. A review of the evolution
of generally accepted accounting principles and the traditional assumptions of the accounting
model should help the reader understand financial reports and thus analyze them better.
Development of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP) in the United States
Generally accepted accounting principles are accounting principles that have substantial au-
thoritative support. The formal process of developing the accounting principles that exist
today in the United States began with the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Prior to these
laws, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which was established in 1792, was the pri-
mary mechanism for establishing specific requirements for the disclosure of financial infor-
mation. These requirements could be described as minimal and only applied to corporations

whose shares were listed on the NYSE. The prevailing view of management was that finan-
cial information was for management’s use.
The stock market crash of 1929 provoked widespread concern about external financial
disclosure. Some alleged that the stock market crash was substantially influenced by the lack
of adequate financial reporting requirements to investors and creditors. The Securities Act of
1933 was designed to protect investors from abuses in financial reporting that developed in
the United States. This Act was intended to regulate the initial offering and sale of securities
in interstate commerce.
In general, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was intended to regulate securities trad-
ing on the national exchanges, and it was under this authority that the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) was created. In effect, the SEC has the authority to determine
GAAP and to regulate the accounting profession. The SEC has elected to leave much of the
determination of GAAP and the regulation of the accounting profession to the private sector.
At times, the SEC will issue its own standards.
Currently, the SEC issues Regulation S-X, which describes the primary formal financial
disclosure requirements for companies. The SEC also issues Financial Reporting Releases
(FRRs) that pertain to financial reporting requirements. Regulation S-X and FRRs are part
of GAAP and are used to give the SEC’s official position on matters relating to financial
statements. The formal process that exists today is a blend of the private and public sectors.
A number of parties in the private sector have played a role in the development of
GAAP. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have had the most influence.
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
The AICPA is a professional accounting organization whose members are certified public
accountants (CPAs). During the 1930s, the AICPA had a special committee working with the
New York Stock Exchange on matters of common interest. An outgrowth of this special com-
mittee was the establishment in 1939 of two standing committees, the Committee on
Accounting Procedures and the Committee on Accounting Terminology. These committees
were active from 1939 to 1959 and issued 51 Accounting Research Bulletins (ARBs). These
committees took a problem-by-problem approach because they tended to review an issue only
when there was a problem related to that issue. This method became known as the brush fire
approach. The committees were only partially successful in developing a well-structured body
of accounting principles. ARBs are part of GAAP unless they have been superseded.
In 1959, the AICPA replaced the two committees with the Accounting Principles Board
(APB) and the Accounting Research Division. The Accounting Research Division provided
research to aid the APB in making decisions regarding accounting principles. Basic postulates
would be developed that would aid in the development of accounting principles, and the entire
process was intended to be based on research prior to an APB decision. However, the APB
and the Accounting Research Division were not successful in formulating broad principles.
The combination of the APB and the Accounting Research Division lasted from 1959 to
1973. During this time, the Accounting Research Division issued 14 Accounting Research Stud-
ies. The APB issued 31 Opinions (APBOs) and 4 Statements (APBSs). The Opinions represented
official positions of the Board, whereas the Statements represented the views of the Board but
not the official opinions. APBOs are part of GAAP unless they have been superseded.
Various sources, including the public, generated pressure to find another way of devel-
oping GAAP. In 1972, a special study group of the AICPA recommended another
approach—the establishment of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The
AICPA adopted these recommendations in 1973.
Financial Accounting Standards Board
The structure of the FASB is as follows: A panel of electors is selected from nine organizations.
They are the AICPA, the Financial Executives Institute, the Institute of Management Account-
ants, the Financial Analysts Federation, the American Accounting Association, the Security
Industry Association, and three not-for-profit organizations. The electors appoint the board
of trustees that governs the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF). There are 16 trustees.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

The FAF appoints the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Council (FASAC) and
the FASB.
The FASAC has approximately 30 members. This relatively large number is designed to
obtain representation from a wide group of interested parties. The FASAC is responsible for
advising the FASB. There are seven members of the FASB. Exhibit 1-1 illustrates the struc-
ture of the FASB.
The FASB issues four types of pronouncements:
1. STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS). These
Statements establish GAAP for specific accounting issues. SFASs are part of GAAP
unless they have been superseded.
2. INTERPRETATIONS. These pronouncements provide clarifications to previously
issued standards, including SFASs, APB Opinions, and Accounting Research Bulletins.
The interpretations have the same authority and require the same majority votes for
passage as standards (a supermajority of five or more of the seven members).
Interpretations are part of GAAP unless they have been superseded.
3. TECHNICAL BULLETINS. These bulletins provide timely guidance on financial
accounting and reporting problems. They may be used when the effect will not cause a
major change in accounting practice for a number of companies and when they do not
conflict with any broad fundamental accounting principle. Technical bulletins are part
of GAAP unless they have been superseded.
4. STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS (SFACs). These
Statements provide a theoretical foundation on which to base GAAP. They are the
output of the FASB’s Conceptual Framework project, but they are not part of GAAP.
Operating Procedure for Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
The process of considering an SFAS begins when the Board elects to add a topic to its techni-
cal agenda. The Board receives suggestions and advice on topics from many sources, includ-
ing the FASAC, the SEC, the AICPA, and industry organizations.
For its technical agenda, the Board considers only “broken” items. In other words, the
Board must be convinced that a major issue needs to be addressed in a new area or an old
issue needs to be reexamined.

The Board must rely on staff members for the day-to-day work on projects. A project is
assigned a staff project manager, and informal discussions frequently take place among Board
members, the staff project manager, and staff. In this way, Board members gain an under-
standing of the accounting issues and the economic relationships that underlie those issues.
On projects with a broad impact, a Discussion Memorandum (DM) or an Invitation to
Comment is issued. A Discussion Memorandum presents all known facts and points of view
on a topic. An Invitation to Comment sets forth the Board’s tentative conclusions on some
issues related to the topic or represents the views of others.
The Discussion Memorandum or Invitation to Comment is distributed as a basis for pub-
lic comment. There is usually a 60-day period for written comments, followed by a public
hearing. A transcript of the public hearing and the written comments become part of the public
record. Then the Board begins deliberations on an Exposure Draft (ED) of a proposed State-
ment of Financial Accounting Standards. When completed, the Exposure Draft is issued for
public comment. The Board may call for written comments only, or it may announce another
public hearing. After considering the written comments and the public hearing comments, the
Board resumes deliberations in one or more public Board meetings. The final Statement must
receive affirmative votes from five of the seven members of the Board. The Rules of Procedure
require dissenting Board members to set forth their reasons in the Statement. Developing a
Statement on a major project generally takes at least two years, and sometimes much longer.
Some people believe that the time should be shortened to permit faster decision making.
The FASB standard-setting process includes aspects of accounting theory and political
aspects. Many organizations, companies, and individuals have input into the process. Some
input is directed toward achieving a standard less than desirable in terms of a strict account-
ing perspective. Often, the result is a standard that is not the best representation of economic
reality.
FASB Conceptual Framework
The Conceptual Framework for Accounting and Reporting was on the agenda of the FASB
from its inception in 1973. The Framework is intended to set forth a system of interrelated
objectives and underlying concepts that will serve as the basis for evaluating existing stand-
ards of financial accounting and reporting.
Under this project, the FASB has established a series of pronouncements, SFACs, that
are intended to provide the Board with a common foundation and the basic reasons for con-
sidering the merits of various alternative accounting principles. SFACs do not establish
GAAP; rather, the FASB eventually intends to evaluate current principles in terms of the con-
cepts established.
To date, the Framework project has issued seven Concepts Statements:
1. STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS NO. 1, “Objectives of
Financial Reporting by Business Enterprises”
2. STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS NO. 2, “Qualitative
Characteristics of Accounting Information”
3. STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS NO. 3, “Elements of
Financial Statements of Business Enterprises”
4. STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS NO. 4, “Objectives of
Financial Reporting by Nonbusiness Organizations”
5. STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS NO. 5, “Recognition
and Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises”
6. STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS NO. 6, “Elements of
Financial Statements” (a replacement of No. 3)
7. STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS NO. 7, “Using Cash
Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements”
Concepts Statement No. 1, issued in 1978, deals with identifying the objectives of finan-
cial reporting for business entities and establishes the focus for subsequent concept projects
for business entities. Concepts Statement No. 1 pertains to general-purpose external financial

reporting and is not restricted to financial statements. The following is a summary of the
highlights of Concepts Statement No. 1.1
1. Financial reporting is intended to provide information useful in making business and
economic decisions.
2. The information should be comprehensible to those having a reasonable understanding
of business and economic activities. These individuals should be willing to study the
information with reasonable diligence.
3. Financial reporting should be helpful to users in assessing the amounts, timing, and
uncertainty of future cash flows.
4. The primary focus is on information about earnings and its components.
5. Information should be provided about the economic resources of an enterprise and the
claims against those resources.
Issued in May 1980, “Qualitative Characteristics of Accounting Information” (SFAC
No. 2) examines the characteristics that make accounting information useful for investment,
credit, and similar decisions. Those characteristics of information that make it a desirable
commodity can be viewed as a hierarchy of qualities, with understandability and usefulness
for decision making of most importance (see Exhibit 1-2).
Relevance and reliability, the two primary qualities, make accounting information useful
for decision making. To be relevant, the information needs to have predictive and feedback
value and must be timely. To be reliable, the information must be verifiable, subject to repre-
sentational faithfulness, and neutral. Comparability, which includes consistency, interacts
with relevance and reliability to contribute to the usefulness of information.
The hierarchy includes two constraints. First, to be useful and worth providing, the in-
formation should have benefits that exceed its cost. Second, all of the qualities of informa-
tion shown are subject to a materiality threshold.
SFAC No. 6, “Elements of Financial Statements,” which replaced SFAC No. 3 in 1985,
defines 10 interrelated elements directly related to measuring the performance and financial
status of an enterprise. The 10 elements are defined as follows:2
1. ASSETS. Assets are probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a
particular entity as a result of past transactions or events.
2. LIABILITIES. Liabilities are probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from
present obligations of a particular entity to transfer assets or provide services to other
entities in the future as a result of past transactions or events.
3. EQUITY. Equity is the residual interest in the assets of an entity that remains after
deducting its liabilities:
Equity = Assets −Liabilities
4. INVESTMENTS BY OWNERS. Investments by owners are increases in the equity of a
particular business enterprise resulting from transfers to the enterprise from other
entities of something of value to obtain or increase ownership interests (or equity) in it.
Assets, most commonly received as investments by owners, may also include services or
satisfaction or conversion of liabilities of the enterprise.
5. DISTRIBUTION TO OWNERS. Distribution to owners is a decrease in equity of a
particular business enterprise resulting from transferring assets, rendering services, or
incurring liabilities by the enterprise to owners. Distributions to owners decrease
ownership interest (or equity) in an enterprise.
6. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. Comprehensive income is the change in equity (net
assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances from nonowner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period
except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.
7. REVENUES. Revenues are inflows or other enhancements of assets of an entity or
settlements of its liabilities (or a combination of both) from delivering or producing
goods, rendering services, or carrying out other activities that constitute the entity’s
ongoing major or central operations.

8. EXPENSES. Expenses are outflows or other consumption or using up of assets or
incurrences of liabilities (or a combination of both) from delivering or producing goods,
rendering services, or carrying out other activities that constitute the entity’s ongoing
major or central operations.
9. GAINS. Gains are increases in equity (net assets) from peripheral or incidental
transactions of an entity and from all other transactions and other events and
circumstances affecting the entity during a period except those that result from revenues
or investments by owners.
10. LOSSES. Losses are decreases in equity (net assets) from peripheral or incidental
transactions of an entity and from all other transactions and other events and
circumstances affecting the entity during a period except those that result from expenses
or distributions to owners.
“Objectives of Financial Reporting by Nonbusiness Organizations” (SFAC No. 4) was
completed in 1980. Organizations that fall within the focus of this statement include
churches, foundations, and human-service organizations. Performance indicators for

nonbusiness organizations include formal budgets and donor restrictions. These types of
indicators are not ordinarily related to competition in markets.
Issued in 1984, “Recognition and Measurement in Financial Statements of Business
Enterprises” (SFAC No. 5) indicates that in order to be recognized an item should meet four
criteria, subject to the cost-benefit constraint and materiality threshold:3
1. DEFINITION. The item fits one of the definitions of the elements.
2. MEASURABILITY. The item has a relevant attribute measurable with sufficient
reliability.
3. RELEVANCE. The information related to the item is relevant.
4. RELIABILITY. The information related to the item is reliable.
This concepts statement identifies five different measurement attributes currently used in
practice and recommends the composition of a full set of financial statements for a period.
The following are five different measurement attributes currently used in practice:4
1. Historical cost (historical proceeds)
2. Current cost
3. Current market value
4. Net realizable (settlement) value
5. Present (or discounted) value of future cash flows
This concepts statement probably accomplished little relating to measurement attributes
because a firm, consistent position on recognition and measurement could not be agreed
upon. It states: “Rather than attempt to select a single attribute and force changes in practice
so that all classes of assets and liabilities use that attribute, this concepts statement suggests
that use of different attributes will continue.”5
SFAC No. 5 recommended that a full set of financial statements for a period should
show the following:6
1. Financial position at the end of the period
2. Earnings (net income)
3. Comprehensive income (total nonowner change in equity)
4. Cash flows during the period
5. Investments by and distributions to owners during the period
At the time SFAC No. 5 was issued, financial position at the end of the period and earn-
ings (net income) were financial statements being presented. Comprehensive income, cash
flows during the period, and investments by and distributions to owners during the period
are financial statements (disclosures) that have been subsequently developed. All of these
financial statements (disclosures) will be covered extensively in this book.
SFAC No. 7, issued in February 2000, provides general principles for using present val-
ues for accounting measurements. It describes techniques for estimating cash flows and inter-
est rates and applying present value in measuring liabilities.
The FASB Conceptual Framework for Accounting and Reporting project represents the
most extensive effort undertaken to provide a conceptual framework for financial account-
ing. Potentially, the project can have a significant influence on financial accounting.
Additional Input—American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA)
As indicated earlier, the AICPA played the primary role in the private sector in establishing
GAAP prior to 1973. It continues to play a part, primarily through its Accounting Standards
Division. The Accounting Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC) serves as the official
voice of the AICPA in matters relating to financial accounting and reporting standards.

The Accounting Standards Division has published numerous documents considered as
sources of GAAP. These include Industry Audit Guides, Industry Accounting Guides, and
Statements of Position (SOPs).
Industry Audit Guides and Industry Accounting Guides are designed to assist auditors in
examining and reporting on financial statements of companies in specialized industries, such
as insurance. SOPs were issued to influence the development of accounting standards. Some
SOPs were revisions or clarifications of recommendations on accounting standards con-
tained in Industry Audit Guides and Industry Accounting Guides.
Industry Audit Guides, Industry Accounting Guides, and SOPs were once considered a
lower level of authority than FASB Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, FASB
Interpretations, APB Opinions, and Accounting Research Bulletins. However, since the
Industry Audit Guides, Industry Accounting Guides, and SOPs deal with material not cov-
ered in the primary sources, they, in effect, have become the guide to standards for the areas
they cover. They are part of GAAP unless they have been superseded.
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
The FASB established the EITF in July 1984 to help identify emerging issues affecting report-
ing and problems in implementing authoritative pronouncements. The Task Force has 15
members—senior technical partners of major national CPA firms and representatives of
major associations of preparers of financial statements. The FASB’s Director of Research
and Technical Activities serves as Task Force chairperson. The SEC’s Chief Accountant and
the chairperson of the AICPA’s Accounting Standards Executive Committee participate in
EITF meetings as observers.
The SEC’s Chief Accountant has stated that any accounting that conflicts with the posi-
tion of a consensus of the Task Force would be challenged. Agreement of the Task Force is
recognized as a consensus if no more than two members disagree with a position.
Task Force meetings are held about once every six weeks. Issues come to the Task Force
from a variety of sources, including EITF members, the SEC, and other federal agencies. The
FASB also brings issues to the EITF in response to issues submitted by auditors and pre-
parers of financial statements.
The EITF statements have become a very important source of GAAP. The Task Force
has the capability to review a number of issues within a relatively short time, in contrast to
the lengthy deliberations that go into an SFAS.
EITF statements are considered to be less authoritative than the sources previously dis-
cussed in this chapter. However, since the EITF addresses issues not covered by the other
sources, its statements become important guidelines to standards for the areas they cover.
A New Reality
In November 2001, Enron, one of the largest companies in the United States, recognized in a
federal filing that it had overstated earnings by nearly $600 million since 1997. Within a
month, Enron declared bankruptcy. The Enron bankruptcy probably received more publicity
than any prior bankruptcy in U.S. history. This attention was influenced by the size of
Enron, the role of the auditors, the financial loss of investors, and the losses sustained by
Enron employees. Many Enron employees lost their jobs and their pensions as well. There
were approximately two dozen guilty pleas or convictions in the Enron case including Ken
Lay, former Enron chair. Ken Lay died before he was sentenced; therefore, Judge Sim Lake
erased his convictions.
In June 2002, WorldCom announced that it had inflated profits by $3.8 billion over the
previous five quarters. This represented the largest financial fraud in corporate history. Soon
after the WorldCom fraud announcement, WorldCom declared bankruptcy. (In November
2002, a special bankruptcy court examiner indicated that the restatement would likely
exceed $7.2 billion.) On July 13, 2005, Bernard J. Ebbers, founder and former chief execu-
tive officer (CEO) of WorldCom, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for orchestrating the
biggest corporate accounting fraud in U.S. history.

The WorldCom fraud compelled Congress and President George W. Bush to take action.
Congress, with the support of President Bush, acted swiftly to pass legislation now known as
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act has many provisions and clearly has far-reaching consequences
for financial reporting and the CPA profession. While it is not practical to review the Act in
detail, because of its importance to financial reporting, some additional comments are in
order.
Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 requires companies to document adequate internal controls
and procedures for financial reporting. They must be able to assess the effectiveness of the
internal controls and financial reporting.
Companies have found it difficult to comply with Section 404 for many reasons. Internal
auditing departments have been reduced or eliminated at many companies. Some companies
do not have the personnel to confront complex accounting issues. This lack of adequate
competent personnel to confront complex accounting issues in itself represents an internal
control weakness.
Sarbanes-Oxley makes it an administrative responsibility to have adequate internal con-
trols and procedures in place. Management must acknowledge its responsibility and assert
the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures in writing.
The SEC requires companies to file an annual report on their internal control systems.
The report should contain the following:7
1. A statement of management’s responsibilities for establishing and maintaining an
adequate system
2. Identification of the framework used to evaluate the internal controls
3. A statement as to whether or not the internal control system is effective as of year-end
4. The disclosure of any material weaknesses in the system
5. A statement that the company’s auditors have issued an audit report on management’s
assessment
The financial statements auditor must report on management’s assertion as to the effec-
tiveness of the internal controls and procedures as of the company’s year-end. Sarbanes-
Oxley has changed the relationship between the company and the external auditor. Prior to
Sarbanes-Oxley, some companies relied on the external auditor to determine the accounting
for complex accounting issues. This was a form of conflict of interest, as the auditor surren-
dered independence in assessing the company’s controls, procedures, and reporting.
Not only have some companies found that they do not have adequately trained person-
nel to confront complex accounting issues, but external auditors have also been pressed to
provide trained accounting personnel. This has led some auditing firms to reduce the number
and type of companies they will audit.
The spring of 2005 represented the first reporting season under Sarbanes-Oxley. Hun-
dreds of companies acknowledged that they had “material weaknesses” in their controls and
processes. In some cases, this led to financial statements being restated.
Implementing
Sarbanes-Oxley has resulted in several benefits.
Companies have
improved their internal controls, procedures, and financial reporting. Many companies have
also improved their fraud prevention procedures. Systems put in place to review budgets will
enable companies to be more proactive in preventing potential problems. Users of financial
statements benefit from an improved financial product that they review and analyze to make
investment decisions.
Unfortunately, implementing Sarbanes-Oxley has been quite costly. Some firms question
the cost-benefit of compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley. In time, we will know how much of the
cost was represented by start-up cost and how much was annual recurring costs. The sub-
stantial cost of implementing Sarbanes-Oxley will likely result in future changes to this law.
Publicly held companies are required to report under Sarbanes-Oxley, whereas private
companies are not. Many state-level legislators have proposed extending certain provisions
of Sarbanes-Oxley to private companies. Such proposals are controversial because of the
cost. Some private companies support these proposals.

Most of the publicity relating to Sarbanes-Oxley has been related to Section 404, but the
Act includes many other sections. This book will revisit Sarbanes-Oxley when covering other
areas, such as ethics, in Chapter 2.
Sarbanes-Oxley created a five-person oversight board, the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB consists of five members appointed by the SEC.
Two must be CPAs, but the others cannot be CPAs.
Among the many responsibilities of the PCAOB is to adopt auditing standards. This will
materially decrease or eliminate the role of the AICPA in setting auditing standards.
The PCAOB sets an annual accounting support fee for the standard-setting body (FASB).
The PCAOB also establishes an annual accounting support fee for the PCAOB. These fees
are assessed against each issuer.
The CEO and the chief financial officer (CFO) of each issuer must prepare a statement
to accompany the audit report to certify that disclosures fairly present, in all material
respects, the operations and financial condition of the issuer.
In addition to appointing the five members of the PCAOB, the SEC is responsible for over-
sight and enforcement authority over the Board. In effect, the PCAOB is an arm of the SEC.
As described in this chapter, the setting of accounting standards has been divided among
the SEC, FASB, EITF, and AcSEC. By law, the setting of accounting standards is the respon-
sibility of the SEC. The SEC elected to have most of the accounting standards developed in
the private sector with the oversight of the SEC. This substantially meant that the SEC
allowed the FASB to determine accounting standards. The FASB allowed some of the stand-
ards to be determined by the EITF and the AcSEC of the AICPA.
The FASB has announced that it is streamlining the accounting rule-making process by
taking back powers it had vested to AcSEC (an arm of the AICPA). The AcSEC will be
allowed to continue with industry-specific accounting and audit guides (A&A guides). The
AICPA is to stop issuing general-purpose accounting SOPs.
The FASB has also streamlined the accounting rule-making process by taking back powers
it had vested to the EITF (an arm of the FASB). Two FASB members will be involved in the
agenda-setting process of the EITF. Statements of the EITF will go to the FASB before release.
FASB Accounting Standards Codification™(Codification)
As indicated in this chapter, there have been many sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP. This
has resulted in thousands of pages addressing U.S. GAAP and some confusion as to the level
of authoritative GAAP.
To provide a single source of authoritative U.S. GAAP, the FASB released a Codification
of U.S. GAAP in 2009. With the Codification, all other literature is considered nonauthorita-
tive. The Codification excludes governmental accounting standards.
The Codification substantially improves the ease of researching U.S. GAAP. Preparers
and auditors of financial statements need to reference the Codification when dealing with
GAAP. The Codification does not change GAAP.
The Codification arranges U.S. GAAP into approximately 90 accounting topics. A separate
section on the Codification includes relevant SEC guidance using the same topical structure.
The Codification is organized in a tiered structure. Information is organized into eight
areas ranging from industry-specific to general financial statement matters. Within each
area are topics, subtopics, sections, subsections, and paragraphs, where details of the
technical content reside.8
The Codification provides electronic real-time updates as new standards are released.
The Codification is a fee-based service. A no-frills version is free.
Traditional Assumptions of the Accounting Model
The FASB’s Conceptual Framework was influenced by several underlying assumptions.
Some of these assumptions were addressed in the Conceptual Framework, and others are
implicit in the Framework. These assumptions, along with the Conceptual Framework, are
considered when a GAAP is established. Accountants, when confronted with a situation

lacking an explicit standard, should resolve the situation by considering the Conceptual
Framework and the traditional assumptions of the accounting model.
In all cases, the reports are to be a “fair representation.” Even when there is an explicit
GAAP, following the GAAP is not appropriate unless the result is a “fair representation.”
Following GAAP is not an appropriate legal defense unless the statements represent a “fair
representation.”
Business Entity
The concept of separate entity means that the business or entity for which the financial state-
ments are prepared is separate and distinct from the owners of the entity. In other words, the
entity is viewed as an economic unit that stands on its own.
For example, an individual may own a grocery store, a farm, and numerous personal
assets. To determine the economic success of the grocery store, we would view it separately
from the other resources owned by the individual. The grocery store would be treated as a
separate entity.
A corporation such as Ford Motor Company has many owners (stockholders). The en-
tity concept enables us to account for the Ford Motor Company entity separately from the
transactions of the owners of Ford Motor Company.
Going Concern or Continuity
The going-concern assumption, that the entity in question will remain in business for an
indefinite period, provides perspective on the future of the entity. The going-concern assump-
tion deliberately disregards the possibility that the entity will go bankrupt or be liquidated. If
a particular entity is in fact threatened with bankruptcy or liquidation, then the going-
concern assumption should be dropped. In such a case, the reader of the financial statements
is interested in the liquidation values, not the values that can be used when making the
assumption that the business will continue indefinitely. If the going-concern assumption has
not been used for a particular set of financial statements, because of the threat of liquidation
or bankruptcy, the financial statements must clearly disclose that the statements were pre-
pared with the view that the entity will be liquidated or that it is a failing concern. In this
case, conventional financial report analysis would not apply.
Many of our present financial statement figures would be misleading if it were not for
the going-concern assumption. For instance, under the going-concern assumption, the value
of prepaid insurance is computed by spreading the cost of the insurance over the period of
the policy. If the entity were liquidated, then only the cancellation value of the policy would
be meaningful. Inventories are basically carried at their accumulated cost. If the entity were
liquidated, then the amount realized from the sale of the inventory, in a manner other than
through the usual channels, usually would be substantially less than the cost. Therefore, to
carry the inventory at cost would fail to recognize the loss that is represented by the differ-
ence between the liquidation value and the cost.
The going-concern assumption also influences liabilities. If the entity were liquidating,
some liabilities would have to be stated at amounts in excess of those stated on the conven-
tional statement. Also, the amounts provided for warranties and guarantees would not be
realistic if the entity were liquidating.
The
going-concern
assumption
also
influences
the
classification
of
assets
and
liabilities. Without the going-concern assumption, all assets and liabilities would be current,
with the expectation that the assets would be liquidated and the liabilities paid in the near
future.
The audit opinion for a particular firm may indicate that the auditors have reservations
as to the going-concern status of the firm. This puts the reader on guard that the statements
are misleading if the firm does not continue as a going concern. For example, the annual
report of Phoenix Footwear Group, Inc. indicated an uncertainty about the company’s abil-
ity to continue as a going concern.
The Phoenix Footwear Group, Inc. annual report included the following comments in
Note 2 and the auditor’s report.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—Note 2
January 3, 2009
2. GOING CONCERN
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Com-
pany will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred net losses for the
last two fiscal years and has been in continuing default on its existing credit facility.
As of December 29, 2007, the Company was not in compliance with the financial
covenants under its credit facility. The Company did not request a waiver for the re-
spective defaults as it was in the process of replacing the existing facility with a new
lender. In June 2008, the Company entered into a Credit and Security Agreement
with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) for a three-year revolving line of credit
and letters of credit collateralized by all of the Company’s assets and those of its sub-
sidiaries. Under the facility, the Company can borrow up to $17.0 million (subject to
a borrowing base which includes eligible receivables and eligible inventory), which,
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, may be increased to $20.0 million.
The credit facility also includes a $7.5 million letter of credit sub facility. The Com-
pany has been in continuing default under the Wells Fargo credit facility since Sep-
tember 27, 2008 by failing to meet the financial covenant for income before income
taxes. Additionally, the Company expects that it will not meet this financial covenant
as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2009 or thereafter unless this financial cove-
nant is amended. Because of the Company’s current defaults, its current lender can
demand immediate repayment of all debt and the bank can foreclose on the Com-
pany’s assets. The Company presently has insufficient cash to pay its bank debt in
full. The Company has been in continuing discussions with Wells Fargo regarding its
restructuring activities in an effort to obtain a waiver of the past financial covenant
default and amend future financial covenants. The bank is continuing to evaluate the
Company’s restructuring activities and has provided no assurance that it will provide
a waiver or amend the Company’s agreement. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
when, or if, an amendment or waiver will be provided. This raises substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities
that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Com-
pany will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial state-
ments, the Company incurred a net loss of $19,460,000 for the year ended January
3, 2009 and the Company is not in compliance with financial covenants under its cur-
rent credit agreement as of January 3, 2009. These factors, among others, as dis-
cussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, raise substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to
these matters are described in Note 2 to the financial statements. The financial state-
ments do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.

Time Period
The only accurate way to account for the success or failure of an entity is to accumulate all
transactions from the opening of business until the business eventually liquidates. Many
years ago, this time period for reporting was acceptable because it would be feasible to
account for and divide up what remained at the completion of the venture. Today, the typi-
cal business has a relatively long duration, so it is not feasible to wait until the business liqui-
dates before accounting for its success or failure.
This presents a problem: Accounting for the success or failure of the business in mid-
stream involves inaccuracies. Many transactions and commitments are incomplete at any
particular time between the opening and the closing of business. An attempt is made to elimi-
nate the inaccuracies when statements are prepared for a period of time short of an entity’s
life span, but the inaccuracies cannot be eliminated completely. For example, the entity typi-
cally carries accounts receivable at the amount expected to be collected. Only when the
receivables are collected can the entity account for them accurately. Until receivables are col-
lected, there exists the possibility that collection cannot be made. The entity will have out-
standing obligations at any time, and these obligations cannot be accurately accounted for
until they are met. An example would be a warranty on products sold. An entity may also
have a considerable investment in the production of inventories. Usually, until the inventory
is sold in the normal course of business, the entity cannot accurately account for the invest-
ment in inventory.
With the time period assumption, we accept some inaccuracies of accounting for the en-
tity short of its complete life span. We assume that the entity can be accounted for with rea-
sonable accuracy for a particular period of time. In other words, the decision is made to
accept some inaccuracy, because of incomplete information about the future, in exchange
for more timely reporting.
Some businesses select an accounting period, known as a natural business year, that ends
when operations are at a low ebb in order to facilitate a better measurement of income and
financial position. In many instances, the natural business year of a company ends on
December 31. Other businesses use the calendar year and thus end the accounting period on
December 31. Thus, for many companies that use December 31, we cannot tell if December
31 was selected because it represents a natural business year or if it was selected to represent
a calendar year. Some select a 12-month accounting period, known as a fiscal year, which
closes at the end of a month other than December. The accounting period may be shorter
than a year, such as a month. The shorter the period of time, the more inaccuracies we typi-
cally expect in the reporting.
At times, this text will refer to Accounting Trends & Techniques, a book compiled
annually by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Inc. Accounting Trends
& Techniques “is a compilation of reporting and disclosure data obtained from a survey of
the annual reports to stockholders of 600 publicly traded companies. This AICPA publica-
tion is produced for the purpose of providing accounting professionals with an invaluable
resource for incorporating new and existing accounting and reporting guidance into finan-
cial statements using presentation techniques adopted by some of the most recognized com-
panies headquartered in the United States. The annual reports surveyed were those of
selected industrial, merchandising, technology, and service companies for fiscal periods end-
ing between February and January 2008.”9
Exhibit 1-3 summarizes month of fiscal year-end from a financial statement compilation
in Accounting Trends & Techniques.
In Exhibit 1-3 for 2009, 141 survey companies were on a 52- to 53-week fiscal year.10
Monetary Unit
Accountants need some standard of measure to bring financial transactions together in a
meaningful way. Without some standard of measure, accountants would be forced to report
in such terms as 5 cars, 1 factory, and 100 acres. This type of reporting would not be very
meaningful.

There are a number of standards of measure, such as a yard, a gallon, and money. Of
the possible standards of measure, accountants have concluded that money is the best for the
purpose of measuring financial transactions.
Different countries call their monetary units by different names. For example, Japan uses
the yen. Different countries also attach different values to their money—1 dollar is not equal
to 1 yen. Thus, financial transactions may be measured in terms of money in each country,
but the statements from various countries cannot be compared directly or added together
until they are converted to a common monetary unit, such as the U.S. dollar.
In various countries, the stability of the monetary unit has been a problem. The loss in
value of money is called inflation. In some countries, inflation has been more than 300 per-
cent per year. In countries where inflation has been significant, financial statements are
adjusted by an inflation factor that restores the significance of money as a measuring unit.
However, a completely acceptable restoration of money as a measuring unit cannot be made
in such cases because of the problems involved in determining an accurate index. To indicate
one such problem, consider the price of a car in 2001 and in 2011. The price of the car in
2011 would be higher, but the explanation would not be simply that the general price level
has increased. Part of the reason for the price increase would be that the type and quality of
the equipment changed between 2001 and 2011. Thus, an index that relates the 2011 price
to the 2001 price is a mixture of inflation, technological advancement, and quality changes.
The rate of inflation in the United States prior to the 1970s was relatively low. There-
fore, an adjustment of money as a measuring unit was thought to be inappropriate because
the added expense and inaccuracies of adjusting for inflation were greater than the benefits.
During the 1970s, however, the United States experienced double-digit inflation. This made
it increasingly desirable to implement some formal recognition of inflation.
In September 1979, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 33,
“Financial Reporting and Changing Prices,” which required that certain large, publicly held
companies disclose certain supplementary information concerning the impact of changing
prices in their annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 25, 1979. This dis-
closure later became optional in 1986. Currently, no U.S. company provides this supplemen-
tary information.
Historical Cost
SFAC No. 5 identified five different measurement attributes currently used in practice:
historical cost, current cost, current market value, net realizable value, and present value.

Often, historical cost is used in practice because it is objective and determinable. A deviation
from historical cost is accepted when it becomes apparent that the historical cost cannot
be recovered. This deviation is justified by the conservatism concept. A deviation from his-
torical cost is also found in practice where specific standards call for another measurement
attribute such as current market value, net realizable value, or present value.
Conservatism
The accountant is often faced with a choice of different measurements of a situation, with
each measurement having reasonable support. According to the concept of conservatism, the
accountant must select the measurement with the least favorable effect on net income and
financial position in the current period.
To apply the concept of conservatism to any given situation, there must be alternative
measurements, each of which must have reasonable support. The accountant cannot use the
conservatism concept to justify arbitrarily low figures. For example, writing inventory down
to an arbitrarily low figure in order to recognize any possible loss from selling the inventory
constitutes inaccurate accounting and cannot be justified under the concept of conservatism.
An acceptable use of conservatism would be to value inventory at the lower of historical cost
or market value.
The conservatism concept is used in many other situations, such as writing down or
writing off obsolete inventory prior to sale, recognizing a loss on a long-term construction
contract when it can be reasonably anticipated, and taking a conservative approach toward
determining the application of overhead to inventory. Conservatism requires that the esti-
mate of warranty expense reflects the least favorable effect on net income and the financial
position of the current period.
Realization
Accountants face a problem of when to recognize revenue. All parts of an entity contribute
to revenue, including the janitor, the receiving department, and the production employees.
The problem becomes how to determine objectively the contribution of each segment to rev-
enue. Since this is not practical, accountants must determine when it is practical to recognize
revenue.
In practice, revenue recognition has been the subject of much debate, which has resulted
in fairly wide interpretations. The issue of revenue recognition has represented the basis of
many SEC enforcement actions. In general, the point of recognition of revenue should be the
point in time when revenue can be reasonably and objectively determined. It is essential that
there be some uniformity regarding when revenue is recognized, so as to make financial
statements meaningful and comparable.
Point of Sale
Revenue is usually recognized at the point of sale. At this time, the earning process is virtu-
ally complete, and the exchange value can be determined.
There are times when use of the point-of-sale approach does not give a fair result. An
example would be the sale of land on credit to a buyer who does not have a reasonable abil-
ity to pay. If revenue were recognized at the point of sale, there would be a reasonable
chance that sales had been overstated because of the material risk of default. Many other
acceptable methods of recognizing revenue should be considered, such as the following:
1. End of production
2. Receipt of cash
3. During production
4. Cost recovery
End of Production
The recognition of revenue at the completion of the production process is acceptable when
the price of the item is known and there is a ready market. The mining of gold or silver is an
example, and the harvesting of some farm products would also fit these criteria. If corn is

harvested in the fall and held over the winter in order to obtain a higher price in the spring,
the realization of revenue from the growing of corn should be recognized in the fall, at the
point of harvest. The gain or loss from holding the corn represents a separate consideration
from the growing of the corn.
Receipt of Cash
The receipt of cash is another basis for revenue recognition. This method should be used
when collection is not capable of reasonable estimation at the time of sale. The land sales
business, where the purchaser makes only a nominal down payment, is one type of business
where the collection of the full amount is especially doubtful. Experience has shown that
many purchasers default on the contract.
During Production
Some long-term construction projects recognize revenue as the construction progresses. This
exception tends to give a fairer picture of the results for a given period of time. For example,
in the building of a utility plant, which may take several years, recognizing revenue as work
progresses gives a fairer picture of the results than does having the entire revenue recognized
in the period when the plant is completed.
Cost Recovery
The cost recovery approach is acceptable for highly speculative transactions. For example,
an entity may invest in a venture search for gold, the outcome of which is completely unpre-
dictable. In this case, the first revenue can be handled as a return of the investment. If more
is received than has been invested, the excess would be considered revenue.
In addition to the methods of recognizing revenue described in this chapter, there are
many other methods that are usually industry-specific. Being aware of the method(s) used by
a specific firm can be important to your understanding of the financial reports.
The FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) have been working
on a new standard to make revenue recognition more consistent in practice (the IASB is
introduced later in this chapter). It appears that a new SFAS will be approved in 2012 with
an effective date in a subsequent year.
Matching
The revenue realization concept involves when to recognize revenue. Accountants need a
related concept that addresses when to recognize the costs associated with the recognized
revenue: the matching concept. The basic intent is to determine the revenue first and then
match the appropriate costs against this revenue.
Some costs, such as the cost of inventory, can be easily matched with revenue. When
we sell the inventory and recognize the revenue, the cost of the inventory can be matched
against the revenue. Other costs have no direct connection with revenue, so some systematic
policy must be adopted in order to allocate these costs reasonably against revenues. Exam-
ples are research and development costs and public relations costs, both of which are
charged off in the period incurred. This is inconsistent with the matching concept because
the cost would benefit beyond the current period, but it is in accordance with the concept
of conservatism.
Consistency
The consistency concept requires the entity to give the same treatment to comparable trans-
actions from period to period. This adds to the usefulness of the reports, since the reports
from one period are comparable to the reports from another period. It also facilitates the
detection of trends.
Many accounting methods could be used for any single item, such as inventory. If inven-
tory were determined in one period on one basis and in the next period on a different basis,
the resulting inventory and profits would not be comparable from period to period.
Entities sometimes need to change particular accounting methods in order to adapt to
changing environments. If the entity can justify the use of an alternative accounting method,

the change can be made. The entity must be ready to defend the change—a responsibility
that should not be taken lightly in view of the liability for misleading financial statements.
Sometimes the change will be based on a new accounting pronouncement. When an entity
makes a change in accounting methods, the justification for the change must be disclosed,
along with an explanation of the effect on the statements.
Full Disclosure
The accounting reports must disclose all facts that may influence the judgment of an
informed reader. If the entity uses an accounting method that represents a departure from
the official position of the FASB, disclosure of the departure must be made, along with the
justification for it.
Several methods of disclosure exist, such as parenthetical explanations, supporting
schedules, cross-references, and notes. Often, the additional disclosures must be made by a
note in order to explain the situation properly. For example, details of a pension plan, long-
term leases, and provisions of a bond issue are often disclosed in notes.
The financial statements are expected to summarize significant financial information. If
all the financial information is presented in detail, it could be misleading. Excessive disclo-
sure could violate the concept of full disclosure. Therefore, a reasonable summarization of
financial information is required.
Because of the complexity of many businesses and the increased expectations of the pub-
lic, full disclosure has become one of the most difficult concepts for the accountant to apply.
Lawsuits frequently charge accountants with failure to make proper disclosure. Since disclo-
sure is often a judgment decision, it is not surprising that others (especially those who have
suffered losses) would disagree with the adequacy of the disclosure.
Materiality
The accountant must consider many concepts and principles when determining how to han-
dle a particular item. The proper use of the various concepts and principles may be costly
and time-consuming. The materiality concept involves the relative size and importance of an
item to a firm. An item that is material to one entity may not be material to another. For
example, an item that costs $100 might be expensed by General Electric, but the same item
might be carried as an asset by a small entity.
It is essential that material items be properly handled on the financial statements. Imma-
terial items are not subject to the concepts and principles that bind the accountant. They
may be handled in the most economical and expedient manner possible. However, the
accountant faces a judgment situation when determining materiality. It is better to err in
favor of an item being material than the other way around.
A basic question when determining whether an item is material is: “Would this item
influence an informed reader of the financial statements?” In answering this question, the
accountant should consider the statements as a whole.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act has materiality implications. “The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
has put demands on management to detect and prevent material control weaknesses in a
timely manner. To help management fulfill this responsibility, CPAs are creating monthly
key control processes to assess and report on risk. When management finds a key control
that does not meet the required minimum quality standard, it must classify the result as a
key control exception.”11
Industry Practices
Some industry practices lead to accounting reports that do not conform to the general theory
that underlies accounting. Some of these practices are the result of government regulation.
For example, some differences can be found in highly regulated industries, such as insurance,
railroad, and utilities.
In the utility industry, an allowance for funds used during the construction period of a
new plant is treated as part of the cost of the plant. The offsetting amount is reflected as
other income. This amount is based on the utility’s hypothetical cost of funds, including
funds from debt and stock. This type of accounting is found only in the utility industry.

In some industries, it is very difficult to determine the cost of the inventory. Examples
include the meat-packing industry, the flower industry, and farming. In these areas, it may be
necessary to determine the inventory value by working backward from the anticipated selling
price and subtracting the estimated cost to complete and dispose of the inventory. The inven-
tory would thus be valued at a net realizable value, which would depart from the cost concept
and the usual interpretation of the revenue realization concept. If inventory is valued at net real-
izable value, then the profit has already been recognized and is part of the inventory amount.
The accounting profession is making an effort to reduce or eliminate specific industry
practices. However, industry practices that depart from typical accounting procedures will
probably never be eliminated completely. Some industries have legitimate peculiarities that
call for accounting procedures other than the customary ones.
Transaction Approach
The accountant records only events that affect the financial position of the entity and, at the
same time, can be reasonably determined in monetary terms. For example, if the entity pur-
chases merchandise on account (on credit), the financial position of the entity changes. This
change can be determined in monetary terms as the inventory asset is obtained and the liability,
accounts payable, is incurred.
Many important events that influence the prospects for the entity are not recorded and,
therefore, are not reflected in the financial statements because they fall outside the transaction
approach. The death of a top executive could have a material influence on future prospects,
especially for a small company. One of the company’s major suppliers could go bankrupt at
a time when the entity does not have an alternative source. The entity may have experienced
a long strike by its employees or have a history of labor problems. A major competitor may
go out of business. All these events may be significant to the entity. They are not recorded
because they are not transactions. When projecting the future prospects of an entity, it is nec-
essary to go beyond current financial reports.
Some of the items not recorded will be disclosed. This is done under the full disclosure
assumption.
Cash Basis
The cash basis recognizes revenue when cash is received and recognizes expenses when cash is
paid. The cash basis usually does not provide reasonable information about the earning capa-
bility of the entity in the short run. Therefore, the cash basis is usually not acceptable.
Accrual Basis
The accrual basis of accounting recognizes revenue when realized (realization concept) and
expenses when incurred (matching concept). If the difference between the accrual basis and
the cash basis is not material, the entity may use the cash basis as an alternative to the
accrual basis for income determination. Usually, the difference between the accrual basis and
the cash basis is material.
A modified cash basis is sometimes used by professional practices and service organiza-
tions. The modified cash basis adjusts for such items as buildings and equipment.
The accrual basis requires numerous adjustments at the end of the accounting period.
For example, if insurance has been paid for in advance, the accountant must determine the
amounts that belong in prepaid insurance and insurance expense. If employees have not been
paid all of their wages, the unpaid wages must be determined and recorded as an expense
and as a liability. If revenue has been collected in advance, such as rent received in advance,
this revenue relates to future periods and must, therefore, be deferred to those periods. At
the end of the accounting period, the unearned rent would be considered a liability.
The use of the accrual basis complicates the accounting process, but the end result is
more representative of an entity’s financial condition than the cash basis. Without the
accrual basis, accountants would not usually be able to make the time period assumption—
that the entity can be accounted for with reasonable accuracy for a particular period of time.
The illustration on the following page indicates why the accrual basis is generally
regarded as a better measure of a firm’s performance than the cash basis.

Assumptions:
1. Sold merchandise (inventory) for $25,000 on credit this year. The merchandise cost
$12,500 when purchased in the prior year.
2. Purchased merchandise this year in the amount of $30,000 on credit.
3. Paid suppliers of merchandise $18,000 this year.
4. Collected $15,000 from sales.

The accrual basis indicates a profitable business, whereas the cash basis indicates a loss.
The cash basis does not reasonably indicate when the revenue was earned or when to recog-
nize the cost that relates to the earned revenue. The cash basis does indicate when the
receipts and payments (disbursements) occurred. The points in time when cash is received
and paid do not usually constitute a good gauge of profitability. However, knowing the
points in time is important; the flow of cash will be presented in a separate financial state-
ment (statement of cash flows).
In practice, the accrual basis is modified. Immaterial items are frequently handled on a
cash basis, and some specific standards have allowed the cash basis.
Harmonization of International Accounting Standards
The impetus for changes in accounting practice has come from the needs of the business
community and governments. With the expansion of international business and global capi-
tal markets, the business community and governments have shown an increased interest in
the harmonization of international accounting standards.
Suggested problems caused by the lack of harmonization of international accounting
standards include the following:
1. A need for employment of key personnel in multinational companies to bridge the
“gap” in accounting requirements between countries.
2. Difficulties in reconciling local standards for access to other capital markets.
3. Difficulties in accessing capital markets for companies from less developed countries.12
4. Negative effect on the international trade of accounting practice and services.13
Domestic accounting standards have developed to meet the needs of domestic environ-
ments. A few of the factors that influence accounting standards locally are as follows:
1. A litigious environment in the United States that has led to a demand for more detailed
standards in many cases.
2. High rates of inflation in some countries that have resulted in periodic revaluation of
fixed assets and other price-level adjustments or disclosures.
3. More emphasis on financial reporting/income tax conformity in certain countries (for
example, Japan and Germany) that no doubt greatly influences domestic financial
reporting.
4. Reliance on open markets as the principal means of intermediating capital flows that has
increased the demand for information to be included in financial reports in the United
States and some other developed countries.14
The following have been observed to have an impact on a country’s financial accounting
operation:
1. Who the investors and creditors – the information users – are (individuals, banks, the
government).
2. How many investors and creditors there are.

3. How close the relationship is between businesses and the investor/creditor group.
4. How developed the stock exchanges and bond markets are.
5. The extent of use of international financial markets.15
With this backdrop of fragmentation, it has been difficult, if not impossible, in the short
run to bring all national standards into agreement with a meaningful body of international
standards. But many see benefits to harmonization of international accounting standards
and feel that accounting must move in that direction.
The United Nations (UN) has shown a substantial interest in the harmonization of the
international accounting standards. The UN appointed a group to study harmonization of
the international accounting standards in 1973. This has evolved into an ad hoc working
group. Members of the working group represent governments and not the private sector.
The working group does not issue standards but rather facilitates their development. The
UN’s concern is with how multinational corporations affect the developing countries.16
Many other organizations, in addition to the UN, have played a role in the harmoniza-
tion of international accounting standards. Some of these organizations include the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the European Economic Community (EEC), the Orga-
nization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the International Feder-
ation of Accountants (IFAC).
In 1973, nine countries, including the United States, formed the International Account-
ing Standards Committee (IASC). The IASC included approximately 100 member nations
and well over 100 professional accounting bodies. The IASC was the only private-sector
body involved in setting international accounting standards. International Accounting Stand-
ards (IAS) were issued by the IASC from 1973 to 2000.
The IASC’s objectives included the following:
1. Developing international accounting standards and disclosure to meet the needs of
international capital markets and the international business community.
2. Developing accounting standards to meet the needs of developing and newly
industrialized countries.
3. Working toward increased comparability between national and international accounting
standards.17
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) was established in January 2001
to replace the IASC. The IASB arose from a review of the structure of the IASC. The new
structure has characteristics similar to those of the FASB. The IASB basically continues the
objectives of the IASC.
The IASB does not have authority to enforce its standards, but these standards have been
adopted in whole or in part by approximately 100 countries. Some see the lack of enforce-
ment authority as a positive factor because it enables the passing of standards that would not
have had the necessary votes if they could be enforced. This allows standards to be more ideal
than they would otherwise be if they were enforceable. The IASB issues International Finan-
cial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The term IFRSs now refers to the entire body of interna-
tional standards. The IASB lacks an independent and assured source of funding. The FASB
has a dependent and assured source of funding by way of an issuer accounting support fee.
The IASB follows a due-process procedure similar to that of the FASB. This includes
Exposure Drafts and a comment period. All proposed standards and guidelines are exposed
for comment for about six months.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards
Board met jointly in Norwalk, Connecticut, on September 18, 2002. They acknowledged
their commitment to the development of high-quality, compatible accounting standards that
could be used for both domestic and cross-border financial reporting. (This is known as the
Norwalk Agreement.)
Since the Norwalk Agreement, the FASB and IASB have made significant progress. In
joint meetings in April and October 2005, the FASB and the IASB reaffirmed their commit-
ment to the convergence of U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. In
a joint meeting held on February 27, 2006, they agreed on a road map for convergence

between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The road map has resulted in many standards being issued
where the U.S. and international standards are similar.
In 2007, President Bush signed an agreement between the United States and the Euro-
pean Union that sets the stage to allow many public companies to drop U.S. GAAP in favor
of more flexible international rules. Also in 2007, the SEC announced that it would accept
financial statements from private issuers without reconciliation to U.S. GAAP if they are
prepared using IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The American Accounting Association has a Financial Reporting Policy Committee that
is charged with responding to Discussion Memoranda and Exposure Drafts on financial
accounting and reporting issues. In responding to the SEC release, this committee stated that,
“Based on our review of the literature, the committee concluded that eliminating the recon-
ciliation requirement was premature.”18 They offered points in support of their conclusion.
Several of these points follow:19
1. Material reconciling items exist between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, and the reconciliation
currently reflects information that participants in U.S. stock markets appear to impound
to stock prices.
2. Cross-country institutional differences will likely result in differences in the implementa-
tion of any single set of standards. Thus, IFRS may be a high-quality set of reporting
standards (pre-implementation), but the resulting published financial statement informa-
tion could be of low quality, given inconsistent cross-border implementation practices.
3. Legal and institutional obstacles inhibit private litigation against foreign firms in the
United States, and the SEC rarely undertakes enforcement actions against cross-listed
firms. In the absence of a reliable enforcement mechanism, even high-quality accounting
standards can yield low-quality financial reporting.
4. Differential implementation of standards across countries and differential enforcement
efforts directed toward domestic and cross-listed firms create differences in financial
reporting even with converged standards. Whether the required reconciliation mitigates
differences in implementation or improves compliance is an open issue. However, the
SEC should understand the role of the reconciliation in mitigating differences in
implementation and compliance before it is eliminated.
5. Harmonization of accounting standards could be beneficial to U.S. investors if it yields
greater comparability and if IFRS provides information U.S. investors prefer for their
investment decisions. Harmonization appears to be occurring via the joint standard-
setting activities of the FASB and the IASB; thus, special, statutory intervention by the
SEC appears to be unnecessary.
Ray Ball, a professor of accounting at the University of Chicago, noted a number of
problems with implementing IFRS. Several of his comments follow:
1. “On the con side, a deep concern is that the differences in financial reporting quality that
are inevitable among countries have been pushed down to the level of implementation,
and now will be concealed by a veneer of uniformity.”20
2. “Despite increased globalization, most political and economic influences on financial
reporting practice remain local. It is reinforced by a brief review of the comparatively
toothless body of international enforcement agencies currently in place.”21
3. “The fundamental reason for being skeptical about uniformity of implementation in
practice is that the incentives of preparers (managers) and enforcers (auditors, courts,
regulators, boards, block shareholders, politicians, analysts, rating agencies, the press)
remain primarily local.”22
4. “Under its constitution, the IASB is a standard setter and does not have an enforcement
mechanism for its standards.”23
5. “Over time the IASB risks becoming a politicized, polarized, bureaucratic, UN-style body.”24
In 2009, the SEC released for public comment a proposed road map for adoption of
IFRS by public companies in the United States. “While many expressed support for the goal
of high-quality globally accepted accounting standards, the request for comments produced

numerous critics of the SEC’s proposed road map. Commentators have serious concerns
about the cost of adoption, the benefits of adoption, compared to convergence, and whether
IFRSs were in fact as good as or better than U.S. GAAP.25
On the cost of adoption there are a number of issues, notably the upfront tax issues, the
cost to implement, and additional taxes from increased reported income. These costs likely
exceed hundreds of billions of dollars. There are also likely substantial legal costs from the
United States changing from a rules-based standard to a principles-based approach.26 The IFRS
principles-based approach allows more latitude in using and applying professional judgment.
The FASB and the IASB had been using a convergence approach to international
accounting, especially since 2002. This approach had widespread support in the United
States. When the SEC proposed a road map that would require U.S. companies to adopt
IASB standards, substantial opposition arose. It appears that the United States will be mov-
ing toward using some form of international standards. It is not certain how that will be
achieved. In 2011, the SEC presented the ideas that a ‘condorsement’ approach may be the
way for the U.S. to move to IFRS. As of early 2012, the SEC had not made a decision on this
issue, and if adopted, the details of implementation.
It was envisioned that the ‘condorsement’ approach would take five to seven years to
implement, with the IFRS as the reference point.
Under the ‘condorsement’ approach, the FASB and the IASB would continue to work on the
memorandum of understanding projects. The FASB would not likely undertake new projects.
The FASB would evaluate the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, and determine
whether IFRS standards are suitable for U.S GAAP, considering U.S. capital markets.
The FASB would participate in the process for developing IFRS, but U.S. GAAP would
continue to be controlled by U.S. regulation.
Financial Reporting Standards for Small and Medium-Sized
Entities (SMEs)
In the United States the issue of financial reporting standards for small and medium-sized
entities has been debated for many years. These debates did not result in separate standards
for SMEs.
International separate standards for SMEs was an issue going back to the IASC. The
IASB carried this project forward when it replaced the IASC. After a 5-year study of the
topic, the IASB published an IFRS for SMEs in 2009.
Many jurisdictions under the IFRS have adopted or plan to adopt IFRS for SMEs.
The issue of SMEs is not part of the road map of convergence between IFRS and U.S.
GAAP.
In the United States there have been numerous studies and reports on GAAP for private
companies. These studies and reports go back approximately 40 years. This issue has again
become a major issue for U.S. GAAP.
In 2010 a Blue Ribbon Panel on Private Company Financial Reporting was appointed.
This panel represented a cross-section of financial reporting constituencies.
In January, 2011 this panel submitted a report on the future of standard setting for pri-
vate companies to the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF). The FAF oversees the Finan-
cial Accounting Standards Board.
The two most significant blue ribbon panel recommendations are that:27
• A new, separate board with standard setting authority be established under the oversight
of the FAF. The board would coordinate activities with the FASB but not be subject to
FASB approval.
• Changes and modifications be made to existing and future GAAP that recognize the
unique needs of users of private company financial statements. All such changes would
reside in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification®.
The FAF trustees formed a Trustee Working Group in March, 2011 to address account-
ing standard setting for nonpublic entities.

Using the Internet
The Internet is a global collection of computer networks linked together and available for
your use. Information passes easily among these networks because all connected networks
use a common communication protocol. The Internet includes local, regional, national, and
international backbone networks.
There are many reasons for using the Internet. Some of these reasons include (1) retriev-
ing information, (2) finding information, (3) sending and receiving electronic mail, (4) con-
ducting research, and (5) accessing information databases.
Companies’ Internet Web Sites
The majority of publicly held companies in the United States have established a Web site on
the Internet. The contents of these Web sites vary. A few companies only provide advertise-
ments and product information. In these cases, a phone number may be given to ask for
more information. Other companies provide limited financial information, such as total rev-
enues, net income, and earnings per share. These companies may also provide advertise-
ments and a phone number for more information. Many companies provide comprehensive
financial information and possibly advertisements. The comprehensive financial information
may include the annual report and quarterly reports. It may also include the current stock
price and the history of the stock price.

Summary
This chapter has reviewed the development of U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles and the traditional assump-
tions of the accounting model. You need a broad understand-
ing of GAAP and the traditional assumptions to reasonably
understand financial reports. The financial reports can be no
better than the accounting principles and the assumptions of
the accounting model that are the basis for preparation.
This chapter introduced “Harmonization of Interna-
tional Accounting Standards” and Financial Reporting Stand-
ards for Small and Medium-Sized Entities (SMEs). It also
introduced helpful Web sites that can be very useful when
performing analysis.

mulation of accounting principles:
a. American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
b. Financial Accounting Standards Board
c. Securities and Exchange Commission
Q 1-2 How does the concept of consistency aid in the
analysis of financial statements? What type of accounting
disclosure is required if this concept is not applied?
Q 1-3 The president of your firm, Lesky and Lesky, has lit-
tle background in accounting. Today, he walked into your
office and said, “A year ago we bought a piece of land for
$100,000. This year, inflation has driven prices up by 6%,
and an appraiser just told us we could easily resell the land
for $115,000. Yet our balance sheet still shows it at
$100,000. It should be valued at $115,000. That’s what it’s
worth. Or, at a minimum, at $106,000.” Respond to this
statement with specific reference to the accounting princi-
ples applicable in this situation.

form to generally accepted accounting principles. Comment
on the use of GAAP under these conditions.

the preparation of financial statements, the statements are
inaccurate and are, therefore, not a very meaningful tool to
determine the profits or losses of an entity or the financial
position of an entity. Comment.
Q 1-8 The only accurate way to account for the success
or failure of an entity is to accumulate all transactions from
the opening of business until the business eventually liqui-
dates. Comment on whether this is true. Discuss the neces-
sity of having completely accurate statements.

rial, an effort has been made to retain the significance
of money as a measuring unit by adjusting the financial
statements by an inflation factor. Can an accurate adjust-
ment for inflation be made to the statements? Can a rea-
sonable adjustment to the statements be made? Discuss.
Q 1-13 An arbitrary write-off of inventory can be justified
under the conservatism concept. Is this statement true or
false? Discuss.

tive costs, the matching concept is difficult to apply. Com-
ment on when it is difficult to apply the matching concept.

Cases
CASE 1-1 STANDARD SETTING: “A POLITICAL ASPECT”
This case consists of a letter from Dennis R. Beresford, chairperson of the Financial Account-
ing Standards Board, to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. The specific issue was proposed legis-
lation relating to the accounting for employee stock options.
Permission to reprint the following letter was obtained from the Financial Accounting
Standards Board.
August 3, 1993
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman
United States Senate
Hart Senate Office Building
Room 316
Washington, DC 20510
Dear Senator Lieberman:
Members of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB or the Board) and its
staff routinely consult with members of Congress, their staffs, and other government
officials on matters involving financial accounting. For example, FASB members and
staff met with Senator Levin both before and after the introduction of his proposed legis-
lation, Senate Bill 259, which also addresses accounting for employee stock options.
The attachment to this letter discusses the accounting issues (we have not
addressed the tax issues) raised in your proposed legislation, Senate Bill 1175, and
issues raised in remarks introduced in the Congressional Record. My comments in
this letter address an issue that is more important than any particular legislation or
any particular accounting issue: why we have a defined process for setting financial
reporting standards and why it is harmful to the public interest to distort accounting
reports in an attempt to attain other worthwhile goals.
Financial Reporting
Markets are enormously efficient information processors—when they have the infor-
mation and that information faithfully portrays economic events. Financial state-
ments are one of the basic tools for communicating that information. The U.S. capital
market system is well-developed and efficient because of users’ confidence that the fi-
nancial information they receive is reliable. Common accounting standards for the
preparation of financial reports contribute to their credibility. The mission of the
FASB, an organization designed to be independent of all other business and professio-
nal organizations, is to establish and improve financial accounting and reporting
standards in the United States.
Investors, creditors, regulators, and other users of financial reports make business
and economic decisions based on information in financial statements. Credibility is
critical whether the user is an individual contemplating a stock investment, a bank
making lending decisions, or a regulatory agency reviewing solvency. Users count on
financial reports that are evenhanded, neutral, and unbiased.
An efficiently functioning economy requires credible financial information as a ba-
sis for decisions about allocation of resources. If financial statements are to be useful,
they must report economic activity without coloring the message to influence behavior
in a particular direction. They must not intentionally favor one party over another.
Financial statements must provide a neutral scorecard of the effects of transactions.
Economic Consequences of Accounting Standards
The Board often hears that we should take a broader view, that we must consider the
economic consequences of a new accounting standard. The FASB should not act,

(continued)
critics maintain, if a new accounting standard would have undesirable economic con-
sequences. We have been told that the effects of accounting standards could cause
lasting damage to American companies and their employees. Some have suggested,
for example, that recording the liability for retiree health care or the costs for stock-
based compensation will place U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage. These
critics suggest that because of accounting standards, companies may reduce benefits
or move operations overseas to areas where workers do not demand the same bene-
fits. These assertions are usually combined with statements about desirable goals, like
providing retiree health care or creating employee incentives.
There is a common element in those assertions. The goals are desirable, but the
means require that the Board abandon neutrality and establish reporting standards
that conceal the financial impact of certain transactions from those who use financial
statements. Costs of transactions exist whether or not the FASB mandates their recog-
nition in financial statements. For example, not requiring the recognition of the cost
of stock options or ignoring the liabilities for retiree health benefits does not alter the
economics of the transactions. It only withholds information from investors, cred-
itors, policy makers, and others who need to make informed decisions and, eventu-
ally, impairs the credibility of financial reports.
One need only look to the collapse of the thrift industry to demonstrate the conse-
quences of abandoning neutrality. During the 1970s and 1980s, regulatory account-
ing principles (RAP) were altered to obscure problems in troubled institutions.
Preserving the industry was considered a “greater good.” Many observers believe that
the effect was to delay action and hide the true dimensions of the problem. The public
interest is best served by neutral accounting standards that inform policy rather than
promote it. Stated simply, truth in accounting is always good policy.
Neutrality does not mean that accounting should not influence human behavior.
We expect that changes in financial reporting will have economic consequences, just as
economic consequences are inherent in existing financial reporting practices. Changes
in behavior naturally flow from more complete and representationally faithful finan-
cial statements. The fundamental question, however, is whether those who measure
and report on economic events should somehow screen the information before report-
ing it to achieve some objective. In FASB Concepts Statement No. 2, “Qualitative
Characteristics of Accounting Information” (paragraph 102), the Board observed:
Indeed, most people are repelled by the notion that some “big brother,”
whether government or private, would tamper with scales or speedometers
surreptitiously to induce people to lose weight or obey speed limits or would
slant the scoring of athletic events or examinations to enhance or decrease
someone’s chances of winning or graduating. There is no more reason to
abandon neutrality in accounting measurement.
The Board continues to hold that view. The Board does not set out to achieve particu-
lar economic results through accounting pronouncements. We could not if we tried.
Beyond that, it is seldom clear which result we should seek because our constituents
often have opposing viewpoints. Governments, and the policy goals they adopt, fre-
quently change.
Standard Setting in the Private Sector
While the SEC and congressional committees maintain active oversight of the FASB
to ensure that the public interest is served, throughout its history the SEC has relied
on the Board and its predecessors in the private sector to establish and improve finan-
cial accounting and reporting standards. In fulfilling the Board’s mission of improving
financial reporting, accounting standards are established through a system of due
process and open deliberation. On all of our major projects, this involves open Board
meetings, proposals published for comment, “field testing” of proposals, public hear-
ings, and redeliberation of the issues in light of comments.
Our due process has allowed us to deal with complex and highly controversial
accounting issues, ranging from pensions and retiree health care to abandonment of

nuclear power plants. This open, orderly process for standard setting precludes plac-
ing any particular special interest above the interests of the many who rely on finan-
cial information. The Board believes that the public interest is best served by
developing neutral accounting standards that result in accounting for similar transac-
tions similarly and different transactions differently. The resulting financial state-
ments provide as complete and faithful a picture of an entity as possible.
Corporations, accounting firms, users of financial statements, and most other
interested parties have long supported the process of establishing accounting standards
in the private sector without intervention by Congress or other branches of govern-
ment. Despite numerous individual issues on which the FASB and many of its constitu-
ents have disagreed, that support has continued. The resulting system of accounting
standards and financial reporting, while not perfect, is the best in the world.
Conclusion
We understand that there are a number of people who believe that their particular
short-term interests are more important than an effectively functioning financial
reporting system. We sincerely hope, however, that you and others in the Congress
will review the reasons that have led generations of lawmakers and regulators to con-
clude that neutral financial reporting is critical to the functioning of our economic
system and that the best way to achieve that end is to allow the existing private sector
process to proceed. We respectfully submit that the public interest will be best served
by that course. As former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said in testimony to the
Senate Banking Committee in 1990:
The purpose of accounting standards is to assure that financial information is
presented in a way that enables decision-makers to make informed judgments.
To the extent that accounting standards are subverted to achieve objectives
unrelated to a fair and accurate presentation, they fail in their purpose.
The attachment to this letter discusses your proposed legislation. It also describes
some aspects of our project on stock compensation and the steps in our due process
procedures that remain before the project will be completed. In your remarks in the
Congressional Record, you said that you will address future issues, including an ex-
amination of the current treatment of employee stock options, over the next weeks
and months. We would be pleased to meet with you or your staff to discuss these
topics and the details of our project. I will phone your appointments person in the
next two weeks to see if it is convenient for you to meet with me.

CASE 1-2 POLITICIZATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS—A NECESSARY ACT?
On October 3, 2008, Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.
This Act mandated that the SEC conduct a study on mark-to-market accounting standards.
The SEC had a 90-day period in which to conduct the study.
On December 30, 2008, the SEC released the “Report and Recommendations Pursuant
to Section 133 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008: Study on Mark-to-
Market Accounting.”
The Executive Summary of the SEC report included these comments:
The events leading up to the Congressional call for this study illustrated the need for
identifying and understanding the linkages that exist between fair value accounting
standards and the usefulness of information provided by financial institutions. In the
months preceding passage of the Act, some asserted that fair value accounting, along with
the accompanying guidance on measuring fair value under SFAS No. 157, contributed to
instability in our financial markets. According to these critics, fair value accounting did so
by requiring what some believed were potentially inappropriate write-downs in the value of
investments held by financial institutions, most notably due to concerns that such write-
downs were the result of inactive, illiquid, or irrational markets that resulted in values that
did not reflect the underlying economics of the securities. These voices pointed out the
correlation between U.S. GAAP reporting and the regulatory capital requirements of
financial institutions, highlighting that this correlation could lead to the failure of long-
standing financial institutions if sufficient additional capital is unavailable to offset
investment write-downs. Further, they believed the need to raise additional capital, the
effect of failures, and the reporting of large write-downs would have broader negative
impact on markets and prices, leading to further write-downs and financial instability.
Just as vocal were other market participants, particularly investors, who stated that fair
value accounting serves to enhance the transparency of financial information provided
to the public. These participants indicated that fair value information is vital in times
of stress, and a suspension of this information would weaken investor confidence and
result in further instability in the markets. These participants pointed to what they
believe are the root causes of the crisis, namely poor lending decisions and inadequate
risk management, combined with shortcomings in the current approach to supervision
and regulation, rather than accounting. Suspending the use of fair value accounting,
these participants warned, would be akin to “shooting the messenger” and hiding from
capital providers the true economic condition of a financial institution.
The recommendations and related key findings of the SEC report were the following:
1. Recommendation—SFAS No. 157 Should Be Improved, but Not Suspended
2. Recommendation—Existing Fair Value and Mark-to-Market Requirements Should Not
Be Suspended
3. Recommendation—Additional Measures Should Be Taken to Improve the Application
of Existing Fair Value Requirements
4. Recommendation—The Accounting for Financial Asset Impairments Should Be Readdressed
5. Recommendation—Implement Further Guidance to Foster the Use of Sound Judgment
6. Recommendation—Accounting Standards Should Continue to Be Established to Meet
the Needs of Investors
7. Recommendation—Additional Formal Measures to Address the Operation of Existing
Accounting Standards in Practice Should Be Established
8. Recommendation—Address the Need to Simplify the Accounting for Investments in
Financial Assets
In April 2009, the FASB issued three staff positions intended to provide additional application
guidance and enhance disclosures regarding fair value measurement and impairments of securities.
The new rules made it easier for banks to limit losses. The FASB in effect ratified pro-
posals it had put out for comment two weeks earlier.

CASE 1-3 INDEPENDENCE OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD SETTERS
Speech by SEC Chairman:
Remarks before the AICPA National Conference on Current SEC and PCAOB Developments
by
Chairman Christopher Cox
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
Washington, DC
December 8, 2008
Note: Selected comments from Chairman Christopher Cox’s speech are the basis for this case.
Good morning to all of you, and let me add my welcome to the AICPA’s National Confer-
ence on Current SEC and PCAOB Developments. It is a pleasure to join you at this Confer-
ence once again. And while the Conference topics this year are focused as always on the
cutting-edge issues that concern you in your practice, more than ever before the subjects that
you’ll cover this week are of great importance to our nation and the economy as a whole.
From issues such as fair value measurement, to the future of international accounting
and reporting, to corporate governance and MD&A and the SEC’s coming interactive data
revolution, the Conference agenda is truly cutting edge and consequential. As leaders in your
profession, I am especially grateful that you have taken the time to be here, in order to carry
forward this important work and to help confront these challenges that concern not only
our nation’s economy but the world’s.
I want you to know that the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong supporter of
your efforts, and that’s why not only I, but also a range of top staff from the SEC, including
our Chief Accountant, Conrad Hewitt; John White, the Director of the Division of Corpora-
tion Finance; Linda Thomsen, Director of the Division of Enforcement; and Jim Kroeker and
Paul Beswick, our Deputy Chief Accountants, will be participating with you in this event.
The timing for the presentations you will hear could not be more critical. And since the
issues you are addressing in your daily work go far beyond the normal conference agenda,
to the very core of the financial turmoil in our financial system, it’s fitting that the people
who will be speaking are leading the efforts to help investors and markets manage through
that turmoil with sound and consistent accounting standards.
The AICPA’s 121-year history, dating back to 1887, makes this one of the oldest profes-
sional organizations in the country. From the founding of the American Association of Pub-
lic Accountants, as it was then called, with a membership of only a few hundred to your
more than a third of a million members today, the accounting profession has been vital to
our nation’s economic health and prosperity. Americans have always entrusted you with
great responsibility, both individually and as a profession. And through thick and thin you
have maintained their confidence.

Even in the post–Sarbanes Oxley, post–Enron environment, accountants have continued
to enjoy a solid reputation among the public, and among business decision makers. That’s a
testament to your integrity and professional competence. Business executives—your clients—
give you a favorability rating of 95%. At the SEC, where we’re focused on investor protection,
we’re most impressed that investors give you a favorability rating of 97%. That’s as close to
perfect as you’re likely to get in this life. None of this means that anyone in this room can
afford to be complacent. You have a reputation, and a future, to protect. Together, we’ve all
got to remain vigilant.
The role of the accounting profession, at its core, is parallel to that of the SEC. We both
have the goal of ensuring full and accurate financial information is reported by companies.
And in fact, given that the AICPA’s history dates back even further than the SEC’s, it was left
for accountants to handle the Panic of 1884 on their own when this market crash hit the
country.
Like the current global financial turmoil, America’s Panic of 1884 was also precipitated
by a credit crisis. When New York’s national banks refused to lend any additional money
and began calling in their loans from borrowers in the West and South, at a time when the
nation didn’t have the central bank policy levers that are used today, it caused a dramatic
spike in interest rates. One contemporary commentator noted that loans at the time “com-
manded three percent interest and commission per day on call”—or a staggering annualized
compound interest rate of several hundred thousand percent. Although the aftermath of the
panic was less serious than some other economic shocks, nearly 11,000 businesses failed in
1884 alone.
In those the early days of organized accounting in America, the profession was small. A
quarter-century before, city directories listed just 14 accountants offering services to the pub-
lic in New York City, four in Philadelphia, and one in Chicago—a far cry from AICPA’s
350,000 members today.
As one who formerly taught federal income tax, I’m obliged to point out that what
really sparked the growth of the accounting profession in the early 20th century was the rati-
fication of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution in 1913. The adoption of a federal
income tax suddenly gave rise to the new field of tax preparation. Accountants quickly
asserted their authority in this new field—in competition with law firms, of course, which
also touted their expertise.
But the defining moment for the nascent field of modern accounting came in the after-
math of the Great Depression. As some of the largest and most profitable companies in the
world fell victim to the crushing financial impact, much of the blame was directed at mem-
bers of the accounting profession, who were accused in court and in the press of negligence,
incompetence, and fraud.
In hindsight, we know that the fault did not lie so much with the practitioners of
accounting, but with the lack of objective and widely accepted accounting standards. In the
absence of industry-wide standards, accountants were forced to make ad hoc determinations
across a range of business situations. Ten companies in the same industry could, and often
did, use ten different standards. Clearly something had to change, and AICPA led the charge.
This history is directly relevant to us today, when accounting standard setting is at the
center of the debate over how banks and financial firms got into—and how they can get out
of—the current financial turmoil. It was to solve the problem of accounting improvisation
that in 1939, AICPA created its own rule-making body, the Committee on Accounting Pro-
cedure, to help set industry-wide standards on contentious issues. The industry also accepted
government licensing for CPAs, who were made responsible—and personally liable—for the
auditing of publicly-traded companies.
The Committee on Accounting Procedure was a huge improvement on the lack of proc-
ess and procedure that had existed before. But because it dealt with standards on an issue-
by-issue basis as they arose, rather than offering a comprehensive framework for all
accounting standards, there was still more work to be done. To address those concerns the
AICPA replaced the Committee on Accounting Procedure, 20 years after it was formed,
with the Accounting Principles Board, and gave it a broader mandate. It is from the opin-
ions of the Accounting Principles Board between 1959 and 1973 that much of U.S. GAAP
has evolved.

The Accounting Principles Board, in turn, was succeeded by a fully independent Finan-
cial Accounting Standards Board in 1973, under the oversight of the SEC.
The reasons for creating a non governmental body are completely familiar to us today—
to be fair and objective, based on expert analysis and judgment, and free of both political
and business influence so that accounting standards could be applied consistently across all
situations in thousands of different companies. Those reasons for independent private sector
standard setting are as relevant and important today as they ever were.
Since then, Congress has consistently restated its purpose in providing the SEC with
oversight responsibility for the FASB’s independent standard-setting activities. In the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Congress recognized the importance of having an inde-
pendent standard-setting process in order to facilitate accurate and effective financial report-
ing, and to protect investors. In the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the
Congress described the SEC’s role as ensuring that accounting standards work in the public
interest and are consistent with the protection of investors.
In creating the first body to set such standards, AICPA and the accounting profession
helped America emerge from its darkest economic hour, and you and your peers set down a
structural foundation for the economic growth and success of the past 70 years. Now we
find ourselves in another economic crisis, and once again the role of accounting standards
and the accounting profession is being challenged. As we respond to these new challenges,
we must continue to protect the independence of the standard-setting process.
If we learned one painful lesson from the events of the 1930s, and from the more recent
scandals of the S&L crisis in the 1980s and Enron, WorldCom, and the rest in the 1990s
and the first part of this decade, it is how vitally important it is to protect the independence
of accounting standard setters and ensure that their work remains free of distortions from
self-serving influences.
That priority must also be reflected in any regulatory reform undertaken by the next
Congress and the new administration. Accounting standards-setting should remain an inde-
pendent function, and regulatory oversight of the independent private-sector standard setter
should not become entangled with the competing priorities of evaluating and addressing sys-
temic risk. Accounting standards should not be viewed as a fiscal policy tool to stimulate or
moderate economic growth, but rather as a means of producing neutral and objective mea-
surements of the financial performance of public companies.
Accounting standards aren’t just another financial rudder to be pulled when the eco-
nomic ship drifts in the wrong direction. Instead they are the rivets in the hull, and you risk
the integrity of the entire economy by removing them.
There are those who say that independent standard setting is important, and who will
agree that private-sector standard setting is preferable to ensure that the process is not
detached from reality—but who nonetheless say that while these things are true in ordinary
times, these are not ordinary times. Therefore, they argue for setting aside the normal
approach to standard setting, which identifies issues for consideration, gives the public expo-
sure documents, includes outreach efforts, and then solicits comments on the exposure docu-
ments, and finally considers all of the resulting comments in finalizing and issuing new
accounting standards. All of that, they say, should be set aside and replaced with a quick fix,
whether the standard setters agree or not.
This view gives short shrift not only to the principle of independence, but also to the
credibility of the standard-setting process and investor confidence in it.
The truth is that the value of independent standard setting is greatest when the going
gets tough. The more serious the stresses on the market, the more important it is to maintain
investor confidence.
A few years ago, during the consideration of a particularly contentious and important
accounting rule, the then-Comptroller General, David Walker, wrote a letter on this very
point to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Committee, who were
then Richard Shelby and Paul Sarbanes. “[T]he principle of independence,” he said, “both in
fact and in appearance, is essential to the credibility of and confidence in any authoritative
standard-setting processes.”
And about the FASB’s role as the SEC’s designated independent private-sector standard-
setting body, the GAO had this to say:

This time-tested and proven deliberative process has served to strengthen financial
reporting and ensure general acceptance of the nation’s accounting standards. This
process is especially important given the complexity and controversial nature of some
accounting standards.
The established process that the GAO was referring to includes important safeguards for
all users of financial statements, including obtaining feedback from groups such as financial
statement preparers, auditors, individual investors, institutional investors, lenders, creditors,
professional analysts, and various other parties. These processes are designed to ensure that
the competing interests and demands of the various groups are carefully and independently
balanced. And that, in turn, is absolutely essential to ensuring that accounting standards pro-
mote transparent, credible, and comparable financial information.
None of this is to say that standard setters can or should turn a blind eye to the events in
the world around us; or ignore the valid criticism and input of leaders in business, politics,
and academia; or endlessly debate and deliberate instead of act when action is required. To
the contrary, that is what the transparent process is for. It is meant to achieve results, and to
keep standards current.
Standards must keep pace with the real world to stay relevant, and they must be refined
over time to better address weaknesses, as we have recently seen with the problems in valu-
ing assets in illiquid markets. I believe it is critical that FASB complete its analysis of the
SEC’s request for expeditious improvement in the impairment model in FAS 115, made for-
mally last October, in accordance with its established independent standard-setting process.
As we have learned, illiquid markets bring new challenges to the measurement of fair
value that could not have been fully appreciated in past years. These challenges have brought
into focus the need for further work on improving the tools that companies have at their dis-
posal to achieve transparent, decision-useful financial reporting.
Transparency is the cornerstone of world-class financial reporting. Transparent and
unbiased financial reporting allows investors to make informed decisions based on a company’s
financial performance and disclosures. A clear, concise, and balanced view into the companies
that participate in our capital markets is fundamentally important to those who choose to invest
in our markets. Informed decision making results in efficient capital allocation.

When I first arrived at the SEC two months ago, I noticed a very large, framed quote prom-
inently displayed outside the Chairman’s Office. It’s a quote from former Chairman (and later
Supreme Court Justice) William O. Douglas. And, it says, “We are the investor’s advocate.”
Usually, that’s the only part of his quote we ever hear. But the full statement is more
enlightening. It reads:
We have got brokers’ advocates; we have got Exchange advocates; we have got invest-
ment banker advocates; and WE are the investors’ advocate.
The date of that quote is 1937. Seventy-two years later, there are even more advocates
for all of the various participants in our markets, but the SEC remains the only federal
agency dedicated to looking out for investors. And surely there has been no time in history
that investors have been more in need of an advocate than today.
You—the trillions of dollars that are represented in this room—need an advocate that is
strong and effective. In our time together this morning, I’d like to share with you my plans
for ensuring both.
The Role of Regulation in Our Markets
Now over the past many months, there’s been much talk in Washington and around the
globe, about the need to rethink our regulatory system. It is a discussion that has been given
urgency by the financial crisis we face—and the quest for solutions.
But as we consider how to address this crisis, I think it is useful to remember that there
are myriad reasons for how we got here. The ink on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was
hardly dry before we began to hear concerns from some quarters about the costs of “over-
regulation,” the stifling of innovation, and the superior ability of markets to protect them-
selves from excesses.
Over the last 15 years, regulations that had once walled off the less risky from
more risky parts of our financial system were incrementally weakened. Competition for
market-based financing among banks, securities firms and finance companies resulted in a
dramatic increase in leverage and risk for both corporate and consumer borrowers.
Standards deteriorated and financial activity moved away from regulated and transparent
markets and institutions, into “shadow markets.” Regulatory and enforcement resources,
most notably at the SEC, declined.
Regulatory reform will seek to address these and the many other causes of the weak-
nesses in our system and the broader economy.
The SEC’s Role
But, fixing all of these problems—whether it’s the state of our automobile industry,
the soundness of our banking system, or the integrity of our credit or derivatives markets—
will take time and involve many moving parts. I’d like to outline how I see the SEC’s role
and, as I mentioned, my plans for ensuring that the SEC is a strong and effective advocate
for investors.
Investor protection starts with fair and efficient capital markets. The SEC’s job is to
ensure that these markets are:
• First, structured effectively. This means that customer orders are priced, processed, and
cleared in an orderly and fair way.
• Second, that they’re fed by timely and reliable information. This is imperative whether
that information is provided through words or numbers.
• Third, that they’re well served by financial intermediaries and other market professio-
nals. These professionals must be competent, financially capable, and honest.
• And fourth, that they’re supported by a strong and focused enforcement arm. Returning
to former Chairman Douglas’ words, we need to have the “shotgun-behind-the-door …
loaded, well-oiled, cleaned, ready for use, but with the hope that it will never have to be
used.”
In each of the following four areas, the SEC has recently experienced both successes and
challenges.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (in Part)
Contract accounting—Contract accounting is used for development and production activities
predominately by the Aircraft and Weapons Systems (A&WS), Network Systems, Support
Systems, and Launch and Orbital Systems (L&OS) segments within Integrated Defense Sys-
tems (IDS). These activities include the following products and systems: military aircraft, heli-
copters, missiles, space systems, missile defense systems, satellites, rocket engines, and
information and battle management systems. The majority of business conducted in these seg-
ments is performed under contracts with the U.S. government and foreign governments that
extend over a number of years. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimat-
ing the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated
cost of sales percentages. For each sale contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is deter-
mined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized.
Sales related to contracts with fixed prices are recognized as deliveries are made, except
for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period
before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance
milestones. Sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an
agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. The majority of these contracts are with
the U.S. government. The Federal Acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of
cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Contracts may contain provisions
to earn incentive and award fees if targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be
reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and
award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded.
Program accounting—We use program accounting to account for sales and cost of sales
related to all our commercial airplane programs by the Commercial Airplanes segment. Pro-
gram accounting is a method of accounting applicable to products manufactured for delivery
under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and
years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling costs,
and warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by
individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (account-
ing quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for
delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to
cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be pro-
duced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected
to be produced, and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling,
and warranty costs for the total program.
We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and
accepted by the customer. Sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer,
adjusted by an escalation formula. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by
applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the
amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.
Service revenue—Service revenue is recognized when the service is performed. This method
is predominately used by our Support Systems, L&OS, and Commercial Airplanes segments.

or equipment, we record the note and any unamortized discounts. Interest income and amor-
tization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.

Revenue Recognition: The Company has a wide variety of revenue sources, including ship-
ping revenue, logistics services revenue, property sales, rental income, and sales of raw sugar,
molasses and coffee. Before recognizing revenue, the Company assesses the underlying terms
of the transaction to ensure that recognition meets the requirements of relevant accounting
standards. In general, the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery of the service or product has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Voyage Revenue Recognition: Voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a
voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period, commonly referred to as
the percentage-of-completion method. Voyage expenses are recognized as incurred.
Logistics Services Revenue Recognition: The revenue for logistics services includes the total
amount billed to customers for transportation services. The primary costs include pur-
chased transportation services. Revenue and the related purchased transportation costs are
recognized based on relative transit time, commonly referred to as the percentage-of-com-
pletion method. The Company reports revenue on a gross basis. The Company serves as
principal in transactions because it is responsible for the contractual relationship with the
customer, has latitude in establishing prices, has discretion in supplier selection, and retains
credit risk.
Real Estate Sales Revenue Recognition: Sales are recorded when the risks and rewards of
ownership have passed to the buyers (generally on closing dates), adequate initial and con-
tinuing investments have been received, and collection of remaining balances, if any, is rea-
sonably assured. For certain development projects that have material continuing post-closing
involvement and for which total revenue and capital costs are reasonably estimable, the
Company uses the percentage-of-completion method for revenue recognition. Under this
method, the amount of revenue recognized is based on development costs that have been
incurred through the reporting period as a percentage of total expected development cost
associated with the development project. This generally results in a stabilized gross margin
percentage, but requires significant judgment and estimates.
Real Estate Leasing Revenue Recognition: Real estate leasing revenue is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases, including periods for which no rent is
due (typically referred to as “rent holidays”). Differences between revenues recognized and
amounts due under respective lease agreements are recorded as increases or decreases, as ap-
plicable, to deferred rent receivable. Also included in rental revenue are certain tenant reim-
bursements and percentage rents determined in accordance with the terms of the leases.
Income arising from tenant rents that are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a
defined threshold are recognized only after the contingency has been resolved (e.g., sales
thresholds have been achieved).
Required
a. In general, what is the policy of Alexander & Baldwin for recognizing revenue?
b. Voyage Revenue Recognition: Revenue recognition – “commonly referred to as the
percentage-of-completion method.” “Voyage expenses are recognized as incurred.”
Could this represent a challenge when matching cost with revenue?
c. Logistics Services Revenue Recognition: “Revenue and the related purchased
transportation are recognized based on relative transit time, commonly referred to as the
percentage-of-completion method.” Does this appear to be reasonable?
d. Real Estate Sales Revenue Recognition: There appear to be two methods used for
revenue recognition for real estate sales. Describe these methods.
e. Real Estate Leasing Revenue Recognition: Describe this method.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of The Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and per-
form the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence support-
ing the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statements presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Indestructible I, Inc. at December 31, 2009 and 2008 and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31,
2009 and 2008 and from inception (September 19, 2003) through December 31, 2009 in
conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered losses from operations and has
a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

CASE 1-8 ECONOMICS AND ACCOUNTING: THE UNCONGENIAL TWINS*
“Economics and accountancy are two disciplines which draw their raw material from much
the same mines. From these raw materials, however, they seem to fashion remarkably differ-
ent products. They both study the operations of firms; they both are concerned with such
concepts as income, expenditure, profits, capital, value, and prices. In spite of an apparently
common subject-matter, however, they often seem to inhabit totally different worlds,
between which there is remarkably little communication.”
“It is not surprising that the economist regards much accounting procedure as in the na-
ture of ritual. To call these procedures ritualistic is in no way to deny or decry their validity.
Ritual is always the proper response when a man has to give an answer to a question, the an-
swer to which he cannot really know. Ritual under these circumstances has two functions. It
is comforting (and in the face of the great uncertainties of the future, comfort is not to be
despised), and it is also an answer sufficient for action. It is the sufficient answer rather than
the right answer which the accountant really seeks. Under these circumstances, however, it is
important that we should know what the accountant’s answer means, which means that we
should know what procedure he has employed. The wise businessman will not believe his
accountant although he takes what his accountant tells him as important evidence. The qual-
ity of that evidence, however, depends in considerable degree on the simplicity of the proce-
dures and the awareness which we have of them. What the accountant tells us may not be
true, but, if we know what he has done, we have a fair idea of what it means. For this rea-
son, I am somewhat suspicious of many current efforts to reform accounting in the direction
of making it more ‘accurate.’”

“If accounts are bound to be untruths anyhow, as I have argued, there is much to be said
for the simple untruth as against a complicated untruth, for if the untruth is simple, it seems
to me that we have a fair chance of knowing what kind of an untruth it is. A known untruth
is much better than a lie, and provided that the accounting rituals are well known and under-
stood, accounting may be untrue but it is not lies; it does not deceive because we know that
it does not tell the truth, and we are able to make our own adjustment in each individual
case, using the results of the accountant as evidence rather than as definitive information.”

CASE 1-11 REGULATION OF SMALLER PUBLIC COMPANIES
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chartered the Advisory Committee on
Smaller Public Companies on March 23, 2005. The charter provided an objective of assess-
ing the regulatory system for smaller companies under the securities laws of the United States
and makes recommendations for changes.
The SEC Advisory Committee gave its final recommendations to the SEC in April 2006.
These recommendations included several primary recommendations, such as establish a
scaled or proportional securities regulation for smaller public companies based on a stratifi-
cation of smaller public companies into two groups; micro cap companies and small cap
companies.*
The report indicates that a scales or proportional securities regulation for smaller public
companies assures the full benefits and protection of federal securities regulation for invest-
ors in large companies that make up 94% of the total public U.S. equity capital markets.…;
The committee acknowledges the relative risk to investors and the capital markets as it’s
currently used by professional investors when using proportional securities regulations.
Required It is perceived that the risk is greater when investing in smaller public companies
with proportional securities regulations than in larger companies. Speculate on why the com-
mittee considers this risk worth taking.

mission (April 23, 2006), p. 4.

CASE 1-12 STABLE FUNDING
Speech by SEC Chairman: (In Part)
Remarks Before the Financial Accounting Foundation’s 2011 Annual Board of Trustees Dinner
by
Chairman Mary L. Shapiro
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
Washington, D.C.
May 24, 2011
“Funding for the GASB and IASB
In addition to the quality of its board and staff, one reason the FASB is able to maintain
its position as a world leader is the independent and stable funding it has received, through
the issuer accounting support fee, since enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley.
And this brings me to a third area in which I believe change would benefit investors: sta-
ble funding for other standard-setting boards.
The Governmental Accounting Standards Board establishes standards that state and
local governments may elect to use when raising funds through issuance of municipal secur-
ities. And it is a leader in studying how well those standards work. Just last week, the FAF
announced that GASB has commissioned an independent study on the purposes of financial
accounting and reporting by state and local governments.
Designed to examine how GASB guidelines and standards help investors assess the
accountability of local governments and their offerings, it is a timely reminder of the impor-
tant and unique role that GASB fills.
I am pleased that the Dodd-Frank Act recognized the importance of sufficient and stable
resources by authorizing the Commission to require a national securities association to fund the
GASB by establishing an annual fee. The Commission recently directed FINRA to establish this
fee which will strengthen the independence of the GASB as the Trustees will no longer need to
solicit contributions from the very people who must apply the standards that the GASB develops.
Yet another important standard-setter, the IASB, lacks an independent and assured
source of funding, as the IFRS Foundation has no authority to impose funding requirements.
The threats of interference during the financial crisis serve as a continued reminder of the im-
portance of financial independence for the IFRS Foundation and the IASB.
I know from my role as a member of the Monitoring Board that the trustees of the IFRS
Foundation are working closely with regulatory and other public authorities and key stake-
holder groups to explore more stable funding mechanisms. Until then, however, funding for
the IASB will remain a challenge. And so the SEC’s staff continues to evaluate short-and
long-term options for assisting the IFRS Foundation. I would like to thank the FAF and its
leadership for their continued input and support on this important issue.”
Note: GASB is a branch of the Financial Accounting Foundation. The GASB is covered
in Chapter 13 Personal Financial Statements and Accounting for Governments and Not-for-
Profit Organizations.
Required
a. How is the FASB funded?
b. How is the GASB funded?
c. How is the IASB funded?
Source: U.S. Securities and Exchange
CASE 1-13 RULES OR FEEL?
The FASB and the IASB have made progress toward convergence. The IFRS standards are
considered to be more principles based than the U.S. rules-based GAAP. As of 2007, the
IFRSs filled approximately 2,000 pages of accounting regulations.* When an IFRS or inter-
pretation does not exist, then judgment must be used when applying an accounting policy.

Chapter
2
Introduction to Financial
Statements and Other
Financial Reporting
Topics
T
his chapter introduces financial statements. Subsequent chapters present a detailed
review of the principal financial statements. Chapter 3 covers the balance sheet,
Chapter 4 the income statement, and Chapter 10 the statement of cash flows.
This chapter also reviews the forms of business entities and the sequence of accounting
procedures (called the accounting cycle). Other financial reporting topics included in this
chapter that contribute to the understanding of financial reporting are: Treadway Commis-
sion, auditor’s opinion, auditor’s report on the firm’s internal controls, Report of Manage-
ment on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s responsibility for
financial statements, the SEC’s integrated disclosure system, proxy, the summary annual
report, the efficient market hypothesis, ethics, harmonization of international accounting
standards, consolidated statements, and accounting for business combinations.
Forms of Business Entities
A business entity may be a sole proprietorship, a partnership, or a corporation. A sole pro-
prietorship, a business owned by one person, is not a legal entity separate from its owner,
but the accountant treats the business as a separate accounting entity. The profit or loss of
the proprietorship goes on the income tax return of the owner. The owner is responsible for
the debts of the sole proprietorship.
In the United States, a sole proprietorship may qualify to be treated as a limited liability
company (LLC). As an LLC, the owner may limit the liability of the sole proprietor, but may
increase the tax exposure of the proprietorship.
A partnership is a business owned by two or more individuals. Each owner, called a
partner, is personally responsible for the debts of the partnership. The accountant treats the
partners and the business as separate accounting entities. The profit or loss of the partner-
ship goes on the individual income tax return of the partners. Like a proprietorship, a part-
nership may qualify to be treated as an LLC. As an LLC, the owners may limit the liability
of the partners, but may increase the tax exposure of the partnership.

In the United States, a business corporation is a legal entity incorporated in a particular
state. Ownership is evidenced by shares of stock. A corporation is considered to be separate
and distinct from the stockholders. The stockholders risk only their investment; they are not
responsible for the debts of the corporation.
Since a corporation is a legal entity, the profits or losses are treated as a separate entity
on an income tax return. The owners are not taxed until profits are distributed to the owners
(dividends). In the United States, some corporations qualify to be treated as a subchapter S
corporation. These corporations do not pay a corporate income tax. The profits or losses go
directly on the income tax returns of the owners.
In the United States, most businesses operate as proprietorships, but corporations per-
form the bulk of business activity. Because most business activity is carried on in corpora-
tions and because much of financial accounting is concerned with reporting to the public,
this book focuses on the corporate form of business.
Accounting for corporations, sole proprietorships, and partnerships is the same, except
for the owners’ equity section of the balance sheet. The owners’ equity section for a sole pro-
prietorship consists of the owners’ capital account, whereas the owners’ equity section for a
partnership has a capital account for each partner. The more complicated owners’ equity
section for a corporation will be described in detail in this book.
The Financial Statements
The principal financial statements of a corporation are the balance sheet, income statement,
and statement of cash flows. Notes accompany these financial statements. To evaluate the fi-
nancial condition, the profitability, and cash flows of an entity, the user needs to understand
the statements and related notes.
Exhibit 2-1 illustrates the interrelationship of the balance sheet, income statement, and
statement of cash flows. The most basic statement is the balance sheet; the other statements
explain the changes between two balance sheet dates.
Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position)
A balance sheet shows the financial condition of an accounting entity as of a particular date.
The balance sheet consists of three major sections: assets, the resources of the firm; liabilities,
the debts of the firm; and stockholders’ equity, the owners’ interest in the firm.
At any point in time, the total assets amount must equal the total amount of the contri-
butions of the creditors and owners. This is expressed in the accounting equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity
In simplistic form, the stockholders’ equity of a corporation appears as follows:
Stockholders’ Equity
Common stock
$200,000
Retained earnings
50,000
$250,000
This indicates that stockholders contributed (invested) $200,000, and prior earnings less
prior dividends have been retained in the entity in the net amount of $50,000 (retained earnings).
Statement of Stockholders’ Equity (Reconciliation
of Stockholders’ Equity Accounts)
Firms are required to present reconciliations of the beginning and ending balances of their
stockholders’ equity accounts. This is accomplished by presenting a “statement of stockholders’
equity.” Retained earnings is one of the accounts in stockholders’ equity.
Retained earnings links the balance sheet to the income statement. Retained earnings is
increased by net income and decreased by net losses and dividends paid to stockholders.
There are some other possible increases or decreases to retained earnings besides income
(losses) and dividends. For the purposes of this chapter, retained earnings will be described
as prior earnings less prior dividends.

Firms usually present the reconciliation of retained earnings within a “statement of stock-
holders’ equity.” Some firms present the reconciliation of retained earnings at the bottom of
the income statement (combined income statement and retained earnings). In this case, the
other stockholders’ equity accounts may be reconciled in a statement that excludes retained
earnings. An additional review of the statement of stockholders’ equity is in Chapter 3.
Income Statement (Statement of Earnings)
The income statement summarizes revenues and expenses and gains and losses, ending with
net income. It summarizes the results of operations for a particular period of time. Net
income is included in retained earnings in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance
sheet. (This is necessary for the balance sheet to balance.)

Statement of Cash Flows (Statement of Inflows and Outflows of Cash)
The statement of cash flows details the inflows and outflows of cash during a specified
period of time—the same period that is used for the income statement. The statement of cash
flows consists of three sections: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from inves-
ting activities, and cash flows from financing activities.
Notes
The notes to the financial statements are used to present additional information about items
included in the financial statements and to present additional financial information. Notes
are an integral part of financial statements. A detailed review of notes is essential to under-
standing the financial statements.
Certain information must be presented in notes. Accounting policies are to be disclosed
as the first note or in a separate summary of significant accounting policies (preceding the
first note). Accounting policies include such items as the method of inventory valuation and
depreciation policies. Other information specifically requiring note disclosure is the existence
of contingent liabilities and some subsequent events.
Contingent liabilities are dependent on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more
future events to confirm the liability. The settlement of litigation or the ruling of a tax court
would be examples of the confirmation of a contingent liability. Signing as guarantor on a
loan creates another type of contingent liability.
An estimated loss from a contingent liability should be charged to income and be estab-
lished as a liability only if the loss is considered probable and the amount is reasonably
determinable. A contingent liability that is recorded is also frequently described in a note. A
loss contingency that is reasonably possible, but not probable, must be disclosed even if the
loss is not reasonably estimable. (This loss contingency is not charged to income or estab-
lished as a liability.) A loss contingency that is less than reasonably possible does not need to
be disclosed, but disclosure may be desirable if there is an unusually large potential loss.
Exhibit 2-2 illustrates a contingent liability note for FedEx Corporation whose fiscal
year ended May 31, 2010. This contingency related to legal proceedings.
On May 13, 2009, the European Commission levied its largest ever anticompetitive fine
against Intel Corporation. The European Commission fine was for $1.45 billion.
Subsequent events occur after the balance sheet date, but before the statements are
issued. Two varieties of subsequent events are as follows. The first type consists of events
related to conditions that existed at the balance sheet date, affect the estimates in the state-
ments, and require adjustment of the statements before issuance. For example, if additional
information is obtained indicating that a major customer’s account receivable is not collecti-
ble, an adjustment will be made. The second type consists of events that provide evidence
about conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date and do not require adjustment
of the statements. If failure to disclose these events would be misleading, disclosure should
take the form of notes or supplementary schedules. Examples of the second type of such

The Accounting Cycle
The sequence of accounting procedures completed during each accounting period is called
the accounting cycle. A broad summary of the steps of the accounting cycle includes:
1. Recording transactions
2. Recording adjusting entries
3. Preparing the financial statements
Recording Transactions
A transaction is an event that causes a change in a company’s assets, liabilities, or stockhold-
ers’ equity, thus changing the company’s financial position. Transactions may be external or
internal to the company. External transactions involve outside parties, while internal trans-
actions are confined within the company. For example, sales is an external transaction,
whereas the use of equipment is internal.
Transactions must be recorded in a journal (book of original entry). All transactions
could be recorded in the general journal. However, companies use a number of special
journals to record most transactions. The special journals are designed to improve record-
keeping efficiency that could not be obtained by using only the general journal. The general
journal is then used only to record transactions for which the company does not have a spe-
cial journal. A transaction recorded in a journal is referred to as a journal entry.
All transactions are recorded in a journal (journal entry) and are later posted from the
journals to a general ledger (group of accounts for a company). After posting, the general
ledger accounts contain the same information as the journals, but the information has been
summarized by account.
Accounts store the monetary information from the recording of transactions. Examples
of accounts include Cash, Land, and Buildings. An accounting system can be computerized
or manual. A manual system using T-accounts is usually used for textbook explanations
because a T-account is a logical format.
T-accounts have a left (debit) side and a right (credit) side. An example T-account follows:
Cash
Debit
Credit

Subsequent to the end of our fourth quarter, we decided to place our Long John Silver’s and A&W
All-American Food Restaurants brands for sale and began the process to identify a buyer. In the first
quarter of 2011, we anticipate that we will recognize a non-cash pre-tax impairment loss in Special
Items as a result of our decision to sell. The amount of the expected pre-tax loss as well as the related
tax impact will be dependent upon indications we receive as to potential sales prices and structures.
We do not expect the eventual sale to have a material impact to our ongoing earnings or cash flows.

A double-entry system has been devised to handle the recording of transactions. In a
double-entry system, each transaction is recorded, with the total dollar amount of the debits
equal to the total dollar amount of the credits. The scheme of the double-entry system
revolves around the accounting equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity
With the double-entry system, debit merely means the left side of an account, while
credit means the right side. Each transaction recorded must have an equal number of dollars
on the left side as it does on the right side. Several accounts could be involved in a single
transaction, but the debits and credits must still be equal.
The debit and credit technique has gained acceptance over a long period of time. This
book will not make you competent in the use of the double-entry (debit and credit) tech-
nique. Rather, it will enhance your understanding of the end result of the accounting process
and enable you to use the financial accounting information in a meaningful way.
Asset, liability, and stockholders’ equity accounts are referred to as permanent accounts
because the balances in these accounts carry forward to the next accounting period. Balances
in revenue, expense, gain, loss, and dividend accounts, described as temporary accounts, are
closed to retained earnings and not carried into the next period.
Exhibit 2-4 illustrates the double-entry system. Notice that the permanent accounts are
represented by the accounting equation: assets = liabilities + stockholders’ equity. The tem-
porary accounts are represented by revenue, expense, and dividends. (Gains and losses
would be treated like revenue and expense, respectively.) The balance sheet will not balance
until the temporary accounts are closed to retained earnings.

Recording Adjusting Entries
Earlier, a distinction was made between the accrual basis of accounting and the cash basis. It
was indicated that the accrual basis requires that revenue be recognized when realized (real-
ization concept) and expenses recognized when incurred (matching concept). The point of
cash receipt for revenue and cash disbursement for expenses is not important under the
accrual basis when determining income. Usually, a company must use the accrual basis to
achieve a reasonable result for the balance sheet and the income statement.
The accrual basis needs numerous adjustments to account balances at the end of the
accounting period. For example, $1,000 paid for insurance on October 1 for a one-year period
(October 1–September 30) could have been recorded as a debit to Insurance Expense ($1,000)
and a credit to Cash ($1,000). If this company prepares financial statements on December 31,
it would be necessary to adjust Insurance Expense because not all of the insurance expense
should be recognized in the three-month period October 1–December 31. The adjustment
would debit Prepaid Insurance, an asset account, for $750 and credit Insurance Expense for
$750. Thus, insurance expense would be presented on the income statement for this period as
$250, and an asset, prepaid insurance, would be presented on the balance sheet as $750.
Adjusting entries are recorded in the general journal and then posted to the general ledger.
Once the accounts are adjusted to the accrual basis, the financial statements can be prepared.
Preparing the Financial Statements
The accountant uses the accounts after the adjustments have been made to prepare the finan-
cial statements. These statements represent the output of the accounting system. Two of the
principal financial statements, the income statement and the balance sheet, can be prepared
directly from the adjusted accounts. Preparation of the statement of cash flows requires fur-
ther analysis of the accounts.
Treadway Commission
Treadway Commission is the popular name for the National Commission on Fraudulent
Reporting named after its first chairman, former SEC Commissioner James C. Treadway.
The Commission has issued a number of recommendations for the prevention of fraud in fi-
nancial reports, ethics, and effective internal controls. The Treadway Commission is a volun-
tary private-sector organization formed in 1985.1
The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) has
released reports detailing internal control systems. These reports represent the standard for
evaluating the effectiveness of internal control systems.
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act emphasizes the importance of internal control
and makes management responsible for internal controls. The independent public account-
ing firm is required to give an opinion as to management’s assessment of internal control
and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of the balance sheet date.
The Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the inde-
pendent public accounting firm report to the shareholders, and the board of directors often
refers to the criteria established on internal control by COSO.
Auditor’s Opinion
An auditor (certified public accountant) conducts an independent examination of the
accounting information presented by the business and issues a report thereon. An auditor’s
report is the formal statement of the auditor’s opinion of the financial statements after con-
ducting an audit. Audit opinions are classified as follows:
1. UNQUALIFIED OPINION. This opinion states that the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows of the entity, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
2. QUALIFIED OPINION. A qualified opinion states that, except for the effects of the
matter(s) to which the qualification relates, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the
entity, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

3. ADVERSE OPINION. This opinion states that the financial statements do not present
fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the entity, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
4. DISCLAIMER OF OPINION. A disclaimer of opinion states that the auditor does not
express an opinion on the financial statements. A disclaimer of opinion is rendered when
the auditor has not performed an audit sufficient in scope to form an opinion.
Since the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley, the form of the audit opinion can vary substan-
tially. Private companies are not under Sarbanes-Oxley, but an increasing number of private
companies are complying with parts of the law. Some of the reasons for private companies
to follow the law are the following:
1. Owners hope to sell the company or take it public.
2. Directors who sit on public company boards see the law’s benefits.
3. Executives believe strong internal controls will improve efficiency.
4. Customers require strong internal controls.
5. Lenders are more likely to approve loans.2
The typical unqualified (or clean) opinion for private companies has three paragraphs.
The first paragraph indicates that the financial statements have been audited and are the
responsibility of the company’s management. This paragraph states that the auditors have
the responsibility to either express an opinion on these statements based on the audit or to
disclaim an opinion.
The second paragraph indicates that the audit has been conducted in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards. This will typically be expressed in terms of standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). These standards require
the auditor to plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. This paragraph also confirms that the
audit provided a reasonable basis for an opinion.
The third paragraph gives an opinion on the statements—that they are in conformity
with GAAP. In certain circumstances, an unqualified opinion on the financial statements
may require that the auditor add an explanatory paragraph after the opinion paragraph. In
this paragraph, the auditor may express agreement with a departure from a designated prin-
ciple, describe a material uncertainty, detail a change in accounting principle, or express
doubt as to the ability of the entity to continue as a going concern. An explanatory para-
graph may also be added to emphasize a particular matter.
The audit opinion of a public company is similar to an opinion for a private company
except that the public company comments will be added as to the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. An opinion is expressed as to management’s assessment of,
and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.
When examining financial statements, review the independent auditor’s report. It can be
important to your analysis. From the point of view of analysis, financial statements accompa-
nied by an unqualified opinion without an explanatory paragraph or explanatory language
carry the highest degree of reliability. This type of report indicates that the financial statements
do not contain a material departure from GAAP and that the audit was not limited as to scope.
When an unqualified opinion contains an explanatory paragraph or explanatory lan-
guage, try to decide how seriously to regard the departure from a straight unqualified opin-
ion. For example, an explanatory paragraph because of a change in accounting principle
would not usually be regarded as serious, although it would be important to your analysis.
An explanatory paragraph because of a material uncertainty would often be regarded as a
serious matter.
You are likely to regard a qualified opinion or an adverse opinion as casting serious
doubts on the reliability of the financial statements. In each case, you must read the auditor’s
report carefully to form your opinion.
A disclaimer of opinion indicates that you should not look to the auditor’s report as
an indication of the reliability of the statements. When rendering this type of report, the
auditor has not performed an audit sufficient in scope to form an opinion, or the auditor is
not independent.

In some cases, outside accountants are associated with financial statements when they
have performed less than an audit. The accountant’s report then indicates that the financial
statements have been reviewed or compiled.
A review consists principally of inquiries made to company personnel and analytical
procedures applied to financial data. It has substantially less scope than an examination in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is the expres-
sion of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, the
accountant does not express an opinion. The accountant’s report will indicate that the
accountants are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the finan-
cial statements in order for them to be in conformity with GAAP; or the report will indicate
departures from GAAP. A departure from GAAP may result from using one or more
accounting principles without reasonable justification, the omission of necessary note disclo-
sures, or the omission of the statement of cash flows.
In general, the reliance that can be placed on financial statements accompanied by an
accountant’s review report is substantially less than those accompanied by an audit report.
Remember that the accountant’s report does not express an opinion on reviewed financial
statements.
When the outside accountant presents only financial information as provided by man-
agement, he or she is said to have compiled the financial statements. The compilation report
states that the accountant has not audited or reviewed the financial statements. Therefore,
the accountant does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance about them. If
an accountant performs a compilation and becomes aware of deficiencies in the statements,
then the accountant’s report characterizes the deficiencies as follows:
• Omission of substantially all disclosures
• Omission of statement of cash flows
• Accounting principles not generally accepted
Sometimes financial statements are presented without an accompanying accountant’s
report. This means that the statements have not been audited, reviewed, or compiled. Such
statements are solely the representation of management.
Auditor’s Report on the Firm’s Internal Controls
For public companies reporting under Sarbanes-Oxley, a report on the firm’s internal con-
trols is required in addition to the audit report. The internal control report is usually much
longer than the audit report. For some firms, the audit opinion and the report on the firm’s
internal controls have been combined. This results in one audit report that can be very long.

opinion. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., is a public company reporting under Sarbanes-Oxley.

We have audited T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (“the Company”) internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining

ternal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal con-
trol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the cir-
cumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstate-

sures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial state-
ment presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010

Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Under Sarbanes-Oxley, management of public companies must present a Report of Management
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Exhibit 2-7 presents the internal control report of
management for T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., that was presented with its 2010 annual report.
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A com-
pany’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or dis-
position of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are sub-
ject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria estab-
lished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organi-
zations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2010, and our report dated February 8, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion on
those consolidated financial statements.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
To the Stockholders of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.:
We, together with other members of management of T. Rowe Price Group, are responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the company’s financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is the process designed under our supervision, and
effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide rea-
sonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the com-
pany’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements
The responsibility for the preparation and for the integrity of financial statements rests with
management. The auditor is responsible for conducting an independent examination of the
statements and expressing an opinion on the financial statements based on the audit. To
make financial statement users aware of management’s responsibility, some companies have
presented management statements to shareholders as part of the annual report. Exhibit 2-8
shows an example of a report of management’s responsibility for financial statements as pre-
sented by Kellogg Company in its 2010 annual report.
There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility that misstatements may not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, even effective internal
controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial state-
ment preparation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of internal controls can change with circumstances.
Management has evaluated the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2010, in relation to criteria described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Based on management’s assessment, we believe that the company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our financial state-
ments that are included in this annual report and expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
KPMG has also expressed an unqualified opinion on the effective operation of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements – 2010 Annual Report
Management is responsible for the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial state-
ments and related notes. We believe that the consolidated financial statements present the Com-
pany’s financial position and results of operations in conformity with accounting principles that
are generally accepted in the United States, using our best estimates and judgments as required.
The independent registered public accounting firm audits the Company’s consolidated financial state-
ments in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and pro-
vides an objective, independent review of the fairness of reported operating results and financial position.
The board of directors of the Company has an Audit Committee composed of five non-
management Directors. The Committee meets regularly with management, internal auditors, and
the independent registered public accounting firm to review accounting, internal control, auditing
and financial reporting matters.
Formal policies and procedures, including an active Ethics and Business Conduct program, sup-
port the internal controls and are designed to ensure employees adhere to the highest standards of
personal and professional integrity. We have a rigorous internal audit program that independently
evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of these internal controls.

The SEC’s Integrated Disclosure System
In general, in the United States, the SEC has the authority to prescribe external financial report-
ing requirements for companies with securities sold to the general public. Under this jurisdic-
tion, the SEC requires that certain financial statement information be included in the annual
report to shareholders. This annual report, along with certain supplementary information,
must then be included, or incorporated by reference, in the annual filing to the SEC, known as
the 10-K report or Form 10-K. The Form 10-K is due 60 days, 75 days, or 90 days following
the end of the company’s fiscal year, depending on the market value of the common stock (see
Exhibit 2-9). The annual report and the Form 10-K include audited financial statements.
The SEC promotes an integrated disclosure system between the annual report and the Form
10-K. The goals are to improve the quality of disclosure, lighten the disclosure load, standardize
information requirements, and achieve uniformity of annual reports and Form 10-K filings.
In addition to the company’s primary financial statements, the Form 10-K must include
the following:
1. Information on the market for holders of common stock and related securities, including
high and low sales price, frequency and amount of dividends, and number of shares.
2. Five-year summary of selected financial data, including net sales or operating revenues,
income from continuing operations, total assets, long-term obligations, redeemable
preferred stock, and cash dividends per share. (Some companies elect to present data for
more than five years and/or expand the disclosure.) Trend analysis is emphasized.
3. Management’s discussion and analysis (MDA) of financial condition and results of
operations. Specifically required is discussion of liquidity, capital resources, and results
of operations.
4. Two years of audited balance sheets and three years of audited income statements and
statements of cash flow.
5. Disclosure of the domestic and foreign components of pretax income, unless foreign
components are considered to be immaterial.
SEC requirements force management to focus on the financial statements as a whole,
rather than on just the income statement and operations. Where trend information is rele-
vant, discussion should center on the five-year summary. Emphasis should be on favorable
or unfavorable trends and on identification of significant events or uncertainties. This discus-
sion should provide the analyst with a reasonable summary of the position of the firm.
Exhibit 2-10 presents a summary of the major parts of the Form 10-K. In practice, some
of the required information in the Form 10-K is incorporated by reference. Incorporated by
reference means that the information is presented outside the Form 10-K, and a reference in
the Form 10-K indicates where the information can be found.
A review of a company’s Form 10-K can reveal information that is not available in the
annual report. For example, Item 2 of the Form 10-K reveals a detailed listing of properties
and indicates if the property is leased or owned.

In addition to the Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, a Form 8-K must be submitted to the
SEC to report special events. Some events required to be reported are changes in principal
stockholders, changes in auditors, acquisitions and divestitures, bankruptcy, and resignation
of directors. The Form 8-K is due 15 days following the event.
The Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings are available to the public. Many companies are
reluctant to send these reports to nonstockholders. In public companies, these reports can be
found at www.sec.gov.
Proxy
The proxy, the solicitation sent to stockholders for the election of directors and for the ap-
proval of other corporation actions, represents the shareholder authorization regarding the
casting of that shareholder’s vote. The proxy contains notice of the annual meeting, benefi-
cial ownership (name, address, and share ownership data of shareholders holding more than
5% of outstanding shares), board of directors, standing committees, compensation of direc-
tors, compensation of executive officers, employee benefit plans, certain transactions with
officers and directors, relationship with independent accountants, and other business.
The proxy rules provided under the 1934 Securities Exchange Act are applicable to all
securities registered under Section 12 of the Act. The SEC gains its influence over the annual
report through provisions of the Act that cover proxy statements.
The SEC’s proxy rules of particular interest to investors involve executive compensation
disclosure, performance graph, and retirement plans for executive officers. These rules are
designed to improve shareholders’ understanding of the compensation paid to senior execu-
tives and directors, the criteria used in reaching compensation decisions, and the relationship
between compensation and corporate performance.
Among other matters, the executive compensation rules call for four highly formatted
disclosure tables and the disclosure of the compensation committee’s basis for compensation
decisions.
The four tables disclosing executive compensation are as follows:
• A summary executive compensation table covering compensation for the company’s
chief executive officer and its four other most highly compensated executives for the last
three years.
• Two tables detailing options and stock appreciation rights.
• A long-term incentive plan award table.
The performance graph is a line graph comparing the cumulative total shareholder
return with performance indicators of the overall stock market and either the published
industry index or the registrant-determined peer comparison. This performance graph must
be presented for a five-year period.
The pension plan table for executive officers discloses the estimated annual benefits pay-
able upon retirement for any defined benefit or actuarial plan under which benefits are deter-
mined primarily by final compensation (or average final compensation) and years of service.
Immediately following the table, additional disclosure is required. This disclosure includes
items such as the relationship of the covered compensation to the compensation reported in

Summary Annual Report
A reporting option available to public companies is to issue a summary annual report. A
summary annual report, a condensed report, omits much of the financial information typi-
cally included in an annual report. A typical full annual report has more financial pages than
nonfinancial pages. A summary annual report generally has more nonfinancial pages.3 When
a company issues a summary annual report, the proxy materials it sends to shareholders
must include a set of fully audited statements and other required financial disclosures.
A summary annual report is not adequate for reasonable analysis. For companies that
issue a summary annual report, request a copy of their proxy and the Form 10-K. Even for
companies that issue a full annual report, it is also good to obtain a copy of the proxy mate-
rials and the Form 10-K. Some companies issue a joint annual report and Form 10-K, while
other companies issue a joint annual report and proxy. A few companies issue a joint annual
report, Form 10-K, and proxy. These joint reports are usually labeled as the annual report.
The Efficient Market Hypothesis
The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) relates to the ability of capital markets to generate
prices for securities that reflect worth. The EMH implies that publicly available information
is fully reflected in share prices. The market will not be efficient if the market does not have
access to relevant information or if fraudulent information is provided.
There seems to be little doubt that the FASB and the SEC assess the impact of their
actions on security prices. The SEC has been particularly sensitive to insider trading because
abnormal returns could be achieved by the use of insider information.
If the market is efficient, investors may be harmed when firms do not follow a full dis-
closure policy. In an efficient market, the method of disclosure is not as important as
whether the item is disclosed. It should not matter whether an item is disclosed in the body
of the financial statements or in the notes. It is the disclosure rather than how to disclose that
is the substantive issue.
Usually, there is a cost to disclose. An attempt should be made to determine the value of
additional disclosure in relation to the additional cost. Disclosure should be made when the
perceived benefits exceed the additional cost to provide the disclosure.
It is generally recognized that the market is more efficient when dealing with large firms
trading on large organized stock markets than it is for small firms that are not trading on
large organized stock markets.
Although the research evidence regarding the EMH is conflicting, this hypothesis has
taken on an important role in financial reporting in the United States.
Ethics
“Ethics and morals are synonymous. While ethics is derived from Greek, morals is derived from
Latin. They are interchangeable terms referring to ideals of character and conduct. These ideals,
in the form of codes of conduct, furnish criteria for distinguishing between right and wrong.”4
Ethics has been a subject of investigation for hundreds of years. Individuals in financial posi-
tions must be able to recognize ethical issues and resolve them in an appropriate manner.
Source: Mary E. Guy, Ethical Decision Making in Everyday Work Situations (New York:
Quorum Books, 1990), p. 5
Ethics affect all individuals—from the financial clerk to the high-level financial execu-
tive. Individuals make daily decisions based on their individual values. Some companies and
professional organizations have formulated a code of ethics as a statement of aspirations
and a standard of integrity beyond that required by law (which can be viewed as the mini-
mum standard of ethics).

Ten essential values can be considered central to relations between people.5
1. Caring
2. Honesty
3. Accountability
4. Promise keeping
5. Pursuit of excellence
6. Loyalty
7. Fairness
8. Integrity
9. Respect for others
10. Responsible citizenship
Ethics can be a particular problem with financial reports. Accepted accounting principles
leave ample room for arriving at different results in the short run. Highly subjective estimates
can substantially influence earnings. What provision should be made for warranty costs?
What should be the loan loss reserve? What should be the allowance for doubtful accounts?
In 1988 the American Accounting Association initiated a project on professionalism and
ethics. One of the goals of this project was to provide students with a framework for evaluat-
ing their courses of action when encountering ethical dilemmas. The American Accounting
Association developed a decision model for focusing on ethical issues.6
1. Determine the facts—what, who, where, when, how.
2. Define the ethical issues (includes identifying the identifiable parties affected by the
decision made or action taken).
3. Identify major principles, rules, and values.
4. Specify the alternatives.
5. Compare norms, principles, and values with alternatives to see if a clear decision can be
reached.
6. Assess the consequences.
7. Make your decision.
EXAMPLE 1: QUESTIONABLE ETHICS IN SAVINGS AND LOANS
In connection with the savings and loan (S&L) scandal, it was revealed that several audi-
tors of thrift institutions borrowed substantial amounts from the S&L that their firm was
auditing. It was charged that some of the loans involved special consideration.7 In one
case, dozens of partners of a major accounting firm borrowed money for commercial real
estate loans, and some of the partners defaulted on their loans when the real estate mar-
ket collapsed.8 It was not clear whether these particular loans violated professional ethics
standards. The AICPA subsequently changed its ethics standards to ban all such loans.
In another case, an accounting firm paid $1.5 million to settle charges by the Cali-
fornia State Board of Accountancy that the accounting firm was grossly negligent in its
audit of Lincoln Savings & Loan. The accounting board charged that the firm had
agreed to the improper recognition of approximately $62 million in profits.9
EXAMPLE 2: QUESTIONABLE ETHICS IN THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY
Hollywood’s accounting practices have often been labeled “mysterious.”10 A case in
point is Art Buchwald’s lawsuit against Paramount Pictures for breach of contract
regarding the film Coming to America. Paramount took an option on Buchwald’s story
“King for a Day” in 1983 and promised Buchwald 1.5% of the net profits of the film.
Buchwald’s attorney, Pierce O’Donnell, accused Paramount Studios of “fatal subtrac-
tion” in determining the amount of profit. Although the film grossed $350 million
worldwide, Paramount claimed an $18 million net loss. As a result of the studio’s
accounting practices, Buchwald was to get 1.5% of nothing.11 Buchwald was eventually
awarded $150,000 in a 1992 court decision.12

Many Hollywood celebrities, in addition to Art Buchwald, have sued over
Hollywood-style accounting. These include Winston Groom over the movie rights to
Forrest Gump, Jane Fonda over a larger share of profits relating to On Golden Pond,
and James Garner over his share of profits from The Rockford Files (a television pro-
gram). Some of Hollywood’s best creative work is in accounting.
EXAMPLE 3: QUESTIONABLE ETHICS IN THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY
In recent years, the SEC has charged numerous individuals with operating a Ponzi
scheme. The largest of these schemes in history came to light in 2008 when Bernard
Madoff was charged with operating a giant Ponzi scheme of over $50 billion. Ponzi
schemes are a type of pyramid scheme. They are named after Charles Ponzi, who duped
investors into a postage stamp speculation back in the 1920s. None of the money, or
only a small amount of the money, is invested. The party running the Ponzi scheme
spends the money and uses proceeds to pay off investors who want their money back.
SEC Requirements—Code of Ethics
In January 2003, the SEC voted to require disclosure in a company’s annual report as to
whether it has a code of ethics that applies to the company’s principal executive officer, prin-
cipal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing simi-
lar functions. The rules will define a code of ethics as written standards that are reasonably
necessary to deter wrongdoing and to promote:
1. Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships.
2. Full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that
a company files with, or submits to, the Commission and in other public
communications made by the company.
3. Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations.
4. The prompt internal reporting of code violations to an appropriate person or persons
identified in the code.
5. Accountability for adherence to the code.13
The SEC requires that a copy of the company’s code of ethics be made available by filing
an exhibit with its annual report (10-K) or by providing it on the company’s Web site.
The SEC requirements were an outcome of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Exhibit 2-12
presents NIKE’s code of ethics.

Consolidated Statements
Financial statements of legally separate entities may be issued to show financial position,
income, and cash flow as they would appear if the companies were a single entity (consoli-
dated). Such statements reflect an economic, rather than a legal, concept of the entity. For
consolidated statements, all transactions between the entities being consolidated—intercom-
pany transactions—must be eliminated.
When a subsidiary is less than 100% owned and its statements are consolidated, minor-
ity shareholders must be recognized in the consolidated financial statements by showing the
noncontrolling interest under stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet and the noncontrol-
ling interest in income on the income statement. Noncontrolling accounts are discussed in
detail in Chapter 3.
Consolidated statements are financial statements that a parent company produces when
its financial statements and those of a subsidiary are added together. This portrays the result-
ing financial statements as a single company. The parent company concept emphasizes the
interests of the controlling shareholders (the parent’s shareholders). A subsidiary is a com-
pany controlled by another company. An unconsolidated subsidiary is accounted for as an
investment on the parent’s balance sheet.
Two reporting approaches can be used to present consolidated statements. In one
approach, the subsidiary’s accounts are shown separately from the parent’s. This format is
logical when the parent has a subsidiary in a different line of business. Ford Motor Company
consolidates presenting the automotive and financial services category separately.
Most companies consolidate the parents and subsidiary accounts summed. The Dow
Chemical Company consolidates summing the accounts.
The parent company can have legal control with ownership of a majority of the subsid-
iary’s outstanding voting shares. The parent company can have effective control when a ma-
jority of the subsidiary board of directors can be elected by means other than by having legal
control.
A company could have ownership of the majority voting shares and not have control.
Such a situation would be a subsidiary that has filed for bankruptcy protection. In the bank-
ruptcy situation, the judge in the bankruptcy court has assumed control.
Control can be gained by means other than obtaining majority stock ownership. The
FASB recognizes a risks, rewards, decision-making ability and the primary beneficiary. Thus,
consolidation would be required when a firm bears the majority (over 50%) of the risks and/
or rewards of ownership. Examples of consolidating because of risks, rewards, and decision-
making ability would be a contractual situation to accept substantial production or a loan
situation which grants substantial control.
The consolidation of financial statements has been a practice in the United States for
years; however, this has not been the case for many other nations. Some countries do not
consolidate. Other countries use consolidation with different rules.
The IASC passed a standard that requires that all controlled subsidiaries be consoli-
dated. Although IASC standards cannot be enforced, this standard will likely increase the ac-
ceptance of consolidation.

Accounting for Business Combinations
The combination of business entities by merger or acquisition is very frequent. There are
many possible reasons for this external business expansion, including achieving economies
of scale and savings of time in entering a new market. The combination must be accounted
for using the purchase method.
The purchase method views the business combination as the acquisition of one entity by
another. The firm doing the acquiring records the identifiable assets and liabilities at fair
value at the date of acquisition. The difference between the fair value of the identifiable
assets and liabilities and the amount paid is recorded as goodwill (an asset).
With a purchase, the acquiring firm picks up the income of the acquired firm from the
date of acquisition. Retained earnings of the acquired firm do not continue.
SEC – Paper Filings – EDGAR – XBRL
In Chapter One it was reported that the Securities Act of 1933 was designed to protect
investors from abuses in financial reporting in the United States. This act was intended to
regulate the initial offering and sale of securities in interstate commerce. Also in Chapter
One, it was reported that, in general, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was intended to
regulate securities trading on the national exchanges, and it was under this authority that the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was created.
The SEC requires companies with securities sold to the general public to submit various
reports. Among these reports are the Form 10-K (annual report) and from 10-Q (quarterly report).
The SEC required these reports to be filed using paper documents. By 1996, the SEC in-
stalled its electronic disclosure system, EDGAR. The SEC made the EDGAR filings available
on the internet. Not all reports to the SEC are made available on EDGAR.
In 2004 the SEC began investigating the possibility of having documents submitted in a
tagged format (XBRL). XBRL stands for Extensible Business Reporting Language. The
XBRL approach does not eliminate the existing filing requirements. The XBRL approach is
not unique with the SEC as it is used for many products and many countries; for example,
the bar code for items in a grocery store. Many countries have started to use bar codes (inter-
active data) in their financial disclosure statements.
With XBRL and the proper software, data users such as analysts and investors can extract
financial data. This is much more efficient than sorting through many pages of data.
A firm submits the data to the SEC in EDGAR form and XBRL form at the same time.
When using the internet and searching for the 10-K, the EDGAR form is indicated as “Docu-
ments” and the XBRL form is indicated as “Interactive Data.”
The EDGAR form of the 10-K will have all parts of the 10-K (Exhibit 2-10), while the
XBRL form will only have Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The XBRL
presents a summary of the statements, notes, etc., while the EDGAR form presents the state-
ments and then the notes. This comparison only applies to Item 8 in the 10-K.
There is a similar situation with the 10-Q. In this case, the entire quarterly report has 10
items (Exhibit 2-11). All are included with the EDGAR version. Only Item 1 is presented
with the XBRL version.
In the section “To the Net” at the back of chapters in this book, there are many exer-
cises where the SEC website, www.sec.gov, is used. These exercises usually only reference
the financial statements and notes. These exercises can be worked using either the EDGAR
form “Documents” or the XBRL from “Interactive Data.” As indicated previously, a more
meaningful use of the XBRL “Interactive Data” will require proper software.

Summary
This chapter includes an introduction to the basic financial
statements. Later chapters will cover these statements in detail.
An understanding of the sequence of accounting proce-
dures completed during each accounting period, called the
accounting cycle, will help in understanding the end
result—financial statements.
This chapter describes the forms of business entities,
which are sole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation.

Management is responsible for financial statements.
These statements are examined by auditors who express
an opinion regarding the statements’ conformity to GAAP
in the auditor’s report. The auditor’s report often points
out key factors that can affect financial statement analysis.
The SEC has begun a program to integrate the Form 10-K
requirements with those of the annual report.
A reporting option available to public companies, a
summary annual report (a condensed annual report), omits
much of the financial information included in a typical an-
nual report.
The EMH relates to the ability of capital markets to
generate prices for securities that reflect worth. The mar-
ket will not be efficient if the market does not have access
to relevant information or if fraudulent information is
provided.
Individuals in financial positions must be able to recog-
nize ethical issues and resolve them appropriately.
Financial statements of legally separate entities may be
issued to show financial position, income, and cash flow as
they would appear if the companies were a single entity
(consolidated).
The combination of business entities by merger or ac-
quisition is very frequent. An understanding of how a busi-
ness combination can impact the basic statements is
important to the analyst.

Cases
CASE 2-1 THE CEO RETIRES*
Dan Murphy awoke at 5:45 A.M., just like he did every workday morning. No matter that he
went to sleep only four hours ago. The Orange Bowl game had gone late into the evening,
and the New Year’s Day party was so good, no one wanted to leave. At least Dan could
awake easily this morning. Some of his guests had lost a little control celebrating the first
day of the new year, and Dan was not a person who ever lost control.

The drive to the office was easier than most days. Perhaps there were a great many
parties last night. All the better as it gave Dan time to think. The dawn of a new year, his
last year. Dan would turn 65 next December, and the company had a mandatory retirement
policy. A good idea he thought, to get new blood in the organization. At least that’s what he
thought on the climb up. From just another college graduate within the corporate staff, all
the way to the chief executive officer’s suite. It certainly is a magnificent view from the top.
To be CEO of his own company. Well, not really, as it was the stockholders’ company,
but he had been CEO for the past eight years. Now he, too, must turn the reins over.
“Must,” now that’s the operative word. He knew it was the best thing for the company.
Turnover kept middle management aggressive, but he also knew that he wouldn’t leave if he
had a choice. So Dan resolved to make his last year the company’s best year ever.
It was that thought that kept his attention, yet the focus of consideration and related
motivations supporting such a strategy changed as he continued to strategize. At first, Dan
thought that it would be a fine way to give something back to a company that had given
him so much. His 43 years with the company had given him challenges that filled his life
with meaning and satisfaction, provided him with a good living, and made him a man
respected and listened to in the business community. But the thought that the company was
also forcing him to give all that up made his thoughts turn more inward.
Of course, the company had done many things for him, but what of all the sacrifices he
had made? His whole heart and soul were tied to the company. In fact, one could hardly
think of Dan Murphy without thinking of the company, in much the same way as prominent
corporate leaders and their firms are intrinsically linked. But the company would still be here
this time next year, and what of him? Yes, he would leave the company strong, because by
leaving it strong, it would strengthen his reputation as a great leader. His legacy would carry
and sustain him over the years. But would it? One must also live in a manner consistent with
such esteem.
Being the CEO of a major company also has its creature comforts. Dan was accustomed
to a certain style of living. How much will that suffer after the salary, bonuses, and stock
options are no more?
Arriving at the office by 7:30 A.M., he left a note for his secretary that he was not to be
disturbed until 9 A.M. He pulled out the compensation file and examined the incentive
clauses in his own contract. The contract was created by the compensation committee of the
Board of Directors. All of the committee members were outsiders, that is, not a part of the
company’s management. This lends the appearance of independence, but most were CEOs
of their own companies, and Dan knew that, by and large, CEOs take care of their own. His
suspicions were confirmed. If the company’s financial results were the best ever this year,
then so, too, would be his own personal compensation.
Yet what if there were uncontrollable problems? The general economy appeared fairly
stable. However, another oil shock, some more bank failures, or a list of other disasters
could turn things into a downward spiral quickly. Economies are easily influenced and con-
sumer and corporate psychology can play a large part in determining outcomes. But even in
apparently uncontrollable circumstances, Dan knew he could protect himself and the finan-
cial fortunes of his company during the short term, which after all, was the only thing that
mattered.
Upon further review of his compensation contract, Dan saw that a large portion of his
bonus and stock options was a function of operating income levels, earnings per share, and
return on assets. So the trick was to maximize those items. If he did, the company would
appear vibrant and poised for future growth at the time of his forced retirement, he
reminded himself. Furthermore, his total compensation in the last year of his employment
would reach record proportions. Additionally, since his pension is based on the average of
his last three years’ compensation, Dan will continue to reap the benefits of this year’s results
for hopefully a long time to come. And who says CEOs don’t think long term?
Two remaining issues needed to be addressed. Those were (1) how to ensure a record-
breaking year and (2) how to overcome any objections raised in attaining those results.
Actually, the former was a relatively simple goal to achieve. Since accounting allows so many
alternatives in the way financial events are measured, Dan could just select a package of
alternatives, which would maximize the company’s earnings and return on assets. Some

alternatives may result in changing an accounting method, but since the new auditing stand-
ards were issued, his company could still receive an unqualified opinion from his auditors,
with only a passing reference to any accounting changes in the auditor’s opinion and its
effects disclosed in the footnotes. As long as the alternative was allowed by generally
accepted accounting principles, and the justification for the change was reasonable, the audi-
tors should not object. If there were objections, Dan could always threaten to change audi-
tors. But still the best avenue to pursue would be a change in accounting estimates, since
those changes did not even need to be explicitly disclosed.
So Dan began to mull over what changes in estimates or methods he could employ in
order to maximize his firm’s financial appearance. In the area of accounting estimates, Dan
could lower the rate of estimated default on his accounts receivable, thus lowering bad debt
expense. The estimated useful lives of his plant and equipment could be extended, thus low-
ering depreciation expense. In arguing that quality improvements have been implemented in
the manufacturing process, the warranty expense on the products sold could also be low-
ered. In examining pension expense, he noted that the assumed rate of return on pension
assets was at a modest 6.5%, so if that rate could be increased, the corresponding pension
expense could be reduced.
Other possibilities occurred to Dan. Perhaps items normally expensed, such as repairs,
could be capitalized. Those repairs that could not be capitalized could simply be deferred.
The company could also defer short-term expenses for the training of staff. Since research
and development costs must now be fully expensed as incurred; a reduction in those expen-
ditures would increase net income. Return on assets would be increased by not acquiring
any new fixed assets. Production levels for inventory could be increased, thus spreading fixed
costs over a greater number of units and reducing the total average cost per unit. Therefore,
gross profit per unit will increase. Inventory levels would be a little bloated, but that should
be easily handled by Dan’s successor.
The prior examples are subtle changes that could be made. As a last resort, a change in
accounting methods could be employed. This would require explicit footnote disclosure and
a comment in the auditor’s report, but if it came to that, it would still be tolerable. Examples
of such changes would be to switch from accelerated to straight-line depreciation or to
change from LIFO to FIFO.
How to make changes to the financial results of the company appeared easier than he
first thought. Now back to the other potential problem of “getting away with it.” At first
thought, Dan considered the degree of resistance by the other members of top management.
Mike Harrington, Dan’s chief financial officer, would have to review any accounting
changes that he suggested. Since Dan had brought Mike up the organization with him, Dan
didn’t foresee any strong resistance from Mike. As for the others, Dan believed he had two
things going for him. One was their ambition. Dan knew that they all coveted his job, and a
clear successor to Dan had yet to be chosen. Dan would only make a recommendation to the
promotion committee of the Board of Directors, but everyone knew his recommendation
carried a great deal of weight. Therefore, resistance to any accounting changes by any indi-
vidual would surely end his or her hope to succeed him as CEO. Secondly, although not as
lucrative as Dan’s, their bonus package is tied to the exact same accounting numbers. So any
actions taken by Dan to increase his compensation will also increase theirs.
Dan was actually beginning to enjoy this situation, even considering it one of his final
challenges. Dan realized that any changes he implemented would have the tendency to
reverse themselves over time. That would undoubtedly hurt the company’s performance
down the road, but all of his potential successors were in their mid-to-late 50s, so there
would be plenty of time for them to turn things around in the years ahead. Besides, any
near-term reversals would merely enhance his reputation as an excellent corporate leader, as
problems would arise after his departure.
At that moment, his secretary called to inform him that Mike Harrington wanted to see
him. Mike was just the man Dan wanted to see.
What are the ethical issues?
What should Mike do?

CASE 2-2 THE DANGEROUS MORALITY OF MANAGING EARNINGS*
The Majority of Managers Surveyed Say It’s Not Wrong to Manage Earnings
Occasionally, the morals and ethics executives use to manage their businesses are examined
and discussed. Unfortunately, the morals that guide the timing of nonoperating events and
choices of accounting policies have largely been ignored.
The ethical framework used by managers in reporting short-term earnings probably has
received less attention than its operating counterpart because accountants prepare financial
disclosures consistent with laws and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Those
disclosures are reviewed by objective auditors.
Managers determine the short-term reported earnings of their companies by:
• Managing, providing leadership, and directing the use of resources in operations.
• Selecting the timing of some nonoperating events, such as the sale of excess assets or the
placement of gains or losses into a particular reporting period.
• Choosing the accounting methods that are used to measure short-term earnings.
Casual observers of the financial reporting process may assume that time, laws, regula-
tion, and professional standards have restricted accounting practices to those that are moral,
ethical, fair, and precise. But most managers and their accountants know otherwise—that
managing short-term earnings can be part of a manager’s job.
To understand the morals of short-term earnings management, we surveyed general
managers and finance, control, and audit managers. The results are frightening.
We found striking disagreements among managers in all groups. Furthermore, the lib-
eral definitions revealed in many responses of what is moral or ethical should raise profound
questions about the quality of financial information that is used for decision-making pur-
poses by parties both inside and outside a company. It seems many managers are convinced
that if a practice is not explicitly prohibited or is only a slight deviation from rules, it is an
ethical practice regardless of who might be affected either by the practice or the information
that flows from it. This means that anyone who uses information on short-term earnings is
vulnerable to misinterpretation, manipulation, or deliberate deception.
The Morals of Managing Earnings
To find a “revealed” consensus concerning the morality of engaging in earnings-management
activities, we prepared a questionnaire describing 13 earnings-management situations we
had observed either directly or indirectly. The actions described in the incidents were all
legal (although some were in violation of GAAP), but each could be construed as involv-
ing short-term earnings management.
A total of 649 managers completed our questionnaire. Table 2-1 classifies respondents by
job function, and Table 2-2 summarizes the views on the acceptability of various earnings-
management practices.
A major finding of the survey was a striking lack of agreement. None of the respondent
groups viewed any of the 13 practices unanimously as an ethical or unethical practice. The

dispersion of judgments about many of the incidents was great. For example, here is one
hypothetical earnings-management practice described in the questionnaire:
In September, a general manager realized that his division would need a strong
performance in the last quarter of the year in order to reach its budget targets. He
decided to implement a sales program offering liberal payment terms to pull some
sales that would normally occur next year into the current year. Customers accepting
delivery in the fourth quarter would not have to pay the invoice for 120 days.
The survey respondents’ judgments of the acceptability of this practice were distributed
as follows:
Ethical
279
Questionable
288
Unethical
82
Total
649
Perhaps you are not surprised by these data. The ethical basis of an early shipment/
liberal payment program may not be something you have considered, but, with the preva-
lence of such diverse views, how can any user of a short-term earnings report know the qual-
ity of the information?
Although the judgments about all earnings-management practices varied considerably,
there are some other generalizations that can be made from the findings summarized in
Table 2-2.
• On average, the respondents viewed management of short-term earnings by accounting
methods as significantly less acceptable than accomplishing the same ends by changing
or manipulating operating decisions or procedures.
• The direction of the effect on earnings matters. Increasing earnings is judged less accept-
able than reducing earnings.
• Materiality matters. Short-term earnings management is judged less acceptable if the
earnings effect is large rather than small.
• The time period of the effect may affect ethical judgments. Managing short-term
earnings at the end of an interim quarterly reporting period is viewed as somewhat
more acceptable than engaging in the same activity at the end of an annual reporting
period.
• The method of managing earnings has an effect. Increasing profits by offering extended
credit terms is seen as less acceptable than accomplishing the same end by selling excess
assets or using overtime to increase shipments.
Managers Interviewed
Were the survey results simply hypothetical, or did managers recognize they can manage
earnings and choose to do so? To find the answers, we talked to a large number of the
respondents. What they told us was rarely reassuring.
On accounting manipulations, a profit center controller reported:
Accounting is grey. Very little is absolute.… You can save your company by doing things
with sales and expenses, and, if it’s legal, then you are justified in doing it.

(continued)
A divisional general manager spoke to us about squeezing reserves to generate addi-
tional reported profit:
If we get a call asking for additional profit, and that’s not inconceivable, I would look at
our reserves. Our reserves tend to be realistic, but we may have a product claim that
could range from $50,000 to $500,000. Who knows what the right amount for
something like that is? We would review our reserves, and if we felt some were on the
high side, we would not be uncomfortable reducing them.
We also heard about operating manipulations. One corporate group controller noted:
[To boost sales] we have paid overtime and shipped on Saturday, the last day of the
fiscal quarter. If we totally left responsibility for the shipping function to the divisions,
it could even slip over to 12:30 A.M. Sunday. There are people who would do that and
not know it’s wrong.
Managers often recognize that such actions “move” earnings from one period to
another. For example, a division controller told us:
Last year we called our customers and asked if they would take early delivery. We
generated an extra $300,000 in sales at the last minute. We were scratching for everything.
We made our plans, but we cleaned out our backlog and started in the hole this year. We
missed our first quarter sales plan. We will catch up by the end of the second quarter.
And a group vice president said:
I recently was involved in a situation where the manager wanted to delay the
production costs for the advertising that would appear in the fall [so that he could
meet his quarterly budget].
Thus, in practice, it appears that a large majority of managers use at least some methods
to manage short-term earnings. Though legal, these methods do not seem to be consistent
with a strict ethical framework. While the managers’ actions have the desired effect on
reported earnings, the managers know there are no real positive economic benefits, and the

actions might actually be quite costly in the long run. These actions are at best questionable
because they involve deceptions that are not disclosed. Most managers who manage earn-
ings, however, do not believe they are doing anything wrong.
We see two major problems. The most important is the generally high tolerance for
operating manipulations. The other is the dispersion in managers’ views about which prac-
tices are moral and ethical.
The Dangerous Allure
The essence of a moral or an ethical approach to management is achieving a balance
between individual interests and obligations to those who have a stake in what happens in
the corporation (or what happens to a division or group within the corporation). These
stakeholders include not only people who work in the firm, but customers, suppliers, cred-
itors, shareholders, and investors as well.
Managers who take unproductive actions to boost short-term earnings may be acting
totally within the laws and rules. Also, they may be acting in the best interest of the corpora-
tion. But if they fail to consider the adverse effects of their actions on other stakeholders, we
may conclude that they are acting unethically.
The managers we interviewed explained that they rated accounting manipulations
harshly because in such cases the “truth” has somehow been denied or misstated. The recipi-
ents of the earnings reports do not know what earnings would have been if no manipulation
had taken place. Even if the accounting methods used are consistent with GAAP, they rea-
son, the actions are not ethical because the interests of major stakeholder groups—including
the recipients of the earnings reports—have been ignored.
The managers judge the operating manipulations more favorably because the earnings
numbers are indicative of what actually took place. The operating manipulations have
changed reality, and “truth” is fairly reported.
We see flaws in that reasoning. One is that the truth has not necessarily been disclosed
completely. When sales and profits are borrowed from the future, for example, it is a rare
company that discloses the borrowed nature of some of the profits reported.
A second flaw in the reasoning about the acceptability of operating manipulations is that
it ignores a few or all of the effects of some types of operating manipulations on the full
range of stakeholders. Many managers consider operating manipulations as a kind of
“victimless crime.”
But victims do exist. Consider, for example, the relatively common operating manipula-
tion of early shipments. As one manager told us:
Would I ship extra product if I was faced with a sales shortfall? You have to be careful
there; you’re playing with fire. I would let whatever happened fall to the bottom line.
I’ve been in companies that did whatever they could to make the sales number, such as
shipping lower quality product. That’s way too short term. You have to draw the line
there. You must maintain the level of quality and customer service. You’ll end up paying
for bad shipments eventually. You’ll have returns, repairs, adjustments, ill will that will
cause you to lose the account.… [In addition] it’s tough to go to your employees one
day and say ship everything you can and then turn around the next day and say that
the quality standards must be maintained.
Another reported:
We’ve had to go to [one of our biggest customers] and say we need an order. That kills
us in the negotiations. Our last sale was at a price just over our cost of materials.
These comments point out that customers—and sometimes even the corporation—may
be victims.
Without a full analysis of the costs of operating manipulations, the dangers of such
manipulations to the corporation are easily underestimated. Mistakes will be made because
the quality of information is misjudged. The short term will be emphasized at the expense of
the long term. If managers consistently manage short-term earnings, the messages sent to
other employees create a corporate culture that lacks mutual trust, integrity, and loyalty.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

A Lack of Moral Agreement
We also are troubled by the managers’ inability to agree on the types of earnings-management
activities that are acceptable. This lack of agreement exists even within corporations.
What this suggests is that many managers are doing their analyses in different ways. The
danger is obfuscation of the reality behind the financial reports. Because managers are using
different standards, individuals who try to use the information reported may be unable to
assess accurately the quality of that information.
If differences in opinions exist, it is likely that financial reporting practices will sink to
their lowest and most manipulative level. As a result, managers with strict definitions of
what is moral and ethical will find it difficult to compete with managers who are not playing
by the same rules. Ethical managers either will loosen their moral standards or fail to be pro-
moted into positions of greater power.
Actions for Concerned Managers
We believe most corporations would benefit if they established clearer accounting and oper-
ating standards for all employees to follow. The standard-setting process should involve
managers in discussions of the practices related to short-term earnings measurements.
Until these standards are in place, different managers will use widely varying criteria in
assessing the acceptability of various earnings-management practices. These variations will
have an adverse effect on the quality of the firm’s financial information. Companies can use
a questionnaire similar to the one in our study to encourage discussion and to communicate
corporate standards and the reason for them.
Standards also enable internal and external auditors and management to judge whether
the desired quality of earnings is being maintained. In most companies, auditors can depend
on good standards to identify and judge the acceptability of the operating manipulations.
Ultimately, the line management chain-of-command, not auditors or financial staff,
bears the primary responsibility for controlling operating manipulations. Often managers
must rely on their prior experience and good judgment to distinguish between a decision that
will have positive long-term benefits and one that has a positive short-term effect but a dele-
terious long-term effect.
Finally, it is important to manage the corporate culture. A culture that promotes open-
ness and cooperative problem solving among managers is likely to result in less short-term
earnings management than one that is more competitive and where annual, and even quar-
terly, performance shortfalls are punished. A corporate culture that is more concerned with
managing for excellence rather than for reporting short-term profits will be less likely to sup-
port the widespread use of immoral earnings-management practices.

CASE 2-3 FIRM COMMITMENT?
In the early 1980s, airlines introduced frequent-flier awards to develop passenger loyalty to
a single airline. Free tickets and possibly other awards were made available to passengers
when they accumulated a certain number of miles or flights on a particular air carrier. These
programs were potentially good for the passenger and the airline as long as the awards were

not too generous and the airlines could minimize revenue displacement from a paying
passenger.
Originally, there were no restrictions. Anyone with the necessary miles could take any
flight that had an available seat. In the late 1980s, most airlines changed their no-restriction
programs to programs with restrictions and blackout days. The airlines also added partners
in frequent-flier programs, such as car rental companies and hotels. These partners handed
out frequent-flier miles compensating the airlines in some manner for the miles distributed.
Airlines also added triple-mileage deals.
A consequence of these expanding frequent-flier programs was a surge in the number of
passengers flying free and a surge in unused miles. To get a handle on the cost and the
unused miles, airlines increased the frequent-flier miles needed for a flight and placed time
limits on the award miles.
The increased frequent-flier miles needed for a flight and the time limits prompted law-
suits. Many of these lawsuits were filed in state courts. One of the suits filed in the District
Court in Chicago in 1989 made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1995, the Supreme
Court ruled that federal airline deregulation law would not bar the breach-of-contract claim
in the state court. In June of 1995, a District Court in Dallas ruled in favor of the airline in a
case involving an increase in miles needed to earn a trip. Airlines interpret this decision as
upholding their right to make changes to their frequent-flier programs.
Required
a. In your opinion, are the outstanding (unused) miles a liability to the airline?
(Substantiate your answer.)
b. Comment on the potential problems involved in estimating the dollar amount of any
potential liability.

CASE 2-4 MULTIPLE COUNTRY ENFORCEMENT*
SEC Charges Royal Ahold and Three Former Top Executives with Fraud; Former Audit Com-
mittee Member Charged with Causing Violations of the Securities Laws for Immediate Release
2004-144
Washington, D.C., Oct. 13, 2004—The Securities and Exchange Commission today
announced the filing of enforcement actions alleging fraud and other violations against
Royal Ahold (Koninklijke Ahold N.V.) (Ahold) and three former top executives: Cees van
der Hoeven, former CEO and chairman of executive board; A. Michiel Meurs, former CFO
and executive board member; and Jan Andreae, former executive vice president and execu-
tive board member. The Commission also charged Roland Fahlin, former member of
Ahold’s supervisory board and audit committee, with causing violations of the reporting,
books and records, and internal controls provisions of the securities laws.
The SEC’s complaints, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colum-
bia, allege that, as a result of the fraudulent inflation of promotional allowances at U.S.
Foodservice, Ahold’s wholly-owned subsidiary, the improper consolidation of joint ventures
through fraudulent side letters, and other accounting errors and irregularities, Ahold’s origi-
nal SEC filings for at least fiscal years 2000 through 2002 were materially false and mislead-
ing. For fiscal years 2000 through 2002, Ahold overstated net sales by approximately EUR
33 billion ($30 billion). For fiscal years 2000 and 2001 and the first three quarters of 2002,
Ahold overstated operating income by approximately EUR 3.6 billion ($3.3 billion) and net
income by approximately EUR 900 million ($829 million).
The Commission has not sought penalties in the enforcement actions against the individ-
uals because the Dutch Public Prosecutor’s Office, which is conducting a parallel criminal

CASE 2-5 MATERIALITY: IN PRACTICE
Professional standards require auditors to make a preliminary judgment about materiality
levels during the planning of an audit. Statement of Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 47 states
that “the auditor plans the audit to obtain reasonable assurance of detecting misstatements
that he/she believes could be large enough, individually or in the aggregate, to be quantita-
tively material to the financial statements.”*
SAS No. 47 indicates that materiality judgments involve both quantitative and qualita-
tive considerations. This statement recognizes that it ordinarily is not practical to design pro-
cedures to detect misstatements that could be qualitatively material.
A number of rule-of-thumb materiality calculations have emerged, such as percentages
of income, total assets, revenues, and equity. These rule-of-thumb calculations result in dif-
fering amounts for audit planning purposes. In fact, sizeable differences can result, depend-
ing on the rule of thumb and the industry.
Required
a. It would seem prudent for auditors to give careful consideration to planning materiality
decisions. Comment.
b. It is difficult to design procedures to detect misstatements that could be qualitatively
material. Comment.
c. It is difficult to design procedures to detect misstatements that could be quantitatively
material. Comment.
d. In your opinion, would the application of materiality be a frequent issue in court cases
involving financial statements? Comment.
e. Comment on materiality implications of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as it relates to control
weaknesses.

Management has established and maintains a system of internal accounting and other
controls for the Company and its subsidiaries. This system and its established accounting
procedures and related controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are
safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect all transactions, that policies and
procedures are implemented by qualified personnel, and that published financial statements
are properly prepared and fairly presented. The Company’s system of internal control is sup-
ported by widely communicated written policies, including business conduct policies, which
are designed to require all employees to maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of
Company affairs. Internal auditors continually review the accounting and control system.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal
control over financial reporting. Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Commit-
tee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Inte-
grated Framework. Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December
31, 2010, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over fi-
nancial reporting as of December 31, 2010 excluded Cogent Inc., Arizant Inc. and Attenti
Holdings S.A., which were all acquired by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2010 in
purchase business combinations. Total assets and total net sales recorded by the Company
related to these acquisitions, in the aggregate, represented less than 10 percent of consoli-
dated total assets and less than 1 percent of consolidated net sales of the Company, respec-
tively, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010. Companies are allowed to exclude
acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first
year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company under guidelines established
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.

Required
a. Who has the responsibility for the financial statements?
b. What is the role of the accountant (auditor) as to the financial statements?
c. Accountants (auditors) are often included as defendants in lawsuits that relate to the
financial statements. Speculate as to why this is the case.
d. Why did 3M include the report “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting”?
CASE 2-7 SAFE HARBOR
In 1995, Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (the “Act”). The principal
provisions of the Act are intended to curb abusive litigation and improve the quality of informa-
tion available to investors through the creation of a safe harbor for forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements were defined to include statements relating to projections of
revenues and other financial items, plans and objectives, future economic performance,
assumptions, reports issued by outside reviewers, or other projections or estimates specified
by rule of the SEC. The safe harbor applies to both oral and written statements.
Management frequently uses signals such as “we estimate,” “we project,” and the like,
where forward-looking statements are not otherwise identified as such. The forward-looking

statements must be accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements. The cautionary state-
ment may be contained in a separate risk section elsewhere in the disclosure document.
Southwest Airlines Co.* included this statement with its 2010 form 10-K:
Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Information
Some statements in this Form 10-K (or otherwise made by the Company or on the Com-
pany’s behalf from time to time in other reports, filings with the SEC, news releases, confer-
ences, Internet postings, or otherwise) that are not historical facts may be “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on, and include state-
ments about, the Company’s estimates, expectations, beliefs, intentions, or strategies for the
future, and the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements. Specific forward-
looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or
current facts and include, without limitation, words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “esti-
mates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “will,” “should,” and similar expressions. While
management believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made,
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and
uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially from
what is expressed in or indicated by the Company’s forward-looking statements or from his-
torical experience or the Company’s present expectations. Factors that could cause these dif-
ferences include, but are not limited to, those set forth below under “Risk Factors.”
Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the Company’s forward-looking
statements, which represent the Company’s views only as of the date this report is filed. The
Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking state-
ment, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Required
a. Demand for financial reports exists because users believe that the reports help them in
decision making. In your opinion, will forward-looking statements as provided by the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act aid users of financial reports in decision making?
b. To some extent, investors’ rights are limited by the curb of abusive litigation. In your opinion,
is there a net benefit to investors from a safe harbor for forward-looking statements?

CASE 2-8 ENFORCEMENT
This case includes a news release issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board. This news release comments on the first disciplines of an accounting firm and audi-
tors under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Board Revokes Firm’s Registration, Disciplines Three Accountants for
Failure to Cooperate
Washington, DC, May 24, 2005—The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board today
revoked the registration of a public accounting firm and barred the firm’s managing partner
from association with a registered accounting firm after finding that they concealed informa-
tion from the Board and submitted false information in connection with a PCAOB inspection.
The Board also censured two former partners in the firm, finding that they participated
in the misconduct but noting that they promptly alerted the PCAOB and cooperated in the
Board’s investigation.
“Registered accounting firms and their associated persons have a duty to cooperate in
PCAOB inspections,” said Claudius Modesti, director of the PCAOB’s Division of

Enforcement and Investigations. “The findings in this case demonstrate that the Board will
not tolerate conduct aimed at thwarting the Board’s inspections.”
The accounting firm, Goldstein and Morris CPAs, P.C., based in New York City, was noti-
fied in September 2004 that the firm would be inspected by the PCAOB in November 2004.
The PCAOB’s Division of Registration and Inspections directed a request for information and
documents to the firm’s managing partner, Edward B. Morris. The Board found that, in respond-
ing to the request, Mr. Morris and two partners, Alan J. Goldberger and William A. Postelnik,
were aware that the firm had prepared the financial statements of two of its public company audit
clients, contrary to auditor independence requirements of federal law. The Board found that
Messrs. Morris, Goldberger, and Postelnik took steps to conceal that fact from the Board by omit-
ting certain requested information from the firm’s written response to the inspection request.
The Board also found that the partners, after learning of the imminent inspection, formu-
lated and carried out a plan to create and back-date certain documents and place them in the
firm’s audit files. The Board found that Messrs. Morris, Goldberger, and Postelnik took these
steps to conceal from the Board the firm’s failure to comply with certain auditing standards.
Messrs. Goldberger and Postelnik notified the PCAOB of the omitted and falsified infor-
mation. Both resigned from the firm.
The accounting firm and Mr. Morris consented to a Board order making the findings
and imposing sanctions, without admitting or denying the findings. The order bars Mr.
Morris from association with a registered accounting firm and revokes the firm’s registra-
tion. Firms that are not registered with the PCAOB are prohibited from auditing the finan-
cial statements of public companies.
Messrs. Goldberger and Postelnik each consented to a Board order making the findings
and imposing the censures without admitting or denying the findings. The Board limited the
sanctions of the two men to censures because they “promptly and voluntarily brought the
matter to the Board’s attention, disclosed their own misconduct and the misconduct of
others, and made affirmative efforts to provide the Board with relevant information.”
The Board’s orders are available under Enforcement at www.pcaobus.org.
Suspected misconduct by auditors can be reported to the PCAOB Center for Enforce-
ment Tips, Complaints and Other Information by e-mail or by phone to 800-741-3158.
Media Inquiries: Public Affairs, 202-207-9227
Required
a. Does it appear that Mr. Morris and the accounting firm can continue to function in
public accounting? Comment.
b. It appears that Mr. Morris, Goldberger, and Postelnik can continue to function as
certified public accountants. Speculate on what may happen to their ability to function
as certified public accountants. (Hint: Certification is granted by individual states.)
CASE 2-9 NOTIFY THE SEC
Summary
“This matter involves Hewlett-Packard’s failure to disclose the circumstances surrounding a
board member’s resignation amidst the company’s controversial investigation into board-
room leaks. On May 18, 2006, HP’s Board of Directors learned the findings of the company’s
leak investigation and voted to request the resignation of a director believed to have violated
HP’s policies by providing confidential information to the press. Silicon Valley venture capi-
talist and fellow director Thomas Perkins (not the source of the leak) voiced his strong objec-
tions to the handling of the matter, announced his resignation, and walked out of the Board
meeting. Contrary to the reporting requirements of the federal securities laws, HP failed to
disclose to investors the circumstances of Mr. Perkins’ disagreement with the company.”*

Chapter

Balance Sheet
T
he principal financial statements are the balance sheet, income statement, and state-
ment of cash flows. This chapter will review the balance sheet in detail. Other titles
used for the balance sheet are statement of financial position and statement of finan-
cial condition. The title balance sheet is the predominant title used.1
Another statement, called the statement of stockholders’ equity, reconciles the changes
in stockholders’ equity, a section of the balance sheet. This statement will also be reviewed
in this chapter. Many alternative titles are used for the statement of stockholders’ equity.
The title most frequently used is the statement of stockholders’ equity. Another frequently
used title is the statement of shareholders’ equity.2
Basic Elements of the Balance Sheet
A balance sheet shows the financial condition of an accounting entity as of a particular date.
The balance sheet consists of assets, the resources of the firm; liabilities, the debts of the firm;
and stockholders’ equity, the owners’ interest in the firm.
The assets are derived from two sources, creditors and owners. At any point in time, the
assets must equal the contribution of the creditors and owners. The accounting equation
expresses this relationship:
Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity
On the balance sheet, the assets equal the liabilities plus the stockholders’ equity. This
may be presented side by side (account form) or with the assets at the top and the liabilities
and stockholders’ equity at the bottom (report form). Exhibit 3-1 presents a typical report
form format, and Exhibit 3-2 presents a typical account form format. The report form is
dominant in the United States.3
Balance sheet formats differ across nations. For example, nations influenced by British
financial reporting report the least liquid assets first and cash last. Nations influenced by the
United States report a balance sheet emphasizing liquidity, as illustrated in this chapter.

Assets
Assets are probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by an entity as a result
of past transactions or events.4 Assets may be physical, such as land, buildings, inventory of
supplies, material, or finished products. Assets may also be intangible, such as patents and
trademarks.
Assets are normally divided into two major categories: current and noncurrent (long-
term). Current assets are assets (1) in the form of cash (2) that will normally be realized in
cash or (3) that conserve the use of cash during the operating cycle of a firm or for one year,
whichever is longer. The operating cycle covers the time between the acquisition of inventory
and the realization of cash from selling the inventory. Noncurrent or long-term assets take
longer than a year or an operating cycle to be converted to cash or to conserve cash. Some
industries, such as banking (financial institutions), insurance, and real estate, do not divide
assets (or liabilities) into current and noncurrent. Chapter 12 reviews specialized industries.
When a significant subsidiary is consolidated from an industry that does not use the con-
cept of current and noncurrent, then the consolidated statements will not use the concept of
current and noncurrent. These companies often present supplementary statements, handling
the subsidiary as an investment (nonconsolidated).
For example, General Electric does not use the concept of current and noncurrent. Gen-
eral Electric Company’s consolidated financial statements represent the combination of man-
ufacturing and nonfinancial services businesses of General Electric Company (GE) and the
accounts of General Electric Capital Services, Inc. (GECS).
Current Assets
Current assets are listed on the balance sheet in order of liquidity (the ability to be converted
to cash). Current assets typically include cash, marketable securities, short-term receivables,
inventories, and prepaids. In some cases, assets other than these may be classified as current.
If so, management is indicating that it expects the asset to be converted into cash during the
operating cycle or within a year, whichever is longer. An example is land held for immediate
disposal. Exhibit 3-3 includes the items that the 2006 edition of Accounting Trends & Tech-
niques reported as being disclosed as other current assets. The definition of current assets
excludes restricted cash, investments for purposes of control, long-term receivables, the cash
surrender value of life insurance, land and other natural resources, depreciable assets, and
long-term prepayments.
Cash
Cash, the most liquid asset, includes negotiable checks and unrestricted balances in checking
accounts, as well as cash on hand. Savings accounts are classified as cash even though the
bank may not release the money for a specific period of time. Exhibit 3-4 illustrates the pre-
sentation of cash.

Marketable Securities
Marketable securities (also labeled short-term investments) are characterized by their mar-
ketability at a readily determinable market price. A firm holds marketable securities to earn
a return on near-cash resources. Management must intend to convert these assets to cash
during the current period for them to be classified as marketable securities.
The carrying basis of debt and equity marketable securities is fair value. Refer to Exhibit
3-4 for a presentation of marketable securities.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are monies due on accounts that arise from sales or services rendered to
customers. Accounts receivable are shown net of allowances to reflect their realizable value.
This amount is expected to be collected. The most typical allowances are for bad debts
(uncollectible accounts). Other allowances may account for expected sales discounts, which
are given for prompt payment or for sales returns. These types of allowances recognize
expenses in the period of sale, at which time the allowance is established. In future periods,
when the losses occur, they are charged to the allowance. All of the allowances are presented
in one allowance account. Exhibit 3-4 presents the accounts receivable of SeaChange Inter-
national, Inc. (less allowances). At January 31, 2011, the firm expects to realize
$48,843,000. The gross receivables can be reconciled as follows:
Receivables, net
$48,843,000
Plus: Allowances
995,000
Receivables, gross
$49,838,000
Other receivables may also be included in current assets. These receivables may result
from tax refund claims, investees/affiliates, contracts, finance, retained interest in sold receiv-
ables, insurance claims, vendors/suppliers, asset disposals, and employees.
Receivables other than trade receivables include tax refund claims, affiliates, contracts,
finance, and insurance claims.5
Inventories
Inventories are the balance of goods on hand. In a manufacturing firm, they include raw
materials, work in process, and finished goods. In a retail firm the inventory is merchandise
inventory. Inventories will be carried at cost, expressed in terms of lower-of-cost-or-market.

Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value (market). Cost includes all costs
incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, as follows:
• Raw materials and purchased finished goods for resale – principally valued at cost determined
on a weighted average basis.
• In-process products and finished goods – cost of direct materials and labor plus attributable
overhead based on a normal level of activity.
The Company applies net realizable value and obsolescence to the gross value of the inventory. The
Company estimates net realizable value based on estimated selling price less further costs to comple-
tion and disposal. The Company provides for slow-moving products by comparing inventories on
hand to future projected demand. Obsolete inventory is on-hand supply of a product in excess of
two years’ sales of that product or a supply of that product that the Company believes is no longer
marketable. The Company revalues obsolete inventory as having no net realizable value and writes
off its full carrying value. The Company has consistently applied this methodology. The Company
believes that this approach is prudent and makes suitable provisions for slow-moving and obsolete
inventory. When provisions are established, a new cost basis of the inventory is created.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Work in Process Work in process represents goods started but not ready for sale. Work in
process includes the cost of materials, labor costs for workers directly involved in the manu-
facture, and factory overhead. Factory overhead includes such cost items as rent, indirect
wages, and maintenance.
Finished Goods Finished goods are inventory ready for sale. These inventory costs also
include the cost of materials, labor costs for workers directly involved in the manufacture,
and a portion of factory overhead.
Since retailing and wholesaling firms do not engage in the manufacture of a product but
only in the sale, their only inventory item is merchandise. These firms do not have raw mate-
rials, work in process, inventory, or finished goods.
Supplies In addition to goods on hand, the firm may have supplies. Supplies could include
register tapes, pencils, or sewing machine needles for the shirt factory. Details relating to in-
ventory are usually disclosed in a note.
Prepaids
A prepaid is an expenditure made in advance of the use of the service or goods. It represents
future benefits that have resulted from past transactions. For example, if insurance is paid in
advance for three years, at the end of the first year, two years’ worth of the outlay will be
prepaid. The entity retains the right to be covered by insurance for two more years.
Typical prepaids include advertising, taxes, insurance, promotion costs, and early
payments on long-term contracts. Prepaids are often not disclosed separately. In both
Exhibit 3-1 and Exhibit 3-2, the prepaid account is not disclosed separately.
Long-Term Assets
Long-term assets are usually divided into four categories: tangible assets, investments, intan-
gible assets, and other.
Tangible Assets
These are the physical facilities used in the operations of the business. The tangible assets of
land, buildings, machinery, and construction in progress will now be reviewed. Accumulated
depreciation related to buildings and machinery will also be reviewed.
Land Land is shown at acquisition cost and is not depreciated because land does not get
used up. Land containing resources that will be used up, however, such as mineral deposits
and timberlands, is subject to depletion. Depletion expense attempts to measure the wearing
away of these resources. It is similar to depreciation except that depreciation deals with a
tangible fixed asset and depletion deals with a natural resource.
Buildings Structures are presented at cost plus the cost of permanent improvements. Build-
ings are depreciated (expensed) over their estimated useful life.
Machinery Machinery is listed at historical cost, including delivery and installation, plus
any material improvements that extend its life or increase the quantity or quality of service.
Machinery is depreciated over its estimated useful life.
Construction in Progress Construction in progress represents cost incurred for projects
under construction. These costs will be transferred to the proper tangible asset account upon
completion of construction. The firm cannot use these assets while they are under construc-
tion. Some analysis is directed at how efficiently the company is using operating assets. This
analysis can be distorted by construction in progress, since construction in progress is classi-
fied as part of tangible assets. To avoid this distortion, construction in progress should be
classified under long-term assets, other.
Accumulated Depreciation Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of buildings
and machinery over the periods benefited. The depreciation expense taken each period is
accumulated in a separate account (Accumulated Depreciation). Accumulated depreciation is

subtracted from the cost of plant and equipment. The net amount is the book value of the
asset. It does not represent the current market value of the asset.
There are a number of depreciation methods that a firm can use. Often, a firm depreci-
ates an asset under one method for financial statements and another for income tax returns.
A firm often wants to depreciate slowly for the financial statements because this results in
the highest immediate income and highest asset balance. The same firm would want to de-
preciate faster for income tax returns because this results in the lowest immediate income
and thus lower income taxes. Over the life of an asset, the total depreciation will be the same
regardless of the depreciation method selected.
Three factors are usually considered when computing depreciation: (1) the asset cost,
(2) length of the life of the asset, and (3) its salvage value when retired from service. The
length of the asset’s life and the salvage value must be estimated at the time that the asset is
placed in service. These estimates may be later changed if warranted.
Exhibit 3-6 indicates the depreciation methods used for financial reporting purposes by
the firms surveyed for the 2010 edition of Accounting Trends & Techniques. The most pop-
ular method was straight-line. Many firms use more than one depreciation method.
The following assumptions will be made to illustrate some depreciation methods:
1. Cost of asset—$10,000
2. Estimated life of asset—5 years
3. Estimated salvage (or residual) value—$2,000
4. Estimated total hours of use—16,000
Straight-Line Method The straight-line method recognizes depreciation in equal amounts
over the estimated life of the asset. Compute depreciation using the straight-line method as
follows:
Cost ! Salvage Value
Estimated Life
¼ Annual Depreciation
For the asset used for illustration, the annual depreciation would be computed as
follows:
$10,000 ! $2,000
5 years
¼ $1,600
The $1,600 depreciation amount would be recognized each year of the five-year life of
the asset. Do not depreciate the salvage value.

Declining-Balance Method The declining-balance method, an accelerated method, applies a
multiple times the straight-line rate to the declining book value (cost minus accumulated
depreciation) to achieve a declining depreciation charge over the estimated life of the asset.
This book will use double the straight-line rate, which is the maximum rate that can be used.
Compute depreciation using the declining-balance method as follows:
1
Estimated Life of Asset
× 2 × Book Amount at Beginning of the Year ¼ Annual Depreciation
For the asset used for illustration, the first year’s depreciation would be computed as
follows:
1
5
× 2 × ð$10,000 ! 0Þ ¼ $4,000
The declining-balance method results in the following depreciation amounts for each of
the five years of the asset’s life:

Estimated salvage value is not considered in the formula, but the asset should not be
depreciated below the estimated salvage value. For the sample asset, the formula produced a
depreciation amount of $864 in the fourth year. Only $160 depreciation can be used in the
fourth year because the $160 amount brings the book amount of the asset down to the sal-
vage value. Once the book amount is equal to the salvage value, no additional depreciation
may be taken.
Sum-of-the-Years’-Digits Method The sum-of-the-years’-digits method is an accelerated
depreciation method. Thus, the depreciation expense declines steadily over the estimated life
of the asset. This method takes a fraction each year times the cost less salvage value. The nu-
merator of the fraction changes each year. It is the remaining number of years of the asset’s
life. The denominator of the fraction remains constant; it is the sum of the digits representing
the years of the asset’s life. Compute depreciation using the sum-of-the-years’-digits method
as follows:
Remaining Number of Years of Life
Sum of the Digits Representing the Years of Life
× ðCost !SalvageÞ ¼ Annual Depreciation
For the asset used for illustration, the first year’s depreciation would be computed as
follows:
5
ð5 þ 4 þ 3 þ 2 þ 1Þ or 15
× ð$10,000 ! $2,000Þ ¼ $2,666:67
The sum-of-the-years’-digits method results in the following depreciation amounts for
each year of the five years of the asset’s life:

Unit-of-Production Method The unit-of-production method relates depreciation to the out-
put capacity of the asset, estimated for the life of the asset. The capacity is stated in terms
most appropriate for the asset, such as units of production, hours of use, or miles. Hours of
use will be used for the asset in our example. For the life of the asset, it is estimated that there
will be 16,000 hours of use. The estimated output capacity is divided into the cost of the
asset less the salvage value to determine the depreciation per unit of output. For the example
asset, the depreciation per hour of use would be $0.50 [(cost of asset, $10,000 −salvage,
$2,000) divided by 16,000 hours].
The depreciation for each year is then determined by multiplying the depreciation per
unit of output by the output for that year. Assuming that the output was 2,000 hours during
the first year, the depreciation for that year would be $1,000 ($0.50 × 2,000). Further
depreciation cannot be taken when the accumulated depreciation equals the cost of the asset
less the salvage value. For the example asset, this will be when accumulated depreciation
equals $8,000.
In Exhibit 3-7, Kelly Services, Inc., presents these assets as property, plant, and equip-
ment at cost. Added detailed information is disclosed in the notes.
Leases
Leases are classified as operating leases or capital leases. If the lease is in substance an own-
ership arrangement, it is a capital lease; otherwise, the lease is an operating lease. Assets
leased under a capital lease are classified as long-term assets. They are shown net of amorti-
zation (depreciation) and listed with plant, property, and equipment. (The discounted value
of the obligation, a liability, will be part current and part long term.) Chapter 7 covers the
topic of leases in more length.
Investments
Long-term investments, usually stocks and bonds of other companies, are often held to
maintain a business relationship or to exercise control. Long-term investments are different
from marketable securities, where the intent is to hold for short-term profits and to achieve
liquidity. (Financial reports often refer to marketable securities as investments.)
Debt securities under investments are to be classified as held-to-maturity securities or
available-for-sale securities. Held-to-maturity securities are securities that the firm has the
intent and ability to hold to maturity. Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity securities
are carried at amortized cost. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale securities are car-
ried at fair value.
Equity securities under investments are to be carried at fair value. An exception for fair
value is used for common stock where there is significant influence. For these common stock
investments, the investment is carried under the equity method. Under the equity method,
the cost is adjusted for the proportionate share of the rise (fall) in retained profits of the sub-
sidiary (investee). For example, a parent company owns 40% of a subsidiary company, pur-
chased at a cost of $400,000. When the subsidiary company earns $100,000, the parent
company increases the investment account by 40% of $100,000, or $40,000. When the sub-
sidiary company declares dividends of $20,000, the parent company decreases the invest-
ment account by 40% of $20,000, or $8,000. This decrease occurs because the investment
account changes in direct proportion to the retained earnings of the subsidiary.
The FASB has given guidance on the use of fair value. Fair value is the price that a com-
pany would receive to sell an asset (or transfer a liability) in an orderly transaction between
market participants on the date of measurement. With fair value, the firm selects the highest
appropriate level for valuation. The levels of input for valuation are as follows:
1. Level 1: Quoted price for identical asset (or liability) in active market.
2. Level 2: Adjusted quoted price for similar asset (or liability). Level 2 inputs are to be
used when level 1 inputs are not readily available.
3. Level 3: Unobservable inputs (e.g., present value of expected cash flows). The present
value of an asset is the net amount of discounted future cash inflows less the discounted
future cash outflows relating to the asset.

A company must segregate its fair value measurements into those based on level 1, 2,

the fair value, a reconciliation of the changes in fair value during the period, and a related
discussion. The investments of Gentex Corporation are illustrated in Exhibit 3-8.
Intangibles
Intangibles are nonphysical assets, such as patents and copyrights. Intangibles are recorded
at historical cost. An intangible asset that has a finite life is amortized over its useful life. An
intangible asset with an indefinite life are reviewed for impairment. Research and

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (In Part)
(1) Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies (In Part)
Investments
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued authoritative guidance at ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements.”
This statement establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities. This framework is intended to pro-
vide increased consistency in how fair value determinations are made under various existing accounting standards that permit,
or in come cases, require estimates of fair-market value. This standard also expands financial statement disclosure require-
ments about a company’s use of fair value measurements, including the effect of such measure on earnings.
The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 820 related to its financial assets and liabilities in 2008, and to its non-
financial assets and liabilities in 2009, neither of which had a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. The Company’s investment securities are classified as available for sale and are stated at fair
value based on quoted market prices. Adjustments to the fair value of investments are recorded as increases or decreases, net of
income taxes, within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ investment (excluding other-than-tempo-
rary impairments). Assets or liabilities that have recurring measurements are shown below as of December 31, 2010.

The Company determines the fair value of its U.S. Treasury Notes by utilizing monthly valuation statements that are provided by
its broker. The broker bases the investment valuation by using the bid price in the market. The Company also refers to third
party sources to validate valuations. In addition, the Company determines the fair value of its limited partnership equity invest-
ments by utilizing monthly valuation statements that are provided by the limited partnership. The limited partnership bases its eq-
uity investment valuations on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are
readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment.

development costs must be expensed as incurred. Thus, research and development costs in
the United States represent an immediate expense, not an intangible. This requirement is not
common in many other countries. The following are examples of intangibles that are
recorded in the United States.
Goodwill Goodwill arises from the acquisition of a business for a sum greater than the phys-
ical asset value, usually because the business has unusual earning power. It may result from
good customer relations, a well-respected owner, and so on. Purchased goodwill is not amor-
tized but is subject to annual impairment reviews.6
The global treatment of goodwill varies significantly. In some countries, goodwill is not
recorded because it is charged to shareholders’ equity. In this case, there is no influence to
reported income. In other countries, goodwill is expensed in the year acquired. In many
countries, goodwill is recorded and amortized.
Patents Patents, exclusive legal rights granted to an inventor for a period of 20 years, are
valued at their acquisition cost. The cost of a patent should be amortized over its legal life or
its useful life, whichever is shorter.
Trademarks Trademarks are distinctive names or symbols. Rights are granted indefinitely
as long as the owner uses it in connection with the product or service and files the paper-
work. Since a trademark has an indefinite life, it should not be amortized. Trademarks
should be tested for impairment at least annually.
Unrealized losses on investments as of December 31, 2010 (excluding other-than-temporary impairments), are as follows:

ASC 320, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” as amended and interpreted, provides guidance
on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company reviews its fixed income and equity
investment portfolio for any unrealized losses that would be deemed other-than-temporary and require the recognition of an
impairment loss in income. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, the Company evaluates, among other factors,
general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the
investments. Management also considers the type of security, related-industry and sector performance, as well as published
investments ratings and analyst reports, to evaluate its portfolio. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-
temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or
investee conditions deteriorate, the Company may incur future impairments. Management considered equity investment losses
of $17,909,901 to be other-than-temporary at December 31, 2008. The Company considered additional equity investment
losses of $1,290,590 to be other-than-temporary at March 31, 2009. Accordingly, the losses were recognized in the consoli-
dated statement of income in their respective reporting periods. No investments were considered to be other-than-temporary
impaired in 2010.
Fixed income securities as of December 31, 2010, have contractual maturities as follows:
Due within one year

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable and accounts pay-
able. The Company’s estimate of the fair values of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amounts at Decem-
ber 31, 2010 and 2009.

Franchises Franchises are the legal right to operate under a particular corporate name, pro-
viding trade-name products or services. The cost of a franchise with a limited life should be
amortized over the life of the franchise.
Copyrights Copyrights are rights that authors, painters, musicians, sculptors, and other artists
have in their creations and expressions. A copyright is granted for the life of the creator, plus
70 years. The costs of the copyright should be amortized over the period of expected benefit.

GoodwilI and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill reflects the cost of acquisitions in excess of the fair values assigned to identifi-
able net assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units based upon the expected benefit of the synergies of the acquisi-
tion. The reporting units are Engine, Home Power Products and Yard Power Products and have goodwill at June 27, 2010 of
$136.9 million, $83.3 million, and $32.8 million, respectively. Other Intangible Assets reflect identifiable intangible assets that
arose from purchase acquisitions. Other Intangible Assets are comprised of trademarks, patents and customer relationships.

Other Noncurrent Assets
Firms will occasionally have assets that do not fit into one of the previously discussed classi-
fications. These assets, termed “other,” might include noncurrent receivables and noncurrent
prepaids. Exhibit 3-10 summarizes types of other assets from a financial statement compila-
tion in Accounting Trends & Techniques.
Goodwill and trademarks, which are considered to have indefinite lives are not amortized; however, both must be tested for
impairment annually. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis for other intangible assets with finite lives. Patents have
been assigned an estimated weighted average useful life of thirteen years. The customer relationships have been assigned an
estimated useful life of twenty-five years. The Company is subject to financial statement risk in the event that goodwill and in-
tangible assets become impaired. The Company performed the required impairment tests in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, and
found no impairment of the assets.
(5) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:
Goodwill reflects the cost of acquisitions in excess of the fair values assigned to identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is
assigned to reporting units based upon the expected benefit of the synergies of the acquisition. The reporting units are Engine,
Home Power Products and Yard Power Products and have goodwill at June 27, 2010 of $136.9 million, $83.3 million, and
$32.8 million, respectively.

Liabilities
Liabilities are probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from present obligations
of a particular entity to transfer assets or provide services to other entities in the future as a
result of past transactions or events.7 Liabilities are usually classified as either current or
long-term liabilities.
Current Liabilities
Current liabilities are obligations whose liquidation is reasonably expected to require the use
of existing current assets or the creation of other current liabilities within a year or an oper-
ating cycle, whichever is longer. They include the following items.
Payables
These include short-term obligations created by the acquisition of goods and services, such
as accounts payable (for materials or goods bought for use or resale), wages payable, and
taxes payable. Payables may also be in the form of a written promissory note, notes payable.
Unearned Income
Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are termed unearned. They
include rent income and subscription income. Rather than cash, a future service or good is
due the customer.
Other Current Liabilities
Many other current obligations require payment during the year. Exhibit 3-11 displays other
current liabilities reported by Accounting Trends & Techniques in 2010. Exhibit 3-12 shows
the current liabilities of Google, Inc.
Long-Term Liabilities
Long-term liabilities are those due in a period exceeding one year or one operating cycle,
whichever is longer. Long-term liabilities are generally of two types: financing arrangements
of assets and operational obligations.

Notes Payable Promissory notes due in periods greater than one year or one operating cycle,
whichever is longer, are classified as long term. If secured by a claim against real property,
they are called mortgage notes.
Bonds Payable A bond is a debt security normally issued with $1,000 par per bond and nor-
mally requiring semiannual interest payments based on the coupon rate. Bonds payable is simi-
lar to notes payable. Bonds payable are usually for a longer duration than notes payable.
Bonds are not necessarily sold at par. They are sold at a premium if the stated rate of interest
exceeds the market rate, and they are sold at a discount if the stated rate of interest is less than
the market rate. If sold for more than par, a premium on bonds payable arises and increases
bonds payable to obtain the current carrying value. Similarly, if sold at less than par, a discount
on bonds payable arises and decreases bonds payable on the balance sheet. Each of these
accounts, discount or premium, will be gradually written off (amortized) to interest expense over
the life of the bond. At the maturity date, the carrying value of bonds payable will be equal to
the par value. Amortization of bond discount increases interest expense; amortization of bond
premium reduces it. Exhibit 3-13 illustrates bonds sold at par, premium, or discount.
Bonds that are convertible into common stock at the option of the bondholder (creditor)
are exchanged for a specified number of common shares, and the bondholder becomes a
common stockholder. Often, convertible bonds are issued when the common stock price is
low, in management’s opinion, and the firm eventually wants to increase its common equity.
By issuing a convertible bond, the firm may get more for the specified number of common
shares than could be obtained by issuing the common shares. The conversion feature allows
the firm to issue the bond at a more favorable interest rate than would be the case with a
bond lacking the conversion feature. Also, the tax deductible interest paid on the convertible
bond reduces the firm’s cost for these funds. If common stock had been issued, the dividend
on the common stock would not be tax deductible. Thus, a firm may find that issuing a con-
vertible bond can be an attractive means of raising common equity funds in the long run.
However, if the firm’s stock price stays depressed after issuing a convertible bond, then the
firm will have the convertible bond liability until the bond comes due. Convertible bonds of
VeriSign, Inc., and subsidiaries are displayed in Exhibit 3-14.

Credit Agreements Many firms arrange loan commitments from banks or insurance compa-
nies for future loans. Often, the firm does not intend to obtain these loans but has arranged
the credit agreement just in case a need exists for additional funds. Such credit agreements
do not represent a liability unless the firm actually requests the funds. From the point of view
of analysis, the existence of a substantial credit agreement is a positive condition in that it
could relieve pressure on the firm if there is a problem in meeting existing liabilities.
In return for giving a credit agreement, the bank or insurance company obtains a fee. This
commitment fee is usually a percentage of the unused portion of the commitment. Also, banks
often require the firm to keep a specified sum in its bank account, referred to as a compensat-
ing balance. Exhibit 3-15 shows credit agreements for Carlisle Companies Incorporated.
Liabilities Relating to Operational Obligations
Long-term liabilities relating to operational obligations include obligations arising from the
operation of a business, mostly of a service nature, such as pension obligations, postretirement
benefit obligations other than pension plans, deferred taxes, and service warranties. Chapter 7
covers at length pensions and postretirement benefit obligations other than pension plans.
Deferred Taxes Deferred taxes are caused by using different accounting methods for tax and
reporting purposes. For example, a firm may use accelerated depreciation for tax purposes and
straight-line depreciation for reporting purposes. This causes tax expense for reporting purposes
to be higher than taxes payable according to the tax return. The difference is deferred tax. Any
situation where revenue or expense is recognized in the financial statements in a different time pe-
riod than for the tax return will create a deferred tax situation (asset or liability). For example, in
the later years of the life of a fixed asset, straight-line depreciation will give higher depreciation
and, therefore, lower net income than an accelerated method. Then tax expense for reporting
purposes will be lower than taxes payable, and the deferred tax will be reduced (paid). Since firms
often buy more and higher-priced assets, however, the increase in deferred taxes may exceed the
decrease. In this case, a partial or a total reversal will not occur. The taxes may be deferred for a
very long time, perhaps permanently. Chapter 7 covers deferred taxes in more detail.
Warranty Obligations
Warranty obligations are estimated obligations arising out of prod-
uct warranties. Product warranties require the seller to correct any deficiencies in quantity,

Revolving Credit Facilities
At December 31, 2010 the Company had $458.5 million available under its $500.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Facil-
ity”). Of the amount unavailable for borrowings at December 31, 2010, $10.0 million was borrowed and outstanding in con-
nection with the financing of the Hawk acquisition. Under the terms of the Facility, and at the Company’s election, the $10.0
million is payable on January 31, 2011 (30 days from the date of funding) and accordingly has been presented in Short-term
debt, including current maturities in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company has the option to roll over amounts pay-
able, at differing tenors and interest rates, until the facility expires in July of 2012. The remainder of the amount unavailable
for borrowings relates to issued letters of credit amounting to $31.5 million. At December 31, 2009, the Company had $466.0
million available under the Facility, with the reduction in availability attributable to letters of credit of $34.0 million. Letters
of credit are issued primarily to provide security under insurance arrangements and certain borrowings. The revolving credit
facility provides for grid-based interest pricing based on the credit rating of the Company’s senior unsecured bank debt or
other unsecured senior debt and the Company’s utilization of the facility. The average interest rate of the revolving credit facil-
ity for 2010 and 2009 was 0.65% and 0.85%, respectively.
The Company also maintains a $55.0 million uncommitted line of credit all of which was available for borrowing as of De-
cember 31, 2010 and 2009. The average interest rate on the uncommitted line was 1.87% for 2010 and 2.88% for 2009.

Guarantees are recorded at fair value at the inception of the guarantee. Litigation and claims are
accrued when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable.
Estimated warranty costs and additional service actions are accrued for at the time the vehicle
is sold to a dealer, including costs for basic warranty coverage on vehicles sold, product recalls,
and other customer service actions. Fees or premiums for the issuance of extended service plans
are recognized in income over the contract period in proportion to the costs expected to be
incurred in performing services under the contract.
Warranty
Included in warranty cost accruals are the costs for basic warranty coverages on products sold. These
costs are estimates based primarily on historical warranty claim experience. Warranty accruals

Prior to the new standard that took effect for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008, noncontrolling interest was called minority interest and was usually presented after
liabilities and before shareholders’ equity. With the new standard, noncontrolling interest is
presented with shareholders’ equity.
Noncontrolling interest is seldom material. In a firm where noncontrolling interest is
material, the analysis can be performed twice, one with noncontrolling interest as a liability
to be conservative, and then as a shareholders’ equity item. The analysis in this book will
leave the noncontrolling interest as a shareholders’ equity item. Refer to Exhibit 3-17 for an
illustration of noncontrolling interest (minority interest).
Under the new standard, a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of both
the parent and the noncontrolling interest equity amounts must be presented. This includes
net income and owner contributions attributable to each of them. This presentation can be
in a note or in a statement of stockholders’ equity. The statement of stockholders’ equity is
illustrated in Chapter 4.
Other Noncurrent Liabilities
Many other noncurrent liabilities may be disclosed. It would not be practical to discuss all of
the possibilities. An example would be deferred profit on sales.
Redeemable Preferred Stock
Redeemable preferred stock is subject to mandatory redemption requirements or has a
redemption feature outside the control of the issuer. If this feature is coupled with such char-
acteristics as no vote or fixed return, often preferred stock and bond characteristics, then this
type of preferred stock is more like debt than equity. For this reason, the SEC directs that the
three categories of stock—redeemable preferred stock, nonredeemable preferred stock, and
common stock—not be totaled in the balance sheet. Further, the stockholders’ equity section
should not include redeemable preferred stock. Redeemable preferred stock is illustrated in
Exhibit 3-18. Because redeemable preferred stock is more like debt than equity, consider it
as part of total liabilities for purposes of financial statement analysis.
Shareholders’ or Stockholder’s Equity
Shareholders’ (Stockholder’s) equity is the residual ownership interest in the assets of an en-
tity that remains after deducting its liabilities.8 Usually divided into two basic categories,
paid-in capital and retained earnings, other accounts may appear in shareholders’ equity that
are usually presented separately from paid-in capital and retained earnings. Other accounts
include accumulated other comprehensive income, equity-oriented deferred compensation,
and employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs).

Paid-In Capital
The first type of paid-in capital account is capital stock. Two basic types of capital stock are
preferred and common.
Both preferred stock and common stock may be issued as par-value stock. (Some states
call this stated value stock.) The articles of incorporation establish the par value, a desig-
nated dollar amount per share. Many states stipulate that the par value of issued stock times
the number of shares outstanding constitutes the legal capital. Many states also designate
that, if original-issue stock is sold below par value, the buyer is contingently liable for the
difference between the par value and the lower amount paid. This does not usually pose a
problem because the par value has no direct relationship to market value, the selling price of
the stock. To avoid selling a stock below par, the par value is usually set very low in relation
to the intended selling price. For example, the intended selling price may be $25.00, and the
par value may be $1.00.

Note 10 – Redeemable Preferred Stock
Sojitz America is the sole owner of the Company’s authorized Redeemable Preferred Stock, $1 par
value, which is redeemable at the option of Sojitz America or the Company at par value aggregating
$0.3 million. A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31 and no divi-
dends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the
Redeemable Preferred Stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the
Redeemable Preferred Stock in the three years ended May 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. As the holder
of the Redeemable Preferred Stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights but does have
the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company
and its subsidiaries, on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company or on the
sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States.

Some states allow the issuance of no-par stock (either common or preferred). Some of
these states require that the entire proceeds received from the sale of the no-par stock be des-
ignated as legal capital.
Additional paid-in capital arises from the excess of amounts paid for stock over the par
or stated value of the common and preferred stock. Also included here are amounts over cost
from the sale of treasury stock (discussed later in this chapter), capital arising from the dona-
tion of assets to the firm, and transfer from retained earnings through stock dividends when
the market price of the stock exceeds par.
Common Stock
Common stock shares in all the stockholders’ rights and represents ownership that has vot-
ing and liquidation rights. Common stockholders elect the board of directors and vote on
major corporate decisions. In the event of liquidation, the liquidation rights of common
stockholders give them claims to company assets after all creditors’ and preferred stockhold-
ers’ rights have been fulfilled.
Preferred Stock
Preferred stock seldom has voting rights. When preferred stock does have voting rights, it is
usually because of missed dividends. For example, the preferred stockholders may possibly
receive voting rights if their dividends have been missed two consecutive times. Some other
preferred stock characteristics include the following:
• Preference as to dividends
• Accumulation of dividends
• Participation in excess of stated dividend rate
• Convertibility into common stock
• Callability by the corporation
• Redemption at future maturity date (see the previous discussion of redeemable preferred
stock)
• Preference in liquidation
Preference as to Dividends
When preferred stock has a preference as to dividends, the current year’s preferred dividend
must be paid before a dividend can be paid to common stockholders. For par-value (or
stated value) stock, the dividend rate is usually stated as a percentage of par. For example, if
the dividend rate were 6% and the par were $100 per share, then the dividend per share
would be $6. For no-par stock, if the dividend rate is stated as $5, then each share should
receive $5 if a dividend is paid. A preference as to dividends does not guarantee that a pre-
ferred dividend will be paid in a given year. The board of directors must declare a dividend
before a dividend is paid. The lack of a fixed commitment to pay dividends and the lack of a
due date on the principal are the primary reasons that many firms elect to issue preferred
stock instead of bonds. Preferred stock usually represents an expensive source of funds, com-
pared to bonds. The preferred stock dividends are not tax deductible, whereas interest on
bonds is deductible.
Accumulation of Dividends
If the board of directors does not declare dividends in a particular year, a holder of noncumu-
lative preferred stock will never be paid that dividend. To make the preferred stock more
attractive to investors, a corporation typically issues cumulative preferred stock. If a corpora-
tion fails to declare the usual dividend on the cumulative preferred stock, the amount of passed
dividends becomes dividends in arrears. Common stockholders cannot be paid any dividends
until the preferred dividends in arrears and the current preferred dividends are paid.
To illustrate dividends in arrears, assume a corporation has outstanding 10,000 shares
of 8%, $100 par cumulative preferred stock. If dividends are not declared in 2010 and
2011, but are declared in 2012, the preferred stockholders would be entitled to dividends in
arrears of $160,000 and current dividends in 2012 of $80,000 before any dividends could
be paid to common stockholders.

Participation in Excess of Stated Dividend Rate
When preferred stock is participating, preferred stockholders may receive an extra dividend
beyond the stated dividend rate. The terms of the participation depend on the terms included
with the stock certificate. For example, the terms may state that any dividend to common
stockholders over $10 per share will also be given to preferred stockholders.
To illustrate participating preferred stock, assume that a corporation has 8%, $100 par
preferred stock. The terms of the participation are that any dividend paid on common shares
over $10 per share will also be paid to preferred stockholders. For the current year, a divi-
dend of $12 per share is declared on the common stock. Therefore, a dividend of $10 must
be paid per share of preferred stock for the current year: (8% × $100) + $2.00 = $10.00.
Convertibility into Common Stock
Convertible preferred stock contains a provision that allows the preferred stockholders, at
their option, to convert the share of preferred stock at a specific exchange ratio into another
security of the corporation. The other security is almost always common stock. The conver-
sion feature is very attractive to investors. For example, the terms may be that each share of
preferred stock can be converted to four shares of common stock.
Convertible preferred stock is similar to a convertible bond, except that there are no
fixed payout commitments with the convertible preferred stock. The preferred dividend need
not be declared, and the preferred stock does not have a due date. The major reason for issu-
ing convertible preferred stock is similar to that for issuing convertible bonds: If the current
common stock price is low, in the opinion of management, and the firm eventually wants to
increase its common equity, then the firm can raise more money for a given number of com-
mon shares by first issuing convertible preferred stock.
A firm usually prefers to issue convertible bonds rather than convertible preferred stock
if its capital structure can carry more debt without taking on too much risk. The interest on
the convertible bond is tax deductible, while the dividend on the preferred stock is not.
Callability by the Corporation
Callable preferred stock may be retired (recalled) by the corporation at its option. The call
price is part of the original stock contract. When the preferred stock is also cumulative, the
call terms normally require payment of dividends in arrears before the call is executed.
The call provision favors the company because the company decides when to call.
Investors do not like call provisions. Therefore, to make a security that has a call provision
marketable, the call provision can normally not be exercised for a given number of years.
For example, callable preferred stock issued in 2011 may have a provision that the call
option cannot be exercised prior to 2021.
Preference in Liquidation
Should the corporation liquidate, the preferred stockholders normally have priority over
common stockholders for settlement of claims. However, the claims of preferred stockhold-
ers are secondary to the claims of creditors, including bondholders.
Preference in liquidation for preferred stock over common stock is not usually consid-
ered to be an important provision. This is because often, in liquidation, funds are not suffi-
cient to pay claims of preferred stock. Even creditors may receive only a few cents on the
dollar in satisfaction of their claims.
Disclosures
Preferred stock may carry various combinations of provisions. The provisions of each pre-
ferred stock issue should be disclosed either parenthetically in the stockholders’ equity sec-
tion of the balance sheet or in a note. A company may have various preferred stock issues,
each with different provisions. Preferred stock is illustrated in Exhibit 3-19.
Donated Capital
Donated capital may be included in the paid-in capital. Capital is donated to the company
by stockholders, creditors, or other parties (such as a city). For example, a city may offer

land to a company as an inducement to locate a factory there to increase the level of employ-
ment. The firm records the donated land at the appraised amount and records an equal
amount as donated capital in stockholders’ equity.
Another example would be a company that needs to increase its available cash. A plan
is devised, calling for existing common stockholders to donate a percentage of their stock to
the company. When the stock is sold, the proceeds are added to the cash account, and the
donated capital in stockholders’ equity is increased.
Retained Earnings
Retained earnings are the undistributed earnings of the corporation—that is, the net income
for all past periods minus the dividends (both cash and stock) that have been declared.
Retained earnings, cash dividends, and stock dividends are reviewed in more detail in
Chapter 4. Exhibit 3-19 illustrates the presentation of retained earnings.
Quasi-Reorganization
A quasi-reorganization is an accounting procedure equivalent to an accounting fresh start.
A company with a deficit balance in retained earnings “starts over” with a zero balance rather
than a deficit. A quasi-reorganization involves the reclassification of a deficit in retained earnings.
It removes the deficit and an equal amount from paid-in capital. A quasi-reorganization may also
include a restatement of the carrying values of assets and liabilities to reflect current values.
When a quasi-reorganization is performed, the retained earnings should be dated as of
the readjustment date and disclosed in the financial statements for a period of five to ten
years. Exhibit 3-20 illustrates a quasi-reorganization of Owens Corning.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
Conceptually, accumulated other comprehensive income represents retained earnings from
other comprehensive income. In addition to the aggregate amount, companies are required
to disclose the separate categories that make up accumulated other comprehensive income.

Exhibit 3-19 illustrates the presentation of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)
An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is a qualified stock-bonus, or combination stock-
bonus and money-purchase pension plan, designed to invest primarily in the employer’s
securities. A qualified plan must satisfy certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.
An ESOP must be a permanent trusteed plan for the exclusive benefit of the employees.
The trust that is part of the plan is exempt from tax on its income, and the employer/
sponsor gets a current deduction for contributions to the plan. The plan participants become
eligible for favorable taxation of distributions from the plan.
An ESOP may borrow the funds necessary to purchase the employer stock. These funds
may be borrowed from the company, its stockholders, or a third party such as a bank. The

3. Fresh-Start Accounting** (in Part)
On the Effective Date, the Company adopted fresh-start accounting in accordance with SoP 90-7.
This resulted in a new reporting entity on November 1, 2006, which has a new basis of account-
ing, a new capital structure and no retained earnings or accumulated losses. The Company was
required to implement fresh-start accounting as the holders of existing voting shares immediately
before confirmation received less than 50% of the voting shares of the Successor Company. The
fresh-start accounting principles pursuant to SoP 90-7 provide, among other things, for the Com-
pany to determine the value to be assigned to the equity of the reorganized Company as of a date
selected for financial reporting purposes.
The reorganization value represents the amount of resources available for the satisfaction of
post-petition liabilities and allowed claims, as negotiated between the Company and its creditors.
The Company’s total enterprise value at the time of emergence was $5.8 billion, with a total value
for common equity of $3.7 billion, including the estimated fair value of the Series A Warrants and
Service B Warrants issued on the Effective Date.
In accordance with fresh-start accounting, the reorganization value of the Company was allo-
cated based on the fair market values of the assets and liabilities in accordance with SFAS 141.
The fair values represented the Company’s best estimates at the Effective Date based on internal
and external appraisals and valuations. Liabilities existing at the Effective Date, other than
deferred taxes, were stated at present values of amounts to be paid determined at appropriate cur-
rent interest rates. Any portion not attributed to specific tangible or identified intangible assets
was recorded as goodwill. While the Company believes that the enterprise value approximates fair
value, differences between the methodology used in testing for goodwill impairment, as discussed
in Note 10, and the negotiated value could adversely impact the Company’s results of operations.
Pursuant to SoP 90-7, the results of operations of the ten months ended October 31, 2006
include a pre-emergence gain on the cancellation of debt of $5.9 billion resulting from the
discharge of liabilities subject to compromise and other liabilities under the Plan; and a pre-
emergence gain of $2.2 billion, net of tax, resulting from the aggregate remaining changes to the
net carrying value of the Company’s pre-emergence assets and liabilities to reflect the fair values
under fresh-start accounting.

company can guarantee the loan to the ESOP. Financial leverage—the ability of the ESOP to
borrow in order to buy employer securities—is an important aspect.
The Internal Revenue Code favors borrowing for an ESOP. Commercial lending institu-
tions, insurance companies, and mutual funds are permitted an exclusion from income for
50% of the interest received on loans used to finance an ESOP’s acquisition of company
stock. Thus, these institutions are willing to charge a reduced rate of interest for the loan.
From a company’s perspective, an ESOP has both advantages and disadvantages. One
advantage is that an ESOP serves as a source of funds for expansion at a reasonable rate.
Other possible advantages are as follows:
1. A means to buy the stock from a major shareholder or possibly an unwanted
shareholder.
2. Help in financing a leveraged buyout.
3. Reduction of potential of an unfriendly takeover.
4. Help in creating a market for the company’s stock.
Some firms do not find an ESOP attractive because it can result in a significant amount
of voting stock in the hands of their employees. Existing stockholders may not find an ESOP
desirable because it will probably dilute their proportional ownership.
The employer contribution to an ESOP reduces cash, and an unearned compensation
item decreases stockholders’ equity. The unearned compensation is amortized on the income
statement in subsequent periods. When an ESOP borrows funds and the firm (in either an
informal or a formal guarantee) commits to future contributions to the ESOP to meet the
debt-service requirements, then the firm records this commitment as a liability and as a
deferred compensation deduction within stockholders’ equity. As the debt is liquidated, the
liability and deferred compensation are reduced.
Exhibit 3-21 shows Sara Lee Corporation reporting of the ESOP.
Treasury Stock
A firm creates treasury stock when it repurchases its own stock and does not retire it. Since
treasury stock lowers the stock outstanding, it is subtracted from stockholders’ equity.
Treasury stock is, in essence, a reduction in paid-in capital.
A firm may record treasury stock in two ways. One method records the treasury stock
at par or stated value, referred to as the par-value method of recording treasury stock. This
method removes the paid-in capital in excess of par (or stated value) from the original issue.
The treasury stock appears as a reduction of paid-in capital.
The other method, referred to as the cost method, records treasury stock at the cost of the
stock (presented as a reduction of stockholders’ equity). Most firms record treasury stock at cost.
Exhibit 3-22 illustrates the presentation of treasury stock for Johnson & Johnson and
Subsidiaries. Note that a firm cannot record gains or losses from dealing in its own stock.
Any apparent gains or losses related to treasury stock must impact stockholders’ equity, such
as a reduction in retained earnings.
Stockholders’ Equity in Unincorporated Firms
These firms do not have stockholders. Stockholders’ equity in an unincorporated firm is
termed capital. The amount invested by the owner plus the retained earnings may be shown
as one sum. A sole proprietorship form of business has only one owner (one capital
account). A partnership form of business has more than one owner (capital account for each
owner). Chapter 2 reviewed these forms of business.
Statement of Stockholders’ Equity
Firms are required to present reconciliations of the beginning and ending balances of their
stockholder accounts. This is accomplished by presenting a “statement of stockholders’ equity.”
This statement will include all of the stockholders’ equity accounts. It is important when
performing analysis to be aware of changes in these accounts. For example, common stock
will indicate changes in common stock, retained earnings will indicate changes in retained

trated in Chapter 4.
For many firms, it is important to observe changes to the account Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (loss). This account is related to comprehensive income, which is
covered in Chapter 4.
Problems in Balance Sheet Presentation
Numerous problems inherent in balance sheet presentation may cause difficulty in analysis.
First, many assets are valued at cost, so one cannot determine the market value or replace-
ment cost of many assets and should not assume that their balance sheet amount approxi-
mates current valuation.
Second, varying methods are used for asset valuation. For example, inventories may be
valued differently from firm to firm and, within a firm, from product to product. Similar
problems exist with long-term asset valuation and the related depreciation alternatives.
A different type of problem exists in that not all items of value to the firm are included
as assets. For example, such characteristics as good employees, outstanding management,
and a well-chosen location do not appear on the balance sheet. In the same vein, liabilities

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (In Part)
Note 10 – Employee Stock Ownership Trust
The corporation maintains an ESOP that holds common stock of the corporation that is used to
fund a portion of the corporation’s matching program for its 401(k) savings plan for domestic
non-union employees. The purchase of the original stock by the Sara Lee ESOP was funded both
with debt guaranteed by the corporation and loans from the corporation. The debt guaranteed by
the corporation was fully paid in 2004, and only loans from the corporation to the ESOP remain.
Each year, the corporation makes contributions that, with the dividends on the common stock
held by the Sara Lee ESOP, are used to pay loan interest and principal. Shares are allocated to par-
ticipants based upon the ratio of the current year’s debt service to the sum of the total principal
and interest payments over the remaining life of the loan. The number of unallocated shares in the
ESOP was 7 million at July 3, 2010 and 8 million at June 27, 2009. Expense recognition for the
ESOP is accounted for under the grandfathered provisions contained within US GAAP.
The expense for the 401(k) recognized by the ESOP amounted to $7 million in 2010, $5 million
in 2009 and $7 million in 2008. Payments to the Sara Lee ESOP were $11 million in 2010 and
2009, and $16 million in 2008.

related to contingencies also may not appear on the balance sheet. Chapters 6 and 7 present
many of the problems of the balance sheet.
These problems do not make statement analysis impossible. They merely require that
qualitative judgment be applied to quantitative data in order to assess the impact of these
problem areas.
International Consolidated Balance Sheet (IFRS)
IFRS do not require a standard format for the balance sheet. Usually noncurrent assets are
presented first, followed by current assets. For liabilities and owners’ equity, “capital and
reserves” are usually listed first, then noncurrent liabilities, and last, current liabilities.
The reserves sections of “capital and reserves” would not be part of U.S. GAAP.
Reserves may result from upward revaluations of properties and investments. Reserves may
also result from currency translation differences, similar to the U.S. GAAP classification of
other comprehensive income.

The model financial statements have illustrated the impact of a number of new and

(see note 2 to the model financial statements for details). The model financial statements
have not illustrated the impact of new and revised Standards and Interpretations that are

In addition, the model financial statements have been presented without regard to
local laws or regulations. Preparers of financial statements will need to ensure that the
options selected under IFRSs do not conflict with such sources of regulation (e.g. the reval-
uation of assets is not permitted in certain regimes – but these financial statements illus-
trate the presentation and disclosures required when an entity adopts the revaluation
model under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment). In addition, local laws or securities
regulations may specify disclosures in addition to those required by IFRSs (e.g. in relation
to directors’ remuneration). Preparers of financial statements will consequently need to
adapt the model financial statements to comply with such additional local requirements.
The model financial statements do not include separate financial statements for the
parent, which may be required by local laws or regulations, or may be prepared volun-
tarily. Where an entity presents separate financial statements that comply with IFRSs,
the requirements of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements will apply.
Separate statements of comprehensive income, financial position, changes in equity and
cash flows for the parent will generally be required, together with supporting notes.
Suggested disclosures are cross-referenced to the underlying requirements in the texts
of the relevant Standards and Interpretations.
For the purposes of presenting the statements of comprehensive income and cash
flows, the alternatives allowed under IFRSs for those statements have been illustrated.
Preparers should select the alternatives most appropriate to their circumstances and
apply the chosen presentation method consistently.
Note that in these model financial statements, we have frequently included line items
for which a nil amount is shown, so as to illustrate items that, although not applicable
to International GAAP Holdings Limited, are commonly encountered in practice. This
does not mean that we have illustrated all possible disclosures. Nor should it be taken to
mean that, in practice, entities are required to display line items for such ‘nil’ amounts.”

Note: IAS 1.10(f) requires that an entity should present a statement of financial position as at the beginning of the earliest
comparative period when it applies an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective restatement of items in its
financial statements, or when it reclassifies items in its financial statements. However, IAS 1 does not provide further
clarification as to when an entity is required to present an additional statement of financial position.
IAS 1.31 states that an entity need not provide a specific disclosure required by an IFRS if the information is not material. In
determining whether it is necessary to present an additional statement of financial position, entities should consider the materiality
of the information that would be contained in the additional statement of financial position and whether this would affect
economic decisions made by a user of the financial statements. Specifically, it would be useful to consider factors such as the nature
of the change, the alternative disclosures provided and whether the change in accounting policy actually affected the financial
position at the beginning of the comparative period. Specific views from regulators should be considered in the assessment.
In this model, the application of new and revised standards does not result in any retrospective restatement of items in the
financial statements (see note 2). However, this model does include the additional statement of financial position and the
related notes for illustrative purposes only in order to show the level of detail to be disclosed when entities, after considering
the specific facts and circumstances and exercising judgement, conclude that the additional statement of financial position and
the related notes should be presented.

Subsequent Events
Subsequent events occur during the time period between the balance sheet data and the date
statements are issued. There are two types of subsequent events under GAAP; those that
require retroactive recognition (these require balance sheet and income statement recogni-
tion), and those that do not require retroactive recognition but require disclosure in the notes
to the financial statements. Both types of subsequent events should be material.

Subsequent events that require retroactive recognition usually relate to estimates that
were made and the subsequent event indicates that the estimates were substantially incorrect.
Possibly a major customer has gone bankrupt and a reasonable amount was not provided
for in allowance for doubtful accounts.
The second type of subsequent event does not affect the balance sheet date but does
appear to be significant to the users of the financial statements. Possibly the CEO has died and
the company is searching for a new CEO. Another example would be the issuance of a signifi-
cant amount of common stock. This type of subsequent event is illustrated in Exhibit 3-24.
Summary
The balance sheet shows the financial condition of an
accounting entity as of a particular date. It is the most basic
financial statement, and it is read by various users as part of
their decision-making process. This chapter also covered
the international consolidating balance sheet (IFRS).

EXHIBIT 3-24
Best Buy Co., Inc.
Subsequent Event
16. Subsequent Event (Dollars in millions)
In March 2011, we sold $350 principal amount of notes due March 15, 2016 (the “2016 Notes”)
and $650 principal amount of notes due March 15, 2021 (the “2021 Notes”, and together with
the 2016 Notes, the “Notes”). The 2016 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.75% per year,
while the 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per year. Interest on the Notes is pay-
able semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2011.
The Notes were issued at a slight discount to par, which when coupled with underwriting dis-
counts of $6, resulted in net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of $990.
We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater
of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values
of each remaining scheduled payment of principal and interest on the Notes redeemed discounted
to the redemption date on a semiannual basis, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal
amount of the Notes to the redemption date as described in the indenture (including the supple-
mental indenture) relating to the Notes. Furthermore, if a change of control triggering event
occurs, unless we have previously exercised our option to redeem the Notes, we will be required to
offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date.
The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our
other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes contain covenants that, among other things,
limit our ability and the ability of our North American subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens
or to enter into sale and lease-back transactions.

Q 3-21 When would noncontrolling interest be pre-
sented on a balance sheet?
Q 3-22 DeLand Company owns 100% of Little Florida,
Inc. Will DeLand Company show a noncontrolling interest
on its balance sheet? Would the answer change if it owned
only 60%? Will there ever be a case in which the subsidiary,

Kellogg Company and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (In Part)
NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (In Part)
Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kellogg Company and its
majority-owned subsidiaries (Kellogg or the Company). Intercompany balances and transac-
tions are eliminated.
The Company’s fiscal year normally ends on the Saturday closest to December 31 and
as a result, a 53rd week is added approximately every sixth year. The Company’s 2010 and
2009 fiscal years each contained 52 weeks and ended on January 1, 2011 and January 2,
2010, respectively. The Company’s 2008 fiscal year ended on January 3, 2009, and included
a 53rd week. While quarters normally consist of 13-week periods, the fourth quarter of fis-
cal 2008 included a 14th week.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of con-
tingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents
Highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when pur-
chased are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable consists principally of trade receivables, which are recorded at the invoiced
amount, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and prompt payment discounts. Trade receiv-
ables do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management’s esti-
mate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable, as determined
from a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are writ-
ten off against the allowance when management determines the receivable is uncollectible. The
Company does not have off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on an average cost basis.
Property
The Company’s property consists mainly of plants and equipment used for manufacturing
activities. These assets are recorded at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives using
straight-line methods for financial reporting and accelerated methods, where permitted, for
tax reporting. Major property categories are depreciated over various periods as follows (in
years): manufacturing machinery and equipment 5–20; office equipment 4–5; computer
equipment and capitalized software 3–5; building components 15–30; building structures
50. Cost includes interest associated with significant capital projects.
Plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when conditions indicate that the carry-
ing value may not be recoverable. Such conditions include an extended period of idleness or a
plan of disposal. Assets to be disposed of at a future date are depreciated over the remaining
period of use. Assets to be sold are written down to realizable value at the time the assets are
being actively marketed for sale and a sale is expected to occur within one year. As of year-
end 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of assets held for sale was insignificant.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized, but are tested at least annually
for impairment. An intangible asset with a finite life is amortized on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful life.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

For the goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units are estimated
based on market multiples. This approach employs market multiples based on earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, earnings for companies that are com-
parable to the Company’s reporting units and discounted cash flow. The assumptions used
for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing
similar valuations for the Company’s reporting units.
Similarly, impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying
value to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of non-goodwill intangible assets are
based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. For
instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty
stream attributable to branded product sales, discounted at rates consistent with rates used
by market participants.
These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and
anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables.
. . . . .
Research and development
The costs of research and development (R&D) are expensed as incurred and are classified in
SGA expense. R&D includes expenditures for new product and process innovation, as well
as significant technological improvements to existing products and processes. The Com-
pany’s R&D expenditures primarily consist of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and sup-
plies attributable to time spent on R&D activities. Other costs include depreciation and
maintenance of research facilities and equipment, including assets at manufacturing locations
that are temporarily engaged in pilot plant activities.
Income taxes
The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions based on a benefit recognition model. Pro-
vided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of being sustained, the Company
recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being ulti-
mately realized upon settlement. The tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more
likely than not of being sustained. The Company classifies income tax–related interest and
penalties as interest expense and SGA expense, respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of
Income. The current portion of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits is presented in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet in other current assets and other current liabilities, and the
amounts expected to be settled after one year are recorded in other assets and other liabilities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In Part)
(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
1. Description of the Business and Segment Information (In Part)
The Walt Disney Company, together with the subsidiaries through which businesses are con-
ducted (the Company), is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations in
the following business segments: Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment,
Consumer Products and Interactive Media.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (In Part)
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The Walt Disney
Company and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and trans-
actions have been eliminated in consolidation. In December 1999, DVD Financing, Inc. (DFI), a
subsidiary of Disney Vacation Development, Inc. and an indirect subsidiary of the Company,
completed a receivable sale transaction that established a facility that permitted DFI to sell receiv-
ables arising from the sale of vacation club memberships on a periodic basis. In connection with
this facility, DFI prepares separate financial statements, although its separate assets and liabilities
are also consolidated in these financial statements. DFI’s ability to sell new receivables under this
facility ended on December 4, 2008. (See Note 16 for further discussion of this facility)
Reporting Period
The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30 and consists of
fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three
week year. When a fifty-three week year occurs, the Company reports the additional week in
the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2009 was a fifty-three week year beginning on September 28, 2008
and ending on October 3, 2009.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from
those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Broadcast advertising revenues are recognized when commercials are aired. Revenues
from television subscription services related to the Company’s primary cable programming serv-
ices are recognized as services are provided. Certain of the Company’s contracts with cable and

satellite operators include annual live programming commitments. In these cases, recognition of
revenues subject to the commitments is deferred until the annual commitments are satisfied,
which generally results in higher revenue recognition in the second half of the year.
Revenues from advance theme park ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used.
For non-expiring, multi-day tickets, revenues are recognized over a three-year time period
based on estimated usage, which is derived from historical usage patterns.
Revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized when
motion pictures are exhibited. Revenues from DVD and video game sales, net of anticipated
returns and customer incentives, are recognized on the date that video units are made avail-
able for sale by retailers. Revenues from the licensing of feature films and television pro-
gramming are recorded when the content is available for telecast by the licensee and when
certain other conditions are met.
Merchandise licensing advances and guarantee royalty payments are recognized based
on the contractual royalty rate when the licensed product is sold by the licensee. Non-
refundable advances and minimum guarantee royalty payments in excess of royalties
earned are generally recognized as revenue at the end of the contract term.
Revenues from our internet and mobile operations are recognized as services are ren-
dered. Advertising revenues at our internet operations are recognized when advertisements
are viewed online.
Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented
in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a net basis.
Allowance for doubtful accounts
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncol-
lectible receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on our analysis of
trends in overall receivables aging, specific identification of certain receivables that are at risk
of not being paid, past collection experience and current economic trends. In times of domestic
or global economic turmoil, the Company’s estimates and judgments with respect to the col-
lectability of its receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods.

maturities of three months or less.
Inventories
Inventory primarily includes vacation timeshare units, merchandise, materials, and supplies.
Carrying amounts of vacation ownership units are recorded at the lower of cost or net realiz-
able value. Carrying amounts of merchandise, materials, and supplies inventories are generally
determined on a moving average cost basis and are recorded at the lower of cost or market.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (In Part)
$ in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise noted
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (In Part)
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Best Buy Co., Inc. and its con-
solidated subsidiaries. Investments in unconsolidated entities over which we exercise signifi-
cant influence but do not have control are accounted for using the equity method. We have
eliminated all intercompany accounts and transactions.
In order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing require-
ments in certain foreign jurisdictions, we consolidate the financial results of our Europe,
China, Mexico and Turkey operations on a two-month lag. Our policy is to accelerate re-
cording the effect of events occurring in the lag period that significantly affect our consoli-
dated financial statements. Except for our fiscal 2011 restructuring, for which we recorded
the effects of certain restructuring charges, no significant intervening event occurred in these
operations that would have materially affected our financial condition, results of operations,
liquidity or other factors had it been recorded during fiscal 2011. Accordingly, the $171 of
restructuring charges related to our International segment were included in our fiscal 2011
results. For further information about our fiscal 2011 restructuring and the nature of the
charges we recorded, refer to Note 5, Restructuring Charges.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the U.S. (’’GAAP’’) requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These esti-
mates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated balance sheets and
statements of earnings, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Future results could
be materially affected if actual results were to differ from these estimates and assumptions.
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of February. Fiscal 2011, 2010 and
2009 each included 52 weeks.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash primarily consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents consist of money
market funds, U.S. Treasury bills, commercial paper and time deposits such as certificates of
deposit with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased. The amounts of
cash equivalents at February 26, 2011, and February 27, 2010, were $120 and $1,108, respec-
tively, and the weighted-average interest rates were 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively.
Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit (book overdrafts) totaled $57 and
$108 at February 26, 2011, and February 27, 2010, respectively, and are reflected as
accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets.
Receivables
Receivables consist principally of amounts due from mobile phone network operators for
commissions earned; banks for customer credit card, certain debit card and electronic bene-
fits transfer (EBT) transactions; and vendors for various vendor funding programs.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

We establish allowances for uncollectible receivables based on historical collection
trends and write-off history. Our allowances for uncollectible receivables were $107 and
$101 at February 26, 2011, and February 27, 2010, respectively.
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost using either the average cost or
first-in first-out method, or market. In-bound freight-related costs from our vendors are
included as part of the net cost of merchandise inventories. Also included in the cost of in-
ventory are certain vendor allowances that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental
and identifiable costs to promote a vendor’s products. Other costs associated with acquiring,
storing and transporting merchandise inventories to our retail stores are expensed as
incurred and included in cost of goods sold.
Our inventory valuation reflects adjustments for anticipated physical inventory losses
(e.g., theft) that have occurred since the last physical inventory. Physical inventory counts
are taken on a regular basis to ensure that the inventory reported in our consolidated finan-
cial statements is properly stated.
Our inventory valuation also reflects markdowns for the excess of the cost over the
amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory. Mark-
downs establish a new cost basis for our inventory. Subsequent changes in facts or circum-
stances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that
newly established cost basis.
Restricted Assets
Restricted cash and investments in debt securities totaled $490 and $496, at February 26,
2011, and February 27, 2010, respectively, and are included in other current assets or equity
and other investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Such balances are pledged as col-
lateral or restricted to use for vendor payables, general liability insurance, workers’ compen-
sation insurance and warranty programs.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. We compute depreciation using the straight-
line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depre-
ciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period from the date the assets
are placed in service to the end of the initial lease term. Leasehold improvements made sig-
nificantly after the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful
lives or the remaining lease term, including renewal periods, if reasonably assured. Acceler-
ated depreciation methods are generally used for income tax purposes.
When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated deprecia-
tion are removed from our consolidated balance sheets and any resulting gain or loss is
reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings.
Repairs and maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred. Major
renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized
and depreciated.
Costs associated with the acquisition or development of software for internal use are
capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the software, from three to seven
years. A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal-use software is capitalized
to the extent that it enhances the software’s functionality or extends its useful life. Capital-
ized software is included in fixtures and equipment. Software maintenance and training costs
are expensed in the period incurred.
Property under capital lease is comprised of buildings and equipment used in our retail
operations and corporate support functions. The related depreciation for capital lease assets
is included in depreciation expense. The carrying value of property under capital lease was
$74 and $54 at February 26, 2011, and February 27, 2010, respectively, net of accumulated
depreciation of $45 and $41, respectively.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF CHINA UNICOM
(HONG KONG) LIMITED
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of China Unicom (Hong Kong) Limited and its
subsidiaries (together, the “Group”) at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2010 in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the Interna-
tional Accounting Standards Board and in conformity with Hong Kong Financial Reporting
Standards issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Also in our opin-
ion, the Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Inte-
grated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway

Commission (“COSO”). The Group’s management is responsible for these financial statements,
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Management’s Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included in Item 15 of this Annual Report
on Form 20-F. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on
the Group’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We con-
ducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Over-
sight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material mis-
statement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evi-
dence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the account-
ing principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of in-
ternal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other proce-
dures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Note 2.25 (a) to the consolidated financial statements, the Group
adopted the accounting policy of relative fair value method when accounting for its preferen-
tial promotional service packages retrospectively on January 1, 2010.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide rea-
sonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of finan-
cial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of fi-
nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authoriza-
tions of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

Fair Value Measurements (In Part)
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
Entities are required to use a fair value hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable
inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are
three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company’s
Level 1 assets include equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market.
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. The Company’s Level 2
assets and liabilities primarily include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less
frequently than exchange-traded instruments, corporate notes and bonds, U.S. and foreign
government and agency securities, certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, mu-
nicipal securities, commercial paper and derivative contracts whose values are determined
using pricing models with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived princi-
pally from or corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are fi-
nancial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair
value requires significant judgment or estimation. The Company’s Level 3 assets include certain
mortgage-backed securities with limited market activity. At December 31, 2010, $13 million, or
approximately 0.4%, of the Company’s investment securities were categorized as Level 3 assets.
If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one
level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant
to the fair value measurement of the instrument.

Income Statement
T
he income statement is often considered to be the most important financial statement.
Frequently used titles for this statement include statement of operations, statement of
income, and statement of earnings. Both the statement of operations and statement of
income are very popular titles.1
Basic Elements of the Income Statement
An income statement summarizes revenues and expenses and gains and losses, and ends with
the net income for a specific period. A multiple-step income statement usually presents sepa-
rately the gross profit, operating income, income before income taxes, and net income.
A simplified multiple-step income statement might look as follows:
Net Sales (Revenues)
$XXX

Cost of Goods Sold (cost of sales)
XXX
Gross Profit

Operating Expenses (selling and
administrative)
XXX

Earnings per Share

Some firms use a single-step income statement, which totals revenues and gains (sales, other
income, etc.) and then deducts total expenses and losses (cost of goods sold, operating expenses,
other expenses, etc.). A simplified single-step income statement might look as follows:

A single-step income statement lists all revenues and gains (usually in order of amount)
and then lists all expenses and losses (usually in order of amount). Total expense and loss
items deducted from total revenue and gain items determine the net income. Most firms that
present a single-step income statement modify it in some way, such as presenting federal
income tax expense as a separate item.
Exhibits 4-1 and 4-2 illustrate the different types of income statements. In Exhibit 4-1,
Ryder System, Inc., uses a single-step income statement, while in Exhibit 4-2, Intel Corpora-
tion uses a multiple-step format.

For firms that have cost of goods sold, cost of goods manufactured, or cost of services, a
multiple-step income statement should be used for analysis. The multiple-step format provides
intermediate profit figures useful in analysis. You may need to construct the multiple-step
format from the single-step. Exhibit 4-3 contains a comprehensive multiple-step income state-
ment illustration. This illustration resembles the vast majority of income statements as pre-
sented in the United States. Be familiar with this illustration. It serves as a guide to much of
our analysis.
Net Sales (Revenues)
Sales (revenues) represent revenue from goods or services sold to customers. The firm earns
revenue from the sale of its principal products. Sales are usually shown net of any discounts,
returns, and allowances.
Cost of Goods Sold (Cost of Sales)
This category shows the cost of goods sold to produce revenue. For a retailing firm, the cost
of goods sold equals beginning inventory plus purchases minus ending inventory. In a manu-
facturing firm, the cost of goods manufactured replaces purchases since the goods are pro-
duced rather than purchased. A service firm will not have cost of goods sold or cost of sales,
but it will often have cost of services.
Other Operating Revenue
Depending on the operations of the business, there may be other operating revenue, such as
lease revenue and royalties.

ing from the company’s effort to create sales, include advertising, sales commissions, sales
supplies used, and so on. Administrative expenses relate to the general administration of the
company’s operation. They include office salaries, insurance, telephone, bad debt expense,
and other costs difficult to allocate.
Other Income or Expense
In this category are secondary activities of the firm that are not directly related to the opera-
tions. For example, if a manufacturing firm has a warehouse rented, this lease income would
be other income. Dividend and interest income and gains and losses from the sale of assets
are also included here. Interest expense is categorized as other expense.
Special Income Statement Items
To comprehend and analyze profits, you need to understand income statement items that
require special disclosure. Exhibit 4-3 contains items that require special disclosure. These
items are lettered to identify them for discussion. Note that some of these items are presented
before tax and some are presented net of tax.
(A) Unusual or Infrequent Item Disclosed Separately
Certain income statement items are either unusual or occur infrequently. They might include
such items as a gain on sale of securities, write-downs of receivables, or write-downs of

inventory. These items are shown with normal, recurring revenues and expenses, and gains
and losses. If material, they will be disclosed separately, before tax. Unusual or infrequent
items are typically left in primary analysis because they relate to operations.
In supplementary analysis, unusual or infrequent items should be removed net after tax.
Usually, an estimate of the tax effect will be necessary. A reasonable estimate of the tax effect
can be made by using the effective income tax rate, usually disclosed in a note, or by dividing
income taxes by income before taxes.

(B) Equity in Earnings of Nonconsolidated Subsidiaries
When a firm accounts for its investments in stocks using the equity method (the investment
is not consolidated), the investor reports equity earnings (losses). Equity earnings (losses) are
the investor’s proportionate share of the investee’s earnings (losses). If the investor owns
20% of the stock of the investee, for example, and the investee reports income of $100,000,
then the investor reports $20,000 on its income statement. In this book, the term equity
earnings will be used unless equity losses are specifically intended.
To the extent that equity earnings are not accompanied by cash dividends, the investor
reports earnings greater than the cash flow from the investment. If an investor company
reports material equity earnings, its net income could be much greater than its ability to pay
dividends or cover maturing liabilities.
For purposes of analysis, the equity in the net income of nonconsolidated subsidiaries
raises practical problems. For example, the equity earnings represent earnings of other com-
panies, not earnings from the operations of the business. Thus, equity earnings can distort
the reported results of a business’s operations. For each ratio influenced by equity earnings,
this book suggests a recommended approach described when the ratio is introduced.
Refer to Exhibit 4-5, which illustrates equity in earnings of nonconsolidated subsidiaries
for KB Home. Leaving these accounts in the statements presents a problem for profitability
analysis because most of the profitability measures relate income figures to other figures

(usually balance sheet figures). Because these earnings are from nonconsolidated subsidiaries,
an inconsistency can result between the numerator and the denominator when computing a
ratio. (Chapter 5 presents a detailed discussion of ratios.)
Some ratios are distorted more than others by equity earnings. For example, the ratio
that relates income to sales can be distorted because of equity earnings. The numerator of
the ratio includes the earnings of the operating company and the equity earnings of noncon-
solidated subsidiaries. The denominator (sales) includes only the sales of the operating com-
pany. The sales of the unconsolidated subsidiaries will not appear on the investor’s income
statement because the subsidiary was not consolidated. This causes the ratio to be distorted.
Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated subsidiaries (equity earnings) will be presented
before tax. Any tax will be related to the dividend received, and it will typically be immate-
rial. When removing equity earnings for analysis, do not attempt a tax computation.
Income Taxes Related to Operations
Federal, state, and local income taxes, based on reported accounting profit, are shown here.
Income tax expense includes taxes paid and taxes deferred. Income taxes reported here will
not include taxes on items presented net of tax.
(C) Discontinued Operations
A common type of unusual item is the disposal of a business or product line. If the disposal
meets the criteria of a discontinued operation, then a separate income statement category for
the gain or loss from disposal of a segment of the business must be provided. In addition, the
results of operations of the segment that has been or will be disposed of are reported in con-
junction with the gain or loss on disposal. These effects appear as a separate category after
continuing operations.
Discontinued operations pose a problem for profitability analysis. Ideally, income from
continuing operations would be the better figure to use to project future income. Several
practical problems associated with the removal of a gain or a loss from the discontinued
operations occur in the primary profitability analysis. These problems revolve around two
points: (1) an inadequate disclosure of data related to the discontinued operations, in order
to remove the balance sheet amounts associated with the discontinued operations; and
(2) the lack of past profit and loss data associated with the discontinued operations.

Ideally, the balance sheet accounts that relate to the discontinued operations should be
removed for primary analysis. Consider these items on a supplemental basis because they
will not contribute to future operating revenue. However, inadequate disclosure often makes
it impossible to remove these items from your analysis.
The balance sheet items related to discontinued operations are frequently disposed of
when the business or product line has been disposed of prior to the year-end balance sheet
date. In this case, the balance sheet accounts related to discontinued operations do not pres-
ent a problem for the current year.
(D) Extraordinary Items
Extraordinary items are material events and transactions distinguished by their unusual na-
ture and by the infrequency of their occurrence. Examples include a major casualty (such as
a fire), prohibition under a newly enacted law, or an expropriation. These items, net of their
tax effects, must be shown separately. Some pronouncements have specified items that must
be considered extraordinary; an example is a material tax loss carryover. The effect of an
extraordinary item on earnings per share must also be shown separately. Exhibit 4-7
presents an extraordinary gain.
In analysis of income for purposes of determining a trend, extraordinary items should be
eliminated since the extraordinary item is not expected to recur. In supplementary analysis, these
extraordinary items should be considered, as this approach avoids disregarding these items.
Extraordinary items are always presented net of applicable income taxes. Therefore, the items
as presented on the income statement are removed without further adjustment for income taxes.

(E) Change in Accounting Principle
At times the company will change from one generally accepted accounting principle to
another generally accepted accounting principle or an account principle is made obsolete by
a new standard from the FASB.
Current GAAP requires a retrospective approach to changes in accounting principles
unless it is impracticable to do so. This means that prior years’ financial statements that are
presented are revised in the year of change. (The balance sheet is presented for two years,
income statement for three years, and statement of cash flows for three years).
The cumulative effect on prior years reported (prior to the change year) is reflected in
the company’s beginning retained earnings in the change year.
With this standard there is comparability of accounting principles for the statements pre-
sented. When using prior annual reports, there will not be comparability. This does present
a challenge when doing analysis. It will not be possible to do a consistent analysis if more
than one annual report is used.
When it is impracticable to determine the retrospective approach on prior years, then it
may be possible to determine the difference to the opening balances in the accounts. Then the
opening retained earnings in the year of change will reflect the cumulative effect on prior years.
In this case, prior years’ financial statements that are presented are not revised in the
year of change.
Prior to the current GAAP, voluntary changes in accounting principle were presented
using the prospective method in the United States. With the prospective method, the
accounts of each year prior period are not adjusted to reflect the effects of applying the new
principle. The new accounting principle is used in the current financial statements, and the
effect of using the new principle in prior financial statements is disclosed on the current
income statement as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax.
The United States reporting prior to the new standard was inconsistent with the report-
ing under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The current standard does not rule out the possibility that a new standard could include spe-
cific directions on how to report a change in principle. Thus it is possible that the cumulative
effect could be directed to be reported in the income statement in the year of change. A standard
making the LIFO inventory method obsolete could possibly be handled that way. If such a stand-
ard is issued then remove the cumulative effect of accounting change in the primary analysis.
See Exhibit 4-8 for the cumulative effect of accounting change on the income statement.

(F) Net Income—Noncontrolling Interest (previously minority
share of earnings)
If a firm consolidates subsidiaries not wholly owned, the total revenues and expenses of the
subsidiaries are included with those of the parent. However, to determine the income that
would accrue to the parent, it is necessary to deduct the portion of income that would belong
to the net income—noncontrolling interest. Prior to December 31, 2009, this was called “mi-
nority share of earnings.” This item should be presented net of tax.
Noncontrolling interest reflects income from ownership of noncontrolling shareholders
in the equity of consolidated subsidiaries less than wholly owned. Exhibit 4-9 illustrates net
income attributable to the noncontrolling interest.
Some ratios can be materially distorted because of a net income—noncontrolling inter-
est. For each ratio influenced by a net income—noncontrolling interest, this book suggests a
recommended approach.

Earnings per Share
In general, earnings per share is earnings divided by the number of shares of outstanding
common stock. Chapter 9 presents earnings per share in detail and explains its computation.
Meanwhile, use the formula of net income divided by outstanding shares of common stock.
Retained Earnings
Retained earnings, an account on the balance sheet, represents the undistributed earnings of the
corporation. A reconciliation of retained earnings summarizes the changes in retained earnings. It
shows the retained earnings at the beginning of the year, the net income for the year as an addi-
tion, the dividends as a subtraction, and concludes with end-of-year retained earnings. It also
includes, if appropriate, prior period adjustments (net of tax) and some adjustments for changes
in accounting principles (net of tax). These restate beginning retained earnings. Other possible
changes to retained earnings are beyond the scope of this book.
Sometimes a portion of retained earnings may be unavailable for dividends because it
has been appropriated (restricted). Appropriated retained earnings remain part of retained
earnings. The appropriation of retained earnings may or may not have significance.
Appropriations that result from legal requirements (usually state law) and appropria-
tions that result from contractual agreements are potentially significant. The appropriations
may leave unappropriated retained earnings inadequate to pay dividends. (Note: A corpora-
tion will not be able to pay a cash dividend even with an adequate unrestricted balance in
retained earnings unless it has adequate cash or ability to raise cash and has complied with
the state law where it is incorporated.)
Most appropriations result from management decisions. These are usually not signifi-
cant because management can choose to remove the appropriation.
Caution should be exercised not to confuse retained earnings or appropriated retained earn-
ings with cash or any other asset. There is no cash or any other asset in retained earnings. The
reason for an appropriation will be disclosed either in the reconciliation of retained earnings or in
a note. From this disclosure, try to arrive at an opinion as to the significance, if any.
The reconciliation of retained earnings usually appears as part of a statement of stockholders’
equity. Sometimes it is combined with the income statement. Exhibit 4-10 gives an example of a
reconciliation of retained earnings being presented with a stockholders’ equity statement.
Dividends and Stock Splits
Dividends return profits to the owners of a corporation. A cash dividend declared by the
board of directors reduces retained earnings by the amount of the dividends declared and
creates the current liability, dividends payable. The date of payment occurs after the date of
declaration. The dividend payment eliminates the liability, dividends payable, and reduces
cash. Note that the date of the declaration of dividends, not the date of the dividend pay-
ment, affects retained earnings and creates the liability.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

The board of directors may elect to declare and issue another type of dividend, termed a
stock dividend. The firm issues a percentage of outstanding stock as new shares to existing
shareholders. If the board declares a 10% stock dividend, for example, an owner holding
1,000 shares would receive an additional 100 shares of new stock. The accounting for a
stock dividend, assuming a relatively small distribution (less than 25% of the existing stock),
requires removing the fair market value of the stock at the date of declaration from retained
earnings and transferring it to paid-in capital. With a material stock dividend, the amount
removed from retained earnings and transferred to paid-in capital is determined by multiply-
ing the par value of the stock by the number of additional shares. Note that the overall effect
of a stock dividend leaves total stockholders’ equity and each owner’s share of stockholders’
equity unchanged. However, the total number of outstanding shares increases.
A stock dividend should reduce the market value of individual shares by the percentage of the
stock dividend. Total market value considering all outstanding shares should not change in theory.
In practice, the market value change may not be the same percentage as the stock dividend.
A more drastic device to change the market value of individual shares is by declaring a
stock split. A 2-for-1 split should reduce the market value per share to one-half the amount
prior to the split. The market value per share in practice may not change exactly in propor-
tion to the split. The market value will result from the supply and demand for the stock.
Lowering the market value is sometimes desirable for stocks selling at high prices (as
perceived by management). Stocks with high prices are less readily traded. A stock dividend
or stock split can influence the demand for the stock.
A stock split merely increases the number of shares of stock. It does not usually change
retained earnings or paid-in capital. For example, if a firm had 1,000 shares of common
stock, a 2-for-1 stock split would result in 2,000 shares.
For a stock split, the par or stated value of the stock is changed in proportion to the
stock split, and no change is made to retained earnings, additional paid-in capital, or capital
stock. For example, a firm with $10 par common stock that declares a 2-for-1 stock split
would reduce the par value to $5.
Sometimes the company wants to increase the market value of individual shares by declaring
a reverse stock split. In this case, the company recalls its present stock and issues a lesser number
of shares. This could be one-for-two, one-for-three, one-for-four, one-for-five, one-for-six, etc.
The Sanmina-Sci Corporation did a reverse stock split. They included the following in
their 2009 annual report:
“Reverse Stock Split. On July 20, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company author-
ized a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio of one-for-six, effective August 14,
2009. The Company’s stockholders previously approved the reverse split in September
2008. As a result of the reverse split, every six shares of common stock outstanding were
combined into one share of common stock. The reverse split did not affect the amount of eq-
uity the Company has nor did it affect the Company’s market capitalization.”
Since the number of shares changes under both a stock dividend and stock split, any ra-
tio based on the number of shares must be restated for a meaningful comparison. For exam-
ple, if a firm had earnings per share of $4 in 2010, a 2-for-1 stock split in 2011 would
require restatement of the earnings per share to $2 in 2010 because of the increase in the
shares. Restatement will be made for all prior financial statements presented with the current
financial statements, including a 5- or 10-year summary.

Legality of Distributions to Stockholders
The legality of distributions to stockholders is governed by applicable state law. Currently,
the 50 states may be classified into one of three groups for purposes of distributions to stock-
holders. These groups are the following:2
1. Distributions to stockholders are acceptable as long as the firm has the ability to pay
debts as they come due in the normal course of business.
2. Distributions to stockholders are acceptable as long as the firm is solvent and the
distributions do not exceed the fair value of net assets.
3. Distributions consist of solvency and balance sheet tests of liquidity and risk.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Thus, the appropriateness of a distribution to stockholders is a legal interpretation.
Accountants have not accepted the role of disclosing the firm’s capacity to make distribu-
tions to stockholders. Accountants have accepted the role of disclosing appropriations
(restrictions) of retained earnings. Appropriations can temporarily limit the firm’s ability to
make distributions. These appropriations are typically directed toward limiting or prohibit-
ing the payment of cash dividends.
During the 1980s and 1990s, many distributions to stockholders exceeded the net book
value of the firm’s assets. These were often accompanied by debt-financed restructurings. Of-
ten, the result was a deficit balance in retained earnings and sometimes a deficit balance in
total stockholders’ equity.
During 1988, Holiday Corporation (owner of Holiday Inns of America) distributed a
$65 per share dividend to prevent a hostile takeover. The result was a substantial deficit to
retained earnings and approximately a $770 million deficit to total stockholders’ equity.3
A similar situation took place at Owens Corning during the 1980s as it made a substan-
tial distribution to stockholders by way of a debt-financed restructuring. Owens Corning
also had substantial expenses related to asbestos-related illnesses. At the end of 1995, Owens
Corning had a deficit in retained earnings of $781 million and a deficit in total stockholders’
equity of $212 million.
An Owens Corning news release of June 20, 1996, stated (in part):
The Board of Directors has approved an annual dividend policy of 25 cents per share
and declared a quarterly dividend of 6-1/4 cents per share payable on October 15,
1996 to shareholders of record as of September 30, 1996.
In reference to the dividend, we were able to initiate this action because debt has been
reduced to target levels and cash flow from operations will be in excess of internal
funding requirements.
We are delighted to be able to reward our shareholders with a dividend. Reinstating
the dividend has been a priority of mine since joining the company and I am pleased
that we now are in a position to set the date.
Comprehensive Income
Chapter 1 described the Concept Statements that serve as the basis for evaluating existing
standards of financial accounting and reports. Concept Statement Nos. 5 and 6 included the
concept of comprehensive income. Comprehensive income was described in SFAC No. 6 as
the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other
events and circumstances from nonowner sources.
Subsequently, SFAS No. 130 was issued, requiring the reporting of comprehensive
income, but using a narrower definition than in SFAC No. 6. Under SFAS No. 130, compre-
hensive income is net income plus the period’s change in accumulated other comprehensive
income. Accumulated other comprehensive income is a category within stockholders’ equity,
described in Chapter 3.
Categories within accumulated other comprehensive income are:
1. Foreign currency translation adjustments. The expansion of international business and
extensive currency realignment have created special accounting problems. The biggest
difficulty has been related to translating foreign financial statements into the financial
statements of a U.S. enterprise.
U.S. financial reporting calls for postponing the recognition of unrealized exchange
gains and losses until the foreign operation is substantially liquidated. This postponement
is accomplished by creating a separate category within stockholders’ equity to carry
unrealized exchange gains and losses. This method eliminates the wide fluctuations in
earnings from translation adjustments for most firms. For subsidiaries operating in highly
inflationary economies, translation adjustments are charged to net earnings. Also, actual
foreign currency exchange gains (losses) are included in net earnings.
2. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. Debt and
equity securities classified as available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Unrealized holding gains and losses are included in a separate category within
stockholders’ equity until realized. Thus, the unrealized holding gains and losses are not
included in net earnings. Note that this accounting only applies to securities available for
sale. Trading securities are reported at their fair values on the balance sheet date, and
unrealized holding gains and losses are included in income of the current period. Debt
securities held to maturity are reported at their amortized cost on the balance sheet date.
3. Changes to stockholders’ equity resulting from additional minimum pension liability
adjustments. Accounting standards require a reduction in stockholders’ equity for a
minimum pension liability under a defined benefit plan. Accounting for a defined benefit
plan is reviewed in Chapter 7.
4. Unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are
financial instruments or other contracts where rights or obligations meet the definitions
of assets or liabilities. The gain or loss for some derivative instruments is reported in
current earnings. For other derivative instruments, the gain or loss is reported as a
component of other comprehensive income. The gain or loss for these instruments is
recognized in subsequent periods in income as the hedged forecasted transactions affect
earnings.
Required disclosures are the following:
• Comprehensive income
• Each category of other comprehensive income
• Reclassification adjustments for categories of other comprehensive income
• Tax effects for each category of other comprehensive income
• Balances for each category of accumulated other comprehensive income
The accounting standard provided considerable flexibility in reporting comprehensive
income. One format uses a single income statement to report net income and comprehensive
income. The second format reports comprehensive income in a separate statement of finan-
cial activity. The third format reports comprehensive income within the statement of changes
in stockholders’ equity. Exhibit 4-10 presents the accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) of Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. Reliance presents this within its consolidated state-
ments of shareholders’ equity.
The first two options were not popular because they require that comprehensive income
be closely tied to the income statement. Comprehensive income will typically be more vola-
tile than net income. This is because the items within accumulated other comprehensive
income have the potential to be volatile. A good case could be made that comprehensive
income is a better indication of long-run profitability than is net income. Some firms elected
to disclose comprehensive income as a note to the financial statements.
The FASB and IASB entered into a joint project to improve the presentation of compre-
hensive income in a manner that is as convergent as possible. At that time the IFRS only pro-
vided for comprehensive income to be presented either in a single statement or in two
consecutive statements.
The result of this joint project was that the FASB in 2011 issued an amendment of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification which ruled out the option of reporting compre-
hensive income within the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity.
Thus with the effective fiscal year after December 15, 2011, only the following options
are available:
1. A single income statement reporting net income and comprehensive income, or
2. Report comprehensive income in a separate statement immediately following the
statement of income.
Exhibit 4-11 has illustrations—reporting comprehensive income. Illustration (A)—single
income statement to report net income and comprehensive income and illustration (B)—
comprehensive income in a separate statement.
This new standard is effective for interim periods. The coverage of comprehensive
income in analysis is in Chapter 12.

International Consolidated Income Statement (IFRS)
IFRS and U.S. GAAP for the income statement are similar, with some presentation differen-
ces. U.S. GAAP requires either a single-step or multiple-step format. There is no required for-
mat under IFRS. Under IFRS, expenses are classified by their nature or function.
Under IFRS, equipment may be revalued. This would result in the adjustment of depreci-
ation expenses. IFRS allows for alternative performance measures to be presented in the
income statement that are not allowed by U.S. GAAP.

Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, one of the big four public accounting firms, presents
model financial statements under IFRS available on www.deloitte.com. These following
model financial statements will be used to illustrate statements under IFRS:
International GAAP Holdings Limited
Financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011
The model financial statements of International GAAP Holdings Limited for the year
ended 31 December 2011 are intended to illustrate the presentation and disclosure
requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). They also contain
additional disclosures that are considered to be best practice, particularly where such
disclosures are included in illustrative examples provided with a specific Standard.
International GAAP Holdings Limited is assumed to have presented financial
statements in accordance with IFRSs for a number of years. Therefore, it is not a first-
time adopter of IFRSs. Readers should refer to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International
Financial Reporting Standards for specific requirements regarding an entity’s first IFRS
financial statements, and to the IFRS 1 section of Deloitte’s Compliance, Presentation
and Disclosure Checklist for details of the particular disclosure requirements applicable
for first-time adopters. Deloitte’s Compliance, Presentation and Disclosure Checklist
can be downloaded from Deloitte’s web site www.iasplus.com.
The model financial statements have illustrated the impact of a number of new and
revised Standards and Interpretations that are mandatorily effective on 1 January 2011
(see note 2 to the model financial statements for details). The model financial statements
have not illustrated the impact of new and revised Standards and Interpretations that are
not yet mandatorily effective on 1 January 2011 (e.g. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments).
In addition, the model financial statements have been presented without regard to
local laws or regulations. Preparers of financial statements will need to ensure that the
options selected under IFRSs do not conflict with such sources of regulation (e.g. the
revaluation of assets is not permitted in certain regimes – but these financial
statements illustrate the presentation and disclosures required when an entity adopts
the revaluation model under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment). In addition, local
laws or securities regulations may specify disclosures in addition to those required by
IFRSs (e.g. in relation to directors’ remuneration). Preparers of financial statements will

consequently need to adapt the model financial statements to comply with such
additional local requirements.
The model financial statements do not include separate financial statements for the
parent, which may be required by local laws or regulations, or may be prepared
voluntarily. Where an entity presents separate financial statements that comply with
IFRSs, the requirements of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements will apply.
Separate statements of comprehensive income, financial position, changes in equity and
cash flows for the parent will generally be required, together with supporting notes.
Suggested disclosures are cross-referenced to the underlying requirements in the texts of
the relevant Standards and Interpretations.
For the purposes of presenting the statements of comprehensive income and cash
flows, the alternatives allowed under IFRSs for those statements have been illustrated.
Preparers should select the alternatives most appropriate to their circumstances and
apply the chosen presentation method consistently.
Note that in these model financial statements, we have frequently included line items for
which a nil amount is shown, so as to illustrate items that, although not applicable to
International GAAP Holdings Limited, are commonly encountered in practice. This does
not mean that we have illustrated all possible disclosures. Nor should it be taken to
mean that, in practice, entities are required to display line items for such ‘nil’ amounts.

Note: Alt 1 above illustrates the presentation of comprehensive income in one statement. Alt 2 (see next
pages) illustrates the presentation of comprehensive income in two statements.
Whichever presentation is selected, the distinction is retained between items recognised in profit or loss and
items recognised in other comprehensive income. The only difference between the one-statement and the
two-statement approaches is that, for the latter, a total is struck in the separate income statement at ‘profit
for the year’ (this is the same amount as is presented as a sub-total under the one-statement approach). This
‘profit for the year’ is then the starting point for the statement of comprehensive income, which is required to
be presented immediately following the income statement. Under the two-statement approach, the analysis of
‘profit for the year’ between the amount attributable to the owners of the parent and the amount attributable
to non-controlling interests is presented at the end of the separate income statement.
Irrespective of whether the one-statement or the two-statement approach is followed, for the components
of other comprehensive income, additional presentation options are available, as follows.
IAS 1.90
: The individual components may be presented net of tax in the statement of comprehensive income (as
illustrated on the previous page), or they may be presented gross with a single line deduction for tax (see
Alt 2). Whichever option is selected, the income tax relating to each component of comprehensive income
must be disclosed, either in the statement of comprehensive income or in the notes (see note 29).
IAS 1.93
: For reclassification adjustments, an aggregated presentation may be adopted, with separate disclosure of
the current year gain or loss and reclassification adjustments in the notes (see previous page and note 29).
Alternatively, using a disaggregated presentation, the current year gain or loss and reclassification
adjustments are shown separately in the statement of comprehensive income (see Alt 2).
Alt 1 aggregates expenses according to their function.

Summary
The income statement summarizes the profit for a specific
period of time. To understand and analyze profitability, the
reader must be familiar with the components of income, as well
as income statement items that require special disclosure. This
chapter presented special income statement items, such as
unusual or infrequent items disclosed separately, equity in
earnings of nonconsolidated subsidiaries, discontinued opera-
tions, extraordinary items, and net income—noncontrolling in-
terest. This chapter also covered the reconciliation of retained
earnings, dividends and stock splits, and comprehensive income,
and international consolidated income statements (IFRS).
Questions
Q 4-1 What are extraordinary items? How are they shown
on the income statement? Why are they shown in that manner?
Q 4-2 Which of the following would be classified as
extraordinary?
a. Selling expense
b. Interest expense
c. Gain on the sale of marketable securities
d. Loss from flood
e. Income tax expense
f. Loss from prohibition of red dye
g. Loss from the write-down of inventory
Q 4-3 Give three examples of unusual or infrequent items
that are disclosed separately. Why are they shown separately?
Are they presented before or after tax? Why or why not?
Q 4-4 Why is the equity in earnings of nonconsolidated
subsidiaries sometimes a problem in profitability analysis?
Discuss with respect to income versus cash flow.
Q 4-5 A health food distributor selling wholesale dairy
products and vitamins decides to discontinue the division
that sells vitamins. How should this discontinuance be clas-
sified on the income statement?
Q 4-6 Why are unusual or infrequent items disclosed
before tax?
Q 4-7 In the future, we should expect few presentations of a
“cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.” Comment.
Q 4-8 How does the declaration of a cash dividend affect
the financial statements? How does the payment of a cash
dividend affect the financial statements?
Q 4-9 What is the difference in the impact on financial
statements of a stock dividend versus a stock split?
Q 4-10 Why
is
net
income–noncontrolling
interest
deducted before arriving at net income?
Q 4-11 Explain the relationship between the income
statement and the reconciliation of retained earnings.
Q 4-12 List the three types of appropriated retained earn-
ings accounts. Which of these types is most likely not a det-
riment to the payment of a dividend? Explain.
Q 4-13 A balance sheet represents a specific date, such as
“December 31,” while an income statement covers a pe-
riod of time, such as “For the Year Ended December 31,
2011.” Why does this difference exist?
Q 4-14 Describe the following items:
a. Net income–noncontrolling interest
b. Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated subsidiaries
Q 4-15 An income statement is a summary of revenues
and expenses and gains and losses, ending with net income
for a specific period of time. Indicate the two traditional
formats for presenting the income statement. Which of
these formats is preferable for analysis? Why?
Q 4-16 Melcher Company reported earnings per share in
2011 and 2010 of $2.00 and $1.60, respectively. In 2012,
there was a 2-for-1 stock split, and the earnings per share
for 2012 were reported to be $1.40. Give a three-year pre-
sentation of earnings per share (2010–2012).
Q 4-17 Comment on your ability to determine a firm’s
capacity to make distributions to stockholders, using pub-
lished financial statements.
Q 4-18 Management does not usually like to tie comprehen-
sive income closely with the income statement. Comment.
Q 4-19 Review the consolidated income statement, expenses
analyzed by function (Exhibit 4-12). Comment on similarities
and differences to the U.S. GAAP income statement.
Q 4-20 Review
the
consolidated
income
statement,
expenses analyzed by nature (Exhibit 4-13). Comment on sim-
ilarities and differences to the U.S. GAAP income statement.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (In Part)
The following is a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies:
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION – The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Perry Ellis International, Inc. and its wholly-owned and controlled subsidia-
ries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The
ownership interest in consolidated subsidiaries of non-controlling shareholders is reflected as
noncontrolling interest. The Company’s consolidation principles would also consolidate any
entity in which the Company would be deemed a primary beneficiary.
USE OF ESTIMATES — The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires manage-
ment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts in the consolidated finan-
cial statements and the accompanying footnotes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Required
a. 1. Comment on the principles of consolidation.
2. Does it appear that there is a 100% ownership in all consolidated subsidiaries?
b. Comment on the use of estimates.
c. Would you expect an impairment in marketable securities?
d. What type of “special item” would be “costs on early extinguishment debt”?

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (In Part)
Note A – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (In Part)
Inventories and Cost of Sales (In part)
For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The
Company’s determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash
flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related
estimated cash flow streams. When an impairment charge for a community is determined,
the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner land and devel-
opment costs are allocated to each lot. The inventory within each community is categorized
as construction in progress and finished homes, residential land and lots developed and
under development, and land held for development, based on the stage of production or
plans for future development.
The Company typically does not purchase land for resale. However, when the Company
owns land or communities under development that no longer fit into its development and
construction plans and it is determined that the best use of the asset is the sale of the asset,
the project is accounted for as land held for sale, assuming the land held for sale criteria are
met. The Company records land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value
less estimated costs to sell. In performing impairment evaluation for land held for sale, sev-
eral factors are considered including, but not limited to, prices for land in recent comparable
sales transactions, market analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing buyer
would pay for the land and recent legitimate offers received. If the estimated fair value less
costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written down to its
estimated fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed com-
munities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the
fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes. The key assumptions relating to the valua-
tions are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors, and
are inherently uncertain. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could
differ from such estimates. The Company’s quarterly assessments reflect management’s

estimates and it continues to monitor the fair value of held-for-sale assets through the dispo-
sition date. See Note D.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired. The Company
tests goodwill for potential impairment annually as of September 30, or more frequently if
an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill
may not be recoverable. In analyzing the potential impairment of goodwill, a two-step proc-
ess is utilized that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the operating segments. If
the results of the first step indicate that impairment potentially exists, the second step is per-
formed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Impairment is determined to exist
when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value.
In performing its goodwill impairment analysis, the Company estimates the fair value of
its operating segments utilizing the present values of expected future cash flows. As a result of
the analyses performed as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, it was determined that the fair
value of the operating segments was greater than their carrying value and therefore, no impair-
ment of goodwill existed. As a result of the analysis performed as of September 30, 2008, the
Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $79.4 million, all of which related to its
Southwest reporting segment. Combined with previous impairments, accumulated goodwill
impairment losses at September 30, 2010 and 2009 totaled $553.5 million. As of September
30, 2010 and 2009, the Company’s remaining goodwill balance was $15.9 million, all of
which related to its South Central reporting segment. The goodwill assessment procedures
require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs.
Required
a. Does it appear that inventories are a highly liquid asset?
b. Goodwill impairment – what does this imply?
c. Why have early retirement of debt?

Chapter
5
Basics of Analysis
T
he analysis of financial data employs various techniques to emphasize the compara-
tive and relative importance of the data presented and to evaluate the position of the
firm. These techniques include ratio analysis, common-size analysis, study of differen-
ces in components of financial statements among industries, review of descriptive material,
and comparisons of results with other types of data. The information derived from these
types of analysis should be blended to determine the overall financial position. No one type
of analysis supports overall findings or serves all types of users. This chapter provides an
introduction to different analyses and uses of financial information.
Financial statement analysis is a judgmental process. One of the primary objectives is
identification of major changes (turning points) in trends, amounts, and relationships and
investigation of the reasons underlying those changes. Often, a turning point may signal an
early warning of a significant shift in the future success or failure of the business. The judg-
ment process can be improved by experience and by use of analytical tools.
Ratio Analysis
Financial ratios are usually expressed as a percent or as times per period. The following
ratios will be discussed fully in future chapters.
1. Liquidity ratios measure a firm’s ability to meet its current obligations. They may
include ratios that measure the efficiency of the use of current assets and current
liabilities (Chapter 6).
2. Borrowing capacity (leverage) ratios measure the degree of protection of suppliers of
long-term funds (Chapter 7).
3. Profitability ratios measure the earning ability of a firm. Discussion will include
measures of the use of assets in general (Chapter 8).
4. Investors are interested in a special group of ratios, in addition to liquidity, debt, and
profitability ratios (Chapter 9).
5. Cash flow ratios can indicate liquidity, borrowing capacity, or profitability (Chapter 10).

A ratio can be computed from any pair of numbers. Given the large quantity of variables
included in financial statements, a very long list of meaningful ratios can be derived. A stand-
ard list of ratios or standard computation of them does not exist. Each author and source on
financial analysis uses a different list and often a different computation of the same ratio.
This book presents frequently utilized and discussed ratios.
Ratios are interpretable in comparison with (1) prior ratios, (2) ratios of competitors,
(3) industry ratios, and (4) predetermined standards. The trend of a ratio and the variability
of a ratio are important considerations.
Comparison of income statement and balance sheet numbers, in the form of ratios, can
create difficulties due to the timing of the financial statements. Specifically, the income state-
ment covers the entire fiscal period; whereas the balance sheet applies to a single point in
time, the end of the period. Ideally, then, to compare an income statement figure such as
sales to a balance sheet figure such as receivables, we need to know the average receivables
for the year that the sales figure covers. However, these data are not available to the external
analyst. In some cases, the analyst uses an average of the beginning and ending balance sheet
figures. This approach smooths out changes from beginning to end, but it does not eliminate
problems due to seasonal and cyclical changes. It also does not reflect changes that occur
unevenly throughout the year.
Be aware that computing averages from two similar balance sheet dates can be mislead-
ing. It is possible that a representative average cannot be computed from externally pub-
lished statements.
A ratio will usually represent a fairly accurate trend, even when the ratio is distorted. If
the ratio is distorted, then it does not represent a good absolute number.
Applying the U.S. techniques of ratio analysis to statements prepared in other countries
can be misleading. The ratio analysis must be understood in terms of the accounting princi-
ples used and the business practices and culture of the country.
Common-Size Analysis (Vertical and Horizontal)
Common-size analysis expresses comparisons in percentages. For example, if cash is
$40,000 and total assets is $1 million, then cash represents 4% of total assets. The use of
percentages is usually preferable to the use of absolute amounts. An illustration will make
this clear. If Firm A earns $10,000 and Firm B earns $1,000, which is more profitable? Firm
A is probably your response. However, the total owners’ equity of A is $1 million, and B’s is
$10,000. The return on owners’ equity is as follows:
Firm A
Firm B
Earnings
Owners’ Equity
$10,000
$1,000,000
¼ 1%
$1,000
$10,000
¼ 10%
The use of common-size analysis makes comparisons of firms of different sizes much
more meaningful. Care must be exercised in the use of common-size analysis with small
absolute amounts because a small change in amount can result in a very substantial percent-
age change. For example, if profits last year amounted to $100 and increased this year to
$500, this would be an increase of only $400 in profits, but it would represent a substantial
percentage increase.
Vertical analysis compares each amount with a base amount selected from the same
year. For example, if advertising expenses were $1,000 in 2011 and sales were $100,000,
the advertising would have been 1% of sales.
Horizontal analysis compares each amount with a base amount for a selected base year.
For example, if sales were $400,000 in 2010 and $600,000 in 2011, then sales increased to
150% of the 2010 level in 2011, an increase of 50%.
Exhibit 5-1 illustrates common-size analysis (vertical and horizontal).

Year-to-Year Change Analysis
Comparing financial statements over two time periods using absolute amounts and percentages
can be meaningful. This approach aids in keeping absolute and percentage changes in perspec-
tive. For example, a substantial percentage change may not be relevant because of an immate-
rial absolute change. When performing year-to-year change analysis, follow these rules:
1. When an item has value in the base year and none in the next period, the decrease is
100%.
2. A meaningful percent change cannot be computed when one number is positive and the
other number is negative.
3. No percent change is computable when there is no figure for the base year.
These rules are illustrated in Exhibit 5-2.

Merchandising (retail-wholesale) firms sell products purchased from other firms. A
principal asset is inventory, which consists of merchandise inventories. For some mer-
chandising firms, a large amount of sales may be for cash. In such cases, the receivables
balance will be relatively low. Other merchandising firms have a large amount of sales
charged but also accept credit cards such as VISA, so they also have a relatively low bal-
ance in receivables. Other firms extend credit and carry the accounts receivable and thus
have a relatively large receivables balance. Because of the competitive nature of the
industry, profit ratios on the income statement are often quite low, with the cost of sales
and operating expenses constituting a large portion of expenses. Refer to Exhibit 5-3,
Best Buy Co., Inc.
A service firm generates its revenue from the service provided. Because service cannot
typically be stored, inventory is low or nonexistent. In people-intensive services, such as
advertising, investment in property and equipment is also low compared with that of manu-
facturing firms. Refer to Exhibit 5-4, Kelly Services, Inc., and Subsidiaries.
A manufacturing firm will usually have large inventories composed of raw materials,
work in process, and finished goods, as well as a material investment in property, plant, and
equipment. Notes and accounts receivable may also be material, depending on the terms of
sale. The cost of sales often represents the major expense. Refer to Exhibit 5-5, Cooper Tire &
Rubber Company.

Review of Descriptive Information
The descriptive information found in an annual report, in trade periodicals, and in industry
reviews helps us understand the financial position of a firm. Descriptive material might dis-
cuss the role of research and development in producing future sales, present data on capital
expansion and the goals related thereto, discuss aspects of employee relations such as minor-
ity hiring or union negotiations, or help explain the dividend policy of the firm. In its annual
report, a company must present a section called Management Discussion and Analysis
(MD&A). This section provides an overview of the previous year and of future goals and
new projects. Although the MD&A is unaudited, the information it contains can be very
useful.
Comparisons
Absolute figures or ratios appear meaningless unless compared to other figures or ratios. If
a person were asked if $10 is a lot of money, the frame of reference would determine the
answer. To a small child, still in awe of a quarter, $10 is a lot. To a millionaire, a $10 bill is
nothing. Similarly, having 60% of total assets composed of buildings and equipment would
be normal for some firms but disastrous for others. One must have a guide to determine the
meaning of the ratios and other measures. Several types of comparisons offer insight.
Trend Analysis
Trend analysis studies the financial history of a firm for comparison. By looking at the trend
of a particular ratio, one sees whether that ratio is falling, rising, or remaining relatively con-
stant. This helps detect problems or observe good management.
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual
The Standard Industrial Classification is a statistical classification of business by industry.
The National Technical Information Service publishes the classification manual. The manual
is the responsibility of the Office of Management and Budget, which is under the executive
office of the president.
Use of the SIC promotes comparability of various facets of the U.S. economy and defines
industries in accordance with the composition and structure of the economy. An organiza-
tion’s SIC consists of a two-digit major group number, a three-digit industry group number,
and a four-digit industry number. These numbers describe the business’s identifiable level of
industrial detail.
Determining a company’s SIC is a good starting point in researching a company,
an industry, or a product. Many library sources use the SIC number as a method of
classification.

The U.S. Department of Labor provides a Web site that details the SIC manual and pro-
vides for searching via key words. The Web site is http://www.osha.gov/oshstats/sicser.html.
If you Google “Standard Industrial Classification” (SIC), this Web site will likely be the first
one up.
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) was created jointly by the
United States, Canada, and Mexico. It is to replace the existing classification of each coun-
try: the Standard Industrial Classification of Canada (1980), the Mexican Classification of
Activities and Products (1994), and the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) of the United
States (1987).
For the NAICS, economic units with similar production processes are classified in the
same industry, and the lines drawn between industries demarcate differences in production
processes. This supply-based economic concept was adopted because an industry classifica-
tion system is a framework for collecting information on both inputs and outputs. This will
aid in the collection of statistics on such things as productivity, unit labor costs, and capital
intensity.
NAICS provides enhanced industry comparability among the three NAFTA trading
partners. It also increases compatibility with the two-digit level of the International Standard
Industrial Classification (ISIC Rev. 3) of the United Nations.
NAICS divides the economy into 20 sectors. Industries within these sectors are grouped
according to the production criterion. Four sectors are largely goods-producing, and 16 are
entirely services-producing industries.
In most sectors, NAICS provides for compatibility at the industry (five-digit) level. For
some sectors, the compatibility level is less at four-digit, three-digit, or two-digit levels. Each
country can add additional detailed industries, provided the additional detail aggregates to
the NAICS level.
The United States adopted the NAICS in 1997 for statistical agencies. Most of the U.S.
government agencies now use the NAICS in place of the Standard Industrial Classification.
A major exception is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Companies reporting
to the SEC include their SIC. For private companies that publish industry data, some
now only use the NAICS, others use the SIC, and still others include both the NAICS and
the SIC.
The U.S. Census Bureau provides a Web site that details the NAICS manual and pro-
vides for searching via key words. To get to this site, open www.census.gov and under “busi-
ness and industry” click on NAICS. If you Google “North American Industry Classification
System” (NAICS), this Web site will likely be the first one up.
Industry Averages and Comparison with Competitors
The analysis of an entity’s financial statements is more meaningful if the results are com-
pared with industry averages and with results of competitors. Several financial services pro-
vide composite data on various industries.
The analyst faces a problem when the industries reported do not clearly include the com-
pany being examined because the company is diversified into many industrial areas. Since
many companies do not clearly fit into any one industry, it is often necessary to use an indus-
try that best fits the firm. The financial services have a similar problem in selecting an indus-
try in which to place a company. Thus, a financial service uses its best judgment as to which
industry the firm best fits.
This section briefly describes some financial services. For a more extensive explanation,
consult the service’s literature. Each service explains how it computes its ratios and the data
it provides.
The Department of Commerce Financial Report is a publication of the federal govern-
ment for manufacturing, mining, and trade corporations. Published by the Economic Surveys
Division of the Bureau of the Census, it includes income statement data and balance sheet
data in total industry dollars. It also includes an industry-wide common-size vertical income
statement (Income Statement in Ratio Format) and an industry-wide common-size vertical

balance sheet (Selected Balance Sheet Ratios). This source also includes selected operating
and balance sheet ratios. This government publication uses NAICS for classification.
This report, updated quarterly, probably offers the most current source. It typically
becomes available within three to four months after the end of the quarter. It is a unique
source of industry data in total dollars and would enable a company to compare its dollars
(such as sales) with the industry dollars (sales). This service is free and is now on the Internet
at www.census.gov/econ/qfr.
Annual Statement Studies is published by the Risk Management Association, the associ-
ation of lending and credit risk professionals. Submitted by institutional members of the Risk
Management Association, the data cover several hundred different industries in manufactur-
ing, wholesaling, retailing, service, agriculture, and construction.
Annual Statement Studies groups the data by industry, using the SIC number, and the
NAICS number. It provides common-size balance sheets, income statements, and 16 selected
ratios.
The data are sorted by assets and sales and are particularly useful because the financial
position and operations of small firms are often quite different from those of larger firms.
The presentation also includes a five-year comparison of historical data that presents all
firms under a particular NAICS or SIC code.
In each category, the ratios are computed for the median and the upper and lower quar-
tiles. For example:
Number of firms (9)
Ratio—Return on total assets
Results for the nine firms (in order, from highest to lowest):
12%, 11%, 10.5%, 10%, 9.8%, 9.7%, 9.6%, 7.0%, 6.5%
The middle result is the median: 9.8%.
The result halfway between the top result and the median is the upper quartile: 10.5%.
The result halfway between the bottom result and the median is the lower quartile: 9.6%.
For ratios in which a low value is desirable, the results are presented from low values to
high—for example, 2% (upper quartile), 5% (median), and 8% (lower quartile). For ratios
in which a high value is desirable, the results are presented from high values to low—for
example, 10.5% (upper quartile), 9.8% (median), and 9.6% (lower quartile).
Because of the combination of common-size statements, selected ratios, and comparative
historical data, Annual Statement Studies is one of the most extensively used sources of
industry data. Commercial loan officers in banks frequently use this source.
Annual Statement Studies® now contains an industry Z score which indicates the poten-
tial for a company to fail compared with the industry. A review of the Z score concept is in
Chapter 11 of this text.
Annual Statement Studies® is available in two books; 1) RMA Annual Statement
Studies®, and 2) Valu Source’s RMA Annual Statement Studies® Valuation Edition.
Valu Source’s RMA Annual Statement Studies® Valuation Edition has the same data
contained in RMA Annual Statement Studies® plus additional data such as enhanced finan-
cial ratios.
Standard & Poor’s Industry Surveys contains information of particular interest to
investors. This includes a write-up by industry, statistics for companies in an industry, and
specific company by industry. Each industry report includes the current environments, indus-
try trends, key industry ratios, and additional industry information.
Almanac of Business and Industrial Financial Ratios, published by CCH Incorporated,
is a compilation of corporate tax return data. It includes nearly 200 industries and presents
50 statistics for 13 size categories of firms. Some of the industries include manufacturing,
construction, transportation, retail trade, banking, and wholesale trade.
Beginning with the 2002 edition, each Almanac industry is cross-referenced to a NAICS
number. The IRS’s condensed NAICS represents the classification system used in the Almanac.
Industry Norms and Key Business Ratios, desktop edition published by Dun & Brad-
street, includes over 800 different lines of business as defined by the SIC code numbers. It

includes one-year data consisting of a condensed balance sheet and an income statement in
dollars and common size. It also includes working capital and ratios.
There are 14 ratios presented for the upper quartile, median, and lower quartile. The 14
ratios are as follows:
Solvency
Quick Ratio (Times)
Current Ratio (Times)
Current Liabilities to Net Worth (%)
Current Liabilities to Inventory (%)
Total Liabilities to Net Worth (%)
Fixed Assets to Net Worth (%)
Efficiency

Dun & Bradstreet advises that the industry norms and key business ratios are to be used
as yardsticks and not as absolutes.
Value Line Investment Survey is in two editions; the Standard Edition and the Small &
Mid-Cap Edition. The Standard Edition places companies in 1 of 97 industries. The Small &
Mid-Cap Edition places companies in 1 of 84 industries. There are approximately 1,700
stocks in the Standard Edition and approximately 1,800 stocks in the Small & Mid-Cap Edi-
tion. The Value Line Investment Survey is very popular with investors.
The full-page Ratings & Reports are similar for the Standard Edition and the Small &
Mid-Cap Edition. Each stock is rated for timeliness, safety, and technical. The Standard Edi-
tion includes an analyst’s comments, while the Small & Mid-Cap Edition does not include
an analyst’s comments.
The data included in Value Line for a company are largely for a relatively long period of
time (11 to 17 years). The data provided vary somewhat by industry. Some of the data pro-
vided for many companies are as follows:
1. Revenues per share
2. Cash flow per share
3. Earnings per share
4. Dividends declared per share
5. Capital spending per share
6. Book value per share
7. Common shares outstanding
8. Average annual P/E ratio

As indicated previously, comparison has become more difficult in recent years as more
firms become conglomerates and diversify into many product lines. To counteract this prob-
lem, the SEC has implemented line-of-business reporting requirements for companies that
must submit their reports to the SEC. These reports are made available to the public. SFAS
No. 14 also addresses line-of-business reporting requirements. Such reporting requirements
ease the analysis problem created by conglomerates but cannot eliminate it because the entity
must decide how to allocate administrative and joint costs.
If industry figures are unavailable or if comparison with a competitor is desired, another
firm’s statements may be analyzed. Remember, however, that the other firm is not necessar-
ily good or bad, nor does it represent a norm or standard for its industry. It also can be said
that industry figures do not necessarily represent good or bad, nor do they represent a stand-
ard for its industry.
Alternative accounting methods are acceptable in many situations. Since identical com-
panies may use different valuation or expense methods, it is important to read statements
and notes carefully to determine whether the statements are reasonably comparable.
Ideally, the use of all types of comparison would be best. Using trend analysis, industry
averages, and comparisons with a major competitor will give support to findings and will
provide a concrete basis for analysis.
In analyzing ratios, the analyst will sometimes encounter negative profit figures. Analysis
of ratios that have negative numerators or denominators is meaningless, and the negative
sign of the ratio should simply be noted.
Caution in Using Industry Averages
Financial analysis requires judgment decisions on the part of the analyst. Users of financial
statements must be careful not to place undue confidence in ratios or comparisons.
Remember that ratios are simply fractions with a numerator (top) and a denominator
(bottom). There are as many ratios for financial analysis as there are pairs of figures. There
is no set group, nor is a particular ratio always computed using the same figures. Even the
industry ratio formulas vary from source to source. Adequate detailed disclosure of how the
industry ratios are computed is often lacking. Major problems can result from analyzing a
firm according to the recommendations of a book and then making comparisons to industry
ratios that may have been computed differently.
The use of different accounting methods causes a problem. For example, identical firms
may use different valuation or revenue recognition methods. Read statements and notes care-
fully to determine the degree of comparability between statements. Trend analysis for each
firm, however, will usually be meaningful. Industry averages group firms together that use
different accounting principles.
Different year-ends can also produce different results. Consider the difference in the in-
ventory of two toy stores if one ends November 30 and the other ends December 31. The
ratios of firms with differing year-ends are all grouped together in industry averages.
Firms with differing financial policies might be included in the same industry average. Possibly
capital-intensive firms are grouped with labor-intensive companies. Firms with large amounts of
debt may be included in the same average as firms that prefer to avoid the risk of debt.
Some industry averages come from small samples that may not be representative of the indus-
try. An extreme statement, such as one containing a large loss, can also distort industry data.

Ratios may have alternative forms of computation. In comparing one year to the next,
one firm to another, or a company to its industry, meaningful analysis requires that the
ratios be computed using the same formula. For example, Annual Statement Studies com-
putes income ratios before tax; Dun & Bradstreet profit figures are after tax. The analyst
should compute the enterprise ratios on the same basis as is used for industry comparisons,
but this is often not possible.
Finally, ratios are not absolute norms. They are general guidelines to be combined with
other methods in formulating an evaluation of the financial condition of a firm. Despite the
problems with using ratios, they can be very informative if reasonably used.
Relative Size of Firm
Comparisons of firms of different sizes may be more difficult than comparisons of firms of
equal size. For example, larger firms often have access to wider and more sophisticated capi-
tal markets, can buy in large quantities, and service wider markets. Ratios and common-size
analysis help to eliminate some of the problems related to the use of absolute numbers.
Be aware of the different sizes of firms under comparison. These differences can be seen
by looking at relative sales, assets, or profit sizes. Investment services such as Value Line
often make available another meaningful figure—percent of market.

The Users of Financial Statements
The financial statements are prepared for a group of diversified users. Users of financial data
have their own objectives in analysis.
Management, an obvious user of financial data, must analyze the data from the view-
points of both investors and creditors. Management must be concerned about the current posi-
tion of the entity to meet its obligations, as well as the future earning prospects of the firm.
Management is interested in the financial structure of the entity in order to determine a proper
mix of short-term debt, long-term debt, and equity from owners. Also of interest is the asset struc-
ture of the entity: the combination of cash, inventory, receivables, investments, and fixed assets.
Management must guide the entity toward sound short- and long-term financial policies
and also earn a profit. For example, liquidity and profitability are competitive since the most
highly liquid assets (cash and marketable securities) are usually the least profitable. It does
the entity little good to be guided toward a maximum profitability goal if resources are not
available to meet current obligations. The entity would soon find itself in bankruptcy as

creditors cut off lines of credit and demand payment. Similarly, management must utilize
resources properly to obtain a reasonable return.
The investing public, another category of users, is interested in specific types of analysis.
Investors are concerned with the financial position of the entity and its ability to earn future
profits. The investor uses an analysis of past trends and the current position of the entity to
project the future prospects of the entity.
Credit grantors are interested in the financial statements of the entity. Pure credit gran-
tors obtain a limited return from extending credit: a fixed rate of interest (as in the case of
banks) or the profit on the merchandise or services provided (as in the case of suppliers).
Since these rewards are limited and the possibility exists that the principal will not be repaid,
credit grantors tend to be conservative in extending credit.
The same principle applies to suppliers that extend credit. If merchandise with a 20%
markup is sold on credit, it takes five successful sales of the same amount to make up for
one sale not collected. In addition, the creditor considers the cost of the funds when extend-
ing credit. Extending credit really amounts to financing the entity.
A difference exists between the objectives of short-term grantors of credit and those of
long-term grantors. The short-term creditor can look primarily to current resources that
appear on the financial statements in order to determine if credit should be extended. Long-
term creditors must usually look to the future prospects of earnings in order to be repaid.
For example, if bonds are issued that are to be repaid in 30 years, the current resources of
the entity will not be an indication of its ability to meet this obligation. The repayment for
this obligation will come from future earnings. Thus, the objectives of financial analysis by
credit grantors will vary, based on such factors as the term of the credit and the purpose.
Profitability of the entity may not be a major consideration, as long as the resources for
repayment can be projected.
The financial structure of the entity is of interest to creditors because the amount of eq-
uity capital in relation to debt indicates the risk that the owners bear in relation to the cred-
itors. The equity capital provides creditors with a cushion against loss. When this equity
cushion is small, creditors are bearing the risk of the entity.
Many other parties are interested in analyzing financial statements. Unions that repre-
sent employees are interested in the ability of the entity to grant wage increases and fringe
benefits, such as pension plans. The government also has an interest in analyzing financial
statements for tax purposes and for ensuring compliance with antitrust laws.
Summary
Financial analysis consists of the quantitative and qualitative
aspects of measuring the relative financial position among
firms and industries. Analysis can be done in different ways,
depending on the type of firm or industry and the specific
needs of the user. Financial statements will vary by size of
firm and among industries.
The
SIC
and
NAICS
classification
systems
have
been
developed
to
promote
comparability
of
firms.
Determining a company’s SIC and/or NAICS is a good
starting point in researching a company, an industry, or a
product.
The analysis of an entity’s financial statements is more
meaningful if the results are compared with industry aver-
ages and with results of competitors. At the same time,
caution must be exercised in using industry averages and
results of competitors.
Many library services are available that relate to indi-
vidual companies, industries, and products. These sources
can be a valuable aid in researching a firm.
Financial statements are prepared for a group of diver-
sified users. These users have various needs and uses for
the financial statements.

Liquidity of Short-Term
Assets; Related Debt-Paying
Ability
A
n entity’s ability to maintain its short-term debt-paying ability is important to all users
of financial statements. If the entity cannot maintain a short-term debt-paying ability,
it will not be able to maintain a long-term debt-paying ability, nor will it be able to
satisfy its stockholders. Even a very profitable entity will find itself bankrupt if it fails to meet
its obligations to short-term creditors. The ability to pay current obligations when due is also
related to the cash-generating ability of the firm. This topic will be discussed in Chapter 10.
When analyzing the short-term debt-paying ability of the firm, we find a close relation-
ship between the current assets and the current liabilities. Generally, the current liabilities
will be paid with cash generated from the current assets. As previously indicated, the profit-
ability of the firm does not determine the short-term debt-paying ability. In other words,
using accrual accounting, the entity may report very high profits but may not have the ability
to pay its current bills because it lacks available funds. If the entity reports a loss, it may still
be able to pay short-term obligations.
This chapter suggests procedures for analyzing short-term assets and the short-term
debt-paying ability of an entity. The procedures require an understanding of current assets,
current liabilities, and the notes to financial statements.
This chapter also includes a detailed discussion of four very important assets—cash,
marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inventory. Accounts receivable and inven-
tory, two critical assets, often substantially influence the liquidity and profitability of a firm.
Chapters 6 through 10 will extensively use the 2011 financial statements of Nike, Inc.
(Nike) to illustrate the technique of financial analysis. This will aid readers in viewing
financial analysis as a whole. Nike, Inc.’s 2011 financial statements are presented following
Chapter 10. With the Nike statements is an analysis that summarizes and expands on the
Nike analysis in Chapters 6 through 10.
Current Assets, Current Liabilities, and the Operating Cycle
Current assets (1) are in the form of cash, (2) will be realized in cash, or (3) conserve the use
of cash within the operating cycle of a business or one year, whichever is longer.1

The five categories of assets usually found in current assets, listed in their order of liquid-
ity, include cash, marketable securities, receivables, inventories, and prepayments. Other
assets may also be classified in current assets, such as assets held for sale. This chapter will
examine in detail each type of current asset.
The operating cycle for a company is the time period between the acquisition of goods and
the final cash realization resulting from sales and subsequent collections. For example, a food
store purchases inventory and then sells the inventory for cash. The relatively short time that the
inventory remains an asset of the food store represents a very short operating cycle. In another
example, a car manufacturer purchases materials and then uses labor and overhead to convert
these materials into a finished car. A dealer buys the car on credit and then pays the manufac-
turer. Compared to the food store, the car manufacturer has a much longer operating cycle, but
it is still less than a year. Only a few businesses have an operating cycle longer than a year. For
example, if a business is involved in selling resort property, the average time period that the
property is held before sale, plus the average collection period, is typically longer than a year.
Cash
Cash is a medium of exchange that a bank will accept for deposit and a creditor will accept
for payment. To be classified as a current asset, cash must be free from any restrictions that
would prevent its deposit or use it to pay creditors classified as current. If restricted for spe-
cific short-term creditors, many firms still classify this cash under current assets, but they dis-
close the restrictions. Cash restricted for short-term creditors should be eliminated along
with the related amount of short-term debt when determining the short-term debt-paying
ability. Cash should be available to pay general short-term creditors to be considered as part
of the firm’s short-term debt-paying ability.
It has become common for banks to require a portion of any loan to remain on deposit
in the bank for the duration of the loan period. These deposits, termed compensating
balances, reduce the amount of cash available to the borrower to meet obligations, and they
increase the borrower’s effective interest rate.
Compensating balances against short-term borrowings are separately stated in the cur-
rent asset section or notes. Compensating balances for long-term borrowings are separately
stated as noncurrent assets under either investments or other assets.
The cash account on the balance sheet is usually entitled cash, cash and equivalents, or
cash and certificates of deposit. The cash classification typically includes currency and unre-
stricted funds on deposit with a bank.
Two major problems are encountered when analyzing a current asset: determining a fair
valuation for the asset and determining the liquidity of the asset. These problems apply to the
cash asset only when it has been restricted. Thus, it is usually a simple matter to decide on the
amount of cash to use when determining the short-term debt-paying ability of an entity.
Marketable Securities
The business entity has varying cash needs throughout the year. Because an inferred cost
arises from keeping money available, management does not want to keep all of the entity’s
cash needs in the form of cash throughout the year. The available alternative turns some of
the cash into productive use through short-term investments (marketable securities), which
can be converted into cash as the need arises.
To qualify as a marketable security, the investment must be readily marketable, and it
must be the intent of management to convert the investment to cash within the current oper-
ating cycle or one year, whichever is longer. The key element of this test is managerial intent.
It is to management’s advantage to show investments under marketable securities,
instead of long-term investments, because this classification improves the liquidity appear-
ance of the firm. When the same securities are carried as marketable securities year after
year, they are likely held for a business purpose. For example, the other company may be a
major supplier or customer of the firm being analyzed. The firm would not want to sell these
securities to pay short-term creditors. Therefore, to be conservative, it is better to reclassify
them as investments for analysis purposes.
Investments classified as marketable securities should be temporary. Examples of mar-
ketable securities include treasury bills, short-term notes of corporations, government bonds,

corporate bonds, preferred stock, and common stock. Investments in preferred stock and
common stock are referred to as marketable equity securities.
Debt and equity securities are to be carried at fair value. An exception is that debt secur-
ities can be carried at amortized cost if classified as held-to-maturity securities, but these debt
securities would be classified under investments (not classified under current assets).2
A security’s liquidity must be determined in order for it to be classified as a marketable
security. The analyst must assume that securities classified as marketable securities are read-
ily marketable.

Short-term Investments
Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S.
Treasury, U.S. agency, and corporate debt securities, with maturities over three months from the
date of purchase. Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to
maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not hold
any short-term investments that were classified as held-to-maturity.
At May 31, 2011 and 2010, short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities.
Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported,
net of tax, in other comprehensive income, unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than
temporary. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity
dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore
classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current
assets within short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet.

Receivables
An entity usually has a number of claims to future inflows of cash. These claims are usually
classified as accounts receivable and notes receivable on the financial statements. The pri-
mary claim that most entities have comes from the selling of merchandise or services on
account to customers, referred to as trade receivables, with the customer promising to pay
within a limited period of time, such as 30 days. Other claims may be from sources such as
loans to employees or a federal tax refund.
Claims from customers, usually in the form of accounts receivable, neither bear interest
nor involve claims against specific resources of the customer. In some cases, however, the
customer signs a note instead of being granted the privilege of having an open account. Usu-
ally, the interest-bearing note will be for a longer period of time than an account receivable.
In some cases, a customer who does not pay an account receivable when due signs a note re-
ceivable in place of the account receivable.
The common characteristic of receivables is that the company expects to receive cash
some time in the future. This causes two valuation problems. First, a period of time must
pass before the receivable can be collected, so the entity incurs costs for the use of these
funds. Second, collection might not be made.
The valuation problem from waiting to collect is ignored in the valuation of receivables and
of notes classified as current assets because of the short waiting period and the immaterial differ-
ence in value. The waiting period problem is not ignored if the receivable or note is long term and
classified as an investment. The stipulated rate of interest is presumed to be fair, except when:
1. No interest is stated.
2. The stated rate of interest is clearly unreasonable.
3. The face value of the note is materially different from the cash sales price of the
property, goods, or services, or the market value of the note at the date of the
transaction.3
Under the condition that the face amount of the note does not represent the fair value of
the consideration exchanged, the note is recorded as a present value amount on the date of
the original transaction. The note is recorded at less than (or more than) the face amount,
taking into consideration the time value of money. The difference between the recorded
amount and the face amount is subsequently amortized as interest income (note receivable)
or as interest expense (note payable).
The second problem in valuing receivables or notes is that collection may not be made.
Usually, an allowance provides for estimated uncollectible accounts. Estimated losses must
be accrued against income, and the impairment of the asset must be recognized (or liability
recorded) under the following conditions:
1. Information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is
probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred at the date of
the financial statements.
2. The amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.4
Both of these conditions are normally met with respect to the uncollectibility of receiv-
ables, and the amount subject to being uncollectible is usually material. Thus, in most cases,
the company must estimate bad debt expense and indicate the impairment of the receivable.
The expense is placed on the income statement, and the impairment of the receivable is dis-
closed by the use of an account, allowance for doubtful accounts, which is subtracted from
the gross receivable account. Later, a specific customer’s account, identified as being uncol-
lectible, is charged against allowance for doubtful accounts and the gross receivable account
on the balance sheet. (This does not mean that the firm will stop efforts to collect.)
It is difficult for the firm to estimate the collectibility of any individual receivable, but
when it considers all of the receivables in setting up the allowance, the total estimate should
be reasonably accurate. The problem of collection applies to each type of receivable, includ-
ing notes. The company normally provides for only one allowance account as a matter of
convenience, but it considers possible collection problems with all types of receivables and
notes when determining the allowance account.

The impairment of receivables may come from causes other than uncollectibility, such as
cash discounts allowed, sales returns, and allowances given. Usually, the company considers
all of the causes that impair receivables in allowance for doubtful accounts, rather than set-
ting up a separate allowance account for each cause.
Nike presented its receivable account for May 31, 2011 and 2010, as follows:
2011
2010
Accounts receivable, net
$3,138,000,000
$2,650,000,000
This indicates that net receivables were $3,138,000,000 at May 31, 2011 and
$2,650,000,000 at May 31, 2010, after subtracting allowances for doubtful accounts.

Notes to Consolidated Balance Statements (In Part)
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (In Part)
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts receivable from customers. We make
ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain an
allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make
required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical
level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant custom-
ers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection
dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are con-
sidered non-current and recorded in other assets. The allowance for uncollectible accounts
receivable was $124 million and $117 million at May 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of
which $50 million and $43 million was classified as long-term and recorded in other assets.
Using this note, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable presented with
accounts receivable, net can be computed as follows:
2011
2010
Total allowance for uncollectible accounts
$124,000,000
$117,000,000
Less: Recorded in other assets
50,000,000
43,000,000
Presented with accounts receivable
$ 74,000,000
$ 74,000,000
The use of the allowance for doubtful accounts approach results in the bad debt expense
being charged to the period of sale, thus matching this expense with its related revenue. It
also results in recognition of the impairment of the asset. The later charge-off of a specified
account receivable does not influence the income statement or net receivables on the balance
sheet. The charge-off reduces accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts.
When both conditions specified are not met, or the receivables are immaterial, the entity
recognizes bad debt expense using the direct write-off method. With this method, bad debt
expense is recognized when a specific customer’s account is identified as being uncollectible.
At this time, the bad debt expense is recognized on the income statement, and gross accounts
receivable is decreased on the balance sheet. This method recognizes the bad debt expense in
the same period for both the income statement and the tax return.
The direct write-off method frequently results in the bad debt expense being recognized
in the year subsequent to the sale, and thus does not result in a proper matching of expense
with revenue. This method reports gross receivables, which does not recognize the impair-
ment of the asset from uncollectibility.
Some companies have trade receivables and installment receivables. Installment receiv-
ables will usually be for a relatively long period of time. Installment receivables due within a
year are classified under current assets. Installment receivables due after a year are classified
below current assets.
Installment receivables classified under current assets are normally much longer than the
typical trade receivables. The analyst should make special note of this when making compar-
isons with competitors. For example, a retail company that has substantial installment
receivables is not comparable to a retail company that does not have installment receivables.

Installment receivables are usually considered to be of lower quality than other receivables
because of the length of time needed to collect the installment receivables. More importantly,
the company with installment receivables should have high standards when granting credit
and should closely monitor its receivables.
Exhibit 6-2 indicates the disclosure by CA, Inc., and Subsidiaries.
Customer concentration can be an important consideration in the quality of receivables.
When a large portion of receivables is from a few customers, the firm can be highly depend-
ent on those customers. Nike’s Form 10-K disclosed that “no customer accounted for 10%
or more of our net sales during fiscal 2011.”
The liquidity of the trade receivables for a company can be examined by making two
computations. The first computation determines the number of days’ sales in receivables at
the end of the accounting period, and the second computation determines the accounts re-
ceivable turnover. The turnover figure can be computed to show the number of times per
year receivables turn over or to show how many days on the average it takes to collect the
receivables.
Days’ Sales in Receivables
The number of days’ sales in receivables relates the amount of the accounts receivable to the
average daily sales on account. For this computation, the accounts receivable amount should
include trade notes receivable. Other receivables not related to sales on account should not
be included in this computation. Compute the days’ sales in receivables as follows:
Days’ Sales in Receivables ¼ Gross Receivables
Net Sales=365

This formula divides the number of days in a year into net sales on account and then
divides the resulting figure into gross receivables. Exhibit 6-3 presents this computation for
Nike at the end of 2011 and 2010. The increase in days’ sales in receivables from 52.29 days
at the end of 2010 to 56.19 days at the end of 2011 indicates a negative trend in the control
of receivables.
An internal analyst compares days’ sales in receivables with the company’s credit terms as
an indication of how efficiently the company manages its receivables. For example, if the credit
term is 30 days, days’ sales in receivables should not be materially over 30 days. If days’ sales
in receivables are materially more than the credit terms, the company has a collection problem.
An effort should be made to keep the days’ sales in receivables close to the credit terms.
Consider the effect on the quality of receivables from a change in the credit terms. Short-
ening the credit terms indicates that there will be less risk in the collection of future receiv-
ables, and lengthening the credit terms indicates a greater risk. Credit term information is
readily available for internal analysis and may be available in notes.
Right of return privileges can also be important to the quality of receivables. Liberal
right of return privileges can be a negative factor in the quality of receivables and on sales
that have already been recorded. Particular attention should be paid to any change in the
right of return privileges. Right of return privileges can readily be determined for internal
analysis, and this information should be available in a note if considered to be material.
The net sales figure includes collectible and uncollectible accounts. The uncollectible
accounts would not exist if there were an accurate way, prior to sale, of determining which
credit customers would not pay. Firms make an effort to determine credit standing when
they approve a customer for credit, but this process does not eliminate uncollectible
accounts. Since the net sales figure includes both collectible and uncollectible accounts (gross
sales), the comparable receivables figure should include gross receivables, rather than the net
receivables figure that remains after the allowance for doubtful accounts is deducted.
The days’ sales in receivables indicates the length of time that the receivables have been
outstanding at the end of the year. The indication can be misleading if sales are seasonal and/
or the company uses a natural business year. If the company uses a natural business year for
its accounting period, the days’ sales in receivables will tend to be understated because the
actual sales per day at the end of the year will be low when compared to the average sales per
day for the year. The understatement of days’ sales in receivables can also be explained by the
fact that gross receivables will tend to be below average at that time of year.
The following is an example of how days’ sales in receivables will tend to be understated
when a company uses a natural business year:

$100,000

¼ 100 days
The liquidity of a company that uses a natural business year tends to be overstated.
However, the only positive way to know if a company uses a natural business year is
through research. The information may not be readily available.
It is unlikely that a company that has a seasonal business will close the accounting year
during peak activity. At the peak of the business cycle, company personnel are busy and
receivables are likely to be at their highest levels. If a company closed during peak activity,
the days’ sales in receivables would tend to be overstated and the liquidity understated.
The length of time that the receivables have been outstanding indicates their collectibil-
ity. The days’ sales in receivables should be compared for several years. A comparison
should also be made between the days’ sales in receivables for a particular company and
comparable figures for other firms in the industry and industry averages. This type of com-
parison can be made when doing either internal or external analysis.
Assuming that the days’ sales in receivables computation is not distorted because of a
seasonal business and/or the company’s use of a natural business year, consider the follow-
ing reasons to explain why the days’ sales in receivables appears to be abnormally high:
1. Sales volume expands materially late in the year.
2. Receivables are uncollectible and should have been written off.
3. The company seasonally dates invoices. (An example would be a toy manufacturer that
ships in August with the receivable due at the end of December.)
4. A large portion of receivables are on the installment basis.
Assuming that the distortion is not from a seasonal situation or the company’s use of a
natural business year, the following should be considered as possible reasons why the days’
sales in receivables appears to be abnormally low:
1. Sales volume decreases materially late in the year.
2. A material amount of sales are on a cash basis.
3. The company has a factoring arrangement in which a material amount of the receivables
is sold. (With a factoring arrangement, the receivables are sold to an outside party.)
When doing external analysis, many of the reasons why the days’ sales in receivables is
abnormally high or low cannot be determined without access to internal information.
Accounts Receivable Turnover
Another computation, accounts receivable turnover, indicates the liquidity of the receivables.
Compute the accounts receivable turnover measured in times per year as follows:
Accounts Receivable Turnover ¼
Net Sales
Average Gross Receivables
Exhibit 6-4 presents this computation for Nike at the end of 2011 and 2010. The turn-
over of receivables increased between 2010 and 2011 from 6.69 times per year to 7.03 times
per year. For Nike, this would be a positive trend.
Computing the average gross receivables based on beginning-of-year and end-of-year
receivables can be misleading if the business has seasonal fluctuations or if the company uses
a natural business year. To avoid problems of seasonal fluctuations or of comparing a com-
pany that uses a natural business year with one that uses a calendar year, the monthly balan-
ces (or even weekly balances) of accounts receivable should be used in the computation. This
is feasible when performing internal analysis, but not when performing external analysis. In

the case of external analysis, quarterly figures can be used to help eliminate these problems.
If these problems cannot be eliminated, companies not on the same basis should not be com-
pared. The company with the natural business year tends to overstate its accounts receivable
turnover, thus overstating its liquidity.
Accounts Receivable Turnover in Days
The accounts receivable turnover can be expressed in terms of days instead of times per year.
Turnover in number of days also gives a comparison with the number of days’ sales in the end-
ing receivables. The accounts receivable turnover in days also results in an answer directly
related to the firm’s credit terms. Compute the accounts receivable turnover in days as follows:
Accounts Receivable Turnover in Days ¼ Average Gross Receivables
Net Sales=365
This formula is the same as that for determining number of days’ sales in receivables,
except that the accounts receivable turnover in days is computed using the average gross
receivables. Exhibit 6-5 presents the computation for Nike at the end of 2011 and 2010.
Accounts receivable turnover in days decreased from 54.54 days in 2010 to 51.92 days in
2011. This would represent a positive trend.
The accounts receivable turnover in times per year and days can both be computed by
alternative formulas, using Nike’s 2011 figures, as follows:
1. Accounts Receivable Turnover in Times per Year
365
Accounts Receivable
Turnover in Days
¼ 365
51:92
¼ 7:03 Times per Year
2. Accounts Receivable Turnover in Days
365
Accounts Receivable
Times per Year
¼ 365
7:03
¼ 51:92 Days per Year
The answers obtained for both accounts receivable turnover in number of times per year
and accounts receivable turnover in days, using the alternative formulas, may differ slightly
from the answers obtained with the previous formulas. The difference is due to rounding.

Credit Sales versus Cash Sales
A difficulty in computing receivables’ liquidity is the problem of credit sales versus cash
sales. Net sales includes both credit sales and cash sales. To have a realistic indication of the
liquidity of receivables, only the credit sales should be included in the computations. If cash
sales are included, the liquidity will be overstated.
The internal analyst determines the credit sales figure and eliminates the problem of
credit sales versus cash sales. The external analyst should be aware of this problem and
should not be misled by the liquidity figures. The distinction between cash sales and credit
sales is not usually a major problem for the external analyst because certain types of busi-
nesses tend to sell only on cash terms, and others sell only on credit terms. For example, a
manufacturer usually sells only on credit terms. Some businesses, such as a retail department
store, have a mixture of credit sales and cash sales.
In cases of mixed sales, the proportion of credit and cash sales tends to stay rather con-
stant. Therefore, the liquidity figures are comparable (but overstated), enabling the reader to
compare figures from period to period as well as figures of similar companies.
Inventories
Inventory is often the most significant asset in determining the short-term debt-paying ability
of an entity. Often, the inventory account is more than half of the total current assets.
Because of the significance of inventories, a special effort should be made to analyze properly
this important area.
To be classified as inventory, the asset should be for sale in the ordinary course of busi-
ness, or used or consumed in the production of goods. A trading concern purchases mer-
chandise in a form to sell to customers. Inventories of a trading concern, whether wholesale
or retail, usually appear in one inventory account (Merchandise Inventory). A manufacturing
concern produces goods to be sold. Inventories of a manufacturing concern are normally
classified in three distinct inventory accounts: inventory available to use in production (raw
materials inventory), inventory in production (work-in-process inventory), and inventory
completed (finished goods inventory).
Usually, it is much more difficult to determine the inventory figures in a manufacturing
concern than in a trading concern. The manufacturing concern deals with materials, labor,
and overhead when determining the inventory figures, while the trading concern only deals
with purchased merchandise. The overhead portion of the work-in-process inventory and
the finished goods inventory is often a problem when determining a manufacturer’s inven-
tory. The overhead consists of all the costs of the factory other than direct materials and
direct labor. From an analysis viewpoint, however, many of the problems of determining the
proper inventory value are solved before the entity publishes financial statements.
Inventory is particularly sensitive to changes in business activity, so management must
keep inventory in balance with business activity. Failure to do so leads to excessive costs
(such as storage cost), production disruptions, and employee layoffs. For example, it is diffi-
cult for automobile manufacturers to balance inventories with business activities. When sales
decline rapidly, the industry has difficulty adjusting production and the resulting inventory
to match the decline. Manufacturers have to use customer incentives, such as price rebates,

to get the large inventory buildup back to a manageable level. When business activity
increases, inventory shortages can lead to overtime costs. The increase in activity can also
lead to cash shortages because of the length of time necessary to acquire inventory, sell the
merchandise, and collect receivables.
Inventory quantities and costs may be accounted for using either the perpetual or
periodic system. Using the perpetual system, the company maintains a continuous record of
physical quantities in its inventory. When the perpetual system includes costs (versus quanti-
ties only), then the company updates its inventory and cost of goods sold continually as pur-
chases and sales take place. (The inventory needs to be verified by a physical count at least
once a year.)
Using the periodic system, physical counts are taken periodically, which should be at
least once a year. The cost of the ending inventory is determined by attaching costs to the
physical quantities on hand based on the cost flow assumption used. The cost of goods
sold is calculated by subtracting the ending inventory from the cost of goods available
for sale.
Inventory Cost
The most critical problem that many entities face is determining which cost to use, since the
cost prices have usually varied over time. If it were practical to determine the specific cost of
an item, this would be a good cost figure to use. It would also substantially reduce inventory
valuation problems. In practice, because of the different types of inventory items and the
constant flow of these items, it is not practical to determine the specific costs. Exceptions to
this are large items and/or expensive items. For example, it would be practical to determine
the specific cost of a new car in the dealer’s showroom or the specific cost of an expensive
diamond in a jewelry store. When specific costs are used, this is referred to as the specific
identification method.
Because the cost of specific items is not usually practical to determine and because other
things are considered (such as the income result), companies typically use a cost flow
assumption. The most common cost flow assumptions are first-in, first-out (FIFO), last-in,
first-out (LIFO), or some average computation. These assumptions can produce substantially
different results because of changing prices.
The FIFO method assumes that the first inventory acquired is the first sold. This means
that the cost of goods sold account consists of beginning inventory and the earliest items pur-
chased. The latest items purchased remain in inventory. These latest costs are fairly represen-
tative of the current costs to replace the inventory. If the inventory flows slowly (low
turnover), or if there has been substantial inflation, even FIFO may not produce an inventory
figure for the balance sheet representative of the replacement cost. Part of the inventory cost
of a manufacturing concern consists of overhead, some of which may represent costs from
several years prior, such as depreciation on the plant and equipment. Often, the costs trans-
ferred to cost of goods sold under FIFO are low in relation to current costs, so current costs
are not matched against current revenue. During a time of inflation, the resulting profit is
overstated. To the extent that inventory does not represent replacement cost, an understate-
ment of the inventory cost occurs.
The LIFO method assumes that the costs of the latest items bought or produced are
matched against current sales. Usually, this assumption materially improves the matching of
current costs against current revenue, so the resulting profit figure is fairly realistic. The first
items (and oldest costs) in inventory can materially distort the reported inventory figure in
comparison with its replacement cost. A firm that has been on LIFO for many years may
have some inventory costs that go back 20 years or more. Because of inflation, the resulting
inventory figure will not reflect current replacement costs. LIFO accounting was started in
the United States. It is now accepted in a few other countries.
Averaging methods lump the costs to determine a midpoint. An average cost computation
for inventories results in an inventory amount and a cost of goods sold amount somewhere
between FIFO and LIFO. During times of inflation, the resulting inventory is more than LIFO
and less than FIFO. The resulting cost of goods sold is less than LIFO and more than FIFO.
Exhibit 6-6 summarizes the inventory methods used by the companies surveyed for
Accounting Trends & Techniques. The table covers the years 2009, 2008, 2007, and 2006.

Exhibit 6-6 indicates that the most popular inventory methods are FIFO and LIFO. It is per-
ceived that LIFO requires more cost to administer than FIFO. LIFO is not as popular during
times of relatively low inflation. During times of relatively high inflation, LIFO becomes
more popular because LIFO matches the latest costs against revenue. LIFO results in tax
benefits because of the matching of recent higher costs against revenue.
Exhibit 6-6 includes a summary of companies that use LIFO for all inventories, 50%
or more of inventories, less than 50% of inventories, and not determinable. This summary
indicates that only a small percentage of companies that use LIFO use it for all of their
inventories.
For the following illustration, the periodic system is used with the inventory count at the
end of the year. The same answer would result for FIFO and specific identification under
either the perpetual or periodic system. A different answer would result for LIFO or average
cost, depending on whether a perpetual or periodic system is used.
To illustrate the major costing methods for determining which costs apply to the units
remaining in inventory at the end of the year and which costs are allocated to cost of goods
sold, consider the following:

A physical inventory count on December 31 indicates 800 units on hand. There were
2,100 units available during the year, and 800 remained at the end of the year; therefore,
1,300 units were sold.
Four cost assumptions will be used to illustrate the determination of the ending inven-
tory costs and the related cost of goods sold: first-in, first-out (FIFO); last-in, first-out
(LIFO); average cost; and specific identification.
First-In, First-Out Method (FIFO) The cost of ending inventory is found by attaching cost to
the physical quantities on hand, based on the FIFO cost flow assumption. The cost of goods
sold is calculated by subtracting the ending inventory cost from the cost of goods available
for sale.

Average Cost There are several ways to compute the average cost. The weighted average
divides the total cost by the total units to determine the average cost per unit. The average
cost per unit is multiplied by the inventory quantity to determine inventory cost. The cost of
goods sold is calculated by subtracting the ending inventory cost from the cost of goods
available for sale.

Specific Identification With the specific identification method, the items in inventory are iden-
tified as coming from specific purchases. For this example, assume that the 800 items in in-
ventory can be identified with the March 1 purchase. The cost of goods sold is calculated by
subtracting the ending inventory cost from the cost of goods available for sale.

The difference in results for inventory cost and cost of goods sold from using different
inventory methods may be material or immaterial. The major impact on the results usually
comes from the rate of inflation. In general, the higher the inflation rate, the greater the dif-
ferences between the inventory methods.
Because the inventory amounts can be substantially different under the various cost flow
assumptions, the analyst should be cautious when comparing the liquidity of firms that have
different inventory cost flow assumptions. Caution is particularly necessary when one of the
firms is using the LIFO method because LIFO may prove meaningless with regard to the
firm’s short-term debt-paying ability. If two firms that have different cost flow assumptions
need to be compared, this problem should be kept in mind to avoid being misled by the indi-
cated short-term debt-paying ability.
Since the resulting inventory amount will not be equal to the cost of replacing the inven-
tory, regardless of the cost method, another problem needs to be considered when determining
the short-term debt-paying ability of the firm: the inventory must be sold for more than cost in
order to realize a profit. To the extent that the inventory is sold for more than cost, the short-
term debt-paying ability has been understated. However, the extent of the understatement is
materially reduced by several factors. One, the firm will incur substantial selling and

administrative costs in addition to the inventory cost, thereby reducing the understatement of
liquidity to the resulting net profit. Two, the replacement cost of the inventory usually exceeds
the reported inventory cost, even if FIFO is used. Therefore, more funds will be required to
replace the inventory sold. This will reduce the future short-term debt-paying ability of the
firm. Also, since accountants support the conservatism concept, they would rather have a
slight understatement of the short-term debt-paying ability of the firm than an overstatement.
The impact on the entity of the different inventory methods must be understood. Since
the extremes in inventory costing are LIFO and FIFO, the following summarizes these meth-
ods. This summary assumes that the entity faces a period of inflation. The conclusions
arrived at in this summary would be reversed if the entity faces a deflationary period.
1. LIFO generally results in a lower profit than does FIFO, as a result of a higher cost of
goods sold. This difference can be substantial.
2. Generally, reported profit under LIFO is closer to reality than profit reported under
FIFO because the cost of goods sold is closer to replacement cost under LIFO. This is the
case under both inflationary and deflationary conditions.
3. FIFO reports a higher inventory ending balance (closer to replacement cost). However,
this figure falls short of true replacement cost.
4. The cash flow under LIFO is greater than the cash flow under FIFO because of the
difference in tax liability between the two methods; this is an important reason why a
company selects LIFO.
5. Some companies use a periodic inventory system, which updates the inventory in the
general ledger once a year. Purchases made late in the year become part of the cost of
goods sold under LIFO. If prices have increased during the period, the cost of goods sold
will increase and profits will decrease. It is important that accountants inform
management that profits will be lower if substantial purchases of inventory are made
near the end of the year, and a periodic inventory system is used.
6. A company using LIFO could face a severe tax problem and a severe cash problem if
sales reduce or eliminate the amount of inventory normally carried. The reduction in
inventory would result in older costs being matched against current sales. This distorts
profits on the high side. Because of the high reported profit, income taxes would
increase. When the firm needs to replenish the inventory, it has to use additional cash.
These problems can be reduced by planning and close supervision of production and
purchases. A method called dollar-value LIFO is now frequently used by companies that
use LIFO. The dollar-value LIFO method uses price indexes related to the inventory
instead of units and unit costs. With dollar-value LIFO, inventory each period is
determined for pools of inventory dollars. (See an intermediate accounting book for a
detailed explanation of dollar-value LIFO.)
7. LIFO would probably not be used for inventory that has a high turnover rate because
there would be an immaterial difference in the results between LIFO and FIFO.
8. LIFO results in a lower profit figure than does FIFO, the result of a higher cost of goods
sold.
A firm using LIFO must disclose a LIFO reserve account, most often in a note to the fi-
nancial statement. Usually, the amount disclosed must be added to inventory to approximate
the inventory at FIFO. An inventory at FIFO is usually a reasonable approximation of the
current replacement cost of the inventory.
Lower-of-Cost-or-Market Rule We have reviewed the inventory cost-based measurements of
FIFO, LIFO, average, and specific identification. These cost-based measurements are all
considered to be historical cost approaches. The accounting profession decided that a “de-
parture from the cost basis of inventory pricing is required when the utility of the goods is
no longer as great as its cost.” Utility of the goods has been measured through market val-
ues. When the market value of inventory falls below cost, it is necessary to write the inven-
tory down to the lower market value. This is known as the lower-of-cost-or-market (LCM)
rule. Market is defined in terms of current replacement cost, either by purchase or manu-
facture.

Following the LCM rule, inventories can be written down below cost but never up
above cost. The LCM rule provides for the recognition of the loss in utility during the period
in which the loss occurs. The LCM rule is consistent with both the matching and the conser-
vatism assumptions.
The LCM rule is used by many countries other than the United States. As indicated,
market is defined in the United States in terms of current replacement cost. Market in other
countries may be defined differently, such as “net realizable value.”
Nike uses the FIFO inventory method. The Gorman-Rupp Company will be used
to illustrate LIFO. Selected balance sheet and notes from the 2008 annual report of the

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The costs for approximately 82% of invento-
ries at December 31, 2010 and 90% at December 31, 2009 are determined using the last-in, first-
out (LIFO) method, with the remainder determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
Cost components include materials inbound freight costs, labor and allocations of fixed cost, and
variable overhauls costs are absorption costing basis.
Note C – Inventories
The excess of replacement costs over LIFO cost is approximately $47.1 million and $47.6 million
at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Replacement cost approximates current cost. Some
inventory quantities were reduced during 2010 and 2009, resulting in liquidation of some LIFO
quantities carried at lower costs from earlier years versus current year costs. The related effect
increased net income by $829,000 in 2010 ($0.05 per share) and $1.9 million ($0.12 per share) in
2009. Allowances for excess and obsolete inventory totaled $2.7 million and $2.2 million at De-
cember 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

another computation determines the inventory turnover in times per year, and a third deter-
mines the inventory turnover in days.
Days’ Sales in Inventory The number of days’ sales in inventory ratio relates the amount of
the ending inventory to the average daily cost of goods sold. All of the inventory accounts
should be included in the computation. The computation gives an indication of the length of
time that it will take to use up the inventory through sales. This can be misleading if sales
are seasonal or if the company uses a natural business year.
If the company uses a natural business year for its accounting period, the number of
days’ sales in inventory will tend to be understated because the average daily cost of goods
sold will be at a low point at this time of year. If the days’ sales in inventory is understated,
the liquidity of the inventory is overstated. The same caution should be observed here as was
suggested for determining the liquidity of receivables, when one company uses a natural
business year and the other uses a calendar year.
If the company closes its year during peak activity, the number of days’ sales in inven-
tory would tend to be overstated and the liquidity would be understated. As indicated with
receivables, no good business reason exists for closing the year when activities are at a peak,
so this situation should rarely occur.
Compute the number of days’ sales in inventory as follows:
Days’ Sales in Inventory ¼
Ending Inventory
Cost of Goods Sold=365
The formula divides the number of days in a year into the cost of goods sold and then
divides the resulting figure into the ending inventory. Exhibit 6-8 presents the number of
days’ sales in inventory for Nike for May 31, 2011, and May 31, 2010. The number of days’
sales in inventory has increased from 72.94 days at the end of 2010 to 87.27 days at the end
of 2011. This represents a negative trend.
If sales are approximately constant, then the lower the number of days’ sales in inven-
tory, the better the inventory control. An inventory buildup can be burdensome if business
volume decreases. However, it can be good if business volume expands, since the increased
inventory would be available for customers. The days’ sales in inventory estimates the num-
ber of days that it will take to sell the current inventory. For several reasons, this estimate
may not be very accurate. The cost of goods sold figure is based on last year’s sales, divided
by the number of days in a year. Sales next year may not be at the same pace as last year.
Also, the ending inventory figure may not be representative of the quantity of inventory
actually on hand, especially if using LIFO.
A seasonal situation, with inventory unusually low or high at the end of the year, would
also result in an unrealistic days’ sales in inventory computation. Also, a natural business
year with low inventory at the end of the year would result in an unrealistic days’ sales in in-
ventory. Therefore, the resulting answer should be taken as a rough estimate, but it helps
when comparing periods or similar companies. The number of days’ sales in inventory could
become too low, resulting in lost sales. Good knowledge of the industry and the company is
required to determine if the number of days’ sales in inventory is too low.

In some cases, not only will the cost of goods sold not be reported separately, but the figure
reported will not be a close approximation of the cost of goods sold. This, of course, presents a
problem for the external analyst. In such cases, net sales should be used in place of the cost of
goods sold. The result will not be a realistic number of days’ sales in inventory, but it can be
useful in comparing periods within one firm and in comparing one firm with another. Using
net sales produces a much lower number of days’ sales in inventory, which materially over-
states the liquidity of the ending inventory. Therefore, only the trend determined from compar-
ing one period with another and one firm with other firms should be taken seriously (not
actual absolute figures). When you suspect that the days’ sales in inventory computation does
not result in a reasonable answer, consider using this ratio only to indicate a trend.
If the dollar figures for inventory and/or the cost of goods sold are not reasonable, the
ratios calculated with these figures may be distorted. These distortions can be eliminated to
some extent by using quantities rather than dollars in the computation. The use of quantities
in the computation may work very well for single products or groups of similar products. It
does not work very well for a large diversified inventory because of possible changes in the
mix of the inventory. Also, using quantities rather than dollars will not be feasible when
using externally published statements.
An example of the use of quantities, instead of dollars, follows:
Ending inventory
50 units
Cost of goods sold
500 units
Days’ sales in inventory =
50
500=365 = 36.50 days
Inventory Turnover Inventory turnover indicates the liquidity of the inventory. This com-
putation is similar to the accounts receivable turnover computation.
The inventory turnover formula follows:
Inventory Turnover ¼ Cost of Goods Sold
Average Inventory
Exhibit 6-9 presents the inventory turnover using the 2011 and 2010 figures for Nike.
For Nike, the inventory turnover increased from 4.64 to 4.77.
Computing the average inventory based on the beginning-of-year and end-of-year inven-
tories can be misleading if the company has seasonal fluctuations or if the company uses a
natural business year. The solution to the problem is similar to that used when computing
the receivables turnover—that is, use the monthly (or even weekly) balances of inventory.
Monthly estimates of inventory are available for internal analysis, but not for external analy-
sis. Quarterly figures may be available for external analysis. If adequate information is not
available, it is important to avoid comparing a company on a natural business year with a
company on a calendar year. The company with the natural business year tends to overstate
inventory turnover and therefore the liquidity of its inventory.

Over time, the difference between the inventory turnover for a firm that uses LIFO and
one that uses a method that results in a higher inventory figure can become very material.
The LIFO firm will have a much lower inventory and therefore a much higher turnover.
Also, it may not be reasonable to compare firms in different industries.
When you suspect that the inventory turnover computation does not result in a reasona-
ble answer because of unrealistic inventory and/or cost of goods sold dollar figures, the com-
putation should be performed using quantities rather than dollars. As with the days’ sales in
inventory, this alternative is feasible only when performing internal analysis. (It may not be
feasible even for internal analysis because of product line changes.)
Inventory Turnover in Days The inventory turnover figure can be expressed in number of
days instead of times per year. This is comparable to the computation that expressed
accounts receivable turnover in days. Compute the inventory turnover in days as follows:
Inventory Turnover in Days ¼
Average Inventory
Cost of Goods Sold=365
This is the same formula for determining the days’ sales in inventory, except that it uses
the average inventory. Exhibit 6-10 uses the 2011 and 2010 Nike data to compute the inven-
tory turnover in days. There was a decrease in inventory turnover in days for Nike in 2011.
This represents a favorable trend.
The inventory turnover in days can be used to compute the inventory turnover per year,
as follows:
365
Inventory Turnover in Days
¼ Inventory Turnover per Year
Using the 2011 Nike data, the inventory turnover is as follows:
365
Inventory Turnover in Days
¼ 365
76:44
¼ 4:77 times per year
Operating Cycle The operating cycle represents the period of time that elapses between the
acquisition of goods and the final cash realization resulting from sales and subsequent collec-
tions. An approximation of the operating cycle can be determined from the receivables li-
quidity figures and the inventory liquidity figures. Compute the operating cycle as follows:
Operating Cycle = Accounts Receivable Turnover in Days + Inventory Turnover in Days
Exhibit 6-11 uses the 2011 and 2010 Nike data to compute the operating cycle. For
Nike, the operating cycle decreased, which is a positive trend.
The estimate of the operating cycle is not realistic if the accounts receivable turnover in
days and the inventory turnover in days are not realistic. Remember that the accounts receiv-
able turnover in days and the inventory turnover in days are understated, and thus the li-
quidity is overstated, if the company uses a natural business year and computed the averages
based on beginning-of-year and end-of-year data. It should also be remembered that the

inventory turnover in days is understated, and the liquidity of the inventory overstated, if the
company uses LIFO inventory. In addition, it should be noted that accounts receivable turn-
over in days is understated, and liquidity of receivables overstated, if the sales figures used
included cash and credit sales.
The operating cycle should be helpful when comparing a firm from period to period and
when comparing a firm with similar companies. This would be the case, even if understated
or overstated, as long as the figures in the computation are comparable.
Related to the operating cycle figure is a computation that indicates how long it will take to
realize cash from the ending inventory. This computation consists of combining the number of
days’ sales in ending receivables and the number of days’ sales in ending inventory. The 2011
Nike data produced a days’ sales in ending receivables of 56.19 days and a days’ sales in ending
inventory of 87.27 days, for a total of 143.46 days. In this case, there is an increase, considering
the year-end numbers. This indicates less liquidity at the end of the year than during the year.
Prepayments
Prepayments consist of unexpired costs for which payment has been made. These current
assets are expected to be consumed within the operating cycle or one year, whichever is lon-
ger. Prepayments normally represent an immaterial portion of the current assets. Therefore,
they have little influence on the short-term debt-paying ability of the firm.
Since prepayments have been paid for and will not generate cash in the future, they dif-
fer from other current assets. Prepayments relate to the short-term debt-paying ability of the
entity because they conserve the use of cash.
Because of the nature of prepayments, the problems of valuation and liquidity are
handled in a simple manner. Valuation is taken as the cost that has been paid. Since a pre-
payment is a current asset that has been paid for in a relatively short period before the bal-
ance sheet date, the cost paid fairly represents the cash used for the prepayment. Except in
rare circumstances, a prepayment will not result in a receipt of cash; therefore, no liquidity
computation is needed. An example of a circumstance where cash is received would be an in-
surance policy canceled early. No liquidity computation is possible, even in this case.
Other Current Assets
Current assets other than cash, marketable securities, receivables, inventories, and prepay-
ments may be listed under current assets. These other current assets may be very material in
any one year and, unless they are recurring, may distort the firm’s liquidity.
These assets will, in management’s opinion, be realized in cash or conserve the use of cash
within the operating cycle of the business or one year, whichever is longer. Examples of other
current assets include property held for sale and advances or deposits, often explained in a note.
Current Liabilities
Current liabilities are “obligations whose liquidation is reasonably expected to require the
use of existing resources properly classifiable as current assets or the creation of other cur-
rent liabilities.”5 Thus, the definition of current liabilities correlates with the definition of
current assets.

Typical items found in current liabilities include accounts payable, notes payable,
accrued wages, accrued taxes, collections received in advance, and current portions of long-
term liabilities. The 2011 Nike annual report listed current liabilities as follows:
(In millions)
Current liabilities:

For a current liability, liquidity is not a problem, and the valuation problem is immate-
rial and is disregarded. Theoretically, the valuation of a current liability should be the pres-
ent value of the required future outlay of money. Since the difference between the present
value and the amount that will be paid in the future is immaterial, the current liability is car-
ried at its face value.
Current Assets Compared with Current Liabilities
A comparison of current assets with current liabilities indicates the short-term debt-paying
ability of the entity. Several comparisons can be made to determine this ability:
1. Working capital
2. Current ratio
3. Acid-test ratio
4. Cash ratio
Working Capital
The working capital of a business is an indication of the short-run solvency of the business.
Compute working capital as follows:
Working Capital = Current Assets −Current Liabilities
Exhibit 6-12 presents the working capital for Nike at the end of 2011 and 2010. Nike
had $7,339,000,000 in working capital in 2011 and $7,595,000,000 in working capital in
2010. These figures tend to be understated because some of the current assets, such as inven-
tory, may be understated, based on the book figures.
The inventory as reported may be much less than its replacement cost. The difference
between the reported inventory amount and the replacement amount is normally material
when the firm is using LIFO inventory. The difference may also be material when using one
of the other cost methods.
The current working capital amount should be compared with past amounts to deter-
mine if working capital is reasonable. Because the relative size of a firm may be expanding

or contracting, comparing the working capital of one firm with that of another firm is usu-
ally meaningless because of their size differences. If the working capital appears to be out of
line, the reasons should be found by analyzing the individual current asset and current liabil-
ity accounts.
Current Ratio
Another indicator, the current ratio, determines short-term debt-paying ability and is com-
puted as follows:
Current Ratio ¼
Current Assets
Current Liabilities
Exhibit 6-13 presents the current ratio for Nike at the end of 2011 and 2010. For Nike,
the current ratio was 2.85 at the end of 2011 and 3.26 at the end of 2010. This indicates a
negative trend considering liquidity.
For many years, the guideline for the minimum current ratio has been 2.00. Until the
mid-1960s, the typical firm successfully maintained a current ratio of 2.00 or better. Since
that time, the current ratio of many firms has declined to a point below the 2.00 guideline.
Currently, many firms are not successful in staying above a current ratio of 2.00. This indi-
cates a decline in the liquidity of many firms. It also could indicate better control of receiv-
ables and/or inventory.
A comparison with industry averages should be made to determine the typical current ra-
tio for similar firms. In some industries, a current ratio substantially below 2.00 is adequate,
while other industries require a much larger ratio. In general, the shorter the operating cycle,
the lower the current ratio. The longer the operating cycle, the higher the current ratio.
A comparison of the firm’s current ratio with prior periods, and a comparison with indus-
try averages, will help to determine if the ratio is high or low. These comparisons do not indi-
cate why it is high or low. Possible reasons can be found from an analysis of the individual
current asset and current liability accounts. Often, the major reasons for the current ratio being
out of line will be found in a detailed analysis of accounts receivable and inventory.
The current ratio is considered to be more indicative of the short-term debt-paying ability
than the working capital. Working capital only determines the absolute difference between the
current assets and current liabilities. The current ratio shows the relationship between the size
of the current assets and the size of the current liabilities, making it feasible to compare the cur-
rent ratio, for example, between IBM and Intel. A comparison of the working capital of these
two firms would be meaningless because IBM is a larger firm than Intel.
LIFO inventory can cause major problems with the current ratio because of the under-
statement of inventory. The result is an understated current ratio. Extreme caution should be
exercised when comparing a firm that uses LIFO and a firm that uses some other costing
method.
Before computing the current ratio, the analyst should compute the accounts receivable
turnover and the merchandise inventory turnover. These computations enable the analyst to

formulate an opinion as to whether liquidity problems exist with receivables and/or inven-
tory. An opinion as to the quality of receivables and inventory should influence the analyst’s
opinion of the current ratio. If liquidity problems exist with receivables and/or inventory, the
current ratio needs to be much higher.
Acid-Test Ratio (Quick Ratio)
The current ratio evaluates an enterprise’s overall liquidity position, considering current
assets and current liabilities. At times, it is desirable to access a more immediate position
than that indicated by the current ratio. The acid-test (or quick) ratio relates the most liquid
assets to current liabilities.
Inventory is removed from current assets when computing the acid-test ratio. Some of
the reasons for removing inventory are that inventory may be slow-moving or possibly obso-
lete, and parts of the inventory may have been pledged to specific creditors. For example, a
winery’s inventory requires considerable time for aging and, therefore, a considerable time
before sale. To include the wine inventory in the acid-test computation would overstate the
liquidity. A valuation problem with inventory also exists because it is stated at a cost figure
that may be materially different from a fair current valuation.
Compute the acid-test ratio as follows:
Acid-Test Ratio ¼ Current Assets " Inventory
Current Liabilities
Exhibit 6-14 presents the acid-test ratio for Nike at the end of 2011 and 2010. For Nike,
the acid-test ratio was 2.17 at the end of 2011 and 2.65 at the end of 2010. This represents
a negative trend.
It may also be desirable to exclude some other items from current assets that may not
represent current cash flow, such as prepaid and miscellaneous items. Compute the more
conservative acid-test ratio as follows:
Acid-Test Ratio ¼ Cash Equivalents þ Marketable Securities þ Net Receivables
Current Liabilities
Usually, a very immaterial difference occurs between the acid-test ratios computed under
the first method and this second method. Frequently, the only difference is the inclusion of
prepayments in the first computation.
Exhibit 6-15 presents the conservative acid-test ratio for Nike at the end of 2011 and
2010. This approach resulted in an acid-test ratio of 1.94 at the end of 2011 and 2.32 at the
end of 2010.
From this point on in this book, the more conservative computations will be used for
the acid-test ratio. When a company needs to view liquidity with only inventory removed,
the alternative computation should be used.
For many years, the guideline for the minimum acid-test ratio was 1.00. A comparison
should be made with the firm’s past acid-test ratios and with major competitors and the

industry averages. Some industries find that a ratio less than 1.00 is adequate, while others
need a ratio greater than 1.00. For example, a grocery store may sell only for cash and not
have receivables. This type of business can have an acid-test ratio substantially below the
1.00 guideline and still have adequate liquidity.
Before computing the acid-test ratio, the accounts receivable turnover should be calcu-
lated. An opinion as to the quality of receivables should help the analyst form an opinion of
the acid-test ratio.
There has been a major decline in the liquidity of companies in the United States, as
measured by the current ratio and the acid-test ratio. Exhibit 6-16 shows the dramatically

reduced liquidity of U.S. companies. Reduced liquidity leads to more bankruptcies and
greater risk for creditors and investors.
Cash Ratio
Sometimes an analyst needs to view the liquidity of a firm from an extremely conservative
point of view. For example, the company may have pledged its receivables and its inventory,
or the analyst suspects severe liquidity problems with inventory and receivables. The best in-
dicator of the company’s short-run liquidity may be the cash ratio. Compute the cash ratio
as follows:
Cash Ratio ¼ Cash Equivalents þ Marketable Securities
Current Liabilities
The analyst seldom gives the cash ratio much weight when evaluating the liquidity of a
firm because it is not realistic to expect a firm to have enough cash equivalents and market-
able securities to cover current liabilities. If the firm must depend on cash equivalents and
marketable securities for its liquidity, its solvency may be impaired.
Analysts should consider the cash ratio of companies that have naturally slow-moving
inventories and receivables and companies that are highly speculative. For example, a land
development company in Florida may sell lots paid for over a number of years on the install-
ment basis, or the success of a new company may be in doubt.
The cash ratio indicates the immediate liquidity of the firm. A high cash ratio indicates that
the firm is not using its cash to its best advantage; cash should be put to work in the operations
of the company. Detailed knowledge of the firm is required, however, before drawing a definite
conclusion. Management may have plans for the cash, such as a building expansion program.
A cash ratio that is too low could indicate an immediate problem with paying bills.
Exhibit 6-17 presents this ratio for Nike at the end of 2011 and 2010. For Nike, the cash
ratio was 1.15 at the end of 2011 and 1.53 at the end of 2010. Nike’s cash ratio decreased
materially at the end of 2011 in relation to the end of 2010.
Other Liquidity Considerations
Another ratio that may be useful to the analyst is the sales to working capital ratio. In addi-
tion, there may be liquidity considerations that are not on the face of the statements. This ra-
tio and other liquidity considerations are discussed in this section.
Sales to Working Capital (Working Capital Turnover)
Relating sales to working capital gives an indication of the turnover in working capital per
year. The analyst needs to compare this ratio with the past, with competitors, and with
industry averages in order to form an opinion as to the adequacy of the working capital
turnover. Like many ratios, no rules of thumb exist as to what it should be. Since this ratio
relates a balance sheet number (working capital) to an income statement number (sales), a
problem exists if the balance sheet number is not representative of the year. To avoid this

problem, use the average monthly working capital figure when available. Compute the
working capital turnover as follows:
Sales to Working Capital ¼
Sales
Average Working Capital
A low working capital turnover ratio tentatively indicates an unprofitable use of work-
ing capital. In other words, sales are not adequate in relation to the available working capi-
tal. A high ratio tentatively indicates that the firm is undercapitalized (overtrading). An
undercapitalized firm is particularly susceptible to liquidity problems when a major adverse
change in business conditions occurs.
Exhibit 6-18 presents this ratio for Nike at the end of 2011 and 2010. The sales to
working capital ratio increased from 2010 to 2011. (Working capital in 2011 was lower in
relation to sales than it was in 2010.) This tentatively indicates a slightly more profitable use
of working capital in 2011 in relation to 2010.
Liquidity Considerations Not on the Face of the Statements
A firm may have a better liquidity position than indicated by the face of the financial state-
ments. The following list presents several examples:
1. Unused bank credit lines would be a positive addition to liquidity. They are frequently
disclosed in notes.
2. A firm may have some long-term assets that could be converted to cash quickly. This
would add to the firm’s liquidity. Extreme caution is advised if there is any reliance on
long-term assets for liquidity. For one thing, the long-term assets are usually needed in
operations. Second, even excess long-term assets may not be easily converted into cash
in a short period of time. An exception might be investments, depending on the nature
of the investments.
3. A firm may be in a very good long-term debt position and therefore have the capability
to issue debt or stock. Thus, the firm could relieve a severe liquidity problem in a
reasonable amount of time.
A firm may not be in as good a position of liquidity as indicated by the ratios, as the fol-
lowing examples show:
1. A firm may have notes discounted on which the other party has full recourse against the
firm. Discounted notes should be disclosed in a note. (A company that discounts a
customer note receivable is in essence selling the note to the bank with recourse.)
2. A firm may have major contingent liabilities that have not been recorded, such as a
disputed tax claim. Unrecorded contingencies that are material are disclosed in a note.
3. A firm may have guaranteed a bank note for another company. This would be disclosed
in a note.

Questions
Q 6-1 It is proposed at a stockholders’ meeting that the
firm slow its rate of payments on accounts payable in order
to make more funds available for operations. It is con-
tended that this procedure will enable the firm to expand
inventory, which will in turn enable the firm to generate
more sales. Comment on this proposal.
Q 6-2 Jones Wholesale Company has been one of the
fastest growing wholesale firms in the United States for
the last five years in terms of sales and profits. The firm
has maintained a current ratio above the average for the
wholesale industry. Mr. Jones has asked you to explain
possible reasons why the firm is having difficulty meeting
its payroll and its accounts payable. What would you tell
Mr. Jones?
Q 6-3 What is the reason for separating current assets
from the rest of the assets found on the balance sheet?
Q 6-4 Define the operating cycle.
Q 6-5 Define current assets.
Q 6-6 List the major categories of items usually found in
current assets.
Q 6-7 Rachit Company has cash that has been frozen in a
bank in Cuba. Should this cash be classified as a current
asset? Discuss.
Q 6-8 A. B. Smith Company has guaranteed a $1 million
bank note for Alender Company. How would this influence
the liquidity ratios of A. B. Smith Company? How should
this situation be considered?
Q 6-9 Arrow Company has invested funds in a supplier to
help ensure a steady supply of needed materials. Would this
investment be classified as a marketable security (current asset)?
Q 6-10 List the two computations that are used to deter-
mine the liquidity of receivables.
Q 6-11 List the two computations that are used to deter-
mine the liquidity of inventory.
Q 6-12 Would a company that uses a natural business
year tend to overstate or understate the liquidity of its
receivables? Explain.
Q 6-13 T. Melcher Company uses the calendar year. Sales
are at a peak during the holiday season, and T. Melcher Com-
pany extends 30-day credit terms to customers. Comment on
the expected liquidity of its receivables, based on the days’
sales in receivables and the accounts receivable turnover.
Q 6-14 A company that uses a natural business year, or
ends its year when business is at a peak, will tend to distort
the liquidity of its receivables when end-of-year and
beginning-of-year receivables are used in the computation.
Explain how a company that uses a natural business year or
ends its year when business is at a peak can eliminate the
distortion in its liquidity computations.
Q 6-15 If a company has substantial cash sales and credit
sales, is there any meaning to the receivable liquidity com-
putations that are based on gross sales?
Q 6-16 Describe the difference in inventories between a
firm that is a retail company and a firm that is a manufactur-
ing concern.
Q 6-17 During times of inflation, which of the inventory
costing methods listed below would give the most realistic
valuation of inventory? Which method would give the least
realistic valuation of inventory? Explain.
a. LIFO
b. Average
c. FIFO
Q 6-18 The number of days’ sales in inventory relates the
amount of the ending inventory to the average daily cost of
goods sold. Explain why this computation may be mislead-
ing under the following conditions:
a. The company uses a natural business year for its
accounting period.
b. The company closes the year when activities are at a
peak.
c. The company uses LIFO inventory, and inflation has
been a problem for a number of years.
Q 6-19 The days’ sales in inventory is an estimate of the
number of days that it will take to sell the current inventory.
a. What is the ideal number of days’ sales in inventory?
b. In general, does a company want many days’ sales in
inventory?
c. Can days’ sales in inventory be too low?
Q 6-20 Some firms do not report the cost of goods sold
separately on their income statements. In such a case, how
should you proceed to compute days’ sales in inventory? Will
this procedure produce a realistic days’ sales in inventory?
Q 6-21 One of the computations used to determine the
liquidity of inventory determines the inventory turnover. In
this computation, usually the average inventory is deter-
mined by using the beginning-of-the-year and the end-of-the-
year inventory figures, but this computation can be mislead-
ing if the company has seasonal fluctuations or uses a natural
business year. Suggest how to eliminate these distortions.
Q 6-22 Explain the influence of the use of LIFO inventory
on the inventory turnover.
Q 6-23 Define working capital.
Q 6-24 Define current liabilities.

Q 6-25 Several comparisons can be made to determine
the short-term debt-paying ability of an entity. Some of
these are:
a. Working capital
b. Current ratio
c. Acid-test ratio
d. Cash ratio
1. Define each of these terms.
2. If the book figures are based on cost, will the results
of the preceding computations tend to be
understated or overstated? Explain.
3. What figures should be used in order to avoid the
problem referred to in (2)?
Q 6-26 Discuss how to use working capital in analysis.
Q 6-27 Both current assets and current liabilities are used
in the computation of working capital and the current ratio,
yet the current ratio is considered to be more indicative of
the short-term debt-paying ability. Explain.
Q 6-28 In determining the short-term liquidity of a firm, the
current ratio is usually considered to be a better guide than
the acid-test ratio, and the acid-test ratio is considered to be a
better guide than the cash ratio. Discuss when the acid-test
ratio would be preferred over the current ratio and when the
cash ratio would be preferred over the acid-test ratio.
Q 6-29 Discuss some benefits that may accrue to a firm
from reducing its operating cycle. Suggest some ways that
may be used to reduce a company’s operating cycle.
Q 6-30 Discuss why some firms have longer natural oper-
ating cycles than other firms.
Q 6-31 Would a firm with a relatively long operating
cycle tend to charge a higher markup on its inventory cost
than a firm with a short operating cycle? Discuss.
Q 6-32 Is the profitability of the entity considered to be
of major importance in determining the short-term debt-
paying ability? Discuss.
Q 6-33 Does the allowance method for bad debts or the
direct write-off method result in the fairest presentation of
receivables on the balance sheet and the fairest matching of
expenses against revenue?
Q 6-34 When a firm faces an inflationary condition and
the LIFO inventory method is based on a periodic basis,
purchases late in the year can have a substantial influence
on profits. Comment.
Q 6-35 Why could a current asset such as Net Assets of
Business Held for Sale distort a firm’s liquidity, in terms of
working capital or the current ratio?
Q 6-36 Before computing the current ratio, the accounts
receivable turnover and the inventory turnover should be
computed. Why?
Q 6-37 Before computing the acid-test ratio, compute the
accounts receivable turnover. Comment.
Q 6-38 Which inventory costing method results in the
highest balance sheet amount for inventory? (Assume infla-
tionary conditions.)
Q 6-39 Indicate the single most important factor that
motivates a company to select LIFO.
Q 6-40 A relatively low sales to working capital ratio is a
tentative indication of an efficient use of working capital.
Comment. A relatively high sales to working capital ratio is
a tentative indication that the firm is undercapitalized.
Comment.
Q 6-41 List three situations in which the liquidity position
of the firm may be better than that indicated by the liquidity
ratios.
Q 6-42 List three situations in which the liquidity position
of the firm may not be as good as that indicated by the li-
quidity ratios.
Q 6-43 Indicate the objective of the sales to working capi-
tal ratio.
Q 6-44 Why does LIFO result in a very unrealistic ending
inventory figure in a period of rising prices?
Q 6-45 The cost of inventory at the close of the calendar
year of the first year of operation is $40,000, using LIFO in-
ventory, resulting in a profit before tax of $100,000. If the
FIFO inventory would have been $50,000, what would the
reported profit before tax have been? If the average cost
method would have resulted in an inventory of $45,000,
what would the reported profit before tax have been?
Should the inventory costing method be disclosed? Why?

of a competitor, L. Konrath Company. Both companies have had similar sales results in the
past, but L. Konrath Company has had better profit results. L. Solomon Company suspects
that one reason for the better profit results is that L. Konrath Company did a better job of

P 6-16 Anne Elizabeth Corporation is engaged in the business of making toys. A high per-
centage of its products are sold to consumers during November and December. Therefore,
retailers need to have the toys in stock prior to November. The corporation produces on a
relatively stable basis during the year in order to retain its skilled employees and to minimize
its investment in plant and equipment. The seasonal nature of its business requires a substan-
tial capacity to store inventory.
The gross receivables balance at April 30, 2010, was $75,000, and the inventory balance
was $350,000 on this date. Sales for the year ended April 30, 2011, totaled $4,000,000, and
the cost of goods sold totaled $1,800,000.
Anne Elizabeth Corporation uses a natural business year that ends on April 30. Inven-
tory and accounts receivable data are given in the following table for the year ended April

P 6-26 Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts—Ethics vs. Conservatism
To aid in determining the balance for the allowance for uncollectible accounts, an aging
schedule is often prepared. The Arrow Company prepared the following aging schedule for
December 31, 2011:

The current balance in allowance for uncollectible accounts is $2,000. The president of
Arrow Company directs that the allowance be adjusted to $12,000. His reasoning is that
2011 has been a bad year for profits. Additional expenses this year will hardly be noticed,
and this will help profits in future years.

b. Is the president’s direction an example of conservatism or unethical? Comment.
P 6-27 Accounts Receivable—Note Receivable—Ethics
Eric Page, the CEO of Marvick Enterprises, has been concerned with the firm’s days’ sales in
receivables, which are running substantially higher than the past. He directs the CFO to get
on top of the situation and reduce days’ sales in receivables.
The CFO reviews the receivables and finds that the problem is substantially with one
customer that owes $10 million to Marvick Enterprises that was 120 days old. The CFO
contacts the customer who informs him that they had a temporary liquidity problem relating
to a storm that disrupted the business of several of their customers.
The CFO agrees to help out by converting the receivable to a one-year note, paying 6%.
This should give the customer adequate time and result in additional revenue for Marvick
Enterprises. The customer agrees to those terms and signs the note.
Required
a. Will the substitution of the note receivable for the account receivable reduce days’ sales
in receivable?
b. Will the substitution of the note receivable for the account receivable improve the
liquidity of Marvick Enterprises?
c. Do you consider this situation to be ethical? Comment.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (In Part)
Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The cost of the majority
of inventories is measured on the last in, first out (“LIFO”) method. Other inventories are
measured principally at average cost and consist mostly of foreign inventories and certain
raw materials.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Required
a. What is the working capital at the end of 2010?
b. What is the balance in the LIFO reserve account at the end of 2010? Describe this account.
c. If the LIFO reserve account was added to the inventory at LIFO, what would be the
resulting inventory number at the end of 2010? Which inventory amount do you
consider to be more realistic?
d. Does the use of LIFO or FIFO produce higher, lower, or the same income during
(1) price increases; (2) price decreases; and (3) constant prices? (Assume no decrease
or increase in inventory quantity).
e. Does the use of LIFO or FIFO produce higher, lower, or the same amount of cash flow
during (1) price increases; (2) price decreases; and (3) constant costs? Answer the
question for both pretax cash flows and after-tax cash flows. (Assume no decrease or
increase in inventory quantity).
f. Assume that the company purchased inventory on the last day of the year, beginning
inventory equaled ending inventory, and inventory records for the item purchases were
maintained periodically on the LIFO basis. Would that purchase be included on the
income statement or the balance sheet at year-end?
g. Explain how liquidation of LIFO layers generates income.
CASE 6-2 RISING PRICES, A TIME TO SWITCH OFF LIFO?
The following information was taken directly from the annual report of a firm that wishes
to remain anonymous. (The dates have been changed.)
FINANCIAL SUMMARY
Effects of LIFO Accounting
For a number of years, the corporation has used the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of
accounting for its steel inventories. In periods of extended inflation, coupled with uncertain
supplies of raw materials from foreign sources, and rapid increases and fluctuations in prices
of raw materials such as nickel and chrome nickel scrap, earnings can be affected unrealisti-
cally for any given year.
Because of these factors, the corporation will apply to the Internal Revenue Service for permis-
sion to discontinue using the LIFO method of accounting for valuing those inventories for which
this method has been used. If such application is granted, the LIFO reserve at December 31, 2011,
of $12,300,000 would be eliminated, which would require a provision for income taxes of
approximately $6,150,000. The corporation will also seek permission to pay the increased taxes
over a 10-year period. If the corporation had not used the LIFO method of accounting during
2010, net earnings for the year would have been increased by approximately $1,500,000.
The 2011 annual report also disclosed the following:
2011

1.
Sales and revenues
$536,467,782
$487,886,449
2.
Earnings per common share
$3.44
$3.58
Required
a. The corporation indicates that earnings can be affected unrealistically by rapid increases
and fluctuations in prices when using LIFO. Comment.
b. How much taxes will need to be paid on past earnings from the switch from LIFO?
How will the switch from LIFO influence taxes in the future?
c. How will a switch from LIFO affect 2011 profits?
d. How will a switch from LIFO affect future profits?
e. How will a switch from LIFO affect 2011 cash flow?
f. How will a switch from LIFO affect future cash flow?
g. Speculate on the real reason that the corporation wishes to switch from LIFO.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IN PART)
Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies (In Part)
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary invest-
ments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.
Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally
determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
Accounts Receivable and Allowances: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the
invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains allowances for bad
debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items. The allowance for doubtful
accounts and product returns is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit
losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales returns. The Company determines
the allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic
data and historical sales returns. The Company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts
monthly. The Company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure
related to its customers.
Required
a. Based on these data, calculate the following for 2010 and 2009:
1. Days’ sales in receivables
2. Accounts receivable turnover (gross receivables at year-end)
3. Days’ sales in inventory
4. Inventory turnover (use inventory at year-end)
5. Working capital
6. Current ratio
7. Acid-test ratio
b. Comment on each ratio individually
c. Comment on the apparent total liquidity

NOTE 1 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (In Part)
Cash Equivalents: The Corporation considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with
an original maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents.
(CASE 6-6 CONTINUED)
272 CHAPTER 6 • Liquidity of Short-Term Assets; Related Debt-Paying Ability
Copyright 2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part. Due to electronic rights, some third party content may be suppressed from the eBook and/or eChapter(s). Editorial review has 
deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Corporation evaluates the collectibility of its
accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where the Corpora-
tion is aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific allowance
for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount the
Corporation reasonably expects will be collected. In addition, the Corporation recognizes
allowances for bad debts based on estimates developed by using standard quantitative meas-
ures incorporating historical write-offs. See Note 6 for further information.
Customer Allowances and Discounts: The Corporation offers certain of its customers allow-
ances and discounts including cooperative advertising, rebates, marketing allowances and
various other allowances and discounts. These amounts are recorded as reductions of gross
accounts receivable or included in accrued liabilities and are recognized as reductions of net
sales when earned. These amounts are earned by the customer as product is purchased from
the Corporation and are recorded based on the terms of individual customer contracts. See
Note 6 for further information.
Concentration of Credit Risks: The Corporation sells primarily to customers in the retail
trade, including those in the mass merchandise, drug store, discount retailer, supermarket
and other channels of distribution. These customers are located throughout the United
States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico. Net sales from
continuing operations to the Corporation’s five largest customers accounted for approxi-
mately 42%, 39% and 36% of total revenue in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net sales
to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately 15%, 14% and
15% of total revenue in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net sales to Target Corporation
accounted for approximately 14% and 13% of total revenue in 2011 and 2010, respectively,
and less than 10% in 2009.
The Corporation conducts business based on periodic evaluations of its customers’ finan-
cial condition and generally does not require collateral to secure their obligation to the Corpo-
ration. While the competitiveness of the retail industry presents an inherent uncertainty, the
Corporation does not believe a significant risk of loss exists from a concentration of credit.
Inventories: Finished products, work in process and raw materials inventories are carried at
the lower of cost or market. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method is used for certain
domestic inventories, which approximate 80% of the total pre-LIFO consolidated invento-
ries at February 28, 2011 and 2010, respectively. International inventories and the remain-
ing domestic inventories principally use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method except for
display material and factory supplies which are carried at average cost. The Corporation
allocates fixed production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of the pro-
duction facilities. Abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and
wasted material are treated as a current period expense. See Note 7 for further information.
NOTE 6 – CUSTOMER ALLOWANCES AND DISCOUNTS
Trade accounts receivable are reported net of certain allowances and discounts. The most
significant of these are as follows:
February 28, 2011
February 28, 2010
Allowance for seasonal sales returns

There were no material LIFO liquidations in 2011 and 2009. During 2010, inventory quan-
tities declined resulting in the liquidation of LIFO inventory layers carried at lower costs
compared with current year purchases. The income statement effect of such liquidation on
material, labor and other production costs was approximately $13,000. Inventory held on
location for retailers with SBT arrangements, which is included in finished products, totaled
approximately $42,000 and $38,000 as of February 28, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Required
a. Based on these data, calculate the following for 2011 and 2010:
1. Days’ sales in receivables
2. Accounts receivable turnover (gross receivables at year-end)
3. Days’ sales in inventory
4. Inventory turnover (use inventory at year-end)
5. Working capital
6. Current ratio
7. Acid-test ratio
b. Comment on each ratio individually.
c. 1. Describe the individual allowance consideration.
2. Are some of these allowance considerations normal for most companies?
d. What would be the inventory balance at February 28, 2011 if the LIFO reserve were
removed?
e. Were there material LIFO liquidations in 2011, 2010 or 2009?
f. Comment on the apparent total liquidity.
CASE 6-7 LIFO – TAX, U.S. GAAP AND IFRS IMPLICATIONS
The LIFO method assumes that the costs of the latest items bought or produced are matched
against current sales. Usually, this assumption materially improves the matching of current
costs against current revenue.
In the United States, LIFO is accepted GAAP as it is in some other countries. IFRS does
not allow LIFO.
LIFO is used in many industries in the United States. In some industries, 50% or more
of the firms use LIFO.

For some United States companies, their LIFO reserve account is very material. Some
companies with substantial LIFO reserves are as follows:
Company

In the United States, if LIFO is used for federal taxes, then it must be used for financial
reporting. Many firms that use LIFO would likely not use LIFO except for this conformity
requirement.
During periods of rising prices, the firm should benefit on taxes as long as the inventory
does not decline. The tax benefit may be reduced or eliminated if inventory quantities decline
and old lower costs are matched against current sales.
Required
a. If the United States firms adopt IFRS, what implications will this have for United States
firms that use LIFO?
b. Assume that the United States tax rate is 40% including federal, state and local income
taxes. What is the potential tax liability (in total) for the firms listed in this case?

Chapter
7
Long-Term Debt-Paying
Ability
T
his chapter covers two approaches to viewing a firm’s long-term debt-paying ability.
One approach views the firm’s ability to carry the debt as indicated by the income
statement, and the other considers the firm’s ability to carry debt as indicated by the
balance sheet.
In the long run, a relationship exists between the reported income resulting from the use
of accrual accounting and the ability of the firm to meet its long-term obligations. Although
the reported income does not agree with the cash available in the short run, the revenue and
expense items eventually do result in cash movements. Because of the close relationship
between the reported income and the ability of the firm to meet its long-run obligations, the
entity’s profitability is an important factor when determining long-term debt-paying ability.
In addition to the profitability of the firm, the amount of debt in relation to the size of
the firm should be analyzed. This analysis indicates the amount of funds provided by out-
siders in relation to those provided by owners of the firm. If outsiders have provided a high
proportion of the resources, the risks of the business have been substantially shifted to the
outsiders. A large proportion of debt in the capital structure increases the risk of not meeting
the principal or interest obligation because the company may not generate adequate funds to
meet these obligations.
Income Statement Consideration When Determining
Long-Term Debt-Paying Ability
The firm’s ability to carry debt, as indicated by the income statement, can be viewed by con-
sidering the times interest earned and the fixed charge coverage.
Times Interest Earned
The times interest earned ratio indicates a firm’s long-term debt-paying ability from the
income statement view. If the times interest earned is adequate, little danger exists that the

firm will not be able to meet its interest obligation. If the firm has good coverage of the inter-
est obligation, it should also be able to refinance the principal when it comes due. In effect,
the funds will probably never be required to pay off the principal if the company has a good
record of covering the interest expense. A relatively high, stable coverage of interest over the
years indicates a good record; a low, fluctuating coverage from year to year indicates a poor
record.
Companies that maintain a good record can finance a relatively high proportion of debt
in relation to shareholders’ equity and, at the same time, obtain funds at favorable rates.
Utility companies have traditionally been examples of companies that have a high debt struc-
ture in relation to shareholders’ equity. They accomplished this because of their relatively
high, stable coverage of interest over the years. This stability evolved in an industry with a
regulated profit and a relatively stable demand. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, utilities
experienced a severe strain on their profits, as rate increases did not keep pace with inflation.
In addition, the demand was not as predictable as in prior years. The strain on profits and
the uncertainty of demand influenced investors to demand higher interest rates from utilities
than had been previously required in relation to other companies.
A company issues debt obligations to obtain funds at an interest rate less than the earn-
ings from these funds. This is called trading on the equity or leverage. With a high interest
rate, the added risk exists that the company will not be able to earn more on the funds than
the interest cost on them.
Compute times interest earned as follows:
Times Interest Earned ¼
Recurring Earnings, Excluding Interest
Expense, Tax Expense, Equity Earnings,
and Noncontrolling Interest
Interest Expense, Including Capitalized Interest
The income statement contains several figures that might be used in this analysis. In gen-
eral, the primary analysis of the firm’s ability to carry the debt as indicated by the income
statement should include only income expected to occur in subsequent periods. Thus, the fol-
lowing nonrecurring items should be excluded:
1. Discontinued operations
2. Extraordinary items
In addition to these nonrecurring items, other items that should be excluded for the
times interest earned computation include:
1. INTEREST EXPENSE. This is added back to net income because the interest coverage
would be understated by one if interest expense were deducted before computing times
interest earned.
2. INCOME TAX EXPENSE. Income taxes are computed after deducting interest expense,
so they do not affect the safety of the interest payments.
3. EQUITY EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF NONCONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES. These
are excluded because they are not available to cover interest payments, except to the
extent that they are accompanied by cash dividends.
4. NET INCOME—NONCONTROLLING INTEREST. This adjustment at the bottom
of the income statement should be excluded; use income before Net income–Noncontrolling
interest. Net income–Noncontrolling interest results from consolidating a firm in
which a company has control but less than 100% ownership. All of the interest
expense of the firm consolidated is included in the consolidated income statement.
Therefore, all of the income of the firm consolidated should be considered in the
coverage.
Capitalization of interest results in interest being added to a fixed asset instead of
expensed. The interest capitalized should be included with the total interest expense in the
denominator of the times interest earned ratio because it is part of the interest payment. The
capitalized interest must be added to the interest expense disclosed on the income statement
or in notes.

An example of capitalized interest would be interest during the current year on a bond
issued to build a factory. As long as the factory is under construction, this interest would be
added to the asset account, Construction in Process, on the balance sheet. This interest does
not appear on the income statement, but it is as much of a commitment as the interest
expense deducted on the income statement.
When the factory is completed, the annual interest on the bond issued to build the fac-
tory will be expensed. When expensed, interest appears on the income statement.
Capitalized interest is usually disclosed in a note. Some firms describe the capitalized in-
terest on the face of the income statement.
Exhibit 7-1 shows the computation for times interest earned for the years 2011 and
2010. These are very high numbers, and the coverage decreased in 2011.
To evaluate the adequacy of coverage, the times interest earned ratio should be
computed for a period of three to five years and compared to competitors and the indus-
try average. Computing interest earned for three to five years provides insight on the
stability of the interest coverage. Because the firm needs to cover interest in the bad years
as well as the good years, the lowest times interest earned in the period is used as the
primary indication of the interest coverage. A cyclical firm may have a very high times
interest earned ratio in highly profitable years, but interest may not be covered in low
profit years.
Interest coverage on long-term debt is sometimes computed separately from the normal
times interest earned. For this purpose only, use the interest on long-term debt, thus focusing
on the long-term interest coverage. Since times interest earned indicates long-term debt-
paying ability, this revised computation helps focus on the long-term position. For external
analysis, it is usually not practical to compute times interest coverage on long-term debt
because of the lack of data. However, this computation can be made for internal analysis.
In the long run, a firm must have the funds to meet all of its expenses. In the short run, a
firm can often meet its interest obligations even when the times interest earned is less than
1.00. Some of the expenses, such as depreciation expense, amortization expense, and deple-
tion expense, do not require funds in the short run. The airline industry has had several
bad periods when the times interest earned was less than 1.00, but it was able to maintain
the interest payments.
To get a better indication of a firm’s ability to cover interest payments in the short run,
the noncash expenses such as depreciation, depletion, and amortization can be added back to
the numerator of the times interest earned ratio. The resulting ratio, which is less conservative,
gives a type of cash basis times interest earned useful for evaluating the firm in the short run.

Fixed Charge Coverage
The fixed charge coverage ratio, an extension of the times interest earned ratio, also indi-
cates a firm’s long-term debt-paying ability from the income statement view. The fixed
charge coverage ratio indicates a firm’s ability to cover fixed charges. It is computed as
follows:
Fixed Charge Coverage ¼
Recurring Earnings, Excluding Interest Expense,
Tax Expense, Equity Earnings, and
Noncontrolling Interest þ Interest Portion of Rentals
Interest Expense, Including Capitalized Interest
þ Interest Portion of Rentals
A difference of opinion occurs in practice as to what should be included in the fixed
charges. When assets are leased, the lessee classifies leases as either capital leases or operat-
ing leases. The lessee treats a capital lease as an acquisition and includes the leased asset in
fixed assets and the related obligation in liabilities. Part of the lease payment is considered to
be interest expense. Therefore, the interest expense on the income statement includes interest
related to capital leases.
A portion of operating lease payments is an item frequently included in addition to inter-
est expense. Operating leases are not on the balance sheet, but they are reflected on the
income statement in the rent expense. An operating lease for a relatively long term is a type
of long-term financing, so part of the lease payment is really interest. When a portion of
operating lease payments is included in fixed charges, it is an effort to recognize the true total
interest that the firm pays.
SEC reporting may require a more conservative computation than the times interest
earned ratio in order to determine the firm’s long-term debt-paying ability. The SEC refers to
its ratio as the ratio of earnings to fixed charges. The major difference between the times in-
terest earned computation and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is that the latter compu-
tation includes a portion of the operating leases.
Usually, one-third of the operating leases’ rental charges is included in the fixed charges
because this is an approximation of the proportion of lease payment that is interest. The
SEC does not accept the one-third approximation automatically, but requires a more specific
estimate of the interest portion based on the terms of the lease. Individuals interested in a
company’s ratio of earnings to fixed charges can find this ratio on the face of the income
statement included with the SEC registration statement (Form S-7) when debt securities are
registered.
Nike discloses that the interest component of leases includes one-tenth of rental expense,
which approximates the interest component of operating leases. When working problems
and the like in this book, use the one-third of operating leases’ rental charges as an approxi-
mation of the proportion of lease payment that is interest when the interest component of
leases is not disclosed.
The same adjusted earnings figure is used in the fixed charge coverage ratio as is used
for the times interest earned ratio, except that the interest portion of operating leases (rent-
als) is added to the adjusted earnings for the fixed charge coverage ratio. The interest portion
of operating leases is added to the adjusted earnings because it was previously deducted on
the income statement as rental charges.
Exhibit 7-2 shows the fixed charge coverage for Nike for 2011 and 2010, with the inter-
est portion of rentals considered. This figure, though more conservative than the times inter-
est earned, is still very good for Nike.
Among the other items sometimes considered as fixed charges are depreciation, deple-
tion and amortization, debt principal payments, and pension payments. Substantial preferred
dividends may also be included, or a separate ratio may be computed to consider preferred
dividends. The more items considered as fixed charges, the more conservative the ratio. The
trend is usually similar to that found for the times interest earned ratio.

Balance Sheet Consideration When Determining
Long-Term Debt-Paying Ability
The firm’s ability to carry debt, as indicated by the balance sheet, can be viewed by consider-
ing the debt ratio and the debt/equity ratio.
Debt Ratio
The debt ratio indicates the firm’s long-term debt-paying ability. It is computed as follows:
Debt Ratio ¼ Total Liabilities
Total Assets
Total liabilities includes short-term liabilities, reserves, deferred tax liabilities, noncon-
trolling interests, redeemable preferred stock, and any other noncurrent liability. It does not
include shareholders’ equity.
The debt ratio indicates the percentage of assets financed by creditors, and it helps
to determine how well creditors are protected in case of insolvency. If creditors are not
well protected, the company is not in a position to issue additional long-term debt. From the per-
spective of long-term debt-paying ability, the lower this ratio, the better the company’s position.
Exhibit 7-3 shows the debt ratio for Nike for May 31, 2011, and May 31, 2010. The ex-
hibit indicates that substantially less than one-half of the Nike assets were financed by out-
siders in both 2011 and 2010. This debt ratio is a conservative computation because all of
the liabilities and near liabilities have been included. At the same time, the assets are under-
stated because no adjustments have been made for assets that have a fair market value
greater than book value.
The debt ratio should be compared with competitors and industry averages. Industries
that have stable earnings can handle more debt than industries that have cyclical earnings.
This comparison can be misleading if one firm has substantial hidden assets, or liabilities
that other firms do not (such as substantial land carried at historical cost).
In practice, substantial disagreement occurs on the details of the formula to compute the
debt ratio. Some of the disagreement revolves around whether short-term liabilities should
be included. Some firms exclude short-term liabilities because they are not long-term sources
of funds and are, therefore, not a valid indication of the firm’s long-term debt position.
Other firms include short-term liabilities because these liabilities become part of the total

source of outside funds in the long run. For example, individual accounts payable are rela-
tively short term, but accounts payable in total becomes a rather permanent part of the entire
sources of funds. This book takes a conservative position that includes the short-term liabil-
ities in the debt ratio.
Another issue involves whether certain other items should be included in liabilities. Under
current GAAP, some liabilities clearly represent a commitment to pay out funds in the future,
whereas other items may never result in a future payment. Items that present particular problems
as to a future payment of funds include reserves, deferred taxes, noncontrolling interests, and
redeemable preferred stock. Each of these items will be reviewed in the sections that follow.
Reserves
The reserve accounts classified under liabilities (some short-term and some long-term) result
from an expense charge to the income statement and an equal increase in the reserve account
on the balance sheet. These reserve accounts do not represent definite commitments to pay
out funds in the future, but they are estimates of funds that will be paid out.
Reserve accounts are used infrequently in U.S. financial reporting. It is thought that they
provide too much discretion in determining the amount of the reserve and the related impact
on reported income. When the reserve account is increased, income is reduced. A reduction
in a reserve account represents a balance sheet entry. Reserve accounts are popular in some
other countries like Germany. This book takes a conservative position that includes the
reserves in liabilities in the debt ratio.
Deferred Taxes (Interperiod Tax Allocation)
In the United States, a firm may recognize certain income and expense items in one period
for the financial statements and in another period for the federal tax return. This can result
in financial statement income in any one period that is substantially different from tax
return income. For many other countries, this is not the case. For example, there are
few timing differences in Germany, and there are no timing differences in Japan. For these
countries, deferred taxes are not a substantial issue or are not an issue at all. In the United
States, taxes payable based on the tax return can be substantially different from income
tax expense based on financial statement income. Current GAAP directs that the
tax expense for the financial statements be based on the tax-related items on the financial
statements. Taxes payable are based on the actual current taxes payable, determined
by the tax return. (The Internal Revenue Code specifies the procedures for determining
taxable income.) The tax expense for the financial statements often does not agree
with the taxes payable. The difference between tax expense and taxes payable is recorded
as deferred income taxes. The concept that results in deferred income taxes is called
interperiod tax allocation.

As an illustration of deferred taxes, consider the following facts related to a machinery
purchase for $100,000:
Three-year write-off for tax purposes:
1st year
$ 25,000
2nd year
38,000
3rd year
37,000
$100,000

20,000
3rd year
20,000
4th year
20,000
5th year
20,000
$100,000
For both tax and financial statement purposes, $100,000 was written off for the equip-
ment. The write-off on the tax return was three years, while the write-off on the financial
statements was five years. The faster write-off on the tax return resulted in lower taxable
income than the income reported on the income statement during the first three years. Dur-
ing the last two years, the income statement income was lower than the tax return income.
In addition to temporary differences, the tax liability can be influenced by an operating
loss carryback and/or operating loss carryforward. The tax code allows a corporation
reporting an operating loss for income tax purposes in the current year to carry this loss
back and forward to offset reported taxable income. The company may first carry an operat-
ing loss back two years in sequential order, starting with the earliest of the two years. If the
taxable income for the past two years is not enough to offset the operating loss, then the
remaining loss is sequentially carried forward 20 years and offset against future taxable
income.
A company can elect to forgo a carryback and, instead, only carry forward an operating
loss. A company would not normally forgo a carryback because an operating loss carryback
results in a definite and immediate income tax refund. A carryforward will reduce income
taxes payable in future years to the extent of earned taxable income. A company could possi-
bly benefit from forgoing a carryback if prospects in future years are good and an increase
in the tax rate is anticipated.
Interperiod tax allocation should be used for all temporary differences. A temporary dif-
ference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the finan-
cial statements will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported
amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.
A corporation usually reports deferred taxes in two classifications: a net current amount
and a net noncurrent amount. The net current amount could result in a current asset or a
current liability being reported. The net noncurrent amount could result in a noncurrent
asset or a noncurrent liability being reported.
Classification as current or noncurrent is usually based on the classification of the asset
or liability responsible for the temporary difference. For example, a deferred tax liability
resulting from the excess of tax depreciation over financial reporting depreciation would be
reported as a noncurrent liability. This is because the temporary difference is related to non-
current assets (fixed assets).
When a deferred tax asset or liability is not related to an asset or a liability, the deferred
tax asset or liability is classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary dif-
ference. For example, a deferred tax amount resulting from an operating loss carryforward
would be classified based on the expected reversal date of the temporary difference.
There should be a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset if sufficient uncer-
tainty exists about a corporation’s future taxable income. A valuation allowance reduces the
deferred tax asset to its expected realizable amount. At the time that the valuation allowance
is recognized, tax expense is increased.
A more likely than not criterion is used to measure uncertainty. If more likely than not a
deferred asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance would be required.

Nike discloses deferred taxes in current assets, long-term assets, and long-term liabilities.
For many firms, the long-term liability, deferred taxes, has grown to a substantial amount,
which often increases each year. This occurs because of the growth in the temporary differ-
ences that cause the timing difference.
Deferred taxes must be accounted for, using the liability method, which focuses on the
balance sheet. Deferred taxes are recorded at amounts at which they will be settled when
underlying temporary differences reverse. Deferred taxes are adjusted for tax rate changes. A
change in tax rates can result in a material adjustment to the deferred account and can sub-
stantially influence income in the year of the tax rate change.
Some individuals disagree with the concept of deferred taxes (interperiod tax allocation).
It is uncertain that the deferred tax will be paid. If it will be paid (received), it is uncertain
when it will be paid (or received). The deferred tax accounts are, therefore, often referred to
as soft accounts.
Because of the uncertainty over whether (and when) a deferred tax liability (asset) will
be paid (received), some individuals elect to exclude deferred tax liabilities and assets when
performing analysis. This is inconsistent with GAAP, which recognize deferred taxes.
Some revenue and expense items, referred to as permanent differences, never go on the
tax return, but do go on the income statement. Examples would be premiums on life insur-
ance and life insurance proceeds. Federal tax law does not allow these items to be included
in expense and revenue, respectively. These items never influence either the tax expense or
the tax liability, so they never influence the deferred tax accounts.
Noncontrolling Interest
The account, noncontrolling interest, results when the firm has consolidated another com-
pany of which it owns less than 100%. The proportion of the consolidated company that is
not owned appears on the balance sheet as part of shareholders’ equity.
Some firms exclude the noncontrolling interest when computing debt ratios because
this amount does not represent a commitment to pay funds to outsiders. Other firms
include the noncontrolling interest when computing debt ratios because these funds came
from outsiders and are part of the total funds that the firm uses. This book takes the con-
servative position of including noncontrolling interest in the primary computation of debt
ratios. To review noncontrolling interest, refer to the section of Chapter 3 on noncontrol-
ling interest.
Redeemable Preferred Stock
Redeemable preferred stock is subject to mandatory redemption requirements or has a
redemption feature outside the issuer’s control. Some redeemable preferred stock agreements
require the firm to purchase certain amounts of the preferred stock on the open market. The
Securities and Exchange Commission dictates that redeemable preferred stock not be dis-
closed under shareholders’ equity.
The nature of redeemable preferred stock leaves open to judgment how it should be
handled when computing debt ratios. One view excludes it from debt and includes it in
shareholders’ equity, on the grounds that it does not represent a normal debt relationship. A
conservative position includes it as debt when computing the debt ratios. This book uses the
conservative approach and includes redeemable preferred stock in debt for the primary com-
putation of debt ratios. For a more detailed review, refer to the section of Chapter 3 that
describes redeemable preferred stock.
Debt/Equity Ratio
The debt/equity ratio is another computation that determines the entity’s long-term debt-
paying ability. This computation compares the total debt with the total shareholders’ equity.
The debt/equity ratio also helps determine how well creditors are protected in case of
insolvency. From the perspective of long-term debt-paying ability, the lower this ratio is, the
better the company’s debt position.
In this book, the computation of the debt/equity ratio is conservative because all of the
liabilities and near liabilities are included, and the shareholders’ equity is understated to the

extent that assets have a value greater than book value. This ratio should also be compared
with industry averages and competitors. Compute the debt/equity ratio as follows:
Debt/Equity Ratio ¼
Total Liabilities
Shareholders’ Equity
Exhibit 7-4 shows the debt/equity ratio for Nike for May 31, 2011, and May 31, 2010.
Using a conservative approach to computing debt/equity, Exhibit 7-4 indicates the debt/
equity ratio was 52.37% at the end of 2011, down from 47.83% at the end of 2010.
The debt ratio and the debt/equity ratio have the same objectives. Therefore, these ratios
are alternatives to each other if they are computed in the manner recommended here.
Because some financial services may be reporting the debt ratio and others may be reporting
the debt/equity ratio, the reader should be familiar with both.
As indicated previously, a problem exists with the lack of uniformity in the way some
ratios are computed. This especially occurs with the debt ratio and the debt/equity ratio. When
comparing the debt ratio and the debt/equity ratio with industry ratios, try to determine how
the industry ratios were computed. A reasonable comparison may not be possible because the
financial sources sometimes do not indicate what elements of debt the computations include.
Debt to Tangible Net Worth Ratio
The debt to tangible net worth ratio also determines the entity’s long-term debt-paying abil-
ity. This ratio also indicates how well creditors are protected in case of the firm’s insolvency.
As with the debt ratio and the debt/equity ratio, from the perspective of long-term debt-
paying ability, it is better to have a lower ratio.
The debt to tangible net worth ratio is a more conservative ratio than either the debt ra-
tio or the debt/equity ratio. It eliminates intangible assets, such as goodwill, trademarks, pat-
ents, and copyrights, because they do not provide resources to pay creditors—a very
conservative position. Compute the debt to tangible net worth ratio as follows:
Debt to Tangible Net Worth Ratio ¼
Total Liabilities
Shareholders’ Equity # Intangible Assets
In this book, the computation of the debt to tangible net worth ratio is conservative. All
of the liabilities and near liabilities are included, and the shareholders’ equity is understated
to the extent that assets have a value greater than book value.
Exhibit 7-5 shows the debt to tangible net worth ratios for Nike for May 31, 2011, and
May 31, 2010. This is a conservative view of the debt-paying ability. There was a substantial
increase in debt to tangible net work in 2011.
Other Long-Term Debt-Paying Ability Ratios
A number of additional ratios indicate perspective on the long-term debt-paying ability of a firm.
The current debt/net worth ratio indicates a relationship between current liabilities and
funds contributed by shareholders. The higher the proportion of funds provided by current
liabilities, the greater the risk.

Another ratio, the total capitalization ratio, compares long-term debt to total capitaliza-
tion. Total capitalization consists of long-term debt, preferred stock, and common share-
holders’ equity. The lower the ratio, the lower the risk.
Another ratio, the fixed asset/equity ratio, indicates the extent to which shareholders
have provided funds in relation to fixed assets. Some firms subtract intangibles from share-
holders’ equity to obtain tangible net worth. This results in a more conservative ratio. The
higher the fixed assets in relation to equity, the greater the risk.
Exhibit 7-6 indicates the trend in current liabilities, total liabilities, and owners’ equity
of firms in the United States between 1964 and 2010. It shows that a major shift has taken
place in the capital structure of firms, toward a higher proportion of debt in relation to total
assets. This indicates a substantial increase in risk as management more frequently faces debt
coming due. It also indicates that short-term debt is a permanent part of the financial struc-
ture of firms. This supports the decision to include short-term liabilities in the ratios deter-
mining long-term debt-paying ability (debt ratio, debt/equity ratio, and debt to tangible net
worth ratio).

Special Items That Influence a Firm’s Long-Term
Debt-Paying Ability
A number of special items influence a firm’s long-term debt-paying ability. These items are
now reviewed.
Long-Term Assets versus Long-Term Debt
The specific assets of the firm are important if the firm becomes unprofitable and the assets
are sold. Therefore, consider the assets of the firm when determining the long-term debt-
paying ability. The assets are insurance should the firm become unprofitable. The ability to
analyze the assets, in relation to the long-term debt-paying ability, is limited, based on the in-
formation reported in the published financial statements. The statements do not extensively
disclose market or liquidation values; they disclose only unrecovered cost for many items.
The market value figure reported for some investments has been an exception.
A review of the financial statements is often of value if the firm liquidates or decides to
reduce the scope of its operations. Examples of assets that may have substantial value would
be land, timberlands, and investments.
When Penn Central Company went bankrupt, it had substantial debt and operating
losses. Yet because of assets that had substantial market values, creditors were repaid. In
other cases, creditors receive nothing or only nominal amounts when a firm goes bankrupt.
Substantial assets that have a potential value higher than the book figures may also indi-
cate an earnings potential that will be realized later. For example, knowing that a railroad
owns land that contains millions or billions of tons of coal could indicate substantial profit
potential, even if the coal is not economical to mine at the present time. In future years, as
the price of competitive products such as oil and gas increases, the coal may become eco-
nomical to mine. This happened in the United States in the late 1970s. Several railroads that
owned millions or billions of tons of unmined coal found that the coal became very valuable
as the price of oil and gas increased.
Long-Term Leasing
Earlier, this chapter explained the influence of long-term leasing in relation to the income
statement. Now we will consider the influence of long-term leasing from the balance sheet
perspective.
First, we will review some points made previously. The lessee classifies leases as either
capital leases or operating leases. A capital lease is handled as if the lessee acquired the asset.
The leased asset is classified as a fixed asset, and the related obligation is included in liabil-
ities. Operating leases are not reflected on the balance sheet but in a note and on the income
statement as rent expense.
Operating leases for a relatively long term (a type of long-term financing) should be con-
sidered in a supplemental manner as to their influence on the debt structure of the firms.
Capital leases have already been considered in the debt ratios computed because the capital
leases were part of the total assets and also part of the total liabilities on the balance sheet.
The capitalized asset amount will not agree with the capitalized liability amount because
the liability is reduced by payments and the asset is reduced by depreciation taken. Usually,
a company depreciates capital leases faster than payments are made. This would result in the
capitalized asset amount being lower than the related capitalized liability amount. On the
original date of the capital lease, the capitalized asset amount and the capitalized liability
amount are the same.
The Nike note relating to long-term leases indicates the minimum future rentals under
operating leases for years subsequent to May 31, 2011. These figures do not include an
amount for any possible contingent rentals because they are not practicable to estimate.
Note 15—Commitments and Contingencies (In Part)
The Company leases space for certain of its offices, warehouses and retail stores under
leases expiring from 1 to 24 years after May 31, 2011. Rent expense was $446 million,
288 CHAPTER 7 • Long-Term Debt-Paying Ability

$416 million, and $397 million for the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. Amounts of minimum future annual rental commitments under non-
cancelable operating leases in each of the five years ending May 31, 2012 through
2016 are $374 million, $310 million, $253 million, $198 million, $174 million,
respectively, and $535 million in later years.
If these leases had been capitalized, the amount added to fixed assets and the amount
added to liabilities would be the same at the time of the initial entry. As indicated previously,
the amounts would not be the same, subsequently, because the asset is depreciated at some
selected rate, while the liability is reduced as payments are made. When incorporating the
operating leases into the debt ratios, use the liability amount and assume that the asset and the
liability amount would be the same since no realistic way exists to compute the difference.
It would not be realistic to include the total future rentals that relate to operating leases
in the lease commitments note ($1,844) because part of the commitment would be an inter-
est consideration. Earlier, this chapter indicated that some firms estimate that one-third of
the operating lease commitment is for interest. With a one-third estimate for interest, two-
thirds is estimated for principal. Nike estimated the interest component of leases includes
one-tenth of rental expense and approximates the interest component of operating leases.
This would mean the estimate for principal would be 90%. This amount can be added to
fixed assets and long-term liabilities in order to obtain a supplemental view of the debt ratios
that relate to the balance sheet. Exhibit 7-7 shows the adjusted debt ratio and debt/equity
ratio for Nike at May 31, 2011; this increases the debt position by a material amount.
In Chapter 1 it was indicated that the FASB and the IASB were working on the conver-
gence of U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. A major convergence
project involves leases. This project is fairly broad and will likely eliminate operating leases.
Many of these leases will be recorded as an asset and liability. Also, contingent rents will be
reviewed for capitalization on a basis of most likely estimated future payments.
When this standard is issued and effective, it will result in increased assets and liabilities.
The new standard will reduce rent and increase interest expense. It will also increase depreci-
ation expense.
The note on operating leases will be eliminated. Thus the adjustment of the debt ratio
and debt/equity will be eliminated.
Pension Plans
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) became law in 1974 and substan-
tially influenced the administration of pension plans, while elevating their liability status for

the firm. This act includes provisions requiring minimum funding of plans, minimum rights
to employees upon termination of their employment, and the creation of a special federal
agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), to help fund employee benefits
when pension plans are terminated. The PBGC receives a fee for every employee covered by
a pension plan subject to PBGC. The PBGC has the right to impose a lien against a covered
firm of 30% of the firm’s net worth. This lien has the status of a tax lien and, therefore,
ranks high among creditor claims. In practice, the PBGC has been reluctant to impose this
lien except when a firm is in bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the PBGC has received a
relatively small amount of assets when it has imposed the lien.
An important provision in a pension plan is the vesting provision. An employee vested
in the pension plan is eligible to receive some pension benefits at retirement, regardless of
whether the employee continues working for the employer. ERISA has had a major impact
on reducing the vesting time. The original ERISA has been amended several times to increase
the responsibility of firms regarding their pension plans.
In 1980, Congress passed the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendment Act. Multiem-
ployer pension plans are plans maintained jointly by two or more unrelated employers. This
act provides for significant increased employer obligations for multiemployer pension plans
and makes the PBGC coverage mandatory for multiemployer plans.
When a firm has a multiemployer pension plan, it normally covers union employees.
Such a firm usually has other pension plans that cover nonunion employees. When disclosing
a multiemployer pension plan, the firm normally includes the cost of the plan with the cost
of the other pension plans. It is usually not practical to isolate the cost of these plans because
of commingling. These plans usually operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, so no liability arises
unless a payment has not been made. A potential significant liability arises if the company
withdraws from the multiemployer plan. Unfortunately, the amount of this liability often
cannot be ascertained from the pension note.
The Kroger Company included the following comment in its January 29, 2011, annual
report (in millions):
Multi-Employer Plans
The Company also contributes to various multi-employer pension plans based on
obligations arising from most of its collective bargaining agreements. These plans
provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing
employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Trustees are
appointed in equal number by employers and unions. The trustees typically are
responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well
as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans.
The Company recognizes expense in connection with these plans as contributions are
funded. The Company made contributions to these funds, and recognized expense, of
$262 million in 2010, $233 million in 2009, and $219 million in 2008.
Based on the most recent information available to it, the Company believes that the
present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi-employer plans
substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. Moreover, if the
Company were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these
funds, the Company could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. Any adjustment for
withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be
reasonably estimated.

Defined Contribution Plan
A company-sponsored pension plan is either a defined contribution plan or a defined benefit plan.
A defined contribution plan defines the contributions of the company to the pension plan. Once
this defined contribution is paid, the company has no further obligation to the pension plan. This
type of plan shifts the risk to the employee as to whether the pension funds will grow to provide
for a reasonable pension payment upon retirement. With this type of plan, which gained popular-
ity during the 1980s, there is no problem estimating the company’s pension liability or pension
expense. Thus, defined contribution plans do not present major financial reporting problems.

A 401(k) is a type of defined contribution plan. Such a plan may or may not require a
company’s contribution. It may provide for an employee’s contribution. When a company
makes a required contribution, this ends any pension liability.
For firms with defined contribution plans, try to grasp the significance of these plans by
doing the following:
1. For a three-year period, compare pension expense with operating revenue. This will
indicate the materiality of pension expense in relation to operating revenue and the trend.
2. For a three-year period, compare pension expense with income before income taxes.
This will indicate the materiality of pension expense in relation to income and the trend.
3. Note any balance sheet items. (There will usually not be a balance sheet item because the
firm is paying on a pay-as-you-go basis.)
Nike – Note 13 – Benefit Plans (In Part)
The Company recognized $31 million, $24 million, and $18 million of selling and
administrative expense related to cash awards under” a Long-Term Incentive Plan
(LTIP) during the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
. . . . .
The Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only
available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to
the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $93 million and $113 million at May 31,
2011 and 2010, respectively, which was primarily classified as long-term in other liabilities.
. . . . .
The Company has various 401(k) employee savings plans available to U.S.-based employees.
The Company matches a portion of employee contributions. Company contributions to the
savings plans were $39 million, $34 million, and $38 million for the years ended May 31,
2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, and are included in selling and administrative expense.
The 401(k) employee savings plans expenses as a percentage of revenues were 0.19%,
0.18%, and 0.20% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Defined Benefit Plan
A defined benefit plan defines the benefits to be received by the participants in the plan.
For example, the plan may call for the participant to receive 40% of his or her average pay
for the three years before retirement. This type of plan leaves the company with the risk of
having insufficient funds in the pension fund to meet the defined benefit. This type of plan
was the predominant type of plan prior to the 1980s. Most companies still have a defined
benefit plan, partly because of the difficulties involved in switching to a defined contribu-
tion plan. Some companies have terminated their defined benefit plan by funding the obli-
gations of the plan and starting a defined contribution plan. In some cases, this has
resulted in millions of dollars being transferred to the company from the pension plan after
the defined benefit plan obligations have been met. The U.S. Congress added an excise tax
on “reversions” in 1990. This excise tax can be as high as 50%, thereby substantially
slowing down the “reversions.”
A number of assumptions about future events must be made regarding a defined benefit
plan. Some of these assumptions that relate to the future are interest rates, employee turn-
over, mortality rates, compensation, and pension benefits set by law. Assumptions about
future events contribute materially to the financial reporting problems in the pension area.
Two firms with the same plan may make significantly different assumptions, resulting in
major differences in pension expense and liability.
There are many technical terms associated with defined benefit plans. A description of
all of these terms is beyond the scope of this book.
For firms with defined benefit plans, try to grasp the significance of these plans by doing
the following:
1. For a three-year period, compare pension expense with operating revenue. This will
indicate the materiality of pension expense in relation to operating revenue and the trend.

2. For a three-year period, compare pension expense with income before income taxes.
This will indicate the materiality of pension expense in relation to income and the trend.
3. Compare the benefit obligations with the value of plan assets. This can indicate significant
underfunding or overfunding. Underfunding represents a potential liability. Overfunding
represents an opportunity to reduce future pension expense. Overfunding can also be used
to reduce related costs, such as disability benefits, retiree health costs, and staff
downsizings. Overfunding can also be used to take credits to the income statement.

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
Some benefits other than pensions, such as medical insurance and life insurance contracts,
accrue to employees upon retirement. These benefits can be substantial. Many firms have
obligations in the millions of dollars. Prior to 1993, most firms did not have these obliga-
tions funded; therefore, for these firms, a potential for a significant liability existed.

Beginning in 1993, firms were required to accrue, or set up a reserve for, future postre-
tirement benefits other than pensions (rather than deduct these costs when paid). Firms can
usually spread the catch-up accrual costs over 20 years or take the charge in one lump sum.
The amount involved is frequently material, so this choice can represent a major problem
when comparing the financial results of two or more firms. For some firms, the catch-up
charge for medical insurance was so material that it resulted in a deficit in retained earnings
or even a deficit to the entire shareholders’ equity section.
Many firms reduce costs by changing their plans to limit health care benefits to retirees
to a maximum fixed amount. This type of plan, in contrast to open-ended medical benefits,
could materially reduce the firm’s health care costs for retirees. Review the notes closely to
determine how the firm records health care costs for retirees.
For firms with postretirement benefits other than pensions, you should try to grasp the sig-
nificance using the same basic approach as was used for defined benefit plans for pensions.
Exhibit 7-9 shows selected items from the Vulcan Materials Company postretirement
benefits other than pensions. It also includes selected items from the statement of earnings
and the balance sheet.

Joint Ventures
A joint venture is an association of two or more businesses established for a special purpose.
Some joint ventures are in the form of partnerships or other unincorporated forms of busi-
ness. Others are in the form of corporations jointly owned by two or more other firms.
The accounting principles for joint ventures are flexible because of their many forms.
The typical problem concerns whether a joint venture should be carried as an investment or
consolidated. Some joint ventures are very significant in relation to the parent firm. There is

typically a question as to whether the parent firm has control or only significant influence.
When the parent firm has control, it usually consolidates joint ventures by using a pro-rata
share. Other joint ventures are usually carried in an investment account by using the equity
method. In either case, disclosure of significant information often appears in a note.
When a firm enters into a joint venture, it frequently makes commitments such as guar-
anteeing a bank loan for the joint venture or a long-term contract to purchase materials with
the joint venture. This type of action can give the company significant potential liabilities or
commitments that do not appear on the face of the balance sheet. This potential problem
exists with all joint ventures, including those that have been consolidated. To be aware of
these significant potential liabilities or commitments, read the note that relates to the joint
venture. Then consider this information in relation to the additional liabilities or commit-
ments to which the joint venture may commit the firm.

(5) Equity Method Investment
In the second quarter of 2009, the Company acquired a 50% interest in a joint venture, Hub Televi-
sion Networks, LLC (“THE HUB”, formerly known as DHJV company LLC), with Discovery Com-
munications, Inc. (“Discovery”). THE HUB, formerly known as the Discovery Kids Network, was
established to create a television network in the United States dedicated to high-quality children’s and
family entertainment and educational programming. The Company purchased its 50% share in THE
HUB for a payment of $300,000 and certain future payments based on the value of certain tax bene-
fits expected to be received by the Company. The present value of the expected future payments at
the acquisition date totaled approximately $67,900 and was recorded as a component of the Com-
pany’s investment in the joint venture. The balance of the associated liability, including imputed inter-
est, was $72,665 and $71,234 at December 26, 2010 and December 27, 2009, respectively, and is
included as a component of other liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet.
Voting control of the joint venture is shared 50/50 between the Company and Discovery. The
Company has determined that it does not meet the control requirements to consolidate the joint
venture, and accounts for the investment using the equity method of accounting. The Company’s
share in the earnings (loss) of the joint venture for the years ended December 26, 2010 and Decem-
ber 27, 2009 totaled $(9,323) of loss and $3,856 of earnings, respectively, and is included as a
component of other (income) expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
The Company has entered into a license agreement with the joint venture that will require the pay-
ment of royalties by the Company to the joint venture based on a percentage of revenue derived from
products related to television shows broadcast by the joint venture. The license agreement includes a
minimum royalty guarantee of $125,000, payable in 5 annual installments of $25,000 per year, com-
mencing in 2009, which can be earned out over approximately a 10 year period. During 2010 and
2009, the Company paid the first two annual installments of $25,000 each. The Company and the
joint venture are also parties to an agreement under which the Company will provide the joint venture
with an exclusive first look in the U.S. to license certain types of programming developed by the Com-
pany based on its intellectual property. In the event the joint venture licenses the programming from
the Company to air on the network, the joint venture is required to pay the Company a license fee.
As of December 26, 2010, the Company’s interest in the joint venture totaled $354,612 and is
a component of other assets. The Company enters into certain transactions with the joint venture
including the licensing of television programming and the purchase of advertising. During 2010
and 2009, these transactions were not material.

Contingencies
A contingency is an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncer-
tainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or
more future events occur or fail to occur.1
A contingency is characterized by an existing condition, uncertainty as to the ultimate
effect, and its resolution depending on one or more future events. A loss contingency should
be accrued if two conditions are met:2
1. Information prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an
asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements.
2. The amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
If a contingency loss meets one, but not both, of the criteria for recording and is, there-
fore, not accrued, disclosure by note is made when it is at least reasonably possible that there
has been an impairment of assets or that a liability has been incurred. Examples of contin-
gencies include warranty obligations and collectibility of receivables. If the firm guarantees
the indebtedness of others, the contingency is usually disclosed in a note.
When examining financial statements, a note that describes contingencies should be closely
reviewed for possible significant liabilities not disclosed on the face of the balance sheet.
The following covers gain contingencies:
1. Contingencies that might result in gains usually are not reflected in the accounts because
to do so might be to recognize revenue prior to its realization.
2. Adequate disclosure shall be made of contingencies that might result in gains, but care
shall be exercised to avoid misleading implications as to the likelihood of realization.3
The notes of the firm should be reviewed for gain contingencies. Exhibit 7-11 discusses
an income tax gain contingency for Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.
Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Financial
Instruments with Concentrations of Credit Risk

2. The nature and terms, including, at a minimum, a discussion of credit and market risk,
cash requirements, and accounting policies.4
Disclosure is also required of the following regarding financial instruments with off-
balance-sheet credit risk:
1. The amount of accounting loss the entity would incur if any party failed completely to
perform according to the terms of the contract and the collateral or other security, if
any, proved worthless.
2. The entity’s policy of requiring collateral and a brief description of the collateral it
currently holds.5
Accounting loss represents the worst-case loss if everything related to a contract went
wrong. This includes the possibility that a loss may occur from the failure of another party
to perform according to the terms of a contract, as well as the possibility that changes in
market prices may make a financial instrument less valuable or more troublesome.
In addition to requiring disclosure of matters relating to off-balance-sheet financial
instruments, disclosure is required of credit risk concentration. This disclosure includes infor-
mation on the extent of risk from exposures to individuals or groups of counterparties in the
same industry or region. The activity, region, or economic characteristic that identifies a con-
centration requires a narrative description. The provision of requiring disclosure of credit
risk concentration can be particularly significant to small companies. Examples are a retail
store whose receivables are substantially with local residents and a local bank with a loan
portfolio concentrated with debtors dependent on the local tourist business.
Exhibit 7-12 presents financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk and financial
instruments with concentrations of credit risk for Nordson Corporation as disclosed in its
2010 annual report.
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Disclosure is required about the fair value of financial instruments. This includes financial
instruments recognized and not recognized in the balance sheet (both assets and liabilities).
When estimating fair value is not practicable, then descriptive information pertinent to esti-
mating fair value should be disclosed.
The disclosure about fair value of financial instruments can be either in the body of the
financial statements or in the notes.6 This disclosure could possibly indicate significant op-
portunity or additional risk to the company. For example, long-term debt disclosed at a fair
value above the carrying amount increases the potential for a loss.

Note 9 – Financial instruments (In Part)
We operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, we are subject
to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currency transactions occur and the dates they are set-
tled. We regularly use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions. These contracts
usually have maturities of 90 days or less and generally require us to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. dollars at maturity, at rates
stated in the contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the
fair value of the hedges of balance sheet positions are recognized in each accounting period in “Other—net” on the Consolidated
Statement of Income together with the transaction gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. Gains of $7,970 and $3,817
were recognized from changes in fair value of these contracts in 2010 and 2009, respectively. A loss of $2,033 was recognized from
changes in fair value of these contracts in 2008. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

We used the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair value of financial instruments:
• Cash, cash equivalents and notes payable are valued at their carrying amounts due to the rela-
tively short period to maturity of the instruments.
• Marketable securities are valued at quoted market prices, which are considered to be Level 1
inputs under the fair value hierarchy.
• Long-term debt is valued by discounting future cash flows at currently available rates for bor-
rowing arrangements with similar terms and conditions, which are considered to be Level 2
inputs under the fair value hierarchy.
• Forward exchange contracts are estimated using quoted exchange rates, which are considered
to be Level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy.

Summary
This chapter covered two approaches to a firm’s long-term debt-paying ability. One approach considers the firm’s ability to
carry debt as indicated by the income statement, and the other approach views it as indicated by the balance sheet. The ratios
related to debt include the following:
Times Interest Earned ¼
Recurring Earnings, Excluding Interest
Expense, Tax Expense, Equity Earnings,
and Noncontrolling Interest
Interest Expense, Including Capitalized Interest
Fixed Charge Coverage ¼
Recurring Earnings, Excluding Interest Expense,
Tax Expense, Equity Earnings, and Noncontrolling

Questions
Q 7-1 Is profitability important to a firm’s long-term debt-
paying ability? Discuss.
Q 7-2 List the two approaches to examining a firm’s long-
term debt-paying ability. Discuss why each of these
approaches gives an important view of a firm’s ability to
carry debt.

P 7-7 For the year ended June 30, 2011, A.E.G. Enterprises presented the financial state-
ments below.
Early in the new fiscal year, the officers of the firm formalized a substantial expansion plan.
The plan will increase fixed assets by $190 million. In addition, extra inventory will be needed
to support expanded production. The increase in inventory is purported to be $10 million.
The firm’s investment bankers have suggested the following three alternative financing plans:
Plan A: Sell preferred stock at par, 5%.
Plan B: Sell common stock at $10 per share.
Plan C: Sell long-term bonds, due in 20 years, at par ($1,000), with a stated interest rate
of 8%.

Assets acquired under capital leases, net of accumulated depreciation, were $1.6 million and $2.0
million at August 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively. If the assets acquired under capital leases
transfer title at the end of the lease term or contain a bargain purchase option, the assts are amor-
tized over their estimated useful lives; otherwise, the assets are amortized over the respective lease
term. Depreciation expense of $59.8 million, $52.3 million, and $43.7 million for the fiscal years
ended August 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, is included in cost of revenues and general
and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
At August 31, 2010, construction in progress consisted primarily of deposits on heavy
equipment to be used on some of our power projects. At August 31, 2009, construction in
progress consisted primarily of cost related to the construction of our module fabrication
and assembly facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana.
In fiscal year 2009, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $5.5 million for a con-
solidated joint venture. The impairment charge reduced the property, plant, and equipment
to its salvage value.

Note 13 – Operating Leases
We lease certain office buildings, fabrication and warehouse facilities, machinery, and equip-
ment under various lease arrangements. Leases that do not qualify as capital leases are classi-
fied as operating leases and the related lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis
over the lease term, including, as applicable, any free-rent period during which we have the
right to use the asset. For leases with renewal options where the renewal is reasonably
assured, the lease term, including the renewal period, is used to determine the appropriate
lease classification and to compute periodic rental expense.
Certain of our operating lease agreements are non-cancelable and expire at various times
and require various minimum rentals. The non-cancelable operating leases with initial non-
cancelable periods in excess of twelve months that were in effect as of August 31, 2010,
require us to make the following estimated future payments:

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

In 2002, we entered into a 10-year non-cancelable operating lease for our Corporate
Headquarters building in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In connection with this lease, we pur-
chased an option for $12.2 million for the right to acquire additional office space and unde-
veloped land for approximately $150 million. The option expires the earlier of January
2012, or upon renewal of the existing Corporate Headquarters lease. The cost of the option
is included in other assets. The book value of the option is assessed for impairment annually
based on appraisals of the additional office space and undeveloped land subject to the
option. If we renew the lease rather than exercise the option, the option value will be
expensed over the term of the new Corporate Headquarters building lease.
We also enter into lease agreements for equipment needed to fulfill the requirements of
specific jobs. Any payments owed or committed under these lease arrangements as of August
31, 2010, are not included as part of total minimum lease payments shown above.
The total rental expense for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008
was approximately $178.8 million, $178.1 million, and $170.6 million, respectively.
Deferred rent payable (current and long-term) aggregated $32.0 million and $30.3 million at
August 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Required
a. For August 31, 2010:
1. What was the gross amount for property and equipment?
2. What was the net amount for property and equipment?
3. What was the gross amount for assets acquired under capital leases?
4. What was the net amount for assets acquired under capital leases?
5. How material are assets acquired under capital leases in relation to total property and
equipment?
b. How material are capital lease obligations in relation to total debt and revolving lines of
credit at August 31, 2010?
c. Operating leases:
1. What was the total future minimum lease payments as of August 31, 2010?
2. Using two-thirds of future minimum lease payments representing principal, what
would be the estimate for principal at August 31, 2010?
3. How material are operating leases in relation to capital leases?

annual report:
Note G—Commitments and Contingencies (in Part)
National Basketball Association (“NBA”) players, including those that play for the Boston
Celtics, are covered by a collective bargaining agreement between the NBA and the NBA Play-
ers Association (the “NBPA”) that was to be in effect through June 30, 2001 (the “Collective
Bargaining Agreement”). Under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the NBA
had the right to terminate the Collective Bargaining Agreement after the 1997–1998 season if it

was determined that the aggregate salaries and benefits paid by all NBA teams for the 1997–
1998 season exceeded 51.8% of projected Basketball Related Income, as defined in the Collec-
tive Bargaining Agreement (“BRI”). Effective June 30, 1998, the Board of Governors of the
NBA voted to exercise that right and reopen the Collective Bargaining Agreement, as it had
been determined that the aggregate salaries and benefits paid by the NBA teams for the 1997–
1998 season would exceed 51.8% of projected BRI. Effective July 1, 1998, the NBA com-
menced a lockout of NBA players in support of its attempt to reach a new collective bargaining
agreement. The NBA and the NBPA have been engaged in negotiations regarding a new collec-
tive bargaining agreement, but as of September 18, 1998, no agreement has been reached. In
the event that the lockout extends into the 1998–1999 season, NBA teams, including the Bos-
ton Celtics, will refund amounts paid by season ticket holders (plus interest) for any games that
are canceled as a result of the lockout. In addition, as a result of the lockout, NBA teams have
not made any payments due to players with respect to the 1998–1999 season. The NBPA has
disputed the NBA’s position on this matter, and both the NBA and the NBPA have presented
their cases to an independent arbitrator, who will make his ruling no later than the middle of
October 1998. As of September 18, 1998, the arbitrator has not ruled on this matter.
Although the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, any loss of
games as a result of the absence of a collective bargaining agreement or the continuation of the
lockout will have a material adverse effect on the Partnership’s financial condition and its results
of operations. Further, if NBA teams, including the Boston Celtics, are required to honor the
player contracts for the 1998–99 season and beyond without agreeing to a new collective bargain-
ing agreement or without ending the lockout, which would result in the loss of games, the Partner-
ship’s financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.
The Partnership has employment agreements with officers, coaches and players of the
basketball team (Celtics Basketball). Certain of the contracts provide for guaranteed pay-
ments which must be paid even if the employee is injured or terminated. Amounts required
to be paid under such contracts in effect as of September 18, 1998, including option years
and $8,100,000 included in accrued expenses at June 30, 1998, but excluding deferred com-
pensation commitments disclosed in Note E—Deferred Compensation, are as follows:
Years ending June 30, 1999
$32,715,000
2000
33,828,000
2001
27,284,000
2002
20,860,000
2003
19,585,000
2004 and thereafter

Commitments for the year ended June 30, 1999, include payments due to players under
contracts for the 1998–1999 season in the amount of $18,801,000, which are currently not
being paid as a result of the lockout described above.
Celtics Basketball maintains disability and life insurance policies on most of its key play-
ers. The level of insurance coverage maintained is based on management’s determination of
the insurance proceeds which would be required to meet its guaranteed obligations in the
event of permanent or total disability of its key players.
Required Discuss how to incorporate the contingency note into an analysis of Celtics Basket-
ball Holdings, L.P. and Subsidiary.

These multi-employer retirement plans are generally defined benefit plans and are pursuant
to agreements between the Company and various unions. In many cases, specific benefit lev-
els are not negotiated with contributing employers or in some cases even known by contrib-
uting employers. Contributions of $292.3 million in 2010, $278.1 million in 2009 and
$286.9 million in 2008 were made and charged to expense.
Required
a. What were the contributions to multi-employer plans for 2010, 2009 and 2008?
Comment on the trend.
b. Determine the total liability for multi-employer pension plans at the end of 2010.
c. What control does Safeway Inc. have over multi-employer pension plans?

SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES*
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (In Part)
Note K: Employee Benefit Plans and Collective Bargaining Agreements (In part)
Pension Plans
The Company maintains defined benefit, non-contributory retirement plans for substantially
all of its employees not participating in multi-employer pension plans. Safeway recognizes
the funded status of its retirement plans on its consolidated balance sheet.
Other Post-Retirement Benefits
In addition to the Company’s pension plans, the Company sponsors plans that provide post-
retirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees. Retirees share a portion
of the cost of the postretirement medical plans. Safeway pays all the costs of the life insur-
ance plans. The Company also sponsors a Retirement Restoration Plan that provides death
benefits and supplemental income payments for senior executives after retirement. All of
these Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans are unfunded.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the retirement plans’ benefit
obligation and fair value of assets over the two-year period ended January 1, 2011 and a state-
ment of the funded status as of year-end 2010 and year-end 2009. Activity for 2009 includes the
removal of the Canadian money purchase plan which had been previously presented within the
table but has since been determined to be a defined contribution plan (in millions):

CASE 7-9 READY-TO-EAT
KELLOGG COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES*
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In Part)
Note 11 Derivative Instruments and Fair Value Measurements (In Part)
Credit risk concentration
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on
derivative financial and commodity contracts. Management believes a concentration of
credit risk with respect to derivative counterparties is limited due to the credit ratings of the
counterparties and the use of master netting and reciprocal collateralization agreements.
Master netting agreements apply in situations where the Company executes multiple con-
tracts with the same counterparty. Certain counterparties represent a concentration of credit risk
to the Company. If those counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of derivative con-
tracts, this would result in a loss to the Company of $50 million as of January 1, 2011.
For certain derivative contracts, reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterpar-
ties call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of credit
if a fair value loss position to the Company or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount.
There were no collateral balance requirements at January 1, 2011.
Management believes concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
limited due to the generally high credit quality of the Company’s major customers, as well as
the large number and geographic dispersion of smaller customers. However, the Company
conducts a disproportionate amount of business with a small number of large multinational
grocery retailers, with the five largest accounts encompassing approximately 30% of consoli-
dated trade receivables at January 1, 2011.
Required
a. In some situations, the company executes multiple contracts with the same counterparty.
Indicate the loss as of January 1, 2011 if those counterparties fail to perform according
to the terms of derivative contracts.
b. What were the collateral balance requirements at January 1, 2011?
c. The company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties
on derivative financial and commodity contracts. Why does management believe the risk
is limited?
d. Why does management believe that concentrations of credit risk with respect to
accounts receivable is limited?

Chapter
8
Profitability
P
rofitability is the ability of a firm to generate earnings. Analysis of profit is of vital
concern to stockholders because they derive revenue in the form of dividends. Further,
increased profits can cause a rise in market price, leading to capital gains. Profits are
also important to creditors because profits are one source of funds for debt coverage. Man-
agement uses profit as a performance measure.
In profitability analysis, absolute figures are less meaningful than earnings measured as
a percentage of a number of bases: the productive assets, the owners’ and creditors’ capital
employed, and sales.
Profitability Measures
The income statement contains several figures that might be used in profitability analysis. In
general, the primary financial analysis of profit ratios should include only the types of
income arising from the normal operations of the business. This excludes the following:
1. Discontinued operations
2. Extraordinary items
Exhibit 4-3 in Chapter 4 illustrates an income statement with these items. Review this
section on special income statement items in Chapter 4 before continuing with the discussion
of profitability. Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated subsidiaries and the noncontrolling in-
terest share of earnings are also important to the analysis of profitability. Chapter 4 covers
these items, and Exhibits 4-5 and 4-9 illustrate the concepts.
Trend analysis should also consider only income arising from the normal operations
of the business. An illustration will help justify this reasoning. XYZ Corporation had net
income of $100,000 in Year 1 and $150,000 in Year 2. Year 2, however, included an
extraordinary gain of $60,000. In reality, XYZ suffered a drop in profit from operating
income.

Net Profit Margin
A commonly used profit measure is return on sales, often termed net profit margin. If a com-
pany reports that it earned 6% last year, this statistic usually means that its profit was 6%
of sales. Calculate net profit margin as follows:
Net Profit Margin ¼
Net Income Before Noncontrolling Interest,
Equity Income and Nonrecurring Items
Net Sales
This ratio gives a measure of net income dollars generated by each dollar of sales.
Although it is desirable for this ratio to be high, competitive forces within an industry, eco-
nomic conditions, use of debt financing, and operating characteristics such as high fixed
costs will cause the net profit margin to vary between and within industries.
Exhibit8-1showsthenetprofitmarginusingthe2011and2010figuresforNike.Thisanalysis
shows that Nike’s net profit margin increased slightly in 2011,but would still be considered high.
Several refinements to the net profit margin ratio can make it more accurate than the ra-
tio computation in this book. Numerator refinements include removing “other income” and
“other expense” items from net income. These items do not relate to net sales (denominator).
Therefore, they can cause a distortion in the net profit margin.
This book does not adjust the net profit margin ratio for these items because this often
requires an advanced understanding of financial statements beyond the level intended. Also,
this chapter covers operating income margin, operating asset turnover, and return on operat-
ing assets. These ratios provide a look at the firm’s operations.
When working the problems in this book, do not remove “other income” or “other
expense” when computing the net profit margin unless otherwise instructed by the problem.
In other analyses, if you elect to refine a net profit margin computation by removing “other
income” or “other expense” items from net income, remove them net of the firm’s tax rate.
This is a reasonable approximation of the tax effect.
If you do not refine a net profit margin computation for “other income” and “other
expense” items, at least observe whether the company has a net “other income” or a net
“other expense.” A net “other income” distorts the net profit margin on the high side, while
a net “other expense” distorts the profit margin on the low side.
The Nike statement can be used to illustrate the removal of items that do not relate to
net sales. Exhibit 8-2 shows the net profit margin computed with these items removed for
2011 and 2010. The adjusted computation results in the 2011 net profit margin being
decreased by 0.10% and the 2010 net profit margin decrease by 0.17%. Both of these
decreases are likely to be considered immaterial.
Total Asset Turnover
Total asset turnover measures the activity of the assets and the ability of the firm to generate
sales through use of the assets. Compute total asset turnover as follows:
Total Asset Turnover ¼
Net Sales
Average Total Assets

Exhibit 8-3 shows total asset turnover for Nike for 2011 and 2010. The total asset turn-
over increased from 1.37 to 1.42. This increase would be considered to be moderate.
The total asset turnover computation has refinements that relate to assets (denominator)
but do not relate to net sales (numerator). Examples would be the exclusion of investments
and construction in progress. This book does not make these refinements. This chapter cov-
ers operating income margin, operating asset turnover, and return on operating assets.
If the refinements are not made, observe the investment account, Construction in Progress,
and other assets that do not relate to net sales. The presence of these accounts distorts the total
asset turnover on the low side. (Actual turnover is better than the computation indicates.)
Return on Assets
Return on assets measures the firm’s ability to utilize its assets to create profits by comparing
profits with the assets that generate the profits. Compute the return on assets as follows:
Return on Assets ¼ Net Income Before Noncontrolling Interest and Nonrecurring Items
Average Total Assets
Exhibit 8-4 shows the 2011 and 2010 return on assets for Nike. The return on total
assets for Nike increased moderately in 2011.

Theoretically, the best average would be based on month-end figures, which are not
available to the outside user. Computing an average based on beginning and ending figures
provides a rough approximation that does not consider the timing of interim changes in
assets. Such changes might be related to seasonal factors.
However, even a simple average based on beginning and ending amounts requires two
figures. Ratios for two years require three years of balance sheet data. Since an annual
report only contains two balance sheets, obtaining the data for averages may be a prob-
lem. If so, ending balance sheet figures may be used consistently instead of averages for ra-
tio analysis. Similar comments could be made about other ratios that utilize balance sheet
figures.
DuPont Return on Assets
Net profit margin, total asset turnover, and return on assets are usually reviewed together
because of the direct influence that the net profit margin and the total asset turnover have on
return on assets. This book reviews these ratios together; when reviewed together, they are
collectively termed the DuPont return on assets.
The rate of return on assets can be broken down into two component ratios: the net
profit margin and the total asset turnover. These ratios allow for improved analysis of
changes in the return on assets percentage. E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Company devel-
oped this method of separating the rate of return ratio into its component parts. Compute
the DuPont return on assets as follows:
Net Income Before
Noncontrolling Interest
and Nonrecurring Items
Average Total Assets
¼
Net Income Before
Noncontrolling Interest
and Nonrecurring Items
Net Sales
×
Net Sales
Average Total Assets
Exhibit 8-5 shows the DuPont return on assets for Nike for 2011 and 2010. Separating
the ratio into the two elements allows for discussion of the causes for the increase in the per-
centage of return on assets. This exhibit indicates that Nike’s return on assets increased both
because of an increase in net profit margin and an increase in total asset turnover.

Example 2 shows how a trend in return on assets can be better explained through the break-
down into two ratios. The two firms have identical returns on assets. Further analysis shows
that Firm A suffers from a slowdown in asset turnover. It is generating fewer sales for the
assets invested. Firm B suffers from a reduction in the net profit margin. It is generating less
profit per dollar of sales.
Variation in Computation of DuPont Ratios Considering Only
Operating Accounts
It is often argued that only operating assets should be considered in the return on asset calcu-
lation. Operating assets exclude construction in progress, long-term investments, intangibles,
and the other assets category from total assets. Similarly, operating income—the profit gen-
erated by manufacturing, merchandising, or service functions—that equals net sales less the
cost of sales and operating expenses should also be used instead of net income.
The DuPont analysis, considering only operating accounts, requires a computation of
operating income and operating assets. Exhibit 8-6 shows the computations of operating
income and operating assets for Nike. This includes operating income for 2011 and 2010
and operating assets for 2011, 2010, and 2009.
The operating ratios may give significantly different results from net earnings ratios if a
firm has large amounts of nonoperating assets. For example, if a firm has heavy investments
in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and if these subsidiaries pay large dividends, then other
income may be a large portion of net earnings. The profit picture may not be as good if these
earnings from other sources are eliminated by analyzing operating ratios. Since earnings
from investments are not derived from the primary business, the lower profit figures that
represent normal earnings will typically be more meaningful.
Operating Income Margin
The operating income margin includes only operating income in the numerator. Compute
the operating income margin as follows:
Operating Income Margin ¼ Operating Income
Net Sales
Exhibit 8-7 indicates the operating income margin for Nike in 2011 and 2010. It shows
a moderate increase in 2011 in the operating income margin percentage.

Operating Asset Turnover
This ratio measures the ability of operating assets to generate sales dollars. Compute operat-
ing asset turnover as follows:
Operating Asset Turnover ¼
Net Sales
Average Operating Assets
Exhibit 8-8 shows the operating asset turnover for Nike in 2011 and 2010. It indicates a
moderate increase from 2010 to 2011. This moderate increase is similar to the moderate
increase in total asset turnover.
Return on Operating Assets
Adjusting for nonoperating items results in the following formula for return on operating
assets:
Return on Operating Assets ¼
Operating Income
Average Operating Assets

The return on operating assets can be viewed in terms of the DuPont analysis that
follows:
DuPont Return on Operating Assets ¼ Operating Income Margin × Operating Asset Turnover
Exhibit 8-10 indicates the DuPont return on operating assets for Nike for 2011 and
2010. This figure supports the conclusion that a minor increase in operating income margin
and a moderate increase in operating asset turnover resulted in a moderate increase in return
on operating assets.

Sales to Fixed Assets
This ratio measures the firm’s ability to make productive use of its property, plant, and
equipment by generating sales dollars. Since construction in progress does not contribute to
current sales, it should be excluded from net fixed assets. This ratio may not be meaningful
because of old fixed assets or a labor-intensive industry. In these cases, the ratio is substan-
tially higher because of the low fixed asset base. Compute the sales to fixed assets as follows:
Sales to Fixed Assets ¼
Net Sales
Average Net Fixed Assets (Exclude Construction in Progress)
Exhibit 8-11 shows the sales to fixed assets for Nike for 2011 and 2010. It increased moder-
ately between 2010 and 2011. Sales increases more than kept up with net fixed assets increases.
Return on Investment (ROI)
The return on investment (ROI) applies to ratios measuring the income earned on the
invested capital. These types of measures are widely used to evaluate enterprise performance.
Since return on investment is a type of return on capital, this ratio measures the ability of the
firm to reward those who provide long-term funds and to attract providers of future funds.
Compute the return on investment as follows:
Return on Investment ¼
Net Income Before Noncontrolling Interest and Nonrecurring Items
þ ½ðInterest ExpenseÞ × ð1 & Tax RateÞ'
Average ðLong-Term Liabilities þ EquityÞ
This ratio evaluates the earnings performance of the firm without regard to the way the
investment is financed. It measures the earnings on investment and indicates how well the
firm utilizes its asset base. Exhibit 8-12 shows the return on investment for Nike for 2011
and 2010. This ratio increased moderately between 2010 and 2011.
Return on Total Equity
The return on total equity measures the return to both common and preferred stockholders.
Compute the return on total equity as follows:
Return on Total Equity ¼
Net Income Before Nonrecurring Items &
Dividends on Redeemable Preferred Stock
Average Total Equity
Preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption is termed redeemable preferred stock.
The SEC requires that redeemable preferred stock be categorized separately from other eq-
uity securities because the shares must be redeemed in a manner similar to the repayment of
debt. Most companies do not have redeemable preferred stock. For those firms that do, the
redeemable preferred stock is excluded from total equity and considered part of debt.

Similarly, the dividends must be deducted from income. They have not been deducted on the
income statement, despite the similarity to debt and interest, because they are still dividends
and payable only if declared.

The net income appears on the income statement. The preferred dividends appear most
commonly on the statement of stockholders’ equity. Common equity includes common
capital stock and retained earnings less common treasury stock. This amount equals total
equity minus the preferred capital and any noncontrolling interest included in the equity
section.
Exhibit 8-14 shows the return on common equity for Nike for 2011 and 2010. Nike’s
return on common equity is the same as its return on total equity.
The Relationship Between Profitability Ratios
Technically, a ratio with a profit figure in the numerator and some type of “supplier of
funds” figure in the denominator is a type of return on investment. Another frequently used
measure is a variation of the return on total assets. Compute this return on total assets varia-
tion as follows:
Return on Total Assets Variation ¼ Net Income þ Interest Expense
Average Total Assets
This ratio includes the return to all suppliers of funds, both long- and short-term, by
both creditors and investors. It differs from the return on assets ratio previously discussed
because it adds back the interest. It differs from the return on investment in that it does not
adjust interest for the income tax effect, it includes short-term funds, and it uses the average
investment. It will not be discussed or utilized further here because it does not lend itself to
DuPont analysis.
Rates of return have been calculated on a variety of bases. The interrelationship
between these ratios is of importance in understanding the return to the suppliers of funds.
Exhibit 8-15 displays a comparison of profitability measures for Nike.
The return on assets measures the return to all providers of funds since total assets equal
total liabilities and equity. This ratio will usually be the lowest since it includes all of the
assets. The return on investment measures the return to long-term suppliers of funds, and it
is usually higher than the return on assets because of the relatively low amount paid for
short-term funds. This is especially true of accounts payable.
The rate of return on total equity will usually be higher than the return on investment
because the rate of return on equity measures return only to the shareholders. A profitable
use of long-term sources of funds from creditors provides a higher return to shareholders
than the return on investment. In other words, the profits made on long-term funds from
creditors were greater than the interest paid for use of the funds.

Common stockholders absorb the greatest degree of risk and, therefore, usually earn the
highest return. For the return on common equity to be the highest, the return on funds
obtained from preferred stockholders must be more than the funds paid to the preferred
stockholders. For Nike the return on total equity and the return on common equity are the
same because they do not have preferred equity.
Gross Profit Margin
Gross profit equals the difference between net sales revenue and the cost of goods sold. The
cost of goods sold is the beginning inventory plus purchases minus the ending inventory. It is
the cost of the product sold during the period. Changes in the cost of goods sold, which rep-
resents such a large expense for merchandising and manufacturing firms, can have a substan-
tial impact on the profit for the period. Comparing gross profit with net sales is termed the
gross profit margin. Compute the gross profit margin as follows:
Gross Profit Margin ¼ Gross Profit
Net Sales
This ratio should then be compared with industry data or analyzed by trend analysis.
Exhibit 8-16 illustrates trend analysis. In this illustration, the gross profit margin has
declined substantially over the three-year period. This could be attributable to a number of
factors:
1. The cost of buying inventory has increased more rapidly than have selling prices.
2. Selling prices have declined due to competition.
3. The mix of goods has changed to include more products with lower margins.
4. Theft is occurring. If sales are not recorded, the cost of goods sold figure in relation to
the sales figure is very high. If inventory is being stolen, the ending inventory will be low
and the cost of goods sold will be high.
Gross profit margin analysis helps a number of users. Managers budget gross profit lev-
els into their predictions of profitability. Gross profit margins are also used in cost control.
Estimations utilizing gross profit margins can determine inventory levels for interim

statements in the merchandising industries. Gross profit margins can also be used to estimate
inventory involved in insured losses. In addition, gross profit measures are used by auditors
and the Internal Revenue Service to judge the accuracy of accounting systems.
Gross profit margin analysis requires an income statement in multiple-step format. Oth-
erwise, the gross profit must be computed, which is the case with Nike. Exhibit 8-17 presents
Nike’s gross profit margin, which decreased slightly in 2011 after increasing moderately in
2010.
Trends in Profitability
Exhibit 8-18 shows profitability trends for manufacturing for the period 1975–2010. Oper-
ating profit compared with net sales and net income compared with net sales both fluctuated
substantially over this period. Net income compared with net sales fluctuated substantially.
Notice the material decline in this ratio in 1992 and 2001 and the substantial increase in this
ratio for 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006, followed by a substantial decrease in 2007, and then
a material decrease in 2008.

Segment Reporting
A public business enterprise reports financial and descriptive information about report-
able operating segments. Operating segments are segments about which separate financial
information is available that is evaluated by the chief operating decision maker in decid-
ing how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. It requires information about
the countries in which the firm earns revenues and holds assets, as well as about major
customers.
Descriptive information must be disclosed about the way the operating segments
were determined. Disclosure is required for products and services by the operating seg-
ments. Disclosure is also required about the differences between the measurements used
in reporting segment information and those used in the firm’s general-purpose financial
information.
Segment data can be analyzed in terms of both trends and ratios. Vertical and horizontal
common-size analyses can be used for trends. Examples of ratios would be relating profits to
sales or identifiable assets.
Segment trends would be of interest to management and investors. The maximum bene-
fits from this type of analysis come when analyzing a nonintegrated company in terms of
product lines, especially with segments of relatively similar size.
Nike reported operating segments and related information in Note 18, which is partially
included in Exhibit 8-19. These data should be reviewed, and consideration should be given
to using vertical and horizontal analyses and to computing ratios that appear meaningful.
This type of review is illustrated in Exhibits 8-20 and 8-21.
Exhibit 8-20 presents some Nike information in vertical common-size analysis. Revenue,
earnings before interest and taxes, additions to long-lived assets and property, plant and
equipment, net are included.
Based on revenue, the North America segment is the dominant segment, followed by
Western Europe, and then emerging markets. There was a material increase in emerging
markets. Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe and Japan all had material decreases.
Earnings before interest and taxes changed materially by segment. Material increases
were in North America, greater China, and emerging markets. Material decreases were in
Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe, and Japan.
Additions to long-lived assets were dominant in North America, Western Europe, and
greater China. Nominal additions were in Central & Eastern Europe and Japan.
Material property, plant and equipment, net were in North America, Western Europe,
and Japan. Immaterial property, plant and equipment, net were in Central & Eastern
Europe, and emerging markets.
A review of Exhibit 8-21 (segment information – ratio analysis) indicates that the most
profitable segment (based on earnings before interest and taxes/revenue) was greater in
China and that profits had increased in this segment.
Revenues by Major Product Lines
Exhibit 8-22 shows revenues by major product lines presented by Nike. Revenues by Major
Product Lines—Horizontal Common-Size Analysis is presented in Exhibit 8-23. Footwear is
the dominate segment representing over half the revenues. The fastest growth was experi-
enced in the other segment.
Gains and Losses from Prior Period Adjustments
Prior period adjustments result from certain changes in accounting principles, the realization
of income tax benefits of preacquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased subsidia-
ries, a change in accounting entity, and corrections of errors in prior periods. Prior period
adjustments are charged to retained earnings.

These items are a type of gain or loss, but they never go through the income state-
ment. They are not recognized on the income statement. If material, they should be con-
sidered in analysis. Current period ratios would not be revised because these items relate
to prior periods.
A review of the retained earnings account presented in the statement of stockholders’ eq-
uity will reveal prior period adjustments.
Exhibit 8-24 presents a prior period adjustment of the Standard Register Company.
Comprehensive Income
Chapter 4 explained that the categories within accumulated other income are: (1) foreign
currency translation adjustments, (2) unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-
sale marketable securities, (3) changes to stockholders’ equity resulting from additional mini-
mum pension liability adjustments, and (4) unrealized gains and losses from derivative
instruments.
There has been considerable flexibility in reporting comprehensive income. One format
used a single income statement to report net income and comprehensive income. A second
format reported comprehensive income in a separate statement of financial activity. A third
format reported comprehensive income within the statement of changes in shareholders’
equity.
Most companies selected the third format reporting comprehensive income within the
statement of changes in shareholders’ equity. Nike selected this third format for its May 31,
2011 financial statements.

Prior Period Adjustment
The Standard Register Company included this information in its financial statements for the year
ended December 28, 2008.
Note: In addition to the note, the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity disclosed the
cumulative effect of restatement in prior years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In Part)
(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
NOTE 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (In Part)
Prior Period Adjustment
During 2008, we discovered an error on our 2004 income tax return related to the classification
of gains reported on the sale of a business unit. The error in classification caused us not to
utilize
capital
loss
carryforwards
available
on
our
2004
tax
return.
The
capital
loss
carryforward available to the Company was included in our deferred tax assets with a full
valuation allowance in 2004. As a result of this error, we understated our deferred tax
assets and income tax benefit by $1,420 in 2004. An amended return was filed in 2008.
For financial reporting purposes, this error has been accounted for as a prior period adjustment
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 154, “Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections.” We do not believe that any of our prior period financial
statements were materially misstated as a result of not adjusting our deferred tax assets as
described above. We have restated the December 30, 2007, balance sheet and the Statement of
Shareholders’ Equity for 2006 and 2007 to appropriately reflect the deferred tax asset. The effect
of the restatement on periods prior to 2006 has been recorded as an adjustment of $1,420 to
beginning retained earnings.

Nike reported four items in comprehensive income in its 2011 financial report. These
items were as follows:
(in millions)
Other comprehensive income (Notes 14 and 17):
Foreign currency translation and other (net of tax expense of $121)
263
Net loss on cash flow hedges (net of tax benefit of $66)
(242)
Net loss on net investment hedges (net of tax benefit of $28)
(57)
Reclassification to net income of previously deferred net gains related to
hedge derivatives (net of tax expense of $24)
(84)
Total comprehensive income
(120)
Note that comprehensive income includes items not in net income. Our traditional prof-
itability analysis includes items that related to net income. This excludes other comprehen-
sive income items. Ratios in which you may want to consider including comprehensive
income are: (1) return on assets, (2) return on investment, (3) return on total equity, and
(4) return on common equity. For some firms, these ratios will change materially.
For Nike, the change to these ratios for 2011 would not be material as net income was
$2,133,000,000 and net comprehensive loss was $120,000,000.
In Chapter 4, it was indicated that the FASB and IASB entered into a joint project to
improve the presentation of comprehensive income in a manner that is as convergent as pos-
sible. At that time, the IFRS only provided for comprehensive income to be presented either
in a single statement or in two consecutive statements.
The result of this joint project was that the FASB in 2011 issued an amendment of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification which ruled out the option of reporting compre-
hensive income within the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity.
Thus with the effective fiscal year after December 15, 2011, only the following options
are available:
1. A single income statement reporting net income and comprehensive income, or
2. Report comprehensive income in a separate statement immediately following the
statement of income
This new standard is effective for interim periods. The coverage of comprehensive
income in analysis is in Chapter 12.
Pro-Forma Financial Information
Pro-forma financial information is a hypothetical or projected amount. Synonymous with
“what if” analysis, pro-forma data indicate what would have happened under specified
circumstances.
Used properly, pro-forma financial information makes a positive contribution to finan-
cial reporting—for example, what would be the net income if additional shares were issued?
Used improperly, pro-forma financial information can be a negative contribution to finan-
cial reporting. For example, releasing pro-forma earnings can be misleading if not explained.
It became popular in the United States for companies to release pro-forma earnings at
approximately the time that financial results were released that used GAAP. Typically, how
the company arrived at the pro-forma earnings was not adequately disclosed. It was inferred
that this was the better number for investors to follow. Many investors did make decisions
based on the pro-forma earnings as opposed to the GAAP earnings.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act required the Commission (SEC) to adopt rules requiring that if
a company publicly discloses non-GAAP financial measures or includes them in a Commis-
sion filing:
1. The company must reconcile those non-GAAP financial measures to a company’s
financial condition and results of operations under GAAP.
2. Any public disclosure of a non-GAAP financial measure may not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the non-GAAP financial measure, in light of circumstances under which it is presented,
not misleading.1

A June 2004 article in Accounting Horizons compared S&P Companies’ own reported
earnings data (pro forma) with U.S. GAAP net income, 1990–2003. In each year, the
pro-forma earnings were higher. In some years, the pro-forma earnings were materially more
than the U.S. GAAP net income.2
The Wall Street Journal made the following comment in a September 2003 article:
If you thought the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that sweeping package of overhauls adopted in
response to U.S. corporate scandals, got rid of the “pro forma”-like tactics by which
companies were able to make their earnings look better, you thought wrong.3
One example in the article was “Sanmina-SCI Corp., which strips restructuring costs
out of its GAAP earnings to help reach its pro-forma earnings—and has done so every quar-
ter for the past 2 1/2 years. ‘Restructuring’ costs might seem to imply a one-time event, but
Sanmina has stripped out restructuring costs in each of its last 10 quarters, back to 2001.”4

Interim Reports
Interim reports are an additional source of information on profitability. These are reports
that cover fiscal periods of less than one year. The SEC requires that limited financial data
be provided on Form 10-Q. The SEC also requires that these companies disclose certain
quarterly information in notes to the annual report.
The same reporting principles used for annual reports should be employed for interim
reports, with the intent that the interim reporting be an integral part of the annual report. For
interim financial reports, timeliness of data offsets lack of detail. Some data included are:
1. Income statement amounts:
a. Sales or gross revenues
b. Provision for income taxes
c. Extraordinary items and tax effect
d. Cumulative effect of an accounting change
e. Net income
2. Earnings per share
3. Seasonal information
4. Significant changes in income tax provision or estimate
5. Disposal of segments of business and unusual items material to the period
6. Contingent items
7. Changes in accounting principles or estimates
8. Significant changes in financial position
Interim reports contain more estimates in the financial data than in the annual reports. In-
terim reports are also unaudited. For these reasons, they are less reliable than annual reports.
Income tax expense is an example of a figure that can require considerable judgment
and estimation for the interim period. The objective with the interim income tax expense is
to use an annual effective tax rate, which may require considerable estimation. Some reasons
for this are foreign tax credits and the tax effect of losses in an interim period.
Interim statements must disclose the seasonal nature of the firm’s activities. It is also recom-
mended that firms that are seasonal in nature supplement their interim report by including in-
formation for 12-month periods ended at the interim date for the current and preceding years.
Interim statements can help the analyst determine trends and identify trouble areas
before the year-end report is available. The information obtained (such as a lower profit
margin) may indicate that trouble is brewing.
Nike included a section called “Selected Quarterly Financial Data” in its annual reports.
It indicates that it’s fourth fiscal quarter had the highest volume and was most profitable.
This would be the months of March, April, and May. Revenue was up in each quarter com-
pared to the prior year, especially in the 4th quarter. Profits were up also in each quarter
compared to the prior year, especially in the 2nd quarter.

Summary
Profitability is the ability of a firm to generate earnings. It is measured relative to a number of bases, such as assets, sales, and
investment.
The ratios related to profitability covered in this chapter follow:
Net Profit Margin ¼
Net Income Before Noncontrolling Interest,
Equity Income and Nonrecurring Items
Net Sales
Total Asset Turnover ¼

Questions
Q 8-1 Profits might be compared with sales, assets, or
stockholders’ equity. Why might all three bases be used? Will
trends in these ratios always move in the same direction?
Q 8-2 What is the advantage of segregating extraordinary
items in the income statement?
Q 8-3 If profits as a percent of sales decline, what can be
said about expenses?
Q 8-4 Would you expect the profit margin in a quality
jewelry store to differ from that of a grocery store?

Q 8-5 The ratio return on assets has net income in the
numerator and total assets in the denominator. Explain
how each part of the ratio could cause return on assets to
fall.
Q 8-6 What is the DuPont analysis, and how does it aid in
financial analysis?
Q 8-7 How
does
operating
income
differ from net
income? How do operating assets differ from total assets?
What is the advantage in removing nonoperating items
from the DuPont analysis?
Q 8-8 Why are equity earnings usually greater than cash
flow generated from the investment? How can these equity
earnings distort profitability analysis?
Q 8-9 Explain how return on assets could decline, given
an increase in net profit margin.
Q 8-10 How is return on investment different from
return on total equity? How does return on total equity dif-
fer from return on common equity?
Q 8-11 What is return on investment? What are some of
the types of measures for return on investment? Why is
the following ratio preferred?
Net Income Before Noncontrolling Interest
and Nonrecurring Items þ
½ðInterest ExpenseÞ × ð1 & Tax RateÞ'
Average ðLong-Term Debt + EquityÞ
Why is the interest multiplied by (1 −Tax Rate)?
Q 8-12 G. Herrich Company and Thomas, Inc., are
department stores. For the current year, they reported a
net income after tax of $400,000 and $600,000, respec-
tively. Is Thomas, Inc., a more profitable company than G.
Herrich Company? Discuss.
Q 8-13 Since interim reports are not audited, they are
not meaningful. Comment.
Q 8-14 Speculate on why accounting standards do not
mandate full financial statements in interim reports.
Q 8-15 Why may comprehensive income fluctuate sub-
stantially more than net income?
Q 8-16 Why can pro-forma financial information be mis-
leading?

P 8-10 Dexall Company recently had a fire in its store. Management must determine the in-
ventory loss for the insurance company. Since the firm did not have perpetual inventory
records, the insurance company has suggested that it might accept an estimate using the
gross profit test. The beginning inventory, as determined from the last financial statements,
was $10,000. Purchase invoices indicate purchases of $100,000. Credit and cash sales dur-
ing the period were $120,000. Last year, the gross profit for the firm was 40%, which was
also the industry average.
Required
a. Based on these data, estimate the inventory loss.
b. If the industry average gross profit was 50%, why might the insurance company be
leery of the estimated loss?

P 8-14 Warranty Obligations—Ethics Consideration
The Bishop Company has a balance in the warranty obligation account of $400,000. An
analysis of the products sold under warranty indicates that a balance of $900,000 should be
adequate for this year-end.

more is needed, it will be adjusted next quarter. The president indicates that there is not
adequate liquidity currently to pay more than $600,000.
Required

2. Adjusting to $900,000 will add how much to expense for the current year?

subsequent payments? Comment.
c. Comment on the ethics of not providing a balance that is reasonably close to what the
analysis indicates.

Cases
CASE 8-1 JEFF’S SELF-SERVICE STATION
John Dearden and his wife, Patricia, have been taking a vacation to Stowe, Vermont, each
summer. They like the area very much and would like to retire someday in this vicinity.
While in Stowe during the summer, they notice a “for sale” sign in front of a self-service sta-
tion. John is 55 and is no longer satisfied with commuting to work in New York City. He
decides to inquire about the asking price of the station. He is aware that Stowe is considered
a good vacation area during the entire year, especially when the ski season is in progress.
On inquiry, John determines that the asking price of the station is $70,000, which
includes two pumps, a small building, and 1/8 acre of land.
John asks to see some financial statements and is shown profit and loss statements for
2011 and 2010 that have been prepared for tax purposes by a local accountant.

John is also given an appraiser’s report on the property. The land is appraised at
$50,000, and the equipment and building are valued at $20,000. The equipment and build-
ing are estimated to have a useful life of 10 years.
The station has been operated by Jeff Anderson without additional help. He estimates
that if help were hired to operate the station, it would cost $10,000 per year. John antici-
pates that he will be able to operate the station without additional help. John intends to
incorporate. The anticipated tax rate is 50%.
Required
a. Determine the indicated return on investment if John Dearden purchases the station.
Include only financial data that will be recorded on the books. Consider 2011 and 2010
to be representative years for revenue and expenses.
b. Determine the indicated return on investment if help were hired to operate the station.
c. Why is there a difference between the rates of return in (a) and (b)? Discuss.
d. Determine the cash flow for 2012 if John serves as the manager and 2012 turns out to
be the same as 2011. Do not include the cost of the hired help. No inventory is on hand
at the date of purchase, but an inventory of $10,000 is on hand at the end of the year.
There are no receivables or liabilities.
e. Indicate some other considerations that should be analyzed.
f. Should John purchase the station?

Chapter
9
For the Investor
C
ertain types of analysis particularly concern investors. While this chapter is not
intended as a comprehensive guide to investment analysis, it will introduce certain
types of analysis useful to the investor. In addition to the analysis covered in this
chapter, an investor would also be interested in the liquidity, debt, and profitability ratios
covered in prior chapters.
Leverage and Its Effects on Earnings
The use of debt, called financial leverage, has a significant impact on earnings. The existence
of fixed operating costs, called operating leverage, also affects earnings. The higher the per-
centage of fixed operating costs, the greater the variation in income as a result of a variation
in sales (revenue).
This book does not compute a ratio for operating leverage because it cannot be readily
computed from published financial statements. This book does compute financial leverage
because it is readily computed from published financial statements.
The expense of debt financing is interest, a fixed charge dependent on the amount of fi-
nancial principal and the rate of interest. Interest is a contractual obligation created by the
borrowing agreement. In contrast to dividends, interest must be paid regardless of whether
the firm is in a highly profitable period. An advantage of interest over dividends is its tax
deductibility. Because the interest is subtracted to calculate taxable income, income tax
expense is reduced.
Definition of Financial Leverage and Magnification Effects
The use of financing with a fixed charge (such as interest) is termed financial leverage. Finan-
cial leverage is successful if the firm earns more on the borrowed funds than it pays to use
them. It is not successful if the firm earns less on the borrowed funds than it pays to use
them. Using financial leverage results in a fixed financing charge that can materially affect
the earnings available to the common shareholders.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Exhibit 9-1 illustrates financial leverage and its magnification effects. In this illustration,
earnings before interest and tax for Dowell Company are $1,000,000. Further, the firm has
an interest expense of $200,000 and a tax rate of 40%. The statement illustrates the effect of
leverage on the return to the common stockholder. At earnings before interest and tax
(EBIT) of $1,000,000, the net income is $480,000. If EBIT increases by 10% to $1,100,000,
as in the exhibit, the net income rises by 12.5%. This magnification is caused by the fixed
nature of interest expense. While earnings available to pay interest rise, interest remains the
same, thus leaving more for the residual owners. Note that since the tax rate remains the
same, earnings before tax change at the same rate as earnings after tax. Hence, this analysis
could be made with either profit figure.
If financial leverage is used, a rise in EBIT will cause an even greater rise in net income,
and a decrease in EBIT will cause an even greater decrease in net income. Looking again at
the statement for Dowell Company in Exhibit 9-1, when EBIT declined 20%, net income
dropped from $480,000 to $360,000—a decline of $120,000, or 25%, based on the original
$480,000. The use of financial leverage, termed trading on the equity, is only successful if
the rate of earnings on borrowed funds exceeds the fixed charges.
Computing the Degree of Financial Leverage
The degree of financial leverage is the multiplication factor by which the net income changes
as compared with the change in EBIT. One way of computing it follows:
% Change Net Income
% Change EBIT
For Dowell Company:
12:5%
10:0%
¼ 1:25, ¼ 25:0%
20:0%
¼ 1:25
The degree of financial leverage is 1.25. From a base EBIT of $1,000,000, any change in
EBIT will be accompanied by 1.25 times that change in net income. If net income before in-
terest and tax rises 4%, earnings to the stockholder will rise 5%. If net income before inter-
est and tax falls 8%, earnings to the stockholder will decline 10%. The degree of financial
leverage (DFL) can be computed more easily as follows:
Degree of Financial Leverage ¼ Earnings Before Interest and Tax
Earnings Before Tax

Again referring to Dowell Company:
Degree of Financial Leverage at Earnings

¼ $1,000,000
$800,000
¼ 1:25
Note that the degree of financial leverage represents a particular base level of income.
The degree of financial leverage may differ for other levels of income or fixed charges.
The degree of financial leverage formula will not work precisely when the income state-
ment includes any of the following items:
1. Noncontrolling interest
2. Equity income
3. Nonrecurring items
a. Discontinued operations
b. Extraordinary items
When any of these items are included, they should be eliminated from the numerator
and denominator. The all-inclusive formula follows:
All-Inclusive Degree of
Financial Leverage
¼
Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Noncontrolling Interest,
Equity Income, and Nonrecurring Items
Earnings Before Tax, Noncontrolling Interest, Equity Income,
and Nonrecurring Items
This formula results in the ratio by which earnings before interest, tax, noncontrolling
interest, equity income, and nonrecurring items will change in relation to a change in earn-
ings before tax, noncontrolling interest, equity income, and nonrecurring items. In other
words, it eliminates the noncontrolling interest, equity income, and nonrecurring items from
the degree of financial leverage.
Exhibit 9-2 shows the degree of financial leverage for Nike for 2011 and 2010. The
degree of financial leverage is 1.01 for 2011 and 1.01 for 2010. This is a very low degree of
financial leverage. Therefore, the financial leverage at the end of 2011 indicates that as earn-
ings before interest changes, net income will change by 1.01 times that amount. If earnings
before interest increases, the financial leverage will be favorable. If earnings before interest
decreases, the financial leverage will be unfavorable. In periods of relatively low or declining
interest rates, financial leverage looks more favorable than in periods of high or increasing
interest rates. (Note: Essentially, Nike has minor financial leverage in 2011 and 2010.)
Summary of Financial Leverage
Two things are important in looking at financial leverage as part of financial analysis. First, how
high is the degree of financial leverage? This is a type of risk (or opportunity) measurement from

the viewpoint of the stockholder. The higher the degree of financial leverage, the greater the mul-
tiplication factor. Second, does the financial leverage work for or against the owners?
Earnings per Common Share
Earnings per share—the amount of income earned on a share of common stock during an
accounting period—applies only to common stock and to corporate income statements.
Nonpublic companies, because of cost-benefit considerations, do not have to report earnings
per share. Because earnings per share receives much attention from the financial community,
investors, and potential investors, it will be described in some detail.
Fortunately, we do not need to compute earnings per share. A company is required to
present it at the bottom of the income statement. Per share amounts for discontinued opera-
tions and extraordinary items must be presented on the face of the income statement or in
the notes to the financial statements. Earnings per share for recurring items is the most signif-
icant for primary analysis.
Computing earnings per share initially involves net income, preferred stock dividends
declared and accumulated, and the weighted average number of shares outstanding, as follows:
Earnings per Share ¼
Net Income " Preferred Dividends
Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding
Since earnings pertain to an entire period, they should be related to the common shares
outstanding during the period. Thus, the denominator of the equation is the weighted aver-
age number of common shares outstanding.
To illustrate, assume that a corporation had 10,000 shares of common stock outstand-
ing at the beginning of the year. On July 1, it issued 2,000 shares, and on October 1, it issued
another 3,000 shares. The weighted average number of shares outstanding would be com-
puted as follows:
Months Shares Are

12,000
3/12
3,000
October–December
15,000
3/12
3,750
11,750
When the common shares outstanding increase as a result of a stock dividend or stock
split, retroactive recognition must be given to these events for all comparative earnings per
share presentations. Stock dividends and stock splits do not provide the firm with more
funds; they only change the number of outstanding shares. Earnings per share should be
related to the outstanding common stock after the stock dividend or stock split. In the
weighted average common shares illustration, if we assume that a 2-for-1 stock split took
place on December 31, the denominator of the earnings per share computation becomes
23,500 (11,750 × 2). The denominator of prior years’ earnings per share computations
would also be doubled. If we assume that net income is $100,000 and preferred dividends
total $10,000 in this illustration, then the earnings per common share would be $3.83
[($100,000 −$10,000)/23,500].
The current earnings per share guidelines call for the presentation of basic earnings per
share and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net
income less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net
income less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding plus the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive secur-
ities are convertible securities, warrants, options, or other rights that upon conversion or
exercise could in the aggregate dilute earnings per common share.
Exhibit 9-3 presents the earnings per share of Nike for the years 2009, 2010, and 2011.
There was a material increase in earnings per share for 2010 and 2011. This was especially
true of 2010.

Price/Earnings Ratio
The price/earnings (P/E) ratio expresses the relationship between the market price of a share of
common stock and that stock’s current earnings per share. Compute the P/E ratio as follows:
Price/Earnings Ratio ¼
Market Price per Share
Diluted Earnings per Share, Before Nonrecurring Items
Using diluted earnings per share results in a higher price/earnings ratio, a conservative
computation of the ratio. Ideally, the P/E ratio should be computed using diluted earnings
per share for continuing earnings per share. This gives an indication of what is being paid
for a dollar of recurring earnings.
P/E ratios are available from many sources, such as The Wall Street Journal and Stand-
ard & Poor’s Industry Surveys. Exhibit 9-4 shows the P/E ratio for Nike for 2011 and 2010.
The P/E ratio was 19.24 at the end of 2011 and 18.75 at the end of 2010. This indicates that
the stock has been selling for about 19 times earnings. You can get a perspective on this ratio
by comparing it with competitors ratio, average P/E ratio for the industry, and an average
for all of the stocks on an exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. These averages
will vary greatly over several years.
Investors view the P/E ratio as a gauge of future earning power of the firm. Companies
with high-growth opportunities generally have high P/E ratios; firms with low-growth tend
to have lower P/E ratios. However, investors may be wrong in their estimates of growth
potential. One fundamental of investing is to be wiser than the market. An example would
be buying a stock that has a relatively low P/E ratio when the prospects for the company are
much better than reflected in the P/E ratio.

The percentage of earnings retained is better for trend analysis if nonrecurring items are
removed. This indicates what is being retained of recurring earnings. Determine dividends
from the statement of cash flows.
A problem occurs because the percentage of earnings retained implies that earnings rep-
resent a cash pool for paying dividends. Under accrual accounting, earnings do not represent
a cash pool. Operating cash flow compared with cash dividends gives a better indication of
the cash from operations and the dividends paid. Chapter 10 introduces this ratio.
Many firms have a policy on the percentage of earnings that they want retained—for
example, between 60% and 75%. In general, new firms, growing firms, and firms perceived
as growth firms will have a relatively high percentage of earnings retained. Many new firms,
growing firms, and firms perceived as growing firms do not pay dividends.
In the Almanac of Business and Industrial Financial Ratios, the percentage of earnings
retained is called the ratio of retained earnings to net income. The phrase retained earnings
as used in the ratio in the Almanac is a misnomer. Retained earnings in this ratio does not
mean accumulated profits but rather that portion of income retained in a single year. Hence,
this ratio has two different names.
Exhibit 9-5 shows the percentage of earnings retained by Nike using 2011 and 2010 fig-
ures. Nike retains a substantial proportion of its profits for internal use. The percentage of
earnings retained has been consistent [2001 (78.01%); 2002 (80.71%); 2003 (81.38%);
2004 (81.05%); 2005 (80.46%); 2006 (79.10%); 2007 (76.96%); 2008 (78.08%); 2009
(68.61%); 2010 (73.52%); 2011 (73.98%)]. The year 2009 was the low year in those years
because of some significant charges to operations.
Dividend Payout
The dividend payout measures the portion of current earnings per common share being paid
out in dividends. Compute the dividend payout ratio as follows:
Dividend Payout ¼
Dividends per Common Share
Diluted Earnings per Share Before Nonrecurring Items
Earnings per share are diluted in the formula because this is the most conservative view-
point. Ideally, diluted earnings per share should not include nonrecurring items since direc-
tors normally look at recurring earnings to develop a stable dividend policy.
The dividend payout ratio has a similar problem as the percentage of earnings retained.
Investors may assume that dividend payout implies that earnings per share represent cash.
Under accrual accounting, earnings per share do not represent a cash pool.
Most firms hesitate to decrease dividends since this tends to have adverse effects on the mar-
ket price of the company’s stock. No rule of thumb exists for a correct payout ratio. Some stock-
holders prefer high dividends; others prefer to have the firm reinvest the earnings in hopes of
higher capital gains. In the latter case, the payout ratio would be a relatively smaller percentage.
Exhibit 9-6 presents Nike’s 2011 and 2010 dividend payout ratios, which increased
from 27.46% in 2010 to 27.33% in 2011. These are conservative payout ratios. Often, to

attract the type of stockholder who looks favorably on a low dividend payout ratio, a com-
pany must have a good return on common equity. The dividend payout has been fairly con-
sistent but did turn up in 2009 [2001 (22.22%); 2002 (19.51%); 2003 (19.49%); 2004
(21.08%); 2005 (21.21%); 2006 (22.35%); 2007 (24.23%)]; 2008 (23.40%); 2009
(32.34%); 2010 (27.46%); 2011 (27.33%)].
Industry averages of dividend payout ratios are available in Standard & Poor’s Industry
Surveys. Although no correct payout exists, even within an industry, the outlook for the
industry often makes the bulk of the ratios in a particular industry similar.
In general, new firms, growing firms, and firms perceived as growth firms have a rela-
tively low dividend payout. Nike would be considered a growing firm.
Dividend Yield
The dividend yield indicates the relationship between the dividends per common share and
the market price per common share. Compute the dividend yield as follows:
Dividend Yield ¼
Dividends per Common Share
Market Price per Common Share
For this ratio, multiply the fourth quarter dividend declared by 4. This indicates the cur-
rent dividend rate. Exhibit 9-7 shows the dividend yield for Nike for 2011 and 2010. The
dividend yield has been relatively low. Investors were likely satisfied with the dividend yield
for Nike.
Since total earnings from securities include both dividends and price appreciation, no
rule of thumb exists for dividend yield. The yield depends on the firm’s dividend policy and
the market price. If the firm successfully invests the money not distributed as dividends, the
price should rise. If the firm holds the dividends at low amounts to allow for reinvestment of
profits, the dividend yield is likely to be low. A low dividend yield satisfies many investors if
the company has a record of above-average return on common equity. Investors that want
current income prefer a high dividend yield.

Book Value per Share
A figure frequently published in annual reports is book value per share, which indicates the
amount of stockholders’ equity that relates to each share of outstanding common stock. The
formula for book value per share follows:
Book Value per Share ¼ Total Shareholders’ Equity " Preferred Stock Equity
Number of Common Shares Outstanding
Preferred stock equity should be stated at liquidation price, if other than book, because the
preferred stockholders would be paid this value in the event of liquidation. Liquidation value is
sometimes difficult to locate in an annual report. If this value cannot be found, the book figure
that relates to preferred stock may be used in place of liquidation value. Exhibit 9-8 shows the
book value per share for Nike for 2011 and 2010. The book value increased from $20.15 in
2010 to $21.03 in 2011.
The market price of the securities usually does not approximate the book value. These
historical dollars reflect past unrecovered cost of the assets. The market value of the stock,
however, reflects the potential of the firm as seen by the investor. For example, land will be
valued at cost, and this asset value will be reflected in the book value. If the asset were pur-
chased several years ago and is now worth substantially more, however, the market value of
the stock may recognize this potential.
Book value is of limited use to the investment analyst since it is based on the book num-
bers. When market value is below book value, investors view the company as lacking poten-
tial. A market value above book value indicates that investors view the company as having
enough potential to be worth more than the book numbers. Note that Nike was selling mate-
rially above book value (Market 2011, $84.45).
When investors are pessimistic about the prospects for stocks, the stocks sell below book
value. On the other hand, when investors are optimistic about stock prospects, the stocks sell
above book value. There have been times when the majority of stocks sold below book
value. There have also been times when the majority of stocks sold at a multiple of five or
six times book value.
Stock Options (Stock-Based Compensation)
Corporations frequently provide stock options (or other stock-based compensation) for
employees and officers of the company. Setting aside shares for options (or other stock-based
compensation) is very popular in the United States.
A basic understanding of stock option accounting (or other stock-based compensation)
is needed in order to assess the disclosure of a company.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, revised (R), which is a revision of
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” Prior to SFAS No. 123 (R), a

company could elect to present the effect of stock-based compensation expense in the body
of the income statement or in the notes. Under SFAS No. 123 (R), the effect of stock-based
compensation must be presented in the income statement (disclosure detail can be in the
notes).
The Securities and Exchange Commission accepted SFAS No. 123 (R), except for the
compliance dates. In April 2005, the Commission issued revised compliance dates. The Com-
mission rule allows companies to implement SFAS No. 123 (R) at the beginning of their fis-
cal year, instead of the next reporting period, which begins after June 15, 2005 (or
December 15, 2005 for small-business issuers).
SFAS No. 123 (R) resulted in greater international comparability in the accounting for
share-based transactions. In February 2004, the IASB issued a reporting standard that
requires all entities to recognize an expense for all employee services received in share-based
payment transactions, using a fair-value-based method that is similar in most respects to the
fair-value–based method established in SFAS No. 123 (R).
SFAS No. 123 (R) essentially carried forward the reporting of noncompensatory plans.
A noncompensatory plan attempts to raise capital or encourage widespread ownership of
the corporation’s stock among officers and employees. Because the officers and employees
purchase the stock at only a slight discount (usually 5% or less) from the market price, there
is not a substantial dilution of the position of existing stockholders or a substantial compen-
sation issue. For those plans, no compensation expense is recognized when these options are
exercised, and the shares are issued slightly below the market price.
Two terms that are particularly important to understanding SFAS No. 123 (R) are grant
date and vested. The grant date is the date at which an employer and an employee reach a
mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of a share-based payment award. The
employer becomes contingently obligated on the grant date to issue equity instruments or
transfer assets to an employee who renders the requisite service.1 A share-based payment
award becomes vested at the date that the employee’s right to receive or retain shares, other
instruments, or cash under the award is no longer contingent on satisfaction of either a serv-
ice condition or a performance condition.2
Key provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R) are as follows:
1. It requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
2. The option expense will be recognized over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award (usually the vesting period).
3. A public entity will initially measure the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of liability instruments based on its current fair value.
4. The notes to financial statements of both public and nonpublic entities will disclose
information to assist users of financial information to understand the nature of share-
based payment transactions and the effects of these transactions on the financial
statements.
Warren E. Buffett, one of the world’s richest persons and likely the world’s most famous
investor, had been critical of firms that do not recognize option expense in the body of the
income statement. His view was that option expense needed to be considered when evaluat-
ing the performance of a company.
When stock prices decline, is there a value to holding stock options? A decline in stock pri-
ces could make the existing stock options worthless. But many companies rewrite the options
with a lower price when the stock declines. Thus, for the holders of the options, it becomes a
situation of “tails I win, heads I win.” Buffett tells the following story relating to stock options:
A gorgeous woman slinks up to a CEO at a party and through moist lips purrs, “I’ll do
anything—anything—you want. Just tell me what you would like.” With no hesitation,
he replies, “Reprice my options.”3

Nike disclosed $105, $159, and $171 (in millions) in total stock-based compensation
for the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively (Exhibit 9-9).

The impact of option expense can be substantial, resulting in lower net income and earn-
ings per share. It can have a particularly material impact on high-tech companies that are
rewarding employees with substantial stock-based compensation.
To assist in determining the materiality of options, use the following ratio:
Materiality of Options ¼
Net Income Before Nonrecurring Items Not Including
Option Expense " Net Income Before Nonrecurring Items
Including Option Expense
Net Income Before Nonrecurring Items Not
Including Option Expense
Using data from Exhibits 9-5 and 9-9 for Nike, the materiality of options is computed
for 2011. The total stock-based compensation expense was adjusted for estimated taxes.
Materiality of Options ¼ ð$2,133 þ $77Þ " $2,133
$2,133 þ $77
¼ 3:48%
For Nike, the impact of option expense appears to be moderate.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense
Note 11—Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation (In Part)
The authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 175 million
and 750 million, respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting
rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors.
In 1990, the Board of Directors adopted, and the shareholders approved, the NIKE, Inc. 1990 Stock Incentive Plan (the
“1990 Plan”). The 1990 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 163 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common
Stock in connection with stock options and other awards granted under the plan. The 1990 Plan authorizes the grant of non-
statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and
performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair
market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the 1990 Plan.
The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards, and
the other terms and conditions of the awards. Substantially all stock option grants outstanding under the 1990 plan were
granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years, and expire 10 years from the date of grant.

1Expense for stock options includes the expense associated with stock appreciation rights. Accelerated stock option expense is recorded for employees eligible for
accelerated stock option vesting upon retirement. In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company changed the accelerated vesting provisions of its stock option
plan. Under the new provisions, accelerated stock option expense for year ended May 31, 2011 was $12 million. The accelerated stock option expense for the
years ended May 31, 2010 and 2009 was $74 million and $59 million, respectively.
2In connection with the restructuring activities that took place during fiscal 2009, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense relating to the
modification of stock option agreements, allowing for an extended post-termination exercise period, and accelerated vesting of restricted stock as part of
severance packages. See Note 16—Restructuring Charges for further details.
As of May 31, 2011, the Company had $111 million of unrecognized compensation costs from stock options, net of esti-
mated forfeitures, to be recognized as selling and administrative expense over a weighted average period of 2.2 years.

Restricted Stock
In July 2003, Microsoft Corporation announced that it would stop issuing stock options to
employees and instead give them restricted stock. This was a defining event in the popularity
of restricted stock and the reduction in stock option plans.
With restricted stock, employees cannot sell their shares until a certain amount of time
passes, and employees may have to forfeit their shares if they leave before vesting. Often, a por-
tion of the shares vest each year for three, four, or five years. For some restricted stock, an em-
ployee forfeits the shares if certain financial targets are not met. With restricted stock, the expense
is booked by companies in a manner similar to the new requirement for expensing options.
Some employees prefer restricted stock over options because they receive actual shares of
stock. Usually, the employee receives dividends. This may occur before the stock has vested.
Traditionally, restricted stock was only awarded to top executives, possibly along with options.
In anticipation of a standard requiring expensing of options, firms started to issue restricted stock
to a broad group of employees instead of options, sometimes in conjunction with options.
For Nike, as shown in Exhibit 9-9, restricted stock was included in the total stock-based
compensation expense.
Stock Appreciation Rights
Some firms grant key employees stock appreciation rights instead of stock options or in addi-
tion to stock options. Stock appreciation rights give the employee the right to receive compen-
sation in cash or stock (or a combination of these) at some future date, based on the difference
between the market price of the stock at the date of exercise over a preestablished price.
The accounting for stock appreciation rights directs that the compensation expense rec-
ognized each period be based on the difference between the quoted market value at the end
of each period and the option price. This compensation expense is then reduced by previ-
ously recognized compensation expense on the stock appreciation right. For example,
assume that the option price is $10.00 and the market value is $15.00 at the end of the first
period of the stock appreciation right. Compensation expense would be recognized at $5.00
($15.00 −$10.00) per share included in the plan. If 100,000 shares are in the plan, then the
expense to be charged to the income statement would be $500,000 ($5.00 × 100,000
shares). If the market value is $12.00 at the end of the second period of the stock apprecia-
tion right, expenses are reduced by $3.00 per share. This is because the total compensation
expense for the two years is $2.00 ($12.00 −$10.00). Since $5.00 of expense was recog-
nized in the first year, $3.00 of negative compensation is considered in the second year in
order to total $2.00 of expense. With 100,000 shares, the reduction to expenses in the sec-
ond year would be $300,000 ($3.00 × 100,000 shares). Thus, stock appreciation rights can
have a material influence on income, dictated by changing stock prices.
A company with outstanding stock appreciation rights describes them in a note to the finan-
cial statements. If the number of shares is known, a possible future influence on income can be
computed, based on assumptions made regarding future market prices. For example, if the note
discloses that the firm has 50,000 shares of stock appreciation rights outstanding, and the stock
market price was $10.00 at the end of the year, the analyst can assume a market price at the end
of next year and compute the compensation expense for next year. With these facts and an
assumed market price of $15.00 at the end of next year, the compensation expense for next year
can be computed to be $250,000 [($15.00 −$10.00) × 50,000 shares]. This potential charge to
earnings should be considered as the stock is evaluated as a potential investment.
Stock appreciation rights tied to the future market price of the stock can represent a ma-
terial potential drain on the company. Even a relatively small number of stock appreciation
rights outstanding could be material. This should be considered by existing and potential
stockholders. Some firms have placed limits on the potential appreciation in order to control
the cost of appreciation rights.
The General Electric Company 2001 annual report indicated that “at year-end 2001,
there were 131 thousand stock appreciation rights outstanding at an average exercise price
of $7.68.” The General Electric Company stock price during 2001 ranged from a low of
$28.25 to a high of $52.90.
Apparently, stock appreciation rights were not outstanding as of May 31, 2011 for Nike.

C
onsidering the importance of cash, it is not surprising that the statement of cash
flows has become one of the primary financial statements. The statement of cash
flows gives managers, equity analysts, commercial lenders, and investment bankers a
thorough explanation of the changes that occurred in the firm’s cash balances.
The statement of cash flows provides an explanation of the changes that occurred in the
firm’s cash balances for a specific period. Cash is considered to be the lifeblood of the firm.
Understanding the flow of cash is critical to having a handle on the pulse of the firm.
Quote the Banker, “Watch Cash Flow”
Once upon a midnight dreary as I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of accounting lore,
Seeking gimmicks (without scruple) to squeeze through some new tax loophole,
Suddenly I heard a knock upon my door,
Only this, and nothing more.
Then I felt a queasy tingling and I heard the cash a-jingling
As a fearsome banker entered whom I’d often seen before.
His face was money-green and in his eyes there could be seen
Dollar-signs that seemed to glitter as he reckoned up the score.
“Cash flow,” the banker said, and nothing more.
I had always thought it fine to show a jet black bottom line,
But the banker sounded a resounding, “No,
Your receivables are high, mounting upward toward the sky;
Write-offs loom. What matters is cash flow.”
He repeated, “Watch cash flow.”
Then I tried to tell the story of our lovely inventory
Which, though large, is full of most delightful stuff.
But the banker saw its growth, and with a mighty oath

He waved his arms and shouted, “Stop! Enough!
Pay the interest, and don’t give me any guff!”
Next I looked for non-cash items which could add ad infinitum
To replace the ever-outward flow of cash,
But to keep my statement black I’d held depreciation back,
And my banker said that I’d done something rash.
He quivered, and his teeth began to gnash.
When I asked him for a loan, he responded, with a groan,
That the interest rate would be just prime plus eight,
And to guarantee my purity he’d insist on some security—
All my assets plus the scalp upon my pate.
Only this, a standard rate.
Though my bottom line is black, I am flat upon my back.
My cash flows out and customers pay slow.
The growth of my receivables is almost unbelievable;
The result is certain—unremitting woe!
And I hear the banker utter an ominous low mutter,
“Watch cash flow.”

Basic Elements of the Statement of Cash Flows
The statement of cash flows is prepared using a concept of cash that includes not only cash
itself but also short-term, highly liquid investments. This is referred to as the “cash and cash
equivalent” focus. The category cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, cash on
deposit, and investments in short-term, highly liquid investments. The cash flow statement
analysis explains the change in these focus accounts by examining all the accounts on the
balance sheet other than the focus accounts.
Management may use the statement of cash flows to determine dividend policy, cash
generated by operations, and investing and financing policy. Outsiders, such as creditors or
investors, may use it to determine such things as the firm’s ability to increase dividends, its
ability to pay debt with cash from operations, and the percentage of cash from operations in
relation to the cash from financing.
The statement of cash flows must report all transactions affecting cash flow. A company
will occasionally have investing and/or financing activities that have no direct effect on cash
flow. For example, a company may acquire land in exchange for common stock. This is an
investing transaction (acquiring the land) and a financing transaction (issuing the common
stock). The conversion of long-term bonds into common stock involves two financing activ-
ities with no effect on cash flow. Since transactions such as these will have future effects on
cash flows, these transactions are to be disclosed in a separate schedule presented with the
statement of cash flows.
The statement of cash flows classifies cash receipts and cash payments into operating,
investing, and financing activities.1 In brief, operating activities involve income statement
items. Investing activities generally result from changes in long-term asset items. Financing
activities generally relate to long-term liability and stockholders’ equity items. A description
of these activities and typical cash flows are as follows:
1. OPERATING ACTIVITIES. Operating activities include all transactions and other
events that are not investing or financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities
are generally the cash effects of transactions and other events that enter into the
determination of net income.
Typical cash inflows:
From sale of goods or services
From return on loans (interest)
From return on equity securities (dividends)

Typical cash outflows:
Payments for acquisitions of inventory
Payments to employees
Payments to governments (taxes)
Payments of interest expense
Payments to suppliers for other expenses
2. INVESTING ACTIVITIES. Investing activities include lending money and collecting on
those loans and acquiring and selling investments and productive long-term assets.
Typical cash inflows:
From receipts from loans collected
From sales of debt or equity securities of other corporations
From sale of property, plant, and equipment
Typical cash outflows:
Loans to other entities
Purchase of debt or equity securities of other entities
Purchase of property, plant, and equipment
3. FINANCING ACTIVITIES. Financing activities include cash flows relating to liability
and owners’ equity.
Typical cash inflows:
From sale of equity securities
From sale of bonds, mortgages, notes, and other short- or long-term borrowings
Typical cash outflows:
Payment of dividends
Reacquisition of the firm’s capital stock
Payment of amounts borrowed
The statement of cash flows presents cash flows from operating activities first, followed
by investing activities and then financing activities. The individual inflows and outflows
from investing and financing activities are presented separately. The operating activities sec-
tion can be presented using the direct method or the indirect method. (The indirect method
is sometimes referred to as the reconciliation method.) The direct method essentially presents
the income statement on a cash basis, instead of an accrual basis. The indirect method
adjusts net income for items that affected net income but did not affect cash.
SFAS No. 95 encourages enterprises to use the direct method to present cash flows from
operating activities. However, if a company uses the direct method, the standard requires a
reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating activities in a separate sched-
ule. If a firm uses the indirect method, it must make a separate disclosure of interest paid
and income taxes paid during the period. Exhibit 10-1 presents skeleton formats of a state-
ment of cash flows using the direct method and the indirect method.

The 1986 SFAS Exposure Draft, “Statement of Cash Flows,” indicates that:
The principal advantage of the direct method is that it shows the operating cash
receipts and payments. Knowledge of where operating cash flows came from and how
cash was used in past periods may be useful in estimating future cash flows. The
indirect method of reporting has the advantage of focusing on the differences between
income and cash flow from operating activities.2
Source: U.S. Securities and Exchange
The statement of cash flows has now been a required financial statement for over 20 years.
The financial community is in agreement as to the importance of this statement. Unfortunately,
the statement of cash flows has not proven as useful as many expected. A major reason for this
is the failure to require the direct method of presenting operating activities. Many ratios relating
to the cash flow have been developed by companies, financial services, articles, and books.
There is little agreement on what ratios to compute and how to compute these ratios. Also, the
direct method allows for analysis that cannot be done with the indirect method.
Exhibit 10-2 presents the 2011 Nike consolidated statement of cash flows. This state-
ment presents cash from operations using the indirect method. The statement closely follows
the standard format.
In addition to reviewing the flow of funds on a yearly basis, reviewing the flow of funds
for a three-year period may be helpful. This can be accomplished by adding a total column
to the statement that represents the total of each item for the three-year period. This has been
done for Nike in Exhibit 10-2.

Some observations on the 2011 Nike statement of cash flows, considering the three-year
period ended May 31, 2011, follow:
1. Cash provided by operations was the major source of cash. This operating cash flow
approximately offsets the cash outflow for investing activities and the outflow for
financing activities.
2. Cash flow from operations related to net income and depreciation represented
substantially all of the cash flow from operations.
3. Cash used for additions to property, plant, and equipment represented the major use of
cash used by investing activities (except for purchases, maturities and sales of short-term
investment).
4. Cash used for repurchase of common stock represented the major use of cash for
financing activities. Possibly some of the repurchase of stock was related to the proceeds
from exercise of stock options and other stock issuances. One of the reasons for
expensing stock options is that typically a company will repurchase stock and then issue
stock with the exercise of options.
Exhibit 10-3 presents the 2011 cash flow statement of Tech Data Corporation, with a
total column for the three-year period. This firm presented the cash flows from operating
activities using the direct method. Note the following with regard to the direct method in Ex-
hibit 10-3.
1. Net cash provided by operations represented the major source of cash.
2. Acquisition of business, net of cash acquired represented the major outflow of funds
under investing activities.
3. Cash paid for purchase of treasury stock represented the major outflow of funds under
financing activities.
4. Capital contributions and net borrowings from joint venture parties represented the
major inflow of funds under financing activities.

Note the following with regard to the indirect method in Exhibit 10-3. (The indirect
method represents “Reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating
activities.”)
1. Net income plus depreciation and amortization make up most of the cash flow
(remember that net income does not represent cash flow and that depreciation and
amortization are not cash flow items).
2. Notice how changes in operating assets and liabilities make up approximately 44% of
net cash provided by operating activities.
3. Acquisition of business, net of cash acquired represented the major outflow of funds in
investing activities.
Exhibit 10-4 restates the 2011 cash flows for Tech Data Corporation, viewing inflows
and outflows separately. Some observations regarding Exhibit 10-4 follow:
1. Approximately 100% of the total inflows came from operations.
2. Approximately 98% of total cash outflows related to operations.
3. The only significant inflow or outflow for investing activities was an outflow for
acquisition of business, net of cash acquired.
4. The only significant inflow or outflow for financing activities was an outflow for
purchase of treasury stock.

Financial Ratios and the Statement of Cash Flows
Financial ratios that relate to the statement of cash flows were slow in being developed. This
was related to several factors. For one thing, most financial ratios traditionally related an
income statement item(s) to a balance sheet item(s). This became the normal way of approach-
ing financial analysis, and the statement of cash flows did not become a required statement
until 1987. Thus, it took a while for analysts to become familiar with the statement.
Ratios have now been developed that relate to the cash flow statement. Some of these
ratios are as follows:
1. Operating cash flow/current maturities of long-term debt and current notes payable
2. Operating cash flow/total debt
3. Operating cash flow per share
4. Operating cash flow/cash dividends
Operating Cash Flow/Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt and Current
Notes Payable
The operating cash flow/current maturities of long-term debt and current notes payable is a
ratio that indicates a firm’s ability to meet its current maturities of debt. The higher this ra-
tio, the better the firm’s ability to meet its current maturities of debt. The higher this ratio,
the better the firm’s liquidity. This ratio relates to the liquidity ratios discussed in Chapter 6.
The formula for operating cash flow/current maturities of long-term debt and current
notes payable follows:
Operating Cash Flow
Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt and Current Notes Payable
It is computed for Nike for 2011 and 2010 in Exhibit 10-5. For Nike, this ratio substan-
tially declined in 2011. Both years represent material coverage.
Operating Cash Flow/Total Debt
The operating cash flow/total debt indicates a firm’s ability to cover total debt with the
yearly operating cash flow. The higher the ratio, the better the firm’s ability to carry its total
debt. From a debt standpoint, this is considered to be important. It relates to the debt ratios
presented in Chapter 7. It is a type of income view of debt, except that operating cash flow is
the perspective instead of an income figure.
The operating cash flow is the same cash flow amount that is used for the operating cash
flow/current maturities of long-term debt and current notes payable. The total debt figure is the
same total debt amount that was computed in Chapter 7 for the debt ratio and the debt/equity
ratio. For the primary computation of the operating cash flow/total debt ratio, all possible

balance sheet debt items are included, as was done for the debt ratio and the debt/equity ratio.
This is the more conservative approach to computing the ratio. In practice, many firms are
more selective about what is included in debt. Some include only short-term liabilities and long-
term items, such as bonds payable. The formula for operating cash flow/total debt is as follows:
Operating Cash Flow
Total Debt
The operating cash flow/total debt ratio is computed in Exhibit 10-6 for Nike for the
years ended May 31, 2011 and 2010. It indicates that cash flow is significant in relation to
total debt in both years, but the coverage materially declined in 2011.
Operating Cash Flow per Share
Operating cash flow per share indicates the funds flow per common share outstanding. It is
usually substantially higher than earnings per share because depreciation has not been deducted.
In the short run, operating cash flow per share is a better indication of a firm’s ability to
make capital expenditure decisions and pay dividends than is earnings per share. This ratio
should not be viewed as a substitute for earnings per share in terms of a firm’s profitability.
For this reason, firms are prohibited from reporting cash flow per share on the face of the
statement of cash flows or elsewhere in their financials. However, it is a complementary ratio
that relates to the ratios of relevance to investors (discussed in Chapter 9).
The operating cash flow per share formula is as follows:
Operating Cash Flow ! Preferred Dividends
Diluted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding
The operating cash flow amount is the same figure that was used in the two previous
cash flow formulas in this chapter. For common shares outstanding, use the shares that were
used for the purpose of computing earnings per share on the most diluted basis. This figure
is available when doing internal analysis. It is also in a firm’s 10-K annual report. Some com-
panies disclose these shares in the annual report. This share number cannot be computed
from information in the annual report, except for very simple situations.

When these share amounts are not available, use the outstanding shares of common
stock. This will result in an approximation of the operating cash flow per share. The advant-
age of using the number of shares used for earnings per share is that this results in an
amount that can be compared with earnings per share, and it avoids distortions.
Operating cash flow per share is computed for Nike for 2011 and 2010 in Exhibit 10-7.
Operating cash flow per share was materially more than earnings per share in 2010 and
materially less than earnings per share in 2011.
Operating Cash Flow/Cash Dividends
The operating cash flow/cash dividends indicates a firm’s ability to cover cash dividends
with the yearly operating cash flow. The higher the ratio, the better the firm’s ability to cover
cash dividends. This ratio relates to the investor ratios discussed in Chapter 9.
The operating cash flow/cash dividends formula is as follows:
Operating Cash Flow
Cash Dividends
The operating cash flow amount is the same figure that was used in the three previous
formulas in this chapter. Operating cash flow/cash dividends is computed for Nike for 2011
and 2010 in Exhibit 10-8. It indicates material coverage of cash dividends in both 2011 and
2010, although there was a material decline in 2011.
Alternative Cash Flow
There is no standard definition of cash flow in the financial literature. Often, cash flow is
used to mean net income plus depreciation expense. This definition of cash flow could be
used to compute the cash flow amount for the formulas introduced in this chapter. However,
this is a narrow definition of cash flow, and it is considered less useful than the net cash flow
from operating activities.
Procedures for Development of the Statement of Cash Flows
Cash inflows and outflows are determined by analyzing all balance sheet accounts other
than the cash and cash equivalent accounts. The following account balance changes indicate
cash inflows:
1. Decreases in assets (e.g., the sale of land for cash)
2. Increases in liabilities (e.g., the issuance of long-term bonds)
3. Increases in stockholders’ equity (e.g., the sale of common stock)
Cash outflows are indicated by the following account balance changes:
1. Increases in assets (e.g., the purchase of a building for cash)

3. Decreases in stockholders’ equity (e.g., the payment of a cash dividend)
Transactions within any individual account may result in both a source and a use of
cash. For example, the land account may have increased, but analysis may indicate that there
was both an acquisition and a disposal of land.
Exhibit 10-9 contains the data needed for preparing a statement of cash flows for ABC
Company for the year ended December 31, 2011. These data will be used to illustrate the
preparation of the statement of cash flows.
Three techniques may be used to prepare the statement of cash flows: (1) the visual
method, (2) the T-account method, and (3) the worksheet method. The visual method can be
used only when the financial information is not complicated. When the financial information
is complicated, either the T-account method or the worksheet method must be used. This
book illustrates only the visual method because of the emphasis on using financial account-
ing information, not on preparing financial statements. For an explanation of the T-account
method and the worksheet method, consult an intermediate accounting textbook.

Following the steps in developing the statement of cash flows, first compute the change
in cash and cash equivalents. For ABC Company, this is the increase of $600 in the cash
account—the net increase in cash.
For the second step, compute the net change in each balance sheet account other than
the cash account. The changes in the balance sheet accounts for ABC Company follow:
Assets:
Accounts receivable decrease
$
100

Inventories increase

*
*This is a combination of operating, financing, and investing activities.
For the third step, consider the changes in the balance sheet accounts along with the
income statement for the current period and the supplementary information. The cash flows
are segregated into cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities,
and cash flows from financing activities. Noncash investing and/or financing activities
should be shown in a separate schedule with the statement of cash flows.
To illustrate the direct and indirect methods of presenting operating activities, the
ABC Company income statement is used, along with the relevant supplemental informa-
tion and balance sheet accounts. For the direct approach, the income statement is adjusted
to present the revenue and expense accounts on a cash basis. Exhibit 10-10 illustrates the
accrual basis income statement adjusted to a cash basis. Exhibit 10-11 shows the statement
of cash flows for ABC Company, using the direct approach for presenting cash flows from
operations.
When the cash provided by operations is presented using the direct approach, the
income statement accounts are usually described in terms of receipts or payments. For exam-
ple, “sales” on the accrual basis income statement is usually described as “receipts from cus-
tomers” when presented on a cash basis.

2. Proceeds from common stock sales approximate 11% of total cash inflow.
3. Proceeds from sales of land approximate 6% of total cash inflow.
Outflows:
1. Payments to suppliers represent approximately 58% of total cash outflow.
2. Retirement of bonds payable approximates 19% of total cash outflow.
3. Dividends paid approximate 13% of total cash outflow.
Summary
The statement of cash flows provides cash flow information that is critical for users to make informed decisions. The state-
ment of cash flows should be reviewed for several time periods in order to determine the major sources of cash and the
major uses of cash.
The ratios related to the statement of cash flows are the following:
The formula for operating cash flow/current maturities of long-term debt and current notes payable is:
Operating Cash Flow
Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt and Current Notes Payable
The formula for operating cash flow/total debt is:

Total Debt
The formula for operating cash flow per share is:

CASE 10-5 NONCASH CHARGES
Owens Corning Fiberglass Corporation
For Immediate Release (February 6, 1992)
Owens Corning Takes $800 Million Non-Cash Charge to Accrue for Future Asbestos
Claims
“This action demonstrates our desire to put the asbestos situation behind us,” new
chairman and CEO Glen H. Hiner says.
Toledo, Ohio, February 6, 1992—Owens Corning Fiberglass Corp. (NYSE:OCF) today
announced that its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 1991, include a
special non-cash charge of $800 million to accrue for the estimated uninsured cost of future
asbestos claims the Company may receive through the balance of the decade. “This action
demonstrates our desire to put the asbestos situation behind us,” said Glen Hiner, Owens
Corning’s new chairman and chief executive officer. “After a thorough review of the situation
with outside consultants, we believe this accrual will be sufficient to cover the company’s unin-
sured costs for cases received until the year 2000. We will, of course, make adjustments to our
reserves if that becomes appropriate, but this is our best estimate of these uninsured costs.
With this action,” Mr. Hiner continued, “everyone can now focus once again on the funda-
mental strengths of the Company. We generate considerable amounts of cash, our operating
divisions are leaders in every market they serve throughout the world, and we have taken a
number of steps in the last few years to strengthen our competitive position even further.”
Owens Corning Fiberglass Corporation
For Immediate Release (June 20, 1996)
Owens Corning Initiates Federal Lawsuit, Records Post-1999 Asbestos
Provisions and Announces Dividend
NEW YORK, New York, June 20, 1996—A federal lawsuit aimed at fraudulent testing pro-
cedures for asbestos-related illnesses, involving tens of thousands of pending cases, was filed
yesterday by Owens Corning. The Company also announced the quantification of liabilities
related to post-1999 asbestos claims, the reinstatement of an annual dividend and a sales
goal of $5 billion by 1999.
The specific announcements are as follows:
• A lawsuit, alleging falsified medical test results in tens of thousands of asbestos claims,
was filed on June 19, 1996, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisi-
ana against the owners and operators of three pulmonary function testing laboratories.
Overall, a total of 40,000 cases may be impacted by the investigation for fraudulent test-
ing procedures. The lawsuit is the subject of a separate press release also disseminated
this morning.
• A net, after-tax charge of $545 million, or $9.56 per fully diluted share for asbestos
claims—received after 1999—will be recorded in the second quarter of 1996, as detailed
in a Form 8-K filed this morning with the SEC. Cash payments associated with this
charge will begin after the year 2000 and will be spread over 15 years or more.
• The Board of Directors has approved an annual dividend policy of 25 cents per share
and declared a quarterly dividend of 6-1/4 cents per share payable on October 15, 1996,
to shareholders of record as of September 30, 1996.
• The company expects to reach its sales goal of $5 billion in 1999—a full year ahead of
the original goal.
“The asbestos charge quantifies what we expect to be the cost to Owens Corning of
post-1999 claims,” stated Glen H. Hiner, chairman and chief executive officer. “We further
believe that the present value of the Owens Corning asbestos liability, including the current
charge, is less than the current discount in our stock price.”
In addition to these developments, Owens Corning announced it is engaged in substan-
tive discussions with 30 of the principal plaintiff law firms in an effort to obtain further reso-
lution of its asbestos liability. These discussions have encompassed the possibility of global
as well as individual law firm settlements.

“These meetings are by mutual consent,” stated Hiner. “The discussions will continue
and we expect to know by year end whether we can achieve further agreement. Plaintiff
attorneys involved in the talks stated they will not serve any more non-malignancy claims on
Owens Corning while negotiations continue.”
In reference to the dividend, Hiner stated, “we were able to initiate this action because
debt has been reduced to target levels and cash flow from operations will be in excess of in-
ternal funding requirements.”
“We are delighted to be able to reward our shareholders with a dividend,” said Hiner.
“Reinstating the dividend has been a priority of mine since joining the company and I am
pleased that we now are in a position to set the date.”
The Toledo-based company had 1995 sales of $3.6 billion and employs 18,000 people
in more than 30 countries.

April 29, 1998
Owens Corning opened a new front in its battle to avoid being swamped by tens
of thousands of damage claims filed by people who say they got sick from exposure to
asbestos-containing insulation produced by the company. Owens Corning charged in U.S.
District Court in Toledo, Ohio, that Allstate Insurance Co. is guilty of breach of contract by
failing to provide coverage.
Owens Corning announced in March 1998 that it might have to spend more than
expected to resolve asbestos claims because of growing damage awards to people with a
severe form of asbestos-linked cancer called mesothelioma.
Required
a. In the long run, cash receipts from operations is equal to revenue from operations.
Comment.
b. February 6, 1992—Owens Corning announced a special noncash charge of $800
million to accrue for the estimated uninsured cost of future asbestos claims the company
may receive through the balance of the decade. How much will the noncash charge
reduce gross earnings in 1992? Over what period of time is the expected outflow?

CASE 10-6 CASH MOVEMENTS AND PERIODIC INCOME DETERMINATION
“The estimating of income, under conditions of uncertainty as well as of certainty, requires
that the accountant trace carefully the relation between income flows and cash movements.”
“While it is true that there may not be an equality between the amount of revenue and
the amount of cash receipts for any period less than the duration of enterprise existence,
receipts are the elements with which we construct all measures of revenue. A dollar is
received at some time during the life of the enterprise for each dollar of revenue exhibited
during the fiscal period. The sum of the annual revenues for all fiscal periods is equal to the
amount of ultimate total revenue. There may be no equality between the amount of expense
and the amount of cash disbursements for the fiscal period and yet the two sums are equal
for the life of the enterprise. A dollar is disbursed at some time during the enterprise exis-
tence for each dollar exhibited as expense of the fiscal period.”*
“The accountant’s problem is essentially one of reconciling cash receipts with revenues
and cash disbursements with expenses. That is, for every revenue recognized but not received
in cash during the current period, an asset of equal value must be recorded (or a liability
must be amortized); for every expense recognized but not paid in cash in the current period,
a liability of equal value must be recognized but not paid in cash in the current period, a
liability of equal value must be recognized (or an asset must be amortized).”
Required
a. Income determination is an exact science. Comment.
b. Cash flow must be estimated. Comment.
c. In the long run, cash receipts from operations is equal to revenue from operations.
Comment.
d. Assume that a firm has a negative cash flow from operations in the short run. How
could this negative cash flow from operations be compensated for in the short run?
Discuss.
e. Assume that the reported operating income has been substantially more than the cash
flow from operations for the past two years. Comment on what will need to happen to
future cash flow from operations in order for the past reported income to hold up.

Summary
Summary Analysis Nike,
Inc. (Includes 2011
Financial Statements of
Form 10-K)
U
sers must be able to apply and understand financial statement analysis. They must
study ratio and trend analysis for meaning. This analysis is the difficult aspect of
interpreting financial statements. Chapters 6 through 10 have illustrated the tech-
nique of calculating ratios for the analysis of Nike, Inc.
This summary analysis brings together the analysis in Chapters 6 through 10 relating
to Nike. It adds information on a selected competitor and the industry. It also adds some
common-size analysis.
Nike–Background Information
Bill Bowerman, head track coach at the University of Oregon, teamed up with Philip Knight,
a former student, to form Blue Ribbon Sports in 1964. Blue Ribbon Sports became Nike in
1972. The name “Nike” was chosen because Nike was the Greek goddess of victory.
Nike specialized in athletic footwear until 1979. In 1979, the Nike apparel line was
launched, and in 1996, the Nike equipment division formed.
By 1999, Nike was the world’s largest supplier of athletic footwear and one of the
world’s largest suppliers of athletic apparel. Nike products are sold in many countries. Nike
and Adidas are possibly the only equipment, sports footwear, and apparel companies with
the infrastructure to sell extensively worldwide.
Bill Bowerman retired from the board in June 1999 and passed away in December
1999. Philip Knight is the chairman of the board. He stepped down as chief executive officer
at the end of 2004. Mark G. Parker is the chief executive officer and president of Nike.
He has been president, chief executive officer, and a director since January 2006. He has
been employed by Nike since 1979 with primary responsibilities in product research, design
and development, marketing, and brand management. (Proxy filed July 26, 2011.)

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (See 10-K, Item 7, In Part)
Selected Highlights
NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells high quality footwear, apparel, equipment
and accessory products worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and
apparel in the world. We sell our products to retail accounts, through NIKE-owned
retail stores and internet sales, which we refer to as our “Direct to Consumer”
operations, and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees, worldwide.
Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio
of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to
achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products,
building deep personal consumer connections with our brands, and delivering
compelling retail presentation and experiences.
. . . . .
Our fiscal 2011 results demonstrated our continued focus toward meeting our financial
goals, while positioning ourselves for sustainable, profitable long-term growth. Despite the
uncertain macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2011, we delivered record high revenues
and diluted earnings per share. Our revenues grew 10% to $20.9 billion, net income
increased 12% to $2.1 billion, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.39, a 14%
increase from fiscal 2010.
. . . . .
Futures Orders
Futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery
from June through November 2011 were 15% higher than the orders reported for the
comparable prior year period. This futures and advance order amount is calculated
based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be
translated during this period, which approximate current spot rates. Excluding the
impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 12%, primarily driven by a high
single-digit percentage increase in unit sales volume and a low single-digit percentage
increase in average price per unit for both footwear and apparel products.
Note: Item 7 of the Nike 10-K is approximately 30 pages. It is suggested that you read the
10-K, Item 7 before proceeding with this summary. After reviewing the summary, read Item 7
of the 10-K again. This will give you a very good understanding of Nike’s financial statements.

• There was also material increases in 2010 in income before income taxes, income taxes, and net
income. These increases were related to the charges in 2009 that were not present in 2010.

Liquidity
• Days’ sales in receivables declined materially in 2010 and then in 2011 came back to
approximately the same days’ sales in receivables as for 2009.

• Inventory turnover times per year increased moderately in both 2010 and 2011.
• Inventory turnover days decreased slightly in 2010 and substantially in 2011.
• Operating cycle decreased slightly in 2010 and moderately in 2011. There was a sub-
stantial improvement between 2009 and 2011.
• Working capital increased materially in 2010 and declined slightly in 2011.
• Current ratio increased materially in 2010 and then decreased materially in 2011.

Summary—Liquidity
Liquidity indicators fluctuated between 2009 and 2011 for receivables and inventory, ending
with reasonable indicators. There was a substantial improvement in the operating cycle
between 2009 and 2011.
The current ratio, acid-test ratio, and cash ratio appear to be very good at the end of
2011. They did decline materially in 2011.
Sales to working capital declined materially.
The ratio of operating cash flow/current maturities of long-term debt and current notes
payable increased very materially in 2010 and then decreased very materially in 2011, end-
ing with a reasonable coverage. Liquidity appears to be good to very good.
Long-Term Debt-Paying Ability
• Times interest earned was very good in all three years. It increased materially each year.
• Fixed charge coverage was very good in all three years. It increased moderately each year.
• Debt ratio was very good in all three years. It decreased moderately in 2010 and
increased moderately in 2011.
• Debt/equity was very good in all three years. It decreased substantially in 2010 and
increased substantially in 2011.
• Debt to tangible net worth was very good in all three years. Intangibles had a substantial
influence on the long-term debt position.
• Operating cash flow/total debt was very good in all three years. It had a very material
increase in 2010 and then settled back to approximately the same level as 2009.
Summary—Long-Term Debt-Paying Ability
The long-term debt-paying ability was very good.
Profitability
• Net profit margin increased materially in 2010 and slightly in 2011.
• Total asset turnover decreased substantially in 2010 and increased slightly in 2011.

Summary—Profitability
A number of ratios increased materially in 2010 and then increased slightly or moderately in
2011 (net profit margin, return on assets, return on investment, return on total equity, and
return on common equity).
Two asset turnover ratios decreased materially in 2010 and then increased slightly in
2011 (total asset turnover and operating asset turnover).
Operating ratios were not as impressive as many of the other ratios (operating income
margin, operating asset turnover and return on operating assets).
Two ratios did not change significantly (sales to fixed assets and gross profit margin).
Profitability overall was very good.
Investor Analysis
• Degree of financial leverage was very low.
• Diluted earnings per share increased materially in 2010 and 2011.
• Price/earnings ratio decreased slightly in 2010 and increased slightly in 2011.
• Percentage of earnings retained increased moderately in 2010 and slightly in 2011.
• Dividend payout decreased materially in 2010 and decreased slightly in 2011.
• Dividend yield decreased materially in 2010 and slightly in 2011.
• Book value per share increased materially in 2010 and moderately in 2011.
• Materiality of option compensation expense decreased materially in both 2010 and
2011.
• Operating cash flow per share increased very materially in 2010 and decreased very
materially in 2011.
• Operating cash flow/cash dividends increased very materially in 2010 and decreased
very materially in 2011.
• Year-end market price increased very materially in 2010 and 2011.
Summary—Investor Analysis
In general, investor analysis is good, although there was a mixture of results.
The impressive year-end market price increase appears to be responding to the signifi-
cant diluted earnings per share increase and a favorable profitability perspective, as well as
improved overall stock market conditions.
Three-Year Ratio Comparison (Exhibit 3)
The use of ratios can be very helpful in analysis, but caution must be exercised in drawing
conclusions. Many potential problems were discussed in previous chapters. Keep these
potential problems in mind when using ratios. Nike uses a year ended May 31 and has some-
what of a seasonal business. This could influence some of the ratios, particularly liquidity
ratios.

impairment negatively impact the profitability ratios for 2009. 2009 is part of our three-year
ratio comparison.
Ratio Comparison with Selected Competitor (Exhibit 4)
Nike has substantial competition which is illustrated by the following comments (in part) in its
2011 10-K:
Competition
The athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the United
States and on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of
athletic and leisure shoe companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports
equipment companies, and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure

Selected Competitor
Adidas has the closest resemblance to Nike. Adidas is a German company, and financial
statements using U.S. GAAP are not available for Adidas.
Skechers U.S.A., Inc., was selected as the closest competitor filing a 10-K.
Nike has a SIC 3021 – Rubber & Plastics Footwear, while Skechers U.S.A. has a SIC
3140 – Footwear (no rubber). Skechers U.S.A. describes its business in its December 31,
2010 10-K (in part) as follows:
General
We design and market Skechers-branded lifestyle and athletic footwear for men,
women and children under several unique lines. Our footwear reflects a combination
of style, quality and value that appeals to a broad range of consumers. In addition
to Skechers-branded lines, we also offer several uniquely branded fashion and street-
focused footwear lines for men, women and children. These lines are branded and
marketed separately from Skechers and appeal to specific audiences. Our brands are
sold through department and specialty stores, athletic and independent retailers,
and boutiques as well as catalog and Internet retailers. Along with wholesale
distribution, our footwear is available at our e-commerce websites and our own
retail stores. As of February 15th, 2011 we operated 105 concept stores, 99 factory
outlet stores and 40 warehouse outlet stores in the United States, and 28 concept
stores and 16 factory outlets internationally. Our objective is to profitably grow our
operations worldwide while leveraging our recognizable Skechers brand through our
strong product lines, innovative advertising and diversified distribution channels.
Skechers U.S.A. is much smaller than Nike as indicated by the following revenue and
assets:
Revenue:
Nike
$20,862,000,000
(Year ended May 31, 2011)
Skechers U.S.A.
$ 2,006,868,000
(Year ended December 31, 2010)
Total Assets:
Nike
$14,998,000,000
(At May 31, 2011)
Skechers U.S.A.
$ 1,304,794,000
(At December 31, 2010)
Again, caution must be exercised in drawing conclusions from the absolute numbers
and ratios as well as the analysis in general. Keep potential problems in mind when drawing
conclusions. Some of the potential problems on this comparison are the different year-ends,
somewhat seasonal nature of the business, and different size of firms. In this case, we would
likely be particularly concerned about the different year-ends and different size of firms.
Liquidity
• In the receivable area, Skechers is materially ahead of Nike, with days’ sales in receiv-
ables (days), accounts receivables turnover (times per year), and accounts receivable
turnover (days), all being better.
• In the inventory area, Nike is materially ahead of Skechers, with days’ sales in inventory
(days), inventory turnover (times per year), and inventory turnover in days (days), all
being materially better.
They do have somewhat different inventory methods, which could account for some of the
difference. The following information is derived from the Skechers 10-K:
Inventories
Inventories, principally finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost (based on the
first-in, first-out method) or market. The Company provides for estimated losses from
obsolete or slow-moving inventories and writes down the cost of inventory at the time
such determinations are made. Reserves are estimated based upon inventory on hand,
historical sales activity, and the expected net realizable value. The net realizable value is
determined based upon estimated sales prices of such inventory through off-price or
discount store channels.

The following indicates the inventory methods derived from the Nike 10-K:
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on a first-in, first-out
(“FIFO”) or moving average cost basis.
• Skechers has a moderately higher operating cycle, which favors Nike.
• Working capital cannot be compared. Nike is materially bigger than Skechers.
• Skechers’ current ratio is moderately higher than Nike’s. This is not necessarily good
because the Nike current ratio is very good, and Skechers possibly has too much inventory.
• Nike’s acid-test ratio is materially better than Skechers’.
• Nike’s cash ratio is materially better than Skechers’.
• Skechers’ sales to working capital is materially better than Nike’s, even with the appa-
rent high inventory.
• Nike’s operating cash flow/current maturities of long-term debt and current notes pay-
able is materially better than Skechers’.
Summary–Liquidity
In general, both firms appear to be in a good liquidity position, with the exception that Nike
should review its receivables closely while Skechers should review its inventory closely. Also,
Nike has a materially better operating cash flow/current maturities of long-term debt and
current notes payable.
Long-Term Debt-Paying Ability
• Nike has a materially better times interest earned and fixed charge coverage than Skech-
ers, but the Skechers coverage is good.
• Skechers has a materially better debt ratio, debt/equity, and debt to tangible net worth,
but the Nike ratios are good. Nike has a materially better operating cash flow/total debt.
Summary–Long-Term Debt-Paying Ability
Both firms appear to be in a good or very good debt position. The exception to this is the
low fixed charge coverage for Skechers.
Profitability
• Nike has a number of profitability indicators that are materially better than Skechers.
Included here are net profit margin, return on assets, operating income margin, return
on operating assets, sales to fixed assets, return on investment, return on total equity,
and return on common equity.
• Skechers has a number of profitability indicators that are materially better than Nike.
Included here are total asset turnover and operating asset turnover.
• Gross profit margin was approximately the same.
Summary—Profitability
Many of Nike’s profitability indicators were materially better than Skechers’. Skechers did
have a materially better total asset turnover and operating asset turnover.
Investor Analysis
• Neither company has a high degree of financial leverage.
• Price/earnings ratio was materially better for Nike.
• Skechers did not pay a dividend as indicated by percentage of earnings retained, divi-
dend payout, dividend yield, and operating cash flow/cash dividends.

Ratio Comparison with Industry (Exhibit 5)
Comparison with the industry is frequently a problem as to the quality of the comparison.
The companies in the industry will typically be using different accounting methods. An
example would be costing of inventory, with some companies using LIFO, some using FIFO,
and some using an average. Industry ratios frequently do not address issues such as income
statement unusual or infrequent items, equity earnings, discontinued operations, extraordi-
nary items, or noncontrolling interest.
A problem with using industry data at a library is that commercial publications some-
times send the material to a library several months after general distribution. This brings a
time issue to be considered. The U.S. Department of Commerce Quarterly Financial Report
is online and represents relatively recent data. These data may be of limited or no use,
depending on the company that is being analyzed.
The industry ratios available are frequently of a broader industry coverage than the
ideal. Nike is under SIC Rubber and Plastics Footwear (3021). Robert Morris Associates
Annual Statement Studies publishes some industry material using SIC 3052 Manufacturing
Rubber and Plastics, Hose and Belting. Dun & Bradstreet Industry Norms and Key Business
Ratios publishes SIC 30 Rubber and Plastics. The U.S. Department of Commerce publishes
Quarterly Financial Report for manufacturing, mining, and the trade corporations. They
have dropped SIC in favor of NAICS. They combine subsectors 315 and 316, apparel and
leather products. For Nike, the NAICS is 316211, Rubber and Plastics Footwear
Manufacturing.
In Nike’s performance graph presented in the 2009 10-K, Nike compared its stock per-
formance for the period May 2006 – May 2011 with the S&P 500 Index, Total Returns,
Dow Jones U.S. Footwear Index, S&P 500 Apparel, Accessories and Luxury Goods. For
stock performance, Nike closely resembled Dow Jones U.S. Footwear Index. Nike was up
approximately 222%, while Dow Jones U.S. Footwear Index was up 170%.
Although there are problems with using industry comparison, the effort is usually bene-
ficial. It is necessary to be cautious when drawing conclusions. You may want to review
“Caution in Using Industry Averages” in Chapter 5.
Consider picking out four or five close competitors of the firm that you are analyzing
and compute the industry average. This will likely result in a more meaningful comparison
than using published industry data.
Liquidity
• Nike’s receivables appear to be materially less liquid than the industry. Part of this can
likely be explained by the May 31 year-end for Nike. The difference between the Nike
ratios and the industry is so material that it is likely that most firms in the industry are
using shorter credit terms.
• Nike’s inventory appears to be materially more liquid than the industry. Part of this can
likely be explained by the May 31 year-end for Nike. Possibly, many firms in the indus-
try are using a different inventory costing method than Nike uses.
• The current ratio, acid-test, and cash ratio are materially better for Nike than the indus-
try. These were influenced by less liquid receivables but more liquid inventory. They are
also influenced by the materially better cash ratio of Nike.
• Sales to working capital is materially less for Nike than the industry.
Summary—Liquidity
We do not have a good industry comparison with Nike in the liquidity area. It is possible that
Nike has substantially different policies in the receivables and inventory areas than the industry.
Long-Term Debt-Paying Ability
• Nike’s time interest earned, debt ratio, and debt/equity are materially better than the
industry.
Summary—Long-Term Debt-Paying Ability
Nike’s long-term debt-paying ability appears to be materially better than the industry.

Profitability
All of the profitability ratios were materially better for Nike than the industry, except for
operating asset turnover. Operating asset turnover was materially better for the industry.
Summary—Profitability
Nike had an outstanding profit year in relation to the industry.
Investor Analysis
• The degree of financial leverage is materially lower for Nike than for the industry.
• The price/earnings ratio is materially higher for Nike than the 500 composite. Consider-
ing the profitability ratios for Nike, a higher price/earnings ratio is justified.
• Nike retained a materially higher percentage of earnings than did the industry.
• The dividend yield was materially lower for Nike than for the industry.
Summary—Investor Analysis
Only a few comparisons are possible in the investor area. The comparisons are favorable to-
ward Nike, except for dividend yield.
Orders
Worldwide futures and advance orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel,
scheduled for delivery from June through November 2011, were $10.3 billion
compared to $8.8 billion for the same period last year. 10-K
Summary
In general, the years 2009–2011 appear to be very good for Nike in terms of liquidity. The
long-term debt-paying ability was very good. This appears to be the case from both an
income statement and a balance sheet viewpoint. Profitability appears to be very good. Im-
pressive year-end market price increase appears to be responding to an impressive diluted
earnings per share increase and a favorable profitability perspective.

Chapter
11
Expanded Analysis
T
his chapter reviews special areas related to the usefulness of ratios and financial anal-
yses. These special areas are as follows: (1) financial ratios as perceived by commer-
cial loan departments, (2) financial ratios as perceived by corporate controllers,
(3) financial ratios as perceived by certified public accountants, (4) financial ratios as per-
ceived by chartered financial analysts, (5) financial ratios used in annual reports, (6) degree
of conservatism and quality of earnings, (7) forecasting financial failure, (8) analytical review
procedures, (9) management’s use of analysis, (10) use of LIFO reserves, (11) graphing finan-
cial information, (12) management of earnings, (13) the housing bust, and (14) valuation.
Financial Ratios as Perceived by Commercial Loan Departments
Financial ratios can be used by a commercial loan department to aid the loan officers in
deciding whether to grant a commercial loan and in maintaining control of a loan once it is
granted.1 In order to gain insights into how commercial loan departments view financial
ratios, a questionnaire was sent to the commercial loan departments of the 100 largest banks
in the United States. Usable responses were received from 44% of them.
A list of 59 financial ratios was drawn from the financial literature, textbooks, and pub-
lished industry data for this study. The study set three objectives: (1) the significance of each
ratio, in the opinion of commercial loan officers, (2) how frequently each ratio is included in
loan agreements, and (3) what a specific financial ratio primarily measures, in the opinion of
commercial loan officers. For the primary measure, the choices were liquidity, long-term
debt-paying ability, profitability, or other. Exhibit 11-1 lists the ratios included in this study.
Most Significant Ratios and Their Primary Measure
Exhibit 11-2 displays the 10 financial ratios given the highest significance rating by the com-
mercial loan officers, as well as the primary measure of these ratios. The highest rating is a 9,
and the lowest rating is a 0.
Most of the ratios given a high significance rating were regarded primarily as measures
of liquidity or debt. Only 2 of the top 10 ratios measure profitability, 5 measure debt, and

3 measure liquidity. The two profitability ratios were two different computations of the net
profit margin: (1) net profit margin after tax and (2) net profit margin before tax. Two of
the top three ratios were measures of debt, and the other ratio was a measure of liquidity.
The debt/equity ratio was given the highest significance rating, with the current ratio the sec-
ond highest. We can assume that the financial ratios rated most significant by commercial
loan officers would have the greatest influence on a loan decision.
Ratios Appearing Most Frequently in Loan Agreements
A commercial bank may elect to include a ratio as part of a loan agreement. This would be a
way of using ratios to control an outstanding loan. Exhibit 11-3 contains a list of the 10 fi-
nancial ratios that appear most frequently in loan agreements, along with an indication of
what each ratio primarily measures. For the two ratios that do not have a primary measure
indicated, there was no majority opinion as to what the ratio primarily measured. Six of the
ratios that appear most frequently in loan agreements primarily measure debt, two primarily
measure liquidity, and none primarily measure profitability.
The two top ratios, debt/equity and current ratio, were given the highest significance rat-
ing. The dividend payout ratio was the third most likely ratio to appear in loan agreements,
but it was not rated as a highly significant ratio. Logically, this ratio appears in loan agree-
ments as a means of controlling the outflow of cash for dividends.
Financial Ratios as Perceived by Corporate Controllers
To get the views of corporate controllers on important issues relating to financial ratios, a ques-
tionnaire was sent to the controllers of the companies included in the Fortune 500 list of the
largest industrials.2 The study excluded companies 100% owned or controlled by another firm.
The survey received a usable response rate of 19.42%. The questionnaire used the same ratios
used for the commercial loan department survey. The three objectives of this study were the
determination of: (1) the significance of a specific ratio as perceived by controllers, (2) which fi-
nancial ratios are included as corporate objectives, and (3) the primary measure of each ratio.
Most Significant Ratios and Their Primary Measure
Exhibit 11-4 displays the 10 financial ratios given the highest significance rating by the

current ratio. In comparing the responses of the commercial loan officers and the controllers,
the controllers rate the profitability ratios as having the highest significance, while the com-
mercial loan officers rate the debt and liquidity ratios the highest.
Key Financial Ratios Included as Corporate Objectives
Many firms have selected key financial ratios to be included as part of their corporate objec-
tives. The next section of the survey was designed to determine what ratios the firms used in
their corporate objectives. Exhibit 11-5 lists the 10 ratios most likely to be included in corpo-
rate objectives according to the controllers. Nine of the ratios included in Exhibit 11-5 were
also included in Exhibit 11-4. One ratio, accounts receivable turnover in days, appears in the
top 10 ratios in relation to corporate objectives but not in the top 10 significant ratios. One
ratio, the price/earnings ratio, appears in the top 10 ratios in relation to significance but not
in the top 10 ratios used for corporate objectives.
Logically, there would be a high correlation between the ratios rated as highly signifi-
cant and those included in corporate objectives. The debt/equity ratio and the current ratio
are rated higher on the objectives list than on the significance list. This makes sense since a
firm has to have some balance in its objectives between liquidity, debt, and profitability.

Financial Ratios as Perceived by Certified Public Accountants
A questionnaire was sent to one-third of the members of the Ohio Society of Certified Public
Accountants who were registered as a partner in a CPA firm.3 A total of 495 questionnaires
were sent, and the usable response rate was 18.8%.
This questionnaire used the same ratios as were used for the commercial loan depart-
ment and corporate controllers. The specific objectives of this study were to determine the
following from the viewpoint of the CPA:
1. The specific financial ratios that CPAs view primarily as a measure of liquidity, debt,
and profitability.
2. The relative importance of the financial ratios viewed as a measure of liquidity, debt, or
profitability.
Exhibit 11-6 displays the 10 financial ratios given the highest significance rating by the
CPAs and the primary measure of these ratios. The highest rating is a 9 and the lowest is a 0.
The CPAs gave the highest significance rating to two liquidity ratios—the current ratio
and the accounts receivable turnover in days. The highest rated profitability ratio was after-
tax return on equity, and the highest rated debt ratio was debt/equity.
Financial Ratios as Perceived by Chartered Financial Analysts4
Exhibit 11-7 displays the 10 financial ratios given the highest significance rating by chartered
financial analysts (CFAs) and the primary measure of these ratios. Again, the highest rating
is a 9 and the lowest rating is a 0.
The surveyed CFAs gave the highest significance ratings to profitability ratios, with the
exception of the price/earnings ratio. Return on equity after tax received the highest signifi-
cance by a wide margin. Four of the next five most significant ratios were also profitability
ratios—earnings per share, net profit margin after tax, return on equity before tax, and net
profit margin before tax.
The price/earnings ratio—categorized by the analysts as an “other” measure—received
the second highest significance rating. CFAs apparently view profitability and what is being
paid for those profits before turning to liquidity and debt.
The two highest rated debt ratios were fixed charge coverage and times interest earned,
rated seventh and tenth, respectively. Both of these ratios indicate a firm’s ability to carry
debt. The highest rated debt ratio relating to the balance sheet was the debt/equity ratio,
rated as the eleventh most significant. Surprisingly, more significance was placed on debt
ratios relating to the ability to carry debt than on those relating to the ability to meet debt
obligations.

The highest rated liquidity ratio was the acid-test ratio, rated eighth. The second highest
liquidity ratio was the current ratio, rated twentieth.5
Financial Ratios Used in Annual Reports
Financial ratios are used to interpret and explain financial statements.6 Used properly, they
can be effective tools in evaluating a company’s liquidity, debt position, and profitability.
Probably no tool is as effective in evaluating where a company has been financially and pro-
jecting its financial future as the proper use of financial ratios.
A firm can use its annual report effectively to relate financial data by the use of financial
ratios. To determine how effectively firms use ratios to communicate financial data, the an-
nual reports of 100 firms identified in the Fortune 500 industrial companies were reviewed.
The 100 firms represented the first 20 of each 100 in the Fortune 500 list. The objective of
this research project was to determine (1) which financial ratios were frequently reported in
annual reports, (2) where the ratios were disclosed in the annual reports, and (3) what com-
putational methodology was used to compute these ratios.
Exhibit 11-8 indicates the ratios disclosed most frequently in the annual reports
reviewed and the section of the annual report where the ratios were located. The locations
were the president’s letter, management discussion, management highlights, financial review,
and financial summary. In many cases, the same ratio was located in several sections, so the
numbers under the sections in Exhibit 11-8 do not add up to the total number of annual
reports where the ratio was included.
Seven ratios appeared more than 50% of the time in one section or another. These ratios
and the number of times found were earnings per share (100), dividends per share (98), book
value per share (84), working capital (81), return on equity (62), profit margin (58), and
effective tax rate (50). The current ratio was found 47 times, and the next ratio in order of
disclosure, the debt/capital ratio, appeared 23 times. From this listing, we can conclude that
profitability ratios and ratios related to investing were the most popular. Exhibit 11-8
excludes ratios not disclosed at least five times.
Logically, profitability ratios and ratios related to investing were the most popular for
inclusion in the annual report. Including ratios related to investing in the annual report
makes sense because one of the annual report’s major objectives is to inform stockholders.
A review of the methodology used indicated that wide differences of opinion exist on
how some of the ratios should be computed. This is especially true of the debt ratios. The
two debt ratios most frequently disclosed were the debt/capital ratio and the debt/equity

ratio. This book does not cover the debt/capital ratio. It is similar to the debt/equity ratio,
except that the denominator includes sources of capital, in addition to stockholders’ equity.
The annual reports disclosed the debt/capital ratio 23 times and used 11 different formu-
las. One firm used average balance sheet amounts between the beginning and the end of the
year, while 22 firms used ending balance sheet figures. The debt/equity ratio was disclosed
19 times, and 6 different formulas were used. All firms used the ending balance sheet
accounts to compute the debt/equity ratio.
In general, no major effort is being made to explain financial results by the disclosure of
financial ratios in annual reports. Several financial ratios that could be interpreted as impor-
tant were not disclosed or were disclosed very infrequently. This is particularly important
for ratios that cannot be reasonably computed by outsiders because of a lack of data such as
accounts receivable turnover.
At present, no regulatory agency such as the SEC or the FASB accepts responsibility for
determining either the content of financial ratios or the format of presentation for annual
reports, except for the ratio earnings per share. Many practical and theoretical issues relate
to the computation of financial ratios. As long as each firm can exercise its opinion as to the
practical and theoretical issues, there will be a great divergence of opinion on how a particu-
lar ratio should be computed.
Degree of Conservatism and Quality of Earnings
A review of financial statements, including the notes, indicates their conservatism with
regard to accounting policies. Accounting policies that result in the slowest reporting of
income are the most conservative. When a firm has conservative accounting policies, it is
said that its earnings are of high quality. This section reviews a number of areas that often
indicate a firm’s degree of conservatism in reporting income.
Inventory
Under inflationary conditions, the matching of current cost against the current revenue results
in the lowest income for a period of time. The LIFO inventory method follows this procedure.

FIFO, the least conservative method, uses the oldest costs and matches them against revenue.
Other inventory methods fall somewhere between the results of LIFO and FIFO.
For a construction firm that has long-term contracts, the two principal accounting meth-
ods that relate to inventory are the completed-contract method and the percentage-of-
completion method. The conservative completed-contract method recognizes all of the
income when the contract is completed; the percentage-of-completion method recognizes
income as work progresses on the contract.
Fixed Assets
Two accounting decisions related to fixed assets can have a significant influence on income:
the method of depreciation and the period of time selected to depreciate an asset.
The conservative methods, sum-of-the-years’-digits and declining-balance, recognize a
large amount of depreciation in the early years of the asset’s life. The straight-line method,
the least conservative method, recognizes depreciation in equal amounts over each year of
the asset’s life.
Sometimes a material difference in the asset’s life used for depreciation occurs between
firms. Comparing the lives used for depreciation for similar firms can be a clue as to how
conservative the firms are in computing depreciation. The shorter the period of time used,
the lower the income.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include goodwill, patents, and copyrights. Research and development
(R&D) costs are a type of intangible asset, but they are expensed as incurred. The shorter
the period of time used to recognize the cost of the intangible asset, the more conservative
the accounting. (Goodwill is not amortized, but it is tested for impairment.)
Some firms spend very large sums on R&D, and others spend little or nothing. Because
of the requirement that R&D costs be expensed in the period incurred, the income of a firm
that does considerable research is reduced substantially in the period that the cost is
incurred. This results in more conservative earnings.
Pensions
Two points relating to pensions should be examined when the firm has a defined benefit
plan. One is the assumed discount rate used to compute the actuarial present value of the
accumulated benefit obligation and the projected benefit obligation. The higher the interest
rate used, the lower the present value of the liability and the lower the immediate pension
cost. The other item is the rate of compensation increase used in computing the projected
benefit obligations. If the rate is too low, the projected benefit obligation is too low. If the
rate is too high, the projected benefit obligation is too high.
Forecasting Financial Failure
There have been many academic studies on the use of financial ratios to forecast financial
failure. Basically, these studies try to isolate individual ratios or combinations of ratios that
can be observed as trends that may forecast failure.
A reliable model that can be used to forecast financial failure can also be used by manage-
ment to take preventive measures. Such a model can aid investors in selecting and disposing of
stocks. Banks can use it to aid in lending decisions and in monitoring loans. Firms can use it in
making credit decisions and in monitoring accounts receivable. In general, many sources can
use such a model to improve the allocation and control of resources. A model that forecasts fi-
nancial failure can also be valuable to an auditor. It can aid in the determination of audit pro-
cedures and in making a decision as to whether the firm will remain as a going concern.
Financial failure can be described in many ways. It can mean liquidation, deferment of
payments to short-term creditors, deferment of payments of interest on bonds, deferment of
payments of principal on bonds, or the omission of a preferred dividend. One of the prob-
lems in examining the literature on forecasting financial failure is that different authors use

different criteria to indicate failure. When reviewing the literature, always determine the cri-
teria used to define financial failure.
This book reviews two of the studies that deal with predicting financial failure. Based on
the number of references to these two studies in the literature, they appear to be particularly
significant on the subject of forecasting financial failure.
Univariate Model
William Beaver reported his univariate model in a study published in The Accounting
Review in January 1968.7 A univariate model uses a single variable. Such a model would use
individual financial ratios to forecast financial failure. The Beaver study classified a firm as
failed when any one of the following events occurred in the 1954–1964 period: bankruptcy,
bond default, an overdrawn bank account, or nonpayment of a preferred stock dividend.
Beaver paired 79 failed firms with a similar number of successful firms drawn from
Moody’s Industrial Manuals. For each failed firm in the sample, a successful one was
selected from the same industry. The Beaver study indicated that the following ratios were
the best for forecasting financial failure (in the order of their predictive power):
1. Cash flow/total debt
2. Net income/total assets (return on assets)
3. Total debt/total assets (debt ratio)
Beaver speculated as to the reason for these results:
My interpretation of the finding is that the cash flow, net income, and debt positions
cannot be altered and represent permanent aspects of the firm. Because failure is too
costly to all involved, the permanent, rather than the short-term, factors largely
determine whether or not a firm will declare bankruptcy or default on a bond payment.8
Source: William Beaver, The Accounting Review
Assuming that the ratios identified by Beaver are valid in forecasting financial failure, it
would be wise to pay particular attention to trends in these ratios when following a firm. Beaver’s
reasoning for seeing these ratios as valid in forecasting financial failure appears to be very sound.
These three ratios for Nike for 2011 have been computed earlier. Cash flow/total debt
was 35.15%, which appears to be very good. Net income/total assets (return on assets) was
14.50%, which appears to be very good. The debt ratio was 34.37%, which again is very
good. Thus, Nike appears to have minimal risk of financial failure.
The Beaver study also computed the mean values of 13 financial statement items for each
year before failure. Several important relationships were indicated among the liquid asset items.9
1. Failed firms have less cash but more accounts receivable.
2. When cash and receivables are added together, as they are in quick assets and current
assets, the difference between failed and successful firms is obscured because the cash
and receivables differences are working in opposite directions.
3. Failed firms tend to have less inventory.
These results indicate that particular attention should be paid to three current assets
when forecasting financial failure: cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. The analyst
should be alert for low cash and inventory and high accounts receivable.
Multivariate Model
Edward I. Altman and Thomas P. McGough developed a multivariate model to predict
bankruptcy.10 His model uses five financial ratios weighted in order to maximize the predic-
tive power of the model. The model produces an overall discriminant score, called a Z score.
The Altman model is as follows:
Z ¼ :012 X1 þ :014 X2 þ :033 X3 þ :006 X4 þ :010 X5
X1 ¼ Working Capital/Total Assets
This computation is a measure of the net liquid assets of the firm relative to the total
capitalization.

X2 = Retained Earnings (balance sheet)/Total Assets
This variable measures cumulative profitability over time.
X3 = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets
This variable measures the productivity of the firm’s assets, extracting any tax or lever-
age factors.
X4 = Market Value of Equity/Book Value of Total Debt
This variable measures how much the firm’s assets can decline in value before the liabil-
ities exceed the assets and the firm becomes insolvent. Equity is measured by the combined
market value of all shares of stock, preferred and common, while debt includes both current
and long-term debts.
X5 = Sales/Total Assets
This variable measures the sales-generating ability of the firm’s assets.
When computing the Z score, the ratios are expressed in absolute percentage terms.
Thus, X1 (working capital/total assets) of 25% is noted as 25.
The Altman model was developed using manufacturing companies whose asset size was
between $1 million and $25 million. The original sample by Altman and the test samples
used the period 1946–1965. The model’s accuracy in predicting bankruptcies in more recent
years (1970–1973) was reported in a 1974 article.11 Not all of the companies included in the
test were manufacturing companies, although the model was initially developed by using
only manufacturing companies.
With the Altman model, the lower the Z score, the more likely that the firm will go
bankrupt. By computing the Z score for a firm over several years, it can be determined
whether the firm is moving toward a more likely or less likely position with regard to bank-
ruptcy. In a later study that covered the period 1970–1973, a Z score of 2.675 was estab-
lished as a practical cutoff point. Firms that scored below 2.675 are assumed to have
characteristics similar to those of past failures.12 Current GAAP recognize more liabilities
than the GAAP used at the time of this study. Thus, we would expect firms to score some-
what less than in the time period 1970–1973. The Altman model is substantially less signifi-
cant if there is no firm market value for the stock (preferred and common), because variable
X4 in the model requires that the market value of the stock be determined.

The Z Score for Nike for 2011 was 7.75. Considering that higher scores are better and
that companies with scores below 2.675 are assumed to have characteristics similar to those
of past failures, Nike is a very healthy company.
There are many academic studies on the use of ratios to forecast financial failure. These
studies help substantiate that firms with weak ratios are more likely to go bankrupt than
firms with strong ratios. Since no conclusive model has yet been developed, the best
approach is probably an integrated one. As a supplemental measure, it may also be helpful
to compute some of the ratios that appear useful in forecasting financial failure.
Analytical Review Procedures
Statement of Auditing Standards No. 23, “Analytical Review Procedures,” provides guid-
ance for the use of such procedures in audits. The objective of analytical review procedures
is to isolate significant fluctuations and unusual items in operating statistics.
Analytical review procedures may be performed at various times, including the planning
stage, during the audit itself, and near the completion of the audit. Some examples of analyti-
cal review procedures that may lead to special audit procedures follow:
1. Horizontal common-size analysis of the income statement may indicate that an item,
such as selling expenses, is abnormally high for the period. This could lead to a close
examination of the selling expenses.
2. Vertical common-size analysis of the income statement may indicate that the cost of
goods sold is out of line in relation to sales, in comparison with prior periods.
3. A comparison of accounts receivable turnover with the industry data may indicate that
receivables are turning over much slower than is typical for the industry. This may
indicate that receivables should be analyzed closely.
4. Cash flow in relation to debt may have declined significantly, indicating a materially
reduced ability to cover debt from internal cash flow.
5. The acid-test ratio may have declined significantly, indicating a materially reduced
ability to pay current liabilities with current assets less inventories.
When the auditor spots a significant trend in a statement or ratio, follow-up procedures
should be performed to determine the reason. Such an investigation can lead to significant
findings.
Management’s Use of Analysis
Management can use financial ratios and common-size analysis as aids in many ways. Anal-
ysis can indicate the relative liquidity, debt, and profitability of a firm. Analysis can also
indicate how investors perceive the firm and can help detect emerging problems and
strengths in a firm. As indicated previously, financial ratios can also be used as part of the
firm’s corporate objectives. Using financial ratios in conjunction with the budgeting process
can be particularly helpful. An objective of the budgeting process is to determine the firm’s
game plan. The budget can consist of an overall comprehensive budget and many separate
budgets, such as a production budget.
The comprehensive budget relating to financial statements indicates how a firm plans to
get from one financial position (balance sheet) to another. The income statement details how
the firm changed internally from one balance sheet position to another in terms of revenue
and expenses. The statement of cash flows indicates how the firm’s cash changed from one
balance sheet to another.
A proposed comprehensive budget should be compared with financial ratios that have
been agreed upon as part of the firm’s corporate objectives. For example, if corporate objec-
tives include a current ratio of 2:1, a debt equity of 40%, and a return on equity of 15%,
then the proposed comprehensive budget should be compared with these corporate objec-
tives before the budget is accepted as the firm’s overall game plan. If the proposed compre-
hensive budget will not result in the firm achieving its objectives, management should
attempt to change the game plan in order to achieve its objectives. If management cannot

change the proposed comprehensive budget satisfactorily to achieve the corporate objectives,
they should know this when the comprehensive budget is accepted.
Use of LIFO Reserves
A firm that uses LIFO usually discloses a LIFO reserve account in a note on the face of the
balance sheet. If a LIFO reserve account is not disclosed, there is usually some indication of
an amount that approximates current cost. Nike uses first-in, first-out or moving average;
therefore, it does not have a LIFO reserve. Thus, Sherwin-Williams Company was selected
to illustrate LIFO reserve analysis.
In its 2010 annual report, Sherwin-Williams Company disclosed that the excess of FIFO
over LIFO was $277,164,00 and $250,454,000 for 2010 and 2009, respectively. This infor-
mation can be used for supplemental analysis of inventory and (in general) the analysis of li-
quidity, debt, and profitability. Supplemental analysis using this additional inventory
information can be particularly significant when there is a substantial LIFO reserve and/or a
substantial change in the reserve.
For Sherwin-Williams Company, an approximation of the increase or decrease in
income if inventory is at approximate current acquisition costs could be computed by com-
paring the change in inventory, net of any tax effect. For 2010, compute the approximation
of the income if the inventory were at approximate current acquisition costs as follows:
In thousands

8,494
(d) Net increase in income [a−c]
18,216
Estimated income if the inventory were presented at approximate
current acquisitions cost
$480,701
Specific liquidity and debt ratios can be recomputed, taking into consideration the adjusted
inventory figure. To make these computations, add the gross inventory reserve to the
inventory disclosed in current assets. Add the approximate additional taxes to the current
liabilities.
Estimate the additional tax figure by multiplying the gross LIFO reserve by the effective
tax rate. This tax figure relates to the additional income that would have been reported in
the current year and all prior years if the higher inventory amounts had been reported. The
additional tax amount is a deferred tax amount that is added to current liabilities, to be con-
servative. The difference between the additional inventory amount and the additional tax
amount is added to retained earnings because it represents the total prior influence on net
income. The adjusted figures for Sherwin-Williams Company at the end of 2010 follow:
Inventory:
Thousands
As disclosed on the balance sheet
$
917,701

As disclosed on the balance sheet
$4,824,489
Increase in retained earnings ($277,164 −$88,138)
189,026
$5,013,515
An adjusted cost of goods sold can also be estimated using the change in the inventory
reserve. A net increase in the inventory reserve would reduce the cost of goods sold. A net
decrease in inventory reserve would increase the cost of goods sold.

The adjusted liquidity, debt, and profitability ratios could possibly be considered to be
more realistic than the unadjusted price computations because of the use of current acquisi-
tion costs for inventory.
For many of the ratios, we cannot generalize about whether the ratio will improve or
decline when the LIFO reserve is used. For example, if the current ratio is above 2.00, then it
may not improve when the firm has a high tax rate. When the current ratio and/or tax rate
is low, the current ratio will likely improve.
The Sherwin-Williams Company inventory disclosure on its December 21, 2010 annual
report follows:

Note 4—Inventories
Inventories were stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined principally on the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The following presents the effect on inventories, net income and
net income per share had the company used the first-in, first-out (FIFO) inventory valuation
method adjusted for income taxes at the statutory rate and assuming no other adjustments.
Management believes that the use of LIFO results in a better matching of costs and revenues.
This information is presented to enable the reader to make comparisons with companies using
the FIFO method of inventory valuation. During 2009, certain inventories accounted for on the
LIFO method were reduced, resulting in the liquidation of certain quantities carried at costs pre-
vailing in prior years. The impact on net income of such liquidation was $8,634.

Note: Notice that Note 4 discloses a decrease in net income due to LIFO of $16,394 (in
thousands), while our prior estimate was $18,216 (in thousands).
Note: When LIFO inventories are reduced, this brings out lower cost inventory to cost of
goods sold. This increases profits for the year when the LIFO inventory was reduced. This is
referred to as the LIFO layers effect.
“During 2009 certain inventories accounted for on the LIFO method were reduced,
resulting in the liquidation of certain quantities carried at costs prevailing in prior years. The
impact on net income of such liquidation was $8,634,000.”
Graphing Financial Information
It has become popular to use graphs in annual reports to present financial information.
Graphs make it easier to grasp key financial information. They can be a better communica-
tion device than a written report or a tabular presentation because they communicate by
means of pictures and, thus, create more immediate mental images.
There are many forms of graphs. Some popular forms used by accountants are line, col-
umn, bar, and pie graphs. These forms will be briefly described here, but a detailed descrip-
tion of those and other forms can be found in reference books and articles.13
The line graph uses a set of points connected by a line to show change over time. It is im-
portant for the vertical axis to start at zero and that it not be broken. Not starting the verti-
cal axis at zero and/or breaking the vertical axis can result in a very misleading presentation.
Exhibit 11-9 illustrates a line graph.

A column graph has vertical columns. As for a line graph, it is important that the verti-
cal axis start at zero and that it not be broken. A column graph is often the best form of
graph for presenting accounting data. Exhibit 11-10 presents a column graph.
A bar graph is similar to a column graph, except that the bars are horizontal. Exhibit 11-11
illustrates a bar graph.
A pie graph is divided into segments. This type of graph makes a comparison of the segments,
which must add up to 100%. A pie graph can mislead if it creates an optical illusion. Also, some
accounting data do not fit on a pie graph. Exhibit 11-12 illustrates a pie graph.

Management of Earnings
Chapter 1 describes cash basis as recognizing revenue when cash is received and recognizing
expenses when cash is paid. It was indicated that the cash basis usually does not provide reason-
able information about the entity’s earnings capability in the short run. Because of the shortcom-
ings of the cash basis, the accrual basis has been adopted for income reporting for most firms.
With the accrual basis, revenue is recognized when realized (realization concept) and
expenses are recognized when incurred (matching concept). As indicated in Chapter 1, use of
the accrual basis complicates the accounting process, but the end result is more representative
than the cash basis of an entity’s financial condition. Without the accrual basis, accountants

Nike includes the following comment in its Management Discussion and Analysis of Fi-
nancial Condition and Results of Operation in its 2011 annual report:
Critical Accounting Policies
Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations
are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting
policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial
statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Because of the
uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we
use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting
policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for endorsement
contracts. These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our
financial statements as of a given date. However, since our business cycle is relatively
short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month
period following the financial statement date. Thus, these policies generally affect only
the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters.
Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of
any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different
amounts being reported.
The accounting policies described in detail were the following:
• Revenue recognition
• Allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable
• Inventory reserves
• Contingent payments under endorsement contracts
• Property, plant and equipment and definite-lived assets
• Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
• Hedge accounting for derivatives
• Stock-based compensation
• Taxes
• Other contingencies
Thus, Nike describes the proper use of estimates and judgments to prepare its financial
statements under generally accepted accounting principles.
Some firms have used estimates and judgments to improperly manipulate their financial
statements. Other firms have deliberately made errors to manipulate their financial state-
ments. This results in financial statements that are not a proper representation of financial
condition and results of operations, this created a substantial problem during the 1990s. The
former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt, had this to say
as part of his address entitled the “Numbers Game,” at the New York University Center for
Law and Business on September 28, 1998:
Increasingly, I have become concerned that the motivation to meet Wall Street earnings
expectations may be overriding common sense business practices. Too many corporate
managers, auditors, and analysts are participants in a game of nods and winks. In the
zeal to satisfy consensus earnings estimates and project a smooth earnings path,
wishful thinking may be winning the day over faithful representation.
Source: Arthur Levitt at the New York University Center for Law and Business, Sept. 28, 1998
As a result, I fear that we are witnessing an erosion in the quality of earnings, and
therefore, the quality of financial reporting. Managing may be giving way to
manipulations; integrity may be losing out to illusion.

Many in corporate America are just as frustrated and concerned about this trend as
we, at the SEC, are. They know how difficult it is to hold the line on good practices
when their competitors operate in the gray area between legitimacy and outright fraud.
A gray area where the Accounting is being perverted; where managers are cutting
corners; and, where earnings reports reflect the desires of management rather than the
underlying financial performance of the company.14
Thus, both the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the fi-
nancial community were concerned about the apparent increase in the inappropriate man-
agement of earnings during the 1990s. We can speculate on why there was an increase in the
improper management of earnings during the 1990s. Some of the likely reasons are as follows:
(1) conviction that the capital markets would pay more for a stock that represented smooth
earnings rather than peaks and valleys of earnings, (2) increase in the awarding of stock
options as a means of compensation as opposed to cash, (3) substantial negative market reac-
tion when a company would not meet its numbers, and (4) possibly an all-time high in greed.
The general public did not appear to be overly concerned about the increase in the
improper management of earnings until the Enron situation developed in 2001. A possible rea-
son for this lack of concern was the substantial increase in stock prices during the 1990s. Start-
ing in 2000, stock prices experienced substantial declines. These declines in stock prices likely
influenced the general public to be concerned about the improper management of earnings.
There are many ways to manage earnings improperly. We don’t know of all the possibil-
ities, but the ways that we do know would require us to write a separate book. We do know
that revenue recognition is often involved in the manipulation of financial reports. The Gen-
eral Accounting Office, Congress’s investigative arm, reported in an October 2002 report to
the Senate Banking Committee that earnings restatements cost investors $100 billion in the
prior five years. Earnings restatements rose by about 145% from 1997 through June 2002.
Revenue-recognition issues arose in 38% of the cases studied.15
Revenue recognition often also involves inventory, accounts receivable, and cash flow. For
example, early recognition of revenue could involve moving inventory from the balance sheet to
cost of goods sold on the income statement, the booking of accounts receivable, and lack of cash
flow. An understanding of financial reporting and analysis would help in detecting the problem.
Enron and WorldCom substantially influenced financial reporting in the United States.
These cases crystallized views of the U.S. House and Senate that resulted in the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002. Hopefully, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will lead to constructive improve-
ment in financial reporting.
Enron was one of the largest corporations in the world. In October 2001 it announced
that it was reducing after-tax net income by approximately $500 million and shareholders’
equity by $1.2 billion. In November, it announced that it was restating reported net income
for the years 1997–2000. In December 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy.
The Enron situation involved many financial reporting issues that were poorly disclosed
or not disclosed at all. Some of the issues were accounting for investments in subsidiaries and
special-purpose entities, sales of investments to special-purpose entities, revenue for fees, and
fair value of investments.16 The Enron financial statements, including the notes, were compli-
cated and difficult to comprehend. The lesson here is that if a reasonable understanding of fi-
nancial reporting and analysis is not adequate to understand the financial report, then
consider this when investing.
In June 2002 WorldCom announced that it had inflated profits by $3.8 billion over the
previous five quarters. WorldCom was the largest corporate accounting fraud in history. Soon
after this announcement, WorldCom declared bankruptcy.17 In November 2002, a special
bankruptcy court examiner reported that the improper accounting would exceed $7.2 billion.18
The WorldCom fraud was uncovered by three accountants working in the internal
auditing department. Their findings were communicated to the audit committee of the
board, and later the entire board was informed. The internal discovery and reporting of the
fraud represents a positive aspect of the WorldCom fraud.19
The WorldCom problem apparently started in 2000 when business declined. Initially,
WorldCom moved dollars from reserve accounts to hold up profits. When this was no lon-
ger sufficient, it then turned to shifting operating costs to capital accounts. Shifting operating
costs (expenses on the income statement) to capital accounts (assets on the balance sheet)

would make the company look more profitable in the short run. As capital expenditures,
these costs would be depreciated in subsequent years. Apparently, WorldCom had planned a
write-down. This would remove these accounts from the balance sheet. Hopefully, Wall
Street would overlook the write-down when looking to the future.20
Although the WorldCom fraud was discovered by internal auditors, the Securities and
Exchange Commission sent a “Request for Information” to WorldCom on March 7, 2002.
The SEC apparently thought that the WorldCom profit figures were suspicious, considering
that WorldCom’s closest competitors, including AT&T Corp., were losing money through-
out 2001. A lesson from WorldCom is that if the numbers look too good, that may be
because they are too good.21
Following Enron and WorldCom, many cases have been brought against companies and indi-
viduals for improper management of earnings. As of 2005, the largest company subsequent to
Enron and WorldCom charged with improper management of earnings has been American Inter-
national Group, Inc. (AIG). AIG is the world’s biggest publicly traded seller of property-casualty
insurance to businesses and the largest life insurer in the United States in terms of premiums.22
The SEC, the Justice Department, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York City were
all investigating AIG’s accounting issues. New York’s attorney general and insurance com-
missioner sued AIG and two former top executives, accusing them of manipulating AIG’s fi-
nancial results.23 The New York prosecutor’s office presented evidence to a grand jury
weighing criminal charges against individuals during the summer of 2005.24
On May 31, 2005, AIG restated its financial results for a five-year period. “The account-
ing adjustments tallied in the document slashed AIG’s previously reported net income for
2004 by 12%, or $1.32 billion, to $9.73 billion, and reduced AIG’s book value by $2.26 bil-
lion to $80.61 billion. Overall, the restatement reduced AIG’s net income from 2000 through
2004 by $3.9 billion, or 10%.”25
A U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) study dated July 2006 disclosed that
“over the period of January 1, 2002 through September 30, 2005, the total number of restat-
ing companies (1,084) represents 16% of the average number of listed companies from 2002
to 2005, as compared to almost 8% during the 1997–2001 period.”26
This study concluded that “a variety of factors appear to have contributed to the increased
trend in restatements, including increased accountability requirements on the part of company
executives; increased auditor and regulatory scrutiny … and a general unwillingness on the
part of public companies to risk failing to restate regardless of the significance of the event.”27
In an August 2006 correspondence, the GAO made this comment related to its July
2006 study: “Although there are many reasons for restatements, most restatements involve
more routine reporting issues … and are not symptomatic of financial reporting fraud and/
or accounting errors.”28
It was noted in Chapter 4 that a FASB standard issued in May 2005 requires retrospec-
tive application to prior periods’ financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting
principle unless it is impracticable. This standard will contribute to additional retrospective
application to prior periods.
The SEC issued Staff Bulletin No. 108 in September 2006 that requires retroactive revision
of prior-period numbers presented in financial reporting. This relates to accounting for imma-
terial adjustments waived over time that become cumulatively material at a point in time. This
bulletin will also contribute to additional retrospective application to prior periods.
Restatements have become a substantial problem in analysis of financial statements. It is
important to review companies that are being analyzed for restatements during the period of
time that is being analyzed. A similar review should be made for companies with which the
company is being compared. It is impossible to guard against some unreliable industry data.
The Housing Bust
The housing bust led to a worldwide recession or possibly depression, depending on how it
finally plays out. A few comments are in order to explain its origins and implications.
The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Mortgage
Corporation (Freddie Mac) control a substantial portion of the mortgage market in the
United States. Fannie Mae was created in 1938 to raise levels of home ownership. It was in
effect a U.S. government organization.

In 1968, Fannie Mae was privatized, removing it from the national budget. It began
operating as a government-sponsored enterprise with the implied protection of the federal
government. As a government-sponsored enterprise, it does not pay taxes or report to the
SEC. It is subject to congressional oversight, which has proven to be ineffective. The federal
government created a second government-sponsored enterprise in 1970, the Freddie Mac.
Because of the implied protection of the federal government, the rating agencies (Standard &
Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch) gave their mortgage securities a AAA rating. With this rating, the secur-
ities were sold to banks, mutual funds, governments, and individuals throughout the world.
In 1977, Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act, which required banks to
meet the credit needs of the local communities. The objective of this Act was to reduce dis-
criminatory credit practices against low-income neighborhoods. Banks sold many of their
mortgages to either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac controlled trillions of dollars of mortgages either by holding
the mortgages or selling the mortgages. Many individuals warned of the dangers of Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac to the world economy because of their size, their securities given a AAA
rating, and the way they operated with loose government oversight that was often political.
Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac contributed substantial sums to politicians that took
many forms, including sponsored travel for congressional staff. They have paid millions in
fines for violating federal election laws. Individual executives at both Fannie Mae and Fred-
die Mac were paid millions annually.
Government auditors in 2003 and 2004 found that both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
manipulated accounting rules to look more profitable and help ensure that executives would
receive substantial bonuses.
By the time that the mortgage market blew up in 2007 and 2008, Fannie Mae and Fred-
die Mac had polluted the world with high-risk mortgages. As housing prices declined in the
United States, in some cities by over 50%, mortgages that were high quality became troubled
mortgages because the outstanding mortgage on many homes became substantially more
than the value of the home.
Financial institutions such as Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, American International
Group, Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan Chase, and Bear Stearns had taken substantial financial
risk (these are only example firms as the list would be very long). In some cases, financial institu-
tions had taken on obligations that were 30 or 40 times their equity. Hundreds of banks failed.
The collapse of the housing market and of many financial institutions led to a worldwide
stock market collapse. An analysis of a company that was done only a few weeks earlier was
of little use.
This points out the importance of keeping track of investments and being ready to revise
the analysis. Companies such as Nike, which had a very good analysis, did experience declines
in market value, but they did survive. Material problems on the mortgage market were still
present in 2012. Mortgage market problems will likely continue for many more years.
Valuation
Valuation is a process of estimating the value of a firm or some component of a firm. There
are many approaches to valuation. Those approaches can be summarized as fundamental
analysis and multiperiod discounted valuation approaches. In practice, a wide variety of val-
uation approaches are employed.
With fundamental analysis, the basic accounting measures are used to assess the firm’s
future operating cash flows or earnings. Fundamental analysis makes use of the financial state-
ments. This approach considers items such as reported earnings, cash flow, and book value.
The multiperiod discounted valuation approach projects either earnings or cash flow
and discounts these numbers to the present value (intrinsic value).
Multiples
Fundamental valuation typically uses one or more multiples. Multiples frequently used are
price-to-earnings (PE), price-to-book, price-to-operating cash flow, and price-to-sales. Per-
ceived risk will reduce a multiple, while perceived growth will increase a multiple. When
using a multiple approach, it is important to compare results with similar firms.

Multiples use conventional financial statements. For example, PE uses earnings, price-
to-book uses the book value, and price-to-operating cash flow uses operating cash flow,
while price-to-sales uses sales. Often, the analysis will use several multiples.
The use of multiples and conventional financial reports is not well accepted by the tradi-
tional financial literature or many valuation books. However, there is ample evidence prov-
ing that security analysts and fund managers prefer the use of multiples.
Multiperiod Discounted Valuation Models
The financial literature and valuation books strongly support use of the multiperiod discounted
valuation model in terms of either earnings or cash flow. Discounted cash flow is preferred.
Multiperiod Discounted Earnings Models
There are many multiperiod discounted earnings models. These models rely on accrual
accounting to produce results that are closer to the firm’s underlying economic performance
in the short run than are cash flows.
The two most popular discounted earnings models appear to be discounted abnormal
earnings (DAE) and residual income (RI).
Discounted Abnormal Earnings
With this approach, the value of the firm’s equity is the sum of its book value and discounted
forecasts of abnormal earnings.
Residual Income
This approach discounts future expected earnings. The focus is on earnings as a periodic
measure of shareholder wealth creation.
Multiperiod Discounted Cash Flow Models
There are many multiperiod discounted cash flow models. The three most popular seem to
be free cash flow (FCF), dividend discount model (DDM), and discounted cash flow (DCF).
Free Cash Flow
The free cash flow model states that the intrinsic value (discounted free cash flow) equals the
sum of the stream of expected free cash flows discounted to the present.
There are different definitions of free cash flow, but they are along these lines for com-
mon stock: operating cash flows minus interest, minus cash outlays for operating capacity
(buildings, equipment, etc.), minus repayments, minus preferred dividends.
Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
The dividend discount model discounts the projected dividend stream to present value. It
considers only the dividend stream to common shareholders.
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
The discounted cash flow model involves a multiple-year forecast of cash flows. The forecasts
are discounted at the firm’s estimated cost of capital to arrive at an estimated present value.
What They Use
“Three recent studies have dealt with the issue of what models are actually used by analysts:
Barker (1999), Demirakos et al. (2004), and Asquith et al. (2005). All these studies agree
that multiperiod discounted valuation models do not seem to play a significant role in ana-
lysts’ normal valuation activity. Simple price-earnings multiples seem to be the predominant
technique. Hence, any cost of equity capital discounted valuation model may not be an
adequate representation of the reality of valuation.”29
Let’s review the three studies sited: Barker, Demirakos et al., and Asquith et al.
Barker
The Barker study states that the value of a share is given by the dividend discount model,
but the actual determination of the share value is rarely based on the direct estimation of the
future dividends.30
Barker references prior studies of valuation models used by market participants, which
indicated that the strongest and most consistent finding in the behavioral literature is that

the price-to-earnings is of primary importance.31 A further finding was that discounted cash
flow models are of little practical importance to investment decisions.32
The Barker study itself dealt with analysts and fund managers in the United Kingdom.
The valuation models selected for study were price-earnings, dividend yield, price-cash flow
(PCF), net asset value (NAV), sales/market capitalization, discounted cash flow, and divi-
dend discount.33 Analysts and fund managers were asked to rate the importance of these val-
uation models. Both groups picked the PE method as the preferred method of valuation. The
PE, dividend yield, and price-cash flow were significantly more important than all other val-
uation models. (The discounted cash flow model and the dividend discount model were both
of little practical importance.)34
The analysts were asked to rank the importance of selected financial ratios: the profit and
loss account (ratios) were perceived to be of greater relevance than the balance sheet (ratios).35
For both the analysts and fund managers, “a consistent finding from these interviews
was that valuation models are perceived to be important in the context of one another, and
not just in isolation.”36 This also applied to financial ratios.
Source: Financial Restatements, July 2006, GAO-06-678, P4.
It was found that analysts anchor their process in accounting information combined
with other sources that are considered relevant to the reliably foreseeable future.37 This indi-
cates the importance of financial reports.
Analysts and fund managers consider almost all information received directly from com-
panies to be very important.38 They both “perceive their own assessment of company man-
agement to be at the heart of investment decision-making.”39 If management makes the
correct decisions, the firm will generate future cash flow streams.
Source: Financial Restatements, July 2006, GAO-06-678, P4.
Demirakos et al.
The Demirakos et al. study examined the valuation practices of financial analysts at interna-
tional investment banks. The firms consisted of 26 large U.K.-listed companies drawn from
the beverages, electronics, and pharmaceuticals sectors.
Descriptive analysis “shows that almost all the sampled reports contain some form of
valuation by reference to a multiple of earnings.40 The attention given to PE models varies
systematically across sectors in understandable ways.”41
Source: Demirakos et al. study
The main message to emerge from this content analysis of financial analysts’ reports is
that analysts appear to tailor their valuation methodologies to the circumstances of the
industry. PE models remain the mainstay of valuation practice, but other forms of
analysis complement those as circumstances demand. In some cases, discounted cash
flow (DCF) models are used and in others, more detailed analysis of price-to-sales
multiples, growth options, or profitability analysis are used. Another finding is that use
of the residual income valuation (RIV) model is extremely limited, but analysts
frequently use accounting data in single-period comparative and hybrid models.42
Source: Demirakos et al. study
Asquith et al.
The Asquith et al. study catalogued the complete contents of Institutional Investor All-
American analyst reports and examined the market reactions to their release. This study
found that analysts use market-to-book value as their asset multiple.43 No information
reported in this study indicated that discounted cash flow was used.
International Aspects
The Barker study dealt with analysts and fund managers in the United Kingdom. The Demi-
rakos study examined the valuation practices of financial analysts at international invest-
ment banks. Twenty-six large U.K. firms were examined. The Asquith study examined the
contents of Institutional Investor All-American analyst reports. Did the varied international
aspects of these studies influence the results?
Marco Trombetta in his paper “Discussion of Implied Cost of Equity Capital in
Earnings-Based Valuation: International Evidence” commented as follows:
The kind of training that financial analysts are likely to receive around the world is
probably fairly similar, especially if we focus on those countries with a significant

Valuation as Seen by Management Consultants
This section comments on a book, Valuation, Measuring, and Managing the Value of Compa-
nies, that now is in its fifth edition. Because the three authors (Tom Copeland, Tim Koller,
and Jack Murrin) are all current or former partners of McKinsey & Company, Inc., and co-
leaders of its corporate finance practice, it reflects practice as viewed by consultants. Individu-
als interested in valuation from a firm’s perspective would benefit from a review of this book.
From Page V
McKinsey & Company, Inc., is an international top management consulting firm. Founded
in 1926, McKinsey advises leading companies around the world.
This book is written from the perspective of creating value for the firm. The firm should
be managed to increase its value. Its “premise is that the value of a company derives from its
ability to generate cash flows and cash-flow-based returns on investment.”45
The authors’ position follows closely the theory of valuation. Discounted cash flows
provide a more reliable picture of a company’s value than an earnings-multiple approach.46
Discounted cash flows drive the value of a company.
The firm should focus on long-term rather than short-term cash flows. Short-term cash
flows are easy to manipulate, such as delaying research.47
Copeland et al. examine mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and observe that the market is
often unimpressed with the acquirers’ deals. Reviewing the results of academic studies of
transactions involving public companies in mergers and acquisitions showed that “sharehold-
ers of acquiring companies, on average, earned small returns that are not even statistically dif-
ferent from zero.”48 On the other hand, shareholders of acquired companies are often big
winners “receiving on average a 20% premium in a friendly merger and a 35% premium in a
hostile takeover.”49 Many acquisitions turn out badly because the purchaser paid too much.50
The authors observed that the acquirers overpaid for the following reasons:51
1. Overoptimistic appraisal of market potential
2. Overestimation of synergies
3. Poor due diligence
4. Overbidding
Dot.coms
The authors maintain that the correct way to value dot.coms is to use the classic discounted
cash flow approach to valuating, reinforcing the continued importance of basic economics
and finance.52
E-commerce firms have investments in customer acquisition, which is expensed in the income
statement. Thus, as more customers are acquired, the values balloon as the losses balloon.53
Amazon.com built a customer base and expanded its offerings. Amazon.com started
with private equity financing and sold convertible preferred in 1996, which was converted to
common in 1997.
Some data from the Amazon.com financial statements are given in Exhibit 11-13. Amazon.
com had a market capitalization in the billions by the end of 2000, yet it had never made a profit.
According to the Copeland et al. approach to discounted cash flow for “high-growth
companies like Amazon.com, don’t be constrained by current performance. Instead of start-
ing from the present—the usual practice in DCF valuations—start by thinking about what
the industry and the company could look like when they evolve from today’s very high-
growth, unstable condition to a substantial, moderate growth rate in the future, and then
extrapolate back to current performance.”54
Copeland et al. also recommend a customer value analysis when valuing very high-
growth companies. Five factors that drive the customer-value analysis of a retailer like Ama-
zon.com are as follows:55

1. The average revenue per customer per year from purchases by its customers as well as
revenues from advertisements on its site and from retailers that rent space on it to sell
their own products
2. The total number of customers
3. The contribution margin per customer (before the cost of acquiring customers)
4. The average cost of acquiring a customer
5. The customer churn rate (that is, the proportion of customers lost each year)
Any analysis should consider a company’s ability to survive long enough for the projec-
tions to take place. Amazon.com was able to raise substantial capital prior to the dot.com
crash in 2000. Apparently, Amazon.com raised more capital than needed in 1999 and 2000,
which allowed it to operate on plan without making major adjustments because of inad-
equate capital. Note the proceeds from long-term debt: 1997 ($75,000,000), 1998
($326,000,000), 1999 ($1,264,000,000), and 2000 ($681,000,000).
Summary
This chapter reviewed special areas related to financial state-
ments. It was noted that commercial loan departments give a
high significance rating to selected ratios that primarily meas-
ure liquidity or debt. The debt/equity ratio received the high-
est significance rating, and the current ratio was the second
highest rated by the commercial loan officers. A commercial
bank may elect to include a ratio as part of a loan agreement.
The two ratios most likely to be included in a loan agree-
ment are the debt/equity and the current ratio.
Financial executives give the profitability ratios the
highest significance ratings. They rate earnings per share
and return on investment the highest. Many firms have
selected key financial ratios, such as profitability ratios, to
be included as part of their corporate objectives.
Certified public accountants give the highest signifi-
cance rating to two liquidity ratios: the current ratio and
the accounts receivable turnover in days. The highest rated
profitability ratio was the after-tax net profit margin, while
the highest rated debt ratio was debt/equity.
A firm could use its annual report to relate financial
data effectively by the use of financial ratios. In general, no
major effort is being made to explain financial results by the
disclosure of financial ratios in annual reports. A review of
the methodology used to compute the ratios disclosed in
annual reports indicated that wide differences of opinion
exist on how many of the ratios should be computed.
A review of the financial statements, including the notes,
indicates the conservatism of the statements in terms of

accounting policies. When a firm has conservative accounting
policies, it is said that its earnings are of high quality.
There have been many academic studies on the use
of financial ratios to forecast financial failure. No conclu-
sive model has yet been developed to forecast financial
failure.
Auditors use financial analysis as part of their analytical
review procedures. By using financial analysis, they can
detect significant fluctuations and unusual items in operating
statistics. This can result in a more efficient and effective
audit.
Management can use financial analysis in many ways to
manage a firm more effectively. A particularly effective use of
financial analysis is to integrate ratios that have been accepted
as corporate objectives into comprehensive budgeting.
It has become popular to use graphs in annual reports
to present financial information. Graphs make it easier to
grasp key financial information. Graphs can communicate
better than a written report or a tabular presentation.
Many companies are restating their financial state-
ments. This represents a substantial problem when analyz-
ing financial statements.
The improper management of earnings has become a
very hot topic. Hopefully, this improper manipulation of
earnings is under control.
The collapse of the housing market and of many finan-
cial institutionsled to a worldwidestockmarketcollapse.Analy-
sis of a company that was done only a few years earlier was of
littleuse.
The objective with valuation is to determine a value for
the firm’s equity. In theory, the value of a company derives
from its ability to generate cash flows and cash-flow-based
returns on investment. Research indicates that multiperiod
discounted valuation models do not seem to play a significant
role in analysts’ or fund managers’ normal valuation activity.
A simple price-earnings multiple seems to be predominant.
The multiperiod discounted valuation models appear to play
a significant role for a management consulting firm reviewed.

3. Understate income and understate assets.
4. Overstate income and understate assets.
5. Overstate cash and overstate assets.
d. Early in a period in which sales were increasing at a modest rate and plant expansion
and start-up costs were occurring at a rapid rate, a successful business would likely
experience

In preparing his report, the controller has decided first to examine the financial ratios inde-
pendently of any other data to determine whether the ratios themselves reveal any significant
trends over the first three-year period.
Required
a. The current ratio is increasing, while the acid-test (quick) ratio is decreasing. Using the
ratios provided, identify and explain the contributing factor(s) for this apparently
divergent trend.
b. In terms of the ratios provided, what conclusion(s) can be drawn regarding the
company’s use of financial leverage during the 2009–2011 period?
c. Using the ratios provided, what conclusion(s) can be drawn regarding the company’s
net investment in plant and equipment?

P 11-9 Warford Corporation was formed five years ago through a public subscription of
common stock. Lucinda Street, who owns 15% of the common stock, was one of the organ-
izers of Warford and is its current president. The company has been successful but currently
is experiencing a shortage of funds. On June 10, Street approached Bell National Bank, ask-
ing for a 24-month extension on two $30,000 notes, which are due on June 30, 2011 and
September 30, 2011. Another note of $7,000 is due on December 31, 2011, but Street
expects no difficulty in paying this note on its due date. Street explained that Warford’s cash
flow problems are due primarily to the company’s desire to finance a $300,000 plant expan-
sion over the next two fiscal years through internally generated funds.
The commercial loan officer of Bell National Bank requested financial reports for the
last two fiscal years. These reports follow:

P 11-12 Calcor Company has been a wholesale distributor of automobile parts for domestic
automakers for 20 years. Calcor has suffered through the recent slump in the domestic auto
industry, and its performance has not rebounded to the levels of the industry as a whole.
Calcor’s single-step income statement for the year ended November 30, 2011, follows:
CALCOR COMPANY

Calcor’s return on sales before interest and taxes was 5% in fiscal 2011 compared with the
industry average of 9%. Calcor’s turnover of average assets of four times per year and return on
average assets before interest and taxes of 20% are both well below the industry average.
Joe Kuhn, president of Calcor, wishes to improve these ratios and raise them nearer to the
industry averages. He established the following goals for Calcor Company for fiscal 2012:
Return on sales before interest and taxes
8%
Turnover of average assets
5 times per year
Return on average assets before interest and taxes
30%
For fiscal 2012, Kuhn and the rest of Calcor’s management team are considering the following
actions, which they expect will improve profitability and result in a 5% increase in unit sales:
1. Increase selling prices 10%.
2. Increase advertising by $420,000 and hold all other selling and administrative expenses
at fiscal 2011 levels.
3. Improve customer service by increasing average current assets (inventory and accounts
receivable) by a total of $300,000, and hold all other assets at fiscal 2011 levels.
4. Finance the additional assets at an annual interest rate of 10% and hold all other
interest expense at fiscal 2011 levels.

5. Improve the quality of products carried; this will increase the units of goods sold by 4%.
6. Calcor’s 2012 effective income tax rate is expected to be 40%—the same as in fiscal
2011.
Required
a. Prepare a single-step pro forma income statement for Calcor Company for the year
ended November 30, 2012, assuming that Calcor’s planned actions would be carried
out and that the 5% increase in unit sales would be realized.
b. Calculate the following ratios for Calcor Company for the 2011–2012 fiscal year and
state whether Kuhn’s goal would be achieved:
1. Return on sales before interest and taxes.
2. Turnover of average assets.
3. Return on average assets before interest and taxes.
c. Would it be possible for Calcor Company to achieve the first two of Kuhn’s goals
without achieving his third goal of a 30% return on average assets before interest and
taxes? Explain your answer.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IN PART)
Note 1 Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (In Part)
Stock Split
On October 12, 2010, RAI’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of RAI’s
common stock, which was issued on November 15, 2001, to shareholders of record on No-
vember 1, 2010. Shareholders on the record date received one additional share of RAI com-
mon stock for each share owned. All current and prior period share and per share amounts
have been adjusted to reflect this stock split.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of tobacco inventories is deter-
mined principally under the last-in, first-out, or LIFO, method and is calculated at the end of
each year. The cost of work in process and finished goods includes materials, direct labor,
variable costs and overhead, and full absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead. Stocks of
tobacco, which have an operating cycle that exceeds 12 months due to aging requirements,
are classified as current assets, consistent with recognized industry practice.
Note 9—Inventories
The major components of inventories at December 31 were as follows:
2010
2009

$1,055
$1,219
Inventories valued under the LIFO method were $600 million and $473 million at De-
cember 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, net of the LIFO allowance. The LIFO allowance
reflects the excess of the current cost of LIFO inventories at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
over the amount at which these inventories were carried on the consolidated balance sheets.
RAI recorded expense of $7 million, $78 million and income of $61 million from LIFO in-
ventory changes during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Effective tax rate

The effective tax rate for 2010 was unfavorably impacted by a $27 million increase in
tax attributable to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the Health
Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The effective tax rates for 2008 and 2009
were unfavorably impacted by increases in unrecognized income tax benefits and increases
in tax attributable to accumulated and undistributed foreign earnings.
As of December 31, 2010, there were $438 million of accumulated and undistributed
foreign earnings. Of this amount, RAI has invested $77 million and has plans to invest $10
million overseas. RAI has recorded deferred income taxes of $125 million on the $351 mil-
lion of accumulated earnings in excess of its historical and planned overseas investments.
Note to the case:
The FABER REPORT, May 25, 2011 reported that JP Morgan did an analysis of 519 com-
panies and found a collective $1.375 trillion in undistributed foreign earnings.
United States companies are taxed at a rate of up to 35% when they repatriate off share
earnings.
Required
a. Determine the change in net income for 2010 in comparison with the reported net
income if FIFO had been used for all inventory.
b. Compute the following for 2010 with no adjustments for LIFO reserve:
1. Days’ sales in inventory
2. Working capital
3. Current ratio
4. Acid-test ratio
5. Debt ratio
c. Compute the measures in (b) considering the LIFO reserve (eliminate the LIFO reserve):
1. Days’ sales in inventory
2. Working capital
3. Current ratio
4. Acid-test ratio
5. Debt ratio
d. Comment on the different results of the ratios computed in (b) and (c).
e. For the 2009 financial statements, what was the diluted income per share for 2009 and 2008?
f. How much deferred taxes have been recognized by Reynolds American Inc. for
undistributed foreign earnings. Is this conservative?

Accounting Hocus-Pocus
Our accounting principles weren’t meant to be a straitjacket. Accountants are wise enough
to know they cannot anticipate every business structure or every new and innovative trans-
action, so they develop principles that allow for flexibility to adapt to changing circumstan-
ces. That’s why the highest standards of objectivity, integrity and judgment can’t be the
exception. They must be the rule.
Flexibility in accounting allows it to keep pace with business innovations. Abuses such
as earnings management occur when people exploit this pliancy. Trickery is employed to
obscure actual financial volatility. This, in turn, masks the true consequences of manage-
ment’s decisions. These practices aren’t limited to smaller companies struggling to gain inves-
tor interest. It’s also happening in companies whose products we know and admire.
So what are these illusions? Five of the more popular ones I want to discuss today are “big
bath” restructuring charges, creative acquisition accounting, “cookie jar reserves,” “immaterial”
misapplications of accounting principles and the premature recognition of revenue.
“Big-Bath” Charges
Let me first deal with “Big Bath” restructuring charges.
Companies remain competitive by regularly assessing the efficiency and profitability of
their operations. Problems arise, however, when we see large charges associated with compa-
nies restructuring. These charges help companies “clean up” their balance sheet—giving
them a so-called “big bath.”
Why are companies tempted to overstate these charges? When earnings take a major hit,
the theory goes Wall Street will look beyond a one-time loss and focus only on future earnings.
And if these charges are conservatively estimated with a little extra cushioning, that so-
called conservative estimate is miraculously reborn as income when estimates change or
future earnings fall short.
When a company decides to restructure, management and employees, investors and cred-
itors, customers and suppliers all want to understand the expected effects. We need, of course,
to ensure that financial reporting provides this information. But this should not lead to flush-
ing all the associated costs—and maybe a little extra—through the financial statements.
Creative Acquisition Accounting
Let me turn now to the second gimmick.
In recent years, whole industries have been remade through consolidations, acquisitions
and spin-offs. Some acquirers, particularly those using stock as an acquisition currency, have
used this environment as an opportunity to engage in another form of “creative accounting.”
I call it “merger magic.”
I am not talking tonight about the pooling versus purchase problem. Some companies
have no choice but to use purchase accounting—which can result in lower future earnings.
But that’s a result some companies are unwilling to tolerate.
So what do they do? They classify an ever-growing portion of the acquisition price as
“in-process” Research and Development, so—you guessed it—the amount can be written off
in a “one-time” charge—removing any future earnings drag. Equally troubling is the crea-
tion of large liabilities for future operating expenses to protect future earnings—all under the
mask of an acquisition.
Miscellaneous “Cookie Jar Reserves”
A third illusion played by some companies is using unrealistic assumptions to estimate liabilities
for such items as sales returns, loan losses or warranty costs. In doing so, they stash accruals in
cookie jars during the good times and reach into them when needed in the bad times.
I’m reminded of one U.S. company who took a large one-time loss to earnings to reim-
burse franchisees for equipment. That equipment, however, which included literally the
kitchen sink, had yet to be bought. And, at the same time, they announced that future earn-
ings would grow an impressive 15% per year.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

“Materiality”
Let me turn now to the fourth gimmick—the abuse of materiality—a word that captures the
attention of both attorneys and accountants. Materiality is another way we build flexibility
into financial reporting. Using the logic of diminishing returns, some items may be so insig-
nificant that they are not worth measuring and reporting with exact precision.
But some companies misuse the concept of materiality. They intentionally record errors
within a defined percentage ceiling. They then try to excuse that fib by arguing that the effect
on the bottom line is too small to matter. If that’s the case, why do they work so hard to cre-
ate these errors? Maybe because the effect can matter, especially if it picks up that last penny
of the consensus estimate. When either management or the outside auditors are questioned
about these clear violations of GAAP, they answer sheepishly.…“It doesn’t matter. It’s
immaterial.”
In markets where missing an earnings projection by a penny can result in a loss of mil-
lions of dollars in market capitalization, I have a hard time accepting that some of these so-
called non-events simply don’t matter.
Revenue Recognition
Lastly, companies try to boost earnings by manipulating the recognition of revenue. Think
about a bottle of fine wine. You wouldn’t pop the cork on that bottle before it was ready.
But some companies are doing this with their revenue—recognizing it before a sale is com-
plete, before the product is delivered to a customer, or at a time when the customer still has
options to terminate, void or delay the sale.
Required
a. “Big Bath”—Comment on how a “Big Bath” would have enabled WorldCom to cover
up its fraud.
b. Why would writing off “in-process” Research and Development be similar to a “Big
Bath”?
c. How could a company use “allowance for doubtful accounts” as “Cookie Jar
Reserves”?
d. Speculate on how a company could use “Materiality” or disregard or partially disregard
a specific accounting standard.
CASE 11-3 TURN A CHEEK
June 1996, The New York Times columnist Bob Herbert wrote a pair of opinion editorials
accusing Nike Corp. of cruelly exploiting cheap Asian labor. Nike CEO Philip Knight replied
in a letter to the editor, which the The New York Times published. Some of the information
in the Knight letter included that Nike has, on average, paid double the minimum wage as
defined in countries where its products are produced under contract.56
In 1998, Marc Kasky, a resident of California, sued Nike, alleging that the Knight letter
violated California’s consumer protection laws against deceptive advertising and unfair busi-
ness practices.57 In effect, the position was that The New York Times editorials were under
the First Amendment, but that the Nike reply was under the Fifth Amendment. The First
Amendment covers freedom of speech, while the Fifth Amendment covers commercial
speech.
The California Supreme Court ruled in May 2002 that the Nike reply had to be viewed
under the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme Court stated it was “commercial speech because
it is both more readily verifiable by its speaker and more hardy than noncommercial speech,
can be effectively regulated to suppress false and actually or inherently misleading messages
without undue risk of chilling public debate.”58
Nike appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court agreed to
hear the case. In June 2003, the Supreme Court changed its mind and dismissed the matter
on procedural grounds.59 Usually, the justices consider cases only after the state courts
render a final decision; here, the state court had only said the speech was a commercial

speech and sent the case back down for further proceedings—likely including a trial on
whether the statements were indeed misleading.60
A trial did not take place, as Nike settled on September 2003, agreeing to pay $1.5 mil-
lion over a three-year period to the Fair Labor Association, a Washington worker-rights
group.61
Required
a. Write a position paper on why the Nike reply should be viewed under the First
Amendment.
b. Write a position paper on why the Nike reply should be viewed under the Fifth
Amendment.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Borders Group, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Borders Group, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009 and the related consolidated state-
ments of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended January 30, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsi-
bility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these fi-
nancial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and per-
form the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence support-
ing the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Borders Group, Inc. and subsidiaries at Janu-
ary 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009 and the consolidated results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2010, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2007 the Company
adopted the required provisions of the guidance originally issued in Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (codi-
fied in FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes).
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Borders Group, Inc.’s internal control over fi-
nancial reporting as of January 30, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread-
way Commission and our report dated April 1, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Required
a. Perform a horizontal common-size analysis of the consolidated statements of operations
using sales through gross margin for 2008, 2009, and 2010. Use the fiscal year ended
February 2, 2008 as the base. Comment.
b. Perform a vertical common-size analysis of the consolidated statements of operations using
sales through gross margin for 2008, 2009, and 2010. Use sales as the base. Comment.
c. For the years ended January 31, 2009 and January 30, 2010, compute the following
ratios. Comment.
1. Cash flow/total debt
2. Net income/total assets (return on assets)
3. Total debt/total assets (debt ratio)
Note: These are the ratios that the Beaver study indicated were the best for
forecasting failure (in the order of their predictive power).
d. For the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008,
January 31, 2009 and January 30, 2010, comment on the significance of the decrease in

the debt position (refer back to Exhibit 3, Summary Analysis).
2. Review the debt ratio for 2009–2011. Comment.
c. Profitability
1. Review the summary analysis for Nike, Inc. from 2009–2011. Give your opinion of
the profitability (refer back to Exhibit 3, Summary Analysis).
2. Review the trend in revenues (2007–2011). Comment.
3. Review the trend in gross profit margin (2007–2011). Comment.
d. Investor Analysis

Chapter
12
Special Industries: Banks,
Utilities, Oil and Gas,
Transportation, Insurance,
and Real Estate Companies
T
he preceding chapters covered material most applicable to manufacturing, retailing,
wholesaling, and service industries. This chapter covers six specialized industries:
banks, utilities, oil and gas, transportation, insurance, and real estate companies. The
chapter notes the differences in statements and suggests changes or additions to analysis.
Banks
Banks operate under either a federal or a state charter. National banks are required to sub-
mit uniform accounting statements to the Comptroller of the Currency. State banks are con-
trolled by their state banking departments. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System receive financial and
operating statements from all members of the Federal Reserve System. Member banks are
required to keep reserves with their district Federal Reserve bank. State banking laws also
dictate the geographical area within which a bank may function. The range runs from within
one county to interstate.
Banking systems usually involve two types of structures: individual banks and bank
holding companies. Bank holding companies consist of a parent that owns one or many
banks. In addition, the holding company may own bank-related financial services and non-
financial subsidiaries. In financial report analysis, we must determine the extent of the busi-
ness generated by banking services. In order for the specific industry ratios to be meaningful,
a large proportion of the services should be bank related.
Exhibit 12-1 presents part of the 2010 annual report of the BancFirst Corporation.
Balance Sheet
The balance sheet of a commercial bank is sometimes termed the report of condition. Two
significant differences exist between the traditional balance sheet and that of a bank. First,
the accounts of banks may seem the opposite of those of other types of firms. Checking
accounts or demand deposits are liabilities to a bank, since it owes the customers money in

these cases. Similarly, loans to customers are assets—receivables. Furthermore, the balance
sheet accounts are not subdivided into current and noncurrent accounts.
Some banks provide a very detailed disclosure of their assets and liabilities. Other banks
provide only general disclosure. The quality of review that can be performed can be no bet-
ter than the disclosure.
Representative assets of a bank may include cash on hand or due from other banks,
investment securities, loans, bank premises, and equipment. Closely review the disclosure of
a bank’s assets. This review may indicate risk or opportunity. For example, a review of the
assets may indicate that the bank has a substantial risk if interest rates increase. The general
rule is that for 20-year fixed obligations, a gain or loss of 8% of principal arises when inter-
est rates change by 1%. Thus, an investment of $100 million in 20-year bonds would lose
approximately $32 million in principal if interest rates increased by 4%. A similar example
would be a bank that holds long-term fixed-rate mortgages. The value of these mortgages
could decline substantially if interest rates increased. Many bank annual reports do not dis-
close the amount of fixed-rate mortgages.
Review the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet to determine whether signifi-
cant accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) exists. BancFirst Corporation had accu-
mulated comprehensive income of $8,505,000 at December 31, 2010, and an accumulated

comprehensive income of $11,023,000 at December 31, 2009. The decline came from an unre-
alized loss on securities.
Subprime residential real estate loans became a major issue with financial institutions.
There is no standard definition of subprime residential real estate loans. For these loans there
is a perceived risk spread to other residential real estate loans.
BancFirst apparently did not specifically comment on residential real estate loans but
did make the following comment as to their loans:
Composition
The Company’s loan portfolio was diversified among various types of commercial and
individual borrowers. Commercial loans were comprised principally of loans to companies
in light manufacturing, retail and service industries. Consumer loans were comprised
primarily of loans to individuals for automobiles. Student loans have decreased to $56.3
million at December 31, 2010 down from $148.2 million at December 31, 2009 and
$131.2 million at December 31, 2008. On March 21, 2010, Congress passed student loan
reform legislation centralizing student lending in a governmental agency, which as of June
30, 2010 resulted in an end to the student loan programs provided by the Company. The
Company sold all student loans held for sale of $144.5 million in October 2010. The
Company did not have any credit card receivables at year end 2010, 2009 or 2008.
Loans secured by real estate including farmland, multifamily, commercial, one to four
family housing and construction and development loans, have been a large portion of
the Company’s loan portfolio. The Company is subject to risk of future market
fluctuations in property values relating to these loans. The Company attempts to
manage this risk through rigorous loan underwriting standards.

In recent years, less developed country (LDC) loans have become a national issue. In general
LDC loans are perceived as being more risky than domestic loans. BancFirst Corporation
apparently did not have international loans at the end of either 2010 or 2009.
As part of the review of assets, review the disclosure that describes related-party loans.
Observe the maturity and the trend of these loans.
BancFirst included the following as to related-party loans (from Note 5):
Related Party Loans
The Company has made loans in the ordinary course of business to the executive officers
and directors of the Company and to certain affiliates of these executive officers and
directors. Management believes that all such loans were made on substantially the same
terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons
and do not represent more than a normal risk of collectability or present other
unfavorable features. A summary of these loans is as follows:

Potential problem loans are performing loans to borrowers with a weakened financial
condition, or which are experiencing unfavorable trends in their financial condition,
which causes management to have concerns as to the ability of such borrowers to
comply with the existing repayment terms. BancFirst had approximately $60.3 million,
$73.6 million and $66.8 million of these loans at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,

respectively, which were not included in nonperforming and restructured assets. In general,
these loans are adequately collateralized and have no specific identifiable probable
loss. Loans which are considered to have identifiable probable loss potential are placed
on nonaccrual status, are allocated a specific allowance for loss or are directly charged-
down, and are reported as nonperforming. The Company’s nonaccrual loans are
primarily commercial and real estate loans.

$7,250,000, while long-term borrowings increased from $0 to $34,265,000.
As part of the review of liabilities, look for a note that describes commitments and con-
tingent liabilities. This note may reveal significant commitments and contingent liabilities.
BancFirst included the following note:

(19) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (In Part)
The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal
course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments
include loan commitments and standby letters of credit which involve elements of credit
and interest-rate risk to varying degrees. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event
of nonperformance by the other party to the instrument is represented by the instrument’s
contractual account. To control this credit risk, the Company uses the same underwriting
standards as it uses for loans recorded on the balance sheet. The amounts of financial
instruments with off-balance-sheet risk are as follows:
December 31,
2010
2009
(dollars in thousands)
Loan commitments
$625,970
$638,652
Stand-by letters of credit
55,339
61,718
Loan commitments are agreements to lend to a customer, as long as there is no
violation of any condition established in the contract. Stand-by letters of credit are
conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a
customer to a third party. These instruments generally have fixed expiration dates or
other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the
instruments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amounts do
not necessarily represent commitments that will be funded in the future.
Shareholders’ Equity
The shareholders’ equity of a bank resembles that of other types of firms, except that the
total shareholders’ equity is usually very low in relation to total assets. A general guide for
many years was that a bank’s shareholders’ equity should be approximately 10% of total
assets, but very few banks in recent years have had that much shareholders’ equity. Cur-
rently, shareholders’ equity of 6% to 7% would probably be considered favorable. Banc-
First had approximately 9.1% shareholders’ equity at the end of 2010. In general, the lower
the proportion of shareholders’ equity in relation to total assets, the greater the risk of fail-
ure. A higher shareholders’ equity in relation to total assets would probably improve safety,
but the bank would perhaps be less profitable because of the additional capital requirement.

As part of the analysis of shareholders’ equity, review the statement of shareholders’ eq-
uity and the related notes for any significant changes. BancFirst had a substantial decrease in
total shareholders’ equity in relation to total assets, but a substantial increase in absolute
amount. Retained earnings also had a substantial increase in absolute amount.
The current approach by bank regulators is to view not only the adequacy of sharehold-
ers’ equity in relation to total assets, but also to view it in relation to risk-adjusted assets.
BancFirst disclosed the following as part of Note 15 Shareholders’ Equity:
The Company and BancFirst are subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and FDIC. These guidelines are used to evaluate
capital adequacy and involve both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the
Company’s and BancFirst’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated
under regulatory practices. Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can initiate
certain mandatory or discretionary actions by the regulatory agencies that could have a
direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Management believes, as of
December 31, 2010, that the Company and BancFirst met all capital adequacy
requirements to which they are subject. The required capital amounts and the Company’s
and BancFirst’s respective ratios are shown in the following table:” (table not presented)
“As of December 31, 2010, the most recent notification from the Federal Reserve Bank of
Kansas City and the FDIC categorized BancFirst as “well capitalized” under the regulatory
framework for prompt corrective action. To be well capitalized under federal bank
regulatory agency definitions, a depository institution must have a Tier 1 Ratio of at least
6%, a combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 Ratio of at least 10%, and a Leverage Ratio of at least 5%.
There are no conditions or events since the most recent notification of BancFirst’s capital
category that management believes would change its category.
Income Statement
A bank’s principal revenue source is usually interest income from loans and investment
securities. The difference between interest income and interest expense is termed net interest
income or net interest margin.
The net interest margin is important to a bank’s profitability. Usually, falling interest
rates are positive for a bank’s interest margin because the bank will be able to reduce the in-
terest rate that it pays for deposits before the average rate of return earned on loans and
investments declines. Increasing interest rates are usually negative for a bank’s interest mar-
gin because the bank will need to increase the interest rate on deposits, which is usually done
before rates on loans and investments are adjusted.
Bank income statements include a separate section for other income (noninterest
income). Typical other income includes trust department fees, service charges on deposit
accounts, trading account profits (losses), and securities transactions.
The importance of other income has substantially increased for banks. For example,
service charges have increased in importance in recent years since many banks have set serv-
ice charges at a level to make the service profitable. This has frequently been the result of
improved cost analysis. In addition, banks have been adding nontraditional sources of
income, such as mortgage banking, sales of mutual funds, sales of annuities, and computer
services for other banks and financial institutions.
BancFirst had net interest income after provision for loan losses of $139,822,000 and
$120,932,000, respectively, for 2010 and 2009.
The noninterest income increased from $66,864,000 in 2009 to $69,919,000 in 2010.
The noninterest expense increased from $139,117,000 to $144,095,000.
Ratios for Banks
Because of the vastly different accounts and statement formats, few of the traditional ratios
are appropriate for banks. Exceptions include return on assets, return on equity, and most of
the investment-related ratios. The following sections present meaningful ratios for bank
analysis, but this is not a comprehensive treatment. The investment firm of Keefe, Bruyette
& Woods, Inc., in its Bankbook Report on Performance, lists 21 financial ratios. This is an
excellent source of industry averages for banks.

Earning Assets to Total Assets
Earning assets includes loans, leases, investment securities, and money market assets. It
excludes cash and nonearning deposits plus fixed assets. This ratio shows how well bank
management puts bank assets to work. High-performance banks have a high ratio.
Banks typically present data on an average annual basis. This is used to compute a num-
ber of ratios. In this book the year-end amounts are used. Exhibit 12-2 presents BancFirst’s
earning assets to total assets ratio, which increased between 2009 and 2010.
Interest Margin to Average Earning Assets
This is a key determinant of bank profitability, for it provides an indication of management’s
ability to control the spread between interest income and interest expense. Exhibit 12-3
presents this ratio for BancFirst.
Loan Loss Coverage Ratio
The loan loss coverage ratio, computed by dividing pretax income plus provision for loan
losses by net charge-offs, helps determine the asset quality and the level of protection of
loans. Exhibit 12-4 presents this ratio for BancFirst. This ratio increased materially in 2010,
which is a positive indicator.

Equity Capital to Total Assets
This ratio, also called funds to total assets, measures the extent of equity ownership in the
bank. This ownership provides the cushion against the risk of using debt and leverage. Exhibit
12-5 presents this ratio, computed by using year-end figures, for BancFirst. This ratio decreased
in 2010 to 9.38% from 10.20% in 2009. Both of these ratios appear to be very good.
Deposits Times Capital
The ratio of deposits times capital concerns both depositors and stockholders. To some
extent, it is a type of debt/equity ratio, indicating a bank’s debt position. More capital
implies a greater margin of safety, while a larger deposit base gives a prospect of higher
return to stockholders, since more money is available for investment purposes. Exhibit 12-6
presents this ratio for BancFirst, based on year-end figures. Deposits times capital increased
in 2010 to 9.48 from 8.65 in 2009.
Loans to Deposits
Average total loans to average deposits is a type of asset to liability ratio. Loans make up a
large portion of the bank’s assets, and its principal obligations are the deposits that can be with-
drawn on request—within time limitations. This is a type of debt coverage ratio, and it meas-
ures the bank’s position with regard to taking risks. Exhibit 12-7 shows this ratio for BancFirst.
Loans to deposits decreased in 2010, indicating a decrease in risk from a debt standpoint.

Regulated Utilities
Regulated utilities render a unique service on which the public depends. Regulated utilities
are basically monopolies subject to government regulation, including rate regulation. In
recent years, laws have been enacted that greatly reduce the monopoly aspect.
Uniformity of accounting is prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
for interstate electric and gas companies and by the Federal Communications Commission
for telephone and telegraph companies, as well as by state regulatory agencies.
This section includes comments on regulated utilities. In recent years, most utilities have
added nonregulated businesses. In many cases, the nonregulated businesses have become
more than the regulated businesses. These utilities usually do not present financial reports
like a regulated utility, especially the form of the balance sheet. These balance sheets may
appear like a normal balance sheet. The ratios introduced in this section may not be feasible
to be computed for utilities with substantial nonregulated businesses.
Financial Statements
Balance sheets for utilities differ from business balance sheets mainly in the order that
accounts for utilities are presented. Plant and equipment are the first assets listed, followed
by investments and other assets, current assets, and deferred charges. Note that Wisconsin
Energy Corporation combines deferred charges and other assets. Under liabilities and equity,
the first section is capitalization. The capitalization section usually includes all sources of
long-term capital, such as common stock, preferred stock, and long-term debt. The capitali-
zation section is followed by current liabilities, and then deferred credits and other.
The income statement for utilities is set up by operating revenues, less operating
expenses to arrive at net operating income. Net operating income is adjusted by other
income (deductions) to arrive at income before interest charges. Interest charges are then
deducted to arrive at income before income taxes.

tion. Review Exhibit 12-8 to become familiar with the form of utility financial statements.

A. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Property and Depreciation: We record property, plant and equipment at cost. Cost includes material, labor, overheads and
capitalized interest. Utility property also includes AFUDC – Equity, Additions to and significant replacements of property are
charged to property, plant and equipment at cost; minor items are charged to maintenance expense. The cost of depreciable
utility property less salvage value is charged to accumulated depreciation when property is retired.
We recorded the following property in service by segment as of December 31:

Our utility depreciation rates are certified by the PSCW and MPSC and include estimates for salvage value and removal
costs. Depreciation as a percent of average depreciable utility plant was 2.8% in 2010 and 3.7% in 2009 and 2008.
PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 are being depreciated over an estimated useful life of 37 years. OC 1 is being depreciated over an esti-
mated useful life of 45 years.
For assets other than our regulated assets, we accrue depreciation expense at straight-line rates over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives for non-regulated assets are 3 to 40 years for furniture and equipment, 2 to 5 years for
software and 30 to 40 years for buildings.

Our regulated utilities collect in their rates amounts representing future removal costs for many assets that do not have an
associated Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO). We record a regulatory liability on our balance sheet for the estimated amounts
we have collected in rates for future removal costs less amounts we have spent in removal activities. This regulatory liability
was $723.9 million as of December 31, 2010 and $718.7 million as of December 31, 2009.

Allowance For Funds Used During Construction −Regulated: AFUDC is included in utility plant accounts and represents the
cost of borrowed funds (AFUDC −Debt) used during plant construction, and a return on stockholders’ capital (AFUDC −Eq-
uity) used for construction purposes. AFUDC −Debt is recorded as a reduction of interest expense, and AFUDC −Equity is
recorded in Other Income and Deductions, net.
During 2009 and 2008, Wisconsin Electric accrued AFUDC at a rate of 9.09% as authorized by the PSCW. Consistent with
the PSCW’s 2008 rate order, Wisconsin Electric accrued AFUDC on 50% of all utility CWIP projects except the Oak Creek
AQCS project which accrued AFUDC on 100% of CWIP. Wisconsin Electric’s rates are set to provide a current return on
CWIP that does not accrue AFUDC. Based on the 2010 PSCW rate order, effective January 1, 2010 Wisconsin Electric is re-
cording AFUDC on 100% of CWIP associated with the Oak Creek AQCS project, the Edgewater Unit 5 Selective Catalytic
Reduction project, and the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric will record AFUDC on 50% of all other electric, gas,
and steam utility CWIP. The AFUDC rate starting January 1, 2010 is 8.83%.
During 2009 and 2008, Wisconsin Gas accrued AFUDC at a rate of 10.80% on 50% of its CWIP as authorized by the
PSCW in its 2008 rate order. Wisconsin Gas’ rates are set to provide a current return on CWIP that does not accrue AFUDC.
Based on the 2010 PSCW rate order, effective January 1, 2010 Wisconsin Gas is recording AFUDC on 50% of all CWIP using
an AFUDC rate of 9.05%.

Capitalized Interest and Carrying Costs −Non-Regulated Energy: As part of the construction of the electric generating units
under our PTF program, we capitalized interest during construction. As allowed under the lease agreements, we were able to
collect the carrying costs during the construction of the PTF generating units from our utility customers. We have deferred
these carrying costs collected on our balance sheet while the PTF units were under construction and we are amortizing the
deferred carrying costs to revenue after the assets were placed in service over the individual lease terms. For further information
on the accounting for capitalized interest and deferred carrying costs associated with the construction of our PTF power plants,
see Note E.
. . . . .
E – ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR POWER THE FUTURE GENERATING UNITS
Background: As part of our PTF strategy, our non-utility subsidiary, We Power, has built four new generating units, PWGS 1,
PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2, which are leased to our utility subsidiary, Wisconsin Electric, under long-term leases that have been
approved by the PSCW. The leases are designed to recover the capital costs of the plant, including a return. PWGS 1, PWGS 2,
OC 1 and OC 2 were placed in service in July 2005, May 2008, February 2010 and January 2011, respectively. The accompa-
nying consolidated financial statements eliminate all intercompany transactions between We Power and Wisconsin Electric and
reflect the cash inflows from Wisconsin Electric customers and the cash outflows to our vendors and suppliers.
The Oak Creek expansion includes common projects that benefit the existing units at this site as well as the new units.
These projects include a coal handling facility and a water intake system, which were placed in service in November 2007 and
January 2009, respectively.
During Construction: Under the terms of each lease, we collect in current rates amounts representing our pre-tax cost of
capital (debt and equity) associated with capital expenditures for our PTF units. Our pre-tax cost of capital is approximately
14%. The carrying costs that we collected in rates were recorded as deferred revenue and started being amortized to revenue

Inventories are not a problem for electric utilities. Traditionally, receivables have not
been a problem because the services are essential and could be cut off for nonpayment and
because often a prepayment is required of the customer. In recent years, receivables have
been a problem for some utilities because some utility commissions have ruled that services
could not be cut off during the winter.
Wisconsin Energy Corporation had $379,100,000 in materials, supplies, and inventories
on December 31, 2010. It is partly a regulated and a nonregulated energy company.
A few accounts on the financial statements of a utility are particularly important to the
understanding of the statements. On the balance sheet, many utilities have a construction work-
in-progress (CWIP) account. Exhibit 12-8 discloses that Wisconsin Energy had construction
work in progress of $1,569,900,000 and $2,185,100,000 in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Utilities that have substantial construction work in progress are usually viewed as being
more risky investments than utilities that do not. Most utility commissions allow no con-
struction work in progress or only a small amount in the rate base. Therefore, the utility
rates essentially do not reflect the construction work in progress.
The utility intends to have the additional property and plant considered in the rate base
when the construction work is completed. However, the utility commission may not allow
all of this property and plant in the rate base. If the commission rules that inefficiency caused
part of the cost, it may disallow the cost. The commission may also disallow part of the cost
on the grounds that the utility used bad judgment and provided for excess capacity. Costs
disallowed are in effect charged to the stockholders, as future income will not include a
return on disallowed cost. In the long run, everybody pays for inefficiency and excess
capacity because disallowed costs are a risk that can drive the stock price down and interest
rates up for the utility. This increases the cost of capital for the utility, which in turn may
force utility rates up.
For the costs allowed, the risk exists that the utility commission will not allow a rea-
sonable rate of return. It is important to observe what proportion of total property and
plant is represented by construction work in progress. Also, be familiar with the political
climate of the utility commission that will be ruling on the construction work in progress
costs.
The income statement accounts—allowance for equity funds and allowance for bor-
rowed funds used during construction—relate to construction work-in-progress costs on the
balance sheet. Both of these accounts, sometimes jointly referred to as the allowance for
funds used during construction, have been added to construction work-in-progress costs.
Wisconsin Energy Corporation did not disclose these accounts separately on the income
statement. It did describe them in a note.
The account allowance for equity funds used during construction represents an assumed
rate of return on equity funds used for construction. The account allowance for borrowed
funds used during construction represents the cost of borrowed funds that are used for
construction.
over the term of each lease once the respective unit was placed into service. During the construction of our PTF units, we capi-
talized interest costs at an overall weighted-average pre-tax cost of interest, which was approximately 5% for the years ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009. Capitalized interest is included in the total cost of the PTF units.
Plant in Service: Now that the PTF units are placed in service, we expect to continue to recover in rates the lease costs
which reflect the authorized cash construction costs of the units plus a return on the investment. The authorized cash costs are
established by the PSCW. The authorized cash costs exclude capitalized interest since carrying costs were recovered during the
construction of the units. The lease payments are expected to be levelized, except that OC 1 and OC 2 will be recovered on a
levelized basis that has a one time 10.6% escalation after the first five years of the leases. The leases established a set return on
equity component of 12.7% after tax. The interest component of the return under each lease has been determined at rates in
effect at the time of commercial operation.
We recognize revenues (consisting of the lease payments included in rates and the amortization of the deferred revenue) on
a levelized basis over the term of the lease. We depreciate the PTF assets on a straight-line basis over their expected service life.

By increasing the balance sheet account, Construction Work in Progress, for an assumed
rate of return on equity funds, the utility builds into the cost base an amount for an assumed
rate of return on equity funds. As explained previously, the utility commission may not accept
this cost base. The costs that have been added into the cost base have also been added to
income, through the allowance for equity funds. Sometimes the account allowance for equity
funds used during construction represents a significant portion of the utility’s net income.
The income statement account, Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used during Construc-
tion, charges to the balance sheet account, Construction in Progress, the interest on bor-
rowed funds used for construction in progress. Thus, this interest is added to the cost base.
Utilities with substantial construction work in progress can have significant cash flow
problems. Their reported net income can be substantially higher than the cash flow related
to the income statement. Sometimes these utilities issue additional bonds and stocks to
obtain funds to pay interest and dividends.
Wisconsin Energy also had capitalized interest related to nonregulated energy. This
would be part of its construction work in progress.
Ratios for Regulated Utilities
Because of the vastly different accounts and statement formats, few of the traditional ratios
are appropriate for regulated utilities. Exceptions are the return on assets, return on equity,
debt/equity, and times interest earned. Investor-related ratios are also of value in analyzing
utilities. For example, the cash flow per share ratio can be a particularly important indicator
of the utility’s ability to maintain and increase dividends. Standard & Poor’s Industry Survey
is a good source for composite industry data on utilities.
The ratios reviewed here would often apply to the regulated and nonregulated as long as
the nonregulated is associated with the utility business.
Operating Ratio
The operating ratio measures efficiency by comparing operating expenses to operating reve-
nues. A profitable utility holds this ratio low. A vertical common-size analysis of the income
statement will aid in conclusions regarding this ratio. Exhibit 12-9 presents the operating ra-
tio for Wisconsin Energy. This ratio decreased moderately in 2010, thus having a positive
influence on profitability.
Funded Debt to Operating Property
A key ratio, the comparison of funded debt to net fixed operating property, is sometimes
termed LTD (long-term debt) to net property because funded debt is long-term debt. Operat-
ing property consists of property and plant less the allowance for depreciation and any
allowance for nuclear fuel amortization. Construction in progress is included since it has
probably been substantially funded by debt. This ratio measures debt coverage and indicates
how funds are supplied. It resembles debt to total assets, with only specialized debt and the
specific assets that generate the profits to cover the debt charges. Exhibit 12-10 presents
funded debt to operating property for Wisconsin Energy. This ratio decreased slightly in
2010, indicating a less risky debt position.

Percent Earned on Operating Property
This ratio, sometimes termed earnings on net property, relates net earnings to the assets pri-
marily intended to generate earnings—net property and plant. Exhibit 12-11 presents this
ratio for Wisconsin Energy. Note that this ratio increased substantially in 2010, which is
a favorable trend.
Operating Revenue to Operating Property
This ratio is basically an operating asset turnover ratio. In public utilities, the fixed plant
is often much larger than the expected annual revenue, and this ratio will be less than 1.
Exhibit 12-12 presents this ratio for Wisconsin Energy, which indicates a material decrease
in the operating revenue to operating property and represents an unfavorable trend.

Oil and Gas
Oil and gas companies’ financial statements are affected significantly by the method they
choose to account for costs associated with exploration and production. The method chosen
is some variation of the successful-efforts or full-costing methods, which will be explained
along with their effects on the financial statements. The financial statements of oil and gas
companies are also unique because they are required to disclose, in a note, supplementary in-
formation on oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities. This require-
ment will be explained in this section.
Cash flow is important to all companies, but particularly to oil and gas companies.
Therefore, cash flow must be part of the analysis of an oil or a gas company. In addition,
most of the traditional financial ratios apply to oil and gas companies. This section will not
cover special ratios that relate to oil and gas companies.
The 2010 financial statements of ConocoPhillips will be used to illustrate oil and gas
financial statements. ConocoPhillips is an integrated international energy company.
Successful-Efforts versus Full-Costing Methods
A gas company uses a variation of two costing methods to account for exploration and pro-
duction costs: the successful-efforts method and the full-costing method.
The successful-efforts method places only exploration and production costs of successful
wells on the balance sheet under property, plant, and equipment. Exploration and production
costs of unsuccessful (or dry) wells are expensed when it is determined that there is a dry hole.
With the full-costing method, exploration and production costs of all the wells (successful and
unsuccessful) are placed on the balance sheet under property, plant, and equipment.
Under both methods, exploration and production costs placed on the balance sheet are
subsequently amortized as expense to the income statement. Amortization costs that relate
to natural resources are called depletion expense.
The costing method used for exploration and production can have a very significant
influence on the balance sheet and the income statement. Under both methods, exploration
and production costs are eventually expensed, but a significant difference exists in the timing
of the expense.
In theory, the successful-efforts method takes the position that a direct relationship exists
between costs incurred and specific reserves discovered. These costs should be placed on the
balance sheet. Costs associated with unsuccessful efforts are a period expense and should be
charged to expense. In theory, the full-costing method takes the position that the drilling of
all wells, successful and unsuccessful, is part of the process of finding successful wells. There-
fore, all of the cost should be placed on the balance sheet.
In practice, the decision to use the successful-efforts method or the full-costing method is
probably not significantly influenced by theory but by practicalities. Most relatively small oil
and gas companies select a variation of the full-costing method. This results in a much larger bal-
ance sheet. In the short run, it also usually results in higher reported profits. Small oil companies
speculate that the larger balance sheet and the increased reported profits can be used to influence
some banks and limited partners, which the small companies tend to use as sources of funds.
Large oil and gas companies tend to select a variation of the successful-efforts method.
This results in a lower balance sheet amount and lower reported income in the short run.
The large companies usually depend on bonds and stock as their primary sources of outside
capital. Investors in bonds and stock are not likely to be influenced by the larger balance
sheet and higher income that result from capitalizing dry wells.
The method used can have a significant influence on the balance sheet and the income
statement. The successful-efforts method is more conservative. Review Exhibit 12-13 for a
description of ConocoPhillips’ method of accounting for exploration and production costs.

2010 Annual Report
ConocoPhillips presented supplemental data (unaudited) using 27 pages in 2010 its annual report. Exhibit 12-14 represents
only a small part of the disclosure.
Oil and Gas Operations (Unaudited) (In Part)
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, “Extractive
Activities—Oil and Gas,” and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are making certain sup-
plemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations.
These disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and gas activities and our proportionate share of our
equity affiliates’ oil and gas activities, covering both those in our Exploration and Production (E’P) segment, as well as in our
LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result, amounts reported as Equity Affiliates in Oil and Gas Operations may differ from
those shown in the individual segment disclosures reported elsewhere in this report.
Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts (PSCs), which are reported under
the “economic interest” method and are subject to fluctuations in prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;
recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will
change inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve quantities would
decline. At December 31, 2010, approximately 12 percent of our total proved reserves were under PSCs, primarily in our Asia
Pacific/Middle East geographic reporting area.
Our disclosures by geographic area include the United States, Canada, Europe (primarily Norway and the United King-
dom), Russia, Asia Pacific/Middle East, Africa, and Other Areas. Other Areas primarily consists of the Caspian Region.

Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements (In Part)
Oil and Gas Exploration and Development – Oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the suc-
cessful efforts method of accounting.
Property Acquisition Costs – Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet cap-
tion properties, plants and equipment. Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and manage-
ment’s judgment. Upon achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the associated leasehold
costs are reclassified to proved properties.
Exploratory Costs – Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are
expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet pending further evaluation
of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found. If economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory
well costs are expensed as dry holes. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well
costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operat-
ing viability of the project is being made. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells
remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on
the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmen-
tal permitting. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development
phase, and the oil and gas resources are designated as proved reserves.
Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal dril-
ling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges the potential field does not warrant
further investment in the near term. See Note 8—Suspended Wells, for additional information on suspended wells.
Development Costs – Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are
capitalized.
Depletion and Amortization – Leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method
based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Amortization of intangible development costs is based on the unit-of-
production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Cash Flow
Monitoring cash flow can be particularly important when following an oil or a gas com-
pany. The potential for a significant difference exists between the reported income and cash
flow from operations. One reason is that large sums can be spent for exploration and devel-
opment, years in advance of revenue from the found reserves. The other reason is that there
can be significant differences between when expenses are deducted on the financial state-
ments and when they are deducted on the tax return. Therefore, observe the operating cash
flow.
Cash from operating activities for a three-year period will be disclosed on the statement
of cash flows. For ConocoPhillips, net cash provided by operating activities was
$17,045,000,000, $12,479,000,000, and $22,658,000,000 for 2010, 2009, and 2008,
respectively. Net income (loss) attributable to ConocoPhillips was $11,358,000,000,
$4,414,000,000, and ($16,349,000,000) for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
Transportation
Three components of the transportation industry will be discussed: air carriers, railroads,
and the motor carrier industry. The Civil Aeronautics Board, which requires the use of a uni-
form system of accounts and reporting, regulates interstate commercial aviation. The Inter-
state Commerce Commission, which also has control over a uniform system of accounts and
reporting, regulates interstate railroads. The Interstate Commerce Commission also regulates
interstate motor carriers whose principal business is transportation services.
Financial Statements
The balance sheet format for air carriers, railroads, and motor carriers resembles that for
manufacturing or retailing firms. As in a heavy manufacturing firm, property and equipment
make up a large portion of assets. Also, supplies and parts comprise the basic inventory
items. The income statement format resembles that of a utility. The system of accounts pro-
vides for the grouping of all revenues and expenses in terms of both major natural objectives
and functional activities. There is no cost of goods sold calculation; rather, there is operating
income: revenue (categorized) minus operating expenses. In essence, the statements are a pre-
scribed, categorized form of single-step income statement. They cannot be converted to
multiple-step format.
Ratios
Most of the traditional ratios also apply in the transportation field. Exceptions are inventory
turnovers (because there is no cost of goods sold) and gross profit margin. The ratios dis-
cussed in the subsections that follow are especially suited to transportation. They are derived
from the 2010 statement of income and balance sheet for Southwest Airlines Co., presented
in Exhibit 12-15.

The traditional sources of industry averages cover transportation. The federal govern-
ment accumulates numerous statistics for regulated industries, including transportation. An
example is the Interstate Commerce Commission’s Annual Report on transport statistics in
the United States.
For the motor carrier industry, a particularly good source of industry data is the annual
publication Financial Analysis of the Motor Carrier Industry, published by the American
Trucking Association, Inc. This publication includes an economic and industry overview,
distribution of revenue by carrier type, and industry issues. It also includes definitions of ter-
minology that relate to the motor carrier industry.
There are hundreds of motor carrier firms, most of which are relatively small. The
American Trucking Association compiles data by composite carrier groups. For example,
Group A includes composite data for several hundred general freight carriers with annual
revenues of less than $5 million. One of the groups includes composite data for the publicly
held carriers of general freight.
The very extensive composite data in the American Trucking Association publication
include industry total dollars for the income statement and balance sheet. It also includes
vertical common-size analyses for the income statement and the balance sheet. This publica-
tion also includes approximately 36 ratios and other analytical data, such as total tons.

Operating Ratio
The operating ratio is computed by comparing operating expenses with operating revenues. It
measures cost and should be kept low, but external conditions, such as the level of business ac-
tivity, may affect this ratio. Operating revenues vary from year to year because of differences
in rates, classification of traffic, volume of traffic carried, and the distance traffic is trans-
ported. Operating expenses change because of variations in the price level, traffic carried, type
of service performed, and effectiveness of operating and maintaining the properties. Common-
size analysis of revenues and expenses is needed to explain changes in the operating ratio.
Exhibit 12-16 presents the operating ratio for Southwest Airlines Co. The operating ra-
tio for Southwest Airlines decreased from 97.47% in 2009 to 91.84 in 2010. The operating
ratio can dramatically affect the profitability of a carrier. This trend in the operating ratio is
favorable for Southwest Airlines.
Long-Term Debt to Operating Property
Because of the transportation companies’ heavy investment in operating assets, such as equip-
ment, the long-term ratios increase in importance. Long-term borrowing capacity is also a key
consideration. The ratio of long-term debt to operating property ratio gives a measure of the
sources of funds with which property is obtained. It also measures borrowing capacity. Oper-
ating property is defined as long-term property and equipment. Exhibit 12-17 presents this ra-
tio for Southwest Airlines. For Southwest Airlines, the long-term debt to operating property
ratio decreased materially in 2010 to 27.18% from 31.27%. This represents a positive trend.
Operating Revenue to Operating Property
This ratio measures turnover of operating assets. The objective is to generate as many dollars in
revenue per dollar of property as possible. Exhibit 12-18 presents this ratio for Southwest Air-
lines. The operating revenue to operating property increased materially between 2009 and 2010.
Per-Mile, Per-Person, and Per-Ton Passenger Load Factors
For transportation companies, additional insight can be gained by looking at revenues and
expenses on a per unit of usage basis. Examples would be per mile of line or per 10 miles for

Insurance
Insurance companies provide two types of services. One is an identified contract service—
mortality protection or loss protection. The second is investment management service.
There are basically four types of insurance organizations:
1. STOCK COMPANIES. A stock company is a corporation organized to earn profits for its
stockholders. The comments in this insurance section relate specifically to stock companies.
Many of the comments are also valid for the other types of insurance organizations.

2. MUTUAL COMPANIES. A mutual company is an incorporated entity, without private
ownership interest, operating for the benefit of its policyholders and their beneficiaries.
3. FRATERNAL BENEFIT SOCIETIES. A fraternal benefit society resembles a mutual
insurance company in that, although incorporated, it does not have capital stock, and it
operates for the benefit of its members and beneficiaries. Policyholders participate in the
earnings of the society, and the policies stipulate that the society has the power to assess
them in case the legal reserves become impaired.
4. ASSESSMENT COMPANIES. An assessment company is an organized group with
similar interests, such as a religious denomination.
The regulation of insurance companies started at the state level. Beginning in 1828, the
State of New York required that annual reports be filed with the state controller. Subse-
quently, other states followed this precedent, and all 50 states have insurance departments
that require annual statements of insurance companies. The reports are filed with the state
insurance departments in accordance with statutory accounting practices (SAP). The
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), a voluntary association, has suc-
ceeded in achieving near uniformity among the states, so there are no significant differences
in SAP among the states.1
Statutory accounting emphasizes the balance sheet. In its concern for protecting policy-
holders, statutory accounting focuses on the financial solvency of the insurance corporation.
After the annual reports are filed with the individual state insurance departments, a testing
process is conducted by the NAIC. This process is based on ratio calculations concerning the
financial position of a company. If a company’s ratio is outside the prescribed limit, the
NAIC brings that to the attention of the state insurance department.
A.M. Best Company publishes Best’s Insurance Reports, which are issued separately for
life-health companies and property-casualty companies. Best’s Insurance Reports evaluate
the financial condition of more than 3,000 insurance companies. The majority of companies
are assigned a Best’s Rating, ranging from A+ (Superior) to C– (Fair). The other companies
are classified as “Not Assigned.” The “Not Assigned” category has 10 classifications to
identify why a company has not been assigned a Best’s Rating.
Some of the items included in Best’s data include a balance sheet, summary of opera-
tions, operating ratios, profitability ratios, leverage ratios, and liquidity ratios. Most of the
ratios are industry-specific. It is not practical to describe and explain them in this book. It
should be noted that the financial data, including the ratios, are based on the data submitted
to the state insurance departments and are thus based on SAP. GAAP for insurance compa-
nies developed much later than SAP. The annual reports of insurance companies are based
on GAAP.
The 1934 Securities and Exchange Act established national government regulation, in
addition to the state regulation of insurance companies. Stock insurance companies with
assets of $1 million and at least 500 stockholders must register with the SEC and file the
required forms, such as the annual Form 10-K. Reports filed with the SEC must conform
with GAAP.
Exhibit 12-20 contains the income statement and balance sheet from the 2010 annual
report of the Chubb Corporation. These statements were prepared using GAAP. Review
them to observe the unique nature of insurance company financial statements.
Balance Sheet Under GAAP
The balance sheet for an insurance company is not classified by current assets and current
liabilities (nonclassified balance sheet). Instead, its basic sections are assets, liabilities, and
shareholders’ equity.
Assets
The assets section starts with investments, a classification in which most insurance compa-
nies maintain the majority of their assets. Many of the investments have a high degree of li-
quidity, so that prompt payment can be assured in the event of a catastrophic loss. The
majority of the investments are typically in bonds, with stock investments being much lower.

Real estate investments are usually present for both property-casualty insurance companies
and life insurance companies. Because liabilities are relatively short term for property-
casualty companies, the investment in real estate for these companies is usually immaterial.
For life insurance companies, the investment in real estate may be much greater than for
property-casualty companies because of the generally longer-term nature and predictability
of their liabilities.
For debt and equity investments, review the disclosure to determine whether there are
significant differences between the fair value and the cost or amortized cost. Also review the
stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet to determine whether there is significant
unrealized appreciation of investments (gains or losses).
Assets—Other Than Investments
A number of asset accounts other than investments may be on an insurance company’s bal-
ance sheet. Some of the typical accounts are described in the paragraphs that follow.
Real estate used in operations is reported at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Under
SAP, real estate used in operations is expensed.
Deferred policy acquisition costs represent the cost of obtaining policies. Under GAAP,
these costs are deferred and charged to expense over the premium-paying period. This is one
of the major differences between GAAP reporting and SAP reporting. Under SAP reporting,
these costs are charged to expense as they are incurred.
Goodwill is an intangible account resulting from acquiring other companies. The same
account can be found on the balance sheet of companies other than insurance companies.
Under GAAP, the goodwill account is accounted for as an asset. Under SAP, neither the
goodwill account nor other intangibles are recognized.
Liabilities
Generally, the largest liability is for loss reserves. Reserving for losses involves estimating the
ultimate value, considering the present value of the commitments. The quantification process
is subject to a number of subjective estimates, including inflation, interest rates, and judicial
interpretations. Mortality estimates are also important for life insurance companies. These
reserve accounts should be adequate to pay policy claims under the terms of the insurance
policies.
Another liability account found on an insurance company’s balance sheet is policy and
contract claims. This account represents claims that have accrued as of the balance sheet
date. These claims are reported net of any portion that can be recovered.
Many other liability accounts, such as notes payable and income taxes payable, are
found on an insurance company’s balance sheet. These are typically reported in the same
manner as other industries report them, except there is no current liability classification.
Shareholders’ Equity
The shareholders’ equity usually resembles the shareholders’ equity section for companies in
other industries. The account Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss) can be par-
ticularly large for insurance companies. For the Chubb Corporation, the details of the
account Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income are in the Consolidated Statements of
Shareholders’ Equity. For the Chubb Corporation, the account Accumulated Other Compre-
hensive Income (loss) contains unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments, foreign
currency translations gains (losses), and postretirement benefit costs not yet recognized in
net income.
Income Statement Under GAAP
The manner of recognizing revenue on insurance contracts is unique for the insurance indus-
try. In general, the duration of the contract governs the revenue recognition.
For contracts of short duration, revenue is ordinarily recognized over the period of the
contract in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided. When the risk differs
significantly from the contract period, revenue is recognized over the period of risk in pro-
portion to the amount of insurance protection.2

Policies relating to loss protection typically fall under the short-duration contract. An
example would be casualty insurance in which the insurance company retains the right to
cancel the contract at the end of the policy term.
For long-duration contracts, revenue is recognized when the premium is due from the
policyholder. Examples would be whole-life contracts and single-premium life contracts.3
Likewise, acquisition costs are capitalized and expensed in proportion to premium revenue.
Long-duration contracts that do not subject the insurance enterprise to significant risks
arising from policyholder mortality or morbidity are referred to as investment contracts.
Amounts received on these contracts are not to be reported as revenues but rather as liabil-
ities and accounted for in the same way as interest-bearing instruments.4 The contracts are
regarded as investment contracts since they do not incorporate significant insurance risk.
Interestingly, many of the life insurance policies currently being written are of this type.
With the investment contracts, premium payments are credited to the policyholder bal-
ance. The insurance company assesses charges against this balance for contract services and
credits the balance for income earned. The insurer can adjust the schedule for contract serv-
ices and the rate at which income is credited.
Investment contracts generally include an assessment against the policyholder on incep-
tion of the contract and an assessment when the contract is terminated. The inception fees
are booked as recoveries of capitalized acquisition costs, and the termination fees are booked
as revenue at the time of termination.
In addition to their insurance activities, insurance companies are substantially involved
with investments. Realized gains and losses from investments are reported in operations in
the period incurred.
Ratios
As previously indicated, many of the ratios relating to insurance companies are industry-
specific. An explanation of industry-specific ratios is beyond the scope of this book. The
industry-specific ratios are frequently based on SAP financial reporting to the states, rather
than the GAAP financial reporting that is used for the annual report and SEC requirements.
Ratios computed from the GAAP-based financial statements are often profitability- and
investor-related. Examples of such ratios are return on common equity, price/earnings ratio,
dividend payout, and dividend yield. These ratios are explained in other sections of this book.
Insurance companies tend to have a stock market price at a discount to the average mar-
ket price (price/earnings ratio). This discount is typically 10% to 20%, but at times it is
much more. There are likely many reasons for this relatively low market value. Insurance is
a highly regulated industry that some perceive as having low-growth prospects. It is also an
industry with substantial competition. The regulation and the competition put pressure on
the premiums that can be charged. The accounting environment likely also contributes to the
relatively low market price for insurance company stocks. The existence of two sets of
accounting principles, SAP and GAAP, contributes to the lack of understanding of insurance
companies’ financial statements. Also, many of the accounting standards are complex and
industry-specific.
The nature of the insurance industry leads to standards that allow much subjectivity and
possible manipulation of reported profit. For example, insurance companies are perceived to
underreserve during tough years and overreserve during good years.
Insurance company financial fraud led to the April 2005 announcement from the Secur-
ities and Exchange Commission that it was increasing its enforcement of accounting rules.
“The Securities and Exchange Commission, using its power as an enforcer of accounting
rules, is asserting for the first time in decades a key role for federal officials overseeing the in-
surance industry.”5
“The federal government’s ability to regulate the insurance industry is still limited by
law. The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 gave primacy in regulating and taxing insurers
for states.… Because of the law, even the SEC can only go so far with its accounting cudgel.
Its mandate extends only to companies with publicly offered securities, while some of the
largest U.S. insurers—including the biggest, State Farm—are either owned by policyholders
or closely held.”6

Real Estate Companies
Real estate companies typically construct and operate income-producing real properties.
Examples of such properties are shopping centers, hotels, and office buildings. A typical pro-
ject would involve selecting a site, arranging financing, arranging for long-term leases, con-
struction, and subsequently operating and maintaining the property.
Real estate companies contend that conventional accounting—recognizing depreciation
but not the underlying value of the property—misleads investors. In some cases, these com-
panies have taken the drastic step of selling major parts or all of the companies’ assets to re-
alize greater benefits for stockholders. Some real estate companies have attempted to reflect
value by disclosing current value in addition to the conventional accounting.
Summary
Financial statements vary among industries, and they are especially different for banks, utilities, transportation companies, and
insurance companies. In each case, the accounting for these firms is subject to a uniform accounting system. Changes in analy-
sis are necessitated by the differences in accounting presentation.
Oil and gas companies’ financial statements are affected significantly by the method that they choose to account for costs
associated with exploration and production. Another important aspect of the financial statements of oil and gas companies is
the note requirement that relates to supplementary information on oil and gas exploration, development, and production
activities. Cash flow is also particularly significant to oil and gas companies.
Real estate companies emphasize the underlying value of the property and earnings before depreciation and deferred
taxes from operations.
Special industry ratios were reviewed in this chapter. The following ratios are helpful when analyzing a bank:
Earning Assets to Total Assets ¼ Average Earning Assets
Average Total Assets
Interest Margin to Average Earning Assets ¼

Loan Loss Coverage Ratio ¼ Pretax Income þ Provision for Loan Losses
Net Charge-Offs
Equity Capital to Total Assets ¼
Average Equity

Deposits Times Capital ¼
Average Deposits
Average Shareholders' Equity
Loans to Deposits ¼ Average Total Loans

The following ratios are helpful in analyzing utility performance:
Operating Ratio ¼ Operating Expense
Operating Revenue
Funded Debt to Operating Property ¼
Funded Debt

The ratios that follow are especially suited to transportation. Additional insight can be gained by looking at revenues and
expenses on a per unit of usage basis.

AFUDC
AFUDC is a method used to compensate the Utility for the estimated cost of debt (interest)
and equity funds used to finance regulated plant additions and is capitalized as part of the
cost of construction projects. AFUDC is recoverable from customers through rates over the
life of the related property once the property is placed in service. The portion of AFUDC
related to the cost of debt is recorded as a reduction to interest expense. AFUDC related to
the cost of equity is recorded in other income. The Utility recorded AFUDC of $110 million
and $50 million during 2010, $95 million and $44 million during 2009, $70 million and
$44 million during 2008, related to equity and debt, respectively.
Required
a. Describe AFUDC as used by PG&E.
b. How does capitalizing interest on borrowed funds affect income in the year of
capitalization versus not capitalizing this interest? Explain.
c. Would net income tend to be higher than cash flow if there is substantial capitalization
of interest on the borrowed funds during the current period?

CASE 12-2 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES
Hess Corporation* included information in this case as part of the supplementary oil and
gas data. This case only represents a small portion of the supplementary oil and gas data.
Results of Operations for Oil and Gas Producing Activities
The results of operations shown below exclude non-oil and gas producing activities, primar-
ily gains on sales of oil and gas properties, interest expense, gains and losses resulting from
foreign exchange transactions and other non-operating income. Therefore, these results are
on a different basis than the net income from Exploration and Production operations
reported in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and in Note 18, Segment Information, in the notes to the financial statements.

Chapter
13
Personal Financial
Statements and Accounting
for Governments and Not-
for-Profit Organizations
T
his chapter briefly covers three types of financial reporting that have not been dis-
cussed in previous chapters: (1) personal financial statements, (2) governments, and
(3) not-for-profit organizations other than governments.
Personal Financial Statements
Personal financial statements of individuals, husband and wife, or a larger family group are
prepared for obtaining credit, income tax planning, retirement planning, and estate plan-
ning. Statement of Position 82-1 (SOP 82-1) covers guidelines for the preparation of per-
sonal financial statements.1 According to SOP 82-1:
The primary users of personal financial statements normally consider estimated current
value information to be more relevant for their decisions than historical cost informa-
tion. Lenders require estimated current value information to assess collateral, and most
personal loan applications require estimated current value information. Estimated cur-
rent values are required for estate, gift, and income tax planning, and estimated current
value information about assets is often required in federal and state filings of candi-
dates for public office.2
Source: Financial Accounting Standards Board
SOP 82-1 concludes that personal financial statements should present assets at their
estimated current values and liabilities at their estimated current amounts at the date of the
financial statements. This contrasts with commercial financial statements, which predomi-
nantly use historical cost information. SOP 82-1 provides guidelines for determining the esti-
mated current value of an asset and the estimated current amount of a liability.3
Form of the Statements
The basic and most important statement prepared for personal financial statements, a state-
ment of financial condition, resembles a balance sheet. It states assets at estimated current

values and liabilities at estimated current amounts. A tax liability is estimated on the differ-
ence between the stated amounts of the assets and liabilities and the tax basis of these assets
and liabilities. For example, land may cost $10,000, which would be the tax basis, but may
have an estimated current value of $25,000. The estimated tax liability on the difference
between the $10,000 and the $25,000 would be estimated.
The difference between the total assets and total liabilities, designated net worth, is
equivalent to the equity section in a commercial balance sheet. The statement of financial
condition is prepared on the accrual basis. Assets and liabilities are presented in order of li-
quidity and maturity, without classification as current and noncurrent.
The optional statement of changes in net worth presents the major changes (sources of
increases and decreases) in net worth. This statement combines income and other changes
because of the mix of business and personal items. Examples of changes in net worth would
be income, increases in the estimated current value of assets, and decreases in estimated
income taxes. The statement of changes in net worth presents changes in terms of realized
increases (decreases) and unrealized increases (decreases). Examples of realized increases
(decreases) are salary, dividends, income taxes, and personal expenditures. Examples of
unrealized increases (decreases) are an increase in the value of securities, an increase in the
value of a residence, a decrease in the value of a boat, and estimated income taxes on the dif-
ferences between the estimated current values of assets and the estimated current amounts of
liabilities and their tax bases. Comparative financial statements may be more informative
than statements of only one period.
For personal financial statements, the statement of changes in net worth replaces the
income statement. SOP 82-1 includes guidelines on disclosure. These guidelines are not all-
inclusive. Examples of disclosure include the methods used in determining current values of
major assets, descriptions of intangible assets, and assumptions used to compute the esti-
mated income taxes.
Most individuals do not maintain a complete set of records, so the necessary data must
be gathered from various sources. These sources include brokers’ statements, income tax
returns, safe deposit boxes, insurance policies, real estate tax returns, checkbooks, and bank
statements.
Suggestions for Reviewing the Statement of Financial Condition
1. Usually the most important figure, the net worth amount indicates the level of wealth.
2. Determine the amount of the assets that you consider to be very liquid (cash, savings
accounts, marketable securities, and so on). These assets are readily available.
3. Observe the due date of the liabilities. In general, analysts would prefer the liabilities to be
relatively long term. Long-term liabilities do not represent an immediate pressing problem.
4. When possible, compare specific assets with their related liabilities. This will indicate the
net investment in the asset. For example, a residence with a current value of $90,000
and a $40,000 mortgage represents a net investment of $50,000.
Suggestions for Reviewing the Statement of Changes in Net Worth
1. Review realized increases in net worth. Determine the principal sources of realized net
worth.
2. Review realized decreases in net worth. Determine the principal items in realized
decreases in net worth.
3. Observe whether the net realized amount increased or decreased and by how much.
4. Review unrealized increases in net worth. Determine the principal sources of the increases.
5. Review unrealized decreases in net worth. Determine the principal sources of the
decreases.
6. Observe whether the net unrealized amount increased or decreased and the amount.
7. Observe whether the net change increased or decreased and the amount.
8. Observe the net worth at the end of the year. (This indicates the level of wealth.)

Accounting for Governments
The accounting terminology utilized by governments differs greatly from that used by profit-
oriented enterprises. Governments use such terms as appropriations and general fund. Defi-
nitions of some of the terms that will be encountered follow:
• Appropriations: Provision for necessary resources and the authority for their
disbursement.
• Debt service: Cash receipts and disbursements related to the payment of interest and
principal on long-term debt.
• Capital projects: Cash receipts and disbursements related to the acquisition of long-lived
assets.
• Special assessments: Cash receipts and disbursements related to improvements or services
for which special property assessments have been levied.
• Enterprises: Operations that are similar to private businesses in which service users are
charged fees.
• Internal services: Service centers that supply goods or services to other governmental
units on a cost reimbursement basis.
• General fund: All cash receipts and disbursements not required to be accounted for in
another fund.
• Proprietary funds: Funds whose purpose is to maintain the assets through cost reimburse-
ment by users or partial cost recovery from users and periodic infusion of additional
assets.
• Fiduciary funds (nonexpendable funds): Funds whose principal must remain intact (reve-
nues earned may be distributed).
• Encumbrances: Future commitments for expenditures.
Thousands of state and local governments in the United States account for a large seg-
ment of the gross national product. State and local governments have a major impact on the
citizens. No organization had a clear responsibility for providing accounting principles for
state and local governments. The AICPA, the National Council on Governmental Account-
ing, and the Municipal Finance Officers Association provided significant leadership in estab-
lishing accounting principles for state and local governments.
During the early 1980s, many thought that governmental accounting could benefit from
the establishment of a board similar to the FASB. A group of government accountants and
CPAs organized a committee known as the Governmental Accounting Standards Board
Organizing Committee. The Committee recommended the establishment of a separate
standard-setting body for governmental accounting.
In April 1984, the Financial Accounting Foundation amended its articles of incorpora-
tion to accommodate a Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). Thus, the GASB
became a branch of the Financial Accounting Foundation. The GASB has a seven-member
board. A simple majority of four votes is needed to issue a pronouncement.

Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 1, Appendix B, addresses the
jurisdictional hierarchy of the GASB and the FASB. It establishes the following priorities for
governmental units4:
1. Pronouncements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.
2. Pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
3. Pronouncements of bodies composed of expert accountants that follow a due process
procedure, including broad distribution of proposed accounting principles for public
comment, for the intended purpose of establishing accounting principles or describing
existing practices that are generally accepted.
4. Practices or pronouncements that are widely recognized as being generally accepted
because they represent prevalent practice in a particular industry or the knowledgeable
application to specific circumstances of pronouncements that are generally accepted.
5. Other accounting literature.
Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 1 also adopts the National
Council on Governmental Accounting pronouncements and the American Institute of Certi-
fied Public Accountants audit guide, entitled Audits of State and Local Governmental Units,
as the basis for currently existing GAAP for state and local governmental units.
In 1984, the GASB codified all existing governmental accounting and financial reporting
standards, interpretations, and technical bulletins in a joint effort with the Government Finance
Officers Association (GFOA). This book, Codification of Governmental Accounting and Finan-
cial Reporting Standards, is periodically updated to accommodate subsequent changes.
State and local governments serve as stewards over public funds. This stewardship
responsibility dominates state and local government accounting.
Stateandlocalgovernmentaccountingrevolvesaroundfundaccounting.Afundisdefinedasan:
Independent fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts recording
cash and/or other resources together with all related liabilities, obligations, reserves, and
equities which are segregated for the purpose of carrying on specific activities or attaining
certain objectives in accordance with special regulations, restrictions, or limitations.5
Source: Government Accounting, Auditing, and Financial Reporting (Chicago: Municipal
Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada, 1968), p. 6
Government transactions are recorded in one or more funds designed to emphasize control
and budgetary limitations. Examples of funds, established for a specific purpose, are highway main-
tenance, parks, debt repayment, endowment, and welfare. The number of funds utilized depends
on the responsibilities of the particular state or local government and the grouping of these respon-
sibilities. For example, highway maintenance and bridge maintenance may be grouped together.
Some governments do their accounting using a method that resembles a cash basis,
others use a modified accrual basis, and some use an accrual basis. A single government unit
may use more than one basis, depending on the fund. The trend is away from the cash basis
and toward the modified accrual basis or accrual basis.
Under the GASB, the most substantial pronouncement has been GASB Statement No.
34, which was issued in 1999. GASB Statement No. 34 redefines what constitutes basic fi-
nancial statements for state and local governments. This includes states, cities, towns, and
special-purpose governments such as school districts.
GASB Statement No. 34 provides minimum requirements for general-purpose external
financial statements. Exhibit 13-1 shows a diagram illustrating the minimum requirements.
The basic financial statements are to be preceded by the management’s discussion and
analysis (MD&A). The “MD&A should provide an objective and easily readable analysis of
the government’s financial activities based on currently known facts, decisions, or condi-
tions.”6 The “MD&A provides financial managers with the opportunity to present both a
short-term and a long-term analysis of the government’s activities.”7
Source: Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement
The MD&A must include8:
• An objective discussion of the basic financial statements and condensed financial infor-
mation comparing current and prior years
• An analysis of the overall financial position and results of operations

• An analysis of balances and transactions of individual funds
• An analysis of significant variations between the original and final budget and the final
budget and actual results for the general fund
• A description of significant capital–asset and long-term debt activity during the year
• Known facts, decisions, or conditions expected to have a significant impact on financial
position or results of operations
GASB Statement No. 34 makes it clear that neither government-wide statements nor
fund statements are considered superior or subordinate to the other. For the government-
wide statements, governmental activities are to be presented separately from the financial
statements of business-type activities. Examples of governmental activities are police and fire
departments; examples of business-type activities are airports and utilities.
The government-wide financial statements are to be prepared on an accrual basis for all
of the government’s activities. These government-wide financial statements help users:9
• Assess the finances of the government in its entirety, including the year’s operating
results
• Determine whether the government’s overall financial position improved or deteriorated
• Evaluate whether the government’s current-year revenues were sufficient to pay for
current-year services
• See the cost of providing services to its citizenry
• See how the government finances its programs—through user fees and other program
revenues versus general tax revenues
• Understand the extent to which the government has invested in capital assets, including
roads, bridges, and other infrastructure assets
• Make better comparisons between governments
As indicated previously, the government entity will continue to present fund statements.
The government entity uses funds to maintain its financial records during the year. The funds
enable the government entity to segregate transactions related to certain functions or activities
in separate funds in order to aid financial management and to demonstrate legal compliance.
As indicated earlier, a fund is defined as a fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing
set of accounts. The three categories of funds are governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary.
Governmental funds are those through which most governmental functions are financed.
These funds are used to account for the general operations of government.
Proprietary funds focus on maintaining capital or producing income, or both. Fiduciary
funds focus on assets held in a trustee or agency capacity on behalf of others external to the
government entity.

Government funds use the modified accrual basis of accounting. Proprietary and fiduci-
ary funds use the accrual basis of accounting. The differences in the accrual and modified
accrual bases of accounting come from the recognition of revenue, from the recording of
deferred revenue, and from the presentation of expenses versus expenditures.
A required reconciliation is to be presented reconciling the “government-wide financial
statements at the bottom of the fund financial statements or in an accompanying schedule.”10
Source: Journal of Accountancy
Notes to the financial statements are similar to notes of corporate statements in that they
provide information to aid the user’s understanding of the basic financial statements. In
addition, the notes must contain budgetary information that includes the original budget
and revised budgets. The budget, being a detailed plan of operations for each period,
includes an item-by-item estimate of expenditures when the representatives of the citizens
(city council, town meeting, and so on) approve the budget. The individual expenditures
then become limits. An increase in an approved expenditure will require approval by the
same representatives who set up a legal control over expenditures. This differs from the
budget for a commercial business, which is merely a plan of future revenues and expenses.
In addition to the notes to the financial statements, the typical governmental entity pro-
vides a statistical section. This statistical section includes important information that aids in the
understanding of the governmental entity. It also often presents historical, financial, analytical,
economic, and demographic information that may be useful for analysis. Exhibit 13-2 includes
parts of Table 2 of the statistical section from the 2010 comprehensive annual financial report
of the City of Toledo, Ohio. It includes expenses for business-type activities. A review of this
schedule provides insight into revenue for areas such as water, sewer and storm utilities.
Exhibit 13-3 shows Table 12 of the statistical section from the 2010 comprehensive an-
nual financial report of the City of Toledo, Ohio. It includes the ratio of net general bonded
debt to assessed value and net bonded debt per capita.
The comprehensive annual financial report will include a “Report of Independent Audi-
tors.” Review this report in detail. It could include important information relating to the fi-
nancial statements and the internal controls of the government entity.
In addition to the primary financial statements, the government entity will report on any
“component units,” which are legally separate organizations that hold the elected officials of
the primary government financially accountable. The financial data of the component units

are also included because of the significance of their operational or financial relationships
with the government entity.
To determine whether the government entity has one or more component units, review
the management’s discussion and analysis, government-wide financial statements, fund fi-
nancial statements, and notes for disclosure of component units. Also, review the Report of
Independent Auditors. “Financial statements of component units should be on an accrual ba-
sis of accounting.”11 The 2010 comprehensive annual financial report of the City of Toledo,
Ohio, did not disclose component units, but the comprehensive annual financial report of
Lucas County, Ohio, did reveal component units.
The Lucas County report provides a separate statement combining statements of net assets
of discretely presented component units and a separate statement of activities of discretely pre-
sented component units. The government-wide financial statements include a separate compo-
nent unit column to emphasize that they are legally separate from the county. Note 2 describes
the component units in detail. One of the component units is the Toledo Mud Hens Baseball
Club, Inc. Partial disclosure of the Toledo Mud Hens Baseball Club is as follows:
Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (In Part)
Discretely Presented Component Units
Toledo Mud Hens Baseball club, Inc. (the “Mud Hens”)
The Mud Hens were organized to own, manage, and operate a professional baseball
club. Upon dissolution, any remaining net assets become property of the Board of
County Commissioners and new appointments to the board of directors require con-
currence of the commissioners. The county receives rent from the Mud Hens to retire
non-tax revenue bonds issued to finance the construction of the baseball stadium. The
Mud Hens are reported on a fiscal year ending October 31.

A great variance exists in the quality of disclosure in the financial reporting of state and
local governments. Some poorly reported items have been pension liabilities, marketable
securities, inventories, fixed assets, and lease obligations.
The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada presents a
Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to governmental units and public
employee retirement systems whose comprehensive annual financial reports are judged to con-
form substantially to program standards. These standards are considered to be very rigorous.
The municipal bond rating of the governmental unit should also be determined. Stand-
ard & Poor’s, Fitch, and Moody’s evaluate and grade the quality of a bond relative to the
probability of default. One rating is assigned to all general obligation bonds (backed by the
full faith and credit of the governmental unit). Bonds not backed by the full faith and credit
of the governmental unit, such as industrial revenue bonds, are rated individually. These rat-
ings do not represent the probability of default by the governmental unit.
When reviewing a governmental financial statement, the following suggestions are helpful:
1. Determine if a Certificate of Achievement has been received.
2. a. Determine the bond rating of the governmental unit for its general obligation bonds.
Since the rating from Standard & Poor’s, Fitch, and Moody’s may differ, determine
the rating from each.
b. Determine the bond rating of bonds not backed by the full faith and credit of the
governmental unit. Again, determine the rating from Standard & Poor’s, Fitch, and
Moody’s.
3. Review the Report of Independent Auditors.
4. Review the management’s discussion and analysis.
5. Review the notes to the financial statements.
6. Review the government-wide financial statements.
7. Review the fund financial statements.
8. Review the supplementary information.
9. Look for component units. If component units are present, then determine the obligation
of the government unit to the component unit.
10. Review the statistical section.
Accounting for Not-for-Profit Organizations Other
Than Governments
Not-for-profit organizations account for a substantial portion of economic activity in the
United States. There are over 20,000 not-for-profit organizations in the United States.12
Examples of not-for-profit organizations include hospitals, religious institutions, professional
organizations, universities, and museums.
Not-for-profit accounting principles were derived from numerous not-for-profit industry
accounting manuals and audit guides. Examples were AICPA audit guides for Colleges and
Universities, Audits of Voluntary Health and Welfare Organizations, and audits of providers
of Health Care Services.
The FASB was concerned about the lack of uniformity in the accounting for not-for-
profit organizations and the lack of overall quality of not-for-profit organizations’ financial
reporting. To address this concern, the FASB issued four accounting standards relating to

not-for-profits. These standards are: (1) SFAS No. 93, “Recognition of Depreciation by Not-
for-Profit Organizations,” (2) SFAS No. 116, “Accounting for Contributions Received and
Contributions Made,” (3) SFAS No. 117, “Financial Statements of Not-for-Profit Organiza-
tions,” and (4) SFAS No. 124, “Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit
Organizations.” A brief description of these accounting standards and how they impact fi-
nancial reports follows:
1. SFAS No. 93, “Recognition of Depreciation by Not-for-Profit
Organizations”13
Prior to SFAS No. 93, most not-for-profit organizations did not recognize depreciation.
SFAS No. 93 requires not-for-profit organizations to recognize depreciation on long-lived
tangible assets. SFAS No. 93 includes these requirements relating to depreciation.
1. Disclose the amount of depreciation expense for each period.
2. Disclose depreciable assets by major classes as of the balance sheet date.
3. Disclose accumulated depreciation for each asset class or in total as of the balance sheet
date.
4. Disclose the methods used to calculate depreciation.
SFAS No. 93 exempts individual works of art or historical treasures from the deprecia-
tion requirements. For this exemption, two requirements must be met:
1. The asset must have “cultural, aesthetic, or historical value that is worth preserving
perpetually.”
2. The organization that owns the artwork or historical treasure must be able to preserve
the asset so that its potentially unlimited service potential will remain intact.
2. SFAS No. 116, “Accounting for Contributions Received
and Contributions Made”14
SFAS No. 116 applies to all not-for-profit organizations as well as to any entity that receives
or makes contributions. Some key aspects of SFAS No. 116 are summarized.
Contributions Received
Contributions received are to be recognized as revenues or gains in the period received. In
addition, these contributions are to be recognized as assets, as decreases in liabilities, or as
expenses in the same period. Contributions received are to be measured at their fair values
and reported as restricted support or unrestricted support.
Contributed services received are to be recognized if one of the following conditions holds:
1. The service creates or enhances nonfinancial assets
2. The services involve specialized skills that would most likely be paid for if they were not
donated (i.e., electrical services, plumbing services, accounting services, etc.)
Contributed services recognized should be disclosed by nature and amount for the pe-
riod. Service contributions are to be valued at the fair value of the services or the resulting
increase in assets.
Under SFAS No. 116, donated works of art, historical treasures, or similar assets can be
excluded if the following conditions are met:
1. Contributed items are held for public service purposes rather than for financial gain.
2. Contributed items must be protected, kept unencumbered, cared for, and preserved.
3. The organization must have a policy of using funds from the sales of collected items to
purchase additional collection pieces.
Contributions received are to be segregated into permanent restrictions, temporary
restrictions, and unrestricted support imposed by donors. Restricted contributions shall be
reported as an increase in either permanently restricted net assets or temporarily restricted

net assets. Unrestricted contributions received are to be reported as unrestricted support and
increases in unrestricted net assets. Contributions received are to be measured at fair value.
Conditional promises are to be recognized in the financial statements when the condi-
tion(s) has been substantially met. If the nature of the conditional promise is ambiguous, it
should be interpreted as conditional.
Contributions Made
Contributions made are to be recognized as expenses in the period in which they are made.
These contributions are to be reported as decreases in assets or increases in liabilities. Contribu-
tions made are to be measured at the fair value of the asset contributed or the liability dis-
charged. Conditional promises to give are recognized when the conditions are substantially met.
3. SFAS No. 117, “Financial Statements of Not-for-Profit Organizations”15
Prior to SFAS No. 117, there were significant differences in the financial reports of not-for-
profit organizations. The intent of SFAS No. 117 is to provide consistency in the financial
statements of not-for-profit organizations. SFAS No. 117 addresses financial statements, the
content of financial statements, and the classification of financial statement information.
Not-for-profit organizations are to present three aggregated financial statements. These
include a statement of financial position, a statement of activities, and a statement of cash
flows. SFAS No. 117 specifies the content of each of these required financial statements.
Concerning the statement of financial position, SFAS No. 117 directs that it is to include
aggregated information about the assets, liabilities, and net assets. SFAS No. 117 requires
the statement of activity to provide information concerning the effects of transactions on the
amount and nature of net assets, the interrelationships between those transactions and other
events, and how the organization uses the resources to provide services. The statement of ac-
tivity is also to disclose the changes in the amounts of permanently restricted net assets, tem-
porarily restricted net assets, and unrestricted net assets.
With regard to the content of the statement of cash flows, SFAS No. 117 requires that
not-for-profit organizations comply with SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” In addi-
tion, SFAS No. 117 amends SFAS No. 95 concerning its description of financing activities.
Financing activities now include receipts of donations restricted for acquiring, constructing,
or improving long-lived assets or establishing or increasing permanent or term endowments.
For the statement of financial position, SFAS No. 117 requires that assets and liabilities
should be reported in relatively homogeneous groups. They should also be classified to pro-
vide information about their interrelationships, liquidity, and financial flexibility. New assets
are to be classified as either permanently restricted, temporarily restricted, or unrestricted.
Revenues, expenses, gains, and losses are to be separated into reasonably homogeneous
groups for the statement of activities. They also are to be classified as affecting permanently
restricted, temporarily restricted, or unrestricted net assets.
4. SFAS No. 124, “Accounting for Certain Investments Held By Not-for-Profit
Organizations”16
This statement applies to investments in equity securities that have a readily determinable
fair value and to all investments in debt securities. These investments are to be shown at their
fair values in the statement of financial position. This statement does not apply to invest-
ments in equity securities that are accounted for under the equity method or to investments
in consolidated subsidiaries. Disclosure requirements in the statement of financial position
include the aggregate carrying value of investments by major categories and the basis for
determining the carrying values of equity securities without readily determinable fair market
values. Any shortfall in the fair value of donor-restricted endowment funds below the
amount required by donor stipulations or by law must also be disclosed.
For the statement of activities, any realized or unrealized gains and losses are to be
shown. Some of the disclosure requirements for the statement of activities include the com-
position of the investment return, which consists of investment income, realized gains and
losses on investments not reported at fair value, and net gains and losses on investments that
are reported at fair value.

Applicability of GAAP to Not-for-Profit Organizations
Some individuals believed that the applicability of GAAP to not-for-profit organizations was
unclear. SOP 94-2 was issued to address the applicability of GAAP to not-for-profit organizations.17
SOP 94-2 concludes that not-for-profit organizations should follow the guidance in
effective provisions of ARBs, APB Opinions, and FASB Statements and Interpretations unless
the specific pronouncement explicitly exempts not-for-profit organizations or their subject
matter precludes such applicability (SOP 94-2, paragraph .09).
Exhibit 13-4 contains the consolidated statement of financial position and the consoli-
dated statement of activities for the Ohio Society of Certified Public Accountants. These
statements are for the year ended April 30, 2011. Not included in Exhibit 13-4 are the inde-
pendent auditors’ report, consolidated statements of cash flows, notes to consolidated finan-
cial statements, independent auditors’ report on supplementary information, consolidating
statement of financial position, and consolidating statement of activities.
Budgeting by Objectives and/or Measures of Productivity
Accounting for not-for-profit institutions differs greatly from accounting for a profit-
oriented enterprise. The accounting for a profit-oriented business centers on the entity con-
cept and the efficiency of the entity. The accounting for governments and accounting for
not-for-profit organizations do not include an entity concept or efficiency. The accounting
for a profit-oriented business has a bottom-line net income. The accounting for governments
and accounting for not-for-profit organizations do not have a bottom line.
Some governments and not-for-profit organizations have added budgeting by objectives
and/or measures of productivity to their financial reporting to incorporate measures of effi-
ciency. The article, “Budgeting by Objectives: Charlotte’s Experience,” reported several

objectives incorporated in the budget of Charlotte, North Carolina. Four primary objectives
guided the budget: (1) the property tax rate should not increase, (2) continued emphasis
should be placed on making the best use of city employees and the present computer capabil-
ity, (3) any budget increase should be held to a minimum, and (4) a balanced program of
services should be presented.18
This article also reports measures of productivity that Charlotte has used. These meas-
ures of productivity include (1) customers served per $1,000 of sanitation expense, (2) num-
ber of tons of refuse per $1,000 expense, and (3) street miles flushed per $1,000 expense.19
Budgeting by objectives and/or measures of productivity could be added to the financial
reporting of any not-for-profit institution. The objectives and measures of productivity
should be applicable to the particular not-for-profit institution.

Summary
This chapter reviewed financial reporting for personal finan-
cial statements and accounting for governments and other
not-for-profit organizations. Accounting for these areas dif-
fers greatly from accounting for profit-oriented businesses.
This difference has been narrowed substantially for not-for-
profit organizations other than governments.
Statement of Position 82-1 presents guidelines for the
preparation of personal financial statements. SOP 82-1 con-
cludes that personal financial statements should present
assets at their estimated current values and liabilities at
their estimated current amounts at the date of the financial
statements. This differs from commercial financial state-
ments that predominantly use historical information.
GASB Statement No. 34 redefines what constitutes ba-
sic financial statements for state and local governments.
Minimum requirements for general-purpose external finan-
cial statements—state and local governments include man-
agement discussion and analysis (MD&A), government-wide
financial statements, fund financial statements, and required
supplementary information (other than MD&A).
Not-for-profit accounting for organizations, other than
governments, has changed substantially. It now resembles
accounting for profit organizations. A major difference is
that not-for-profit organizations issue a statement of activ-
ities instead of an income statement.
Some not-for-profit institutions have added budgeting
by objectives and/or measures of productivity to their fi-
nancial reporting to incorporate measures of efficiency.

Problems
P 13-1 For each of these situations, indicate the amount to be placed on a statement of
financial condition at December 31, 2012.
a. Bill and Pat Konner purchased their home at 2829 Willow Road in Stow, Ohio, in
August 1994 for $80,000. The unpaid mortgage is $20,000. Immediately after
purchasing the home, Bill and Pat added several improvements totaling $10,000. Real
estate prices in Stow have increased 40% since the time of purchase.
From the facts given, determine the estimated current value of the home.
b. Joe Best drives a Toyota, for which he paid $20,000 when it was new. Joe believes that
since he maintains the car in good condition, he could sell it for $12,000. The average
selling price for this model of Toyota is $9,000.
From the facts given, determine the estimated current value of Joe’s car.
c. Sue Bell is 40 years old and has an IRA with a balance of $20,000. The IRS penalty for
early withdrawal is 10%. The marginal tax rate for Sue Bell is 30% (tax on gross amount).
What is the estimated current value of the IRA and the estimated income taxes on the
difference between the estimated current values of assets and the estimated current
amounts of liabilities and their tax bases?
d. Bill Kell guaranteed a loan of $8,000 for his girlfriend to buy a car. She is behind in
payments on the car.
What liability should be shown on Bill Kell’s statement of financial condition?
e. Dick Better bought a home in 1996 for $70,000. Currently, the mortgage on the home
is $45,000. Because of the current high interest rates, the bank has offered to retire the
mortgage for $40,000.
What is the estimated current value of this liability?
P 13-2 For each of these situations, indicate the amount to be placed on a statement of
financial condition at December 31, 2012.
a. Raj Reel owns the following securities:
1,000 shares of Ree’s
2,000 shares of Bell’s
Ree’s is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The prices from the most recent
trade day follow:
Open

Bell’s is a local company whose stock is sold by brokers on a workout basis.
(The broker tries to find a buyer.) The most recent selling price was $8.
What is the estimated current value of these securities? (Assume that the commission
on Ree’s would be $14 and the commission on Bell’s would be $17.)

b. Charlie has a certificate of deposit with a $10,000 balance. Accrued interest is $500.
The penalty for early withdrawal would be $300.
What is the estimated current value of the certificate of deposit?
c. Jones has an option to buy 500 shares of ABC Construction at a price of $20 per share.
The option expires in one year. ABC Construction shares are presently selling for $25.
What is the estimated current value of these options?
d. Carl Jones has a whole-life insurance policy with the face amount of $100,000, cash
value of $50,000, and a loan outstanding against the policy of $20,000. Susan Jones is
the beneficiary.
What is the estimated current value of the insurance policy?
e. Larry Solomon paid $60,000 for a home 10 years ago. The unpaid mortgage on the home
is $30,000. Larry estimates the current value of the home to be $90,000. This estimate is
partially based on the selling price of homes recently sold in the neighborhood. Larry’s

Cases
CASE 13-1 DEFICIT BUDGET?
In July 2003, the Medical College of Ohio (MCO) (now part of the University of Toledo)
approved its first deficit budget of $3.4 million, but no programs or faculty members were cut.
MCO announced a “mission-based” study of all programs and an examination of how
financially viable they are, as well as how essential they are.
MCO was projected to lose money because of recognizing depreciation expense. Without
depreciation expense, MCO would have a $5 million profit for fiscal year 2004.
In recognizing depreciation expense, MCO was adopting a new accounting standard
passed in 2000 that requires colleges (universities) to account for depreciation. Many col-
leges adopted the new standard by disclosing in a note in their audited financial statements,
not their operating budgets.
Required
a. In your opinion, should colleges and universities recognize depreciation expense? Comment.
b. Is recognizing depreciation expense in a note equivalent to recognizing depreciation
expense in the statements? Comment.
c. Should the standard be explicit on how a college or university recognizes depreciation
expense? Comment.
Note: Information relating to this case comes from “MCO Board Votes Its 1st Deficit Budget,”
The Blade, Toledo, Ohio, July 29, 2003, Section B, pp. 1–2.

CASE 13-2 MY MUD HENS
Toledo Mud Hens Baseball Club, Inc., is a not-for-profit organization that is a separate legal
entity and can be sued in its own right.
The Toledo Mud Hens are probably the most famous team in all of minor league base-
ball. They have been named the Toledo Mud Hens since 1896 when the team played at Bay
View Park. The surrounding marshland was frequented by these strange birds.
Famous people such as Casey Stengel, Jamie Farr, and Bob Costas have helped bring the
team nationwide fame. Players who have contributed to the team’s fame include Moses Fleet-
wood Walker, Addie Joss, Tony Clark, Kirby Puckett, Travis Fryman, and Kirk Gibson.

Moses Fleetwood Walker was born on October 7, 1856, in Ohio to Moses M. Walker,
a physician, and Caroline, a midwife. He attended and played baseball at Oberlin College
and the University of Michigan. In 1883, Walker joined the newly formed Toledo Blue
Stockings and became the first African-American major league baseball player when Toledo
joined the major league–sanctioned American Association the following year. As a bare-
handed catcher, his biggest assets were his catching ability, powerful throwing arm, and
aggressive base running. He endured racial prejudice from teammates, opponents, and base-
ball fans and eventually left to become a writer, inventor, civil rights advocate, and entrepre-
neur. Walker was elected to the Ohio Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991. He died in 1924 and is
buried in Steubenville, Ohio, in the family plot at Union Cemetery.
There is now a Moses Fleetwood Walker Society in Toledo, Ohio. It has an annual din-
ner after the World Series. The dinner and dues help raise money to buy baseball items for
underprivileged kids. On August 1, 2011, the Toledo Mud Hens honored the first African-
American to play Major League Baseball. Moses Fleetwood Walker played for the Toledo
Blue Stockings in 1884.
By 1889 blacks were barred from the high minor leagues and the major leagues. It
remained that way until 1947 when Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers.
Casey Stengel skippered six Toledo teams, including the 1927 squad that won the Junior
World Series.
In 2002, the team moved into a new facility. The County issued $20 million in economic
development revenue bonds and $6 million in economic development revenue anticipation
notes in March 2001. The County retired the notes in March 2002 after receiving revenue
for the naming rights (Fifth Third Field) and the lease of the luxury suites.
Lucas County receives rent from the Mud Hens that in the County’s opinion is substan-
tially below market rate. The board of the Mud Hens is approved by the Board of County
Commissioners.
The Mud Hens’ ball park was named by Newsweek Magazine as the best minor league
park. The largest video board in minor league baseball was added to the park in 2005.
Another large video board was added in 1909.

Thomson ONE Basics
and Tutorial
T
homson ONE is a web-based portal product that provides integrated access to Thom-
son Financial content for the purpose of financial analysis. As such, it delivers a
broad range of financial content. The following Thomson ONE basics and tutorial
are designed to help you learn how to use important features of this tool geared toward
various types of financial analyses. While the product you are using is the Thomson ONE –
Business School Edition, you are likely to use this or a similar program in your professional
career.
Logging On to Thomson ONE
In Exhibit A-1, you see the welcome screen for Thomson ONE. You can log on to Thomson
ONE at www.cengage.com/thomsonone. To do this for the first time, you will need to click
on the “Register” button to register the access code from the access card packaged with your
textbook. Once you have registered this code, you can create a username and password so
that you will be able to return to the site for subsequent research sessions by hitting the
“Enter” button.

After Logging On
After logging on to Thomson ONE, you will see the screen shown in Exhibit A-2. If you click
on “What companies can I access…,” you will see a list of 500 companies and their ticker
symbols available for access under this edition of the database. However, if you already
know what company you are looking for and are ready to begin your financial analysis, then
you would click the hyperlink that says: “Click Here to Access Thomson ONE – Business
School Edition Now!”
Company Search
Once Thomson ONE is accessed, on the upper left-hand side of your screen, you should see
an input field for your company query, followed by a box that says “Portfolios” and a series
of folders that will allow you to search for diverse types of financial information (Exhibit A-3).
Let’s begin our search with an overview about a company (the default mode for this database).
To enter your company, you can either enter a ticker symbol (to look up the company) or the
name of the company in the top box on the left.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Let’s say that you want to access information about Abbott Laboratories, Inc. in the
USA. You can access this in a couple different ways:
1. Type “abbott” in the box and hit “Go,” or
2. Type “abbott” in the box and do a Ticker Lookup using the magnifying glass icon.
At that point you will see a “Company Screening” page (Exhibit A-4).
This page pops up if there is more than one company listing that matches your query. In
this case, you need to choose between:
• ABBOTT INDIA LIMITED,
• ABBOTT LABORATORIES in the USA, and
• ABBOTT LABORATORIES (PAKISTAN) LIMITED
before Thomson ONE will go to the Overview Report.
If there was only one company matching your query, then the Overview Report would
pop up immediately.
Types of Information
When you select the Company Analysis mode and have a company identifier in the
Companies text box, the Company Overview information page is displayed by default.
In Exhibit A-5, notice that the main modes include: (1) Company Analysis, (2) Indices,
(3) Comparables, (4) Screening and Targeting, and (5) Tools.

For most accounting courses, your research will probably come from the Company
Analysis mode, which is the focus of this tutorial. Within Company Analysis, there are 8
folders. Many of these folders have sub-menu options and are summarized below.
The first folder, “Overview,” includes the following information:
• Address and website of the company,
• A Business Description Summary,
• Industry, Sector, and Stock Exchange,
• The three most recent years of key financials,
• Earnings Per Share (EPS) Forecasts, and
• Key Executives and links to compensation and members of Board Committees and
Directors.
The second folder, “News & Events,” includes news items that are fed into Thomson
ONE every 20 minutes. The split screen view shows relevant news for the company being
researched in terms of both the:
• Top market news stories and links (in one frame) and
• Global news coverage (in the other frame).
The third folder, “Prices,” focuses on detailed stock quotes, performance overviews,
price history reports, & interactive charts.

deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

The fourth folder, “Financials,” provides a wide variety of financial statements, financial
ratios, and comparative financials charts. As you go through the sub-menu options you will
notice that financial statements and ratios are drawn from several sources including: World-
scope, Thomson Financials, and the SEC. In addition, this folder has many options that
allow users to download PDF and Excel formats of data, as well as printable reports. There
are also a variety of options to facilitate comparability. These include the CURRENCY
option shown by the
icon and the SCALE option shown by the
icon at the top of
the open window. The CURRENCY option allows users to recast the financial statements in
various currencies, including U.S. dollars, British Pounds, Euros, Japanese yen, and more.
The SCALE option allows users to recast financial statement in terms of thousands, millions,
and billions.
As you will find in your research, the definition of financial ratios may vary. However,
Thomson ONE provides a wealth of information about the definition of financial ratios,
defined for the various Thomson ONE sources and for various industries.
As an example, let’s look at Abbott Laboratories again. You are interested in the com-
pany’s return on total assets, so you first open Financials> Financial Ratios> SEC Ratios>
Annual Ratios. You find Net Income/Total Assets is equal to 0.12% for 12/31/08. To make
sure that it is calculated the way you understand it, you can double-click on the amount and
a new window pops up to show the definition. According to this:
The SEC Item Name: NET INCOME TO TOTAL ASSETS is calculated as:
= Net Income/Total Assets
This Profitability ratio assesses the profitability of a business in relation to its assets
at a given point in time. Generally, the higher the return on assets, the more skillfully
management is using its resources.
As you continue your research, you are interested in what the other sources show for
this ratio. Are they the same or is there some type of adjustment that might help you in your
analysis? If you open Financials> Financial Ratios> Thomson Ratios> Annual Ratios, you
see that the first Profitability Ratio is Return on Assets. Is that the same as the SEC ratio?
When you look at the amount for 12/31/08, the number is dramatically different. How did
they calculate it? Just like before, you would double-click on the amount, which is 13.22,
and a new window pops up to show that the definition is much different and varies with
industries:
Definition: Worldscope Item Name: RETURN ON ASSETS; Profitability Ratio,
Annual/Interim Item; Field 08326
For Industrial Companies Annual Time Series, the ratio is computed as:
(Net Income before Preferred Dividends + ((Interest Expense on Debt-Interest Capi-
talized) * (1−Tax Rate))) / Last Year’s Total Assets * 100
For Banks, the ratio is computed as:
Net Income before Preferred Dividends + ((Interest Expense on Debt-Interest Capital-
ized) * (1−Tax Rate))) / (Last Year’s Total Assets −Last Year’s Customer Liabilities
on Acceptances) * 100. (Customer Liabilities on Acceptances only subtracted when
included in Total Assets.)
For Insurance Companies, the ratio is computed as:
(Net Income before Preferred Dividends + ((Interest Expense on Debt-Interest Capi-
talized) *(1−Tax Rate))) + Policyholders’ Surplus) / Last Year’s Total Assets * 100
For Other Financial Companies, the ratio is computed as:
(Net Income before Preferred Dividends + ((Interest Expense on Debt-Interest Capital-
ized) * (1−Tax Rate))) / (Last Year’s Total Assets −Last Year’s Custody Securities) * 100
There are some exceptions noted for U.S. Companies due to the Standard Tax Rate
Used in Calculations: In 1986 and prior years: 46% tax rate; In 1987 to 1994: 34%
tax rate; In 1995 and subsequent years: 35% tax rate

For All Industries Interim Time Series:
((Trailing 12 Months Net Profit + (Trailing 12 Months Interest Expense On Debt *
(1−Tax Rate/100)))) / Last Year’s Total Assets * 100
The fifth folder under Company Analysis is “Estimates.” This folder includes informa-
tion about:
• Yearly and quarterly Earnings Per Share data,
• Price Earnings ratios, and
• Broker recommendations about the company’s stock.
The sixth folder, “Filings,” maintains downloadable SEC filings for the company. These
include PDF, Microsoft Word, and html formats.
The seventh folder is the “Comparables” folder. As you experiment with Thomson ONE,
you will find that there are many types of comparative reports that may be of interest to you in
your research. In particular, the “Comparables” set-
ting can be activated to allow users to display key
financial data for the peers or competitors for the com-
pany selected. Once your company is opened in Over-
view, go to Comparables and select peers according to
SIC Code, industry, sectors, etc. This peer group listing
will appear in a separate window on the left of
the screen, as well as be noted as a portfolio option (see
Exhibit A-6).
Notice that the Portfolio option provides a way to
build a number of sets of companies for comparison
purposes and creates reports on items such as: profit-
ability, performance, liquidity analysis, etc. Both
default and custom peer sets can be saved to your Port-
folio User Folder. For example, if we wanted to create
a working portfolio of just Abbott Laboratories, Bayer
AG, and ELI Lilly & Company, we would select each
company’s box on the far left and then click on the
“New” button (just above the check boxes). This
would create our new working portfolio, which would
be listed in the drop-down Portfolios choices.
Finally, the eighth folder under Company Analy-
sis is “Report Writer.” This tool allows users to pre-
pare customized reports for a single company or
tabular format reports that can include multiple
companies.
Conclusion
While this has been a quick look at Thomson ONE, be
sure to take advantage of all the hyperlinks and pull-
down menus that the database offers but may not have
been mentioned. By leveraging the easy-to-use technol-
ogy and spreadsheet formatting of this one-stop data-
base, you will be able to save time by drilling down
and mastering the concepts explained in your text, as
well as advancing your understanding of financial
accounting, SEC filings, and market research.
