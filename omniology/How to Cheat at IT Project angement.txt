Writing a book is a rewarding experience, but it’s certainly not a solo venture.
Thanks ﬁrst to my immediate friends and family—Lisa,Amy, Dee Ann, Rosie,
Jackie Brown, and Bailee.Thanks for putting up with me, book writing and
all.Thanks to my mother,Anne, for early instruction in English grammar (it
started at birth and continues to this day…) and for ongoing support of my
writing efforts.Thanks to my father, Richard, for instilling in me a love for all
things technical. Special thanks to my dear friend Shirley for a lifetime of
encouragement.
I’d also like to thank my MBA friend Patty Hoenig for introducing me to
Nels, the talented technical editor for this tome. Sincere gratitude and thanks to
Nels—you did a great job on the technical editing. I enjoyed our virtual conver-
sations and the book beneﬁted from those shared insights.You contributed to
the depth and breadth of this book and the content is that much stronger for it.
It was an insightful collaborative experience and I’d do it again in a heartbeat.
Thanks also to the friends and colleagues who agreed to supply real world
examples for the book including Amy Buttery, Chris Compton, Gary Frost,
David Getman, Lorraine Gutsche, Nels Hoenig, Chris Landi, Lisa Mainz, Kim
Nagle, Sonal Rana and Ralph Spitzen.
I’d also like to thank Nick Mammana for demanding excellence earlier in
my life and Sensei Ken Carson for teaching me the real meaning of kaizen
(continuous improvement). Both were instrumental in helping me develop the
professional and personal skills I have today.
Finally, I’d like to thank the brilliant folks at Syngress who do what they do
to bring these books to fruition.Andrew, thanks for making this book possible
and Jaime, thanks for making this process as enjoyable as you do and for your
diligent efforts on all fronts. I think I’ll take a couple days off now; I encourage
you to do the same.

Unlike any other book you’ll ﬁnd, this IT project management book synthe-
sizes project management fundamentals, IT processes and procedures, and the
bare bones of business. Many IT professionals are incredibly bright people who
have a passion for technology. If they’re really good, they also get along well
with others. If they’re exceptional, they also understand the business implica-
tions of their department, their technology initiatives and their projects. In this
book, you’ll learn how to become an exceptional IT professional.Whether
you’re an IT manager who oversees the department and manages IT projects, or
a member of the team who is sometimes an IT project manager, you’ll learn
how to align your projects to the company’s strategic objectives, how to
develop a strategic plan for your IT department, how to pick the right projects
to solve the right problems and how to add value to your company.And if
you’ve ever wondered how to get on the fast-track to CIO…you might just be
holding the answer in your hands.
As a business and technology consultant, I examine and explore businesses
everyday. Based on my observations, you should know that the way your com-
pany runs projects is probably like 98% of all the other companies out there—
often a bit disorganized, very stressful, and less-than-successful. I’m always
surprised by how many people tell me that they’ve already had project manage-
ment training.When I ask how much of it they still use, most tell me they use
none of it.This begs the question:Why has past PM training failed to be inte-
grated into the project process? Most will tell me in a round about way that the
system was too complex, took too much effort, or required too big of a change.
Human nature is such that we tend make small changes more effectively than
large, wholesale changes. If you’ve ever tried to lose weight, start eating better or
get more exercise, you know this is true. If you’re completely sedentary, you
might be able to consistently add a 10 minute walk during your lunch hour, but
you’re not likely to stick to a stringent daily hour of power aerobics at the gym.
The same holds true for IT project management fundamentals. Most people
will not implement the system end-to-end unless there is tremendous pressure
and support from within the company at the executive level. Failing this, PM

systems (and any other improvement processes) become nothing more than the
ﬂavor of the month and this syndrome quickly engenders a cynical view of
process improvement in general. So, I take a different approach. Don’t try to
implement the system end-to-end if that doesn’t work for you. Pick one thing
and do it consistently; then add another—continuous improvement.As I’ve
taught this in various training seminars, I’ve encouraged students to pick one
thing and do it consistently, then add to their repertoire until they are prac-
ticing textbook project management…one step at a time. Sure, it would be
great if they could simply do everything right today, but that’s not likely to
happen. My goal is to gradually get you to improve your IT PM skills, even if it
takes 6 or 12 or 18 months. Eventually is better than never.
This book is not intended to provide the most exhaustive look at IT PM ever
written. It is intended to get you up and running in IT PM with the least
amount of effort and the most amount of improvement possible. For those of you
looking for the encyclopedia of formal IT project management, you won’t ﬁnd it
here (I refer you to the PMBOK).This book and the IT PM process it describes
is not process-heavy.Anyone aquainted with me knows I’m a real results-oriented
person, and I loathe process for process’ sake.The only process I am comfortable
with is that which drives the outcomes I want, so this book takes a minimalist
approach to process (less is more).Where processes are deﬁned, they are the
shortest, least complex ways to get from Point A to Point B.
I’ve trained in Shotokan karate for many years and my sensei, Mr. Ken
Carson, always says “Power comes from good fundamentals, speed comes from
practice.”As 6th dan black belt (karate and judo) who has trained and taught for
over 60 years, if Sensei Carson says it’s so, it’s so. Companies (and IT profes-
sionals) that implement consistent project management practices will build a
solid foundation.As the organization becomes familiar with the processes and
internalizes them, they will also gain speed and knowledge. Companies that are
stronger, faster and smarter win in the end. It’s not just a one-shot effort, either.
It is a process of continuous improvement (kaizen).As you consistently imple-
ment project management practices, you, your IT projects, your department and
company will continuously improve as well.This book gives you a shortcut to
those skills so you can get the basics quickly and start using them today.

Introduction
If you read the introduction to this book, you already know what project manage-
ment has to do with IT, but now we’re going to break it down a bit further and
look at how Information Technology (IT) projects beneﬁt from project management
and by extension, how your career will beneﬁt from project management. In this
chapter, we’ll begin by looking brieﬂy at business process improvement and how
project management ﬁts into that world. We’ll also look at some of the brutal facts
about project success (or rather, failure) rates as well as the factors that can have the
most impact on project success. We’ll close out the chapter by looking at project
constraints and elements to give you a solid foundation for the subsequent chapters.
Let’s start by looking at business process improvement systems and where project
management ﬁts.
Business Process Improvement Systems
Business process improvement (BPI) has been around in different “ﬂavors” for decades.
Companies continually look for ways to become more efﬁcient, and with efﬁciency
often comes competitive advantage. If a company can create a computer program or
a part for a car at a lower cost than another company, it has a distinct advantage. It
can sell the part for less than its competitors, which often leads to greater market
share.That company also has the option of selling the product for the same as its
competitors, but making a larger proﬁt on each unit. With more proﬁt comes the
ability to pick and choose markets, pricing, proﬁt margins, etc. So, it makes sense that
companies are constantly looking for ways to improve their business processes to
gain that advantage. In a moment, we’ll take a look at some of the more popular
business process improvement methods being used by companies today.To tie it all
in, we’ll begin with project management since project management is, essentially,
one aspect of improving business processes. Project management is a structured
methodology for evaluating, deﬁning, and managing projects, so it clearly ﬁts into
the business process improvement arena.
The Project Management Institute
As with other BPI systems, project management (PM) also has many different ﬂavors,
but essentially, project management is project management. Numerous companies
develop and sell proprietary systems and approaches to PM, but ultimately those sys-
tems all use the same fundamentals.That’s not to say that some companies haven’t
developed extremely effective systems. It’s just that the fundamentals are the same,

Chapter 1 • What’s Project Management Got to Do with IT?

regardless of which system you use. Projects are projects: small, large, simple, com-
plex, short, long, economical, expensive, and everything in between.All projects,
regardless of size, complexity, or cost can beneﬁt from using PM principles, but there
are other quality programs that companies use as well—sometimes in conjunction
with PM and sometimes in place of PM. Regardless of the approach you take,
implementing a consistent, quality-focused process will improve your results.
The Project Management Institute (PMI) is widely recognized in the United States
as a leader in the project management ﬁeld and an organization that sets forth pro-
ject management standards. PMI states they have over 150,000 members in 150
countries. PMI provides two certiﬁcations in project management, both of which are
currently considered the gold standards in project management. PMI also publishes
the Project Management Body of Knowledge. PMI sponsors seminars, events, and training
related to project management.There are other international organizations such as
the International Project Management Association, which is based in the
Netherlands.There are many other reputable PM training and certiﬁcation programs
on the market today including those from leading universities and colleges around
the country. Some programs and certiﬁcations are more accepted than others. PMI
certiﬁcations are the accepted standard, but remember that in many cases PM certiﬁ-
cation is not required for the job. If you want to get a job as a project manager, a
PMI certiﬁcation can help, but experience and knowledge in PM will often sufﬁce.
After reading this book, you’ll have a better understanding of what’s involved in PM,
and if you’re interested in pursuing a career as a project manager you can look into
formal training and certiﬁcation.You can ﬁnd out more about PMI on their website
at www.pmi.org.
CMM and CMMI
The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the Capability Maturity Model Integration
(CMMI) are not project management systems but process improvement methodolo-
gies. Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute (SEI) developed these
models as approaches to process improvement in software development. Currently,
CMM is being phased out in favor of CMMI.The CMMI system focuses on various
disciplines such as software engineering, system engineering, integrated product and
process development, and supplier sourcing. For example, according to the SEI website,
the CMMI process in software engineering focuses on “applying systematic, disci-
plined, and quantiﬁable approaches to the development, operation, and maintenance of
software.”Applying a systematic, disciplined, and quantiﬁable approach sounds a lot like
project management.There is clearly overlap and both PM and CMMI processes can
co-exist synergistically in an organization. For more information on CMMI, visit the
Software Engineering Institute website at www.sei.cmu.edu.

Six Sigma
Six Sigma is another process improvement system that seems to have taken corporate
America by storm. Six Sigma is deﬁned as a highly disciplined process that helps
companies focus on developing and delivering near-perfect products and services.
The term six sigma is a statistical term that measures how far a given process deviates
from perfection. From a mathematical standpoint, six sigma speciﬁes fewer than 3.4
defects per million. Stated the other way, it means that 99.99966% of all output
meets quality standards.The idea behind Six Sigma is that if you can measure how
many defects you have in a process, you can systematically ﬁgure out how to elimi-
nate them and get as close to zero defects as possible.This quality improvement pro-
cess can be traced back to Motorola in the 1970’s when it was facing serious quality
problems.The project was developed by Mikel Harry, a senior staff engineer at
Motorola’s Government Electronic Group and he named the process Six Sigma.
Motorola states it saved $250 million the ﬁrst year it implemented Six Sigma prac-
tices. Later, Jack Welch, CEO of General Electric, evangelized Six Sigma within his
organization and Six Sigma gained momentum quickly after that. GE claims it saved
$750 million in 1995 alone and Allied Signal claims $165 million in savings through
implementing Six Sigma practices.
There are those who think that Six Sigma is just another management or busi-
ness improvement “ﬂavor of the month.” Indeed, Six Sigma builds upon a lot of pre-
vious quality work including that of Edwards Deming, the architect of post-World
War II industrial revival in Japan.Another consideration is the cost to organizations.
Individuals in the organization must be trained in the system and these individuals,
depending on their skill levels are dubbed “white belts,”“green belts,”“black belts,”
“master black belts,” and “champions.” GE reportedly spent over $465 million to
have over 10,000 employees trained and certiﬁed in this system.
To complicate matters, there is no one single governing body as there is with
CMMI. Instead, Six Sigma was driven by industry and is therefore deﬁned by var-
ious companies. While there are deﬁned best practices, Six Sigma certiﬁcations and
business processes vary from company to company. For instance, if you achieve
“black belt” certiﬁcation at one company and then go to another company, you may
have to undergo recertiﬁcation or retraining.Another implementation, Lean Six
Sigma, is also gaining popularity in the market. For more information, you can query
“Six Sigma” on your favorite Internet search engine and come up with many com-
panies offering Six Sigma information and certiﬁcation.
While formal Six Sigma may not be for every company or every person, signiﬁ-
cant process improvement gains can and have been made by implementing Six
Sigma processes.Business or management improvement programs typically only

become “ﬂavor of the month” when corporate executives fail to fully support, fund,
and implement the chosen process.
ISO 9000
The International Standards Organization (ISO) is a non-proﬁt organization dedicated to
developing and maintaining standards in a wide variety of areas. One well-known stan-
dard is ISO 9000, which has become an international reference for quality require-
ments in business-to-business dealings.Another emerging “generic standard” (meaning
it is not industry or business-speciﬁc) is ISO 14000, which is trying to achieve at least
as much recognition and acceptance as ISO 9000 (if not more) in helping organiza-
tions to meet environmental challenges. Recent changes to the ISO 9000 standard
have resulted in the merging of the ISO 9001, ISO 9002, and ISO 9003 standards into
the new ISO 9001:2000, which is the sole certiﬁcation standard in the ISO 9000
family. ISO 9001:2000 is now the only standard in the ISO 9000 family against whose
requirements a company’s quality system can be certiﬁed by an external agency.The
standard recognizes that the word “product” applies to services, processed material,
hardware, and software intended for, or required by, your customer.
Like CMM, CMMI, or Six Sigma, the ISO standards are focused on developing
consistent, deﬁned, and repeatable processes to improve quality. For more informa-
tion on ISO, you can visit their website at www.iso.org.
Overview of Project Management 
Now that you’ve learned a bit about business process improvement systems, you can
see that project management can be viewed either as an integral part of these other
systems or as a business process improvement system itself. Regardless of where you
want to place it in the scheme of things, there is hard data to support the premise
that all companies can beneﬁt from implementing project management processes.
Unlike some of the BPI systems, project management fundamentals can be learned
quickly and implemented almost immediately.As with these other systems, there are
many levels of expertise and once you begin learning the basics, you may ﬁnd you
want additional information or formal training to continue to improve your skills
and project results. Now, let’s take a more in-depth look at project management.
We’re going to start with some of the research that’s been done on projects, project
success and failure rates, and how project management can help. If you need to sell
your manager or top executives on why the company should implement project
management or pay for project management training, memorize this next section.

Project Success and Failure Rates
In 1986,Alfred Spector, president of the Transarc Corporation, co-authored a paper
comparing bridge building to software development.The paper stated that bridges
are normally built on time, on budget, and do not fall down. Conversely, software
rarely, if ever, comes in on time or on budget and software almost always breaks.
Spector proposed that bridges come in on time, on budget, and do not fall down
because design detail and speciﬁcations are locked down and the building contractor
has little ﬂexibility in modifying the speciﬁcations. Of course, that and 3,000 years of
collective bridge building experience have something to do with it. Software devel-
opment is a relatively new endeavor in the scheme of things. We don’t have 3,000
years’ experience, more like 60 or 70 years. Like all ﬂedglings, software development
has changed by ﬁts and starts and in many ways is still an awkward toddler—some-
times running at lightning speed and others times stumbling and falling for no
apparent reason.
The world of software development is certainly a bit different than, say,
upgrading the corporate network infrastructure. However, the problems found in
software development projects are pretty common to all kinds of IT projects, so we’ll
examine some data collected by the Standish Group International, Inc. on software
development.
The Standish Group International (Standish Group) began researching the suc-
cess and failure of software projects back in the 1990’s. Since then, they have pub-
lished a report called the CHAOS Report every two years. Each time it’s released, it
contains updated statistics on many different aspects of software projects. What’s
interesting is that the ﬁrst report, reﬂecting 1994 data, indicated that only 16% of all
software development projects succeeded, 31% failed outright and 53% were deemed
“challenged.”The term challenged is used to indicate a project that is running behind
schedule, over cost, or does not contain the original set of required features (reduced
scope or reduced quality). Successful is deﬁned as being on time, on budget, and con-
taining substantially all the required features and functions originally speciﬁed. Only
16% of projects were successful in 1994.
There are a few other noteworthy statistics that drive home the cost of failure. In
1995, U.S. companies spent about $250 billion on software development.The
average cost of a development project in a large company was about $2.3 million.
The average cost in a mid-sized company was about $1.3 million and in small com-
panies, the cost was about $430,000.Those are large numbers, especially for small
companies. Now, let’s do the math. In 1995 dollars, cancelled development projects
cost $81 billion (U.S. companies and government combined). If each software pro-
ject for small companies cost $434,000 and only 16% were successful, think about

the millions of dollars lost by small businesses. Certainly the numbers for large and
mid-sized companies are also signiﬁcant, but small businesses in particular can ill-
afford to waste millions of dollars on failed and challenged projects.
Six years later, in 2000, the Internet boom was in full swing and software startup
companies were a dime a dozen (in retrospect, even at a dime a dozen, many would
now be considered overvalued).You’d think software development would have sig-
niﬁcantly matured with all that time, money, and effort being expended in develop-
ment.According to the Standish Group, in 2000 a whopping 28% of all software
projects were successful. Not a bad improvement for six years, but here’s the bad
news. 23% of all projects still failed and 49% were still challenged. It would be a hard
sell to go into your senior management and say,“Let’s spend $500,000 on this IT
project, it has a 28% chance of success,” but that’s exactly what people do when they
implement projects without a deﬁned project management process.
Now some more bad news: most projects in the successful category (28%) had
inﬂated cost estimates.According to the Standish Group,“IT executives told us that
they get their best estimate, multiply by two and then add a half!” So, projects can
have a 28% success rate if the estimates are roughly tripled.That 28% success rate
sounds like it’s still closer to the 1994 number of 16%, but that IT professionals have
simply gotten better at “guestimating” the true cost of development.The good news
is that through the use of project management processes, all IT projects, including
those pesky software development projects, have a better chance of coming in on
time, on budget, and with the required features and functions. Since you’re reading
this book, it’s assumed that that’s exactly what you want to do and as you read
through the remainder of the book, you’ll gain the knowledge you need to improve
your projects from start to ﬁnish.
The problem is deﬁnitely not just within the software development arena, so
don’t sit comfortably by pointing the ﬁnger at the development folks.As you’ll see
in a moment, there are many organizational factors that contribute to the project
failures (and successes) and it’s everyone’s responsibility to contribute to the success
of the project. Now that we’ve examined the bad news, let’s look at some of the
things companies and IT managers can do to improve the chance for the success of
all IT projects, including software development projects.After all, if there wasn’t
some good news in all of this, we’d be in big trouble.

Enterprise 128…
Too Much, Too Late, Too Bad
Throughout this book, you’ll see these small segments that discuss topics related
to the material in that section. The segments that describe what went wrong
with projects and why are titled “Enterprise 128”. Here’s the story of Enterprise
128 and why it is an apt name for these segments.
In the early 1980’s, a British company was set up to create a home com-
puter just when it appeared home computers might become a viable market. The
computer was based on the Zilog Z80 processor and boasted 128K of memory,
an astounding amount of RAM for that time. It also had ports galore—
RS232/RS432 serial ports, RGB output port, Centronics printer port, two external
joystick ports, a cassette interface, a ROM cartridge slot, and an expansion slot.
It also featured 4-channel stereo sound. Years ahead of its time, it also had a
graphics coprocessor (named “Nick” after one of the designers) and a sound
coprocessor (“Dave”, the other designer) to take some of the load off the Z80
processor. Pretty advanced features for a 1983 product.
The company announced its ﬂagship product, the Enterprise 128, in
September 1983. The units didn’t actually go on sale until the spring of 1984. At
that time, the company was taking pre-orders because the units weren’t actually
ready to ship. The company did manage to pull in 80,000 pre-orders, which at that
time was a pretty good trick given the ﬂedgling home computer market. 
Unfortunately, that’s where the good news ends. The computers,
announced in late 1983, didn’t actually ship until 1985, by which time there were
many more competitors in the market. The competitions’ computers had fewer
features, but were less expensive. Within a couple of years after the release of the
Enterprise 128, the company folded and was lost in space forever. The units that
were eventually built and sold found a market in Hungary and there was a strong
Enterprise 128 contingent there for years.
Lesson Learned: Projects that come in late, over budget, and with features
no one really cares about (or understands) are very likely to fail. The folks of the
Enterprise learned that lesson just a bit too late. For more information on the

Project Success Factors
There are numerous things companies and IT managers can do to increase the
chance of success for any IT project. We’ll look at these success factors in the order
in which they currently impact project success. Over time, these factors tend to shift

positions, but the list itself has remained fairly constant. If you’re trying to make the
case for implementing project management in your company, you may want to pay
special attention to this section. It will provide you with critical data that you can
use to present the case to your senior management team or to convince other stake-
holders in the company of the importance of PM practices. In each of the segments
below, you’ll learn about a different success factor and how you can use or imple-
ment it in your organization. We’ll return to each of these items in later chapters in
the book and provide detailed steps you can take to improve your project outcomes.
Success Factor 1: Executive Support
Executive support is the number one factor impacting project success. Of course,
that probably doesn’t come as much of a surprise. If executives are not supportive,
they’re unlikely to assign needed resources (labor hours, dollars, equipment, etc.) to
the project.Additionally, they’re less likely to defend the project if it runs into
trouble or gets bogged down in corporate politics. Executive support can also help
ensure that cross-functional teams deliver on their assignments, especially when pro-
jects cross departmental and divisional corporate lines. Finally, executive support can
give a project company-wide visibility, which can be good or bad, depending on
how the project turns out.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
As you’ll learn in later chapters, having a project sponsor is important to
project success. Often the project sponsor is an executive in the com-
pany. Your job is to provide that sponsor with accurate, useful, and
appropriate information about what the project will look like, what the
project will cost, how long the project will take, and perhaps most
important, why the project should be undertaken. You can and should
use your team members as resources when compiling project details and
you’ll learn exactly how to do this when we discuss project planning
later in the book. Even if the person that assigned you the project is the
project sponsor, it’s still important for you to provide the information he
or she will need to support and defend your project in the future. You’ll
learn more about this later in this book.

Success Factor 2: User Involvement
The lack of user involvement is number two on the list only because if the project
never gets out of the gates, it won’t succeed, so executive support is the ﬁrst success
factor. However, coming in a close second is lack of user involvement. Here’s what
typically happens: Someone comes up with an idea for a project.A team is put
together to evaluate and implement the project.The project starts up and about
three-quarters of the way through, someone might mention getting the users
trained. In the worst-case (and fairly common) scenario, once the project is com-
plete, it is implemented and dropped on the users. Often user input and training
comes after the fact or not at all. In a better scenario, users are involved in designing
the project and trained sometime before the project goes live. If you’re like most IT
folks, right about now you’re saying “Yes, but….” Read on.
Many IT managers ﬁnd it difﬁcult to involve users early on for two key reasons.
First, users are typically uneducated about IT processes, whether it’s software devel-
opment or infrastructure upgrades. Without understanding how things work in IT,
most users come up with fairly unrealistic expectations about how and when things
should be done.Think of it as a culture clash—each culture (IT and user) is right
within its own sphere, but a lot gets lost in translation. Users’ requirements can
seemingly change from day to day and their understanding of what it takes to get
the job done is limited. If users don’t understand the process, they may inundate IT
with a barrage of questions the IT staff is unprepared (or unable) to answer at that
point in time.To avoid this onslaught of user questions, IT staff often delay commu-
nicating with users.
A second big complaint from the IT department is scope creep—the requirements
for the project keep growing even as the project is underway.The source of this
scope creep is often the user community. On the other side, users complain that they
are left out of the loop until it’s too late to make any meaningful changes to the pro-
ject.As a result, both IT staff and users become frustrated.
From a user perspective, the IT department often comes in, asks a few questions
and months later unveils the new system, application, or solution. Users are not asked
about requirements ahead of time, are often not involved in usability and function-
ality testing, and sometimes are not trained until after the fact.This leads to user
confusion and dissatisfaction.There is a better way. We’ll discuss how to turn users
into allies rather than opponents later in this book.

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Involve users early but through a very well-deﬁned and managed pro-
cess. Look for subject matter experts (SMEs) within various user seg-
ments and work with these user representatives. Set clear expectations
about their participation, and when the requirements are agreed upon,
they should be “etched in stone” to prevent scope creep. Developing
requirements documents is not a simple task and it will take practice to
get your skills where they need to be, but it is well worth the effort.
We’re going to devote a fair amount of discussion to this topic later in
the book because getting users on board with the project early on will
absolutely impact your project’s chance of success. You’ll learn how to
effectively manage user involvement so you don’t get yanked in every
direction, and we’ll discuss speciﬁc methods you can use to gather user
input while managing the project requirements. We’ll discuss scope
creep in more detail when we discuss project planning and change man-
agement later in this book.
Enterprise 128…
Users, Users Everywhere…
The following is a true story. No names are used to protect, well, everyone
involved. A software company was developing an advanced application to
manage ﬁnancial data for non-proﬁt organizations. The target market had been
making do with a handful of homegrown applications built on legacy platforms
(DOS, for example). This new application was going to transform the marketplace
and would be in huge demand, or so went the story. As the ﬁrst couple of beta
customers tested the product, the response was overwhelming. “Where is the
reporting capability?” Didn’t customers notice the new, easy-to-use interface?
No. Didn’t they notice the ease with which they could manage funds from dif-
ferent accounts? No. What they noticed was the one (missing) feature every cus-
tomer had mentioned during customer meetings, focus groups, and surveys:
reporting.
What went wrong? The development team prioritized the bells and whistles
higher than reporting features. In every development meeting, user requirements
(reports) were de-prioritized to make way for either critical ﬁxes or features that

some believed would be a deciding factor in future sales. Though the client side
was represented by two or three lonely voices, there was little support at the top
of the organization for these user requirements. As a result, the engineering
department took their cue from the top and repeatedly de-prioritized the
reporting features.
There is a happy ending. Once engineering focused on getting the users
90% of the reports they needed and wanted, the client’s resistance to the
product melted away and the new application was enthusiastically received in
the marketplace.
Lesson Learned: Find out what the users need and want. Spend time listening,
not talking. Understand how users currently use the technology and discuss what
needs to change. Then, prioritize the items on the user lists. Conﬁrm the required
and optional features with subject matter experts. Make sure you understand what
the “must have” features are and deliver on those. Get agreement from the users
on the ﬁnal list. You may have to negotiate because often you can’t deliver on
everything. It’s better to have 100% of 10 features than 10% of 100 features. Next,
lock down that list. If you need to, shorten the list for the ﬁrst iteration and work
on subsequent priorities in later releases. Although this software company spent
time gathering user input, it never incorporated that into a ﬁrm list of “must have”
user-side requirements, sometimes referred to as acceptance criteria. If they had,
the product probably would have gained traction in the marketplace about 18
months earlier than it did. Not all stories end as happily.
Success Factor 3: Experienced Project Manager
In recent years, it’s become clear that having an experienced project manager at the
helm has a signiﬁcant impact on the success rates of IT projects. In the 1990’s, there
was little call for formally trained (or experienced) project managers only because
project management as a business practice was not as in demand as it is today. While
project management has long been utilized in many large, industrial companies and
governmental agencies, it has now become almost a de facto requirement even in
small and mid-sized companies.The evidence is clear and overwhelming—having a
trained, experienced project manager has an enormous impact on a project’s chance
of success. Experience becomes a more important factor as the project size, cost, and
timeline increase. In fact, according to the Standish Group’s research, 97% of all suc-
cessful projects have an experienced project manager. We’ll discuss the role of project
manager and what skills and traits are important for success as a project manager
later in this book.

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
This data gives you a great selling point if you need to get top manage-
ment to pay for formal project management training for you, your team,
or your company. Even if formal training isn’t on your agenda, you can
get buy-in for assigning strategic projects to the most experienced pro-
ject managers. While that sometimes means shifting in-progress projects
to other project managers, your goal should be to assign your most
complex, strategic, and/or critical projects to your most experienced pro-
ject managers. If you want less experienced project managers to gain
expertise, assign them as team members on important projects and let
them learn from the best. If you’re an experienced project manager,
applying the processes deﬁned in this book will add consistency to your
projects.
Success Factor 4: 
Clearly Deﬁned Project Objectives
For most people familiar with project management, success factor 4 is painfully
obvious. If that’s the case, however, it’s hard to explain why a vast majority of pro-
jects don’t have clearly deﬁned objectives. It’s one of those things like daily exer-
cise—everyone agrees it’s good for you, but it’s just such a nuisance to actually do it.
There are a number of reasons why projects lack deﬁned objectives. Laziness is one
explanation, of course, but not the best one. Most of the time there are numerous
organizational factors including politics, shifting priorities, cash ﬂow/ﬁnancial prob-
lems, extremely tight timelines, and organization restructuring that sometimes make
deﬁning project objectives difﬁcult or impossible. Project objectives essentially deﬁne
the scope of the project.The scope is the total amount of work to be accomplished. If
these are continually changing, it’s like trying to hit a moving target. Later in this
book, we’ll take a close look at objectives and give you speciﬁc tools you can use to
create well-deﬁned project objectives. We’ll also discuss how to get buy-in from
appropriate stakeholders so those objectives don’t shift on you (too much).
www.syngress.com
What’s Project Management Got to Do with IT? • Chapter 1
13

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Clearly deﬁned project objectives comes in at number four on the list of
key success factors. The ﬁrst three success factors have to do with
people—the executives, the users, and the project manager. This is the
ﬁrst factor internal to the project itself that appears on the list and is the
most important project-speciﬁc aspect. Knowing this will help you get all
the stakeholders (anyone impacted by the project or the project’s out-
come) aligned with the project’s objectives. As with other elements, it
may take some negotiating on your part to lock down these details, but
if everyone understands the impact of clearly deﬁned objectives on the
project’s success, you’re more likely to gain agreement on the top-level
items.
Success Factor 5: 
Clearly Deﬁned (and Smaller) Scope
Studies have shown that the longer a project runs (scheduled duration), the less likely
it is to be successful, so there is an inverse relationship between project success and
time. Scope, deﬁned as the total amount of work to be accomplished, is inextricably
linked to time—the more work that needs to be done, the longer it usually will take.
The scope of the project is reﬂected in the project’s objectives. Some IT project
managers prefer to start with objectives to see how those deﬁne the scope; others
prefer to start with the scope and develop the objectives from there. We’ll discuss the
process of deﬁning scope and objectives later.
Clearly, there is only so much that can be accomplished in a given amount of
time. Despite our impulse to throw more bodies at some problems, studies have
shown that in many cases there is an inverse relationship between the number of
people working on the problem and the time it takes to resolve the problem.To put
that in plain English, in some cases the more bodies you throw at a problem, the
longer it will take to ﬁx it.This might explain why you always see six highway con-
struction workers standing around while one guy does all the work…OK, that
might not apply, but how many people can write one section of code or install one
server? You may be familiar with the expression,“a camel is a horse designed by
committee,” which sums up the challenge of having too many people working on
one problem.

Chapter 1 • What’s Project Management Got to Do with IT?

Typically, the only way to reduce the amount of time spent on a project is to
limit the scope of the project. Scheduling efﬁciencies may reduce the timeline, but
rarely reduce the amount of effort required to complete the project tasks. In many
cases, it is worthwhile to break large projects down into smaller, shorter projects.
Smaller projects are more manageable and often give the project manager and pro-
ject team more ﬂexibility with limited resources.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Resist deﬁning or managing big, complex projects. Some people see
these as a chance to make a name for themselves. That’s true, but it
won’t be a name you like when the project fails. If you’re assigned a
large, complex long-running project, try to break it down into smaller
projects (sub-projects or phases) in a manner acceptable to senior man-
agement. Work diligently to deﬁne scope and prevent scope creep. One
method that works is to deﬁne both what the project does and does not
include. When you deﬁne what the project does not include, there’s less
room for confusion about the actual scope of the project. We’ll discuss
this in greater detail later in the book.
Success Factor 6: 
Shorter Schedules, Multiple Milestones
You just read that time is the mortal enemy of project success, so it should come as no
surprise that the next success factor is shorter schedules with more frequent check-
points. Scope deﬁnes the total amount of work to be accomplished and the schedule
deﬁnes the shortest possible path to accomplishing that work. If the schedule starts get-
ting longer, there’s a good chance your scope is creeping on you and that will directly
reduce your chances for success.The schedule is developed based upon the availability
of resources and the skills of those resources.We’ll discuss scheduling and resources
when we look at the planning phase of project management.
Studies have also shown that projects with more milestones placed closer
together are more successful.This also makes sense when you think about it (of
course, most of us just don’t stop and think about it). Milestones, by deﬁnition, are
tasks in your project plan that have no duration.They are simply markers to help
you navigate through your project plan and indicate important checkpoints or
events.They can be project phase transition points; points at which external data,

resources, or decisions must be gathered, or simple checkpoints. It makes sense, then,
that the more often you have a checkpoint, the more successful your project is likely
to be.The sooner you notice the project is heading off-course, the easier it is to
make small adjustments. Of course, all things (including milestones) in moderation—
too many checkpoints and you’ll drive yourself and your team members crazy.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Take a look at the average or typical project length at your company or
within your IT department. Then look at the success rates of those pro-
jects. Since there is no speciﬁc deﬁnition of “short” or “long” duration,
look for the intersection of project duration and project success in your
department. While there are numerous other factors at play, you might be
able to ﬁnd the optimal project duration for your purposes. If not, break
big projects into smaller projects then set shorter schedules with multiple
milestones. We’ll discuss schedules and milestones later in this book.
Success Factor 7: 
Clearly Deﬁned Project Management Process
Has it struck you yet that “more time, more money, more people” are not on the
success factor list? What is on the list includes getting the right people involved and
clearly deﬁning some key project elements. Sound basic? It is, though it is certainly
easier said than done. Having a clearly deﬁned project management process comes in
at number seven on our countdown, but odds are good that if you have an experi-
enced project manager (success factor three), he or she is using a clearly deﬁned PM
process already. If that describes you, hang on. We’ll discuss that process and ways
you can improve your own PM methods throughout this book.
A clearly deﬁned project management process is important for project success for
several reasons. First, when processes are clearly deﬁned, you avoid reinventing the
wheel each time and you can re-use processes that worked and tweak those that
didn’t. Over time, this leads to improved processes that can easily be implemented by
members of the project team.Also, clearly deﬁned processes reduce or eliminate
some of the project re-work.Think about the last time you went to the hardware or
grocery store. If you had a list, you had close to a 100% chance you’d leave the store
with all the items you needed. On the other hand, if you didn’t have a list, you had
close to a 100% chance that you’d leave the store without something you did need

and with several things you really didn’t need.The same holds true in project man-
agement. Having well-deﬁned project management processes helps you do the right
things in the right order without having to give too much thought to the process.
There’s also an efﬁciency that comes with having well-deﬁned, easy-to-use pro-
cesses. If the process by which you got paid by your employer changed each pay
period, imagine the confusion it would cause.The time wasted tracking down
missing paychecks and responding to frantic or irate employees would take far more
time than the payroll department could handle. Instead, there is a consistent process
and everyone knows not only when and how paychecks are distributed, but they
also know what to do in the event a paycheck is missing.
Before we leave this topic, let’s make one thing perfectly clear. Process for pro-
cess’ sake is a waste of time. We’re going to focus on simple, easy-to-use processes
that actually make your job easier.The processes in this book are excellent tools for
managing your project, not excellent ways to waste more of your valuable time.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
First, you can use this information to generate buy-in for using a project
management process. Some companies are more reluctant than others
to implement new processes or systems. However, using the information
in this chapter, you should be able to create a compelling case for using
project management. Also, once you’ve read through this book, you’ll
be able to develop clearly deﬁned project management processes for
your department or team. You’ll then be able to implement and modify
the project management processes your IT team uses to reﬂect the
unique needs of your situation. You should learn the process from start
to ﬁnish before you decide to modify anything, but once you have a
good feel for the processes, feel free to tweak them to suit your com-
pany’s needs and business methods.

Cheat Sheet…
What Projects Really Cost
It’s been estimated that 50% to 75% of the total cost of any project is directly
attributable to errors, omissions, and re-work. Think about that for a moment. A
project that’s estimated to cost $500,000 will cost almost $1,000,000 or more
and all of the difference is probably directly related to errors, omissions, and re-
work. While having well-deﬁned project management processes won’t prevent
all project problems, if you could reduce errors and re-work by half, you’d save
25% to 38% of the total cost of the project. 
Here’s another estimate related speciﬁcally to software development. It
costs approximately 100 times more to ﬁx a software problem after the product
has been released to customers than it does to ﬁx the problem during the devel-
opment phase. Clearly, cost savings (and numerous other beneﬁts) come from
testing and quality processes built into the project management process so prob-
lems and errors are detected and resolved early. 
The best part of the deal is this: if you implement these processes and
reduce errors, omissions, and re-work, you not only reduce the total cost of your
project, you also probably reduce the time it takes to complete the project and
deliver higher quality as well. There aren’t too many free rides in life, but this is
one of them. We’ll discuss these processes in detail throughout the remainder of
this book.
Success Factor 8: Standard Infrastructure
The last major success factor we’ll discuss is using standard software infrastructure.
Clearly, this applies directly to software development initiatives, but it can also be
applied to other IT projects.According to the Standish Group research, 70% of all
application code is considered infrastructure, which means that the other 30% is the
custom code. Standardizing the infrastructure of the code’s foundation leads to both
efﬁciency and stability in the code. Some of the infrastructure code is unique to the
application, but often there are components that can be purchased from an infrastruc-
ture vendor to alleviate the need to develop unique infrastructure solutions. Relying
on off-the-shelf infrastructure components increases the chance the development pro-
ject will come in on time, on budget, and with required features. Developers can focus
on the competitive or strategic elements of the code (what separates your product
from your competitors) instead of developing the infrastructure.
www.syngress.com
18
Chapter 1 • What’s Project Management Got to Do with IT?

If you’re not developing software, this success factor still applies to you. Projects
that use standard infrastructure components are more likely to be successful. Most IT
pros who work on the hardware end of things will tell you that things almost always
work better when the infrastructure components are standardized on particular plat-
forms and even with particular vendors. Mixing and matching often creates compati-
bility issues that hardware folks hate to chase down. Standardizing the infrastructure
used in your project, regardless of where in the IT world your project falls, will gen-
erate greater success.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
When developing your project plan, look for opportunities to use stan-
dardized components—from software infrastructure elements to hard-
ware infrastructure elements to templates and off-the-shelf solutions.
Carefully analyze the cost of purchasing infrastructure versus creating
your own. Small and medium-sized companies often fall victim to the “it
costs too much” mentality when looking at off-the-shelf solutions to
incorporate into their products or projects. However, if you add in the
cost of errors, omission, re-work, and cost and schedule overruns, you’ll
more than likely ﬁnd that purchasing these components or elements is a
better business decision—even if it costs you more initially than you
expected. When we look at developing a project budget, we’ll discuss
how to evaluate some of these items.
The IT Factor…
Using Standard Components
Remember the software company that ran into trouble because it lacked the
reports customers required? A missed opportunity was to purchase a report
engine and incorporate it into the product. At the time, the company was tight on
funds, as are many startups, and top executives made the decision that developing
the code for reports would be more cost effective than purchasing a report
engine. On the surface, that appeared to be true when you look at the cost of that
kind of component. However, there are a number of things they did not

Continued

consider. For instance, how many programmer hours did it take to develop these
reports? How much expertise did the programmers have in developing reports
versus a company whose business it is to develop and sell a report engine? How
likely or possible would it be to continue to upgrade and improve the reporting
functions as technology changed? What was the opportunity cost of developing
those reports in-house (meaning, what did those programmers NOT work on
because they were busy developing reports)? Finally, what sales/marketing beneﬁt
(if any) would there be to using a well-known, widely used report engine? Had
these factors been considered, it’s possible the company may have chosen to use
a standard report engine, despite the high initial price tag. There are times using
standardized components makes sense and there are times when it does not. The
key is to clearly deﬁne objectives, identify alternatives, evaluate the feasibility
(including cost, risk, etc.) of each alternative and implement the best solution.
We’ll discuss identifying departmental strengths and weaknesses in Chapter 2 and
evaluating alternatives in later chapters.
Four Project Constraints
Before we move on, let’s look at the four project constraints. Don’t confuse this with
task constraints, which is a separate matter altogether.The project constraints are
scope, time, cost, and quality (quality is sometimes referred to a functionality, performance,
or features).They’re often written as a formula to denote the relationship between the
elements.You typically can’t take these four elements and perform a mathematical
calculation on them based on the formula, but it does describe the relationship
between these elements:
Scope = Time x Cost x Quality
Let’s deﬁne each term here.
■
Scope Previously, we deﬁned scope as the total amount of work to be
accomplished in the project. Scope is often deﬁned both by what will and
will not be done in the project. Deﬁning what will not be accomplished
can be a great reality check for all involved.
■
Time Time clearly is the total amount of time the project will take.As
mentioned earlier, there is a direct relationship between scope and time—
the more you want to get done, the longer it will usually take.
■
Cost Cost is the cost of the project including all direct and indirect costs.
www.syngress.com
20
Chapter 1 • What’s Project Management Got to Do with IT?

■
Quality or Performance Quality is sometimes a confusing term. It typi-
cally refers to the features of the project or the performance requirements.
Quality is often sacriﬁced when projects get behind schedule or sideways
with their funding. Quality is also reduced when there are errors, omis-
sions, and re-work due to poor project planning. Both scope (how much
gets done) and quality (how well the project meets expectations or require-
ments) are reduced when one or more required or desired features are not
included in the ﬁnal project deliverables.
The relationship describes how these elements are related because if you increase
the scope, either intentionally or via the insidious scope creep, you will have to
modify at least one of the three elements on the other side of the equal sign. For
instance, if you want to increase scope, you will either have to spend more time or
more money (or both) to accomplish the additional work.Alternately, if you increase
scope and you cannot increase the time or cost, you will most likely have to reduce
the quality. If a project is set to go and you’re suddenly told you must do the project
for 30% less money or in 20% less time, something has to change.The relationship
among these elements is important to understand and we’ll spend time working on
this concept and give you speciﬁc tools to use.
Here’s a corollary to that concept—you cannot initially deﬁne all four variables.
If you were to randomly select four numbers—10, 2, 4, 9—and plug them into this
equation, it won’t work.You need to have one or more variables to make the equa-
tion work with the other randomly selected numbers. In this case, we’ll use 10, 2, 4
and y. Now, if you try to make the equation work, you solve for y and you can
always solve the equation, regardless of what those three numbers are.The same
holds true for the relationship between scope, time, cost, and quality.You can’t deﬁne
all four at the front end of the project and expect that the project will succeed
(achieve all four metrics).There is a very high likelihood that it won’t.
Often when you’re handed a project, you’re told what to accomplish (scope), how
quickly you must complete it (time), what the budget will be (cost) and what features
the project must include (quality).That’s the best recipe for project disaster ever
devised and yet it’s done every day in companies all over the world. It’s important to
note that we’re talking about projects that are just dropped in your lap with these
four parameters deﬁned for you without any research or planning behind the num-
bers. If the project has been thought through and experienced subject matter experts
have worked to develop these four parameters, it is possible you might hit these
numbers.As the project manager, your job is to do the planning that will allow you
to more accurately deﬁne all four elements. Once those are deﬁned and the project
begins, those are the metrics you’re going to try to meet. Once you’ve planned your

project, it is not only possible to deﬁne all four elements, it’s expected. Later in this
book, we’ll look at these elements and how to negotiate so that at least one becomes
your “variable” so you actually can solve your project equation and how to develop
these four variables when you’re in the planning phase of your project.
Projects, Programs, and Portfolios
Projects are discrete efforts that deﬁne and deliver a single result such as a software
release or a hardware upgrade. Many companies have multiple projects underway at
any given point in time. Collectively, these projects are referred to as programs.
Program management is the management of multiple projects that share resources,
tools, time, and talent. Portfolios are collections of projects and/or programs, and in
large companies, portfolio management is a major undertaking.There’s been
increasing talk about portfolio management in the IT arena, so you may want to
research this topic further if you work in a large company that’s likely to have a
Program or Portfolio Management Ofﬁce. Companies are also starting to create
Program (or Portfolio) Management Ofﬁces and appoint Program (Portfolio)
Management Ofﬁcers.As you can see, you can drown in the alphabet soup of
acronyms. Don’t worry about the letters, just be sure to watch developments both in
your company and in the larger market so you stay up-to-date with the latest trends
and initiatives in your industry.
The IT Factor…
Portfolio Management—What’s All The Buzz About?
A January 2005 article by Dean Meyer in CIO Magazine explains portfolio man-
agement in the IT arena in this manner: “In IT circles, portfolio management is
being used to describe a wide range of initiatives, from project-approval pro-
cesses to project management methods and tools.” While your IT department
may not be that large or you may not be CIO (yet), you might beneﬁt from
reading up on this emerging trend in the IT ﬁeld. You can ﬁnd the CIO Magazine

portfolio management is big business aimed primarily at IT projects. As IT depart-
ments have to evaluate, plan, and implement a wider and wider range of pro-
jects, portfolio project management will likely gain in importance. Today, unlike
even ﬁve or ten years ago, IT has to contend with supply chain management
(SCM) including procurement and distribution applications; enterprise resource
planning (ERP) including operations and ﬁnance applications; and customer rela-
tionship management (CRM) including sales, marketing and customer service
applications. It has to deal with infrastructure, security, and e-commerce issues
as well. With IT now reaching into every corner of the organization and touching
almost every business process, new methods are needed to effectively manage
the entire range of projects. Project portfolio management may be the next best
thing since sliced bread, but only time will tell if it reaches its promised potential.

Chapter 1 • What’s Project Management Got to Do with IT?
Summary
Businesses are looking for any competitive advantage they can ﬁnd and IT depart-
ments are looking to squeeze more productivity out of the same (or fewer) budget
dollars.As a result, there have been renewed efforts to improve business processes.
Business process improvement (BPI) is a broad category that includes methodologies
such as CMM, CMMI, Six Sigma, ISO9000, and more. Project management ﬁts well
into the category of business process improvement because standard project manage-
ment methodologies can be applied to any type of project in any business or industry.
While the particular processes may be further reﬁned or speciﬁed by broader business
process improvement systems, project management is a great starting point.
As you learned in this chapter, there are eight fundamental success factors for
any project. It’s important to understand these success factors because if they’re
missing, your project has an increased chance of failure. Successful projects may not
have all eight success factors present, but the more you have, the better your chance
of success.As you review the projects you already have in progress, you can see
which are on track and which are at risk, then review the success factors. Chances
are good you’ll ﬁnd those projects that are at risk are missing one or more of the
eight key success factors.
We also introduced the relationship of the four project constraints—scope, time,
cost, and quality.You may have already looked at your current IT projects and dis-
covered the relationship between these elements.You may have seen that when you
were asked to include six more features, you had to extend the timeline to accom-
modate for that change.You may have realized that when your budget was cut by
20%, you had to go back and re-negotiate the amount of work you were going to
include in the project.As you become more familiar with these concepts, you’ll have
some excellent tools to more effectively negotiate project details with stakeholders.
We’ll discuss this in greater detail later, but you can ponder these relationships in
past, current, and upcoming projects in the meantime.
Project, program, and portfolio management are buzzwords you may have heard
about recently.They’re gaining popularity and it’s good to be familiar with trends
and terminology that impact your job and industry.

Overview of Business Process Improvement Systems
 Companies are implementing business process improvement systems in
order to gain efﬁciencies and competitive advantage.
 Project management ﬁts into business process improvement by improving
the manner in which projects of all kinds are managed.
 The Project Management Institute has developed the Project Management
Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), which is widely accepted as the standard
for project management practices.
 CMM and CMMI are software process improvement methodologies
speciﬁed by Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute.
 Six Sigma is a business process improvement program that has its roots in
Motorola quality problems in the 1970’s and was evangelized by Jack
Welch, former CEO of General Electric.
 Six Sigma lacks a centrally managed set of speciﬁcations and certiﬁcation
authority.
 ISO speciﬁcations pertain to different industries and different business
arenas.The current ISO9001:2000 is primarily concerned with business to
business dealings and the ISO 14000 speciﬁcation has to do with
environmental impact.
Overview of Project Management 
 Software development projects are successful about 28% of the time.
 50%-75% of the total cost of any project is due to errors, omissions, and re-
work.
 Errors found early are less expensive and easier to ﬁx than those found by
the customer.
 Eight success factors have been identiﬁed. Projects that have these factors
tend to be more successful than those lacking these success factors.
 Executive support, user involvement, and experienced project managers are
the ﬁrst three success factors and all involve people.

Chapter 1 • What’s Project Management Got to Do with IT?
 The remaining ﬁve success factors involve processes: clear objectives, smaller
scope, shorter schedules with more milestones, clearly deﬁned project
management processes, and standard infrastructure.
Four Project Constraints
 There is a relationship between project scope, time, cost, and quality. If any
one element changes, it changes the equation.
 Projects are often assigned with all four elements speciﬁed without any
supporting research. When this occurs, the project team must work to
validate the assumptions or negotiate changes.
 Be prepared to respond to changes in any of the constraints by practicing
good PM skills and ensuring the project sponsor is aware of the change and
how it will impact the other constraints and the project as a whole.
Projects, Programs, Portfolios
 Multiple projects are often referred to as programs. Portfolios are corporate-
level collections of project or programs.
 Large companies often use program and portfolio management to balance
competing demands for resources including time, talent, and funding.
 Portfolio management is currently a popular buzzword in IT and should be
on your professional radar screen.

Q: If I have a green belt in Six Sigma, do I need project management training?
A: Six Sigma is a business process improvement system that is implemented
slightly differently at each company you go to. Project management is similar
in that while there is a standard body of knowledge, PM is implemented
slightly differently every place you go. Having a strong understanding of pro-
ject management fundamentals will help you no matter what job or industry
you end up working in and you’ll ﬁnd that, like Six Sigma, project manage-
ment fundamentals will improve everything you do—even projects at home
or in your community. It’s a portable and transferable skill set that’s deﬁnitely
worth getting.
Q: My company has just achieved ISO9001:2000 certiﬁcation. Do I need pro-
ject management training?
A: ISO9000 is another rigorous business process improvement methodology.
Unlike Six Sigma, ISO standards are centrally managed and archived.
ISO9000 standards are the same wherever you go. However, just as with Six
Sigma, you can always beneﬁt from understanding project management fun-
damentals. Standards in companies are sometimes applied only to develop-
ment or manufacturing processes. Being able to implement a consistent
project management methodology is certainly part of business process
improvement even if it’s outside the scope of the BPI methodology your
company is using.
Q: If I learn the project management fundamentals in this book, will I have to
learn someone else’s system later on?
A: No.The project management fundamentals in this book are just that—the
fundamentals found in any project management system.Though the termi-
nology or speciﬁc implementation will change from company to company

(and from project management system to project management system), once
you know and understand the basics, you can build on that knowledge and
adapt to any system that your company uses.
Q: We have no executive support for many of our IT projects. What can we do
about that?
A: As you learned in this chapter, executive support both for a project manage-
ment methodology and for the IT projects you undertake is critical for pro-
ject success. In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to make the business case
for your projects by tying them into strategic corporate initiatives and by
providing various business analyses that will have your top executives ready to
sign on the dotted line and ready to support your initiatives.
Q: I’ve run a lot of projects in the past, some have failed, some have been can-
celled, and some have been successful. Does that make me an “experienced”
project manager even if I have no formal training?
A: Experience takes many forms, so yes, you probably are an experienced pro-
ject manager (project success factor #3).After reading through this book, you
might want to review some of your successful and failed projects and see
what went right and what went wrong in light of your new knowledge.This
will help you improve your skills and provide you excellent material for your
next job interview, should you apply for a new position using your experi-
ence as a project manager. Using the information presented in the remainder
of this book will supplement your skills and ﬁll in gaps. It will also provide
you with a thorough, systematic process to use if you don’t already have one.
Q: The projects at our company are large and complex. Will the project man-
agement fundamentals in this book be of any use?
A: Absolutely. For instance, in this chapter alone you’ve learned that smaller pro-
jects, shorter time frames (schedules), and smaller scope (amount of work to
be done) all contribute to project success.You might take this knowledge and
see if you can divide up any of your current projects—perhaps looking for
projects that are off-track and seemingly headed for disaster, failure, or cancel-
lation. Splitting them into smaller projects might save those precarious pro-
jects and make you look good in the process. Even if you can’t split up your
projects, understanding these fundamentals will allow you to understand any
other, more complex projects. Larger, more complex projects typically have

Chapter 1 • What’s Project Management Got to Do with IT?

more “moving parts” and are more difﬁcult to coordinate and manage.You
may need more advanced project tools to keep everything on track, but the
basics don’t change.
Q: You mentioned the four constraints of any project—scope, time, cost, and
quality. In our company, quality is always of utmost importance, how does
that impact this “equation”?
A: Any company in business today should be concerned with delivering the
highest quality possible. However, quality can be relative. If you are building a
house and your budget gets tight, you might choose polished brass ﬁxtures
over 18K gold plated ﬁxtures.They both do exactly the same thing and may
work exactly alike (same functional quality) but one isn’t quite as luxurious as
the other and by downgrading from gold to brass, you have reduced quality
without impacting the overall quality of the ﬁnished product. Note that
quality is sometimes referred to as performance, functionality, or features. When
we discuss quality and grade later in this book, we’ll talk more about this.
Q: Our company is small and we have a very tight IT budget.You haven’t really
talked about project management software tools.Are we going to have to
purchase something like that in order to use the concepts in this book?
A: No, you will not have to purchase project management tools to learn and use
the concepts in this book. Many companies (and IT managers) ﬁnd these
tools helpful, but they are not required.That said, the bigger and more com-
plex the project is, the more likely you are to see signiﬁcant savings and efﬁ-
ciency gains by using various PM tools.There are numerous Web-based tools
you can use, many with reasonably monthly subscription rates. Several enable
collaboration for geographically disbursed teams, while others provide addi-
tional communication tools. However, if you’re running smaller projects, you
can do so with a pen and paper, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook, Lotus
Notes, etc. While those may not be optimal, they’re certainly adequate for
many smaller projects. One ﬁnal note: Having project management software
doesn’t make you a project manager any more than having Microsoft Excel
makes you an accountant. Learning project management fundamentals is the
ﬁrst step to using any project management tool more productively and 
effectively.

Introduction
Many IT professionals look back on the 1990’s as “the good old days.” Money was
ﬂowing like water from an endless fountain and IT increasingly was viewed as the
Holy Grail of business.Within a year or two of the dawning of the new millennium,
things took a distinct turn for the worse, especially if you were in the IT ﬁeld.All of
those promising startup companies wilted as that endless fountain of venture capital
and IPO proﬁts ran dry. Reality set in and irrational exuberance gave way to rational
moderation, which left many IT departments caught in a bind. During the late 1990’s,
they couldn’t deliver on some of these pie in the sky dreams and they couldn’t ﬁnd
enough qualiﬁed people to help them meet demand. Once the boom went bust, just
the opposite was true. IT was asked to deliver more with less—less staff, less funding,
and fewer resources.The tables had turned completely in just a few short years.
Many IT departments are facing cutbacks and outsourcing. In order to remain
competitive, IT departments must add value to companies. If the IT department is
seen as a cost center or a utility function, it’s likely not going to get the funding, the
resources, or the support needed to be truly effective. If all you want to do is main-
tain the corporate network and provide 99% uptime, then you may not need to
worry about strategy. If you’re interested in taking your department, your company,
and your career to the next level, you’ll need to begin to understand and contribute
to the larger corporate vision. Strategy is the road that will take you there. If you’re
anxious to get right into the heart of IT project management, you can head right
into Chapter 5, but do so with caution.These ﬁrst four chapters lay the foundation
for IT project management by helping you understand the environment that sur-
rounds all IT projects. By understanding the environment, you’ll be better prepared
to deﬁne, plan, implement, and manage any project that comes your way.
Overview of Corporate 
Strategy in Today’s Environment
If you’re an avid reader of online IT news, blogs, etc., you may have read a lot in the
past year or so about “aligning IT with corporate strategies.”That concept is well-
intended, but stops just short of the target. Certainly, any IT department out-of-step
with its company’s strategies is in jeopardy, but the issue is deeper and wider than
that.The issue is not simply whether or not IT aligns with corporate strategies or
not, but how IT initiatives can drive (or at least contribute to) corporate strategies
and perhaps provide competitive advantage.That’s a slightly different take on the
current alignment discussion, but in order for IT to be seen as a valued-added com-
www.syngress.com
32
Chapter 2 • What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT?

ponent of the business, it has to do more than jump in line with the corporate
strategies (though, admittedly, that alone would be a big improvement for some).
From a corporate viewpoint, it’s fair to say that if your IT initiatives are not aligned
with your business initiatives, your company will be in serious trouble within a few
years.Technology is increasingly an integral part of the business environment. How
well and how fast your ﬁrm can implement technology to drive efﬁciency is what
will separate companies.Technology touches every part of the business today. Not
only are internal functions dependent upon technology, but increasingly, customers
want to reach directly into your company to get the data they want or need. It used
to be that the customer might call you and ask for information on ﬁnancial transac-
tions for the previous quarter. Now the customer wants to be able to log into a
secure server and grab the information in real time. Couple that with the fact that
the lone employee in a remote part of the world needs to be just as connected as
those at corporate headquarters and you begin to understand not only how perva-
sive technology has become, but also how integral it is to the company’s success.
In this chapter, we’re going to explore these issues so you can navigate through
the sometimes confusing world of corporate strategies and ultimately, corporate IT
funding. If you’re not a business or ﬁnance type person or you think this topic is
really boring, then this chapter is a must-read for you.The information presented
will make you smarter about how companies work without boring the daylights out
of you.
The IT Factor…
Fast-Track to CIO
The April 2005 issue of CIO Insight Magazine presented the ﬁndings of a research
study on the role of the CIO. Although a large percentage of CIOs still come from
a strictly IT background, there’s been an increase in recent years in CIOs with
what the study calls a “hybrid” background - people who have experience in both
IT and business. Not surprisingly, these hybrid CIOs are more likely to be in charge
of or involved in corporate strategy. They are more conﬁdent that they have
enough business experience to do their jobs well and they earn, on average, 9%
more than their counterparts. Women with a combination IT and business back-
ground are 15% more likely than their female IT counterparts to move into the
CIO position, though women still account for only 9% of all CIOs out there.
Hybrid CIOs are found in small, medium, and large companies in equal measure.

Aligning IT with Corporate 
Strategy: Taking It One Step Further
Much has been written about aligning IT activities with corporate strategy.That is a
good ﬁrst step, but not the whole answer.Aligning IT with corporate strategy can
imply a passive role—the company charts its course and the IT department, the
ready second mate, steps up and says,“I’m behind you 100%.”Always nice to have
that support, but what about the scenario where the IT department actually con-
tributes to developing the corporate strategy? That’s taking it one step further. In this
chapter, we’ll discuss ways you can work on contributing to corporate strategy, but
we ﬁrst need to understand what the current environment is like.
Many IT departments today are realizing they must run as other departments do
in the organization. More and more, IT departments are being held accountable for
metrics and budgets; some are charging IT costs to internal corporate departments
to account for IT expenditures; some are comparing internal costs to outsourcing
costs to determine where savings can be gleaned.Though IT departments are begin-
ning to use standard business tools and metrics, there’s still work to do in this area.
Here are some interesting statistics from 2002 (according to The Business of I.T.
Portfolio Management: Balancing Risk, Innovation and ROI, Meta Group White Paper,
January 2002):
■
89% of companies are ﬂying blind, with virtually no IT metrics in place
except for ﬁnance.
■
84% of companies either do not do business cases for any of their IT pro-
jects or do them only on select, key projects.
■
84% of companies are unable to adjust and align their IT budgets with
business needs more than once or twice a year.
Given the lackluster success rates for projects (discussed in Chapter 1), you can
see that making sure IT efforts are, at minimum, aligned with corporate strategies is

Chapter 2 • What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT?

important—the statistics clearly show there is ample room for improvement. By
working actively to create this alignment (and we’re going to take it one step further
later in the chapter), you can:
■
Maximize the value of your company’s IT investments while minimizing
the risk (hint: corporate executives usually prefer to avoid risk whenever
possible).
■
Reduce or eliminate redundancy in IT projects.
■
Schedule corporate and IT resources more efﬁciently.
■
Better integrate the IT function into the company so the mentality shifts
from “us versus them” to “all of us.”
■
Improve the business skills of the IT team and improve the understanding
of IT in the business teams.
In this economic climate, IT departments are being required to deliver more with
less. CIOs and IT departments are being asked (or required) to demonstrate a return
on technology investments.Yet, looking at the statistics cited earlier, that’s a difﬁcult
task. So how do we bridge the gap? Part of the answer is looking at how corporate
strategy and operations interact so you can begin to line things up. Once you’ve started
to align with corporate strategy, you may ﬁnd opportunities to take it a step further
and actually help drive corporate strategy. Once strategies are deﬁned, you create your
operational plan, which includes all of your IT projects and other operations.Yes, these
are ambitious objectives, but if you don’t stretch, you’ll never grow.
Strategy Versus Tactical
Let’s take a moment to discuss the difference between strategy and operations.A
strategy is a high-level vision of where the company is headed.Typically it describes
where it’s headed, not how it will get there.The where (and sometimes why) is the
strategic component.The how is the operational, or tactical, component. In this
chapter, we’ll use the terms operational and tactical interchangeably. Even though
they’re not exactly synonymous, they describe the ongoing operations and methods
used to achieve strategic goals. For example, if you say that you want to go to Santa
Fe, NM, clearly that’s the where. It does not describe how you’re going to get there.
You could drive a car, take a bus, take a train, walk, ride a bicycle, take a plane, or
even some combination.These are all various ways that describe how you’ll meet
your objective. It’s important to make this distinction because as soon as you start
describing how you’ll get something done, you’ve moved into the operational or tac-
tical realm. When trying to deﬁne strategy, continually check to make sure you’re

describing what must be done or where you’re headed. Figure 2.1 depicts the ideal
relationship between strategies and operations in an organization.
Figure 2.1 Corporate and IT Strategies
Competitive Advantage
During the heady dot-com days of the late 1990’s, there were opportunities to use
technology to develop competitive advantages because not all companies were able
to implement technology-based solutions with equal ﬁnesse or speed. Largely
because of the dot-com boom, technology as a business tool became a de facto or
required element in all businesses.Today, just about every company—small, medium
and large—uses technology in some form or another. Some small companies may
just have one or two computers running e-mail, an Internet browser, and ofﬁce
applications (word processing, spreadsheets, etc.). Medium and large companies must
have a computer network, and employees must have e-mail and Internet access at
minimum. In most cases, a wide variety of business applications must also be
deployed and maintained. It’s reasonable, then, to state that technology by itself no
longer provides any meaningful competitive advantage because all companies are
using IT to some extent.
That said, there are opportunities to develop competitive advantages within the
IT arena. Let’s look at three key opportunities for creating competitive advantage
using technology.

Execution and Efﬁciency
How well a company is able to execute its strategic and operational plans can be a
distinct competitive advantage.Any company that can gain signiﬁcant efﬁciency in
operational execution will likely beat out its competitors—until their competitors
learn how to replicate those results.Technology can often be a key element in cre-
ating those operational efﬁciencies. Here’s a great example.There was a time when
the only way to get a letter across the country was by putting a ﬁrst class stamp on it
and popping it in the mail (U.S. Postal Service).Then one day, a company named
Federal Express (FedEx) proposed something more radical—if you were willing to
pay approximately 30 times the cost of a ﬁrst class stamp, they would get your letter
to the recipient overnight, guaranteed.They could do this because they’d imple-
mented technology that allowed them to track every single package at every single
stop.At a moment’s notice, they could tell you exactly where that package was and
when it would be delivered or the time of delivery and recipient’s name.That’s a
great example of operational efﬁciency through technology. It was a distinct compet-
itive advantage for a while—that is, until the increased use of e-mail and the imple-
mentation of similar technologies at companies like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service
(among others).At that point, the competitive advantage shifted away from the tech-
nology itself to the ability of the company to expertly utilize that technology more
effectively than its competitors—that’s where execution and improved business pro-
cesses play a role. It’s possible that one company may still have a better technology
implementation than the others, but if they all are using a similar technology, it
comes down to who can utilize that technology more effectively.And as we all
know, technology doesn’t stand still, so the continued opportunity is to expand and
reach into new areas with the same or new technology.
Efﬁciency gains through the effective use of technology may create a competi-
tive advantage, but that type of competitive advantage is often short-lived.Today,
there are a number of express delivery services all using some sort of tracking and
routing technology solutions. How well they fare is now more a result of how well
they utilize, manage, and leverage that technology rather than the technology itself.
Leveraging Technology to Lower Costs
As we’ve seen repeatedly in the past ﬁve or ten years, technology can clearly be used
to lower costs and create a competitive advantage.Again, sometimes this advantage is
short-lived, other times it has a longer shelf life.To continue the previous example,
FedEx had an interesting proposition—pay us a lot more for the security of knowing
your letter will arrive tomorrow. Companies were willing to pay a lot more for the
ability to know exactly where an important package or document was at any given
www.syngress.com
What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT? • Chapter 2
37

time.As e-mail became more ubiquitous, companies discovered that e-mailing a docu-
ment was faster, cheaper, and just as reliable as FedEx.Those companies leveraged tech-
nology to lower certain shipping costs. Did companies stop shipping things? No, there
were still documents (and everything else imaginable) crisscrossing the globe in the
belly of express delivery airplanes, but the number of letters it carried certainly may
have dropped with the advent of e-mail. Of course, people have now become so
accustomed to “instant” everything that express delivery companies are often used
when a plain old stamp would do just ﬁne, but that’s another story altogether.
Major cost-cutting initiatives in recent years have also driven the expectation
that technology should be leveraged to lower costs. Initiatives such as Total Cost of
Ownership (TCO) have forced IT departments to look at how the very technology
they’re using can cost even less, so it’s a double spiral: using technology to lower
costs, lowering the cost of using technology. It is a prevalent trend and one that’s not
likely to change anytime soon.
Innovation
Innovation using technology can lead to a competitive advantage. Depending on the
nature of the innovation, that competitive advantage can be short- or long-term.An
example of a short-term advantage is the Web-based retailers who in the late 1990’s
were able to deliver easy, secure online shopping for consumers.Amazon clearly got
a running start and deﬁned some of the standards for e-commerce used today.
However, some of the technological innovations were replicated and some of the
competitive advantage of technological innovation was reduced or eliminated.
Amazon continues to look for ways to leverage technology to gain efﬁciency in exe-
cution and leverage technology to reduce costs knowing that its competitors will
copy (or attempt to copy) its technology innovations.
Another excellent example is Netﬂix, the online movie rental company.They
went head-to-head with bricks-and-mortar outﬁts like Blockbuster.Their innovative
strategy used the Internet for movie renters to look for and reserve movies.They
used the old-fashioned U.S. mail service to deliver movies right to the movie renter’s
door, which oddly enough, was an innovative idea.They used technology to manage
their regional distribution centers to make sure that it took no more than 2 days to
get a movie from any distribution center to the customer. Innovation using a mix-
ture of approaches and technologies gave Netﬂix a signiﬁcant competitive advantage.
It took about 18 months before Wal-Mart and Blockbuster, among others, tried to
compete with Netﬂix. While the jury is still out on how Netﬂix will fare, Wal-Mart
recently announced they were handing over their movie rental business to Netﬂix to
manage for them. Wal-Mart with all its technological savvy perhaps realized Netﬂix

had the technology and the operational know-how that Wal-Mart wanted. Rather
than ﬁght them, Wal-Mart clearly decided to join them.The innovative use of tech-
nology provided a distinct competitive advantage to Netﬂix for a few years.As the
innovative technology and technology-driven processes are copied, Netﬂix will need
to focus on execution, efﬁciencies and costs to maintain a competitive advantage.
There may be other examples you can think of where technology provides a
competitive advantage to a company, but chances are good that those examples ulti-
mately ﬁt into one of the three categories just mentioned.The expectation that
technology itself will create the competitive advantage has been mostly relegated to
the category of “short-term advantage”, but the current expectation is that tech-
nology can and should help drive corporate efﬁciencies and lower costs.
With that as the backdrop, then, it’s clear that your IT projects will have to meet
one (or a combination) of these expectations.As you select IT projects for your
department to undertake, these elements should be kept ﬁrmly in the forefront.
However, as you’ll see in a moment, you can take it one step further.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Understanding the expectations for technology and the IT department in
your company, in the industry, and in the market is critical in today’s
environment. The more you understand these requirements, the better
chance you have of keeping your IT department (and your career) on the
right track. Most of us don’t want to just sit back and go along for the
ride, especially when there are new and exciting technologies right
around the corner that can make a huge difference in the ways compa-
nies do business. Many IT pros are in this ﬁeld for just that reason—to
be on the cutting edge of technology and to be part of the evolutionary
(sometimes revolutionary) process.
Take time to understand how technology is viewed and implemented
in your company and in your competitors as well. It will give you some
idea of where the competitive advantage is and where it might be
headed. It’s all about competitive advantage and you and your IT
department can make a meaningful contribution.
At the conclusion of Chapter 1, we brieﬂy touched on the concept of portfolio
management. Portfolio management is the management of all IT projects in the
company and the alignment and allocation of resources for those projects. It’s the
latest in a long line of attempts to quantify, measure, and evaluate the contribution

IT makes to an organization. Other departments, like sales, marketing, and produc-
tion more clearly contribute to the company’s bottom line. On the other hand, IT is
often viewed as a ﬁnancial “black hole”, a necessary evil, or the source of the latest
electronic gadgets. In some cases, IT is seen as a solid business partner providing
“utility” services such as e-mail, Internet connectivity, and business application sup-
port. In rare cases, IT is seen as a strategic component of the business, but our goal
in this chapter is to catalyze change in that area so your IT efforts can become more
strategic in nature. Many IT projects are all about “keeping the lights on” and have
no clear value proposition.Think of it this way: When you hire an employee, you
usually don’t look for someone who will come in, do an average job and go home.
You want someone who will contribute to making your department and the com-
pany better than it is today.This attitude should hold for your IT projects.Yes, you
have to get the job done, but you don’t want to settle for just that. Later in this
chapter and throughout this book, you’ll learn more about how to identify strategic
projects from operational (“keeping the lights on”) projects so you stand a better
chance of making a meaningful contribution to your company (and let’s face it, to
your own career as well). While there is a growing trend toward charging for
internal IT functions as a way of exposing or accounting for the true cost of IT, it’s
not clear which way this trend will go.You might ﬁnd it useful to calculate the
internal cost and apportion it to the various corporate departments, but unless IT is
adding value and seen as strategic, all you’re really doing is buying yourself a bit of
time or shifting costs around on the balance sheet.There’s nothing wrong with accu-
rately accounting for costs, but don’t look to this to save your IT department.
IT managers need to manage differently in today’s world. It’s not enough to
come up with a budget and do a great job with service levels. Successful IT man-
agers understand that they must ﬁnd ways to add value to the company and to effec-
tively communicate that value to key corporate executives and managers. Otherwise,
the long-held perception that IT is nothing but a cost center will continue to thwart
genuinely innovative and strategic IT initiatives.
Understanding 
Your Company’s Strategies
In this next section, we’re going to discuss ways to look at and uncover your com-
pany’s current strategies. We’re doing this for two reasons. First, corporate strategy is
not always well deﬁned and second, it’s sometimes not formally stated. In order to
align your IT strategies with corporate strategies, you have to know what those cor-
porate strategies are.The expectation isn’t that you’re going to go on a mission to

develop your company’s strategies, just that you’re going to do a bit of research and a
bit of thinking about these issues so you can begin to align your IT efforts in that
direction. Don’t get overwhelmed thinking you have to go do all these things—these
are tools you can use if and when you need them.Your job is not to single-handedly
develop your company’s strategies, but if you don’t understand where your company
is headed, you have a very slim chance of aligning your IT strategies to your com-
pany’s strategic objectives. Read through this section, but don’t turn it into a big
action item for yourself.The action part comes later.
Cheat Sheet…
Corporate Strategy
Volumes have been written about corporate and business strategy and our goal
is not to rehash everything ever written. However, there are a few key things you
can learn about corporate and business strategy that will help you better under-
stand your company’s direction and how IT can play an important role. Here’s the
short version.
Corporate strategy is typically created at the top of the organization and it
should be relatively stable. Companies that continually change corporate strate-
gies are often ﬂoundering looking for the right answer. A strategy may involve
using (or even trying out) different tactics, but the overall direction should remain
relatively stable over time. Let’s look at an example. Microsoft developed a cor-
porate strategy that was summarized by, “A computer on every desk and
Windows on every computer.” Their strategy was to dominate the desktop
market. How did they plan on dominating the market? They used a number of
different tactics to do so. In some cases, they bought their competitors; in other
cases, they added features or slashed the price of Windows. Microsoft’s detrac-
tors would say that Microsoft sometimes used heavy-handed tactics, but the
point is that Microsoft created a long-term strategy to dominate the desktop
computer and they are succeeding. Their methods or tactics along the way
changed based on changes in the market, but their overall strategy did not
waiver. With new technologies on the horizon, Microsoft may have to modify its
strategy, but that would come after years of successfully holding fast to a single
strategic vision.

Corporate Strategies and IT
If you want to create a more strategic vision of your IT department, the ﬁrst step is
to learn about your company’s corporate strategies. In some companies, there is a
clearly deﬁned plan shared with top executives and sometimes middle management.
If you’re not privy to the company’s strategic plan, sit down with your boss or a top
executive and learn about it. If you aren’t sure how to begin this quest, think of it as
a corporate job interview. Do some research—much of the information is just a few
search engine clicks away. If you are going to sit down with corporate executives,
make sure you’ve done your homework.Answer as many of these questions on your
own as possible. If you’re well prepared, you’ll create a positive impression and you’ll
likely get better answers from the top execs. Research the answers to these questions:
■
What industry or niche is this company in?
■
Where is the company headed? Where does it want to be in 3-5 years?
■
What are the company’s mission, vision and core values?
■
Who are the key competitors and what are they up to?
■
What’s happening in the broader market or market niche that will poten-
tially impact the ﬁrm?
■
What impact do economic cycles have on the company? Does it do well in
growing or shrinking economies or is it not particularly vulnerable to eco-
nomic ﬂuctuations?
■
Does your company lead or follow its market? (Some companies are always
out front innovating, others are always back in the pack, less innovative but
often more stable.There is no “good” or “bad” answer here.)
■
If the company is publicly held, what do the quarterly and annual reports
say about the company, its goals and direction?
■
If the company is publicly held, how has the stock price fared compared to
its competitors and compared to the overall market? How has it done year-
to-date (YTD), in one, three, and ﬁve years? Are securities analysts recom-
mending buying, holding, or selling your company’s stock?
■
How are the company’s ﬁnancials? Strong, weak, improving, deteriorating?
■
What do your company’s press releases say the company is up to?
Even if you’re not particularly strong in business and ﬁnance, if you understand
your company and the business it’s in, you should be able to understand the

Chapter 2 • What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT?

fundamental concepts related to your ﬁrm. For instance, some companies track very
closely with the economy. Others don’t at all. How does your company fare when the
economy is running full-speed ahead? How has it done in the past three or four years
when the economy was in recession? Here’s an example.The adult education market is
a multi-billion dollar market in the U.S. with a wide variety of companies providing
degree programs for working adults during evening or weekend classes. During lean
economic times, people often choose to get further education to help them keep their
jobs or ﬁnd new jobs in a tight market. During expansive economic times, people seek
further education in order to qualify for new jobs and new opportunities that arise as
businesses expand.Therefore, when you look at demand for education in that partic-
ular niche market, you see it’s almost impervious to economic ﬂuctuations. Other busi-
nesses do track with up or down economic cycles.You don’t need to have a Ph.D. in
economics to understand how the economy could impact your business and by taking
time to consider these higher level issues, you’ll learn a lot and be able to develop a
better IT plan.We’ll discuss devising your IT strategy later in this chapter.
Obviously, the company is not going to come right out and announce to the
world (and consequently, to its competitors) what all of its short and long-term
strategies are, but the overall direction can certainly be discerned by asking questions
and doing some research.Answering the questions posed above will give you a better
than average overview of your company. Once you’ve answered all the questions you
can, request a meeting with someone above you in the organization who is likely to
answer your questions. If you prepare the answers to the above information in a brief
document and bring it with you to this meeting, you’ll impress the boss with your
preparation and won’t waste his or her time asking questions to which you could
have (and should have) gotten the answers on your own.You can use this document
and the data you collect as the basis of a conversation about where the company is
headed.The point is to gather enough information so you can create an IT strategy
that does better than just align with the corporate strategy—it contributes to it in a
new, substantive, or innovative way.
Sound like a tall order? It is, but it might be the most important thing you do as
head of your IT department.Yes, the day-to-day projects, initiatives, and crises will
continue and you’ll still have to deal with those, but if you can ﬁnd a way to take the
information you glean from this process, synthesize it, and create a strategic IT plan
that contributes to and improves upon the corporate strategy, you’re going to ﬁnd that
there is far more executive support for IT projects than ever before.And, if you recall,
executive support is number one on the list of success factors for a project. If you are
an IT project manager and not the IT manager, these same principles apply even
though you are not responsible for the overall direction of the IT department.

Business Strategies and IT
Business strategies are those strategies that are a response to changing market condi-
tions. Businesses don’t exist in a vacuum and though they may spend a lot of time
and effort developing their corporate strategies (which should remain fairly stable
through time), business strategies will have to be modiﬁed by changing market con-
ditions. In some circles, these strategies are called business strategies to differentiate
them from long-term corporate strategies. If a company’s main competitor suddenly
reduces its prices by 30%, the business strategy might have to shift overnight to
respond to this change.The overarching corporate strategy remains unchanged. For
instance, GE had as its goal to be number one or number two in every market it was
in.This meant that the business strategies could change to respond to market condi-
tions as long as the result was to keep GE in the number one or number two slot.
Business strategies will change and ﬂex as the market shifts, but overarching corpo-
rate strategies should remain fairly constant.
So, what does all this have to do with IT? The strategies you implement via your
IT strategic plan should contribute to (or be aligned with) the overall corporate
strategy, but the business strategies you implement will change to respond to changes
in the external marketplace.This is important to understand, especially when looking
at IT projects. While your project may contribute to the long-term corporate
strategy, it’s also likely it will have to align with business strategy to ensure the pro-
jects help the company respond quickly and effectively to changes in the market.
This is a tall order to ﬁll, but understanding these elements helps you discern where
your IT projects fall in the scheme of things and it might help you manage them
more effectively down the line.

The Skinny on Corporate and Business Strategies
Corporate strategies come from within the company and do not change based
on what’s happening in the outside world. Business strategies derive from
changing forces in the external marketplace and may inﬂuence the corporate
strategies and corporate (and IT) operations.

Chapter 2 • What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT?

Now that we’ve deﬁned corporate strategies and business strategies, we’re ready
to jump into the speciﬁcs of developing IT strategies. If you’re not the head of the
IT department or not your company’s CIO, you can still use this information to
improve your business skills as they relate to IT. Even if you are not responsible for
developing these plans, thinking about these issues will make you a more valuable
contributor.
There are numerous methods you can use to develop strategies and a thorough
discussion of them is outside the scope of this book. However, there are some
common elements to these methods and we’ll discuss these to give you speciﬁc tools
to use to devise your IT strategies.Also keep in mind that you may already have a
solid understanding of your company’s strategies and some excellent ideas about
what your IT strategies are or should be. If so, feel free to use this information rather
than going through the exercises described in the next section.The methods
described next are simply tools to help you look at the current environment so you
can develop strategies based on the information you uncover. Remember, any
method simply provides a framework in which to think—it will not do the thinking
for you nor will it provide you a list of strategies when you’re ﬁnished.
Methods To Assist In Developing IT Strategies
The ﬁrst step in developing your IT strategies is to take some time to think about
where your company is headed and what its strategies are or have been. If you’ve
ever thought,“If I ran this company, I would...” then this is a great opportunity to
put those ideas to the test.Although there are probably numerous factors to which
you are not privy, your evaluation of the company’s direction is the best place to
start. One way you can do this is to look at what your company has accomplished in
the past three to ﬁve years.You can also look at any public corporate documents
such as news articles, press releases, and stockholder information if the company is
publicly held, as mentioned earlier in this chapter.All of this information gives you
an idea of not only what the company intended to do, but also what it was able to
accomplish.Take time to review what role (if any) IT played in the intended and
actual results of the company in the past three to ﬁve years. Did IT contribute sig-
niﬁcantly? Did IT play a “utility” role? Did IT projects get cancelled, delayed,
funded, extended? Answering these questions will help you begin to see the role of
IT in the company in the recent past.
Core Competencies
Companies often try to deﬁne core competencies as a way to continually focus on
what they do best and leave the rest to someone else. Sometimes they outsource
www.syngress.com
What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT? • Chapter 2
45

these non-core competencies; sometimes they simply stop doing them altogether.
The same holds true for IT core competencies. Whether your IT department pri-
marily manages the network and its users or develops custom software solutions, you
should look at your core competencies. Here’s a good example.A company in the
hotel business has a great IT department that manages the reservations system, hotel
inventory system, and restaurant services system. Is developing an integrated software
program that includes these three key functions part of the IT department’s core
competencies or not? There is no simple yes or no answer here. If the IT department
has a group of talented, experienced software developers, the answer might be yes. If
the IT department is primarily focused on deploying, maintaining, upgrading, and
repairing these three core applications and its related infrastructure, the answer might
be no. If it’s not a core competency and the company wants/needs an integrated
solution, the IT department can either develop the requirements and have an
external company develop the application, or it can develop the skills internally
through targeted hiring.As you can see from these examples, there are often several
approaches that might be feasible, but usually only one or two solutions that leverage
core competencies.
Identifying the core competencies of your IT staff and department will help you
develop an appropriate strategy for moving forward. If you can’t deﬁne your core
competencies, you may have an IT department in transition from one role to
another or you need to step back and really focus on what core competencies it
should have and work to develop/acquire those. Understanding your IT department’s
core competencies will also help you make smarter decisions when planning new IT
projects. We’ll discuss that in more detail later in the book.
SWOT Analysis
Another useful planning tool is the SWOT analysis, which stands for strengths, weak-
nesses, opportunities, and threats.This is a commonly used technique in all types of
business planning. Some like to view strengths and weaknesses as internal to the
company and opportunities and threats as external to the company. In truth, you can
do a SWOT analysis on just about anything and this includes your company, your
competitors, and the marketplace. For instance, after looking at your company’s
strengths and weaknesses (internal), you might also see some opportunities and
threats that are internal to your company. Internal opportunities might be those
related to leveraging your core competencies. Internal threats might be politics, sig-
niﬁcant changes in top management, or a change in corporate ownership, for
example.You don’t have to spend days or weeks on this exercise, but you should give
these factors some thought. What does your company do well (strength)? What does
www.syngress.com
46
Chapter 2 • What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT?

you company not do as well as its competitors, or not do well at all (weakness)?
Based on your company’s strengths and weaknesses, what are the opportunities in
the marketplace that will leverage your company’s strengths? Based on your com-
pany’s weaknesses, what are the external threats that exist? Are there any opportuni-
ties or threats that are internal to your company (pending take over, change in
direction, etc.)?
Next, do a SWOT analysis on your IT department. Be brutally honest and be
willing to look at the good, the bad, and the ugly. What is your IT department very
good at? What is it not so good (or terrible) at? What are the current or possible
opportunities for your IT department, and what are the known or possible threats to
your IT department? By looking at these elements, you’ll begin to see the picture
come into focus. If you’re really brave (or secure), you may want to ask department
outsiders for their view of the IT department’s strengths and weaknesses.You might
be quite surprised by what you learn and you can incorporate that feedback into
your planning process.
For each strength you identify, you should look for corresponding opportunities.
You want to play to your strengths and minimize your weaknesses.You also want to
correlate each of your identiﬁed weaknesses to potential opportunities and threats. For
instance, if there is a great opportunity, but it really hits you in your weak spot, you
might choose to forgo the opportunity or take steps to strengthen that weakness.
Similarly, if you spot a threat that plays right into a weakness, you’ll need to take deci-
sive action to mitigate the threat or improve strength in that area. Knowing these four
elements will help you align your priorities, activities and projects so you take full
advantage of your strengths while managing the downside (weaknesses and threats).
Trend Analysis
Another method of developing a strategic IT plan is to look at trends in the market.
These can be broken down into four main quadrants and it’s possible that there may
be a slightly different set of four for your company’s speciﬁc industry or market.The
four quadrants are:
■
Customer
■
Competition
■
Technology
■
Regulation
www.syngress.com
What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT? • Chapter 2
47

Customer
What’s happening with your customers? What are customers looking for in general?
How does IT play into this? Trends these days include customers increasingly
looking for more value at a lower cost, judging a company by the service it provides,
and demanding higher quality (lower tolerance for poor quality). In some cases,
brand is also an issue. Understanding the trends in your customer market is vital to a
good plan because without customers, you are out of business. Remember, in the IT
world, you often have two (or more) customers: the internal corporate customers for
whom you provide IT services and the external corporate customers who purchase
your company’s products and services. If your IT department develops software that
your company sells as well as manages the network infrastructure, you probably have
two distinct customer sets—internal users and external paying customers.You’ll need
to look at all IT customers in developing your IT plans.
Competition
What are the trends with your competitors? Are they gaining or losing market share?
Are they equally impacted by economic trends? How are they responding to
changing customer demands? How are they responding to globalization? What is the
impact of technology on their business? How are your competitors managing their
business knowledge? Are they outsourcing? How are they using technology in their
business? How are they innovating with technology? Have they created any key
alliances? Finally, are there any new competitors now or on the horizon? What are
the “new guys” doing? When looking at your company’s competitors, you also want
to try to ﬁnd out what technology they’re using, how their IT department is struc-
tured and/or functioning and anything else you can glean from your competitors
about their IT efforts.
Technology
How do the changes in technology impact your company (and your competitors)?
How has the Internet changed your business and how will it drive change in the
future? How has technology impacted your relationship with your customers
(internal and external)—for better or worse? (Press 1 if you’ve ever been trapped in a
voice mail system, Press 2….). How have increased mobility demands impacted your
company? How have changes in the security environment impacted your company?
How has the competition implemented technology? What technologies are
“industry standards” in your ﬁeld? What types of emerging technologies might give
your company a competitive advantage if implemented early and well?
www.syngress.com
48
Chapter 2 • What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT?

Regulation
How has the regulatory environment impacted your company? Has the opening of
new trade markets (NAFTA, etc.) helped or hindered your company? Have the reg-
ulations regarding health care privacy (HIPAA—Health Insurance Portability &
Accountability Act) or ﬁnancial reporting (Sarbanes-Oxley) impacted your com-
pany? How have these or other regulations impacted your IT department? 
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
The methods mentioned here are only a sampling of ways you can go
about analyzing where you are and where you need to be, but they are
among the most user-friendly ones. While it won’t hurt you to use all of
these methods (and some of you very detail-oriented people out there
will), you can keep it simple by selecting one method that aligns best
with the way you prefer to think and work. Set aside a time to meet
with key team members and gather input and ideas. Spend time pro-
cessing the results of the meeting and reconvene again in a week or so
and gather team responses, comments, and insights. Just dedicating
time to this activity and making it a priority is a great start and will likely
generate ideas and information you can use. If possible, include as many
members of your team (or better yet, a cross-departmental team) as pos-
sible to help you avoid blind spots in your planning process. The old
adage “two heads are better than one” is doubly true in the planning
process.
Developing Your IT Strategy
Let’s recap for a moment. We looked at the importance of aligning IT strategy to
corporate strategy and even suggested you might be able to do one better by devel-
oping IT strategies that further the corporate strategy, taking it to the next level.
Then, we looked at corporate strategy and tools you can use to unearth the strate-
gies in your company. Sometimes they’re written down and easy to ﬁnd; other times
you have to reverse engineer some information to ﬁgure out what the corporate
strategy is.You’re doing this because you want to make sure IT efforts are lined up in
the same direction that the company’s headed. Next, we looked at business strategies
that come from changes in the external market and how these integrate into corpo-
rate strategies.At a high level, the corporation has strategies and business strategies,
www.syngress.com
What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT? • Chapter 2
49

so too does the IT department. Finally, we looked at ways you can begin to ﬁgure
out what your IT strategies might be.
At this point, you should have some ideas regarding what your IT strategies should
be. However, you may still be pondering these questions.Take all the information you
have and see if you’re missing anything.Any big, crazy ideas you’d like to throw in the
pot? Thinking big at the strategic level is good.You can always dial it back into reality
later, but we tend to miss opportunities for innovation when we think too small. If
Microsoft had said,“We’d like to be the operating system running on business desktop
computers throughout the U.S.” they would have missed the enormous opportunity to
be on desktops in homes and in businesses all over the world.
After you’ve generated your ideas on what your IT strategy could look like, decide
which ideas are truly innovative, play to your strengths and minimize (or mitigate)
your weaknesses. Decide which ideas will help drive the company forward toward its
strategic goals. Begin to look at these ideas in a more concrete way and discard any
ideas that seem truly unreasonable or outside the realm of possibility, but do this very
carefully. Sometimes innovative ideas are scrapped because initially they may not be
well formulated or well articulated.While we can’t always see the future clearly, pon-
dering big,“impossible”, innovative ideas can lead us to unexpected strategies that are
feasible either near- or long-term. Sometimes it’s just a matter of perspective.
Next, we’re going to discuss several methods you can use to sort through your
ideas on IT strategy.You can use all of them or just some of them. If you have a
method you prefer, feel free to use it.Again, the idea is not to overwhelm you with
process—just the opposite. By giving you several different methods you might use,
you can pick and choose those that ﬁt best with your business or your way of seeing
things. It’s not an exhaustive review of methods, just a few that are relatively user-
friendly that can generate a sense of order and clarity when trying to put together
your IT strategies.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
When you look at innovative strategic ideas (which can include ideas for
innovative projects as well), you can use these four keywords as your
guides: logical, feasible, desirable, and affordable. As a baseline, busi-
ness activities (including all IT efforts) should be logical—do they make
sense at this time in this situation? Next, are they feasible? Some great
ideas are just not feasible—either now or in the future. Next, is it desir-
able? Again, some ideas will knock your socks off, but they’re actually
not desirable for any one of a number of reasons (serious downside risk
is one). Something can be feasible (do-able) but not desirable. Finally, is
www.syngress.com
50
Chapter 2 • What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT?

it affordable? Sometimes we have to make the ﬁnal decision between
two or more competing ideas (or activities) based on which is most
affordable.
If you use these four concepts in evaluating ideas and proposals,
you’ll be able to decide from among competing demands in a more
rational manner.
One method of looking at strategy ideas (potential strategies) is to use a grid
with four quadrants, each with a different risk and reward (payoff) level.This com-
monly used planning method provides a more tangible method of placing ideas with
regard to risk and reward and you can begin sorting out which ideas are worth pur-
suing and which are probably not.The grid is shown in Figure 2.2.
Figure 2.2 Risk-Reward Grid
Clearly, when you’re assessing both the potential payoff and the potential risks,
you want to aim for the “sweet spot” where you get the greatest payoff for the
lowest risk. However, there are times when you might select projects with a lower
payoff and less risk or a higher payoff and more risk.Things are relative and though
it would be nice if all projects fell neatly into these categories, there are always judg-

What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT? • Chapter 2
51

ment calls you’ll have to make. If you begin by sorting your ideas into these four
quadrants or sections, you should get a clearer picture of how your ideas ﬁt together.
If you’re looking toward big, innovative ideas, you’re usually going to have to look in
the high payoff/ high risk category. Remember that innovative use of technology
can create a competitive advantage, but these days it’s typically not a long-term
advantage. Keeping that in mind will help when evaluating risk and reward so you
can choose your projects wisely. If you don’t have the ﬁnal authority to pick and
choose strategies or project ideas, categorizing projects according to risk/reward will
help decision-makers sort through ideas and will underscore your business savvy
with folks who are likely to notice.
Once you’ve developed your short list of ideas, approaches, and directions, look at
the broader market again. How will these ideas ﬁt into what is happening now and
likely to happen in the future? If you’re not looking ahead, you’re going to be blind-
sided by something, so make sure you look into the short and long term to see what is
likely to occur. If you fail to take into account what’s happening in the market (which,
as you recall, drives business strategies or how you run the business), you’re missing a
large portion of the picture. If you fail to address market issues when you present your
project ideas to decision makers, you’ll undermine your credibility.
When you’ve moved all these puzzle pieces around, you should have an excellent
start on your IT department’s strategic direction. How you record it is up to you,
but you should write it down, save it and print it out so you can look at it every day.
You may want to boil it down to a few key words or phrases so that when you
glance at it on your wall, cubicle, or computer monitor you instantly remember to
align everything you do to these strategies. Next, you need to build a bridge
between your strategies and your day-to-day activities through developing business
strategies and an operational plan.
The IT Factor…
Urgent? Important?
Steven Covey, the popular business guru, talks about categorizing our day-to-day
tasks into four main categories:
■
Urgent and important
■
Urgent and not important

■
Not urgent and important
■
Not urgent and not important
Many of us spend a lot of time responding to urgent and not important
things. Many interruptions, phone calls, and e-mails fall into this category. They
grab our attention and demand our time. We’ll always have to deal with these
kinds of tasks, but keeping an eye out for these time killers is important so we
can keep them to a bare minimum. To be most effective on the job (or anywhere,
really), you should make sure you leave time in your day and week to work on
things that are not urgent but important because these are things like planning,
relationship building, and learning. These add value and help you look at a
slightly longer time horizon. And, if you’re spending a lot of time on not urgent
and not important tasks, you’re wasting valuable time. People often work on not
urgent and not important tasks when they’re overwhelmed or burned out. If you
(or a member of your team) spends a lot of time on not urgent and not impor-
tant tasks, take a long hard look at what’s going on because it’s certainly not pro-
ductive and it’s absolutely not driving the company (or your career) forward.
Moving From Strategy To Operations
For many, it’s easier to just jump in and start doing things than it is to step back and
strategize ﬁrst.The dot-com bubble of the late 1990’s proves that point. Many com-
panies were built on great ideas or technological possibilities, with the belief that
operations would follow. Not so. Numerous online startup companies at the time
approached the market with a cool website and maybe even innovative technology,
but no operational plan that might have addressed supply chain management, distri-
bution channels, or delivery methods. What investors and dot-com companies alike
learned was that operations do not just naturally follow strategy (the word strategy is
used loosely here because it’s clear in retrospect that some of the dotcom companies
lacked a coherent strategy).
In order to maximize a business’s chances for success, strategy should drive oper-
ations. In order for that to happen, though, you must ﬁrst do the following:
■
Develop a corporate strategy
■
Translate strategy into tangible terms
■
Implement work efforts that support strategy
■
Align resources with prioritized work efforts
■
Deﬁne operational performance indicators that support strategies
■
Manage change

It’s relatively easy to list these items and a bit more difﬁcult to do them. Let’s talk
about these six key elements brieﬂy.
Develop a Corporate IT Strategy
We’ve already discussed corporate strategy and corporate IT strategy at great length,
so we won’t reiterate that information here. In order to translate strategy into opera-
tions, you obviously have to start with a strategy. We’ll assume you have one based
on the material presented earlier in this chapter.
Translate Corporate and IT 
Strategy into Tangible Terms
Your job as IT manager is to take that corporate strategy and begin to deﬁne the
details of how the strategy will be accomplished.Again, this is the translation from
strategy into operations—the where we’re headed into the how we’ll get there. Some
companies like to deﬁne two separate stages: implementation and operations. Using
this model, implementation is how you achieve strategic objectives and operations are
the ongoing maintenance activities of these implementations. However, we’re going
to talk in relatively simple terms: strategy and operations. Someone has to develop
plans as to how strategic objectives will be met.Your opportunity as the IT manager
(or part of the IT team) is to look at how IT and technology can play a part in
achieving strategic objectives.A good starting point is to look at each strategic
objective and ask (and answer),“How can IT (or technology) support this objec-
tive?”You can also ask,“What IT current or new activities would support this
strategy best?”
Cheat Sheet…
One Goal, Many Roads
Often there are many different operational activities that can support or further
strategic objectives. The trick is ﬁguring out which ones are the most desirable.
Earlier we discussed the four keywords you can use when looking at projects: log-
ical, feasible, desirable, and affordable. Even after you’ve looked at your options
in this light, you may still need additional input on the direction to head since
there may be several options that meet your criteria. At this point, executive input
or feedback can be helpful. In some companies, this is a real challenge because
www.syngress.com
54
Chapter 2 • What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT?
Continued

the top executives may mistakenly believe that you have all the information you
need to translate the strategies into operational plans. If you don’t, you’ll need
to discuss your options with them and get their input. While they may not under-
stand operations as well as you do, they can be instrumental in helping you dis-
cern the best options. Along the way, they may learn operations a bit better and
you’ll certainly come away with a stronger understanding of the corporate strate-
gies and how you can ensure your IT operations support and further those goals.
You may also get a few bonus points for recognizing the need to choose wisely
and ask for executive input. Don’t go in with an open-ended question “What
should we do?” Instead, lay out your options (using risk/reward discussed earlier
or any other useful method of categorizing opportunities) and ask which of the
options presented best suits the business.
Executive support is key to project success and the same holds true here. If
you go off and plan your operations without executive support, you may ﬁnd
that you’ve selected the wrong options or that you used the wrong criteria when
selecting from among your options. Getting executive buy-in early helps prevent
misunderstandings later.
Implement Operations that Support IT Strategy
This might seem incredibly obvious, but it’s worth stating. Once you ﬁgure out what
the strategy is and you’ve deﬁned ways you can accomplish those strategies, you
need to ensure that work efforts actually support the strategy. It’s not uncommon to
ﬁnd companies that have deﬁned strategic plans and who have even taken the time
to translate strategy into operational plans—and then proceed to ignore them.They
take on projects or perform work that doesn’t align with the strategy. It’s a good idea
to step back from time to time to ensure your efforts are aligned with where the
company is headed. Otherwise you could ﬁnd yourself, your department, or your
job headed out into left ﬁeld all alone.
You’ll also need to ﬁgure out your priorities. In an ideal world, we could
manage “triorities” (translation:“Do these three things ﬁrst.”) but in truth, we must
prioritize. Part of the trick is in knowing which criteria to use for prioritizing. Do
you do so based on how closely something ﬁts with the strategy or which will have
the most impact on strategy? Do you choose based on that which is least expensive
or involves the least risk or that which can be accomplished most quickly? These are
decisions you’ll need to make and your company may have guidelines to help you
through this process. If not, sit down with your boss and say (in essence),“Here are
all the things we need to do, here are the things that align best with corporate strate-
gies. Here is what I think our priorities should be, what do you think?”Also be
aware that despite your best efforts, your plans (short or long-term) could end up
being tossed aside for a completely new direction or new set of priorities.

Unfortunately, change sometimes happens quickly and quietly at the top of the
organization and can take a while to ﬁlter down to you. Changes that impact your
planning may require you to re-think your strategies, which can be discouraging.
However, if you have strategies, priorities, and plans, you’re certainly better off than
if you didn’t.And, you’re more likely to get noticed (in a good way) from top execu-
tives when you are well prepared and understand that planning, prioritizing, and
ﬂexibility are all important skills for business.
Cheat Sheet…
Communication is the Key
One key concept you’ll see throughout this book is communication. It’s critical at
every juncture and good communicators are often more effective in organiza-
tions than poor communicators. In the May 23, 2005 issue of Baseline magazine,
CIO Trude Van Horn says that, “I’ve been in organizations where the best pre-
senters got the funding as opposed to those who needed it but couldn’t articu-
late that need appropriately.” (Baseline Magazine, May 23, 2005, Issue 044, p.
62). It’s clear that communicating effectively not only gets the job done, it gets
the job funded. It’s a good idea to sit down with your manager, the CIO, or even
the senior management of the company (whichever is most appropriate to your
particular situation) and talk about priorities. Every company is different and if
you create a prioritized list based on cost and your company is more concerned
with time-to-market, you’re going to have problems. Instead, ask for explicit
agreement on priorities. In fact, if you can get agreement in writing (e-mail is a
good tool for this), all the better. If things change down the road, you’ll have sup-
port (or at least evidence of prior support) for the decisions you made and the
priorities you set. If you’re working in a highly political organization, be sure to
read Chapter 3 on navigating the murky waters of corporate politics.
Align Resources with Prioritized Operations Efforts
Once you have your priorities ﬁgured out and agreed to, you have to align available
resources with those priorities. Resources include people as well as tools, technologies,
and funding. Companies are dealing with ﬁnite resources, so making sure the right
resources are applied to the right projects and other efforts is important to ensure
success.As we’ll discuss later in this book, applying the right resources to the right
tasks is an important element of IT project management, so proper resource alloca-
tion will be a theme you’ll hear more about.

Deﬁne Performance 
Indicators that Support IT Strategies
The adage “You get what you measure” holds true here. Once you’ve deﬁned what
you’re going to do to support corporate strategies, you need to deﬁne performance
metrics that support those strategies. It’s often good to get those involved with the
delivery (operations) involved with deﬁning those performance indicators because
they know what is reasonable and what is not.They can also alert you to inherent
problems with chosen performance indicators that you might not spot immediately.
Enterprise 128…
Be Careful What You Ask For…
You do get what you measure, so you need to choose your measurements care-
fully. Here’s a great example of how measuring the wrong thing will get you the
wrong result.
A software company hired an outsourcer to handle the bulk of its technical
support call volume for a particular product line. Most of the calls were consid-
ered Level One or Level Two calls, meaning that they were easy to moderately dif-
ﬁcult to resolve. The Level Three calls, those that required signiﬁcant expertise or
even engineering changes, were always routed to the software company’s senior
technical staff. The software company had decided to outsource these Level One
and Level Two calls as a way of saving money. They believed that the outsourcer’s
economies of scale would result in signiﬁcant cost savings. That, and the out-
sourcer’s staff were paid about 60% of the average of the software company’s
technical staff.
The software company set up metrics for call times, average time to answer
a call, and number of available technicians per half hour. Guess what happened?
Call times met the call time length, but that meant that calls that needed more
time to be resolved were being “dumped.” Maybe you’ve had this happen to
you—the support person says, “I need to check on some things, is it O.K. if I put
you on hold for a moment?” You grudgingly agree and next thing you know,
you’re disconnected. If the support person is being held to a speciﬁc call time
metric, he or she might dump calls that threaten to raise the call time over the
acceptable threshold (most companies have metrics in place to prevent this and
most support folks—outsourcers and internal folks alike—do a great job and
respond to the caller’s needs. To all you support folks out there who do a great
job, this does not refer to you!).
www.syngress.com
What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT? • Chapter 2
57
Continued

There is a happy ending here. The software company agreed to a more rea-
sonable average call time and began measuring and paying for higher quality
results. Thus, the staff at the outsourcer was also measured and rewarded for
higher quality results, which lead both to fewer dropped calls and to record-set-
ting quality results.
Lesson Learned: Be sure that what you’re measuring is what you really need
to be measuring and) doesn’t have a hidden downside. Think through scenarios
to determine if your measurements will actually drive the outcomes you want.
Talk to the folks who will be held to these metrics to ﬁnd out if there are prob-
lems you hadn’t anticipated. Be willing to modify metrics if they do not drive the
outcome(s) you want.
Manage Change
The ﬁnal element is managing change.Though a thorough discussion of change
management is outside the scope of this book, it is important to discuss it brieﬂy
here. Change is a constant factor in any plan.Although you should avoid constantly
changing or re-evaluating the strategic plan, the operational plan (also known as the
tactical or business strategy) should change to address changes in the marketplace.
Companies that cannot respond effectively to change are at a signiﬁcant disadvan-
tage, especially if their competitors manage change well. Revising operational plans
and business strategies as market and competitive forces dictate is important.As the
saying goes,“Manage change or it will manage you.”There are additional elements
of change management and we’ll discuss some of those elements later in the book
when we discuss how projects create change and how to communicate and manage
that change.
Assessing Your Current IT Environment
After all is said and done, you still need to know exactly where you are today. Once
you have a corporate IT strategy deﬁned and you’ve gone down into the next layer
and deﬁned your priorities, you should take a step back and audit your current IT
department and IT projects. Gather all the information you can on all IT projects
and (ideally) pop it into a database. Be sure to include details such as the project
name, project objectives (or business objective it’s addressing), project length, esti-
mated cost, project risk, and even the business beneﬁts. If you can’t deﬁne or identify
one of those elements just mentioned, it should raise a red ﬂag for you.This com-
prehensive inventory of IT projects gives you the big picture view and if this is the
ﬁrst time you’ve ever taken inventory of your IT projects, you might be shocked by
what you see. On one hand, you might see a beautiful array of perfectly aligned IT
www.syngress.com
58
Chapter 2 • What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT?

projects…on the other hand, you might see a random assortment of projects that
don’t seem get you anywhere at all.
The process might seem tedious, but the results are often worth the effort. It’s
through this process that you often ﬁnd redundancies that you might have missed
before.You can see overlaps, resource conﬂicts, and a wealth of other information
when you step up to the “40,000 foot view.”
Evaluating Your IT Projects
There are numerous ways one can evaluate IT projects and for our purposes in this
chapter, we’re talking about evaluating IT projects as it relates to corporate strategy.
As you’re taking inventory of your IT projects, you can put each proposed or cur-
rent IT project in one of three strategic buckets: supports corporate strategies, sup-
ports IT strategies, or does not support strategies. Clearly, projects that support both
corporate and IT strategies (which, for your IT department, are now closely aligned
or the same) are those that should continue to get the most focus and resources.
Those that meet corporate but not IT strategies will be second on your list.
However, if these types of projects exist, it’s a good idea to step back and ﬁnd out
why it aligns with corporate, but not IT strategies. It’s possible it was started before
you aligned these goals or it’s possible that it’s a unique project that ﬁts appropriately
or is a pet project of a senior manager in the company.Third on your list of projects
should be those that align with IT strategies but not corporate strategies.These you
should take a hard look at. If it aligns with IT but not corporate, there’s a strong
chance the project is the wrong project.There’s also an excellent chance the project
will run into some sort of political problem (see Chapter 3 for more on corporate
politics and projects) because top executives will be unable to rationalize or support
a project that doesn’t further corporate goals. Finally, at the bottom of your list are
the projects that don’t align with either corporate or IT strategies.The question
must be asked: why on Earth are you doing this project at all? Of course, sometimes
there are leftover projects that should be completed; sometimes politics are at play
and it’s a favorite project of someone in a powerful position. If it doesn’t align and
it’s not a political hot potato, consider dropping it, suspending it, or ﬁnishing it up
quickly (reduced scope or quality, perhaps).There are no hard and fast rules here, but
clearly you can see that it’s much easier to support, deﬁne, and defend projects that
align, support, or even further corporate and IT strategies.
Categorizing Your IT Projects
There are several high-level categories you can use to look at your projects as well.
When you evaluated your projects (previous section), you looked at them in terms
www.syngress.com
What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT? • Chapter 2
59

of strategic ﬁt with the organization. Now, you look at them from an IT perspective.
While not exhaustive, here’s a starter list for you to work with:
Strategic or Operational
Projects are either strategic or operational in nature. Strategic projects are those that
map with the corporate and IT strategies we’ve been discussing. Operational projects
are those that provide maintenance or utility function. Remember, a project is a
one-time solution to a deﬁned problem, but projects can address strategic or opera-
tional issues.Although a project may not be viewed as strategic, how well it’s carried
out can have a signiﬁcant impact on the business, so all projects that are planned and
implemented must be executed ﬂawlessly. Here’s an example. Suppose you’ve deter-
mined that three of your key network servers are too slow and don’t have enough
storage capacity.You’ve looked at the costs and various solutions and determined that
in the long run, replacing those three servers with the latest models will save the
company time and money by:
■
Reducing or eliminating network bottlenecks (which translates into slow
user response, wasted user time, and increased user frustration).
■
Reducing or eliminating failures and repairs (which translates into no user
response, wasted user time, and increased user frustration).
■
Providing opportunities for additional storage, additional or upgraded appli-
cations (which translates into faster user response, efﬁcient use of user time,
and reduced user frustration).
Clearly, this is routine maintenance in an IT department—making sure network
resources meet or exceed corporate (user) needs. However, if this is implemented
poorly, it might take the network down for too long during the upgrade or it could
provide intermittent, unreliable service for weeks or months after the conversion. If
these servers store data needed for a huge client proposal and users are either unable
to get the data or not certain of the data integrity, this conversion could shift from a
maintenance task to an escalated nightmare in a hurry.Though this may appear to be
a normal operational issue, it may also be deﬁned as a project because it is a one-
time solution to a deﬁned problem. Just because a project is deemed operational
doesn’t make it any less important. Later in this book, you’ll learn the steps to take
to make sure every project you undertake has a much better chance of success.

Chapter 2 • What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT?

Long or Short-Term
IT projects may be long or short-term in nature, that’s not news to you. However,
it’s often a good idea to categorize your projects by duration for several reasons.
First, as you read in Chapter 1, projects with a more limited scope and a shorter
duration are often more successful than longer, more complex projects. In addition,
projects of short and long duration often share resources. In some cases, it’s desirable
to mix long and short duration projects so that you make the most efﬁcient use of
resources. Shorter projects can often be scheduled in between other tasks or projects
when resources are available or are not being used at maximum capacity. While this
may sound like a pie-in-the-sky concept (when compared to your every day reality),
if you’ve taken some time to categorize projects by duration, you may just ﬁnd
opportunities to better utilize your limited resources. If you don’t, at least you’ll
know exactly how much time your various projects are slated for (scheduled). Later
in this book, you’ll look at managing resources to maximize efﬁciency.
Hardware or Software
Another useful category for projects is hardware or software. Clearly some projects
may fall in between and you may ﬁnd additional categories in this area helpful.The
point of separating hardware from software projects is simply to help you get a good
feel for the types of projects you have. It’s like cleaning off your desk.The amount of
work hasn’t changed but your ability to more quickly organize and complete your
work goes up dramatically. Later in this book when we discuss project plans, we’ll
delineate areas where hardware project plans and software project plans may have
slightly different steps involved.
Develop or Deploy
Experienced IT project managers usually recommend separating the discovery phase
from the implementation phase.Another way of saying that is don’t try to imple-
ment something you have yet to invent. If you have projects that are in trouble, it
might be useful for you to determine if any of them have fallen victim to this type
of planning. If so, these projects might do well broken into multiple projects that
separate discovery (or invention) from deployment (or implementation). If you are
going to upgrade your company’s entire infrastructure and use a new program you’re
developing, which is based on a new security algorithm, you might do well to create
three project plans:
www.syngress.com
What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT? • Chapter 2
61

■
Test security algorithm
■
Develop and test new program using security algorithm
■
Lab test and deploy new infrastructure components
Finally, it’s important to know which projects involve development effort and
which involve deployment effort. When you’re talking about a software project, it
can be particularly useful to determine which is which. Here’s an example. If you
have an application that is new and you have clients willing to test it out, you may
have development and deployment going on simultaneously. It might be useful to
identify your development projects separate from your deployment projects.
Although deployment projects may also require development, they are speciﬁcally
related to deploying the application.This might include writing a custom interface
to map or import client data from an old system to yours. It might involve writing
code to improve the installation and conﬁguration of your application on a variety
of platforms. It could entail creating a Web interface for your application and devel-
oping a hosted application model.All of these are certainly development tasks, but
they are also part of deployment.As you can see, there may not be any black and
white answers here, but taking the time to classify projects can help you see what’s
going on in your IT department.
Project or Process
We’ll mention one last categorization that might be useful—determining whether
something requires a project or a process. It’s a fundamental question that should be
asked before undertaking any project and we’ll give you the tools to evaluate this
later in this book. However, here’s a preview.A project is a solution to a stated
problem.A process is a set of procedures used to address ongoing operations.
Sometimes new processes are needed to address operational issues. Before jumping in
and developing a whole new project plan, you should determine if the solution
should be in the form of a project or a process. Projects can produce new business or
operational processes, but sometimes projects have been created when a process is
really all that’s needed. Evaluating current and proposed projects in this light can
help you avoid creating projects when a process is all that’s needed.

Chapter 2 • What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT?

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
This mapping process can be a great opportunity for you to meet with
people in your organization representing the various business units. As
you work together to map or categorize projects, you can derive some
great beneﬁts. The opportunity to build relationships with your business
unit counterparts will help you when the going gets tough (see Chapter 3
on corporate politics for more on the value of building relationships). You
will also have the opportunity to learn about your company and its busi-
ness from the experts in each business group. As you’ve read, the stats are
favoring IT pros that have both IT and business experience and learning
from this expert group can jump-start your understanding of the impor-
tant business elements in your ﬁrm. And the reverse is also true—your
counterparts in the business units will have the opportunity to learn a bit
more about IT operations. Perhaps the most powerful outcome from this
type of meeting is the opportunity for business unit managers to identify
IT projects that are redundant, useless, or clearly no longer needed. By
working with this group to map IT projects to strategic objectives, you’ll
reduce (or eliminate) resistance you might otherwise encounter when sug-
gesting scrapping (or mothballing) a project.
Once you’ve gained agreement on the projects that should continue, you’ll need
to prioritize those projects.They can be prioritized using different methods, but a
good starting point is trying to determine how much each project contributes to the
strategic objectives and perhaps how many strategic objectives a project addresses.
You’ll also need to look at other constraining factors such as how effectively projects
use assigned resources or how quickly a project needs to be completed.You’re bound
to end up with a list of projects beyond what the company can implement or fund
today or in the near future. By mapping projects to strategic objectives and priori-
tizing them with your business counterparts, you can make a much stronger case for
funding the projects that align with strategies and get less resistance for scrapping the
ones that don’t align (or never made much sense in the ﬁrst place).
Developing Your 
IT Operational Roadmap
Once you have your IT strategies and your project inventory in hand, you can
develop your operational roadmap—your ops plan.This is where you identify how
IT will achieve both corporate and IT strategic objectives.
www.syngress.com
What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT? • Chapter 2
63

The ﬁrst step is to map each project that is either slated to start soon or is
already underway to your corporate and business IT plans. If a project can’t be
mapped to deﬁned strategies, it might not be an appropriate project to work on.
You’ll need to take a hard look at those projects to determine if they should be con-
tinued to completion, put on hold, or scrapped altogether. While most of us are
reluctant to just take a project and dump it in the virtual trashcan, it’s sometimes the
only rational choice once you’ve taken an objective look at your strategic objectives
and your current efforts. With limited time and resources, it’s critical to ensure that
each project helps move you forward toward your strategic objectives—or better yet,
pushes your strategic objectives into a new realm altogether. Dead or drifting pro-
jects create organizational drag that slow the company (and your department) down,
losing precious competitive advantage.
Depending on the organization, some non-conforming projects are implemented
because of political pressure, because of favors promised or owed to key clients, or
because of personal aspirations (and many other crazy reasons). By non-conforming, we
mean that these projects came from or live somewhere out in left ﬁeld and they do
not now, nor have they ever supported the ongoing mission of the IT department or
company. Certainly after reading and digesting the information in this chapter, you
may be looking with fresh eyes at your IT projects. In many companies, there are
projects that just don’t make sense. If they can be re-aligned to support business
objectives, they might be worth completing. If not, scrap the project. If it’s a political
mineﬁeld, you may be able to use all the data you’ve collected and prepared in this
chapter and present it to those with the political inﬂuence. Quite often, logic and
ﬁnances trump politics (often, but not always).
After gaining agreement on project priorities, you can develop your operational
plan. If you also took time to categorize your current and proposed projects, you
have an excellent feel for all the work currently expected of the IT department.At
this point, you can put all of this into a plan that describes how you’ll achieve these
results. If you’re not sure how to develop this plan, there are numerous books, web-
sites and articles available to you. However, this plan should include all current and
proposed projects as well as ongoing operational/maintenance activities.Though our
focus is on IT projects, we all know that the day-to-day problems, minor and major
crises, and unexpected issues have to be dealt with.An operations plan should recog-
nize and account for these activities along with the operational and strategic ele-
ments.The plan should identify existing IT resources including staff (and staff
expertise), equipment and funding (budget). It should describe the processes you’ll
use to manage the day-to-day activities and projects. It should be a useful document
you can use on a daily basis to keep you on track when all the forces of the universe
seem to be pulling you in opposing directions.

Chapter 2 • What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT?

Summary
We covered a lot of ground in this chapter. For some of you, it might be old hat. For
others, it might be new and a bit confusing. If this is all very new to you, take time
to come back and read this chapter again later, after the dust has settled. It will begin
to come into focus if you take your time and digest it in small segments. Perhaps
reading this summary will tie it all together for you.
It’s more important than ever before that IT departments contribute to corpo-
rate success.The use of technology itself no longer provides a competitive advantage
by default. Companies are looking for IT departments to contribute to the forward
progress of the company.The best way that can happen is if the efforts of the IT
department are aligned with corporate strategies and objectives.A notable beneﬁt
from this type of alignment is that your projects and your department are more
likely to gain much needed executive support if your efforts are contributing to the
greater good of the company. If in that process you can also ﬁnd a way to extend or
expand corporate strategies through IT efforts, you’re even better off.That’s a tall
order but if you don’t look for it, you’ll certainly never ﬁnd it.
It may take some work to ﬁgure out what your company’s strategy is—it’s not
always written down, it’s not always openly discussed. In this chapter, we provided
you with some tools you can use to research and reverse engineer corporate strategy
if you have to. Corporate strategies (and IT strategies as well) are impacted by what’s
going on in the external market place. Strategies that originate from these external
drivers are often called business strategies.The IT department may or may not have
business strategies, but it’s worth looking at because IT is often impacted by what’s
happening in the broader technology market and by what’s happening with vendors,
customers and competitors.
Once you’ve got some idea what the corporate strategy is, you can begin to
develop your IT strategies. We talked about various methods people use to begin to
formulate ideas for strategies including evaluating core competencies, doing a
SWOT analysis and looking at trends.This is not an exhaustive review, but a good
starting point.And, if you already have a good idea of what your IT strategies should
be and how they align with corporate strategies, you can use those tools to test, eval-
uate, or strengthen your thoughts.
After you’ve come up with your thoughts and ideas, you’ll need to organize those
ideas. In this chapter we provided tools for you to begin doing that including the
risk/reward grid.We also discussed the importance of talking about priorities with
your boss or senior management to make sure everyone is making the same assump-
tions about priorities.We also discussed four keywords you can use in evaluating ideas:

logical, feasible, desirable, and affordable.You can add to or subtract from this list to suit
your needs, but this is a good start.
Once you’ve developed your prioritized list of strategies or objectives, you have
to ﬁnd a way to translate that into reality. Strategies tell you where you’re headed;
next you have to determine how you’ll get there. We talked about ways of assessing
your current IT environment and mapping that to your prioritized objectives.That
helps you sort out where current activities belong in your new framework. Finally,
we discussed methods for taking all of that and creating an operational roadmap that
can be used on a daily or weekly basis to keep you on track. It would be a shame to
expend so much effort on creating a well-aligned strategy only to have the opera-
tions drive off in a different direction.
If this whole topic is new to you, it might seem like a tall order on top of every-
thing else you have to do. But, to paraphrase Steven Covey, if you don’t spend time
on important, non-urgent planning activities, you’ll sell yourself and your depart-
ment short. Learning to plan and strategize is an important part of being effective in
the business world and to be effective as an IT project manager. Hopefully now you
have a few new tools to help you on your way.

Overview of Corporate 
Strategy in Today’s Environment
 Due to economic changes in the past decade, IT departments and IT
activities no longer provide a de facto competitive advantage.
 To be successful in today’s business climate, you need to run your IT
department more like a business.Your IT efforts must support or extend
the corporate mission.
 CIOs today have a blend of business and IT experience, so it’s desirable to
improve your business skills.

Chapter 2 • What’s Corporate Strategy Got to Do with IT?

 Ideally, you should look for ways that IT can be leveraged to create new,
innovative strategies that further your corporate strategies rather than
simply align with them.
 Competitive advantage can come through the use of technology by driving
efﬁciency in execution, by lowering costs, or by innovation.
 Competitive advantage through technology innovation is often short-lived
in today’s fast-paced IT environment.
Understanding Your Company’s Strategy
 Most companies have a strategy, but not all have well-articulated strategies,
and not all have well-communicated strategies.
 In order to align IT activities with corporate strategies, you have to have
some understanding of your company’s strategic direction.
 There are numerous tools you can use to reverse engineer your company’s
strategies, though your best bet is to sit down with your boss or senior
management and simply ask.
Developing Your IT Strategy
 Before you can develop your IT strategy, you have to understand what’s
what.You can use various tools to analyze the current state of your IT
department (and your company, if you so choose) to give you a solid
starting point.
 Analyzing core competencies, performing a SWOT analysis or trend
analysis will help you determine what your department is good at and what
your strategic direction should be.
 Once you’ve analyzed where you are and where everything else is
(customers, competitors, technology, threats, opportunities, etc.), you can
ﬁnalize your strategic objectives.
 You can use the risk-reward grid as one way of categorizing your strategic
objectives.
 Your objectives or strategies should be prioritized based on agreed upon
priorities. If you’re not sure what should be ﬁrst, second, and third

priorities, sit down with your manager and discuss this. Mismatched
expectations about priorities cause lots of problems down the road.
Assessing Your Current IT Environment
 Once you have an idea of your strategic IT direction, you need to look at
your current IT environment and match things up.
 There are many ways you can categorize your IT efforts including strategic
versus operational efforts, long-term versus short-term, development versus
deployment, and more. Categories simply help you see what’s what.
Developing Your Operational Roadmap
 Your operational roadmap is the document or plan that tells you what
activities you must undertake in order to reach your strategic objectives. It
helps you choose the right activities based on limited time and resources.
 An operational roadmap (or ops plan) provides a day-to-day guide for
managing IT functions in a manner that will keep them aligned with IT
and corporate strategies.
Q: I’ve got an IT background and all this business information is making my
head swim. Isn’t there an easier way?
A: I’m assuming that you have a really strong IT background and I’m also
assuming you didn’t learn everything you know in one sitting. It takes time
to learn new skills and these skills might be using a few new brain cells.Take
your time, parse out the data into small chunks, and don’t move on until you
feel like you’ve got a handle on it all.You can’t learn about TCP/IP until you
understand binary math, right? You can’t develop an application until you
understand how to write an if/then loop.Take it one step at a time.

Q: Our company holds long planning retreats to come up with corporate
strategy.The information in this chapter makes it seem like it shouldn’t take
that long.
A: Developing a corporate strategy can be a long, complex, and difﬁcult task.
When markets and technologies and customers are changing rapidly, it can be
difﬁcult to see the road ahead. So, yes, it can be a long, difﬁcult task for cor-
porate leaders.That said, it’s not always that tough. It depends on many dif-
ferent factors including the market you’re in, the strengths of your company,
the company’s position in the marketplace, and more. However, if your com-
pany has a strategic plan to which you have access, your job is half done.
Creating the IT strategy is just that much easier because you already know
the direction the company is headed.Thus, you can develop your IT strate-
gies by using your corporate strategies as your starting point.
Q: I’m still not clear on the difference between a corporate strategy and a busi-
ness strategy. Can you clarify that for me?
A: Corporate strategy is developed from the top of the organization. It is a
vision of where the company is headed, what the company should be (or
become). However, companies don’t exist in a vacuum.They have to interact
with the outside world every day.That outside world is comprised of cus-
tomers, competitors, changing technology, regulations, and more. When com-
panies have to respond to these outside inﬂuences, they must develop
business strategies. Business strategies come from the business units or the
operations areas and inﬂuence corporate strategies. In a sense, they are a
unique subset of corporate strategies.
Q: What’s the difference between corporate strategies and IT strategies?
A: Corporate strategies set the course for the entire company.They describe
where the company as a whole is headed. IT strategies are a subset of corpo-
rate strategies.They are, essentially, corporate-level strategies that deal only
with the IT area of the business.

Q: What’s the difference between business strategies and business IT strategies?
A: Business strategies are developed in response to the external environment.
Companies must develop business strategies in order to remain responsive
and relevant in the marketplace. Business strategies might involve competing
on cost or increasing the level of service based on demands from the market.
Business IT strategies also arise as a response to the external market, but are
speciﬁcally related to IT.This might involve a decision to implement a partic-
ular application or use a particular technology platform because of demand in
the marketplace. Once these are determined you can create operational plans
to guide you through the day-to-day tasks required to accomplish these
strategies.
Q: Where can I ﬁnd out more about creating a strategic IT plan?
A: There are many resources available on strategic planning and almost any one
you choose can be applied to IT planning as well.There are books, courses
and Web resources available.A good place to start is with well-known, rep-
utable websites such as CIO.com, eWeek.com, ComputerWorld.com, and
TechRepublic.com, just to name a few.You can also work with an experi-
enced consultant to assist you in the development of your strategic plan.
Sometimes having a person external to the organization can be helpful
because they’ll approach things with a fresh perspective.

Introduction
In Chapter 2, we discussed what corporate strategy has to do with IT. Now we’re
going to look at how corporate politics impact IT projects and project management.
As an IT project manager, you often lack formal, organizational authority to accom-
plish your project’s objectives.This means that you have to know how your organi-
zation works, both formally (organizational chart) and informally (politics) in order
to get the best possible results. Politics affect which projects get priority or get
funded; politics impact which people and resources are assigned to projects, and poli-
tics certainly affect whether or not projects are successful. In this chapter, you’ll learn
why and how politics operate in organizations and you’ll gain insight and knowledge
that will help you navigate corporate politics more effectively. If you’re anxious to
jump right into IT project management, you can skip ahead to Chapter 5, but be
sure to come back and read these ﬁrst four chapters.They introduce you to critical
concepts about the environment that surrounds all IT projects and will help your IT
projects be more successful.
Some people thrive on corporate politics; others (including many in IT) would
rather chew nails than get involved in company politics.The truth is, if you work for
any company—small, medium or large—politics are a fact of life. Rather than hiding
your head in the sand, you can actually learn how to handle politics with conﬁdence
and grace (well, most of the time). If you hate everything about corporate politics,
this chapter is a must-read for you.You’ll learn how to navigate the sometimes
murky political waters and avoid most of the dangers along the way.After reading
this chapter, you’ll have the tools you need to succeed in a political environment,
even if you really dislike company politics.
Corporate Politics: A Primer
We all know corporate politics have a huge impact on which projects do and do not
get funded and even on the success of those projects, but few people ever want to
talk about it. Corporate politics are a fact of life and every company has a different
personality and different political dynamics. Most IT pros would be happiest if there
were no politics—after all, it’s all about the technology, isn’t it? Still, we all have to
work together toward a common goal and understanding the impact of politics on
the IT department can help you achieve your objectives.Though power and politics
are often seen as “dirty words” in the corporate world, they are a natural aspect of
life—in and out of the corporate world—and the more you know about how things
work, the better off you’ll fare. Most of us form a negative impression of politics and
power when they are used simply for self-promotion or ego enhancement. When
www.syngress.com

Chapter 3 • Navigating Corporate Politics

they’re used for the good of the company and everyone involved, they actually are
positive traits.A thorough discussion of corporate politics could ﬁll volumes, so we’re
only going to look at a few elements that might impact your IT department and
make a few suggestions for navigating the muddy waters of corporate politics.
First, let’s deﬁne three words: power, inﬂuence and politics. Power is, quite simply, the
ability to produce change or to get results. Inﬂuence is the exercise of that ability to
produce change. Politics has been deﬁned as the study of who gets what, when and
how. Politics is power and inﬂuence in action. Now, before you turn away in disgust,
let’s look at the positive uses of power, inﬂuence, and politics.
■
When someone uses his/her power and inﬂuence to persuade top execu-
tives to support an IT infrastructure upgrade because it will improve
everyone’s ability to get their jobs done.
■
When someone uses his/her power and inﬂuence to persuade department
heads to support doing a project for a local charity at no/low cost.
■
When someone uses his/her power and inﬂuence to convince employees of
the Marketing department to cooperate with employees in the IT
Development department to create an award-winning application for the
company.
You’d be hard-pressed to think that anyone misused power and inﬂuence to
accomplish these results. In fact, it’s typically only the negative experiences we have
that call attention to the darker side of power and inﬂuence.When things go well, we
tend to attribute that to other factors and ignore the fact that power and inﬂuence can
work toward positive, desirable outcomes.Throughout this chapter, words and phrases
such as “politics” or “highly political atmosphere” are used to indicate the negative
aspects of these types of activities. Unfortunately, we don’t have words that describe the
great things that happen when power and inﬂuence come together for the common
good.Though we talk about success, teamwork, or innovation, we rarely (if ever)
attribute these to a positive political environment.As you read through this chapter,
keep this in mind because power, inﬂuence, and politics don’t have to be negative. In
fact, if you talk to 100 people, 98 of them would probably say they prefer to work for
a powerful, inﬂuential boss.Why? Because powerful, inﬂuential people get things done
and people like to be around success.
The problems most people run into, though, are often the results of the misuse
of power and inﬂuence.The best defense is a good offense in this case, so we’re
going to look at the elements of power and inﬂuence and later in the chapter we’ll
look at speciﬁc methods you can use to analyze the political environment and tools
you can use to achieve your objectives.

Understanding Sources of Power
One of the most useful things you can do in a political environment is take time to
understand the sources of power. In this section, we’ll look at the basics and you can
use this knowledge to assess your own organization.You’ll ﬁnd that once you under-
stand the sources of power, you’re well on your way toward having the knowledge
and tools you need to work effectively in a political environment. Let’s look at these
sources of power:
■
Position
■
Information
■
Resource
■
Expertise
■
Performance
■
Personal traits
Positional Power 
The most commonly recognized source of power is positional or organizational power.
Your boss has power over you because he or she is your boss.The organization
bestows upon each position a certain amount of organizational authority.A person’s
position provides a set of responsibilities, access to information, and access to
resources.The position also provides a certain amount of authority to make change,
to act, and to direct the actions of others. If you recall our earlier deﬁnition of
power, it is the ability to enact change or to get things done.Thus, one’s position in
the organization comes with a certain amount of built-in power.
However, there are additional elements to positional power that are important to
recognize.These are:
■
How critical you are to a particular outcome
■
How relevant your position is to the organization’s priorities
■
How visible you are in the organization
■
How much discretion you have in your position
As you can imagine, someone who is very critical to an outcome is more powerful
that one who is not. If a particular engineer or software architect is key to a project’s
success, that person has more power than a peer who is not key to a project’s success.
www.syngress.com
74
Chapter 3 • Navigating Corporate Politics

One whose position is closely connected to the company’s priorities will have more
power than someone in a position that is not aligned with priorities. For instance, if
the company’s major focus is to improve efﬁciency and your IT group comes up
with a series of initiatives aimed at improving not only IT efﬁciency, but corporate
productivity as well, you’ll have more power and inﬂuence. Conversely, if you’re
working on a project that is highly innovative, but no one is sure yet if it will work
or if it will improve efﬁciency, the project could easily run into political interference
if the current focus is on efﬁciency.
Another element of positional power is the position’s visibility within the organi-
zation.The more visible a position is in a company, the more power it typically
holds. Visibility is often part of how people get promoted in companies. Visibility
can come from the position itself or from performance within the position (see the
section entitled,“Performance Power”). Visible positions may always be visible, as
many executive positions are, or they may be visible for a certain period of time.
Accountants are highly visible during the budget development cycle.An IT project
manager may be highly visible during the design, implementation, and management
of a key IT initiative. Working on cross-functional teams is often a way to gain some
visibility in the organization and can be a good way to improve your career progress.
Finally, the amount of ﬂexibility or discretion in your position also generally corre-
lates directly to the amount of power the position holds. Most managers have a certain
amount of ﬂexibility or discretion designed into their jobs. Back in the 1980’s there
was a movement toward empowering employees—to give them more ﬂexibility or
discretion. If you’ve ever called your credit card company to dispute something on
your statement, you’ve probably experienced folks who have almost no ﬂexibility or
discretion in their positions. On the contrary, companies known for the great service
they provide, including Nordstrom, Federal Express, LLBean, and ShopNatural, among
others, all empower their service staff to make decisions.They give them the ﬂexibility
and discretion needed to resolve all but the most difﬁcult customer service problems.
These folks do have power and the teams are more productive as a result (you’ll read
more about the beneﬁts of sharing power later in this chapter).
These additional components of positional power are important because it helps
us understand why some positions are (or appear to be) more powerful than others.
Positional power also comes from the fact that people in those positions often have
access to information and resources that others do not.This leads us to the next two
major sources of power in an organization.
www.syngress.com
Navigating Corporate Politics • Chapter 3
75

Information Power
Information is power in most companies. It is often, but not always, tied directly to
position.The more we know, the more we are able to work effectively in an organi-
zation.There are all kinds of information in organizations and almost all of it can be
useful. Knowing who’s preparing a key client presentation, knowing the current
quarter’s ﬁnancial results, knowing who the boss is looking at for the next big pro-
ject, knowing when the next round of budget cuts is coming, and so on, are all types
of information that can provide power in an organization. Here are two examples.
Purchasers for a company have information about suppliers, order status, or avail-
ability that others within the organization may need.An administrative assistant for
an executive has informational power because he or she knows the executive’s
schedule and can grant or deny access or information. In these cases, these positions
have access to needed information and this bestows upon the person in that position
a certain amount of power.
Information power, of course, is not absolute. Information tends to get stale
pretty quickly these days, so information power is often time-sensitive. If you know
that the boss is about to approve a budget for a new project, that might provide
some measure of power until your boss announces it. Other types of information
power are less transitory. If you’re part of a cross-functional team that meets monthly
to discuss a particular corporate initiative, you have information that is not generally
available to others in the company, even if a meeting summary is distributed.
It’s important to understand the nature of information power because informa-
tion ﬂow is often used in political maneuvers. Sometimes information is withheld in
order to make others less informed and therefore more vulnerable to misinformation
or manipulation. Sometimes misinformation is disseminated in order to make others
look bad or to throw others off the track. Unfortunately, these negative aspects of
information power are used in organizations, which is why it’s important to under-
stand this source of power so you can use it in a positive, beneﬁcial manner and
counteract those who might try to use it for lesser purposes.
Resource Power
Most managerial positions have resource power because these positions have access
to and control over organizational resources.These positions have the ability to grant
or deny raises (money is one of the most important resources), promotions, key
assignments, excused absences, and work assignments. Non-managers may also have
resource power—the clerk responsible for purchasing ofﬁce supplies, the administra-
tive assistant responsible for submitting reimbursement requests, the purchaser who
www.syngress.com
76
Chapter 3 • Navigating Corporate Politics

can get special deals from a vendor—all of these people have resource power to
some degree or another.As with other forms of power, misuse of this source of
power can lead to problems. If your key vendor’s invoices are being held up or if
your ability to purchase spare computer parts is limited by a purchasing clerk, your
ability to get your job done effectively can be diminished. If this is the case, you may
try to determine what you can do to convince the person with resource power to
use their power to your beneﬁt. Later in this chapter, we’ll discuss methods of inﬂu-
ence and ways you can negotiate with this person to get better access to needed
resources (hint: this typically involves giving something the other party needs in
exchange for getting what you need).
Expertise Power
Expertise is the specialized knowledge someone has, whether it was gained through
experience, training, or formal education. Clearly, someone with needed expertise
has a certain amount of power.The IT technician who knows how to ﬁx your e-
mail problem has power when your e-mail goes down.The copier technician is in a
powerful position when the copier jams on copy 125 of 800. Financial analysts have
a lot of power around budget time. Notice that few sources of power are ﬁxed—
they are relative to many other factors.The copier technician may have power when
the copier jams but has very little power if there are ﬁve other suitable copiers
nearby or a copy shop on the corner next to your ofﬁce.
One important thing to note about the power that comes from expertise is that
it is often the only power a new hire has. He or she does not have a network of
relationships upon which to rely, so he or she probably doesn’t have information or
resource power.This is good to understand because a new hire must leverage his or
her expertise in order to gain other forms of power within the organization, so you
may see someone new to the company overusing his or her expertise power.
Overuse of this power can cause someone to come off as an overbearing “know-it-
all.”As with other forms of power, the overuse or over-reliance on this form of
power can have an opposite effect. Instead of respecting the expert, people in the
organization may come to ignore or shun that person because he or she is aggres-
sively asserting his or her expertise and perhaps not allowing adequate room for dis-
cussion, dissention, and team input.
Performance Power
Performance power is just as you might expect—you can derive a certain amount of
power from turning in exceptional results.A track record of outstanding perfor-
mance can give you the ability to inﬂuence not only your own future, but that of
www.syngress.com
Navigating Corporate Politics • Chapter 3
77

the project, department, or company. For instance, you might be asked to participate
in an innovative new project or you might be asked your opinion on a variety of
topics. Strong performance also enhances your reputation with peers and perhaps
others outside your direct sphere of inﬂuence as well. Just as people typically enjoy
working for a powerful boss, people also enjoy associating with top performers.This
inclination to view strong performers in a positive light is the source of performance
power and inﬂuence.
The downside of performance power is similar to expertise power. If you per-
form above and beyond normal expectations on a consistent basis, you may be
threatening to some people, especially poorer performers. It’s possible you don’t need
to be concerned with poor performers, but what if that person is your manager?
Then your outstanding results might only serve, by contrast, to highlight the poor or
mediocre job your manager is turning in and this could be a problem. Most of the
time, however, when you deliver outstanding results, it’s not only good results for the
company, but for you as well.
Personal Traits Power
You might call this personality power or personal attraction power, but whatever
term you use, it has to do with personal traits that provide power within an organi-
zation.The ﬁrst that might come to mind is physical appearance.An interesting note
about looks is that it is true that “good looking” people tend to get more breaks and
opportunities, but people who are “too good looking” are often seen as less intelli-
gent. Fair or not, these are biases that impact personal power. How one dresses is also
part of personal traits and is related to personal power.Again, there are some inter-
esting dichotomies here. If you dress “above” your position, you’re more likely to be
considered for a promotion, but less likely to be accepted by your peers. If you dress
impeccably, whether your company requires casual or formal business attire, you may
be seen as less capable.The thought is that people who are “too well groomed” are
less intelligent or less capable. If you consistently dress in a manner that is outside the
norms for your company, you may be seen as less of a team player. For instance, if
you work at a company where jeans and t-shirts are the norm and you consistently
wear a suit, you may be seen as snobbish, not a team player, or someone only inter-
ested in moving up the ladder.This can work against you. However, if the dress code
is jeans and a t-shirt and you wear khakis and a polo shirt, you’re more likely to be
viewed as a part of the team, even if you stand out in a positive way.The obvious
statements also hold true. If you dress “below” your position, your work may be
viewed in a more negative light. If you consistently dress below company standards,
www.syngress.com
78
Chapter 3 • Navigating Corporate Politics

you may have trouble getting your work to be taken seriously or to be judged fairly.
It’s quite relative to the norms of your company or department.
Beyond the physical characteristics, there are several key attributes that bestow
personal power to individuals. Research indicates that there are behaviors and traits
that we associate with “likeability” and the more likeable someone is, the more per-
sonal power he or she has. Some of the traits that may cause us to like someone are
honesty, acceptance, supportiveness, similarity of values, and willingness to endure
costs for the relationship. People who are seen as likeable are judged to be more
effective speakers and they are more likely to get the beneﬁt of the doubt in a per-
formance appraisal. So, it may literally pay to be nice.
There is a downside to being too likable or too nice and that is the danger of
being perceived as gullible or naïve. While being likeable is a positive trait and can
be the source of a certain amount of power, it must be balanced with getting the job
done.As a manager, being likeable is tricky. On the one hand, if your boss or others
in the organization consider you to be likeable, you can derive a certain amount of
power and inﬂuence from that. On the other hand, as a manager, it’s not your job to
be liked. New managers often are torn because they want their team to like them,
but they often ﬁnd that things like reprimanding and managing run contrary to
being liked. It is a ﬁne balance, but as a manager, you can do your job effectively and
still have you staff like you. Just don’t get trapped into being a manager who is well-
liked ﬁrst and effective second.This holds true for IT project managers as well.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Now that you understand the various sources of power in an organiza-
tion, you can start taking inventory. How much power do you have?
What about your manager? As you probably can see by now, if your
manager lacks several of these sources of power, you may be at a disad-
vantage because power is relative. If your boss’s position is seen as pow-
erful, then your position bestows upon you more power than a peer
who works for a less powerful manager. You may also discover other
sources of power such as expertise, information, resources or personal
power that you weren’t aware you had. Most powerful people in organi-
zations have developed multiple sources of power since few sources of
power are absolute and unchanging. Understanding who has what types
of power (including you and your manager) will give you a much better
feel for how things run in your company. It gives you insight into why
things are the way they are and how you might inﬂuence them (see next
section) for better results.

Understanding Methods of Inﬂuence
Power is the ability to get things done, and inﬂuence is using power to get things
done. We’ve all felt inﬂuence at work in our jobs, whether it was a department man-
ager trying to persuade us to move her project to the top of the priority list or one
of your staffers trying to get a key assignment. Inﬂuence is used all the time and is
really how things get done. In this section, we’re going to look at three key methods
of inﬂuencing people and we’ll discuss which ones work best and which are best to
avoid.As with power, these methods can be used appropriately to generate results or
they can be overused or abused. Understanding methods of inﬂuence helps you spot
them when they’re being used on you and also helps you use them effectively to get
better results.
Threats
The least desirable method of inﬂuencing is to threaten someone.You can threaten
someone directly or indirectly.You can say,“Your raise depends upon how well you
do at the client site,” or you can say,“I’m expecting a lot from you tomorrow.”
While threats as a method of inﬂuence may sound very negative and manipulative,
the fact is there is a certain amount of threat built into every corporate structure. We
all know on a very basic level that if we don’t perform, if we don’t do as expected
that we aren’t likely to get a raise, bonus, or promotion, or worse, that we can lose
our jobs.That’s an implicit threat and we all pretty much accept that. However,
when used to manipulate us into doing something we don’t want to do, threats are
perceived as negative. In fact, that’s true about any use of power. When we are forced
to do something against our will or against our own self-interest, we typically view
power negatively. Conversely, when we do something aligned with our desires or
that furthers our own self-interests, we view power in a positive light.
Here’s the downside of using threats: they will force compliance but not commit-
ment.Think about it. If you have the power to force someone to do something, they
will likely comply. However, they are not likely to be committed to the action or
decision because they were forced into it. Compliance may be all you need in a par-
ticular situation. If the report needs to be completed by noon, you don’t need a
commitment, you need the report completed by noon (compliance). If you need all
e-mail users to log off by midnight on Friday so you can upgrade the server, you
don’t need commitment, you need compliance.The threat in that case is that if you
don’t log off, we’re taking the server down and anything you were working on
might be lost.The threat, in this case, is rather benign. Notice that you can present

this information in one of two ways.You can send out an e-mail that says,“The e-
mail server is going down at midnight on Friday. Log off before then or lose any-
thing you’re working on. E-mail will be back up by Saturday 10:00 A.M.”That
e-mail will force compliance, but is perhaps not the best presentation.To make the
threat more palatable, you could instead send this e-mail:“In order to provide faster
e-mail response and more storage space for your e-mail, we’re upgrading the server
this weekend. Please log off e-mail prior to Friday at midnight so you don’t lose any
important work. We anticipate bringing the new server back up and restoring e-mail
service to you no later than Saturday 10:00 A.M. If you have any questions, please
contact IT at extension 1234.Thanks for your cooperation. Signed, your friendly IT
group.” Both e-mails threaten to cut off service at midnight, but one will be seen as
curt and the other seen as a positive, friendly message.Threats need not be heavy
handed and as you can see, they’re sometimes quite appropriate.
You typically need commitment when you need to get something done over a
longer period of time or you need to gain agreement before proceeding. We’ll dis-
cuss gaining commitment in a moment. Making threats will almost never result in
commitment, so generally speaking, threats are not your best option most of the
time.They generate short-term compliance.They can be delivered in a positive
manner that generates willing rather than resentful compliance.As you can see from
the previous example, a threat is sometimes exactly what’s needed. It wouldn’t be
helpful to try to get commitment from people to log off their e-mail, all you need is
compliance and the threat (presented in a polite and positive manner) gets the best
result.That should be your goal whenever using threats as your method of inﬂu-
ence—to generate compliance without generating resentment.
Exchange or Barter
There are many commonly used expressions for the normal (and desirable) exchange
or barter that operates in all companies. Some of these expressions are,“Help me out
today, will you?”“You owe me big time!”“What’s it going to cost me?”“How long
am I going to have to pay for this one?” or “I’ll put in a good word for you.”These
kinds of expressions demonstrate the normal exchange between individuals in a
company.This type of exchange is a form of inﬂuence. We use whatever power we
have—information, resources, position—and attempt to exchange it for what we
need.Again, there’s nothing sinister in this unless it’s used for purely selﬁsh power-
building reasons. Otherwise, it’s how business gets done; it’s the art of the deal. We
negotiate every day for what we need and this exchange system works pretty well.
The informal balance of trade in organizations helps people extend and call in
favors. If you owe someone a favor, you can be inﬂuenced to take action on that
www.syngress.com
Navigating Corporate Politics • Chapter 3
81

person’s behalf.That wipes out the debt and the person to whom you owed a favor
was able to inﬂuence your behavior for that interaction. Similarly, we can use
exchange or barter for future beneﬁt—I’ll do this today in exchange for you doing
something for me later on. It’s a good system and is actually the primary inﬂuence
system at work in most companies today.
Here’s the downside to using exchange as a method of inﬂuence: you have to
have something the other person needs. Just like any exchange or barter system,
what you have to offer and what the other person needs must match up in order to
make an exchange. In an organization, you have to ﬁgure out how your “inventory”
matches up with others’ needs in order to make an effective exchange to get what
you need. In addition, it’s helpful to know what you have that others need so you
can make an exchange.The exchange can be immediate or it can be banked for
future use. If you can’t discern what the other person needs or what you have that
might be of value in an exchange, you’ll have difﬁculty using exchange effectively in
your organization. Since this is a very common (and typically fair and aboveboard)
method of wielding power and inﬂuence, it’s worth understanding it consciously.
Most of us have worked, with varying degrees of success, using the exchange and
barter methods, but we perhaps have never taken time to examine the inner work-
ings. In order to use this method successfully, you’ll need to ﬁgure out who you
need to inﬂuence and the balance of trade in that relationship.
It’s also worth noting that sometimes the exchange can be simple human inter-
action. When you are consistently nice to the receptionist as you come in each day
and you later need a favor, he or she may be more inclined to help you out than if
you walked by and nodded every day. Do you know the receptionist’s name? Do
you talk with him or her on occasion? It’s not always what we can give someone on
a tangible level that creates the exchange, but what we give through human interac-
tion.And let’s face it, techies are sometimes so engrossed in their current technolog-
ical challenge that they fail to notice the people around them. Paying attention to
your personal interactions can generate this exchange “currency” as well.

Chapter 3 • Navigating Corporate Politics

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Since exchange or barter is the primary currency of inﬂuence in an orga-
nization, you can begin to look at your exchange balance with a critical
eye. Are you usually on the giving or receiving end of the exchange? Do
you know how to call in favors? Do you know how to extend a favor
“with strings attached”? Some people are good at the outgoing
exchange part, but not so good at the incoming exchange part. Learning
to effectively call in and extend favors will increase your effectiveness.
And no, this is not manipulative; this is simply how business gets done.
If you’re the one who’s constantly doing things for others but never col-
lecting on the balance due, you’re losing out on an important source of
inﬂuence. This type of inﬂuence works up, down, and across the organi-
zation, so it’s one of the most versatile tools you have available to you.
There are many resources available to you—in books and on the Web—
to learn to improve your ability to negotiate and inﬂuence people. It
might be valuable to you to learn how to manage this process more
effectively than perhaps you have in the past. Managing this process
simply helps you be more effective and successful and if you’re working
for the good of your team, department, and company, it’s likely to yield
the desired, positive results.
Appeals to Values, Emotions, or Reason
If the U.S. Presidential election of 2004 is any indication, appealing to values and
emotions works. People across the political spectrum were bombarded with appeals
to their values and emotions. While in politics these appeals often are or appear to
be disingenuous, in corporate politics they can be another viable way of wielding
inﬂuence.Think about this. If your boss comes to you and says,“You agreed to com-
plete this code in time for the upcoming release and I know you always keep your
word,” your manager is appealing to your values—that of keeping your word, of
being honest.Your boss might also be appealing to your emotions—your desire to
avoid feeling bad for not keeping your word, your desire to feel good about yourself
(ego). Let’s look at another example.Your company is in a competitive bid process
and you feel you’re the best person to develop the proposal.You remind your boss
that the last time he or she let someone else complete the proposal it was poorly
done, late, and lost the contract for the company.This is an appeal to emotions and
perhaps to reason.The emotional part is your boss wanting to avoid another embar-

rassing situation (which he or she will almost certainly have to explain to someone
up the ladder) and the reasoning part is that it is reasonable to assign someone more
capable to a key project if the previous person failed or underperformed.Again,
these can be used in very manipulative ways, but they can be used for positive rea-
sons as well. When charities raise money, they have no direct power over you or
your checkbook.They wield the only power they have—an appeal to shared values,
an appeal to emotion or an appeal to reason.These are very effective, legitimate tools
and they’re used with good results all the time. When done in an open, honest
manner, you have a choice to respond to these appeals or not.Therefore, this method
of inﬂuence is less likely to be perceived as manipulative, though there’s still ample
opportunity for this method to be used in an underhanded manner. When someone
appeals to your values, emotions or reason when they themselves do not believe
what they’re saying, it is often manipulative (or will be perceived as such).Appealing
to values and emotions can certainly inspire commitment and get you to go “above
and beyond” to generate results beyond mere compliance.
Appealing to reason is another way to inspire commitment.As mentioned ear-
lier, using threats gets compliance but not commitment. Using reason gets commit-
ment (and usually also compliance) and when commitment is critical (as it is in most
IT projects), appealing to reason is a good tool to have at your disposal.The other
attractive quality to appealing to reason is that it typically is all aboveboard. It’s
harder to manipulate (or be manipulated) if you’re appealing to reason because the
other party can think through the logic and agree or not.This is exactly why
appealing to reason fosters commitment—the other party has thought about it and
agreed with your perspective. Now your cause is their cause, in a sense, and this can
generate a longer-term commitment than other types of inﬂuence might.
The downside examples of appealing to values, emotions, or reason are the ones
that people tend to remember and ﬁxate on. Most charismatic leaders appeal to
values and emotions and can manipulate people quite effectively, especially if the
leader does not actually share those values but simply uses them to get you do as
they wish. I’m sure we can all think of people who have used this type of inﬂuence
for personal gain, but that doesn’t make the method inherently bad.Another down-
side of this type of inﬂuence is that you have to know what someone’s values are
before you can appeal to them.You also have to know what emotions are likely to
get that person ﬁred up. If you’ve ever been in a team meeting where you left
feeling ﬁred up and ready to take on the next challenge, you’ve been inﬂuenced via
an appeal to values, emotions or reason. Were you manipulated? Not unless the
reason for someone getting your team all ﬁred up was malicious, self-serving, uneth-
ical, or illegal. Is it unethical or manipulative for an NFL coach to give an inspiring
www.syngress.com
84
Chapter 3 • Navigating Corporate Politics

speech in the locker room before a big game? No, but he’s certainly appealing to
values and emotion to get the job done.Appropriate appeals to values, emotions
and/or reason can help foster a strong, cohesive team.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
You probably have appealed to people’s values, emotions, or reason in
the past and achieved the results you wanted. The question is: did you
do so for the common good or for your own good? It’s not always easy
to tell and sometimes we fool ourselves into thinking it’s for the
common good when it’s not. However, now that you understand this
source of inﬂuence and power, you can monitor your own behavior and
make sure you always stay “inside the lines.” On the other side of
things, you’ll be much better armed to deﬂect disingenuous appeals to
your values, emotion, or reason now that you understand a bit more
about this type of inﬂuence. Later in this chapter, you’ll read an example
of how this is commonly used in the project management arena—
appealing to emotions (and ego is part of that) to get you to take that
project that no one wants.
The Power Paradox
Power is an interesting and complex subject to study, especially in organizations,
because it is full of contradictions. Here are two good examples: Have you ever
known someone with positional power who was completely powerless? Have you
ever known an administrative assistant (or equivalent) that was the “go to” person
and had tremendous informal power? Most of us have experienced these two
extremes.There are several interesting dynamics related to power that are worth dis-
cussing so you understand the power dynamics in your company as well as how to
(or not to) wield your own inﬂuence.
■
Organizations work better when people have more power. When
people are powerless, they are less motivated, have less commitment, and
tend to dislike their jobs.They tend to rely heavily on rules and regulations
and the environment becomes petty or dictatorial. Most people prefer
working for a powerful boss because he or she does not rely solely on rules
and regulations, but fosters an environment of interest, commitment, and
appropriate professional challenges (opportunities to learn).

■
Overuse of organizational power reduces that power. These are the
people who often inspire contempt because they don’t know how to use
any type of power except that bestowed upon them by their position.They
often lord that power over people and as a result, their effectiveness dimin-
ishes.Again, they may be able to demand short-term compliance, but that’s
all they’ll get and even that will diminish over time.
■
Frequent use of power leads to a distorted sense of power. People
that often use power inappropriately to get results tend to develop an over-
sized sense of power and self.They tend to see themselves as more impor-
tant and more key to the organization than they really are.The ancient
expression “Pride goeth before the fall” is appropriate here.The overuse of
any form of power eventually backﬁres, especially when that overuse stems
from self-serving motives.
■
The more you share your power, the more powerful you become.
This is a very interesting notion, especially for those power misers who
believe just the opposite. Managers who share power with subordinates
generate increased commitment and improved group performance. Shared
power helps people learn to make better decisions, which not only helps
them as individual performers, but helps the group perform at a higher
level as well.As an IT manager, a team that is empowered will help you
make better decisions by “pushing back” when you propose something
ﬂawed (or ﬂat out wrong).As individuals and the team perform better, the
manager is perceived as a better manager and is bestowed more organiza-
tional power (typically in the form of information and resources).
Working Effectively 
in a Political Environment
Now that we’ve taken a good look at power and inﬂuence, we can begin to see what
politics is all about. People are complex beings and they often blend good and not-so-
good intentions all in the same mix. In order to effectively navigate the politics in your
company, you ﬁrst have to understand sources of power and inﬂuence, which we just
covered. Next, you need to develop strategies for maintaining (or increasing) your
power in genuine ways that beneﬁt the organization. Here’s a good analogy: If you
donate money to charity, do you take a tax deduction? If the answer is yes, does taking
the tax deduction make the donation any less noble or good? Of course not.When
the actions we take serve the company and our own self-interests, there is (generally
www.syngress.com
86
Chapter 3 • Navigating Corporate Politics

speaking) no inherent problem just as there is no problem doing something noble
(charitable donation) and taking the tax deduction (self-serving).At the risk of repeti-
tion, none of these concepts or actions is inherently good or bad; it’s how they’re used
that determines their ultimate “goodness” or “badness.” In this section, we’re going to
look at several strategies you might choose to use to navigate through the political
waters.These are not the only methods, just a few to get you started.
Accept That Politics Exist
The ﬁrst tool you’ll need in working effectively is to accept that politics exist wher-
ever there are two or more people working together.As mentioned, most of people’s
discomfort around power and inﬂuence stems from the abuse or misuse of power.At
its worst, power is an end in itself.At its highest form, power can be used to create
positive change in an organization. When we refer negatively to power and politics,
we’re typically discussing an environment in which political activity is devoted to the
acquisition of personal power, which is a waste of time and resources that could be
better applied toward accomplishing organizational goals.
However, when power and politics are applied toward accomplishing organiza-
tional goals, they produce much better results. When they are aligned with organiza-
tional goals, people tend to feel motivated, connected and energized. So, if you
understand that power and politics themselves are not necessarily bad, you can learn
how to use them to accomplish organizational goals. Forewarned is forearmed, so
learning about how power and politics work in your organization will contribute to
your ability to get things done. If you blithely refuse to admit that politics exist or
that they impact your chances for success, you’ll be far less effective than you might
otherwise be.
Develop Positive Relationships
One of the easiest ways to survive corporate politics is to develop genuine, positive
relationships with people inside and outside of your department. Have coffee or lunch
with people outside your immediate circle. Greet the receptionist or the
shipping/receiving clerk by name. Get to know others in your organization besides the
ones you work with on a daily basis.Take time before or after meetings to engage in
appropriate conversation with people you don’t always come in contact with. Not
only will you meet a few folks you might genuinely like, you’ll build important rela-
tionships with people across your organization. Now, those of you who are naturally
suspicious might be thinking,“That’s not very sincere—to get to know people so you
can get something from them.”That’s true; it’s not sincere if you do it for that reason.
That’s not what’s being suggested. Get to know people and develop positive relation-

87

ships because it’s interesting, because it makes your job easier, because you’ll enjoy
going to work, and because it may also beneﬁt you at some point in the future.
Another way IT folks can develop positive relationships is to take time to really
understand what others in the company do. People love to talk about themselves and
their jobs, so take time to listen.You might also gain genuine insight into that job or
department that you can use when you implement a related IT project in the future.
The more you understand what everyone in the company does, the better you can
do your job, so taking time to develop relationships is a great starting point.
In any business relationship, there’s always some give and take. Doing favors and
helping out others in need can not only foster positive relationships, but can help
you out in times of political turmoil. Of course, setting appropriate boundaries for
favors is important, too. Some are small favors of convenience and have little residual
impact other than the person “owes you one.” Other favors are bigger and may have
a negative impact on other departments or on the organization as a whole. If you
favor one person or group over another and it has a negative impact on those that
did not receive the special treatment, resentment will usually result.That’s when you
begin to tread dangerously close to our deﬁnition of negative politics.You need to
be careful about how favors and special treatment may impact others. Finally, some
favors cross all boundaries and are unethical or illegal. Don’t even go there.That said,
we do favors for each other everyday and this is part of the exchange/barter system
that naturally helps things get done at work.
Develop Your Exchange
Understanding how you exchange information, resources, and inﬂuence in the orga-
nization can help you understand what you have to offer and what you have to gain
through these kinds of mutually beneﬁcial transactions. Most of us do this naturally,
but doing so more consciously may lead to better results. For example, though not in
your job description, you’re really good at Microsoft Access and you assist a col-
league in the purchasing department with creating a small database.Your expertise in
Microsoft Access is part of the exchange.The next time you need purchasing to
expedite a purchase order for an IT purchase, you will likely ﬁnd that the purchaser
is happy to do so because you helped him/her out previously.
It’s also good to know what you will and will not exchange. For instance, though
you might be really good with Microsoft Access, as director of IT for your company, it
is probably not appropriate for you to develop a database for a purchaser. In this case,
you might offer to have one of your staff develop the database so the purchaser still
“owes” you, but it’s not a direct trade.Again, we don’t usually do things so that
someone will owe us—we do it because we have the skills, time, or talent to help out
www.syngress.com
88
Chapter 3 • Navigating Corporate Politics

and helping out others greases the wheels of the company.The residual effect is that
the purchaser is more inclined to help out in the future and there’s nothing wrong
with that.Avoid using your balance of trade to strong-arm people into returning a
favor that puts them in a bind.The exchange or barter can be powerful ways to get
things done, but be aware that you can take this too far and put people in difﬁcult sit-
uations by demanding they return a favor in a speciﬁc manner.
Listen Carefully
Listening is a skill that takes a bit of practice.You might hear the words, but are you
really listening to the meaning? Along with words come tone of voice, speed, choice
of words, choice of content (what to say and what not to say), positioning (also
known as “spin”), and body language, to name just a few variables. Make a habit of
listening to the speaker for words, content, and tone.You might be surprised by how
much more information you glean about the political environment by listening in
this manner. Sometimes it’s not what someone says, but what she doesn’t say that
becomes important, especially in highly political organizations.This kind of listening
takes practice because it requires that you look for what’s not there—and sometimes
there’s no way to know that. However, if you simply spend more time really lis-
tening, you’ll improve your listening skills and you’ll know more than you might
otherwise. Someone once said,“Listen twice as often as you speak,” and in a political
environment, you might want to bump it up to a three to one ratio.
Communicate More, Not Less
When things aren’t going so well, we tend to want to either close ourselves in a
room to think or take decisive action to resolve the problem. Regardless of what the
situation calls for, make sure you communicate clearly, honestly, and effectively.
Communicating too little allows rumors, half-truths, and ﬂat-out lies to travel at the
speed of light through the company. Communicating frequently, especially when
there’s a problem, will cut those rumors off at the knees and give you the opportu-
nity to bring the truth into the light of day. While you might not be comfortable
with the truth when things are going wrong (especially if it’s your fault), it’s always
better than the alternative. Learning how to communicate bad news can also help.
For instance, there are two ways you can notify people of a system problem.You can
say, essentially,“The server is down and we don’t yet know when it will be back up,”
or you can say,“We’re working on the server that went down this morning at 10:00
A.M. and we’ll keep you informed of our progress in diagnosing and repairing the
problem.” Which one sounds better to you? They’re both true, but one has a positive
“spin” on it, which leaves people with a sense of conﬁdence that the problem is
www.syngress.com
Navigating Corporate Politics • Chapter 3
89

being handled.The ﬁrst example leaves a lot to be desired in terms of effective com-
munication, but it’s the most common type of communication people get when
there are problems. IT people often prefer to go work on some code or rebuild a
server to talking with people, so working on developing and improving this one skill
can go a long way in helping you survive corporate politics.
Know What Not To Say
Sometimes enthusiastically endorsing something or someone turns out to be a ter-
rible decision. Other times making disparaging remarks turns out to be a bad deci-
sion. If your corporate climate is such that the winds shift from time to time, make
sure you know what’s going on before you jump in with your opinion. Often
knowing when to speak up and when to remain silent is one key to success in orga-
nizational politics. We’ve all been in a situation where we speak up because we
believe we have good information only to later discover our information was incor-
rect or incomplete.These kinds of situations are sometimes caused by people inten-
tionally misinforming us, but other times it’s just a matter of bad data. In either case,
make sure you have the information you need and are conﬁdent it’s correct before
speaking too strongly either for or against a proposal.That doesn’t mean you can’t
voice a strong opinion, just stop and think about the potential political consequences
before speaking.This goes back to the ﬁrst suggestion—admitting that politics exists.
Knowing what to say and what not to say also relates to choice of words.We’ve all
had the experience of saying something that was correct or accurate, but was said in an
unfortunate way.Afterward, we sit wondering how we could possibly have said it in
that manner (the old “open mouth, insert foot” routine).We’re especially prone to mis-
speaking when under pressure—during job interviews, difﬁcult meetings, or uncom-
fortable confrontations.Take a moment to stop and think about what you want to say
and then think about how you want to say it.An awkward silence is always better than
an unfortunate comment. If the network goes down because someone really made a
huge mistake, you might choose to say it was due to “an oversight” rather than “an
error.” Both are probably accurate, but the word oversight leaves the listener with more
conﬁdence than the word mistake does.The intent is not to deceive, but to avoid
throwing gasoline on an already smoldering ﬁre.Your choice of words can certainly be
used to misdirect or deceive, but they can also be used to set the appropriate tone so
sensitive situations remain under control.
If you accept that you work in a political environment, you’re more likely to think
about political consequences before jumping headlong into the ﬁre.That said, don’t let
awareness of the political environment paralyze you.You’ll take your lumps when
you’re wrong, but if you’ve developed genuine relationships and an awareness of the
political environment, you’re likely to survive with only a few bumps and scratches.

Share The Power
Those who share power end up with more power, in most situations. While you
may need to exercise care when sharing power, it’s a good idea to look at where you
can and should share power and when it’s best to hold on to it. Look around the
organization for examples of people who’ve shared power. Were they managers or
non-managers? Did it beneﬁt them or did it hurt them? In some highly negative,
political environments, sharing power can be tricky. However, if you can ﬁnd appro-
priate ways to share power, you’re more likely to end up on the winning end of the
deal.The saying “trust, but verify” is a good one to keep in mind here. Start off with
small increments of shared power and verify that the trust and shared power is used
appropriately. Once you see a track record of your team (or individuals) being trust-
worthy, you can give them more power.As you do so, you empower them to do a
better job and most of the time your results will improve as well.
Know Your Personal Values
It’s a good idea to sit down and think about what you would or would not do in
hypothetical work situations. Playing “what if” can give you insights into your per-
sonal values and limits. When you know ﬁrmly what your own limits are, you can
make sure that when you run into a political situation, you make decisions based on
your own values. While you might not make the most politically correct decision, it
will be one you can live with later on. Sometimes the only right answer is the one
you can live with.
Plan On Politics Impacting Your Job
In most companies, you’ll be judged by two criteria: quality and politics. If you plan
on politics playing a role in how your work is perceived, you won’t take the naïve
stance that your work should or will be judged solely on quality. In a perfect world,
our work would be judged only on its merits, but that rarely is the case. Pretending
politics doesn’t exist or won’t affect you is the best way to be blindsided by political
events within your company. Making some effort to understand the political envi-
ronment and accepting that your job performance will be perceived through the
political ﬁlter will help you come out ahead.
Be Aware of Political Change
Political change can happen slowly over time or it can happen quickly overnight.
This change can help or hinder you. If you’re associated with someone with a lot of
www.syngress.com
Navigating Corporate Politics • Chapter 3
91

political power and he or she leaves the company suddenly, you could be left out in
the cold. Unfortunately, people who are aligned with someone who falls out of favor
also tend to fall out of favor. On the other hand, if someone leaves and that creates a
gap in the organization, you could be standing in just the right spot. Being aware of
what’s going on around you and which way the political winds are blowing is
important. While you may not always be able to gauge what’s going to happen next
or who’s going to fall out of favor, you often can see signs of change and be pre-
pared. If a project is suddenly cancelled (for political reasons or otherwise), you may
see an opportunity to use those now idle resources for another project.There’s a
saying that luck is when preparation and opportunity meet, so if you’re keeping your
eyes open and you’re prepared, you may ﬁnd that changing political environments
actually create opportunities for you.
Enterprise 128…
Beware of Ego-Boosters
In every company, at one time or another, there comes a big, complex project
that no one else seems to have taken on or a project that is on the brink of
failure. Your boss (or top corporate executive) comes to you, appealing to your
company loyalty, your supreme project management expertise, and the promise
of glory if you’ll just take on this project. Beware. First, make sure you notice
when someone is appealing to your ego. We all love it, but it’s sometimes just a
way of getting us to feel so good about ourselves we are ready to take on the
world (and that very ugly project). These folks may be appealing to your values,
emotions, or reason in an attempt (legitimate or not) to get you to do something
they want you to do.
Projects that have not found a suitable home, that have not gotten a
“good” project manager to sign on, or that have failed and are now being re-
vamped and offered around can be signs of serious political issues. Though it’s
not always the case, it’s good to keep your eyes open and your ego in check
when this comes up. If others have failed on a project, why? Was it really because
that project manager was not able to successfully complete the project (as you
might be told) or were there corporate politics at play that caused the failure?
While you may not be able to ﬁnd out the whole story, start asking appropriate
questions before you sign on. Otherwise, you might ﬁnd yourself holding a polit-
ical bombshell with nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. If possible, it’s better
to respectfully decline. If that’s not an option, do your homework to ﬁnd out the

politics behind the scenes so you don’t run into the same problems your prede-
cessor(s) did. If you are able to discern the reasons for failure and believe you can
address these issues effectively, you may still choose to take on these “chal-
lenged” projects. Just don’t be fooled by ﬂattery and ego-boosting chats - look
at the facts and make informed decisions.
Breaking Up Political Logjams
Corporate politics and power determine which projects get funded, which get priority,
which get support, which get the best people, etcetera. IT projects are often “politically
challenged” for two primary reasons.The ﬁrst is that IT is seen as a cost center. From a
political standpoint, few people are going to stand up and staunchly defend something
that is seen as doing little more than costing a bundle of money.We discussed this to
some extent in Chapter 2 when we looked at aligning IT strategy with corporate
strategy. IT projects also run into political problems when IT is not seen as important
(or strategic) to the business.Again, if you take the steps delineated in Chapter 2, IT
will be viewed as a more integral and necessary (not necessary evil) part of the com-
pany. If the IT projects are seen as strategic, those with political capital are more likely
to defend or support them. In this section, we’re going to discuss strategies you can use
to break up some of the political logjams that might be hindering your IT projects.
These methods might not solve every political problem you encounter, but they’ll give
you a great set of tools to use as a starting point.
High-Level Sponsorship
In Chapter 1, you learned about the top eight reasons projects tend to succeed or
fail. Executive sponsorship was listed as the most important factor for project success.
So it should be no surprise that having high-level support in the organization, both
for yourself and for your projects, is an important element in overcoming political
obstacles. Executives have organizational, information, and resource power.They can
work on your behalf to ensure projects get the resources they need when they need
them. Executive support can also help you overcome politics lower in the organiza-
tion. It’s unlikely that your boss (or your boss’s peer) is going to try to block some-
thing that a senior executive supports.
One very important note about executive support is this—always attempt to go
through your manager or direct supervisor. Going around or above your boss’s head is
seen as a power play (and in truth, it almost always is a power play) and it almost
always results in negative consequences.There may be times when it’s appropriate to
go directly to senior management. For example, your boss might tell you that it
www.syngress.com
Navigating Corporate Politics • Chapter 3
93

would be a good idea for you to pitch the project to his or her boss directly since
you understand the details of the project.These types of situations depend a lot on
how your company is run and what the political climate is. If there is a lot of trust
and cooperation, it’s possible you can go directly to a senior executive without your
boss’s explicit permission. In other organizations, that’s what’s termed a CLM—a
career-limiting move.You’ll need to ﬁgure out how to get high-level support for your
project one way or another. Using the information you gleaned from Chapter 2, you
should have a more versatile set of tools to use now.
Making The Business Case
Another very practical and effective method of blowing through political logjams
that are impacting your IT projects is to do an excellent job making the business
case for your project. While politics may still impact your project, it’s much more
difﬁcult to argue when the facts and ﬁgures are clearly laid out. Going back to
Chapter 2 material, you learned that one effective way to inﬂuence people is with
reason. In this case, the business case you make for your IT project will appeal to
reason. If you can also ﬁnd a way to appeal to values and emotion, you’ll make a
stronger case. Create a strong business case, be prepared to present it in a way that
generates interest and maybe even excitement.
The IT Factor…
Generating Support for IT Projects
Making the business case is a good way to generate support for an IT project, but
often the presentation of the material falls ﬂat. You don’t need to go out and hire
someone to create a dazzling Flash-based presentation to make the material
interesting. Spend time thinking about the IT project and what you hope to
accomplish. Think about its impact on the company, the internal users, the cus-
tomers—whoever the project will impact most. Think about the positive poten-
tial for this project. Now you’re ready to present your case. Don’t bore people
with inﬁnite details about the project. Be prepared with details in case someone
asks, but like a good ﬁrst date, keep it short and sweet. Be honest and forth-
coming, but present information in a positive, energetic manner. How you per-
ceive the project and how you present the information has a lot to do with how
others receive the proposal. Earlier, you read CIO Trude Van Horn’s comments
that in some organizations, those who were the best presenters often got their
www.syngress.com
94
Chapter 3 • Navigating Corporate Politics
Continued

projects funded. Presentation has a lot to do with perception, so learn to state
your case in a manner that is both compelling and convincing (if you can’t do it,
ﬁnd someone on your team who can).
Avoid presentations that are either all ﬂash and no substance or so boring
even you want to fall asleep. Beware of Microsoft PowerPoint presentations
(which often fall to either extreme). PowerPoint is ﬁne as a tool, but don’t jam
your slides full of detailed data and then read every slide to your audience. Use
bullet points to remind yourself of your key points and then speak to the audi-
ence. That’s the short course on presentations, you know the rest. Generate
interest and excitement. If you can’t, you might want to have someone else do
the presentation or go get some coaching to learn how to give better presenta-
tions. Many innovative projects have failed to get off the ground because the pre-
sentation failed to make the case in a way that got anyone interested.
Calculated and 
Demonstrated ROI (Reduced TCO)
Calculating and demonstrating a return on investment (ROI) or a reduced total cost of
ownership (TCO) can also help a project move through political waters.This is closely
related to making the business case, but this focuses speciﬁcally on the ﬁnancial
aspect. If ﬁnances are not your strong suit, try to get one of your company’s Finance
people to assist you in these calculations.This will be critical for several reasons.
First, if you can show that your IT project not only has a strong business case (makes
sense, supports or extends the company’s strategies, etcetera), but also has good ﬁnan-
cials (ROI,TCO), you’re much more likely to reduce political opposition. If the IT
project has a weak ROI (or no ROI), you might need to re-evaluate it. If it supports
or extends the company’s mission, it might have a different type of ROI. For
instance, it might not save the company money or pay for itself in x number of years
unless you look at it from a more corporate perspective. Does this project improve
efﬁciency that could save the company money over time? Does this project help
generate additional revenue? Does this project help keep your company at the fore-
front of the market? Even if these beneﬁts are difﬁcult to calculate or are intangible,
you can still delineate them. Helping executives understand the business case and the
ﬁnancial elements is one of the best ways to prevent negative political activity. It’s
not a cure-all—certainly there are some companies that don’t let facts get in the way
of decision-making, but most companies are fairly rational when it comes to
spending money. Use that to your beneﬁt. Of course, you’ll still need to use all your
political savvy (developed, of course, from reading this chapter) to make sure your
projects stay on the fast track to success.

Effective Countermeasures
The methods discussed in the previous section are good at breaking up a political
logjam once it has occurred. However, there are numerous countermeasures you can
take that help reduce the political charge of an environment. More accurately, they
turn the political activity from negative, self-serving power grabbing to positive,
group-serving, power sharing.These suggestions don’t work in all companies all the
time and these are not the only techniques you can use. Most of these will work
when applied in the right situation and as you read, you’ll certainly be able to think
of situations now or in the past that could have used a dose of one or more of these
countermeasures.
The Politics of Service
Providing excellent service is often a great way to overcome political standoffs or
political ﬁghts. While it’s not a cure-all, it can be very effective in many situations.
Many IT departments are good at keeping their company up-to-date with or even
ahead of the technology curve, but just as many IT departments are viewed as out-
of-touch with their customers.As any doctor knows, ﬁxing the physical problem is
only part of the cure—dealing with the non-physical factors can often effect a more
powerful and lasting cure.Taking medication for high blood pressure without modi-
fying your diet or exercise will result in mediocre results.The same holds true in IT.
Fixing the physical problem is often only half the cure. Dealing with the customers,
whether internal or external, is what results in both the reality and the perception of
excellent service. We’ve all dealt with a variety of service people in our lives that
were probably competent, but didn’t say more than two words to us. Lack of infor-
mation leads to concern, distrust, and even suspicion.This can lead to a situation
where the problem was resolved, but the customer’s perception of the situation is still
negative. Improving service (assuming your IT department provides some sort of ser-
vice to the organization) can help calm turbulent political waters.
Partnering with Business Unit Counterparts
This is one of the most powerful countermeasures to interdepartmental politics.
When you actively seek out and partner with business unit counterparts, you are
sharing organizational, information, and resource power with them.As you learned
earlier in this chapter, when you share power, you tend to get more of it (power
shared is power gained), but that’s not the reason you’d use this method. Partnering
with business unit counterparts (those in other departments at roughly the same
organizational level you are) yields the opportunity for you to gain knowledge about
www.syngress.com
96
Chapter 3 • Navigating Corporate Politics

what the company and other departments are up to, which helps you do a better job
aligning your activities with the direction the company is headed. When you do this,
you make your department, your staff and your IT projects more relevant to the
company and this increases your power.As they say, the best defense is a good
offense, and when you genuinely forge relationships with others in the company, you
create a positive political environment.
Nowhere in our discussions do we imply, suggest, or outright state that these
activities should be undertaken for purely political purposes—just the opposite.The
goal is to reduce the negative political implications and the only way that can be
done is by undertaking these activities in a positive, genuine manner.To partner with
business unit counterparts for the sole purpose of gaining information to make
yourself or your department more powerful would be to further the negative polit-
ical environment and those types of maneuvers typically backﬁre anyway.These
countermeasures are intended to help reduce political maneuvering through activi-
ties and behaviors that create win-win situations.
Partnering with your counterparts also creates another interesting dynamic.
Once you actually know one another, you can ﬁnd and forge alliances outside your
normal sphere of inﬂuence. If you need a favor or support for a key project, you may
ﬁnd allies in these counterparts who can use their power and inﬂuence to help get
things done.And, when push comes to shove, you may ﬁnd support where you least
expected to ﬁnd it.
The Project Team
Selecting your project team can also help counter negative political activity in a
company. However, in some companies, this can be tricky, since adding the wrong
members to your team could cause even bigger problems. Certainly, you’ll need to
weigh the pros and cons of adding outside members to your project team, but often,
adding key stakeholders and business unit counterparts to the team helps tremen-
dously. For example, adding a person from another business unit that has often
opposed your project could help or hurt. If the person is genuinely interested in
ﬁnding an optimal solution, it could be a real bonus for your team to have that
person’s involvement. On the other hand, that person could simply undermine
everything you do. Keeping an eye toward building relationships and adding key
people to your project team might be a good move. It’s especially wise if you, your
department, or team is frequently criticized for not including the right people or
getting enough input prior to implementing a project. In this case, adding the right
people to the team can reduce that tension and provide a venue for meaningful and
timely input and advice. Later in this book, we’ll discuss how to determine the best
www.syngress.com
Navigating Corporate Politics • Chapter 3
97

outside people to add and why, and we’ll discuss subject matter experts and how
their input and support can catapult a project toward success.
Customer/User Involvement
Another related method for creating a more positive political environment is to
involve key users or customers in the projects that will impact them. In this case, the
word customers refers primarily to internal customers, though there may be instances
when involving external paying customers makes sense. Internal customers and users
can be the source of political unrest if their needs are not being met. Information is
power and if users (we’ll refer to internal customers as users here) feel they do not
have access to needed information, they can often become political liabilities. By
involving users in a meaningful way, you accomplish two key objectives. First, you
share information, which in itself might resolve or reverse negative political trends.
Second, you gain valuable information about your users that you can use to address
concerns, build trust, and over time build stronger alliances.Again, because these
methods can be used in negative, manipulative, power-grabbing ways, you might ﬁnd
resistance at ﬁrst, even if your intentions are good. When you involve users and you
have a genuine desire to improve business relationships, your department and pro-
jects will beneﬁt. We’ll speciﬁcally discuss when and how to involve users in the
project planning, testing and implementation phases of the project.
Communications Plan
Another potentially useful tool for skirting the usual political skirmishes is to create
a communications plan that addresses issues that are likely to arise. Many negative
political maneuvers become less effective when information is shared openly because
power plays often rely upon limited information. If you determine who might be
impacted by the project and in what manner, you can begin to plan your communi-
cation strategy. We’ll discuss this in more detail later in the book when we look at
planning your IT project. For now, however, keep in mind that the more informa-
tion you can share, the better off you’re likely to be. Remember that information is
power and that when you share power, you increase you own power. Clearly, there
are times when you want to limit which information you share, such as when a pro-
ject is conﬁdential or when you’re trying to ﬂy “under the radar.”There are also
times when you want to limit the scope of the information you share so you don’t
give political players additional fuel. However, if you can communicate proactively
and as openly as possible, you’ll thwart many political maneuvers.And let’s face it,
unfortunately, not all IT departments are known for their outstanding communica-
tion skills, so this is one are where there’s usually room for improvement.

Cheat Sheet…
Half Full, Half Empty
Some people naturally look at things with a positive attitude, while others seem
to always see the downside. Often, there is no absolute truth, simply a matter of
perspective. The same holds true of our behaviors at work (and elsewhere). While
there certainly are some absolutes we can point to, much of what we do is open
to interpretation based on one’s perspective. A CEO who cuts jobs is seen as the
bad guy to those who are losing their jobs, but the good guy to those who are
keeping their jobs because the company isn’t simply closing its doors. This
problem with perspective can impact you as you try to navigate the political
waters of your company. Each of the methods discussed in this chapter can be
used in negative, political, power-grabbing ways. Each of them can also be used
to build alliances, reduce political friction, and accomplish mutually acceptable
goals. That’s the ideal situation, but if your organization is already highly polit-
ical (we use that phrase with negative connotations throughout the chapter),
your actions may be seen as suspect or as self-serving. Sometimes it seems you
can’t win for losing, but if you work to build alliances and your outcomes con-
sistently generate positive results for you, your team, your department, and the
company, your actions will gradually be seen as genuine and positive. Who
knows, you might single-handedly change your organization from one that uses
negative political maneuvers to one that uses power and inﬂuence to everyone’s
beneﬁt. Don’t laugh. It could happen.

Summary
Power, inﬂuence and politics are incredibly useful tools in every organization, espe-
cially when used to generate positive results for yourself, your team, and your com-
pany. When used in an open, genuine manner, these methods can help you utilize
the various sources of power and the various methods of inﬂuence to generate
exceptional results. Don’t let the stigma of the words power, inﬂuence, and politics rub
off. Use the information in this chapter to become more effective in your organiza-
tion and generate results that beneﬁt everyone.

Corporate Politics:A Primer
 Politics are a fact of life and are present in all companies.
 Power is the ability to create change or to get things done.
 Inﬂuence is the exercise of that ability to produce change.
 Politics has been deﬁned as, ”the study of who gets what, when and how.”
Politics is power and inﬂuence in action.
 Politics is viewed negatively when it is self-serving and does nothing more
than provide opportunities for increasing one’s own power. Power,
inﬂuence, and politics, when positively applied, provide the ability to get
things done that beneﬁt all involved.
Understanding Sources of Power
 Power can be derived from numerous sources.The primary sources are:
organizational, information, resources, performance, expertise, and personal
traits.
 Each source of power can be used in positive or negative ways.
 Organizational power often includes information and resource power.
 Performance and expertise are often power sources over which you have
some control. In other words, you can improve performance and expertise
through effort. Both are sources of power that can be useful in gaining
access to other sources of power.

Chapter 3 • Navigating Corporate Politics

 Personal traits are often things over which we have some control such as
how we dress, how we speak, or how genuine we are (or are perceived 
to be).
Understanding Methods of Inﬂuence
 Inﬂuence is the use of various forms of power to achieve goals or
objectives.
 Threats, exchange/barter, and appeals to values, emotions, and reason are
the three primary methods of inﬂuence.
 Threats work for short-term,“emergency” situations.They generate
compliance, but not commitment.
 Exchange and barter are effective methods because they cut across the
entire organization.There need not be a one-for-one exchange or an in-
kind exchange for this method to work.
 Appeals to values, emotions, and reason can be used in a variety of settings.
These can generate the type of commitment that threats cannot.
 Appeals to values and emotions, when misused, are seen as manipulative or
underhanded in most situations.
 Appeals to reason work well, but may not generate the level of
commitment needed for certain undertakings.
The Power Paradox
 Power has some very interesting contradictions that are important to
understand.
 Organizations work more effectively when more people have more power.
When power is limited or restricted, the environment can become negative,
self-serving, and limiting.
 Overuse of organizational power diminishes that power. If you constantly
use “because I’m the boss” as the method of getting results, you’ll erode
your power and authority.
 Overuse of power leads to a distorted sense of power.These people tend to
overestimate their importance of in the organization.

 Sharing power increases your power. Managers who share power with
subordinates generate increased commitment and improved group
performance. It helps people learn to make better decisions and helps the
group perform at a higher level.
Working Effectively in a Political Environment
 Accept that politics exist. Ignoring it will not make it go away.
 Plan on politics being a part of your job. Just about everything you do will
be judged based on both quality and politics.
 Develop positive, genuine relationships. Getting to know your counterparts
in the business, your customers, your users, and your co-workers creates a
positive environment and can counteract a lot of political maneuvers.
 Learn to listen.This prevents you from talking too much and provides you
valuable opportunities to gain insights and information. It’s also important
to communicate effectively and let people know what’s going on.This also
circumvents political maneuvers that rely in misinformation.
 Know your own values.You’ll need to know what you think and believe so
you can follow your own internal values when it comes to working in a
political environment. When you encounter negative political behaviors, it’s
important to know in advance what you will and won’t put up with.
 Be aware of the changing political landscape. Not only will you fare better
if you keep an eye on what’s happening, you may also ﬁnd unexpected
opportunities. Be aware and be prepared to leverage those opportunities.
Breaking Up Political Logjams
 Within the business environment, there are speciﬁc things you can do to
break up a political logjam.
 Executive support is important to project success and it can be particularly
helpful if the project is being held up by political maneuvering.
 Making the business case for a project is another useful tool for getting an
important project underway. If it’s been bogged down in the organization’s
politics, developing a clear and concise business case document may just get
things moving again.

Chapter 3 • Navigating Corporate Politics

 Calculate the return on investment. If a project gets logjammed in the
decision-making process, showing the ROI (or in some cases, the reduced
total cost of ownership) can jump-start a stalled project.
Effective Countermeasures
 In a political environment, ﬁnding ways to create win-win situations often
is your best countermeasure.
 Delivering excellent service can be an effective countermeasure to a
political situation. It addresses a number of organizational power bases
including organizational, information, and resource.
 Developing strong relationships with business unit counterparts will help
on a number of levels. Sharing information helps increase your power and
reduce the political maneuvers that rely on lack of information. It also can
give you genuine allies that can support your IT projects or lend their
inﬂuence to your projects. It can also just make work more interesting and
enjoyable.
 Involving the right people in IT projects—whether it’s subject matter
experts from within the company or internal users/customers—you can
increase your ability to get the job done by forging these kinds of alliances
as well.
 Information is power and sharing power increases your power.Therefore,
sharing information will increase your power and reduce political activities
that rely on misinformation or information hording.

Q: I often ﬁnd out important data after the fact.Any suggestions for getting
more information sooner?
A: Withholding information can stem from one of two basic causes: someone
forgot or someone purposely didn’t tell you. We all can forget to share crit-
ical information from time to time, but most of us know when we see a pat-
tern or when it seems intentional. In these cases, you might choose to talk to
the person directly to let them know you’re aware of the problem. We’re
assuming, for this problem, you do not have organizational power over the
person (that is, you are not his or her boss or in their chain of command). By
letting the person know you’re aware of the withholding of information and
politely confronting him or her, you provide the opportunity for him to
explain, but you’ve also put him on notice. If the person continues this
behavior, you may need to have the conversation in a more public setting,
such as in a meeting with other key people present. Often people trying to
gain power through withholding information will do so on the sly. If you call
them on it in a meeting, especially if you’ve gotten hammered for not having
the information, you can sometimes resolve these issues.The best approach is
to be polite and direct, stick to the facts as you know them and be careful
how you word things. Leaving the other person with some dignity is always
your best bet and sometimes phrasing these inquiries as polite questions
rather than accusations can yield better results.
Q: My manager is an executive with the company. She frequently has us pitch
project ideas directly to her boss, the CEO. I always feel like I’m “talking out
of school” when this happens.Any comment?
A: It seems your boss is comfortable with sharing power and is happy to let you
loose with her boss—that’s a real vote of conﬁdence. Of course, because you
do have the ear of her boss, you need to be cognizant of the political impli-

cations here. If her boss, the CEO, says to you after a presentation,“So, tell
me, how do you like working for Lisa? Any problems?” you need to think
before you speak. If there are problems, this is probably not the right time or
place to air them. For instance, have you talked with your boss to try to
resolve the problems? If not, mentioning them to her boss ﬁrst will under-
mine her and will cause a serious trust problem between you two. If there are
problems and you have talked with your boss about them, this is still probably
not the best time or place to address these issues.Again, while the CEO may
genuinely want information, he or she should understand that the question
puts you in an untenable position. In this case, your best bet is to say as little
as possible. If you are facing a serious, difﬁcult problem with your boss and
this is your one shot at taking it up with the CEO, you may choose to do so,
but be aware that this path is fraught with peril.
Q: All this talk of politics makes me want to hide in the computer lab some-
place. Can’t we ever work in a non-political environment?
A: Yes and no. First, it’s interesting to note that when a company’s political envi-
ronment is negative, it is considered political. When a company’s political
environment contributes to the greater good of the company, the employees,
shareholders, and customers, it’s not seen as political at all.Thus, when we say
a company is highly political, we often mean that the more negative aspects
are at the forefront. Companies vary widely in how political they are. Some
companies frown upon the negative aspects of politics while others seem to
thrive on power plays and intrigue. Often this behavior is encouraged, mod-
eled, or at least blindly accepted at the top of the organization. If your orga-
nization is highly political, you really only have three choices: play along;
ignore politics and just try to get your job done; or leave the company. Many
people ﬁnd the ﬁrst choice unacceptable. However, ignoring the political
environment puts you at a disadvantage.Your work will rarely, if ever, be
judged solely upon its quality and content.The perception of the quality of
your work will always be inﬂuenced by the political environment.You might
get lucky, but if not, your overall work performance will likely be judged as
adequate or mediocre if you’re not participating in managing the political
aspects of your job.You can always quit and look for a company that is not as
political, but you’re likely to ﬁnd that every company has its own unique
blend of politics and problems and you have to take the good with the bad.
The good news is that you now know how to counter and defuse political
moves to make them less effective in your world.

Q: I’m currently interviewing with several different companies for a new job.
How can I tell if the organization is highly political or not?
A: When interviewing, you have the responsibility to do your own due dili-
gence to make sure the job and the company are right for you. One way to
view the political environment of the organization is to talk with people.Talk
with the receptionist, talk with the person that interviews you, talk with
people in the parking lot.Asking them if the organization is political is prob-
ably not going to yield meaningful information. Instead, using the knowledge
you gained in this chapter, ask questions related to how people get things
done in the company.Ask questions that will help you determine if people
share or hoard information or resources.Ask questions that help you deter-
mine if organizational power is the primary method of getting things done.
While you may not know for sure until you’re well into your 90-day proba-
tionary period, you can often get a feel for things by seeing how open,
honest, and forthcoming people appear to be, how negative or biting they
might be about their peers or the company in general, and by how often
they use words like team, we, share, ﬂexible, cooperate, etc. and actually mean
it. Every company has a unique personality and politics is part of the mix.
Finding one that seems to suit your approach to work and life is your best
bet.And remember, they’re taking a risk on you as well—it’s in everyone’s
best interest to make sure it’s a good ﬁt.

Introduction
Projects don’t fail, people do.That basic statement sums up the challenge every pro-
ject manager faces.Any research done in this area returns time and again to the
underlying cause of project failure: people. Most technology projects are complex
and lack of funding, lack of staff, and lack of time or focus are all blamed in equal
measure for project failure. Projects don’t arise from the dust and run themselves—
someone has to deﬁne them, fund them, staff them, and run them.The people
involved are responsible for the success (or failure) of the project.As the project
manager, you’re ultimately responsible for the success of the project. For that reason,
we’re devoting a chapter to managing the project team. We’re taking a slightly dif-
ferent approach than you may have seen in the past. We’re going to explore not only
how people tend to work (work styles) but also how you, as the project manager,
can be more effective in managing teams that may be geographically, culturally, or
technically diverse. In today’s wired world (and increasingly, wireless world), we work
with people around the globe in different time zones, different countries, and dif-
ferent cultures. While one chapter won’t give you all the tools you need to perfect
your multicultural management skills, it will help you better understand some of the
challenges and give you some tools you can use immediately to improve your team
management skills.
Project management, by deﬁnition, is the process of working with a team of people
to solve a problem. In a vast majority of projects, the project manager (PM) must
manage people over whom he or she has no direct (organizational) authority. Much of
the PM’s job, then, is using inﬂuence to generate the desired results.As you learned in
Chapter 3, there are many sources of power and many methods of inﬂuencing people.
Understanding these basics will help you as you manage your project team.
If you’ve ever wondered what makes people tick or what makes some managers
so good at getting people on board with their projects, this chapter will give you
some insight into those skills. If you manage a team that is across the continent or
across the world, you’ll learn highly useful information that will make your job a bit
easier.And, if you’ve ever felt like your team was simply running you ragged, this
chapter is a must-read for you.
Today’s Management Environment
It has been estimated that the amount of information contained in one issue of the
Wall Street Journal or the New York Times is more information than people processed
in a year a century ago.We’re all hit with the onslaught of information—from televi-
sion, radio, newspapers, magazines, books, e-mail, to the Internet news and blogs.We
www.syngress.com

Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

get information instantly and we scan, absorb, reject, and move on.A century ago, a
manager was in the position to have all the needed information and could make
informed decisions for the people who worked for that manager.Today, managers are
more like trafﬁc cops, trying to direct the efforts of those in the organization toward a
common goal while avoiding head-on collisions.The manager is no longer in the best
position to know everything and make all the decisions. Instead, a manager must rely
upon the people on his or her team to have expertise and to take initiative. However,
at the same time this is needed, people are more mobile and less committed to
employers than they were one hundred years ago.Today’s manager needs to ﬁnd a way
to foster commitment and initiative with employees who are likely to change careers
ﬁve times and hold ten or more jobs over their lifetimes. In order to manage this
workforce, an effective manager must use new tools to achieve desired results.
Commitment and initiative are more important when managers have to process
so much information that they are no longer the “experts” but the “generalists.”
Increasingly, companies must depend on highly skilled employees to think and act
intelligently on behalf of the company since they have the technical knowledge, the
imagination, and the connection with customers, vendors, and the marketplace.
Technology has had a signiﬁcant impact on the way we work and process informa-
tion.A successful manager today must be able to mobilize employees to ﬁgure out
how to get more done with less; a successful manager must ﬁnd ways to inspire
commitment and initiative to get the best possible results; and a successful manager
must understand what challenges employees face to clear roadblocks and provide the
best possible environment for success.That’s a tall order, but in this chapter, we’re
going to look at some of the ways you can do just that.
What People Really Want
Let’s start with the basics. Most people work because they have to earn a living.
Hopefully, they also enjoy what they’re doing and their job or career brings them a
sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Some people like the power or importance
they derive from their jobs and others enjoy the daily interaction with co-workers,
vendors, and clients. Some people like the problem solving and the challenges they
get at work and others work for a personal sense of fulﬁllment or personal mission.
Regardless of the reason people work, there are common elements about what
people want when they’re at work. Naturally, people want to be well compensated
for the work they do, but every Management 101 class will tell you that money is
not a motivator, but a demotivator. What does that mean? It means that you can’t
pay someone enough to like their job, but you can pay them too little to enjoy their
job.Think about the last time you got a big raise or promotion.You were probably
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
109

thrilled with the increase in pay—for a while.After a time, you adjusted to your new
income and that raise lost its luster. On the contrary, think about a job you may have
had where you were asked to assume a larger role or greater responsibility and were
not given additional compensation.At some point, you were probably a bit irritated
(or downright dissatisﬁed) that you were not being paid more money. So, let’s cross
money off the list of what people want. Everyone wants more money, but if one is
adequately compensated, money rarely solves the underlying problems. We’ll assume
that the folks that work with and for you are adequately compensated and that, like
everyone else, they’d love a hefty raise or bonus this year.
Causes of Job Dissatisfaction
There are issues that can cause dissatisfaction, but once they’re taken care of they
don’t buy you much satisfaction.These are often termed hygiene issues or housekeeping
issues. Like housekeeping, if the room is a mess you might be dissatisﬁed, but once
it’s cleaned up, it begins to blend into the background and is viewed in a relatively
neutral manner.You rarely come into your ofﬁce and think,“Wow, this ofﬁce is so
clean, I am so productive!” though you may occasionally think to yourself,“If I don’t
clean off the top of my desk soon, I won’t get anything done, I’ll spend all day
looking for paper!” So, let’s run through some of these housekeeping issues.As an IT
department manager, you may have control over some or all of these. If you’re an IT
project manager without direct control or authority over any of these things, it is still
good to be aware of these issues. When these things are lacking, people become dis-
organized and frustrated.Anything you can do to reduce disorganization and frustra-
tion is a good thing. Let’s take a look:

Company and Administrative Policies
Policies and procedures that don’t make sense drive everyone nuts. Some companies
have lots of crazy policies that seem to have been written back in 1965 and haven’t
changed for forty years. Other companies are ﬂying by the seats of their pants and
have few, if any, written policies and procedures. Neither extreme is good or desirable.
www.syngress.com
110
Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

Policies and procedures can be an excellent part of making your company (or in your
case, IT department or IT project) run smoothly and efﬁciently. Policies and proce-
dures can clearly delineate common areas of confusion, responsibility, or legal require-
ments and help everyone stay on the same page.The ﬂip side is you can create so
many policies and procedures that it takes a Ph.D. to understand and apply them.
We’ll discuss setting up policies and procedures for your IT project later in the
book.Again, it’s not so that we can create a tangle of red tape, but to provide a
framework in which team members can work more efﬁciently. If a policy or proce-
dure doesn’t drive efﬁciency, it should be re-evaluated.There are policies and proce-
dures that are required by law, but one could argue that they drive efﬁciency by
keeping the company out of court. If you’re an IT manager, you certainly have to
abide by and enforce company policies and procedures. However, you also have to
create and enforce policies related to IT—both internal and external to your depart-
ment. Creating policies and procedures that help your staff get their jobs done more
efﬁciently should be your goal. Gather input from your staff and get rid of any that
just don’t make sense or that make things unnecessarily more difﬁcult. If you start
bumping up against company policies or procedures that don’t make sense, take
them up with your boss or the appropriate person in the company and try to get
them changed. In order to be competitive in today’s fast-paced environment,
working through useless or nonsensical policies and procedures slows things down
and causes unnecessary confusion, frustration, and often, expense. Lack of coherent
policies also creates confusion and slows things down as well.
Salary
We’ve already brieﬂy touched on the salary issue.As a project manager, this is out of
your hands, but if you’re also the head of your IT department, you may have some
control over this. Of course, we’d all love to make huge salaries, but that’s just not
going to happen in IT anytime soon.That said, if your company pays below market
salaries, you’d better have some pretty cool perks to add on to the salary if you hope
to attract and retain top-level talent. If you pay B or C-level rates, you’re going to
retain C or D-level staff. While you may not have much control over salary ranges in
your company, you can make a business case for paying market (or better) rates.
Someone with more skills and experience will ultimately cost your company less
than someone with fewer skills and experience (assuming those skills and experience
are relevant and necessary).
Another related issue is one that’s been facing IT departments in the past four or
ﬁve years and that is one of shrinking staff and expanding responsibilities.You and
your staff may be tasked with more work and with higher levels of responsibility
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
111

than ever before, but salaries don’t necessarily get boosted to accommodate that. In
some companies, the unfortunate attitude is akin to “You’re lucky to have a job.” In
other companies, it’s a bit more benign—closer to “We’d love to pay you more if we
could afford it, but things are tight right now.” Just take one look at what the stock
market has done in the past few years and you can see that many businesses are
simply going sideways—earnings were ﬂat, revenues were ﬂat (or down) and were in
no position to grant large increases. Still, you may be able to make a business case for
increasing salaries for key members of your staff to retain that talent.The mantra is
retain or re-train, and training new hires (even those with equivalent skills, experience,
or talents) generally costs far more than a raise for key employees.
Finally, another trap companies get locked into—and this is more common for
smaller companies—raises don’t keep pace with the market.You end up with these
incredibly talented company veterans with 5 or 10 years’ of excellent experience and
they’re making less than if they quit and got hired elsewhere (or re-hired at the same
company).This is one way that companies lose talented employees, and it goes back
to the policies and procedures issue we discussed earlier. If your policies prevent you
from keeping key employees’ salaries at (or above) market, you’ll lose them to your
competitor.
As IT manager, you should lobby hard to ensure your team’s wages are up to par.
If you’re an IT project manager, this may impact you because you may have staff being
asked to take on more and more “special projects” and they may feel tapped out, over-
loaded, or just resentful at having to take on one more project for no additional pay.As
companies continue to try to get as much productivity as possible out of each indi-
vidual contributor (and that’s a good thing, to a point), it’s important that you also
lobby to hire additional positions as the work expands. CEOs,VPs, and other senior
managers often have the mistaken impression that as technology marches forward, the
costs should go down (as efﬁciency goes up). Not so. For the most part, costs shift
from one place to another and sometimes costs increase. It’s important that you help
your senior management understand this by preparing and presenting an effective busi-
ness case. In this case, delineating the cost of errors, omissions, and rework due to short
stafﬁng might justify hiring (temporary or permanent) additional help.
Supervision
Supervision is another housekeeping issue that can be the source of dissatisfaction.
Often people selected to move into supervisory roles are those deemed “good
workers.”The problem is that a good worker is not always a good supervisor.A good
supervisor is one that interacts well with others and is able to be fair, impartial, and rel-
atively unemotional about employee behavior.A good supervisor also needs leadership
www.syngress.com
112
Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

skills, especially the ability to get commitment (and compliance) from employees being
supervised. If you’re an IT project manager, you are essentially supervising project team
members during the project, so this applies to you as well. If you don’t have supervi-
sory experience, you should consider taking a supervisor’s course or reading up on
what constitutes good supervision. Since this is a primary work relationship, your
supervisory skills will have a signiﬁcant impact on the people you work with. If you’re
an IT department manager, you should carefully evaluate who you make a supervisor
and be clear about the skills you’re looking for. Poor supervision is often a source of
employee dissatisfaction. Inexperienced supervisors tend to be micro-managing control
freaks or hands-off no-boundaries types that let staff walk all over them. Neither is
helpful or desirable, and good, consistent, fair supervision is key to job satisfaction.
Working Conditions
Working conditions are another area that you may or may not have much control
over, but that have an impact on employee productivity and satisfaction. If every
time someone goes to make a copy, the copier breaks, jams, or catches on ﬁre, you’re
losing valuable time and money. Not every company can afford ﬁrst-class accommo-
dations, but that doesn’t mean it should skimp on important parts of the work envi-
ronment.Adequate heating and cooling (you’d be surprised…), comfortable chairs
(especially for programmers and folks that spend their 10-12 hours a day sitting), and
reasonable personal space are all key elements.As an IT department manager, you
can do your best to create a comfortable work environment within your sphere of
inﬂuence. If necessary, lobby to get some of the corporate budget allocated for these
things applied to your department. Even if you’re such a geek (and that term is used
with the highest respect) you only notice whether or not the network is up, decent
working conditions are important to the vast majority of people.
Let’s add another dimension to working conditions—information overload. In
today’s world, the amount of new information we need to process is accelerating and
we have to deal with more data than ever before. It’s not your imagination—the tech-
nological revolution over the past ﬁfty years has caused more information to be gener-
ated than ever before in human history. Sorting the “need to know” from the “nice to
know” from the “don’t need to know” can itself be time consuming.There may be
very little you can do to reduce information overload (some call it “data smog”) but
you can try to help your department staff or project team by not contributing unnec-
essarily to the overload. Be aware of the information demands and work to reduce
non-critical information for your team. If you’re interested in reading up on this, a
thorough academic discussion of this problem can be found online at http://icl-
server.ucsd.edu/~kirsh/Articles/Overload/published.html, but don’t feel compelled to
read it—it may only contribute to your information overload.

Interpersonal Relationships
Just the words “interpersonal relationships” brings fear to many IT types—after all,
it’s about the technology isn’t it? Sure it is, but in this context, we’re talking about
the importance of people being able to interact with one another. Ensuring that the
work environment affords adequate time for social contact is an important aspect of
work for almost everyone. Socializing during a break, at lunch, or between meetings
should be allowed and encouraged—to a point. Clearly, work has to get done, but
there are some managers (though it’s more often inexperienced supervisors) that
expect people to work with their nose to the grindstone for 10 continuous hours a
day. Breaks for socializing recharge people’s batteries and bring enjoyment to the job.
The ﬂip side of this is also important to note.You should not allow rude or
offensive comments, inappropriate behavior, or threats of any kind.You should take
immediate and appropriate action to curtail this type of activity. Some of this
behavior crosses the line from simply rude to illegal when it creates a hostile envi-
ronment, so making it clear that this type of behavior will not be tolerated is very
important.As an IT department manager, you’ll be bound to the company’s policies
and procedures regarding this type of behavior, but you can also model and foster a
positive environment that encourages positive interactions and provides a framework
for dealing with problems in an acceptable manner.As an IT project manager, you’ll
also encounter situations where people may behave in inappropriate (or illegal) ways
within the project environment and you’ll need to take appropriate action as well.
When this negative type of behavior is not challenged and stopped, it becomes a
major source of job dissatisfaction for those who are the frequent targets of this bad
behavior.Again, these activities, if unchecked, could constitute harassment or worse
and could land you and your company in legal trouble if you’re aware of it and do
nothing to stop it. If you’re an IT project manager without direct authority to take
action, notify your supervisor or manager or notify your Human Resources manager
for assistance.
When these “housekeeping” items are in order, employees won’t be distracted by
basic elements of the job. If you don’t deal with these issues effectively, the most
likely result is that excellent employees will leave and you’ll end up with mediocre
employees (all the B and C-level folks, none of the A-level folks). Now, let’s turn our
attention to what helps people feel satisﬁed with their jobs.

Cheat Sheet…
Keep Your Eyes and Ears Open
As an IT project manager, the things that cause job or work dissatisfaction are
often outside your direct control. While you can’t control them, you can be aware
of them and understand how they impact your team. If any of the items listed in
the previous section are causing your team to be less productive or effective, you
can and should try to take steps to work with someone in the organization that
does have direct control over these elements. Though you might not be able to
effect change in these areas every time, it’s important that you understand and
recognize these problems if they arise because they will likely impact your team’s
overall success. However, make sure you remember the lessons you learned in
Chapter 3 about managing in a political environment to make sure you approach
the problem in a positive and effective manner.
Foundations for Job Satisfaction
If money is not what people want, then what do they want? A motivation theorist
by the name of Frederick Herzberg proposed that people are motivated and their
needs are satisﬁed by just a handful of things:
■
The work itself
■
Achievement
■
Recognition
■
Responsibility
■
Advancement
Keep in mind that people will only be motivated or satisﬁed by these things if
the basic elements of a good work environment are present.As we discussed, those
include money (compensation and beneﬁts), working conditions (hours, physical sur-
roundings, workload), relationships with supervisor and peers, and company policies
and procedures.Any of these can create dissatisfaction when not present or when
not positive, but once these items are present and accounted for, they become part of
the background. Understanding the basics of why people work and what they want
is important because it will help you as a project manager learn to manage people
more effectively and will certainly help when you have to manage project team

members over whom you have no direct or organizational authority. It’s especially
important to understand it’s not really about the money because as a PM, you usu-
ally have no control over the project team’s paychecks. Now that you understand
you have several other highly effective tools at your disposal, let’s look at how these
various motivators come into play on an IT project team.
The Work Itself
Many people seek out jobs that utilize their natural skills and talents. Whether
they’re landscapers or psychologists, plumbers or dancers, everyone will make a best
effort to ﬁnd a job aligned with his or her skills and interests.That said, not everyone
has the opportunity to ﬁnd a job aligned with his or her skills and talents. Hopefully,
in your organization, people are in jobs at which they can perform at or above
expectations. Most people, then, ﬁnd satisfaction from the actual work they perform.
That doesn’t mean they enjoy all aspects of it.An IT manager may love designing
the network infrastructure and hate giving performance reviews to staff or dislike
having to develop a departmental budget every year. Every job has elements we
don’t enjoy, but the overall job responsibilities and tasks are a source of great satisfac-
tion for many people, especially those in professional vocations.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
As an IT manager or project manager, you should try to assign people to
projects or tasks that align with what they enjoy doing. Although it’s not
always possible, if you can ﬁnd someone who enjoys ﬁnance to be part of
developing the project budget, you’re going to get a much better result
than if you get someone who can do it, but hates that aspect of their job.
Aligning skills, interests, and talents with project needs will yield better
results with less effort. A task that one person dislikes might be a task that
someone else really enjoys, so make sure you understand your team and
which tasks are likely to appeal to each team member. While you can’t
always make a good match, you can achieve higher quality at a lower cost
just by consciously aligning people and project tasks.
Achievement
Another area that brings job satisfaction is a sense of achievement.There are two key
aspects to a sense of achievement—the actual work (accomplishing a difﬁcult goal)
www.syngress.com
116
Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

and the recognition of that accomplishment. We’ll discuss recognition separately in a
moment, but remember that a sense of achievement contains those two elements.As
people become more self-conﬁdent and mature, they often derive enough satisfac-
tion from the achievement itself, but having someone be aware of or witness your
achievement is often important. Olympic athletes certainly revel in their achieve-
ments, but when they do something spectacular in front of a crowd or on television
rather than during their Tuesday morning workout, it becomes more meaningful.
Thus, providing opportunities for achievement and recognizing that achievement
often go hand-in-hand.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
As an IT manager or project manager, you should look for opportunities
for people to stretch, grow, and learn. These opportunities provide people
with a sense of achievement and can contribute to a strong sense of job
satisfaction. While you don’t want to put your project or department in
jeopardy, you can help people take measured, calculated risks that help
them learn new skills. This not only helps that person feel a sense of
achievement, but it also helps you learn what the members of your team
can or cannot do. If necessary, assign tasks to a junior person with a more
senior person overseeing the task. This allows the more junior person to
grow and provides the more senior person the opportunity to learn and
grow in supervision and management, so everyone wins.
Recognition
How is a “job well done” recognized in your organization? Every company has a
different culture and unfortunately, many are not good at giving recognition. Some
people seem to think that if you praise someone’s work, it will cause them to slack
off, but just the opposite is true. Recognition of good or excellent work can be a
real motivator. People want praise and recognition for work they do that meets or
exceeds expectations. Recognition is one of the easiest methods of keeping
employees motivated and the good news is that, unlike a bonus or raise, it doesn’t
cost a nickel.Think of the last time your manager praised you for work you did.You
felt good and that recognition probably made your day, week, or month.
Sadly, some managers are terrible at recognizing great work.As a result, staff feel
their efforts aren’t valued or noticed and they tend to perform at lower and lower
levels until their work simply meets standards (at best).To produce high-performance
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
117

teams, the manager must be able to give appropriate recognition to team members’
work. What’s appropriate recognition? That depends a lot upon your company’s
work environment, your team members, and the nature of the task receiving recog-
nition. However, some general ideas include verbal or written recognition, either
privately or in a more public setting (team or department meeting, for instance).You
can send an e-mail to the person or to the entire team touting someone’s accom-
plishments.You can also recognize outstanding accomplishments with small rewards
such as an afternoon off from work or tickets to the movies. If appropriate and you
have the authority to do so, you can also give someone a bonus or raise due to truly
outstanding effort. Remember, though, the rewards and bonuses are NOT a substi-
tute for verbal and/or written praise. Verbal or written recognition is less expensive
than rewards or bonuses and it’s also far more effective.
Enterprise 128…
Keepin’ It Real
A manager of an IT department had been promoted into the position during a
time when the company was having ﬁnancial problems. As a result, he wasn’t
really the best suited to the job, but was there because he’d been in the right
place at the right time. We’ll call him Hamilton. Hamilton was very personable
and many people who interacted with him found him to be funny, interesting,
and charming—except the people that worked for him. He was known to have
an explosive temper with his staff and they alternately feared and resented him.
Unfortunately, when they did a good job, Hamilton turned on the charm and was
effusive in his praise. It was rarely proportionate to the work done. Even more
unfortunate was that Hamilton, lacking even basic management skills, would
shower an underperforming employee with lavish praise to the same degree he
would for a super star. This got him into trouble with the HR department on more
than one occasion because he’d bestow high praise on someone and then turn
around and ﬁre them for poor performance a week or two later. This was con-
fusing to existing staff and lead to reduced productivity and increased tension.
Avoid bestowing praise on underperforming staff unless it’s really war-
ranted. Make sure the praise is commensurate with the task and effort. Make
sure the praise is real and meaningful. Don’t tell someone you’re thrilled they’re
part of the team when they are barely making the grade. When you give dispro-
portionate or over-the-top praise, especially when it’s not warranted, you’ll lose
credibility and the trust of your team.

Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Genuine, meaningful recognition makes people feel valued and enhances
their sense of accomplishment. Make sure you’re speciﬁc and honest
when recognizing accomplishments and make every effort to do so in a
timely manner. It’s far more effective to give public recognition at a
team meeting a week after the accomplishment than to add it as a note
in someone’s performance review 8 months later. Also, avoid giving
glowing recognition to underperformers—it creates a mixed message
and can cause legal problems if the employee is later let go (“My boss
told me I was a great asset to the team and a week later I was ﬁred!”).
If you’re the type that’s not comfortable giving recognition, focus on the
facts and practice saying it a few times before you have to deliver it. The
more you do it, the easier it gets, but keep it real.
Responsibility
Some people thrive on taking on additional responsibilities.This is another source of
job satisfaction for some. Remember that not everyone wants to move up in the
organization and not everyone will enjoy additional responsibility, so unlike recogni-
tion, this does not always have universal appeal. However, most people enjoy having
more power, authority, and responsibility, so ﬁnding ways to provide that for staff
who are performing above expectations is a real motivator. Keep in mind that you
should almost never give more responsibility to someone who is underperforming.
You might think the person is bored or underutilized (and he or she might tell you
that), but you shouldn’t reward bad behavior. So, additional responsibility should only
be given to those who have proved themselves. In the real world, that may not
always be possible, but it should be your goal.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Sometimes real “go-getters” are chomping at the bit for more responsi-
bility, but they ignore the responsibilities that they currently have. This is
often the case with younger, less experienced staff. While helping staff
to focus on current responsibilities, you can increase job satisfaction by
providing small opportunities for additional responsibilities and see how
things go. For instance, you might assign someone the task of gathering
and analyzing weekly call volumes or weekly satisfaction ratings for help
desk calls and see how they accomplish the task. If they start ignoring
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
119

other work, you can scale their responsibilities back without having a
huge, disruptive impact on the organization. Look for small additional
tasks to assign for those you’re not sure about. Look for permanent
transfer of large responsibilities for staff who’ve not only proven they’re
up to it but who deserve the opportunity. Giving huge opportunities to
unproven staff can backﬁre. Experienced staff will be resentful at missed
opportunities and inexperienced staff may falter in their new duties—
both scenarios cause disruption in the team or department.
Advancement
Advancement is another source of job satisfaction for many people.They want to
know that their efforts will be rewarded with additional responsibility, which often
comes with career advancement.A big thank you and an occasional raise work won-
ders in the near to mid-term, but over the long haul, many people want to see that
they have the opportunity to advance.
As a project manager, you may have limited control over this part of someone’s
job, but you may be able to provide staff with the opportunity to advance within the
framework of the IT team or project team.As people demonstrate their abilities to
deﬁne, organize, and manage tasks and projects, you can begin to reward them with
additional responsibilities or roles on the project team.You may deﬁne project team
leaders or project team supervisors and this may be an area that provides some sense
of advancement, even if it’s not a job promotion. Giving people the opportunity to
advance within the bounds of your authority (team, project, department, etc.) will
help motivate some people because they’ll see the possibility and path to advance-
ment.The opportunities you provide for your team to learn new skills and grow
professionally might also lead to career advancement for them due to their efforts on
your project team. Strong performance on a project team may lead to opportunities
for promotion outside the project team.

IT Projects and Job Satisfaction
We all know that some IT projects are highly coveted and others are run-of-the-
mill (or worse). As an IT department manager or IT project manager, keep in mind
that everyone should have a shot at the coveted projects, but everyone should
also have to participate equally in the dreaded projects (splicing 600 cables that
were cut when the landscaper accidentally dug up the buried cabling…).
Remember the sources of job satisfaction we just discussed and try to assign
people to projects in a manner that will drive job satisfaction. While it’s impor-
tant to assign the right resources to the right projects, when you have a bit of
leeway, look for opportunities to drive job satisfaction among your team mem-
bers. You’ll ﬁnd the work is done faster and with higher quality when you can do
so. It only takes an extra couple of minutes to consider these factors when
making project or job assignments and it can make a world of difference for you,
the team and the team member.
Work Styles and the Project Team
It’s clear that people have different work styles—from how they like to receive infor-
mation to how they like to manage their work; from how they interact with others
to how they like their manager to communicate with them. In this section, we’ll
look at four common work styles that you can use to begin to understand how each
of the members of your team approaches work.These four styles are used as you
might use the four primary colors. Each can be used alone, but is often mixed with
one or two others to create new, unique colors. Work styles are similar in that they
rarely show up purely as one of the four styles. More often, they are blends of two
or three styles.As with color, though, you can almost always discern the primary
work style preference.This is useful because when you understand how someone
(primarily) approaches work, you can work with him or her to leverage his or her
strengths and minimize weaknesses.
Some of you may be familiar with work styles assessments such as Myers-Briggs
or DiSC proﬁles. Myers-Briggs is a useful tool, but can be somewhat more complex
or comprehensive than needed in some instances. Myers-Briggs looks at four areas.
These are:
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
121

■
Where do you primarily direct your energy? The two polarities used to
describe these traits are extrovert and introvert.The extrovert is externally
focused and the introvert is internally focused.
■
How do you prefer to process information? The two polarities used here
are sensing and intuition.Those who prefer sensing prefer facts, ﬁgures, and
things that can be measured and known.Those that prefer intuition prefer
ideas, possibilities, and the unknown.
■
How do you prefer to make decisions? The two polarities in this case are
thinking and feeling.Typically a person is more comfortable thinking through
decisions or more comfortable following the “gut” response.
■
How do you prefer to organize your life (and work)? The two extremes
used in this instance are judgmental and perception.Those that are judgmental
(without the negative connotation) are those that prefer things to be
planned, stable, and organized.Those preferring to organize their lives based
on perception like to be ﬂexible, responsive, and to “go with the ﬂow.”
As with any assessment or system, it’s rare that someone is totally to one extreme
or the other in their behaviors and preferences. More often, people fall somewhere
along the continuum. We all know people who prefer rules and regulations and
order and stability. Some of them on the extreme may seem incredibly rigid or
uptight to us, but that’s where they’re most comfortable. We all also know people
who couldn’t seem to care less about the rules and would love nothing more than to
sit down and reveal their innermost thoughts to you.Almost everyone else falls
somewhere in between and you’d have to get to know them well or work closely
with them to come to any conclusions about their natural preferences.The key to
any of these systems that categorize human behavior is that almost no one ﬁts neatly
into any one area and in order to be effective at work (and in life), we need to
expand our repertoire to include as least a few of the traits from outside our normal
preferences. If you are an extroverted, intuitive, feeling, perception type, you’re going
to either ﬁnd a job that requires those skills and traits or you’re going to have to
learn a few new tricks. Most of the time, our jobs and lives require us to ﬂex
between traits in order to be successful and most of us do pretty well.
Another very popular and useful system is the DiSC proﬁle system, which is a
bit more oriented to the work environment. Some people ﬁnd it less threatening
than Myers-Briggs because it is more focused on work styles and behaviors. DiSC
uses four main traits to describe primary work styles, though don’t get thrown off by
the terminology.These are:
www.syngress.com
122
Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

■
Dominance The person who primarily exhibits dominance is someone
who wants to get things done—they are outcome-oriented and they want
to get results. In shorthand, these folks are called “D’s.”
■
Inﬂuence The person who primarily exhibits inﬂuence is someone who
wants to inﬂuence or persuade others.They tend to like to interact with
others. In shorthand, these folks are called “I’s.”
■
Conscientiousness The person who primarily exhibits conscientiousness is
someone who likes to work within existing circumstances to ensure quality
and accuracy.They tend to be highly organized and rule-oriented.These
folks are often referred to as “C’s.”
■
Steadiness The person who primarily exhibits steadiness prefers to get
results through teamwork and cooperation.They tend to be very good with
people and are good at keeping the team together and functioning well.
These folks are called “S’s.”
Many CEOs, business leaders and entrepreneurs are primarily D’s—they want to
get the job done and they’re all about the results.The expression “Ready, ﬁre, aim” can
describe a D who’s in a frenzy since D’s often want to act ﬁrst and think later. In the
extreme, they can disregard or break rules to get results, which is not a desirable expres-
sion of the D work style. Some leaders who are also quite charismatic might be termed
“DI’s” meaning they tend to use both dominance and inﬂuence in equal measure.
The inﬂuence pattern without any other letters (no D, S, or C) is someone who
is highly interactive and needs to have a job in which they interact regularly with
others.They typically avoid going into technical ﬁelds because they want to work
with people, not machines.They make great counselors, but if they lack any other
“letters,” they’ll probably have a tough time in the IT world.
The world of programmers, engineers, and accountants is ﬁlled with people
whose primary trait is C (conscientiousness).They are organized, like to think
through problems before tackling them (just the opposite of the D personality) and
like structure, quality, and accuracy ﬁrst and foremost.
Finally, the last trait is the person who exhibits steadiness, the S. He or she is the
person that always makes sure everyone in the room knows each other’s names, will
make sure everyone has a chair to sit in or will make sure everyone feels included in
the meeting.They’re natural hosts and hostesses and they typically work well alone
or in a group.
As you can see, the Myers-Briggs and the DiSC terminology are different, but they
have a lot in common.They describe how people prefer to work, what their natural
tendencies are.You might be sitting here thinking this is all a bunch of psychological
www.syngress.com

mumbo jumbo, but read on. Understanding these tendencies does two important
things for you. First, you will be able to leverage people’s natural styles and get them
working in ways that are most comfortable for them.When you can do this, you
increase their job satisfaction and their productivity while reducing their stress (and
yours). Sound interesting now? The second beneﬁt is that your job of managing the
department or project team will be much easier if you understand how each team
member naturally operates.You can assign them appropriate tasks and leverage their
natural styles while minimizing or mitigating their shortcomings.This is really much
easier than you might at ﬁrst think. In the next section, we’re going to talk about these
work styles, using the four primary work traits.You’ll learn how to discern someone’s
primary style and then you’ll learn what the pros and cons are of each style.You’ll also
see how these traits can be used in positive ways and how they sometimes show up as
negative traits.
Before we jump into that, let’s look at an example that will drive this concept
home. If you have a huge IT project and you’re working on putting together the
project plan, you obviously need to take some time to plan. (OK, most of us know
we should, not all of us do, but more on that later in the book). If you have a bunch
of people who are doers, they want to jump in and get the job done and you’re
going to have to restrain them until it’s time to actually go do something. On the
other hand, if you have folks that we’ll call the analysts, they’re the ones who enjoy,
in fact, need to plan and get all the details locked down.You want to leverage their
natural abilities to enhance your project plan, but you’ll also have to make sure they
don’t get “analysis paralysis” and fail to get to the “doing” stage. When you have a
mixture of folks on a team, you can see now that these various traits can really help
you plan, deﬁne, organize, implement, and manage your project.Your job as the pro-
ject manager becomes slightly easier when you can rely upon people’s natural traits
rather than asking someone to do something so far outside their natural abilities that
it’s difﬁcult (or impossible) for them to do. Don’t misinterpret this—we all have to
do things in our jobs that we’d rather not do or that we’re not as skilled at.The
point is that anytime you can assign a task or job to someone that aligns with their
natural abilities, they’ll be more likely to deliver a high-quality result in a timely
manner. It’s just another tool in your IT project manager tool bag that you can use
to make everyone’s life just a bit more productive without added stress.
While the systems described earlier are helpful, they’re not required in order to
understand basic work styles or work behaviors.These types of assessments can be
helpful in understanding your own work style as well as that of your team. However,
rather than refer speciﬁcally to one “system”, we’ll paint the picture with broad
strokes so you can learn how understanding work styles can greatly beneﬁt you and
your team. Remember that none of the work personalities described is absolute—
www.syngress.com
124
Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

most people have a predominant trait or style and one or more subordinate traits.
The predominant trait is the one that almost always shows up under pressure because
it’s what’s most natural and least stressful.The subordinate traits often are used when
the situation is more relaxed and the person can take time to determine the best
course of action.The terminology used is not speciﬁc to any one system and is used
to describe the predominant work style.
Many people fall under the broad category of doers.They want to get things
done, they jump into action at the ﬁrst opportunity.These folks are often the ones
that get initiatives going, that take steps to put plans into action.The downside of
this type of work personality is that they often don’t take time to think and plan.
They simply jump into the action that seems most appropriate at the time.
Sometimes that’s ﬁne because the action didn’t require much planning. Other times,
they have to either re-think or re-work what they’ve already done because they
failed to take time to plan before acting.
A second major category of work personalities is that of the interactive person-
ality.This person almost always wants to talk things through and the conversation
often centers around that person and their relationship to the work.This is the kind
of person that can help bring the doer back to earth and get a conversation going
about how to approach the project or problem.This type of person will often call or
stop by your ofﬁce to respond to an e-mail you sent because they prefer personal
interaction to e-mails or phone calls.Typically, these people are found in jobs that
involve interacting with others people frequently and are less represented in the IT
ﬁeld.The downside of this personality type is that they can focus the conversation
on them and distract the group from discussing the more relevant issues.They can
also be time wasters because what could have been a quick three-word response in
e-mail from them becomes a 20 minute conversation in your ofﬁce.
The third work personality type is that of the team player.This person often
works to assess the team environment and works to ensure that everyone on the
team is participating.The team player will be interactive, as will the interactive
person just discussed, but the point of the interaction is to ensure the overall func-
tionality of the team. It’s not about the team player, it’s not about any one individual
on the team; it’s about everyone working together in as an efﬁcient team.This
person will often subordinate his or her own needs to ensure the team’s needs are
met.The downside of this type of personality is that they can overlook their own
needs or become too involved with the team and its dynamics to be effective.They
sometimes can be too nice in trying to get the team together.
The fourth major work personality type is that of the analyst.This person is the
type (often found in IT and very often in programming, engineering, and accounting
positions) that enjoys understanding every last detail so he or she can organize things.
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
125

He or she is often excellent with detail and will spend time keeping things orderly.
This type of work personality is useful for analyzing data, for dealing with details on a
daily basis, and for organizing large amounts of detail.This type of person may often be
seen as the person that says “that’s not going to work” because they have already given
thought to a topic and have drawn their conclusions.The downside of this personality
type is that they can be seen as the naysayers in the group, throwing a wet rag on every
proposed idea as they point out the shortcomings.They may also have difﬁculty ﬁn-
ishing tasks on time (or at all) because they may feel they do not have sufﬁcient data to
make a decision or come to a conclusion.
Managing Different Work Styles
One of the ﬁrst things to understand about work styles is that there is no good or bad,
right or wrong work style. Certainly some work styles are more appropriate or helpful
in certain positions. For instance, if you have someone who’s primarily interactive and
needs to discuss things at length, he or she may not fare well as a programmer whose
primary job is to sit in a room and write code six hours a day. If someone is a doer and
is prone to just jumping in and getting things started, he or she might not be the best
person to manage the corporate ﬁnances unless that person also has the ability to deal
with detail. Someone who is a team player may not do well as a sole contributor at a
remote corporate location because they are most comfortable (and most effective) as
part of a highly functioning team.Your job, as IT manager or project manager, is to
leverage the skills, talents, and personalities of your team in order to get the best pos-
sible result.That means learning to maximize the strengths of each work style and
minimize the weaknesses of that style. In this section, we’ll brieﬂy look at how you can
best manage people with these predominate work styles.
Managing A Doer
The doer prefers action to talk, planning, or waiting. Managing these folks means
learning to temper their desire to jump right in without completely removing their
ability to take action. When these folks want to just get started, your job will be to
ask them to do some planning ﬁrst. Since planning is an action, it is compatible with
this work style; it’s just that planning is not their natural ﬁrst course of action.
Helping them to understand that planning will allow them to move forward faster
and more effectively is often all it takes.These folks are usually outcome-oriented,
meaning they are most interested in the outcome or end point.As a result, they’re
often willing to ﬂex their personal style in order to get the job done. Helping the
doers to take time to think and plan before acting will make them far more effective
in the long run.Asking the doer for a plan of action prior to implementation will
www.syngress.com
126
Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

help slow them down just enough to help them get their thoughts in order. Since
errors, omissions, and re-work are a major source of expense in any project, it’s crit-
ical that these doers are engaged in the planning process early on to avoid potential
problems later.A summary of traits is shown in Table 4.1.The traits are divided into
personal tendencies, environmental factors, and team composition. Each trait has
positive characteristics, shown on the left side of the table, and each trait has negative
potential, shown on the right side of the table.The types of people on a team that
balance out this work style are listed at the bottom of the table. Remember that no
one is absolutely all one style, so these are broad descriptions that should be helpful
in identifying the primary work style.

Managing An Interactive
An interactive person prefers talk to action, planning, or waiting. Managing these
folks means you’ll need to provide an outlet for discussion and provide ample
opportunity for this person to engage with others.Again, these kinds of people are
typically under-represented in IT, so you may know of people like this, but do not
directly manage them.These kinds of folks often gravitate toward sales and mar-
keting, which are highly interactive positions (for the most part).To effectively
manage these folks, you need to provide them the opportunity to interact with
others.You’ll also need to keep an eye on the discussion to ensure it drives the
meeting objectives and doesn’t get bogged down in chit chat. Interactive types can
be great on a team because they often bring a natural ease with people and can have
a valuable role on the team in terms of getting people talking and interacting. Just
don’t let it get out of hand. Provide the interactive person with opportunities to
work with others in a structured (or outcome-oriented) environment and provide
speciﬁc deliverables to keep interactions on track.
Table 4.2 delineates the interactive work style.As with the previous table, the
three main categories are the personal tendencies, the environment, and the team.
Any of the personal or environmental traits can be positive, but they both have their
negative potential.The bottom section of the table shows you what kinds of people
they should be around and work with to balance their natural tendencies.

Managing A Team Player
A team player prefers working as part of a team to working individually. He or she
will strive to make sure the needs of the team are met. In or out of work, they’re
often the person described as “nice” (in a good way).They’re the person that is often
sought out for advice or consolation, the person that makes everyone in the room
feel comfortable.As a member of a team, they’ll strive to work with others to
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
129

achieve the group’s goals.That doesn’t mean that he or she is not a solid sole con-
tributor—just the opposite in most cases.The team player will hold up his or her
end of the bargain by getting their work done on time and to speciﬁcation.They
often believe that their job is to be the best team member they can while helping to
iron out differences between other team members. If you have someone on your
team that is a team player, leverage their ability to bring team members together, but
watch that they do not overextend themselves helping others. Sometimes they’ll take
on others’ duties in an effort to be helpful, but this can lead to burn out, resentment,
and lack of accountability.You’ll need to keep team players focused on their own
jobs, their own responsibilities and duties, and you may need to help them draw
boundaries to avoid them taking on too much or taking on tasks for someone who
is underperforming. Encourage team players to report team problems to you so you
can resolve them rather than having the team member take them on.
Table 4.3 shows the traits of the team player work style.Again, the table shows
the personal tendencies, the work environment, and the type of team members that
complement this style.The positive and negative potentials are shown to help you
recognize these traits.

Positive Traits
Potential Negative Traits
Works well on a team that includes others who:
Take risks, enjoy change
Can become involved in multiple tasks
and priorities
Are ﬂexible in work procedures
Managing An Analyst
The analyst is someone who prefers to think rather than act.This work style is some-
times unfairly labeled as negative because he or she can often see what’s wrong with
a particular course of action—sometimes long before anyone else sees it. Human
nature being what it is, most of us are reluctant to be told we’re wrong and we often
resist information proving us so.The analyst is sometimes seen as gruff or rude
though that is usually not their intent.As a result, their information can sometimes
be discarded because of how it’s delivered. If you manage this work style (and
chances are good you do, because this work personality is often found in the IT
arena), you may need to help this person work on his or her delivery so the message
is more accepted. Others with this work style are very diplomatic and precise in
their delivery—it all depends on how they display these analytical traits.They’ll often
need to learn to present their ideas and opinions in ways less offensive or abrasive to
the group, but once mastered, they can be highly diplomatic.
You may also have to work with these analysts to provide speciﬁc details on
deliverables as well as deadlines.Those with a strong analyst work style can feel there
is insufﬁcient information to draw conclusions or complete a project and as a result,
they can fail to deliver on time. Create multiple checkpoints and ask questions that
elicit information from them so you can help them move toward conclusion.Asking
yes/no questions or making blanket demands (“I need that report by Friday
morning, ok?”) will probably not work. Instead, say “I need the XYZ report by
Friday at noon. What will it take for you to complete this?”They may need to go
back to their desk, think about it, analyze it, and then return with an answer.
Allowing them to do so will result in far better outcomes.
Table 4.4 delineates the analyst’s traits.The personal tendencies and the work
environment show that there are both positive and negative traits that can surface.
Clearly, aiming for the positive traits is the goal for each work style.The bottom sec-
tion of the table shows the types of team members that will complement the analyst
style so your team can be highly productive.

Managing For Success
This is a true story, though all the names have been changed to avoid embar-
rassing anyone.
A director of client services (we’ll call him David) for a large, international
company was having trouble with an employee we’ll call Chris. Chris was very
bright and had come up through the ranks quickly. He was well qualiﬁed for his
job as a department manager overseeing service delivery for three clients and
managing a staff of about 200. The problem David was having was that Chris
was missing deadlines for deliverables left and right. Here’s one conversation:
David: Chris, we discussed getting these quarterly reports ready before the last
week of the quarter, but yours is late again. What’s going on?
Chris: Well, I was working on it but I wasn’t able to get it done on time.
David: We’ve discussed the importance of timeliness a number of times, haven’t
we?
Chris: Yes.
David: Alright. I need this report by Friday at noon at the latest. OK?
Chris: OK. Sorry.
David: Let me know if you need any assistance with this. OK?
Chris: OK. 
If you’re a quick study, you can imagine what happened on Friday. No quar-
terly report. David was irate, as you can imagine, because he thought he had
Chris’s buy-in on the timeline. Where did David go wrong? What could he do dif-
ferently in the future?
David himself is predominately a doer, as you might be able to tell from the
rather quick, no-nonsense discussion he had with Chris. He wants results and he
wants them now. This, in itself, can be a bit intimidating to some of his staff,
especially those analyst types like Chris who want to think long and hard about
things and get organized and get every possible detail before proceeding. These
two styles can be diametrically opposed to one another and can spell trouble
unless David ﬁgures out how to manage a style so different from his own.
David was frustrated and called a consultant, Patty, whom he had worked
with in the past and asked if she could help. Patty came to the rescue. She knew
that David was on the verge of ﬁring Chris and she made David promise her that
no such action would be taken until she’d had a chance to talk with both of them
privately. David promised, but was highly skeptical. He was reluctant to have to
completely change his own management style to accommodate one of his staff.
Patty assured David he would not have to completely change, but he would have
to make a few minor changes to his approach. David agreed to give it a shot. 
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
133
Continued

After talking with Chris, Patty set up a meeting with David. Though she did
not share any speciﬁcs from the private conversation she’d had with Chris, she
did share her impressions. She told David she thought Chris was competent and
highly motivated to do a good job. David almost screamed, “Then why can’t he
do anything I ask of him?” Patty explained that Chris was, underneath, a bit
afraid of David’s fast-paced, get-it-done style and was reluctant to say no to any-
thing David asked. Patty also explained that Chris was often not sure exactly what
was being asked of him and that David rarely gave him much detail to work with
or time to think things through. David’s perspective was that either Chris knew
or would ask, but that was apparently not the case.
Patty’s suggestion to David: Don’t ask Chris yes/no questions such as “OK?”
or “Got it?” Instead, give Chris an assignment then ask Chris to go think about it
and come up with a plan, suggestion, or proposed course of action. Have Chris
come back in a day or two, having had time (but not too much time) to think
about it and to have a discussion about the deliverable including what else Chris
might need, additional details Chris might ask about (that David may not have
even considered), or potential pitfalls (that David may not have been aware of).
David agreed to try this. Chris’s assignment from Patty was to ask questions to
clarify assignments, to raise issues as he saw them (which he now understood
David actually valued) and to say “Yes” only when he meant it.
The next time David met with Chris, he gave Chris the assignment and then
asked how soon Chris would be ready to come back and discuss how to proceed,
knowing the report was due in three weeks. Chris came back a few days later
fully prepared, asked some excellent questions, got needed clariﬁcation and
boundaries (what the assignment included and did not include) and went off to
do his project. David checked in with Chris a week later and Chris reported
making good progress. A week later, on the due date, Chris presented David with
the report he needed. It was an excellent, thorough, and comprehensive report
that not only provided David with the required information, but some additional
analysis that was quite helpful. Needless to say, David was thrilled with the
turnaround and Chris was relieved to ﬁnally have been able to complete his job
according to David’s speciﬁcations.
This is a true story. With just a minor adjustment to how David approached
Chris’s assignments, both were able to get what they needed. David simply had
to slow down a bit (which, ultimately, was a good thing for him anyway) and
allow Chris (and his other analyst types) to think, plan, analyze, and ask ques-
tions. The end of the story is that Chris went on to be a stellar performer on
David’s team and was promoted two years later into a key role.
Lesson Learned: If you’re not getting the results you need or expect from a
team or staff members, they may need to be managed slightly differently. Think
about how the person tends to work and interact and try to ﬁnd ways to give
them more of what they need. In this case, Chris needed more guidance and time
to think about a project than David had given him. In other cases, someone
might need more time to talk a project through or to work with the team to
ﬁgure out the best options. While you can’t (and shouldn’t) completely change

your natural management style to accommodate each member of the team, you
should ﬁnd ways to ﬂex your management style to get the best possible result
from each individual team member. Sometimes an outside consultant can help
you and your team make those minor adjustments that improve productivity and
job satisfaction signiﬁcantly if you’re unable to determine the best course of
action. However, very often with a bit of thought and observation, you can ﬁgure
these primary traits out and work more effectively—either as the project manager
or even as a team member. Just keep in mind that almost no one is all one trait,
we are usually some blend of two or three primary traits. By learning to work
with your team’s work styles, your stress and the stress of your team will go
down while the quality goes up. How’s that for a win-win situation?
Culture Matters
We’ve talked about traits on a personal level—what creates job satisfaction (and dis-
satisfaction) and how people tend to approach work.Another important element in
understanding and managing your team is to recognize that we often operate in a
multicultural environment.Today’s teams are likely to be diverse.That diversity
includes people of different races, religions, national origins, ethnicities, gender, ages,
and languages. If you’re managing a team across geographic boundaries, you know
how time differences and cultural and language differences can all make managing a
highly productive team that much more difﬁcult. In this section, we’ll discuss some
of the challenges and discuss ways to address those challenges. If you manage a
diverse team, this section will give you several important skills as a starting point to
improving your cross-cultural management skills.
Managing People From Different Cultures
Managing people from different cultures is becoming more and more common as
technology brings together people from across the globe in real time. It’s not unusual
in some companies to have a project team comprised of people from several coun-
tries.This leads to challenges that involve time, language, and culture. While we can’t
address every possible nuance of communicating across cultural boundaries, this sec-
tion will highlight some of the common challenges and give you tools to begin to
explore and address these challenges.
Culture and Language Differences
Language and culture play a huge part in how people communicate.Though English
is becoming more universally accepted as a primary language in business, that doesn’t
mean that everyone who speaks English as a second language is comfortable with
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
135

English. If you took a few Spanish or French classes in high school, think about how
comfortable you would have been sitting in a restaurant in Spain (or Mexico) or a
high-powered business meeting in France having a conversation with native speakers.
It’s important to remember that even though others may speak English, they may not
be entirely comfortable with the language.This is critical to recognize because it
means that business conversations that take place over communication links (phone,
video conferencing, etc.) must be paced so that native and non-native speakers are
comfortable. One of the common observations made about Americans in interna-
tional business settings is that we talk a lot and we talk fast.We like to talk ideas out,
think out loud, discuss, debate, and conclude.To those whose culture does not
emphasize that, it can be daunting. Couple that with English as a second language
and these non-native speakers can quickly get lost in a rapid-ﬁre business conversa-
tion. It also means that phrases, idioms, and slang that we might use without thought
will be confusing and perhaps even offensive to these non-native speakers.To avoid
these potential problems:
1.
Learn to pronounce and spell names. OK, this is incredibly basic, but you’d
be surprised how many people say,“Hey, will you get that UNIX guy from
Bangalore on the phone—what’s his name, I can’t pronounce it, it starts
with a P.” Learn to pronounce your team member’s names. Even if you
have to ask twenty times how to properly pronounce someone’s name, it’s
better than saying,“Hey, is the Indian guy on the line right now?”Ask
them if they use that name or another name. For instance, in the
Philippines, it’s not uncommon to have two ﬁrst names and several sur-
names.As a result, names are often combined into unique nicknames. Maria
Luisa Hernandez Fuentes Marquez might be known as “Malu” (a combina-
tion of Maria and Luisa).You may also run into difﬁcult situations where
the person’s name is not a desirable name in the U.S. such as names that are
slang words in the U.S. or names such as “Baby” or “Boy” that seem odd or
inappropriate to use to address a team member or employee.
2.
Create meeting agendas that are short and concise.This helps keep
everyone focused on the important topics and helps prevent rambling and
straying off course.
3.
Keep conversation focused on the meeting agenda. If it rambles and
includes unrelated topics, non-native speakers may become confused about
the conversation.
4.
If discussion is needed, make sure to speciﬁcally ask your team members
from around the globe for their input. Some cultures are reluctant to speak
www.syngress.com
136
Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

up unless directly spoken to. Make sure you consciously request their input.
This will also help ensure they comprehend the discussion and are partici-
pating fully.
5.
Clarify terminology. Don’t assume that others understand what you mean
by words such as “meeting,”“report,”“presentation,” or “deliverable”—these
things may mean entirely different things in other cultures and making
everyone comfortable with the common business language you use is crit-
ical for success.
6.
Avoid yes/no questions.Ask questions that require an answer.This helps
ensure the questions are understood and that the responses are based on
understanding rather than confusion. Some cultures are naturally more
inclined to say “yes” to a yes/no question, even if they’re confused or don’t
understand.
7.
Avoid jokes and sarcasm. Jokes and sarcasm usually don’t translate well and
non-native English speakers may become confused, or worse, insulted if
they do not understand the tone or the nature of the humor.
8.
Listen more than you speak.Americans like to talk and talk some more. If
you’re the project manager and your team is comprised of people from
around the world, spend time actively listening to what is being said and to
what is not being said.
9.
Ask for negative information. In some cultures, it’s rude to mention prob-
lems; it’s considered a sign of failure.Americans are fairly open about dis-
cussing problems and brainstorming solutions, so make sure you take time
with people from other cultures to encourage their honest assessments.This is
critical because with a global team, you may not ﬁnd out about a problem
until much later than you might if you were working with a local team.
10.
Communicate frequently. Managing a successful project involves making
small, incremental changes throughout the course of the project so it stays
on course (more on that later in this book).These small changes are even
more necessary when you’re working with a global team. If part of the pro-
ject team is 6,000 miles away, it will be harder to notice when the project is
slipping off course. Frequent communication is part of the key to keeping a
global project on track.
11.
Learn about the culture.You’d probably be surprised by how many global
project team managers don’t bother to learn about the cultures of their
team members.Things that Americans consider normal business matters
may not be so normal in other countries.Asking someone to work on one
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
137

of their national holidays without regard for that holiday would cause the
same problem as if you were asked to work on Memorial Day or July
Fourth.You might still need to have that person work on that national hol-
iday, but you would recognize it the same way you would with an
American team members—“I’m sorry you have to work on that day, I
know you were looking forward to a day off.” Learn about “hot button”
issues and behaviors that are considered polite (or rude) so you can interact
with team members in a manner conducive to getting results.
12.
Invest in cross-culture awareness training for your team. If you’re going to
be working with people from other countries for extended periods of time,
you would do well to get some formal training to develop openness and
awareness of cultural perspectives.You and your team will not only learn a
lot about how other cultures work, live, and think, but you’ll also learn a
tremendous amount about the assumptions you make about how people
work, live, and think. It can be a deeply enriching experience and it will
certainly improve your team’s efﬁciency and success.
13.
Learn to use meeting time and non-meeting time wisely. Many productive
global teams use face-to-face (or virtual face-to-face) meetings to handle hot
issues or to develop group understanding and personal commitment.They
use non-meeting time to work on tasks and to perform tasked-based com-
munication. By understanding the best use of meeting and non-meeting
time, you can use precious meeting time for developing the group and allow
the task-based communication to happen through e-mail, document collabo-
ration, instant messaging, etc. Don’t rush through the process and team
building parts to get right to the tasks. Spend time building a cohesive team;
it will be an investment that pays back major dividends for you.
14.
Invest in communication technology. It almost goes without saying that you
need your cross-cultural teams to be able to communicate effectively—in
real time when possible (though with time differences, this is clearly a chal-
lenge). Using collaboration software, communication technologies such as
net meetings, video conferencing, instant messaging, e-mail, blogs, wikis,
and collaboration management tools will greatly enhance the team’s efforts.
While nothing can replace the occasional need for face-to-face meetings,
intelligent use of these communication and collaboration technologies will
help bridge the gap.And remember that the lone guy/gal in the outskirts
of Belfast or Mexico City needs to be just as connected as the team in
Atlanta, Georgia.

The IT Factor…
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
If you learn to value and respect cultural differences, you’ll manage cross-cultural
teams more effectively. People around the world want to be respected—for who
they are and what they bring to the table. Showing respect by learning to pro-
nounce difﬁcult names, understanding what’s important to various team mem-
bers, and including everyone on your team equally is not all that difﬁcult—it just
takes time and willingness to make a conscious effort. Once you do, you’ll be
rewarded by a broader global view and a cohesive team that is ready to take on
the challenges of the project.
Values Differences
Americans work hard and play hard. Other cultures take a different view of work,
play, and life. Even within the U.S., different regions and subcultures view work, play,
and life slightly differently. We cannot simply assume that what is important to us,
our company, or our clients is the same in other cultures,whether those cultures are
across town or across the world.
Successful cross-cultural teams work well together by recognizing and respecting
the various cultures.The IT project manager must ensure the team is productive in a
culturally appropriate manner. He or she must also know which issues are perfor-
mance-related and which are cultural. It’s also important that the project manager
avoid alienating employees or accidentally offending them. Part of this involves
understanding the values and mores of other cultures and working with those in an
effective manner.Again, there are numerous challenges here, but we’ll highlight a
few to get you started.
1.
When yes means no. In many cultures, it’s rude to say no. When posed a
yes/no question, some people will answer yes when they actually mean no.
As mentioned earlier, one of the ways to avoid this and to get better infor-
mation is to ask questions that require an explanation rather than yes/no.
2.
Work ethic. Many Americans work long hours and put their lives and fami-
lies second. In many countries, family is far more important than work or
career advancement. Understanding the relative importance of work and
family (or work/non-work time) is important in terms of motivating and
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
139

rewarding a cross-cultural project team.Asking someone to work overtime
or not allowing time off for an important family event can be absolutely
unimaginable in some cultures.
3.
Managing conﬂict.Americans, for the most part, are fairly comfortable with
debating a topic or disagreeing with someone in a business setting
(assuming the right environment). In other cultures, disagreement, conﬂict,
or heated discussions are avoided. Understanding how to manage conﬂict
on a cross-cultural team is important because some of the conﬂict may not
surface in ways you’re accustomed to. Many Americans will voice their dis-
satisfaction, in private or in public, in order to hammer out a resolution. In
some cultures, there may be no outward sign that there is a problem. Well,
let’s revise that.To you, the American project manager communicating from
6,000 miles away, there may be no recognizable sign there is a problem. It’s
entirely possible that folks from that other culture in the same room may
instantly recognize the problem, even if it’s not verbalized. Understanding
how to recognize dissent and conﬂict on a cross-cultural team and how to
manage it is critical to success.
4.
Personal information.The amount of personal information people are
willing to share about themselves varies widely—not only from culture to
culture, but even within cultures. Many Americans are seen as being fairly
open about themselves and this can lead to embarrassment or discomfort by
other team members. Conversely,Americans may tend to view other cul-
tures as standofﬁsh, distant, remote, closed, or secretive if they are not natu-
rally inclined to talk about themselves (or talk as much as we do about
anything). Some Americans may view other cultures as being too emo-
tional, too “touchy-feely,” or too open. Ensure that all team members
respect appropriate boundaries.
5.
Criticism. How and when constructive criticism is given varies widely from
culture to culture. In some cultures, any negative feedback is devastating
and is a sign of abject failure. In other cultures, that same feedback is just
part of the job. Learning the language of criticism and constructive feed-
back is vital since not everyone on your project team will be perfect all the
time.Your criticism should be delivered in a way that corrects the problem
without demotivating (or devastating) the recipient.This can be tricky, but
taking time to learn how this can be handled smoothly will make your
team more effective. We’ll look at that in more detail later because you’ll
need to manage your team’s performance and do so without destroying
people’s egos along the way.

Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

6.
Individuality.As much as we might want to lump everyone from a partic-
ular culture into one category, that’s not any more appropriate than
lumping all Americans into one category.Are all Americans the same? Of
course not. Every individual is different and may not follow all the cultural
norms you expect. Remember that when dealing with cross-cultural
teams—understand and respect their culture and work with each person as
an individual.
Feedback In A Diverse Environment
Successfully managing your cross-cultural team means investing time and resources
into understanding other cultures and informing your team about the various cul-
tures represented. It also means learning to effectively guide your team through the
project cycle.This frequently requires giving feedback to team participants—both
positive and negative—to get the needed results. In this section, we’ll look at some
of the common problems encountered with feedback and then provide speciﬁc solu-
tions you can evaluate using with your cross-cultural team.
If you’ve managed a cross-cultural team, one of these scenarios has probably
already happened to you. If you haven’t yet managed such a team, this is an example
what you might encounter:
■
A newly hired team member continues to skip an important step in a crit-
ical procedure. Each time you try to correct the problem, you meet with
subtle resistance.
■
One of your team members gave the wrong information to a client. When
you corrected him/her, he/she left the room quickly and quietly.
■
A deliverable turned in by a team member is way off the mark even
though you believe you clearly and repeatedly explained what was
expected.
These are all examples of situations that required feedback, but that didn’t turn
out as expected. If you’ve encountered one of these types of situations, you may have
walked away shaking your head in confusion. What happened? What went wrong?
Let’s look at some of the common cultural elements related to receiving feedback:
■
Saving Face Team members from some cultures may view negative feed-
back as shameful.You may notice inappropriate laughing, smiling, or
blushing.They may try to avoid feedback by not making eye contact, by
missing meetings where criticism might occur, or by simply clamming up.
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
141

■
Maintaining Harmony In some cultures, maintaining a harmonious
environment is paramount.This can contribute to people saying yes when
they mean no. If a team member continues to say yes, but repeats the mis-
take or undesirable behavior, chances are good there’s a communication
problem going on.
■
Respecting Authority Some cultures have an absolute respect for
authority, which means they are likely to follow your feedback, instructions,
or criticisms to the letter. In the U.S., it’s not uncommon for someone to
discuss or even disagree with feedback from an authority ﬁgure if they
believe the feedback is incorrect. Some cultures will not question the
instruction or feedback, even if it is blatantly wrong, out of respect.
■
Blaming Fate Some cultures believe strongly in outside or external con-
trol of events.They may truly believe that fate (or something similar) was at
work.Americans typically believe they control events and often view the
blaming of external factors as avoiding responsibility.
■
Relating vs.Working Some cultures value the relationship between
people at work as much or more than the tasks they are assigned.
Americans are typically fairly task-oriented; we want to get the job done as
quickly as possible. Other cultures may ﬁnd this off-putting, rude, or cold.
In other cultures, creating and maintaining the relationship is as important
as what gets done. Employees from these cultures may feel that their rela-
tionship with the boss, their seniority, or their status in the group is more
critical to success than following the task-oriented procedures given in the
feedback.
■
Separating Self From Results Some cultures view results and self as
inseparable, so to criticize one’s work is to criticize that person. In the U.S.,
managers are taught to correct the behavior and not to make it personal. In
some cultures, correcting the behavior is inherently personal and you
cannot criticize work without also criticizing the person.
■
Emphasizing Group versus Individual Americans are known to be
focused on the individual. While we may work well in groups, we funda-
mentally deﬁne ourselves by our individual uniqueness. In other cultures,
the group is far more important than the individual and individual tastes,
desires, and preferences are sublimated to the group. In this setting, having
one’s performance singled out, for positive or negative feedback, is embar-
rassing and to them, perhaps even inappropriate. If they are singled out for
praise, they may be viewed as disloyal to the group.

Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

Now, as you’ve read through this list, you might be thinking,“How am I ever
going to successfully manage a cross-cultural team?” Well, the good news is that with
a bit of effort on your part, you can understand, appreciate, and leverage cultural dif-
ferences to create a highly effective team. Let’s discuss a few ideas you can consider
using when you have to provide feedback in a cross-cultural team setting.
1.
Build a relationship ﬁrst. If you have developed a relationship with your
team members before giving feedback, you’re more likely to understand
their cultural biases and conditioning so you can ﬁnd the most effective
way to provide feedback.
2.
Assure the individual of your respect. This is closely related to
building the relationship, but it’s important that the individual receiving
feedback understand that you provide the feedback out of respect.This can
help mitigate some of the negative cultural values associated with criticism.
3.
Try to emphasize how the feedback will beneﬁt the recipient. If
the person understands what value or beneﬁt is in it for them, he or she is
more likely to be receptive to the feedback.This applies to anyone in any
culture, but is doubly important in cross-cultural communication.
4.
Use the passive rather than active voice. In the U.S., we’re taught to
write and speak in the active voice, which can be intimidating to people in
cultures that are used to the passive voice.The active voice starts with the
word “I” or “You”.The passive voice omits these. Here are some examples
(active then passive):
■
“You didn’t ﬁnish the report on time” versus “The report was not
ﬁnished on time.”
■
“I asked you to report back to me by 3:00 P.M.” versus “The report
was needed at 3:00 P.M.”
■
“You gave the wrong information to the client” versus “The wrong
information was given to the client.”
■
“You were asked to help Noelle with that task last week” versus
“Noelle needed help with that task last week.”
5.
Use an intermediary. In some cultures, authority and criticism are a dif-
ﬁcult combination. In some instances, you may be able to use an interme-
diary to deliver the feedback. While we in the U.S. might view that as
ducking a responsibility, in some instances, it can allow the recipient to save
face.You might ask an appropriate intermediary,“I’d like to help Jawara, but
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
143

I’m don’t want to offend him. What would you suggest?” or “Yi Min,
would you work with Jawara to ﬁnd a way to address the vendor issue?”
6.
Keep it private. In an American meeting, it might be ﬁne to say,“Hey,
Bill, what were you thinking when you told the vendor they could deliver
the computers two weeks late?” Bill might take it as a friendly jab, but get
the message that he’d made an error. In cross-cultural teams, you should
avoid these kinds of exchanges. Instead, talk with the person privately and
in a low-key manner. Keep your voice soft, slow your rate of speech, and
reduce the potential for embarrassment or defensiveness.
7.
State what you do want. Rather than stating the negative—“Don’t do
this again”—frame the feedback in a more positive manner.“In the future,
please use this new procedure.”Again, this is subtle, but can avoid someone
losing face.And it never hurts to state exactly what you do expect so there
are no assumptions made about expectations.
8.
Give feedback to the group. If you are dealing with a culture that is
very group-oriented, you would do well to give the feedback to the entire
group rather than the individual.Though to our American minds this may
not make sense, to some it is the only acceptable method of providing
feedback.
The IT Factor…
Slow Down
The American culture is known for being fast-faced and results-oriented. There’s
nothing wrong with that except when it clashes with the culture of key project
team members. Then it becomes counter-productive. Rather than changing your
style, work to tone it down a bit. If you slow down, listen a little more and com-
municate in a more deliberate manner, you’ll probably do just ﬁne.

Continued

communications and managing a team goes triple for global teams.
Communicate more often using more methods. Be very aware of the language
you use, make sure everyone has the same understanding of terminology, com-
monly used phrases and jargon, and listen more than you talk.”
Though this is not an exhaustive list of potential pitfalls and solutions, it will
give you food for thought.Taking time to understand the culture(s) you’re dealing
with shows respect and will help generate far better results than if you ignore cul-
tural differences and assume everyone is operating under the same set of assumptions
you are.
Managing Across the Generations
We’ve looked at working with teams that include people from different cultures, but
what about when those different cultures are generational? In the U.S., we have
Boomers, GenX, GenNext, Echos, and many other terms for the various generations
currently in the country (and consequently, in the work force). Dealing with teams
that include people in their 20’s, 40’s, and 60’s can make for a very interesting team
dynamic. In this section, we’ll explore some of the differences between the genera-
tions and discuss strategies for working effectively regardless of age.The good news is
that some of what you learned earlier in this chapter about dealing with cross-cul-
tural teams can be applied toward working with generational differences.
We all know that there are certain stereotypes about different generations.
Younger people may see older people as too cautious or too slow; older people may
see younger people as too reckless or too fast-paced. Certainly, generational stereo-
types have some basis in truth, but not everyone in a generation behaves in the same
manner. When we discuss generational differences in this section, we will be relying
on stereotypes based in truth. Still, many people in the generations we’ll discuss
might not fall into this neat deﬁnition. If you can ﬁnd ways to recognize and
leverage generational differences, you’ll have a more functional team when it’s all
said and done.
■
The Silent Generation The group was born in the U.S. before 1946. In
business today, they are the oldest workers.Their generation generally
believed in honesty, loyalty, and an honest day’s work for an honest day’s
wage.They are generally reliable workers who arrive on time to work and
to meetings and enjoy taking the whole weekend off from work.
■
The Boomer Generation The Baby Boomers were born roughly
between 1946 and 1960 (there are various opinions about the exact years
on all of these, all years are approximate).These folks were children of the
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
145

1960’s and 1970’s with the counterculture, hippies, Woodstock, and the
Vietnam War in the forefront of their formative years. Many have main-
tained some of the values from those times—openness, tolerance, and
acceptance.They are often noted for their desire for material success and
their pursuit of spiritual experience or knowledge.They have been por-
trayed in the media as the “Me” generation due to their focus of personal
success and pleasure.
■
Generation X These folks were born between 1965 and 1977 (those
between 1960 and 1965 are sometimes termed “cuspers” because they fall
into either group).They are typiﬁed by a strong connection to tradition
and traditional values, which in some ways is a response to their parents’
rejection of traditional values.Their parents were often busy with them-
selves (they were, after all, the “Me” generation) and their care was often
left to others—daycare, after school programs, babysitters, nannies, extracur-
ricular activities, and self-care (the term “latch key kids” was coined for
these kids).This resulted in a generation that was highly self-reliant. In
addition, they grew up with technology and are more comfortable than any
preceding generation with computers, the Internet, cell phones, and other
emerging technologies.
■
Generation Y These folks were born roughly between 1978 and 1988.
They came of age during an expansive economic cycle and as a result, they
tend to be a bit more optimistic than their older GenX siblings. Like
GenX’ers, they are also very comfortable with technology, having been
raised with PCs, the Internet, tiny cell phones, and television remotes.They
tend to be more oriented toward the “common good” and work to make
positive change in the world.
There are other variations, different terms, and additional segments of the popu-
lation that researchers may deﬁne and describe, but we’ll stick with these large seg-
ments that are commonly discussed. Now that we’ve identiﬁed broad trends, you
may begin to imagine some of the inherent problems you might ﬁnd on a team that
has a mix of generations. Some of the common “complaints” are described:
■
Older people are too rigid, too slow and don’t understand technology.
■
Middle-aged people are in it for themselves and don’t “get” technology.
■
Younger people act before thinking, they don’t care about the rules, have
no respect for authority, and have short attention spans.

Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

You may have heard these types of comments; you may have thought them
yourself.You probably know people that ﬁt these stereotypes completely and others
who don’t in any way ﬁt their generational description.As a project manager, you’ll
have to learn how to manage these different types of people in order to get your
team up and running. Here are a few suggestions:
1.
Have the team members talk about themselves, what they value, how they
approach work. Understanding differences makes them more manageable.
2.
Ask team members to identify their strengths and weaknesses and pair up
team members so they can learn from one another in two-way mentoring.
3.
Deﬁne your team’s mission clearly and concisely. Generational issues are less
likely to rear their heads when everyone understands what must be done
and why.
4.
Deﬁne each person’s role clearly so that everyone understands who’s doing
what and why.
5.
Leverage uniqueness. Find ways make the best use of each team member’s
background, skills, experience, temperament, work style (as discussed earlier
in this chapter), and interests. By making it about the work and not the
personal style, you can develop a much more effective team.
6.
Ditch job descriptions and titles. Sometimes on a team, it’s more effective
to divide up roles, responsibilities, work, and tasks based on skills, interest,
ability, and availability rather than by job title or job description.This can
provide a bit more latitude for everyone to gravitate toward what they can
do best rather than what their job title says they should do on the team.
7.
Help the team create conﬂict-resolution guidelines.The possibility for con-
ﬂict arises anytime two or more people work together. On a cross-genera-
tional team, the natural methods for addressing conﬂict may vary widely.
Having the team discuss and develop methods for resolving conﬂict before
it arises can help bridge generational gaps, especially those related to com-
municating and dealing with interpersonal conﬂict.
8.
Create a team environment that fosters respect, courtesy, and kindness. With
or without generational issues, working in a courteous environment brings
out the best in everyone.
Learning to recognize and respect generational differences will make you a better
project manager. Learning to leverage generational differences will make your team a
more effective project team.While everyone from one generation may not be exactly
alike, the culture and environment in which they were raised does have a signiﬁcant

and lasting impact on people of a particular generation.That said, it’s also important to
understand these same generational boundaries do not apply generically to people of
other cultures. For instance, 20-year-olds in India or Japan may be equally adept at
technology, but their view of the world and their approach to authority, team mem-
bers, and job responsibilities may be dramatically different than their U.S. counterparts.
If you’re working with a multigenerational, multicultural project team, you certainly
have your work cut out for you. If you can ﬁnd ways to encourage and enhance the
best traits of each, the team will have a rich, rewarding experience and you’ll have a
highly effective team.
Cheat Sheet…
The Pace of Work
Younger workers, for the most part, are always connected. They regularly check
e-mail, talk on cell phones, and surf the Internet to ﬁnd information, entertain-
ment, and answers. It’s not unusual for them to mix a bit of business with plea-
sure—on the weekends they may be likely to log in from home and respond to a
few e-mails then go out for pizza with friends. Older workers typically like more
deﬁned boundaries between work and home. Neither style is good or bad, but
as an IT project manager, you’ll need to learn to balance this. If your own style is
to be always connected, you must be careful not to negatively judge team mem-
bers who choose to “disconnect” over the weekend (unless, of course, there’s a
speciﬁc need for them to check in). Conversely, if you’re the type that likes those
deﬁned lines between work and home life, don’t expect your younger team
members to do the same. Recognizing those preferences and allowing them to
co-exist within a project team can be a bit of a challenge at ﬁrst, but over time it
will add to the team’s productivity. Watch for signs that one group is negatively
inﬂuencing or judging another group. For instance, if younger team members are
always connected, watch that they don’t begin excluding team members who
don’t check in even on days off. A sub-group culture can begin to form that
excludes others and that can be detrimental to the team. Keep your eyes open to
different work styles and make sure the team remains cohesive.
Men, Women, and Technology
Dr. Lawrence Summers, president of Harvard University, found himself in hot water
not long ago for making negative statements about women in science and technology.
www.syngress.com

Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

One thing he was right about is that women are underrepresented in science and tech-
nology ﬁelds.According to the U.S. Department of Labor, women make up about 45
percent of the workforce, but represent only 13.6 percent of boards of directors run-
ning Fortune 500 companies in the U.S.They represent only 9.3 percent of boards of
directors of technology companies. In 2003, women accounted for 10.4 percent of all
computer hardware engineers and 7.1 percent of electrical and electronics engineers in
the United States.Women hold just 9% of all CIO jobs in the U.S.They fared better as
computer and information systems managers, making up 30 percent of the work force
in this category, according to an article in the June 6, 2005 issue of Red Herring mag-
azine (www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=12217).The point is that women are
underrepresented in science and technology and those that are there have learned to
work effectively in a predominantly male environment.
The reason we’re discussing this is because you may or may not have a tech-
nology team that includes women. If you work with a cross-cultural team, you may
or may not have women from other countries on your team. How you deal with
men and women on your team has a lot to do with cultural norms. Understanding
what is and is not appropriate in various cultures is another important aspect of your
job as a manager or IT project manager. Certainly, treating everyone with respect is a
great starting point, but you’ll need to understand cultural differences between men
and women in other countries if you have a cross-cultural team. Some of the
common biases women may face on any IT team are difﬁculty having ideas taken
seriously, lack of credit for work done and lack of choice assignments. If you’re man-
aging a team that includes women, make sure you create an environment that takes
advantage of the best each person has to offer and pay special attention to cultural
norms that may come into play with cross-cultural teams that include both women
and men.
Developing High Performance Teams
In this chapter, we’ve discussed work styles as well as cultural, generational, and
gender differences.There are many other kinds of differences we experience
including race, religion, political orientation, and more.The reality is that everyone is
unique and brings a unique world and self-view to the team. Since work is about
accomplishing results (and hopefully enjoying it along the way), your goal as the IT
project manager is to ﬁnd ways to get the very best out of each team member with
the least effort on everyone’s part.The old adage “Work smarter, not harder” cer-
tainly applies. If you can ﬁnd ways to fully utilize individual team member’s skills,
talents, interests, work styles, and experience, you’ll be getting optimal team results
that should translate into optimal project results. In this section, we’ll look at some
www.syngress.com

generally recognized methods for creating highly functional teams. We won’t reit-
erate the information presented earlier on work styles, culture, language, and genera-
tion differences, but keep them in mind as you go because they form the foundation
for outstanding team performance. Many of these topics will be revisited later in this
book when we discuss forming your project team and deﬁning procedures and
guidelines for team performance.
Ensure the Team Composition Matches the Task
High performance teams have team members whose background, skills, experiences,
and work styles are varied. Having a homogeneous group leads to lopsided thinking
and often results in errors and omissions because everyone has the same perspective.
Whenever possible, include people on the team that are different—from different
stakeholder groups (customers, users, managers, hardware, software, testing, quality,
etc.), with different work styles, experiences, and talents. While you don’t want to
create diversity for diversity’s sake (except in some instances), diversity almost always
yields a better result, so strive to ﬁnd a good mix of people with the right skills for
the team.
Clearly Deﬁne the Project and Team Purpose
We’ll discuss deﬁning the project and the team’s purpose in more detail later in the
book, but an integral part of any high performance team is a clear understanding of
purpose. When the project and its purpose are clearly understood and when the
team clearly understands what is expected of it and what its deliverables are, the pro-
ject will be far more successful. In cross-cultural teams, this is even more important
to ensure that teammates working around the world can collaborate successfully
toward a common goal.
Clearly Deﬁne Team Member 
Roles, Leveraging Unique Skills and Talents
Each member of the team should also understand his or her unique role on the
team. Ideally, these roles should, ideally, leverage the individual’s skills and talents.As
we discussed earlier in this chapter, when a person can work inside his or her com-
fort zone, he or she is often far more effective.That said, a project is a great opportu-
nity for people to stretch and learn new skills, so team roles should offer the
opportunity to learn new skills and to work with new people, if at all possible.
www.syngress.com
150
Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

Clearly Deﬁne Team 
Member Responsibilities to the Team
We’ll also discuss this more later in the book, but it’s important that each team
member understand exactly what his or her responsibility is to the team. Often
teamwork is just a group of individuals coordinating or parsing out a chunk of work
rather than truly collaborating on a solution.Team members should be encouraged
to work as a team.They should also be very clear about their responsibilities to the
team, including speaking up if problems arise within the team.
Create Clear Guidelines for Deliverables
Highly effective teams understand clearly what is expected of them. Clearly deﬁned
deliverables help everyone know what is expected and when it’s expected. Quality
comes from clearly deﬁned work that is delivered according to clear guidelines, so
deﬁning what a quality deliverable looks like is an important building block for your
project. We’ll spend a fair amount of time later in the book discussing how to build
quality into your project through clearly deﬁned deliverables.
Work as a Team to Deﬁne 
a Team Culture and Identity
Many project managers approach a project team as a temporary collection of people
that have to get a job done. While that is, in fact, the mission of many teams, they
can be far more effective when people begin to identify as part of the team, to form
team bonds, and to create a team culture. Shared experiences help create bonds, so
developing opportunities for the team to get to know one another (in work and/or
non-work settings) can help forge relationships important to the success of the pro-
ject.You can be creative in creating a team identity—have the team come up with a
name, make team t-shirts, have lunch or coffee together as a team, etc., to develop a
high functioning team.
Work as a Team to Develop Problem 
Solving and Conﬂict Resolution Guidelines
Any team will have problems and conﬂicts arise at some point in time. Rather than
sitting down and laying out these guidelines, work with the team to develop them.
This not only gets needed buy-in, but it will take into account cultural, generational,
and work style differences. What might have seemed like a good conﬂict resolution
www.syngress.com
Managing the IT Project Team • Chapter 4
151

solution to you might be completely unacceptable to your multigenerational,
cross-cultural team.
Create an Environment that 
Fosters Respect and Courtesy
Respect and courtesy can be in short supply when we’re under immense pressure to
start, run, or complete a project.Added to all the other job responsibilities we might
have, we can forget our manners pretty quickly.As the project manager, your job is
to set the tone for the team. When you create an environment that fosters courtesy
and respect and quickly addresses any lapses, members of the team will be more
likely to want to contribute fully. Knowing that team activities will be respectful and
courteous also encourages team members to speak up and raise contrary information
and opinions that might be critical to the success of the project.
Recognize Individual and Group Achievement
As you read earlier in this chapter, recognition is one of the things that drives job
satisfaction.This is a fairly universal human need, so cultural and generational differ-
ences melt away for just a moment. However, how that recognition should be deliv-
ered will be highly inﬂuenced by cultural and generational factors.As you learned,
some cultures are very group-oriented and for you to single any one individual out
for positive (or negative) feedback could be bad both for the group and the indi-
vidual. Provide genuine recognition of achievements in whatever culturally accept-
able method(s) you determine.The important thing is to provide that recognition.
Manage Team Time Efﬁciently
How many team or project meetings have you attended that were a complete waste
of time? Too many to count, probably. Unfortunately, too many project managers
(and other managers) don’t manage team time effectively, causing team members to
duck out of meetings early or not show up at all. Set an agenda for the meeting and
make sure everyone knows the agenda. Make sure everyone is clear about their roles
in the meeting (are they expected to make a presentation, deliver an analysis, bring
ideas to solve a problem, etc.?). Make sure the meeting starts and ends on time and
stays on topic.Allow time for socializing before or after the meeting, not during. If
team or project meetings are clear, concise, and useful, people will actually attend
and participate. It might be a foreign concept in your company, but give it a shot—
you’ll be surprised how effective a meeting can actually be when it’s well facilitated.
We’ll talk later in the book about how to run effective project meetings in more
detail.

Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

Establish Communication Guidelines
Setting guidelines and expectations about communications is another important
facet of high performance teams.As project manager, you may have some guidelines
you’d like to establish (and that’s ﬁne).You should also work with the team to deter-
mine what’s feasible and reasonable. Some companies expect e-mail to be responded
to within a few hours, other companies seem to expect responses sometime in the
next week or two.Time zones, cultural, and generational differences also come into
play. For instance, some team members may be reluctant to log into e-mail on the
weekends to check on and reply to e-mail (unless they have a speciﬁc need to do
so). Other teammates may log in nights, weekends, and holidays just to keep their
ﬁngers “on the pulse.”An e-mail sent at 8:00 A.M. in the U.S. might arrive just after
normal working hours in another country and may not be replied to until the next
day. In addition to issues of timeliness, your team should set guidelines about how
they’ll communicate. How often will they meet, do they need to talk by phone, net
meeting, video conferencing, face-to-face meetings, etc.?
Implement Technology to Enhance 
Real-Time Communication and Collaboration
High performance teams have team leaders who work to reduce barriers to produc-
tivity and success. Looking for ways to implement and leverage technology to
enhance real-time communication and collaboration among team members can have
a huge impact on the success of the team. Utilizing existing tools more effectively
can be part of your strategy and the implementation of new tools might be needed
as well.Also, make sure everyone has access to the tools the team will use. If one part
of the team has access to video conferencing and another part of the team doesn’t, it
can cause problems with communications and keeping the team in sync. In today’s
wired world, we all expect to have e-mail, phones, and access to the Internet, but
these amenities are not universally available. If you have lone team members in
remote locations, don’t assume they’re as connected as other team members.Assess
which technologies the team can all utilize to communicate effectively.

Cheat Sheet…
IT Team Performance
With the rapid pace of IT change, it’s hard just to stay on top of technology,
much less stay on top of managing a diverse team. However, remember the
saying, “Projects don’t fail, people do.” The key to any successful project is the
project team. Certainly there are times when more money or more time makes a
big difference, but regardless of your budget or schedule, if you don’t have the
right people on the team performing at their optimal levels and fully utilizing
their skills and talents, your project will fall short of the mark. Learning to
manage others effectively, especially through inﬂuence (rather than direct
authority) is the most important thing you can do as an IT project manager. There
are numerous resources—books, websites, newsletters, training courses—avail-
able to help hone your skills as a manager. Investing in these skills will enhance
your career regardless of where you’re headed.

Summary
Managing a project team has become increasingly more complex as we work with
people of different work styles, different languages, different cultures, and different
generations. We are expected to work in real time with people from around the
world and generate cost-effective results to help our companies remain competitive
in the global market. IT project management is a complex task that requires a solid
depth and breadth of skills that include business, management, and technical skills.As
a project manager, you’ll garner far more success if you work to understand people a
bit better. No doubt you’ve got a handle on the latest technology; you’re in IT after
all. But understanding what makes people tick and how to get the best out of people
is often a skill that’s neglected in the IT world.As an IT project manager, you need
to ﬁnd ways to get people engaged in the team and committed to a successful pro-
ject—often without direct or formal authority over your team members.
Understanding work styles, cultural and language differences, generational and
gender differences, and what actually makes a team perform well will set you apart
from your peers and give you a huge head start on project success.

Today’s Management Environment
 With the vast amount of information we have to process every day,
managers are no longer accepted as “the experts.”
 Corporate culture has changed and people no longer have jobs for life;
individuals no longer assume they’ll always have only one job or career in
their lifetimes.
 Technology has changed the way we work.The lone employee in a rural
area must be as connected as employees at the corporate headquarters.
 A successful manager must help remove roadblocks to high performance
and help foster commitment and initiative.

What People Really Want
 There are numerous factors that impact job satisfaction or dissatisfaction.
 Factors that create job dissatisfaction if not attended to are often referred to
as “hygiene” or “housekeeping” issues.These include salary, company
policies, and the work environment. If these are lacking, employees may
become dissatisﬁed. If these are adequate, they will not create job
satisfaction.
 Factors that create an environment that fosters job satisfaction include
meaningful work, the opportunity for achievement and advancement, and
recognition for a job well done.
 As a project manager, you often lack the ability to address the
“housekeeping” issues, especially salary, but you can have an enormous
impact on the job satisfaction factors.
Work Styles and the Project Team
 There are numerous systems that deﬁne work and personality traits. Myers-
Briggs and DiSC are two of the more widely known systems.
 Everyone has a work style that comes naturally to them. When they can
work primarily within that style, they are more productive, generate higher
quality, and typically experience less stress.
 As a project manager, learning to recognize and leverage various work
styles will make your job easier. Relying on individuals’ strengths and
minimizing their weaknesses creates the strongest possible team.
 When putting together your project team, try to include various work
styles on the team and then utilize those strengths for the good of the
team.
 Create an environment that accepts and respects various work styles. Each
style has its strengths and potential pitfalls, so no one style is “good” or
“bad”.

Culture Matters
 If you’re managing people from other cultures or other countries, you’ll
need to learn about those other cultures in order to effectively manage
those people.
 Following some basic guidelines such as learning to pronounce difﬁcult,
foreign names and understanding the values and norms of another culture
will show respect, the most important factor in managing cross-cultural
teams.
 Make sure all members of the team understand terminology, jargon, and
expectations. English may be a second language for other team members
and culture, countries, and distance all can add to confusion.
 Communicate clearly and frequently. Make sure all members of the team
are involved and are participating.
 Feedback is a normal and required part of any team management process,
but providing negative feedback in a multicultural environment can be
tricky. Make sure you understand the culture and the most appropriate way
to provide feedback before proceeding so you don’t accidentally cause
embarrassment or worse.
 Multigenerational teams also can be challenging because older and younger
workers typically have different work styles.
 Learn to respect different work styles and leverage their best traits. Pair or
team up workers of differing styles so they can learn to respect and
understand each other’s strengths and can offset each other’s weaknesses.
 Don’t confuse cultural issues for performance issues, but don’t let cultural
issues prevent you from addressing performance issues. Learn to address the
work and the expectations in culturally appropriate ways, but do address
performance issues.
Men, Women and Technology
 Women are underrepresented in science and technology ﬁelds.
 If you manage a team that includes women, create an environment that
takes advantage of everyone’s skills and talents equally.
 Be aware of cross-cultural issues related to gender when managing an
international team.

Developing High Performance Teams
 High performance teams start with the right mix of people. Make sure you
have the right people for the project and rearrange jobs, titles, and tasks to
leverage everyone’s best talents.
 Clearly deﬁning the project, the project’s objectives, the team’s mission, and
the roles and responsibilities of each team member is critical to a high
performance team. People work more effectively when they clearly
understand the project’s objectives and their role within the team.
 Make sure your team meetings are well run. Use meeting agendas, keep
conversations on topic, and avoid wasting people’s time discussing or
rehashing prior deliverables or events (unless needed). Provide opportunities
for informal talk or socializing outside of the formal conﬁnes of the team
meeting.
 Utilize any and all appropriate technology to enhance team communication
and collaboration.This is especially critical when your project team is
geographically dispersed.
Q: There’s a guy on our project team who always says,“That won’t work.” We’re
getting a bit tired of his negative attitude.Any suggestions?
A: Some people always see the downside to everything. While this can be a drag
on the team’s momentum, it can also be useful to the team by helping the
team (and project) avoid pitfalls no one else has discovered. If you’re the pro-
ject manager, you need to manage this behavior so it’s productive and not
just a constant negative voice. One of the best ways to do this is to give this
guy time to think about whatever’s being proposed then set a team meeting
to discuss the pros and cons of the proposal.This gives him a legitimate
outlet for raising his concerns.Another technique that can be very helpful is

to allow him to say, in essence,“That won’t work,” then press him for ideas
on what would work. When someone poses problems without solutions, it’s
not helpful, so asking anyone who raises potential problems to also suggest
ideas for solutions will yield a more positive outcome. In fact, you can make
that part of your team process—whenever you raise a problem you must also
offer potential solutions. While there are times when people might raise a
legitimate problem and not be able to offer a potential solution, it will sepa-
rate out the perpetually negative people from those who are raising legiti-
mate concerns.
Q: My project team’s meetings are a complete waste of time. We just sit around
and rehash what we talked about before.Any suggestions?
A: It’s possible that your team’s project manager is just not good at running
meetings. He or she may have a work style that is less organized than others.
If you’re more organized, you may offer to be in charge of creating team
meeting agendas. By proposing both the problem and solution, you’ll give the
PM a break and you will use your strengths for the good of the team. For
instance, you could say,“I know others are comfortable with less structure,
but I think there are some on the team, myself included, that could use a bit
more structure in our team meetings. Would it be ok if I developed an
agenda for each meeting and submitted to you for approval before the
meeting? That would help me stay focused and organized during the meet-
ings.” If the PM isn’t good at organizing and running meetings, he or she will
probably be quite thankful for the assistance and because it’s positioned as a
team aid (rather than addressing the PM’s shortcomings), it is more likely to
be accepted. It’s also important to recognize that you, as a team member, play
an important role in the team, not only as a subject matter expert, but as a
member of a team that needs to get results. By taking steps to improve the
effectiveness of your team meetings, you’re demonstrating an important team
trait. If every member of the team takes responsibility for ensuring a highly
functional team, chances are good it will be one.

Q: I have someone on my team who’s from another country and I can’t pro-
nounce her name. I gave her a nickname to make it easier.Was that ok to do?
A: That depends. Some people understand that their names are difﬁcult for
others outside their country or culture to pronounce and are ﬁne with nick-
names. Others may be offended.You might ask this person if the nickname or
some other name is her preference. Remember, avoid a yes/no type of ques-
tion since she may be reluctant to say no, even if she does not like you using
a nickname for her.
Q: I have a guy on my team who’s in his late 50’s and he’s a real rules-and-regu-
lations guy. He seems to annoy a number of the younger team members.Any
advice?
A: Your approach to this situation is important because you indicated that you
only have one older worker on the team. If this is the case, he may feel like the
“odd man out.”This may actually cause him to become even more focused on
what he’s comfortable with, which in his case are the rules and regulations.
Recognizing his expertise and talents, making sure he’s included in non-work
team activities, or ﬁnding situations to speciﬁcally include him or rely upon his
talents may help diffuse the situation.Talking as a team about what the rules
and procedures are can also help clarify for everyone what’s expected.You may
also need to talk privately with him about his behavior if he is imposing his
views and work style on others.Again, respect his contribution and focus on
what you’d like him to do and how he can best contribute.
Q: My IT project team is comprised of several people who are much younger
than I am.They’re late to meetings, they miss meetings, and they can’t seem
to deliver results on time. It’s driving me nuts. What should I do?
A: Well, there are some interesting dynamics you just described. First, you lumped
all of these younger team members into one.Are all of them always late to
meetings and miss meetings and deadlines, or are you seeing them as one unit
even though they are three or four distinctly different individuals? It’s possible
your discomfort with their work style is causing you to miss some of their
individual differences, so that’s one place to begin looking. However, if this is a
generational kind of work style issue you’re noticing, there are several things
you can do. First, make sure your meetings are not a waste of time.Younger
team members, in particular, move quickly and have the ability to multitask,
www.syngress.com
160
Chapter 4 • Managing the IT Project Team

which means they can get bored more quickly. If the meetings they’re skipping
aren’t particularly relevant, you may want to make some changes to your meet-
ings. Make them focused by having speciﬁc agendas and sticking to them.
Make them effective by using everyone’s time in the most efﬁcient manner
possible. Finally, you may have a performance issue with one or more of these
folks. Don’t confuse poor performance with other issues. Setting clear perfor-
mance guidelines and making sure everyone understands what’s expected and
when is important in all business settings. If team members do not perform to
these expectations, you may have to address individual performance.
Q: I’ve been managing a project team that I “inherited” from a previous project
manager.The team is in disarray and is far from being a high functioning
team.There are sub-groups and in-ﬁghting, and territorial and political issues
running rampant. I don’t even know where to start. What do you suggest?
A: Well, you’ve certainly got your work cut out for you. One way to move
through this type of situation is to stop whatever you’re doing and completely
disassemble the team’s structure—not the project, just the team. Privately, you
may want to evaluate all the team members to see if you have the right mix of
people. It’s possible you don’t and that’s causing some of the problems. Make
sure everyone on the team is contributing something needed and if not,
remove him or her from the team (yes, politics do come into play and you may
not be able to remove some members of the team without major problems.
You’ll have to use your best judgment in these cases). Essentially, try to wipe
the slate clean. Get rid of job descriptions and titles, and get rid of current
groupings. Get the team together and tell them you want to start from scratch.
Have everyone look at the project and the project team and start by redeﬁning
your project and the team’s mission or objectives (that’s speciﬁcally addressed
later in this book). It’s also possible that the project deﬁnition was poor or mis-
guided in the ﬁrst place or that it has changed over time.When the team has a
clear understanding of the project, its objectives, and the team’s responsibility,
you can begin to create a shared vision of the project. Next, work with the
team to clearly deﬁne roles and responsibilities based on work styles, subject
matter expertise, and skills (and other relevant factors). Realigning the team
based on roles and responsibilities can also help break up these sub-group
issues. Finally, you may need to get the leaders of these sub-groups aligned with
the project’s new deﬁnition and mission or remove them from the team. It’s
possible to turn around your rag-tag team, but it will take some work.

Introduction
In the ﬁrst four chapters of this book, we deﬁned and discussed the environment
that surrounds and inﬂuences IT projects. If you skipped over those chapters, make
sure you go back and read them at some point.They help put things in perspective
and give you some great tools for more effectively navigating in your corporate cul-
ture. In this chapter, we’re going to start digging into IT project management itself.
We’re going to look at each phase of project management beginning with the deﬁ-
nition phase.This is an element of IT project management that is often skipped or
short-changed, but it is in the deﬁnition phase that you begin to build success into
your project. Some project management methodologies begin with project initiation.
We’ll keep it simple and include initiation and deﬁnition together in this chapter.
We’ll begin by discussing project origins and we’ll brieﬂy discuss types of projects.
We’ll discuss the important elements in deﬁning a project so that you build the
foundation for success.Think of it this way—if you don’t deﬁne the problem, you
are likely to solve the wrong problem.A great solution to the wrong problem is like
a bicycle with an airbag—it might be interesting, but it’s not very useful.
Project Management Process Overview
Throughout the remaining chapters, we’ll use a diagram (Figure 5.1) showing the
project management process to help you visualize where you are.You’ll be reminded
of where you’ve been and what your next steps are by referring to this diagram,
which you’ll also ﬁnd at the beginning of subsequent chapters.You can refer to this
as you plan your project and you can download the template showing all the steps
and the details of each step from www.syngress.com/solutions. It’s important to
understand that IT project management is an iterative process meaning you’ll have
to do some of the steps more than once, reﬁning your project as you go.You usually
can’t just do each step once and leave it at that. While it might be nice if you could
engrave your project plan in granite, it’s far more likely that you’ll have to re-work
and revisit various project elements throughout the project planning and project
management process. Expect that you’ll have to do that. Don’t become defensive or
irritated when something needs to change.Accept that change is part of what you’re
managing and the better you manage change, the better you’ll be able to manage
your project.This is especially important in the early stages of project planning,
including the stage we’re going to discuss in this chapter, deﬁning the project. If you
bring your thoughts and ideas back to the project sponsor and he or she does not
validate your ﬁndings, that’s a good thing. It means that you have successfully rooted
out assumptions or misunderstandings that later might have completely blown the

project out of the water. Knowing that now rather than 10 months and $10 million
later is a good thing, don’t you think?
Figure 5.1 IT Project Management Process Overview
We’re starting with Deﬁning the Project. Within this section of the overall IT pro-
ject management methodology, there are deﬁned inputs, actions, and outputs. In plain
English, that means that there is a speciﬁc starting point (input), speciﬁc steps we’ll
take (actions), and speciﬁc results of our actions. For each of the steps show in Figure
5.1, there are inputs, actions, and outputs that we’ll discuss. If this language is new to
you, don’t be put off. It will quickly become familiar and using these concepts
(input, action, and output) will help you keep track of each step in the project more
easily. Figure 5.2 shows the inputs, actions, and outputs for the project deﬁnition step
of IT project management. Let’s quickly deﬁne a few terms before we continue.
■
Duration The length of time allotted for a particular task to be 
completed.

■
First use penalty The additional length of time (or cost) that stems from
the ﬁrst time something is done (cost of the learning curve).
■
Parametric estimating Using parameters from previous projects to
develop estimates for the current project.
■
Project  A unique solution to a problem.
■
Project lifecycle Each project has seven phases: deﬁne, organize, form the
team, plan, manage, track, and close the project.Together, these form the
project lifecycle.
■
Project proposal A project overview document given to you to begin
project implementation. Ideally, a project proposal contains certain ele-
ments, discussed later in this chapter.A project proposal is not always
required, though if one exists, it should be validated.
■
Proposed solution  A solution to a problem that is suggested as a project
or approach to the project.
■
Problem to be solved  A problem to be solved by creating a project plan.
■
Project sponsor  Typically the person who assigned the project to you
and appointed you project manager.The project sponsor is the person to
whom you must go to get formal and informal approval for project param-
eters such as the project proposal, the cost, time, and other details of the
project.
■
Validated project proposal  An initial project plan that deﬁnes several
basic elements of a project plan.

Figure 5.2 Inputs, Actions, and Outputs for Project Deﬁnition Step
Within the project deﬁnition step or phase, there are 6 steps. Let’s discuss each
one brieﬂy so the diagram will become clear if it’s not already.
1.
INPUT The input in this case is one of three things. Either you have been
given a project proposal, you have been handed a proposed solution (a less
deﬁned project proposal), or you have identiﬁed a problem to be solved.
We’ll discuss where projects come from more in a subsequent section of
this chapter.
2.
ACTION Using one of these three inputs, you’ll then go into the project
validation or project deﬁnition process.This process is a deﬁned set of steps
you’ll use that will result in a validated project proposal. If you were handed
a project proposal, following the steps in this process will result in a pro-
posal that has been validated by research and investigation. If you were
handed a proposed solution or an identiﬁed problem, following the steps in
the project validation/project deﬁnition process will result in the creation
of a formal (or not-so-formal) project proposal.
3.
OUTPUT The output from this phase or step is a validated project pro-
posal. Notice that regardless of which of the three inputs we have, we use
the same steps to validate or create the project proposal and the result is a
validated project proposal. Whether this is generated from reviewing an
existing proposal or from creating a new proposal from scratch, the result is
the same.

4.
CHECKPOINT  In many of the steps in IT project management, there
are one or more checkpoints.These are points at which you need to stop
and make sure everything is on track. Within a project schedule, these are
typically referred to as milestones. Outside of the project schedule, you can
call them milestones, checkpoints, or input points, just as long as you have
them and use them. For this step, the validated project proposal is brought
to the project sponsor for approval. We’ll discuss how to do this later in this
chapter.
5. DECISION POINT  Based on the response of your project sponsor,
you’ll either need to go back and rework parts of your project proposal or
continue on to the next step, organizing your project. If the sponsor gives
the proposal the go ahead, you continue. If not, you will have to address the
project sponsor’s speciﬁc concerns and revise the validated project proposal
and submit it for approval again.This may be an iterative process where
you’ll need to make several revisions before the project sponsor agrees to
the proposal. It’s also possible that based on the information gathered thus
far, the project sponsor (or project manager) recommends terminating the
project.This occurs when it becomes clear that factors have changed such
as the project would be too late or too costly, etc. We’ll discuss this in more
detail later in this chapter.
6.
NEXT STEP  Once you have approval from the project sponsor for the
validated project proposal, you can continue in the project planning process
and begin organizing your project.These steps are discussed in Chapter 6.
Project Origins
In organizations, there are essentially two different types of projects arising from dif-
ferent needs.The bottom-up project is typically needs-driven. Someone in the organi-
zation sees a problem or need and a project is born to solve the problem.The second
type is the top-down project and that is typically solution-oriented. Someone at the
top of the organization wants something to exist and creates a project to make it
happen. Sometimes a project has already been proposed and deﬁned (it may have
already been planned) and is then placed on hold or modiﬁed in some way before
it’s handed to you. We call these project proposals to differentiate them from a solution
that’s been handed to you or a problem that’s been identiﬁed. While this may seem
like splitting hairs, it’s important to differentiate because these are your project inputs
(see Figure 5.2, Step 1) and each requires a slightly different approach.
www.syngress.com
168
Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects

Some projects are driven by internal needs, while some result from external
needs (client, customer, or perhaps vendor).These external projects are often projects
for which clients are paying, so while the overall process is the same, there may be
different checkpoints, approval points, and signatures required. We’ll point out the
places where these differences exist as we go.
Notice in Figure 5.2 that regardless of your inputs (where the project comes
from), the steps are the same. If you’re starting with a project proposal, which assumes
much of the project information has been developed, you’ll be validating instead of
creating data. If your input is a solution or a problem, you’ll be creating the project
data related to the deﬁnition step to validate the problem, solution, and approach.
As we discussed in Chapter 3, corporate politics have a lot to do with project
success and how you manage the political environment is key.When a project is
needs-driven, it’s often (though not always) easier to get the project approved, espe-
cially when everyone feels the pain.An example of that would be the need to
upgrade the desktop operating system to a newer version because everyone (including
the CEO or company owner) experiences the “blue screen of death” or other symp-
toms of system instability.The downside is that if the project is needs-driven and it’s
not a need that is clearly deﬁned or directly felt by top executives, it may be hard to
gain project approval.An example of this type of project is rewriting part of an
internal application to provide more seamless integration with a ﬁnancial package so
less manual work occurs (and therefore fewer errors).This type of project is invisible
to almost everyone in the organization and can be difﬁcult to sell unless you make a
strong business case (see Chapter 2 on aligning IT with business strategies).
The second type of project is the assigned project, or proposed solution.These
typically come about because an executive wants to see some sort of result.This
might be in response to a unique opportunity in the market that an executive wants
to capitalize on or it could be a pet project of someone at the top.While this type of
project may still be responding to a need, it is often assigned based on a desired out-
come or proposed solution.The good news for these types of projects is that they
typically have strong executive support (though there may be politics at a higher level
in the organization that could cause problems later on) and that executive will use
political and organizational inﬂuence to ensure the project is a success.The downside
to these projects is that they are rarely researched or validated and some (or all) of the
objectives may be unrealistic.We’ll talk more about this in just a moment.
The third project type is the project proposal.This type of project has already
been formalized to some degree. It might be a project that was planned six or twelve
months ago and put on hold or it could be a project that was deﬁned and planned
and handed to you. Regardless of how much work has been done on the project,
you should spend time validating the project proposal. Probably the only exception
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning IT Projects • Chapter 5
169

would be if you were handed a full-blown project plan that had been developed by a
competent project team and you are assigned as the project manager. Even in that
case, it wouldn’t hurt to go back over the project plan and validate each step.After
all, you’re the project manager and you’re the one who will be held accountable for
results. It would be good to know, going in, that the project was feasible and posi-
tioned for success rather than an impossible project for which you’ll be the fall guy
(or gal).
Whether your project comes from the bottom up or the top down, your steps
are going to be almost the same.There are a few key differences and when we run
into them, we’ll discuss them so you know exactly how to proceed. We’re going to
look at all of these elements in detail in this chapter.
Validating the Project Proposal
When a project is assigned to you, it often comes with additional project informa-
tion.A project proposal may be complete or not, but a thorough project proposal
will contain all or most of these elements:
■
Business case
■
Financial analysis
■
Market factors or requirements
■
High level scope and requirements
■
Assumptions and exclusions
■
High level resources
■
High level schedule
■
Success criteria
■
Risks
■
Alternatives
■
Recommendations
Whether you’re given a project proposal that has some or all of these elements,
you’ll need to spend a bit of time validating the project proposal.The intent is not to
second-guess anyone but to validate the information in the project proposal for
which you’ll be held accountable. Sometimes project proposals are developed and
the project is placed on hold for month or sometimes years. Sometimes project pro-
posals are developed and the cost of the project components changes dramatically or
www.syngress.com
170
Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects

the required resources or expertise are no longer available or the technology itself
has changed. Validating a project proposal is critical because things change constantly.
If the project proposal is up to date and was developed by those with enough exper-
tise to develop a valid proposal, you’re probably in good shape, but we all know the
danger of making assumptions. Rather than assume things are ﬁne, spend time vali-
dating the project proposal. How? In two ways: ﬁrst, by following the project deﬁni-
tion steps discussed in this chapter you’ll be able to validate the project at a high
level—are we solving the right problem, have we selected the optimal solution, etc.
Second, you may need to do research or market analysis to validate or develop a
complete project proposal.
The primary difference between validating a project proposal and developing
one from scratch is that with the former, you’re not reinventing the wheel, just
making sure the wheel has all its spokes. Using the project deﬁnition process we’ll
discuss in this chapter will allow you to validate each part of the project proposal
and to come up with alternatives if things have changed. If the project proposal itself
is no longer feasible or desirable, going through the project deﬁnition steps should
result in solid data supporting the decision to scrap or redeﬁne the project proposal
you were given. Without validating the project proposal, you’re essentially signing a
blank check because you have no way of knowing in advance what you’re actually
signing up for or whether or not it has any chance of success.
One more note about project proposals before we continue: sometimes it is both
necessary and desirable to create a very abbreviated project proposal. In some cases,
no project proposal is needed or wanted at all.These may be cases where there is a
short window of opportunity or compelling evidence that a project should abso-
lutely move forward.An executive might say,“I don’t care about these (project pro-
posal elements), just get it done now!” In those cases, don’t spin your wheels
developing data that won’t be used or needed. However, rather than spending time
developing a project proposal, you should spend time deﬁning your project.The lack
of need for a formal project proposal does not mean you can or should skip the pro-
ject management steps listed in this chapter and subsequent chapters; just the oppo-
site.You’ll need the data you develop from these steps even more if there is no
project proposal prepared to support the rationale for the project.
Form a Small Preliminary Project Team
Regardless of the type of project you’re undertaking, it would be helpful at this
point to put together a small team of experts to help you deﬁne the project,
including reviewing the existing project proposal (if one exists). When working
through the early stages of project deﬁnition, it can be very helpful to have several
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning IT Projects • Chapter 5
171

people working with you.This avoids the pitfalls you might run into such as not
seeing your own (perhaps faulty) assumptions and not having access to more than
your own point of view.A small team can plow through these initial steps quickly
and efﬁciently and can help build a better foundation for the project. Keep in mind
that the folks you gather now may not end up working on the project when you’re
ready to begin. However, they should be a reliable team that you trust to help you
develop these initial concepts.After you’ve read through this chapter, you’ll have a
better idea of the kinds of people you might want to ask to assist you in these pre-
liminary tasks.
Review the Existing Project Proposal
The existing project proposal, if one exists, may be short or quite lengthy.The ﬁrst
step is to review any and all project documentation that exists. Make sure you have
all the information called out in the existing project proposal including attachments,
exhibits, contracts, memos of understanding, and anything else mentioned in or
needed by the project proposal document. If the proposal is missing any elements,
especially those discussed throughout the remainder of this book, make sure you
create them.Any missing element is a potential error waiting to happen, so make
sure you have all the data you need to deliver a successful project. If you recall, it’s
been estimated that 50% to 75% of the total cost of any project is due to errors,
rework, and omissions, so validating the project proposal at this point will save time
and money down the road.
Validate the Project Information
Now that you’ve got all the information you need, you can validate the project pro-
posal.There may be some instances where the project sponsor wants to get a project
going very quickly to take advantage of favorable market conditions or to address a
critical need. While you may have to do an abbreviated “power planning” process
(purposely choosing to shorten, condense, or skip steps in the interest of time), you
should be aware of the risks of doing so.The risks include errors, omissions and
incorrect data and/or assumptions that cause rework, delays, or quality problems later
on.You’ll have to decide how much planning is appropriate to the situation and
keep in mind there are often political factors that must be taken into consideration
as well. Not all projects are large and complex, nor do they all require a lot of plan-
ning and documentation. Later in this book, we’ll discuss the concept of precision,
which includes how much planning and effort should go into a project plan. If you
are working on a short, two week project that involves three people and $8,000, far
www.syngress.com
172
Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects

less planning is needed than for a massive project involving hundreds of hours and
thousands (or millions) of dollars.
One important note here is that some companies run in “emergency” mode all
the time.This would cause the average IT project manager to skip the project plan-
ning steps and jump right into the project managing steps.Again, there may be iso-
lated instances when this is ok (or required), but don’t get caught in the trap of
feeling there is no time to plan. Planning now will result in consistently better, more
predictable project results. If you’re assigned as the project manager to a project
already underway, it would be well worth your time to go back through the project,
using the steps we’ll detail in this and subsequent chapters, to validate your project.
You may discover new data that helps the project succeed or that simply keeps you
from being the captain of a sinking ship.
Enterprise 128 …
No Time For Planning?
Have you ever noticed that few people (or companies) think they have enough
time to plan, but they always ﬁnd time to correct mistakes, errors and omissions
once the project is underway?
Take time to plan the project using the steps described in this book.
Otherwise, you’ll be wasting time and money when you do go back and ﬁx the
problems that occurred due to lack of planning. It is a proven fact that the
amount of time you spend planning will pay for itself by reducing errors and
rework later in the project, when you’ll somehow have to ﬁnd time to make
needed corrections.
Deﬁning the Project
Whether your IT project is needs-driven, assigned, or handed to you as a project
plan, you should begin with deﬁning the project. Remember, if the project is
assigned as a project proposal or project plan, you’ll need to review the proposal to
validate the various project parameters included in the assignment. If there are any
critical changes, they’ll have to be submitted to the project sponsor for approval. If
the project is solution-oriented or needs-driven, you’ll need to create the project
proposal to develop the project parameters and submit them for approval. In any
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning IT Projects • Chapter 5
173

case, you’ll need to do your homework to make sure the project starts off on solid
footing.
Let’s begin with deﬁning the initial steps for deﬁning a project, regardless of its
origins.
■
Problem Statement
■
Project Mission Statement
■
Potential Solutions
■
Selected Solution/Approach
■
Project Proposal
This doesn’t have to be a long, drawn-out process. In many cases, you and a
small team can go through the steps to deﬁne these ﬁve project elements in an hour
or two. While the amount of time this takes varies with project size and complexity,
it should not be a painful and arduous process. If you can’t deﬁne the problem, mis-
sion, potential solutions, and selected solution within a reasonable amount of time, it
should raise a ﬂag for you that something is wrong.
■
Problem Statement All projects should begin with a problem statement.
Whether the project is needs-driven or solution-oriented (assigned), the
project should begin with identifying the unique problem to be solved.
This helps validate the project assumptions and makes sure you’re solving
the right problem in the right way. If you work in an organization that
assigns projects and doesn’t expect (or accept) someone questioning the
project, you should still do this step so you know where you stand and
because it’s good to get into the habit of managing each project using the
same deﬁned steps. In some cases, this step can take 5, 10, or 15 minutes—it
need not be a long, involved process to deﬁne the problem.
■
Project Mission Statement If you’ve ever worked in a company that
sent people away for week-long retreats to develop the corporate mission
statement, you might be cringing right about now. Some people love those
types of activities, but others (including many in IT) ﬁnd them tedious and
unproductive. Let’s erase those images from your mind now. When we talk
about the project mission statement, we’re basically saying,“Let’s deﬁne
what we’re trying to accomplish.” When you deﬁne the problem and the
mission (which can also be called the desired outcome), you will have basi-
cally deﬁned a gap between what exists and what is desired. From there,
you can develop potential solutions.The mission statement should be a
www.syngress.com
174
Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects

simple statement that includes the desired outcome. If you can attach met-
rics to your mission, that’s even better. For instance, you might say that you
want to reduce user downtime (or increase user uptime) by x % or by x
number of hours per month.You may not be able to come up with that
level of detail at this time, which is ﬁne, but if you have that detail, add it to
your mission statement.
■
Potential Solutions If you’ve been assigned a project, you already have
the identiﬁed solution in your hands. However, that does not mean you
should skip these steps. In fact, it’s important you do these steps because
you’ll either validate the proposed project or you’ll ﬁnd that it’s a disaster
waiting to happen (or something in between).
In this project deﬁnition step, which we’ll discuss in more detail later,
you begin by brainstorming all potential solutions that address the deﬁned
problem and the desired outcome.You can be creative in this phase, even if
your project is assigned. It’s in this phase that brilliant ideas sometimes pop
out, so skipping this is a lost opportunity. Once you’ve listed all potential
solutions, you’ll go through them and identify the best solution that ﬁts
both the problem and desired outcome(s).
■
Selected Solution We’ll discuss this in much greater detail later because
there are several methods you can use to identify the best solution to both
the deﬁned problem and the desired outcomes (project mission statement).
However, once you’ve developed your list of potential solutions, you have a
whole host of options open to you.This is one way you optimize organiza-
tional performance—by testing and validating projects before they move
forward. Since many projects are scrapped by companies for a variety of
reasons, we can assume that some (or many) of these scrapped projects
should not have been undertaken in the ﬁrst place. While it’s often difﬁcult
to be the bearer of bad news (“This project is not solving the problem” or
“This project is not feasible based on current data”, etc.., if you can offer
up an alternative solution, you’ll be seen as someone adding value to the
organization by trying to solve the right problem in the best way possible.
■
Project Proposal If you were handed a project proposal, you can use the
list earlier in the chapter to see if all the requisite elements are there. If not,
you may want to ﬁll in the gaps. Some companies want all the elements
included in a project proposal, while other companies may want to skip
over certain elements.You’ll have to adapt to your organization’s basic 
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning IT Projects • Chapter 5
175

formula, but also keep in mind that each element is included for a speciﬁc
reason and to skip over any element is to have a less-than-complete project
proposal document, which leaves things open for interpretation, discussion
and, unfortunately, ﬁnger-pointing.The project proposal is not a required
element, especially because some companies don’t yet understand the value
of things like making the business case for an IT project. However, in most
cases, you’d do well to at least create a small project proposal.This is dis-
cussed in more detail later in the chapter.
Deﬁning the Problem
We brieﬂy mentioned the importance of deﬁning the project problem. In this sec-
tion, we’ll look at the needs-driven project and the solution-oriented (assigned) pro-
ject and why you should take time to deﬁne the problem. If your project came to
you in the form of a project proposal or a full-blown project plan, you can review
the solution-oriented or assigned project section.Then, we’ll look at how to actually
deﬁne the problem so you get your project off on the right foot.
Deﬁning the Needs-Driven Project
Needs-driven projects are sometimes the easiest to work with only because they
typically start with someone identifying a problem to be solved.The reason this is a
bit easier to work with is because a good project deﬁnition begins with deﬁning the
problem to be solved.A project, by deﬁnition, is a unique solution to a problem. So,
the ideal starting point is the problem statement. In a needs-driven project, this is
often the process of clarifying the problem that’s been identiﬁed. Using the example
cited earlier, a needs-driven project might be upgrading all desktop systems to a
newer, more stable operating system version.The original problem might have been
raised this way,“Do you know the help desk staff has spent over 70 hours this month
ﬁxing system problems?” or an executive may have said “I’m really tired of my
desktop hanging when I’m in the middle of working on a big project. I’d like you to
ﬁnd a better solution than constantly rebooting my system.” In either case, a problem
was identiﬁed—the desktop systems are unstable. Notice, however, that these prob-
lems are not necessarily stated in clear, deﬁned ways. Someone on the IT team may
come to you and mention that an executive was upset with system performance and
wants a more permanent solution, or you may discover through routine report anal-
ysis that an excessive number of help desk hours are spent on a particular type of
problem (in this case, system instability issues).You might decide that the problem is
large enough to warrant upgrading the systems, so you decide to look into a project
to accomplish this.

Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects

Deﬁning the Solution-Oriented Project
Solution-oriented projects (including those that are handed to you as project pro-
posals or project plans) are often assigned projects. Someone notices a problem and
decides the best course of action and assigns a project to someone.These come
about in two distinctly different ways. If you’re the IT manager and you assign a pro-
ject to someone on your team, you may very well assign the scope, time, cost, and
quality metrics for the project. Based on your skills, experience and understanding of
the assignment, there’s a very good chance you can assign these four variables with a
fair amount of accuracy. Still, the project manager for the assigned project should
work through every step, including deﬁning the project, to validate the project.
A second and very common scenario is when someone outside the IT depart-
ment, typically an executive, assigns a project to the IT department or assigns a pro-
ject to someone that includes a major IT component. In this case, it’s entirely
possible (or even likely) that the four assigned metrics are not based on experience
or history, but are instead based on a business need. If this is the case, there is a
strong chance that the four variables assigned will not be realistic or achievable. Now
you’re faced with a dilemma.You can move forward with the project knowing that
at least one of the four metrics (scope, time, cost, quality) will not be achieved (unless
you are incredibly lucky) or you can step back and deﬁne the project from the
ground up.After deﬁning the project problem as well as other steps, you may have to
go back to the person who assigned the project and let him or her know what is
realistic or achievable. While this might sound like bucking the chain of command,
most reasonable executives want to know if there’s a problem before it costs time and
money. If you work in the type of organization where this type of dialog with those
higher up in the organization is unacceptable, then you may have to simply have to
continue along with all the project deﬁnition and planning steps, even if you are
unable to change any of the project parameters. By going through every step, you’ll
at least know what you’re up against and how close or far the assigned project is
from reality.These steps should be followed regardless of whether or not you can
change the parameters, and these steps may give you leverage to get the project
modiﬁed or at least to record data for future use. However, in most organizations,
you have the opportunity to clarify and provide additional information that may
change the project parameters so that you and the project can be successful.
It is at this point in the project planning stage that you have your best shot at
beginning to educate your higher-ups in the chain of command.While they may not
want to hear the details of the project, you should make every reasonable attempt to
help these executives understand the project planning process and why it’s important
that they listen to your feedback.Again, not all companies are going to allow this, but
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning IT Projects • Chapter 5
177

it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t give it a shot. Help the executive understand the process
and most importantly, show what’s in it for the company and the executive. Make the
business case:“We can reduce the errors and rework in this project by following this
deﬁned process.The ﬁrst step is validating the project proposal and these are the vari-
ances we’ve found.”While you may not always be successful in these attempts, it is true
that you “pay now or pay later.” If a project must be completed in four months, it may
well be completed in four months. It is also highly likely that the project will lack key
functionality (scope) or may have errors (quality). It might also cost four times as much
because it had to be done so quickly (cost).We’ll talk more about the relationship of
these elements in more detail later, but keep in mind that every chance you have to
get your project sponsor and/or the executive team on board with the project man-
agement process should be fully utilized.
Deﬁning the Problem Statement
Whether the project is needs-driven or assigned, you should begin with deﬁning the
problem to be solved by the project. When the project is needs-driven, it’s often
easier to see the problem to be solved and to develop a problem statement. With
assigned projects, it might be more difﬁcult to discern the problem and if possible,
you might want be able to talk with the person who assigned the project and ask
what problem he or she is trying to solve.The reason for doing this is simple.A pro-
ject is a unique solution to a deﬁned problem. If you deﬁne the wrong problem,
you’ll develop a solution that solves the wrong problem and might ultimately cause
more problems than it solves. Starting at the very beginning is an important step for
all projects so you can be clear about where you’re headed.
Let’s look at the example of system instability we used earlier.The problem was
stated in two different ways. Someone saw that 70 hours of help desk time was spent
during one month on dealing with system instability issues such as blue screen of
death and other related issues.A second problem statement is the executive asking
for a better solution to the computer problems since rebooting is inefﬁcient and
frustrating. Both describe the problem and can be used as the basis for deﬁning the
problem, though neither is an adequate problem statement.
The problem statement should be a clear, concise statement of the problem to be
solved. Using this example, we can say the problem is “system instability is causing
excessive help desk effort and user downtime. User downtime causes organizational
inefﬁciency and user frustration.”You might word it differently, but this is the
essence of the problem.Another way to look at deﬁning the problem is to ask the
question,“Why should we care about this problem?”You might answer that question
by stating that user downtime is inefﬁcient and costs your company both in terms of

inefﬁcient use of help desk hours (that could be better spent doing something more
productive) and loss of time and increased frustration for users. Deﬁning the problem
doesn’t describe the solution. Notice that nowhere in our problem statements have we
said that the solution should be to upgrade the desktop systems. So far, all we’ve
done is say,“here’s the problem” or “here’s the reason we care about this problem.”
The result of this step is a project problem statement, shown in Figure 5.3.As you
can probably tell, this step doesn’t need to take hours. It might be a ten-minute exer-
cise in some cases.Throughout the remainder of this book, you’ll see these images.
The shape on the left indicates a document. Within the shape is the name or title of
the document.To the right of the shape are words describing the contents or nature
of the document. So, the document that results from the preceding process is a
problem statement. We’ll continue to identify the type of document and the docu-
ment contents at each step. Look for these icons throughout this and subsequent
chapters to help identify tangible deliverables or outcomes from discrete steps. While
each of these discrete deliverables should be captured in a document, they can all be
captured in the same document, the project plan.

the problem itself or why the company (or you or your department)
should care about the problem. This will help you not only make sure
you’re solving the right problem with your project, but will give you a
solid foundation for validating the project and project parameters later.
Remember, whether your project is needs-driven or solution-oriented,
you should begin with the problem deﬁnition.

It’s possible you are thinking that since most of your projects are assigned and
you’re not expected to question the project assignment that you can skip this step.
Don’t. Even if you are powerless to modify the project parameters, you need to
know how close (or far) this project is to reality. If you don’t start with the project
problem statement or deﬁnition, you’ll never know if you’re solving the right
problem or not. Remember to take every opportunity to manage up the chain of
command by educating higher-ups about the process and why it makes good busi-
ness sense to do it in the manner described.You might not always win, but you’ll
never have someone say,“Why didn’t you say something earlier?”
The IT Factor…
A Well-Deﬁned Problem
Starting with a well-deﬁned problem can make all the difference in the world. For
many people just learning project management, it can be so effective that con-
vincing others to use project management processes becomes an easy sell. For
Lisa Mainz, Operations Manager for ShopNatural.com, a well-deﬁned problem
statement made all the difference when she ﬁrst introduced these processes to
her team. She asked her team to work with her to deﬁne the problem they were
trying to solve. She reported, “Not only was deﬁning the problem statement
easier than anyone thought it would be, it gave us all such a clear understanding
of the problem that ﬁnding the optimal solution was actually easy.” For anyone
just learning IT project management or for anyone who’s a bit overwhelmed by
having to implement many new steps or processes, Mainz recommends begin-
ning with a well-deﬁned problem statement. “Even if you don’t ever implement
another PM step, you’ll ﬁnd your projects are more successful just by imple-
menting this one fundamental step,” Mainz suggested. “Though implementing
all the steps in this deﬁned IT project management process will ultimately yield
the best results, you can always start small and add one step at a time.
Incremental improvement is better than none at all.”
Deﬁning the Project Mission Statement
After you’ve clearly deﬁned the problem to be solved, you can then create the project
mission statement.The project mission statement is really the desired outcome of the
project. Remember, you’re still not deﬁning how you’ll accomplish this project—that
www.syngress.com
180
Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects

comes in just a bit. For now, we’re essentially performing a gap analysis.“Essentially,
here’s the problem and here’s the desired outcome.”
The project mission statement should be a short, concise statement about the
outcomes to be achieved, not how those outcomes will be achieved. While this may
sound a bit like verbal nitpicking, it’s not. It’s important that you deﬁne each ele-
ment independently so that you don’t make any very basic errors in your assump-
tions.A mistake in this deﬁnition process will be ampliﬁed so that later in the
project, an error here will be very costly to reverse or repair.This is also used to state
the exit criteria or how you will know when the project is successfully completed.
Later, you’ll deﬁne success criteria for the project, but a very concise statement here
will also help avoid scope creep later on.
Using the example mentioned earlier, we’ll use the problem statement regarding
system instability and we’ll develop a mission statement for it.The problem was
stated in this way:“System instability is causing excessive help desk effort and user
downtime. User downtime causes organizational inefﬁciency and user frustration.”
What would be the desired outcome then? We might state our project mission (or
desired outcome) as,“To reduce user downtime and help desk staff hours related to
desktop operating system faults and failures.” Notice that we have not deﬁned how
we’ll do this; we have not deﬁned the solution. We have only deﬁned the problem
and the desired outcome.At this stage, you may not be able to deﬁne speciﬁc, mea-
surable outcomes and that’s ok. However, if you can, you’ll be ahead of the curve
later in your project planning. For instance, if you can state that you want to reduce
down time by 85% from current levels, you have a much more speciﬁc statement
about what you’re trying to accomplish. If you can’t yet deﬁne it this speciﬁcally,
that’s ﬁne—later activities will help you more clearly deﬁne speciﬁc measurable goals
for your project.
A clearly deﬁned mission statement is another very critical step in the project
deﬁnition phase of project planning. It is possible that once you deﬁne the problem
and the mission that you ﬁnd your assigned project (whether it comes in the form
of a suggested solution or a project proposal) is just ﬂat out wrong. If you ﬁnd that
through deﬁning the problem and mission that you come up with a different view
of the project altogether, there’s a disconnect somewhere that should be addressed.
It’s always easier to ﬁx these gaps earlier than later, even if it means braving the
potential irritation of higher-ups who may just want the project to get under way.
Notice that this process doesn’t have to take forever. In many cases, once you’ve
deﬁned the problem clearly, the project mission statement almost writes itself
because it’s just the other side of the coin, so to speak. In some cases, you and your
small, expert team can identify the problem and mission statement in just a few

Deﬁning IT Projects • Chapter 5

productive minutes together. Figure 5.4 shows the project mission statement as a
deﬁned result of this step.
Some people like to think of the project mission statement as the statement of
work or the project charter.They’re not exactly equivalent because the project mis-
sion statement simply deﬁnes the desired outcome(s).A statement of work or project
charter certainly should contain (or summarize) the problem statement and the mis-
sion statement, but they are not interchangeable. We’ll discuss statement of work and
project charters in the next chapter.
Figure 5.4 Project Problem Statement
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Begin all projects by deﬁning the mission statement or desired out-
come(s). After you’ve deﬁned the problem you’re trying to solve, you
should develop your mission statement, which identiﬁes the desired out-
come(s) for the project. This essentially is a gap analysis—where are we
and where do we want to be? By deﬁning the beginning and end
points, you can then discuss all the potential ways to solve the problem
and hopefully come up with the best solution for the situation. If you
don’t describe the end result, you won’t ever know if your project hit
the mark or not.
Identify Potential Solutions
If you haven’t yet put together a small team to work with you on deﬁning the pro-
ject, you might want to do so now.They can validate the problem and mission state-
ments (if you created them on your own or with your project sponsor) and they can

help you identify all potential solutions. Schedule this meeting for an hour, bring
food (always a good way to invite lively participation) and encourage folks to get
creative. If you have fun with this and allow all potential solutions to be listed, you
may ﬁnd that someone has a brilliant idea that at ﬁrst glance seemed outlandish or
just plain crazy. It happens.
You’ll want to begin by reviewing the project problem statement and mission
statement.Then, ask the team to take ten minutes to write ideas down on a piece of
paper.This allows everyone to think freely without outside inﬂuence or judgment.
Once everyone has brainstormed on paper, have people share their ideas with the
team. Write them all down and don’t eliminate any just yet—even if they seem
completely off-the-wall or unrealistic. If people think of other ideas while you’re
writing, encourage them to make a note of them and add them to the list since
sometimes one person’s idea sparks another new, unique idea for someone else.
Once you have a list of all potential solutions, make sure the list is complete. If
you have a list of very sane, doable solutions, you haven’t thought hard enough or
big enough.You should have some crazy, over-the-top solutions on your list if
everyone is being creative and participating fully. It doesn’t matter that at ﬁrst glance
you might dismiss a handful of ideas for one reason or another. Sometimes it takes a
crazy idea to spark a related thought. If you’ve heard the theory that there are only
six people between any two people on this planet, such as you and the Dalai Lama
(the six degrees of separation theory), it might also be true that there are only six crazy
ideas between a bland one and a blockbuster. It’s worth a shot, isn’t it?
The Do Nothing Option
Add “do nothing” to your list of potential solutions. One trap many companies get
caught in is knee-jerk responses to problems or crises either internally or in the mar-
ketplace. Sometimes you may ﬁnd that doing nothing is actually the best solution.
Rather than racing around creating a project, sometimes simply allowing a situation to
resolve itself is the best option.This option should be considered, but it should be a
conscious choice, not the result of vacillation or over-thinking a problem (that is, don’t
confuse “analysis paralysis” with an active “do nothing” choice).
Project Versus Process
Another trap that IT project managers and companies can fall into is that they
deﬁne a whole new project when a process is what’s needed.A project, by deﬁnition,
is a unique solution to a problem.A process, on the other hand, is a deﬁned set of
repeatable steps taken to address an ongoing circumstance or problem. For instance,
payroll is a process in most companies.You wouldn’t create a new project every two
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning IT Projects • Chapter 5
183

weeks so people could get paid. Instead, you create a process to address how and
when people get paid, how checks are delivered, and how problems with payroll are
addressed.These are all processes because even though they may address problems,
they are ongoing and are not unique (even if a unique problem pops up within the
payroll process, it usually requires an adjustment to the process, not a project).You
should make sure that the problem you’re trying to solve requires a project and not a
process.
Not to confuse matters, but sometimes a project is needed to develop a new
process, and sometimes new processes are derived from projects.The key to keep in
mind is that a process is used for ongoing activities and a project is a solution to a
unique or one-time problem. While the lines can get blurry at times, make sure you
stop and ask,“Would a process solve this problem better than a project?” If so, talk to
the project sponsor and make your case for developing a new process rather than
deﬁning and implementing a new project.

List of Potential Solutions

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Identify all potential solutions. After you’ve clearly deﬁned where you are
(problem) and where you want to be (mission), you can brainstorm all
potential solutions (see Figure 5.5) that ﬁt both the problem and mission
statements. Being creative and even over-the-top in this step can some-
times yield surprising, innovative solutions that might otherwise be over-
looked. Don’t cross anything off the list at this point, but do make sure
that all listed solutions address both the problem and mission state-
ments. If not, they’re off the mark and should be added to the list only if
the team thinks the potential solution is a blockbuster. Ideas that are off
the mark can also be recorded for future use or to develop other projects.
Don’t let a great idea slip away, but don’t be distracted by great ideas
that are not appropriate for your project’s problem and mission.
Selecting the Optimal Solution
You and your small, expert team have developed the problem statement, the project
mission statement and a list of potential solutions, even if you were handed the solu-
tion initially. Now, you will go through a process of looking at all potential solutions
and rank them based on certain criteria (which we’ll discuss in a moment). Even if
you have been handed the solution you should still go through this exercise. If the
solution bubbles up to the top, you’ve validated the solution. If the solution falls low
in the list, you have invalidated the solution and perhaps found an even better solu-
tion to the stated problem. Of course, this can be tricky politically, but we’ll deal
with that later. For now, let’s focus on ﬁnding the optimal solution.
Developing Ranking Criteria
You’ve got a long or short list of potential solutions that you and the team have
developed.The next step is to develop the criteria against which you’ll rate or rank
these potential solutions. For instance, the project sponsor may have told you the
project must be completed in less than six months or for less than $50,000.The pro-
ject sponsor or the project proposal may have stated that certain requirements must
be met such as the use of a particular technology, programming language or security
algorithm. In some cases, these requirements are just that—requirements that must
be included in or addressed by the solution. In other cases, however, requirements
are mentioned but they’re really closer to suggested solutions. If you can discern the
difference (or you know the difference based on how your organization works), so
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning IT Projects • Chapter 5
185

much the better. Don’t work to meet requirements that are really suggested solutions
if you and your team believe a better solution exists.
There is no standard set of criteria that we can give you to say,“Use this list to
rank your potential solutions,” because every situation is different. However, you can
begin by looking once again at corporate and IT strategies and determining which
of the potential solutions aligns best.You can also look at which potential solution(s)
have the best business case or which approach seems most appropriate.You can also
look at the market and determine if there are particular market requirements that
must be met or potential market opportunities that can be exploited via your pro-
posed solutions.These all help align the IT project to the business and market, which
will make them easier to support and defend down the road if the going gets tough.
These are all elements that can and should go into a project proposal if you’re devel-
oping one, so this data will be put to good use.
Next, you should develop your target scope, time, cost, and quality metrics or
deﬁnitions. Often these are assigned with a project. If they’re not, you may need to
discuss these elements with your project sponsor before you try to rank your poten-
tial solutions. For instance, if the project sponsor says that time is the most critical
element and the project must be completed in less than four weeks, then any poten-
tial solution that you can intelligently estimate taking more than four weeks would
be placed at the bottom of the priority list. Notice we placed them at the bottom of
the list rather than tossing them aside.Things change and your sponsor might come
back and say,“Well, maybe eight weeks at the most if you have a better idea.”You’ll
be ready with a few alternatives.
Target scope, time, cost, and quality can be difﬁcult to estimate, but often your
project sponsor has a good idea on these targets. It’s rare that a project is handed to
you with absolutely no preconceived notion of duration and cost, though it does
happen. If there are no set targets, then you can prioritize your potential solutions
based on the approach that seems most logical, feasible, desirable, and affordable (see
Chapter 2 for more on this). Logical, feasible, and desirable are all inexact labels
based on judgment calls made by your and your team. However, in the absence of
other, more exact criteria for your project, these may be good substitutes.Affordable
is also a judgment call but it’s usually a bit easier to determine for each potential
solution. It’s relatively easy to discern the difference in affordability between adver-
tising in a few trade publications versus advertising during the Super Bowl.
Ranking Your List
Once you have developed your ranking criteria, you should rank each potential
solution.You may ﬁnd that a weighted ranking system works better than a simple
www.syngress.com
186
Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects

ranking system. For instance, one or more criteria may be far more important than
several other criteria.You may choose to assign a value of 5 for each important cri-
teria and a value of 1 for other criteria. Each potential solution can then be ranked
according to several criteria and the solution(s) that have the highest overall score
should be those that meet the most critical criteria. Whatever ranking system you
use, make sure it’s clear, concise, and that everyone doing the ranking has the same
understanding of the system.
Selecting Your Solution
If you have been able to create a ranked list of all potential solutions, the best solu-
tion(s) should be at or near the top of the list. Of course, there’s nothing like a little
human intelligence to optimize results, so if your ranked list doesn’t seem to match
the reality of the situation, you and your team should take steps to ﬁgure out why
the ranking system didn’t identify the optimal solution. If you and the team believe
there is an optimal solution that is not at the top of the list, you can and should
examine both your assumptions and your ranking criteria to make sure you’re not
just trying to promote the politically correct solution. It’s possible that in some cases,
you will still have to go with the politically correct solution, but you should at least
know whether or not that solution is the best one.
Once you have identiﬁed Figure 5.6’s optimal solution (and, unfortunately, we’ll
include the politically correct or required solution in here as well), you should iden-
tify the target scope, time, cost, and quality for that solution.Your next step is going
to be to bring the problem, mission, and selected solution to your project sponsor
for approval, so make sure you’ve got all the supporting data you’ll need to back up
your decision, especially if it differs from what was assigned. If that’s the case, go
back and review Chapters 2 and 3 to make sure you’re ready to deal with the busi-
ness and political realities in your company.

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Select the optimal solution. Once you’ve listed all potential solutions that
address both the problem and mission statement, you can narrow down
your choices to the most optimal solutions. Ranking them in order based
on deﬁned criteria can help, especially if more than one solution appears
to be feasible. If you don’t know enough about the project constraints
at this point (budget, timeline, etc.), you can bring this ranked list to
your project sponsor for discussion and/or approval. Keep in mind that
too much information can slow the process to a halt, so you may want
to limit your ranked list to the top three solutions and capture the other
potential solutions in an appendix or separate document. This way your
project sponsor can choose from among the best three solutions based
on the research you and your team have done rather than rehash the
entire list of potential solutions.
Developing the Project Proposal

handed a proposal to validate or if you were developing one from scratch, you now
should have enough preliminary information to develop your project proposal. Let’s

Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects

In Chapter 2, we discussed the importance of aligning IT projects with corpo-
rate strategy and for making the business case for your projects. Here’s where it
comes into play. If after looking at the problem and desired outcome(s), if after
listing all potential solutions and developing either a ranked list or a selected solu-
tion, if after all of that you can’t make a business case for the project, you need to
rethink your direction. Granted, you may not be in a position to change or cancel
the project, but you will be in a position to discuss the potential problems with your
project sponsor.Throughout this book, we’ll continue to discuss ideal scenarios and
best practices, not because we’re unaware of the real world, but because we want to
create an opportunity for you to grow and learn and hopefully create these best
practices out there in the real world.
In some cases, you need to get the project up, running, and completed in a very
short amount of time.This can occur for numerous reasons, but typically it’s because
there is some opportunity that someone wants to capture before it goes away. While
it’s not an ideal situation, it’s certainly common in the corporate world. If you’re
pressed to get a project underway very quickly or you know that certain data will be
seen as extraneous, bothersome, or presenting it would be considered an act of
insubordination, you can create an abbreviated project proposal. In those instances,
you can instead create a project proposal that includes:
■
Purpose of the project
■
High-level scope (what is and is not included)
■
Target schedule
■
Target resources
■
Target budget
Clearly, if you create an abbreviated proposal, you’re missing the opportunity to
ensure the project aligns with corporate strategy (the business case).You’re also
missing the opportunity to identify market requirements that might impact or inﬂu-
ence the project.You’re missing a lot of opportunities to clearly identify the project,
but sometimes you just have to get the job done and do as you’re told. If you aren’t
going to develop a full-ﬂedged project proposal, make sure you at least cover the
basics because this will be the foundation of the project as well as the basis for deter-
mining project success.As you read subsequent chapters of this book, you’ll gain the
skills to develop the remaining data for the project proposal. We’ll discuss target
schedule, resources, and budget in more detail.
If you do not have all the information you need to develop a solid project pro-
posal, especially the more thorough version listed earlier that includes business case

and ﬁnancial analysis among others, don’t worry. In the next chapter, we’re going to
continue to develop our project plan and deﬁne some of these additional elements.
In some companies, you’re expected to justify the business case or show the
cost/beneﬁt of the project long before you’ve had a chance to develop project
details. It’s difﬁcult to develop the project budget (which describes the cost of the
project in the cost/beneﬁt analysis) before you’ve deﬁned all the work that has to go
into the project.At the same time, you can’t just expect to be handed a blank check
for this yet-to-be deﬁned project. So you have a bit of a dilemma. Let’s take a
minute to discuss estimating at this point in the project lifecycle.
Creating Estimates
At this point in the project planning process, you really only have a wild guess about
what the project will cost and how long it will take unless it’s similar to projects
you’ve done in the past.Therefore, any estimate you toss out at this point would
really be a guess, so informal or ballpark estimates are usually a waste of time at best
and potentially dangerous at worst.You can really tank your reputation by consis-
tently tossing out bad estimates, so try to avoid this whenever possible.
When you need to create a more formal estimate for your project proposal, you
can do so in a number of ways.Again, your estimate will still be just that—an 
estimate—until you actually break down the work into recognizable tasks (we’ll do
that in Chapter 9).The estimate you’ll create at this point should get you closer to
reality and will often be used as a go/no go decision point.
Elements of a Formal Estimate
For an initial, high-level estimate, you should include three key elements:
1.
A list of assumptions that were used to create the estimate.This might
include what is included and excluded and other assumptions that would
impact scope, time, cost, or quality.
2.
A range of variance for the estimate. How far off could you reasonably be?
Sometimes you’re so uncertain that your variance might be 100%, other
times you might be reasonably conﬁdent (especially if it’s similar to another
project you’ve done) and the variance might be as low as 20% or 30%.
3.
A time period for which the estimate is valid. Obviously, an estimate cre-
ated today will likely be completely invalid in three or six months due to
changes in technology, stafﬁng, and market costs. Make sure you attach an
expiration date to your estimate so it doesn’t come back to haunt you eight
months later.

Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects

Developing an Estimate
If you have any historical data you can use in your estimating process, this is the best
place to start. Historical data can help you not only determine costs more closely,
but can also help you review variances and problems that impacted similar projects
in the past. For instance, if a similar project was bogged down because it depended
on one technical “guru” who is in constant demand and this current project requires
the same resource, you’ll need to either build in extra time to work around this
expert’s schedule or build in extra cost to hire an external expert.
It’s also important to understand that the closer you get to actually starting the
project work itself, the more reliable your estimate will be.At each point in the pro-
ject plan lifecycle, your conﬁdence in estimates should increase. For example, at this
point in the project planning process, your conﬁdence in any estimates is (and
should be) fairly low. Once you’ve fully developed functional and technical require-
ments for the project, your conﬁdence in your revised estimates should increase sig-
niﬁcantly. Once you create the work breakdown structure (WBS) for your project,
your revised estimate should become your target. It is at that point you will have to
(and should) commit to your estimates and these become your goals or targets for
the project.
In some cases, it’s impossible to know how long one phase of a project will take
until you have more conﬁdence in your estimates for an earlier phase. In larger pro-
jects, phased estimating is often used to continually reﬁne the project estimates
because as each phase is better deﬁned, the conﬁdence in those estimates increases
and provides input data for later phase estimating.There are three commonly used
methods of developing cost estimates that might be helpful for you: parametric,
bottom-up and top-down.
■
Parametric Estimates  A parametric estimate uses the parameters of other,
similar projects as the basis for the estimate.These often are broken down
into recognizable units such as cost per unit or labor hours per unit. If you
can determine, for instance, the prior cost per user and you know how
many users you’ll have in this project, you can determine the estimated total
cost. If you also know the total time per user, you can multiply the number
of users and the total time to determine the estimated schedule.This is most
useful when you’ve done other similar projects in the recent past.
■
Bottom-up Estimates Bottom-up estimating is the most time con-
suming method of estimating, but it is also the most accurate.The biggest
problem with bottom-up estimating at this point in your project planning
process is that you don’t have enough detail to create a bottom-up estimate.
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning IT Projects • Chapter 5
191

In fact, you typically create a bottom-up estimate based on information
developed from your WBS and you aren’t ready to create your WBS yet.
When you do develop estimates from your WBS data, you really will be
closer to targets (what you’ll be committed to achieving) rather than esti-
mates.To create a bottom-up estimate, you ﬁgure out the time and cost for
every project task (which is determined from the WBS, covered in Chapter
9) and add up it all up. Very accurate, very time-consuming, and not usually
helpful for these early-stage estimates.
■
Top-down Estimates Top-down estimates rely upon historical data from
past projects, so if you’ve never done a similar project before, you cannot
use top-down estimating. It starts with an estimate for the entire project
then assigns a portion to each phase. For instance, you might start with a
project total of $100,000 and estimate that, based on historical data, design
is 10% of the total (cost), planning is 20%, and so forth.You could do this
for time and cost estimates.This is not a particularly accurate estimating
technique unless you are conﬁdent in the total cost of the project and you
have historical data to help you determine the breakdown.

Elevator Estimates
Be very careful when asked for project estimates, whether you’re riding in the ele-
vator or passing in the hallways. “Elevator estimates” are almost always taken at
face value; the word “estimate” seems to disappear and any estimate you gave
becomes “fact.” Suddenly, the number you casually tossed out to the executive
pressing you for “just a ballpark estimate” becomes the target. To avoid this, pre-
pare and practice a standard response such as, “We really haven’t ﬁgured out an
estimate yet, we’re still trying to determine how much work needs to be done.”
If pressed, you may have to come up with a number but there’s danger here too.
Guesstimate too high and you could blow a perfectly good project right out of
the water (“We can’t afford to do that!”); guesstimate too low and you will more
than likely be stuck with that estimate. In some cases, you can hedge your risk by
saying, “Well, we’ve guessed that it’s going to be around $80,000 and take
about 14 weeks, but it could vary by 75% or more.” Essentially, you’ve given
yourself a lot of room by using the word “guess” instead of “estimate” (this often
gets people’s attention) and you also gave a possible variance of 75% (though

Continued

this often isn’t heard clearly). If at all possible, simply say, “We just don’t know
yet. I’ll get back to you with an estimate.” Remember that estimating is part sci-
ence and part art and your skills will get better over time and with experience.
Developing time estimates can be similar to cost estimates, though there are a
few other concepts that will help you develop better time estimates.
■
Effort versus Duration Some people get confused between effort and
duration and it’s vitally important to understand when creating time esti-
mates. Effort is the actual amount of work required to complete a task.
Duration is how long you’ll allow for the completion of that task. Here’s an
example.You might know that it takes 1.5 hours to set up a new desktop
computer for a user. However, you also know that your IT staff have many
other tasks to complete during any given day. Rather than scheduling that
task as a 1.5-hour task (we’ll talk more about scheduling later in the book),
you might give it a 1 day duration.That means that anytime within that
day, the tech will have to ﬁnd 1.5 hours to set up that desktop computer.
Now, you might actually have that tech scheduled to do 14 other things
that day, but setting up that computer must be completed during that 1-day
time frame.That’s a duration of 1 day for an effort of 1.5 hours. If you start
scheduling for effort rather than duration, you’ll ﬁnd your schedule gets out
of whack very quickly.The same goes for estimating. Use duration, based
on your assumptions about effort, to build time estimates.
■
First Time/First Use Penalty Remember the last time you tried to
upgrade a software package or install a new server for the ﬁrst time? It took
far longer than subsequent upgrades or installations.There’s always a ﬁrst
time/ﬁrst use learning curve and this should be taken into account if you’re
working on a project that is unlike anything you’ve done in the past. While
you may not be able to quantify this, you might be able to look back on
other times you’ve had to do something for the ﬁrst time and get a feel for
how much extra time you should allow for a ﬁrst time/ﬁrst use type of
project.
■
Schedule versus Resource-Driven Projects Some projects are
schedule-driven, meaning that the overriding constraint or “must have” is a
ﬁnal delivery date. Other projects are resource-driven, meaning the over-
riding constraint is the availability of resources.As you can probably tell,
these two are fairly different types of projects.A schedule-driven project
means it must be completed at a particular point in time and therefore
you’ll need to schedule resources in a way that gets the project done on
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning IT Projects • Chapter 5
193

time. Scheduling a resource-driven project means that you’ll have to work
around availability issues with various resources and this often means the
project may take longer to complete. Understanding which it the over-
riding constraint on your IT project will help you develop better estimates.
■
Milestones We’ll discuss milestones in more detail later, but for the pur-
poses of time estimating, they can be helpful if you know of any milestones
in advance. For instance, you might estimate the time each phase of a pro-
ject will take and create milestones for each phase.You might also have
external constraints that will impact your project schedule and you may
want to include those. If your project relies on a new version of a software
application that is supposed to be released in May, you may set a milestone
in May for that event. If the software application isn’t released until July,
that will delay your scheduled completion date. Milestones can help you
look at the calendar with a mile-high view that can be helpful in deter-
mining high-level schedules and time estimates.You can also sometimes
work your way backward from a particular milestone to get an idea of
when something must start or be completed.
Cheat Sheet…
IT Project Proposals
There are many elements that may come into play in an IT project proposal. At
this stage of the process, you want to stick to high-level elements such as the
problem and mission statements, the proposed solution, the high level scope,
and information related to how the IT project aligns with corporate and/or IT
strategies. You probably don’t have enough detail at this point to actually get
into more detail, but if there are details you know you want to include in your
project, you can mention them brieﬂy in the project proposal or keep a separate
document with these reminders so you can include them later in the project.
Examples of items that might not belong in this initial project proposal that you’d
want to include later might be critical user data or requirements, special factors
related to resource cost or availability, a statement of work, or elements of a
client contract. All of these things are important to the project, but unless they
are critical for determining the initial project parameters (discussed throughout
this chapter), you may want to keep things simple and not include them in the
project proposal. If your company has a very formal project proposal process, all
of these added details may be appropriate.

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Develop the project proposal. If you were handed a project proposal,
you should now have most (if not all) of the data you need to validate
that proposal. While there may be elements in the proposal, such as
market data, that we did not speciﬁcally cover in this chapter, you can
take time to validate those elements as well. If you were not handed a
project proposal to start with, you now have some excellent data at your
disposal for creating a thorough project proposal. Once this document is
prepared, you should bring it to your project sponsor for approval. This
is one of the ﬁrst and most critical project checkpoints because misun-
derstandings here will multiply and become more expensive and more
difﬁcult to resolve later.

Identifying the Project Sponsor
Throughout this chapter, we’ve mentioned the project sponsor.At the outset of the
chapter, we deﬁned the project sponsor as the person to whom you must go to get
formal and informal approval for project parameters such as the project proposal, the
cost, time, and other details of the project. Sometimes the project sponsor is your
manager, sometimes the project sponsor it an executive higher up in the company.
Sometimes, though less often, you are both the project sponsor and the project man-
ager. However, for the purposes of our discussion, we’re assuming there is another
person to whom you must go to get approval for various elements of the project.
The project sponsor is also the person who will defend the project if it gets into
political, ﬁnancial, or other trouble; he or she is the person who (ideally) can rally
corporate resources for your project.The project sponsor is typically the person to
whom you must go for budget and schedule approval and to sign for or approve “big
ticket” items. Finally, the project sponsor can act as your ally to help you keep the
project on course and on time. While the project sponsor may or may not be in
constant communication with you about the project, there should be a clear line of
communication between you and the project sponsor. We’ll discuss how to set up
some of the communication protocols and procedures in the next chapter.
Why are we discussing this? Because sometimes it’s not clear who the project
sponsor is and this creates a problem both near and long-term.To whom do you go
for clariﬁcation? To whom do you go to get approval to spend $10,000 on new
equipment required for the project? Typically a project manager will have the
authority to spend money or assign resources within certain limits, but the project
sponsor is usually the person that approves the overall project proposal, scope,
budget, and schedule. It’s also important to identify your project sponsor not just
because he or she will be signing various requests for resources, but because if the
project runs into trouble, you need someone with the authority to back you up.
Ensuring you know who your project sponsor is (and that your project sponsor
knows he or she is the project sponsor) is critical, so this is as good a time as any to
get that squared away.

Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects

The IT Factor…
Approaching the Assigned Project’s Sponsor
As you know from your experience and from reading the opening pages of this
chapter, some projects are assigned from higher up in the organization. Typically,
the person that assigns it to you is the project sponsor. You might at ﬁrst glance
think that you should simply take the project and run with it, since it was assigned.
However, in the ideal world of project management, you would step back and go
through the exact same steps you would as if you were working on a needs-driven
project. While you must be aware of corporate politics and accepted work
methods, you should still go through each project step. Here’s why. Executives in
companies often rely upon the project manager to come back and validate the
project and/or its parameters. They may rely upon the knowledge, expertise, and
skills of the project manager in planning the project (even if they don’t speciﬁcally
say so). If you and the project team go through the project deﬁnition stages and
determine this is the wrong project, the wrong time, or it’s solving the wrong
problem, it’s your job to say so. The project sponsor may still want you to move
forward, but if there is a problem with the project the sponsor is not aware of, it’s
certainly better to ﬁnd out now rather than later after hundreds (or thousands) of
hours and dollars are spent pursuing a ﬂawed project plan.
Gaining Validated 
Project Proposal Approval
By now, you have a solid understanding of the purpose of the project.You’ve done
some initial work with a small expert team and you’ve developed your project’s
problem and mission statements, you’ve looked at potential solutions and narrowed
down the list to either one selected, optimal solution or a ranked list of the top
potential solutions.You’ve looked at the corporate and IT strategies and determined
which solutions make the best business case and which ones support the direction
the company is headed. If these don’t all add up to the project everyone had in
mind, you’ve got a minor problem to address. It means the results of your project
planning thus far don’t map with the assigned project or the project proposal or the
problem that was identiﬁed.That disconnect is important information that shouldn’t
just be swept under the carpet. Instead, take time with your team and/or your pro-
ject sponsor to identify the problem. It might be that in the process of looking at
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning IT Projects • Chapter 5
197

that problem you uncovered a fundamental ﬂaw in your thinking (not necessarily
you, personally).This is the best time to discover these kinds of issues because you
can develop alternatives and solutions now rather than trying to patch together a
solution later in the process. Of course, some companies and some executives just
don’t want to hear it.That’s ok.Your job is to validate the project proposal and bring
your ﬁndings to your project sponsor for approval. If he or she says, in essence,“I
don’t care about your ﬁndings, just do this project in this way,” you’ll probably have
to do that. Be prepared, however, for problems down the road if the best solution is
not the one implemented. On the other hand, also keep in mind that corporate
executives often have access to information that you may not have and their ratio-
nale for moving forward with a project might be very well founded even if you are
not privy to the details.
Earlier in the book, we discussed aligning your IT projects with corporate goals
and objectives. If you haven’t done so, you should also make the business case for
your IT project.That might include doing a cost/beneﬁt analysis or a SWOT anal-
ysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) to verify this project is aligned
with IT and corporate goals. Since we covered that earlier, we won’t repeat it here,
but your project proposal ideally will include the business case for the project as well
as the other data discussed.
Once you’ve got all this data assembled, you should compile a project proposal.
If you were handed a project proposal, you can modify or revise it as needed based
on your team’s ﬁndings. Documenting and summarizing your process results
(problem statement, mission statement, etc.) to this point in a formal project proposal
document will help you keep track of what’s been done and why so you don’t have
to revisit this section of work again and again. Write up the project proposal using
whatever format your company prefers or requires (visit www.syngress.com/
solutions for a project proposal template you can download and use) and set up a
time to meet with your project sponsor. If you’ve included a target for scope (the
total amount of work to be accomplished), time, cost, and quality, make it absolutely
clear these are targets and not commitments at this point. Later, after we’ve developed
additional project detail, we will make commitments on these four elements, but for
now, without extensive time and research, you should avoid committing to these tar-
gets.That may not always be possible, but it should be your goal. One of the big
dangers of targets at this point is that they somehow get translated into commit-
ments through the corporate process.Tread carefully here.
Project proposal approval, ideally, should be a signature on a piece of paper or an
e-mail stating approval for the proposed project (see Figure 5.8). It’s important to
have your project sponsor formally agree to the work and assumptions done this far.
After all, you should both have some skin in the game. If you have no formal
www.syngress.com
198
Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects

approval here, it’s possible the project sponsor might not back you up if things get
political or the project goes south at a later date. Formal approval makes both the
project manager and the project sponsor responsible for the project.There are
numerous approval points we’ll discuss in the project planning and project managing
phases and each is important. However, every company has different ways of dealing
with these types of activities and if you suddenly show up with a pen and paper for
someone to sign when that’s not how your company does business, you’re going to
either get some very strange looks or create a bit of paranoia. Use your best judg-
ment, but do get formal approval in writing (paper or electronically) at each approval
point whenever possible.
One last comment here. Sometimes a project makes it to this point and is
scrapped.That’s why the diagram shown at the opening (and end) of this chapter
(refer to Figure 5.1 or Figure 5.9) shows the small oval that says “Terminate project.”
Sometimes you can’t validate the project, other times factors have changed signiﬁ-
cantly causing you (and/or your project sponsor) to decide to scrap the project or
put it on hold. So, sometimes you’ll move ahead with a project at this point, some-
times you’ll need to go back and rework things and sometimes you’ll agree it’s time
to leave this project behind and move on. If you believe the project still has merit,
you’ll need to negotiate and make a convincing argument. Otherwise, view a
scrapped project as a win—you avoided wasting precious time and resources on a
project that should not have proceeded and you’ve done your job.

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Get approval for your project proposal. Though in some cases you may
not develop a project proposal, in most cases you’ll at least need to get
approval for your project problem and mission statement and selected
solution (bare minimum). Ideally, you’ll also have a target in mind for
the scope, time, cost, and quality of the project and you’ll be able to
state the business case or show how the project aligns with corporate
and IT strategies. Once that’s prepared, it’s critical to get formal project
sponsor approval. Whether in writing or via e-mail, make sure you get
the formal OK to move forward with the project as it is currently deﬁned
or you could ﬁnd yourself all alone later if the project runs into prob-
lems. Remember that sometimes the project will proceed, sometimes
you’ll have to go back and revise certain elements, and sometimes you’ll
just deep-six the whole thing. That’s exactly why you go through these
steps in the ﬁrst place—to make sure you’re doing the right project(s) at
the right time for the right reasons.

Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects

Summary
We began the chapter by looking at the IT project management steps that you can
use to get a visual idea of where we are in the process.The ﬁrst step is Deﬁning the
Project and we looked at the ﬂowchart that shows the inputs, actions, and outputs.
The summary is shown here in Figure 5.9.The documents or data that are the
deﬁned results of this step in the project planning process, Deﬁning the Project,
are shown in Figure 5.10.
Figure 5.9 Summary of Deﬁning the Project Step 
The problem statement identiﬁes the unique problem to be solved by the pro-
ject. Remember, some problems are better solved by a new or modiﬁed process
rather than a project.
The mission statement describes the desired outcome. By deﬁning both the
problem and the desired outcome, you are essentially describing the gap between
where you are and where you want to be.That helps deﬁne the potential solutions
that will ﬁll that gap.
Developing a list of potential solutions should be an energizing, creative under-
taking if possible.Thinking outside the box can help you come up with innovative
solutions that might have been missed if you’d simply listed the most logical solu-
tions. Even if the solution has been handed to you or assigned, going through this
process will either validate or invalidate that assigned solution so you’ll at least know
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning IT Projects • Chapter 5
201

how close or far off the mark this required solution is.This may give you adequate
information to go back to the project sponsor and make the case for a different,
more optimal solution.
Figure 5.10 Results of Deﬁning the Project 
Once you have developed potential solutions, you’ll need to rank them
according to pre-deﬁned criteria.These criteria vary from company to company, but
some include alignment with corporate and IT strategies, alignment with market
requirements or needs as well as other criteria. In the absence of formal criteria, you
can also look at which solutions are the most logical, feasible, desirable, and afford-
able. Once you’ve created your ranking criteria, you can match your solutions to

these criteria and develop a ranked list of potential solutions.The most optimal solu-
tion(s) should rise to the top of the list.A bit of human intelligence might be
needed to review the list and make sure the results make sense. Select your top
choice(s) to submit to your project sponsor for approval or prepare data explaining
why the assigned solution is not the optimal solution.
Once you’ve compiled all this data into a project proposal, you should bring it to
your project sponsor for approval. Formal approval, whether in writing or in e-mail,
is critical to ensure you and the project sponsor are in agreement about the funda-
mentals of the project. It’s also important to have project sponsor approval in case
something in the project goes wrong later. It’s more difﬁcult to start pointing ﬁngers
when things are clearly spelled out.

Project Management Process Overview
 The project management process has seven major steps: deﬁne, organize,
form the team, plan, manage, track, and close the project.
 The project management process is iterative.You may have to repeat several
steps a number of times in order to clearly deﬁne, organize, and manage
your project.
 Sometimes projects are terminated after this process is complete because
the data developed during the deﬁnition stage does not support moving
forward with the project.
 It’s better to terminate a project early before valuable time and resources
are committed or expended on a project that, ultimately, is not the right
project at the right time.
Project Origins
 A project, by deﬁnition, is a unique solution to a deﬁned problem. Projects
can originate from a stated problem.These are needs-driven projects.
 Sometimes projects originate from a proposed (or assigned) solution.These
are solution-oriented projects.These still have to be validated and the
underlying problem must still be deﬁned.
www.syngress.com
Deﬁning IT Projects • Chapter 5
203

 Some project managers are handed a project by way of a project proposal.
This assumes that some analysis and research has already been done. If a
project proposal exists, the project manager should validate the proposal to
ensure that the project is still appropriate, feasible, and desirable.Things
change rapidly and an old project proposal may be out of date.
Validating the Project Proposal
 Whether you’re validating a project proposal or beginning the project
deﬁnition phase, you should form a small team to help you with these
initial tasks.Two (or three or four) heads are better than one.
 Reviewing the project proposal you’ve been handed is the ﬁrst step toward
validating the proposal. Gather all related materials so you can properly
evaluate the data contained in the proposal.
 At minimum, a project proposal should have the problem and mission
statement, the optimal or proposed solution, as well as some initial targets
including scope, time, cost, and quality.
 A more formal project proposal could contain data that makes the business
case for the project showing how it aligns with corporate and/or IT
strategies, how it addresses a need in the market, or how it addresses a
customer/user need.
 Each company may have a unique approach or attitude toward a project
proposal. Follow your company’s guidelines, but make sure you include the
basics so you’ll know what you’re doing and what the project will entail.
 If the project cannot be validated, you’ve either made errors in your
research or the project should not be undertaken. Sometimes projects are
scrapped at this stage if they cannot be validated.
Deﬁning the Project
 The deﬁnition phase includes these elements: problem statement, project
mission statement, list of potential solutions, selected solution, and project
proposal.
 A clear, concise problem statement is fundamental to a successful project.
Make sure you’re solving the right problem with a well-crafted problem
statement.
www.syngress.com
204
Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects

 The project mission statement describes the desired outcomes or results, not
how those results will be achieved.A well-written mission statement can help
describe the gap between where you are and where you want/need to be.
 The list of potential solutions should begin as a brainstormed list of all
potential solutions. Don’t ﬁlter ideas until all have been recorded.
 Develop a list of criteria for the project (if possible) so you can determine
optimal solutions. Criteria can include scope, time, cost, quality, market, or
user requirements.
 Develop a ranked list of potential solutions and select the best ﬁt for both
the stated problem and desired outcome(s).
Developing the Project Proposal
 Develop a project proposal that outlines the problem, mission, selected
solution, and the business case for the project.
 Include other project details in the project proposal only if they are known
or relevant to making the decision to move forward at this point.
Otherwise, capture that data for later use.
 Some companies neither require nor desire a formal project proposal.
Develop the basic data for your own sake even if a formal process is not in
place.
 There are numerous methods for creating high-level estimates that you
should be familiar with. Some help you develop better cost estimates and
others help you develop better time/schedule estimates.
 Remember that an estimate is really an educated guess, but it often
becomes your project target.Avoid giving estimates until you have the data
to support those estimates.
Identifying the Project Sponsor
 The person who assigns the project to you is typically the project sponsor.
 Ensure you are clear who the project sponsor is and that the project
sponsor knows he or she is the project sponsor.

Chapter 5 • Deﬁning IT Projects
 The project sponsor is the person who can rally corporate resources on
behalf of your project, approve budgets and timelines, and help you stay on
course with your project.
Gaining Validated Project Proposal Approval
 Once you have deﬁned the problem, mission, and optimal (or selected)
solution, you should formalize this data in a project proposal.
 A project proposal can be short or long, formal or informal, but it should
capture at least the essential elements.
 Sometimes the project manager and project sponsor may forgo a more
lengthy or formal project proposal in favor of taking immediate action on
an opportunity.The project manager and small team should still take time
to deﬁne the project (problem and mission statement, potential and selected
solutions) to both validate the fast action and to ensure everyone is headed
in the same direction.
 These initial deﬁnition steps can be performed very quickly with a small,
focused team.
 A project proposal, ideally, should be presented to the project sponsor for
formal approval.This is the ﬁrst of many checkpoints in the IT project
management process that we’ll discuss.
 Formal project approval is important to ensure that the assumptions under
which you’re operating are correct, that you and the project sponsor agree
on the basic project data and direction, and to assure you that you’re
covered later on if the project runs into trouble.

Q: We’ve never used a formal project management process in our company. It
seems like this will be an uphill battle.
A: Remember that throughout this chapter and this book, we’re describing best
practices and ideal circumstances (except where noted). Clearly, many compa-
nies use little or no formal project management processes. Some would argue
that things are running quite well, but if they were to take time to examine
results, they’d probably see results that track with the statistics given earlier in
this book (low project success rates). If you’re the IT project manager, you
can begin by going through these steps yourself or with a small team. If your
company is resistant to these processes, you’ll have to slowly educate those
around you (including those higher up) as to the beneﬁts of taking time to
plan.The information presented earlier in this book should give you ample
data to present your case and even if it falls on deaf ears, your improved IT
project results will, over time, win over the doubters.Yes, it may be an uphill
battle, but implement as many of these steps and processes as possible and
your project results will absolutely be better than without.
Q: I’m an IT project manager and I’m interested in getting better project results.
I just can’t realistically see me or my team implementing all of these steps—
like writing a project proposal—that would never ﬂy.Any comment?
A: One of the best parts of a simple, straightforward IT project management
methodology, like the one presented in this book, is that you can use it in
any way that suits you. While it’s true that you will get far better results from
implementing the entire methodology, it’s also true that you can improve any
project you’re working on by implementing even just one part of the IT PM
process. For instance, you will ﬁnd better results simply by clearly stating the
problem or by brainstorming other potential solutions besides the one you
were assigned. Some people ﬁnd that implementing a new process one piece

at a time suits their style or the company’s style better—that’s ﬁne.The key is
to make continuous improvement. Start by implementing one step that will
have the greatest impact on your projects. Once that’s completely incorpo-
rated into your process, pick another step. Don’t be overly concerned with
perfectly implementing an entire new process or methodology if that’s not
your style.And, if you have any of those analyst types we discussed in Chapter
4, now’s the time to get them involved.
Q: I’m often handed a project with the scope, time, cost, and quality elements
already pre-deﬁned.You mentioned how to validate the project, but can you
provide more advice on how to “push back” within the organization. My
boss (who is usually the project sponsor) believes he has already done ade-
quate research when he hands these projects to me.
A: Your situation is actually pretty common and if you can learn to deal with
this situation effectively, you’ll make real gains in improving project results.
We’ll discuss these four elements in more detail later in the book, but in
terms of your approach to your project sponsor, it will be important to
understand the environment.You might begin by reviewing past projects on
your own and comparing required results (the ones your boss handed to you)
to actual results. Chances are extremely high that these assigned projects’
parameters (scope, time, cost, quality) have rarely, if ever, been met. Sure, you
might have met a timeline if that was most important, but that probably
meant you ran over on the budget or had to cut the scope. If that’s the case,
you can begin to look at where and how these projects varied from the
required parameters.Then, you might have an opportunity to sit down with
your boss and discuss these variances. Unless your boss is the type to say
something like,“These projects were just never well managed,” you should
have the opportunity to gain agreement on the things you, your boss, and
your IT team can do differently in the future to ensure the projects are more
successful. If you don’t try to do something differently, you’ll just keep gener-
ating the same results. It’s entirely possible that the time or cost overruns that
happened on past projects is simply an acceptable and expected way of doing
business in your company. If that’s the case, you can learn these IT project
management steps and implement them, even if you don’t have formal
approval of the various elements. If that ends up being the case, you can still
create the information and data for the project and simply not bring them
through the formal approval process if that’s going to create more problems

than it solves. Ideally, your boss will begin to see better results and will be
more open to changes later on. Better results can be very convincing and
worst case, you’ll be a better IT project manager even if your boss never
changes.
Q: Our company had a big push a few years back to implement IT project man-
agement and it basically failed.After spending hundreds of hours and thou-
sands of dollars on training and methodologies and the like, everyone
basically went back to doing things the way they’d always done them. I think
IT PM is a great idea, in theory, but I’m having difﬁculty ﬁguring out how
we’d get this going in my company.Any suggestions?
A: You describe a very common scenario. Changing habits and behaviors is not
an easy thing to do. Psychologists and behaviorists will all tell you that the
best way to make lasting change is in small increments. Large, wholesale
changes rarely take hold, though in some cases you do need to shake things
up completely to break out of old patterns.Your company made an attempt
to do something different, but it didn’t stick for one of two reasons (well,
there may be others, but these are the top two). Either the methodology was
so radically different from how you currently did things that no one could
implement the entire system successfully or there was lack of support for this
change at the top of the organization. Lack of support can take on various
appearances. For instance, if top executives never expected or required a pro-
ject proposal before heading into a new project, then eventually project pro-
posals stop being created.This lack of support for the new process eventually
leads back to old behaviors and patterns. If you’re trying to implement
change in your organization now, you have a doubly tough task because you
have the added burden of hearing “We tried that before and it didn’t work.”
Instead of trying for wholesale change, pick one thing and do it differently.
Small changes are often more manageable and once they take hold, you can
move on to the next change.Take this process step by step. For instance, you
might simply begin by crafting clear problem statement for every project that
comes your way. Once everyone accepts that projects begin with a problem
statement, you can begin trying to get everyone to come up with a mission
statement by asking what the desired outcomes are for the project. Jamming
an entirely new system down your team or company’s throat without strong
executive support is often the least effective approach, so start with small
steps.

Q: We learned about deﬁning the project in this chapter, but isn’t there more to
deﬁning a project than just identifying the problem, mission, and solution?
A: Yes, there is and you’ll learn about additional elements of project planning in
the next chapter.At this point, you do have your project deﬁned—meaning
you know what problem it is trying to solve, what mission it is trying to
accomplish, and what the potential solutions and optimal solution are.That’s a
pretty clear starting point and one from which we can now build. In Chapter
6, we’ll develop more detail project information.

Introduction
In Chapter 5, you learned how to validate a project proposal that was assigned to
you and to develop a high-level deﬁnition of an IT project. In this chapter, we’re
going to continue along that same line, adding detail and organizing the project as
well.As you know, IT project management (IT PM) is an iterative process and you’ll
revisit various steps more than once. It’s also true that in many instances, IT PM
steps occur concurrently or out of order. For instance, it’s possible that during the
high-level deﬁnition stage, you also developed additional project deﬁnitions and data
that we’ll discuss in this chapter. While there is a logical ﬂow to the IT PM steps, in
the real world things don’t always follow an ideal order.The key is to properly deﬁne
and organize your IT project before you start actually doing the work of the project,
whenever possible.
If a project is in trouble, the steps we’re going to discuss in this chapter are often
the ones that were skipped. If you’re taking over a project, especially one that’s
ﬂirting with disaster, go back and review or verify the steps listed in Chapter 5 and
this chapter.You need not do all the steps with the same rigor or with the same level
of detail, but you should verify these steps were performed and performed correctly
if you’re working on a project that is faltering.You should also review the conclu-
sions and decisions made if the project is in trouble because it’s often here that
trouble begins (usually by skipping these important preliminary steps).
In this chapter, we’re going to develop a bit more project detail including ele-
ments such as priorities, speciﬁcations, user requirements, and project infrastructure,
to name just a few. Before we get into the details, let’s review our IT project man-
agement overview diagram, shown in Figure 6.1, to keep track of where we are and
where we’re headed.

Now that you see where we are in the process, let’s deﬁne a few terms we’ll be
using in this chapter.
■
Assumptions The information and concepts that are assumed to be true
(or false) at the outset of the planning phase of the project. Clearly identi-
fying relevant assumptions can be helpful in avoiding mistakes later in the
project.
■
Customer or user A customer or user is deﬁned here as anyone who will
use or rely upon the output of the project. Customers/users can be internal
or external, existing (current), or targeted (desired).

■
Derived requirements The requirements that are derived or come from
primary requirements of the project.They may be additional technical
requirements that stem from stakeholder requirements.
■
Flexibility matrix A matrix or grid indicating the relative ﬂexibility of
project scope, schedule, and resources.This is used as a decision-making
tool to help the team make appropriate decisions throughout the project
management process. Schedule-driven projects have the least ﬂexibility in
the schedule, for example.
■
Framework The processes and procedures your project and project team
will use to successfully implement and manage the project.
■
Major deliverables This term is used interchangeably with objectives to
indicate the high-level outcomes for the project.
■
Objectives High-level statements about what the project will accomplish.
These are typically categories of work to be accomplished in the project.This
can also be called major deliverables.
■
Precision The term precision will be used interchangeably with rigor. How
precisely you execute each step of the project management process will
depend greatly on the complexity, expense, and criticality of the project.
■
Project organization The team that will be involved in the project
including the project manager, project sponsor, core project team, and con-
tributor team.
■
Project parameters The deﬁning of the project objectives, scope, budget,
timeline, quality, success criteria, ﬂexibility grid, and deliverables. This may
also include hardware or software boundaries or requirements that set the
minimum criteria for project expectations.
■
Requirements The elements the project must deliver to meet the expec-
tations of the stakeholder(s) and project sponsor.Also called primary 
requirements.
■
Rigor Rigor, or precision, is used to deﬁne how much or how little detail
and effort you apply in each step or phase. Very rigorous planning is
required for complex, expensive, or critical projects. Less rigor is often
acceptable for shorter, more “casual” projects.
■
Stakeholder Anyone with a stake, or interest, in the outcome of the pro-
ject.This typically includes those people outside of the project including
the project sponsor, users, customers, vendors, corporate executives, and/or
www.syngress.com
214

shareholders.Although the project management and project team have an
interest in the outcome of the project, they are internal to the project and
are usually excluded from the collective term stakeholder as it pertains to
project outcomes.
■
Success criteria The clear, concise, accurate statements that indicate how
the team, project sponsor, and organization will know that the project is
successful.
As we did in Chapter 5, we also have a ﬂowchart for the inputs, actions, and
outputs of this phase of the IT project planning process. Figure 6.2 depicts these ele-
ments. If you’re not a ﬂowchart kind of person, don’t be put off by these diagrams.
They are intended to simply help you visualize the process we’ll describe in this
chapter.
Figure 6.2 IT Project Organizing Phase
Within the Organizing the Project step or phase, there are six discrete steps. Let’s
discuss each one brieﬂy so you know what the inputs, actions, and outputs are for
this phase.

1.
INPUT The input in this case is the validated, approved project proposal,
which was the output from the previous step (see Chapter 5). If your orga-
nization does not use a formal project proposal, you should at least have the
data collected during the deﬁning stage of the process, which includes the
problem statement, mission statement, potential solutions, selected solution,
target scope, target timeline, target budget, and target quality.
2.
ACTION Using your project proposal (or equivalent data) as the starting
point, we’ll go into the project organizing process described in this chapter.
This process is a deﬁned set of steps you’ll use that will result in a more
detailed project document. It is at this point that the project should begin
to take form.You should have key data compiled and you should create a
formal method for storing this data.You should also have deﬁned the ways
in which you and your team will work with the project sponsor.
3.
OUTPUT The output from this phase or step is a formalized system or
method of storing project data.This is referred to as the project notebook, pro-
ject workbook, or high-level project plan, and it can be in the form of a physical
notebook, a virtual notebook containing ﬁles stored in a folder on a shared
network drive, or ﬁles stored using your company’s collaboration tools
(Lotus Notes, Microsoft SharePoint, corporate intranet, etc.). Regardless of
the form it takes, there should be a formal document storage process in
place before you go on to the next phase.
4.
CHECKPOINT  All the high-level data should be approved by the pro-
ject sponsor at this point.This includes the project objectives, parameters,
and stakeholders, among others. In some projects, this step may not be nec-
essary, but typically you should gain agreement from your project sponsor
on the content and frequency of project checkpoints moving forward.
5.
DECISION POINT  Based on the response of your project sponsor,
you’ll either need to go back and re-work parts of your project documen-
tation or continue on to the next step, planning your project. If the sponsor
gives the project the go ahead, you continue. If not, you will have to
address the project sponsor’s speciﬁc concerns and revise the project param-
eters and submit it for approval again.This may be an iterative process
where you’ll need to make several revisions before the project sponsor
agrees to the document. It’s also possible that based on the information
gathered thus far, the project sponsor (or project manager) recommends
terminating the project.This can occur if it becomes clear that with the
additional data provided that the project just doesn’t make sense.A project
www.syngress.com

can (and should) be cancelled at any point before actual work begins if the
project parameters shift or if the external environment shifts in such a way
that the project no longer makes sense.
6.
NEXT STEP  Once you have approval from the project sponsor for the
additional project details developed in this stage, you can move on to the
detailed project planning process.These steps are discussed in Chapter 7.
Cheat Sheet…
Deﬁning and Organizing Your IT Project
In Chapter 5 and in this chapter, we’re discussing ways to deﬁne and organize
your project before you get into the detailed planning stage. The reason for this
is because if you don’t properly deﬁne what you’re going to do, the detailed
planning may either have to be redone or your project may ultimately address the
wrong problem or provide a “useless” solution. Through these stages, you not
only get a good idea of what the project will look like, but you have a great
opportunity to get feedback from the project sponsor. Changes are very easy to
make at this stage and if you can deﬁne the project clearly and concisely at this
point, your detailed planning stage will be a lot easier. Lack of clearly deﬁned pro-
ject goals and objectives are a major cause of project failure, so success starts
here.
Keep in mind that if you have a small project, you can abbreviate these steps
and phases. You shouldn’t skip any of these steps, but you can shorten them. For
instance, on a small, two-week project, you may write up a one-page project pro-
posal that identiﬁes the problem, mission, solution, target scope, budget, and
timeline. You should be able to generate this document in under 30 minutes. The
project sponsor can approve this document and you can move on to the orga-
nizing and planning stages quickly. A short, easy project requires far less detail
and far less structure than a large, complex project, though the steps you take
each project through should always be the same. Remember, process for process’
sake is a waste of time, but having a deﬁned process or methodology that you
can expand or shrink as needed will make your planning more consistent and
your projects more successful.

Identifying Project Objectives
In Chapter 5, you deﬁned the project mission statement, which was a statement of
the desired outcome(s) for the project.You also selected the best solution based on
various parameters. Based on both the desired outcome and the solution selected,
you can now begin to deﬁne or identify several high-level project objectives.These
objectives should identify what you want to accomplish, not necessarily how you’re
going to accomplish it. However, you will also begin to identify, at a high level, how
you’ll accomplish this project.The details of how to accomplish your project’s objec-
tives are discussed in detail in the next chapter.
Project Objective Statement
The ﬁrst step in identifying project objectives or major deliverables is to create a project
objective statement. It’s similar to the project mission statement, but it should be
much more speciﬁc to your project because it should incorporate the problem, the
mission, and the selected solution (see Chapter 5). Here’s a great rule of thumb
about creating any of these statements (problem, mission, or objective): if you can’t
state it clearly and concisely (50 words or so) you probably don’t have a good under-
standing of what the project is trying to accomplish.Again, this doesn’t need to take
days or weeks to accomplish, but if you can’t describe the high-level objectives or
deliverables quickly and in 50 words or less, you may need to revisit some of the
steps in Chapter 5. For example,“Replace all servers used in the Marketing depart-
ment with new servers to provide improved response time, reliability, and security
with all new equipment in place no later than December 31, 2005.”This begins to
describe your approach to the project based on the parameters you’ve deﬁned.
Project Objectives or Major Deliverables
Once you have your objective statement, you can further reﬁne it by breaking it
down into three to ﬁve high-level objectives or major deliverables that ﬁt the project
problem, mission, and solution. It’s good to keep the problem and mission statements
in mind when deﬁning project objectives because it’s easy to get off course other-
wise.These objectives essentially deﬁne how you’re going to approach the project, so
spending time to develop these will help you moving forward.
We limit our objectives to three to ﬁve items for two primary reasons. First, if
you cannot deﬁne your project in terms of ﬁve (or fewer) objectives or major deliv-
erables, it’s entirely possible the project is too large and should be broken in to sev-
eral smaller projects. Second, if you cannot deﬁne your project’s objectives in ﬁve or
fewer major deliverables, you may be including too much detail in your list of high-
www.syngress.com
218
Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

level objectives. It’s also true that three to ﬁve major deliverables may not be enough
for your project. If your project demands six or eight or ten major deliverables, that’s
ﬁne. Just be sure that each of the major deliverables or objectives you deﬁne is, in
fact, a high-level one. It’s very common for people to begin digging down into the
project detail when developing objectives.All objectives at this point should deﬁne
high-level categories. If all of your objectives are not at the same level of detail,
you’re probably going into detail in one or more areas. Later when you deﬁne the
activities or tasks under each objective, you will probably delve into differing levels
of detail since not all objectives will necessarily have the same level of detail. When
deﬁning high-level objectives, though, they should all be at the same level.
Deﬁne What IS and IS NOT Included
One exercise that many people ﬁnd useful is to deﬁne what is and is not included in
the project. When you’re deﬁning your project’s major deliverables, you can begin by
stating what the major deliverables are.To avoid confusion and to really help clarify
the deliverables, you can also state what your deliverables are not. Other language
that can be used to describe this process is to deﬁne what is in scope and out of scope
or to deﬁne what the project includes and excludes. Obviously, your project is not a lot
of things, but we’re only concerned here with the things that are related to what
your stated objectives are. For instance, if the project is to upgrade the network
infrastructure, you might state,“Replace all network servers that were placed in ser-
vice prior to July 1, 2002.”That tells you what server hardware will be replaced, but
it doesn’t deﬁne speciﬁcally what hardware will not be replaced. In this case, you
might say,“Departmental servers and application servers are not considered network
servers and will not be included in this project.” If the project is a software upgrade
to your company’s software product, you might state that,“Critical issues and hot
ﬁxes reported since the last release will be included in this project. File export and
reporting capabilities upgrades and ﬁxes will not be included.”
By stating what is and is not addressed at this point in the project gives you
another reality check. If you write all this up and bring it back to your sponsor (as
you will do before you exit this phase), your sponsor might or might not agree with
what you’ve stated as included or excluded. It’s certainly better to know here that
your project sponsor had different expectations or a different view of the project
than you and your team did. If your project sponsor assumed that the software
upgrade project would absolutely include ﬁxes to the ﬁle export functionality and
you state that is not part of the project, you’ve got a great opportunity to modify the
project plan before anyone has written a single line of code. It might also be at this
point that you begin to notice shifting ideas, plans, priorities, and directives from
www.syngress.com
Organizing IT Projects • Chapter 6
219

your project sponsor. Once a project starts taking shape, the project sponsor may
realize that the project is not what he or she expected or that other things in the
organization or external environment have shifted.That’s ﬁne as long as you are able
to pin down the project details. If you can’t, you will constantly be trying to hit a
moving target and it’s almost guaranteed that your project will fail to satisfy the
sponsor or other stakeholders. If possible, don’t leave this stage of project deﬁnition
and organization until you have these details agreed upon and locked down. It will
be harder later on to gain this level of clarity, especially if the project gets underway
without these details.
You may have heard the term scope creep or you may have experienced scope
creep in your projects. Scope creep happens when features and functionality are added
without addressing the effects of these changes on the time, cost, or schedule of the
project or without customer approval.These are considered uncontrolled changes
that expand the scope (total work to be accomplished) of the project. Sometimes this
happens through small “innocent” changes being requested and other times it hap-
pens through large changes being demanded. In either case, scope creep is one of the
most important things to manage during the project and we’ll discuss managing
scope creep when we discuss managing change later in this book. We discuss it here
because by clearly deﬁning what is and is not part of the project, you begin to draw
the lines around your project’s scope. Doing so helps avoid ﬁnger pointing or confu-
sion and helps you also avoid scope creep later on.
As with other steps we’ve already discussed, this should not take an inordinate
amount of time.That said, the amount of time you spend on very clearly deﬁning your
project’s major deliverables or objectives is time well spent.You may ﬁnd that this step
takes you a bit longer than previous steps took, but the payoff here is signiﬁcant.

Identifying Stakeholders
Stakeholders are any individuals (sometimes companies or groups, but we’ll keep it
simple here) who have an interest or stake in the outcome of the project.Typical stake-
holders are users, corporate executives, project team members, and the project sponsor.
Different stakeholders have different needs, requirements, and expectations, so it’s
important to identify your various stakeholders early in the project’s life.As you move
through the deﬁnition and organization phases of this IT project management process,
you may identify additional stakeholders. Keep in mind that stakeholders usually deﬁne
(or reﬁne) the project’s requirements. Users are those who use or rely upon the pro-
ject’s deliverables, so clearly they have a stake in the project.The company is footing
the bill for the project, so clearly corporate executives have a stake in the project’s out-
come.The project sponsor will be judged upon the success of the project, so clearly
the project sponsor is a stakeholder.There are others who can be stakeholders in dif-
ferent circumstances and each company and project is different.
Identifying Your IT Project’s Stakeholders
When trying to determine who the stakeholders are, you can ask a series of ques-
tions to help you identify stakeholders and to help ensure you don’t inadvertently
overlook an important stakeholder.
1.
Who needs to know about this project?
2.
Who will use this project?
3.
Who is impacted by the results of this project?
4.
Who is impacted by the operations of this project (the actual project itself)?
5.
Who is paying for this project?
6.
Who is approving this project?
7.
Who is delivering this project?
8.
Who needs to be trained?
9.
Who else should we talk to about this project (what else do we 
need to know)?
We’ll discuss each of these questions very brieﬂy to help clarify exactly how
these questions help you identify all potential stakeholders. Remember, though, that
there are stakeholders and then there are stakeholders—meaning there are many dif-
ferent people or groups you’ll identify as stakeholders, but they can then be priori-
tized into primary, secondary, and tertiary stakeholders.This is important to
www.syngress.com
Organizing IT Projects • Chapter 6
221

understand because later in this chapter, we’ll discuss how to work with stakeholders
to deﬁne, reﬁne, and negotiate project requirements.
Who Needs to Know About this Project?
Answering this question helps you identify stakeholders in the company that will be
impacted by this project.This could include groups you might not always think
about such as Human Resources, Marketing, Sales, and Training to name a few.
There may be groups or departments in the company that will be called upon to
lend resources to the project.There may be individuals or groups whose activities
will be impacted by the project.Another approach to this is to take a look at all the
departments in your company (assuming your company isn’t too large) and ask if
that department will be impacted by your project or if anyone in any of those
departments needs to know about your project.
Remember that people will have different information needs. Some individuals
or groups will have to be (or should be) brought into the project planning and deci-
sion-making loop while others may just need to be notiﬁed of the existence of the
project. Once you’ve identiﬁed your stakeholders, you can prioritize them, as we’ll
discuss in just a bit.
Who Will Use this Project?
The results or deliverables for your project are intended for use by someone or some
group.You may already know who the users will be (current or existing) or the users
may be a target market for a new product that doesn’t yet exist. In either case, you
will need to identify who will be using the output of this project. Getting user input
and developing user acceptance criteria are crucial to the success of the project, so
we’ll discuss this later in this chapter.The users of the project’s output are usually
among the most important stakeholders, but they’re not the only stakeholders you’ll
need to address.
Who is Impacted by the Results of this Project?
Understanding who is impacted by the results of the project is also vitally important.
For instance, if you’re implementing a new payroll system, the users may be the
people in Finance and/or Human Resources that will actually use the system, but
everyone at your company who gets a paycheck is potentially impacted by the
results of this project. Understanding the answer to this question can help you
understand how this project will impact your company or your client’s company and
to plan accordingly.
www.syngress.com
222
Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

Who is Impacted by the Operations 
of this Project (the Actual Project Itself)?
This question may seem to overlap earlier questions in terms of identifying stake-
holders and if it does, that’s ﬁne. It’s better to overlap slightly than to leave large
gaps, so you may start ﬁnding duplicates on your stakeholder list as you go through
these questions. It’s a safe bet that if someone (or some group) shows up more than
once or twice on the list, the stakeholder group is very important to your project
and you should treat it as such.
Understanding who is impacted by the operations of the project can include
other departments that may have to lend staff, expertise, time, or other resources to
your project. It can also include people whose jobs or processes may be interrupted
or impacted when the project is underway. It might include who will be impacted
by your project team taking over an ofﬁce or conference room. Using the payroll
example again, the payroll processing clerks will be impacted by this project and they
are also part of the user stakeholder group. However, while you’re working on the
project, you may also need the assistance of accounts payable and accounts receivable
clerks in entering test payroll data, verifying payroll test results, etc. While many of
these activities may fall under the Quality Assurance department’s line of responsi-
bility, they may require the assistance (or resources) of others in the organization that
might not normally be involved in the project.
Who is Paying for this Project?
The person paying for the project is clearly a stakeholder.The project might be
funded by a client, by a potential client, by a government grant, or by the company
(internally, through a departmental or project budget). Regardless of how the project
is being funded, someone is going to have to approve the budget and/or project
expenditures and that person or group has a vested interest in the outcome of the
project. Sometimes project managers forget to take into account the person writing
the check unless that person is the project sponsor or part of the user group.This is
why we discussed aligning IT projects with corporate objectives earlier in the book.
If the IT project is aligned, this stakeholder’s needs are likely to be addressed. If the
IT project is not aligned, you’re probably going to have to spend time addressing this
stakeholder’s needs in terms of making the business case for the IT project and
explaining why the project should be funded and what value it adds.
www.syngress.com
Organizing IT Projects • Chapter 6
223

Who is Approving this Project?
Usually the person(s) paying for the project also approves the project, but not always.
Make sure you know who will be approving not only the overall project plan and
who will be giving the project the green light, but also know who will be approving
the project’s deliverables.The project plan may be approved by the project sponsor
and the deliverables may be approved by the user, but there may be others such as
corporate executives, steering committees, and governmental agencies that may be
involved with various project approval points.
Who is Delivering or Implementing this Project?
The delivery or implementation may be part of your project or it might not be.You
should be clear about who is delivering or implementing the project.An example of
this might be that the software group develops the software, but the client services
division actually installs and supports the software installation on the client side. If
that’s the case, you’d want to make sure your client service’s key personnel are in the
loop on this project so you can ensure that their installation and support needs are
also met by this project. Delivering a software project that no one can install, imple-
ment, or use would be pointless.
Who Needs to be Trained?
IT staff rarely deliver training themselves (unless training is part of the IT function in
your company) and as such, user training often is neglected.Asking who needs to be
trained will help you identify training needs and make plans to address those needs.
Sometimes you need to train project staff in a new technology, technique, or process.
Sometimes users need to be trained. Even if it is outside the scope of the project, if
someone needs to be trained, you’ve identiﬁed another stakeholder (the training
department) and you can incorporate this information into your project plan
accordingly. Often this is a simple step of adding a task to the project to contact the
training department at a certain point to allow them to become familiar with the
product or process and develop training materials, etc..
Who Else Should We Talk to About 
this Project (What Else Do We Need to Know)?
Asking “What else do we need to know?” can also lead you to additional stake-
holders. If you’re tasked with updating the payroll system, you may decide you want
to map out or understand the current payroll process and to understand the current
limitations. While some or all of this may have been discovered or discussed during
www.syngress.com

Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

your initial project discussions (Chapter 5), it’s also possible you’ll need additional
information. Perhaps you’ve talked with the payroll staff, but you haven’t talked with
Human Resources staff who interact with payroll and with corporate employees.
Perhaps you need to get input from an outside expert such as an attorney, CPA, or
consultant before you have all the needed data.There may be legal, ﬁnancial, or
security requirements that necessitate consulting an expert (Sarbanes-Oxley ﬁnancial
data requirements, HIPAA (health care data) or other data security requirements.
These are examples of situations that may require notiﬁcation or inclusion of people
you might not normally think of.
You might be thinking that if you ask and answer all these questions, you’re
going to have about 15,000 stakeholders on your list.Yes and no.Yes, you may gen-
erate a long list; but no, you don’t have to accept input from every single stakeholder
to the same degree.The point of this exercise is to ﬁnd out as much as you can
about who may be a stakeholder and then develop a strategy for managing stake-
holders of various kinds.
Prioritizing or Categorizing Stakeholders
It would be impossible for us to speciﬁcally deﬁne the stakeholders for your projects,
but we have deﬁned three of the high-level stakeholders. Some stakeholders should
help make key decisions, others may be needed from time to time or may need to
be kept in the loop, and still others may just need to know about the project. We’re
purposely using the term stakeholder loosely here to ensure you notify and involve
the right people in the project early on. How you deal with this list you’ve gener-
ated depends largely on the types of stakeholders you’ve identiﬁed and on the nature
of your project. We can divide stakeholders into three categories. If you identify a
fourth or ﬁfth category speciﬁc to your company, project, or situation, that’s ﬁne.
The key is to categorize your stakeholders so you can better manage expectations
and requirements.The three categories we’ll discuss are inﬂuential, involved, and
informed.
Inﬂuential 
Inﬂuential stakeholders are those that are key or critical to the project and they inﬂu-
ence the content, deliverables, and acceptance of the project.These stakeholders typi-
cally include users of the project’s deliverables as well as the project sponsor and the
person or group funding the project.These are people whose input and approval is
critical to the success of the project and these are the folks you’re going to work
closely with to ensure your project meets or exceeds expectations. In fact, these are
the folks with whom you’ll be setting (negotiating) expectations and who will help
you develop acceptance criteria for the ﬁnal project deliverables.
www.syngress.com
Organizing IT Projects • Chapter 6
225

Involved
The stakeholders in this category need to be involved to one degree or another.This
might include staff from Training, Human Resources, Sales, Marketing, or other
departments that may need to be involved with the project from time to time or who
may need to gear up to do work related to the project’s deliverables once the project
is complete. For instance, if a new product is going to market, the Marketing depart-
ment should be brought into the loop to allow them adequate time to prepare mar-
keting materials to get the new product to market. Of course, in some cases, the
Marketing department might be part of the inﬂuential group if they are providing
input on what users need and therefore will inﬂuence the actual project deliverables.
The Training group may need to be brought into the picture 60 days before the
product is released in order to give them time to develop training content and
schedules.They don’t inﬂuence the actual project, but they need to be involved at
some point.
Informed
The last category of stakeholder includes those who need to be informed from time
to time about the project. If your company is going to implement a new network
infrastructure that will be relatively transparent to users, but that will cause down-
time at certain points, you’d want to keep users informed of that. If the Sales depart-
ment has a huge client presentation they’re preparing and the network servers are
down, that’s a major problem.Typically, the informed group needs to be informed of
top-level information such as key dates, milestones, or activities. If the network
servers will be down from Friday 6:00 P.M. through Sunday at midnight, letting users
know this a few weeks before can help avoid all those last minute, frantic help desk
calls asking for assistance in preparing for the network outage, for example.
Stakeholders in this group might also be corporate executives for whom you must
prepare periodic progress reports.They want to know the project is succeeding, but
they don’t need (or want) to know the project details.Typically, people in this cate-
gory are included via various communications plans, which we’ll discuss in more
detail later.
www.syngress.com
226
Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Users or customers are those who utilize or employ the deliverables of
the project, while stakeholders are those who directly or indirectly
impact or are impacted by the project (users are also stakeholders, but
not all stakeholders are users). You may wish to develop a different set
of criteria for categorizing your stakeholders, but it’s important to orga-
nize them in a clear and accurate manner. This will make planning and
managing the project much easier because large segments of work such
as communications plans can be targeted to speciﬁc groups of stake-
holders. This will help reduce the amount of work (or redundant work)
you have to do and will also help you avoid omitting or overlooking a
key contingent.
Managing Stakeholder Expectations
Once you’ve identiﬁed and categorized your stakeholders, you will also have to
create plans for managing stakeholder expectations.This may sound bigger or more
cumbersome than it really is. Stakeholders in the inﬂuential category are those you’re
going to have to work closely with on many aspects of your project. It’s fair to say
that these are the most important stakeholders for you to manage because it is
within this group that your project’s deﬁnitions of speciﬁcations, requirements and
success will come (hint: these stakeholders may provide all this, but it’s your job as
IT project manager to negotiate ﬁnal speciﬁcations). Scope, time, budget, and quality
are all impacted by the expectations, demands, requirements, and needs of this group.
The stakeholders in the involved and informed groups typically will be much easier
to manage because they are not as key to the project’s success.Those in the involved
group will need to be managed to a lesser degree than those in the inﬂuential group,
but it will still be important to develop strong lines of communication and to
develop a common understanding of processes and procedures. For example, the
Training department needs to be involved at some point, so you’ll need to provide
them with a method of gaining needed information and expertise so they can
develop training materials.This might mean you have to get one of your software
developers to commit to spending four hours with one of their trainers to transfer
that knowledge at some point during the later stages of the project. Managing the
Training department’s expectations about what they can expect from your project
and when they can expect it will keep everyone calm, cool, and collected as things
heat up in the midst of the project.
www.syngress.com
Organizing IT Projects • Chapter 6
227

The stakeholders in the informed group usually just need to be kept in the loop
about events that may impact them or top-level accomplishments. It’s usually easiest
to create communications plans for each stakeholder group within this category. For
instance, corporate staff probably don’t need a monthly report on project progress
(unless you’re doing some major in-house PR to gain support for the change that
the project will create), but they will need to know about events that will impact
them, such as network outages, new logon procedures, etc.. On the other hand, cor-
porate executives need to know about events that will impact them as well as project
progress, so you’ll need to create a communication strategy unique to this group.
We’ll talk more about all of this later in the book.
You can see that identifying stakeholders is a bit more involved than you might
at ﬁrst have thought, but it’s not a difﬁcult task. When you take time to identify and
categorize your stakeholders, your project plan can incorporate plans (or tasks) that
provide for the needs of the various stakeholders. It’s much easier and faster to take a
few minutes to map out your stakeholders now than to overlook at key group and
ﬁnd out later on.

Avoid the Doh! Factor
The Matt Groening character, Homer Simpson, is famous for exclaiming “Doh!”
whenever he discovers an error (well, he uses it for a lot of things, that being one
of them). One of the things most IT project managers absolutely hate is that
moment when they discover an error or omission that could have (and should
have) avoided, causing them that awful Doh! moment. Avoid overlooking any
important individuals or groups by taking a few minutes to ask and answer the
questions in the previous section. It will help you identify all potential stake-
holders. Then take another few minutes to categorize stakeholders to assist you
in creating plans for interacting effectively with the various stakeholders. Here’s
a tip: when you’re talking with the stakeholders you’ve identiﬁed, take a moment
to ask them who else needs to know. You might be surprised by their answers
and relieved that they helped you avoid overlooking an individual or group that
is important to the project’s success. Asking, “Who else should I be talking to?”
helps you avoid the Doh! factor later on.

Figure 6.4 Project Stakeholders
Identifying Project Requirements
Let’s start with the most basic statement about your IT project’s requirements.The
deﬁnition of requirements is “something that is obligatory or demanded; something
that is needed for a particular purpose.” Requirements are what someone is going to
hold you accountable for delivering through your IT project.That someone is the key
here because projects have various stakeholders.As you just learned, stakeholders are
those people who have a vested interest (of one type or another) in the project. For
instance, users, corporate executives, and the project sponsor are common stake-
holders.As you talk with stakeholders, your requirements will begin to form.As you
begin to deﬁne your requirements, you may identify additional stakeholders.
If the project does not meet user requirements, the project is, fundamentally, a
failure. Keep in mind that users are deﬁned as those people who use or rely upon the
results of your project; so the project must meet their needs, or it’s a failure by deﬁni-
tion. It’s important to learn to listen effectively when talking with users (we’re
deﬁning users here as those who will use the result of the project).The project should
be solving the user’s problem(s), which is not always the problem you think the pro-
ject should solve. Keep that in mind as you develop project requirements.There’s a
story about a police mobile radio project where the police say there’s a problem with
the radio.The engineers look over the radio and the specs and ﬁnd nothing wrong.
They talk to a police ofﬁcer who says,“The problem is that when I hit a suspect with
the radio, it breaks and then I can’t call for backup.” Clearly, the mobile radio was not
designed to withstand impact, but that was the reality of the situation. Sometimes
when the police were caught off-guard and had nothing else handy, they’d use the
radio handpiece to subdue a suspect and it would break, making it impossible for the

ofﬁcer to then call for backup.The manufacturer changed the specs for the handpiece
so it could withstand greater impact. Regardless of your opinion about the use of the
radio handpiece as a weapon of self-defense, the point is that the radio project had
not fully taken into account the users’ real-life application.The result of the project
(the original mobile radio) did not meet users needs and was seen as a problem by
the users.As you develop user requirements, try to suspend judgment until you fully
understand the user’s needs and expectations. Only then can you begin to develop
requirements that meet user and business needs.
The IT Factor…
Square One: User Requirements
You might think that if you deliver a project on time and on budget that you’ve
got a winner on your hands. Not necessarily. If the project does not meet user
requirements, you’ve just spent a lot of time and money solving the wrong
problem. When you’re deﬁning the project, the users (those who will utilize the
project’s deliverables) should be kept foremost in your mind. If not, your project
may completely miss the mark. Then you’ll have angry users/clients, a poor repu-
tation, missed opportunities, and lots of wasted effort and dollars. A successful
project is one that is perceived as successful by users, not one that simply meets
the metrics and fails to deliver on user requirements.
User requirements are not the only requirements a project has.Think of a situa-
tion with which many of you are familiar—the project in which users continually
request/demand new features and functionality, even while the project is in progress
(also known as scope creep). Hypothetically, you could spend millions of dollars and
thousands of hours trying to meet changing or evolving user requirements and put
your company out of business in the process.You have to balance the needs of the
company, the market, and the users to ﬁnd the right set of project requirements.
Simply meeting user requirements is not adequate, but meeting corporate require-
ments such as proﬁtability or time-to-market without fulﬁlling user requirements is a
waste of time.You might think that we’re talking in circles here, but we’re not.The
key is to identify and work with stakeholders to deﬁne the optimal set of project
requirements. It’s often helpful to differentiate between must-have and would-like-to-
have requirements because users’ wish lists can get rather long. Identify the must-
haves as deliverables and keep the would-like-to-haves as optional components
www.syngress.com

(sometimes you can include several desirable features along with a required feature
with no extra effort).The two key groups you’ll need to work with are the users and
the project sponsor because we’re assuming the project sponsor’s requirements reﬂect
those of the corporation, which include ﬁnancial, timeline, and market requirements.
The key is to deﬁne requirements as quickly and as efﬁciently as possible and then
generate a list of requirements that are manageable and measurable. Figure 6.5 shows
the iterative process you can use to gather and reﬁne project requirements.

Let’s take a look at each of the steps involved.Again, if you’re not a fan of
ﬂowcharts, you can read through the following text and gain the same understanding
of the process.
1.
Gather stakeholder and project sponsor requirements. We’re assuming that the
stakeholders are those who depend upon or will use the project’s deliver-
ables.Though we’ve identiﬁed three categories of stakeholders earlier, you
don’t necessarily need to involve everyone in this process.Typically, you
involve the inﬂuential groups and perhaps key members of the involved
group. Don’t include any more than the bare necessity or you may end up
with a large, unmanageable group that may never come to agreement.
We’re also assuming the project sponsor represents other key stakeholder
interests such as executive or corporate requirements (proﬁtability, time to
market, etc.).The ﬁrst step is to bring the approved project proposal to
these stakeholders and gather a list of requirements.You may have to help
user groups in identifying requirements, but avoid unduly inﬂuencing this
group at this time.The optimal solution is an extensive list you can hone
down to help you deliver a useful project.
2.
Compile stakeholder requirements. Compile all requirements so the project
team can evaluate and discuss these requirements in an efﬁcient, complete
manner. Identify required versus optional elements (must-haves versus
would-like-to-haves) so you don’t get bogged down in unnecessary
requirements.
3.
Review, evaluate, and select requirements.The project team should review and
evaluate all project requirements. Begin with creating evaluation criteria
that will help all team members make decisions based on the same factors.
Also keep in mind that user requirements are sometimes “out in left ﬁeld”
if they don’t understand the nature or scope of the project.You don’t have
to (necessarily) accept all user requirements, but you will have to defend
your decisions, so make sure you are using clear, sound criteria for your
decisions. Obviously, these criteria should be based on the elements already
present in your project proposal including problem, mission, solution, target
scope, timeline and budget.
Once you’ve evaluated and sorted through all stakeholder and project
sponsor inputs with the team, ﬁnalize the list of requirements you believe
can be delivered in this project. Remember the four criteria we used in
Chapter 2? They are logical, feasible, desirable, and affordable.Those can be used
here as well.Are the proposed requirements logical? Are they feasible? Are
they desirable? Are they affordable? While these won’t be the only criteria
www.syngress.com
232
Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

you use, they can be helpful when deciding from among many choices.
Also keep in mind that you and your project team likely have skills and
expertise your users don’t, which means you often have a better (or more
realistic) view of what is feasible and what is not given a target scope, cost,
time, and quality requirement.This is where your negotiation skills come in
handy because you may have to educate or persuade your users to accept
what is realistic rather than what they’d like in a perfect world.
For requirements that don’t meet the criteria you’ve established, you
should decide whether these requirements should be put on hold (for fur-
ther discussion, input, or future projects) or rejected for this project.
Remember, none of this is etched in stone, but you don’t want to revisit
these decisions over and over again either. Place requirements either in the
rejected or on hold category and be prepared to explain, negotiate, and justify
your decisions to the stakeholders. Remember that the stakeholders are, by
deﬁnition, the ones that will use or rely upon the outcome(s) of the pro-
ject, so if you can’t persuasively make your case for nixing these require-
ments, you may end up with a project that either fails to meet stakeholder
expectations or is all over the map in terms of deliverables (too conﬁned or
too broad). Neither is a good place to land.
Also in this step, you should gather all requirements that require further
discussion, negotiation, or input from stakeholders and set a time to discuss
these with stakeholders. When possible, ask very speciﬁc, closed-ended
questions during this process.An example of a closed-ended question is,
“How exactly do you use the toolbar in this application to ﬁnd customer
records?”This leads to a speciﬁc answer.An open-ended question invites
further input, which at this point could lead you into an endless loop of
additional requirements being added at each iteration.An example of an
open-ended question in this case is,“What else do you need when ﬁnding
customer records?”You may want this type of input and if so, ask away.
However, if you got that information from the stakeholder during the ﬁrst
round of requirements gathering, asking again may yield different answers
based on “wish lists” or a poor understanding of the IT process rather than
answers based on what the stakeholder needs.This is a judgment call, but
ask your questions with the end in mind so you don’t invite a free-for-all
discussion.

Organizing IT Projects • Chapter 6
233

4.
Deﬁne primary and derived requirements.The primary requirements are those that
were gathered from the stakeholders and agreed to by the project team,
whether from the initial discussion or from subsequent clarifying discus-
sions.The derived requirements are those that come from the primary require-
ments. For instance, a primary requirement might be data security and a
derived requirement would be the storage of data in an encrypted format.
You don’t necessarily want to get into the detail of how you’re going to ful-
ﬁll these requirements at this point, though there are times you might do
that. For instance, if you know your data has to be encrypted and you’re
going to use the standard ﬁle encryption used in Windows Server 2003,
you can add that to the requirements.Add derived requirements (even if
they describe how) if they are clear, concise requirements for the project
and stem from the primary requirements.
5.
Proposed project requirements.This is a document that should describe the pro-
posed ﬁnal project requirements. It’s important to gain stakeholder agree-
ment on this because this is what your project will deliver when it’s all said
and done. If you don’t have agreement at this stage, you will likely run into
scope creep, changing user requirements, and dissatisﬁed stakeholders
during the project (you may run into those anyway, but at least you’ll be
doing what you can to avoid these pitfalls). If the stakeholders do not agree
to these requirements, you’ll have to go through another iteration of this
process. While it might irk you to have to do so, keep these things in mind:
ﬁrst, business and markets change quickly and it’s entirely possible some
new data has come to light that should be included. It could be this addi-
tion makes your project far better than it otherwise would have been.
Second, if you miss a key requirement (even if it’s the fault of the stake-
holder), it’s better to know it earlier than later.You can incorporate addi-
tional or modiﬁed data at this point far more easily than you can once the
project is underway. So, while you might cringe at the thought of another
go-round in this process, keep the end result in mind—a successful project
that you can be proud of. In Chapter 9, we’ll discuss developing technical
and functional requirements in detail and we’ll look at the three rules of
requirements: deﬁned, discrete, and measurable.
6.
Modify or codify. If the proposed project requirements need further modiﬁ-
cation based on stakeholder needs, you’ll have to go through steps 1
through 4 again.This time it should be shorter, but make sure you look at
the proposed modiﬁcations alongside your current proposed requirements
list.Avoid revisiting the same issues over and over and also try to recognize
www.syngress.com
234
Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

related issues. For instance, you might have a requirement for data security
and a stakeholder wants to discuss user logins.These may be related and it
might only take a modiﬁcation or clariﬁcation to a current requirement
rather than an entire review of requirements. If changes are made, check
back with your original requirements to ensure you haven’t inadvertently
created a conﬂict (“add security, don’t add security…”)
If the stakeholders agree, you should have them ofﬁcially and formally
sign off on this document (in whatever manner is appropriate to your orga-
nization).You may have to revisit these agreements later on and it’s good to
have this in black and white.Your job as IT project manager is to ensure
that your project is meeting stakeholder needs and that your project is posi-
tioned for success.That means that not only do you have to lead negotia-
tions on requirements, but you have to educate stakeholders about the
process.You don’t need to go into tremendous detail on how the whole
thing works, but you should make it very clear to stakeholders that once
requirements are agreed upon, it should take a major event to modify the
requirements.You can help them understand this by explaining (brieﬂy)
how you create and manage the project plan as well as how changing
requirements will impact scope, time, budget, and quality.You can also dis-
cuss with them your change control process so that if they do request
changes later, they’ll understand there is a formal process for doing so. It
might not completely prevent changes to requirements down the road, but
you can try to nip it in the bud. Later in this book, we’ll discuss change
management so you don’t get run over by changing demands.
We keep saying IT project management is an iterative process and here’s a great
example.You now have this wonderful list of user requirements.The question is, how
have these requirements impacted your original estimate for scope, time, cost, or
quality? Has the scope increased (or decreased) signiﬁcantly? Has the amount of time
required to deliver on these requirements changed? Most often, you’ll ﬁnd that things
have expanded. If so, you’ll have to adjust something. Remember, there is a relation-
ship between scope, time, cost, and quality and if you modify one, something else has
to change as well. If you increase the scope, you have to increase the time or cost or
reduce the quality.Also, if something has changed, it’s much easier to go back now and
request more time or money (the two most common requests) because you now have
a concise list of requirements rather than a more intangible “project concept.”

The IT Factor…
Project Requirements Are Like A Healthy Breakfast
A project will get off to a much better start if you make a concerted effort to gather,
manage, analyze, and document your project requirements. This is an often-
skipped step that really is the foundation of a solid project for several reasons. First,
if you know what your project must deliver, you clearly have a better chance of
delivering it. Second, if you are clear about the project requirements, you can avoid
(or minimize) scope creep later on. You will certainly have to negotiate, and that
sometimes means taking some of the requirements and putting them on hold for
a later revision or a separate project. The third reason is that a formalized list of pro-
ject requirements that the stakeholders all agree to will help manage expectations
(“Hey, I thought you agreed to include…”) and increase stakeholder satisfaction
later (no surprises, no gaps = happier stakeholders). While gathering requirements
won’t guarantee project success, it will certainly get it off on the right foot. And
the opposite is also true—without doing a thorough job gathering requirements,
your project has a slim chance for success. You might like pie for breakfast, but you
also know it’s not the best way to start the day.
Managing Requirements
The reason you gather requirements before you even get into the task planning stage
is that the later in the project process changes are made, the more expensive they
become. If you recall our discussion from Chapter 1, you know that an estimated
50% - 70% of the total cost of any project is due to errors, omissions and rework.
Sound familiar? By doing a thorough job on the requirements gathering and by
gaining critical agreement for the project’s requirements, you can reduce the cost of
your project simply by avoiding some errors, omissions, or rework.You won’t avoid
all of them, but any reduction at this point is a good thing and will translate to the
bottom line.
Timing Issues
Another important thing to keep in mind as you’re developing your requirements is
that you will almost never have 100% certainty as to the project’s scope, require-
ments, etc..You may feel conﬁdent, you may feel certain, but you may never feel like
you have everything in place to move forward.That thinking style is common in the
analyst work style we discussed in Chapter 4.These kinds of people often allow
www.syngress.com
236
Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

uncertainty to stop forward progress.At some point, you have to ﬁsh or cut bait, so if
you (or members of your team) have a tendency to wait for additional data before
proceeding, you’re going to have to manage this tendency. In business, there is rarely
a perfect moment when you have 100% of the information you need to make a
decision or to move forward. Some people use an 80% metric—if you have about
80% of what you need, you can proceed. Waiting for perfect data can cause analysis
paralysis and cause your project to sit in idle too long (or forever).
The ﬂip side to that argument is that there are also times when it’s best to wait.
We can all think of situations where, in retrospect, we realize that if we’d waited we
would have had a better outcome.This is typical for people in the doer category dis-
cussed in Chapter 4.These folks tend to jump in and get things going and if they
plan at all, it’s often after the fact (the popular “ready, ﬁre, aim” technique).These
folks probably have the most experience with the feeling of “if only I had waited a
day or two.” Sometimes data does evolve or come to light more slowly than we’d
like.You’ll need to ﬁnd a balance between waiting for perfect data, which may never
come, and jumping in too quickly without all the necessary information. Sometimes
only hindsight will tell you if you made the right decision, but if you’re cognizant of
these two extremes, there’s a good chance you’ll ﬁnd an acceptable balance.
Change Management Issues
We’ll discuss this in more detail later, but this is a good place to introduce the con-
cept of change management. We mentioned this brieﬂy earlier in this section, but it
bears repeating. Once you have agreement on the requirements, you should educate
your stakeholders about the change management process. If you haven’t yet devel-
oped your project processes (discussed later in this chapter), you can discuss the
change management process in general terms. Stakeholders must understand the
impact of change on a project. If you recall that scope is a function of time, cost, and
quality, then you can help your stakeholders understand that if they increase the
scope, something else will have to change to accommodate that increase. If they
understand that the elements are interdependent, they can understand the implica-
tions of the changes they are requesting. While you may not always win, you will be
better positioned to explain how requested changes will impact the project.
Sometimes those changes will require that already-completed work will have to be
scrapped. Other times it means those changes will delay other parts of the project.
Sometimes requested changes are so signiﬁcant they completely change the nature of
the project.As the IT project manager, your job is to help stakeholders understand
the impact their requested changes may have on a project and help the key people
make decisions about how to proceed. Often these decisions are not yours to make,
www.syngress.com
Organizing IT Projects • Chapter 6
237

but you must facilitate the process of making smart, savvy decisions for the project
IT department and for the business.
A long series of small changes can be as devastating to a project as one or two
major changes, so don’t allow small changes to be made to the requirements outside
of the formal change management process. Educate both your stakeholders and your
project team that the only changes made to project requirements are those that go
through the formal change management or change control process.This helps you
avoid situations where a casual conversation over coffee or after a meeting between a
stakeholder and a project team member results in several changes being made on the
ﬂy. While both parties might think these changes are small and insigniﬁcant, they
often can and do have a major ripple effect.
Categories of Requirements
Before we leave the topic of requirements, let’s brieﬂy talk about different kinds of
requirements. It’s possible that even after discussions with stakeholders and the pro-
ject sponsor that there are additional requirements needed for the project.This is
where your expertise and the expertise of the team come in handy. For instance,
there are numerous examples of projects that may have legal, ﬁnancial, regulatory, or
technical requirements.Though we’ll deal with project speciﬁcations separately,
requirements might include such things as compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley (ﬁnan-
cial) or HIPAA (health care) regulations. Hopefully, one of your stakeholders has
brought these to your attention, but this is a good time to step back and look for
other requirements that have not yet been included. If you ﬁnd any of these kinds of
requirements, you should bring them back to your stakeholders for formal approval.
This will ensure that you’re not introducing complexity where none is needed, but
also helps ensure the ﬁnal project will meet all requirements. For instance, it’s pos-
sible (though unlikely) that stakeholders and a project sponsor neglect to mention
the requirement for HIPAA compliance in the software solution you’re discussing.
Perhaps they all assumed it was known because to them it was so obvious that they
failed to mention it. If you discover requirements after the fact, go back through the
process to gain formal approval for additional requirements. We won’t cover all pos-
sible categories, but this list should get you started in your discovery process. Keep in
mind that requirements are not speciﬁcations.To use a very tangible example, a
requirement might be,“The car must stop within 60 feet of the application of the
brake when traveling at 30 mph.”A speciﬁcation might be the thickness of the brake
pads or the viscosity of brake ﬂuid that will be used to meet the requirement(s).
We’ll discuss speciﬁcations later on. We’ll also discuss functional and technical
requirements in more detail in Chapter 9.

User Requirements
User requirements are often synonymous with stakeholder requirements since users
are deﬁned as those who will utilize the deliverables of the project. However, it
never hurts to list user requirements so they’re not forgotten.A good example of
when user requirements are not part of stakeholder requirements is when corporate
executives decide that the entire network infrastructure of the company should be
upgraded and managed by a third-party company.The project that will make this
happen may not take into account the front-line users who may have speciﬁc needs
in terms of infrastructure. Perhaps users need wireless access or a simpler logon pro-
cess.These may not initially be part of the stakeholder or project sponsor require-
ments, but they certainly come into play when planning the project.
Business Requirements
Clearly the project sponsor is the one who should be representing the business inter-
ests of the company, but there are times when that’s not the case. Ensuring business
requirements are met is an important element of your job as IT PM and whether
your project sponsor covers it or not, make sure these are included in your project.
Business requirements can also include legal, accounting, or other requirements that
must be met by this project.
Functional Requirements
In Chapter 9, we’ll discuss functional requirements in more detail, and at this point
in your project planning process, you don’t necessarily need to dig down into the
details of functional requirements.The requirements you deﬁne are likely to be func-
tional requirements because users (the typical majority stakeholder) often deﬁne pro-
ject requirements in terms of what they need the result to do.
Technical Requirements
Technical requirements are often derived requirements because they are based upon
the primary requirements set by the stakeholders. It’s possible, though unlikely, that
stakeholders will provide technical requirements. More often they’ll deﬁne functional
requirements (“we need it to do this”) and your project team may then identify
technical requirements from those. We’ll discuss this in more detail in Chapter 9

The IT Factor…
It’s All About the Requirements
Successful entrepreneur and business owner, Chris Landi of Tekwork.com and
BestJobsInTucson.com, is a ﬁrm believer in deﬁning requirements completely
before starting on project work. “If you deﬁne what the users need and what you
can deliver and get agreement on that, you usually end up with satisﬁed users
and a successful project,” says Landi. “If you don’t take time to agree on require-
ments, your project will miss the mark and your users will be dissatisﬁed. It’s hard
to recover from those kinds of mistakes.” As a successful business owner, Landi’s
best practices include clearly deﬁning user and business requirements and
gaining agreement on those before starting project work.
Figure 6.6 shows the result of this step is a list of all agreed upon requirements
and formal acceptance of these requirements. If the requirements are lengthy, they
can be referenced in the project plan and attached as a separate document, but ide-
ally the requirements should be clear, concise, and included in the body of the pro-
ject document. It’s possible you’ll need to develop more detailed requirements (both
functional and technical), but at this stage, high-level requirements should be stated
and agreed upon. Once you gain agreement on these, you can develop additional
detail and gather agreement on the next iteration, if needed.

Reﬁning Project Parameters 
So far, we’ve deﬁned the initial project and gotten approval to proceed (Chapter 5).
Then we took that initial project proposal and began to develop additional detail.At
this point, you should have a list of three to ﬁve major deliverables or objectives.You
should have identiﬁed and categorized your various stakeholders, and you should
have an initial list of requirements. We’ll continue to hone our project deﬁnition by
reﬁning the project parameters.A parameter is deﬁned as “a fact or circumstance that
restricts how something is done or what can be done.” In this case, then, project
parameters deﬁne what and how the project will be done. We’ll discuss common
project parameters used in IT projects in this section, but the list is not exhaustive.
It’s meant to cover the more commonly used elements, but you can certainly add to
this list as your company and project requirements dictate. Our list is as follows:
■
Success criteria
■
Acceptance criteria
■
Scope, cost, time, quality
■
Flexibility grid or list
■
Constraints and limitations
■
Risks
■
Milestones
■
Statement of work or project charter
Success Criteria
A study undertaken in the mid-1970’s on project management showed that some
projects meet their scope, time, cost, and quality metrics and are still considered fail-
ures. Other projects, by comparison, missed one or more of the scope, time, cost, or
quality metrics and were considered successful.The study attempted to understand
why this was the case.The results were published in 1974 and later summarized in a
1988 compilation [Baker, Murphy, Fisher “Factors Affecting Project Success” in
Project Management Handbook, Cleland and King, Eds., New York: Van Nostrand
Reinhold, 1988].The ﬁndings can be summarized by this statement:
If the project meets technical performance speciﬁcations and/or
user expectations and if there is a high level of satisfaction with the
results of the project by key people in the organization, the project
www.syngress.com
Organizing IT Projects • Chapter 6
241

is considered a success. The key people in the organization include
the company, the client, the project team and the user.
At ﬁrst glance, you might think this all seems a bit obvious, but let’s look a bit
closer at this. If the project meets technical performance speciﬁcations and stake-
holders (key people) are happy, the project is considered a success.This means that the
project may have run over budget or past its deadline. It may have not included all
the functionality (scope) or it may not meet all the technical speciﬁcations (quality).
Still, it’s considered a success. Ultimately, if the project meets the needs and/or
expectations of key people, the project is considered a success. So, while IT project
managers often spend a lot of time managing the project’s metrics, especially time
and cost, there’s another element that, when well managed, can lead to the perception
of a more successful project.As the study results and the summary statement demon-
strate, success is, at least in part, a matter of perception. We’ve all experienced these
kinds of things. For instance, if you bring your car in for repair and the people who
greet you are courteous and efﬁcient, you’re more likely to think the car repair
facility is a quality shop.You’re not talking with the mechanics and ﬁnding out if
they’re certiﬁed or what type of experience they have to come up with your per-
ception; you’re basing it on how the greeter greeted you. Smart companies under-
stand that ﬁrst impressions create customer perceptions and that’s the ﬁrst place to
begin managing perceptions of quality and service.The same is true in IT project
management.You, as the IT project manager, are responsible for managing the per-
ception of the project with key people. Certainly you are also responsible for man-
aging the actual project’s deliverables, but it should be clear that even if you deliver
on all your requirements, the project may not be perceived as a success. Now that
you understand that you must manage the project and the perception of the project,
we’ll talk speciﬁcally about success criteria. One way to manage project perceptions
is through your communications, which we’ll discuss in a later chapter.
Deﬁning Success Criteria
Success criteria are the tangible criteria you’ll use to deﬁne what a successful project
is (and is not) and what it includes and excludes.The criteria from any and all of the
stakeholders should include elements that address scope, cost, time, and quality
whenever possible so that you can identify metrics for these four elements through
your success criteria.The questions you can use to deﬁne these criteria are:
1.
What criteria will the inﬂuential stakeholders (speciﬁcally the users) use to
determine if the project is a success?
2.
What criteria will the project sponsor use to determine if the project is 
a success?
www.syngress.com
242
Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

3.
What criteria will the company’s executives use to determine if the project is
a success?
4.
What criteria will the project team use to determine if the project is a 
success?
The inﬂuential stakeholders include other stakeholders on this list, but we’re
speciﬁcally talking about those who will utilize the results of this project.You gath-
ered user requirements and can use these as a starting point for deﬁning success cri-
teria with the user. Work with them to develop speciﬁc criteria they’ll use to
determine the success of the project.To some of you, this may sound like we’re
deﬁning acceptance criteria; they’re not always the same thing and we’ll discuss accep-
tance criteria in the next section.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Here’s a tip from expert Project Manager (and Tech Editor) Nels Hoenig:
Use your requirements list and your success criteria together for checks
and balances. If you have items listed as success criteria that are not mir-
rored in your requirements, something is wrong. Your requirements
should determine your success criteria and your success criteria should
mirror your requirements. When they match up, you know the project is
starting off well aligned. You may add success criteria as you further
reﬁne your functional or technical requirements in your planning process.
Once the project begins work, everything should be ﬁnalized and agreed
upon so there’s no guesswork about what needs to be accomplished.
You’ll also need to work with your project sponsor to identify the success criteria
he or she will use to determine if the project is a success.Typically the project sponsor
will represent the business’s objectives or priorities, but not always (which is why we’ll
also answer the next question in the list in a moment).As with your users, work with
your project sponsor to deﬁne speciﬁc criteria he or she will use to determine
whether or not your project is successful. If the project sponsor is very busy or not
inclined to participate in this process, you’ll have to proceed with caution.Although
you may well be able to come up with a list of success criteria for your sponsor to
review and approve, you run the risk of omitting some criteria that the sponsor ulti-
mately uses but never reveals. If possible, have a discussion with the project sponsor to
develop the success criteria and try to be as certain as possible that these actually are
the criteria the project sponsor will use at the end of the project.

The success criteria used by corporate executives may or may not be the same as
those used by the project sponsor. However, corporate executives are typically
looking at the bigger picture, so the business case you made for this project will be
helpful in developing the executive success criteria. Since corporate individuals are
often the ones approving the budget expenditures for the project, they often have
ﬁnancial metrics by which they’ll judge the success of the project. However, ﬁnancial
metrics are not the only metrics they may use. For instance, time to market or
addressing a particular market niche might be part of their criteria.These may
overlap with or even conﬂict with user success criteria, so you may have to do some
negotiating.
Here’s an example. If your project is to develop a software application add-on that
addresses a particular need in the market, your users might say,“It will be successful if
it includes the ability to generate reports quickly and easily.” Based on initial research,
you know that to do this will take a minimum of three months of development.Your
corporate folks know that there is increasing competition in this market niche and
want to get their foot in the door as soon as possible. In fact, they want the product
out the door in 30 days and they don’t really care if it can generate reports quickly
and easily because they see that functionality as a secondary requirement. Now you, as
the IT project manager, have to determine how to get everyone on the same page.
You can’t very well negotiate with the user group, which in this case is a new target
set of users out in the world.You can’t very well negotiate with the corporate folks
who absolutely insist the project get out the door in 30 days.You may come up with
some creative ideas, but one of the more obvious ones is to deliver the project in two
parts and have your marketing folks make that clear to the market. For instance, you
could deliver the initial set of functionality in the 30-day timeline and follow up with
the reporting functionality within 60 days.While it might be possible to convince the
corporate folks that they should wait 90 days and go in “with both feet” you might
not win that battle. If you deliver in 30 days, the corporate folks might initially be
happy, but will quickly realize that without the reporting functionality, the users are
not happy. If you deliver in 90 days, the users may be pleased with the functionality,
but your corporate folks will not only hound you for 60 days, but they may view the
project as a failure. It’s also possible that if you get the product out the door in 90
days, the market may have already been grabbed by your competitor, who got a com-
peting product into the marketplace in 45 days.
The point is that you should not second-guess your target users or your corpo-
rate executives, but you may have to work to ﬁnd a common area between two
competing sets of demands.And ultimately, the corporate executives pay your salary,
so if they say 30 days, that’s what you’re going to have to shoot for. Clearly, in this
case we’re talking about scope and timelines along with success criteria, but these
www.syngress.com

Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

things all come into play. If a project is delivered with reduced scope, it doesn’t nec-
essarily mean it will be perceived as a failure. If a project is delivered within scope, it
doesn’t necessarily mean it will be perceived as a success. Using the skills and talents
you have as an IT project manager and those that you gained through understanding
and applying material from earlier chapters (navigating politics, working with diverse
groups of people, etc.), you should be able to deﬁne a common set of success criteria
that will allow you and your project team to deliver a project that all key stake-
holders deﬁne as successful. It might take some effort on your part, but deﬁning
these criteria now will help you make better decisions once the project is underway.
The last set of success criteria are those used by the IT project team itself.Talk
with the project team (if you haven’t yet deﬁned your ﬁnal project team, you may
have to revise this list later) to deﬁne success criteria.Again, there may be many areas
of overlap that correspond with user, project sponsor, or corporate success criteria,
but there may be a few additional items to add to your list.You might think that the
IT project team’s success criteria don’t really matter because they’re not the users nor
are they the sponsors of the project. However, their ability to perceive the project as
a success is important to achieving ﬁnal success because they must buy into the pro-
ject and make the effort to achieve success. Remember the phrase we’ve used
before: Projects don’t fail, people do. If the IT project team can’t deﬁne what success
in this project means, they may not be as committed to it and therefore the overall
success of the project may be in jeopardy. If the project team seems hard pressed to
come up with success criteria, you may guide them toward using the requirements
or the target scope, time, cost, and quality metrics as their success criteria.
Cheat Sheet…
Deﬁning Success
How do you know your project is successful when it’s all said and done? How
have you judged project success in the past? If you and your IT team were happy
with the results, did you assume everyone was? Deﬁning what a successful pro-
ject will look like is helpful because it not only gets everyone to agree what suc-
cess looks like, but it helps make the project’s success more tangible for team
members. If you know what you’re aiming for, you have a better chance of hit-
ting it. Deﬁne your success criteria and get appropriate buy-in.

Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria are similar to success criteria, but are narrower in focus.They are
typically used in technical projects though they can be used in many different kinds
of projects. Acceptance criteria deﬁne the speciﬁc circumstances under which the user
will accept the ﬁnal output of the project. In external technical projects, the accep-
tance criteria are often contractual obligations and are typically captured in a
Statement of Work document (discussed later in this chapter).The acceptance cri-
teria are certainly related to success criteria because the end user will be inﬂuential
in creating both.
Acceptance criteria should be speciﬁc, measurable, and binary. By binary, we mean
that the answer is either yes or no, there is no “maybe.” Either the criteria were met
or not.This helps avoid ambiguity as well as the “yes, but…” issues that arise when
trying to get a client to sign off on a project’s deliverables. Clients typically refuse to
sign off for one of two reasons: Either the project results really do not address their
needs or they are not clear what their needs are (there is a third and very unfortunate
reason some clients don’t sign off and that’s to avoid paying the bill, but we’re talking
about legitimate reasons here). By working to clearly deﬁne what it will take for
them to sign off on the project’s deliverables before you write one line of code or
install one router, you’ll be protecting yourself, your project team, and your com-
pany. If the client is internal, you’ll be avoiding political maneuvering and miscom-
munication.
Cheat Sheet…
Acceptance Criteria
Success criteria tell you what a successful project looks like and sometimes that’s
all you need. There are other times (depending on the nature of the IT project)
that you will also need acceptance criteria. As mentioned, these are typically used
on projects where a client is paying for deliverables or for completion of phases
of the project. In these cases, acceptance criteria can make the difference
between getting paid or not. Be clear that the acceptance criteria that are devel-
oped are clearly appropriate to the deliverable, are binary (either it is or is not
acceptable), are measurable or tangible (whenever possible), and tied to payment
(when appropriate). You’ll be very thankful later on to have a clear list of accep-
tance criteria to which the client (or user) agreed.

Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

Scope, Cost, Time, and Quality
As we discussed in Chapter 1, scope is a function or result of the budget (cost),
schedule (time), and quality (performance or adherence to speciﬁcation). Different
people describe this relationship using different analogies and they’re all essentially
saying the same thing. Some use a triangle whose legs are cost, time, and quality and
the area of the triangle is scope. Others use the image of a stool where the three legs
are cost, time, and quality and the seat of the stool is the scope. Whichever image or
analogy works best for you is ﬁne as long as you understand the relationship among
these various elements.As you continue to reﬁne your project, you’ll need to con-
tinue to reﬁne your estimates for scope, time, cost, and quality. When you ﬁnalize
your project plan and present it to your project sponsor for approval prior to starting
project work, you will have to commit to these metrics.As the IT project manager,
you’ll be held accountable for these elements and you’ll have to manage the project
in a manner that comes as close to delivering on all four elements as possible.
However, remember that perception has as much to do with project success as does
hitting your metrics, so spend time managing both metrics and perceptions when
the project is underway. In Chapter 9, when you create your work breakdown struc-
ture (WBS), you’ll gain a much clearer understanding of what it will take to com-
plete this project.At that point, you’ll be able to really clarify your scope, time, cost,
and quality commitments for the project.
Flexibility Grid or List
As you’re deﬁning and reﬁning your project proposal, you’ll need to come to an
understanding with your project sponsor about the nature of the relationship
between the elements of the project including scope, cost, time, and quality. In this
phase, you’ve reﬁned your estimates on these four elements and are beginning to
gather data that will ultimately help you pin down these four elements as part of
your success criteria. However, we all know that when something goes wrong in the
project, something’s got to give. Using the image of a triangle whose area is the pro-
ject’s scope, if you expand the scope, one or more legs of the triangle will have to
grow longer in order to keep the triangle a triangle. If you reduce the length of one
of the legs of the triangle, the area of the triangle grows smaller. So, if the project’s
time or budget is reduced, something else has to “give” in order to keep the triangle
in shape.This could mean that you reduce the quality and keep the scope relatively
unchanged or you drastically reduce the scope.There are many different scenarios,
but the point is simply this: things change and when they change, you need to know
what your priorities are to manage the change in the best possible manner.

A ﬂexibility grid or list can be used to describe how ﬂexible any one of the ele-
ments is in the equation.The point is not to give you wiggle room on your com-
mitments and deliverables, but to give you an agreed-upon priority list to use to
manage change to the project.
To develop the ﬂexibility grid, you should list the four elements: scope, cost,
time, and quality.Then, with your project sponsor, decide which of these elements is
least ﬂexible.That means that when the going gets rough, this element should remain
constant. If cost is the least ﬂexible, it means that you should manage all elements of
the project to keep the project within budget ﬁrst and foremost. Does that mean
you’re going to ignore the schedule? Of course not, but if cost is least ﬂexible, it
might mean that rather than running several overtime shifts to make up for the
(inevitable) project delays, you allow the project schedule to run longer or you put
another project on hold to free up extra staff to work on the project. Knowing the
cost is the most important, least ﬂexible parameter helps you make decisions that
support those priorities.
Each of the four elements should be rated: Least ﬂexible to most ﬂexible.You
may use a numbering system such as 1 = Least ﬂexible, 2= Less ﬂexible, 3=
Somewhat ﬂexible, 4= Most ﬂexible.Then, when you’re working on setting your
schedule, developing your budget, or deciding on your quality processes, you can
make decisions that map with organizational and project sponsor priorities. Figure
6.7 shows a sample grid you can use for rating and recording the agreed-upon ﬂexi-
bility of each element. Remember, the project sponsor ideally is the one who ok’s
your ﬂexibility grid because he or she is going to have to help you manage the per-
ception of the project throughout its lifecycle and perhaps negotiate on your behalf
with executives later on.

www.syngress.com

Your ﬂexibility list also comes in handy when you are deciding how much
effort, or precision, each planning stage requires. Ideally, you should expend more
effort (more precision or rigor) on those items that are least ﬂexible because they are
part of the project’s constraints. If time is least ﬂexible, you’re going to expend more
effort and be more precise in your scheduling than you might otherwise or you
might expend more effort with scheduling than on budgeting if cost is most ﬂexible.
This ﬂexibility list or grid helps both in your decision-making and your planning
efforts. It helps avoid instances when your project sponsor becomes upset because
you’re running over budget when you assumed the schedule was more important.
Clarifying these elements helps bring assumptions out into the open, and formal
agreement as to the priorities of these elements will help you deliver a project that
meets sponsor expectations and perceptions for success.
Precision or Rigor
The terms precision and rigor are often used in project management to indicate how
precisely or how rigorously you will work on any particular step of project planning.
This is directly related to ﬂexibility, so it’s included in this section. It stands to reason
that if one element is least ﬂexible, you must ensure that your project plan works
around that element to make sure you deliver on that element, at the minimum.
Certainly you want to deliver on all elements per your plan and agreements, but we all
know that things change and when they change you need to know where to focus. If
your IT project’s budget is the least ﬂexible element, then it stands to reason that you
and your IT project team are going to be very precise when it comes to developing
the budget.You’re going to spend more time and effort ensuring the components of
the budget are correct and that you can deliver on those commitments. If on that same
IT project your schedule is most ﬂexible, then you may choose to spend slightly less
effort on developing a precise schedule than on developing your budget.At ﬁrst you
might balk and think,“Shouldn’t I expend the effort to develop a highly accurate
budget and schedule?”Yes, you certainly should generate accurate metrics for your
project. However, if schedule is most ﬂexible, it’s highly likely that the schedule will
change as the project progresses and all that time spent creating an incredibly detailed
schedule will be wasted.This is one area in which rework can come into play.While
you want to create a realistic schedule, if that’s the element most likely to change, you
may want to only develop a precise schedule for near-term work and develop a less
precise schedule for work that comes later in the project.
Another element of precision or rigor is that if you’re doing a project that is
similar to one you’ve done many times, your level of precision or rigor may be less
than if it’s a brand-new project.You don’t need to expend as much time or effort on
www.syngress.com
Organizing IT Projects • Chapter 6
249

planning a project in which many of the variables are actually known. Conversely, if
you’re doing a brand-new type of project, one in which none of your IT team has
any previous experience, you will need to plan with far more precision (and prob-
ably also allow for more contingencies).Take, for example, the software company
that installs its enterprise product at new clients.The project team that is responsible
for client installations will develop a project plan for that client’s installation.
However, because this type of project has been undertaken many times in the past,
there are not deﬁned processes that will be used and the number of unknowns is rel-
atively small.You might argue that client installation is a process, not a project.
However, each client environment is new and unique and the deﬁnition of a project
is that it solves a unique problem.Thus, it falls into the project category even though
it relies upon many standardized processes.This is a situation in which your level of
precision and planning may be relatively “low” except for the areas that are unique
to the client.
There are no hard and fast rules about the level of precision or rigor in your
planning processes except to note that the less ﬂexible an element is, the more pre-
cise the planning must be and the more unknown an element is, the more rigorous
the planning should be. With time and experience, you’ll gain a strong sense of
which parts of the plan should be precisely planned and at what point.The point is
to avoid over-engineering parts of the plan and to reduce the amount of “wasted”
effort and rework later on wherever possible.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Flexibility is a concept some people struggle with because they think it
means “wiggle room.” Flexibility is important to deﬁne at this point
because you will have to make tradeoffs during the project and it’s
important to have clarity and understanding with your project sponsor
about how you’ll handle these decisions. This saves you time because
you won’t have to contact the project sponsor every time you need to
make a change or adjustment to the project. It also saves you from a
certain amount of armchair quarterbacking that may occur during or
after the project (“Why did you make that decision? You know we
agreed that …”). If you have your ﬂexibility grid approved by your pro-
ject sponsor, it leaves little question as to how you should prioritize the
inevitable changes and tradeoffs and it gives you backup in case your
project sponsor gets a case of amnesia later on.

Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

Constraints and Limitations
We’re still in the high-level deﬁning and organizing phase of our project, so we’re
not going to dig into detail on constraints and limitations at this time. However,
there may be some known constraints or limitations that you want to note in the
initial project plan.These constraints and limitations might be quite relevant to your
project sponsor and might be critical in a go/no go decision. For instance, if a con-
straint is that your IT staff is in the midst of a mission-critical project and key mem-
bers of the IT team will not be available for additional project work for some time
to come, the project sponsor may decide that this new project should be put on
hold, cancelled, or outsourced.
Another example is if you’re going to have to rewire part of your building as
part of the project and one of your stakeholders mentions that the company is
hosting several key clients for a week at some point during the project.You’ll prob-
ably want to keep this in mind as you move forward and note it as a high-level limi-
tation.These limitations and constraints will ultimately be tied to the tasks related to
rewiring the building, and they could have a huge impact on the project’s timeline
(and perhaps budget as well), particularly if they are not built into the project plan.
Again, avoid delving into tremendous detail at this point, but do make use of the
opportunity to make note of any relevant constraints or limitations you’re aware of
going into the project.
Risks
As with constraints and limitations, it’s also important to note risks to the project
that you’re aware of at this stage. Project risks can include internal and external risks
such as changing market demands, changing technology, changing personnel,
changing corporate priorities, and more. We’ll spend time later in our planning pro-
cess identifying risks and coming up with strategies to deal with these risks. For
now, you simply want to identify those risks about which you’re already aware.
Again, these may be highly relevant to the project sponsor who might decide that
these early risks are too signiﬁcant to even continue in the planning process. While
few IT project managers want to spend time deﬁning and organizing a project and
have it cancelled, now’s the time to do it if it’s going to happen.And if the project is
cancelled for good reason, you can feel good that you did your job, which is
deﬁning the project well enough that others (project sponsor, corporate executives)
can make intelligent, informed decisions about the project before project work gets
underway.

Milestones
Milestones are checkpoints set throughout the project to help monitor project
progress.They are, by deﬁnition, zero duration tasks (a task in the project plan that is
set to 0 days) in the project plan.They can be used for a number of different reasons.
For instance, milestones can be used to indicate a point at which you check on the
status of one phase of the project or to indicate the point at which external
resources or deliverables must be received or to indicate the point at which you
need to get project sponsor approval. We’ll develop milestones in our project later,
but there may be some high-level milestones you want to make a note of at this
time so they are not overlooked later.You should be able to deﬁne the ﬁnal mile-
stone at this point, as it determines when the project is ﬁnished and has accom-
plished all of its objectives. Further planning may mean the project ﬁnish date
moves, but you should have some idea of what that will be at this point in time.
Many people use milestones to indicate key deliverables. If that’s how you and
your IT project team use the term, that’s ﬁne as long as everyone has the same under-
standing of the deﬁnition of the word. Milestones that might be deﬁned at this point
are the deadlines for each of the major deliverables or objectives for your project.
While these may not be known at this point, there are times when milestones can be
set for the project during this phase.This will help you avoid missing them later when
you get into the details of planning.You can also create milestones without exact
dates to indicate major deliverables or events and assign speciﬁc dates to them later.
For instance, you might create a milestone for development work, another milestone
for testing, another milestone for quality assurance, and a ﬁnal milestone for delivery
to the client.These dates may not be known, but they are major markers in your pro-
ject plan and if they are known at this point, they can be added.
Statement of Work or Project Charter
It seems that every project management system uses slightly different terminology, so
you might ﬁnd that your company or your clients or vendors use terms like
Statement of Work or Project Charter to describe what we’re calling the Initial Project
Proposal. Whatever you want to call it, you should have a document that captures all
of the work you’ve done thus far on the project.This document captures the high-
level details of the project including the problem to be solved, the mission, the
selected solution, the major deliverables (objectives), and the initial estimate for
scope, time, cost, and quality.The document should also contain the project require-
ments as well as the success criteria and the acceptance criteria. Remember, all pro-
ject management (including IT project management) is an iterative process, so you
www.syngress.com
252
Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

may have to go back through some or all of these elements as you learn more about
the project. Each time you go back you should be reﬁning more than changing the
elements. If you ﬁnd you’re changing things rather than adding layers of additional
detail, it should cause you to stop for a moment and ask why things are changing. If
they are legitimate changes based on a greater understanding of the project, that’s
ﬁne, but if things are changing because key elements have changed, you’re aiming at
a moving target and your project is at risk. If things are changing at this point, either
the project environment (internal or external) has changed or you may have to
spend time going back through the deﬁnition phase to really nail down the initial
project statements (problem, mission, etc.).
The Statement of Work (SOW), Project Charter (PC) or Initial Project Proposal
(IPP) all capture the deﬁnition and initial organization of the project.This type of
document is typically used as a checkpoint to ensure the project is the right project
at the right time for the right reasons. Many IT project managers set a milestone in
their planning for both the development of the SOW, PC, or IPP and another mile-
stone for the approval of the document. Once the document (SOW, PC, IPP) is
approved, you have essentially entered into a contractual obligation.
You might be thinking that at this point you don’t have enough information to
agree to scope, time, cost, and quality metrics and you’d be right.At this point in the
process, you’re looking at high-level items.You should have enough information
based on the requirements and success criteria to determine the project’s scope.
While you may develop additional detail about the elements that comprise the scope
of work, it shouldn’t change signiﬁcantly after this point unless you’ve missed a
major chunk of work. However, you can’t reasonably know the schedule, cost, or
quality until you get further into the project.You should be able to provide target
estimates at this point (see Chapter 5 for estimating techniques) and most managers
would expect that. For instance, you may be able to determine, based on the require-
ments, that the project will take about 6 months.You can estimate this based on sim-
ilar projects you’ve done in the past.You might also know that you could be wrong
by a couple of months since you don’t have all the detail available yet.The data to
include in the SOW, PC, or IPP should indicate that—you could state that the initial
estimate is 6 months with a margin of error of 30%. Some managers may want you
to lock down these numbers at this point (and if you’re working with a client, they
may also press for this), but until you have more information about the project, it’s
hard to make a more precise estimate and you’ll have to use your business savvy to
explain why a more precise number cannot be guaranteed at this point.

Cheat Sheet…
Formal Statement of Work
Many companies use a formal statement of work document as the project con-
tract between the company and a client company. In these cases, it is usually a
formal, written document that is signed by both parties. Companies will have dif-
ferent required SOW elements, so you should conform to your company’s
requirements and use existing templates when possible. If your company doesn’t
have a formal SOW template or process, you can use the following list of ele-
ments as a starting point. As you can see, we’re developing the critical elements,
so if you develop your initial project proposal, you’ll have most of what you need
for a formal SOW. In many cases, the initial project proposal can be used in place
of a SOW. You can also head out to the web and ﬁnd examples and download-
able templates for SOWs.
SOW Elements:
1.
Background (reason for the project)
2.
Scope (work to be accomplished)
3.
Approach (Technical, quality, management approach, risk manage-
ment, change management and issue tracking)
4.
Deliverable Products
5.
Roles and Responsibilities (typically used when the project is for a
client)
6.
Time and Cost Estimates
7.
Risks and Mitigation

Appendices
When you’ve ﬁnished listing, deﬁning, gathering, and deﬁning all relevant pro-
ject parameters, they should be incorporated into your project plan. It’s a good idea
to run these by your stakeholders (if appropriate) and your project sponsor for a
formal review. Doing so helps you avoid omitting important data that will help your
project succeed. Figure 6.8 shows the document developed as a result of this part
organizing your project.

Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

Figure 6.8 Project Parameters
Deﬁning Project Infrastructure
There are two aspects to project infrastructure—the actual infrastructure components
such as an intranet, instant messaging, or e-mail and the structure of the project
itself, which includes the processes and procedures your project will use. We’ll discuss
infrastructure in terms of the physical, tangible components and we’ll discuss pro-
cesses and procedures in the next section.
If you recall from earlier discussions in the book, we talked about working with
a diverse project team.This diversity includes culture, geography, age, and gender, to
name a few. When you’re deﬁning your project’s infrastructure, you need to be cog-
nizant of the needs of your IT project team. We’ll talk about how to form that team
later in the book, so you may not be able to complete this segment until you’ve
identiﬁed your IT project team members. If they’ve already been identiﬁed, take a
moment to think about what technology, tools, or infrastructure might be most
helpful to the team. Do they need cell phones, wireless access, instant messaging, a
secure, shared website? Think about how you’ll run the project and which tools will
help you and the team be most efﬁcient. Clearly, you should look to leverage
existing assets ﬁrst such as laptops, computers, Internet access, cell phones, etc..
However, you should also step back and ask if those existing tools will be enough. If
team members need to share lots of documents as part of the project, you may want
to create a secure website that IT team members can access for downloading,
uploading, and sharing project documents rather than e-mailing them back and
forth. What kinds of hardware, software, network, Internet, and Web services will be
required by the project team?
Beyond technology, you should also think about some of the more mundane but
critical infrastructure elements. Do IT team members need ofﬁce space, conference

room space, visitor space, a testing lab, special furniture, a project ofﬁce, dedicated
ofﬁce equipment (fax, copier, chairs, desk, storage), or communications equipment? 
Again, if you have not yet formed your IT project team and are deﬁning and
organizing this project with a special team of experts that may or may not be
working on the project itself, you may have to revisit these requirements once you
have your IT project team. However, in many cases, you’ll be able to identify many
of the infrastructure needs.
Once you have this list, you’ll need to talk with your project sponsor. He or she
will need to approve these and provide (or provide access to) these resources. If any
of your infrastructure needs are new (to the company), you’ll have to take ownership
of getting these resources.That might mean working with your telecommunications
company to increase Internet bandwidth or provide high-speed access at several new
locations. It might mean you have to select and purchase new hardware, software, or
furniture. Whatever it is you need for the project and the sponsor has approved,
make sure you either get it yourself or delegate this task to someone reliable and
persistent. Of course, wait to purchase infrastructure components until your ﬁnal
project plan has been approved (or as close as possible) to avoid making large pur-
chases for a project that ultimately gets dropped. Figure 6.9 shows the results of this
step, which is a document outlining all infrastructure requirements (currently
known) and approval by the project sponsor indicating the ability to use, comman-
deer, or purchase necessary infrastructure components. Keep in mind that each of
the documents generated in each step can be compiled for approval by the sponsor
in one sitting when you submit the initial project plan to the sponsor. However,
some project sponsors are busy or may prefer to get these documents one by one, so
work with your sponsor to determine the best approach.

Deﬁning Project Processes
We’re heading down the home stretch here. Deﬁning the project’s processes and pro-
cedures is the ﬁnal step in this phase of our planning.To this point, you’ve identiﬁed
a tremendous amount of information about the project, and now it’s time to deﬁne
the project’s processes and procedures—how the project will run and how you’ll run
the project.
Cheat Sheet…
Processes, Procedures, and Stress
You already know that process for process’s sake is a waste of time, but when
processes (and procedures) make sense, they’re priceless. A renowned exercise
physiologist, Michael Hewitt, has researched and written a lot about exercise
(bear with us, we’ll get to the point quickly). His philosophy is to ﬁnd the least
amount of exercise needed to remain healthy. That’s an attitude you’ve got to
love and that’s our approach to process. Look for the least amount of process
and procedure possible to generate a calm, consistent, and manageable project
team environment. Predeﬁned processes and procedures reduce stress because
people know in advance how to handle routine situations. However, those same
people can feel stressed out when there are so many processes and procedures
that they literally can’t get their jobs done. Find the least amount of process you
can to make your project manageable and be careful not to build in so much pro-
cess that everyone spends time on process and none on the project itself. Help
your team be productive by deﬁning key project processes and procedures. If
possible, work with the project team to deﬁne these so that the processes will be
ones the whole team can live and die by.
There are many different processes and procedures your project may need and
it’s impossible to deﬁne and discuss every possibility. We’ll discuss many of the more
common ones and discuss their components so you can develop your IT project’s
processes and procedures using these as a starting point. If you ﬁnd yourself in the
midst of your project (once it’s underway) and there are areas that seem confusing or
are causing errors, delays, or frustration, they may be candidates for additional pro-
cesses or procedures. If you ﬁnd yourself or your IT team solving the same problem
over and over, it’s a likely candidate for a new process or procedure.The ﬂip side is
don’t deﬁne more processes or procedures than are necessary—keep your project

processes lean and mean to keep your IT team moving forward on project work.
The following is a partial list of processes and procedures you might want to deﬁne
for your project. We’ll discuss each one brieﬂy and there are several that we’ll discuss
in more detail in subsequent chapters.

You may already have some or all of these procedures and processes deﬁned
from previous projects. If so, double-check that they’re applicable to your project and
feel free to reuse any that make sense. Some may need to be tweaked a bit and
others can be used as-is. Others may not address the current project needs and will
have to be tossed aside or rewritten.Any time you can reuse work from a previous
project, do so. If you (or someone you trust) took time to think through a process in
the past, you may as well leverage that work, but do so only after reviewing it to
ensure it’s still applicable.
Acceptance Criteria
We discussed acceptance criteria earlier, so we won’t cover that again. Keep in mind
that acceptance criteria really deﬁne the process by which the user or client formally
accepts the project’s deliverables. It’s critical to deﬁne these with the user or cus-
tomer and to gain agreement on the acceptance criteria before the project gets
underway (or as soon as acceptance criteria can be accurately developed) or you risk
some confusion (or outright ﬁnger-pointing) later on.

Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

Risk Management Plan
We’ll discuss risk management in a later chapter, so for now, we’ll simply mention
that risk management is a process you should have in place for your project, regard-
less of how big or small the project is. Every project faces risks and spending time
identifying those risks before you begin the actual project work will help you avoid
the “running around with your hair on ﬁre” syndrome that often hits IT project
managers at some point during the project. Good risk management planning gives
you intelligent, viable alternatives when identiﬁed risks occur. Great risk manage-
ment can help you avoid the problem in the ﬁrst place by knowing that it might
happen and taking steps to avoid it altogether.
Change Management Plan
We all know that despite our best efforts to plan, things change. One of the most
common changes to a project plan is that the users (those who will utilize the deliv-
erables of the project) come back and say,“Oh, we forgot, we have to have this, that,
and the other thing.”This happens whether you have a hardware or software project,
an internal or external project, a small or a complex project.You know changes to
your project will happen, so you can choose to manage that process or not. If you
choose not to manage the process, you can end up with a project that looks like
spaghetti—a jumbled mess. Since there usually are many dependencies in a project,
changing one thing typically changes one or more other things in your project plan,
creating a ripple effect. We’ll discuss creating a change management plan, or process,
so you can manage how, when, and why your project changes.
Communication Plan
You’ll hear a lot about communications plans throughout this book because they are
some of the most overlooked processes in IT project management. Many IT depart-
ments are not very good at communicating with anyone except others within the
IT department.You may bristle at that statement, but the overwhelming number of
complaints registered about IT departments is that requests go in and silence comes
out. If this does not describe you or your IT department, you are to be congratu-
lated.The rest of you know who you are…and in later chapters we’ll talk about cre-
ating effective (and simple) communications plans so you can break the pattern and
the perception of poor communication from IT. It’s possible you never thought of
communicating as a process, so you’ve already learned something that can help you
communicate more effectively by establishing processes and procedures to make your
life easier.

Organizing IT Projects • Chapter 6
259

Quality Management Plan
In Chapter 7, we’re going to discuss quality. It’s been given its very own chapter
because quality is a critical part of all projects and managing quality touches all
aspects of the project. So, while quality is built into a project from the ground up
and is deﬁned and managed at each step, we will devote a chapter to identifying this
in more detail.As a process or procedure, you may also have a separate Quality
Management or Quality Assurance Plan. If you’re using any one of a number of
quality programs (Six Sigma, ISO9000, etc.), you may have a framework for man-
aging quality that is separate from the IT project management process. If so, it inte-
grates well with the IT PM processes and will drive the quality of the ﬁnal project
results.
Status Reporting
You should identify the procedures you want the IT project team to use to report
project and task status. It’s important that you decide what information will help you
know the project is on track.Think back to our discussion about the ﬂexibility grid
and the concept of precision or rigor. If budget is the least ﬂexible element, your
status reporting should clearly contain information about the budgetary items such
as the actual versus estimated cost of each task or deliverable. If time is your most
ﬂexible element, you may not have the team track the time spent on the project
down to the minute, but instead ask that time be rounded to the nearest hour or
even half day.
There are several keys to effective status reporting:
1.
The process for reporting status should utilize existing tools.
2.
The status report should include data that already exists or is easy to com-
pile, such as tasks completed, tasks underway, dollars spent, etc..
3.
The reporting process should be well deﬁned and should only ask for data
that will help you manage the project.
4.
The reporting process should not take long to complete from data gath-
ering to reporting.
The adage “You get what you measure” certainly holds true here.The informa-
tion you request in a status report is what your IT team will focus on because they’ll
have to report on it. Human nature being what it is, your team will strive to report
positive results on the things they have to report, so they’ll work hard to make sure
they can report positive things. If you’re measuring or monitoring the wrong things,
www.syngress.com
260
Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

your IT team will probably focus on those wrong things and your results won’t be
quite as good or on target as you’d like.Also avoid re-creating systems that are
already in place. For instance, if your company has a process for people reporting
their time for payroll processing, you may not need an additional time tracking tool.
Look for ways to leverage existing systems before creating or adding new systems.
What To Report
Another truth about reporting is that if it is too difﬁcult, too cumbersome, or takes
too much time to complete, your team may very well “guesstimate” rather than take
the time and effort to complete the status report accurately. If it takes too much
effort, people will often forego accuracy (and sometimes truth) in order to just get
the report done. If you’ve taken time to really think about what you need to know
and how your team needs to report that, you can ﬁnd the least amount of reporting
that will keep you well informed. Some companies use exception-based reporting,
meaning that they only want to know about work or tasks that are exceptions to the
plan. If a task starts late or is running over budget, that would be reported. If a task is
on time, has completed within budget, and is otherwise normal it would not be
reported.
It’s also important to sit down with your project sponsor and ﬁnd out what kind
of reporting he or she will need. Status reporting is the process of the team reporting
to you, the IT project manager. However, you’ll also have to report on the project
status to your project sponsor and perhaps to other key executives. Reporting to
your project sponsor may be a regular weekly report, for example, and reporting to
key executives may well fall under the heading “Communications Plan” discussed
later in this section. Many IT project managers ﬁnd it helpful to develop a list of key
metrics or data that ﬁts with the ﬂexibility and precision decisions made earlier with
the sponsor and use those as the basis for discussion. If you ask the project sponsor
an open-ended question such as,“What information on the project would you like
to know about?” the response you receive can run the gamut from very little to
everything. If your project sponsor’s work style falls in the doer category, he or she
may simply want to know that the project is on track and if there are any major
problems. If your project sponsor’s work style falls in the analyst category, he or she
may ask for so much detail that you’re running around preparing reports instead of
actually managing the project. Rather than start with a “blank sheet of paper”, start
the discussion with your suggestions and ask the project sponsor to add or remove
items.You’ll end up with a more focused, useful list of items on which you’ll need
to report. It will also be another good opportunity to make sure your expectations
are in line with your project sponsor’s.

261

How To Report
You (and possibly your IT project team) should determine how the status reports
will be generated and delivered. If you’re using a project management software tool,
you can use the tools and functionality within the tool to help your team develop
and deliver reports based on data in the tool. However, not all PM tools have the
same reporting capabilities. For instance, many users of Microsoft Project complain
that it’s very difﬁcult to print just the data they want. If it’s in a canned report it’s
ﬁne, but if not, it can be difﬁcult to generate meaningful reports. Other programs
have limitations and you should try to avoid having the team jump through hoops to
get data out of the PM tool for reporting. Some companies want hard copies of
status reports, while others keep them as soft copy ﬁles on a server. Whatever
method you use, make sure that everyone on your IT project team have access to
the same reporting tools. If everyone but the three remote team members have
access to a particular program, those three remote team members will not only be
out of the loop, but they’ll also have to do extra work to comply with reporting
requirements. Make sure that if you use any technology for reporting that all team
members have equal access or that you make speciﬁc accommodations to address any
shortfalls.
When To Report
Another question you’ll need to answer is how often you need status reports.
Remember that more frequent milestones or checkpoints are important to a suc-
cessful project, so it makes sense that frequent reporting can also contribute to a pro-
ject’s success—to a point.You should determine the best reporting interval based on
the complexity and scale of the project as well as your company’s typical reporting
cycles. If you have to report to your manager or project sponsor every week, you
may need to have your team update you each week.You might also decide (and get
approval) to have your team update you every two weeks and you present an
overview report each month. If your reporting interval is too frequent, IT project
team members may “fudge” their reports because it would take too much time away
from getting the project work done.You can discourage that by making the
reporting interval frequent enough to ensure the project is on track, but not so fre-
quent as to be a burden on you or the team.
Ideally, you, your IT project team, and your project sponsor should come to
agreement on what has to be reported, how it has to be reported, and when it has to
be reported. If you can have the team participate in this deﬁnition process, you may
ﬁnd that the things you were going to request are too difﬁcult to report on regularly
(due to the PM tool or other factors) or you may have overlooked something
www.syngress.com
262
Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

important that your team or project sponsor identiﬁes.A collaborative approach can
ﬁne-tune the reporting process so it encourages and drives the project outcomes.
Cheat Sheet …
Reporting on Reports
Some project managers make reporting such a big deal that it becomes an end
in itself. This would fall into the category of “process for process’s sake”, which
is nothing more than the tail chasing the tiger. Create a list of things you think
should be reported and take it to your team for veriﬁcation, approval, or modiﬁ-
cation. Then, see if you can pare it down further. Ask yourself, “What will this
information do for me?” or “What will I do with this information once I have it?”
Some information may clearly be needed such as actual budget for each task or
deliverable. However, there’s lot of information you can ask for and have your
team report on that will not help you manage the project toward success. If you
can’t clearly state what the information is and how you will use it, consider
removing it from your list. Keep it lean and mean to encourage accurate, timely,
and meaningful reporting. And don’t confuse reporting with recording. You may
want or require your team to record very detailed information about the project,
but you may only request a small portion of that data in the form of a report.
You need the detail as backup and as history, but you probably don’t need all that
detail in a report. Here’s a staggering factoid: 80% of all documents ﬁled (elec-
tronic or paper) are never touched again. If you think about that when looking
at reporting requirements, you might well be able to pare things down.
Defect/Error/Issue Tracking
Despite your best planning efforts, you will have to have some method of tracking
deviations from the plan, whether those show up in the form of defects, errors, or
issues. We’ll use the generic issue tracking to refer to all types of problem tracking in a
project.
You and your IT project team should deﬁne the issue tracking process and iden-
tify procedures the team can use when these issues arise.At minimum, you should
deﬁne:
1.
What constitutes an issue? 
2.
How should the issue be reported?
www.syngress.com
Organizing IT Projects • Chapter 6
263

3.
How should the issue be tracked?
4.
How should the issue be resolved?
What Constitutes An Issue?
Using a process similar to the one you developed when identifying success criteria,
you can identify criteria to use to identify a problem or issue. Identify what consti-
tutes an issue that should be reported versus normal bumps along the project road.
Some issues get resolved by the person who is working on the task or deliverable.
Other issues require team notiﬁcation because they:
■
Impact other tasks’ start, ﬁnish or deliverables
■
Impact the cost of the project
■
Impact the project schedule
■
Trigger one of the project risks
■
Put the entire project at risk
There may be other categories you want to add, but you can use this list as a
starting point. Once you’ve identiﬁed the criteria that will be used by the team to
identify reportable issues (versus issues that are handled quickly and easily within the
project or even the task), the team will have a clear sense of what has to be reported
and what doesn’t. Once the project gets underway, you may ﬁnd you have to modify
these criteria to adjust to the reality of your project work, but the initial deﬁnition
will help you and the team with a starting point.
The IT Factor…
Starting From Scratch
In most instances, it’s easier for people to respond to something than to create
it from scratch. Developing the criteria for issue tracking is a good example. You
may come up with a list of suggested criteria and present it to the project team
so they can respond to it. This might save time and effort, and your project team
will have the opportunity for input without the burden of creating the original
list. Responding to something usually takes less time and effort than creating it
from scratch. Giving people the option of providing input for changes is often a
better use of time than trying to “design by committee.”

Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

How Should the Issue be Reported?
Once your team understands what has to be reported, you’ll also have to develop a
procedure for reporting issues. First, how much information should be reported
about an issue? Do you want an issue report form or just a list of items to include in
the report? A quick issue report might include items such as issue title, brief descrip-
tion, person reporting, reporting date, and the task it is associated with.A lengthier
report might include a longer description, how the issue was discovered, what the
potential impact is (high, medium, or low criticality) and suggested resolution, as an
example.You’ll also need to ask and answer questions such as:Are issues reported to
the team via e-mail or via their periodic status reports? Should critical issues be
reported differently than non-critical issues? Should the entire team be notiﬁed of an
issue or just the project manager? Identify the methods the team will use to report
issues.Again, you want to avoid ﬂooding the entire team with constant issue reports
that don’t pertain to them, but you also want the team in the loop on issues that
may impact them or that impact the entire project. If you’re using technology for
these issue notiﬁcation, make sure all members of your project team have equal
access to these tools and know how to use them.
How Should the Issue be Tracked?
Once issues are identiﬁed and reported, how will they be tracked? Will you, as the
IT project manager, manage that process? Will that task be assigned to a member of
the team? Will the task be tracked in a software tool such as a Microsoft Word docu-
ment, Excel spreadsheet, or Access database? Will issues be given a unique tracking
number and if so, what is that number based upon? Will issues be tied to tasks or to
the resource (person) performing the task? Again, less is more, so keep the tracking
methods short and simple.Also make sure you have a system in place to avoid losing
track of issues. Issue tracking is a key metric directly related to the health of the pro-
ject.Tracking and managing issues also helps keep the team focused on the impor-
tant problems.At the end of the project, as part of the close out we’ll discuss toward
the end of this book, you’ll need to review all issues and ensure they were either
resolved or closed.Any open issues at the end of the project should be reviewed and
addressed (hint: some issues become irrelevant and are simply closed or left unre-
solved at the end of the project, but we’ll discuss that in detail later).

How Should the Issue be Resolved?
Finally, what is the process for resolving issues? As you’ll learn when we start
assigning tasks, a task without an owner doesn’t get done, and a task with two or
more owners usually doesn’t get done.The rule: one task, one owner.The same
holds true for issues. If you feel like you need to assign more than one person to an
issue, you might want to break the issue into its components and assign each com-
ponent to an individual.This way you avoid the old ﬁnger-pointing routine or the
honest confusion that comes from,“Sorry, I thought Lisa was handling that.” Issue
resolution not only requires an owner, it requires a deadline. Issues without deadlines
rarely resolved. If possible, identify the completion criteria for the issue resolution as
well. Completion criteria, which we’ll discuss later when we discuss our work break-
down structure, are the criteria you develop so you’ll know in a very clear and
unambiguous way that the task was completed satisfactorily.These can also be devel-
oped for issue resolution. Sometimes the resolutions (or completion criteria) are
unknown, but you can to develop these criteria as you go along. For instance, if a
developer is working on a section of code and discovers that it will not integrate
into the existing code in the manner that was speciﬁed or assumed, you have an
issue to resolve. What would resolve this issue? The developer might have a few sug-
gestions that can be included in the issue. For instance, she might suggest that an
additional piece of code could be spec’d out to integrate these two elements or that
the speciﬁcations for the code she’s writing be revised to include code that will inte-
grate these components. Often the person closest to the issue has the most realistic
ideas about how the issue can be resolved, so encourage task owners or those
working on the task to provide their input.Also keep in mind that it is possible for
someone to be too close to a problem to see the solution, so sometimes the person
closest to the issue is the most stumped for an answer (or has a vested interest in a
particular solution) and you may have to turn to other subject matter experts for
advice, input, or assistance.
Escalation Procedures
Escalation procedures should be put in place before problems arise, which is why
you should deﬁne them at this point in your project.There are several types of esca-
lation and each procedure should be clearly deﬁned.
Issue Escalation
Members of your team should have a clearly deﬁned escalation procedure to use to
raise critical problems. If the procedure is clearly deﬁned, team members don’t have
www.syngress.com
266
Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

to think too hard to ﬁgure out how and when to escalate an issue. While your team
members may be bright, motivated people, you want to minimize the amount of
time and effort they expend on project tasks that don’t drive the project forward.
Work with your team to identify how and when issues should be escalated. If you’ve
identiﬁed which types of things constitute issues (see the previous section) and what
priority these issues are, then you’re halfway to deﬁning when to escalate an issue.
Use clear, binary types of decision points. If you leave too much gray area, it will
either cause confusion for the team or you risk having each team member interpret
the guidelines differently.
Team Problem Escalation
You should also deﬁne how team members should resolve and escalate problems
between team members. Whenever two or more people work together, the possi-
bility for interpersonal conﬂict pops up and you should have clearly deﬁned proce-
dures for team members to escalate issues about the team itself. It’s important to
instill in the team members a sense of responsibility to the team so it can function at
its best. Part of functioning well is addressing problems when they arise, and pro-
viding an easy-to-use escalation process for interpersonal problems will make sure
that team members feel they have an outlet for resolving issues they cannot resolve
on their own.As IT project manager, your job is to ensure the successful completion
of the project and part of that is clearing away roadblocks to success.
Project Problem Escalation
Sometimes there is a problem with team members or with the project itself that are
outside your area of inﬂuence or control. In these cases, you should deﬁne a project
problem escalation procedure and run it by your project sponsor.As you know, the
IT project manager often has to manage without organizational authority.That
means that you have no direct control over project team members other than to try
to inﬂuence them to complete their tasks or project work on time, on budget, and
with the required quality. What if they fail to do that? What if they are falling
behind and putting the project at risk? What if they are simply unable to deliver?
What should you do? Since your job is to shepherd the project along toward suc-
cessful completion, you may also need an escalation path to someone in the organi-
zation with the authority to resolve higher-level issues.That person might be your
project sponsor or it might not be, but often the escalation path goes through the
project sponsor for issues that you’re unable to resolve through normal processes.
In additional to potential personnel issues that might impact your project, there
may also be issues with the project itself that should be escalated.This might be a key

vendor failing to deliver due to a payment dispute with your corporate ﬁnance folks
or a key part of the project failing initial tests. Sit down with your project sponsor and
identify the types of issues that should be brought to him or her for resolution. Some
project sponsors are fairly hands-on and might want you to bring all issues with high
or medium criticality to their attention immediately. Others might want a weekly or
monthly report. Still others might tell you to only come to them when all other
options fail.You’ll need to develop an explicit understanding with your sponsor about
escalating issues (how, what, when, where, why, who) so there are no misunderstand-
ings. No one likes unhappy surprises and project sponsors are no exception.You know
how much you hate being taken by surprise, so make sure you keep your project
sponsor up to date by agreeing, in advance, on escalation procedures.
Documentation Procedures
As you’ve gone through the last couple of chapters, you’ve seen the document icon
we’re using to indicate when you have a tangible document as the outcome.
Examples include user requirements, acceptance criteria, and the initial project pro-
posal.All of these are examples of project documentation. Each company may have
its own procedures regarding how to document a project and if yours has deﬁned
procedures, feel free to use them. Otherwise, work with your project team to deﬁne
what has to be documented and why. Just like status reports, you may not need to
document every last detail (then again, you may need to), and you should only doc-
ument what’s going to be useful in the future. Remember that there may be legal,
ethical, or corporate requirements about documentation for your project and you
should clearly adhere to those requirements. If nothing like that exists, think about
which information will be useful to you or someone during and after the project,
then decide how that information should be captured and documented.
Keep in mind that documentation can be useful during the life of the project for
ﬁguring out what was done when and by whom, but it can also be helpful later
when quality testing or troubleshooting issues. Keeping thorough (but relevant)
records may also end up being a very useful tool after the project is complete.
Approval Procedures
In an ideal world, the IT project manager would have full authority over the project,
including the authority to approve the schedule, allocate resources, and spend money.
In the real world, the amount of authority given to the IT project manager varies
widely.At minimum, you should have the authority to get the project done without
constantly going back to the project sponsor for approval. If that ends up being the
case, the project sponsor may not clearly understand his or her role versus your role
www.syngress.com
268
Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

as IT project manager. If the project sponsor trusts you to run the project, he or she
should also trust you, within certain guidelines, to make decisions for the project. In
most situations, IT project managers have enough authority to make routine expen-
ditures and decisions for the project and are required to go to their project sponsor
for approval for unusual or large decisions.
Before heading into your project, get agreement from your project sponsor as to
what does and does not require project sponsor approval. If possible, negotiate for a
reasonable amount of autonomy to make scheduling, resource, and budget decisions.
For budget expenditures, most companies have set rules regarding what level of
expenditure requires additional approval. If those are too low for your project, make
the business case for raising that limit for the project. For example, suppose your
company has a limit of $500 for any single expenditure before getting higher-level
approval. Suppose your IT project involves replacing all of the corporate servers,
each of which you estimate to cost between $800 and $3,000. Every time you pre-
pare to purchase a new server, your current guidelines would require you to get
approval.You could be strangled by corporate red tape even before you purchase
your ﬁrst server.You may want to build this level of ﬁscal authority into the project
plan itself so that within the initial project proposal you state that all expenditures for
servers up to $3,000 per server will be allowed and other expenditures above $500
will go through the approval process (or whatever reasonable solution works for
you). Pre-negotiate these items so your project doesn’t get bogged down later on
with budget review and exception requests.
Deployment Plan
Developing a deployment plan may be part of your project’s deliverables, but it might
be overlooked if someone outside your IT project team is responsible for deployment
activities. In many software companies, especially enterprise-level software, the deploy-
ment is handled by a specialized deployment team. In other companies, the IT team is
the one that does the deployment. If necessary, form a deployment team and make
sure you invite key users (typically handpicked subject matter experts) to participate in
developing the deployment plan since it will directly impact users. If you don’t involve
users in developing the deployment plan, there’s a good chance you’ll make incorrect
assumptions, disrupt operations, and have a whole group of people really cranky with
you and the IT team. It’s much easier to bring the right people together to develop
the plan, gain their buy-in, utilize their expertise, and develop a plan that meets the
needs of both the IT project team and the users.
www.syngress.com
Organizing IT Projects • Chapter 6
269

Operations Plan
After the project is complete and deployed, will you also need to operate or main-
tain the project’s deliverables? For instance, if your team is responsible for developing
Web content for a client, will you also be expected to maintain that content? If so,
you need a post-project operations plan that delineates what has to happen next.
Clearly the operations plan will be speciﬁc to each type of project and deliverable, so
guidelines here won’t be of too much help. However, you can use your IT project
management process to create a project plan for the operations plan. Sound redun-
dant? It’s not really. If a project is, by deﬁnition, a unique solution to a unique
problem, then you can use PM to solve the problem of “How do we maintain the
operations of the project after it’s been completed and deployed?”
Training Plan
The training plan is listed last, but it shouldn’t be the last thing you think of at the
end of your project. One of the most common criticisms of IT departments is that
they don’t think about training until it’s too late or they assume it’s someone else’s
job. Even if delivering the training is someone else’s job, you should begin to deﬁne
what will be needed by the trainers when you hand this project off to them.The
easiest way to create your training plan may be to invite the key training staff to a
meeting and ask them what they’ll need and when. If training is up to you, you’ll
need to answer those questions with the user in mind, not with the IT project
schedule in mind. User training can be accomplished in numerous ways and ﬁnding
the most effective training methods, both in terms of the cost of training and the
effectiveness for the user, is important. If you wait until the project is winding down
to think about training, you’re doing yourself, your team, and your project a disser-
vice because the user perception of the project will be negatively impacted as will
their actual experience.As with your operations plan, you may choose to create a
separate sub-project plan that goes through all the IT PM steps to create a training
plan.As you’ve probably already ﬁgured out, these IT PM steps are highly scalable, so
you can use it for large and small projects alike. Using the same IT PM process for
all your projects reinforces your skills and provides a consistent approach that
everyone will appreciate, especially as they become more and more familiar with the
IT PM components.A good place to start with training elements is with the pro-
ject’s requirements.This helps identify who might need training and what elements
will be included in training.

People, Technology, and Business
When you’re developing your processes and procedures, keep in mind that all IT
projects involve people, technology, and business. Make sure your processes
address or accommodate these three elements. If you forget about people or
business in favor of technology (the most common thing IT project managers do),
your project will start to wobble. Your processes and procedures should conform
to your business’s requirements; they should help people get the project done
quickly and efﬁciently (and ideally, reduce the amount of work people have to
do). Once you’ve got those two bases covered, you can concern yourself with
processes and procedures involving technology. Saving the best for last (from an
IT perspective) will help you remember to address the ﬁrst two.
Figure 6.10 Project Processes and Procedures
If you refer to Figure 6.11 (the same as Figure 6.2 earlier in the chapter), you
can see that the output from the steps described here in Chapter 6 is an initial pro-
ject plan that you should bring to your project sponsor for approval.Approval
includes verifying the information and assumptions included in the project as well as
giving you the green light for moving on to the next phase of your IT project plan-
ning process.You should have steps 1, 2, and 3 completed. Once you have approval
from your project sponsor (steps 4 and 5) you can move on to step 6, which we’ll
discuss in Chapters 7 and 8.

The Genesis of Problems
It’s been said that many problems are born from solutions. If you think about
that, it means that often when we think we’re solving a problem, we’re creating
new problems. While we can’t always avoid creating new problems, we can cer-
tainly reduce the number or magnitude of new problems by taking time to make
sure we’re solving the right problem in the right way. The steps we’ve reviewed
in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 will help you make sure you’re solving the right
problem in the best way possible. Everything we do from here on out will build
upon the foundation we’ve built in these two chapters, so now’s the best time
to step back and make sure you are comfortable with what you’ve developed so
far. If not, make a few tweaks so your project actually solves more problems than
it creates.

Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

Summary
In this chapter, we continued the process started in Chapter 5 by honing our project
deﬁnition and by creating the project structure and framework.You should now have
clearly deﬁned project objectives, which are used as the project’s major deliverables
or are used to deﬁne the major deliverables. We spent quite a bit of time identifying
and categorizing stakeholders.This often-skipped step is vital to a successful project
because making sure the project meets the needs of users and the expectations of
stakeholders is vitally important.Although the task of identifying all stakeholders can
be a bit larger than you might at ﬁrst have imagined, when you’re ﬁnished, you’ll
know that you’ve likely included all the right people in the right ways.
With a complete list of project stakeholders, you can develop the project’s
requirements.To develop requirements before identifying all the relevant project
stakeholders would simply mean you’d have to cycle through this process two or
three (or more) times to reﬁne requirements as you discovered or included new
stakeholders or risk the project will not meet all perceived requirements. With a com-
plete and categorized list of stakeholders, you can more easily manage the require-
ments gathering phase. Depending on the nature of the IT project, your project
requirements will vary.You will also have to ﬁnd a way to integrate or manage
sometimes disparate requirements. Sometimes that means you have to negotiate with
various stakeholders or work with them to agree on what might be removed or
delayed so the project has a chance of success. Clearly deﬁned, agreed-upon require-
ments is one of the most essential elements of a successful project and time spent on
this step will pay for itself tenfold on the other end.
We reviewed a number of project parameters that you’ll need to deﬁne for your
project including success criteria and acceptance criteria.These help you deﬁne, in
advance, what the project will look like when successfully completed and what it
will take for clients to sign off on major deliverables. We also deﬁned a number of
other parameters such as the ﬂexibility grid and the amount of precision needed for
the project.These are needed when you have to make decisions regarding changes to
the project later on.They help you make better, faster decisions that are aligned with
the priorities of the company and the project sponsor.There are numerous other
project parameters that you may want to deﬁne in order to bring clarity to your
project early in the planning cycle.
Every project also requires infrastructure and this is as good a time as any to
begin deﬁning those elements.You’ll need to decide what physical infrastructure
needs you have such as ofﬁce space, furniture, and phone lines.You’ll also need to
ﬁgure out your technology requirements from computers, network connections, net-
work storage, cell phones, and PDAs to any special technology needs such as a

testing lab or testing equipment.Also make sure that all the remote members of your
team are as connected as those at the home ofﬁce and that the remote staff have
equal access to project resources.
Project processes and procedures, when well-designed, help reduce IT project
team stress by providing simple, easy-to-use processes, procedures, and tools to help
them manage the project workload. Consistent processes and procedures help
everyone perform at a higher level, but there is a limit.Avoid creating processes and
procedures that simply get in the way of getting work done. Encourage feedback
from your team during the deﬁnition of processes and procedures as well as when
the project is underway.Your job is to remove roadblocks for your team, not create
them, so deﬁne only as many processes and procedures as will help.This varies from
project to project and from company to company. If you have processes and proce-
dures from previous projects, repurposing them can save you a lot of time—don’t
reinvent the wheel if you don’t have to.
Solutions Fast Track
Identifying Project Objectives
 Develop the project objective statement, which helps focus you on what
outcome(s) you’re trying to achieve.
 Develop three to ﬁve major objectives or major deliverables based on the
work you’ve done to this point (problem, mission and solution, target
scope, time, budget, and quality).
 It’s usually helpful to deﬁne what is and is not included in the project to
avoid making incorrect assumptions.
Identifying Stakeholders
 Stakeholders are those people or groups who have a vested interest in the
outcome of the project. Users are a particular subset of stakeholders who are
most impacted by (and who impact) the project.
 Stakeholders should be identiﬁed before requirements are developed
because ideally, requirements should be the result of identifying and
addressing stakeholder needs.

Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

Organizing IT Projects • Chapter 6
275
 Stakeholders can be categorized to help you sort through their needs,
demands, and requirements.Three categories that might be helpful to you
are inﬂuential, involved, and informed.
 Inﬂuential stakeholders typically include users who both inﬂuence the
project’s direction and are inﬂuenced by the ﬁnal result.
 Involved stakeholders are those who need to be involved at some point
during the life of the project.This might include the Marketing or HR
departments, for instance.
 Informed stakeholders are those who need to be informed at certain points
along the way, but do not need to be directly involved in the project.This
might mean keeping other departments up to date on the status of your
project even if your project work or results have no direct bearing on
them.
Identifying Project Requirements
 Identifying requirements begins with correctly and thoroughly identifying
and categorizing stakeholders.
 Deﬁning the project’s requirements is an iterative process that may also
involve negotiation.As the IT project manager, you have a good idea about
what’s possible and what’s not given a certain scope, time, cost, and quality
requirement.
 A project that does not meet user requirements is, by deﬁnition, a failure.
Make sure you negotiate and gain agreement on user requirements before
moving forward.
 Requirements typically fall into one of four categories: user, business,
technical, and functional.
Reﬁning Project Parameters
 Success criteria and acceptance criteria are two very important parameters to
deﬁne for your project. Success criteria are speciﬁc (preferably measurable)
measurements you, your team, and your project sponsor will use to
determine that the project is/was successful.Acceptance criteria are
typically used when users must accept (which often translates into pay for)
tangible deliverables from the project. It is critical to deﬁne these criteria
clearly and in a binary manner.

 You should reﬁne your target or estimates for scope, schedule, cost, and quality
for the project at this point.You will continue to reﬁne these metrics
moving forward, but as you more speciﬁcally deﬁne the project, you should
be able to home in on these estimates.
 The flexibility grid helps you identify which elements of the project are
most and least ﬂexible according to your project sponsor.This helps you
make decisions about change later in the project that are aligned with the
sponsor’s priorities.
 If you are aware of constraints, limits, and risks to the project at this point,
they are worth noting. In some cases, these may be quite signiﬁcant and
cause you (or the project sponsor) to re-evaluate the feasibility or
desirability of the project. If the project is terminated as a result, you should
view this as a win for stopping a “bad” project from going forward.
 If you are aware of any milestones at this point, you can also record those.
Milestones are not typically developed until later in the planning process,
but if you are aware of any, they should be recorded now so they are not
overlooked later.
 The initial project plan, which is the result of the steps in this chapter, may
also be used as the basis for a Statement of Work or Project Charter
document. Some companies use these terms interchangeably, and some
have speciﬁc elements they require for such documents.All three (SOW,
PC, and IPP) serve to clarify and document the high-level information
about the project so the project can gain the ofﬁcial green light to move
forward.
Deﬁning Project Infrastructure
 The infrastructure needed for the project may include communication and
collaboration tools for the team, communications devices (cell phones,
PDAs, laptops, etc.), and other technology components needed to
successfully complete the project.
 Infrastructure also includes the project team’s needs in terms of ofﬁce/desk
space, ofﬁce equipment (desks, cubicles, chairs, etc.), conference rooms, labs,
or test equipment needed to successfully complete the project.

Chapter 6 • Organizing IT Projects

Deﬁning Project Processes
 If you have deﬁned project processes and procedures in the past that have
worked well, reuse those.
 If your company has deﬁned processes and procedures you are required to
use, start with those and add only as many additional processes or
procedures as needed to drive project quality and efﬁciency.Too many
procedures can hinder productivity and quality.
 There are many different kinds or processes and procedures you can deﬁne.
Some of the more commonly used ones include deﬁning how status will
be reported, how issues will be tracked, how changes to the project will be
requested and approved, and how issues will be escalated.
 Additional plans related to the project may be required and these can be
deﬁned as project procedures.These may include a communications plan, a
deployment plan, an operations plan, and a training plan. Not all projects
require all of these plans; some projects require other plans not listed here.
Q: Project planning in our company seems to go on and on and on. We seem to
be able to plan something to death. What are we doing wrong?
A: IT projects are often managed by people who fall into the analyst category.
One of the downsides to this work type is that they have a tendency to ana-
lyze things to death.They can feel as if they never have enough data to
ﬁnalize the plan or make a decision.As a result, they get “analysis paralysis.”
Two things are important in overcoming this type of behavior. First is to
acknowledge that we rarely, if ever, have “perfect knowledge” and at some
point, we have enough information to move forward.The second thing is
that things will change over time—they always do. Since project management
is an iterative process, it means you will have to go back and tweak things

later on. So, spending time to make it perfect now is a waste of time because
it will more than likely change.To overcome this problem, it’s often helpful
to determine if you (or the team) feel you have 80% of what’s needed. If so,
move on.Also, set deadlines that are rigorous but achievable. Don’t let the
project lose momentum, ﬁnd some doers and get them on the project team—
they’ll get things moving if you let them.
Q: Everyone at our company thinks P-L-A-N is a four-letter word.Any time I
suggest we create a project plan, eyes roll and I get a lot of sarcastic com-
ments about sitting around in planning meetings and never getting anything
done. What can I do to counteract this attitude?
A: Many companies view planning as a waste of time and that’s probably
because if you plan and plan and plan and never do anything, planning is a
waste of time. However, the reverse is also true. If you charge ahead without
a clear idea of where you’re headed and why, that’s also a waste of time.There
is a happy medium—planning followed by action. If you ﬁnd a lot of resis-
tance in your company to planning, try implementing one or two new prac-
tices at a time. While using the IT project management process end-to-end as
delineated in this book will yield the most optimal results, implementing
even one or two pieces of it will certainly help your project. For instance,
maybe you start out by asking your team to help you clarify or identify the
problem you’re trying to solve, who you’re trying to solve it for (stakeholders,
users), and what the desired outcome is.You haven’t used the word “plan-
ning”; instead, you’ve used the word “clarify” or “identify”. Sometimes just
changing a few words and not making a big production out of “planning”
can help reduce resistance. Over time, these new habits should lead to better
project results, which in turn could give you the opportunity to introduce
one or two additional planning habits. Eventually, you’ll have your IT project
team (or company) planning without the sarcasm because you’ll start with
planning, but your planning will result in action.
Q: It seems that no matter how good a job we do at gathering user require-
ments, we always have some big change thrust upon us mid-project. What
can we do that avoid this in the future?

A: Changing user requirements in mid-project is one of the most common, and
most frustrating, elements of managing an IT project.The solution starts with
identifying what is causing or allowing these changes in mid-project. Does
your IT project team really do a good job gathering requirements? You might
think so, but it’s worth a second look to determine if your team can do a
better job gathering requirements. One of the keys is to listen more than you
talk. Listen to what users say they need and translate that into requirements.
Negotiate with users only after you’ve gathered their requirements.
Sometimes in the requirements gathering stage, someone from the project
team begins to mold the requirements based on things outside the user such
as the desire to use a particular technology or to implement a particular solu-
tion. Begin with listening to the user to gather the real requirements, not just
the ones you and your team might like best.The other problem might be
that your process for getting users to sign off on the requirements might be
too weak or too ill-deﬁned. It might be useful for you to formalize this pro-
cess so users (whether internal or external) understand two key things. First,
when they agree to the requirements, they are essentially “engraved in stone”
and second, the cost of change goes up exponentially (while quality typically
goes down) once the project is underway. Helping users to understand why
it’s important that the requirements be agreed to and locked in helps them
understand what’s in it for them.And, what’s in it for them is a project result
that meets their expectations in terms of scope, budget, time, and quality. In
some cases, creating prototypes might help avoid mid-project changes.
Q: You deﬁned a ton of project parameters and I get exhausted just thinking of
deﬁning all of this. Is it really necessary?
A: Each project is unique and the parameters you’ll need to deﬁne for each pro-
ject will also vary widely.You may not need every single parameter deﬁned in
this chapter, and you may ﬁnd there are additional parameters you need to
deﬁne that are not discussed here.The information listed is to give you a
running start so you can deﬁne the elements that are critical to your project’s
success.And remember, it’s about the quality of the data, not the quantity of
the data. If you have a 10-page project plan or a 100-page project plan, it’s
only as good as the information in it, so only include the elements that will
help you and your IT project team deliver a successful project.Also keep in
mind that you can utilize your IT project team in the development of these
parameters—parse out the work so that each team member has a deliverable

and come together as a team to discuss and ﬁnalize these. It will be a better
use of everyone’s time, it will help reduce gaps and errors, and you won’t be
saddled with coming up with all of this on your own. Finally, smaller, less
complex projects may need only a few of these parameters—deﬁne only
what will make the project work clear and the ﬁnal result successful.
Q: Our company is holding the line on technology expenditures and not all of
the members of my IT project team have access to the same tools.Any sug-
gestions?
A: That can be a tricky situation. If the technology required for the IT project’s
success cannot be purchased or acquired, you have to step back and ask why
the company would want this project to move forward without the tools it
needs for success. For instance, if you are tasked with upgrading the server
infrastructure to Microsoft Windows Server 2003, but you are not authorized
to create a testing lab, you have a problem.The same holds true when members
of the project team do not have equal access to the tools to get the job done.
Typically the most effective approach is to determine the cost of not having
these tools available—the cost in terms of real dollars and in terms of lost dol-
lars.The real dollar cost might be overtime, hiring external help, etc..The lost
dollars might be that project team members are unavailable to work on other
tasks or projects or that the project itself comes in at a lower scope or quality. If
you can quantify the cost and risk of not having these tools, you may be able
to get your company to purchase or acquire these tools. If you can’t, you may
need to seriously reassess whether it’s wise to move forward with this project at
this time. Finally, you and your team may need to get creative about how to
use existing tools to which all team members have access. Necessity is the
mother of invention and you might discover a cool new way to use existing
tools to help team members on the project.

Q: Our company has some very speciﬁc processes and procedures deﬁned for
projects, but they don’t really seem to help me manage my IT projects any
better. How should I approach this?
A: There are two parts to this question.The ﬁrst is that your company has pro-
cesses and procedures that don’t really meet your needs. If you believe they
are “process for process’s sake,” you can ask that your project be exempt from
one or more of these processes or procedures. Remember though, choose
your battles wisely. If some of the processes and procedures don’t make sense
but they’re easy enough to comply with, you may choose to leave those for
another time.Also keep in mind that some processes and procedures are there
to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or to meet the needs of the
business.Assess which ones might serve a higher purpose even if they’re not
meaningful to you.Then, try to lobby for reducing or eliminating those pro-
cesses or procedures that simply get in your way and don’t produce a mean-
ingful result.The second part of this is that you must implement processes
and procedures that ﬁt your IT project.After reviewing the corporate pro-
cesses, you can then determine what additional procedures you may need for
your project.Avoid adding to already existing processes and procedures if the
result will be redundant or just slightly different.

Introduction
The title of this chapter is “Quality From the Ground Up” because it’s important to
build quality into your project right from the beginning.You can try to retroﬁt
quality into your project later on, but it’s just never the same. So, now that you’ve
deﬁned and organized your project, we’re going to discuss the ways you can build
quality into each phase of your project.
No one sets out to deliver poor quality results, but it happens all the time.These
days, with corporate budgets being downsized and expenditures being thoroughly
scrutinized and challenged, it’s even more critical that projects deliver high-quality
results. Lean economic times aren’t the reason you should focus on building quality
into your project, but they can certainly add pressure to do so. Whether your com-
pany is ﬂush with cash or struggling to get by, your goal as the IT project manager
should be to deliver the absolute highest quality result you can within the constraints of
the project. It doesn’t mean you necessarily deliver the absolute highest quality of all
time, but the highest quality within the boundaries of your speciﬁc project. In this
chapter, we’ll explore this concept in more detail.
The biggest misconception about quality in any IT project is that it costs more
money.That’s not necessarily true and in fact, in 99.9% of the cases, it saves the com-
pany time and money far beyond the costs incurred.A study done by IBM in 1990
on the beneﬁts of implementing Software Process Improvement (a.k.a. quality pro-
gram) showed that implementing the program cost 0.005% of total corporate
resources.You might immediately start doing some math, so let’s make up some
numbers. If the company has $1 billion in resources, the cost of the quality program
would have been $5 million.As a result of implementing this quality program, the
number of defects from 414 developers dropped by 50%.This saved 4 man-years
(people-years, to be more exact) in software inspection time, 41 man-years in soft-
ware testing time, and 410 man-years in post-release maintenance time.To simplify
the math, we used a salary of $50,000 for all the people who might be involved in
software inspection, testing, and maintenance.The total number of years saved was
455.At $50,000 each, that totals $22,750,000 saved. Spend $5M, save $22.75M.Any
questions? [Source:“Using Cost Beneﬁt Analysis to Develop Software Process
Improvement Strategies”, Department of Defense, 2000.]
There is a positive ROI (return on investment) for quality programs that are
properly implemented and managed. How much of an ROI is dependent on several
factors, but the point is that they net out in the gain column.There are also other
costs associated with quality from the other side: the cost of poor quality.Think
about the company’s reputation, its ability to sell new software or the next version,
the ability to convince people to convert to their software or product or to purchase
www.syngress.com

Chapter 7 • Quality From the Ground Up

the upgrade.All of those are dependent to a large degree (though not solely) on the
quality of the product.The same holds true for hardware. If you build hardware that
fails or hangs or halts intermittently (or regularly), customers will be reluctant to
purchase or recommend your products. If you implement a poor quality project
internally, you have to deal with downtime, repairs, maintenance, hot ﬁxes, lost pro-
ductivity, and more.There is a cost to implementing quality programs, but there is
usually a higher cost associated with delivering poor quality.That factor is often dif-
ﬁcult to quantify and it’s rarely added in to the cost/beneﬁt/risk analysis, though it
should be.There are tangible examples out in the real world we can point to. One in
particular makes the point painfully clear.The Denver airport stayed closed for over
a year due to software glitches in the automated baggage handling system.After mil-
lions of dollars wasted, it abandoned the system. What was the total cost of failure in
this case? Hundreds of millions of dollars when all the time, effort, expense, and trav-
eler inconvenience is totaled up.
It’s also important to mention that while you may want to aim for perfection,
you have to work with limited time, resources, and money to achieve your project’s
objectives, which can make perfection an elusive and expensive goal.You have to
make tough choices sometimes and you never want to sacriﬁce quality, though that is
often exactly what happens. If you implement a quality management program, your
goal is to improve quality to the highest reasonable degree. In this chapter, we’ll look
at some of the ways you can build quality into your project without implementing
an additional quality management program. However, other quality management
programs are compatible with IT project management, so if your company has
implemented a quality program, what you learn in this chapter will ﬁt in nicely.
Now that you’ve read Chapters 5 and 6 and have deﬁned and organized your
project, you’re ready to look at the components of quality in your project. When
you’ve completed this chapter, you may choose to go back and reﬁne/redeﬁne some
of the elements you’ve developed so far and that’s ﬁne. IT project management is an
iterative process and making a quick second pass through the existing project mate-
rials developed to this point can be helpful. On the other hand, you may ﬁnd that
you’ve already gotten your project off to a good start and can continue forward into
your project planning stages.
As we did in Chapters 5 and 6, let’s begin by seeing exactly where we are.
Figure 7.1 shows the IT project management overview and where we are in that
process.

Figure 7.1 IT Project Management Process Overview
Quality is built into an IT project in three primary ways: planning, monitoring,
and testing. We’ll look at each of these areas in this chapter and then refer to them
again in later chapters.The planning, monitoring, and testing elements occur in dif-
ferent phases of the project, so we’ll revisit some of these topics again when we
come to those stages of the project process. Let’s also deﬁne a few terms before we
head into the rest of the chapter.
■
Baseline The data used as a reference with which to compare future
observations or results.
■
Benchmarking The process of setting a baseline or standard for analysis
and comparison of future results or performance.

cate similar functional, but different technical speciﬁcations. Grade A and

Grade B may work exactly alike, but one has different technical speciﬁca-
tions than the other.
■
Quality The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulﬁll
requirements. Quality is deﬁned through functional speciﬁcations.The
user’s perception of quality is inﬂuenced by both functional and technical
speciﬁcations (how well the project results conform to user expectations in
terms of function and errors/defects).
Quality Overview
Let’s begin with a deﬁnition of the word quality. If you look up the word quality in
the dictionary, you’ll see a number of deﬁnitions. However, the one best suited to IT
project management is “the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulﬁll
requirements.” Notice it doesn’t say that it’s the absolute pinnacle, but the degree to
which requirements are fulﬁlled. Requirements…sounds familiar, doesn’t it? 
Quality Versus Grade
It’s also important to distinguish between quality and grade. Low or poor quality is
always a problem, but low grade is not necessarily a problem. Grade is the category
assigned to products or results to indicate similar functional, but different technical
speciﬁcations. For instance, if you’re building a house and you want it to be a luxury
house from top to bottom, you might specify that the ﬁxtures will be made of 14
karat gold. However, once you develop your budget, you realize those ﬁxtures are
busting your budget and you decide to use a lower grade ﬁxture made of burnished
brass. Functionally those ﬁxtures may be identical, but their technical speciﬁcations are
different.The same is true of a software program. It might be very high quality with
very few errors or bugs, but if it has very limited functionality, it might be consid-
ered a low-grade product. Conversely, we’ve all worked with products that might be
considered high grade but low quality—they have features galore, but nothing works
as well as it should or as advertised. Obviously then, quality and grade are related in
the user’s mind and it is the job of the IT project manager and project team to
develop standards or speciﬁcations that deliver the required quality and grade.
Quality Management Components
There are numerous quality management systems used by companies today and
everything we’ll talk about in this chapter is aligned or consistent with these systems.
If your company has implemented Total Quality Management (TQM), Six Sigma, or
www.syngress.com
Quality From the Ground Up • Chapter 7
287

even ISO standards (to name a few), you can easily incorporate those quality systems
into your IT project management process.There are four main components to
quality management and these elements are consistent across all systems:
1.
User satisfaction
2.
Prevention versus correction
3.
Continuous improvement
4.
Management commitment
User Satisfaction
We’ve repeatedly mentioned the importance of user satisfaction.There are two com-
ponents of user satisfaction.The ﬁrst is one we’ve discussed, which is that the deliv-
erables from the project meet user requirements. If you’ve done a good job deﬁning
requirements (Chapters 6 and 9), your project should deliver what you and the users
agree it should deliver.The second component is that the requirements must be cor-
rect, meaning that the ﬁnal result must actually satisfy the user’s real (and not per-
ceived) needs.This is the difference between “must have” and “would like to have”
in the user world. If your project fails to deliver on the “must have” requirements,
the project will be perceived by the user as less than successful (or a total failure alto-
gether). Quality (errors, defects) and grade (functionality) are closely related in the
user’s mind as well. Grade is set through user requirements and quality is determined
by how well the project conforms to those requirements.
Prevention Versus Correction
The old saying “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” is certainly true
when it comes to quality. It’s always easier and more beneﬁcial to build quality into
your project from the beginning.To go back once the project is underway or worse,
to handle quality in the quality testing procedures as the end of your project, is the
least desirable way of approaching quality. It is less costly and less time consuming to
build quality into the project than to go back and try to correct things after the pro-
ject is underway (or nearly completed). Quality management systems focus on pre-
venting quality problems rather than correcting them. We’ll discuss the cost of
quality in more detail in a moment.
www.syngress.com
288
Chapter 7 • Quality From the Ground Up

Continuous Improvement
Continuous improvement is another component of quality management.You may be
familiar with the plan-do-check-act cycle (part of many quality systems).The point is
that the process is continuous, or iterative, and you create your plans, go do your
project, check the results, and take appropriate action to improve your project plan-
ning processes.
Management Commitment
If you recall from our discussion back in Chapter 1, projects that are most often suc-
cessful are those with executive support.This is especially true when it comes to
quality. If your company’s focus is to get the project out the door as soon as possible
and it does not value or emphasize planning, the quality of the ﬁnished product will
likely suffer. Management or executives must be willing to make the investments in
the project to ensure quality; this includes giving the project (and project team)
enough time, money, and resources to get the job done right. Certainly there are
limits on all of those, but a quality management approach recognizes that the project
team cannot be held completely or solely responsible for quality; it is the responsi-
bility of management to support quality efforts.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
If you want to deliver a quality project to your sponsor, project stake-
holders, and users, you’ll need to make sure management is aligned
with your view of quality. Otherwise, you’ll be specifying certain level of
quality while your management team delays or denies requests for the
resources you need to deliver on those quality commitments. If that hap-
pens, your project is going to wobble without the necessary resources to
generate a quality result. There’s only so much you can do with glue and
rubber bands.
The process of planning for quality is depicted in Figure 7.2.As you can see, the
initial project plan is one of two inputs to quality planning.The second input is your
company’s quality policy. If your company does not have a quality policy, you may
still have some idea of the level of quality your company expects and what it will
typically take to deliver that expected level of quality. If your company doesn’t have a
formal quality policy, you can write up your thoughts about expected level of
quality and use those as the second input to this process, if desired.

Figure 7.2 IT Project Quality Planning Phase
Within the quality planning phase or process, there are six distinct steps that
we’ll outline here and then discuss in more detail in this chapter.
1.
INPUTS The approved initial project plan is one of two inputs for this
phase.Although you could begin planning quality as you begin deﬁning
and organizing your project, you can also start at this point once you have a
fairly well deﬁned project.The second input is information or speciﬁcations
from your company’s corporate quality policy, if you have one. Many com-
panies do not have a quality policy, but if one exists, you can use it as a
second input to your quality planning process.
2.
ACTION The quality planning process is an overarching process that
impacts all phases of your project planning.There is always a tradeoff
between the cost and beneﬁt of quality.The beneﬁts are typically less
rework and higher user satisfaction.The cost is often captured in additional
planning, monitoring, and testing.There is a balance between the two and
often this balance is deﬁned by a corporate quality policy, if one exists.
Benchmarking provides a basis against which you can measure quality per-
formance in the project.Analyzing the estimated cost of quality involves
capturing the cost to build quality into the project as well as the costs of
poor quality. For instance, quality costs might involve the cost of planning
www.syngress.com
290
Chapter 7 • Quality From the Ground Up

to avoid errors and rework.The cost of poor quality might involve lost
sales, poor company reputation, rework and after-release ﬁxes.
At any point during the quality planning process, you may need to go
back to your initial project plan to make revisions or you may need to go
all the way back to your users and project sponsor for clariﬁcation and/or
negotiation on certain points. If you recall from Chapter 6, when creating
the requirements you may ﬁnd through your quality planning process that
you cannot reasonably deliver some of the requirements at the speciﬁed or
desired quality levels. Remember, too, that quality is one of the four key
project elements: scope, time, cost, and quality. If quality must be increased,
it means that something else will have to change—usually time or cost will
increase. In some cases, scope may decrease and this is where negotiating
with either the users or the project sponsor becomes key to project success.
3.
OUTPUT The result of this process is the overall quality plan. It contains
the information that will allow you to plan, monitor, and test quality
throughout the remainder of the project.This plan can contain a wide array
of data, depending on your project and how your company operates.Three
typical components of any quality plan are quality objectives, quality metrics,
and quality checklists. We’ll discuss these in more detail later in this chapter.
4.
ACTION The overall quality plan should be integrated into the initial
project plan and prepared for review by the project sponsor.
5.
CHECKPOINT The checkpoint of this phase is the approval of the
revised initial project plan (which now contains a quality component).Any
revisions to the initial project plan should be approved by the project
sponsor and stakeholders before proceeding.You may also need to clarify or
revise additional elements of the plan based on sponsor or stakeholder feed-
back or requirements. Hopefully, this step will result in only minor changes
to your plan and not a major revision.
6.
NEXT STEP Once you have an approved, revised initial project plan,
you can move into the planning stages where you and the project team will
develop the project details.This is discussed in Chapter 9, after we discuss
putting together your project team in Chapter 8. Remember, too, that there
may be times when you’ve gone through all these steps and may have
determined that the project is not viable and should be terminated. For
instance, if given the scope, time, and cost you will be unable to deliver
anything close to the quality expected, you may choose to delay or termi-
nate the project. If your budget is suddenly slashed or the scope is dramati-

Quality From the Ground Up • Chapter 7
291

cally increased, you may decide to terminate this project and go back and
start from scratch so you can better deﬁne and organize your project with
these drastically different parameters.
The Cost of Quality
There have been numerous studies done on the costs associated with higher and lower
quality. Many in the IT world have focused on software development.While there are
many other kinds of IT projects that require quality, we’re going to look just at soft-
ware development for the moment, in part because the statistics are readily available
and in part because we can all relate to using software that works well and software
that drives us nuts due to errors and bugs. Many studies have been done, but the one
mentioned at the opening of this chapter by IBM is signiﬁcant. It’s hard to argue with
an ROI of over 400% for implementing a software process improvement program.
There’s additional data that supports the statistics cited earlier. Figure 7.3 shows the
Rayleigh probability distribution (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_distribu-
tion for more on this subject) and a picture is worth a thousand words in this case.

Clearly, defects in the design (which come directly from requirements) are far
less expensive to ﬁx earlier in the process. If you wait until the project result (in this
case, a software program) is released to the customer, the cost is 100 times what it
would have been back in the design stage for issues discovered by the user.The same
type of cost structure applies to all types of IT projects.You have to begin with solid
requirements and you have to use the processes, procedures, and metrics speciﬁed
within the project to deliver a quality product at the other end. Whether your IT
project involves improving network security through better intrusion and detection
or upgrading servers or implementing supply chain management tools or integrating
legacy applications with the Web, your IT project will beneﬁt greatly from imple-
menting an IT project management system (described in this book) and possibly
other quality management systems appropriate to your company, industry, and focus.
If you recall, in Chapter 1 we mentioned that it’s been estimated that 50% to
75% of the total cost of any project is due to errors, rework, and omissions.The
errors, rework, and omissions happen throughout the project lifecycle, but the sooner
they are discovered, the less expensive they are to repair.The corollary to that is that
the fewer there are to begin with, the lower the cost and higher the quality of the
ﬁnal project.
Enterprise 128 …
Quality Versus Grade
Think back to our story of Enterprise 128, the early-to-market home computer
that failed to ﬁnd a following (see Chapter 1 for the whole story). Based on what
you’ve learned in this chapter so far, what would you say the problem was? The
problem was primarily one of grade. We have no idea what the quality of the
product was from the perspective of whether or not it generated errors, had
buggy software or hardware, halted, overheated, or crashed, and we don’t know
what how the requirements were written (how many errors/defects were accept-
able?). We don’t know any of that. What we do know is that the machine had all
kinds of functionality the user didn’t need or want. From the user perspective,
then, the quality was probably not as much the issue as was the grade. It had too
much functionality. The technical speciﬁcations were apparently not derived from
the functional speciﬁcations generated through thorough market research or
interviews with prospective users, but were apparently derived from what a few
engineers thought would be fun, useful, or cool. Even if that machine had zero

errors, never crashed, and never so much as hiccoughed, it wasn’t useful to users
and never really took off. A lower grade product would have done the trick—if
only the inventors had known, they might now be where Michael Dell is.
Planning Quality
The best way to ensure the quality of the project deliverables or results is to plan
quality into each step. We’ve discussed this already to some degree, but let’s take a
few minutes here to review where this occurs in the deﬁning, organizing, and plan-
ning stages.
User Requirements
We discussed user requirements in Chapter 6, so we won’t revisit that material, but
we will add some important distinctions to it. Earlier we talked about the difference
between quality and grade. We said that quality has to do with the number of errors
or defects in the ﬁnal product and grade has to do with the functionality of the
results. In the user’s mind, the two may be exactly the same thing or the user(s) may
have difﬁculty discerning the difference between the two. What matters is that you
and your project team understand the difference between quality and grade and can
work effectively with the users to deﬁne user requirements that are achievable by the
project and project team.
Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe what the project’s deliverables must do. It includes
statements and metrics about features, performance, speed, ease of use, workﬂow,
usability (interface, look and feel), data or input requirements, access and security
requirements, and output requirements (reports, exports).These are the things the
user typically cares most about and these are what create the user’s initial impression
of quality. If the software product cannot produce reports and all the user cares about
is reports, the functional requirements were incorrect or poorly developed (or the
user, despite repeated rounds of interviews and questions, failed to mention reports
as a “must have” requirement until the project was delivered….). How the reports
are generated would fall under the technical requirements, which are derived from
the functional requirements.
www.syngress.com
294
Chapter 7 • Quality From the Ground Up

Technical Requirements
Technical requirements follow functional requirements.After clearly deﬁning func-
tional requirements for your IT project, you and your team can develop the related
technical requirements.These can include all necessary requirements and speciﬁca-
tions that allow your project team to develop the project’s deliverables.These typi-
cally include things such as speciﬁc hardware, software and network requirements,
error handling and logging, capacity, redundancy, reliability, interoperability, scala-
bility, portability, security, storage, and monitoring, among many others. Clearly
deﬁning technical requirements in an IT project can only be done after the IT pro-
ject is initially deﬁned and organized and requirements (including user, functional,
business, and others discussed in Chapter 6) have been gathered, compiled, and
agreed upon.You may ﬁnd that you can begin creating technical requirements earlier
in the planning process and proceed in parallel with the other planning processes,
but make sure you don’t get ahead of yourself. Creating technical requirements for
requirements that are not yet locked in or agreed to/approved can cause a lot of
wasted time and rework.
Acceptance Criteria
We discussed developing acceptance criteria in Chapter 6.These criteria are typically
used between a vendor and a client as a method of specifying what makes a deliver-
able acceptable to the client.This, in turn, is often used by the vendor as the trigger
for billing the client for that deliverable or phase of the project.Acceptance criteria
specify the essential elements and conditions for the project’s deliverables to be
accepted by the user.The deﬁnition of acceptance criteria clearly can increase or
decrease the cost of quality. While you and your IT project team want to deliver the
highest possible quality within the requirements of the project, you should use cau-
tion here when developing acceptance criteria with the user/client.
Overengineering acceptance criteria can mean having to deliver more quality than is
needed and at a premium. If ten errors in a million transactions are acceptable, don’t
sign up for ﬁve errors in a million.The incremental cost of reducing errors from ten
to ﬁve could be huge and it’s not required for the project to be successful.
Quality Metrics
Quality metrics are speciﬁc, measurable, quantiﬁable measurements related to the
quality of the project. Metrics leave no room for guessing. For example, rather than
asking whether the product shipped on time, which might yield a yes/no answer
based on someone’s perception, you would ask what day and time the product
www.syngress.com
Quality From the Ground Up • Chapter 7
295

shipped. With an IT project, then, you might specify how much downtime is accept-
able or how much uptime is required, or you might specify the failure rate threshold
or the average bandwidth or speed that must be met. Metrics are used in both the
quality monitoring and quality testing phases of the project, so deﬁning them during
the planning phase makes sense.As you develop additional project details, you may
revise your quality metrics.
Quality Checklist
The term we use at this point in the project planning is quality checklist, which is a
list used to verify that a required set of steps has been completed. Later in this book
we’ll use the term completion criteria when we begin talking about the speciﬁc tasks in
the project. Completion criteria are usually listed (as a checklist) within the notes
section of each task to ensure that each task was completed according to require-
ments and speciﬁcations. We can use the terms quality checklist and completion cri-
teria interchangeably, but for our purposes, the quality checklist at this point will be
much higher-level (less detailed) than the completion criteria you’ll develop later in
your planning process.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
These aren’t the only tools at your disposal for managing quality in your
project, but these are some of the most commonly used. The key is to
determine what constitutes a quality result and ﬁgure out which processes
and measurements will get you there. If you have some analyst types on
your project team, this can be a good area to assign them to—they’ll
relish the opportunity to develop systems and metrics to deliver quality,
but watch that they don’t overdo it. Keep in mind the tradeoff between
quality and time/cost to make sure your project hits the sweet spot.
Monitoring Quality
Once you’ve planned quality right into the project, your job as IT project manager is
to manage and monitor quality while the project is underway. Some project manage-
ment systems call this stage quality assurance (QA). In later chapters, we’ll discuss man-
aging the project once it gets started and the processes and procedures you deﬁned in
all the steps leading up to that point will come into play.We’ll mention some of the
www.syngress.com
296
Chapter 7 • Quality From the Ground Up

tools you’ll be using to monitor quality in your project, but we won’t go into detail at
this point to avoid redundancy. Look for these topics in later chapters.
Quality Management Plan
As the project gets underway, the quality management plan is one of the inputs to
this phase as part of the overall project plan.The quality management plan describes
how quality will be planned, monitored, and tested, so it should be available
throughout the project life cycle.
Quality Metrics
We discussed quality metrics earlier and deﬁned them as those speciﬁc, measurable
items that deﬁne the level of required quality and the measurements used to validate
those levels.These should be used during the management of the project and may also
be used as part of the completion criteria for tasks that we’ll discuss in Chapter 9.
Project Processes and Procedures
The processes and procedures you deﬁned in Chapter 6 are an integral part of man-
aging quality during the project work. Deﬁned processes and procedures help you
and the project team keep track of key data, metrics, results, and issues. Without well
deﬁned, easy-to-use processes and procedures, the quality of the project is at risk due
to errors, oversights, and omissions. Quality can also suffer if there are too many use-
less, confusing, or contradictory processes and procedures in place because the pro-
ject team may spend more time on procedure than on making sure they deliver
quality results. Quality auditing may be a process or procedure in place at your com-
pany through an existing quality management program or through other means. If
so, your quality auditing procedures may include process auditing to ensure that the
processes used generate the required quality.
Status Reporting
Status reporting is another element that can assist in managing quality during the pro-
ject. Understanding actual versus planned performance helps you and the project team
make needed corrections during the project to ensure quality metrics and require-
ments are met.This information can also be useful during a post-project audit to
locate the source of quality problems that might surface after the project’s completion.

Issue Tracking
Issue tracking is critical to project quality because issues, by deﬁnition, put the pro-
ject at risk.Anytime the project is at risk, the project quality is at risk as well.
Tracking issues is not just a matter of deﬁning what constitutes an issue and making
a note of issues as they arise. In order to deliver a quality project result, you also
need to effectively manage issues.That means that someone must be assigned as the
owner so the issue is tracked, researched, analyzed, and resolved in a timely and rea-
sonable manner. Issues that just get left behind in the logbook are quality problems
in the making.An effective issue tracking system is critical to project quality.
Change Management
In Chapter 6, we discussed change management and the importance of developing a
change management process that helps you manage change requests for the project.
All requests for modiﬁcation scope, time, cost, quality, or work methods should be
analyzed for their effect on the project and in particular, their effect on project
quality.All changes requests should be formally documented and submitted to the IT
project manager.The project team should discuss the requested changes to determine
the impact on the project and the beneﬁts and risks of implementing the change. If
the change is agreed to, it should be incorporated into the project plan.Any ele-
ments of the quality plan impacted by the change should be updated as well,
including testing speciﬁcations for the changed elements. One last note about
change management: poor change management almost always results in poor project
quality. If you don’t maintain control over the project’s scope, time, budget, quality,
and tasks, you have little chance of turning in a successful project.

Cheat Sheet…
Quality Assurance and Quality Control
Some companies use the term quality assurance to indicate the activities that are
undertaken during the project to ensure quality results. This can be deﬁned as
the application of planned, systematic quality activities to ensure the project
meets requirements. Some companies also use the term quality control (QC),
which involves monitoring project results to ensure they meet requirements.
These activities also occur during the project work cycle as well as at the com-
pletion of tasks, phases, or the entire project itself. If your company uses a quality
management system, you may use other terminology, but the bottom line is that
you have to plan quality into the project and then keep your eye on it throughout
the project’s life.
Testing Quality
As the saying goes,“You can’t test quality into a product.” During and after the pro-
ject, you must test the results (interim and ﬁnal) against the quality metrics and
requirements speciﬁed to ensure the project is on track. No one in their right mind
would create a project schedule and then look at it again on the ﬁnal due date.The
same holds true with quality.You can’t just aim for quality then test it after all is said
and done.You’ll need to test for quality all along the way. In many IT projects, there
is also a distinct quality testing process or phase a project goes through before the
ﬁnal product or deliverable is handed off to the user. It is during testing (both during
and after the project work phase) that you hope to ﬁnd any errors or defects that
may have slipped through the process.The worst and usually most costly time to ﬁnd
errors or defects is once the project’s deliverables have been handed over to the user,
but the second worst time to ﬁnd them is in the ﬁnal testing phase, since it is always
more expensive and more difﬁcult to go back and ﬁx problems at this point.As with
monitoring quality, we’ll discuss some of the quality testing components here to
introduce you to terminology and concepts.
Prevention and Inspection
We mentioned earlier in this chapter that prevention is always more effective than
inspection because you can’t retroﬁt quality into a project; it has to be there from the
www.syngress.com
Quality From the Ground Up • Chapter 7
299

beginning. Preventing errors and rework is always the goal, but there is a tradeoff
between the level of desired quality and the cost.That tradeoff must be taken into
account both from a user perspective and from a corporate perspective.You may be
able to prevent 99.99% of all project errors, but the cost of the project results might be
one hundred times what the market would pay for such a product. Inspection is how
you ensure that your error/defect prevention is working and that your processes and
procedures are generating the desired results. By periodically and thoroughly inspecting
project results, you can ensure that the quality requirements and metrics are being met
throughout the work of the project. Inspection also gives you the opportunity to make
minor corrections before things veer too far off course. Inspection is sometimes
referred to as project auditing, project review, and peer reviews.
Deﬁned Quality Testing Procedures
Some IT projects require (and utilize) deﬁned quality testing procedures. For
instance, a software development project may have a dedicated quality control team
responsible for designing tests that will put the software through its paces at each
development stage and at the end of development. If your team or company has a
deﬁned quality testing procedure, it would be included in this phase.
Sampling
In some IT projects, sampling the project results is part of quality testing activities.
Rather than inspecting every single line of code or every single network interface,
you can achieve quality control at a lower cost through effective sampling techniques.
Discussing sampling techniques is outside the scope of this book, but they are men-
tioned as a potentially useful tool you and your IT team may want to investigate.
Analysis
Analyzing project results throughout the project work cycle can also yield higher
quality results. For instance, if an error or defect occurs in one area, analyzing the
root cause or source may help reduce or avoid errors in another area.Analyzing the
technical performance as well as the impact of errors or defects along the way can
yield information you can use to ﬁnetune your project moving forward to further
reduce errors.
Issue Resolution
Reviewing how issues are resolved is another component of quality testing.As you
recall, issues should not only be tracked, they must also be resolved.The resolution of
www.syngress.com
300
Chapter 7 • Quality From the Ground Up

issues can point to areas of improvement in project processes and procedures or in
other areas of the project.The action taken to resolve an issue can be helpful in
improving other parts of the project and avoiding errors, omissions, and rework in
subsequent phases of work. However, it’s also true that the steps taken to resolve an
issue may create a potential quality problem, so you should have a process in place to
validate or test resolutions before they’re implemented. Sometimes problems are
simply solutions gone bad.
Cheat Sheet…
People, Technology, and Business
Remember that every IT project involves people, technology, and business. When
you’re developing your quality plans, make sure you keep these three factors in
mind. Ask yourself, how can people contribute to the quality of this project? How
can technology contribute to the quality of this project? How can our business
contribute to the quality of this project (business processes, vendors, external
relationships, and expertise are just a few ideas). When you look at these three
areas for contributions to quality, you’re bound to ﬁnd a few that cost you
nothing (or next to nothing) that you might otherwise have missed.
As the result of working through the steps in this chapter, you should have a
solid quality management plan in place.This should be incorporated into you initial
project plan so it can be an integral part of your project planning moving forward.
Figure 7.3 depicts the outcome of this step, which is a quality management plan
within the initial project plan.

Summary
Quality and grade are two key components of the user’s perception of quality, but
they have distinctly different characteristics. Understanding the difference between
quality and grade can help tremendously when working with users to deﬁne
requirements and acceptance criteria. Quality is less expensive to plan into a project
than to try to retroﬁt in once the project is underway, but there is always a tradeoff
between the level of required quality and the cost to deliver that quality. Costs
include the various efforts required to meet quality levels, including project work
itself as well as quality monitoring and testing processes.The higher the level of
required quality, the more rigorous the work, monitoring, and testing procedures
must be, and that almost always comes at a higher cost.
The cost of poor quality must also be taken into account because this is often
missed in the planning stages. What will happen if your product reaches the cus-
tomer/user with too many errors, bugs, or defects? Will you have to tear things apart
and redo them? Will you have lost a customer? Will your company be viewed nega-
tively in the marketplace? Will the project team suffer negative consequences? It’s
important to understand the downside of poor quality as well as the cost of deliv-
ering high quality.
The three key components to quality are planning, monitoring, and testing.
Based on what you’ve learned in this chapter, you may want to go back into your
initial project plan and reﬁne requirements, acceptance criteria, or other
processes/procedures to build more quality processes into your project.As we move
into the planning phase of the project in later chapters, we’ll revisit some of the con-
cepts presented in this chapter.
Don’t let the relatively short length of this chapter fool you. Building quality
into a project is of utmost importance, and using the deﬁned IT project manage-
ment process you’re learning in this book is a major part of what drives quality.
Consistent, repeatable processes that help you do a better job each step of the way is
what IT project management is all about, so you’re learning a methodology that
will, by its very nature, help you deliver higher quality at a lower cost.The additional
elements in this chapter are discussed throughout this book, so rather than bore you
to tears with redundant information, we’re giving you the short version here and
we’ll revisit these topics again in more detail.

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
You may want to create a checklist based on the major headings in this
chapter for use during your project planning and implementing phases
so you are constantly reminded of the things that drive quality in your
project. Many activities that drive quality in a project are fairly easy to
do; they often just require an additional step or two or sometimes they
simply require that you pay attention.

Quality Overview
 Quality and grade are two components of a user’s experience or perception
of quality.
 Most quality management systems include four major components: User
satisfaction, prevention versus correction, continuous improvement, and
management commitment.
 Your quality plan should be a component of your overall project plan and
should be incorporated into the plan review and approval process.
Planning Quality
 User requirements are the basis of deﬁning and delivering quality in a
project. User requirements must be balanced against the cost of delivering
the required/desired level of quality.
 Functional speciﬁcations deﬁne what the product or deliverable should do.
Technical speciﬁcations deﬁne how the product or deliverable should
achieve that functionality.Technical requirements are developed from the
functional requirements.
 Acceptance criteria are used to gain agreement between the project team
and the user/customer as to what constitutes fulﬁllment of requirements.
 Quality metrics are speciﬁc measurements to determine if the project’s
deliverables meet requirements.
www.syngress.com
Quality From the Ground Up • Chapter 7
303

 A quality checklist can be developed (detailed or high-level) to use
throughout the life of the project to ensure project quality is maintained.
Some people use the terms quality checklist and completion criteria
interchangeably.
Monitoring Quality
 A quality management plan deﬁnes all the elements that will drive quality
in the project including those in the planning, monitoring, and testing
phases. It deﬁnes activities that will occur during the project work phase to
ensure quality results.
 Quality metrics provide measurable ways of determining if a project
deliverable has met requirements.
 Processes and procedures help drive quality during the work phase of the
project.The processes and procedures deﬁned throughout this book help
ensure quality results by providing a framework for consistent effort and
evaluation.
 Status reporting and issue tracking are part of the quality monitoring
process during the work phase of the project.
 Change management helps ensure quality results by closely monitoring and
managing any and all requested changes to the project’s work (scope, time,
budget, quality, tasks, etc.). Poor change management typically results in
poor project quality.
Testing Quality
 Prevention is the process of planning quality into the project. Inspection is
the process of verifying the planned quality is being achieved.Testing is the
third component of quality in an IT project used to verify the quality of
results.
 Deﬁned quality testing procedures may exist for your IT project, based on
the type and nature of the project. Some IT projects use a dedicated quality
control (testing) team to test the results of the project at each step or phase
and to test/verify the overall/ﬁnal quality of the project.
 Sampling can be a good method of testing project results without having to
spend time or money to test every single component.Testing a random
www.syngress.com
304
Chapter 7 • Quality From the Ground Up

sampling can generate almost the same accuracy as testing every single
component, but at a fraction of the cost/effort.
 Analyzing project results as you go can also help increase quality and
reduce the cost of the project. Determining the source or cause of a
problem can help you avoid that same problem later in the project.
 Issue resolution can be helpful to look at during quality testing because it
may point you to methods to improve quality in other areas of the project
based on the resolution taken for a speciﬁc issue. On the other hand, the
steps taken to resolve an issue may create a potential quality problem, so
resolutions must be tested before being implemented.
Q: Our company uses Six Sigma and it seems that it conﬂicts in some ways with
IT project management. Is that true?
A: No, any quality management system can work side by side with IT project
management. In some cases, you may want to modify the IT project manage-
ment practices deﬁned in this book simply to avoid redundancy.The point of
Six Sigma is to reduce errors.The point of IT project management is to
deliver a more successful project, part of which involves delivering the
highest required quality at the lowest cost (time and money) possible.They
are quite compatible, so if you ﬁnd conﬂicting areas, examine them closely
and resolve them in a way that meets your company’s criteria. However,
there’s a good bet that upon closer examination, you won’t ﬁnd areas that are
completely incompatible.
Q: I’ve had a long-running debate with a colleague about quality and the dis-
cussion in this chapter on quality versus grade clariﬁed things greatly. Why
isn’t grade discussed more often? It’s so important in decision making.

Frequently Asked Questions
The following Frequently Asked Questions, answered by the author of this book,
are designed to both measure your understanding of the concepts presented in 
this chapter and to assist you with real-life implementation of these concepts. To

www.syngress.com/solutions and click on the “Ask the Author” form. 

A: Quality and grade are closely related, as you saw in our earlier discussion,
and, from a user’s point of view, there may be no difference. If you purchase a
ﬁnancial software program for your personal use, do you differentiate
between how many bugs you experience and the fact that it won’t export
your data to your favorite spreadsheet program? You probably don’t, nor do
most users. However, one is a quality issue (bugs) and one is a grade issue
(lack of an export capability), but to you, as the frustrated user, they are both
elements of quality.The distinction between quality and grade really becomes
important in for the IT project team when helping to develop requirements
and acceptance criteria.The reason why no one discusses the difference
between quality and grade might be because so few IT project teams use a
deﬁned IT project management methodology (you may be the exception
since you’re reading this book).
Q: You mention quality metrics several times, but we’ve never used quality met-
rics. Can you explain how we can develop speciﬁc quality metrics for our IT
project?
A: If you’ve never used speciﬁc metrics, you may have actually made things
harder on yourselves than necessary.Think about connecting a new commu-
nications line to your ofﬁce building.You might say that in order for it to
meet quality requirements it must provide a fast Internet connection to the
1200 users in your building.That sounds good, but what happens when the
line the vendor installs is so bad that the error rate is so high that the
Internet connection for your users crawls to a halt? How do you quantify
this with the vendor? You can’t very well say,“It’s just too slow!” One way to
begin to develop metrics is to ﬁgure out what you’d want to use if this deliv-
erable was being delivered to you and you were paying someone external for
it. How would you measure it then? Most likely you’d use some sort of line
speed test with a minimum speed threshold and a maximum erro threshold
for the line. With a bit of digging, you can probably quantify some of the
quality statements you’ve made and turn them into meaningful quality 
metrics.
Q: Our company always says it wants quality, but when push comes to shove,
they want it cheaper and faster and quality goes out the window.Any 
suggestions?

Chapter 7 • Quality From the Ground Up

A: The unfortunate reality is that many companies give lip service to quality
and then do nothing to support it in the organization. Other companies truly
value quality and don’t realize the things they’re doing don’t support quality.
These are two distinctly different corporate personalities so try to discern
which it is ﬁrst. If your company truly doesn’t value quality, you have a huge
uphill battle, but you may have success in explaining how low quality costs
the company, directly and indirectly. If your company actually values quality,
but has processes, procedures, and cultural practices in place that undermine
quality, you have a better chance of catalyzing change in the organization.
Take it one step at a time and begin by implementing processes and proce-
dures in your IT projects that deliver quality. Since planning quality in is
almost always less expensive (time and money) than trying to ﬁx it later, your
project results will begin to speak for themselves.You can also make the busi-
ness case for quality and then work to change the processes and procedures
in your company that undermine quality results. Start small and build
momentum. Just implementing this IT project management methodology
could improve your results so much that people come to you asking how you
did it. Wouldn’t that make changing habits an easier sell?
Q: I like the idea of planning ﬁrst and creating code second, but what do I do
with the developers on the project until I am ready for them? I don’t want
them to be bored or get “stolen” for another project, and I don’t want my
developers to appear idle to my management since I don’t have anything tan-
gible to show for the project during all this planning.Any ideas?
A: You are correct in your concerns to ensure your team is busy doing useful
work while collecting requirements and developing the plan. Consider
tasking the developers with designing the test plans to ensure customer
requirements are met.Two big beneﬁts: First, the developers gain an under-
standing of the bigger picture and may have some good ideas on ways to
improve the process and second, by having your developers writing the
testing plans, you can be sure the code will do what the customer requires. If
your developers are still going to run out of things to do, consider doing a
phased start up where the development team is not fully engaged until you
are ready for them or ask the developers to help in designing a method to
track issues found, but be careful here—you don’t want to spawn a project
within a project to design and develop a whole new bug tracking system
when your company probably already has a working solution for you to use.

Introduction
Some IT projects have the same project team from start to ﬁnish, while others have
changing personnel throughout the various stages of the project.At some point,
whether it’s at the very inception of the project or somewhere after the project deﬁ-
nition and organization, you’ll need to put together your project team. While you
could theoretically put your team together after you’ve planned the whole project,
you’d be starting it off on the wrong foot. Ideally, the project team should be
involved in the deﬁning, organizing, planning, execution, and assessment of the pro-
ject. While this is not always possible in the real world, it is what you should be
aiming for. Here’s why: a project team provides subject matter expertise you prob-
ably lack, ideas and perspectives different from your own, information and contacts
with others in the organization that are relevant to the project, and more heads and
hands to help get the project work done.
While all of these are essential for success, there is one additional element that
might be the single most important reason to get your project team on board early in
the project life cycle: ownership. If you’ve ever been handed a complete plan and told
to go implement it, you probably know just how your project team would feel if that
happened to them.You’re less than enthusiastic about the assignment because you had
no part in designing, developing, and planning it. In fact, the approach to the project
itself might be so different that you really have a hard time getting your arms around
it, even though you understand what’s outlined. People are far more likely to partici-
pate fully when they have a hand in the deﬁnition, organization, and planning of a
project.They’ll feel a sense of ownership and will usually work hard to ensure the
project is a success. Since the IT project manager is typically managing a team over
which they have little formal organizational authority, creating a sense of commit-
ment to the team and to the project is critical to actually being able to get the project
team to complete the project within the scope, time, cost, and quality required.
In Chapter 4, you learned a lot about why people work, what motivates them,
and how to work within a diverse team.You also learned what it takes to create a
high performance team, so if you skipped over Chapter 4, now may be a good time
to go back and read (or review) it. In this chapter, you’ll learn about how to put
together a project team and how to assign roles and responsibilities to team mem-
bers.You’ll also learn about how to track and manage performance and deliverables
and what to do if trouble arises. In Chapter 9 we’ll begin the detailed planning tasks
for the project, and having your project team in place and ready to go for these
planning tasks will be essential. If you put your project team together (or if some of
the team members have changed) at this point, you should review the deﬁnition and
organization with them and make any needed modiﬁcations prior to moving for-

ward.This will begin to build a sense of commitment to the project and may also
provide new information that helps make the project better. If your project team has
been with you from the start, you’ll be ready to hit the planning stage running. But,
don’t skip this chapter even if your team is formed; there are a few tips and tricks
you’ll ﬁnd helpful before moving on. Figure 8.1 shows where we are in our project
planning process.

Identifying Project Team Requirements
Let’s start with the big picture.Your project team will be comprised of subject matter
experts—people who can help deﬁne and deliver project results.These folks may be
from your IT department or they may be from many different departments in the
company.Your project team may rely on a mix of internal staff and external contrac-
tors. It may be comprised of people locally or globally.The ﬁrst step is to deﬁne the
kinds of people (skills, not personalities) you need, not the speciﬁc people you need.
In some companies, an initial project team works on deﬁning these requirements
and then members of the project team are added or removed as needed.
You can begin by looking at the overall environment and looking speciﬁcally at
these elements:
■
Organizational Which departments, divisions, or sections of the company
should be represented on the project team? Is there a budget issue (hiring
freeze, cutbacks, etc.) that could impact your project? What about unions or
collective bargaining issues that will impact team membership (or the pro-
ject itself)? 
■
Technical What are the different technical specialties that should be rep-
resented on the project team? Are there different types of technologies
(engineering approaches, software languages, equipment) that should be
represented or that will have to be coordinated?
■
Logistical Where are project team members located? Are they local,
remote, overseas? How will you coordinate their activities? Much of this
should have already been deﬁned in IT project team processes in Chapter 6.
■
Interpersonal What types of formal and informal relationships exist
among team members (or potential team members)? Are there known rela-
tionships you can leverage or known issues you can avoid?
■
Political What alliances exist among various stakeholders and how will
these inﬂuence your project (for better or for worse)? Are there any people
on the IT project team with political clout or any members on the team that
seem to be out of favor politically? How will this affect your IT project?
In addition to these environmental issues, there are additional things to think
about when you build your IT project team. Some of these elements may not be
relevant to every IT project, but going through these elements helps you make sure
you’re building the most optimal project team you can within the organizational
constraints. We all have experienced teams that had certain members because of 
www.syngress.com
312
Chapter 8 • Forming the IT Project Team

politics or because of the company’s organizational structure. While having these
kinds of people on your IT project team is not optimal, these team members can be
managed if you know what’s what.
You may want to develop an organizational chart showing the relationships of
potential or desirable team members so you can visualize the lay of the land.You
may prefer a simple matrix or grid to depict team members and responsibilities or
you may opt for the simple team roster.The key is to capture this list of current
and/or future IT project team members and have an understanding of the ﬁve ele-
ments described above.
Roles and Responsibilities
Once you’ve looked at the ﬁve environmental elements, you should then begin to
identify roles and responsibilities.Again, this can (and should) be done without a
speciﬁc individual in mind and it’s often better if you start out that way.The ten-
dency for most people is to identify people rather than roles, responsibilities, and
competencies. When you identify people, you may develop preconceived notions
about roles and responsibilities based upon that speciﬁc person. Ideally, you want to
identify roles, responsibilities, and competencies needed for the project then ﬁnd
people to ﬁll those roles.You can then add roles, responsibilities, and competencies to
your team list (org chart, matrix, or team roster). We’ll look at this in a bit more
detail in just a bit.
Competencies
Your IT project will undoubtedly require speciﬁc competencies throughout the life-
cycle of the project.These may change from one phase to another (and probably
will). Deﬁning the required competencies and mapping them to roles and responsi-
bilities can help you identify the speciﬁc people you’ll need to make your project
successful. If you deﬁne a software engineer role whose job it is to deﬁne end user
requirements, you’ll need to identify the speciﬁc competencies for that role such as
the ability to interact effectively with end users, the ability to translate functional
requirements into technical requirements, or the ability to negotiate with end users
to help develop requirements that are feasible and useful.
Another type of competency to keep in mind are the workstyles we discussed
earlier in the book. If you have a team full of analyst types, you won’t have a bal-
anced team.This can lead to blind spots (everyone thinking in the same way) and
can actually make it harder to manage the team. Whenever possible, try to create a
balanced team by including people who represent the four different workstyles we
discussed (see Chapter 4). By having each workstyle represented, you’ll gain access to
www.syngress.com
Forming the IT Project Team • Chapter 8
313

different viewpoints and different approaches to the project.This can help add to the
quality of your ﬁnal project and even make managing the team a bit easier.You’ll be
able to utilize the unique skills and talents that members bring to the team. For
instance, the analyst types can help deﬁne many of the details while others who may
be more interactive can help craft and manage the project communications, or work
with users.
Staff Availability
Now that you’ve identiﬁed your dream team, you have to ﬁnd out if they’re available
for your IT project. In smaller companies, it’s easy to determine if people are avail-
able or to shift things around so they will be available. In larger companies, it often is
a matter of competing for team members with other projects and other priorities. It
also means negotiating and working within a political framework to get the IT pro-
ject team members needed. If you need assistance, your project sponsor can often
help out by exerting his or her inﬂuence within the organization to help you get
needed staff resources. If you cannot acquire the talent and expertise needed to suc-
cessfully execute your project plan, your project is in serious jeopardy.This creates a
signiﬁcant risk to the project (we’ll discuss project risk in more depth later in the
book) and you should not proceed until you’ve addressed this problem in a satisfac-
tory manner.
Identifying Project Interfaces
Project interfaces describe all the ways your project team interacts with others.You
should think about how your IT project team members will need to interact with
others in the organization throughout the project lifecycle.This will help you iden-
tify contacts, liaisons, resources, and allies within the organization that will interact
with your project and project team. If you thoroughly identiﬁed stakeholders earlier,
you have a jumpstart on this process, though not all project interfaces are stake-
holders per se. For instance, you may need someone in the Payroll department to
create a project code and to work with team members to properly code timesheets
or other payroll information to be submitted.That person is not a stakeholder in the
IT project, but is clearly someone with whom the project team members will inter-
face.There may be other more signiﬁcant interfaces you identify at this point or they
could all have been identiﬁed during your stakeholder identiﬁcation process.

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
You may already have an established project team for your IT project and
if so, that’s ﬁne. You don’t need to reinvent the wheel, but do take a
moment to review the items just listed and compare them to your cur-
rent project team to make sure all your bases are covered. As you know,
once you’ve identiﬁed many of your IT project elements once, you can
reuse and repurpose much of that work over and over again to save
yourself time and effort. Just don’t fall into complacency. Check your
work against your formal process as you go to make sure you don’t acci-
dentally miss something that might be new or unique to this IT project.
Identifying Stafﬁng 
Requirements and Constraints
We brieﬂy discussed roles and responsibilities in an earlier section, but that was a
more generic list of desired or needed roles and responsibilities based on project
requirements. Now you need to identify speciﬁc people to ﬁll those roles and take on
those responsibilities.This often requires a bit of negotiation and salesmanship to get
the right people on board with the project. Selling the project doesn’t mean saying
things that are false or misleading. Just the opposite.You should be able to present
the project in a positive, enthusiastic manner and be prepared to describe the bene-
ﬁts to any team members that you need on the project. We all know that some team
members don’t really have a choice as to whether to participate in the project or
not, but others do have options and if you need their time, talent, or cooperation (or
you need their manager to release them to your project), you need to clearly make
the case for what’s in it for them. People don’t care as much about how you’ll ben-
eﬁt from their participation (well, everyone likes an ego boost now and then) as
much as they want to know what’s in it for them. If you can’t clearly state that, you
may have a hard time convincing them to participate. Forcing someone to work on
a project they don’t want to work on always yields sub-optimal results because you’ll
be dragging them along with the project rather than having them help lead the way.
Remember to look at stafﬁng requirements in terms of internal and external:
Internal/external to your IT group, to your division, to your location, or to your
company.You may need consultants, vendor experts, industry experts, legal or ﬁnan-
cial experts, or experts on governmental regulations to assist in your project. Make
sure you’ve looked thoroughly at your project requirements and deﬁned the roles
www.syngress.com
Forming the IT Project Team • Chapter 8
315

and responsibilities that will address all those requirements.Then look for the right
people to ﬁll those roles.
Constraints for stafﬁng come in many forms, as most of you already know.
Sometimes the ideal candidate is not available for another three months and the pro-
ject has to get underway next month. Sometimes the ideal candidate simply does not
exist. Sometimes you have two or three people who, together, have all the right skills
and talents you need, but you can’t grab all three for the project. Sometimes you
can’t seem to successfully navigate the political waters to acquire the talent you need.
The list goes on and on in terms of stafﬁng constraints.
Begin by identifying any known constraints, such as the need for a particular
skill or talent at a particular point in the project (remember, the project team may
shift over the lifecycle of the project as you move from one phase to the next). Keep
in mind that since you have not yet broken down your project into the work units
(we’ll do that in Chapter 9), you may not have a complete list of required skills at
this point.You may need to add or subtract resources once you’ve completed your
Work Breakdown Structure (see Chapter 9).
Next, determine if the skills and talents you’ve identiﬁed for your project exist
within your team, division, or company. If not, you’re going to have to go outside
the company for that skill. If the talent is internal, are they available for the project
and can you get them assigned to your project? If the talent is external, was this ﬁg-
ured into the project cost estimate and can you locate and afford to hire that talent?
If your project depends on a rare talent that only four people in the world have, you
not only will have more trouble locating, acquiring, and affording that talent, but
you also have identiﬁed another very serious project risk (again, we’ll tackle project
risk later on).
Be sure to review your requirements, especially legal, ﬁnancial, and governmental
to make sure you have the expertise on your IT project team to address these require-
ments.You may need to bring in your corporate attorney or accountant or you may
need to hire an industry or governmental expert to ensure you meet these types of
requirements.You may need to put some of your team through training to address the
need for speciﬁc expertise and we’ll talk more about training in just a bit.
If your IT project is being conducted in an environment where labor unions are
present, you may also have to contend with union requirements or regulations as a
stafﬁng constraint. For instance, if your IT project is developing a new program to
run a particular manufacturing machine and you’ll need to get the machinists to test
the program for you, you may have to work with union leadership to get this done
in a manner that complies with union rules and meets your IT project’s needs.

Chapter 8 • Forming the IT Project Team

Deﬁning Roles and Responsibilities
Once you’ve identiﬁed the people with various skills and talents you need repre-
sented on the IT project team and you’ve worked to acquire those folks for your
project, you need to organize them. By deﬁning clear roles and responsibilities, you
will create a framework within which team members can work. Most people like to
have clear roles, responsibilities, and boundaries so they know what they should (and
should not) do, what is and is not acceptable, and how to interact with others on the
team. Clearly deﬁned roles and responsibilities are absolutely essential for project
success.You may have created some of the needed framework when you deﬁned
project processes; there may be additional information needed to help team members
work in the most productive manner possible.
Rather than working with people’s organizational titles, you may choose to
deﬁne roles and responsibilities within the team structure.This can help create a
sense of being part of a team and can help reduce problems based on organizational
rank or title. For instance, if you have three people on the team that will all ﬁll the
same role (software engineer, for instance), call them “software engineer” for the pro-
ject even if each of them has a different ofﬁcial title within the organization.As with
the project itself, it may be helpful to deﬁne what is and is not included in each role.
Setting role boundaries will help avoid overlap, conﬂict, and confusion later.
Once you’ve deﬁned roles, you also need to deﬁne each role’s responsibilities.
Sometimes it’s helpful to work on this with the team, other times a group discussion
may simply lead to conﬂicts and arguments. Depending on the nature of your team,
you’ll have to decide the best course of action. If you deﬁne roles and responsibilities
for the team, you will need to run this by team members for two reasons.The ﬁrst
reason is that you may have inadvertently overlooked important information for
roles and responsibilities.The second is that by asking the team for input (and then
using it), you’ll help build the team’s ownership in the project. If you simply deﬁne
roles and responsibilities and hand them out, the team will have a much lower stake
than if they can provide input and ideas. Usually this process also yield more clarity
because team members can ask questions and clarify any gray areas.
Deﬁning responsibilities typically includes deﬁning deliverables or what each
team member will be responsible for accomplishing.Again, the more clarity you start
with, the better the result. Working with each member of the team to establish clear,
well-deﬁned responsibilities also helps ask and answer questions about conﬂicting
roles, responsibilities, and deliverables. Avoid overlapping responsibilities and work
with the team to clarify any issues before getting started on the project work itself.
These responsibilities and deliverables also become part of the performance review
proccess at project closeout (see Chapter 12 for details).

Another area to look at is required competencies. We discussed identifying
required competencies at the higher project level, but once you’ve begun looking at
speciﬁc people, you need to check your competencies requirements to make sure
that you’re getting the people with the skills you need.
Enterprise 128 …
Hot Projects and Hot Shots
Putting together a project team can sometimes be a very easy, pleasurable task—
especially when the project has high visibility or involves working with cutting-
edge technology. On the other hand, there are more utilitarian projects that
people will go to great lengths to avoid. These projects often need the same
skills, talents, and enthusiasm, but putting together a project team for a mun-
dane IT project can be a challenge. Here’s your mission: don’t go for the low
hanging fruit. You may be tempted to grab just about any warm body you can
for these lower priority, lower visibility projects, but that may put your project at
risk. Taking whoever’s available is the path of least resistance and yields the
results with the least luster. Some IT project managers don’t want to expend the
energy required to sell a less exciting project to their talented IT staff (or to others
outside the immediate environment), but that’s a mistake. Ideally, you should try
to ensure that assignments to exciting, highly visible projects are based, at least
to some degree, on past participation on the mundane projects. By establishing
a link between participation in mundane and exciting projects, you can help
ensure you get a good, talented, enthusiastic mix on all your IT projects—even
your brightest stars should spend time working on less exciting projects. 
Of course, things in the real world aren’t always ideal, but you have to start
someplace.
Acquiring Needed Staff
After you’ve deﬁned required skills and competencies and identiﬁed roles and
responsibilities, you have to go about pulling the team together before the project
starts. If your project team comes from within your IT team, then you really don’t
have much to think about here. On the other hand, if you’re pulling in resources
from other departments, divisions, or companies (vendors, consultants, contractors),
you have to give a lot of thought to how you pull it all together. First and foremost,
make contact with the person’s direct supervisor or manager and gain agreement
www.syngress.com
318
Chapter 8 • Forming the IT Project Team

about the person’s participation in the project. Sometimes a person may agree to
participate, but his or her manager has other plans such as other, higher priority
assignments or issues with the person’s work that you’re not aware of. Start by con-
tacting the person’s manager for an ofﬁcial OK.
If your project requires the use of outside expertise, you need to include a
stafﬁng expense in your project budget. If you did not include this type of expense
in your project estimate, make sure you add it now.You may also need to compare
actual labor rates to the ones you used for estimating to make sure they’re accurate.
If necessary, discuss any changes or issues with the project sponsor.
Next, you need to think about some of the immediate next steps for your team.
Here are a few additional considerations:
■
Where will the team work? Will people have to travel to a central location
for meetings or meet via phone or videoconference?
■
What is the procedure to formally pull someone onto the project? Which
managers need to be notiﬁed? How and when should they be notiﬁed? Are
there political issues involved?
■
What is the cost of each team member for the project and how will this be
accounted for? In some cases, you may only need to track hours against the
project. In other cases you may need to track speciﬁc payroll costs and will
have to work with Human Resources, Payroll, or Accounting to manage
this.
■
When will the team be formally tasked with the project work and when is
each team member available? Sometimes changing availability can impact
the start or progress of a project to a signiﬁcant degree.
■
If external people are required, you’ll need to identify how those people are
acquired. Will you go through a stafﬁng agency? Will you hire them on
full-time? How long will you need to ﬁnd and hire the speciﬁc skills and
talents your project will require? Working with an experienced recruiter
can help you answer many of these questions if you’re not experienced in
this regard.
■
What will you do if the project start date slips? Which resources will be at
risk? Which resources will be lost? What alternatives can you come up with
to manage this scenario?
One thing to keep in mind with your project team: sometimes you are assigned
people you’d rather not have on the team due to a variety of issues. For instance,
some departments may toss one of their worst performers your way just to get him
www.syngress.com
Forming the IT Project Team • Chapter 8
319

or her out of the way.They might give you their most contentious, least-knowledge-
able person or they might give you the person just about to be ﬁred. If you ﬁnd
yourself in a situation where you’ve been assigned someone who will be a serious
liability to the project (or even just a non-contributor), you should sit down with
your project sponsor and have an honest discussion. Don’t let deadweight land on
your project team without pushing back. In the end, you may not have any choice
but to accept this team member, but hopefully your project sponsor will be savvy
enough to understand the risks a non-performer brings to the project.You’ll need to
be tactful but honest with your project sponsor and most important, go prepared
with the name of the person or people you do want. Successful projects depend
upon a good project team and as the IT project manager, you should do your best to
make sure you don’t get stuck with any duds.
Cheat Sheet…
Good Technical Recruiters…
Worth Their Weight in Gold
Whether you’re trying to ﬁnd permanent IT staff or temporary technical people
for an IT project, you might consider establishing a relationship with an experi-
enced technical recruiting ﬁrm. Even if your job is not to directly ﬁnd or hire
people (that may be solely within the Human Resources department), it won’t
hurt for you to establish a relationship with a good technical recruiting ﬁrm or
technical recruiter. “A good recruiter has lots of contacts and resources and is a
great source when looking for part-time, temporary or temporary-to-permanent
IT staff,” explains Chris Landi, President of TekWork.com, a technical recruiting
company. “Rather than spending your time and money trying to advertise a posi-
tion in the “right” places, one call to a good recruiter can get it all done for you,
often with better results.” Once you establish a working relationship with a good
recruiter, your job of locating and retaining the right talent for your IT depart-
ment or for your IT project will be much easier. If your ﬁrm has an internal tech-
nical recruiter, you should certainly start there, but having an established contact
or two outside your own ﬁrm can help ﬁll the gaps.

Chapter 8 • Forming the IT Project Team

Forming the Team
You’ve now laid the groundwork for forming your IT team and should be ready to
go. Once you’ve identiﬁed the IT team members, you’re ready to ofﬁcially form
your team.As we discussed earlier, you’ll need to organize your team. Some of this
organization was discussed in Chapter 6 when we discussed how to organize your
project. However, we’ll brieﬂy review some of those elements and add a bit more
detail here. Remember, too, that once you’ve identiﬁed your work breakdown, your
team requirements may change.
Team Roster
Creating a team roster may seem like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised how many
times it’s overlooked. Create a team roster listing all the relevant information about
each team members and distribute it to your team.You may want to list this on a
team intranet site or simply distribute it as a text document via e-mail. Whatever
you do, make sure you create a roster and distribute it to facilitate team communica-
tion.You can download a team roster template to give you a head start.
Training
Once you’ve formed the project team, you may ﬁnd there is speciﬁc training needed
in order for the project to proceed.A good example of this is if you’re putting
together a hardware and software package for point of sales systems and the system
must track sales tax.The sales tax calculation will depend on local, state, and federal
tax rules and one or more member of your team may need to be trained in how this
works so that your systems will be fully compliant. Gather input from the team as
well to make sure you don’t overlook important training before the project gets
underway. Make sure this training has been reﬂected in your project budget estimate
and include the speciﬁc line item costs when you prepare your ﬁnal project budget,
which we’ll discuss later in this book. If you’re not sure if your team will require
training (or how much training), build in contingency funds for training. If the
training is triggered by using less experienced team members, you may also use this
cost as leverage to get more experienced people on your team. Sometimes the time
and cost of training is worth the investment (versus putting more experienced
people on the team), sometimes it’s not.This might be a point of discussion with the
project sponsor, if in doubt.

Forming the IT Project Team • Chapter 8
321

Processes and Procedures
You should already have deﬁned processes and procedures for your project, including
how the team will interact, how often it will meet, what types of status and data
reporting is needed, and how performance will be tracked and assessed.These should
be discussed with the team and any modiﬁcations to procedures should be discussed
and ﬁnalized.You want to have a fairly stable set of processes and procedures going
into your project so you’re not changing the rules in the middle of the project.
Ensure that all team members understand the processes, and how their performance
will be evaluated. When applicable, provide written documentation for reference.
Compliance
You should make sure that everyone is clear about legal, ﬁnancial, or regulatory
compliance issues. Since the team will soon begin working independently, it’s critical
that they understand these issues at the outset. It wouldn’t help the project or the
team to ﬁnd out later that something was out of compliance. In some cases it results
in rework, which adds time and cost to the project and can also reduce quality. In
other cases, it could result in serious legal or ﬁnancial repercussions. Preventing these
kinds of lapses is important. Educate the team on these issues prior to starting pro-
ject work to help everyone stay on track.
Team Meeting (Kick-Off Meeting)
Last, but not least, you should hold a project team meeting for the sole purpose of
getting everyone together and on board with the project. Some IT project managers
see this as an opportunity to get down to business, but if you can afford the time,
you should really allow the ﬁrst meeting to be more of a meet-and-greet.You should
use the ﬁrst team meeting to introduce everyone on the team (if they are not already
acquainted) and give everyone a chance to talk a bit about his or her background
and participation on this project.You should also discuss basic team information such
as the team roster (how/when you’ll distribute it), any team resources such as an
intranet site that will be utilized for communication and where team members can
ﬁnd project information moving forward. During the kick-off meeting, you should
review the project plan and objectives. Encourage team members to ask questions
and also encourage them to read the initial project plan (the plan thus far) and come
prepared with questions to a follow up meeting (or submit questions/comments via
e-mail). It’s important to begin creating a sense of ownership for the project plan as
well as to begin to gather team input so the project plan can be as solid as possible
before proceeding. Remember, should someone identify a major problem, don’t get
www.syngress.com
322
Chapter 8 • Forming the IT Project Team

an attitude.This is the point in your project planning that you want to ﬁnd problems
(if they exist). Encourage and reward that type of input from your new team to
create an environment that fosters input, honesty, and good information.
After you’ve done the “housekeeping” tasks, make sure you allow time for team
members to get to know one another. If it’s going to be a long project, you may
want to schedule subsequent team building activities to get the team working
together as a cohesive unit. If doing team-building sounds like sissy work, think
again. Many large companies spend millions of dollars each year trying to ﬁgure out
how to create more productive work teams. Productive teams are worth a small
investment and if you’re really not comfortable with this, contact a local consultant
who specialized in team building and creating highly effective teams. One or two
sessions with a team-building consultant can help your team change from a group of
highly skilled individuals to a highly functional team—and you might actually enjoy
yourself along the way. If you equate team building with a mushy group hug, think
again.There are many fascinating and interesting team building sessions that help
people learn about themselves and build a cohesive team.
The IT Factor…
Building Team Success
If team building sounds a bit too touchy-feely for you, you aren’t up to speed on
what team building can do for you. To build a sense of commitment to the suc-
cess of the project, you must build a sense of commitment to the team. Since
you, as the IT project manager, typically lack formal organizational authority, you
need people on your team to be committed to the project’s success. Gaining their
commitment can come in part from getting people on the team to connect with
one another. People are much less likely to drop the ball or point the ﬁnger when
they’ve established a connection with other team members. “Getting people to
work well together is more than just getting them in the same room,” explains
VirtualTeam Senior Consultant Lorraine Gutsche. “You need to create a shared
sense of purpose and you need create an environment that encourages people to
connect and contribute to the project. Without a strong sense of team commit-
ment, your team members will continue to act as independent contributors.
Independent work may be ﬁne, but their efforts will yield less than optimal pro-
ject results. You want optimal project results and a whole that is greater than the
sum of its parts.”
www.syngress.com
Forming the IT Project Team • Chapter 8
323

For more information on how to form and manage a highly functional team,
refer to the end of Chapter 4 and review the section entitled “Managing High
Performance Teams.”
Team Technology
If you’re using technology to enhance or foster team communication, make sure all
team members have access to those resources and know how to use them. Just
because someone is technically savvy in one area does not necessarily mean he or
she is savvy in other areas. Don’t assume team members know how to use technical
resources unless it’s very clear they do (e-mail, telephone, etc.). If you’re using instant
messaging, an intranet site, a collaboration software tool, or any other technology
team members may not know how to use effectively, make sure you provide
training. Most technical people don’t like to admit there’s something they don’t
know (or can’t ﬁgure out), so don’t ask for a show of hands to tell you who does
and does not know how to use a particular tool. Instead, assume no one knows and
provide training for everyone or check in with team members individually.
Managing Performance
After you’ve formed your team, you’ll need to begin managing their project-related
performance.You should have some of the processes and procedures already deﬁned,
but it’s likely you’ll need to work with your team to clarify or tune up some of these
processes and procedures. Studies repeatedly show that people who are involved with
setting their own performance standards are more likely to meet those performance
standards—and that doesn’t mean setting the bar so low as to be useless. Performance
metrics have to be reasonable and achievable, but if members of the team can partic-
ipate in setting those levels (even if that means giving feedback and modifying preset
standards), they’re more likely to work hard to achieve them.
You may need to work with team members’ direct supervisor, managers, or HR
staff to develop acceptable performance measurements that can be used both within
the project team and by the person’s manager as part of an overall performance eval-
uation process. In some companies, the PM performs an evaluation as part of the
project closeout activities (see Chapter 12).
Finally, you need to think about what you’ll do if people fail to perform to stan-
dards.There are many reasons for this type of failure—from not understanding roles
and responsibilities to lack of ability to perform required tasks to political maneu-
vering and laziness.Your job as IT project manager is to shepherd this project along
toward successful completion and along the way, you may have to deal with poor
performance.These methods should be well deﬁned in advance so you can simply
www.syngress.com
324
Chapter 8 • Forming the IT Project Team

implement your performance management processes and procedures, if needed. It
will save you time and lots of aggravation.
Remember that there are essentially two causes of poor performance—the lack
of ability and the lack of desire.Your job should be to try to determine where the
problem lies. If it’s lack of ability, the person may require training or may have to be
replaced with someone more capable. If it’s lack of desire, you have an entirely dif-
ferent problem on your hands.You can try to get the person to come around, you
can talk with the person’s manager, or you may have to replace that person as well.
Your options as an IT project manager are a bit more limited than if you had formal
organizational authority over team members, but the basics remain the same.
Recognition and Rewards
Finding appropriate ways to give recognition and rewards for team members is an
important part of forming and managing high performance teams (for a review of
managing high performance teams, re-read the end of Chapter 4.) As the leader of
the team, an important part of your role is to keep everyone on the team moving
forward toward a common goal and that means providing genuine recognition and
rewards for project work. Perhaps you’ve experienced recognition and rewards that
are not genuine—for instance when everyone gets the same recognition or reward
regardless of contribution.These insincere attempts at recognition and reward usually
backﬁre because the worst performers get recognition they don’t deserve and the
best performers are lumped in with the worst performers. If you want to ﬁnd ways
to demotivate people, that’s your best bet.There are times when rewarding the
whole team for a team effort is appropriate, but it should not be the only type of
recognition and reward team members receive. However, if you want to motivate the
team toward higher achievement, recognition and rewards must match the actual
contribution in order to be perceived as genuine.
Recognition can come in many different forms and taking a look at how your
company operates and its political environment can give you great ideas for how to
provide meaningful recognition. In some companies, sending a global e-mail or
memo to the person’s manager touting someone’s great project performance might
be just the way to give them appropriate recognition. In other companies, the best
way might be to provide a certiﬁcate of achievement; in other companies, it might
be a pizza party held in their honor. Whatever you do, make it meaningful to the
recipient.
As for rewards, these too come in all shapes and sizes from silly rewards to a free
pair of movie tickets to a local theater or a gift certiﬁcate to a local restaurant. Some
rewards are not monetary—such as when someone does a great job and earns a spot
www.syngress.com
Forming the IT Project Team • Chapter 8
325

on a special project team or is assigned a coveted project task.Again, the rewards
should match the contribution and they should be awarded in a fair and consistent
manager to avoid demotivating your best performers.
Cheat Sheet…
Low-Budget Rewards and Recognition
These days, everyone’s budget is strained, so you might have to be creative in
devising fun and meaningful recognition and rewards for your team. If you have
a creative bone in your body, you should be able to come up with something. If
you don’t, call upon one of your creative friends or coworkers for ideas. You can
ﬁnd plenty of ideas on the Web as well, but here are a few to get you started.
1. Create a Wall of Fame and post a picture of the star performer with
a brief description of why the recognition is being given and how it
impacted the team or project.
2. Hand out small, inexpensive tokens as kudos during team meetings.
You could use different colored marbles for different types of tasks
or small toy cars or just about anything that would make recognition
fun and tangible.
3. Hand out points or tokens for various levels of achievement or con-
tribution and allow team members to cash in those points for small
prizes at the end of the project. Points might be good for a gift cer-
tiﬁcate to an online store or movie tickets or a miniature golf
outing—whatever you think team members would enjoy that won’t
break the bank.
4. Create an award or trophy (the crazier the better) that travels to var-
ious team members’ desks each week or month based on peer-
reviewed performance ratings. Toilet plungers (unused) and bowling
pins are two ever-popular trophies.
These are just a few ideas to get you started. Remember, there’s no rule
against having lots of fun while you’re working hard. Recognition tops the list of
things that cause people to feel satisﬁed with their jobs, so ﬁnding ways to give
genuine recognition for a job well done is an important part of managing a suc-
cessful project.

Summary
At this point in your project planning, you’ll need to form (or have formed) your
project team.You’ve clearly identiﬁed the project and its major deliverables so now
you need the project team to begin contributing their ideas and expertise so the
project gets off on the right foot. In Chapter 4 you learned about managing an IT
project team and there’s a lot of detail in that chapter that you might want to review.
In this chapter, we discussed how to actually form the team.
You need to begin by deﬁning your team requirements so you can be sure to
include the right people with the right expertise at the right time in the right way.
This is often best done without identifying speciﬁc people so you make sure you cover
your project requirements before you get into speciﬁcs of people and personalities.
Once you’ve identiﬁed these requirements, you can begin looking at speciﬁc people
and identifying who you need and what constraints might have to be considered.
Clearly deﬁned roles and responsibilities are absolutely critical to project success
because they help everyone know exactly what they should be doing. Sometimes it’s
helpful to deﬁne roles using the “is/is not” structure we discussed earlier in the
book. Well-deﬁned roles and responsibilities also help you hold team members indi-
vidually accountable for results. Clear performance guidelines improve project sucsess
and help make the performance evaluation process fair and consistent.
Sometimes it can be a challenge to actually get the needed staff assigned to your
project. With some high proﬁle, exciting, cutting-edge projects, it’s relatively easy to
get top-notch talent to volunteer or be assigned to the project. In other cases, it’s
more difﬁcult. If at all possible, link participation in mundane projects to participa-
tion in the high proﬁle projects to ensure that even the most boring, routine projects
get their share of talented staff.Avoid accepting known troublemakers on the team
by having an honest discussion with the project sponsor.A successful project starts
with a strong project team and allowing a known disruptive inﬂuence on the team
without at least pushing back will put your project at risk.
Once you’ve formed the team, you need to do a little work turning it from a
group of individuals to a highly functional team.There are numerous ways to do this
(review Chapter 4) and with a little creativity and effort, you can ﬁnd ways to forge
a team identity that will help propel the project toward success.

Identifying Project Team Requirements
 Factors to consider when forming your project team include:
organizational, technical, logistical, interpersonal, and political.
 Deﬁning needed roles and responsibilities before identifying people to ﬁll
those roles will help you create an optimal team.
 Identifying needed competencies will help you select the people best suited
to the project. It also helps you identify skill gaps you may need to look
outside your ﬁrm to ﬁll.
 Identifying constraints to staff availability is important so you can work
with these constraints in your project scheduling (discussed later in this
book).You may ﬁnd you have to hire external staff to work around any
signiﬁcant availability issues.
 Identifying how your project team will interface with other parts of the
organization may be required, depending on the nature of the project.
Identifying Stafﬁng Requirements and Constraints
 Once you’ve identiﬁed high-level roles and responsibilities, you can begin
looking for the appropriate people to ﬁll these roles.
 Once you’ve identiﬁed speciﬁc people for various roles, you’ll need to use
whatever power and authority you have to get those people assigned to
your project team.
 Sometimes the most desirable or needed team members are unavailable
either temporarily or permanently.You’ll have to look for these constraints
and ﬁnd ways to deal with them—either through modifying your project
schedule or through hiring external staff to ﬁll in gaps.
 Constraints can also be limitations on internal skills and talents that must be
addressed through additional training or through additional hiring (temp,
contractor, permanent, etc.).
www.syngress.com
Forming the IT Project Team • Chapter 8
329

Deﬁning Roles and Responsibilities
 Once you’ve formed your project team, you need to assign each team
member a speciﬁc role and set of responsibilities.
 Clearly deﬁned roles and responsibilities help avoid ﬁnger pointing, turf
wars, and other nonproductive human behavior.
 Responsibilities should be clearly delineated. Have team members work as
a team to carve out appropriate roles and responsibilities so they begin to
take ownership of the project.
Acquiring Needed Staff
 You’ll need to work with selected team member’s managers (if you’re not
their direct supervisor) to make sure they are released for project work
when needed.
 Identify any procedural issues for pulling people onto your project team
and work to get those in place prior to kicking off your ﬁrst team meeting.
 Identify the cost of your team from a payroll standpoint. In some
companies, you’ll need to include labor hours or the fully burdened cost of
each person per hour (the cost of salary plus beneﬁts plus payroll taxes,
etc.).
 If you’ll be bringing in outside staff, you’ll need to work with any external
scheduling/availability issues and you’ll need to add the cost of these folks
to your project costs (we’ll discuss developing your project budget later in
the book).
Forming the Team
 Once you have identiﬁed and acquired your team, you should create and
distribute a team roster. It helps foster team communication now and in the
future.
 Identify any need for team training, whether formal or informal. Make sure
the team has all the skills it needs, individually and collectively, to
successfully complete this project.
 Hold a team (kick-off) meeting to introduce team members and to help
everyone begin to form a sense of belonging to a team.
www.syngress.com

Chapter 8 • Forming the IT Project Team

 If your team will be using non-standard technology, make sure everyone is
trained and has equal access to these technologies. While it might be
acceptable to assume everyone can use e-mail (though you should make
sure that’s the case), you shouldn’t assume everyone understands how to use
instant messaging, intranet sites, or collaboration tools. Provide training and
documentation whenever possible to ensure everyone can use team project
technology equally.
 You’ll need to manage team performance, so make sure you have processes
and procedures in place to monitor, measure, and evaluate individual and
team project performance. Make sure you have identiﬁed how you’ll handle
poor performance before the project gets fully underway.
 Create genuine methods of recognition and rewards that will reward good
(or great) performance. Look for opportunities to instill a bit of fun or
humor into the process.
Q: This is a book on IT project management, but you’ve spent two chapters
talking about teams. Why?
A: Projects don’t fail, people do.As an IT project manager, if you can’t success-
fully manage your project team, your project is in serious danger. Sometimes
you get lucky and the project sort of runs itself, but the odds of that are
worse than winning the lottery. We’ve dedicated two chapters on managing
your project team—one from a more theoretical standpoint (Chapter 4) and
one from a more practical standpoint (this chapter) in order to give you the
tools you need to successfully manage your IT project team. Managing
people is usually more complicated than managing technology and many IT
project managers excel at the latter and fail at the former. Improving and
honing people-management skills is part of improving as an IT project man-
ager and will certainly be needed if you plan on moving up the corporate
ladder in your career.

Frequently Asked Questions
The following Frequently Asked Questions, answered by the author of this book,
are designed to both measure your understanding of the concepts presented in 
this chapter and to assist you with real-life implementation of these concepts. To
have your questions about this chapter answered by the author, browse to
www.syngress.com/solutions and click on the “Ask the Author” form. 

Q: I don’t usually get to choose who’s on my IT project team and who’s not.
How can I deal with a preassigned team more successfully?
A: Start by going through the steps listed in this chapter, including identifying
roles, responsibilities, and competencies needed to successfully complete the
project.Then try to map these requirements to your assigned team members.
If there are any signiﬁcant gaps, bring this to the attention of your project
sponsor. If your project sponsor is truly interested in a successful project, he
or she will help you ﬁll those gaps either by assigning additional people,
allowing you to hire temporary outside contractors, or by providing training
to assigned team members. If you can’t do any of that, make sure that the
skill or competency gaps are noted as project risks (we’ll discuss identifying
and managing project risks later in the book) so at least no one can turn
around later and say they were unaware of these shortfalls.
Q: Creating roles and responsibilities sounds like a lot of bureaucratic nonsense.
Can we just get the team going?
A: It would be nice if we all could just intuitively know what to do and could
instinctively get along with others, but unfortunately it rarely works that way.
Creating clearly deﬁned boundaries helps everyone. It actually reduces team
stress when people know exactly what is expected (and not expected) of
them. While it may take some extra planning effort on your part, it really will
generate positive results once the project is underway. It doesn’t have to be a
long, drawn-out process by any means. See if you can reuse deﬁnitions from
other (successful) projects.And, if it really works your last good nerve to
create this from scratch, ﬁnd someone on your team that has those strong
analyzer qualities and ask them to create the initial roles and responsibilities
document.Then, all you have to do is edit it.
Q: I’m not very comfortable giving public recognition or rewards to my team.
Any suggestions?
A: A lot of people are uncomfortable in those situations, so you’re not alone.
However, managing a team involves a certain amount of public speaking.
While you can talk to team members individually and in private to let them
know how well they’re doing, it usually has more impact to give them that
recognition in a team, department, or division meeting. So if you’re uncom-
fortable doing that, try writing down what you would say then practicing it
www.syngress.com
332
Chapter 8 • Forming the IT Project Team

in front of a mirror or with someone you trust to be kind and to help coach
you (dogs can be a good stand-in because they rarely laugh out loud at you).
Focusing on the speciﬁc behavior will also help because then you’re not
saying,“Hey, that Raina, isn’t’ she great?” Instead, you can focus on the actual
behavior such as,“Raina wrote such clean code that she was able to meet
Requirements 1, 2, and 3 with just 150 lines of code. Great job, Raina,
thanks!”The more speciﬁc you are and the more focused on the task,
behavior and beneﬁt you are, the more comfortable you’ll probably be
handing out compliments.And get used to it—the more you hand out gen-
uine compliments, the happier your team will be.

Introduction
Up to this point, we’ve done a lot of work to deﬁne the project clearly. If you’ve
done all of this work diligently, your project is now resting on a very solid founda-
tion. If you’ve skipped any steps, take time to go back and go through them to
ensure your project doesn’t have any gaping holes before we get into the detailed
project planning in this chapter.
The only way your project can complete successfully is if it starts off successfully.
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to break the project down into manageable compo-
nents so that you can not only plan the work, but you can develop a more realistic
schedule and budget. By breaking the project down into its components, you can
also verify your project scope and take this opportunity to make sure you don’t have
any missing elements.
As you develop these more detailed plans, you may come across new project
risks that you were not previously aware of.As with other steps, some of these risks
may be so signiﬁcant that your project sponsor chooses to hold or terminate the
project. More often though, the risks you identify give you the opportunity to ﬁgure
out what you and the team can do to avoid these risks or what you’ll do if these
risks occur.
Many IT project teams come in with average to failing scores when it comes to
project communication, so we’ll end this chapter with a review of the communica-
tion plans you should have in place and how you should be progressing on those.
This will help ensure you communicate appropriately (effectively and timely) with
the necessary people to help make your project not only be successful, but to help it
be perceived as successful as well.
As in other chapters, we will start with an overview of the IT project manage-
ment process to keep track of where we are, as shown in Figure 9.1. Notice this is
the ﬁnal step before actually initiating the project, so you want to ensure you’ve got
everything set before you pull the trigger.

Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

Figure 9.1 IT Project Management Process Overview
In this chapter, we’ll introduce many new concepts and related terminology, so
let’s deﬁne some of the language we’ll be using.
■
Completion Criteria The standards or measurements used to deﬁne
when a task (work package) is successfully completed.
■
Critical Path The longest, least ﬂexible path through the project.Any
delay to tasks on the critical path put the entire project at risk of delay.
■
Critical Path Method (CPM)  A network technique using one time
estimate for the calculation of the duration of the critical path.
■
Earned Value  The value of work completed based on the budget for that
work. EV = % Complete * Budget At Completion (BAC).
■
Earned Value Management (EVM) Integrates scope, schedule, and cost
to give an objective, scalable, point-in-time assessment of the progress of the
project. It calculates performance against plan and can be used to evaluate
the project and identify serious problems earlier than other methods might.

■
Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)  A network
technique using three time estimates for the calculation of the duration of

most likely (ML).These estimates are used to determine the expected time
using the formula: Expected Duration = (B + (4 * ML) + W)/6.
■
Percent Complete An estimate of the amount of work completed com-
pared to the total amount of work required.
■
Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM) A method of creating a
network diagram (mapping project work tasks) to indicate dependencies,
constraints, and sequencing. Some variation of PDM is used in most project
management software programs.
■
Slack (also called Float)  The amount of time an activity can be delayed
without delaying the rest of the project.
■
Task The term task and work package are used interchangeably.A task is
deﬁned as the smallest, most manageable discrete unit of work. Some orga-
nizations deﬁne tasks as units of the work package.
■
Triggers The speciﬁc set of circumstances that must occur for you to put
your alternative plans into action as part of your project risk mitigation
strategy.
■
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  The hierarchical breakdown of the
work in a project that starts with the highest-level deliverables and breaks
them down into small, manageable work components (tasks or work
packages).

Work Package The smallest, most manageable, discrete unit of work
within the WBS.

Things are More Likely to go Wrong…
Here’s another project management saying: “Things are more likely to acciden-
tally go wrong than to accidentally go right.” It’s like a perfect golf shot or a per-
fect hit in baseball—it seems we can hit a horrible shot over and over exactly the
same way, but when we hit that one absolutely perfect shot, we can’t seem to
repeat it (unless, of course, we’re in the ranks of Tiger Woods, Annika Sorenstam,
Derek Jeter, or A-Rod). Strange, but true. In IT project management, things will
go wrong, that’s a fact. The more time you spend in the planning stage (to a
point), the more likely you are to see some of the bumps along the road and
avoid them. You won’t be able to avoid every single problem, but this phase—
the planning phase—is often skipped or abbreviated and that means lackluster
results for some projects and abject failure for others. This is time well spent and
it doesn’t have to take an inordinate amount of time. In fact, the amount of time
you spend in the planning stage should be appropriate to the complexity, scope,
and importance of the project. That said, don’t short-change this step. It will
improve your results substantially.
Now that we’ve deﬁned a few terms, let’s turn to the process we’ll discuss in this
chapter.You can see in Figure 9.2 the inputs, actions, and outputs from this step in
the IT project planning process. We’ll discuss each of these brieﬂy here and then
delve into more detail in the remainder of the chapter.

Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9

Figure 9.2 Inputs, Actions, and Outputs for Project Planning Step
1.
INPUT The inputs to this step in the IT project management process are
twofold. First, the initial project plan must be used in order to ensure that
the planning steps you take meet the project requirements including scope,
time, cost, quality, and functional and technical requirements.The other
input is your project team, meaning that at this point you should have
identiﬁed and created your project team. While members of the project
team may change over the course of the project, your initial team should
be ready to go to help you with the planning stage of this IT project.
2.
ACTION The action is to perform the IT project planning processes dis-
cussed in this chapter.These actions will help you create a detailed project
plan from which you can develop a much more realistic and manageable
schedule and from which you can develop your project’s ﬁnal target
budget.
3.
OUTPUT The output of this step is an updated and detailed project plan
that includes your initial target schedule and budget. In some cases, the
schedule and budget resulting from this process will be your ﬁnal targets. In
other cases, further reﬁnement may be needed.

Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

4.
CHECKPOINT The detailed project plan, schedule, and budget should
be reviewed with the project sponsor at this point to make sure you and
the project sponsor are in agreement.Any areas of confusion, disagreement,
or contention should be resolved before moving forward. If there are any
known problems in the project plan at this point, they will only be magni-
ﬁed in the future, so they should be satisfactorily resolved now. If any mod-
iﬁcations are made, the project plan should be reviewed brieﬂy to ensure
other elements aren’t impacted by the change.
5.
DECISION POINT If the project plan is approved, you’ll be ready to
actually launch the project itself. If the project plan is not approved, you
may need to make revisions to the plan or be prepared to terminate the
project (or perhaps place it on hold).
6.
NEXT STEP If you have an approved detailed project plan, schedule, and
budget, you’re ready to begin project work. Once project work begins, your
job is to manage the project and keep in on track and we’ll discuss those
tasks in Chapter 10.
Creating the Work Breakdown Structure
If you recall from your earlier work, you developed three to ﬁve high-level objec-
tives or deliverables for the project.You also deﬁned functional and technical speciﬁ-
cations. If you didn’t create speciﬁcations that were deﬁned, discrete, and measurable,
you need to do so before you head into this detailed planning work. If you have a
well-deﬁned project, creating the Work Breakdown Structure will create a much
clearer and more detailed picture of the project. If you haven’t created deﬁned, dis-
crete and measurable requirements for your project, your WBS will wander and
you’ll most likely experience scope creep right out of the gate.
Quality and WBS
One key point to remember as you begin creating your WBS is that you should
refer to your project scope and your project quality plan.The scope of the project
will ultimately be deﬁned by the WBS, so keeping scope in mind as you create your
WBS will help keep you and the team focused.Also, keep in mind your quality plan
and quality metrics.These can be used in two ways. First, you may want (or need) to
deﬁne additional tasks related to quality planning, quality control, or quality assur-
ance. Second, you can deﬁne entry/exit criteria and/or completion criteria (both
explained in a moment) for tasks based on quality standards or metrics. Quality is
www.syngress.com
Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
341

built into a project from the ground up and as you develop your WBS, you should
keep your quality goals in the forefront of your mind. By keeping an eye on quality
during this planning phase, you will continue to build quality into the project rather
than have to come back and try to add it later.
Breaking Down Your Project
If you have very clearly deﬁned project parameters, creating your WBS will not only
be easier, but the end result will be a breakdown of work that maps to your project’s
requirements and outcomes. Let’s start by using a generic example to explain how
we’re going to break the project down into its components.To use a very tangible
example, if you were going to build a house, your three to ﬁve objectives might be:
1.
House plan
2.
Foundation
3.
Framing
4.
Exterior
5.
Interior
You know that each of these high-level objectives or deliverables has a set of
activities that must be completed in order to deliver that element. For example, the
foundation deliverable might include surveying and marking the property to deter-
mine the correct position/location for the foundation.The foundation area must be
excavated and forms to mold the concrete must be built before the concrete is
poured.These are discrete elements of work (tasks or work packages) to be per-
formed in order to deliver the foundation part of this plan.
The same holds true in IT project planning. Each of your major deliverables has
work associated with it that results in the successful delivery of that element.
Breaking the major deliverables down into their component tasks or work packages
is called creating the Work Breakdown Structure.The process of breaking the major
deliverables into smaller units is formally called decomposing the WBS, but we’ll
keep it simple.
www.syngress.com

Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

The IT Factor…
Your WBS “Inventory”
“Many people underestimate the beneﬁts, not to mention the challenges, of
developing a good work breakdown structure. A good WBS provides the critical
link between deﬁning a project and achieving project goals. A WBS is not com-
plete until work packages have been identiﬁed for all the tasks in the WBS. It’s
the work packages that translate projects into reality,” explains Ralph Spitzen,
Director of the Metals Industry Practice and The Center for Learning &
Professional Excellence at TDCI Inc., an Ohio-based consulting ﬁrm. “Most pro-
jects within a given organization will have similar life cycles and thus similar
requirements for work packages in each phase. Building an inventory of reusable
WBS’s is an important part of every IT project manager’s toolkit.”
Major Deliverables to Major Tasks
The ﬁrst step in developing your WBS is to take each of your major deliverables and
break them down into the major segments of work required to complete this deliv-
erable. Using the house-building example, it means breaking down the foundation
deliverable as we did a moment ago. Clearly, there are numerous steps that go into
each of those major tasks, but for now we simply want to identify the major tasks. In
some larger or more complex projects, you may choose to divide up the major
deliverables and assign them to subject matter experts so they can develop the major
tasks.As the IT project manager, you job is not to do all the project work or to
know everything about everything.Your job is to make sure the project gets com-
pleted successfully, and that typically means ﬁnding the right people to do the var-
ious jobs.This can also save time by having people work simultaneously (rather than
a big group exercise).Another potential bonus to getting your subject matter experts
to work on this task is that they may use prior expertise to streamline the project
tasks or they may uncover a problem no one knew about.

Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9

IT Factor …
Organizing Your WBS
When developing your WBS, don’t be concerned with the order in which tasks
are listed at the outset. Make sure all tasks (work packages) are listed before you
worry about the order, which will be developed later. If you start worrying about
the order in which the tasks should be listed, you’re likely to forget one or more
important tasks. Most people think in a rather linear manner, so the task lists
often come out in some sort of initial order and that’s ﬁne. Just don’t spend time
rearranging the list because sequencing comes later. Many IT project managers
ﬁnd it helpful to use a numbering system for tasks so that as they do move
around later, it remains clear which tasks are part of a work package, master task
or summary task. The most commonly used numbering system is as follows:
1. Major task 1
1.1.
Sub-task 1
1.2.
Sub-task 2
1.3.
Sub-task 3
1.3.1. Sub-sub-task 1
1.3.2. Sub-sub-task 2
2. Major task 2
2.1.
Sub-task 1
2.2.
Sub-task 2
3. Major task 3
3.1.
Sub-task 1
3.2.
Sub-task 2
3.3.
Sub-task 3
This type of number system helps because each major task is identiﬁed and
all of the related sub-tasks are then numbered to keep track of their association
with each other and with their major task. When the tasks are later rearranged
to create the most optimal sequence and later, the schedule, it won’t matter
what order the tasks are in because your numbering system will help you imme-
diately recognize their relationships. While you don’t have to use this type of
numbering system, it’s one of the easiest to use to keep track of multiple layers
www.syngress.com

Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects
Continued

of tasks, which most IT project have. When you later assign tasks to owners, you
can assign by number and you can have task owners for major tasks and all sub-
tasks or you can assign individual owners to sub-tasks, whichever best suits your
project’s and team’s needs.
Major Tasks to Tasks
There’s a project management tool called the 8/80 rule, which states that it usually is
best to deﬁne tasks that take a minimum of 8 hours and a maximum of 80 hours. If
you identify tasks that take 2 or 4 hours, you’re headed toward a scheduling night-
mare by creating unnecessary headaches for yourself. If you identify tasks that take
less than 8 hours, you probably can (and should) roll them up into a slightly larger
task that will take 8 or more hours. On the other side, you should avoid identifying
any task (work package) that takes more than 80 hours. It’s better to break those
work packages down into smaller increments of work so they can be more effec-
tively managed and tracked. So, the general rule of 8/80 applies here.
Taking your major tasks, have the team break them down into tasks that fall
between 8 and 80 hours in duration.There may be additional, smaller tasks that must
be accomplished, but for scheduling purposes, you should stick to the 8/80 rule.
Let’s look at an example. We’ll use the house-building example again. If the house
painter needs to paint the exterior, that might be a three-day job, so it would be
listed as a task in the Exterior section of the project.That painter might break that
task down into smaller tasks to help him or her complete the job.The painter might
make a list that includes: prep all exterior trim, prime all exterior trim, paint all exte-
rior trim, apply second coat to all exterior trim. Some of those tasks might take less
than 4 hours and they don’t have to be added to the project schedule. Paint exterior
trim is the task on the schedule and the subtasks we just identiﬁed make up the task
“Paint exterior trim.”The task owner (we’ll discuss task owners in a moment) will
often break a task down into its components in order to complete the task, and that’s
a good thing.Trying to schedule all those subtasks would be akin to micromanaging
the project and you’ll create headaches for yourself and everyone else if you try to
schedule and manage all those small subtasks.
Once you have delineated all your tasks, you should make a ﬁrst pass at setting
the duration for the task. Remember, duration and effort are not the same thing.A
task might only take eight hours to complete, but you’re allowing a duration of three
days to allow the person to complete the task. If you can enter these durations for
tasks now, do so. If you don’t have enough data to determine duration for certain
tasks, get the task owners busy (more on task owners in a moment) estimating the
duration.You’ll need duration for all tasks before you can determine your ﬁnal pro-
ject schedule.
www.syngress.com
Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
345

As we mentioned earlier, you should not worry about the order or sequence of
tasks at this point.Though there may be a certain amount of linear thinking that
causes you to think of tasks in a particular sequence, you should not spend time now
trying to place tasks in sequence as much as you should ensure that all the required
work for the project is listed. We’ll look at how to sequence tasks in just a bit, so for
this exercise, just make sure all the work is listed and that they are somewhere
between 8 and 80 hours in duration.
Cheat Sheet…
Deﬁning Tasks Using Verbs and Nouns
The 8/80 rule helps you create tasks that are manageable and that’s clearly your
number one goal as IT PM. Another tip for managing your project is to have your
team deﬁne your tasks using a noun/verb format. If someone is assigned the task
of “Cabling,” he or she may have no idea what that means. If he or she is
assigned a task that says “Install CAT5 cable”, he or she now has a much better
idea of the nature of the task. It will help everyone and it’s easy to have your
team write up tasks in this format from the start. A project’s success is created
one task at a time, so make sure each task is clear and concise.
Scope Check
Once you have created your WBS, you and the project team should step back and
look at your project’s requirements including scope, time, cost, quality, and functional
and technical requirements. Check to make sure the work deﬁned by the WBS actu-
ally matches the work outlined by the project requirements. Often in IT projects,
this is where the ﬁrst disconnect happens.Any gap between the project’s require-
ments and the WBS is a problem. On one hand, you may ﬁnd that the WBS deﬁnes
more work than is in the requirements.This is a classic example of one type of scope
creep. Somehow, in deﬁning the deliverables in terms of actual work packages, the
scope of the project expanded. Sometimes this happens because you can’t always
know the extent of work needed until you create the WBS. However, if this hap-
pens, you have to carefully look at the project and determine if the original require-
ments were insufﬁcient and the tasks in the WBS should be included in the
requirements or if the WBS should be scaled back to better meet the project
requirements.There is no right answer here because the ultimate test of the project
www.syngress.com
346
Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

is whether it meets user/customer requirements. It’s possible that by deﬁning your
WBS, you identiﬁed elements of the user requirements that were not actually speci-
ﬁed but are needed.An example of this might be something like the program con-
tains all the user’s requirements but you forgot about the user interface that would
allow the user to use these features (unlikely, but just one example).
The bottom line here is that this is an excellent opportunity to ensure your pro-
ject requirements and project work are aligned and that they haven’t started to
spread around the middle. Keep your project lean and mean and take steps here to
address any disconnects, gaps, or creep.
Remember, too, that your WBS essentially deﬁnes your scope.As you recall,
scope is deﬁned as the total amount of work in the project needed to meet the
requirements. So, your project requirements should match your WBS, and your WBS
should include only the work needed to meet project requirements and not a speck
more. If they’re not aligned at this point, you’re going to be way off track at the
other end of the project.
Task Owners
After the major deliverables have been broken down into the component tasks, each
task should be assigned an owner.The rule of thumb is: one owner per task or work
package.That doesn’t mean that a team or group won’t work on that task, but that
one person is held responsible for that task.A task owner, by deﬁnition, is the person
responsible for the successful completion of the task.That does not mean that the
task owner must perform the work in the task. It means that the owner is respon-
sible for making sure the task is completed according to task speciﬁcations (scope,
time, cost, and quality for the task).The task details determine how the task will be
completed and the owner is often the best person to determine those details.The
owner may delegate the development of task details to others, but ultimately it is the
task owner who should be held accountable for delivering these task details and
later, delivering the task successfully.
How do you assign owners? There are several criteria you might use in assigning
owners and ideally, your IT project team members will select tasks to take on based
on their own areas of expertise and interest. If you have to assign owners, you should
look for one or more of these criteria:
■
Expertise Look for a subject matter expert who understands the compo-
nents of the task.Those closest to the job often understand best what needs
to be done. If you can get a subject matter expert (often called an SME) to
own the task, its more likely the task will be well deﬁned and well managed.
www.syngress.com
Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
347

■
Experience If you don’t have a subject matter expert to take on the task,
the next criterion might be experience in related areas. If you assign tasks
to experienced team members, they can either ﬁgure out the required
information or they know who they have to go to in order to get that data.
■
Existing Technical or Team Lead This person may already have the
formal authority on part of the project team and may be helpful in both
deﬁning tasks and determining to whom tasks should be delegated.
If you don’t have a project team member with the expertise or experience to
own the tasks, you have a problem. Remember, someone might be a peripheral part
of the project team because he or she only works on one area of the project. How
you deﬁne “project team” may ﬂex and bend over the life of the project, so don’t
forget about people who might only participate in certain phases or steps of the pro-
ject. If you need additional expertise, work with your project sponsor to identify
resource needs to make sure you get the expertise you need. Lack of required exper-
tise on a technical project can tank that project quickly. Having subject matter
experts assist in developing task details (even if they don’t later own them) might be
your best bet in highly technical projects.
Cheat Sheet…
Task Ownership
The rule in project management is that a task should have one and only one
owner. A task with more than one owner is less likely to be completed on time,
on budget, and with the required quality. A task with no owners simply won’t
get done. More than one person can work on a task, but only one person should
be assigned as the owner. If the task gets in trouble, you don’t need a lot of
ﬁnger pointing and “he-said, she-said.” You need the task to be completed
according to the speciﬁcations, period. One task, one owner.
Completion Criteria
Ideally, the task owner should create the completion criteria. Completion criteria are
the standards or measurements used to determine that a task or job was completed
according to speciﬁcations.These speciﬁcations include scope, time, cost, quality, and
perhaps functional and technical requirements. Sometimes the completion criteria
www.syngress.com
348
Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

may be developed by a group or team or by the entire IT project team.You’ll have
to use your best judgment for which way to go, but often the task owner can create
the completion criteria quickly and efﬁciently.The quality metrics you developed in
Chapter 7 should be included in the completion criteria because it is through com-
pletion criteria that quality is managed (quality control) during the work phase of
the task.
Let’s go back to our painting analogy.The house painter knows how to do the
job quickly and correctly (scope, time, cost, and quality) or you wouldn’t be using
this house painter.The painter is the best one to come up with the completion cri-
teria for “Paint all exterior trim.” He or she can make a quick checklist that can be
used by anyone else to determine, beyond a shadow of a doubt, whether or not the
job is completed within the scope, time, cost, and quality parameters.The comple-
tion criteria should be crystal clear: the job either was or was not completed success-
fully.This is important because you don’t want a lot of discussion and debate on
whether or not a task was successfully completed. If the completion criteria leave
room for doubt, they need to be revised.The house painter knows that if the wood
isn’t prepped, the paint won’t adhere, so properly prepping all wood surfaces to be
painted might be part of the completion criteria for the task. It’s possible that even
more detail is required to specify exactly how the wood should be prepped. Does it
include ﬁlling in gaps and nail holes? Does it include sanding the surfaces? Does it
include wiping or washing down surfaces? 
As you can see, the degree of detail depends on several factors.
1.
Who is performing the work? If someone more experienced is performing
the work, the completion criteria typically do not need to be as detailed.
An experienced network administrator will know to take certain steps that
might have to be spelled out to a less experienced net admin.
2.
How complex is the task? The more complex a task is, the more detailed
the completion criteria should be. Leave no room for doubt.
3.
How critical is the task to project completion? Sometimes a task or deliver-
able is very critical to the project and therefore has little room for error. In
these cases, more detailed completion criteria may be appropriate.
Let’s not confuse the complexity or level of detail with the quality of the com-
pletion criteria. Just because you might opt for shorter, more concise completion
criteria, it doesn’t mean you’re sacriﬁcing quality.The needed level of quality should
be delivered no matter what.You and your team will need to verify that the comple-
tion criteria for tasks drive that level of quality.The complexity of the task and the
expertise of the person working on the task will typically determine how detailed
www.syngress.com
Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
349

the completion criteria need to be, but they should be as detailed as needed to
ensure quality.As the IT project manager, you will ultimately be held accountable
for project deliverables, so be sure you agree with task completion criteria.As the
liaison between the stakeholders and the project team, you may also have a better
perspective as to stakeholder and project sponsor expectations and needs.Your job is
to ensure these needs are reﬂected in the task completion criteria.
Completion criteria drive quality. In the chapter on quality, we discussed the
sources of quality in a project and we mentioned completion criteria. Completion
criteria are the best tool to manage quality on a task-by-task basis.That’s why they’re
so important to deﬁne well and to use as the measurement for whether or not a task
is complete.The time your team spends in developing clear, thorough completion
criteria for each task is time very well spent.
Entry/Exit Criteria
Entry and exit criteria are used to deﬁne the entry into and exit from particular pro-
ject milestones. When developing your WBS, you may want to deﬁne entry and exit
criteria.These are different from completion criteria in that you are not deﬁning
successful task completion, but rather successful phase or step completion. For
instance, suppose your project is to develop a new program.You should wait to com-
plete your requirements development before you have programmers begin writing
code.Therefore, the entry criteria for the code development phase of the project
could be the completed, accepted requirements list (note that the completed,
accepted requirements list can also be the exit criteria for the requirements develop-
ment phase). Entry and exit criteria are typically used to deﬁne entry and exit into
and out of phases or steps of the project, but some companies choose to create these
for all major deliverables, all major phases, or even all major work packages.Your
decision should be based on the complexity of the project and the way your com-
pany operates.
Project Management Software
You’ll notice that this is the ﬁrst time we introduce project management software.
Why? Because having project management software doesn’t mean you can manage a
project anymore than having Microsoft Excel makes you an accountant. Project
management software is simply a tool that can make it easier to manage the project.
Notice we didn’t say deﬁne or plan the project but manage the project. Once the
project gets underway, you have to track a lot of moving parts and that’s where
having a software program can really help; that’s why this is the ﬁrst time we’ve
referred to a software program. For smaller projects, you may be able to track the
www.syngress.com
350
Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

project in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook (with calendar and tasks), or on paper
(gasp). For anything with a lot of moving parts, a project management software pro-
gram is almost mandatory. Large projects managed in Excel or on paper end up
taking a disproportionate amount of time to track and manage and the cost of a PM
software package quickly becomes justiﬁed.There are numerous online programs
you can rent (ASP model) as well as numerous software packages you can purchase
and install—either as desktop installations or enterprise-wide installations.A discus-
sion of those software tools is outside the scope of this book, but a bit of research on
your part will yield a vast array of choices.Talk to peers in your company or
industry to ﬁnd out what tool(s) they recommend since every software program
comes with its own set of challenges. For instance, Microsoft Project has a lot of
basic capabilities that help manage the project schedule but it is somewhat lacking in
reporting ﬂexibility and capabilities. (Microsoft Project 2003 addresses some of these
issues; older versions can be a challenge.) Each tool has its limitations so you really
just need to ﬁgure out which limitations are easiest for you to work with.
Once you create your WBS, you may choose to enter your tasks into the soft-
ware program. Some people like to deﬁne their tasks and put them in sequence
before entering them into the software program. Regardless of when you enter your
task data, make sure you don’t confuse the software tool process for the project man-
agement process.The software tool won’t necessarily help you with your IT PM
processes, it will simply track what you enter.The most helpful part of any project
management software program is the ability to manage a changing schedule and to
identify risks to the project via the critical path. We’ll discuss critical path more in
just a moment.The outcome of this step should be a WBS with task owners and
completion criteria.The document is listed in Figure 9.3 and this should be added
to your project plan for sponsor approval.The entire plan will be presented for pro-
ject sponsor approval prior to starting project work, and we’ll discuss this at the end
of this chapter.

Figure 9.3 Work Breakdown Structure, Task Owners, and Completion Criteria
Task Details
The WBS and the tasks that are developed should contain enough detail that the
project is very well deﬁned at this point. While you have not yet developed the
schedule or the budget, the work to be accomplished during the project (scope and
requirements) should be evident in the breakdown of project work.The tasks should
contain needed detail, and the following list contains some of the elements you may
want to include in your task detail. Depending on the nature and type of project
you’re working on, some of these details may not be helpful, but this will give you a
starting point for developing a template of your own for required task detail.You can
also download the task detail template from the Syngress website.
Task details help deﬁne the task, the quality expected, and other details
including:
■
Task name (noun/verb format)
■
Task number (if used)
■
Task owner (one person)
■
Task contributors (one or more people who may work on task)
■
Task detail (longer description of task)
■
Completion criteria
■
Entry/exit criteria (if any)
■
Quality metrics
■
Requirements or speciﬁcations
■
Required resources
■
Task deadline (if any)
■
Estimated start date
■
Duration (length of time allotted for completion of task)
■
Effort (amount of actual work time needed for completion)

You can see from this list of task details that there’s a lot of information to be
developed, which is why it’s best to have the task owner develop (or delegate the
development of) these details. Remember, a task owner doesn’t necessarily complete
the work; he or she is responsible for ensuring the task is completed successfully
according to speciﬁcations. If you’re not sure the task owner will deliver, you’ve got
to make some decisions about how to handle the situation because the success of the
project is built upon the successful completion of tasks.
Functional and Technical Requirements
We discussed developing functional and technical requirements earlier in the book,
but this is a good time to review those requirements.You may need to modify func-
tional or technical requirements based on the development of your WBS. For
instance, if your WBS deﬁnes a scope that is larger than your requirements, you’ve
got scope creep starting.You should go back and modify your WBS so that the tasks
only describe the total amount of work needed to meet requirements (scope, time,
cost, quality, and functional and technical requirements). On the other hand, if your
WBS doesn’t fully address your functional or technical requirements, you have a dis-
connect and you’ll need to modify your WBS to address all the requirements.This is
where you have a great opportunity to check, double-check, and triple-check your
project’s scope and make absolutely sure it meets the functional and technical
requirements.This is a stress point for projects and is a common point at which
problems begin to develop.The problem is that when issues develop at this point,
www.syngress.com
Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
353

they often ﬂy under the radar until they show up with a vengeance somewhere
down the line. Identifying and correcting disconnects here is vital to project success.
Every IT project will have different functional and technical requirements, so
there is no “one size ﬁts all” in this case. However, functional and technical speciﬁca-
tions do have common elements and if you’d like a framework against which to
review your project’s functional and technical speciﬁcations, you can download the
requirements templates from the Syngress website.

Selecting Project Management Software Tools
Each project management software tool has its own “personality.” The key to
selecting the right program for you, your team, and your company is to look at
the features and limitations of each and try to choose one that is the best ﬁt. For
instance, who will be entering and updating task information? One person or the
whole team? Do you need a single desktop program or a shared, networked pro-
gram? Do you need to facilitate collaboration or do you simply need to track task
progress? Take a few minutes to create your own requirements document for
your project management software solution and select one that will ﬁll the bill. 
Creating A Network Diagram 
A network diagram is a tool that helps you and the IT project team graphically rep-
resent the nature of the relationships and dependencies of the project’s tasks. Clearly,
you can’t create the network diagram until you’ve identiﬁed all the project work
packages.You can’t begin to create a realistic schedule until you know about all the
work that must be done, but just having your WBS doesn’t give you the whole pic-
ture. Once the work has been clearly identiﬁed, you can work as a team to ﬁgure
out the logical sequencing of activities.The logical sequencing forms the foundation
of the project schedule. We know, for example, that the house painter can’t paint the
trim until the walls have been put up and the walls can’t be erected until the foun-
dation has been poured and set.These are examples of constraints or dependencies.

Network Diagramming Methods
There are several different ways you can create your network diagram. We won’t
cover them in detail, but if you’re interested, you can do some independent
research to learn more about methods that interest you.
■
Arrow Diagramming Method (ADM) Uses nodes to represent
events and arrows to represent activity duration.
■
Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM) Uses nodes to represent
activity duration and connectors to show precedence and dependen-
cies (this is a commonly used method).
■
Program Evaluation and Review Techniques (PERT) Uses weighted
average for duration to calculate project completion time/date.
Average includes optimistic duration, most-likely duration, and pes-
simistic duration estimates.
■
Critical Path Method (CPM) Uses sequential network logic with a
single estimated duration for each task (rather than weighted aver-
ages). This is a method and should not be confused with the critical
path itself.
■
Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT) Uses proba-
bility sequencing and duration estimates. GERT is an advanced
method of creating a network diagram.
Sequencing is a function of logical, desirable, and feasible timing for all project
tasks. For instance, some sequence of activities might be logical but not desirable.
Other sequencing may appear to be desirable, but it’s just not feasible.The ﬁrst step in
creating a detailed project schedule is creating the sequencing for tasks and this is best
done through a network diagram.There is no requirement that you create a network
diagram; there are other ways you may have used in the past to create the optimal
sequence for your project tasks, but a network diagram is a commonly used tool.There
are four common methods of creating a network diagram, but we’re going to focus on
the most commonly used (and easiest to use) method: Precedence Diagramming Method
(PDM). Many project management software programs, including Microsoft Project, use
some sort of PDM (various hybrids exist).You can create your network diagram by
entering your tasks, sequences, dependencies, and constraints into your PM software
www.syngress.com
Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
355

tool and allow the program to create the network diagram for you, or you can create
the diagram by hand. One popular method is to write the tasks on sticky notes and
physically create your network diagram by placing the sticky notes on a white board
and drawing lines for dependencies.This way, it’s easy for everyone to see and visualize
and it’s easy to move things around.While it might sound a bit archaic, it’s a very
effective and efﬁcient method for working with your team on task sequencing.We’ve
thrown around three terms: sequence, constraints, and dependencies. Let’s discuss them
with regard to your WBS and your project schedule.
Sequence The sequence in which tasks should be started, worked on, or
completed is your starting point. Most of the tasks in the project have some
sort of logical sequence and that might be your best starting point. Once
you’ve put tasks in their logical sequence, you have to begin thinking about
other elements that will affect the sequence. Once tasks are in logical order,
have the team look at the sequence and see if anything jumps out at them.
For instance, someone might note that Task 4 logically follows Task 2, but it
would be more desirable if it followed Task 5 instead. Someone might iden-
tify a logical sequence that is simply not feasible.Yes, it would be great if we
could do Task 11 and 14 at the same time, but they require the same
resource, so it’s just not feasible.
Constraints Once you and your team have identiﬁed the most logical,
desirable, feasible sequence, you have to begin looking at any constraints in
place.You should refer back to your project document where you may have
identiﬁed some project constraints early on. For instance, now that you’re
getting closer to knowing when the project will start and how long it will
take, there may be constraints such as availability of key resources or outside
vendors that will impact your schedule. One of the most common con-
straints is that a required resource is not available when needed or that two
or more tasks require the same resource at the same time.
Dependencies Dependencies between tasks often mean that one task
cannot start until another is complete. Using our home-building analogy,
you can’t put the walls up until the foundation is set.That’s a ﬁnish-to-start
dependency because Task A (foundation) must be ﬁnished before Task B
(walls) can start.There are other types of dependencies, but this is the most
common one and the default type of dependency used in most project
management software programs.The four dependencies are depicted in
Table 9.1 below.

Ideally, the two tasks ﬁnish at
the same or nearly same time.
For instance, if you’re
installing network cabling in a
new location, the technician
putting the wall plate on in
each ofﬁce (where the com-
puter cable will connect in the
wall to the network cable)
can’t complete the task until
the network cable is pulled to
that location. Ideally, as the
cable is being pulled, the
technician begins putting on
wall plates so that when the
cable-pulling is complete, so
too is the face plate installa-
tion. In many cases, improp-
erly terminated cables can
result in network problems, so
you’d want the pulling of the
cables and the installation of
the connecting wall plates to
ﬁnish at about the same time.

The IT Factor…
Network Diagramming Guidelines
There are a number of guidelines that you should keep in mind as you create your
network diagram. These guidelines are designed to help you prevent overlooking
key elements such as critical dependencies.
1. Use milestones to create a high-level diagram if you’re not sure
where to start.
2. Make sure all of the tasks are included in the diagram.
3. Make sure the relationship between a task and its dependencies is
correct.
4. Make sure that all tasks that can be done simultaneously are shown
in the diagram as such.
5. Look for hidden dependencies including entry and exit criteria and
operational boundaries. Use subject matter experts to assist in this to
ensure you’re not overlooking critical data.
Milestones
If you’re not sure where to start in creating your network diagram, begin with mile-
stones. When do certain phases have to begin or end? If you know where your
milestones are, you can then begin to put your tasks in the right order to meet these
milestones.Two things to note: don’t diagram the relationship between a task and a
summary task (a summary task is comprised of all related sub-tasks) and don’t dia-
gram the relationship between summary tasks and milestones. Summary tasks are not
actually tasks themselves, but a roll-up (summary) of groups of linked tasks. Link to
the speciﬁc task that forms the dependency or to the milestone at the end of the
group of tasks instead.
Creating the Diagram
Let’s look at a portion of a network diagram, shown in Figure 9.4, created in
Microsoft Project. Notice that you can’t develop server specs until you’ve developed
hardware specs (this may not be true in all projects, but it is true for this project).
www.syngress.com
Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
359

The software specs in this case are dependent upon the hardware specs.The ordering
of the enterprise application depends on the completion of the software specs (a
ﬁnish-to-start dependency). Notice that once the hardware specs are completed, two
paths are created.The top path that begins with “Develop software specs” is not on
the critical path (in Microsoft Project’s network diagram, all tasks on the critical path
are shown in red, though you can’t see red in this black and white diagram).The
path that begins with “Develop server specs” is the critical path and is shown in red
in the software program.A delay to any task on the ﬁrst path will not necessarily
delay the project (though it could) but a delay on the second path will delay the
entire project.
Figure 9.4 Network Diagram
Your network diagram may be more bunched up or more spread out, depending
on how many tasks of the project can run simultaneously. Look for places in the
project where you can run tasks in parallel to decrease the overall length of the pro-
ject where possible. Since the project management software programs are rather
linear in nature, it often causes people to look at things in a very linear manner.This
sometimes causes people to overlook the fact that many tasks can be started at just
about any time in the project or that they have a lot of ﬂexibility as to when partic-
ular tasks start or must ﬁnish. Keep this in mind as you sequence your tasks.
www.syngress.com
360
Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

Critical Path
We’ve deﬁned the critical path as the longest, least ﬂexible path through the project.
This does not mean the path containing the most “critical” tasks (however you
deﬁne “critical”) in the project but those that, if delayed, put your project schedule
at risk. Remember when we deﬁned our ﬂexibility matrix? That comes into play
here because if schedule is your least ﬂexible element, you may have to come up
with alternatives, such as hiring additional help, to meet your schedule. If your crit-
ical path puts your schedule at risk and your schedule is the least ﬂexible element,
you’ll have to ﬁgure out ways to deal with this. On the other hand, if schedule is
most ﬂexible and budget is least ﬂexible, you may need to re-arrange your schedule
in a way that reduces expenses such as allowing more time for the completion of
tasks so you don’t incur overtime.
Having your network diagram available (either in the software program or on a
white board) can help you identify problems in your sequence and high-level
schedule. It can be an excellent way to visualize the project and determine the way
to sequence tasks to meet project parameters.You don’t have to have PM software to
create your network diagram and to determine your critical path. Figure 9.5 shows a
network diagram using a block diagram style. In this case, it’s likely that Task 6 has
an external constraint of some type that prevents it from starting any sooner than it
does, though its start time is not dependent upon the other tasks in the project. In
this case, both the second (Tasks 2,5,7) and third (Tasks 6, 8) paths through the pro-
ject appear to be the critical path. However, by deﬁnition, the longest, least ﬂexible
path is the critical path, which in this case is comprised of Tasks 1, 2, 5, and 7. If Task
6 is delayed, it might also delay the project, and at that point the critical path might
shift from Task 1-2-5-7 to Task 1-6-8.The point to remember is that your critical
path may change through the life of the project if tasks are delayed to the point
where they will push your entire project schedule out. Identifying these possible
problem areas is much easier with a network diagram than if you were simply
looking at all these tasks in a list of start and ﬁnish dates.

Figure 9.5 Block Diagram of Network
Slack and Float
You may have heard the term slack or ﬂoat associated with project tasks or schedules.
They are used interchangeably and refer to the amount of time an activity can be
delayed without delaying the rest of the project.To use the information from Figure
9.4, we know that “Develop software specs” is not on the critical path. Still, if that
activity is delayed long enough, the other tasks on that path will be delayed and they
could eventually (if delayed long enough) end up on the critical path. Clearly, if any
task in the project is delayed long enough, it could put the project at risk (if not, you
might ask if the task should be done at all). Here’s another example: suppose users
need to be trained on the new features of an enterprise application that is going to
be upgraded. Users are already familiar with the product and simply need a short
four-hour training session to get them up to speed on new features.This training,
hypothetically, could occur any time before the actual product rollout and not delay
the completion of the project. Certainly, there are some optimal timeframes for
training in this case, but the training can be said to have a certain amount of ﬂoat or
slack. For instance, it might be scheduled for one month prior to application rollout,
but it might have two weeks of ﬂoat meaning that it could be pushed out two weeks
and still not delay the project.That gives you a bit of ﬂexibility in case the training is
delayed or in case the trainer is out sick for a week. Identifying slack in your tasks is
an important part of scheduling because it will let you know where you have tasks
that can be moved to accommodate problems that might pop up in scheduling. It
also lets you know where you might have resources available to apply to problem
areas if the going gets tough. Some people indicate slack on the task in their dia-
grams (if you use PM software, you can enter slack or ﬂoat and it will be shown in
the network diagram) so they can visually see where they have a bit of leeway.

Remember, tasks on the critical path almost always have zero ﬂoat, which is how
they end up on the critical path in the ﬁrst place. If a task has no ﬂoat, it is “least
ﬂexible” and cannot budge.Tasks with ﬂoat are typically not on the critical path
because the reason that they can be moved around a bit to accommodate other
changes.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Identify the slack or ﬂoat that exists for tasks in your project. This will
help you make decisions more easily when something changes (and it
will). Understanding which tasks have ﬂoat and which ones don’t will
help you make better decisions about how to allocate resources and will
make your scheduling more efﬁcient. Since the critical path may shift if
too many tasks have zero ﬂoat, make sure you know which tasks can
shift around and which ones absolutely cannot.
Once you’ve identiﬁed duration and ﬂoat (or slack, whichever term you prefer),
you can add that data to your network diagram, as shown in Figure 9.6. Once
you’ve added that data, you can easily calculate your critical path by adding up the
longest, least ﬂexible path. Using Figure 9.6, you can see that Tasks 1, 3, and 4 add
up to 7 days’ duration and have 6 total days of ﬂoat.The second path, which includes
Tasks 1, 2, 5, and 7, has a total duration of 11 days and 0 days of ﬂoat.The third
path,Tasks 1, 6, and 8 have a total duration of 5 days and 7 days of ﬂoat. Clearly,
then, the critical path is the second path. When you have these types of duration and
ﬂoat estimates, you can more easily visualize your critical path. Once you know
which tasks are on the critical path, you can take steps to ensure that these tasks
remain on schedule.

Creating the Project Schedule
You’ve created a list of all project work (the WBS), estimated the duration of each
task, and put them in the sequence that makes the most sense at this point.The
question is, how long will these tasks actually take? The sequence of tasks may be
dependent upon resource availability, but the schedule is deﬁnitely dependent upon
resource availability. Some of that is related to the estimated duration of a task. If
Resource A is needed for Tasks 1, 2, 5, and 6 (see Figure 9.5), you have a problem
since Task 5 and Task 6 are currently sequenced to run in parallel.These are the
types of conﬂicts that should come to light during the sequencing and/or scheduling
phase. Since Task 5 is on the critical path, it means you’ll need to ﬁnd another
resource to complete Task 6 if you don’t want to put the project at risk. If some of

the tasks have enough ﬂoat, this may resolve the conﬂict, which is why creating a
more detailed network diagram (see Figure 9.6) can reveal those elements as well.
You should document any assumptions you’re making about your schedule so
that you can be very clear about what is and is not going to happen. It might be
acceptable to assume that a promised resource will be available when you need it,
but if it might put your project at risk, you should list it as an assumption. We’ll dis-
cuss risk later in this chapter, but for now, list any assumptions you’re making about
the schedule so that they are explicitly stated. If those assumptions are incorrect, your
project team, subject matter experts, or the project sponsor can clearly see those
assumptions and challenge or correct them.
Once you’ve sequenced your tasks, you can enter them into your project man-
agement software program so you can begin to develop your schedule (if you aren’t
using PM software, you can enter your tasks in Excel or in a table in Word, on a
white board, or on a piece of paper).A sample project schedule is shown in Figure
9.8 and shows a Gantt chart, which is a graphical depiction of the schedule.The
summary tasks are indicated by the long black bars that run from the start to ﬁnish
of a group of sub-tasks, in this case in rows 1 and 9.These are the “roll up” of the
tasks beneath them and are not in themselves distinct tasks.

In creating your project schedule, there are several areas that might trip you up.
We’ve listed a few common things to watch out for so your schedule has a good
chance for success right off the bat.
1.
Present timeline information in a format that matches the audience needs
(executives need high-level milestones, while project participants need
detailed schedules, etc.).
2.
Identify areas of potential organizational conﬂict including vacations, holi-
days, company events, or other large project dates.
3.
Identify areas of resource scheduling conﬂicts and resource competition
(coordinate with other project managers, functional managers, vendors,
etc.).
4.
Provide supporting detail when necessary (risk assessment and contingen-
cies for the schedule, resource requirements, timing or estimates, alternative
schedules).
Skills and Scheduling
Placing tasks in their most logical and optimal sequence is the ﬁrst step in creating
your IT project schedule.The second step is to identify the resources needed for
each of these deﬁned tasks (or work packages).You have already identiﬁed needed
resources and skills for the project, but now is the time you have to match those
skills and resources (people and equipment) to speciﬁc tasks that are scheduled at
deﬁned times.There are a lot of moving parts at this point, so start by matching skills
and resources to tasks.After you’ve created your optimal pairings, you can then go
back through and look at areas where resources may be double-booked, have con-
ﬂicting schedule requirements, or have no resources assigned. Remember, the ﬁrst
step is to create the most optimal schedule and then modify it to match reality. If
you start with reality ﬁrst, you will almost certainly miss opportunities for optimal
scheduling.

Enterprise 128 …
Start, Stop and Duration
Every task must have a start and stop date in order to have a duration. One inex-
perienced project manager wanted to create tasks that only had stop dates
because he said he didn’t care how long it took someone to get it done, as long
as it was completed by a certain date. The problem was that he was managing
the high-level tasks and was not looking at the lower-level tasks of the WBS. If all
you care about are completion dates and someone else is actually managing the
lower-level details, you may want to use milestones for those completion dates
and roll up those lower-level tasks into a master project plan. One way or
another, all tasks have to have a start and stop date in order for work to be com-
pleted on time. Milestones can be used to indicate required completion dates,
but a project with nothing but milestones is a summary, not a project plan.
Schedules: Padding Versus Reserves
When it comes to building a project schedule (the same holds true for project bud-
gets, which we’ll discuss later in this chapter), many IT project managers are tempted
to add in a bit of “fudge factor” to give them some wiggle room when things start
to get off track. Many projects’ schedules do start shifting to the right (later in time)
once things get underway. However, that’s no reason to pad your estimates. Let’s look
at the difference between padding and reserves.
Padding
Padding is the practice of taking an estimate and adding some number (usually dol-
lars, hours, or percentages) to the estimate to give you some wiggle room. If you
think a task will take 16 hours, you might record it as 24 hours to give yourself
some cushion.There are two problems with doing that. First, you lose sight of how
long you really think the task will take. Later, when you go back to review perfor-
mance against plan, you really don’t know what you’re comparing.You’ll know
you’re comparing actual against some number you made up, but what number and
based on what? The second problem is that it becomes a bit of a problem having
padded estimates all the way down the line. If David pads his time (or cost) estimates
by 10% and Louisa pads her time estimate by 8% and Amadou pads his time estimate
by 12%, you can see that your project schedule begins stretching out into eternity.
www.syngress.com
Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
367

The danger? Your project sponsor might balk and consider canceling the project if
you can’t get it done any sooner than projected and you have no idea how long
these folks really think things will take.
Another danger of padding is that in some instances, it becomes unethical or
perhaps illegal.Though these are only time (or cost) estimates, they may become part
of a contract, Statement of Work, Project Charter, or other legal document in which
case there may be legal or ethical issues to consider.
Reserves
A better way to handle the uncertainty of time or cost in an IT project is to use a
concept called a reserve. Rather than padding each task’s time or cost estimate, you
create a reserve amount (of time or money) for each major task. For instance, using
our network upgrade project example, you might calculate 10% of your total server
budget and add that to your server budget as a reserve.Then, if you need to upgrade
a disk drive or add memory to one or more servers (or if prices increase by the time
you purchase them), you’re covered.You did not hide your estimated cost by ran-
domly adding some amount to it. Instead, you listed your estimated amount and
added to that a discrete, clearly deﬁned reserve amount.You can do this with time as
well. If your very best estimate is that it will take three days to set up and test each
server, you have a nine day task (three servers, unless you create a separate task for
each server setup).You might add one day to that task as a reserve amount. However,
you don’t change the task duration or time estimate, you add one day to your sched-
uled reserve.The reserve is an amount (percentage or actual number) that is placed
into your schedule or budget to allow for time or cost overruns.
Reserve is then totaled up for each major task or objective and added to the
schedule or budget. If a task ends up taking more time than scheduled, you deduct the
overage from your reserve. If a task takes less time than scheduled, you can add the
amount of unused time to the reserve. In fact, a reserve acts a lot like a savings account
and should be used as such.Table 9.2 shows an example of schedule reserve for a
hypothetical house-building project. Let’s look at a few of the items in this table.The
site location has a 15% reserve because it might take longer to get a site survey than
you expect due to heavy market demand. Pouring the foundation has a 25% reserve
because market demand for new housing is so high that concrete is in short supply.
Framing has a low reserve because the framing takes only a few days and there are
plenty of carpenters in your area.The exterior ﬁnishing has a 15% reserve because
weather may delay some of the exterior tasks. Interior tasks will not be delayed by
weather, so the reserve is 5%.Though landscaping may also be delayed by weather, it is
a short job and has far more ﬂexibility, so it’s given a low reserve.Your total reserve,
www.syngress.com
368
Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

then, is calculated to be 24.25 days, which averages out to 11% of your total schedule
(you may want to use a weighted average or the mean rather than a simple average).
Thus, your optimistic schedule indicates that everything happens as you plan.The pes-
simistic schedule indicates you’ll use every one of your reserve days.The “most likely”
schedule is in between.There may be standards or industry practices in your particular
ﬁeld that are used for reserves and if that’s the case, you can take some of the guess-
work out of your project schedule. If you’ve done similar projects in the past (or even
similar sub-sections or project phases) in the past, you can reuse those estimates. Make
sure you look at project results versus schedules if you’re using historical data so you
can see what another IT PM thought would happen versus what actually happened.
This will give you a good view into potential problems and may allow you to avoid
some of those problems right from the start.

You may need to educate your project sponsor about this concept and about how
reserves work. It’s important that the project sponsor support your efforts to run a
“clean” project and that you be held accountable for the total schedule and total
budget (including reserves) rather than individual task time or cost estimates. If your
project sponsor is reluctant to do that, have him or her read this section of the chapter.

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Some IT project managers are hesitant to use the reserve method
because they’re afraid someone from management will knock their
reserve amounts down and push them into shorter schedules and tighter
budgets. Let’s face it: whether you use a reserve amount or padded esti-
mates, you’re going to be pushed to do the project faster and with less
money. The key is how you record and utilize the reserves. If you create
discrete time and cost reserves, you can utilize the “savings account”
notion and track your variance closely. This gives you cleaner data about
your project and helps you hone your estimating skills. When you go
back and compare plan to actual, you’ll be comparing your (or
someone’s) best estimate with actual. You can use this data to trou-
bleshoot your estimates so your estimates will be more accurate in the
future. If you ﬁnd the variance was an anomaly, you can make a note of
it and move on. Padding obscures results, creating reserves clariﬁes
them. To become better at your job, use reserves and avoid padding.
This means you’ll need to educate your team and get them to give you
real estimates as well. Though this might require a bit of education,
assurance, and commitment on your part, once the team understands
how reserves work, they’ll come around.
The deliverable for this planning task is a “ﬁnal” schedule.The word “ﬁnal” is
relative here because one of the major responsibilities of an IT project manager is to
manage the inevitable changes to the schedule that will occur. However, you have to
draw a line in the sand and start somewhere and this schedule, once approved, will
become the baseline against which you measure variance and progress. Figure 9.9
shows the deliverable as a schedule to be included in your project plan for ﬁnal pro-
ject sponsor approval, which we’ll discuss at the end of this chapter.

Creating the Project Budget
With your WBS in hand, you can also develop a fairly detailed budget.The ideal sit-
uation is that the task owner will develop the task cost. For instance, a painter knows
how long it will take to paint a room and he or she is also probably the best person
to tell you how many gallons of paint it will take.The painter might also be well
acquainted with the cost of paint and can give you a cost estimate that is fairly 
accurate.
There are some instances when someone in Finance or Accounting develops
your project budget based on the data given. In those cases, you might be working
with purchasers to purchase IT equipment or others outside your immediate IT pro-
ject team. Some companies have Finance create the budget based on past experience
and with limited input from the IT department. Clearly, there are pros and cons to
each of these methods.
Also keep in mind there may be hidden expenses such as indirect costs or over-
head that will be added to your project costs. Work with your Accounting depart-
ment to determine what these additional costs might be and how you should
account for them in your project budget.
It’s a good idea to document assumptions you’re making about costs for your pro-
ject. If you assume that particular resources will be available or that a particular price
range will be available for large purchases, you should note those assumptions.When
the project sponsor reviews your budget, he or she can review the assumptions and
clarify or challenge any assumptions that might be incorrect or unacceptable.
Ideally, you will create your own IT project budget based on the WBS. Once
you have a list of all tasks to be completed, you can calculate the cost of each task.
Some IT projects have to track time against the project as a ﬁxed unit cost. For
instance, software engineers may be billed to the project at one ﬁxed rate and IT
technicians at a different ﬁxed rate. Other IT projects require speciﬁc cost data to be
collected such as the wages and beneﬁts cost of each individual software engineer as
well as that of all other individuals working on the project.This is a much more
detailed approach but yields a truer cost picture. In cases where the project is being
billed or charged against some set resource (client, grant, investor funding, etc.),
tracking costs with this level of precision may be very important. In other cases,
labor is not even tracked as a cost because the company assumes it is paying wages
and beneﬁts as part of its overhead costs. So, in some projects, the only things that
would count as costs are things that must be purchased such as servers, network
cabling, test equipment, etc.

Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
371

To create your IT project budget:
1.
Create cost estimates for each work package (task) either by using calcula-
tions, historical data, or subject matter experts.
2.
Roll up the cost of all tasks for the project.At the major task, deliverable, or
phase point, add appropriate reserves.
3.
Compare your calculated project budget with the project budget assigned
or approved by the project sponsor.
4.
Reconcile any budget differences through either increasing the budget or
reducing the scope, increasing the time, or reducing the quality of the pro-
ject (remember the four elements: scope = time x cost x quality? If the
budget changes, something else also has to change).
To create your budget, go through each task in your WBS and add the cost of
that task to your tally. Best practices suggest that you create a subtotal for each major
deliverable and create a reserve amount at that level. For instance, you might decide
that there’s a low chance for budget overruns during the network design phase, so
you give it a 5% reserve. However, you decide there’s a high chance for budget over-
runs in the server testing phase (the phase where you purchase and test your servers),
so you add a 20% reserve for that phase. During the installation phase, you are fairly
conﬁdent that your costs are well known and you’re comfortable with an additional
10% reserve for additional cabling or replacement parts. In your testing and moni-
toring phase, you may believe there is a low chance for budget overruns and you
assign a 5% reserve to that phase.Thus, none of your estimates are padded and
you’ve intelligently managed potential overruns by reviewing the likelihood of
occurrence during each phase of the project.This is a cleaner, more effective way to
manage your budget and it keeps everything aboveboard.
By going through your tasks and identifying budget items, you’ll probably come
up with a budget that is fairly accurate. However, sometimes in creating the tasks,
task owners have omitted critical data such as the need for equipment or supplies.
The reserve amount may account for that; you can also use the IT project budget
checklist from the Syngress website to give you a running start.
Estimating Cash Flow
You may be asked to provide an estimate of cash ﬂow during the project. Some
companies require the IT project manager to provide this, others don’t. Regardless,
it’s good to get in the habit of looking at cash ﬂow since you may someday be called
upon to develop a cash ﬂow estimate. Companies often need this with large expen-
www.syngress.com
372
Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

ditures because they need to budget accordingly. If your project is short or fairly
low-cost, this may not be needed. Figure 9.10 shows a sample cash ﬂow diagram.
Figure 9.10 IT Project Cash Flow Example
Implementing Cost Control
The degree to which you attempt to control costs is directly related to your ﬂexi-
bility matrix. Even if cost is the most ﬂexible, you will still try to control your costs,
but cost may increase to accommodate your least ﬂexible parameters. For instance, if
your schedule is least ﬂexible then you may have to add people to critical tasks to
stay on schedule.You may have budgeted for this because you were aware of the
potential for this problem (we’ll discuss risk management later), but this is one place
where your costs can slip. If cost is more ﬂexible than schedule, your reserves should
reﬂect this (more reserve in cost than schedule) and you should make conscious,
deliberate decisions to use your reserve to keep your schedule on track (rather than
getting wrapped around the axle because your cost reserves are being used up).
That said, you’ll need to work to contain and control your costs and that should
start with a cost baseline.This is the total project cost broken down by phases, major
deliverables, or tasks (as appropriate) with your clearly marked reserve amount or
percentage. Next you should develop (if you haven’t already) change control pro-
cesses. Changes in the scope or nature of the project is the number one place costs
creep (or stumble) into a project, so managing change is critical to managing costs.

As with scope management, you should have a clear process for managing changes
to costs.A cost change control procedure need not be complicated or detailed, but it
should require someone to note the original (baseline) cost, the new estimated cost,
the reason for the change, and the people impacted by the change (if any). It should
also have clear parameters for when a cost increase must be approved and by whom
(cost reductions are both rare and welcomed, and they rarely need approval).
You can use the following list to help control your costs:
1.
Control causes of change to ensure change is needed.
2.
Control and document changes to cost baseline as they occur.
3.
Control changes to the project and note their impact on project cost.
4.
Monitor costs regularly and understand the impact of cost variances to the
project.
5.
Record cost changes in a timely manner to keep project cost data current.
6.
Prevent unauthorized changes to the project or project cost baseline.
7.
Communicate cost changes to appropriate stakeholders and get approval
when needed.
The project budget should be developed and submitted for approval by the pro-
ject sponsor along with the rest of the project plan.The budget is typically delin-
eated in a spreadsheet and any notes or comments related to the budget can be
included in the spreadsheet or as an additional document. It is typically a separate
document (depicted in Figure 9.11) that is included with the project plan.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Remember, your project has four elements: scope, time, cost, and
quality. Previously, we discussed understanding the relative ﬂexibility of
each of these elements so you could better manage your project. If
budget is your least ﬂexible element, you should implement very clear,
concise cost control processes in your project. You don’t want team
members approving budget expenditures without your knowledge
unless those expenditures are within certain parameters. Creating clear
guidelines for team members about budgetary items will help reduce
your stress and will help keep team members inside acceptable parame-
ters. If budget is your least ﬂexible item, make sure your project sponsor
is aware that other things may shift such as schedule, scope, or quality.

Figure 9.11 Project Budget with Reserves
Identifying Project Risks
By now it should be clear to you that there are many different kinds of project risks.
The question is, which ones should you deal with? If you spent all your time
addressing every possible project risk, you’d either end up in planning gridlock get-
ting nothing done or you’d decide to scrap the project because you can’t address all
the risks.The key to risk management is to identify the risks that are both likely to
occur and harmful if they do occur. Some project risks are highly likely to occur, but
not particularly harmful, and you would deal with them as you would any minor
inconvenience. Other project risks are not particularly likely to occur, but would be
harmful if they did occur.This might include a natural disaster that destroyed the
ofﬁce building or destroyed the project work already accomplished. Most project
risks fall someplace in between these two types of risks.
There are essentially three steps in IT project risk management: risk identiﬁca-
tion, risk quantiﬁcation, and risk mitigation. Let’s take a closer look at these three
elements.
Identify IT Project Risks
The ﬁrst step in planning for and managing project risk is to identify all known pro-
ject risks.This is a good opportunity to get the IT project team together (make sure
you have some analyzer types included, as they are often particularly good at this
type of exercise) to identify risks.The ﬁrst step is to determine what could go wrong
with the project. Here’s a list of potential problems to get you started, but you
should certainly add to this list to address your project’s particular risks.
■
External risks War, civil unrest/disruption, economic ﬂuctuations, polit-
ical unrest/change, natural disasters, etc.
■
Organizational risks Corporate cash ﬂow issues, business disruption
(strike, natural disaster, etc.), union contract status/negotiation, union con-
tract terms, corporate shakeup, executive turnover.

Budget
Result: 
Baseline project budget with reserves

■
Project risks Resource conﬂict, budget constraints, vendor/supplier
issues, technology changes, skill sets (training), shifting priorities, project
sponsor change, risk to any task on the critical path, etc..
Remember that your IT project’s risks come in many different forms—from
external to internal. Make sure you scan the horizon for all potential risks that may
impact your project. If you have people on your team who always see the dark side
of things, this is their time to shine. Utilize that skill to root out potential problems.
Don’t let the meeting spiral down into endless negativity, though. Manage the team
so that the outcome of this exercise is clear—a list of all potential project risks, not a
doomsday report.
The IT Factor…
360 View of Risks
Project risks come in all shapes and sizes. It’s important that you take a full view
of project risks so you don’t inadvertently miss any risks that have a high likeli-
hood of occurrence and a high project impact. One method is to look at each task
in your WBS and evaluate it for risk. While this might seem like a large task, you
could ask task owners to identify risks to their tasks. These risks can then be com-
piled (there will likely be some overlap) to create your project risk list. There are
types of project risks that are sometimes overlooked. The need for team training,
the need to hire outside contractors, and the need for resources that are not
available when needed are all risks to the project that might be overlooked or
downplayed. We tend to look for (or recognize) the big risks and sometimes miss
the smaller, but equally critical project risks.
Quantify IT Project Risk
Once you’ve identiﬁed your project’s risks, you’ll need to quantify and qualify them.
Different companies have different ways of approaching this exercise, so if your com-
pany has a speciﬁc method for assessing risk, feel free to use that for your project.
Otherwise, you should sort your list twice. First, you should go through your list of
risks and sort them from most likely to occur to least likely to occur. If you want,
you can use a numbering system and give the smallest numbers to the risks least
likely to occur. Use a numbering system such as 5 = highest likelihood and 1 =
lowest likelihood (or 50 through 1 if you want to use a somewhat “weighted” scale).
www.syngress.com
376
Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

If you sort that list in descending order, you should end up with the risks with the
highest likelihood of occurrence at the top of your list. Next, go through your
sorted list a second time.This time, rank the risk in terms of the impact to the pro-
ject should that risk occur.Again, use larger numbers for those with the highest
impact and use the same numbering system as you did for your likelihood rating (5
= highest impact, 1 = lowest impact for example). Now, tally up the totals for each
risk.Your resulting list should have the risks with both the highest likelihood of
occurrence and the highest impact to the project listed at the top.
The next question that naturally arises is how many risks should you plan for?
Clearly, you can’t (and shouldn’t) plan for every single risk. How far down you plan
is a matter of your project’s precision. If you recall from our discussion earlier in the
book, precision is how much planning and detail are required for any given step in a
project. If your least ﬂexible element of the project is project scope, you should look
at your project risks with that in mind and deal with all risks that put your project’s
scope at risk.You may also look at your sorted list and see a natural dividing point.
For instance, you might ﬁnd that your sorted list has 10 project risks with a com-
bined score of 25 or higher because the next risk on the list has a combined score of
12.That gap clearly denotes a change in the nature of the identiﬁed risks and might
be a natural stopping point in terms of planning (we’ll discuss planning for project
risks in just a moment).
Finally, make sure you look at your project’s critical path tasks and critical path
schedule and compare them with the project’s identiﬁed risks. Make sure that you’ve
accounted for risks to the critical path and that those critical path risks are on your
list of risks to plan for. It’s likely they’re accounted for because their impact to the
project, should they occur, is the highest. If these risks have a low likelihood of
occurrence, you can still choose to plan for them since they could put your project
schedule at risk.This is where using a little human intelligence can come in quite
handy.After you have your double-sorted, prioritized list, look through it and decide
what you will and won’t plan for.You should plan for risk to whatever degree is
appropriate for your project. If you look at NASA’s Space Shuttle missions, where
human life is at risk, the risk management process is clearly more rigorous (as it
should be) than it would be for a server network upgrade. Don’t get paralyzed at this
point trying to identify and plan for every possible risk, but do use your best judg-
ment to determine how far down your risk list you should plan.
Mitigate IT Project Risk
Once you’ve made a determination as to which risks you’re going to plan for, spend
time with the project team identifying your mitigation strategies. Mitigation strategies
www.syngress.com
Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
377

are alternate plans or strategies you devise to minimize or avoid (mitigate) the
deﬁned risks. Essentially, you are answering three key questions:“What can I change
in the project to reduce or avoid this risk?”“What will I do if this risk occurs?” and
“How will I know if this risk occurs?”
Alternate Plans
Ideally, the best risk mitigation strategy is to avoid the risk altogether. In some cases,
simply identifying a risk provides you (and your team) with alternative ideas about
how to approach a particular task. If you can change a task to avoid a risk altogether,
you’re far better off. Since it’s not always possible to avoid risks, your next course of
action will be to make alternate plans in case that risk occurs. For each selected risk,
you should identify what you’ll do if that risk occurs. For instance, suppose the pro-
ject you’re working on relies upon a particular technology that is in a state of
change.There is a risk that the technology you’ve selected will be the technology
that falls out of favor (perhaps the change is occurring during your deﬁnition or
planning phase) and you’ll need to re-tool to use another, competing technology.
That’s a serious project risk that has both a high likelihood of occurrence and a high
impact to the project. It almost certainly impacts your critical path. So, what should
you do? In some cases, you may choose to delay the project just a bit until it
becomes clear which technology path you should take. In other cases, it might mean
developing two paths, using both technologies, until it becomes clear which direc-
tion to head. If you can select the “right” technology by doing further research,
you’re that much better off. If you can’t, you will have to plan for the best and worst
case scenarios.
Creating alternate plans may yield some fascinating new alternatives that end up
becoming so desirable that you modify the project plan to utilize these new alterna-
tives or you develop ideas for another related project.The exercise of developing
alternatives helps you understand and manage project risk and sometimes leads you
down new paths to better alternatives for this project or other projects. Let’s look at
an example.
Risk Avoidance (or Countermeasure)
Let’s say your project is to upgrade the network infrastructure including upgrading a
customer relationship management (CRM) application that will use a three-tiered
database model. One of the risks you’ve identiﬁed is that a legacy application not
slated for upgrade has to tie into this new application and it lacks the proper inter-
face to do so. Clearly, this problem has a high likelihood of occurrence and a high
impact to the project. It is likely the interface task is on the critical path as well.
www.syngress.com
378
Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

What alternative plans can you and your team devise to address this? There are many
possibilities, though only a few may end up being feasible, logical, desirable, or
affordable (four elements discussed in Chapter 2). For instance, you may choose to
upgrade the legacy application prior to moving forward on this project; you may
choose to write a custom interface to link the legacy and the new applications as
part of this project; you may choose to purchase a third-party interface; you may
choose to outsource the development of a custom interface; you may choose to
incorporate the functionality of the legacy application into this project (which
requires going back and revising your entire project plan including creating a new
problem and mission statement, and revising functional and technical speciﬁcations,
scope deﬁnition, Work Breakdown Structures, etc.).As you can see, there are a range
of choices (you’ll probably be able to think of several other viable alternatives on
your own) and there is no one clear direction to go unless you go back to your pro-
ject deﬁnition and look at the problem the project is trying to solve.At that point,
the best alternative may become clear. In any case, you must choose your best option
and plan accordingly.
Risk Mitigation (or Reduction)
Let’s look at another scenario. Suppose there are three high-proﬁle projects being
planned that all have roughly the same start date.All three projects at one point or
another require the skills of four software developers.You are the IT project manager
for one of these three projects and though you have some great political pull in your
organization, you realize there’s a high likelihood that these four developers will be
busy when your project needs them.You’ve talked with the other IT project man-
agers about the timing of their projects and when they’ll need these developers, but
you also know that timing on projects shifts around a lot. Without the efforts of
these four developers, your project is at risk. With a high likelihood of occurrence
and a high impact to the project, this risk must be planned for.Though you may
have some strategies in mind to avoid the risk altogether, you also know there’s a
chance these developers could be available (of course, we’re assuming for this
example you don’t have a Project or Program Management Ofﬁce overseeing the
allocation of all project resources). One of your risk mitigation strategies might be to
identify external contractors with the requisite skills to perform this work should
your internal developers be unavailable when needed.You may also determine that
the work the four developers must do can actually be done in parallel with other
work and you may be able to modify your task sequence (and therefore schedule) if
these developers are busy when you originally needed them.You might also decide
to use outside contractors for this key work regardless because you can’t risk not
www.syngress.com
Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
379

having these developers available.All of these may be viable alternatives, depending
on your project’s mission and deliverables.All of these potential solutions reduce
your risk as it pertains to the four developers. Some of them reduce your risk to
zero (by deciding to use contractors regardless of internal staff availability), but
increase your costs.
Keep in mind that some of these strategies introduce new risks, so you have to
watch for secondary risks. For instance, if you choose to use outside contractors,
what happens if those contractors simply decide they don’t want to work on your
project because they got a better offer or better project from someone else? What
happens if those contractors fail to deliver as promised? What happens if those con-
tractors don’t have the skills you thought they had? There are a number of new risks
you’ve introduced.Again, many of these can also be mitigated—using contractors
with whom you have worked in the past, contractors who come highly recom-
mended by peers or associates, etc. Still, there are new risks and when you come up
with any alternative plans, you must also assess those risks and address them to the
degree possible.
While it might seem that you could identify risks and alternatives and the risks of
those alternatives and so on for eternity, you really just need to be aware of the fact
that new plans create new risks and you should evaluate the pros and cons before you
head off in a new direction. Using the developer example, you might decide that you
will line up four external contractors, and you’ll actually have one of the contractors
start some of the work and you will use the internal developers as they become avail-
able while the external contractor continues uninterrupted.Whatever arrangement
you choose, make sure you’ve looked at the new risks you’re introducing and try to
ﬁnd a balance between the known risk (your four developers may be busy) and your
new unknown risks (the reliability of untested external contractors).
Triggers
Once you decide which project risks you’re going to address and what you’ll do to
address those risks (either by avoiding them or by minimizing their impact), you then
have to identify triggers. Triggers are the speciﬁc sets of circumstances that must occur
for you to put your alternative plans into action. Using the example of the four
needed software developers who may be busy when you need them, you’ll need to
identify when you will implement “Plan B.” For the sake of argument, let’s say you
chose to identify two external contractors you could use if your internal developers
were busy.You realize it will increase your costs, but you also know that you’ll have
these two contractors’ full time and attention so you may get more productivity from
these two than you might otherwise get from two equivalent internal developers (who
www.syngress.com
380
Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

may be constantly interrupted with questions, pulled into meetings, etc).You’re only
going to use these two external contractors if the internal developers are busy because
your project sponsor does not want to pay for external services if at all possible.When
do you decide it’s time to use those contractors? Obviously you don’t wait until the
day the task is scheduled to start to ﬁnd out those needed resources are busy.At what
point will you decide to use those contractors? Under what circumstances? 
The trigger point for using your contractors may be the projected availability of
the four internal developers one month prior to the beginning of the work package
to which they are assigned. It might also mean that two months before that work is
to begin you work with a technical recruiting ﬁrm to locate the developers you
need or that you contact contractors you’ve worked with in the past and get a verbal
commitment from them. Whatever arrangement you make, you must decide on the
timing of the trigger and what will happen when that trigger occurs.That way,
when it becomes clear that three of the four developers will not be available when
your project needs them, you have a calm, clear plan for moving forward.Add
trigger points as milestones to your project schedule.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Triggers should be clear, unambiguous statements that either yield a
“Go” or “No Go” decision. You and your team members should be abso-
lutely clear when a trigger point has been reached and what the next
steps should be. This helps reduce the number of times you’ll be “run-
ning around with your hair on ﬁre” trying to ﬁgure out what to do
when problems strike.
Risk Mitigation Plan
Your risk mitigation plan should be a list of tasks that are at risk, the level of risk, the
alternate plan, and the trigger point.You may choose to add a few elements such as
who makes the decision to use the alternate plan (the task owner, the project team,
the project manager), who needs to approve the alternative plan (if it involves an
expenditure, does the project sponsor have to sign off?), what the cost of the alterna-
tive is, etc.You can use a format similar to the one shown in Table 9.3 or you can
use whatever format suits you as long as it contains these critical elements. Be sure
to have clear alternatives and triggers so you can easily implement “Plan B” if the
risk occurs and make sure you add in the cost of the alternatives to your budget as

an additional reserve amount that is clearly delineated.These details should be cap-
tured in a document (depicted in Figure 9.12) and included in the project plan.

Planning Project Communications
If you’ve gone this far into your project planning and haven’t communicated with
anyone outside the IT project team yet, you’ve created a huge information void
within your organization. If your deﬁnition and planning phases only take a few days
or a week, you may not need to communicate before this point. Most IT projects
take a bit more planning and if weeks have gone by without a peep from IT about
the project, people start making assumptions—mostly negative (“They don’t know
www.syngress.com
382
Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects
Project

Strategies

Project risk and mitigation strategies document

what they’re doing”,“This project will never get off the ground”). Even if rumors
don’t start ﬂying, you’ve missed a good opportunity to keep people focused on and
excited about the project. Remember, a large portion of project success is deﬁned by
the perception of success by the people involved. Perception is greatly inﬂuenced by
communication, so learn to communicate more frequently even if you don’t know
all the details.
One of the most common reasons given for failing to communicate is that there
were just too many unknowns. Most people don’t like saying “I don’t know” and
techies may be some of the most reluctant.The objection is,“If I don’t know what’s
going on yet, what should I communicate?” It’s not as difﬁcult as many people make it
and there are plenty of ways of saying “I don’t know” that don’t sound quite so clue-
less.A simple e-mail letting people know you’re in the planning stages of the project
and that you expect to have more detailed announcements in the coming weeks might
be sufﬁcient. For instance, you could say,“We are in the planning stages of Project
XYZ.We expect to have a detailed plan available for review by our executive team by
next Friday. In the meantime, you may be hearing from some of our IT project team
members as they gather additional data to nail down the details of this project.Thanks
for your cooperation and we’ll keep you posted as things move forward.”What have
you really said? Basically that you don’t know enough to tell anybody anything but
you will by next Friday.That’s a long way around “I don’t know,” but it provides pro-
ject visibility and lets people know you are moving forward.
There’s a saying in project management that “no news is no news” (as opposed
to the saying “no news is good news”). No news means you have no information
and when you’re working on a project that’s in the planning stages, it also means
your project visibility slowly (or sometimes quickly) fades into the background.This
might mean you have difﬁculty securing promised resources because managers
forgot about your project. It might mean that the expenditures are going to be
delayed because Purchasing forgot to take the necessary steps to procure needed
resources.There are many more reasons to keep your project visible, so communicate
regularly during the deﬁnition and planning stages because project work is not yet
visible to the rest of the organization.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Remember, every IT project involves people, technology, and business.
Communicating effectively impacts all three, but it impacts people the
most. People plan and implement projects, people get project work
done, people determine the success of the project. Communicate well
and your project will be more successful.
www.syngress.com
Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
383

Project Communications Moving Forward
From this point forward, you should have your communication plans in place for
your various stakeholders and you should begin implementing those plans. From the
planning phase through project completion, you should communicate regularly (at
appropriate intervals for each audience) with your stakeholders.This is one area that
many IT project managers fail in and it’s a huge opportunity to inﬂuence the per-
ception of the project. With a bit of planning and practice, you can improve your
project communication skills and the payoff is almost always far greater than the
investment.
Your communications plans and activities should include the following audiences:
■
IT project sponsor
■
IT project team
■
IT project stakeholders
■
Company
■
Executives
Communication Checkpoints
There are various checkpoints you may want to use for your project communica-
tions. Sometimes project phases are good checkpoints, other times you might want
to use project milestones. Whatever checkpoints you use, make sure you identify
them and use them. Some IT project managers create communication sub-plans so
they can roll their communication planning into their project plan.That’s a great
practice but it’s not always required. If you have someone on your IT project team
who is a good communicator, you may delegate project communications planning
and implementation to this team member.Together decide on your communication
checkpoints and have a team member own that schedule.That means updating the
schedule as the project schedule changes and communicating some of those changes
to project stakeholders as well. If you feel like you’re over-communicating, that’s
probably good since most IT project managers under-communicate outside of their
immediate IT environment.An e-mail everyday is probably overkill but an e-mail
every week or two may be quite appropriate.Table 9.4 outlines one method of man-
aging communications; you may choose to use other methods suitable to your pro-
ject and organization.As with any task, if the task doesn’t have an owner, it probably
won’t get done, so make sure you ask for a volunteer or assign these tasks to

Cheat Sheet…
IT Project Communications 101
Still feeling a bit squeamish about project communications? One way of countering
this is to utilize internal communication resources. “Companies often have a person
or department that can assist with project communications,” explains Lisa Mainz,
Operations Manager for ShopNatural.com. “Look around to see who’s putting
together the corporate newsletter or who sends out corporate updates and press
releases. Someone in that department may be willing and able to help you with
project communications, especially a junior staffer who’s anxious to learn and grow
on the job. Utilizing existing corporate resources will reduce your workload and
might improve your project’s reputation in the process.”
Remember, there are different work styles and there really are people who
enjoy and are good at communicating. Find them, utilize them, and learn from
them. Learning to communicate more effectively might not be on the top of your
“To Do” list, but it is well worth the investment.
The deliverable from this part of your planning process is a more detailed com-
munications plan that includes communication milestones or checkpoints. Making
sure that communications are planned into the project helps you and the project
team communicate effectively and regularly with less effort.This document, depicted
in Figure 9.13, should be included in the project plan submitted to your project
sponsor for ﬁnal approval.

Finalizing the Project Plan
The time has come to ﬁnalize the project plan so work can begin.Though you’ve put
a lot of work into your project up to this point, the actual tasks of the project have yet
to begin.This is your last checkpoint before work on the project commences, so this is
the point at which you ﬁnalize your project plan and take it to your project sponsor
for approval. If you’ve been bringing recommended elements to your project sponsor
along the way, your ﬁnal project plan should be approved with few, if any, changes.
Keep in mind, though, that things change constantly. It’s possible that since your plan-
ning began, your company has a new strategic mission, a new customer, a new priority,
and a new problem, and your IT project’s priority fell from 2 to 200. It happens and
there’s not much you can do about it.Your project sponsor may be pleased with the
plan but not ready to begin project work for a variety of reasons.
Your project sponsor may also want minor or major changes made to the project
plan. If that’s the case, you need to go back through the necessary steps to make the
required changes. Remember, your job as IT project manager is to ensure the suc-
cessful completion of the project. If you believe your project sponsor is requesting
(or demanding) changes that put the project at risk, you need to say so. Sometimes
the project sponsor may think his or her idea is marvelous when in reality, it would
tank the project. While you need to be diplomatic in your delivery, it is very impor-
tant that you voice these concerns now, before the project work is ofﬁcially
underway. If your project sponsor insists on changes you think create serious risks to
the project, do the same type of risk assessment we discussed earlier in this chapter.
Assess the likelihood and impact of the risk, develop alternatives (including the costs
to the budget and schedule) and present this to your sponsor so he or she can make
an informed decision about the requested changes. Don’t just blindly agree to
changes—push back if you think you should.You were selected to be the IT project
manager because someone (usually the project sponsor) thought you were the right
person for the job—and that includes using your skills, knowledge, and expertise to
push back against ideas or changes that put your project at risk. Of course, some
project sponsors just don’t want to hear it, so push back to the degree necessary, but
also know when to back down.You should note exceptions, risks, and other con-
cerns about proposed changes then do your best to make them happen if that’s the
ﬁnal decision.
If you refer back to Figure 9.2 at the opening of this chapter, you’ll notice in
Step 5 that there is the option to terminate the project. While it might seem like a
big waste of time or a huge disappointment to cancel the project at this point, the
upside is that you will have spared your company the time, cost, and sometimes
embarrassment of embarking on a plan that shouldn’t have gone forward for any one
www.syngress.com
Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
387

of a number of reasons.You might also be freed up to work on an even better pro-
ject, especially if your planning efforts are recognized and appreciated.Though it
may not be likely the project will be cancelled at this point, you just never know
and if you’re mentally prepared for that possibility, you’ll handle it like a champ if it
does occur.
You should also take a moment to go back through your project plan and make
sure everything is set. Sometimes data is missing or some portion of the plan needs
to be revised or reviewed prior to ﬁnalizing.This is also a good time to get your
team together to ﬁnalize the project plan and to update or revise project procedures.
Many of the procedures you deﬁned at the outset may still be perfectly ﬁne for the
project, but you may have identiﬁed needs for changes to procedures or additional
project processes needed to bring this project to a successful conclusion. Review
processes and procedures in light of all the project detail you now have and make
any needed adjustments before ﬁnalizing the plan and proceeding.
Once you’ve completed your review, the project plan should go to the project
sponsor for approval. If modiﬁcations are necessary, make those changes and resubmit
your plan with changes. In a perfect world, the approved plan is the ﬁnal project
plan where no further modiﬁcations are made except to the schedule once work is
underway and perhaps to the budget.The project problem, mission, and solution
statements should be set.The project’s functional and technical requirements should
be clearly spelled out and set.The project’s quality plan, communication plan, and
operational transfer plan (if applicable) should be set.The risks should be identiﬁed,
alternatives should be created, and trigger points should be set.The project schedule
and budget should be set as baselines so variances from these plans can be measured
and managed.You should be ready to get started on your project’s tasks.The ﬁnal
result, then, is an approved project plan, depicted in Figure 9.14. We use the word
“ﬁnal” rather loosely—on one hand, you must set a baseline; on the other hand,
many elements will change. So, we’ll assume the “ﬁnal” project plan is what is used
to set the baseline and we’ll agree that changes of one kind or another will more
than likely occur.

APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
By ﬁnalizing your project plan and “etching it in stone,” you provide you
and your IT team with a great learning tool. All the work you’ve done up
to this point is a compilation of your collective expertise, skills, talent,
and knowledge. Clearly, the project plan is a living, breathing docu-
ment—but keeping an unchanged copy of the “ﬁnal, approved project
plan” as your project baseline can help you later when you’re looking at
ﬁnal project results. We’ll discuss project wrap-up later in this book, but
for now, keep in mind that a ﬁnal copy of this document should be
saved for later review. Once you ﬁnalize the project, you can compare
plan to actual and update your data so you know what worked and
what didn’t work. The process of comparing plan to actual will help you
improve your project management skills exponentially.

Summary
The project plan is your roadmap to success and in this chapter we stepped through
creating the needed details that will help guide your project once work begins.The
Work Breakdown Structure is one of the most key elements of any project plan
because it delineates, in a very detailed manner, the work that must be done to
accomplish the project’s objectives. Some might argue that if you were only going to
implement one project management process it would be the creation of the WBS
and task details.The WBS deﬁnes the scope of the project. If work is not in the
WBS, it’s not in the project.The various task details including task owner, entry/exit
criteria, and completion criteria round out the WBS and give you and your project
team a very clear picture of the work to be accomplished. Remember that quality is
managed, in part, through completion criteria (which may include quality metrics),
so keep your quality plan front and center as you create your WBS.
The network diagram is a great way to help your project take shape and form.
By using a network diagram, you can begin to chart out your critical path and iden-
tify potential scheduling problems. Most project management software programs will
generate a network diagram automatically once you’ve entered your tasks based on
your WBS.The network diagram is a useful way of sequencing your tasks as a pre-
cursor to creating your project schedule. Create your project schedule from your
ideal or best-case sequence, not the other way around. Using both duration and
ﬂoat, you can create a more detailed network diagram that helps you see where you
have opportunities to modify your sequence (or later, your schedule) to manage
constraints.
The schedule must take into account resource conﬂicts and constraints at several
levels, which is where having a project management software program can be quite
helpful.You and the IT project team will have to evaluate these various constraints
and make choices about how to sequence and schedule project tasks to meet the
project’s objectives, including deadlines and timelines. We introduced the concept of
reserves, which are added at top-level phases or tasks, not to each individual task. It is
important for a variety of reasons to add reserves rather than padding estimates,
whether they are time or cost estimates.The most important reason is so you and
your team have an accurate estimate, not a wild estimate based on everyone’s indi-
vidual padding methods.
The project budget is developed based on the cost of each task, which can be
generated based on historical results or on calculations.Again, we used the concept
of reserves to provide ﬂexibility in the budget while maintaining clarity about costs.
A cash ﬂow projection is often needed (or required) and can help you and your
company manage large project expenditures. Cost control measures should be put in

Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

place for a project of any size, but more attention should be given to this process if
the project is long, complex, expensive, or if cost is the least ﬂexible element of your
project.
Identifying and managing project risks is an important undertaking and one that
is often skipped in IT project management. Risks to the project as a whole or ele-
ments of the project (scope, time, cost, or quality) should be identiﬁed.These risks
should be sorted according to two criteria: likelihood of occurrence and impact to
the project. Using a weighted rating system may be helpful if there are numerous
risks to be evaluated.The risks with both the highest likelihood of occurrence and
the highest impact to the project should be evaluated. It’s a bit of a judgment call as
to where to draw the line, but that’s where you, your IT project team, and your sub-
ject matter experts come in. Once the list of risks is deﬁned, you and the team
should identify alternatives.Alternatives provide you a means to either avoid the risk
altogether or minimize it to an acceptable level. Sometimes alternatives that are
identiﬁed in this step are great ideas that improve the overall project. Once risks and
alternatives (also called mitigation strategies or contingency plans) are developed, you
should identify triggers that allow you and your team to know, in no uncertain
terms, when a risk has occurred and what steps should be taken.As the IT project
manager, you can then respond to these “emergencies” with preconceived plans.
Also as part of your project planning, you should add detail to your communica-
tions plans.You should have developed communications plans as part of your project
processes and procedures, but now that you have added project detail, you can
modify your plan as needed. Ensuring that project information is communicated
regularly and to the right people in the right way will help avoid rumors that tend
to crop up with no real information is available.
The ﬁnal project plan should be a comprehensive plan that includes all the work
and detail we’ve discussed up to this point in the book.You should review project
elements in light of the project detail created as a result of this planning phase.
Check that the requirements match the scope and the WBS. Check that your pro-
cesses and procedures are still adequate for the project.The ﬁnalized plan should be
brought to the project sponsor for ﬁnal approval prior to initiating project work.The
project sponsor may want to make changes at this point, but if you’ve regularly
brought portions of the project plan to the sponsor for review, discussion, and
approval, there should be few, if any, changes at this point. Keep in mind that one
possible outcome of this step is to have the project delayed, put on hold, or cancelled
altogether. While disappointing, this does happen and it’s better to have the project
cancelled before project work commences than afterward. Finally, keeping a ﬁnal
copy of the project plan saved in a secure location can be helpful for later review.
This establishes your baseline for the entire project and can be used to compare plan

to actual.The “active” ﬁnal project plan should be a living, breathing document that
is updated as approved changes occur.
Solutions Fast Track
Creating a Work Breakdown Structure
 The Work Breakdown Structure is created using the project’s major
deliverables or objectives.
 Project quality must be built into the project and you can implement
quality control through the WBS.
 Duration is the amount of time you’ll allow for a task, while effort is the
amount of actual work or time the task will take.
 Project tasks should follow the 8/80 rule.Any task or work package that is
less than 8 hours in duration should be rolled up into a higher level task
that will be more than 8 hours in duration.Any task or work package that
is longer than 80 hours should be broken down into smaller, more
manageable tasks.
 The tasks deﬁned in the WBS deﬁne the total work of the project;
therefore, the WBS deﬁnes the project scope.This is an opportunity to
compare your WBS to your project scope statement(s) to ensure they are
describing the same work.
 Completion criteria describe what a completed task looks like or is
comprised of.This is one way quality is managed in a project.
 Entry/exit criteria can be used to deﬁne when tasks or phases can begin
and end.This is another quality control method.
 Tasks should be placed in optimal sequence at this point. Resource
constraints and other limitations should not be introduced at this time.
 Numbering tasks using a numbered outline format (1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1, etc.)
can be helpful in tracking tasks.
 Review functional and technical requirements to make sure they are
addressed by your WBS.

Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

Creating a Network Diagram
 The network diagram is a visual depiction of the sequenced tasks in the
project.
 Duration is the amount of time the task is allotted for completion. Float is
the amount of ﬂexibility in the timeframe for completion of the task.These
can be used together to help sequence and schedule tasks.
 The network diagram will help you see the project’s critical path.
Identifying tasks on the critical path will help you make better decisions
about various project constraints.
Creating the Project Schedule
 The project schedule is developed only after you’ve created an optimal
sequence.
 The project schedule takes into account resource conﬂict, limitations, and
constraints.
 Project management software is very helpful in creating and managing the
project schedule.
 Schedule based on task duration, not effort.
 Identify needed resources for each task, then resolve sequence/schedule
conﬂicts based on resources constraints.
 The reserve is like a savings account. If a task takes longer than planned, the
extra time is subtracted from the reserve. If a task takes less time than
planned, the amount of unused time is added to the reserve.
 Add reserve amounts to high-level tasks, not to each individual task.The
reserve amount (days or percentages) should be clearly spelled out, not
embedded in other time estimates.
Creating the Project Budget
 The project budget is developed by adding the cost of each task.The cost
of each task can be developed using historical data or through calculation.
 A cash ﬂow estimate helps show when large project expenditures will be
needed so you, the team, and the company can plan accordingly.
www.syngress.com
Planning IT Projects • Chapter 9
393

 Cost control measures are important in any project to prevent costs from
spiraling out of control.The larger, more complex, or more expensive a
project is, the more important these controls become.
 If cost is your least ﬂexible project parameter, cost controls should be very
detailed to afford you the ability to closely manage project costs.
 Reserves for the budget are developed just as they are for time reserves in
the schedule.Additional amounts (dollar amounts or percentages) can be
added to high-level tasks.The reserve amounts should always be clearly
spelled out, not embedded in other costs.
Identifying Project Risks
 Every project has risks unique to that project. Spend time as a team to
identify these risks. Pay particular attention to risks that affect tasks on the
critical path.
 Risks should be sorted based on both the likelihood of occurrence and the
impact to the project.
 Decide as a team how far down your risk list you should plan.
 For each risk chosen, investigate ways to reduce or avoid the risk by
changing the project plan or the risk element.Typically, the best option is
to try to avoid the risk in the ﬁrst place.The second best option is to have
a contingency plan ready to go should the risk occur.
 For each risk, develop an alternate plan that you will implement if the risk
occurs.
 For each alternate plan, develop a trigger so you will know exactly when
the risk has occurred and exactly how (and when) you’ll put your alternate
plan into action.
 Review each alternative plan for potential new risks and plan accordingly.
Planning Project Communications
 IT project communications are vital to the perceived and actual success of
the project.
www.syngress.com
394
Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

 Ensure that you and your team have a solid communications plan and make
adjustments as necessary based on the detailed project planning you’ve
done.
 If you and your team are not good at communicating, look for resources
within your company that can assist you.
 Communicate regularly about the project, even if you don’t have deﬁnitive
information.
 Communicate with the appropriate frequency and method for the
audience.
 Assign an owner to communication tasks so you can be sure they get done.
Finalizing the Project Plan
 The ﬁnal project plan contains all the elements we’ve discussed to this
point in the book.
 The ﬁnal project plan should be brought to the project sponsor for
approval.
 If the project sponsor requests or requires signiﬁcant change, discuss this in
depth to ensure the sponsor understands the implications of change at this
point.
 Sometimes projects reach this stage and are delayed, put on indeﬁnite hold,
or cancelled altogether. While this is disappointing, it is better to cancel a
project in the planning stage than in the work stage.
 Keep a separate copy of the ﬁnal project plan for your archives.You can use
it later to compare plan to actual results.This will help you improve your
IT project management skills.
 An archived copy of the ﬁnal project plan may be useful for later use.
Reusing project processes, procedures, or part of the Work Breakdown
Structure can help you avoid “reinventing” the wheel.

Q: The information described in this chapter—in this entire book so far—is
very enlightening, but I know I’m never going to be able to implement this
level of planning in our organization. Should I just toss this book out?
A: First, no, don’t toss the book out—there’s a lot more good information to
come. Second, you don’t have to implement all of these processes at once.
Granted, that would be ideal—to start a fresh project and build it from the
ground up using these IT project management processes. But that’s just not
how the real world works. Most people approach change one small chunk at
a time. If you have ever tried to make any kind of change in your life, you
know that if you try to tackle too big a change, you’ll simply revert to your
old ways. Instead of giving up, ﬁnish reading through this book, then go back
and ﬁnd the one process or procedure you think will have the greatest
impact on your project’s success. Choose that one process or procedure and
use it for a while.Then, just begin to work your way through all these pro-
cesses until, slowly but surely, you have a full-blown IT project management
process implemented. If you can’t implement all of these steps at once, don’t
worry about it.Anything new that you do implement will help improve pro-
ject results. For instance, in the past, you probably created a detailed list of
work to be done (your version of a WBS). So, this time, have task owners
create completion criteria so everyone will know when a task is successfully
completed.That’s a fairly easy change to make and what you’ll probably dis-
cover is that your team latches on to these things because completion criteria
(for example) make team members’ jobs easier.Any time something makes
life easier, we tend to use it. So, look for processes you can add that will make
your IT project team’s job easier and you will probably ﬁnd very little resis-
tance. Finally, keep the word kaizen in mind—it means small, incremental,
continuous improvement.That’s what this is all about.

Frequently Asked Questions
The following Frequently Asked Questions, answered by the author of this book,

this chapter and to assist you with real-life implementation of these concepts. To

www.syngress.com/solutions and click on the “Ask the Author” form. 

Q: I’ve never used a network diagram before, but it looks interesting. How can I
create one if I don’t have a project management software program?
A: One method taught by a prestigious project management program suggests
using sticky notes (often referred to by the trade name “Post-Its”). If each
task is written on a note and the duration and ﬂoat are added, you can create
a network diagram on any surface to which sticky notes will stick. Some
people prefer index cards.A whiteboard can be helpful, but remember that
you probably don’t want to erase and re-draw over and over as you move
things around, so the white board can be useful either as a surface for the
sticky notes or as a place to record your ﬁnal version of the network diagram
before transferring it to paper or electronic format.A whiteboard (or blank
wall) can be very helpful in looking at the network diagram as a whole.
Some people who are visually-oriented may spot problems with the diagram
immediately. Others may ﬁnd the sequencing tasks easier if they are more
tangible (using paper rather than the computer).There are plenty of ways to
create the sequence (and thus, the schedule) without using project manage-
ment software; get creative.You will ﬁnd, however, that once you have your
sequence and schedule that you may want to ﬁnd a PM software tool to
manage the schedule unless you have a fairly small project.
Q: I’ve used Microsoft Project in the past but with mixed results.Any suggestions?
A: Yes, two comments. First, having Microsoft Project doesn’t make you a good
project manager any more than having Adobe Photoshop makes you a
graphic artist. Project and Photoshop are tools to help those who already
have some level of expertise. So, your experience with Microsoft Project may
be the result of not having the project management skills needed to effec-
tively use the tool. Second, Microsoft Project is one of many different project
management tools available. Each tool has some wonderful, unique features
and some inherent limitations.You may need to look around at your choices
to determine which tool is most appropriate for your project, your team, and
your budget.You can install enterprise or desktop applications or you can use
Web-based applications, all depending on your needs. Now that you’ve
learned more about IT project management, you may want to go back and
give Microsoft Project another try (it sounds as though you already own it so
you might as well try using it again).You might be surprised by how differ-
ently you approach the tool now that you have new skills under your belt.

Q: Our company’s Finance department creates our project budgets for us, so I’m
not inclined to want to create a budget or a cash ﬂow projection. Is there any
reason I should?
A: If you’re comfortable with the way in which your IT project budgets are cre-
ated and that works for you, feel free to leave well enough alone. On the
other hand, if you ever go to work for another company, having experience
creating and managing IT project budgets might be helpful or required. It’s
up to you whether or not you want to take on creating your budget, but you
might want to get your feet wet so you gain experience in this area. If you’re
held accountable for a budget you don’t create, that can cause some strange
problems, so that’s another reason you might want to get involved.
Q: It seems you could plan for risks of risks of risks. What’s a reasonable point at
which to draw the line?
A: You’re right that you could probably spend the rest of your life trying to plan
for and avoid risk, but you’d never get anything done. It would be like saying,
“There are risks involved with travel”—that statement is true, but some travel
is more dangerous than others. Flying in a poorly maintained single engine
aircraft is far riskier than ﬂying on a commercial airliner. Riding a motor-
cycle without a helmet at top speeds in trafﬁc is riskier than driving in a
mid-sized sedan. Everything we do has risk, the question is how much risk
are you willing to accept? Companies typically have different “risk personali-
ties”, meaning that some companies are willing to accept more risk than
others.The same holds true with IT project managers. Some IT PMs love the
adrenaline rush of running around trying to solve some big problem; others
avoid those kinds of situations. So, there is no single, right answer, but you
should look at your own tolerance for risk (as well as your company’s) and
plan accordingly.Avoid analysis paralysis and do draw the line on risk plan-
ning at a reasonable point. If you feel that you’re beginning to spin your
wheels, ﬁnd someone on your project team (or in close proximity) that has
some of that doer personality. He or she will help you cut to the chase and
get moving.
Q: I usually work with the same project sponsor and she never wants to review
any part of the project plan until I submit the ﬁnal project plan for approval.
However, she always wants major changes at that point. How can I manage
this?
www.syngress.com

Chapter 9 • Planning IT Projects

A: That is a tough situation because you seem to lose on both ends. One sug-
gestion is that you might bring less detail to your project sponsor more fre-
quently. It’s possible you are providing so much detail each time that she
doesn’t have time to review it, so she’s created a process to limit the amount
of detail she has to manage.The higher up one is in an organization, the
more this is likely to be true. Rather than assume your project sponsor
doesn’t want information before the ﬁnal project plan, try providing far less
detail.Think of providing sound bites for your project sponsor throughout
the deﬁning, organizing, and planning phases.That way, you can keep her up
to date without inundating her with details. Many successful IT project man-
agers ﬁnd a balance between getting things done and working on detail work
(the doer versus the analyzer) and you may need to modify your communica-
tion style a bit to work more effectively with your project sponsor. In addi-
tion, you may want to take a look at past projects and see if there is a pattern
to the types of changes required by your project sponsor. Does she always
want a change in scope, time, cost, or quality? What are the reasons for past
changes? It’s possible that she consistently wants projects that have tighter
timeframes or higher quality. If you can see where the disconnect is by
looking at past projects, you may be able to come in more closely aligned on
this and future projects. Finally, if you use the methods discussed in this book,
it’s possible that your project sponsor will not have as many changes. For
instance, it will be very quick and easy to get her to sign off on the project
problem statement. Once you agree to the problem, you can agree to the
mission. Once you agree on the mission, you can agree on the selected solu-
tion, and so forth.These small checkpoints throughout the project planning
process are designed to gain agreement and maintain alignment so changes
don’t come at the end of the planning phase.

Introduction
If you’ve followed all the steps leading up to this chapter, congratulations! Your IT pro-
ject should be sitting on very solid ground.Your planning activities will help everyone
stay focused during the project work phase and will help make sure the scope, time,
cost, and quality requirements are met. In this chapter, we’re going to discuss strategies
for managing your IT project.We’ll talk about getting the project started and how to
monitor and control project progress.We will cover more detailed, technical tracking
techniques separately in Chapter 11 along with common project problems and solu-
tions.Where appropriate, we’ll mention some of the detailed tracking techniques in
this chapter and refer you to Chapter 11 for more detail.
Managing your IT project is much easier when you have a clear vision of the pro-
ject, developed from your efforts at deﬁning, organizing, and planning your project. In
this chapter, we’ll look at how to supervise the project elements, including monitoring
project progress, managing change and risk, and managing your project team.
As with previous chapters, we’ll begin by taking a look at where we are in the
process, shown in Figure 10.1. It is clear that up until now, no actual project work has
been done (yes, planning is work, but not the actual work of the project).Though
there are a lot of planning activities, they all contribute to your ability to manage
your project during this implementation and work phase.As your project moves for-
ward, you’ll begin to recognize and reap the rewards of your planning efforts.

We’ve already deﬁned most of the project management terminology that we’ll
be using, but a few new terms will be introduced in this chapter including:
■
Baseline  The starting point or basis against which progress or change is
measured.
■
Deliverable A measurable, veriﬁable work product, result, or capability.
■
Project phase A phase is generally characterized by the delivery and
approval of one or more project deliverables.
■
Variance The amount or percentage a result differs from the plan or

The input to this stage of the project is your ﬁnal, approved project plan and the
outcome of this stage is the completed project.The actions within this stage are
shown in Figure 10.2.
Figure 10.2 Inputs, Actions, and Outputs for Project Management Step
1.
INPUT  The input to this step in the IT project management process is
your ﬁnal, approved project plan.This plan should include, at minimum, the
problem, mission, solution, scope, functional and technical requirements,
schedule, budget, Work Breakdown Structure, task details, project processes,
and procedures. Sub-plans such as training, communications, testing, and
operational transfer plans should also be included as needed.This is the plan
from which you’ll create your baseline and against which you’ll measure
progress.
2.
ACTION The process of actually managing the project work-in-progress
is the phase we’ll be discussing in detail in this chapter. It is during this
phase that the plans are used so that work progresses according to plan.
During this phase you must also work to ensure that your scope does not
expand (scope creep), a common problem in this phase. Changes that occur
to schedule, budget, or scope must be managed so ﬁnal deliverables meet
www.syngress.com
404
Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

scope, time, cost, and quality metrics as well as functional and technical
requirements.Technical project tracking processes are discussed in detail in
Chapter 11.
3.
CHECKPOINT  The ﬁrst checkpoint is the project progress review by
the project sponsor.This review will happen multiple times during this
phase and each review should result in the project sponsor approving results
of the work in progress, requiring changes to the project (which ﬂows back
into the project management process and/or may require changes in the
project plan), or a decision to terminate the project.Terminating the project
at this point would be a very serious decision, but there are times that pro-
jects are cancelled at this stage. Cancellation at this point might be due to
changes in the company, the market, or the product, or due to dissatisfac-
tion with project results to date (above budget, behind schedule, under
quality, below scope). In some projects, these checkpoints might also be
used with clients or users to ensure the project is progressing as expected.
You can modify this process to include client or user approval, if needed.
4.
OUTPUT Assuming the project progresses as planned and the project
sponsor approves project progress, the output is the ﬁnal project deliver-
ables.These may be delivered in stages or phases or they may be delivered
all at once, depending on your IT project.
5.
DECISION POINT  Once the project’s ﬁnal deliverables are complete,
the project work is complete.The project’s deliverables should be brought
to the client/user for approval if this is part of your project plan (some pro-
jects will not have a discrete user acceptance process). If the client approves
the deliverables, this is typically the point at which client billing for ﬁnal
project deliverables occurs and operational transfer plans are put into effect.
If the deliverables are not accepted at this point, you will most likely have
to go back to your project plan to determine where you went wrong and
make modiﬁcations.You’ll most likely need to go through the planning and
managing steps again for at least part of your project. If you have worked
with your clients/users as suggested throughout this book, there is a much
higher chance the client will accept deliverables without problems. If the
client does not accept deliverables, it should raise a ﬂag in your organization
and within your team because it indicates there was a communication
problem at some point in the project planning stages.You should look
closely as where and why the disconnect occurred.This is a serious
problem that should be analyzed fully.
www.syngress.com
Managing IT Projects • Chapter 10
405

6.
NEXT STEP If the client accepts project deliverables, your next step is
to close out the project. Closing out the project is discussed in Chapter 12.
The project management or implementation phase of our process includes
reviewing the plan, starting project work, and managing, monitoring, and measuring
project work, as shown in Figure 10.3. If any work varies from the plan, corrective
action must be taken and work (new work due to correction or repair of earlier
work) must be undertaken.The ﬁnal project work includes delivering the project
results to the end user or customer for approval and acceptance. Once project deliv-
erables are accepted, responsibility is typically transferred to the user/customer or to
another group responsible for installation or deployment, beta testing, or operations.
Periodic reporting occurs during the Work, Monitor, and Correct steps shown in
Figure 10.3, but ﬁnal reporting is also required. Reporting includes status and
progress reports from your team to you as well as progress reports from you to your
project sponsor, user/client representative(s), executive team, and/or company.The
diagram shown in Figure 10.3 can represent the entire implementation (work) cycle
of a project or the implementation of one phase of a project.These steps are iterative
and continue until all project work is completed, approved, and accepted. We’ll dis-
cuss these elements in this chapter.

Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

Initiating Project Work
Your project plan has been approved, your project team is in place and you’ve gotten
the ofﬁcial “ok” to proceed. Getting project work going and monitoring its progress
is your next step.The purpose of all the planning you’ve done is to be able to con-
trol your project once work gets underway. Control is the process of comparing
where you are to where you were supposed to be so you can make corrections as
you go. It’s like driving a car. If you’re in control of the car (driver), you use the
accelerator, brake pedal, and steering wheel to make small corrections as you go so
that you stay in your lane heading in the direction you decided to go.You speed up,
slow down, or stop as needed to stay in the ﬂow of trafﬁc, to avoid hazards, and to
arrive safely at your destination.You may occasionally alter your original course
because of road construction or a major delay en route. Maintaining control of your
project is a similar process that will require you to speed up, slow down, swerve or
stop from time to time in order to drive your project to successful completion.
Start of Work Announcement
Though you may have already held a project kick-off meeting to get your project
team together and aligned, you should hold a meeting to mark the start of project
work with your team.You should review project processes and procedures, clarify
next steps, and review ﬁrst deliverables and milestones with the team. In addition,
you should send out an announcement to your company or department that project
work has commenced.This is a key communication that helps everyone know you
are moving out of the planning stage and into the work stage (which counteracts
those who complain that “all we ever do is plan, we never get anything done”) and
also lets people know that the resources they committed to this project will now be
called upon. If your project relies on outside resources including equipment, ven-
dors, or contractors, be sure to let them know the project has commenced. In some
cases, you’ll need to re-verify time estimates, bids, quotes, or lead times to ensure the
numbers you’re working with are still accurate.
This is a good time for team members to verify their own next steps and to
ensure the resources they need for their ﬁrst tasks are lined up and ready to go.
Remind team members of when ﬁrst status reports are due, review procedures for
change and issue management, and ensure everyone knows how to update the status
of their tasks (both schedule and budget) based on the project management system
you’re using (Microsoft Project, a Web-based PM tool, tasks in Microsoft Outlook,
e-mail, etc.).

Managing IT Projects • Chapter 10

Implementation of Project Plan
The project should get off to a smooth start if your project plan is sound. Work
should commence on initial tasks as scheduled.Your job as IT project manager, at
this point, is to monitor and manage all the moving parts.You should check on pro-
ject progress regularly.Your status reporting intervals should be frequent enough that
big problems won’t sneak up on you, but not so frequent as to drive your team
crazy.You may need to adjust your status reporting interval once project work is
underway to accommodate the actual needs of the team and the project.All work
should proceed according to the project plan and it’s important to make sure this
happens right from the beginning. Starting out on the right foot helps the team
learn and apply the project procedures and helps you verify that everyone is using
those procedures. If you or your project team develops bad habits at the outset, your
project is at greater risk.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Remember that project success is deﬁned as much by the perception of
those involved in the project as it is by the deliverables. Take this oppor-
tunity to promote your project as you begin work. For instance, you
might send an e-mail blast to the company or set up a presentation for
the executive team. Let everyone know how well the planning stage
went, how the plans will set the project up for success, and when you’ll
have updates for them. Setting the stage for project success starts early
and now’s a great time to initiate your communication plan as well.
Monitoring Project Progress
There are numerous ways you can monitor project progress.There are also some more
technical methods for tracking project status. In this chapter, we’ll stick to the less
technical methods and if you’re interested in more rigorous tracking methods, you’ll
ﬁnd them (along with common project problems and solutions) in Chapter 11.
As you monitor your project, you have to ask four essential questions:
1.
What is the actual status of the project work?
2.
What is the difference (or variance) between plan and actual, and what
caused it?
www.syngress.com

Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

3.
What should be done to keep the project on track?
4.
What have we learned that we can use moving forward?
In this section, we’ll ﬁrst talk about how to gather project status data.Then we’ll
talk about variance to the project. Finally in this section, we’ll discuss the steps you
can take to deal with the variance.
Cheat Sheet…
Gathering Lessons Learned
Ideally, you should have a section in your task data called “Lessons Learned” so
that lessons learned can be captured by task owners (or those working on tasks)
as work progresses. Capturing these lessons in the task is ideal because that
information can be captured immediately while memories are fresh. Those
thoughts and ideas tend to fade over time the further we get from the task that
sparked the learning or insight. Capturing lessons learned for the project can be
a simple matter of having task owners or team members collect lessons learned
for completed tasks on a periodic basis and reporting them or capturing them in
a central document. Recording this data in real time, or at least while project
work is in progress, helps you and the team learn quickly. A lesson learned in one
area might save time or money on an upcoming task in another area. Sharing this
information during team meetings can be a great way to learn as a group and
make subsequent tasks or projects more successful. These lessons learned should
also be captured at the project close-out, which we’ll discuss in Chapter 12. Don’t
wait until your project is complete to gather this data, however, because your
current project work may well beneﬁt from someone else’s lesson learned.
Reporting Project Progress
Reporting project status is one of the processes you should have delineated back
when you were deﬁning project processes. Status can be communicated in a variety
of ways. In the next section, we’ll discuss exactly how to measure progress, but for
now, let’s focus on the methods of communicating progress.
Team Meetings
One of the processes we discussed earlier in the book was gathering project status
updates from the team. One method that most IT project managers use is the

project team meeting.Team meetings not only help people stay focused on the pro-
ject, they help build that sense of teamwork that can be crucial to project success.
Well-run team meetings also give people the opportunity to stay up to date on the
overall project progress and gather information that may be helpful in accomplishing
their work. Sharing best practices or lessons learned beneﬁts the whole team and can
help others avoid similar problems. In addition, team meetings are a good place to
discuss project status because changes to one task or work package can impact many
other tasks down the line. Having everyone in the same room (or tied in by video or
phone) to discuss status and changes can help resolve issues before they get out of
hand.Team meetings are also where problems should be raised, discussed, and
resolved. Having this regular forum for project work helps prevent side conversations
and agreements from occurring. It’s not uncommon to have one or more members
of the team approached by a member of the user community to request a “small
change” to the project.These are very dangerous to a project plan and should be
avoided. By holding regular team meetings and encouraging team members to dis-
cuss these kinds of requests and issues, you can keep everything aboveboard, manage
these requests through your standard project processes and hopefully avoid (or
manage) scope creep.
Status and Progress Reports
You may ask for status or progress reports during team meetings or you may want
those sent to you via e-mail prior to the meeting. Whatever method you’ve devel-
oped for gathering project status and progress, make sure you use it consistently. One
common occurrence is that project status reports are consistently required at the
outset of the project, but as time wears on, everyone gradually gets a bit lax in their
reporting and before you know it, you have no current project data. Current data is
the only way you can control the progress of the project, so it’s the key to project
success at this point.
The best way for people to report on status and progress is to record their activi-
ties in real time. Studies consistently show that the longer the interval from work to
recording, the more inaccurate the recording is. Encourage team members (task
owners as well as those doing task work) to record their work as they’re doing it.
Their data will be much more accurate and it will give you a better view into the
status of the project. If people wait until the end of a work week to record details
about their project work, there is a very strong likelihood that the data will be
skewed one way or another. If you’ve ever waited a month to ﬁll out an expense
report from a trip you took, you know how difﬁcult it can be to re-create the data.
You have to go back through your e-mail, calendar and receipt ﬁles. It takes very
www.syngress.com
410
Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

little time to record activities in real time and it provides the most meaningful data.
Encourage team members to be truthful in their reporting as well.The tendency is
to minimize problems so we don’t have to deal with them, but eventually the
problem ﬂares up and it’s far more difﬁcult to deal with it once it doubles or triples
in size. Consistently look for bad news—the good news will jump out at you with
little effort.That doesn’t mean taking a pessimistic attitude toward the project; it
means that if you don’t look for the bad news, you might not see it until it’s too late.
If you and your team have a good attitude toward bad news, you might devote a
portion of your team meetings to “the bad news you’d rather not tell us” where each
team member is asked to divulge something about their section of the project they
might not otherwise share.

Microsoft Outlook Journal
One useful tool that is available to many people is Microsoft Outlook Journal. The
journal function allows you to create a new journal entry and record the task
name, task type, start time, duration, and notes. If someone creates a new
journal entry at the start of a task and starts the timer, the timers will continue
to record work time until the timer is paused or the journal entry is saved and
closed. Those journal entries can be e-mailed to the IT project manager or simply
used as a way to capture work data for later compilation into a progress report.
It’s a great way to record work effort in real time with very little effort.
Issues Logs
Part of reporting status and progress is creating and managing an issues log.There are
many different approaches to issues logs, but they essentially all have the same func-
tion—to track problems that arise. Each issue should have a brief name and descrip-
tion, a category (the part of the project in which the problem was found), an owner
(who will take action to resolve the issue), an origination date (when it’s entered in
the issues log), a recommendation date (the date a recommendation is due), a resolu-
tion date (the date resolution is due), and a completion or close-out date (when the
issue was considered resolved). If it’s helpful, you can create an issue numbering
system so issues can be grouped or referred to by number since unique issue names
may become cumbersome. Remember, too, that there may be some issues that
www.syngress.com
Managing IT Projects • Chapter 10
411

require no action.These should be noted and closed as resolved with comments as to
why no action was recommended or taken. While this might seem obvious, it’s easy
to get in the mind set that each issue requires some change.Though that’s often the
case, the option of doing nothing should be considered. Some issues actually do
resolve themselves. Some people ﬁnd it helpful to use a spreadsheet to track issues.
Some companies have speciﬁc software designed for issue tracking (in software
development, there are usually issues logs and bug or defect logs). Whatever system
you implement, make sure it’s easy for team members to add issues (if you want
them updating the log) and make sure it’s easy to ﬁnd, sort, and analyze issues as well
as to quickly and easily determine the status of issues (open, closed, pending, at risk,
critical, etc.).
Bugs or software defects can be considered issues, but more often they are
tracked separately in a bug tracking system.An issue might be that the code speciﬁed
for Part 4 doesn’t interface with one of the legacy systems.A bug might be that the
code written for Part 4 doesn’t work as speciﬁed. Essentially, an issue in software
development is typically related to functional or technical speciﬁcations whereas a
bug is a problem with code written to a speciﬁcation. Bugs or defects should be
tracked in a similar manner as issues, but they generally go through a different reso-
lution cycle. Bugs or defects typically are sent back through the work cycle for repair
either during current work or as a separate work cycle.You can download a bug
tracking template if you don’t already have one.
There are three common problems with issues logs worth discussing: no owners of
issues, no follow up, and lengthy or repeated issues discussions. Let’s look at of these prob-
lems brieﬂy.
No Owners of Issues
Just as a task without an owner will not get done, an issue without an owner will
not be resolved. Issues should be assigned owners so that they can be researched and
resolved.As the IT project manager, you are the default owner of all tasks. It’s safe to
assume you don’t want to do all the project work single-handedly, so check to make
sure all tasks have appropriate owners.The owner should be responsible for
researching the issue and making recommendations for solutions. Depending on the
type of issue, the owner may recommend the solution or bring the problem to the
team for discussion. Once recommendations are made, the owner (or team) should
make a decision on a course of action and implement that action.
www.syngress.com
412
Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

No Follow-Up
If no one is checking the issues log on a regular basis (that’s typically the job of the
IT project manager), then it’s likely people will stop updating the issues log. Worse,
they may stop taking action on issues and that puts your project at risk. Part of each
team meeting should be a review of the open issues and updates relevant to the
issues log. Don’t spend a lot of time on this.A quick update should sufﬁce such as,
“Hey, Phoebe, what’s the status of Issue 123? Do you think you’ll have a resolution
by Thursday?” Make sure you touch upon each open issue so that owners are held
accountable for closing issues in a timely and reasonable manner. Otherwise, as your
attention to the issues log wanes so too will theirs.
Lengthy or Repeated Issues Discussions
We all know how painfully boring it can be to sit through a lengthy discussion that
does not involve us. It’s why some people start ducking out of meetings or not
showing up in the ﬁrst place. If an issue requires lengthy discussion by the entire
team, it should be on the agenda as a separate agenda item whenever possible. If an
issue prompts discussion, it might be worthwhile to discuss it as a team, but if the
issue does not impact a majority of the team, don’t make everyone sit through an
irrelevant discussion.Table it and have the interested parties discuss it outside of the
regular meeting time.
Going through the issues log should not be a long, arduous, and painful process,
though in some companies that’s exactly what it is. Make sure the issues log is used
as a tool and that you use it as intended. If your issues log is long (in some large pro-
jects, the issues log can become very lengthy), you may have a separate issues log
meeting. In some cases, you may break it down further and have issues log meetings
for subsets of the project team to avoid discussing endless detail on a topic a
majority of the team does not need to know or hear.
Also, avoid rehashing the same issues over and over. Determine a course of
action, request updates, and move on. If an issue keeps coming back up, it’s impor-
tant that you, as the IT project manager, take a look at this and ﬁgure out why you
keep discussing it over and over.This problem often occurs if notes are not kept that
capture the discussion and decision points. It’s important that you develop a course
of action and resolution for issues because rehashing those issues repeatedly is a waste
of time and will de-motivate the team quickly (not to mention the risk it injects
into the project).

Managing Escalations
Sometimes problems occur in projects that require the assistance, input, or decision
of someone higher in the organization.Your escalation procedures should be well
established before work commences so that task owners and team members know
how and when to escalate issues.Your issues log is certainly the starting place for
raising, tracking, and managing issues, but sometimes these issues require additional
input for resolution. Make sure the criteria and process for escalating issues is clear to
all team members. On one hand, you don’t want to “cry wolf” and escalate every
little issue you and the team run into. On the other hand, executives hate surprises
so it’s important to understand how, when, and why you should escalate issues.This
is one part project management, one part change management, and one part risk
management. Issues that are difﬁcult or impossible to resolve that impact the project’s
overall scope, critical path, or functional deliverables should certainly rank high on
your list of potential escalation candidates.The criteria you and the IT project team
establish should have been reviewed and cleared with the project sponsor so you
know exactly which issues should be brought to a higher level in the organization.
Using team meetings, status and progress reports, and issues logs, you have three
fundamental tools at your disposal to know what is going on in your project.You’re
probably familiar with the data processing saying “Garbage in, garbage out.”Your
project data is only as good as the data people put into it. Current, accurate data will
help you recognize problems quickly and take appropriate corrective action.You can
download an issues log template from the Syngress website if you don’t already have
a format you prefer.
Risks and Contingency Plans
We’ll discuss managing risks and contingency plans in more detail later in this
chapter, but during the course of your project work, you should keep your risk
management plan handy and make sure you’re aware of your risks and trigger points.
Ideally, you should have placed milestones in your project plan to remind you of
potential or upcoming risks and trigger points. For example, if you know that only
Joaquin can write a particular section of code, you should have a checkpoint prior to
that work package to check that Joaquin is available for this task at the scheduled
time. It wouldn’t be helpful to ﬁnd out the day before work on that task is to begin
that Joaquin just took off for a month in Mali. Make sure you review your risk man-
agement plan and keep an eye on your trigger points. Build them into your schedule
if you haven’t already so that risks and associated triggers are kept in the forefront.
Remember, too, that implementing “Plan B” is a change to your project and
must be addressed through your change management procedures. During the risk
www.syngress.com
414
Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

management planning phase, you should have identiﬁed the major areas that might
be impacted by your “Plan B,” but once work commences, the picture may change.
Make sure you look ahead and think about how potential contingency plans might
impact the project at this point and going forward. While you won’t have time (nor
would it be advisable) to plan this way for every single risk, you usually get a sense
for which risks are most likely to occur and which require additional thought.
Determining Project Progress
To manage your project, you must know where you wanted to be (that’s deﬁned in
your project plan) and where you are (current project status).The current project
status is something that people sometimes think means progress against budget (if cost
is the least ﬂexible element) or progress against schedule (if time is the least ﬂexible
element). However, if you measure a project’s progress against just one parameter,
you have a very lopsided picture of the project. Let’s look at an example.
Suppose Patty was assigned a task to write a particular section of code for a new
application.The schedule estimates that it’s 10,000 lines of code and that it should
take her fourteen work days to accomplish this. For the sake of this example, let’s
assume Patty makes $25/hour.At the halfway mark, on day seven, Patty has 7,000
lines of code complete. What is the status of the task and how does that impact the
project? You could say that since she’s seven days into the task that she must be 50%
complete (schedule). However, she has 7,000 lines of code written, you could also
say that she is 70% complete (lines of code or deliverable).
What if we also included the fact that Patty has spent 84 hours on the task
because she worked 12-hour days instead of 8-hour days (7 days x 12 hrs. = 84 hrs.,
14 day x 8 hrs. = 112 hrs.)? You might say, well, she’s expended 75% of the hours
needed, so she must be 75% complete.You might also say that if she’s 75% complete
at the half way point that she must be ahead of schedule. Which, among all these
statements, is actually correct?
Let’s look at the cost factor.The total cost of this task was estimated to be the
cost of Patty’s wages—$25/hr x 112 hours or $2,800. Patty has completed seven days
of work, but she incurred overtime on all seven days.The current tab is (($25 x 8) x
7 ) + (($37.50 x 4) x 7) or $2450.That’s about 87.5% of the total budgeted cost. If
she is on salary, the cost of an 8-hour day and a 12-hour day would be the same and
she’d have expended 50% of the task budget (remember, we’re talking about cost
here, not effort). Clear as mud, isn’t it?
Let’s recap: Patty is 50% complete, 70% complete, 75% complete or 87.5% com-
plete, right? Patty is on time, ahead of schedule, or behind schedule.That’s not very
helpful, it is? What if we also said that Patty ran into a huge problem and that
www.syngress.com
Managing IT Projects • Chapter 10
415

although 7,000 lines of code are ﬁnished, she now estimates that it will take 25,000
lines of code to complete this task? Suppose working all that overtime to get this
task completed caused Patty to make several key errors in the code and the
remaining work might take twice as long? Suppose Patty is a genius (which we all
suspected anyway) and she actually found a better way to write the code and it’s
complete at 7,000 lines of code? What is the status of the task now?
As you can see, there are a number of variables to consider.There are always
these kinds of variables and it’s impossible to know absolutely everything. Some task
progress will be much more tangible and easy to assess. In other tasks, like Patty’s,
tracking progress can be a bit more elusive.You can see by this example that by
tracking more than just one element (more than just time or just cost), you can at
least get a much better idea of the actual progress. Getting Patty’s perspective on her
progress and remaining work can be very helpful and can be an important part of
understanding progress, especially in knowledge work.
Project Progress and Knowledge Work
Knowledge work (the work done in many IT projects) is quite different from other
kinds of work. In fact, work in knowledge areas (such as programming) does not
progress along a linear path. Its path looks more like the trajectory shown in Figure
10.4.Thus, progress may appear to be slow or lagging in the early stages of work and
the work gets completed quickly at the end. Knowledge work often follows the
80/20 rule—80 % of the work is accomplished during the last 20%of the project.
Stated in reverse, it typically takes 80% of the task time to accomplish the ﬁrst 20%
of the work.This is partially attributable to the learning curve associated with most
knowledge work.

Figure 10.4 Progress Curve for Knowledge-Based Tasks or Work
As you can see, there can be a lot of difﬁculty determining project status for just
this one task.The challenge, of course, is to ﬁgure out how to accurately determine
the task and project status in a relatively fast and simple manner. If you don’t take
scope, time, cost, and quality into account, you won’t have a clear picture at all, so
let’s look at some methods you can use to account for these different measurements.
There are several methods used to track project progress that give a clearer view
of things. We’re going to discuss the basic ways to do so and we’ll discuss some of
the more advanced methods including Earned Value Analysis, Cost Performance, and
Schedule Performance (among others) in Chapter 11.The methods in this chapter
(Chapter 10) are suitable for many IT projects, but some projects (or some compa-
nies) require the more rigorous tracking methods discussed in the next chapter.
Percent Complete
Percent complete is probably the easiest method for assessing project progress and it’s
one many people use. If you’re going to use percent complete, you should track both
percent of budget expended and percent of schedule expended. When possible, it is
ideal to also track percent complete of the deliverable work itself, though this is not
always feasible. If you track against both cost and time, you will instantly have a
better picture of what’s going on than if you just tracked cost or time. Since percent
www.syngress.com
Managing IT Projects • Chapter 10
417

complete is often a judgment call, it’s not always an accurate measure, but it’s often
the best (or only) measure we have.
If we use our earlier example of Patty’s code development task, we can say that
she is 70% complete because she has 7,000 of 10,000 lines of code complete (deliver-
able). We can also say that she is 75% complete because she has expended 75% of the
hours (effort) allotted for this task. Since she’s completed 70% of the code and
expended 75% of the time, we might actually conclude that she’s running a bit
behind because we would expect to see 75% of the work completed once 75% of
the effort had been expended.Are we in trouble on this task? It’s difﬁcult to know
since Patty might have ﬁgured out a way to do this task with 7,500 lines of code, she
might run into a problem that causes her to be delayed in completing the ﬁnal lines
of code, or she might have to spend signiﬁcantly more hours to complete the code
(according to scope and requirements) on time. We also know that for knowledge
work, it can take longer to complete the early stages of the task so Patty might make
up the time on the back end and come in ahead of schedule.Again, Patty’s the sub-
ject matter expert in this case, so her perspective about the task’s progress should also
be taken into account.
In this case, effort and duration are quite relevant, so we might choose to focus on
Patty’s hours compared to duration. For instance, she has expended 75% of the esti-
mated hours (effort) in 50% of the duration (schedule), so we might conclude she is
ahead of schedule. If she had expended only 25% of the hours at the 50% mark in
duration, we could reasonably conclude Patty was behind schedule.
Remember that the original time and cost estimates were developed based on
subject matter experts’ opinions (possibly Patty’s own estimates for this task) or on
historical data. However, they were still estimates. So, the estimate of what it would
take to complete the task is really an educated guess and the estimate of where the
task or project is now is also a bit of an educated guess.You could spend hours and
hours of time trying to nail this down more exactly, but in many cases these edu-
cated guesses are as good as it gets (well, from a cost/beneﬁt perspective, they are as
good as it gets). So, percent complete isn’t perfect, but it does give you some idea of
what’s going on, especially if you use percent complete for schedule and budget and
include percent complete of deliverables when possible.

Cheat Sheet…
Where Are We?
As your project data is updated and you begin to gather information, make sure
you actually look at it and analyze it. If you have someone on the team that is an
analyzer type, this might be a good task to delegate, especially if data analysis is
not your strong suit. The key is to look at the data with an impartial eye.
Sometimes it’s a matter of “the glass is half empty” versus “the glass is half full,”
but many times you can learn important information about your project status
by taking some time to analyze the data. Using the example of Patty’s code
writing, should we be concerned that she’s expended 75% of the allotted time
and delivered only 70% of the code? Past experience will probably give you the
answer, but this is something worth noting. The fact that she’s at the 7-day mark
(50% of allotted duration) is an important additional element, isn’t it? Looking at
the data in terms of actual versus schedule for time, cost, and deliverables is cru-
cial. As you can see from this example, looking at only one metric will give you a
very skewed view of your project.
Variance
Measuring variance is another commonly used method to measure project (or task)
progress. Variance is typically represented as a percentage over or under plan. By def-
inition, variance is the amount a result differs from the plan or baseline expressed as a
positive or negative number (or percentage).A positive variance means the actual is
better than the plan; a negative variance means the actual is worse than the plan.
Variance can be an extension of the percent complete method because variance can
use actual numbers or percentage of completion for measurement. First, let’s recap
the data for this task, shown in Table 10.1.

For instance, we could say that Patty has expended 84 hours at the halfway
mark, so she is 28 hours over the effort estimate, a -28 hour variance (plan minus
actual or 56—84). We could also use percentages and say that she has expended 75%
of the hours at the 50% mark and therefore has a -25% variance (50% - 75%) on
estimated hours. Without knowing how much work she’s accomplished, though, her
actual hours don’t tell us the whole story.
Some IT project managers like to manage using variance because they can focus
on the things with the greatest variance. One method is to calculate variance and
assign a risk category to that variance.Any task falling into a medium to high risk vari-
ance category gets extra attention.An example of this type of categorization is shown
in Table 10.2.You can modify this to suit your needs, but the point is that anything
with a large or signiﬁcant variance from plan should be investigated immediately—that
includes things that are reported as signiﬁcantly under budget or under schedule. For
example, tasks that have a variance of 51% or more may require work on the task or
project to halt until the problem(s) can be resolved.Anything that has a signiﬁcant
variance should be investigated because it can mean only one of two things: your esti-
mate was wrong or your task/project is at serious risk. If you’re have a large variance
under estimates you shouldn’t assume things are going extraordinarily well (though you
should be open to that possibility). Rather, you should wonder if the scope or quality
is being met, if someone skipped a step or forgot a key work package component, or if
someone is simply fudging the numbers to make themselves look better (yes, unfortu-
nately, that does happen). Of course, you need to also be open to the possibility that
someone was innovative, creative, or ﬂat-out brilliant and came up with a better solu-
tion that took less than half the estimated time. It can happen, but remember, things
are more likely to accidentally go wrong than to accidentally go right, so keep a
healthy dose of skepticism handy when reviewing variances.

Let’s return to our example of Patty the code writer. Let’s recap the stats on this
task and look at the variance at the same time, as shown in Table 10.3.The various
data described earlier is summarized in the table. By noting the scheduled or
planned versus the actual and noting the variance, you get a better picture of what’s
actually going on in this task.As you can see, the Expected column is the calculation
of where we should be at this point. Part of the task detail might be a progress
checkpoint at the halfway mark, other times this data will be developed on the ﬂy.
You might choose to create these kinds of checkpoints (milestones) for all tasks on
the critical path so that you can analyze these tasks more thoroughly.

You might look at this and ask why effort and deliverable are at red status when
the deliverable appears to be ahead of schedule.The key is that according to the frame-
work laid out in Table 10.2, anything that is out of variance by 26% or more should be
looked into. In this case, there’s a simple explanation—Patty is getting ready to go on a
four-week vacation to the Mediterranean and wanted to complete her task early in
case there were any issues with her code. She’s been working overtime (she’s salaried,
so there’s no additional incremental cost) to complete her work early.That may be the
only explanation needed. Let’s look at another scenario. Suppose Patty completed
those 7,000 lines of code in just four days, but she’s been stuck on the 7,001th line of
code for three days. She’s expended 75% of the allotted time to accomplish about 70%
of the work, so that would normally look like things were moving along. In truth, she’s
come to a dead halt.Will your variance report tell you that? Not in this case, but since
you’re looking into these large variances, this information should come to light. By
noting the variance and investigating it, you can ﬁnd out whether Patty is truly ahead
of schedule or whether this variance might be an indicator that something is going
wrong. Patty’s input on task progress would indicate whether she is at a dead halt or
whether work is progressing as expected.

Managing IT Projects • Chapter 10
421

What about scope and quality? Are those in or out of variance? Scope and
quality are both deﬁned within the task.The total amount of work to be accom-
plished for Patty’s task should be clearly delineated in a requirements document and
again in the task detail.Although we’ve talked about an estimated 10,000 lines of
code, the scope and quality information will deﬁne what that code should do (one
could write 10,000 lines of code that do nothing or do the wrong thing).The
entry/exit criteria or completion criteria should be clearly delineated, as should the
quality metrics.Although it is possible that Patty’s code is poor quality or does not
address the scope, you have to assume that because Patty was given the task that she
is capable of understanding and delivering on the requirements.As the IT project
manager, you can’t micromanage every project task so you have to trust others to get
their work done according to speciﬁcations.
That said, there should be built-in checks and balances and in an IT project, this
often is accomplished using entry/exit criteria, completion criteria, quality metrics,
and through testing tasks or phases.The task owner (whether that’s Patty or the
Director of Software Engineering who assigned Patty to the task) is responsible for
performing to speciﬁcations and your job is to ensure each task is making required
progress.The point is that you usually cannot clearly quantify scope or quality as
easily as time or cost in terms of how much variance there may be from plan until a
task is complete. For instance, if Patty’s code turns out to be 9,945 lines of code but
does not address one required feature, the scope has been reduced. Could you have
known the scope was being reduced when the task was, say, 75% complete? Maybe,
but not as easily as you could determine that the task was on schedule or on budget.
The same goes for quality.There’s often no reasonable way you can know if Patty’s
work meets or exceeds quality standards until it’s tested, which is generally a separate
task or phase.Thus, it will be difﬁcult to know if there is signiﬁcant variance in
Patty’s work in terms of scope or quality until it’s completed. Most IT projects have
built in ways to determine if there are variances to scope or quality once a task is
complete, but generally do not try to track that during task work itself. In some
cases, you may be able to track variance to scope or quality within the conﬁnes of
the task. If it’s possible and useful, you certainly can do so, but don’t expend too
many cycles on this. Instead, make sure you have good quality control processes to
ensure that scope and quality are met before a task is marked complete and make
sure the right people are assigned to the right tasks.
One ﬁnal note about task progress:There are certainly unknown elements that
could derail this task’s progress. Patty could get sick or win the lottery and not come
back to work. Patty could run into problems with the last segment of code and not
be able to complete it on time or she may have to expend twice the number of
hours to get it completed on time.There are a lot of variables with some types of

tasks and you can’t account for all of them. However, your risk planning should have
addressed the known risks, especially if Patty is the only person who can write that
particular code (resource risk), and if that task is on the critical path (schedule and
project risk).
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Some projects require very rigorous tracking and we’ll discuss some of
those methods in Chapter 11. However, for many IT projects, simply
tracking time, cost, and deliverables is a big improvement over current
methods. Task owners are responsible for tracking and reporting this
data. The person(s) performing the work must track their progress and
report it accurately to the task owner (if the task owner and person
doing task work are not the same person). It doesn’t have to be complex
to be useful and in many projects, anything is an improvement. 
Managing Variance
When you discover a variance in your project (plan versus actual), there are really
only four possible courses of action.You can choose to ignore the variance if it’s
minor or a one-time issue.You can take action to address the issue, or you can
modify the project plan to accommodate the issue. Finally, you can choose to cancel
the project in response to unacceptable levels of variance. Since so much of man-
aging your project is managing variance, we’re going to discuss this in more detail in
the upcoming section titled “Managing Project Change.”
Managing Related Plans
Whether your training, communication, quality testing, or operational transfer plans
are internal or external to your project plan (tasks within your project or check-
points that refer to external plans), you need to keep track of the timelines and
deliverables related to these plans.Two common complaints about IT projects is the
lack of communication and the lack of attention paid to training plans. Both of these
are easily addressed through your project plan, which we discussed earlier in the
book. During the implementation/management phase of the project work, it’s
important for the IT project manager to monitor the coordination of these plans.
You can improve both the perception and the reality of project success by commu-
nicating effectively at appropriate intervals.You can also help by making sure that

changes in this project are mapped with these related (or external) plans so that
changes in one will be appropriately reﬂected in the other.Timing is everything and
that’s certainly true with these types of related plans, so make sure that you (or
someone on your team) is managing or watching over the interaction between your
IT project plan and these related plans. It’s often helpful to delegate this to someone
on your team and it can be set up as a recurring task within the project plan to
ensure these plans remain visible.Also be sure to address the impact of changes in
your project plan on these external plans.You should be aware of what the impact
will be on the external plans if several key project tasks are delayed and be sure to
coordinate with these external plans so things don’t get out of sync.
The IT Factor …
Timing is Everything
When managing your IT project, it’s important to keep an eye on these external
(or related) plans such as training, communications, testing, operational transfer,
etc.. Since the timing of these is related to project progress, those responsible for
related plans rely upon accurate and timely information about the status of the
IT project. “The timing of the training is particularly difﬁcult because if it comes
too early, participants forget what they learned. If it comes too late, participants
may be expected to use new features or products they’re not trained on,
resulting in frustration and low morale. It may be a difﬁcult balance to achieve,”
explains Kim Nagle, Learning & Development Manager at Canyon Ranch. “Many
users have different training needs and often have diverse schedules that must
be accommodated. A one-size-ﬁts-all approach to training is usually not effective
and by working with your company’s training or HR department, you can develop
training plans and schedules that meet the needs of the IT project and the users.
While it may be tricky to coordinate everything, the effort pays off in increased
user satisfaction, higher productivity and a more positive perception of the IT
project.”
Managing Project Change
Managing change is one of the major jobs for the IT PM and IT team during the
work phase of the project. When change occurs, the ﬁrst step is to look for the root
cause of that change. Is it the project deﬁnition? The plan? The WBS? External fac-
www.syngress.com
424
Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

tors? If you don’t look for the root cause of the change, you will miss opportunities
to improve your project management skills. Change means that something is not
going according to the plan, but we all know that plans are rarely perfect.Assessing
what is causing the change will help you not only address this issue, but may also
help you foresee additional issues that might stem from the same root cause. During
the course of the project, the scope, schedule, budget, quality, or requirements can
change.The impact these changes have on other tasks and on the project as a whole
can range from negligible to extensive.“Manage change or it will manage you” is
very true in project management. In this section, we’ll look at these and discuss how
to deal with change so it doesn’t derail your project.
Change Due to Variance
Earlier, we said that if there was any variance, we needed to look at the cause of the
variance and then decide what to do. We really have four primary choices in terms
of dealing with variance and they are:
■
Ignore the variance You can choose to ignore the variance, and in some
cases this is the best option.When would you choose to ignore the variance?
If a task is not on the critical path, minor variances to its schedule may not
be all that important to the outcome of the project. If a task’s variance on
cost is easily explained and you have the reserves to handle it, you may
choose to do nothing. Minor price variations of supplies are an expected
source of variance and can usually be ignored. Let’s be optimistic for a
moment. Perhaps something comes in ahead of schedule or costs less than
anticipated; you might choose to ignore the variance, though you might want
to investigate so you can learn how to repeat that kind of success. Don’t be
fooled, however.When a task comes in far ahead of schedule or far under the
estimated cost, it could be a sign of trouble, as mentioned earlier.
■
Take appropriate action to address the source or effect of the
variance Most of the time when you identify schedule or cost variance,
you’ll need to take steps to address the variance.These steps could include
shufﬂing resources around, modifying the project schedule, reducing project
scope, cutting costs on another task, etc..The appropriate action should be
evaluated in terms of any additional risk it may bring to the project and
what impact it will have on other tasks and the project as a whole.
■
Revise the plan to reﬂect the variation Sometimes the variation is
such that it requires a revision to the project plan.An example of that
might be that a component you were going to use in the project suddenly
www.syngress.com
Managing IT Projects • Chapter 10
425

jumps in price by 500% due to a manufacturing plant going off-line (due
to strike, natural disaster, etc.).You may need to go back and revise the plan
to deal with this variance in cost.You might choose to select a different
component or build the component in-house.These all require changes to
the project plan and each change should be carefully thought out before
being implemented because changes to the project plan (at this point)
come with greater risk.There’s a saying that “Problems are often born of
solutions”—sometimes we ﬁx one thing and break four others.This is
especially true in software development, but holds true in all types of IT
projects.
■
Cancel the project One of the options that people hate to consider at
this point is canceling the project. However, sometimes it’s better to cut
your losses and move on. If a variation to the project schedule will delay
the project to the point that it’s no longer useful, it should be cancelled.An
example of this might be a project to develop an interim software solution
until the network servers are all upgraded. Once the upgrade is complete,
the interim solution will be scrapped and a permanent solution will be
installed. If the network upgrade is supposed to take 24 months and the
interim solution is delayed and isn’t going to be available until month 18, it
might not be worth ﬁnishing the project.Another example is when a pro-
ject gets in trouble ﬁnancially due to cost overruns that make it impossible
or inadvisable to complete the project. While sound planning can help you
avoid some of these scenarios, it can’t prevent them completely and some-
times the most prudent course of action is to cancel the project.
Now, let’s turn our attention to areas that might have variance, why they might
have variance and what you can do to manage variance to get your project back 
on track.
Changes to Schedule
Managing change to the project as a whole is part of change management and it
should follow your established guidelines for change management developed in your
deﬁnition and organization stages. By monitoring the project schedule, reviewing
performance and status reports, and managing change requests, the IT project man-
ager can control the project schedule to the greatest extent possible. However, the
project schedule is one of the parameters that almost always shift as work progresses.
The question is, how do you manage these changes without going crazy or putting
your project at risk?
www.syngress.com
426
Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

The schedule is the number one thing that tends to change in the implementa-
tion phase of the project because we can’t know with absolute certainty how long
tasks will actually take. Ideally, using subject matter experts and historical data, your
estimates are very close to actual. Still, there are unexpected things that always pop
up that make changes to the schedule almost a foregone conclusion. Resources
become unavailable even if they were previously assigned to the project, resources
get overbooked, people leave the company, delays in preceding tasks require
resources to be shufﬂed around—the list is almost endless.
Managing schedule changes means staying on top of current task progress and
looking ahead a step or two in the project to make sure resources are lined up.Your
risk management planning should have addressed the major risks to your schedule
and that planning should have looked closely at all risks to the tasks on the critical
path.You should have a “Plan B” identiﬁed for tasks on the critical path and you
should understand the impact of delays or changes to the schedule of these tasks. If
change is required, assess the impact on other tasks and to the critical path before
implementing schedule changes. Sometimes a solution creates more problems than it
solves, so don’t jump too quickly. Look ﬁrst for optimal solutions and then look at
the reality of your situation. By looking ﬁrst for the “best case scenario” you might
spot an opportunity or two that you would otherwise have missed. Granted, some
schedule changes are simply pushed on you—a task is delayed and it’s not clear it
will be late until the very last minute.These types of changes are difﬁcult to manage
but you should strive to respond rather than react. Responding is a rational action
based on new information; reaction is typically an irrational or poorly planned
action based on new information.Your ﬁrst step, after assessing the situation, is to see
if there are tasks that can be rearranged in order to accommodate the schedule
changes. Sometimes these exist and the schedule can easily be modiﬁed without
changing the project parameters (scope, time, cost, quality).
There are two commonly used methods you can use to get your schedule back
on track if things really take a turn for the worse: crashing and fast tracking. Crashing
occurs when you add more resources to the project to ensure it completes on time.
Clearly this has an impact on your budget because additional resources cost addi-
tional money. Hopefully your reserve amounts will cover all or most of this addi-
tional cost should crashing become necessary.The danger of crashing is that adding
more bodies does not always translate into more work being completed.A good
analogy is that a race horse doesn’t go any faster with two jockeys than it does with
one (and in some cases, it goes slower). In software development, there is a point at
which more bodies will mean less work accomplished, so caution should be used
when deciding to crash a project schedule. Make sure that more bodies really will
www.syngress.com
Managing IT Projects • Chapter 10
427

help.An example of when this might work well is when you have to install 50
servers in ﬁve locations. In that case, more bodies may well get the job done faster.
Fast tracking occurs when tasks that normally would be done sequentially are
done in parallel (at the same time).This allows tasks to be done either at the same
time or with some overlap.An example of fast tracking might be that servers will be
installed as soon as they pass ﬁnal QA testing rather than once all the servers for a
particular location are ready to go.The danger to fast tracking is that you risk
rushing things and this increases risk, especially to quality. Rework is often the result.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
You would typically crash or fast track your schedule if schedule (time)
was your least ﬂexible project parameter. There are risks with both
methods and neither assures you that your project will still complete on
time. If schedule is not your least ﬂexible project parameter, you may do
well to simply push your completion date out rather than incur the risks
these two methods bring to a project.
Changes to Budget
The budget is managed ﬁrst by creating realistic estimates for the cost of the project
(not necessarily the estimates your boss wants to hear). Once the initial budget and
reserve amount are decided upon, a baseline should be established. Monitoring the
cost of each task and the total, cumulative cost of the project regularly is the key to
keeping project costs under control.You can use percent complete, variance, or some
of the techniques we’ll discuss in Chapter 11 to analyze where you are with your
project budget. If the project budget starts getting off track, you’ll need to start rear-
ranging things to stay on track. Remember, though, that you should keep your ﬂexi-
bility grid in mind as you decide what to do. If budget is your least ﬂexible item, you
may have to push your schedule out so you incur fewer costs in a given period of
time or so you incur fewer costs overall.You may also have to go back to the plan-
ning stage to determine how you can accomplish the remaining work for less.
Budget issues stem from four types of problems: ﬂawed estimates, accounting anoma-
lies, permanent variances, and minor variances.
Flawed estimates require a new estimate to be created.This is known in the formal
project management world as generating a new Estimate to Complete (ETC) because
you know that the original estimate was simply wrong.This new estimate should
www.syngress.com
428
Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

specify the additional amount needed to complete the project as well as the actual cost
to date. If known, it may be helpful to note why the estimate was ﬂawed as well as any
lessons learned so you and the team can avoid these errors in the future.
Anomalies are like hiccoughs—they come out of nowhere, they take you by sur-
prise, and there’s not much you can do about it.These types of situations are one-
time events that signiﬁcantly impact your budget, so you will have to account for
them after the fact, though you can’t plan for them before they occur.Your reserve
amount might cover the cost of an anomaly, but you might choose to make this a
discrete line item so your reserve amount can be used for the normal budget vari-
ances that will occur. Here’s an example of one such scenario.You’ve ordered ﬁfty
new servers and as they arrive (ﬁve at a time) your team begins to unpack, con-
ﬁgure, test, and install them. It’s not until you have 35 servers installed that they start
failing and you discover there was a manufacturing problem and all the servers are all
defective.The vendor is willing to replace them immediately, but you’ve already
spent a large portion of your budget (and schedule) unpacking, conﬁguring, testing,
and installing these servers. In order to complete the project on time, you contract
with an external IT company to come in and assist with these tasks on the replace-
ment servers.This unplanned event blows your budget out of the water. It’s not an
estimating error but an anomaly that is unlikely to occur again in the future (if it
does, ﬁre that vendor).All you can do is deal with the anomaly.These types of vari-
ances can be small or large, and what differentiates anomalies from other types of
variances is whether they could not have been reasonably foreseen and are not likely
to occur again. Large anomalies can cause projects to be cancelled at this stage, but
small anomalies can usually be incorporated into the project.
Permanent variances are variances that are expected to be typical for the remainder
of the project.An example of a permanent variance is that the materials you needed
have gone up in price by 20% but that price increase is locked in for another 12
months, so while you are protected against any further increases the remainder of
your project will show a -20% variance (remember, a negative variance means your
plan is better than your actual) on this line item.Another example of a permanent
variance is if the people assigned to the task are not as skilled or competent as
expected.They make take more time to complete tasks (more paid hours), you may
have to provide additional training, or you may have to bring in outside contractors
to assist.This causes permanent variances moving forward unless other actions can be
taken. Permanent variances may or may not be addressed by the reserve amount. In
some cases, the permanent variance should be added to the cost of the project and
the reserve left intact to account for other minor variances that may occur. How it is
handled is a matter for you, your project sponsor, and your Accounting department
to decide upon.
www.syngress.com
Managing IT Projects • Chapter 10
429

Minor variances also occur in projects, which is why you created a reserve amount
in your budget for each phase of the project (or each major deliverable).These are to
be expected and you may choose to set a threshold for “minor” so that you and the
team are clear what minor means in terms of a budget variance. Certainly you don’t
want to get pulled from a meeting if the cost of a task will exceed budget by 5%. By
the same token, 5% variances can add up quickly. Deﬁne acceptable variances and
closely monitor your reserves.
Cheat Sheet…
Bring in the Reserves
Remember when you created your schedule and budget based on your WBS and
your best estimates for time and cost? You created reserves for each based on a
number of factors. When evaluating change to the project, make sure you
remember your reserve amounts. Most minor variances can be dealt with from
the reserves. Major or unanticipated variances often have to be handled differ-
ently. Typically these major variances must be added to the overall project
schedule and/or budget rather than being handled through reserves. This will
help you keep the project on course by leaving you with reserves to provide ﬂex-
ibility to address the day-to-day variances that occur. You may have to “spend”
your entire reserve amount if the variance is huge, but that means that every
other task (both time and cost) will have to hit dead on for the project to com-
plete as expected. The odds of that are about the same as winning the state lot-
tery, so be wary of using up your reserves for large, unexpected variances (your
project sponsor may require you use your reserves respond to a large variance,
but that won’t change the fact that minor variances will still occur).
Changes to Scope
Changes to scope can be managed or unmanaged. Unmanaged changes to scope are
often referred to as scope creep. Scope creep occurs when the amount of work expands
after the project plan has been agreed upon and approved. One of the ways this occurs
is through team members interacting with users or stakeholders and informally
agreeing to changes outside of project meetings.Another way this occurs is when
executives or your project sponsor insert work into the project after the plan is set.
Your ﬁrst line of defense is to make it clear to your team that the only changes to the
work of the project that are made are those discussed and agreed upon in project team

Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

meetings.Your scope of work is modiﬁed when a proposed change is approved and
incorporated into the project plan. For instance, if you have a permanent budget vari-
ance, you (you, the team, project sponsor, stakeholders) may decide to reduce the scope
of the project so that the ﬁnal budget is closer to the planned budget.This would indi-
cate that budget is least ﬂexible and scope is somewhat (or most) ﬂexible.Another time
you may choose to reduce scope to meet schedule requirements or hard deadlines.You
may choose to increase the scope in order to accommodate market or user changes or
to incorporate a leading edge technology that just became available. However,
increasing scope also means something else has to change. Remember the relationship
between scope, time, cost, and quality.When your scope increases, you’ll have to
increase your schedule, increase your budget, or reduce your quality to accommodate
this change. In some cases, you may be able to add scope without impacting schedule
or budget, but those instances are few and far between.
Requested changes almost always impact scope in one way or another, so the
logical starting point is your Work Breakdown Structure. Remember that your scope
is essentially deﬁned by the tasks in the WBS, so managing your scope means man-
aging the tasks of the project. Change might be in the amount of work requested,
changes to the attributes of the deliverables, or changes to the methods used to
create the deliverables. Each of these changes should be evaluated to determine the
change to the WBS so that you will know where tasks need to be added, removed,
or modiﬁed to accommodate the change.Then you should evaluate whether the
requested change is logical, desirable, feasible, and affordable.You also need to under-
stand how this increased scope will impact the remainder of your project, especially
as it relates to schedule, budget, resource allocation, and tasks on your critical path.
Once you understand the nature and impact of the requested change, you can make
a determination as to whether or not (or how) to implement the change.
Reviewing status and progress reports can also lead to change requests. It’s pos-
sible that as work progresses, it becomes clear that the project will not be able to
deliver on one or more objectives as it currently stands.This might become clear
through reporting and analysis of progress reports. It’s also possible that through
progress reporting you discover the project is on better footing that you planned and
you can accommodate that last-minute,“must have” feature that users have been
clamoring for.

Cheat Sheet…
Scope Creep 101
One of the most common problems that happens in projects is scope creep.
Scope creep is sneaky and it often happens when you least suspect. When man-
aging a project, it’s important to continually keep an eye on scope. Every time
you consider making a change, you should ask what effect the change will have
on scope. There are a lot of changes that can happen in a project that have a rel-
atively low impact, but changes that impact your scope ripple through your pro-
ject and become magniﬁed. To avoid the ripple effect of scope creep, make sure
you continually ask if changes will impact scope and then decide whether that’s
acceptable or not. Be sure to understand how and where that ripple effect will
occur.
Managing Change Requests
Change requests typically involve changes to scope, but they can conceivably involve
changes to schedule, budget, or quality. Changes to functional or technical require-
ments usually fall in the category of scope change. Change can come from verbal or
written requests, from inside or outside the organization, or from legal or regulatory
requirements. Regardless of the nature of the change request, one of the most
important tasks of an IT project manager during this phase is to manage change
requests. If your team is constantly shooting at a moving target, it’s unlikely the goals
of the project will be met. Change control is the way you prevent the moving target
syndrome.Though we discussed change management earlier in the book, it’s worth
repeating at this juncture.
First, your change management process should be clear about how change can
be requested, how change is evaluated, and how change is made to the project. Most
change requests fall into one of four categories: errors or omissions, risk response,
value-added, or external events.
Errors and omissions are perhaps the most common source of change requests in a
project.Through the project management process, you’ve attempted to reduce or
eliminate the need for rework due to errors or omissions, but they sometimes still
occur.The error or omission might be due to a forgotten or overlooked task in the
WBS (one that should be in the WBS and is not), an overlooked or forgotten fea-
ture of the project deliverables (functional speciﬁcation error), or an error in the
www.syngress.com
432
Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

technical speciﬁcations discovered during the work phase. Changes that address gaps
or shortfalls in the project must be assessed based on their impact to project scope,
schedule, budget, quality, requirements, and risks.
Change also occurs when you have to respond to project risk (risk response),
whether planned or unplanned. If you have to implement “Plan B” for a particular
work package or project phase, that forces change on the project. Having to develop
“Plan C” on the ﬂy due to unforeseen circumstances also forces change on the pro-
ject.The degree to which change occurs as a result of implementing contingency
plans should be part of the risk management and assessment phase. If it wasn’t
assessed at that time, make sure you and the team take a look at the impact of Plan B
to your project’s scope, schedule, budget, requirements, and quality before imple-
menting it. Even if you assessed your risks associated with Plan B, it’s always a good
idea to re-evaluate them based on the current project status and data since many
things change between planned and actual as work progresses.
Value-added change requests are just that—they are changes that will add value to
the project such as a change that will reduce the overall cost of the project or a
change that will shorten the project schedule by two weeks or a change that will
add functionality, usability, or other desirable features to the project. Value-added
change is typically a positive thing, but it should be scrutinized just as any other
change should be.
External events can drive change requests as well. If you’re developing a software
product that deals with ﬁnance, you may have to change your speciﬁcations in
response to changing local, state, or federal laws.These are external events that should
have been assessed during the risk assessment phase (“What external factors might
impact your project?”), but these kinds of changes cannot always be known in advance.
Requesting change to the project should be a formal process.You can download
a change request template from the Syngress website if you don’t already have a solid
change request process in place.The elements of a change control system include:
■
Document requested change and reason for request.
■
Evaluate impact of requested change on scope, schedule, budget, require-
ments, quality, and WBS.
■
Determine whether or not to implement change.
■
Determine approval levels needed (if any).
■
Determine if any special communication is needed with respect to the
requested/approved change.
www.syngress.com
Managing IT Projects • Chapter 10
433

■
Integrate the change into the project plan.
■
Update any related external plans impacted by the change (training, opera-
tional transfer, etc.).
■
Document lessons learned, if applicable.
Taking Corrective Action
Any corrective action you take is, by deﬁnition, a change to the project. It’s impor-
tant to understand this so you don’t inadvertently introduce new problems into the
project. If you recall from our discussion about quality in Chapter 7, change
becomes riskier and more expensive the further out in time you go (that is, the fur-
ther into the project work you get). Each change carries its own unique set of risks
and it’s your job as IT project manager to weigh the risks and the beneﬁts of the
change. Once you’ve evaluated the reward relationship, you can make an informed
decision as to the proper course of action. Some changes may be mandated (by the
project sponsor, stakeholders, or legal requirements) and you have only two choices:
make the required change or terminate the project. In some cases, you may choose
to terminate the project because to incorporate the required change would cause the
project to fail. In other cases, you have to determine the impact of the required
change and modify your project plan (including scope, schedule, budget, require-
ments, quality metrics, WBS, and task details) to reﬂect that change. Corrective
action could (and often does) introduce new problems, so don’t take corrective
action without fully assessing the impact on the project.
The IT Factor…
Responding to Change
When the folks at NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory were preparing the
Mars mission, they had a hard deadline because there were only certain times the
rocket could be launched when the planets were properly aligned for the mis-
sion. During the course of the project, the team creating the landing system dis-
covered they’d underestimated the actual weight of the Mars vehicle (designed
by a different team) and had to go back to the drawing board to redesign a
landing system that could accommodate the weight of the vehicles. They didn’t
have a choice about making this change nor did they have a choice about the

Continued

schedule. In their case, the schedule was the least ﬂexible item, and quality was
a close second because it wouldn’t do to meet the deadline and have the Mars
vehicle crash and burn as it landed on the surface of Mars. Their team raced
against the clock to get the project completed. Another team responsible for the
software systems had the launch and landing software tested and ready to go,
but were unable to complete the surface navigation software in time. However,
they knew that they had a small window of opportunity to complete this task
without putting the mission at risk because the navigation software had two ﬂex-
ible features the rest of the mission did not: it was not required to be completed
at launch (no ﬁnish-to-start dependency with launch) and it could be modiﬁed
on the ﬂy by beaming the new software code up to the vehicles once they were
en route to Mars or even on the surface of Mars.
This is a great example of how projects progress. Errors, omissions, and
changes will occur, even when it is rocket science. The key is how well you assess
your options and how innovative you can be in responding to change.
Managing Project Risk
Once you have a risk management process in place, you need to actively monitor
the project for those risks. However, the risks you identiﬁed and planned for are not
the only risks your project will encounter. We discussed the risk and cost of changes
in later stages of the project plan and even if those risks and contingency plans were
assessed and “planned” for, they may still have secondary effects you were not aware
of.This cycle of project risk is shown in Figure 10.5.You can see that even if the
risk is identiﬁed and “Plan B” is implemented, you may still be creating secondary
risks. Sometimes those risks are minor, sometimes they’re major but you’ve
accounted for them, and sometimes they’re major and completely unexpected.

Risk monitoring and control occur in this phase of the project lifecycle.The
methods of managing risk include:
■
Having and using a risk management plan
■
Communicating project risks
■
Actively monitoring for new risks
■
Assessing impact of scope change
As you move from one phase to the next or one set of deliverables to another,
you should review your risk management plan and be aware of the risks your team
identiﬁed. If a risk was anticipated, it should not come as a surprise simply because
you (or your team) forgot to review your risk management plan. It’s sometimes
helpful to add milestones to your project schedule either to indicate places where
risk has been identiﬁed, trigger points for identiﬁed risks, or simply as a reminder to
review your risk management plan periodically.You should also periodically discuss
and review project risk in your project team meetings, especially risks to your critical
path tasks.This discussion can include risks that are pending, coming up, or just dis-
covered. It can also be used to discuss the potential secondary risks discovered as a
result of one or more changes to the project.Another risk management tool is the
Earned Value Analysis, which we discuss at length in Chapter 11.This can help assess
project progress and identify overall project risk. One ﬁnal tool for managing project
risk is the monitoring or measuring of performance against speciﬁcation. If the pro-
ject team does not have the skills and talents necessary to accomplish the project
work, your project is at risk.This may not have been an identiﬁed risk during your
project risk evaluation process, so it might crop up only as work gets underway.
What can you do to manage risk? We’ve previously discussed developing contin-
gency plans for project risks that have the highest likelihood of occurring and the
highest impact to the project. We can manage risk through:
■
Workarounds Workarounds are ad hoc responses to risks that were not
planned. Workarounds should be assessed to determine whether secondary
risks exist and if those risks are acceptable.
■
Corrective actions Corrective actions are actions you take to keep your
project on track. Often corrective actions are minor tweaks you make as
part of your day-to-day IT project management.Any type of corrective
action typically carries secondary risk, which should be identiﬁed and
assessed.

Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

■
Change requests Changes to the project work or project plan due to risk
should be brought through the standard change management process.These
changes should be reﬂected in the project plan and accounted for in the
scope, schedule, budget, requirements, or quality metrics of the plan.
■
Risk response plans/updates As identiﬁed risks occur and contingency
plans are implemented, these changes should be documented and reﬂected
in the updated project plan. Sometimes during the course of project work,
the risks or risk priorities shift. If this occurs, the risk management plan
should also be updated to reﬂect new risks or new priorities for those risks.
Remember, when assessing changes and risks, it’s important to keep your critical
path tasks in mind. Risks and changes to tasks on the critical path require careful
review of potential ramiﬁcations. Risks and changes to tasks that are not on the crit-
ical path also require careful assessment, but by deﬁnition, changes to these tasks will
be less dramatic, at least to the project schedule, than tasks on the critical path.
Finally, keep in mind that changes to tasks can place them on the critical path, so
evaluate change before implementing them to keep your project on an even keel.
Managing the Project Team
We’ve discussed how to manage and motivate a project team at length earlier in this
book, so we’re not going to repeat that material here. If you are new to IT project
management or new to management in general, you may not feel comfortable man-
aging a group of people over whom you have no direct authority. If that’s the case,
you should review earlier material on managing highly effective teams and you
should seek the advice and guidance from a more experienced project manager.That
said, we will discuss some of the common problems project managers run into in
managing the team and we’ll give you a few pointers to use to help overcome those
problems.
Effective IT Project Management
If you don’t like working with people, you’re probably always going to have mixed
emotions about project management. Projects don’t just happen, people make them
happen and the project manager’s job is to ensure that those people have the time,
skills, tools, and motivation needed to get the project tasks done.The job of an IT
project manager is one part manager, one part communicator, one part negotiator,
and one part cheerleader.To manage the project successfully, you’ll need to manage
people successfully. Some IT PMs just naturally work well with people, others
www.syngress.com
Managing IT Projects • Chapter 10
437

struggle a bit. We’re not going to give you a short course on management here, but
we can give you a few tips to make your job as IT PM just a bit easier. Keep these
principles in mind as you work with your team.
■
Share information Information is power, so share information with your
team.You will empower them to do their jobs and you will develop a two-
way trust that can help when the going gets rough. If you can’t share cer-
tain conﬁdential information, tell them that rather than side-step the issue.
Otherwise, share as much information as is reasonable and prudent.
Hoarding information will eventually hogtie the project.
■
Find ways to motivate It’s often argued that you can’t really motivate
anyone, they have to motivate themselves.That said, there are things you
can do that will inspire others to do a good job for your project. Find ways
to let people on the team know that their contribution is meaningful and
appreciated. Let them know you understand their situation (if they’re
working overtime to get the job done, etc.).Thank people for small and
large contributions to the project. Find ways to align project work with
people’s work personalities (see earlier chapters in this book for more
detail).
■
Remove obstacles One of the ways a manager can inspire commitment
and hard work is to be committed to removing as many obstacles as pos-
sible for the project team. If team members are having difﬁculty gaining
access to a room needed to set up a lab, take that task on yourself. Make it
happen and let the team continue to work on their project tasks. If you see
your job as IT PM as the person responsible for removing the roadblocks
to success, you’ll do your project and your team a great service. Don’t take
on everyone’s battles—certainly team members will have to deal with their
own issues, but do work to remove obstacles that impact your project when
appropriate.
■
Don’t take it personally Whether someone does a good or bad job,
whether they’re early, on time, or late, don’t take it personally. Most of the
time, work performance issues are unrelated to the IT project manager (and
unrelated to the project itself sometimes).As a manager, you have to
develop a bit thicker skin. Continue to focus on the outcome. Continually
ask yourself,“What outcome do I want and will this action help me get the
outcome?” If the answer is no, stop. If the answer is yes, continue. Focusing
on behavior, results, and outcomes—not personalities—will help you
manage the project and your team.

Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

■
Foster cooperation, not competition We live in a competitive world
and many companies encourage competition—either implicitly or explic-
itly. On a project team, however, competition is usually a negative force
causing people to withhold information, hoard resources, and generally
work as individuals rather than as a team.You pull together a project team
because you need the project work to be greater than the sum of its parts.
If that wasn’t the case, you wouldn’t need a team at all and you could
simply hire contractors to do work and be done with it. Most projects
require problem solving, innovation, and other skills that are greatly
enhanced by team membership. Look for ways to encourage team members
to cooperate and only reward cooperative (not competitive) behavior. Some
competition may be ﬁne if done in the spirit of making the project better,
but don’t let it rule the team.
■
Foster exceptional project work performance In order for individ-
uals on the project team to do a good job, they must have ﬁve things:
■
A clear understanding of the purpose, goals and objectives for the task
(or project).
■
A plan for how to achieve the goals and objectives.
■
The skills, resources, and time to do the job.
■
Feedback on performance.
■
A clear understanding of his or her authority to make decisions and
take corrective action to deal with variances to the plan.
The last bullet point is particularly important because team members must be
empowered, to some degree, to make decisions in order to complete tasks successfully.
Have you ever called an 800 number about a problem with a credit card statement and
gotten that person that says,“You are correct.This charge posted twice. However, I am
not able to ﬁx the problem.” It drives most of us nuts because we’re required to jump
through three more hoops to get the problem resolved simply because the person to
whom we ﬁrst spoke did not have the authority to resolve the problem.This will drive
your team members nuts as well when they face problems they know how to resolve
but lack the authority to do so.A person without information cannot take responsi-
bility.A person cannot take responsibility without authority.When someone is respon-
sible for a deliverable but is not given the authority to get the job done, they will
typically either seize authority or fail. Neither is an ideal outcome.

The IT Factor…
Power On The Front Lines
Most people these days are familiar with Federal Express. Years ago, they became
innovators in their ﬁeld for a number of reasons, but one of the reasons that still
stands out is that the people who answered their phones were actually empow-
ered to ﬁx problems. This was quite different from the way others companies ran
at that time. The typical response was, “I’ll have to talk to my supervisor,” or “Call
back tomorrow,” or “There’s nothing I can do about that.” At FedEx, people who
answered the phones were given a deﬁned amount of authority. They could
credit you for a package that arrived late. They could send a courier out for a
missed or late pick up. They could actually DO something about many of the
problems they ﬁelded. This not only improved morale, but it helped build the rep-
utation for quality that FedEx came to be associated with. Customers and
employees alike were more satisﬁed and it’s a fair bet to say that costs went
down because fewer people had to call in multiple times, so fewer operators
were needed. Delegate responsibility and a deﬁned amount of authority to get
the work done. If you hand out responsibility without authority, it will backﬁre
and reappear as morale, productivity, or quality problems. Besides, if you can’t
trust your team with both responsibility and authority, you have a bigger
problem to address.
Dealing with Project Team Issues
As an IT project manager, you’ll have to manage the performance of team members
even when you lack the formal authority to do so. Review Chapter 4 for more in-
depth information on this topic. In this section, we’re going to focus speciﬁcally on
issues that may crop up during the work phase of the project.As with other topics,
the list is not intended to be exhaustive, but to cover some of the most common
issues that arise. If you run into issues you don’t know how to handle, beeline it to
your HR department or your manager for some impartial advice or coaching.
Whatever you do, don’t let project or team issues simply slide.They tend to only get
bigger and more complicated with each passing day.
Deliverables
If project team members fail to meet deadlines for deliverables, the project schedule
will begin to slip. How much it slips obviously depends on how much each task slips
www.syngress.com
440
Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

and whether or not it’s on the critical path. Failure to meet deliverable deadlines can
indicate that team members:
■
Have too much work to do
■
Have run into a problem completing the work
■
Lack the skills required to complete the work
■
Lack the motivation to complete the work
Many experienced managers know that most performance issues typically boil
down to two root problems: competence and attitude. If someone is incapable of
completing the work, your job as IT project manager is to either reassign that task to
someone who is qualiﬁed or provide the training, tools, or resources needed for the
current person to complete that work. If someone is unwilling to complete the work,
you have to either talk with that person to change his or her attitude or remove him
or her from the team.
As the IT project manager, you may be hesitant to take action related to perfor-
mance, especially if you lack formal organizational authority. However, performance
problems by team members put your project at risk, so it is incumbent upon you to
deal with these issues clearly, directly, and immediately. Some problems do just go
away, but performance problems are usually not among them. If you’re not comfort-
able discussing these problems with a team member, go to your Human Resources
manager (or equivalent) and ask for advice and language to use in dealing with these
issues. Having the right language to use to address the issue in an appropriate
manner can be the biggest challenge and a good HR person can help you out.
As mentioned earlier in the book, your project processes should include a per-
formance evaluation process (typically performed at project close out and discussed
in Chapter 12). Managing performance, like managing your project, is a daily task
not just something you do when closing out the project.

The IT Factor…
Human Resources Are Part of Your Team
New managers of any kind (including IT project managers) tend to feel like they
should have all the answers. In truth, no one has all the answers. A great way to
learn how to become a better manager is to talk about your challenges with your
manager or with someone in Human Resources. “There’s usually someone in the
HR department who can coach you on how to deal with a variety of problems
that come with managing people,” explains David Getman, Human Resources
Director for Canyon Ranch. “HR staff help managers by providing an impartial
view of the situation, by discussing the problem and potential solutions, by
helping the manager understand the organizational or legal implications (if any),
or by coaching the manager on how to handle a situation. Often simply providing
some suggested language to use is a tremendous help. HR can be a very valuable
part of your team and it’s a resource many people forget when they’re busy man-
aging their project.”
Quality
If team members are completing tasks below the required level of quality (perfor-
mance to speciﬁcations), your project is in serious risk.You can refer back to
Chapter 7 for a thorough discussion of quality, but in this section we’ll discuss how
team members may contribute to quality problems and what you can do to address
these issues. Quality problems can be performance issues, but they can also point to
process or speciﬁcation issues.Your ﬁrst task, then, is to determine the root cause of
the quality problem. Quality problems tend to fall into one of three categories in IT
project work: performance-based, process-based, or speciﬁcation-based.
Performance
Performance issues can be the cause of poor quality work from team members. In
some cases, the person doing the work lacks the skill or ability to do the task, in
which case you have to reassign that task or provide training, coaching, or guidance.
In other cases, quality issues may stem from a lack of understanding about require-
ments or a lack of attention to requirements. In either case, your job as IT PM is to
review the requirements for the task(s) and ensure the team member has the capa-
bility and resources to complete or rework the task so it meets quality standards.
www.syngress.com
442
Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

Process 
Process issues can also create quality problems if the deﬁned process or procedure is
incorrect. Some procedures may be developed at the outset of the project and may
require reﬁnement or modiﬁcation during the course of the project. Other proce-
dures may not be obviously incorrect but yield sub-optimal quality results. If you’re
conﬁdent the team member has the skills and capabilities to accomplish the task and
understands the speciﬁcations, you may want to check the process they’re using to
determine if this is the root cause.The team member may be performing work in
the wrong order, may be receiving work in the wrong order, or may be following
incorrect procedures. For instance, if a procedure was written up for installing a disk
drive in a server and it stated that the drive should be installed with power on, this
may be incorrect and yield a high number of initial drive failures.The team member
may faithfully follow procedure but that is what leads to the quality issue.
Speciﬁcations
Many IT projects have speciﬁcations, both functional and technical, developed at the
front end of the project during a feasibility study or during the deﬁnition stage.
Sometimes the speciﬁcations end up being slightly off or ﬂat out wrong. Sometimes
speciﬁcations change after the project is deﬁned, sometimes an error is made in
writing the speciﬁcation, and other times the speciﬁcations are correct but impos-
sible to meet. Quality issues that stem from problems in the speciﬁcations are the
most serious because they typically mean that one or more parts of the project plan
will have to be revised and this almost always impacts scope, schedule, and budget
(we know it will impact quality because that’s what prompted the action in the ﬁrst
place).
Communication
Teams often experience communication problems at one point or another. We all
know people who are excellent communicators and others who have difﬁculty
stringing together a coherent sentence. Good communications are crucial for a suc-
cessful project as you and the team try to manage many moving parts. If the team is
having difﬁculty communicating, look for root causes. One of the important ele-
ments we discussed at length in Chapter 4 was differences in styles. People with dif-
ferent work styles communicate very differently and this can lead to frustration and
miscommunication. Someone from Marketing might naturally talk more and speak
in “big picture” terms while someone from Engineering is busy worrying about
exactly what the Marketing person means because it’s not quantiﬁable or because it
seems vague.These kinds of style differences can be managed, but it takes a good
www.syngress.com
Managing IT Projects • Chapter 10
443

team leader to recognize these problems and address them. Often the best course of
action in these situations is to use active listening skills, paraphrasing speaker’s mes-
sages and acting almost as a translator so your team can ﬁnd that middle ground.
Also keep in mind if you’re communicating across electronic links (phone, video
conferencing) and across time zones and cultures that extra attention must be given
to team communications.
Dealing with Project Team Meeting Issues
Having an agenda can help keep the meeting on track, but someone (that is, you, the
IT project manager) has to manage the meeting. In some companies, the task of
moderating or facilitating the meeting rotates so that each team member has a turn
at running the team meeting. In other cases, if you have someone on the team who’s
good at facilitating meetings, you may ask him or her to be the team meeting mod-
erator on a permanent (for the project) basis.A well-run meeting can help avoid
many of the problems we’ll discuss next so it’s worthwhile to learn to run an effec-
tive meeting or to ﬁnd someone who is good at it.Your HR department may offer
classes, tips, or coaching on running effective meetings and it’s a great skill to have.
Even if you’re great at running meetings, some problems will probably crop up.
While there’s no standard set of problems, here are a few you might encounter and
what they might indicate.
■
Team members miss project team meetings
Problem: People miss scheduled meetings either because something unex-
pected came up or because they are purposely avoiding the meeting. In the
latter case, they may be skipping the meetings because they feel the meet-
ings are not productive or because they are scheduled at a time that is difﬁ-
cult to break away.
Solution: Make sure your project team meetings are short and to the
point. Make sure you have an agenda going in and that you stick to the
agenda.Team members can socialize before or after meetings, but don’t let
the meeting itself turn into a schmooze-fest. Make sure meetings start and
end on time and accomplish their objectives.Talk with missing team mem-
bers one-on-one to determine the reason for the team member’s absence.
■
Team members arrive late or are ill-prepared for team meetings
Problem: Team members may arrive late or be ill-prepared because they
occasionally run late or because they are not placing a priority on these
meetings.They may simply have too much work to do to arrive on time or
www.syngress.com
444
Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

to be prepared, but these should raise warning ﬂags for you. If they have so
much work they cannot arrive on time and prepared, they may not be
giving their attention to your IT project (assuming they have multiple pri-
orities and projects, which most people do).
Solution: Again, if the meetings are well-run, people are less likely to
arrive late or ill-prepared. If the meeting starts on time and covers the
agenda items, people are more likely to attend and be prepared because
they know they will be called upon to discuss their data. Many project
teams produce a status report based on the outcomes of the previous
meeting, which helps keep everyone on the same page. If a team member is
ill-prepared, talk with him or her one-on-one to determine if there is a
misunderstanding about what is expected for team meetings. If they have
too much work on their plates, you need to work with them to ﬁnd a
solution that will allow them and your project to be successful.
■
Team members bicker during team meetings
Problem: Team members seem to disagree on everything during team
meetings.They cannot come to consensus and some seem to play devil’s
advocate just for fun.
Solution: This problem can occur when team members represent different
corporate interests such as Marketing and Engineering. If the root cause
appears to be a difference of perspective, you might assign the opposite
point of view to the team members and ask them to argue “the other
guy’s” case.This often helps people see things from the other’s point of
view and helps bridge gaps.You might also schedule an additional meeting
to hammer out these differences so things can move forward. Make sure
you stick to the meeting agenda and request (require) that team members
discuss things in a positive framework.
■
Team members do not participate in team meetings
Problem: Team members come to meetings but do not participate or par-
ticipate minimally. When called upon they reply with “I don’t know” or
“I’m not sure” or “I have no opinion.”This is sometimes caused by people
feeling the meeting is a waste of their time or that the meeting is a hostile
environment in which to interact. Other times it is caused by people
feeling nervous talking in front of a group or they may simply be shy and
not assert themselves in the conversation.
www.syngress.com
Managing IT Projects • Chapter 10
445

Solution: Make sure the meeting is effective and also make sure you foster
a positive communication style.Ask people to focus on behaviors and tasks,
not personalities. If a team member is simply not comfortable talking in the
group, draw him or her into the discussion at points where their expertise
would be useful. Make sure to call upon team maters who are not volun-
tarily talking.Ask open-ended questions that require a longer response than
“I don’t know” to get all team members participating.
■
Team members interrupt, talk too long, meander
Problem: Team members interupt each other or don’t stay on topic.
Interrupting others can be a sign of poor manners, excitement, or lack of
awareness. Regardless of the root cause, you should encourage team mem-
bers to be respectful of others and that means allowing others to ﬁnish
their thoughts or statements. On the ﬂip side, there seem to be people who
seem to be unaware that they talk non-stop.These folks can go on and on
and say little, if anything, of importance. Oddly, the best way to manage
these people is to interrupt because otherwise they will dominate a conver-
sation, often without even meaning to do so. However, the person to inter-
rupt should be the moderator or team meeting leader.
Solution: One of the jobs of the moderator is to make sure the meeting
stays on track so the moderator can and should politely interrupt people
who go on and on. If everyone understands the role of the moderator, they
are less likely to take offense if they are interrupted. Finally, you can hold
“stand up meetings” where there are no chairs in the room.This can facili-
tate focused communication and information sharing and provide a needed
change of position for people who sit all day long.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Create an atmosphere that is positive and conducive to teamwork. That
means not allowing team members to be rude or disrespectful of others’
opinions. It also means drawing out the quieter, less talkative members
of the team. If someone complains, ask him or her to phrase it in terms
of a problem/solution so that they have to provide a recommendation
for change. This causes people to take responsibility for their communi-
cations and helps build a more productive team atmosphere. If someone
does not participate, speciﬁcally call upon them and ask an easy, safe,
www.syngress.com
446
Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

open-ended question. If someone tends to dominate the conversation,
politely interrupt them and call on others. Don’t let poor team commu-
nications hold your project captive.
How to Deal with Interpersonal Issues
Entire books have been written on this topic, so we can only point you in the right
direction here.As stated earlier, your HR department can be a great resource for
guiding you through the process of dealing with a wide range of personnel type
issues. Of course, don’t go marching into HR thinking you can dump your problems
on their doorstep—not so.They’re there to guide and coach you, not to do your job
for you. When dealing with team issues, you should start at the top and work your
way down. What that means is that you should not get involved with or be con-
cerned about interpersonal issues that do not impact your project’s goals, objectives,
and deliverables.The most advisable course of action with interpersonal issues is for
you to take each party aside individually and discuss the problem candidly. Find out
what that person is willing to do differently to improve the situation. Do this with
each person involved.Then, set a meeting with all parties to discuss the problem and
the agreements you’ve forged. By discussing the issues individually, you give each
person the opportunity to safely vent their frustrations without adding fuel to the
ﬁre. By gathering everyone together after that, you bring people back together to re-
create their relationships based on their agreements. If this all sounds a bit too
touchy-feely for you, remember that if your team doesn’t work well together, your
project may fall apart. If you’re not comfortable doing these things, get some assis-
tance from your HR department. Whatever you do, don’t ignore these kinds of
issues because they will eventually affect everyone on the team, not just the
offending parties.
If a person refuses to acknowledge his or her part in the problem or if they’re
unwilling to change, you might consider removing them from the project team
because interpersonal issues can pull a team apart quickly. Of course, that’s in the
ideal world—in the real world you may not have the authority to remove someone
from the project. However, if the problem puts the project in jeopardy, you should
have a serious discussion with your project sponsor and encourage him or her to
allow you to replace one or more people on the team. If the project is worth doing,
it’s not worth putting in jeopardy because of one or two unruly or incorrigible
people.

Finishing Project Work
The exit point from the project implementation or work phase is the project close-
out. We’ll discuss closing out the project in Chapter 12.The deliverable from this
stage is the entire set of project deliverables as well as an up-to-date project plan
showing the baseline and actual-to-date information.The deliverables and project
plan are depicted in Figure 10.6 and are the output or result of this phase of the
project.There may be additional data that you add, revise, or update during the
close-out phase and we’ll discuss that in Chapter 12. Before we head into Chapter
12, we’ll discuss some of the more technical project tracking methods in Chapter 11
as well as common project problems and how to address them.

Summary
After you’ve deﬁned, organized, and planned your project, you’re ready to begin pro-
ject work.The process of implementing your project involves starting work, moni-
toring progress, managing variance, and reporting status.These are iterative processes
that continue until all project work is complete. For the most part, these activities are
described in your project processes and procedures at the outset of project planning.
Project status can be monitored through the use of team meetings, status reports,
and issues logs.Throughout this process you should capture lessons learned so you
and the team can learn in real time. When problems do arise, they can be handled
through standard project processes including team meetings, status reports, issues
logs, bug tracking and escalations. Progress can be stated as percent complete, but it’s
important to use the percent complete of tasks, time, and cost in order to get a bal-
anced view of progress.
Variances to the plan will occur as things move and shift. Managing these
changes is one of the jobs of the IT project manager. Variances can be measured by
percent complete versus expected at any given point in the task.At the halfway
point in any task, the time and cost should be roughly 50% of total. Signiﬁcant vari-
ances (over and under) should be investigated thoroughly.
When change occurs in a project, you have four possible responses: do nothing,
repair the problem, revise the plan, or terminate the project. If change occurs to your
schedule, you can choose to crash or fast track your schedule. Both techniques deal
with schedule problems, but both introduce their own unique set of risks to the pro-
ject. Each method should be evaluated prior to implementing. Changes to budgets
also can occur and there are four sources of budget changes: ﬂawed estimates,
anomalies, permanent variance, and minor variance. Each has a different impact on
your project and some may end up causing the project to be terminated.The reserve
created for schedule or budget can be used for minor variances, but larger variances
may have to be treated as more separate, discrete elements depending on their size
and impact to the project.
Change to the scope is the most dangerous because it often creeps in unnoticed
(hence the term scope creep). Managing the scope is another important job of the IT
PM. Scope is deﬁned through the Work Breakdown Structure and the task details, so
keeping an eye on changes in this area will help avoid scope creep. Deﬁne and
enforce change control procedures so that work is not added to your project without
the team knowing and accepting these changes. Remember that increases in scope
almost always result in a change to the schedule, budget, or quality.

external events.All change is a risk to your project, so it’s important to evaluate the
impact of change on project parameters (scope, time, cost, quality) as well as the
impact on the functional and technical requirements.
During your planning phase, you should have worked with the project team to
identify and plan for risks (based on likelihood of occurrence and impact on the
project). During the work phase, you may run into those risks or other unexpected
risks. When these problems occur, you have four possible responses: workaround,
corrective action, change request, or risk response. Since each of these involves some
change to the project, each should be evaluated before being implemented to avoid
introducing secondary risks and new problems.
Managing the project team can be a challenge for ﬁrst-time IT project managers
and for those who would rather talk to computers than to human beings. Honing
your people management skills will help you become a better IT project manager.
Keep your manager, project sponsor, or HR department in mind when looking for
assistance in dealing with team personnel issues.The success of the project is depen-
dent upon the skills, talents, and motivation of the IT project team. If performance
or quality issues exist, look for the root cause. Determine if the person has the skills,
time, and resources to properly do the job. If the problem is one of attitude or moti-
vation, you face a different challenge, but you must deal with the issue if you want
your project to succeed. Keys to managing your team well are to delegate, share
information, and provide the authority commensurate with the responsibility so
team members can effectively do what’s asked of them. Deal with team communica-
tion, performance, or interpersonal issues quickly because they will only ﬂare up
later and put your project at risk.
When you and the team have completed all project work, you’re ready to
announce project completion, deliver it to your user/customer and begin the project
close-out phase. We’ll discuss project close-out in Chapter 12 after discussing a few
more technical ways to measure project progress and ways to troubleshoot common
project problems in Chapter 11.

Initiating Project Work
 Initiate project work with an announcement that project work is underway.
 Hold a team meeting to ensure team members understand project
processes, procedures, and next steps.

Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

 Regularly monitor project status and progress through team meetings, status
reports, and bug tracking and issue logs.
 Capture and share lessons learned as you go along to help avoid common
errors or pitfalls along the way.
Monitoring Project Progress
 Status reports and team meetings give you a good view into the project
progress.
 The issues log should be used to manage issues that arise.Assign every issue
a priority, an owner, and due date so issues actually do get resolved.
 Progress can be recorded as percent complete, but percent complete for
progress, time, and cost should be measured to give a more balanced view.
 Variance can be measured as the difference between what was planned and
actual results. Large positive or negative variances should be ﬂags that you
investigate.
 Large variances can cause a project to be cancelled.
Managing Project Change
 Variance is a change to the project and should be managed as such.
 You have four possible responses to variance: do nothing, repair the
problem, change the project plan, or terminate the project.
 Changes to the schedule can often be accommodated via the schedule
reserve. Larger changes may require you to crash the schedule or fast track
the schedule.
 Crashing and fast tracking both come with inherent risks that should be
understood and evaluated prior to implementing either of these methods.
 Changes to budgets stem from four primary causes: ﬂawed estimates,
anomalies, permanent variance, and minor variance.
 Changes to budgets can sometimes be accounted for via the budget reserve.
Other times the change must be listed as a separate line item and dealt with
separately.

 Drastic changes to schedules or budgets can cause the project to be
terminated if the changes cannot be accommodated or if those changes
make the project undesirable.
 Changes to scope often sneak in and cause scope creep. Using standard
project procedures including change management procedures, you can
manage scope during project work.
 Your change management procedures should allow you the ability to deal
with changes that stem from the four primary sources: errors/omissions,
risk response (implementing “Plan B”), value-added, and external events.
Managing Project Risk
 Review your project’s risk management plan at the outset of project work.
It might have to be revised as project work progresses due to new or
changing risks.
 Include milestones in your project plan for places where you want to
review your risk plan or places where risk might occur.
 Evaluate “Plan B” before implementing it. Look for secondary risks the
contingency plan might inject into your project.
 All change carries risk and all risk mitigation techniques carry the
possibility of secondary risk.You cannot plan for all risk, but looking for
risks will help you avoid many of the obvious ones.
 As project work progresses, risks can change and shift. Keep an eye out for
new risks resulting from other changes in the project and update your risk
management plan as needed.
Managing the Project Team
 Successfully managing people is key to managing an IT project. Hone your
people management skills for greater project success.
 In order for team members to accomplish their work, they must understand
what is required, have the time, tools, and talent to accomplish the work,
and must be motivated to do the work.
 Team members must be given the information, responsibility, and authority
to complete their work.

Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

 Deal with team performance, quality, or attitude problems quickly and
effectively.These kinds of problems rarely go away on their own and they
typically just get bigger and more complicated over time.
 Use your manger, project sponsor, and Human Resources department as
resources to assist you in managing your team.
 Managing a team over whom you have little direct or organization
authority can be challenging, but by focusing on creating a positive,
productive environment, your team and your project will fare better.
Q: In our company, our issues log discussions run on and on and I just want to run
from the room.Any suggestions on how to deal with this?
A: Issues log management can be tricky because you’re dealing with issues that have
come up that are unexpected. If they were expected, they would have been
planned into the project (assuming you planned your project).This often makes
people nervous because sometimes the issues log is viewed as a scorecard as to
how many issues cropped up in one area or another. When people get nervous
or defensive, long discussions can ensue as people try to cover tracks or explain
away problems.The best defense in this case is a good offense.The key is to
focus on the outcomes. Issues log discussions often devolve into theoretical dis-
cussions or discussions of issues tangential to the core problem. Keep focused on
the issue and the outcome. Don’t allow discussion to get off course. If an issue
cannot be quickly resolved (you could set a 5 minute timer, if needed), table it
and move on.Tabled issues might require additional, separate meetings for review
and resolution so that the issues log review doesn’t become a painful and unpro-
ductive experience. If you’re not in charge of the meeting, you might gently
suggest this method to the meeting leader as a way to perhaps make more pro-
ductive use of people’s time.

Frequently Asked Questions
The following Frequently Asked Questions, answered by the author of this book,

Q: It seems that even though we plan for various risks, they always seem to sneak
up on us anyway. What can we do to avoid this?
A: It’s hard to keep your eye on so many moving parts, so it’s understandable that
some things might be overlooked. However, project management is a process
that is intended to reduce errors and omissions, and you can create better project
management practices to help avoid this problem. In your case, you’ve done a
great job identifying project risks, but then no one manages the risk plan.Two
possible solutions come immediately to mind (if you think of others after
reading this, that’s ﬁne too).The ﬁrst is that you can delegate the task of
watching the risk management plan to someone on your IT project team who
would do a good job at that task. Sometimes just delegating some of these tasks
is all that it takes to keep better control of your project since there is only so
much you, as the IT project manager, can do. Second is to add milestones to
your project at the point where you’ve identiﬁed triggers. If one of your project
risks is that a vendor might ship parts late, you should add a milestone (check-
point) for the point at which you need to check vendor lead time, another mile-
stone for the point at which you need to order from the vendor, another
milestone at the point the vendor should ship, and another milestone at the
point where you would implement your contingency plan. While that may seem
like a lot of milestones to add for one risk, it will help you easily manage your
project’s risks as you manage your overall plan.
Q: You didn’t discuss Earned Value Analysis and it’s my opinion that percent com-
plete or variance are relatively useless measurements.Any comment?
A: Yes, we’ll discuss EVA in Chapter 11 for those that require a more technical
analysis of project progress. While percent complete and variance can be some-
what subjective, they are useful tools in many projects that do not require more
rigorous methods of evaluating project progress.
Q: It seems that in every IT project, our scope gets out of hand before we know
what hit us.Typically, we get requests from all sides—users, managers, the project
sponsor, even executives—and we really don’t have a choice to say “no.” What
can we do to better manage this?
A: Sounds like you have a bad case of scope creep. Fortunately, there is a cure,
though in your case it might be a slow process.The key is to educate everyone
about the impact of scope creep.You might start by reviewing past projects.
Compare actual results to planned results and calculate how much extra time and
money these projects cost. If possible, compare the desired (deﬁned, planned)
www.syngress.com
454
Chapter 10 • Managing IT Projects

quality to the actual quality. Somewhere in those historical results is the answer
you’re looking for.You will likely ﬁnd that the cost always goes through the roof
or your team never meets deadlines or your project results are viewed as having
poor quality. Since you now understand the relationship between scope, time,
cost, and quality, you’ll need to educate your executives and managers about this
and work with them to understand and utilize your change management pro-
cess. It also seems there may be challenges to your project deﬁnition early on. If
your projects are not addressing user/customer, business, and executive needs,
they will be pushed around. If they were well-deﬁned and your company simply
deals with frequent change, you should become a bit more forceful (if possible)
in implementing and managing your change control process. Educate everyone
about how, when, and why change will be considered, evaluated, and imple-
mented. Help them understand what change does to the project and help deter-
mine appropriate priorities. It’s possible that your ﬁrm is comfortable with a
project being over budget, delivered late, or having less-than-desired quality, but
once you explain how you can do a better job for less money and in less time,
you might catch a few people’s attention.
Q: I am really not comfortable dealing with people. I thought being an IT project
manager would let me manage projects.
A: I’m assuming the question in there is that you’re not sure what to do now that
you’ve discovered that managing IT projects is really more about managing
people than managing technology. For you, the excitement and satisfaction may
come from the deﬁnition of the project including the functional and technical
speciﬁcations, perhaps creating the WBS and the tasks. In that case, you might be
better off working on the team as a subject matter expert than as the IT PM. If
you’re interested in improving your people skills, a project can be a great way to
do that. Sit down and talk with someone who’s known to be a solid project
manager and talk with him or her about techniques you can use to manage your
team. Managing people is a skill you can learn, especially if you continually focus
on the desired outcome, but if you really don’t like working with people, you’re
always going to ﬁnd being an IT project manager a bit of an uncomfortable
challenge.

Introduction
In Chapter 10, we discussed how to manage your project once work gets underway.
Monitoring and measuring project performance can be a challenge, especially if you
use percent complete or other less technical measurements. We’ve all been involved in
at least one project where everything seemed to be rolling along in the “green” zone
and a week or two before project completion, all hell broke loose and the project
suddenly was in the “red” zone. How do these things happen? Depending on
whether you’re in an optimistic or pessimistic mood, your assessment of the percent
complete can change in part because percent complete is a judgement call. In this
chapter, we’re going to review a few more technical approaches to measuring project
progress. Even if you don’t plan on using them, you might ﬁnd it useful to read
through the material.You might be surprised to ﬁnd that these are measurements
you understand and could easily implement. If you choose not to read through the
more technical measurements, skip to the middle of the chapter and pick up reading
where we discuss common project problems and their solutions. Understanding and
resolving project problems is part of keeping your project on track so you’ll ﬁnd
helpful information in this section. It’s not meant to be the deﬁnitive list of potential
project problems—every project is unique (by its very deﬁnition) and every project
will encounter different problems. However, there are commonly occurring themes
and these tend to crop up frequently. Being prepared for the common problems can
be seen as part of your risk management strategy. Plan for the common problems
and respond to the uncommon problems.You’ll sleep better at night having some of
these strategies in your back pocket.
As in previous chapters, let’s look at where we are in our IT project manage-
ment process. Figure 11.1 shows tracking as the last step before project close-out,
discussed in Chapter 12.

■
Actual Cost The actual cost of all the work you completed.
■
Cost Performance Index (CPI)  The ratio of the cost of work accom-
plished compared to the cost of work planned.A positive value indicates
the project is under budget, a zero value indicates the project is on budget,
a negative value indicates the project is over budget.

■
Critical Ratio The critical ratio (CR) is found by multiplying the
schedule performance index (SPI) by the cost performance index (CPI). If
the project is proceeding according to plan, the CR should be at or near 1.
Any number above 1 indicates the project is making better than planned
progress.Any number below one indicates the project is falling behind.
■
Earned Value The planned cost of all work you have completed.
■
Earned Value Analysis  The analysis of the earned value of a project to
indicate current project status and to forecast future project status.
■
Planned Value The planned cost of all work you expected to complete.
■
Schedule Performance Index (SPI) The ratio of work accomplished
compared to the work planned.A positive value indicates the project is
ahead of schedule, a zero value indicates the project is on schedule, a nega-
tive value indicates the project is behind schedule.
Tracking the project to maintain control, taking corrective action based on
tracking data, and resolving common project problems are all part of managing the IT
project, but are discussed separately in this chapter in order to clearly focus on these
aspects of IT project management. For some IT projects, using a simple percent com-
plete or variance reporting will be sufﬁcient; for other IT projects, more detailed
tracking and analysis is required and we’ll cover these techniques in this chapter.
Figure 11.2 shows the inputs, actions, checkpoints, and outputs from this stage of
the project lifecycle. It is the same diagram used in Chapter 10 since the tracking
and control steps occur during the management phase of the project.

Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

Figure 11.2 Inputs, Actions, and Outputs for Project Management Step
The discrete steps are delineated in Chapter 10, but it is important to note the
project management process includes implementing the project, monitoring and
tracking the results, and taking appropriate corrective action in an iterative manner
until all project work has been successfully completed. In this chapter, we’ll look at
steps involved in tracking and controlling the project as well as the steps for
preparing for ﬁnal project deliverables and close-out.
Technical Tracking Tools
Percent complete and variance reporting may be all you need to track and manage
your project. In some cases, though, you may want or need more detailed views of
project progress.There are numerous metrics you can utilize for measuring project
progress including earned value analysis, schedule performance, schedule perfor-
mance index, cost performance, cost performance index, estimate at completion, and
critical ratio.All of these metrics measure planned outcomes to actual outcomes at
speciﬁc points in time to reveal data about progress as well as to help you forecast
project results based on current trends.These metrics can be intimidating, even to
experienced project managers, but in truth, they are simple mathematical calcula-
tions.The challenge with these metrics is often in collecting the data rather than in

crunching the numbers. Many project management information systems, such as
Microsoft Project, will calculate some of these numbers for you. Of course, you have
to enter the correct data and keep it up to date as the project progresses in order to
get any meaningful data about performance.
IT projects fall into two basic categories, roughly grouped as physical- or knowl-
edge-based. Physical projects are those that involve running cables, upgrading servers,
installing applications, etc. Knowledge projects are those that involve working on a
more intangible level with information and knowledge, such as creating a new pro-
cess or a new application. Clearly, physical projects have knowledge components and
knowledge projects may have physical components.The key is that it is usually easier
to track physical projects than knowledge projects. If the project is to upgrade 15
servers or transition the company from traditional phones to voice over IP (VoIP)
phones, there are many physical elements that can be easily tracked.Tracking these
physical elements usually gives you a fairly clear view of how the project is going. If
the project is less tangible - for example, developing a new software application—it
can be hard to know in advance how many lines of code it’s going to take or how
long it will take to complete each phase.You may be able to break a knowledge pro-
ject down into manageable stages so that each segment of completed code can be
measured, but it’s usually a less exact science than managing a physical project.
Does that mean you should not attempt to track the progress of a knowledge-
based project? No. It means that it is a more inexact science and you’ll need to rely
upon your team’s collective knowledge and expertise to have a feel for how things
are really going. If you recall from Chapter 10, knowledge work typically follows a
curve that might lead you to believe things are falling behind early in the project
when, in fact, they are right on target. Keeping an eye on both the actual project
work and the technical metrics we’ll discuss in this section can help you ﬁne-tune
project work to ensure it completes on time, on budget, and with the required func-
tionality and features.
Earned Value Analysis
Some people hear the term Earned Value Analysis, or EVA, and run screaming from
the room. Many experienced project managers still avoid using EVA because they
never learned it, never understood how it could beneﬁt them, or never got a chance
to try it out. Whatever the case, take a few minutes to read through this material—
especially if you have avoided EVA with every ounce of your being.You may be sur-
prised to ﬁnd it less daunting and more useful than you thought.
Earned Value Analysis is a method of assessing project progress.The Project
Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) deﬁnes earned value as the value of
www.syngress.com
462
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

the work that has been completed based on the budget for that work.Therefore, an
EVA would be an analysis of the work that’s been completed compared to the
budget for that work. EVA also includes another important element, one we dis-
cussed in some detail in Chapter 10—scope. By integrating scope along with time
and cost, you gain a more objective, scalable point-in-time assessment of project
progress. EVA is not only useful in assessing the current state of the project, but for
forecasting the likely state of the project as you move out in time.Think of it like
this: if you start out on a 3,000 mile road trip and you’ve decided to navigate solely
by compass, a variation of 5 or 10 miles away from your primary direction may not
mean much on day one or day two, but by the end of your trip, you’re going to be
so far off course that it will take a monumental effort to correct it. EVA is like your
project compass in helping you to determine how far off course your project at
completion may be based on how far off course it is at the moment.To state that
more positively, it can show you how close you’ll come to your targets based on
where you are today.
Components of EVA
Earned Value Analysis asks three critical questions to assess project progress:
1.
How much work did you plan on completing? (Planned Value)
2.
How much work did you actually complete? (Earned Value)
3.
How much did it cost to complete that work? (Actual Cost)
Planned Value (PV) is budgeted cost of work you expected to start and ﬁnish at
a particular point in time. It is the cumulative cost of all planned work to a particular
point in time in your project. Earned Value (EV) on the other hand, it the sum of all
budgeted costs for tasks completed at this point in time.Actual Cost (AC) is the
actual cost of all completed work at this point in time.
www.syngress.com
Tracking IT Projects • Chapter 11
463

Enterprise 128 …
Alphabet Soup
One of the reasons people shy away from EVA is that it uses a lot of letters in for-
mulas and the letters don’t really help you remember what’s what. If you’re
going to use EVA, make sure you understand the difference between PV, EV, and
AC. If you don’t understand them and use them correctly, your data will be way
off and you’ll be reporting incorrect information. At that point, you’re better off
reverting to percent complete. EVA is used for a particular point in time, so all
the metrics you use have the same time span: start to the selected point in time.
■
Planned Value is the planned cost of all work you expected to com-
plete.
■
Earned Value is the planned cost of all work you did complete.
■
Actual Cost is the actual cost of all the work you did complete.
Keep these straight and your EVA will be right on target.
Applying Earned Value Analysis
Let’s walk through an example so you can see how EVA can help you assess the pro-
ject. Let’s assume you’re working on a small eight-week project that is estimated to
cost $80,000. Let’s keep this simple and say that you have eight tasks, each scheduled
to be one week long and costing $10,000.At the midway point of the project, you
want to assess where you are.You know that you are at the midpoint of the project,
so if everything is on track, you would expect to see that you have 50% of the work
completed and 50% of the costs incurred.Three of eight examples are present in this
example.
To calculate the Planned Value, you have to add up the planned cost of all work
you expected to complete to date. Figure 11.3 shows the formula for calculating PV.
Using the formula, we can see that PV = 50% x $80,000. In our scenario, the PV is
$40,000.You can only calculate the cost of the work you planned on accomplishing
by the particular point in time (ours is the 50% point) if you know the planned cost
of each task or work package (which you should have in your budget).
www.syngress.com
464
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

Figure 11.3 Calculating Planned Value
To calculate the Earned Value, you have to add up the value of all planned work
that has actually been accomplished at this point in time.The EV formula is shown
in Figure 11.4. Don’t confuse EV with actual cost. EV is the planned cost for all work
completed at this point in time. Our actual work complete is 37.5% (three of eight
equal tasks completed, for this simpliﬁed example). So, our formula is EV = 37.5% x
$80,000.The EV of this project at this point in time is $30,000. Notice that if you
just added up those three completed tasks’ costs, the result is the same as when we
use the EV formula.This should help you grok the formula a bit better.
Figure 11.4 Calculating Earned Value
Next, we need the Actual Cost. Let’s say that the actual cost for these three tasks
comes to $38,000. OK, we now have our three metrics, it’s time to put them to use.
First, we can calculate the cost variance for the project. Figure 11.5 shows the for-
mula for determining the cost variance. We can now calculate that our cost variance
is CV = $30,000 - $38,000 or CV = - $8,000.This indicates that we are $8,000
over budget at this point in time.
Figure 11.5 Calculating Cost Variance
Next, we need to calculate the schedule variance to determine how we’re
tracking with our schedule.This formula is shown in Figure 11.6. Using the formula
SV = EV—PV, we can calculate that SV = $30,000 - $40,000 or SV = -$10,000.
You might ask how -$10,000 indicates a schedule variance and that’s a good ques-
tion. Using EVA, you look at your schedule in terms of the planned or actual cost of

EV = Actual % Complete x Total Project Budget
Cost Variance = Earned Value - Actual Cost

work. So, in this scenario, we have a $8,000 cost variance and a -$10,000 schedule
variance.That means that your project is both over budget and behind schedule. In a
relative sense, you are more behind schedule that you are over budget because your
schedule variance is larger (even though negative) than your cost variance.
Figure 11.6 Calculating Schedule Variance
Your goal is to have a zero or positive variance for both cost and schedule.Any
negative number indicates a problem. Of course, the larger the negative number, the
bigger the problem and the more attention you’ll need to give to ﬁguring out what’s
going wrong.
The IT Factor…
EVA the PMBOK Way
The Project Management Institute, a non-proﬁt organization dedicated to
advancing methods of project management, publishes the Project Management
Body of Knowledge, referred to as the PMBOK (sometimes pronounced pim-bok).
In the PMBOK method, the calculations are the same, they just use more letters.
Our system uses the old PMBOK lettering system, but does exactly the same cal-
culations. For the record, the current PMBOK uses:
■
BCWS—Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (equates to our PV).
■
BCWP—Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (equates to our EV).
■
ACWP—Actual Cost of Work Performed (equates to our AC).
Studies have repeatedly shown that people can remember up to three
things at a time, which is why we stuck to the two-letter acronyms rather than
using the PMI’s four-letter acronyms. If you’re studying for your PMP or CAPM
certiﬁcation, be sure to review the PMBOK for the latest changes and termi-
nology. The intent of this chapter is not to help you pass a certiﬁcation exam, but
to understand and apply the concepts presented.

Schedule Variance = Earned Value - Planned Value

Schedule Performance Index
We all know that IT projects rarely just hum along smoothly.There are always
bumps in the road and understanding how you’re performing against schedule is one
of the things an IT PM needs to know.A recent survey of CIOs indicated that only
about 10% of important IT initiatives came in both on time and on budget. Of
those initiatives, about 50% were able to deliver on schedule or budget, but not
both.The success rates we discussed at the beginning of this book clearly hold true
and it seems as if project success is still an elusive goal.As you know, the longer a
project runs, the less likely it is to be successful, especially as needed resources are
siphoned off to be used elsewhere.The schedule performance index is a good tool to
use to help you see your schedule trend as positive, negative, or neutral.The formula
for calculating SPI is shown in Figure 11.7. In our example, SPI = $30,000 (EV) /
$40,000 (PV) or SPI = 0.75.
Because the SPI (and later, the CPI) are ratios, the perfect point to be at is 1. SPI
will equal 1 when the earned value and planned value are the same ($40,000 divided
by $40,000 is 1 and that would indicate the project is right on schedule).Any
number greater than 1 indicates the project is ahead of schedule.Any number less
than 1 indicates the project is behind schedule. Of course, the further the SPI is from
1 on the down side, the bigger the problem you have. Remember, though, some-
times a large positive variance (an SPI of 1.9 or 2.5 for instance) could indicate
problems as well, so keep an eye on all large variances on either side of 1.
Based on our calculation, how far off schedule are we? Well, we’re about 25%
behind schedule based on an SPI of .75. Is this good or bad? Well, it depends on
whether your schedule is your least ﬂexible project parameter and whether you can
pull in extra resources to get the work done on time or perhaps there’s simply a
learning curve in the ﬁrst half of the project and you’re conﬁdent you can make up
that time simply because you’re at the top of the learning curve (meaning the team
or people performing the work have learned just about as much as can or should be
learned at this point, and will make fast progress from here on out).

Figure 11.7 Calculating Schedule Performance Index
Using Schedule Reserves
If you are behind schedule, you can choose to use some of your schedule reserve.
Using schedule reserve can be done in a number of ways, but often it means that
you make a “withdrawal” from your reserve and update your project plan. For
instance, if you determine that your project is about three days behind schedule, you
can reduce your schedule reserve by three days and update your project plan to indi-
cate it is now “on schedule.” If you look at your schedule performance in another
month and everything is perfectly on time, your schedule indicators will reﬂect the
project as being on time rather than still three days behind because you used some
of your project reserve to address this one-time event.
The use of schedule reserve in this manner prevents you from “dragging along” a
slip in the schedule throughout the remainder of the project.At project close out,
you can compare actual to planned and include use of your reserves in your analysis.
Cost Performance Index
The cost performance index is the same type of ratio as SPI, only it tracks your
progress against budget.The formula is similar to SPI and is shown in Figure 11.8.To
calculate our CPI for this sample project, we insert the relevant values so that our
CPI = EV/AC or $30,000 / $38,000 or CPI = 0.789.As with our SPI, a value of 1
means we’re spot on, a value greater than one indicates we’re below budget (doing
better than budget), and a value less than one indicates we’re above budget (doing
worse than budget). In this case, we’re under 1, which means we’re over budget.Also
similar to SPI, the relative size of the number should be considered when evaluating
the CPI. If we were at 0.38, we’d be performing far worse against budget than if we
were at 0.789. Of course, to have a CPI of 1.14 would be wonderful, but a CPI of
4.2 should set off a few alarm bells.

Schedule Performance Index = Earned Value / Planned Value
SPI = EV/ PV

Figure 11.8 Calculating Cost Performance Index
Using Budget Reserves
Just as with schedule, you can choose to use budget reserves to adjust your project’s
budget. If you are $8,000 over budget, you can “withdraw” or deduct $8,000 from
your project’s reserve amount and apply it to your budget. Now when you calculate
performance against budget, you’ll be calculating it against the budget plus the addi-
tional reserve amount. Essentially, adding your reserve amount at this point brings
you back to a CPI of 1. Doing this allows you to accurately see the progress of
future project work without constantly having to reference the deﬁcit created to this
point in time. So, if you are at the halfway point in your project and you’re behind
budget (or schedule), you can use reserve amounts to get you back to even.Then, if
you calculate your progress at the 75% mark, you can tell how the work between the
50% and the 75% mark is progressing. If you don’t use reserve amounts and you’re
gaining or losing ground, it might be difﬁcult to determine how this segment of
work is going versus earlier segments of work.You can certainly calculate all these
ﬁgures for various points in time—you could choose to calculate the values for just
the work from 50% to 75% and do the same calculation. It’s mostly a matter of pref-
erence as to how you approach these calculations.As long as you understand that
you “drag along” past deﬁcits (or gains) into your current point in time, you can
manage these numbers in whatever way makes the most sense to you.
Estimate At Completion
Now that we’ve calculated our schedule and cost performance, it would probably be
helpful to understand our trends. If things continue as they are, how far behind
schedule will we be? How much over budget will we be? To determine that, we need
to calculate estimate at completion, or EAC.The EAC is a pretty simple calculation
that is shown in Figure 11.9.The EAC is determined by taking the total planned pro-
ject budget (BAC) and dividing it by the cost performance index. In the example
we’ve been using, EAC = $80,000 / 0.789 or EAC = $101,394.This means that the
project will come in about $21,000 over budget if the trend remains the same.This
calculation should be done prior to adjusting values using reserves so you can identify
potential trends.

Figure 11.9 Calculating Estimate At Completion
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
As you can see, these calculations are a bit more precise than percent
complete or even variance. They can be used to give you a very clear pic-
ture of what’s going on in your project. We can manage what we can
see, so having this type of visibility into project performance can be
incredibly helpful.
One of the most valuable aspects of these numbers is understanding,
relative to perfect performance, how your project is performing against
time and cost. The EAC is a great tool for understanding how much your
budget variance will impact your ﬁnal cost. Often when a project starts
running over budget, a manager or executive will demand, “How much
will this cost when it’s all said and done?” Using these values, you can
project a ﬁnal cost based on the trend and make an informed decision
about moving forward on the project (or not). One potential pitfall to
watch for is that EAC will project your problems into the future because
it will use the current trend to forecast the future. If you have a one-
time event that impacts your budget, pull from your reserve amount,
recalculate then calculate your EAC to get a more realistic view of the
likely cost at completion. If you don’t make this adjustment, the EAC cal-
culation will assume your current run rate will continue into the future
and that may not always be accurate.
Critical Ratio
Now that you’ve calculated all kinds of numbers to help you track your IT project’s
progress, you can calculate one ﬁnal ratio that gives you an overall view of the pro-
ject.You might choose to calculate this number on a periodic basis and chart it to
give senior management a single point of reference for project progress.The critical
ratio (CR) is derived by multiplying the cost performance index (CPI) by the
schedule performance index (SPI), as shown in Figure 11.10.This ratio shows the

470
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects
Estimated At Completion = Project Budget / Cost Performance Index
EAC 
= BAC/ CPI 
* BAC = budget at completion or total planned project budget

overall progress of the project taking both cost and schedule into account.A ratio of
1 indicates the project is right on target; a ratio of greater than 1 indicates the pro-
ject is doing better than plan; a ratio of less than 1 indicates the project is falling
behind plan.
Keep in mind that it is possible to have your CPI less than one and your SPI
greater than 1, which could mathematically cause your CR to be equal to 1. If you
think about the implications of such a scenario, you realize that if your project is over
budget but ahead of schedule, your project progress is probably acceptable because
more than likely, the budget overruns are accounted for in the additional effort
expended to bring the project in ahead of schedule.The reverse is also true. If your
project is behind schedule but under budget, you might also have a CR of 1. In this
case, the budget hasn’t been expended because the work has not been done.This sce-
nario, however, could raise a ﬂag if you have a hard deadline or external constraint.
Figure 11.10 Critical Ratio
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
As an IT project manager, your job is to guide the project toward suc-
cess. While you’re mired in the details of the project, you still need to
communicate project progress to your project sponsor and sometimes to
corporate executives as well. To avoid sharing too much detailed infor-
mation or sharing information that is not helpful to decision makers, use
EVA, SPI, CPI, and CR to indicate project progress. By boiling the project
down to a few meaningful metrics, you’ll assure executives that the pro-
ject is on target (or provide them with remediation plans if it is falling
behind) without inundating them with project details. Providing too
much detail almost always invites micromanagement and to avoid that,
provide these high-level but accurate metrics.

Testing Project Deliverables
Without testing project deliverables, it would be impossible to know if your project
was on track or not. If the results of project work are not regularly reviewed and
tested, where appropriate, you may end up at the completion of your project with
deliverables that do not address the required project scope or fail to deliver required
functionality (quality or performance).Therefore, part of tracking project progress is
testing results of project work.
In some projects such as software development, testing may be a discrete func-
tion outside the project plan. For instance, at each delivery point, the project may
have a milestone indicating a deliverable is sent to testing.The project may also have
a second milestone indicating when results from testing will be reviewed so that
action can be taken.The action is usually binary—either proceed or revise. If revi-
sion is required, the project’s scope and speciﬁcations (functional and technical
requirements) should be reviewed to determine why there is a difference between
what was speciﬁed and what came through testing.
In some projects, the testing component is included in the project plan.This is
common in more physical-based projects such as upgrading infrastructure or
replacing servers, applications, or network components. In these cases, testing may
occur in a lab environment to ensure the required conﬁguration meets the project’s
speciﬁcations and works as intended. Once tested and approved in the lab environ-
ment, the solution may be implemented in the live setting and additional tests may
be conducted to ensure everything is still working as expected. In these cases, testing
tasks are built into the project plan and are conducted as project tasks.
Whether testing is part of the project plan or is part of an external project plan,
testing is critical to managing and controlling IT project progress.Thought it’s done
from time to time, it would be pretty risky to put everything together and imple-
ment the solution without testing results at periodic intervals during project work.
Often, pressure to get a product to market or into the hands of users forces IT pro-
ject managers to compress testing, which is unfortunate. Sound testing is part of
quality control. Remember from our earlier discussion on quality, the cost to ﬁx a
problem once the project’s deliverables are in the users/customers hands is 100 times
the cost of ﬁxing that problem in the design phase. If a problem is found in the unit
testing phase, the cost is only 10 times the cost of ﬁnding it in the design phase. If
the problem is found in the integration testing phase, the cost is 30 times the cost of
ﬁnding it in the design phase.As you can see, 10x or 30x is still far less expensive
than 100x. If you are the IT project manager and you’re being pushed to shorten or
even skip the testing phases of your project, you may want to pull out Chapter 7 and
explain to your project sponsor or corporate executives the costs (both direct and
www.syngress.com
472
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

indirect) of doing so.You might not win the battle, but you might ﬁnd a solution
that addresses both the management team’s and your concerns.At the very least,
your executive team and project sponsor can make an informed decision about
testing once you’ve laid out the costs and risks for them.
You and your IT project team should have developed a testing plan either as part
of your project processes in the organization or planning phases of your project, so
we won’t repeat that information here.There are numerous types of test plans and
testing that can occur in an IT project. In this section, we’ll look at the various types
of tests and discuss how the results impact this phase of the project lifecycle.
The result of any kind of testing should be a clear understanding of how well
your project’s deliverables are performing against requirements.Your test and quality
plans should clearly deﬁne the next steps for various types of results. For instance,
results that vary from speciﬁcations just a bit may be sent back through the project
work cycle to be ﬁxed, or they may be deferred (as may be the case in software
development projects). Results that vary signiﬁcantly from speciﬁcations may be
considered “show stoppers” and may cause project work to halt until the cause for
the variance is determined and corrected. Understanding the results of testing and
having plans for understanding and managing the results will help keep your project
on track. If you are unable to assess the results of your various testing plans as it per-
tains to overall project progress, your project is at risk. In that case, you should step
back and reassess your testing plans and assess what each test is designed to show and
what the results will tell you about the project.
Unit Testing
Unit testing is done throughout the project work phase.Testing can be done on
hardware, software, processes, and procedures throughout the project work cycle.
Results of unit testing are your ﬁrst indication of project progress. If deliverables at
this point fail unit testing, this should raise a ﬂag for you. If unit testing progresses
smoothly, your project deliverables are off to a good start.A unit test is a good way
to test a small portion of the deliverable early in the process. It is typically performed
by the person doing the work. If a technician is supposed to conﬁgure 18 new
servers, he or she should test each server to ensure the conﬁguration is correct and
works as expected.The work should not be considered complete until a unit test has
been performed. Unit testing can be speciﬁcally added to entry/exit criteria or com-
pletion criteria. It is reasonable to expect the unit testing has been completed before
the task owner designates the work as complete.

For example, suppose that you are having a house built and at the moment the
plumber is installing the water lines.You would have (and should have) a real expec-
tation that the plumber will have tested his work to make sure that there are no
leaks before saying the job (task) is complete.The same attitude belongs in your IT
project.
Integration Testing
Integration testing is the next logical step after unit testing. Integration takes your
unit deliverables and begins putting them together and testing how well these com-
ponents interact. It could be a situation where you have tested several disk drives and
are now testing them in a RAID system or as a cluster. It could be where you take
several segments of code related to the user interface and test them together to see
how they work.These tests are usually referred to as functional or black box tests,
meaning that the tester is not going through component by component or line by
line looking at the internal functionality, but is looking at inputs and outputs only. In
a hardware project (or physical project), the integration testing may overlap with
implementation and deployment phases.
Usability Testing
Usability testing is done in a controlled environment to ensure that the project
results can be used in the real world.These tests may involve bringing select users
into a lab or test environment to use the project’s results in order to see how the
user will interact with the product.The results of this type of testing can help an IT
project team reﬁne the project’s deliverables and can also be used as input to perfor-
mance test plans. Usability testing is important to ensure the product is usable, but it
should not be utilized in lieu of sound functional and technical speciﬁcations. Fixing
usability issues once project work is underway is 10 to 30 times more expensive than
creating excellent speciﬁcations early in the project cycle.That said, if there was an
error or omission made in the project deﬁnition phase, it is easier to ﬁx it after
reviewing usability test results than once the product is in the user’s hands.
Acceptance Testing
Acceptance testing is usually the ﬁnal phase of most quality assurance processes.
Acceptance testing may be performed in-house by testers or project team members
to verify that the required features and functionality work as speciﬁed. In other cases,
www.syngress.com
474
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

acceptance testing is done by a group of users to verify that the features and func-
tionality work as they expect it to.Acceptance testing should be well deﬁned going
into the project because users have a habit of forgetting what they speciﬁed at some
point in the past. IT projects can run from several weeks to several years and users
may forget, change their minds, or leave altogether.Therefore, it is critical that accep-
tance procedures be clearly delineated and agreed to by the user/customer before
the project commences. In some cases, you will need to modify the project accep-
tance testing plan or criteria (based on required changes to the project over time). In
all cases, though, the acceptance criteria and test plans should be clearly delineated
and agreed to by the user/customer to avoid end-of-project disagreements about
what is and is not acceptable.
The result of this type of testing is the assurance (either by internal staff or by
external customers) that the project results are suitable for use in the real world and
that it performs as expected. Sometimes acceptance testing is combined with beta
testing.Acceptance testing is often tied to payment when the project is for a client.
Beta Testing
Beta testing is a limited release of the project’s deliverables to a selected group of
users. Often the beta test group includes knowledgeable or expert testers who will
use the project’s product as users would. In the case of hardware projects, beta testing
may come after a limited rollout of the project’s results before implementing across
the enterprise.The results of beta testing may result in project rework, but it may
also result in notes for future releases. Most beta testing plans provide some deﬁni-
tion or description of different levels of problems or bugs found during the beta
testing process, as described earlier. Bugs or defects classiﬁed as show stoppers can
impact your ﬁnal delivery date and should be investigated thoroughly.Those bugs or
defects classiﬁed with lower priorities will generally be put back in the work
pipeline for repair during the normal project cycle. Some bugs or defects may be
deferred to later project phases or later releases.
Regression Testing
Once errors and defects are found, rework should address the problems.At this
point, the revised project work is again tested to ensure that the changes made to ﬁx
the defect did not introduce new problems. If you recall from our discussion of pro-
ject risk, making a change to the project in order to address a risk often introduces
secondary risk.The same is true in the project work itself.Any revision to address a
problem or defect has the possibility of introducing new problems or defects into the
www.syngress.com
Tracking IT Projects • Chapter 11
475

project. Regression testing is used to verify that the identiﬁed problems have been
ﬁxed and that no new problems have been introduced.
Performance Testing
Performance testing can take many different forms. For instance, you can perform
stress or load testing to see how a component performs in actual use.This is often
done on hardware components to ensure that a disk drive or server can handle the
load that will be placed on it once in production.This can also be performed on soft-
ware components such as stress or load testing a database application to ensure that it
will perform fast enough when 100 users are requesting data from the database.The
four main types of performance tests are stress, load, stability, and reliability.
Stress and Load Testing
Stress testing attempts to replicate the stress placed on the system (hardware or soft-
ware) once it’s in a production environment. Load testing is a form of stress testing
that places various loads on the system (read requests on the disk drive, login
requests on the server, calculation requests on an application, for instance) to ensure
that it can perform under pressure. Many systems look great on paper and look ﬁne
in development, but come to a screeching halt when placed under a realistic load. If
a database application takes 10 minutes to return a simple query, users are not going
to be happy and stress and load testing can begin to help you identify problems
before you put the project’s deliverables in the hands of users.
Stress and load testing can sometimes be accomplished as unit tests during the
work phase of the project. Other times, stress and load tests require a more inte-
grated approach and are performed as project work nears completion.
Stability and Reliability Testing
Stability and reliability tests are generally run on fully integrated systems to ensure
that they don’t crash or halt intermittently over time.These types of tests are stress
and load tests performed over a longer period of time, typically days or weeks, and
sometimes months. For instance, problems with database applications may only show
up after a period of time. Memory leaks in an application or problems with partic-
ular locations in physical memory may only show up after an extended period of
time. Problems with heat can impact hardware components over a period of time
and those problems might not show up if a stress or load test is run for just a few
hours.This type of testing can also include a “test to fail” process where the system is
intentionally placed under load until it fails to determine the actual stress or load
www.syngress.com
476
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

limits. It also helps to determine how to recover from the damage caused when the
failure occurs and steps that can be taken to make the crash a bit more graceful.
Stability and reliability testing are sometimes performed in parallel or in con-
junction with beta testing.These types of tests are performed on the integrated
results of the project and are therefore performed during the latter stages of the pro-
ject work cycle.
Benchmark Testing
Benchmark testing, or benchmarking, is the process of testing hardware or software
against speciﬁc performance standards.This testing can be performed during unit and
integration testing. If you are installing new network cable, you might unit test the
cable to ensure it can carry the volume of trafﬁc its speciﬁcation indicate (to verify the
speciﬁcation and the cable are correct) and you might also test it in the test or produc-
tion environment to again verify it is performing according to speciﬁcations. In the
realm of software development, you might unit test to make sure that a procedure call
actually works as speciﬁed and you might again test in an integrated test environment
to ensure the application runs quickly and delivers the results as expected.A bench-
mark can be used to deﬁne the minimum standard of performance and can be
included in entry/exit criteria, completion criteria, and quality metrics.
Security Testing
In today’s environment, security testing should be part of just about every IT pro-
ject. Security testing should cover two key areas: that the project deliverables meet
security requirements and that if attacked, the system(s) can handle it gracefully. If a
security problem does crop up, you want your hardware and software to deal with it
intelligently. For instance, some database errors can give hackers additional informa-
tion needed to continue penetrating the system. By forcing errors, hackers learn
more about the design of the database and learn better how to inﬁltrate the system.
These are the kinds of problems that can be discovered through security testing so
that if a hacker does force an error, the error does not provide additional informa-
tion for hackers.That’s an example of a system handling an attack gracefully rather
than laying out the welcome mat for intruders.
Many third-party companies specialize in testing security for companies and this
might be something worth considering, especially if security is paramount to your
particular IT project. Often internal “group think” sets in, which means everyone
approaches the project from the same perspective. When this happens, it can be difﬁ-
cult (or impossible) to identify potential security problems. Sourcing this to an
external ﬁrm can help overcome a sometimes myopic approach to security testing.

Cheat Sheet…
Security versus Usability
Being impervious to attacks can sometimes be impossible and there is a balance
between security and usability that must be achieved. The most secure network (or
application) is one that is not connected to the Internet and does not allow user
access. Not a very useful network, but very secure. Your IT project may need to take
security elements into account, and if so, be sure to keep usability in mind. If you
require 28-letter complex passwords, users will simply write them down, defeating
the purpose of strong passwords. If you lock a system down so it is user-unfriendly,
users will either try to circumvent the system, stop using it, or become very frus-
trated. None of those scenarios is an indicator of project success.
Preparing for Implementation,
Deployment, and Operational Transfer
Your project is coming down the home stretch. Deliverables are coming out on
schedule, results are being tested and veriﬁed and everything looks good.A few
pieces of rework here and there, a couple of tweaks to the schedule and you can see
the home stretch in front of you. Now what?
One of the areas that some IT project managers overlook at this point are the
connections to external plans such as implementation, deployment, or operational
transfer. Depending on the nature of your project, you will have to contend with one
or more of these types of plans.As with testing, these plans are sometimes discrete
phases of your IT project plan and other times they are external plans tied to your IT
project. If they’re internal, you’re far more likely to manage them in terms of updating
the schedule and communicating key data such as delays, changes, or requirements.
When they’re external, these same elements can cause major issues. It’s important that
throughout your project you place milestones to remind you and the project team to
update or communicate information regarding these additional plans.
Implementation
In some IT projects, implementation is a phase of the IT project that describes how
the project’s deliverables will be implemented (this is sometimes the same as a deploy-
ment plan, depending on the IT project).This might describe a phased approach or an
www.syngress.com
478
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

“all or nothing” approach.The implementation plan may be discrete tasks within the
project plan that follow testing tasks. If a separate implementation plan exists, you
should have milestones within your IT project plan indicating points at which you
need to communicate about the implementation or points at which you need input
from the implementation team. Many IT project managers are good about keeping an
eye on implementation because that’s essentially where project success is deﬁned.
However, it’s easy to let critical information or important changes slip through the
communication cracks when it comes to implementation.A ﬂawless implementation
can greatly increase the perception of project success, so it’s important that your manage-
ment activities during this phase address implementation. In some cases, management
or oversight of the implementation phase can be delegated to a team member. Make
sure your implementation plan includes plans for a rollback in case things go wrong.A
clear roadmap for rolling back the implementation will help keep people cool, calm,
and collected if the going gets rough during implementation.
Cheat Sheet…
Delegating Project Management Tasks
During the work phase of the project, you’re mostly likely going to have your
hands full just keeping track of the issues and changes in the project and man-
aging the critical path tasks. Rather than taking on the world, you can delegate
portions of the management task to others. If you recall from our discussion ear-
lier in the book on managing high performance teams, many people on a team
ﬁnd satisfaction in gaining new experiences or skills, while others enjoy addi-
tional responsibility and authority. Delegating management of these end phases
such as implementation, deployment, or operational transfer, whether they’re
part of your formal IT project plan or part of external plans, can be just the
opportunity junior team members are looking for. Finding members of your pro-
ject team that would enjoy the tasks associated with managing these sub-plans
can provide a coveted opportunity for a team member while at the same time
ofﬂoading some of your management tasks. It’s a win-win situation that can help
build project management skills in your IT department. Word to the wise—dele-
gating means handing over responsibility and authority, but it doesn’t mean
handing it off and never thinking about it again. Allow others to do the job while
you check on progress occasionally and provide support and assistance as
needed.

Deployment
A deployment plan describes how the hardware or software will be installed, tested,
and turned over.This may be the same as an implementation plan in some projects.
In other projects, a deployment team is responsible for product deployment, whether
internally or externally.As with an implementation plan, the deployment plan should
be kept up to date with the IT project plan so that changes are reﬂected in these
plans. It’s not uncommon for a change to be made (especially during the testing
phase) that requires a change or update to the deployment plan. If this is not prop-
erly communicated, the deployment team will be unable to start or complete the
deployment in a timely and satisfactory manner.As with your implementation plan,
your deployment plan should include a discussion of potential risk as well as related
contingency plans.A rollback plan should be included in case deployment goes ter-
ribly wrong. In that case, the deployment team should have a clear cut plan for
rolling back to the last known good state.
Enterprise 128 …
Don’t Just Lob It Over the Fence
Sometimes an IT project team can be so exhilarated to complete a project and so
exhausted by the process that they almost lob it over the fence to the deploy-
ment team, which can cause all kinds of problems. A software development com-
pany (whose name is not used to protect both the guilty and the innocent) was
working on a major product release. When the code was complete and sent for
integration and regression testing to the test engineers, all the developers
rejoiced and decided it was a great time to take a break from all their hard work.
Friday noon rolled around and most of the senior developers packed up in a few
vehicles and took off for parts unknown for a no-e-mail, no-cell phone camping
trip….The only problem was that critical changes required for this customer
installation were not included in the ﬁnal released code. That meant the deploy-
ment team would be unable to install the released code on the customer’s
machines. The deployment team discovered this as they began to create their
installation disks for the customer, around 1:00 P.M. that Friday. With most of the
developers gone, the deployment team had to scramble. They pulled together a
few of the software engineers who’d not gone camping along with one of the
senior testers. They cobbled together an installation CD that would work so the
deployment team could jump on an airplane Sunday afternoon. It took all Friday

Continued

night, all Saturday and part of Sunday morning to ﬁx the problems, but the
deployment team’s dedication to making this beta deployment a success made
all the difference. Ultimately, the deployment team had to perform some tricky
on-site changes and install an overlay to the code to get everything set for the
customer.
Lesson Learned: Don’t assume because tasks or code is complete that
everything is just ﬁne. Make sure that your implementation or deployment teams
have what they need to get the job done. After all, the project isn’t complete
until the user has signed off on it and implementation or deployment is that crit-
ical link between code complete and a satisﬁed user.
Operational Transfer
Operational transfer is the process of handing off the project’s deliverables to the user
on a permanent basis (sometimes referred to as project cut over). It assumes that the
implementation or deployment has been successful and that you and the IT project
team are ready to pass ongoing management of the project’s deliverables to another
team or to the user/customer.
The operational transfer plan is a document that describes how the deliverables
of the project will be integrated and managed.The goal is to have a smooth, seamless
transfer of the project’s deliverable to the permanent team that has responsibility for
this on an ongoing basis. It is used to help deﬁne the people and processes needed in
the functional arena to ensure success. Remember that how well the project is
handed off is a large part of user and stakeholder perception about the success of the
project, so mistakes here will impact the perception of success even if the project
meets or exceeds all other expectations.
An operational transfer plan should include:
■
Tasks to hand off the project’s deliverables
■
The strategy to be used during handoff
■
The key resources needed
■
Task owners
■
Timing of transfer tasks
■
Cost of transfer tasks
■
Schedule for transfer
■
Risks and contingency plans for risk
■
Formal acceptance of handoff by customer/client/user

If this list looks familiar, that’s good. It is a scaled down version of a project plan.
In fact, you could use the entire IT project management methodology described in
this book to create an optimized operational transfer plan.Though many organiza-
tions do not do so, there are clear beneﬁts to stepping back and starting at the
beginning. What is the problem to be solved? What is the mission or objective?
What are the potential solutions? What are the criteria for selecting the best solu-
tion? If you step through the IT project methodology we’ve discussed, you’ll ﬁnd
that you have a clear, concise, and easy-to-manage operational transfer plan. Many IT
project managers avoid going through the same IT project management process
described in this book for any number of reasons. However, doing so will yield far
better results for your IT project and for the users/customers to whom control is
ultimately transferred.
In order to develop an effective operational transfer plan (which often can be
done in parallel with later stage project work tasks), you should follow several key
steps, listed here.
1.
Identify and involve key functional and process owners to help deﬁne the
plan.
2.
Perform a needs analysis to determine the needs for both an operational
plan and long-term, ongoing operation of project deliverables.
3.
Deﬁne requirements for ﬁnal operational test and for trigger points for
transfer.
4.
Prepare for transfer of all relevant IT project assets.This might include
source code, installers, system conﬁguration, and documentation. Ensure all
relevant documentation is accurate and current.
5.
Where intellectual property is concerned, ensure that ownership of prop-
erty rights is clearly determined and agreed to. For example, does the copy-
right transfer to the owner or remain with your company?
6.
Determine support that will be required after transfer. Clearly list responsi-
bilities for ongoing support—who is responsible for the activities and costs
of on-going support?
7.
Determine the logistics of the actual operational transfer.
8.
Determine changes to user/stakeholder processes and procedures created by
this operational transfer and modify processes/procedures as needed.
9.
Understand risks to operational transfer and develop contingency plans.
10.
Tie your operational transfer plans to training plans, support documenta-
tion, release notes, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) where appropriate.

Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

11.
Create a handoff checklist with roles and responsibilities clearly delineated
to avoid gaps.
12.
Keep your operational transfer plan updated and include milestones that tie
into the IT project plan so both plans are kept up to date and in sync.
Operational transfer is an area where many IT projects fall on their faces, which
is unfortunate because it’s a huge opportunity for success.A smooth transition can
improve your project success rate tremendously, so make sure your IT project plan
includes an operational transfer component.You may choose to create a separate
operational transfer plan and tie it to your IT project.The time and effort you spend
creating this transfer plan will help in terms of fewer customer complaints, higher
user satisfaction, and a higher overall perception of the project’s deliverables.
Resolving Common Project Problems
In this section of the chapter, we’re going to discuss common project problems and
provide ideas for addressing these problems. Obviously, we can’t cover every possible
scenario, but we will cover some of the common problems. By recognizing common
problems, you may be able to head them off at the pass.As you continue to hone
your IT project management skills, you will probably intuitively avoid these more
common mistakes.As part of your lessons learned activities in your IT project, you
may want to add to this list and keep it handy as you manage future IT projects. We
can’t always avoid mistakes, but at least we can avoid making the same mistakes over
and over again.
Problems with Scope
As you know, scope is the total amount of work to be accomplished on the project,
so deﬁning scope is fundamental to the project work and to the project’s success.
Problems with scope come in two primary ﬂavors: problems with scope deﬁnition
and problems with scope management.
Vague Scope Deﬁnition
At the outset of a project, during the deﬁnition stage, it’s possible that not enough
detail is yet known to clearly deﬁne the scope of the project. During the deﬁnition
stage, you should strive to create as much detail about scope as possible.The scope
document or deﬁnition should clearly describe the circumference of the circle of
project work, while not necessarily providing great detail. It should answer the ques-
tion,“How will we know when we’ve ﬁnished our work?” or to use the travel
analogy,“How will we know when we get there?”
www.syngress.com
Tracking IT Projects • Chapter 11
483

Possible Solutions:Add or develop speciﬁc, measurable criteria to the scope
document if it is vague. Many organizations call these SMART goals - speciﬁc, mea-
surable, attainable, realistic, and time-based (some people use tangible as the last element).
Instead of “Improve system uptime” as a scope statement, quantify that by putting
some numbers in to it.“System uptime will be 99.95% overall uptime with no more
than 30 minutes per week for unscheduled downtime.” Even if you later discover the
goal is not possible, you have drawn a line in the sand and everyone knows what the
project is all about.This detail allows you to push back on any proposed changes that
might increase scope. If you have a sound change management process deﬁned (and
in place) for your project, you can better manage proposed changes to the project
that will implement scope.
Scope Not Feasible
Sometimes despite our best efforts, we discover, as we’re midway through the pro-
ject, that the scope is just not feasible. Often projects start out sounding great, but
once we get into the functional or technical requirements phase, things start looking
bleak. Projects that include “discovery” work are most susceptible to this problem,
though all projects by their very nature are vulnerable to this risk.
Possible Solutions: Be sure to clearly deﬁne project speciﬁcations and pro-
posed approach.At the moment the project’s scope (deliverables) are deemed not
feasible, you should notify your project sponsor. If there is a business need driving
this project, you may need to go back to the drawing board. If not, you may want to
recommend this project be cancelled.There is no sense in chasing after a result that
is not possible or feasible. If you recall from earlier discussions, part of your evalua-
tion of the project at each step should be to ask whether the project (or any ele-
ment) is logical, feasible, desirable, and affordable. If you’ve been asking this all along,
you’re less likely to wind up in this situation. However, if you cancel a project that is
no longer feasible, you can at least be viewed as part of the solution instead of being
viewed as the part of the problem.
Errors in Approach
Sometimes despite our best project planning, we select the wrong approach.The
scope may be well deﬁned, but how we choose to deliver on that scope may be
wrong. Often the wrong approach is embedded in the technical speciﬁcations,
derived from the functional speciﬁcations. If you deﬁne a speciﬁc set of functionality
and then choose the wrong method of providing that functionality, your project can
get off track quickly. If your technical speciﬁcations assumed or speciﬁed a
www.syngress.com
484
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

Windows-based solution but other components only work on a UNIX platform,
you have an error in the approach.
Possible solutions: To the degree possible, look at functional and technical
requirements closely to ensure you don’t have a disconnect. If an error in the
approach is discovered after project work commences, you have two choices. One is
to stop project work and go back through your planning stages.This can be time-
consuming and politically perilous, but can ultimately yield a more satisfactory
result.A second option is to sit down and ﬁgure out how to address the problem at
this juncture through change control methods. Ideally, your schedule and budget
reserves should help cover the additional time or money required, but that may leave
the rest of your project work exposed to time and cost risks. Whatever you do, sit
down with your project sponsor immediately to address this issue before it gets out
of hand, becomes a political mineﬁeld, or blows up in your (or the project sponsor’s)
face. Getting out in front of this kind of issue is the best approach because regardless
of how painful it is now, it will only hurt worse as time goes on.
Scope Creep
We’ve discussed the dangers of scope creep repeatedly throughout this book. When
an IT project scope keeps expanding, it makes it virtually impossible to meet any
measure of success.That said, don’t be afraid of change. Sometimes changes are inno-
vative and ultimately reduce the time or cost of a project or increase the quality or
perception of the project. Large changes are those that are most dangerous and
should be brought through your formal change management process.
Possible solutions: First, educate everyone involved with the project about the
dangers of scope creep. Gain agreement from the IT project team to use the change
management process to manage scope changes.Avoid making changes to scope
without fully analyzing the change and assessing it in terms of its impact on the pro-
ject as well as on the time, cost, and quality of the project. Push back on your project
sponsor if he or she insists on changes to scope once project work has begun. If
change is required, be sure to let everyone (including executives and the project
sponsor) know how the change impacts the project.
Problems with Quality
Any problem with quality can be called a bug or defect.The term bug is used more
often in software projects and when a machine running questionable code acts
strange, it’s often said to be “acting buggy.” We’ll use the terms bug, error, or defect
interchangeably in this section. For more on software bug tracking and management
techniques, you can download the bug tracking template from the Syngress website.
www.syngress.com
Tracking IT Projects • Chapter 11
485

In some projects, quality metrics are very clear-cut. In other projects, quality
tends to be more subjective and your role is to be the arbitrator or ﬁnal authority on
all issues related to the project.This means making decisions in a timely fashion,
having clear policies, and sticking to them.There are several common problems you
may run into regarding project quality that we’ll discuss in this section along with
possible solutions.
Initial Results Do Not Meet Quality Standards
If the ﬁrst project deliverables (or early versions of them) do not meet quality stan-
dards, you have a problem. Quality defects at this point are signs of bigger problems.
The good news is that problems you discover at this point are easier and less expen-
sive to ﬁx now than later.
Possible solutions: Regardless of the direction you take, you must address the
quality issue immediately. In some cases that might mean halting project work until the
source of the problem can be discovered and remedied.The logical starting point for
your inquiry should be at the task—did the person performing the work understand
what needed to be done and did he or she have the skills, tools, and resources to
accomplish that work? Was unit testing performed and were the results acceptable? If a
team member is submitting sub-standard work, look more closely at that person.Task
owners (and those doing the work) are responsible for submitting work that meets
scope and quality standards. Unit testing should ﬁnd errors or problems early. If unit
testing is ﬂawed or not occurring, this must to be remedied immediately. If several
team members are submitting sub-standard work, the problem is more likely in the
project plan itself. If you suspect a problem in the plan, begin by reviewing the tasks
that came in under standards to see what (if any) quality standards, entry/exit criteria,
or completion criteria were deﬁned. In some cases, the answer is staring you in the
face—no quality metrics or criteria associated with tasks means the work of deﬁning
the WBS was not fully completed. Go back and ﬁll in all necessary details before pro-
ceeding. If your examination of the tasks doesn’t reveal any problems, the problem is
most likely in the functional or technical speciﬁcations. Review these specs in light of
the task problems discovered and modify plans as needed.
Work Delivered Outside of Scope
Sometimes work that is delivered is outside the scope of work.To those performing
the work, it may be considered an enhancement.To those testing the work, it might
be considered a bug. Which is it and what do you do about it?
Possible solutions: First, check your scope statement and your project deﬁni-
tion. Look at functional and technical specs related to this issue. First determine
www.syngress.com
486
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

whether this issue is a bug or an enhancement. If it is a bug, it should be noted in
the bug tracking system and ﬁxed. If it is outside the scope but not a bug, you have
to decide if you want it to remain there or not. Some “enhancements” may seem
trivial at the time, but as you get deeper into the project, they end up having a long
reach and impacting many other parts of the code.This type of scope creep may
appear to be innocent at ﬁrst, but you should carefully consider whether or not to
let it stand. Even a seemingly innocuous enhancement can end up causing bug-like
behavior when it interacts with other parts of the project. If you are unable to
clearly understand the implications on the project, you should probably treat it as a
bug and have it ﬁxed to avoid later problems. In some cases, it really is an enhance-
ment and may increase the ﬁnal quality of the project.Analyze then select a course
of action and stick to it. Vacillating on important decisions will eventually reduce
your effectiveness as an IT project manager.
Fixing The Wrong Problem
When reporting any type of error or defect, it’s important that the source problem
be identiﬁed, reported, and resolved. If it’s not, a lot of time and effort can be
expended running after the wrong problem. Here’s an example.You’re staying in a
hotel and you notice water on the ﬂoor in the bathroom.You report “water on ﬂoor
in bathroom.”The hotel manager sends someone up with a mop and bucket and
mops up the water. However, the water soon returns.The manager sends someone
back up with a mop, and so it continues.The real issue is not water on the ﬂoor, but
a leak that is causing water to be on the ﬂoor. If you had reported “a leak that leaves
water on the ﬂoor” the manager could have sent a plumber instead of a janitor.The
same is true with quality problems in your project.Always look for the root cause
and address it.
Possible solutions: The symptom is likely to be one person saying they ﬁxed a
problem (developer, tech) and another person (tester) saying the problem still exists.
This can lead to bad working relationships on both sides and this type of back and
forth should be quickly managed.The tester is looking at the product from the user
point of view, while the developer or tech is looking at it from the project point of
view. When these situations occur, you may be able to locate the underlying
problem easily. If not, get several developers/techs and testers in a room to brain-
storm about what could be the underlying cause. By getting the team to work
together on this issue, you are subtly acknowledging the issue is bigger than any one
person.This helps people “save face,” an important element in effective team work. If
the developer/tech feels he or she is being insulted or that their work is being ques-
tioned, he or she may become defensive and not fully participate. Make it clear that
www.syngress.com
Tracking IT Projects • Chapter 11
487

the work is ﬁne but that there is an underlying problem that has to be discovered.
Using their expertise, you can ﬁnd that problem and ﬁx it.
Problems Reappear
This issue is almost exclusively found in the software arena where a tester reports a
bug, it gets ﬁxed and later, the problem reappears.This is a likely sign that source
control procedures are not being followed. Developers do most of their work with a
local copy of the code running on their machine.This code may contain one pro-
gram or hundreds, depending what is being developed. If one developer (George)
ﬁxes a piece of defective code, while another developer (Lorraine) has a copy of the
bad code running on her machine then this can happen. George ﬁnds and ﬁxes the
bug and checks the code back in to the system library. Now Lorraine, who was
working on another issue, checks her code back in. If the source library protocols are
not followed correctly, Lorraine’s code will overwrite George’s ﬁx and will reintro-
duce the bug back into the code.
Possible solutions: If you ﬁnd this happening, meet with the developers (or
development manager) and ask them to identify how this happened and what
changes they will make to their source control procedures to avoid this issue in the
future. Don’t assume this is a one-time event. If one problem reappears, it may have
been a one-time problem, but investigate it thoroughly. Process and procedure prob-
lems may initially appear as a single problem, but they will grow over time and you’ll
ﬁnd that you have multiple problems reappearing. By the time this happens, you’ve
got considerable confusion and frustration with the developers and a real risk to
your code.This is a very serious problem that can create major havoc with the pro-
ject. It can also create real morale problems when issues keep cropping back up.The
good news is that most software projects have source control tools available and
when used in a disciplined manner, they can help you avoid these kinds of issues.
Problems Cannot Be Resolved
Sometimes problems that crop up cannot be quickly or easily resolved.They may
appear ﬁrst as quality issues, but upon further investigation, they reveal deeper design
problems.These instances may be rare, but when they occur, an IT project manager
may spend several sleepless nights worrying about what to do.
Possible solutions: First, gather the team and discuss the issue. In this type of
scenario, the more people looking at the problem, the better. Begin with an orga-
nized search for the problem by looking at the scope statement, the functional and
technical speciﬁcations, the technology, and the chosen approach to the project. If
the problem cannot be found, begin brainstorming about possible sources of the
www.syngress.com
488
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

problem. Encourage the team to be really creative at this juncture to make sure that
they cover every possible angle. If you encourage this type of investigation, it’s likely
the problem will be found.You may need to halt project work while this problem is
being investigated to prevent the problem from rippling through the project. Be sure
to gain project sponsor approval for delaying or halting the project and adjust your
schedule accordingly. Once the solution is found, assess its impact on your schedule,
budget, critical path, scope, and project requirements. Determine if the solution is
feasible within the constraints of the project.This may require you and the team to
go back and modify the project plan or simply modify some of the tasks, processes,
or procedures within the project. If the problem cannot be resolved, the project
should be tabled until resolution is found or terminated. Continuing on while your
project is hobbled by an unsolvable problem of any size signiﬁcantly reduces your
chance of success. Some problems allow us to keep working while we ﬁnd the solu-
tion; other problems are best solved when everyone stops work in other areas and
focuses on addressing this one issue.
A ﬁnal word on this scenario. It’s wise to always try to separate out “discovery”
work from “production” work—meaning you should not try to invent a new tech-
nology and put that new technology to work in the same project.A discovery pro-
ject is far more uncertain and will have many more stops and starts than a
production project. Don’t start the production project until discovery is almost com-
plete.This will help avoid unsolvable problems in some instances.
Problems with Schedule
Problems with the project schedule are often the most challenging because you’re
dealing with tasks both on and off the critical path. Changes to the project schedule
can put the project at risk due to a variety of issues. Let’s look at common schedule
problems and possible solutions you can use to address them.
Late Start
Sometimes you can start project work already behind schedule due to earlier
changes or delays or due to shifting requirements. Normally, you start the project
schedule clock ticking once work gets underway, but if you have external milestones
or deadlines to meet, it may not matter when your schedule “ofﬁcially” begins. Late
starts can start you off on the wrong foot, so try to avoid starting your project
behind schedule.
Possible solutions: In some cases, you may be able to adjust your schedule to
reﬂect the changes or delays that cause the schedule problem. Be sure to document
the causes of the delay, especially if they were out of your control or outside your
www.syngress.com
Tracking IT Projects • Chapter 11
489

realm of authority or inﬂuence.Talk with your project sponsor to get approval for
modifying the schedule to adjust for the unavoidable delay. If possible, you may ﬁnd
ways to shorten your project schedule. Sometimes analysis reveals opportunities to
do tasks in parallel that were missed earlier. Sometimes you may choose to crash or
fast track your schedule (discussed in Chapter 10), but these are serious actions that
come with a certain degree of risk. Whatever you do, don’t promise to make up lost
time if you’re not 100% certain you can do so.The rule of thumb is “under promise,
over deliver.” If you make a promise you can’t keep, your credibility and political
capital will fall. If you make a promise and deliver it with time to spare, you’ll look
like a hero. One word of caution about that: don’t under promise to the point where
your project sponsor thinks you’re incompetent. If something should take a week
and you promise it in three weeks and deliver it in two days, you will gain a reputa-
tion as either a terrible estimator or someone obsessed with covering your rear end.
Neither view is ﬂattering, so lean toward the pessimistic view of reality when
coming up with new schedule commitments.
Floating Start Date
This problem can be similar to a late start, but it’s a bit trickier to address sometimes.
The start date is set then moves then gets set then moves again.A ﬂoating start date
is dangerous because resources committed to your project can become unavailable if
your start date keeps ﬂoating around.
Possible solutions: First, check that the project is aligned with corporate
needs. If it’s somewhere out in left ﬁeld, you’ll have trouble getting necessary com-
mitments for the project to move forward.Along those lines, also check on the pro-
ject’s priority. It may be aligned with corporate goals, but it may have slipped down
in priority due to other changes in the corporate business environment. Sometimes
the start date ﬂoats because the planning stage drags on and on. In this case, set a
hard deadline for completing planning so the start date can be set. Don’t spend time
creating detailed plans for work that is 6 or 12 months out. Create high-level plans
for later phases, but don’t spin your wheels creating detailed plans for distant dates in
the future.Things will likely change by then and you probably don’t have enough
information to create a detailed plan.This sometimes leads to planning paralysis, so
make a commitment to complete planning, don’t shoot for detail on distance phases,
and draw a line in the sand and get going. If you’re wishy-washy on setting and
sticking to your start date, you’re going to have trouble throughout your project with
deadlines and deliverables so learn to make and keep commitments. If your start date
does ﬂoat or change, you’ll have to double check that needed resources are still avail-
able. Finally, if you can’t pin down a start date, you might consider canceling the
project.
www.syngress.com
490
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

Floating Completion Date
Some projects get off to a great start but seem unable to complete.These projects just
seem to go on and on with no end in sight.A ﬂoating completion date means you’ve
got one or more problems in your project that you should address immediately.
Possible solutions: First, look at tasks on your critical path. Which ones have
slipped and why? Next, determine what is currently causing the ﬂoat. When you
can’t pin down a completion date, it means that there is uncertainty, especially
regarding tasks on the critical path. Next, check your scope statement and require-
ments. Double check that scope hasn’t expanded while you weren’t looking. Scope
creep is the most common reason for a ﬂoating completion date, so be sure to check
that. Review your WBS. Does your WBS deﬁne all the work that has to be done? If
not, additional work may be going on that is needed, but not actually deﬁned or
scheduled.Another problem with the WBS is that tasks lack adequate detail and
work packages or assignments become vague.Tasks should have plenty of detail in
them, including entry/exit criteria or completion criteria.A task without these cri-
teria could simply go on forever. Deﬁne what a completed task looks like so it can
be completed.Also, double check that all tasks have owners. Some tasks may not
have owners through oversight or through miscommunication and those tasks will
not get done.These may be the tasks that keep ﬂoating around your project schedule
and never get started because no one is taking responsibility for them. Floating com-
pletion date can also occur when you have a project that combines discovery and
production. Separate the discovery portion of the project from the production por-
tion and only begin (or continue) production work once the discovery portion is
completed.
Missed Deadline or Deliverable
Missed deadlines or deliverables happen to everyone once in a while.The key is how
and how well you handle these inevitable problems.
Possible solutions: It should not come as a surprise to you, your project team,
or your project sponsor that a deadline or deliverable will be missed.That would be
the equivalent of driving 80 mph right up to the edge of a cliff before applying the
brakes—not a wise choice and almost always ineffective. Make sure you encourage
(require) your team to keep you apprised of potential problems. If you recall from
Chapter 10, encouraging your team to bring you the bad news will help you
manage the project more effectively. Once you’re aware of problems that cannot be
corrected in a timely manner (that is, those that will cause you to miss a deadline or
deliverable), work with your team to develop contingency plans, alternatives, or solu-
tions to the problem. Determine what caused you to miss the deadline, what impact
www.syngress.com
Tracking IT Projects • Chapter 11
491

it has on the project, and what you can do to recover. Once that information is pre-
pared, talk with your project sponsor. Over time, IT project managers that deal with
problems in a responsible and proactive manner are given more responsibility and
respect. Letting problems creep up on you and your project sponsor will not only
put the project at risk, it could very well put your career at risk as well. It’s often not
whether problems occur, but how well you deal with them that will determine your
success—both in your project and in your career.
Everything on the Critical Path
One common statement is “all tasks in the project are critical, so they’re all on the
critical path.” While it is true that all tasks in the project are important (or they
should not be in the project plan), it is not true that all tasks are on the critical path.
By deﬁnition, the tasks on the critical path are those tasks that, if delayed, would
delay the entire project. Conversely, these same tasks, if completed ahead of schedule,
would cause the project to ﬁnish early. Let’s look at an analogy. If you were driving
from San Diego, California to Richmond, Virginia, there would be tasks that would
be more important than others. For instance, getting gas would be on the critical
path because if you delayed getting gas, you’d run out of gas someplace and you’d be
delayed getting to Richmond. On the other hand, you may have a task deﬁned as
“clean bugs off windshield.”This task will be done intermittently throughout your
project, but delaying cleaning bugs off the windshield will not delay the project until
the windshield becomes so ﬁlled with bugs you cannot see and have to slow down
to drive.This task, then, can be done just about anytime within reason. If, however, it
is delayed beyond a reasonable point, it can land on the critical path. Understanding
the nature of critical path tasks helps you properly deﬁne them.
Possible solutions: If you believe all tasks are on the critical path, you have
made an error in the deﬁning your task dependencies, durations, and/or ﬂoat. In
almost every project, there are tasks that are not on the critical path that can be done
just about any time. If you’re installing a new server, you need the power to be in
place before you can ﬁre it up, but you don’t need the nameplate that attaches to the
server cover telling you the server’s name. If all tasks in your project are on the crit-
ical path, review your task dependencies. If a task is not really dependent upon pre-
vious task(s), remove the dependency. If a task is not going to take as long as the
duration in the plan indicates, adjust it to reﬂect reality. If tasks have no ﬂoat deﬁned,
they may end up on the critical path.Add appropriate slack or ﬂoat to reﬂect the
reality of the situation. It’s not uncommon that things shift after the initial project
plan is created and updating dependencies, duration, and ﬂoat to reﬂect reality will
help you see your real critical path.
www.syngress.com
492
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

Nothing on the Critical Path
In some cases, you might think that there are no real dependencies. Using the server
example, you might think “We can get that power installed anytime before next
month” or “We can borrow backup tapes until ours come in.” While these state-
ments are true, they are misleading. Every project has tasks on the critical path.
Possible solutions: If you have a project plan showing no critical path tasks,
something is wrong. Start by looking at dependencies.Ask what would happen if a
task was delayed for a week, month, or longer. Once you understand the impact of
the delay, you can determine whether a task is on the critical path or not.Also check
duration and ﬂoat. If you were loosy-goosy with duration and ﬂoat estimates, it may
appear that everything can move around to accommodate change. Review your
duration and ﬂoat estimates, especially for tasks you’ve determined would be a
problem if they were delayed too long.This will help you begin to identify tasks that
truly belong on the critical path.The overriding question is,“Will this delay the
entire project if delayed?” If yes, it’s on the critical path.The secondary question is,
“Which tasks is this dependent upon and which tasks depend on this?” Once you’ve
accurately identiﬁed dependencies, you’ll begin to see your critical path emerge.
Problems with Budget
Some companies pay little attention to a project budget, while others review it with
a ﬁne-toothed comb. Regardless of how your company deals with IT project bud-
gets, your job as IT project manager is to manage the funds allotted to you for the
project. When a project ends up sideways due to its funding, the chances for project
success are reduced signiﬁcantly. Keep in mind that if cost is your least ﬂexible pro-
ject parameter, you should carefully and frequently review project costs to avoid
these common problems.And, if you discover a problem with the budget, let your
project sponsor know immediately. It’s better to bring this problem to your sponsor
than to have your sponsor bring it to you. Let’s look at problems common to budget
management and possible solutions you can use.
Funds Expended Up Front
An unfortunate but common scenario is you’re halfway into the project and 3/4 of
your funds are spent.This is an indication of one of two problems. Either there was a
signiﬁcant variation or you’re not doing a great job managing your budget.
Remember, though, that scope, schedule, budget, and quality are all interrelated. If
you increase scope or quality or reduce schedule, your budget may burst at the
seams.That might be perfectly acceptable to all parties involved—the key is to gain

explicit approval for such variances before they occur. If budget is the least ﬂexible
project parameter, you will have to explain why you have this type of variance.
There may be a good reason such as purchasing equipment needed for a later phase
of work at year-end for accounting purposes or to take advantage of a special
pricing deal.These will net out at the end of the project but should be carefully
reviewed.
Possible solutions: The ﬁrst step is to look at what caused (is causing) the addi-
tional burden on your budget. In Chapter 10, we discussed sources for budget vari-
ance and what you can do to adjust for them. Some budget variances may simply be
incorporated into the project (after analysis and agreement). Other budget problems
will cause the project to be selected for special review (not a good thing). If your pro-
ject risks cancellation because of these budget variances, you will have to do your best
to make the business case for why the project should continue (if, in fact, it should).
Sometimes the budget variance is a logical consequence of earlier, agreed-upon
actions. Sometimes the budget variance is due to some value-added activity that will
pay off at project completion. Other times, there may be no reasonable explanation
for the variance and the decision to move forward or cancel may rest solely with the
project sponsor or the Finance department. If the problem is because you’ve done a
poor job managing the budget, you should review your cost control procedures and
make adjustments to ensure you have tighter control of your budget moving forward.
If your reserve amount can handle the variance, you may be able to salvage the pro-
ject if your adherence to budget moving forward is greatly improved. Hold weekly
budget review meetings and insist on giving your personal approval for all expendi-
tures over a certain (low) amount to help you get your budget back on track.
Assets Moved Off Project
Sometimes you’ll purchase assets of the project that will sit idle for some period of
time due to changes in the project schedule or other unanticipated changes.
Occasionally, those assets will be appropriated by some other department or team
and suddenly your new servers or new routers or new whatever are in someone
else’s domain or department. Sometimes someone sees hardware sitting around
unused and sees it as a bone yard for scavenging parts.
Possible solutions: The key is to determine why the assets were taken, who
took them, and why.This is not an exercise in ﬁnger-pointing, but a fact-ﬁnding
mission. If the assets were taken for a higher priority project, that’s ﬁne. If they were
used for spare parts, that’s also ok.The key is to understand how and why they were
taken so you can build the business case for getting them back.Talk with your pro-
ject sponsor about the situation to determine the best course of action. Sometimes
www.syngress.com

Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

the best resolution is to take a hit to your budget and go purchase new equipment.
This would be done with your project sponsor’s explicit approval. If possible
(depending on your corporate culture and accounting system), you may be able to
assign the cost of those appropriated assets to that other division or department so
your budget won’t take a hit. If you have to use your reserve amounts to deal with
this type of situation, document exactly what happened so there is not any question
about the loss of corporate assets. If the servers are now in another location or were
used for spare parts, make a note of that.You don’t need corporate controllers
coming back to you asking if you took three or four servers home with you.
Too Many Approvals To Spend Your Budget
Part of deﬁning your project is to agree with your project sponsor as to what, where,
how, and when you can spend your IT project budget. However, some companies
have so many approval layers and so much red tape that it becomes a project in itself
just to get approval to spend IT project funds. In these cases, delays in funding
approval can throw the schedule off, causing a ripple effect throughout the project.
Possible solutions: If it’s taking too long to get approval, consider asking your
project sponsor for a monthly allocation that you can spend. Make sure it’s not a
“use it or lose it” allocation so that it can pile up for a month or two or three for
large, upcoming expenditures. If that’s not feasible, consider asking your project
sponsor for a “fast track” funding option so that you can get project expenditures
approved in a more timely manner.A third possible solution is to ask for an increase
in the amount you are authorized to spend, at least for the duration of the project. It
might be that in normal circumstances, you’d need approval for each expenditure
over $500, but for the duration of the project, your limit is increased to $1000 or
$1500. If none of these options is acceptable to your project sponsor, you should try
to document the business case for modifying the spending limits or approval process.
There is a cost to schedule delays—both tangible and intangible—and a polite
reminder of these consequences for your project sponsor might prompt the change
you need.
Shrinkage
Experienced IT project managers are familiar with shrinkage. It often stems from a
memo from the CEO that begins “Due to changes in the marketplace, we’re cutting
all project budgets by 15% effective immediately….” Ouch.All that diligent project
planning seems to ﬂy right out the window. Since you’re aware that there is a rela-
tionship between scope, time, cost, and quality, you immediately know that if your
budget is reduced by 15% you will need to reduce scope or quality or increase time
www.syngress.com
Tracking IT Projects • Chapter 11
495

to adjust for the budget change.The question is, what do you do next? No matter
what course of action you take, whining about the cutback is not likely to change
the outcome and it’s a sign of poor leadership. Look for ways to meet the new
requirement and position yourself as part of the solution, not part of the problem.
You may not be happy about the requirement to cut your budget, but you have to
deal with it as the IT project manager.
Possible solutions: First, review your ﬂexibility grid. If budget is your least
ﬂexible (and it was just reduced by 15%), you know that something else must be
most ﬂexible. Begin by looking at that parameter to determine what you can adjust.
For example, if cost is least ﬂexible but schedule is most ﬂexible, you may ﬁnd that
by stretching out your schedule, you can reduce the cost of the project. If not, you
have to move up your ﬂexibility grid to your next most ﬂexible parameter. Once
you’ve determined your approach to cutting your project budget by 15%, you need
to assess the risks associated with making the proposed changes. Ideally, you and the
team will devise two or three possible solutions and prioritize them (remember, can-
celing the project may be one of them). Once you and the IT project team have
developed your recommendations, you should meet with your project sponsor to
discuss proposed solutions.
Problems with Staff
At several points throughout this book, we’ve discussed working with your IT pro-
ject team from recognizing and managing differences in work styles and cultures to
providing the necessary ingredients to create a highly effective team. Despite your
best efforts, teams sometimes run into problems. If you ﬁnd yourself with a problem
related to your project team, you might ﬁnd solutions in this section. If not, be sure
to turn to your manager, another experienced IT project manager, or your friendly
HR department for advice on resolving personnel issues.
Matrix Organization (Who’s Staff Is This Anyway?)
One of the most common team-related problems you may run into is conﬂict over
who belongs to whom. When someone is pulled from a department to work on a
project team, to whom do they report? Who holds them accountable? What are
their priorities? These kinds of unresolved problems cause stress for the person
caught in the middle and reduce productivity and the quality of their work.
Possible solutions: Discuss the project with the functional or departmental
managers who will be lending staff to your project. Explain to them the project’s
objectives, what you’ll need the selected person to do, and what your timeframe is.
Come to mutually acceptable agreements about how you’ll handle conﬂicting prior-
www.syngress.com
496
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

ities before they crop up then rely on your agreed-upon procedures when these
issues arise.Anticipating and planning for these kinds of problems goes a long way
toward avoiding them. If they can’t be resolved in this manner, sit down and have an
honest, open discussion with the manager explaining what is happening and how it
impacts the project. Rather than expecting the other person to give in to your
demands, come prepared with several possible solutions along with your recommen-
dations.This will help resolve sometimes sticky issues by showing you’re willing to
work through problems, arrive at the table with potential solutions, and give a little.
Whiners
A whiner isn’t someone who brings up the negative or downside of a situation. It’s
someone who does that and never looks for the solution.They can be irritating at
best and few, if any, people want to work with people like this.
Possible solutions: If you have a whiner on your team, you need to assess
whether they’re adding enough value to the team to justify keeping them on board.
Whiners can de-energize entire teams and take the energy, excitement, and enthu-
siasm for a project and deﬂate it quickly. If you can’t or don’t want to remove the
team member, you’ll need to manage this behavior. First, require that your team
make meaningful statements about the problem that are speciﬁc, measurable (if pos-
sible), and realistic. For instance, saying “The code from Section Seven is garbage” is
not meaningful by any measure.A statement such as,“There are fourteen critical
errors in the code from Section Seven,” is far more useful. Next, require that every
time a problem is mentioned, a solution must also be offered. It doesn’t matter much
if the solution is feasible or desirable as long as problem is offered with a suggested
solution (or two).This will prevent problems from just being lobbed out for the
team to deal with. Instead, some thought will have to accompany problem state-
ments. Who knows, you might also ﬁnd a great solution along the way by requiring
the naysayer to consider possible solutions. Make this a rule for everyone, not just
your whiners. Meaningful problem statements paired with possible solutions will
change this dynamic quickly.
Big Biters
People who take on too much can cause major or minor problems for projects
because they typically lack self-awareness as to how much they should commit to,
based on their time and skills. If you don’t manage these folks, they can tank your
project by signing on for more than they can handle then failing to deliver (scope,
time, cost, or quality) on those deliverables. Self-conﬁdence and enthusiasm are won-
derful traits in measured doses.
www.syngress.com
Tracking IT Projects • Chapter 11
497

Possible solutions: Encourage “big biters” to take on small segments of work
until you verify whether or not this person has the time and skills to deliver. In
some circles it’s referred to as “trust and verify,” meaning that you place a small
amount of trust in the person and verify whether that trust was justiﬁed or not. If it
was, you can place additional trust and verify that level and so forth. By carefully
managing the big biter, you can help them grow in awareness of what they can and
cannot do while keeping your project safe from the “over promise, under deliver”
syndrome many big biters bring with them.
Belt and Suspenders
We all know someone like this—almost completely risk-averse.Their avoidance of
risk could come from prior bad experience in which they got burned or it could
simply be their personality or work style.The analyst types we discussed in Chapter 4
can sometimes really have problems with change and risk. If you have these types of
people on your team and your project requires some level of risk, you’re going to
engage in a tug-of-war with them throughout the project process.
Possible solutions: If you are working on a risky project, these risk-averse
people are not good ﬁts for your team. If you cannot replace them with team mem-
bers more comfortable with risk, try to ﬁnd parts of the project that will utilize their
skills and talents. Since these kinds of people can be very good at spotting problems
(they look for risk so they can avoid it), you can engage them fully in your risk
assessment and management tasks as well as some of your detail work such as cre-
ating the WBS and task details, helping manage the costs and schedule of the pro-
ject, and other less risky tasks. By assigning more mundane roles to these folks, you
utilize their innate talents while ofﬂoading some of the routine project management
tasks to someone else, freeing you up to work on tasks that may require more of
your bandwidth. Don’t let their fear of risk or failure rub off on the team, though.
Keep the project moving forward, and if you ﬁnd they are causing delays due to risk
aversion or through planning beyond a reasonable point (analysis paralysis), take
action to move them off the task or out of the way to keep forward momentum.
Personal Conﬂict
As we discussed in Chapter 4, your role as IT project manager includes creating a
positive work environment for your team.This is especially true when dealing with
people of different ages, backgrounds, cultures, and languages.Your HR department
is probably your best resource for advice on handling sensitive issues, but we’ll dis-
cuss some possible solutions here as well.
www.syngress.com
498
Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

Possible solutions: First, you should have a zero tolerance policy for rude,
intimidating, belittling, or disrespectful behavior. Some behaviors can lead to a hos-
tile work environment and may lead to legal issues down the road. If you’re unsure
or if you’re concerned, consult with your HR department immediately. Do not dis-
count or trivialize these issues because they not only cause immediate problems, but
they can have serious long-term consequences as well.That said, you may encounter
conﬂicts between team members that are impacting the team but are not serious
enough to bring to your HR department.To resolve interpersonal conﬂict you can:
■
Talk privately to each individual involved in the problem. Listen to each
individual’s perspective. Conclude the conversation by asking them what
they would change about the situation and what they would be willing to
change.This sets the stage for a negotiated settlement and helps them
understand they will likely have to give something to resolve the situation.
■
Once you have each person’s perspective along with their lists of what they
would like to see changed and what they’d be willing to change, put
together a recommended solution (or two or three, if possible). Gather
everyone in the room and discuss solutions based on the information they
gave you.
■
Once a resolution has been forged, enforce it.
■
If anyone reneges on the agreement, address it with them immediately.
■
Remove people from the project who are unable or unwilling to resolve
personal conﬂict through negotiation and mediation.They’ll steal project
time and energy and wear everyone out in the process.
Problems with Project Sponsor
Taking time to develop a strong, open, and honest relationship with your IT project
sponsor can pay off handsomely down the line—when things go right, you’ll get
appropriate credit and rewards, and when things go wrong, you’ll get appropriate
political cover and support. Keep it real with your project sponsor and always be the
one to bring the bad news to the sponsor. If your project sponsor hears bad news
from another source before you report it, your credibility begins to erode. Most
people hate being ambushed by bad news, so make sure you stay on top of things
and communicate with your project sponsor in a proactive and timely manner.That
said, there are problems that can crop up with your project sponsor, including the
ones listed here.

Project Report Grows Lengthy
Sometimes a project report ends up getting longer and longer until it begins to rival
War and Peace. This is not productive for you as the IT project manager and it’s
probably not helpful for your project sponsor either.
Possible solutions: What to include in the status report should be determined
at the start of the project, but it is often not well deﬁned or not known in advance.
Try including just four basic elements when reporting project status:
■
What has been accomplished since the last report
■
What is planned to happen during the upcoming period until the next
report
■
What items have missed the schedule or are over budget and what their
status is in a summary format
■
What items are of concern that have to be addressed
The goal is to provide a one- or two-page summary of the project status and
make sure any items that are a risk to the project are seen by management so they
can be acted on as early as possible. If you provide too much detail, you also risk
having the project sponsor (or other executives) begin to micromanage your project
for you.
Meetings Become Rehash of Prior Decisions
Sometimes meetings with project sponsors become reviews of decisions previously
made. Constantly reviewing previous decisions makes it difﬁcult to get any forward
momentum going and it puts your project at risk because, conceivably, every deci-
sion made could be reversed.
Possible solutions: If you and your project sponsor keep rehashing the same
decisions, it could be a sign that the sponsor is nervous about the project. If that’s the
case, ask yourself:
■
Are your project status reports accurate?
■
If you were in your project sponsor’s shoes, would you be nervous?
■
Are you making decisions above your level of authority?
■
Have you taken risks that have not panned out?
■
Has your project sponsor been hit by any surprises or unexpected bad news
regarding the project?

Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

If your project sponsor feels he or she is not getting straight answers or the level
of detail needed to accurately assess the project’s health, he or she might begin to go
back over old decisions with you. Go over your concerns with the project sponsor,
give speciﬁc examples of the problem and really listen to the feedback you get from
your project sponsor. If your project sponsor is a real hands-on type of person and
can’t seem to let go of these decisions, you may need to create a more detailed pro-
cess for signing off on decisions so they do not have to be revisited. For instance, you
may need to keep detailed notes about how, why, and when the decision was
reached, what the environment was, and what factors went into the decision.Then, if
the sponsor wants to revisit a decision, you may be able to discuss the document you
have and ask what has changed to cause you to revisit the issue.
Can’t Arrange Meetings with Sponsor
Project sponsors are often busy people like the rest of us. If you are unable to
schedule time with your project sponsor to discuss project progress, one of three
things is likely wrong. It’s possible the project has slipped in priority and you don’t
know about it. It’s possible the project sponsor’s priorities have changed even if the
organization’s haven’t. It’s also possible that the project sponsor is just too busy and
meetings with you fall off their “to do” list.
Possible solutions: If possible, ﬁrst determine if the organization’s priorities
have shifted away from your project. If it seems that’s the likely cause of the problem,
insist on a meeting and let the sponsor know that you realize priorities may have
shifted. If the sponsor wants to avoid this session because he or she doesn’t want to
deal with the negative impact, your mentioning this might pave the way to an
honest and useful discussion. If the project sponsor’s priorities have shifted and
you’ve been able to discern that, it might be time for a different project sponsor. In
that case, you should identify your desired or optimal replacement sponsor and
deﬁne your rationale for such a request.Then, contact your project sponsor and let
him or her know that you believe the project might do well to transition to another
person due to this sponsor’s workload, commitments, new direction, etc. Be very
careful not to make this about the project sponsor failing as a sponsor, but about the
changes that have occurred within the project sponsor’s work or environment that
make changing sponsors a logical action. Finally, if your project sponsor just claims
to be too busy, be ready to be incredibly ﬂexible to get some face time with the
project sponsor. Come in early, stay late, offer to go get sandwiches for an in-house
meeting, arrange a video call or cell phone call while you (or the project sponsor) is
traveling, talk on Saturday morning at a local coffee shop. Do whatever it takes to
get face-to-face with your project sponsor on a fairly regular basis. Be creative and

offer solutions such as ofﬂoading non-critical tasks (signing project time cards, for
example) to someone else with proper authority or look to bring on a project co-
sponsor to take up some of the work. Whatever you do, do not assume that just
because you can’t get a meeting that the project sponsor is just ﬁne with what’s
going on. Remember the old project management saying,“No news is simply no
news.”
Project Sponsor Pressure
The project sponsor is under pressure regarding the project just as the IT project
manager is.The key difference is that the project sponsor will pass that pressure on
to you and sometimes you feel as though you may buckle under the pressure. Here
are some simple solutions that can help you deal with that type of project pressure.
Possible solutions: First, be prepared. Make sure your project data is up to
date, that your team provides you updates that are accurate and timely, and that you,
in turn, provide accurate, timely, and meaningful data to your project sponsor. If your
project sponsor is up to speed on the progress of the project and understands the
risks, challenges, positive, and negative events, he or she will be able to properly
explain (and in some cases, defend) project results to corporate management or exec-
utives.A good offense is the best defense, so make sure you’re on top of your pro-
ject’s status. If your project sponsor has signed off on the major components of the
project as you’ve gone along (as suggested throughout this book), you should have
an easier time dealing with some pressure because you can take these decisions
points back to your sponsor to spark his or her memory. If you’re getting pressure to
complete the project sooner, for instance, you can discuss scope and schedule with
your project sponsor and come to agreement as to how to proceed or how to fend
off further schedule pressure. If you’ve developed a good relationship with your pro-
ject sponsor, you can have an honest, open discussion about what the drivers are and
together develop a plan to address these added pressures.

Cheat Sheet…
Being On Top of Your Game
A project manager has lots of pressure and your sponsor will certainly provide a
share of it. You can control this pressure by being organized and having an iron-
clad reporting system. “On my projects, I produce a weekly status report on Fridays.
I stay as late as possible to get it done on Friday, but if it is not done, I ﬁnish it on
the weekend,” explains Nels Hoenig, Quality Assurance Project Leader for TDCI, Inc.
“My publish date is Monday at 9:00 A.M. This hard date keeps me focused. It also
means my sponsor knows she can count on being prepared for her staff meeting
at 10:00A.M. I hold my team responsible for having their reports to me by end of
the day on Thursday and I am very strict about this. Since I’m not pestering them
25 times a week on status questions, they deliver their status updates on time and
we all can spend the rest of our time on the items that are critical or that can
become critical if not resolved. This also gives me Friday to chase down and solve
any issues that need to be addressed prior to ﬁnalizing my report.”
Nels also produces a monthly project report that provides a high-level view of
the project. It includes information on budget and schedule including plan versus
actual. He also includes good and bad news about the project so that everyone
remains up to date and helps ensure that everyone hears the same message.
Problems with Project Vendors
We haven’t focused on managing vendors, since vendors take so many different
forms. However, vendors should be treated as part of the project team from the
beginning so they are included in key project communications including timelines
and deadlines. Written contracts should be used to clarify costs, timelines, and deliv-
erables. Someone on the project team can be assigned as the vendor liaison (or sev-
eral team members, depending on the number of vendors) to oversee the vendor
relationship. Most vendors want to do a good job and will work cooperatively with
you to deﬁne portions of the project they’ll be working on and to help develop
speciﬁcations for work. Be sure to develop acceptance criteria that will indicate to the
vendor when you will sign off on or accept their deliverables. Deﬁne early delivery
bonuses and late delivery penalties.And remember to get a vendor point of contact
and all contact information including name, address, phone, cell, e-mail, etc. so you
know who to contact for routine or emergency communications. It’s helpful to spell
out in detail which process will be used to resolve disagreements to be sure that
www.syngress.com
Tracking IT Projects • Chapter 11
503

everyone is on the same page (and to avoid surprises). Contracts written by attorneys
as well as standard (boilerplate) contracts often contain these details, but it’s a good
idea to make sure they’re included in your contracts. Despite your earnest efforts,
you may still run into vendor problems. Here are a few common problems and
potential solutions.
Vendor Does Not Deliver As Promised
The biggest problem facing an IT project with regard to vendors is when a vendor
does not deliver as promised. Whether it’s needed test equipment, software code, or
new servers for the upgrade, vendor delays can put your project behind schedule
quickly. If the product or service the vendor is providing is critical to the project
(tasks that depend on these are on the critical path), you should have identiﬁed them
as risks and developed contingency plans for these scenarios.Any external event
(including vendor deliverables) over which you have little (or no) control presents a
project risk and you should include these in your risk management plans.
Possible solutions: The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd out why the vendor did not deliver
as promised. Is the issue quality, quantity, or delivery altogether? If the vendor
shipped defective parts, it’s the same problem as not shipping at all.Your contract
should specify your remedy should you have problems with the deliverable including
reordering on an expedited track. If the vendor is unable or unwilling to deliver the
items, you will have to locate an alternate vendor and expedite the order if possible.
Don’t wait until the shipment is delayed two weeks to check on it. Check on deliv-
erables before they are due so you know if there is a snag in the process. If there is
to be a delay, see if you can schedule other work around the delay so you don’t end
up pushing your entire schedule out. If the vendor short-shipped items, you may be
able to begin work in a staggered manner instead of waiting for all parts to be pre-
sent. In some IT projects, this presents problems and introduces unacceptable risk. In
other IT projects, a staggered start on this part of the project work is acceptable and
causes only a few rescheduling events.
Obviously, if you have continued problems with the vendor—not only in terms
of deliverables, but in terms of their attitude toward addressing problems—ﬁnd
another vendor. Projects can be delayed or can fail altogether because a vendor was
unwilling to address issues or unable to deliver as promised. Don’t get into the
mindset that this was a one-time event. If a problem occurs and the vendor handles
it promptly and appropriately, you can chalk it up to “mistakes sometimes happen.” If
mistakes happen frequently or the vendor is slow to resolve issues (or completely
unwilling), ﬁnd a new vendor because things will rarely get better.

Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

Product or Service Does Not Meet Speciﬁcations
When a vendor’s product or service doesn’t meet project speciﬁcations, there are
several potential problems that could be the root cause. Before blasting your vendor,
be sure to look at your own project plan ﬁrst to determine what your speciﬁcations
actually are.You may ﬁnd the vendor met your speciﬁcations, but you (and the pro-
ject team) were mistaken about the specs.This can happen when speciﬁcations
change or when a subject matter expert (including someone from the vendor com-
pany) recommends a different or better way to approach a speciﬁcation.
Possible solutions: First check that the vendor’s deliverable really doest not
meet speciﬁcations. It’s embarrassing to blast a vendor only to ﬁnd out later you
were wrong. Once you’re sure the vendor’s product is out of spec, talk with the
person on your IT project team that worked with that vendor. Review the vendor
paperwork. What you want to ﬁnd out is if you properly communicated the speciﬁ-
cations to the vendor in the ﬁrst place. If you told the vendor there was a 5/8”
clearance and it’s really on 3/8”, the problem is on your end and you’ll need to
work with the vendor to ﬁnd an appropriate solution. Once you’ve determined that
your specs are correct and that the vendor was given the correct specs, you obviously
need to contact the vendor.Ask them to review their specs and processes to deter-
mine what went wrong and what they can do to remedy the problem. Be clear
about timelines, deadlines, and costs when talking with them so they know exactly
what they’ll need to do to resolve the issue. If the issue requires research on their
part, get them to commit to a follow up meeting or phone call on a speciﬁc day and
time.This will put clear boundaries on their research and resolution period and will
not push your schedule into an interminable “ﬂoat”.Also, by telling them what the
problem is and asking them for the resolution, you put the onus on them to resolve
an issue they created. In some cases, they may come back with a better resolution
than you would have requested. If you ﬁnd the vendor is unwilling to admit to their
error, review the speciﬁcations and contract with them.This helps you be sure the
problem is on their end and essentially pushes them into accepting responsibility. If
they still will not resolve the issue, you may have to escalate it to your project
sponsor or even to legal counsel for resolution, if appropriate. If they are not cooper-
ative, you will have to continue to push for resolution with them and simultaneously
identify a new vendor to ﬁll in.As soon as possible, sever the relationship with the
non-responsive vendor. Put them on your “do not use” list for future projects.
Mistakes are one thing, refusing to take responsibility for errors is another matter
altogether.The ﬁrst can be ﬁxed, the second is an attitude or company culture
problem that goes to the core and will rarely, if ever, change.

Vendor Does Not Communicate
Communicating effectively with vendors is a key part of effective vendor manage-
ment. If you have a vendor with whom communications are difﬁcult or impossible,
this should raise a red ﬂag for you because it means if you run into a problem down
the line, you’ll have a very difﬁcult time chasing down someone to respond to your
issues.
Possible solutions: Make sure you have the correct vendor contact and current
contact information. Insist on a personal e-mail address (as opposed to “customer
service,”“marketing,”“sales,” or “info”) and a cell phone number. If you are unable
to reach your contact, call the main vendor phone number and ask for that person’s
supervisor. If unavailable, ask for the next person up the line until you get a human
being on the phone who can respond to your concerns. Be politely persistent. If the
vendor contact says he or she will return your call at 10:00 A.M., get on the phone at
10:05 A.M. and call them. If they do not answer, leave a message and state another
time you can be reached or provide an e-mail address. Don’t let communications
slide, insist on timely responses, and escalate issues in a timely manner. Sometimes
your contact may have left the company or gone on vacation without your knowl-
edge, so leaving repeated e-mails or voice mails will not resolve the issue.Therefore,
if you don’t get a response in a reasonable timeframe, start working you way up the
ladder. It might make your vendor contact angry, but your job is to get your project
completed on time. Be polite but persistent. If the error is yours or you jumped the
gun in escalating, apologize and move on. One incident like that, though, is often
enough to spur your contact to respond in a more timely manner in the future.
The IT Factor…
From the Vendor’s Perspective
“Most vendors want your business and they strive to create a mutually beneﬁcial
relationship,” explains Sonal Rana, Systems Analyst with an international con-
sulting ﬁrm. “When problems crop up, it’s often a case of miscommunication
rather than ill-intent. Stepping back from the situation and approaching it from
another angle can help you resolve the matter. Start with the mindset that
everyone has good intentions and something went wrong along the way. If you
start off blaming and accusing, you’re not likely to get an honest answer or a
positive result. When dealing with companies from other countries or cultures,

Continued

keep in mind that words and phrases may not have exactly the same meaning or
intent. Cross-cultural communications can be complicated, so check for under-
standing by having the vendor explain to you, in their words, what they believe
is expected of them. This can help you avoid simple miscommunications that end
up delaying an entire project.”
Problems with Customers/Users/Stakeholders
Problems with customers, end users, or stakeholders (whatever the case in your IT
project) come in several different forms. In some cases, the user (we’ll use “user” here
for all those terms) isn’t clear what the project deliverables are supposed to be and is
therefore displeased with the results. In other cases, user requirements have changed
and the deliverables don’t meet user needs. In still other cases, the user gets stubborn
about some elements of the project.
Users Are Not Pleased with Project Results
At some point during the project work and reporting, it becomes clear that the user
is displeased with the project.This is a difﬁcult situation that can cause problems
both in terms of real and perceived success of the project.
Possible solutions: It is during the deﬁnition of project scope and functional
requirements that the project begins to meet user needs. Users (or a select subset of
users) should be involved with deﬁning these speciﬁcations from the start.Two
things should happen at that point: the user is clear about what is and is not
included in the project and the IT project team is clear about what the user needs
and wants. Having a formal approval process for functional requirements that the
user signs off on is very helpful in preventing the users from changing their view of
the requirements of the project once work is underway. It can also be helpful to
review this document with users periodically throughout the project lifecycle to
ensure that user requirements are the same.
User Requirements Have 
Changed, Project Doesn’t Meet Needs
Sometimes major unanticipated changes happen in the user world that might require
you to go back and redeﬁne functional requirements. What was acceptable two or
three months ago is now only part of the picture.This type of change is a major
event in your IT project. Let’s look at how you can handle this.
Possible solutions: If major change occurs in the course of the project, you
can use the approved functional requirements document as your starting point for
www.syngress.com

discussion rather than reinventing the wheel. First determine what has changed in
the user environment and map it to deliverables in your functional speciﬁcations.
Next, ﬁgure out what has to change to accommodate user needs.Assemble the pro-
ject team and step back through the relevant deﬁnition and planning steps, including
deﬁning the new functional and technical speciﬁcations, as well as deﬁning new
scope, time, schedule, and quality parameters. Look at the risk to work completed to
determine how these changes will impact work already completed—will you have to
redo work or can you implement change moving forward? Finally, put all this
together in a report or analysis and discuss the results with your project sponsor.
Delivering a project that no longer meets users needs is a useless and wasteful exer-
cise, but you must assess how much of the change (if any) you can accommodate.
Remember, there may be times when canceling the project is your best bet. Other
times, you may need to drastically revamp (that is, start from scratch) your IT project
plan.The better job you do on the front end deﬁning requirements and getting user
buy-in, the less likely this scenario is to occur.That said, the unexpected can happen
in the user’s world just as it can in your world and by devising thoughtful responses
and solutions, you’ll be seen as a problem solver and team player.
User is Picking and Choosing Among Deliverables
This problem is most common when the user is an external client who is being billed
for services. Sometimes during the deﬁnition or delivery phase of the project, the user
starts nitpicking project details. In some cases, they might agree to large expenditures
and then nickel-and-dime you to death on small details. It can happen at the outset of
a project, sometime during project work, or when work is being delivered.
Possible solutions: Help the user understand the end-to-end beneﬁts of the
project proposal or project plan. Deﬁne the functional speciﬁcations based both on
user need and project need and educate the user about project needs.A good
example is if the user agrees to buy an expensive new tape backup unit but doesn’t
want to buy new tapes so they insist you spec out a tape drive than can use their
current tapes.Your job will be to educate the user and this often means making the
business case for your decisions. If the tape backup drive you recommend is more
reliable, handles more data, is faster or more secure, make sure you educate the user
about this, especially if you believe they’re starting to nickel-and-dime the project.
The cost of new tape might be the real issue for the user/client, so try to ﬁgure out
what the real objection is to your plan is and address that. If the user is reluctant to
pay for new tapes, do the math for them. Figure out the cost of a new set of tapes
and compare that to potential backup issues (slow backup due to rewrites, bad
backups due to tape errors) as well as the cost of a total system outage because of
worn out, unreliable tapes.

Enterprise 128 …
Penny Wise, Pound Foolish
Sometimes users demand the very best from an IT project. They’re happy to
spend thousands (or tens of thousands) of dollars on the latest hardware and
software. They want top-of-the-line everything and are willing to pay you over-
time to get everything ordered, tested, and installed in record time. During the
project deﬁnition phase, however, they become reluctant to spend an additional
$100 or $500 on some critical part of the solution. “What some clients fail to
realize is that it’s usually a case of pay a little now or pay much more later,”
explains Chris Compton, President of TCR Solutions, an IT service ﬁrm. “When we
recommend the customer purchase a $500 UPS system to avoid problems with
power outages that occur every year in the summer as part of an upgrade pro-
ject, they sometimes balk. Later if the system goes down, it often costs 10 or 20
times the cost of the UPS when you add up the replacement cost of hardware,
the cost of our time to replace and reinstall everything, and the lost productivity,”
says Compton. “We’ve begun developing business case scenarios for our clients
to help them understand the cost of prevention vs. the cost of recovery. In every
case, prevention has a much higher ROI (return on investment). We’ve begun to
build this into our IT project proposal phase to help clients make better long-term
decisions.”
Lesson Learned: When your users, customers, or clients balk at taking the
right steps to ensure project completion or success, make sure you step back and
help them see the bigger picture. Like life insurance, you don’t buy it because you
want to use it; you buy it because you hope you never have to use it. If your cus-
tomers want to play the odds, make sure you’ve made the business case and then
documented the decisions thoroughly to prevent these short-sighted decisions
from coming back to bite you and your IT project team.

The Impossible Project
Sometimes users, stakeholders, project sponsors, and others insist on what essentially
can be called an “impossible” project.They want you to accomplish too much work
in too little time with too few resources.This is a disaster waiting to happen and you
don’t need to be the poor sucker who walks into that one. First, you should learn to
recognize “impossible” projects early on so you can try to avoid becoming involved
with them.They are:
■
Projects that combine discovery with production
■
Projects that are poorly deﬁned or planned and lack adequate detail
■
Projects whose plans have been modiﬁed by management (shorter
schedule, lower budget, higher quality, and/or increased scope)
■
Projects with wrong or inadequate stafﬁng
■
Projects that keep slipping the start date
■
Projects that are underway but show no sign of progress
■
Projects that “depend on you to save them”
■
Projects that appear to have political problems
■
Projects that have no meaningful organizational support
One common problem is that a conﬁdent or experienced IT project manager
may think,“I can ﬁx this,” especially if you have a knack for ﬁxing problems in pro-
jects. However, to step into a troubled project is really a huge career risk for several
reasons.You could be being set up to fail, either intentionally or not.You could be
saddled with a terrible project that will prevent you from working on a project that
could be successful and add value to the company and to your career.You could
become so mired in this troubled project that you get pigeon-holed and moved off
into some obscure career corner of your company.
Possible solutions: Though it may sound deceptively simple, the best solution
is to avoid these projects whenever possible. Keep your ego in check and don’t rush
in to save the day. Instead, look for opportunities to apply your skills and expertise to
a new project so you can build it properly from the ground up. If you do get saddled
with one of these impossible projects, follow these guidelines to help maintain your
sanity and your sterling reputation:

Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

■
Don’t overcommit. Promise less than you think you can deliver across the
board. Unfortunately, even these scaled-down commitments may end up
being ambitious.
■
Don’t commit to any project parameters until you’re conﬁdent they’re cor-
rect.That includes scope, time, cost, and quality, as well as functional and
technical requirements.
■
Present your worst-case, most pessimistic scenarios and estimates. Normally
this is not a wise course of action because you want to be viewed as an IT
PM who can come up with accurate estimates. However, when dealing
with an impossible project, your worst-case scenario is most likely correct
or not close to bad enough. Don’t compound the issues in this project by
taking a more moderate view of things.
■
Identify where this project ﬁts into corporate goals and priorities. If it’s not
a high enough priority or if it’s not aligned to corporate goals, try to per-
suade the powers that be to cancel the project or redesign it.
■
Find ways to get others to have a vested interest in the outcome.There is
power in numbers and if you can get enough inﬂuential people to have a
vested interest in the project results, you might then ﬁnd enough organiza-
tional clout to actually get the project moving in the right direction. If
you’re the only one with “skin in the game” you’re in a very risky position
and it will be your career, and yours alone, that tanks if things go bad.

Summary
In this chapter, we looked at additional tools for tracking and managing your IT
project.The more technical metrics that can be used, such as Earned Value Analysis,
are often avoided by even experienced project managers. Sometimes its because the
process of gather the numbers for analysis is too cumbersome, but often times it’s
because in the heat of managing the project, these tools are forgotten. Using EVA
and the related metrics including SPI, CPI, and CR can help you communicate pro-
ject health to your sponsor or to your executive team. It helps you avoid discussing
details at great length and gives you a quick birds’ eye view of the project. Like any
numbers or metrics, the data can be manipulated or used in unintended ways, but
when used appropriately, they can help you better manage your project and forecast
future results more accurately.
Testing is another part of tracking and controlling your project.Testing occurs at
various stages of project work and there are many different kinds of testing used in
IT projects, depending on the nature of the project itself.A solid testing plan can
help ﬁnd problems earlier in the work cycle and problems are less difﬁcult and less
expensive to ﬁx earlier in the project than when they’re found at the end of project
work or when found by the user.
IT projects typically have external plans that have to sync up to them including
implementation or deployment plans, support plans, or operational transfer plans. If
these tasks are not part of your formal IT project, it’s important to keep the people
involved with these external plans up to date regarding your project’s progress.
Changes in your project’s deliverables, scope or schedule can greatly impact these
related plans. Developing a communication channel with these external projects can
help make sure everyone is on the same page and that all expectations regarding
deliverables and timelines are clear and unambiguous.
A detailed and well executed handoff plan help promote a positive perception of
the project. It sends the signal that you managed the project well throughout the
lifecycle.The user will judge the success of the project in large part through the
handoff experience, so it’s important to do this well.
There are all kinds of problems that can occur in managing your IT project,
many of which can be prevented or minimized simply by using the project manage-
ment methods we’ve discussed throughout this book. Problems will still crop up,
even in the best planned projects, so we discussed the kinds of problems and possible
solutions to a whole host of problems. By understanding what kinds of problems can
crop up, you may be able to avoid some of these problems. If not, you can refer to
this section to get ideas for resolving problems that sneak up on you and threaten
your project’s success.

 Earned value analysis (EVA) is a method of assessing project progress using
calculations involving planned and actual work progress metrics.
 Planned Value (PV) is deﬁned as the planned percent complete times the
total project budget.
 Earned Value (EV) is deﬁned as the actual percent complete times the total
project budget.
 The Cost Variance (CV) is deﬁned as the earned value minus the actual
cost.
 The Schedule Variance (SV) is deﬁned as the earned value minus the
planned value.
 The Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is calculated by dividing earned
value by planned value (PV).
 The Cost Performance Index (CPI) is calculated by dividing the earned
value by the actual cost.
 The Estimate At Completion (EAC) is determined by dividing the total
project budget by the cost performance index.

 The Critical Ratio (CR) is calculated by multiplying the SPI by the CPI.
 An SPI value of greater than 1 indicates your project is ahead of schedule.
A value of less than of 1 indicates your project is behind schedule.
 If your schedule gets off track, you may choose to carry the deﬁcit (or
surplus) forward or use your schedule reserve.
 A CPI value of greater than 1 indicates your project is under budget.A
value of less than of 1 indicates your project is over budget.
 If your cost gets off track, you may choose to carry the deﬁcit (or surplus)
forward or use your budget reserve.
 Estimate At Completion uses the cost performance index and the total
project budget to determine a new estimate for the real cost of the project
at completion.
 EAC can be used to determine whether or what a project should (or can)
go forward.A project estimated to be too far over budget at completion
may be cancelled.
 The Critical Ratio can be used to gain an overall understanding of project
progress and can be used to effectively communicate progress with upper
management.
Testing Project Deliverables
 Unit testing is often performed on project deliverables as soon as they are
ready. Integration testing tests the performance of multiple project
deliverables to determine how (and if) they work together in an integrated
fashion.
 The person performing the work should perform some type of unit testing
as part of the task to ensure the scope and quality requirements are met.
 Usability testing is typically performed in a controlled environment to
ensure the project results are usable from a customer/user perspective.
 Acceptance testing is used to determine whether or not the user will
accept project deliverables.The functional speciﬁcations are typically tested
in acceptance testing.

 Beta testing occurs when the product is in the ﬁnal stages and is close to
release. Beta testing can turn up major (show stopper) and minor (revision)
errors and defects.
 Beta testing may include some form of user testing in their environment to
test functionality.
 Regression testing is performed after errors and defects have been
identiﬁed and reworked. Regression testing is done to ensure that no new
errors or defects have been created as a result of addressing earlier errors.
 Performance testing can include stress, load, reliability, and stability testing
to ensure the project’s deliverables can work in real-world conditions.
 Benchmark testing tests hardware and software against deﬁned standards.
 Security testing ensures the project’s deliverables meet security
requirements. One element of security testing is to make sure that if
attacked, the project’s deliverables respond appropriately to avoid providing
additional information to intruders.
 Security testing is often outsourced to get a fresh set of expert eyes looking
for security weaknesses.
Preparing for Implementation,
Deployment and Operational Transfer
 An implementation plan describes steps to be taken to install or implement
the project’s deliverables.
 A deployment plan describes steps to be taken to deploy the solution across
the enterprise.
 In some cases, the implementation and deployment plans are one and the
same.
 Both implementation and deployment plans should include rollback plans
in case things go wrong.The original state should be deﬁned so rollback
can occur.
 Operational transfer is the process of permanently handing off operations of
the project’s deliverables.
 A well written operational transfer plan will follow the same steps as an IT
project plan to avoid errors and omissions.
www.syngress.com
Tracking IT Projects • Chapter 11

 Training, support documents, users guides, release notes, and Service Level
Agreements should all be deﬁned within the operational transfer plan.
Resolving Common Project Problems
 Problems with scope include vague scope, scope not feasible, errors in
approach, and scope creep.
 Problems with quality include initial results failing to meet quality
standards, work delivered outside the scope of the project, ﬁxing the wrong
problems, problems that reappear, and problems that cannot be resolved.
 Problems with schedule include late start, missed deadline or deliverable,
everything on the critical path, and nothing on the critical path.
 Problems with budget include funds expended up front, assets moved off
project, too many approval points, and shrinkage.
 Problems with staff include confusion over who’s in charge of project staff,
whiners, big biters, belt and suspenders, and interpersonal conﬂict.
 Problems with the project sponsor include lengthy reporting requirements,
rehashing previous decisions, inability to schedule project review meetings,
and pressure to complete the project faster, for less money or with more
scope.
 Problems with vendors include late delivery, unacceptable quality, and poor
communications.
 Problems with customers/users/stakeholders include users not being
pleased with project results, changing user requirements, picking and
choosing among deliverables, and setting impossible demands.

Q: Why don’t you use the PMBOK acronyms for EVA and other technical 
analysis?
A: The material we presented adheres to PMI standards and material presented
in the PMBOK with one notable exception—the letters we use to indicate
the various measurements. In our opinion, it’s easier to remember what two
letters stand for and the point of the material was to make it highly useable
for you. If you’re concerned with passing a formal certiﬁcation exam, you
should adhere to the PMBOK standards. If your concern is simply your
ability to use these metrics, stick to the two-letter system so you’ll be more
likely to remember (and therefore, use) these metrics.
Q: If my project is under budget but behind schedule, my project could still be
in trouble. Using the metrics provided in this chapter, I could come up with
a ratio of close to 1 that would indicate my project was just ﬁne.Any com-
ment?
A: It’s true that when using ratios, you’re dividing one number by another and
in some cases, their equal and opposite deviations from 1 can offset each
other. In the case you describe, you stated that your project was under budget
(ratio > 1) and your schedule was behind (ratio < 1). While these might
offset, you know going into this analysis that you are under budget and
behind schedule.That information alone helps you better manage your pro-
ject.These numbers can’t manage your project for you nor can they think for
you (though we all sometimes wish they could), but they can help guide you
toward understanding where your project risks are, what your overall project
health is, and help you focus in on the problem areas. Using your scenario,
you can look at your budget variance and assume it is because you are
behind schedule. However, you may be behind schedule because of a
problem making approved budget expenditures. If you can’t spend your

Understanding where you are helps you understand what to do to ﬁx prob-
lems that arise and these metrics are just one of many tools you can use to
manage your IT project.
Q: It never fails that our development and testing teams do a great job but com-
pletely disregard our deployment team’s deadlines and deliverables.This leaves
the deployment team swinging in the wind and having to deal with angry or
frustrated users.Any suggestions?
A: This is a serious problem that requires resolution because over time, your
company will lose credibility with users.There are a few different ways you
can address this, depending on the people involved, the customers, the pro-
ject, and the corporate culture in which you’re working. One way to work
on this is to get engineers and testers in front of users or customers.
Engineers and testing engineers can become a bit isolated from the real
world application and getting them out of their ofﬁces and onto a user site
and be a real eye opener.Another possible solution is to bring this to your
project sponsor for escalation. Remember that your testers’ goals are to ﬁnd
issues early in the cycle and send them back for repair before the project is
released to the user. Code (or other work) with lots of problems is not the
fault of the tester, though the tester sometimes gets blamed for delayed or
missed project deadlines. Meeting deadlines for deliverables is everyone’s
responsibility and the team must work together to make sure all phases run
smoothly.The developer and testing teams need to be held accountable not
only for deadlines and deliverables on their own work, but for working
cooperatively as part of a larger team to help the company succeed. Every
time your deployment team has to backpedal with the customer, your entire
company suffers. While it may sound a bit dramatic, everyone’s jobs depend
upon satisﬁed customers so the developers and testers are putting everyone’s
jobs at risk by ignoring deployment deadlines. On the ﬂip side of that coin,
the deployment team needs to communicate effectively with the developers
and test engineers.That means listening to what is and is not possible,
working together to create realistic schedules and negotiating to ﬁnd mutu-
ally satisfactory and realistic goals.

Chapter 11 • Tracking IT Projects

Q: We work with external vendors on a lot of our IT projects. Most of them
don’t use formal project management. Do you have any suggestions for how
to get them on board with our IT PM process?
A: That’s a great question.Your vendors do not need to use project manage-
ment methods in order for you to work successfully with them. However,
once they begin to see the power of IT PM in the way you handle your pro-
jects, they may start showing interest in your processes and procedures. Until
that happens, you can clearly set up processes and procedures for working
with your vendors.Those procedures may include contractual (legal) ele-
ments, but at minimum, you should specify the vendor contact, vendor deliv-
erables, vendor schedule, vendor cost, and vendor quality metrics (scope, time,
cost, quality).This will help keep communications with your vendors clear,
concise, and focused. It should ultimately help them do their job better
because they won’t have to second guess what you want or spend an inordi-
nate amount of time trying to ﬁgure out how to meet your needs.A good
vendor relationship is a two-way street, so you may need to adjust a few of
your project’s processes to accommodate a vendor’s needs, if appropriate.
Over time, the vendor will likely see the beneﬁts of your IT PM process and
may even inquire as to what system or methodology you use. Sharing your
process will help your vendor do a better job and create a positive win-win
relationship.
Q: My project sponsor almost always pushes me to deliver faster, better, cheaper.
Despite my repeated discussions with my sponsor, this never seems to change.
Can you provide any advice to help me out?
A: Some project sponsors seem to think that if they don’t put the constant
squeeze on you that you won’t turn in your best work. If that’s the nature of
this problem, you may want to have a candid conversation with your sponsor
and let him or her know that you are constantly working as hard as you can
and that pushing you harder only adds stress.The project sponsor may be
unaware that his or her actions are perceived as pushing (they might think
they’re encouraging or coaching) and they may change their approach. If the
project sponsor is pushing because they really do need the project faster,
better, or cheaper, you may want to ask the sponsor what changed since the
original project deﬁnition (which they signed off on).This may cause them
to realize that the project is on target and they’re just getting jumpy.You may
want to communicate more proactively with your sponsor if this is the case,
www.syngress.com
Tracking IT Projects • Chapter 11
519

because he or she may not feel they’re getting enough current information so
they push you. Sometimes a pushy project sponsor makes us retreat because
we don’t want to deal with the constant push and that can result in less fre-
quent or less meaningful project communication.This leads the sponsor to
get even jumpier and pushier and the cycle escalates. Don’t allow the sponsor
to bully you into creating a project plan that is better, faster, cheaper, and
unrealistic. If you commit to a plan, make sure you’re fairly conﬁdent you can
deliver. If forced to commit to the better, faster, cheaper plan, make sure you
document your concerns and reservations. Document what you believe the
risks to the project are in this approach. Finally, if you continually have a
problem with the sponsor pushing for better, faster, cheaper on every project
you do, even after he or she has signed off on the project plan, learn to
ignore those pushes and continue project work at the agreed upon
pace…either that or ﬁnd a new project sponsor who better understands the
role of project sponsor.

Introduction
Before you pop the champagne cork and begin your celebration dance, you have a
few more details to attend to. In this chapter, we’ll look at project close-out activi-
ties. While you might think these are “throw away” activities that are optional,
they’re really not.Through properly closing out the project, you ensure users are sat-
isﬁed and that the deployment, maintenance, and support activities are set up or in
place.You also complete project documentation including updating ﬁnal stats, and
calculating total schedule, effort (hours expended), cost, and other project metrics.
You wind down project activities and announce closure. Finally, you provide feed-
back to your team and an opportunity to wind down the team on a positive note.
While you might be exhausted by this time in your project, reserve just a bit
more energy for properly closing out the project.Two things about project closure
are absolutely true. It’s a thousand times easier to do it now than in a month when
your boss hounds you incessantly for the data and you can get your project team to
help you close up shop so you can all go celebrate together.
As with previous chapters, let’s look at the IT project management process
overview and where we currently stand.This is shown in Figure 12.1 and indicates
we’re in the last phase of the project management process.This is important to keep
in mind because close out is part of the IT PM process, not an annoying add-on.

phase related to project deliverables.The project plan should be a living,
breathing document and it should be kept relatively up to date throughout
the project work cycle.The current project data is an input and during this
phase, we’ll ﬁnalize that data.
2.
ACTION  The actions in this close-out phase are related to updating pro-
ject data and documentation, making sure that deliverables are formally
accepted and that the ongoing operations or support processes are in place.
Lessons learned are captured and reviewed before performing ﬁnal team
activities.

PROJECT TERMINATION This marks the formal completion and end
of your IT project.
Closing Out Project Activities
There are a number of project activities that require ﬁnalization or close-out once
project work is completed.These include closing out the project issues log,
addressing lingering change requests or work orders, and dealing with bug reports.
Issues Log
Despite your best efforts, it’s likely there will be issues on your issues log that are
pending or still open.The ﬁrst question you should ask is: Is the project really com-
plete? In some cases, an issue left open means that one or more deliverables might be
incomplete or not up to quality standards. However, in most cases, leftover issues
(whether pending or open) can indicate issues that were indirectly related to the
tasks such as an ongoing issue with a tracking system or with a vendor.These issues
may not ultimately impact the scope, time, cost, or quality of the project, but at the
time they were raised, someone believed the issue was important enough to track it.
Hold a ﬁnal issues log review meeting and look through all issues that are either
pending or open (that is, all issues not closed).As a team, decide what to do with
each issue. Some issues simply may not have been updated, while other issues may
have resolved themselves. Other issues may require follow up and some issues may
simply be irrelevant at this point. Don’t just assume that the items on the issues list
are irrelevant because you’ve determined the project is complete. Go through each
line item and make a deﬁnitive decision about the issue. If it is no longer relevant,
close it as unresolved with brief comments to note that no action was taken but that
you are closing the issue.Your issues log should end up with no open issues at the
end of this session.Any issues that the team feels should remain open should be
transferred to some other tracking system so the issues log can be ﬁnalized and doc-
umented.The reason for this is simple—no one, including you, is likely to look at
the issues log for a project that is complete. Rather than losing important issues that
may still need to be addressed (a vendor issue, a corporate accounting issue, etcetera),
transfer it to a more appropriate venue for resolution now that the project is
winding down.

Change Requests/ Work Orders
It would be odd to ﬁnd open change requests or work orders when your project
work is complete, but it does happen. Review any open change requests or work
orders to determine if your project work truly is complete or not.As with the issues
log, review all open orders and determine why they’re open. Some may be open
only because the documentation hasn’t caught up yet and the issue is resolved.
Others may cause you to look more closely at project deliverables to make sure
everything is in order.As with the issues log, don’t just leave these items hanging.
Close them with a notation as to why they were not addressed in the project. In
some cases, these items may cause charge backs to the project (the client reducing
the fee they’ll pay you because some portion of work was not included in the ﬁnal
deliverable).
Bug Reports
Bug reports are like the issues log with one major exception.The development team
may choose to defer ﬁxing some bugs to later versions or releases.Therefore, it is
critical that all open or pending bugs be updated (where applicable) and transferred
to the bug tracking system for safekeeping. When the next round of development
ﬁres up, these bugs should be readily available so the functional and technical speciﬁ-
cations can be written to address the most urgent (or desirable) bug ﬁxes.
Preparing Final Documentation
At the end of each project, there are numerous project documents that should be
prepared including a ﬁnalized project plan, variance reports, support or training doc-
uments, and more. Here’s a list of some of the types of documentation you may need
to prepare:
■
Project reports and documentation
■
Project closure report
■
System and conﬁguration documentation
■
Program code
■
Instruction manuals
■
Training manuals
■
User documentation
www.syngress.com
526
Chapter 12 • Closing Out IT Projects

■
Test criteria and results
■
Regulatory information (test and results documents proving conformity to
legal speciﬁcations, etc.)
■
Acceptance or product certiﬁcation
This list is not exhaustive but should clue you in to the types of documentation
you should prepare as you close out your report.As we’ve discussed previously, it’s
always easier to document these things as quickly as possible so you don’t have to
expend tremendous effort later trying to remember project detail and ﬁll in the gaps.
In some cases, there may be legal requirements for the timing of these documents, so
keep those in mind as you move forward.
In addition, there are probably different formats you’ll need to use to distribute
these documents. Here’s a starter list to get you thinking about the possibilities:
■
Printed hard copy
■
Soft copy (network location with link, e-mail attachment)
■
DVD or CD
■
PowerPoint or multimedia presentations
■
Online documentation (Adobe’s PDF is a popular format for this) for
downloading, viewing, and printing
■
Help ﬁles and FAQs (within the product or online)
■
FTP sites (for downloads)
■
Video, audio, Web conferencing
■
Intranets and extranets
Take a look at your communication plan and determine who needs which doc-
uments and what type of project close-out communication is appropriate for the
various stakeholders.You might need to create a formal report for your project
sponsor or develop a presentation for corporate executives.Think about all the
people you need to communicate with and which method of communication will
be most convenient for them. Remember that project success is determined, in part,
by the perception of success so use this communication opportunity to create a posi-
tive impression of your project outcomes.
www.syngress.com
Closing Out IT Projects • Chapter 12
527

Technical Documentation
For IT projects, system and conﬁguration documentation is critical.The internal
deployment/support team or an external vendor (to whom operations are trans-
ferred) will need this information.To develop appropriate documentation, ﬁrst deter-
mine who the intended audience is for each type of documentation. Look at the
user environment to determine the best format and method of distribution. If in
doubt, ask. For instance, it wouldn’t make sense for you to create Help ﬁles and FAQ
on a website if none of the users have Internet access.Assign owners for these tasks
(if this falls within your project area) and make sure these documents are generated.
If preparation of these documents is outside your area, be sure to keep your IT pro-
ject team in the loop so they can provide information to the folks preparing the
documentation.There are three primary types of IT projects and each has slightly
different documentation needs: software development, desktop applications, and net-
work infrastructure.
Software Development Projects
The program code itself must be thoroughly documented along with the versions of
any plug-ins or external applications used.The conﬁguration of the operating system
the code has been tested on and the version and conﬁguration information about
any other software used in the development, testing, or support of the product
should be documented. Relevant backup and recovery procedures should also be
documented where needed. If bug ﬁxes were included, the bug numbers and
descriptions should be listed. If any temporary workarounds were included, those
should also be documented along with notes about how to unwind those changes.
Desktop Applications
Documentation about the applications licensing, versions, conﬁgurations, and images
(disk images, often referred to as ghost images), as well as conﬁguration and images of
the operating system should be prepared. If any workarounds are required, these
should be noted along with how to back out of the workarounds once a ﬁx is
installed.
Network Infrastructure
Documentation should include version and conﬁguration information for all rele-
vant network infrastructure components such as network servers, application servers,
Web servers, print servers, routers, gateways, ﬁrewalls, proxy servers, wireless access
points, etc. Include any unique information regarding these components such as
www.syngress.com
528
Chapter 12 • Closing Out IT Projects

order of start up or shut down or special steps needed to properly install, conﬁgure,
troubleshoot, or maintain this equipment. Backup and recovery procedures should
also be well documented (and tested). Record currently installed ﬁrmware versions
and workarounds, if used. Where applicable, also provide diagrams and/or updated
blueprints showing network conﬁguration such as subnets, cabling, router conﬁgura-
tion, etc.
Final, Updated Project Plan
The project plan that you’ve used throughout this project to help you stay on course
should be fairly up to date with the latest versions of schedule, budget, variances,
issues logs, and whatever else you included in your project plan.Take time to gather
the ﬁnal data for the project and update the project plan one last time.This will
enable you to ﬁnalize numbers in terms of plan versus actual.This data will be
needed both for the project closure report (see next section) and for your communi-
cations with your project sponsor, stakeholders, or corporate executives. Have the
team look at the project schedule and budget reserves to determine how close (or
far) your estimates were from actual.This is a great opportunity to improve your
estimating skills through examining planned estimates versus actual, looking at how
you calculated reserves, understanding how reserves were used, and learning what
you can do better next time.
Project Closure Report
You should prepare a project closure report.This report should be distributed to the
project sponsor, appropriate stakeholders, and key corporate executives (if appro-
priate).This report should adhere to the following guidelines:
1.
Include a brief statement of project background and objectives.
2.
List members of the project team and contributors including name, depart-
ment, title, project role, and next project assignment (where applicable).
3.
State reason for project closure (completion, postponement, cancellation).
4.
List planned and actual project deliverables. Discuss the gaps, if any.
5.
List planned and actual project schedule. Brieﬂy discuss changes that
impacted ﬁnal delivery date.
6.
List planned and actual project budget. Brieﬂy discuss any variances.
7.
Identify project ROI (return on investment), if possible.
8.
List any outstanding risks as well as related contingency plans, if applicable.
www.syngress.com
Closing Out IT Projects • Chapter 12
529

9.
Include a summary of lessons learned (discussed later in this chapter).
10.
Discuss methods or processes developed during the project that could
(should) be reused and why.
11.
Discuss external (organizational, departmental, procedural) limitations or
problems that impacted the project and provide suggestions for improve-
ment.
12.
Identify ongoing support or maintenance needs, plans for or status of oper-
ational transfer.
13.
If needed, identify next steps.This might include moving onto the next
phase of a multi-phased project, ﬁling required legal documentation (copy-
rights, patents, conformance to regulatory requirements, etc.), or moving
any open tasks to a post-deployment plan.
14.
Obtain formal project closure approval from the project sponsor.
A project closure report is a summary of the entire project at a high level.Avoid
delving into detail in this report.The updated project plan should include all the pro-
ject detail and this data should not be simply copied and pasted into the project clo-
sure report.Think of this report as a summary that you could look back over in a
few years. It will tell you all the salient information about the project without
delving into detail that in two or three years will be completely irrelevant to you.
One important note here—if a project is cancelled, it’s especially important to
formalize the close-out so that you and all those involved are aware the project was
cancelled and not just forgotten. Projects are cancelled for many reasons, some of
which we’ve discussed throughout this book. If your project is cancelled, go through
the project closure report process to document the project and to obtain formal
approval to cancel the project.This avoids the type of miscommunication where per-
haps you thought you were told to cancel the project but were, in fact, told to put it
on hold temporarily. It also should capture the reason for canceling the project and
on whose authority. If someone comes back to second-guess this decision, it should
be well documented and defensible.
Final Project Sign-Off
Before you get too antsy to move on, remember that you need to obtain ﬁnal pro-
ject sign-off and transfer any operational, support, or training issues to the respon-
sible parties. Let’s look at these brieﬂy.
www.syngress.com
530
Chapter 12 • Closing Out IT Projects

Formal Project Sign-Off
Formal sign-off is truly the end of the project. In a sense, the work’s not done ‘til the
project sponsor says so.Typically, you should present the project sponsor with your
project closure report, an updated copy of the project plan (if appropriate or
required), and obtain formal agreement the project is complete.
What if the project sponsor does not agree with you that the project is com-
plete? There are several steps you can take to address this scenario.
1.
Accept project with variance noted.
2.
Accept project with compensation to user/customer/sponsor for omissions
or variances.
3.
Continue project work until variances are addressed.
Clearly you want to avoid any of these scenarios because it means that some-
where along the line, something was misunderstood or miscommunicated. If you
discovered open change requests or work orders (discussed earlier), you may have
realized too late that there were portions of the deliverables missing.This means
there is a gap in your project management process that you should ﬁnd and repair.
However, it doesn’t have to mean the end of the world either. Work with your pro-
ject sponsor (who is sometimes an external customer paying for the project) to
deﬁne acceptable next steps, generate a plan for accomplishing those next steps, and
move along. It might be a bit deﬂating to think you’re ﬁnished only to have another
“to do” list, but it happens. When you move into a brand new house, you often go
through and ﬁnd things that need to be ﬁnished.This is often called a punch list, not
because it makes you want to punch the wall (though it might), but because each
item is “punched” as it is completed.The same may be required in some IT projects
though the goal is to have a clean ﬁnish with no additional “to do” items. If you dis-
cover additional items, it’s very important to ﬁgure out where you went wrong, not
to blame the guilty parties, but to discover how you can ﬁx your process to prevent
this type of error in the future.
Operational Transfer
The process of transferring responsibility to another party for project deliverables
should be well planned.This improves the perception of quality of your project and
helps make everyone’s life easier.Think about the last time you bought a new car. If
the dealer just pulled the new car out of the lot (dust, window smudges, windows
stickers, and all) and tossed you the car keys, you probably would have wondered about
the car, the dealer, and the quality. On the other hand, most dealers make a big deal
www.syngress.com
Closing Out IT Projects • Chapter 12
531

out of delivering the car. It’s washed, polished, the windows are clean, the tires inﬂated,
the tank is full, and they sit you down and explain every last detail of how the car
works (most of which you promptly forget because you really can’t wait to get behind
the wheel).This whole experience can add to or detract from your car buying experi-
ence just as the project handoff can. Remember, throughout this book we’ve discussed
best practices to give you the knowledge to deliver the best IT project you can. It’s not
always this tidy in the real world, but it’s what you should aim for.
In Chapter 11, we discussed preparing for operational transfer as part of your
managing, tracking, and completing project work. Earlier in this chapter, we dis-
cussed some of the documentation you might need for a smooth transfer. Now, let’s
look at some of the steps you can take to successfully hand off the project. Some of
these steps should have been completed during project work.This list is a checklist
you can use to be sure you have all your bases covered:
■
Begin with a ﬁnal operational test to make sure everything actually is com-
plete and in working order.
■
Identify your contact point for operational transfer so you can coordinate
the transfer of information and processes.
■
Develop warranty information (express, implied) and how warranty issues
will be handled.
■
Develop documentation detailing ownership of copyrights or other intel-
lectual property.You may need your corporate attorney to draw up these
documents on behalf of your company.
■
Contact the Training department to determine training needs.This might
include train-the-trainer sessions, support documentation, or other assis-
tance in deﬁning and developing training materials.
■
Clearly document who is responsible for operations, support, ﬁxes, warranty
issues, etc. Using the is/is not framework we used to deﬁne scope earlier in
the book can be helpful to avoid making incorrect assumptions about roles
and responsibilities.
■
Formally transfer code, conﬁguration, and other relevant documentation to
your contact.
■
Set a transfer date and develop speciﬁc transfer procedures with your con-
tact, if needed.
■
Communicate the transfer date to all relevant parties including project
sponsor, stakeholders, and the project team.
www.syngress.com
532
Chapter 12 • Closing Out IT Projects

■
Perform any other activities that may have been contractually listed as
handoff items (usually this is with external, paying customers).
■
Manage user/customer/client perception.The perception of success has
been built throughout your project, so be sure to end on a high note. Make
the handoff a more visible affair by having a walkthrough, a demonstration,
or a ribbon cutting ceremony. Making the handoff a more formal, visible
affair helps build a positive perception of the project and the competence
of your project team. If possible and appropriate, think of an innovative,
interesting way to formalize the handoff so your user/customer/client
remembers it in a positive light.
Cheat Sheet…
Project Audit
Whether or not your company requires a project audit, it’s a good habit to get
into following the completion of a project. An audit is an examination of the pro-
ject’s goals, achievements, deliverables, and metrics. It examines compliance with
scope, time, cost, and quality requirements. It measures variance from functional
and technical speciﬁcations. It documents ﬁnal variance in terms of schedule,
cost, and scope. It’s a good habit to get into, but it should not turn into a major
ﬂog-fest. Problems will always crop up in a project, which is why every project
has a project manager. Your job is to do your best to guide the project to suc-
cessful completion through often treacherous terrain. Taking the opportunity to
audit your project will build strong IT PM muscles. No pain, no gain.
Dispose of Project Assets
During the course of your project, you may have acquired various tangible assets.
That might include chairs, tables, desks, computers, lab or test equipment, temporary
ofﬁce space, etc.At this point, you should determine the status of all project assets
and the appropriate disposition of those assets. Here’s a partial list to get you started:
■
Pack up and vacate temporary ofﬁce space.
■
Pack up and vacate temporary conference rooms.
■
Pack up and vacate labs or other temporary project space.
www.syngress.com
Closing Out IT Projects • Chapter 12
533

■
Clean up after yourselves in all of the temporary locations you occupied
(no sense in ruining your reputation at this late date).
■
Properly dispose of unneeded project documentation through shredding or
other appropriate disposal mechanisms (if documents are part of legal or
regulatory requirements, ﬁle and store them appropriately).
■
Dispose of (transfer, sell, reassign) hard assets including servers, desktops,
laptops, cell phones, PDAs, test equipment, or any other equipment
acquired speciﬁcally for the project.
Review Lessons Learned
We’ve emphasized lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle because capturing
what you’ve learned as you go is the most efﬁcient and effective method by far.The
lessons learned meeting should be somewhat informal and should not devolve into a
project audit. Have everyone gather their lessons learned (if you have not been gath-
ering these in a centralized location periodically throughout the project) and have
everyone prepare a brief presentation (5 minutes) to discuss the most important or
useful lesson learned, the craziest lesson learned, etc. Compile and discuss the lessons
learned, including what worked and what didn’t work, which might include:
■
Project deﬁnition process
■
Project organizing process
■
Project planning process
■
Project execution 
■
Project scope, schedule, budget, and quality
■
Project communications
■
Project controls
■
Project documentation
■
Project tools or technology 
■
Project ofﬁce, location, amenities, etc.
Do not allow the session to spiral down into a blame session. Share what worked
and what didn’t work. Focus on the behaviors, processes, outcome, and problems, not
speciﬁc people or personalities.Take this to the next level and get the team to dis-
www.syngress.com
534
Chapter 12 • Closing Out IT Projects

cuss how these lessons learned can be incorporated in the future. It’s not enough to
simply list what you’ve “learned”—the real learning comes from understanding how
that information can be applied in the future. When well managed, this session can
be interesting, enlightening, and extremely useful. Once you’ve talked through your
lessons learned, capture the ﬁnal data and include it in a document to be included in
the ﬁnal project plan.This will help IT teams on future projects and will provide
practical historical data for planning, estimating and managing future projects.
The IT Factor…
How Organizations Learn
If you’ve ever worked in an organization that learns from its mistakes and gets
better at what it does, you know what an energizing work environment that can
be. “Companies that value organizational learning not only tend to become more
successful over time, they attract and retain talented individuals,” explains Dr.
Gary J. Frost, Vice Chancellor at National University. “Organizational learning
takes many forms but the common element is the desire to learn in order to gen-
erate optimal results. For employees, it can create a positive and motivating
atmosphere in which to work. For organizations, it can create a more competi-
tive position in the marketplace by continually improving products, services and
processes.”
Administrative Closure 
Administrative closure is catchy term used for doing the paperwork. We all know that
most projects are not considered complete until several reams of paper have been
printed, forms have been ﬁlled out in triplicate, and fourteen ﬁle boxes have been
ﬁlled with documents we’ll never look at again. OK, that’s the downside view.The
upside is that there are important documents that are actually useful that should be
completed during project close-out. We’ll look at the common categories, but your
organization will no doubt have additional or different requirements for paperwork.
Create a list of required paperwork as you begin your close-out process (you can
deﬁne it in your processes and procedures during your project organization phase if
you’re really on top of things). Past projects may give you some insight into what to
use, but remember that past projects may not have used a solid project management
www.syngress.com
Closing Out IT Projects • Chapter 12
535

methodology and might be incomplete from your new IT project management per-
spective. If you’ve been keeping your project data up to date, you shouldn’t have
much difﬁculty completing the administrative closure activities.Any shared team
project data on network servers, drives, or intranet locations should be removed,
archived, or deleted, as appropriate. Don’t leave a physical or electronic mess behind.
Security
Make sure you address all security issues.The rule of thumb in any kind of security
is grant enough to get the job done (and not a speck more). In the case of your project,
additional permissions may have been granted and wherever possible, those special
permissions should be revoked at project closure. If your team was granted special
building or network access, that access should be revoked (unless it’s still needed and
appropriate). If your team was granted special access passes, passwords, or access to
sensitive or conﬁdential data, need for this access should be reviewed and, where
appropriate, revoked.As you know, most network break-ins or compromise of conﬁ-
dential data happens from the inside of companies, so be sure to restore appropriate
security permissions to project team members to avoid creating security gaps.
Paperwork
The kinds of paperwork you should complete at this point will vary from company
to company and from IT project to IT project.To get you started, here is a general
list of paperwork you may want to complete as you close out your project:
■
Gather, organize, and ﬁle (or archive soft copies) of all project status reports
sent to you by your team.
■
Gather, organize, and ﬁle (or archive) of all project progress reports sent to
your project sponsor.
■
Finalize and ﬁle (or archive) the ﬁnal, updated project report.
■
Complete performance reviews (discussed in the next section) and dis-
tribute to appropriate personnel (team member’s managers, HR depart-
ment, etc).
■
Complete and submit ﬁnal project time cards or time tracking information.
■
Ensure all billing for the project is complete including receipt and payment
of vendor invoices and receipt of payment for project invoices (when an
external customer is being billed, for instance).
■
Close out project contracts with vendors and suppliers.
www.syngress.com
536
Chapter 12 • Closing Out IT Projects

■
Complete paperwork for the transfer or disposition of project hard assets
such as test equipment or other physical resources.
■
Assist in any post-project audits (ﬁnancial, legal, process, regulatory, investor,
etc).
Proper Disposition of Paperwork
File ﬁnal copies of project plans and related paperwork.Think twice before shred-
ding documents. If you’re conﬁdent they are no longer needed, will not be needed
in the event of a lawsuit or other legal action, and if they’re sensitive or conﬁdential
in nature, they’re good candidates for shredding. Consult with your ﬁrm’s legal
counsel before shredding documents if you’re not sure. Shredding documents to
cover your tracks is often illegal and almost certainly unwise.A great question to ask
yourself is: would you do this if you knew you would get caught? If the answer is
no, you probably shouldn’t do it.That includes entering false or misleading data in
reports, changing data after the fact, and shredding certain documents (by the way, if
your company is involved in any kind of lawsuit, talk to your attorney before shred-
ding any documents, even if they’re completely unrelated to the lawsuit. Shredding
can give the appearance of impropriety even where none exists).
In many cases, shredding unneeded documents is just ﬁne and preferable to them
simply being thrown into the trash. For all documents that will be preserved, use
your company’s document management system for storing and archiving documents.
If none exists, you can store your ﬁles in hard or soft copy, but be sure they are well
marked. Include the project name, project manager, project sponsor, client (if any),
dates of the project, brief description of the project, and brief description of the
stored documents. Whatever you do, make sure you ﬁle ﬁnal copies of documents
(mark them as such) so no one is wondering exactly which version is stored. Pick a
system and stick with it or work with the appropriate people at your company to
develop a system for company-wide use.
Regulatory Issues
During the deﬁnition of project speciﬁcations, you may have identiﬁed legal or reg-
ulatory requirements associated with your project. If so, you will probably also have
to ﬁll out paperwork to satisfy these legal or regulatory requirements. For example, if
your project deliverables include shipping technology overseas, you may need to ﬁll
out export paperwork or certiﬁcations regarding the equipment and the legal export
of certain technologies. If your project is subject to legal or regulatory requirements,
you should already be aware of them. Some requirements stipulate project speciﬁca-
www.syngress.com
Closing Out IT Projects • Chapter 12
537

tions or deliverables. Other requirements may simply be end-of-project reporting
requirements. If you’re not completely certain, talk with your project sponsor, legal,
or ﬁnancial advisor about potential requirements. If in doubt, ask. Failing to conform
to requirements can cause massive legal and ﬁnancial problems down the line.
Personnel Performance Reviews
Not all IT project managers will be required by their organizations to provide per-
formance reviews for team members, so this may or may not be part of your project
close-out activities. However, everyone needs feedback about the work they’ve done
and as the IT project manager, you’re in the best position to provide that feedback
from a project perspective. During the organization phase of the project, you deﬁned
various processes and procedures for the team to use. During the planning stage, you
deﬁned the work to be accomplished, the timelines, budgets, deliverables, and quality
required.You have all the elements, then, for providing performance feedback.You
may choose to formalize team performance requirements, especially if you will be
required to conduct a formal performance review at the conclusion of your project.
Check with your HR department regarding an appropriate format and for guide-
lines on conducting the session if you’ve never conducted a performance review
before.There are organizational and legal guidelines that should be followed.
Performance Review Elements
What elements should you include in the performance evaluation? Again, it depends
on how your company runs, and if there is a deﬁned process, you should consider
using that. If none exists or you want to create one speciﬁc to IT projects, here are
some general guidelines:
1.
Team member name, title, role on team, or reason for being selected for the
project.
2.
Date team member started on project.
3.
Date team member ﬁnished on project (or left project).
4.
Primary project role.

costs, and quality.

The IT Factor…
One For All
One company has as part of its performance evaluation criteria the requirement
that a person excel in his or her job and assist others in excelling in theirs. This
dual requirement ensures that teamwork is as valued and rewarded as individual
performance. A strong team is comprised of strong individuals and individuals
should be strengthened by team membership. All for one and one for all.
Delivering Performance Reviews: Below Expectations
Certainly, not all team members will exceed expectations and you’ll need to be pre-
pared to deliver more difﬁcult news to underperformers. One thing that is absolutely
key to a successful performance evaluation, even if the performance was sub-stan-
dard, is that the information in the review should never be a surprise. Performance
should be measured, evaluated, and managed throughout the project cycle.At the
ﬁrst sign of trouble, take steps to manage performance (just as you do with your
project). For instance, let’s say that Alex is a smart, talented, nice guy who thinks that
team meetings are a waste of time.As a result, he skips the second team meeting.
Don’t wait until Alex skips the third and fourth and ﬁfth team meetings to address
this.Team meetings should be productive events (so make sure they are) and Alex’s
absence makes it difﬁcult for the team to form a bond as a team, communicate to
everyone on the team at the same time in the same manner, assign duties based on
team availability, and update team members regarding concerns, issues, or potential
problems.That’s not fair to the rest of the team and allowing this behavior to con-
tinue will demoralize the others (“Alex gets to skip, why should I have to attend?”).
Don’t use the performance review session as the place to address this issue.Talk with
Alex, explain that team meetings are not optional and that should he have to miss a
meeting for a legitimate business need, he should let you know in advance.This nips
the behavior in the bud and lets Alex know that the team is expected to work as a
team and participate as deﬁned in the guidelines for team membership. If Alex’s
behavior continues to be a problem, you should continue to address it.That may
include removing Alex from the team if the behavior continues.At performance

Chapter 12 • Closing Out IT Projects

review time, you will be able to then recap the issues rather than address them for
the ﬁrst time.
Delivering Performance Reviews
During the performance review session, focus on behaviors, work habits, and deliv-
erables. In Alex’s case, you might say,“Your attendance at team meetings was spotty,
you missed 8 team meetings in a six month period. We discussed the importance of
attending and participating in team meetings several times.The below average rating
in this area reﬂects this issue.”That’s clear, unemotional, and states the facts and the
behaviors. Choose language that is not accusing but that clearly states the facts. Don’t
try to sugarcoat them or minimize them. If you’ve addressed Alex’s behavior in the
past, these statements will not come as a surprise. If you hold Alex accountable for
being a responsible team member, he may perform better in the future and become
a star player. If you don’t hold him accountable, his bad behavior will continue.
Keep this in mind as well: Everyone needs to retain their dignity. Unless someone
has willfully been causing problems (in which case you may have removed them from
the team), most people are trying to do the best they can. Factors such as problems
outside of work, health issues, conﬂicting job expectations or requirements, and more
can cause work performance to slip. Provide everyone the ability to retain their dignity
even if you are giving them a “below expectations” review.With practice, you’ll
become more comfortable and competent delivering all kinds of performance reviews,
but if you’re new to this, talk with your HR folks for guidance on how to deliver this
type of review.They can give you tips, help you avoid common pitfalls, and perhaps
most important, provide appropriate language to use during the review.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
The performance evaluation process can be a bit scary for ﬁrst-time
managers or for people who are more often on the receiving end of
reviews. The cardinal rule of any performance evaluation process is that
results should never be a surprise to the person being reviewed. Just as
you don’t wait to the end of the project to determine if your schedule,
budget, and deliverables are on track, you shouldn’t wait until the per-
formance evaluation session to track performance. By deﬁning, moni-
toring, and managing performance throughout the project lifecycle
(sound familiar?), you’ll generate better project results, foster team com-
mitment and high performance, and be respected as the team leader.

Even if your company does not require a formal performance review, you may
choose to sit down with each team member and provide formal or informal feed-
back. Everyone likes to hear how well they did and many people are open to con-
structive feedback so they can grow and learn. Use this opportunity to ﬁnish out
your IT project leadership duties on a strong, positive note.
Final Team Meeting
The ﬁnal team meeting should not be one where you discuss the IT project details.
You should have already covered those issues during meetings to close out the issues
log or update/create project documentation.The ﬁnal team meeting should be used
to help everyone recognize the contribution they made to the team, the project, and
the company. It should be a fun, relaxing time and should be scheduled at a time all
team members can attend. Figure 12.3 shows the ﬂow chart for this process.A
detailed discussion of the ﬂow chart elements follows.

4.
OUTPUTS The outputs from this ﬁnal step in the IT project manage-
ment process are: enjoyment, closure, bragging rights, and great stories to

team will bring the project to a successful end.
5.
NEXT STEPS  The ﬁnal step in this process is to thank everyone for
their diligent efforts and disband the team.
While done in jest, the steps listed above are actually recommended steps to take
with your team.You’ve worked hard, you’ve overcome obstacles individually and as a
team, and you should celebrate your successes.A good leader understands the value
of recognizing individual and group efforts even when things don’t turn out per-
fectly. Focus on the positive during this ﬁnal meeting. Some IT project managers
like to hand out certiﬁcates of recognition, awards for outstanding service, or mone-
tary rewards. If you’re not good at party planning, ﬁnd someone on your team who
is (or get advice from your HR team) and plan a memorable, enjoyable event. Here’s
a quick checklist to help you celebrate in style (for all types of budgets):
■
Go out to lunch as a group (everyone chips in to pay the bill) or have a
potluck.
■
Ask everyone on the team to come to the meeting (lunch, dinner, donuts,
whatever) with a success story, silly story, or “believe it or not” story from
the project.
■
As the IT project manager, prepare a short positive story about every team
member to highlight their work, their personality, or the wins (or losses)
they had during the project.
■
Hand out t-shirts, mugs, toys, prizes, certiﬁcates, and awards. If your budget
can accommodate it (the real reason you try to manage your budget in IT
PM), provide higher-end gifts such as customized jackets, embroidered polo
shirts, sports bags, hats, or cash bonuses.
www.syngress.com
Closing Out IT Projects • Chapter 12
543

■
Arrange for a team outing like going to the movies or bowling as a group.
Make sure all team members will be able to participate in the selected
event.
■
Snap a group photo, (edit in anyone not present for the photo) and dis-
tribute a team photo to everyone on the team. Hang a copy in your ofﬁce
or in an appropriate location in the building.
■
Create a mock newspaper or magazine cover with your team’s “headlines”
on it and distribute to the team. Hang a copy in your ofﬁce or in an appro-
priate location in the building.
■
Get creative, get silly, have fun, recognize and reward your team’s efforts.
Once you’ve held your ﬁnal team celebration, you’re ready to disband the team
and send them on to their next assignment.
As the IT project manager, you’ve had to work hard from start to ﬁnish to steer
this project toward successful conclusion.At times it may have seemed like no one
appreciated your hard work or your role in the success.At other times, it may have
seemed like you were the whipping boy or girl since you seemed to take the heat
no matter what.That’s life as an IT project manager.You’ve got to love the challenge
of organizing and managing all the moving parts.You’ve got to enjoy (and be good
at) communicating with all kinds of people to ﬁnd solutions to problems, middle
ground in standoffs, and resolution in heated arguments.A great IT PM is a strong
leader, negotiator, manager, counselor, accountant, scheduler, mediator, and commu-
nicator. If you bring those skills to the table and apply the techniques and processes
we’ve discussed throughout this book, you’ll be headed for success in the wild,
wooly world of IT project management. With that, we’ll close out this project and
wish you all the success you can handle.
APPLYING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
“Leadership is not about the leader; it is about how the leader builds the
conﬁdence of everyone else. Leaders deliver conﬁdence by espousing
high standards in their messages, exemplifying these standards of con-
duct they model, and establishing formal mechanisms to provide a struc-
ture for acting on those standards.” -Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of
Business Administration, Harvard Business School

Chapter 12 • Closing Out IT Projects

Summary
In this ﬁnal stage of IT project management, the project work is complete and project
activities wind down. Rather than letting them simply fade away, it’s better to formally
close the project out.This will vary from company to company (or IT project to IT
project) and, in some cases, may be dictated by legal or regulatory requirements.
The ﬁrst steps in closing out the project are to make sure all project work is
complete and that any and all open issues are resolved.The issues log, for example,
should be examined and all issues should be given a ﬁnal disposition so nothing is
left hanging.The same holds true for other logs or tracking devices such as change
requests or bug tracking.
The ﬁnal project documentation is important and should be completed in a timely
manner. It might be needed or useful for historical purposes. Many IT project man-
agers go back and review past projects when developing new project plans so they can
use procedures, processes and lessons learned.The documentation might also be
needed for the operational transfer phase or it might be needed for auditing purposes.
Completing it in a timely manner will make the job much easier rather than having to
re-create data and remember facts and ﬁgures long after the project is closed.
The project should also be formally signed off by appropriate parties.This
ensures that everyone is on the same page with regard to project completion, project
deliverables, and next steps. During this phase of work, you might also be preparing,
reviewing, or revising the operational transfer plans so that ongoing support for the
project’s deliverables can be transferred seamlessly.
Hold a lessons learned meeting to gather the lessons learned captured
throughout the project lifecycle.This is an opportunity for the team to share what
they’ve learned and to understand how this new knowledge might be applied.A
good lessons learned meeting is not an hour of ﬁnger-pointing, but instead an
opportunity to learn as a group and grow in your ability to plan and manage IT
projects.
Every company requires a certain amount of paperwork and this should be com-
pleted during the project close-out phase.This might include ﬁnal project time
cards, performance reviews, ﬁnal billing, paperwork to transfer project assets to
another department or division, or ﬁling legal or regulatory paperwork.Also revoke
any unnecessary security permissions or access to maintain tight network and
building security.You should conduct project performance reviews with individual
team members and use the opportunity to discuss the contributions and strengths
the person brought to the team.You can also use the opportunity to identify
learning opportunities so the team member can grow professionally.

Finally, you should hold your last team meeting. Depending on your company
policies and your budget, you can have an on-site or off-site meeting; you can
arrange a special event; you can provide awards, plaques, certiﬁcates, bonuses, or gifts
to show appreciation for the team’s efforts.This is a time to celebrate the project’s
successes and to send the team off to their next assignments.
Solutions Fast Track
Closing Out Project Activities
 Issues logs may still have open issues. Review issues to determine whether
further project work is required.The issues in the log should each be
addressed and speciﬁcally resolved or closed as unresolved.
 Review any open or pending change requests or work orders.This might
indicate you still have project work to complete. Otherwise, close, cancel, or
transfer all open requests or orders, as appropriate. Unﬁnished work orders
may cause project charge backs or contractual issues.
 Bug reports should be updated to indicate which bugs were included in the
release and which are still open or pending.This data should be formally
transferred to a centralized system (if not already there) to be used for
future revisions or releases.
Preparing Final Project Documentation
 Technical documentation should be completed.This will vary widely
depending on your IT project. It may include system or conﬁguration
information, source code, versions of third-party software used, serial
numbers, or speciﬁcations for equipment.
 The project plan should be updated to reﬂect ﬁnal data. Gather all relevant
data so you can analyze plan versus actual results.
 Prepare a project closure report, which recaps and summarizes the project
and its results.This report is typically provided to the project sponsor,
corporate executives, and in some cases, the user/customer/client (when
appropriate).

Chapter 12 • Closing Out IT Projects

Final Project Sign-Off
 Projects should be formally signed off as complete by the project sponsor
or user/client/customer (as appropriate).
 The project may be signed off in one of four states: accepted, accept project
with variance noted, accept project with compensation to
user/customer/sponsor for omissions or variances, or continue project work
until variances are addressed.
 Operational transfer generally occurs after ﬁnal project sign-off. In some
cases, it may begin before or long after formal sign-off.
 Operational transfer should specify a number of details including contacts
for transfer, roles, responsibilities, warranties, ownership of intellectual
property, support agreements, and more.
 The point of transfer is an excellent opportunity to present your project’s
deliverables in a positive light to the user/client/customer. Use the transfer
event to increase the positive perception of the project.
Reviewing Lessons Learned
 A project audit might be conducted to analyze project results.An audit
should not be conducted at the same time as a lessons learned meeting.
 Lessons learned should be gathered throughout the project lifecycle. If
they’re captured just at the end, many important lessons learned will
probably be forgotten or overlooked.
 Your lessons learned meeting should not spiral down into blame and
accusations. Keep it positive and focus on what was learned and how that
information can be used in the future.
 Capturing, analyzing, and incorporating lessons learned is one important
way organizations become “learning organizations” and improve their
products, services, and processes over time.
Administrative Closure
 Any special permissions granted to the members of the project team, such
as special building or network access, special passwords, or access to
www.syngress.com
Closing Out IT Projects • Chapter 12
547

conﬁdential ﬁles should be revoked (as appropriate) as part of the
administrative closure.
 Paperwork may include gathering and ﬁling project status or progress
reports, closing out vendor and supplier contracts, ﬁnishing up billing
paperwork, or completing paperwork for post-project audits.
 Regulatory requirements should have been identiﬁed during the project
deﬁnition and organization phase. However, if you’re not sure if there are
legal or regulatory issues with your project, contact your project sponsor or
legal or ﬁnancial advisor.
 Failing to comply with legal or regulatory requirements (including
reporting requirements) can cause huge legal and ﬁnancial problems down
the road. If you’re unsure, ask.
 Performance reviews should include elements related to individual and
team participation during the project.
 If you’re unsure of how to conduct a performance evaluation, work with
your project sponsor or HR department.There are legal and professional
guidelines to which your reviews should conform.
 A strong IT project manager uses the performance evaluation process to
help team members grow through recognizing strengths and providing
coaching to improve weaknesses.
Final Team Meeting
 Create a relaxed, enjoyable atmosphere to celebrate success.
 Depending on your corporate guidelines and budget, provide awards,
certiﬁcates, gifts, or bonuses.
 Send your team off feeling good about the project’s successes.

Chapter 12 • Closing Out IT Projects

Q: Once our projects are complete, people run as fast as they can for the nearest
exits.Any suggestions for how to get people to assist with project close-out
activities?
A: Yes, there are several ways you can accomplish this. First, you can deﬁne
close-out activities during your project deﬁnition phase so that it is clear to
everyone that these activities are part of the IT project.Also, you can add
close-out tasks to your project plan, assign owners, and create entry/exit or
completion criteria for these tasks.Adding milestones for the completion of
these tasks will also give visibility to the importance of close-out tasks.You
can add elements to performance requirements so team members clearly
understand their roles and responsibilities during project close-out. Finally,
you can use good old peer pressure, friendly cajoling, and the reminder that
“the party doesn’t start until the paperwork’s done.”
Q: We don’t have any formal system for managing project documentation once
projects are complete. Do you have any suggestions?
A: That’s an excellent question. Many companies lack formal document man-
agement systems, so IT project managers are unsure of how to store or
archive this data. Begin by asking what format and location will be most
useful to your company based on how people work. For instance, if most
people don’t use computers, network storage of ﬁles might not be useful. If
most people have computers, would an intranet site, network storage loca-
tion, or good old CDs be your best bet? If you decide to store the docu-
ments electronically, pay attention to the ﬁle format. Ironically, documents
written thousands of years ago can still be read, but ﬁles written 10 years ago
sometimes cannot. Choose a fairly universal ﬁle and storage format if you
store documents electronically. Including keywords or other metadata will
make the documents that much more searchable.To create a storage system,

deﬁne the steps, formats, procedures, and technical speciﬁcations for the
system and document them so you (and others) will use them consistently.
Q: Our Training department always seems to expect us to develop training
materials for them. What suggestions do you have for how we might better
address this issue during project close-out?
A: If training is a function external to your project, you should have a point of
contact within the Training department with whom you coordinate the
development of training materials. Using your IT project management skills,
you (or a member of your team) and the training contact can develop a
training project sub-plan (or external plan). Deﬁning roles and responsibili-
ties, listing tasks, and assigning owners can be a great way to help develop the
needed plan and identify who needs to do what. Most likely, someone from
the Training department will need to sit down with someone from the pro-
ject team in order to transfer the required knowledge from which training
materials will be developed. Be willing and able to assist as far as possible to
make the task of developing training materials easier. In some cases, it might
be helpful and desirable to have one of the trainers participate as a tester.This
not only helps the trainer become familiar with the product, but it helps
testing by bringing in the user perspective. Plus, the trainer participating in
testing gives you another tester (usually from someone else’s budget).
Remember, the Training department has many other obligations and deliver-
ables and they’ve had to wait for your project to complete before developing
materials.That might put them in a time crunch, especially if your project
did not complete on schedule. Work cooperatively with Training and
remember that the better the training, the better your project will be received
and perceived. Using the framework of IT PM, you should be able to set
clear, ﬁrm boundaries that will help the training folks understand and own
their deliverables more appropriately in the future.
Q: I dread giving performance reviews. I don’t do it very often and I never
know what to say, especially when someone’s performance was less than
stellar. Do I have to do this as part of IT PM?
A: You may not have to give performance reviews but you really should make
yourself do it.As you continue up the career ladder, it will be a regular part
of your job so you might as well learn how to do a performance review now.
If you’re really uncomfortable with the whole thing, write up the review as
www.syngress.com
550
Chapter 12 • Closing Out IT Projects

you would if you were going to just e-mail it to your boss or HR for review.
Be honest but polite about the person’s performance. Focus on behaviors and
outcomes, not people or personalities. Next, contact HR and ask if someone
would help you prepare for the review. Bring the paperwork and discuss your
views of the person’s performance.Then, have the HR rep role-play with
you.You might feel silly doing it, but you will absolutely feel more conﬁdent
afterward.The HR person can play devil’s advocate, can respond to your con-
structive criticism in “negative” ways, and coach you on how to handle var-
ious reactions. Once you’ve done this a few times, you’ll feel more conﬁdent
about delivering reviews that help people grow professionally.
Q: My friends and colleagues would not describe me as a gregarious, outgoing
person. I’m not really comfortable with this whole team meeting party con-
cept. I’m more of a “Thank you!” on a Post-It™note kind of guy.Any 
suggestions?
A: No one ever died of embarrassment, so take a risk, loosen up, and have some
fun. If you really think heading up a fun event would totally be outside your
comfort zone, gather your most outgoing, fun-loving IT project team mem-
bers for a little planning session and assign the role of “master of ceremonies”
to the guy or gal who will do the best job ensuring everyone has a good
time.That way, you can fade in to the background if you need to, but you’ll
still provide your team with a memorable close-out event.
