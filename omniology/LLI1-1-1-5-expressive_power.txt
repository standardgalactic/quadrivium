Resolving Scope Ambiguity
Consider what Madison wants:
I’ll have ﬁsh and chips or salad.
We can formalise this statement in two diﬀerent ways.

Exercise: Scope Ambiguity
Select which of these options are possible forms of the sentence “If
it rains I’ll get wet unless I’m lucky”.
1. r ⊃(w ∨l)
2. r ⊃(w & l)
3. (r ⊃w) ∨l
4. (r ⊃w) & l
