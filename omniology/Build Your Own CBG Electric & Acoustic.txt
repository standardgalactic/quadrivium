Introduction
This book is divided into four sections.  The first section introduces the Cigar Box Guitar
(CBG), providing a short background and description, followed by a review of common
guitar parts.  This section covers the basics, provides photos of the parts used and explains
some of the how and why.
Introduction
Chapter 1 – So you want to build a Cigar Box Guitar
Chapter 2 – Parts Review

The next six chapters are devoted to an in depth build of a fretless electric guitar.  Each
step covers several activities that need to be performed and photos are provided to show
each detail, sometimes from several angles.  Everything from sanding the neck to
soldering the electric components is covered.

The third section is devoted to building a fretted acoustic guitar.  This build is abridged
and references steps used in building the electric guitar to prevent duplicating
information.  There are several differences that are pointed out as this guitar is built.  The
differences are provided with detail.  For fretted electric guitars, just follow the
instructions in step 9.5 on building a fretted fretboard.
Chapter 9 – Fretted Acoustic Guitar
< Step 9.1 – Box and Neck Fit >
< Step 9.2 – Neck Finalization>
< Step 9.3 – Box and Neck Attachment >
< Step 9.4 – Adding a Jack and Piezo Pickup >
< Step 9.5 – Fretboard >
< Step 9.6 – Finishing the guitar >
 
Lastly, the three appendixes explore further customization processes used in these builds. 
Appendix A – Wood burning
Appendix B – Headstock Design
Appendix C – Pickups
Before starting a build, read through all the steps, understand the process and have a vision
of how the guitar will look when finished.  If anything is confusing, just read ahead to see
how, or why, something is done the way it is described in the book.
The photos are arranged so that most of the time there is only one per page.  The reasoning
for this is so that you, the reader, can take notes as you read and as you build your own
cigar box guitar. 

Chapter 1 – So you want to build a Cigar Box
Guitar. 
So you want to build a cigar box guitar (CBG).  Great!  I can help you with that.  These
guitars are fun to build, sound great and have a terrific history.  Best thing… there are no
rules.  You are free to be as creative as you want.
The CBG originated in the depression era.  Many poor folk in the 1930s scrounged an old
cigar box - because smoking was much more prominent back then – an old broom handle,
a couple parts and some wire to make the original CBGs.  They couldn’t afford anything
more than what they could find around them.  But, they made great guitars and those
guitars were the stepping stones for some great musicians.
Some of the original CBGs were actually made as violins and date into the 1800s.  Some
were crudely scrapped together, but others were expertly crafted.
Those pioneering CBG players came up with the first blues riffs.  A few of the more
famous players are Sam ‘Lightning’ Hopkins, Blind Willie Johnson and Buddy Guy.  They
moved on to 6 string guitars and developed the blues genre.  The blues later developed
into rock-n-roll.  Bo Diddley, named after the 1 string diddley bow, played 3 string CBGs
and is credited with being the originator of the blues to rock-n-roll transition.  The CBG is
truly the origination of American music.  
That is some really great stuff and shows the true pedigree of the CBG.  There’s more you
can find online regarding the history of the CBG.  There are links in the references at the
end of this book for your viewing pleasure.
You came here though because you want to get your hands dirty and build your own
instrument.  So, let’s get to it.  The first and most important rule of building a CBG is that
there are no rules!  You can use methods and parts common on other guitars, or if you
have a keen eye, you can find something that nobody else has used before, but works
great.  Or you can use an existing part in a new way.  There are literally no rules.  Some
people have even found a way to incorporate a fork…
A quick online search of CBGs reveals a vast number of really great CBGs.  They are all
guitars and share the same layout, but their parts and construction are nearly all unique.  If
you’re reading this, I’m sure you already know that.

This book will cover the common parts needed to build these CBGs and walk you through
several CBG builds so you can get a feel of how these go together and to get you past any
hesitation you may have of jumping into your first build.
For reference throughout this book, when referred to, length (L), width (W) and height (H)
have the below correlation…
A standard length, width and height correlation is important for future references made in
this book.

When referring to sides of the box, or ends of the neck, the below photo explains the
reference.
The “top” would be the top of the guitar as if it was being held while played.  The
“bottom” would be the bottom as if it was held while being played.
The “neck end” is the end of the box where the neck of the guitar enters the box.  The
“butt end” is the opposite end of the box.
The “top of the neck” would be where the tuners are mounted for adjusting string tension
and is also referred to as the head stock.

Chapter 2 – Parts Review.
The first part needed is a cigar box.  Find one that is about 10 inches long, 8 inches wide
and 2 to 2.5 inches tall.  These measurements aren’t written in stone, so if a desired box
has different measurements, go for it. The great thing about CBGs is that there are no
rules… there is no wrong way to build one (unless it ends up looking like a flute when
you’re done, then maybe something went wrong). 
Smaller boxes work almost as good as larger boxes.  Smaller boxes also make neat
mandolins, which are built in much the same fashion as a CBG.  A different approach is
needed with smaller boxes, but they do work.  Larger boxes are much easier and sound
much better in acoustic guitars.  They all work great. Adaptations need to be made
according to the characteristics of each box. 
The white box in the previous chapter was actually used to build a 6 string CBG.  Boxes
come in different sizes, different thicknesses and different woods.  Each has its own
unique sound.
The below is the box used to build a 3 string un-fretted guitar described in this book.  It
has already been sanded because the finish was marred and it will get a special ‘theme’
wood burned into it.  This one is 10” long, 8” wide and 2.5” tall.
Wood for the neck is needed too.  A common and readily available wood is poplar.  Below
is a 1” x 2” x 6’ length of poplar.  It actually measures ¾” x 1.5”. 

At a bare minimum, that is all anyone would need (aside from strings), to build a CBG.
However, this is the modern age and there are many quality parts available to make it
more like a professionally made guitar.  We also want something that looks cool and
something we would be proud to show off.   

Tuners are used to secure the end of the strings at the top end of the neck and to adjust the
tuning.  For the builds in this book you want 2 on one side and 1 on the other side.  Tuners
are side specific.  See the photo below…  The photo shows the correct layout for these
tuners.  The posts sticking straight up need to be on the side facing the bridge.  When
strung up, the posts are pulled down and the gears are pushed together, keeping a strong
meshing of the gears.  If the posts are on the back side of the tuners, the strings will pull
the gears apart and increase the likeliness of the gears stripping out.  This is not a fun thing
to have happen after you put the strings on.

Another photo of the tuners.  The red lines show where the strings would be and how they
pull on the posts.  The gears are located inside the metal bodies underneath the posts.  This
is the correct layout of these tuners.  You could have two of the left ones and one right one
too.  If you buy a set of 6 tuners (3 per side) you would be able to make 2 guitars.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

You also need a way to secure the other end of the strings.  There are many ways to do
this.  A door striker plate used to hold the ends of these strings….
The striker plate also allows bolts to go through the box so that they can be grounded on
the inside.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Rolled pins are cut to length and pushed into holes drilled through the neck.  This process
is used on the fretted acoustic CBG in chapter 9.

There are ferrules made specifically to hold the string ends.
Bicycle rim spoke nipples work great too.
If you want to make an acoustic guitar, you’ll possibly need some inserts for the sound
holes, or you can just cut out the holes and leave them as is.  This is an example of simple
sound hole inserts.

It is perfectly acceptable to cut out F holes or F designs with a scroll or coping saw as
well.  These F holes can be left raw or decorated.  There are also a wide variety of sound
hole covers being used by builders.  Some even use shower drains… which work great
and look great.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Nuts and bridges are needed as well.  The nut is the bone, plastic or metal piece at the top
of the neck (near the tuners) that holds the strings up.  The bridge is located on the body of
the guitar and holds up the other end of the strings.  This nut is a 1.5” x 3/8” bolt…
Specially designed nuts, for 3 or 4 string guitars, can be ordered online if bolts or threaded
rod are unavailable in your area. 
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

A threaded rod bridge… Notice the use of the bicycle rim spoke nipples used to secure the
strings where they go through the box.  The strings go all the way through the box and the
same nipples are used on the back.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

For an electric guitar, a few more items are needed.  The pickup, a jack, a volume knob
and some wire… as well as some soldering skills are required.  Below is a volume knob
(potentiometer or pot) and a guitar jack.  Notice that the volume knob has a letter and
number printed on the top… this one is A250K.  The “A” indicates this one is for audio. 
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
*A250k or A500k volume potentiometer (pot)

As for a pickup, you can buy them online or at your local guitar shop.  You can also make
your own.  Below is a handmade 3 pole pickup.
This pickup was built with the same 2 inch by ¼ inch oak wood used for the fretboard, but
was wrapped with a beer can.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Another angle…  This pickup has 6000 turns of 40 gauge magnetic wire.  Unseen are
three magnets under the bottom.  Circuit board is used on the bottom because it is durable
and easily soldered to.  See the three poles sticking up above the surface?  This pickup is
designed to mount on the surface of the guitar.  Other common pickups that you can buy
mount flush and have 2 screws used to raise or lower the pickup.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

This is what a common CBG pickup looks like.  It has 4 poles for use with 4 strings, but
also works fine with 3 strings.  The outer 2 screws secure the unit to the guitar (a license
plate guitar) and the inner 2 screws raise or lower the pickup to adjust the height.
This 4 pole pickup works fine on 3 or 4 strings.  There are 3 string pickups available for
purchase online as well. 
Regular 6 pole pickups can be used on 3 string guitars too.  To do this, angle the 6 pole
pickup so that all 6 poles are under the 3 strings.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Electric or acoustic guitar strings are important…  Below is a regular 6 string pack.  The
3rd, 4th and 5th strings, or the GDA strings, are used from these packs for open G tuning.  3
string packs, specifically for CBGs, are also available online.
The remaining 3 strings (eBE) can be used to make an open E tuned guitar too.  Re-using
the remaining 3 strings helps reduce waste.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
*eBGDAE
*GDA strings = GDg/open G tuning

You will also need some wire to wire up the electronics.  You can use speaker wire or just
any two wires.  Non-shielded wire like speaker wire, can pick up noise though.  Shielded
wire prevents this.  Shielded wire has a braided ground wire surrounding the internal
wires.
Speaker wire…
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Shielded wire… The bare wire is the ground and is braided around the red and white
wires.  This ground wire encases the red and white wires inside preventing external noises
from interfering with our guitar’s sound.  This type of wire is the preferred wire to use. 
Copper tape can also be used to coat the inside of the cigar box cavity to create a faraday
cage around the electronics.  The copper tape needs to be grounded and maintain
connectivity throughout the inside of the box.  Wood can be used to create a smaller box
around just the electronics so the entire inside of the box doesn’t need to be coated with
copper tape.  This method is much more work than shielded wire.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Fretboards are not required, but play an important role.  The fretboard is a piece of ¼”
wood used to secure the frets.  Frets are the metal bands used to “fret” the strings to
shorter lengths to create different notes or chords.  Frets can be placed directly onto the
neck, but for this book they will be placed on a fretboard.  The fretboard strengthens the
neck and adds a nice look to the guitar.  Fretboards are commonly maple, oak or some
other exotic wood.
CBGs can be fretted (with frets) or Fretless (without frets).  A fret board is used in this
book for both examples.  Even without frets, the blank fretboard adds strength to the neck
of the guitar.  Below is an example of wood used for an oak fretboard.  The best thing
about using oak is that it is easily sourced from most any hardware/lumber store.

The frets on CBGs are flat pieces of metal, rounded on the top with a thin edge that is
embedded into the wood.  Traditional guitars use a curved neck and require curved fret
wire, but CBGs use a flat neck and require the fret wire to be flat.  C.B. Gitty has quality
flat fret wire and their website is included in the references at the end of this book.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Chapter 3 – The Electric 3 String Box
A fretless electric CBG is a great instrument.  Without frets this guitar is designed for
sliding.  The slide is a smooth metal, glass, or other hard product used to slide up and
down the strings for a great blues sound.  It is possible to play individual strings or chords
without sliding, but sliding is typical on a fretless guitar.  It is also possible to fret a string
against the fret board with your finger to change the tune, but this method does mute the
string.
Picking the box and making the measurements based on the box is the most important
part.  Everything about the neck depends on the box and where you want the bridge. 
Parts needed:
Cigar box
2” x 1” x 6’ Poplar (neck)
¼” x 2” x 4’ oak (fretboard)
Pickup
¼” Mono Guitar Jack
Audio Volume Potentiometer (Pot)
Tools needed:
Masking tape
Pencil
Small hand saw
File and/or sandpaper
Drill
Jigsaw
Pliers
Tape measure
90 degree Straight edge
Stain, Sealer and brush
Optional: Dremel with cutting disc
3/8” Drill bit
In this build, the bridge will be 2.5” from the butt end of the guitar.  Anywhere from 2-3
inches is fine and if you want to make it closer or further away… go for it.  There are no
rules!  
This electric guitar will have the strings going through the body, but on the acoustic guitar,

the strings run through an extension of the neck at the butt end of the guitar.  The strings
are secured through holes in the wood as seen below. 
Top…
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
*Rolled pins prevent the strings from cutting into the wood.

Underneath view of the extended neck where the strings are secured…
This guitar uses 3/4inch by 1/8 inch rolled pins inserted through the ¾ inch neck wood. 
The rolled pins prevent the strings from digging into the wood over time.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Before starting on the guitar, pull the pins out of the hinges.  This lets the box open and
close without removing the hinges.  The hinges could be left intact, but it is easier to just
remove the pin.  The pin can be put back in at the end of the build if desired.
The hinges can be completely removed as well.  This method creates a more streamlined
look.  It is sometimes difficult to remove the hinges without damaging them though.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 3.1 – Notch the Lid For the Neck >
First cut is on the end of the box to make it fit around the neck.  Put some masking tape on
your lid first before marking anything.  The neck is 1.5” wide, so find the center of the box
lid and measure ¾” north and south from that mark.  This box is 8” so the center is 4”
from either side. 
The yellow line marks the center of the lid and the black is ¾” north and south… for a
total width of 1.5”.
(for info on wood burning, see Appendix A)
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Mark the side of the box too.
Use a coping saw to cut the end.  The box lid is ¼” thick so cut in ¼”.  Then use a file to
smooth it out while test fitting it to the neck along the way.
This is the goal; a nice tight fit.  Notice the box lid is sitting above the neck of the guitar. 
Don’t worry… the neck will be notched out to make it fit. That will happen later.

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 3.2 – Add Pickup Hole >
Next, it is time to fit the pickup.  There needs to be a hole for the pickup before moving
forward with the neck.
It is also a good time to cut the base for the bridge.  The base and the pickup will help give
a visual of where they should go on the lid.  For this build, a 3” piece of the oak fretboard
wood is used to make the base for the bridge.  This is a simple 3” piece sanded and
smoothed.
For the pickup and bridge base, first lay down some masking tape then measure and mark
the center of the box.  After the center is marked, measure and mark (left and right) where
you want the bridge and the pickup.  Below on the left is the 3” piece of oak and on the
blue tape is where I want the pickup (box marked in marker) and the base (tick marks on
tape).

Both pieces mocked up on the box lid.  The oak piece will be the base for the bridge and
the Pickup will be next to it.
Another angle…
After you are satisfied, remove the pickup and measure the bobbin (the part below the
surface of the pickup that will penetrate through the lid.  This one measured just under
1.25” x 2”.  This is measured and marked on the tape.  If using a purchased pickup your
measurements will differ.  Measure it twice before you cut.  You want just enough room to
fit the pickup’s bobbin down into the box.  A little large is better than a little small.  Just
don’t make it too large so that the hole is visible after the pickup is mounted.

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Drill a hole and use a handsaw or jigsaw to cut out the marked piece.  If you have one, use
a dremel with a cutting wheel.  Sometimes power tools and saws can chip or splinter the
wood.  The dremel does not do that.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 3.3 – Add Jack and Volume Pot >
Since the tape is out, mark and drill the holes for the jack and volume pot.  On this build
the volume pot will go through the lid and the jack will go on the side (through the bottom
of the box).
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Side view…
Drill a 3/8” hole for the volume pot and a 3/8” hole for the jack.  This jack will be
mounted on the lower part of the box where the vertical line is marked.  Always double
check the inside of the box before drilling.  Make sure the jack will fit inside the box
without contacting the box or any other items.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Before test fitting the volume pot, there’s a small tab that needs to be removed.  Just grab
it with pliers and snap it off.  You won’t hurt it.
If this tab is not removed, the volume pot will not sit flush with the inside of the box.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Test fit the volume pot and the jack.  The ¼” thickness of the box’s side is just thin enough
for the jack to fit and still be screwed tight.  If it was any thicker the inside of the box
would have to be thinned with a dremel and sanding wheel.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 3.4 - Remove Interior Labels >
If there is a label on the inside, remove it.  Fortunately this label was very small, but many
cigar box labels take up the entire inside of the lid.  Remove as much as you can and sand
it away if necessary.  You want a good, clean surface to glue the neck to.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 3.5 – Stain and/or Seal the Lid >
If the box has a nice label on it or you do not want to change the box, skip the stain.  The
clear coat is up to you.  It adds protection, but can change the look.
Water based stains and sealers are easy to clean up and work great.  These are the products
used on this guitar.  The stain is onyx black. 
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
*Polyacrylic = water based = easy clean up

Below is the box after applying the black stain.  It was applied with a paper towel and
wiped off before it set too long.  This process gives an old, weathered look.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Below is after applying 2 coats of semi-gloss clear.  The pickup is just sitting there to get
an idea of how it will look when complete.  This pickup did not fit the theme so a new,
plain, wood pickup was made to replace it.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Chapter 4 – The Electric 3 String Neck
With the box as far along as it can be right now, it is time to move to the neck.  The neck is
going to have to fit the dimensions we assigned to the box, such as where the bridge was
measured to, and the neck will need to accommodate the pickup.
Parts needed:
2” x 1” x 6’ Poplar (neck)
Tools needed:
Tape measure
Pencil
90 degree Straight edge
Band saw or Handsaw/Jigsaw
Wood glue
Clamps
Rasp, file and sandpaper
Router and 3/8” round over bit
< Step 4.1 – Neck Measurements >
For this guitar, the bridge will be 2.5” from the butt end of the guitar.  The box thickness is
¼” so measure 2.25” from the end of the neck to where the bridge will be.  Mark each
measurement in pencil to get a visual of the measurements and make any changes now. 
The scale will be 25.5” (bridge to nut) and 5” is added so there is plenty of space for the
tuners.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Measurements are:
2.25” bottom to bridge
25.5” scale (bridge to nut)
5” for tuners
Total length of neck is 32.75”
Your measurements will be similar but don’t have to be exact.
Cut your neck at the total length (32.75” or whatever your measurement works out to be)
AFTER measuring twice.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
*5 inches given for the tuners, but the headstock will be angled at 4.5 inches to leave a flat
section for the nut to sit.

< Step 4.2 – Mark the neck >
Place the box lid over the neck making sure the neck is all the way against the lid on the
left (butt end).
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

With the lid and the neck together, mark the opening for your pickup…
And, mark the end of the box’s lid on the neck…
This is what the marks should look like. The small pencil mark is at 2.25” to show where
the pickup will be.  The next two lines indicate the opening for the pickup.  And the far
right pencil line is the end of the box.  Take a straight edge and go over the lines.  You can
widen the pickup marks by.1/16” to 1/8”.

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 4.3 – Neck Brace >
This picture shows the pickup opening widened about 1/16” and the neck mark trued to 90
degrees.  The shorter piece below the neck was cut from 2” x 1” poplar (same as the neck)
to be 2.5 inches longer than the far right pencil line.  This piece is coated with glue and
glued to the underside of the neck.  It will act as a strengthening brace and ad rigidity
where cuts are made into the neck.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Glue the neck and the shorter strengthening piece together.  Clamp them together to set the
glue. 
Make sure the sides are aligned as smooth as possible.  The less aligned they are, the more
sanding will need to be done later. 
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 4.4 – Cutting the Neck >
There need to be 5 pieces of wood removed from the box end of the neck and one cut at
the top (tuner) end of the neck.  This step is probably the most complicated so make sure
to go over the cuts and understand each section that will be removed.  Make sure to read
all the way through steps 4, 5 and 6 to understand the purpose of each removal.  Below are
the 5 pieces to be removed from the butt end of the neck
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

The pencil is difficult to see, so lines are added…
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Starting with section 5, remove the thickness of the box lid.  This box is 1/8” thick so
remove 1/8” form the top of the neck so the neck sits flush with the surface of the lid. 
From the butt end of the neck remove 1/8” to the line made here…
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Close up of section 5…
Section #2 removes a piece of the neck to make space for the pickup.
… Measure down the side of the neck to make a deep enough cut that the pickup will not
touch the bottom.  The pickup for this guitar is ¾” deep, minus the thickness of the lid
(1/8”) leaves 5/8”.  The cut for this guitar is ¾” deep.
Close up of sections 1 (butt end brace) and section 2 (pickup)…

Sections 1 and 3 make space for bracing that will be added later.  These sections are both
¾” wide.  One is at the very butt end of the neck.  The other section is right below the
mark for the top 1/8” to be removed so that the right side will be flush with the inside of
the box.  The goal of these two cuts is to have the bracing flush against the inside of the
box. Leave ¾” of wood between the line for section 5 and the top of sections 1 and 3.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Close up of sections 3 (neck end brace) and section 4 (angled cut)…
Sections 1 and 3 together… showing that that there will be ¾” of wood between the 1/8”
line and the section that will be removed.
Section #4 tapers the bracing added to the bottom of the neck. This gives it a smoother
transition before it enters the box.
This is what the neck looks like after all the sections are cut out. 

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

The top of the neck needs one angled cut. The small angled piece that is cut will be
reused.
Cut the angled piece from the top of the neck like so…
Move the cut piece to the underside of the neck…

Glue it and clamp it in place. 
The next step in preparing the neck involves rounding the back edges to make them
smooth and comfortable.  A router is used on this neck, but a rasp and file could also be
used.  This photo shows the part of the neck where it meets the box (where the angled
section was removed).  Do not round off the neck where it enters the box… that part is
kept squared off.

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Round off the edges all the way up the neck and stop before the last angled cut.  The last
5” are left squared off.
In all the places where sections of wood were removed (for the pickup and bracing), leave
those raw for now.
This photo was taken prior to the angled piece being glued to the bottom of the headstock. 
This is because the neck was rounded off at the same time it was cut.  The exact order of
rounding the edges of the neck or gluing the angled piece is not critical.
Notes: _________________________________________________________

< Step 4.5 – Making the Braces >
Two braces are needed.  They must fit the inside width of the lid.  This lid is 8” outside
width, but 7.5 inches inside width.  The braces are 7.5” long.  Then there must be a 1.5” x
¾” section removed from the dead center of one side.  These braces will fit into each of
the neck brace sections we removed earlier.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

This photo shows the measurements. 
As noted, the length of your braces will be determined by the cigar box you use.

Chapter 5 – Putting the Box and Lid together
Warning: DO NOT GLUE ANYTHING TOGETHER.  Test fit everything at least once
before any glue is put near the guitar.
Tools needed:
Tape measure
Pencil
90 degree Straight edge
Handsaw or Jigsaw
Wood glue
Clamps
File and sandpaper
7/16” drill bit
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 5.1 – Test Fit >
Test fit the neck and two braces.  At first these were too tight to fit together.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

After rasping, filing and sanding the pieces fit together, they fit.  This is a bottom view of
the neck and braces being test fitted together.
…and a top view of the pieces fitting together without glue.
Remember not to glue anything yet.
After the neck and two braces fit together easily, test fit them inside the lid.  If the braces
are too long, file and sand them down to fit.

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

This is a close up of the top end of the lid.  Notice about 1/8” extra height of the brace? 
That is because 1/8” of the neck was removed in step 4 so the neck sits flush with the lid.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

This is the bottom end of the lid.  Everything is fitting together nicely.  By the way, don’t
glue anything yet.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Next, the bottom of the box needs to be notched out for the neck.  Place the lid, neck and
braces upside down on the workbench and measure the height of the neck above the lid. 
This one is 7/8”
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

On tape, mark the width of the neck and the depth of the neck.
A Dremel and cutting wheel was used to cut the section out.  Test fit, file and sand until
everything fits snug.
Continue test fitting the whole box, neck and braces together until they are perfect.  After
this step they will be glued together and there will be no going back after that.  It is ten
times easier to file or sand a piece to fit prior to gluing than it is after everything is glued
in place.
Top view of everything test fitted together…

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Bottom view of everything test fitted together…
Make sure the bottom fits without gaps.  Sometimes glue gets onto the edge of the box lid
and prevents the bottom from sitting flush.  A snug fit is good, but a tight fit means the
bottom may be damaged the next time it is removed.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Remember the hole in the bottom end of the box where the guitar jack will be mounted? 
It happens to be blocked by one of the braces.  The brace needs to be cut to accommodate
the jack. 
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

First, mark the brace with pencil.
Using a hand saw, cut along the pencil marks.
Another view… (The label was sanded away where the brace will be glued.)

Problem fixed…
< Step 5.2 – Finishing the Neck >
First… sand, sand, sand!   Sand the neck down nice and smooth.  The combination of a
belt sander and sanding by hand works great.  The neck should be as smooth as butter. 
But if it isn’t perfect, don’t worry; there will be more sanding in future steps. 
After the neck is super smooth, the holes for the tuners need to be drilled.  Place masking
tape down on the top of the neck and mark two lines 3/8” in from the sides of the neck
(blue lines below).  Then, about 1” to 1.25” down from the top of the neck, mark a line

perpendicular to the sides… followed by two more lines each 1” down (red lines).  Double
check the tuners (which side they go on) and mark the three holes to be drilled.  Double
check that none of the holes are less than 1” from the nut.  When all is good, drill the three
holes.

The holes…
(For info on decorating the head of the neck, see Appendix B)
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Next, it is time to stain and/or seal the neck.  The stain on this neck is black (same as the
box), applied with a paper towel.  The stain is rubbed in until dry, without putting too
much on or letting it sit long.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

A second view…
Clear Polyacrylic should be applied after the stain.  After 2 coats of Polyacrylic, give the
neck a light sanding by hand.  Apply another coat followed by a light sanding.  Repeat
until everything is as smooth as butter.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 5.3 – Gluing the Box and Lid Together >
Now, finally, it is time to glue!  Apply a smooth layer of glue to the top of the neck (where
the cut out for the pickup is) and lay it down along the center of the inside of the lid. 
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Next, apply a smooth layer of glue to the braces, making sure to apply glue to all the
surfaces where they will contact either the neck or the inside of the lid.  After they are in
place, double-check to make sure the neck is straight, then use clamps to hold everything
tight.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

On the outside of the box, use smooth scraps of wood between the lid and the clamp so the
surface is not damaged.
After the glue has dried, test fit the bottom of the box to the guitar again.  It is possible
that more filing and sanding is needed to make the bottom fit nice again.
Notes: _________________________________________________________

Chapter 6 – Fretboard
The fretboard on a fretless guitar is more or less optional.  The benefit is that it provides
additional strength to the neck and makes the guitar look better.
Parts:
¼” x 2” x 4’ oak (fretboard)
Tools needed:
Tape measure
Pencil
Masking tape
90 degree Straight edge
Handsaw or Jigsaw
Wood glue
Clamps
Triangle file, marker or other scale marker
Clear Polyacrylic
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 6.1 – Measure >
Measure twice… Lay out the 2” (actually 1.5”) wide fretboard on the neck.  This scale
will be 25.5” so measure that out on the neck with the tape measure.  Adjust the fretboard
to match the end of the tape measure.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Verify where the scale ends and it matches where the bridge was measured to be.  Make
sure everything lines up and you are happy with where everything will be.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

This fretboard worked out to be 17.5” long.  If the design wasn’t on the lid, the fretboard
could be another ½” or inch longer.  At a minimum, the fretboard should touch the edge of
the box.  It can extend however further onto the box as one wishes.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

The cut fretboard laying on the neck.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

There are many online fret calculators.  They are very handy to calculate each fret
distance.  Some provide fret to fret distance and/or nut to fret distance.  Always use the nut
to fret distance for better accuracy.  Also use millimeter measurements.  After the
measurements are provided by a website, print them out.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
*24 inches = 609.6 mm
*24.5 inches = 622.3 mm
*25 inches = 635 mm
*25.5 inches = 647.7 mm
*26 inches = 660.4 mm

Because the nut will be a 3/8” bolt, the strings will not start exactly at the end of the
fretboard.  The strings will actually start at the top, center of the bolt, which is half the
diameter of the bolt, or 3/16.  To account for this, extend the ruler/tape measure 3/16 past
the end of the fretboard before starting any measurements.  Using a millimeter ruler or
tape measure, mark the frets on the edge of the fretboard with a pencil.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 6.2 – Scale Markers >
The scale needs to be marked on the fretboard since there will be no frets.  There are many
ways to do this… permanent marker, tape, file (see below), or any other way that works. 
To do the file method, simply file a groove on the edge of the fretboard where the scale
was marked in the previous step.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 6.3 – Stain/Finish >
Sand, sand sand… then finish the fretboard top and sides with a stain if desired.  If there
will be any decoration on the fretboard, such as wood burning or carving, finish it before
staining.
When ready, apply several coats of clear.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 6.4 – Glue it on >
As in step 1, measure again… This is to verify placement of the fretboard BEFORE it is
glued onto the neck.  On the fretboard shown below, BBs are used to mark the scale.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

The fretboard and base for the bridge are good.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Smooth out wood glue on the back of the fretboard al the way to the edges.  Then clamp it
tightly to the neck.  Blue masking tape is used to mark where the end of the fretboard
should be. 
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Use a scrap piece of wood on the under side of the neck.
Another angle, showing the blue tape and clamps.
It is a good point in the process to glue the bridge base to the guitar.  Masking tape is used
to mark where this piece should be glued.  The two top pieces show where the 25.5” scale
is centered.  The tape at the butt end of the guitar has 3” wide markings to help center it. 
Place something flat and heavy on it to hold it in place while the glue dries, such as a can
of stain.

Chapter 7 – Wiring
Now is the time to get out the soldering iron.  For some, this is a daunting task, but it is
really very simple.  Just take the steps one at a time.  A pretty soldering job is not
required… just make sure the wires are connected well and will not come loose.
Parts:
Volume pot
Pickup
Guitar jack
Speaker wire, shielded wire, or equivalent
Screws
Tools needed:
Tape measure
Pencil
Masking tape
Soldering iron
Solder
Screw driver
Sockets or pliers
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 7.1 – Lay it Out >
Install the volume pot and the guitar jack.  This guitar is a little different because the guitar
jack is on the bottom of the box and everything else is on the top of the box.  But the
essentials are the same.  
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

This is the basic wiring diagram used.  Make sure to use the ground tab on the guitar
jack… this is the tab that makes contact with the shaft of the jack when it is inserted, not
the tip of the jack.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Lay out your wire.  Below is the shielded wire, but regular 2 strand speaker wire works
just as well.  Laying out the wire helps make sure the wire lengths are sufficient.  A little
extra is okay.  Below is the wire going from the pickup to the volume pot.  The red and
white wires are twisted together to serve as a single connection.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

This is the wire going from the volume pot to the guitar jack.
This wire is left longer than needed so that the guitar can be opened and laid flat.  If the
jack was on the front of the guitar with the volume pot, the length of the wire would not
need to be as long.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Normally the wires and tabs should all be tinned first, but in this case the ground is
inserted through the left tab of the volume pot and extended to the case of the pot.  This
will help ground the pot.  The red and white wires are twisted together and inserted
through the right tab.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 7.2 – Soldering >
Go ahead and solder the wires to the volume pot…  If new at soldering, don’t stress.  The
best way is to get some solder on the tip of the soldering iron first.  Then heat up the
wire/tab a little before touching the solder to the tip of the soldering iron. Let the solder
flow onto the wire/tab.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Next, tin the tabs and wires of the jack and its wires.  Then tin the remaining tab of the pot
and its wires.  Tinning is the process of applying solder before actually soldering.  This
prepares the wires and tabs so connection is faster and easier.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Solder the ground and red/white wires to the pickup.
Before continuing with the jack soldering, mount the pickup.  Masking tape is used to
mark where the pickup is to be mounted and also to hold it in place.
Drill holes through the lid using the pickup holes as a guide.  Then secure with screws.

This is the pickup mounted to the lid…
A view of the volume pot wiring…

Solder the wires to the guitar jack.
When complete this is how it all looks.

Chapter 8 – Finishing It Up
Time to finish up the last few items.  With the bulk of the work done, all that is left is the
final assembly.
Parts:
Tuners
Strings
Bicycle rim spoke nipples and/or ferrules
3/8” threaded rod
3 #6 x ¾” screws
Volume knob
Tools needed:
Small screw driver
Sockets or pliers
Drill
1/16” and 1/8” drill bits
Grinding wheel and/or file
Hammer
Dremel with cutting wheel or hand saw
Wire snips
Needle nosed pliers
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 8.1 – Tuners >
The tuners allow the guitar player to adjust the tension on the strings.  Over time and from
playing, the strings stretch and need to be readjusted.  In step 5.2, holes were drilled in the
neck to accommodate the tuners.  Insert the tuners from the back so they extend through
the front.  Make sure they are on the correct side, then add the washer and nut.  When all
is right, secure them finger tight.  …I made a rhyme…
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

View from the back…
After making sure they are straight, use a 1/16” drill bit to drill ¼” deep in all three
tuners. 
Use a small tip screw driver on the three screws.  Be careful not to strip the screws out
when tightening.  Also, do not let the screwdriver slip and gouge the wood.

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Finished…
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 8.2 – Nut & Bridge>
There are many materials to use for the nut and bridge.  For this build, the nut and bridge
is cut from 3/8” threaded rod.  The nut is cut at 1.5” length.  The rod can be cut with a
Dremel or a hand saw.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

The bridge is cut at 2” length.
After cutting them, use a grinding wheel and/or file to smooth the ends and edges.
Using the grinding wheel, a flat side is ground into the bridge.  This lowers the strings and
keeps the bridge from shifting.  This is not a completely necessary step, but it does help.

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 8.3 – Strings >
There are several ways to procure strings for a CBG.  There are 3 string packs available
online from CBGitty.  These strings are put together specifically for CBGs and are
typically designed for Open G tuning.  Alternately, a regular 6 string pack can be used
too.  For open G tuning, the 3rd, 4th and 5th strings (that is, the 3rd, 4th and 5th thickest
strings) are used.
The strings need to go through the body.  To do this, lay down masking tape and then
locate the center of the guitar (black line below).  Measure ½” to either side of the center
(blue lines).  Measure in from the butt end of the guitar about an inch.  Double check
clearances from the back before drilling.  When satisfied, drill 1/8” holes through the lid
and through the bracing.

This guitar uses bicycle rim spoke nipples.  Without these inserted into the holes, the
strings would cut into the wood leaving marks and making it more difficult to keep the
guitar in tune.  A small dab of super glue can be used to keep them in place if needed.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Inside the guitar, special ferrules are used to hold the strings in place.  These ferrules allow
the strings ends to sit inside the holes and not on top of the brace.  3/8” holes are drilled
3/8” deep to let the ferrules mount correctly.  They should sit snug, not tight (the strings
will keep them in place).  If too tight, widen the 3/8” hole a little at a time.  Use a scrap
piece of wood and a hammer to tap them into place. 
The inside of this guitar is not deep enough to let the strings sit on top of the bracing.  If
there was more room, the same spoke nipples could be used inside the box.  The 1/8”
holes would be drilled through the back of the guitar too and the strings would go through
the entire guitar that way.  The benefit of putting them inside the guitar is a cleaner look,
but it does require opening the guitar to re-string it.

The copper colored string ends can be seen inside the ferrules.
The strings coming through the front of the guitar…
To begin stringing the guitar select the middle string and pull it up to the tuners. Let the
other two strings lay to the side.

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

The middle string should go through the hole in the furthest tuner (as seen below). This
leaves a tuner on either side for the other two strings.  Pull the string tight, then pull it
back about two and a half inches.  Twist the handle on the tuner until the string is taught
making sure it lays in the middle of the nut and the bridge.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Next, take the thicker string and bring it up to the tuners.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

It will go through the hole in the tuner to the left of the middle string.  Pull the string tight,
then back out about two and a half inches.  Turn the tuner’s handle the same direction to
tighten until it is taught.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Select the last, thinnest string and bring it up to the tuners.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

The thin string will go through the last tuner.  After pulling back about two and a half
inches of slack, turn the tuner the same direction again to bring the string taught.  If done
right, all three tuners will turn the same direction to tighten or loosen… making tuning
much easier.  Lastly, make sure the strings are evenly spaced along the nut and bridge. 
About 7 threads between the strings works out good.  To keep the middle string clear of
the other tuners, a screw was inserted in the middle of the neck to help guide the string.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

The bridge…
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

It looks cool to leave the ends of the strings long and let them flail about, but they do get
in the way.  To prevent scratches and cuts, snip the excess strings off, leaving about ½”
protruding from the tuners.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

After cutting them, use needle nosed pliers to bend the cut ends down as shown.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 8.4 – Close it up >
Time to close up the back of the guitar.  Place masking tape on the back corners and mark
½” in from each side.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

On the butt end of the guitar, place the masking tape on the center.  Mark the center, then
½” from the butt end.
Drill 1/8” holes about 3/4” deep.
These holes are countersunk for use with the wood screws.  Pan head screws can be used
without countersinking.  Use #6 screws that are ¾” deep.

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Put the screws into the holes and tighten the back of the guitar on.
Close the clasp.
All done.  Don’t forget a volume knob…

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 8.5 – gDG Tuning >
Tuning is best done with an electronic tuner.  There are ten dollar chromatic tuners online
that work great.  There are also free tuner apps that can be downloaded to a smartphone or
tablet that work just as good.
As noted in chapter one, there are several ways to procure strings for a CBG.  There are 3
string packs available online.  These strings are put together specifically for CBGs and are
typically designed for Open G tuning.  Alternately, a regular 6 string pack can be used
too.  For open G tuning, the A, D and G strings (that is, the 3rd, 4th and 5th thickest strings)
are used.
The most common tuning is open G…
The thickest/lowest string should be tuned to g (second octave).
The middle string should be tuned to D (third octave).
The thinnest/highest string should be tuned to G (third octave).
Alternate tuning include Open A, Open D, Open C and Open E.
There are wonderful videos on YouTube that demonstrate how to tune a 3 string CBG as
well.

Chapter 9 – Fretted Acoustic Guitar
This guitar build documentation will be abridged.  Most of the same steps from chapters 3
through 8 remain the same and those steps will be referenced as needed.  It will be
covered in one chapter.
Parts:
Cigar box
1” x 2” x 4ft Poplar for the neck (actual measurements are 1.5” x .75”)
2ft of 1” x ¼” oak
Sound hole covers (7/8”)
Fret wire (medium/medium)
3 1/8” x ¾” rolled pins
3 machine head tuners (closed or open)
3/8” threaded rod
Acoustic guitar strings
Optional… if a piezo pickup is used
Guitar jack
Small piezo pickup
Tools needed:
Tape measure
Pencil
Straight edge
Band saw or Handsaw/Jigsaw
Wood glue
Clamps
Rasp, file and sandpaper
Router and 3/8” round over bit
7/8” drill bit for sound holes
Hot Glue gun and sticks
Super glue and epoxy
Miter box and coping saw
Dykes
Pliers
Hammer
Dremel with cutting wheel
3/8” drill bit for guitar jack
Guitar jack and small piezo pickup
< Step 9.1 – Box and Neck Fit >

The box being used measures 11.5” long by 6 7/8” tall (outside dimensions) and 11” long
by 6 3/8” tall (inside dimensions).  The neck on this guitar will extend through the box and
the strings will be secured in the section of neck that extends through the butt end of the
guitar.
Another difference on this guitar is that the back of the box will be the front of the guitar. 
The box is reversed because the back is mostly empty and allows a design to be wood
burned into it.
The neck is marked from the top… 4 inches for the machine tuners, 3/8 inch space for the
bridge and 25.5 inches from the bridge (minus 3/16 inch to make up for the roundness of
the 3/8” bolt that will be used as a bridge).  After those measurements are marked, lay the
box on top of the neck and adjust so that the bridge ends up about 1 to 1.5 inches from the
end of the box.  Measure another 1.5 inches beyond the end of the box. 
This neck ended up measuring a total of 32.5 inches.  Reference step 4.1 for more detail.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Since the neck will extend below the butt end of the guitar, both ends of the box lid are
marked and notched to fit on the neck.  Below is the notched box lid and the neck marked
to cut.  Since this guitar will be acoustic, it is important that the box lid be free to vibrate
and not be totally glued to the neck.  To accomplish this, the neck is marked to be cut 1/8
inch to accommodate the thickness of the lid and it is marked again (3/4” from both ends)
to be ¼ inch below the guitar lid.  See step 3.1 for details on cutting the lid.  Also note that
the hinge pins are removed just as was done on the electric guitar.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Below is a diagram showing the areas to be cut away from the neck.  The red cut lines are
the same as the electric guitar (to allow the neck and box to fit flush).  The blue cut lines
are unique to the acoustic guitar.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

A second piece of poplar is glued and clamped to the bottom of the neck.  It is measured to
be flush with the butt end of the guitar and to extend 3.5” beyond the top of the box.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

After the glue is dry, measure for the braces on the neck and measure/mark two braces. 
Reference step 4.5 for more detail.  Also, mark the angled cut at the bottom of the neck as
in step 4.4.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Then, mark an angle at the top of the neck from the 4” mark to the opposite end of the
neck as in step 4.4.
After the cuts are made, the pieces should look like this. 
A 3/8” round over bit was used to round off the edges.

The top of the neck looks like this after it is cut.  The cut piece is glued to the bottom to
create the back angle.

Both ends of the box should be flush with the neck.
Lastly, file and sand the braces to fit into the box and around the neck as shown, but do not
glue them yet.

< Step 9.2 – Neck Finalization >
Time to drill holes in the neck for the machine head tuners and, at the other end, for the
strings to pass through.
At the top of the neck, place masking tape prior to marking where the tuners will go.  The
long lines are 3/8” in from the edges and the other three marks are 1” apart on alternate
long lines.  This is where the 3 tuners will be installed.  Reference step 5.2 for more
details.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

At the bottom of the neck, on the part that will extend beyond the box, three holes need to
be drilled for the strings.  The center line is marked, followed by a parallel line on either
side, each 3/8 inch from the center.  The center line is marked ½” from the end and the
two parallel lines are marked ¼” further from the end.  This design gives a nice “V” look
to the strings.  They can also be in a straight line, diagonal, or any other design.  This is
just going to allow the strings to pass through the neck to secure them.  After the
measurements are done, drill 1/8” holes all the way through.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

After the holes are drilled, sand the whole neck as smooth as possible.  Finish the neck as
desired. This neck was stained black and coated with 6 coats of gloss clear (with light
sanding after every 2 coats).
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

This neck was finished with spare cigar bands prior to applying clear.
Another band was placed on the bottom of the neck too.
< Step 9.3 – Box and Neck Attachment >
When the neck is done, it is time to glue it to the box.  One additional cut was made to the
braces, which was not shown here.  The braces were trimmed to allow the sound holes to
be placed closer to the corners.  This additional trimming is seen in the below photos.

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

The box and neck are now glued together.  Notice how the trimmed braces still keep
significant contact in the corners, yet still allow sound holes to be drilled closer to the
corners.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

To mark the sound  holes, place masking tape on the top of the box, in the corners.  These
were measured to be 1” from the sides and 1.25” from both ends of the box.  Only three
sound holes are used.  The last corner will get a guitar jack for the piezo pickup that will
be installed.  The piezo pickup allows an acoustic guitar to be plugged into an amplifier,
without installing an actual pickup and still retaining the characteristics of an acoustic
guitar.  If no piezo pickup is desired, a fourth sound hole could be used instead of the
guitar jack. 
Notes: _________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

The inside of the box after the sound hole covers are pressed into place.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 9.4 – Adding a Jack and Piezo Pickup >
If no piezo pickup is desired, this step can be skipped completely.  As mentioned earlier, a
sound hole can be placed where the jack will be installed.
A 3/8” hole is made centered on the same measurements used for the sound holes (1” from
side, 1.25” from end of box).  This keeps everything square when looking at the guitar. 
Install the guitar jack in the hole.
Notes: _________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

The piezo is prepared by hot gluing it into a bottle cap and covering it in hot glue.  Piezos
act like microphones and will pick up and vibration in the guitar, not just the strings.  This
method helps dampen the vibrations from the box.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

When the hot glue is cooled, sand the top of the bottle cap to prepare it to be glued inside
the guitar with epoxy.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

The piezo should be placed as close to the bridge as possible (exactly underneath if
possible).  The black wire is soldered to the ground terminal of the jack and the red wire is
soldered to the other terminal.  It can be plugged into an amplifier to confirm it functions
correctly.  Just give the guitar some taps and it should sound through the amplifier.
That is it.  That is all there is to installing a piezo pickup.  For simplicity of design and
look, there is no volume control used on this guitar.  If a volume control is desired, see
chapter 7 on wiring.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 9.5 – Fretboard >
Using a tape measure, measure how long the fretboard should be.  It should start after the
3/8” space left on the neck for the 3/8” threaded rod that will be used as a nut.  The
fretboard will extend the length of the neck and onto the box slightly.  The full length
depends on the box, personal preferences and how it looks. 
This fretboard is 15.75” long.  A special design was cut into the end using a ¾” drill bit to
drill 2 equally spaced holes in the end, making a double arch design.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

The bridge base is measured and placed on the guitar to perform a double check prior to
moving forward with the fretboard.  If everything measures out right and looks right,
proceed.  If not, re-measure the fretboard and start over.  The bridge base is a 3” piece of
oak (same as used for the fretboard) that has been cleared with polyacrylic.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Using an online fret measurement tool, the 25.5” scale is marked along the fretboard. 
Because a 3/8” bolt will be used as the nut, and the roundness of the bolt means the strings
will be touching the nut on top, half the thickness of the bolt is added to the top end of the
fretboard.  The easiest way to do this is to slide the ruler, or tape measure, 3/16” beyond
the top of the fretboard before any fret measurements are made.  This ruler measures
millimeters on one side and inches on the other.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
*24 inches = 609.6 mm
*24.5 inches = 622.3 mm
*25 inches = 635 mm
*25.5 inches = 647.7 mm
*26 inches = 660.4 mm

After all the measurements are applied to the fretboard with tick marks, use a straight edge
to make straight lines across the fretboard.  For more on fret marking, see step 6.1.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Use a miter box to make straight, 90 degree cuts along each line using a coping saw.  Only
cut down into the fretboard slightly less than the thickness of the blade.  Below is a home
made miter box.  Do not cut too deep.  If not cut deep enough, the frets will not seat all the
way into the slots, but the slots can be deepened later.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Sand the fretboard smooth now, before any frets are installed.  The fretboard below has all
of the slots cut and has been sanded.  The fret wire is ready to be cut to length.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Lay the fret wire in a slot (snug, not tight) with one end extending just over the edge of the
fretboard.  Using dykes, cut the other end of the fret wire just past the edge of the
fretboard.  The fret wire should by about 1/32” beyond the edge of the fretboard on either
side.  The less fret wire extending beyond the fretboard means less filing that needs to be
done.  Do not cut the fret wire shorter than the width of the fretboard.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

After all the frets are cut, place three small drops of super glue along one of the slots cut
into the fretboard (one drop on either side and one in the middle) or place the glue on the
edge of the fret that will be pressed into the slot.  Place a scrap piece of wood over the fret
wire and tap it into place with a hammer.  It should seat tightly and the fret wire should be
flat against the fretboard.  If excess super glue gets on the fretboard, wipe it off
immediately and sand it later.  Repeat until all frets are glued in place and let the super
glue sit for at least an hour so that it is fully cured.  If not fully cured, the fret wire may
unseat when filing.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

File the edges of the fret wire flat against the edge of the fretboard.  After all the edges are
flat, angle the file to about 45 degrees and file the edges to put a smooth curve on the ends.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Use a small triangular file to file any sharp edges, then use sandpaper to put a final smooth
surface along the edge.  The fretboard and frets should be completely flush and smooth. 
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Scale markers should be placed on the 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, etc… frets.  Step 6.2 shows how
to file simple markers into the edge of the fretboard.  Other ways to mark the scale is to
inlay round or diamond markers into the surface of the fretboard, or to countersink BBs
into the edge of the fretboard.  This guitar had holes drilled through the surface of the
fretboard, along the edge, and lighter colored dowels glued into the holes.  Make sure to
put the scale markers on the correct side of the fretboard.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

When done, glue the fretboard to the neck.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

< Step 9.6 – Finishing the guitar >
The guitar is nearly complete now… At this time the back can be either screwed on or
glued on since there is no need to go inside it again.  If gluing, make sure to clamp it tight.
Install the tuners as in step 8.1.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

At the other end of the guitar, use a hammer to tap the rolled pins into the 1/8” holes from
the back.  Make sure the opening of the pin faces away from the guitar.  A countersink can
be used to help set the pins to the right depth.  The pins prevent the strings from digging
into the wood.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

From the threaded rod, cut a 1.5” length (nut) and a 2” length (bridge).  File the edges
smooth.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

The nut can be glued to the top of the fretboard with super glue or a little epoxy.
The bridge base is glued to the surface of the guitar and the bridge is placed on top (not
glued).
The center string is placed through the center rolled pin.

See step 8.3 for more on finishing the strings.

After the strings are installed see section 8.5 for more on open G tuning.  Then… You’re
DONE.  Time to kick back and enjoy your new guitar.

Appendix A – Wood burning
Wood burning is a great way to put your own personality into a guitar and make it truly
unique.  And, it is easy.  To apply a design to the wood, place carbon paper between the
paper and the wood.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Trace the design with a pencil.
Viola!  The design is on the wood.
A good wood burning station has an adjustable temperature and interchangeable tips.

Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

This is a piece of scrap fretboard being use to practice on first.  Different grains of the
wood burn faster that others.  Practice different temperatures, pressures and speed on the
scrap wood.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
*(What temperature setting works best for you on each wood type?)

When confident, attack the design.  A little imperfection looks good and reminds others
that the work was done by hand.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________


Appendix B – Headstock Design
Many guitars have simple, wood grain headstock.  They look great and classic.  But to
make a guitar truly unique, more customization is needed.  There are many ways to
customize the headstock of a guitar.  One could laminate different woods, add wood to
make it wider or cut a different design into it.  The favorite method of this luthier is to use
spray adhesive.  Spray adhesive can be used to apply cigar bands, labels from inside cigar
boxes, beer can, or photos printed on photo paper.  Below are some examples to inspire
creativity.
Label from inside cigar box…

Beer can…
Reproduced label on photo paper…
The headstock decoration is only limited to your imagination.

Appendix C – Pickups
Purchased pickups work great but look like everyone else’s.  Custom pickups on the other
hand sound great and look even better.  Hand made pickups can be wound by hand, or
with a jig.
This jig is very simple.  It is all placed on a piece of plywood.  The spool of magnet wire
is on a removable dowel.  The magnet wire is threaded through two adjustable wire
guides.  The hand drill is from a crafting supply store and is secured with wire ties to a
simple wood plate glued to the plywood.  A reed switch is wired to a pedometer to count
the revolutions.  Inside the pedometer are two contacts that increment the counter every
time they make contact.  It is these two contacts that are wired to the reed switch.  The
reed switch is triggered by a magnet on the end of the drill (silver magnet on right side of
chuck in photo).

Another view of the reed switch and magnet…  Also note the jig secured in the end of the
chuck.  It is a scrap piece of oak fretboard with three nails through it.  The middle nail is
about 1” long and is tight in the chuck.  The other two nails are ½” from the center and are
about 3/8” long.  All are glued in place with epoxy.  A set up like this lets the magnets ,on
the pickup being made, to stick to the drill magnetically.  It is easy to put a pickup on or
remove it this way. 
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Pickups are made on bobbins.  This bobbin is made of an oak wood top (from a scrap
piece of fretboard), 3 nails cut to 1” and a circuit board.  There is one magnet secured with
epoxy to the bottom of this one.  Two additional magnets will be glued to the end of the
other two nails.  Each nail is ½” apart.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

After all three magnets are secured with epoxy, solder the end of the magnet wire to one
corner of the circuit board.  Using circuit board makes this part very easy.  Pickup
manufacturers use 42 or 43 gauge magnet wire.  It is very fragile and difficult to see.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Attach the bobbin to the end of the drill after the magnet wire is soldered to the circuit
board.  Turn the drill handle to start winding the pickup.  Make sure the counter is
incrementing and adjust the wire guides to wind the pickup.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

A little masking tape was used to steady the pickup and prevent snags.  The more
windings, the louder and stronger the pickup.  A low winding count would be around 6000
turns and a normal winding count would be 7000-8000 turns.
Notice the multiple holes drilled into the base of the jig so that the guide can be moved to
exactly the right position.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

After every 2000 turns apply a coat of polyacrylic to keep the wire from vibrating inside
the pickup.  This is called “potting” the pickup and is normally done with hot wax.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

When the pickup is done, solder the end of the magnet wire to another corner of the circuit
board.  Then verify continuity with a multimeter.  Set it to continuity and place both
probes on the two solder joints of the pickup.
With continuity confirmed, the pickup is done.
Notes: _________________________________________________________
