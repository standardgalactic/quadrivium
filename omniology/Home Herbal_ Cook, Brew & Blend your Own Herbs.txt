Dragana Vilinac
A fourth-generation herbalist

medicine has taken her around 
the world, and has led her to

According to the World Health Organization, 
herbal remedies are the most widespread 
system of medicine used in the world. In 
many developed countries, that knowledge 
was almost lost, but the last couple of 
decades have seen a renewed interest in 
herbal remedies, and more and more people 
are recognizing the many beneﬁts of using 
them to treat themselves and their family. 
Used appropriately, herbs can be a 
satisfying part of a more holistic lifestyle, 
and many herbs are of course the starting 
point of much of the modern medicine used 
today. When used with common sense, 
herbal remedies are a safe and effective 
form of home help. If we can treat colds, ﬂu, 
or minor injuries in the early stages, we can 
often prevent the development of something 
more serious and avoid using conventional 
drugs with their risk of side-effects.
Learning which herbs work for us enables 
us to learn more about the plants that 
surround us, as well as our own healing 
Introduction
processes. However, some herbs are not 
suitable for everyone or at every stage  
of life (during pregnancy, for example); if  
in any doubt you should always consult  
a medical practitioner.
We have “tried and tested” all the recipes  
in this book, so we can promise they are 
delicious as well as being good for you.  
We are excited to have the opportunity  
to introduce you to some more unusual  
plants and ﬂavors so you can be more 
adventurous while trusting that your  
health and well-being will beneﬁt.
Neal’s Yard Remedies has over thirty  
years of expertise and passion in creating 
wonderful, natural hair- and skincare 
products and we are delighted to share 
some of our favorite ways of using herbs  
to heal and nurture your skin. Enjoy creating 
and using your own herbal remedies!

Neal’s Yard Remedies
Consultant’s note
Hippocrates, the father of medicine, wrote: “Let food 
be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food.” Many 
herbs described in this book are used both as tasty 
foods and as medicines, and the delicious recipes 
provide new ideas for combining healthy ingredients. 
Although the herbal medicines have not yet all been 
researched by modern science, most have stood the 
test of time. You should always see your doctor  
for serious health problems, but I hope this book 
will help readers to treat and prevent minor 
illnesses, and to understand treatments prescribed 
by their herbalist.

shingles, ringworm, insect bites, allergic 
rashes, eczema, or any itchy skin condition. 
TINCTURE Made from the whole pulped 
leaf. Take 1 tsp (5ml) 3 times daily for 
constipation or take 10–60 drops (0.5–3ml) 
3 times daily for poor appetite or to 
stimulate bile ﬂow in sluggish digestion.
CAPSULES Commercially made from 
powdered leaf. Use in 100–500mg doses 
for constipation.
HAIR RINSE Combine 2 tsp (10ml) of gel 
with 1⁄2 cup of standard chamomile 
infusion (p342) and use as a conditioner.
GROW Prefers well-drained sandy soil in 
full sun with a moderate summer water 
supply and dry winters. Usually propagated 
by breaking off and replanting the small 
offsets that appear on mature plants, but 
can be grown from seeds sown in spring 
or early summer at 70°F (21°C). Grown as 
a houseplant in temperate areas; beneﬁts 
from being kept outside in warm summers.
FORAGE Likely to be found growing wild in 
tropical regions only. Easily confused with 
many related, generally larger, species 
that grow outside in warmer regions.
HARVEST Collect the gel and leaves from 
plants as required throughout the year.
CAUTION Do not take aloe vera 
internally during pregnancy.

Aloysia triphylla Lemon verbena
Originally found growing in rocky areas of Chile and Argentina, lemon verbena is now cultivated 
worldwide both as a highly aromatic garden ornamental and for use in perfumery. It is also used 
in potpourri or in cooking to give a strong lemony taste to desserts, marinades, and fruit drinks.  
It is traditionally regarded as both soothing and uplifting, so is used in restorative teas.
PARTS USED Leaves, essential oil
MAIN CONSTITUENTS Volatile oil 
(incl. citral, nerol, and geraniol)
ACTIONS Sedative, carminative, 
antispasmodic, febrifuge, stimulates liver 
and gall bladder function, some antifungal 
activity (to Candida albicans) reported
INFUSION Use 1⁄2 tsp dried leaves per cup 
(p342) after meals for ﬂatulence or at night 
for insomnia. Combine with dandelion 
leaves and drink 3 times daily to improve 
liver function. Can be used to ease feverish 
conditions in children; consult a herbalist 
for advice on dosage.
BATHS Add 1 cup of above infusion 
to bathwater to ease stress and tension.
MASSAGE OIL True lemon verbena oil is 
difﬁcult to obtain, as it is often adulterated 
with other lemon-scented oils. Use 5 drops 
in 1 tbsp (15ml) of almond oil as a massage 
for cramps, indigestion, anxiety, insomnia, 
or other stress-related conditions.
GROW Prefers full sun and moist but 
well-drained soil. Usually propagated by 
heeled softwood cuttings in summer; it also 
self-seeds if it sets fruit after a hot summer. 
It is not frost-hardy, so in colder areas is best 
grown in containers and over-wintered 
under glass. Alternatively, cut back to the 
wood, keep dry, and protect with ﬂeece or 
straw lagging in winter (it should survive 
temperatures as low as 5°F/-15°C).
FORAGE Unlikely to be found growing 
wild outside South America, although 
self-seeding in warmer areas is possible. 
HARVEST Collect the leaves in summer.
CAUTION Prolonged use or large 
internal doses can cause gastric 
irritation. The oil can irritate sensitive 
skin and is photosensitizing, so avoid 
bright sunlight if using it externally.

emmenagogue, diuretic, tonic
HOW TO USE
INFUSION Pour 1 cup of boiling water 
over 1–2 tsp of crushed seeds. Drink 1 cup 
3 times daily for menstrual cramps or 
colic in adults, or drink 1 cup a day to 
improve milk ﬂow when breastfeeding.  
For children with gas or colic, reduce the 
dosage according to age. For children 
aged 1–2, use 2 tsp (10 ml) of a standard
infusion diluted with 31⁄2 ﬂ oz (100 ml) of 
warm water per dose; for children aged 
3–4, use 4 tsp (20 ml) of a standard 
infusion similarly diluted.
TINCTURE Take 60 drops–1 tsp (3–5ml) 
of a tincture of the seeds 3 times daily for 
poor appetite or ﬂatulence.
ESSENTIAL OIL Add 5 drops of essential 
oil to 1 tsp (5ml) almond oil and use as   
a chest rub for bronchitis and productive 
coughs (a cough that produces phlegm, 
rather than a dry cough).
HOW TO SOURCE
GROW Prefers deep, fertile, well-drained 
soil and full sun. Sow seeds where you 
want them to grow in spring, and thin out 
seedlings to 3–4in (7.5–10cm) if required. 
The plant is biennial, ﬂowering in its 
second year. Caraway requires a long, hot 
growing season to set seed, so it may not 
produce as many seeds in cooler areas.
FORAGE Found in grassy areas or 
wastelands. In warmer climates it will set 
seed in late summer; in cooler areas seeds 
are likely only if the summer has been hot.
HARVEST Collect ripe seeds in 
late summer.

can be grown in warmer areas from seeds 
sown directly in the spring. It prefers 
marshy ditches and riverbanks, so is best 
grown in partial shade in moist soil. It has 
an indeﬁnite spread, so can make useful 
ground cover with the right growing 
conditions, but can become invasive.
FORAGE The whole plant can be gathered 
at any time where it is naturalized (parts  
of southern Africa, South America, the 
southern United States, and its native Asia).

FLUID EXTRACT Extracts have been 
successfully used for parasitic worm 
infections in sheep and cattle, although 
there is little research as to the effect  
on human parasites.
 
GROW Prefers fertile, moist, but well-
drained, neutral to alkaline soil in full  
sun. Sow seeds in a cold frame in autumn 
or spring and when the seedlings are 
established transplant them to ﬁnal 
positions in rows at least 24in (60cm) 
apart. Dead-head the ﬂowers regularly,  
as the plant can be a proliﬁc self-seeder.
FORAGE Sometimes found in hedges 
and ﬁeld borders, especially in southern 
Europe. The leaves can be collected during 
summer. They have a bitter taste and can 
be boiled to improve their ﬂavor.

FLUID EXTRACT Take 20–40 drops (1–2ml) 
in a little water 3 times daily for arthritis: 
usually combined with other herbs such as 
black cohosh, cramp bark, meadowsweet, 
or white willow for rheumatoid arthritis. 
Also useful to stimulate liver function.
GROW Prefers light to medium (sandy to 
loamy) soil that is moist but well drained, 
and requires partial shade. Usually grown 
from root cuttings, or from pea-sized 
tubers found growing in the leaf axils in 
late summer that can be collected and 
planted immediately. The plants are 
dioecious (have separate sexes), so both 
male and female plants are needed to set 
seeds, which can be sown in a cold frame 
in early spring and transplanted when 
large enough to handle.
FORAGE Generally found in damp woods, 
swamps, thickets, and hedges in  
central and southern US and parts  
of central America. 
HARVEST Dig tubers and roots in autumn, 
and wash and dry them.

Eupatorium purpureum Gravel root
Originally found in damp thickets in the eastern US, gravel root is grown as a statuesque garden 
ornamental in many parts of the world. Its other common name, Joe Pye weed, is reputedly 
named after a Native American medicine man who used it to cure typhus. The herb is used for 
clearing gravel and kidney stones and for other problems affecting the urinary tract.
PARTS USED Rhizome and root
MAIN CONSTITUENTS Eupatorin, volatile 
oil, ﬂavonoids, resin
ACTIONS Soothing diuretic, anti-lithic, 
tonic, antirheumatic, astringent
DECOCTION Take 1⁄2 cup of a decoction 
made of 1 tsp dried root to 1 cup water  
and simmered for 20 minutes for kidney 
stones, gravel, or painful urination. This 
mixture was traditionally used to ease the 
pain of childbirth. Gravel root is believed to 
enhance the removal of waste products by 
the kidneys, so the decoction is also useful 
in rheumatism and gout to improve the 
excretion of uric acid.
TINCTURE Use 40–80 drops (2–4 ml) 
3 times daily for urinary disorders 
including cystitis and gravel, or discharges 
associated with infection. It combines well 
with white dead-nettle (Lamium album)s 
for prostate problems and with parsley 
piert (Aphanes arvensis), pellitory-of-the-
wall (Parietaria judaica), or hydrangea 
(Hydrangea spp.) for kidney stones.
 
GROW Prefers moist, fertile soil in sun 
or partial shade. Sow seeds in spring in  
a cold frame and when the seedlings are 
large enough to handle, transplant them to 
ﬁnal positions. Allow at least 36in (90cm) 
between plants. It is best grown at the 
back of a border, but is popular in planting 
schemes as it ﬂowers late in the season.
FORAGE Unlikely to be found growing 
wild beyond the eastern part of the US, 
although it might occur as a garden 
escape. As the root is used, it is best not to 
collect from the wild. In Europe the related 
species Eupatorium cannabinum (hemp 
agrimony, p54) is more likely to be found 
growing as a hedge plant.
HARVEST The roots of two-year-old, 
or older, plants are dug in autumn.

(incl. kaempferol and quercetin), saponins, 
bitters, volatile oil (incl. eugenol and 
safrole), choline, gallic acid
ACTIONS Astringent, stops internal and 
external bleeding, anti-inﬂammatory
DISTILLATE/HYDROSOL The leaves 
and twigs are distilled commercially to 
produce a mixture of water and essential 
oil (sometimes preserved with alcohol).  
It can be used to stop bleeding from cuts, 
scrapes, or nosebleeds, to bathe varicose 
veins and irritant skin rashes, and in 
compresses for sprains or sore eyes.
INFUSION Pour 1 cup boiling water over 
1 tsp leaves and drink 1 cup 3 times daily for 
diarrhea, hemorrhoids, or capillary fragility.
MOUTHWASH/GARGLE Use 1 cup of 
above infusion of the leaves for sore 
throats, mouth ulcers, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, 
and spongy or bleeding gums.
TINCTURE Add 1 tsp (5ml) of the bark 
tincture to 13⁄4ﬂ oz (50ml) of water and use 
as an alternative to distilled witch hazel.
CREAM/OINTMENT Use the bark 
for minor cuts, scrapes, bruises, 
hemorrhoids, or varicose veins.
GROW Prefers moist, rich, sandy, or peaty 
soil with partial shade, but can tolerate 
poorer soil and full sun. Sow ripe seeds in

Humulus lupulus Hops
The strobiles, or female ﬂowers, of the hop plant have been used since the 11th century for brewing 
beer, while the Romans used the leaves as a salad herb. The plant, which is native to Europe, is 
sedative and bitter, so it is used medicinally both for nervous disorders and digestive problems.  
It is also estrogenic, leading to a loss of libido in men who regularly drink large amounts of beer.
An infusion of the 
female ﬂowers was 
once mixed with bread 
to keep the dough  
light and improve  
its rising qualities
FLOWERS 
Male and female ﬂowers 
occur on separate plants. 
The male ﬂowers are tiny, 
green, and produced in 
branched clusters while 
the larger female ﬂowers 
are the familiar strobiles 
under soft green bracts

Rumex crispus Yellow dock
Native throughout Europe and Africa, yellow dock is a common wayside plant and garden weed 
that thrives on shrubby waste ground and grass verges. Its main use today is as a detoxifying 
herb and as a mild laxative. It is often combined with other herbs, such as burdock root, in the 
treatment of chronic skin conditions.
PARTS USED Root
MAIN CONSTITUENTS Anthraquinones 
(incl. emodin and chrysophanol), tannins, 
oxalates, volatile oil
ACTIONS Blood and lymphatic cleanser, 
bitter tonic, stimulates bile ﬂow, laxative
DECOCTION Take 1⁄2–1 cup 3 times daily of 
a decoction made from 1⁄2oz (15g) of root to 
17ﬂ oz (550ml) of water simmered gently 
for 20 minutes for mild constipation, or to 
stimulate bile ﬂow to improve the digestion 
and help clear toxins from the system.
TINCTURE Take 20–40 drops (1–2ml) of 
tincture 3 times daily as part of a cleansing 
regime for conditions such as irritant skin 
rashes and eczema, boils, acne, shingles, 
rheumatism, and osteoarthritis.
MOUTHWASH Use 1⁄2 cup of the decoction 
(made as above) diluted with an equal 
amount of warm water 2–3 times daily  
for mouth ulcers.
HOMOEOPATHIC EXTRACTS In 
homoeopathy, yellow dock root is used  
for coughs, sore throats, and hoarseness 
made worse by cold air and damp weather. 
Take 1–2 tablets up to 3 times daily.
GROW A perennial weed that self-seeds 
enthusiastically, and which few people 
would want to cultivate in their gardens. 
Seeds can be gathered from hedges in 
autumn if required and scattered where 
you want them to grow. Once established, 
the plant can be difﬁcult to eradicate 
thanks to its tough root. It will tolerate  
any soil and grows in both sun and shade.
FORAGE The roots are long and can be 
difﬁcult to dig up unless the ground has 
been well wetted ﬁrst. Gather in autumn.
HARVEST Dig up the roots in autumn, 
wash thoroughly, chop, and dry.
CAUTION Do not take in pregnancy or 
when breastfeeding. Use for occasional 
constipation; for chronic constipation, 
consult a herbalist.

SALIX ALBA WHITE WILLOW 101
LEAVES
The narrow, tapering 
silvery leaves were once 
associated with the moon, 
so the tree was regarded 
as cooling
80ft
(25m)
Salix alba White willow
Originally found in temperate or cold regions in the northern hemisphere, white willow was 
classiﬁed as a cool and moist remedy due to its preference for growing near water. In 1828 the 
Bavarian pharmacist, Johann Buchner (1783–1852), extracted bitter-tasting crystals—which  
he named salicin—from the bark; these were synthesized as aspirin by Bayer in 1899.
PARTS USED Bark, leaves
MAIN CONSTITUENTS Salicin, salicylic 
acid, tannins, ﬂavonoids
ACTIONS Antirheumatic, anti-
inﬂammatory, febrifuge, antihidrotic 
(reduces sweating), analgesic, antiseptic, 
astringent, bitter digestive tonic
FLUID EXTRACT Take 20–40 drops (1–2ml) 
of the bark extract in water 3 times daily 
for rheumatic conditions, lumbago, sciatica, 
and neuralgia. Combine with an equal 
amount of rosemary tincture for headaches.
TINCTURE Use 1–2 tsp (5–10ml) doses 
of the bark tincture (p342) 3 times daily  
for fevers: generally combined with other 
herbs such as boneset (Eupatorium 
perfoliatum) or elderﬂower. Add 20–40 
drops to menopausal remedies to help 
reduce night sweats and hot ﬂashes. 
DECOCTION Drink 1 cup (1–2 tsp bark 
per cup of boiling water) 3 times daily for 
feverish chills, headaches, or as part of 
arthritic treatments with herbs such as  
St. John’s wort and crampbark.
INFUSION Drink 1 cup (1–2 tsp leaves 
per cup of boiling water) after meals  
for indigestion.
GROW Prefers moist but well-drained soil. 
Propagate from semi-ripe cuttings in 
summer or hardwood cuttings in winter, 
although it can be grown from seed.
FORAGE Often found growing near water 
such as rivers or canals. The leaves were 
once collected in summer and used in 
infusions as a fever remedy, for colicky 
pains, or for digestive problems, although 
they are no longer commercially 
harvested. The bark should not be  
stripped from wild trees.
HARVEST The bark is stripped in spring 
from branches of two- to ﬁve-year-old 
trees that have been pollarded.
CAUTION Avoid if allergic to aspirin 
or salicylates. Avoid during pregnancy.

valepotriates, alkaloids
ACTIONS Sedative, hypnotic, nervine, 
antispasmodic, expectorant, diuretic, 
hypotensive, carminative, mildly analgesic
MACERATION Valerian root is best made 
into a maceration rather than a decoction. 
Soak scant 1oz (25g) of the chopped, 
preferably fresh, root for 8–10 hours in  
1 pint (600ml) of cold water. Take 1 cup  
up to 3 times daily for anxiety, nervous 
tension, or high blood pressure linked to 
stress. Take a cup before bed for insomnia.
CAPSULES The ground root may be added 
to capsules (also commercially available).
TINCTURE Take 20 drops–1 tsp (1–5ml) 
up to 3 times daily for nervous problems. 
Dosage can vary considerably between 
individuals, with higher doses causing 
headaches in some, so start with low doses.
COMPRESS Soak a pad in a cup of 
maceration or the diluted tincture and  
apply to muscle cramps or the abdomen  
for period pain and colic.
GROW Prefers moist soil in a sunny 
or partially shaded area; suitable for  
a woodland garden. Sow seeds in a cold 
frame in spring, transplant to pots, and 
plant out when established, or propagate 
by root division in spring or autumn. 
FORAGE Usually found in woodland edges 
or damp grass. Easily confused with the 
popular garden plant red, or American, 
valerian (Centranthus ruber).
HARVEST Dig roots and rhizomes of plants 
that are at least 2 years old in autumn. 
CAUTION Enhances the action of 
sleep-inducing drugs, so avoid if taking 
such medication.

RECIPE CHOOSER
140
Our skin may form a wonderfully protective barrier against the outside world, but it is 
also a mirror of our inner health. Effective cleansing and care can maintain skin and  
hair health from the outside, but most skin problems require both internal and external 
remedies to effectively relieve and treat symptoms such as rashes, spots, and itching. 
This chart is not comprehensive, but it does contain the key herbs for skin health.
Healthy skin and hair
Herb
Calendula 
Calendula ofﬁcinalis 
(p36)
A soothing herb that also stimulates healing of the skin. Take an infusion of the herb or 
dilute the tincture for abrasions, wounds, ulcers, or as a mouthwash. Use as a cream  
or macerated oil to relieve eczema, rashes, or sore skin.
Action
Oats 
Avena sativa (p33)
Cleansing and soothing, oats make a good alternative to soap or detergents for very 
sensitive skin. Grind oats to a powder and add to the bath water, or mix with a little water 
or oil to make a soothing mask or cleanser.
Chamomile 
Matricaria recutita 
(p80)
Soothing and anti-inﬂammatory. Use cooled chamomile tea as a lotion to relieve any hot, 
inﬂamed skin condition (e.g. sunburn, hives, or rashes). Drink the tea, with its calming 
and anti-allergenic properties, to alleviate eczema, rashes, and so on.
Chickweed 
Stellaria media (p111)
A wonderfully cooling and soothing herb for the skin, chickweed will relieve any irritation 
such as eczema, psoriasis, hives, or ulcers. Mash the fresh plant, adding a little boiling water, 
wrap in a cheesecloth, and apply once cold as a poultice to the skin.
Burdock root 
Arctium lappa (p28)
One of the most effective cleansing herbs, which is used internally to treat chronic skin 
problems such as psoriasis, eczema, acne, persistent boils, ulcers, and so on. Combine 
with dandelion and make a decoction of the root, or take the tincture.
Lavender 
Lavandula 
angustifolia (p74)
The soothing, anti-inﬂammatory, and antiseptic properties of lavender make it a very 
versatile herb. Use the essential oil or a cooled infusion to calm rashes, redness, eczema, 
sunburn, thrush, and so on.
Dandelion leaf 
Taraxacum ofﬁcinale 
(p114)
One of the best-known cleansing herbs, dandelion leaf can be combined with burdock and 
red clover and taken as an infusion three times a day for several weeks to help clear acne, 
eczema, psoriasis, or problem skin.
Nettle 
Urtica dioica (p124)
Taken internally as an infusion, nettles help to reduce inﬂammation and have an anti-
allergenic action. Combine with chamomile for urticaria (hives) or any itchy rash. Allow the 
infusion to cool and use as an excellent ﬁnal rinse for dandruff or psoriasis of the scalp.
Thyme 
Thymus vulgaris 
(p116)
An effective antiseptic and antifungal herb. Dilute the essential oil in a base oil to treat 
fungal infections such as ringworm, thrush, and athlete’s foot. Make a strong infusion to 
use as a lotion to prevent infection, for example in wounds, ulcers, or gum disease.
Red clover 
Trifolium pratense 
(p119)
A cleansing herb that promotes healing of the skin. Combine with dandelion and burdock 
and drink as an infusion or as tinctures to help clear eczema, psoriasis, recurrent boils, or 
any chronic skin disease.

Careless eating habits, drugs, emotional upsets, and stress can all trigger a variety of 
symptoms, so keeping the digestive system in good working order is essential to our

In the West we tend to look to herbs to treat speciﬁc problems (unlike traditional Chinese 
medicine, where herbs are recognized for their virtues as energy tonics), and modern 
research is backing up the beneﬁts of certain herbs to deal with prostate health, infertility, 
erectile dysfunction, and stress. If any symptoms worsen or are persistent, seek medical 
advice. This chart is not comprehensive, but it does contain the key herbs for men’s health.
Herb
Saw palmetto 
Serenoa repens
Proven to relieve the symptoms of an enlarged prostate by reducing elevated testosterone 
levels. It acts as an antiseptic diuretic in the treatment of cystitis or urethritis. Traditionally 
used as a male aphrodisiac, and to treat infertility. Best taken as a tincture or capsules.
Action
Ginkgo 
Ginkgo biloba (p61)
Proven to stimulate peripheral circulation. It has a direct effect on the blood ﬂow to the 
penile arteries and veins, and is used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and impotence. 
Combine with cinnamon in an infusion, or drink the tincture regularly for a few months.
Damiana 
Turnera diffusa
Acts as an antidepressant and energy tonic and helps to combat chronic exhaustion and 
anxiety. It is also used to treat premature ejaculation, impotence, and a loss of interest in 
sex. Take in combination with other appropriate herbs as an infusion or tinctures.
Ashwagandha 
Withania somnifera 
(p135)
A traditional energy tonic from the Ayurvedic tradition, this herb is used to combat stress 
and as an aphrodisiac. Used in the treatment of chronic stress, anemia, impotence, and 
infertility. Best taken as a tincture or capsules.
Ginseng 
Panax ginseng (p88)
The most famous of all energy or “chi” tonics from the Chinese tradition, ginseng has  
a long tradition as an aphrodisiac and to generally improve stamina and boost natural 
immunity and resistance to stress. Best taken as capsules, a tincture, or in soups.
Goji berries 
Lycium barbarum 
(p79)
Goji berries have established a reputation in the West as a “superfood,” and are used in 
traditional Chinese medicine as a blood tonic and to promote longevity.  Eat the berries or 
combine the tincture with damiana as an energy tonic and as an aphrodisiac.
Schisandra 
Schisandra chinensis 
(p107)
A major tonic herb that acts to protect the liver, it is also frequently used as a sexual tonic

Every home should have a few simple herbal remedies on hand in addition to a ﬁrst-aid 
kit. Many situations that need a ﬁrst-aid solution—such as minor accidents and injuries, 
insect bites and stings, abrasions, and minor burns and scalds—will also beneﬁt from the 
healing properties of an herbal remedy. If you are in any doubt, seek medical advice ﬁrst. 
This chart is not comprehensive, but it does contain the key herbs for emergency aid.
First Aid
Herb
Aloe vera 
Aloe vera (p20)
Highly effective soothing and cooling properties. Break off a leaf from a fresh plant, split  
it open, and use the fresh gel to soothe rashes, minor burns, scalds, or sunburn. 
Alternatively, buy aloe vera juice.
Action
Calendula 
Calendula ofﬁcinalis 
(p36)
An antiseptic and healing herb. Combine the tincture with St. John’s wort and dab neat onto 
spots, or dilute 1 teaspoon in half a cup of boiled water to use as an antiseptic and cleansing 
lotion for abrasions, or use as a healing cream.
Chamomile 
Matricaria recutita 
(p80)
Soothing and calming. Sip the tea to ease fevers, insomnia, and nausea, or sweeten with 
honey to relieve shock. The cooled tea can be used as a cooling and soothing lotion for 
inﬂamed skin and rashes.
Comfrey 
Symphytum ofﬁcinale 
(p112)
Traditionally known as “knitbone” because of its healing properties. Pound the fresh 
leaves into a pulp and apply as a poultice for sprains, bruises, and ulcers. Alternatively, 
apply as a macerated oil or cream.
Echinacea

(p50)
Known as “nature’s antibiotic’,” echinacea should be used whenever necessary to prevent an 
infection. Dilute the tincture and use as a lotion for wounds, insect or animal bites, and stings. 
Also take internally to boost immunity.
Garlic 
Allium sativum (p19)
A pungent but effective kitchen herb with antiseptic and anticatarrhal properties. Eat  
a raw clove twice daily to alleviate congestion and help prevent infections. A fresh clove 
rubbed onto an infected spot or boil is also effective.
Lavender 
Lavandula 
angustifolia (p74)
Healing, calming and anti-inﬂammatory, this versatile essential oil can be dabbed onto 
the skin to relieve insect bites, sunburn or minor burns, and scalds. Inhaling the oil can 
relieve shock, or dab a little on the temples to alleviate tension headaches or insomnia.
Plantain 
Plantago lanceolata 
(p90)
A naturally soothing herb with an antihistamine action. Bruise the fresh leaves and  
apply to rashes, insect bites, and stings to calm the irritation. Combine the tincture  
with calendula as a healing mouthwash or for cuts and abrasions.
Slippery elm 
Ulmus rubra (p123)
Lines the stomach and reduces inﬂammation: mix with water and drink to relieve 
indigestion, gastritis, and stomach upsets. Mix a little water into a paste to make  
a poultice to draw out splinters, boils, and abscesses.
Witch hazel 
Hamamelis virginiana 
(p63)
This plant is well known as an instantly cooling and soothing herb. Soak some cotton balls

No medicinal herb other than those known to be safe as everyday foods should be taken 
during early pregnancy or while breastfeeding without the advice of a qualiﬁed herbalist. 
However, some dietary plants and external lotions can relieve common ailments such  
as morning sickness or varicose veins, and heal the body after childbirth. This chart 
contains the key herbs that are beneﬁcial for pre- and postnatal mothers.
Pregnancy and childbirth
Herb
Ginger 
Zingiber ofﬁcinale
A highly effective anti-emetic that helps to relieve the symptoms of nausea and  
morning sickness. Add a couple of slices of fresh ginger root to a cupful of hot water  
and sip as required.
Action
Chamomile 
Matricaria recutita 
(p80)
A versatile and gentle everyday herb that is calming and soothing to the nerves and 
digestion. Drink a cupful of infusion to relieve morning sickness, stress and tension, to aid 
relaxation before going to sleep, and as an aid to digestion.
Witch hazel 
Hamamelis virginiana 
(p63)
A cooling and astringent herb that beneﬁts veins. Soak cotton balls in distilled witch hazel and 
apply to aching legs, varicose veins, or hemorrhoids.
Lavender 
Lavandula 
angustifolia (p74)
A calming and anti-inﬂammatory essential oil that promotes healing after childbirth. Add 
4–5 drops of lavender oil to the bath water. To relieve mastitis, add 3–4 drops of essential 
oil to warm water and apply using a clean facecloth as a compress.
Linseed 
Linum usitassimum
Acts as a gentle laxative and bowel lubricant, and is also very rich in omega fatty acids—
particularly essential during pregnancy. Add a tablespoon to breakfast cereal or muesli  
and increase your ﬂuids to help prevent constipation.
Calendula 
Calendula ofﬁcinalis 
(p36)
Highly nourishing and healing to the skin. Combine the tincture with St. John’s wort and dilute 
to use as a lotion to bathe any tearing or stitches after childbirth. Massage the macerated oil 
into the skin during pregnancy to help prevent stretch marks.
St. John’s wort 
Hypericum 
perforatum (p68)
Has effective antiseptic and pain-relieving properties. Combine the tincture with calendula 
and dilute to use as a lotion to heal tearing or stitches after childbirth; also use to bathe cracked 
nipples, although rinse with clear water before breastfeeding.
Raspberry leaf 
Rubus idaeus (p99)
A uterine tonic that helps prepare the body for childbirth. Drink the infusion daily during the last 
trimester of pregnancy (use with caution during early pregnancy). Continue drinking it for two to 
three weeks after birth to help contract the muscles and promote breast milk.
Dill 
Anethum graveolens
The seeds make an excellent infusion to drink during breastfeeding, as dill helps to 
promote the breast milk and also relieves any colic or gas in the baby. May be combined 
with fennel seeds.
Jasmine 
Jasminum ofﬁcinale 
(p72)
A delightfully fragrant essential oil that is traditionally used during labor for its relaxing 
properties and to help instill feelings of calmness and conﬁdence. Dilute in a base oil and ask 
your partner to massage it into your lower back.

Strawberry and macadamia smoothie
INGREDIENTS
1⁄2 vanilla bean 
1⁄3 cup raw macadamia nuts
pulp of 1 young medium-sized 
coconut 
13⁄4 cups fresh strawberries 
a little of the coconut juice (optional)
Makes 4 servings
This healthy twist on strawberries and cream uses an exotic 
version of cream made from coconut pulp and macadamia nuts. 
Macadamia nut oil is a rich source of monounsaturated fatty 
acids, which are reputed to lower cholesterol, while coconut 
pulp helps to clear the effects of summer heat in the body, 
quenches the thirst, and is a male reproductive tonic. 
MAKING JUICES AND SMOOTHIES
These juice recipes provide an instant means of detoxing and revitalizing 
your body, while the smoothies are a healthy yet tasty way to combine 
fruits, seeds, grains, and nuts to provide vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients 
(from fruit), essential fatty acids, and protein (from seeds). 
1 Slit the vanilla bean open with 
a sharp knife, then scrape out  
the seeds.
2 Place the nuts and the coconut 
pulp in a blender or food processor.
3 Add the strawberries and vanilla 
seeds. Pulse all the ingredients  
to give a smooth, silky texture. If  
the smoothie seems very thick, 
add enough coconut juice to give it  
a better texture. Pour into 4 glasses 
and serve.

Goji berries provide many amino acids and trace minerals—in particular germanium, a trace 
mineral thought to have anti-cancer properties. Not surprisingly, they have become known as  
a “superfruit.” The berries are also a rich source of carotenoids, including zeaxanthin (which 
strengthens eyesight) and vitamins C, B complex, and vitamin E.

INGREDIENTS
1⁄3 cup almonds 
1⁄3 cup goji berries

21⁄2 tbsp pine nuts
1 tsp linseed oil
2–3 leaves of fresh peppermint
11⁄2–13⁄4 cups mineral water (start 
with less water and adjust  
to a consistency and thickness  
you like)
METHOD
1 To sprout the almonds, soak them in cold water for half an hour, 
then rinse in a colander under running water. Place in a large 
bowl, cover with water, and leave overnight to soak. The next day, 
pop the skins off, place the almonds in a clean bowl, pour in the 
mineral water, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours before draining.
2 Wash the goji berries and, if dried, soak them for few hours  
in a bowl of mineral water (allow enough space for the berries 
to expand and sufﬁcient water—1⁄2 cup of water should be 
enough—for the fruit to remain submerged). Drain the berries.
3 Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend 
with the mineral water to give a smooth silky texture. If the 
consistency is a bit too thick, add a little more water and blend.

more roasted barley and some nuts to turn this smoothie into a nourishing breakfast in winter.

This is a great warming winter soup with a hint of Asian ﬂavor. Ginger is famous for its  
healing qualities, and fresh ginger is traditionally used to ward off winter ailments: it acts  
as a diaphoretic, warms up the body, and helps in the elimination of cold. It also improves  
the digestion and assimilation of nutrients. 
INGREDIENTS
2 tbsp olive oil
21⁄4lb (1kg) onion squash (or butternut 
squash), peeled, seeded, and cut 
into small chunks
1 medium-sized leek, sliced
4 cloves of garlic, crushed
2 tbsp fresh ginger, grated
23⁄4 pints (1.5 liters) vegetable stock
lime juice and zest to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper
METHOD
1 Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the squash and leek, and 
sauté for few minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and a splash  
of the stock and continue to sauté the ingredients until the leeks 
is soft. Add rest of the stock and bring to a boil. Simmer for 
approximately 10 minutes or until the squash is cooked through, 
but still retains some shape. 
2 Remove from the heat, add the lime juice and a sprinkle of the 
lime zest, and season to taste with salt and pepper. The soup 
can be served as it is, or blended until smooth.

fresh), trimmed and sliced
3 garlic cloves, chopped 
1 chile pepper, seeded and  
ﬁnely chopped
1–2 tsp hot smoked paprika
salt and freshly ground black  
pepper to taste
4 tbsp fresh cilantro, ﬁnely chopped
4 tbsp half-fat crème fraiche to serve 
(1 tbsp per serving)
METHOD
1 Place the potatoes in a pot, cover with water, and bring  
to a boil.
2 In the meantime, heat the oil in a frying pan, add the onion, 
and sauté until soft. Add the carrots to the pan, stir, and 
continue to sauté for a few minutes. Add the beans, stir, cover 
the pan, turn the heat to low, and allow to sweat. Then add the 
chopped garlic, chile pepper, and the smoked paprika.
3 Check that the vegetables are giving off enough juices to 
prevent the bottom of the pan from burning; if necessary add  
a spoonful or two of water (the idea is that the vegetables cook  
in their own juices).
4 When the beans are nearly ready (soft, but chewy), add the 
cooked potatoes to the frying pan and add just a small amount 
of the water in which the potatoes were cooked.
5 Cook all the vegetables together for a few more minutes so 
that they combine well. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
6 Serve the soup in bowls garnished with fresh cilantro and  
a spoonful of crème fraiche.

1 Place 2 tablespoons of water into a saucepan, add the 
shallots, and sauté for 1–2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  
When the shallots are soft, stir in the burdock root and carrots, 
keeping the pot covered and the heat turned down low so the 
vegetables steam in their own juices. 
2 Check and stir the ingredients every few minutes and, if 
necessary, add a little more water. When they are sufﬁciently 
soft, add the garlic and cook for another minute. Add 2 cups  
of boiling water and simmer for 5 minutes. 
3 Pour the soup into a blender or food processor and blend  
until smooth and silky. Season with salt and pepper to taste  
and serve in individual bowls. Garnish each with shredded 
lovage leaves and a little pumpkin seed oil.

Makes 4 servings 
This tonic soup makes a great nourishing lunch on a cold winter’s day, as it primarily  
supports kidney energy. It will help to warm up the whole system, and eating it once  
a week during the winter season is most useful for individuals suffering from aches  
and pains aggravated by the cold weather.
INGREDIENTS
6 shallots, trimmed, with skin  
left on
4 cloves garlic with skin left on
2 large carrots, washed
11⁄4 cups celeriac, peeled and cubed
1in (21⁄2cm) piece fresh ginger, washed
1⁄2lb sweet chestnuts, fresh 
or precooked
11⁄2 cups shiitake mushrooms, stems 
removed and sliced
2 long blades wakame seaweed, 
chopped into small pieces, or  
2 tbsp wakame ﬂakes
31⁄2oz (100g) roasted barley 
(see note below)
1 tbsp barley miso
ﬂat-leaf parsley, to garnish (optional)
METHOD
1 If using fresh chestnuts, roast them ﬁrst (see note below).
2 Put the whole shallots, garlic, carrots, celeriac, and ginger 
into a large saucepan, cover with 16ﬂ oz (500ml) of water,  
and bring to a simmer. Cook, covered, over low heat for at least 
1 hour, occasionally adding some more water if necessary. 
3 Take the saucepan off the heat and strain the liquid through 
a colander into a clean saucepan. Pick out the garlic and 
shallots from the cooked vegetables and squeeze them out of 
their skins directly into the liquid.
4 Add the chestnuts to the soup and bring to the boil. Add the 
mushrooms, wakame seaweed, and roasted barley, and simmer 
for 15–20 minutes. Then stir in the barley miso until dissolved, 
remove from the heat, and serve in bowls with the parsley 
garnish (if using).
NOTE: To roast barley, soak it overnight in lukewarm water, drain, and leave to 
dry on a baking sheet covered with a clean cloth. When the barley is still damp, 
heat a large frying pan over high heat. Turn the heat down to medium and add 
a quarter of the barley, stirring constantly. When the grain is golden brown and 
makes a gravely noise as you stir it, transfer it out of the pan and allow to cool 
completely on a plate. Repeat with the remaining 3 batches. Store in an 
airtight jar if you prepare the barley a few days before making the soup.
NOTE: To roast fresh chestnuts, chip into the apex, or tip, of each nut with 
a sharp knife and place them on a baking sheet. Bake in the oven at 350°F 
(180°C) for 20–25 minutes. Take them out of the oven. Wrap each chestnut  
in a cloth and squeeze hard to crush the shell, then peel it all off.

Fermented foods such as sauerkraut play an important role in enhancing intestinal health by 
promoting the growth of organisms that increase nutrient absorption. Cabbage also contains 
compounds that support colon and breast health, and has antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral 
properties. Once prepared, sauerkraut actually contains more vitamin C than fresh cabbage.
Sauerkraut and avocado salad
REPLENISHES GUT FLORA
Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) A ﬂowering 
plant of the pea family, alfalfa was 
originally cultivated in the Middle East 
and is now grown throughout the world.
FOR THE SAUERKRAUT
2 medium white cabbages
2 tbsp salt 
FOR THE SALAD
13⁄4oz (50g) alfalfa sprouts, washed
1 avocado, pitted, peeled, and sliced
1 tbsp pumpkin seed oil
freshly ground black pepper to taste
METHOD
1 To make the sauerkraut (fermented cabbage), shred the 
cabbage ﬁnely in a food processor, pack into a bowl, sprinkle 
with salt, mix thoroughly, and leave for half an hour. 
2 Pound the cabbage with the end of a rolling pin until the  
juices start ﬂowing. Fill a sterilized glass jar (p194) with the 
salted cabbage, adding a handful at the time and pounding it 
down in the jar with the end of a rolling pin each time so that  
no air is left between the added layers (“beating in” is essential 
to the success of this process). Firmly compress the layers  
of cabbage, leaving some space at the top of the jar for the 
cabbage to expand (the juices may also overﬂow). 
3 Place the jar on a plate, cover with a saucer as wide as  
the neck of the jar, and store in a well-ventilated cool, but  
not cold, place (see note below). Check the jar and remove any 
residue from the top regularly. After 1 week, the cabbage will 
have fermented sufﬁciently to be eaten, and should keep for at 
least 2 weeks if refrigerated.
4 To make the salad, combine 1 cup of the sauerkraut with the 
rest of the ingredients in a salad bowl and season to taste.
NOTE: You can also buy ready-made sauerkraut, but it is often sterilized and 
your homemade version will taste much better. The ideal temperature for 
fermentation is 68–72°F (20–22°C). Fermentation will stop and the cabbage 
will spoil above 76°F (24°C) or below 55°F (13°C). If your sauerkraut develops 
a pinkish hue on its surface, goes dark, or is very soft and mushy, it has not 
fermented properly and should not be eaten.

METHOD
1 First, toast the sesame seeds in a small pan over low heat  
for 3–4 minutes, stirring frequently, until they turn lightly golden 
and begin to release a nutty aroma.
2 To make the dressing, put all the dressing ingredients into a 
blender or food processor with 1 tablespoon of toasted sesame 
seeds and blend until smooth.
3 Have a small bowl of water ready. Place a sheet of nori on  
a sushi mat or a square of parchment paper a little longer and 
wider than the sheet of nori. 
4 Put a small amount of each ingredient heaped on top of one 
another in a line 3⁄4–11⁄4in (2–3cm) from the edge of the bottom 
of the nori sheet. 
5 Drizzle a little of the dressing over the vegetables and scatter 
some of the remaining toasted sesame seeds over the top. 
6 Lift the bottom edge of the sushi mat (or paper) and roll up 
the nori with the ingredients inside. To seal the nori roll, wet 
your ﬁngers in the small bowl of water, dampen the top edge  
of the nori sheet, and ﬁnish rolling the nori. Repeat with the 
remaining nori sheets, vegetables, and dressing.
7 When ready to serve, slice the nori rolls into three sections,

You can happily share this fresh-tasting, minty raita with friends who do not eat milk or milk-
related products. Cucumbers are cooling, so this dish is ideal for summer dining; if you serve  
it in winter, add some ﬁnely chopped fresh chile. Use young cucumbers, which have small, 
compact seeds, or scoop out the larger seeds from a mature cucumber with a spoon.
Mint and cucumber side salad

COOLS THE  
DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Cucumber (Cucumis sativas) Although 
often considered vegetables, cucumbers 
are actually fruits, as they have enclosed 
seeds and develop from a ﬂower.
INGREDIENTS
1 medium cucumber, peeled
a few fresh mint leaves, ﬁnely 
chopped, to garnish
FOR THE CASHEW NUT CREAM
1/2 cup raw cashew nuts, pre-soaked 
2 garlic cloves, crushed
2 tsp white miso
2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 tbsp fresh mint leaves,  
ﬁnely chopped
1 tbsp fresh cilantro, ﬁnely chopped
METHOD 
1 Cut the cucumber in half lengthwise and scoop out any large 
seeds with a spoon. Dice the cucumber ﬁnely and place in  
a serving bowl. 
2 Put all the ingredients for the cashew nut cream in a blender 
or food processor, and blend thoroughly. Add ½ cup of water  
or more to adjust the consistency to that of heavy cream.
3 Pour the cashew nut cream over the cucumber and stir 
together well. Sprinkle with ﬁnely chopped mint leaves.

Kale is the perfect winter green for this warming salad, as it contains sulphur and its juice  
is an age-old medicine for stomach and duodenal ulcers. This recipe also contains cayenne  
pepper to add warmth on cold winter days (although do not include it if you have either of  
the above-mentioned conditions). 
Cayenne-toasted almonds and kale salad
STIMULATES DIGESTION
INGREDIENTS
2 tbsp chopped almonds
pinch of cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp sweet paprika
pinch of salt
a little lemon juice
9oz (250g) kale, washed, and cut  
into thin strips
1 tbsp olive oil
METHOD
1 Toast the almonds ﬁrst: heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan  
over medium heat, add the almonds, and toast for a couple of 
minutes. Then add the cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt, and 
toss the almonds in the spices. Add the lemon juice, remove the 
pan from the heat before the juice begins to burn, and set aside.
2 Heat a saucepan over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons  
of water, let the water heat up, add the kale, and close the  
lid tightly. Lower the heat and allow the kale to sweat for  
2–3 minutes only so that it wilts, rather than cooks. 
3 Place the kale in a serving dish, toss with the olive oil and 
another dash of lemon, and garnish with the spicy almonds.
Almonds (Prunus dulcis) These nuts 
are an excellent source of vitamin E and 
are rich in monounsaturated fats, which 
may help to lower cholesterol.

Four fruits power bar
INGREDIENTS
51⁄2oz (150g) wheat grains
1 cup dry apricots 
1⁄3 cup raisins 
1⁄3 cup blackcurrants
1⁄3 cup sour cherries
1⁄3 cup walnuts, soaked for 4 hours, 
dried, and lightly pan-toasted
1⁄3 cup sesame seeds, pan-toasted
Makes 16 bars
Sour cherries bring a sharp, lively ﬂavor to these power bars. 
Add a combination of other dried berries, fruits, or nuts if you 
like, to complement the ﬂavour of the sour cherries. These bars 
are best eaten the day you make them, not only to keep them 
from spoiling, but to get the maximum goodness from the 
freshly sprouted grains.
MAKING FRUIT BARS
These recipes will help you to incorporate more wild fruits, nuts, and 
grains into your diet. The variations on these basic ingredients are 
endless, and depend mainly on the way the grains are prepared,  
as well as your choice of dried fruits, nuts, and seeds.
1 To sprout the wheat grains, soak 
for 12 hours or overnight. Rinse the 
grains thoroughly and put in a large 
glass jar (grains expand to two to 
three times their initial volume). 
Cover the opening and neck of the 
jar with cheesecloth and attach it 
with string or a strong rubber band. 
Place at a 45° angle in a well-lit 
spot but not in direct sunlight.  
Rinse the grains each morning and 
evening by pouring water through 
the cheesecloth and emptying it out. 
2 The sprouts are ready when 
seedlings approximately 1⁄4in 
(0.5–1cm) in length appear. Rinse 
the seedlings thoroughly in clean 
water, strain, and spread on a clean 
cloth to dry. The sprouted grains 
are ready to use when they are dry 
to the touch. Place the apricots and 
raisins in a blender and blend to  
a paste. Add half of the sprouted 
grains and blackcurrants and  
blend until crushed (but not 
blended to a purée).
3 Transfer to a mixing bowl and 
add the rest of the grains, berries, 
and the cherries. Mix well with a 
wooden spoon. Chop the walnuts into 
small chunks and add them to the 
mix. Sprinkle the sesame seeds on  
a ﬂat surface. Roll out the mixture, 
or press it with clean hands, over the 
seeds into a rectangle 1⁄2in (1cm) 
thick. Use a sharp knife to cut the 
mixture into small rectangular bars. 
Place the bars on a rack and leave  
to dry out for a few hours.

Barley has long had a reputation as a highly nutritious cereal; it was eaten by Ancient Greek 
athletes and Roman gladiators, who were known as hordearii (“barley eaters”). Cranberries are 
packed with antioxidants, and apricots are an excellent source of iron, so these power bars make 
a highly nutritious and sustaining snack to keep your energy levels up.
Cranberry and apricot power bars
ENERGIZES
INGREDIENTS
51/2oz (150g) lightly toasted 
barley, ground to a powder
3/4 cup dried cranberries (presoaked 
and dried on a cloth or paper towels) 
11/2 cups dried apricots (washed 
and dried on a cloth or paper towels) 
1/2 cup pistachios, coarsely chopped 
1/3 cup pistachios, ﬁnely ground
METHOD
1 Prepare the barley ﬁrst (see below). Put the fruit and coarsely 
chopped pistachios in a blender or food processor and blend 
into a thick purée. Then add just enough of the toasted barley 
powder to make a pliable dough. 
2 Sprinkle half the ﬁnely ground pistachios onto a ﬂat surface, 
place the fruit dough on top, and roll it out into a rectangular 
shape about 1⁄4–1⁄2in (6–8mm) thick. Sprinkle the top of the 
dough with the remaining ﬁnely ground pistachios and press 
them by hand into the mixture. 
3 Cut into 11⁄4 x 4in (3 x10cm) rectangles and place on a baking 
sheet. Bake in a preheated 125°F (50°C) oven for 2–3 hours until 
the bars have dried out.
4 Carefully lift the bars off the sheet, allow to cool on a wire 
rack, then wrap them individually in plastic wrap or parchment 
paper. If wrapped and stored in a can in a cool place, the bars 
can last for more than a week.
NOTE: To roast barley, soak it overnight in lukewarm water, drain, and leave 
to dry on a baking sheet covered with a clean cloth. When the barley is still 
damp, heat a large frying pan over high heat. Turn the heat down to medium 
and add a quarter of the barley, stirring constantly. When the grain is golden 
brown and makes a gravely noise as you stir it, transfer it out of the pan and 
allow to cool completely on a plate. Repeat with the remaining 3 batches. 
Allow the grain to cool completely and store in an airtight container. Grind  
the toasted grains in a pestle and mortar to make a barley powder.

These healthy crackers can be enjoyed by everyone. Linseed is a valuable food in a balanced diet 
owing to its high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which play an essential role in strengthening 
immunity and maintaining good blood vessel health. The addition of seaweeds, chile, and fresh 
parsley make these crackers taste very addictive.

METHOD
1 Add the linseeds to the freshly made carrot and celery juice, 
then stir in the chile, parsley, seaweed ﬂakes, salt to taste, and 
chili powder (if using). Leave for up to 2 hours to allow the 
linseeds to soak up the juices.
2 Spread the soaked linseeds in a thin layer on a piece of 
parchment paper on a baking sheet. Bake in a preheated  
125°F (50°C) oven for 3–4 hours.
3 Use a knife to cut the crackers into squares. Thicker pieces 
can be served instead of bread with soup.

If barley grain is soaked in warm water, it cooks very slowly, allowing for little loss of nutrients. 
Toasted grain is very crunchy and can be partially cracked or milled by laying it in a thin layer  
on a wooden cutting board and rolling over it with a rolling pin, before using to roll out the bars. 
Eat the bars within 1–2 days while still fresh. 
Blackcurrant walnut bars
INGREDIENTS
11⁄4 cups barley grains
1⁄2 cup walnut pieces 
4 dates, pitted 
3⁄4 cup dried blackcurrants 
(or blueberries)
METHOD
1 Wash the barley grains, then soak them in warm water 
overnight. In the morning, drain the grains and allow them to 
dry out for a few minutes in a strainer. Set aside 51⁄2oz (150g) 
of the grain and spread the rest in a thin layer over a clean, dry 
cloth to dry until the next day.
2 The 51⁄2oz (150g) of grain you set aside should still be damp, 
but no longer wet, and will be ready to toast. Heat a large frying 
pan over high heat, then turn the heat down and add the barley 
in small batches to toast. Make sure that the pan is not too 
crowded, and that the size of the pan allows for an equal 
toasting of all the barley grains. Stir constantly until the grain  
is a golden tan color and makes gravely noises as you stir it. 
3 Allow the grain to cool completely, then move it in batches into 
a pestle and mortar and grind until lightly milled.
4 Toast the walnuts in the same way as the barley, toasting  
it lightly until golden with a nutty scent. 
5 Once the barley grain and walnuts are ready to use, place  
the untoasted batch of barley grains in a blender or food 
processor with the dates and process to a paste. Transfer to a 
mixing bowl and stir in the blackcurrants and walnuts. Spread 
the toasted barley grains over a work surface and place the 
paste mixture on top, rolling it out into a rectangle or pressing  
it into shape with clean hands. Cut into bars and place them on 
a rack to dry.

Scrubs boost circulation and smooth the skin, leaving it feeling radiant with 
a healthy glow. If you have sensitive skin or eczema, this may be exacerbated 
by scrubbing; the best treatment is a moisturizer or anti-inﬂammatory 
cream such as chamomile and evening primrose moisturiser (p253).

Makes 16 bars
Fresh, scented rosemary adds to the cleansing properties  
of this soap, which also contains gently exfoliating oatmeal to 
smooth roughened hands. Spirulina and green clay lend color. 
Sprinkle a few dried rosemary ﬂowers on top of the soap when 
it is semi-set as a decoration, if you wish.
MAKING SOAPS
Soap-making is fun, and soaps make lovely gifts. With careful preparation 
you can make your own soaps, but read the safety information on page 343 
ﬁrst and follow the instructions closely. It is worth noting that the cheapest 
olive oil makes better soap. Store the soaps in an airtight container.
1 Mix the olive and coconut oils in 
a saucepan with a whisk over low 
heat until the temperature reaches 
140°F (60°C). To make the lye mix, 
pour the water into a stainless steel 
or glass bowl placed in a sink in case 
the contents froth over when you add 
the caustic soda. Wearing protective 
goggles, gloves, and an apron, add 
the soda to the water and mix with a 
wooden spoon until the crystals have 
dissolved. Leave to cool.
2 Add the cooled lye mix to the hot 
oils in the saucepan and stir with  
a wooden spoon until well mixed. 
Then beat with a metal whisk for 
about 20 seconds. The consistency 
should now be similar to that of 
thick custard so that a line is visible 
if drawn on its surface. Stir in the 
green clay, crushed spirulina 
tablets, bran or oatmeal, and 
rosemary essential oil. 
3 Pour the mix into a 6in (15cm) 
square stainless steel dish 2in 
(5cm) deep and greased with olive 
oil. Cover with a cloth and leave for 
24 hours. While still soft, remove 
the soap wearing plastic gloves, 
and cut into bars using a cheese 
slicer or knife. Arrange on trays and 
leave to dry out fully and harden; 
this will take several weeks. Check 
the pH of the ﬁnished soap before 
using (it should be around 10–10.5).

4 While still soft enough to cut, remove the soap wearing plastic 
gloves and cut into bars using a cheese slicer or knife. Arrange 
the bars on trays and leave to dry out fully and harden; this will 
take several weeks. During this time the pH value of the soap 
will drop, becoming more neutral and therefore milder. You may 
ﬁnd that a whitish residue appears on the surface; this can be 
scraped off if you prefer. The soap will continue to dry out for 
several months depending on the weather, but the reduction  
of the pH value will slow and remain stable after a few weeks.  
Check the pH of the ﬁnished soap before using (it should be 
around 10–10.5).

CLEANSERS
MAKING CLEANSERS
A cleansing routine is essential to support and maintain healthy skin, 
especially if you live or work in an urban environment with higher levels of 
pollution. If you have very sensitive skin, test any skin product on a small  
area of skin ﬁrst to check that it does not provoke a reaction.
Soothing lavender cleanser
CLEANSES SKIN
Makes 2ﬂ oz (60ml) 
This is a simple cleanser for sensitive or dry skin. Oats have long been used for their skin-
soothing properties, as they are rich in natural polysaccharides that become glutinous in water  
to create a nurturing wash for delicate skin. Almond oil also soothes and enriches skin, helping 
to prevent moisture loss, while lavender soothes the skin and adds a gentle fragrance. 
INGREDIENTS
scant 1oz (25g) organic oats
a little mineral water
1 egg yolk
31⁄2 tbsp almond oil
5 drops lavender essential oil
METHOD
1 Put the oats in a bowl, pour over enough mineral water  
to cover, and leave to soak for at least 1 hour. 
2 Whisk the egg yolk in a blender or food processor, adding  
a drop of almond oil at a time. The mixture should be a thick 
emulsion when all the oil has been added. Add the lavender 
essential oil, adding a drop at a time so it blends in well. 
3 Strain the oats, squeezing all the liquid (oatmilk) into a bowl. 
Reserve the oatmilk (but discard the oats). Add the oatmilk 
slowly to the egg mixture, stirring or blending it in gently so  
that it thins to the consistency of a lotion. 
4 Store in a sterilized glass bottle (p194) with a tightly ﬁtting lid. 
Refrigerate and use within 3 days.

MAKING BALMS
Balms are a simple way to nourish skin and protect it from moisture loss.

sterilized (p194). If you have very sensitive skin, test any skincare product  
on a small area of skin ﬁrst to check that it does not provoke a reaction.

Planning your herb garden
Choosing your favorite herb plants and growing them is a great way to start your own 
herb garden. Select herbs that will ﬂourish in your climate, and take some time to 
choose which plot—or in which containers—to grow your herbs. Be mindful of how  
much sun your herbs need and position them appropriately in your garden.
Pots
• Most culinary herbs take well to pot culture, and 
the advantage of planting herbs in different pots is 
that you can move the plants around the garden for 
more sun or shade depending on the month, or 
move any frost-tender herb plants indoors during 
the winter months. 
• Alternatively, window boxes allow you to grow a 
good selection of herbs in one space, and can be 
conveniently positioned by a kitchen window to 
make picking them at the last moment for cooking 
or garnishing dishes even easier. 
• Plant herbs in generous containers with drainage 
holes in the bottom. Use ﬁne soil mixed in equal 
quantities with vermiculite for Mediterranean herbs, 
and 100 percent potting soil for delicate herbs. 
• Potted herbs require frequent watering, and daily 
watering in the summer.
Beds and borders
• If you have a vegetable garden or ornamental beds 
or borders, plant culinary and medicinal herbs in 
between existing plants. Position sun-loving herbs 
where they will get lots of light, and tuck shade-
lovers around taller ornamentals.
• A small, informal, dedicated herb garden packed 
with herbs can occupy as little as 5 x 111⁄2ft 
(1.5 x 3.5m). If possible, position where you can see it.
• A formal arrangement is possible even in the 
tiniest of gardens: plant low-growing herbs such  
as thyme or chamomile between paths made of 
crushed rocks, bricks, or ﬂagstones.
• Sketch out your dream garden on graph paper 
before you dig it. Then mark out planting areas in 
geometric or soft, curving patterns.
• If you add trellises, arbors, arches, pillars, water 
features, and statues, you can give it a formal look.  
If you have a sloping garden, terraces make a 
beautiful addition to the design.
Sharing space Many herbs make pretty and practical additions 
to vegetable beds.
Use your space Position pots against a south-facing wall in 
a sheltered spot to give them the best of the sun.

PLANNING YOUR HERB GARDEN 331
Testing the soil
Try this simple test before you plant herbs. The best soil is loam (a mix of clay and sand). Clay needs sand 
and compost to improve aeration; sandy soil retains water and nutrients only when you add compost to it.
Making your own compost
Add grass clippings, leaves, uncooked vegetable waste, and dead (but not diseased) plants to a compost 
bin that is 5ft (1.5m) square and 3ft (90cm) high. Do not add weeds or grasses that have set seed.
1 Remove any grass, weeds, or plants from the 
surface and lift out a clod of earth with a spade. 
Repeat in two other places in your garden patch.
1 Collect your compostable material in the bin. Keep 
the heap moist and turn it every two weeks, using a 
fork or shovel, until the material starts to break down. 
2 Mix the samples well, squeeze some mixed soil in 
your palm, and tap it with a ﬁnger. If it falls apart, it is 
loam; if gritty, it is sandy; if it forms a lump, it is clay.
2 You can use your compost when it has turned dark 
brown in color, is crumbling in texture, and looks and 
smells like soil.

Growing herbs
There are many advantages to growing herbs from seed. Home-sown herbs are cheaper 
than those bought from a nursery, and home-grown seedlings have healthy, garden-
ready root balls when the time comes to plant them. Some herbs are best propagated  
in other ways, though (p334).
Transplanting
As seedlings develop, they need more space to grow. Transplant them into individual or bigger pots when 
they have formed four or more true leaves above the seed leaves.
1 Fill a pot with ﬁne soil and gently ﬁrm down. Water 
the soil and let it drain. Sow seed in dents or on the 
soil surface (according to the package instructions).
1 Remove the seedlings from their pot, gently pulling 
them out by their true leaves, not by the stem, and 
squeezing the base of the pot or tray.
2 Make a hole in a pot of soil and lower in the seedling. 
Fill with more soil, ﬁrm down gently, water, and 
position in a warm, bright spot out of direct sunlight.
2 Lightly cover the seed with vermiculite or more 
potting soil. Water again. Set the tray in a warm place 
and never let the soil dry out.
Growing from seed

GROWING HERBS 333
Growing young plants
Sometimes it may not be practical to raise plants from seed yourself, especially if you only want to grow a 
handful of different plants and don’t have space to sow lots of seedlings, or if a plant is hard to grow from 
seed. Garden centers have a good selection of young plants, but nurseries have a broader range.
Planting into the garden
Young plants bought from a nursery should be big 
enough to plant outdoors in the garden immediately. 
Plant them as soon as you can to allow their roots  
to establish.
1 Prepare the soil by digging into the top 6–12in 
(15–30cm) of soil until it becomes loose. Dig a 
generous hole and place the plant in the hole to the 
same depth it was in its pot. 
2 Backﬁll around the plant and ﬁrm it in with the 
palms of your hands. Water the plant well.
Potting on
If you want to grow your herb plant in a pot, replant 
it when you get home from the nursery in a pot one 
size bigger than the one you bought it in. You will 
need to repeat the process when your plants 
outgrow their new pots.
1 Make sure your new pot has a drainage hole. Place 
a handful of gravel at the bottom, half-ﬁll with potting 
compost, and remove the plant from its pot.
2 Remove the plant from its old pot. Set the plant into 
its new pot and ﬁll with potting soil, ﬁrming in gently  
as you go. Water the plant well.

Propagation
Once your favorite herb plants are well established, you can increase their number, or  
grow a few insurance plants in case some do not survive a harsh winter, by using various 
propagation methods. See the individual entries in the A–Z section for the best technique 
to use for growing each plant. 
Stem cuttings
Take softwood cuttings from young stems in spring, semi-ripe cuttings from ripening, stiffening 
stems in late summer, and hardwood ones from woody stems at the end of the growing season.
Root cuttings
Make new plants from sections of semi-mature or mature roots of plants such as mint when they are 
dormant (not growing) in mid- to late winter.
1 Select a healthy, non-ﬂowering stem with mature 
leaves, cut the stem at an angle just above the leaf 
attachment, and strip the lower leaves.
2 Cut the stem straight across 2in (5cm) below the last 
leaf. Plant vertically in a pot of soil. Water well. Cover 
with a clear plastic bag to retain moisture.
1 Lift the plant and tease the roots apart. Cut a 2in 
(5cm) piece of root; avoid ﬁbrous or immature roots.
2 Trim the root straight across at the top and diagonally 
at the base. Plant upright in soil. Cover with vermiculite.

WATERING AND FEEDING 335
Watering and feeding
Herbs grown in pots and in the ground have different requirements. Check seed package 
instructions or ask at your local garden center or nursery about your chosen plant’s 
speciﬁc requirements, although these general guidelines will keep all plants healthy.
Feeding
Beds: Plants in open ground do not need much 
feeding because their roots travel to ﬁnd the 
nutrition they require. However, you can give  
them a helping hand by spreading a 2in (5cm)  
layer of compost over the soil surface as a mulch 
over winter, then digging it into the soil in spring  
to restore nutrients. Herbs that are harvested 
frequently during the growing season beneﬁt from 
the occasional fertilizer feed in midsummer too.
Pots: Potted plants also need more attention when 
it comes to food. Ideally, feed them with fertilizer in 
granules or liquid form every six weeks throughout 
the growing season, especially if they are harvested 
regularly. Start feeding in spring when new growth 
appears, and scrape away the top 2in (5cm) of soil  
in the pot and replace it with good, fresh soil. Stop 
feeding the plants in late summer, or you will 
encourage new growth when they should be slowing 
down before the dormant winter season.
Watering
Beds: You cannot always cater for the preferences 
of individual plants, but they will usually tolerate 
shared conditions as long as they have moist, 
well-drained soil. Work lots of compost into the soil 
to help it retain moisture and water it deeply when 
the top 2in (5cm) seems dry. The best time to water, 
if you are using an overhead sprinkler or a watering 
can, is in the morning, so that the sun has time to 
dry the leaves.
Pots: Herbs that are planted in pots need to be 
watered more often than those positioned in the 
ground, as their roots cannot travel as far to locate 
moisture. In very warm weather and on hot summer 
days you should water these potted plants every day, 
or purchase drip irrigation systems and install them 
in each pot with set timers to automatically water 
them. You can help the soil retain more water using 
special granules that absorb water and release it as 
and when needed.
Water early Try to water your herbs in the morning to avoid 
mildew and rot overnight.
Feed well Feed potted herbs with fertilizer every six weeks 
during the growing season.

Weeds, pests, and diseases
Weeds compete with plants for water, sunlight, nutrients, and space—the key to 
defeating them is to remove them as you see them. One of the virtues of many herbs is 
that the aromatic volatile oils they exude are produced primarily to ward off insects; so 
many of the plants in your herb garden will naturally protect themselves against pests.
Pests
Caterpillars: Pick off by hand, wearing a glove, and 
dispose of them. Encourage parasitic wasps to eat 
them by planting ﬂowering herbs, or spray infested 
plants with 2 cups of water blended with a peeled 
clove of garlic (strain the liquid before use).
Slugs and snails: Set traps of shallow bowls of beer 
to drown them, or pick off by hand at night when 
they are most active. Alternatively, use non-toxic 
pellets or apply copper tape to containers (right) to 
give them a mild electric shock as they pass over it.
Aphids: Along with scale, whiteﬂy, mealy bugs, thrips, 
spittle bugs, and red spider mites, aphids weaken  
a plant’s growth. Spritz them off plants with water 
from a hose or use an organic, insecticidal soap.
Vine weevils: A major pest, these grubs come out 
at night and chew notches out of leaf margins and 
devour roots. They are difﬁcult to control biologically, 
but you can add nematodes to the soil to kill them.
Beating weeds
Once weeds start to appear on the surface of the 
soil in spring, you need to remove them by hand or 
with the help of a hand-fork for those that have long 
roots. To help prevent the weeds from returning, 
remove them before they set seed and make sure 
you get as much of the root out of the soil as 
possible, particularly with perennial weeds. Check 
the soil regularly for any new shoots that may be 
appearing and remove them immediately.
If you want to clear a large area of weeds from the 
soil before planting in it, try solarizing: clear a patch 
of soil, water it thoroughly, then cover the area with 
a piece of clear plastic sheeting and bury it at the 
edges to prevent any air from getting in and out. 
Over the course of the next six to eight weeks, the 
sun will create killing heat and steam under the 
plastic sheet. After that time, remove the plastic and 
plant your herb plants immediately.
Short, sharp shock Apply copper tape just below the rim of pots 
or other containers to deter slugs and snails.
Weeding by hand This is the most effective way of removing all 
parts of the weeds once established.

WEEDS, PESTS, AND DISEASES 337
Fungi 
Although fungi is fairly rare among herbs, mint is 
prone to rust and downy and powdery mildews can 
develop in warm, humid, and wet conditions. Spray 
with an alkaline solution to keep fungi from taking 
hold, and use organic controls for fungal diseases.
Viruses
Mosaic viruses cause white, yellow, or light green 
dots on leaves. Other viruses cause curled leaves, 
and ring spot viruses cause pale, yellowed ringed 
spots on leaves. They do not cause serious damage, 
but you can pull up affected plants and destroy them.
Organic spray You can easily blend your own spray and use it to 
treat any bacterial diseases that may affect your plants.
Curled leaves This can be a sign of a virus that has been 
transmitted by sucking insects or infected tools.
Powdery mildew A white fungus can develop on the leaves of 
herbs such as this sage.
Diseases: Grow resistant varieties and apply good 
cultural practices and hygiene in the garden. Try  
not to work in the garden when it is wet as you may 
inadvertently spread diseases. Examine plants 
regularly, removing infected leaves as they fall. 
Dispose of any infected plant material carefully—
preferably by burning it.
Bacteria: If bacteria enters a plant through a wound, 
spray the affected area with a simple homemade 
organic solution. To make the solution, purée a 
dozen peeled garlic cloves and then blend the garlic 
purée with 11⁄4 quarts (1.2 liters) of water. Strain the 
liquid, decant it into a bottle with a spray mist nozzle 
attachment, and apply as necessary. If the plant 
does not respond within several days, clip off the 
infected parts and destroy them. Ensure that you 
sterilize your clippers or pruning shears before you 
use them again on other plants.
Avoiding diseases and bacteria
Most herbs are remarkably free of plant diseases and many can be prevented by good care and 
maintenance, but occasionally diseases do develop. Deal with them quickly to avoid lasting damage.

Wildcrafting
Harvesting from the wild offers a free source of herbal remedies and provides the 
satisfaction of collecting your own herbs. The active constituents of wild plants are often 
more concentrated, as they are likely to be growing in their preferred environment. A variety 
of plants can even be found growing on waste ground or in “wild zones” in urban areas.
Sustainability
Some common plants, such as nettle or plantain, 
may be gathered readily from the wild. However, 
many rarer species are under great pressure due to 
over-harvesting and a decline in natural habitats. In 
many countries it is illegal to dig up the roots of any 
wild plant, and certain species may be protected.
In some countries there is a strong tradition of 
wildcrafting. The trade in wild plants is monitored  
by the CITES convention developed by the IUCN 
(International Union for the Conservation of Nature); 
any endangered species are added to their “red list” 
and should never be gathered.
Never pick rare plants from the wild, even if they are 
plentiful locally. Do not deplete a stock of plants in an 
area; gather only enough for immediate use. Do not 
harvest bark in the wild—you may damage the tree.
Safety 
Proper identiﬁcation of wild plants is absolutely 
essential. Some plants that look similar to useful 
herbs may be poisonous; this is especially true of 
plants from the Umbelliferae family, which includes 
angelica and gotu kola and also some toxic plants 
such as hemlock. Always use a ﬁeld guide with clear 
identiﬁcation charts, and if you are not absolutely 
certain, don’t risk it.
Avoid plants growing along a main road, whether  
in the countryside or in the city, because of the  
high amounts of lead and other pollutants they  
may contain. Similarly, avoid plants growing at the 
bottom of trees in urban areas if they are evidently 
favored spots for dogs. 
It is also important to check that waste ground has 
not been used as a dump for toxic waste; ask locally 
if you are in doubt. Do not collect herb plants close 
to factories or any other obvious potential source  
of pollution. Always check that there are no signs of 
recent weed killer use or crop spraying.
Harvesting whole plants During the growing season, do not take 
more than half a plant to allow it to regrow.
Foraging for berries Be sure to identify herbs and fruit carefully 
before harvesting them in the wild.

WILDCRAFTING 339
When to harvest 
Herbs produce their volatile oils at night, so the best 
time to harvest most plants is in the early morning 
once the dew has evaporated. Collecting on a dry 
day means they will keep better and are less likely 
to grow mold. Pick a plant at the peak of its season 
and maturity to ensure it will have the highest 
concentration of active constituents.
Unless otherwise speciﬁed in the individual plant’s 
page in the A–Z (pp10–137), collect the leaves as 
they unfurl during the spring or early summer 
months; the ﬂowers as they start to bloom; and 
fruits and berries just as they become ripe.
Harvest the seeds from plants such as fennel while 
they are still on the plant, or cut off stems with 
whole seedheads to dry. Smaller, dry seeds can be 
gathered by shaking a seedhead into a paper bag.
Most berries are ripe if they come away from the 
plant easily when gently tugged, or you can snip off 
complete trusses and separate the berries from the 
stems at home in your kitchen.
Plants in the wild Nettles are one of the plants that can be found 
growing in parks and on waste ground.
Where to forage
In urban areas, a number of herbs known as 
“pioneer plants” can be found growing readily on 
waste ground or in wild zones, which are found in 
most large parks. The edges of allotments or 
disused railway lines can also be good places to ﬁnd 
relatively uncontaminated plants. Avoid main roads, 
but if you gather young shoots in the spring and 
avoid the mature plant and roots, you can minimize 
the amount of undesired pollutants.
Most of us live in cities, and by gathering plants very 
close to your home, you reduce the carbon footprint 
associated with their transportation. There is also 
an argument that plants tough enough to survive 
city conditions may be particularly appropriate and 
useful for city dwellers; certainly they are likely to 
have very concentrated levels of active constituents.
In rural areas, one of the best places to forage for 
herbs is the land and hedges around organic farms, 
but don’t go on to a farmer’s property without asking 
their permission ﬁrst. 
If you are in doubt about whether an area is suitable 
for wildcrafting from a sustainability point of view, 
ask your local Wildlife Trust or equivalent for advice 
on the plants you wish to collect.
Harvesting seeds Leave seedheads on the plants and gently 
shake the plant over your hand to harvest the seeds.

Buying and storing herbs
Sometimes it may not be practical to raise fresh herb plants from seed yourself, so buy 
the plants from a reputable garden center or nursery. Similarly, some herbs grow better 
in a different climate, or you may require them out of season, so buying fresh or dried 
versions of an herb is a better option than attempting to grow them yourself.
Pick a perfect plant
Do not buy plants with any obvious problems  
or diseases, such as leaves with yellow veins or 
mildew; all herbs should have bright, sturdy stems 
and foliage. Knock the plant out of its pot and check 
the roots, too—they should be healthy and plentiful 
and not ﬁghting for space. Check each plant for any 
live insects, as you do not want to bring a potential 
problem home with you.
Roots
Vigorous leaves and stems do not always mean that a plant is disease-free; sometimes problems lie 
beneath the surface of the soil. Roots are the lifeline of a plant, so it is important that they are healthy.
Check the roots for pest 
damage and to see if they 
are pot-bound. Soil should 
be moist and free of weeds
Leaves should have a 
good, healthy color
Plants should have 
sturdy stems
1 A healthy specimen should lift easily out of its pot 
and its roots should be plentiful, but not overcrowded, 
with plenty of soil visible.
2 If you have a less-than-healthy plant, tease out and 
thin the overcrowded roots before planting it in good 
soil. Remove any root weevils and grubs.
Potted plants Before buying, check over each plant 
you choose from the leaves and stems to the roots.

BUYING AND STORING HERBS 341
Fresh herbs 
It’s worth buying fresh or cut herbs if an herb proves tricky to grow, you don’t live in an ideal growing 
climate, the growing season for an herb is over, or you need a larger amount of an herb than you already  
have growing in your garden. Most supermarkets now sell a range of fresh herbs in their fresh fruit and 
vegetable section, or you may be able to get some herbs, such as parsley or watercress, from a farmer’s 
market. Always buy fresh, “juicy-looking” herbs and, if possible, organically grown.
Dried herbs
Most herbs keep their medicinal properties well if dried carefully. It also means they can be harvested at 
their peak time and stored to use when out of season. Traditionally, herbs are harvested in one season— 
for example, spring—then grown on for a full year until they are ready to harvest again. Most herbs remain 
effective for six to 12 months, after which time any remaining stock should be discarded and replaced.
Delicate herbs such as tarragon, parsley, or mint 
keep well for a few days in a cup or a vase of fresh 
water if kept in a cool room. Many herbs, such as 
basil or marjoram, can be kept chilled while still on 
their stems, but ﬁrst rinse the herbs, pat them dry 
with a paper towel, loosely wrap the stems in a 
piece of damp paper towel, and store in the fridge.
Most herbs keep their properties well during 
freezing; chop the herbs ﬁnely, coat them in a little 
olive oil or water, then spoon the mixture into small 
freezer bags or an ice-cube tray (right) and keep 
frozen until needed for up to six months.
Always dry herbs from organically grown plants 
only; it is not advisable to ingest concentrated 
pesticides or synthetic fertilizer residues in addition 
to the active properties of the herb.
It is essential that you buy dried herbs only from 
ethical companies that actively pursue a policy of 
minimal environmental impact by encouraging 
organic cultivation and ensuring sustainable 
harvesting by indigenous communities. Such 
companies will ensure that their herbs are fresh. 
Suppliers should also ensure that they sell the 
correct species and there is no infestation. 
Store any bought dried herbs in an airtight—
preferably glass—container in a dry, dark cupboard 
to preserve their therapeutic properties.
Preserving fresh herbs Cover ﬁnely chopped fresh herbs with 
a little water or oil in an ice-cube tray and freeze.
Store dried herbs in airtight jars All dried herbs should be 
stored out of direct light and used within six to 12 months.

HERB BASICS
342
An infusion is the best way to harness the properties of the softer, green, or ﬂowering parts of  
a plant. A standard therapeutic infusion is 1 heaping tsp dried herb or 2 tsp of a mixture of dried 
herbs (for fresh herbs use double the amount) to 6ﬂ oz (175ml) boiling water, but see individual 
herb entries in the A-Z (pp10–137) for speciﬁc dosage instructions.
This is the quickest, most practical method of making a macerated or infused oil, and is known 
as the “heat” method. Adjust the quantities below to make a larger or smaller amount of oil; 
there should be enough oil to completely cover the chopped herbs in the bowl.
To use the woodier parts of a plant, such as its roots (with the exception of Valerian root), bark, and 
nuts, make a decoction as directed below. A standard decoction is 1 tsp dried herb or 2 tsp fresh 
herb to 6ﬂ oz (175ml) boiling water, but see individual herb entries in the A-Z (pp10–137) for speciﬁc 
dosage instructions. Use a steel cast iron pan if possible, as aluminum could taint the decoction.

Decoctions
INGREDIENTS
1⁄2oz (15g) dried herb or mixture of 
herbs, or 1oz (30g) fresh herbs
1¼ pints (750ml) cold water
METHOD
1 Place the chopped herbs in a saucepan, and pour in  
the water.
2 Cover the pan with a lid and bring to a boil, then simmer 
gently for 15–20 minutes.
3 Strain the decoction and divide into 3 doses for use that day.
INGREDIENTS
1 heaping tsp dried herb,  
or 2 tsp chopped fresh herb
6ﬂ oz (175ml) boiling water
INGREDIENTS
31⁄2oz (100g) dried herbs or 10oz 
(300g) ﬁnely chopped fresh herbs
2 cups vegetable oil, such as organic 
sunﬂower or olive oil
METHOD
1 Place the chopped herbs in a cup or teapot, and pour the 
boiling water over the herbs.
2 Leave to steep for 10 minutes, preferably covered to avoid the 
loss of volatile oils in the steam. Strain the infusion before use.
METHOD
1 Place the ﬁnely chopped herbs in a heatproof bowl, and add 
the oil to completely cover the herbs.
2 Place the bowl over a pan of boiling water on the stove, cover, 
and heat gently for 2 hours. Top off with water as needed.
3 Strain the mixture and repeat by adding fresh herbs to the  
oil and warming again for 1 hour.
4 Strain the oil, pour into a sterilized dark glass bottle (p194), 
and label with the name and date.
5 If using fresh herbs, let the oil stand for a few hours after 
straining to allow water from the herbs to sink to the bottom. 
Pour off the oil into the sterilized bottle and discard any water. 
Store in a cool place and use within 3 months.
HERB BASICS

HERB BASICS 343
The medicinal properties of herbs can be extracted using a mixture of water and herbs to give a 
preparation called a tincture. The alcohol acts as a preservative, making this an excellent way to 
store herbs out of season; a tincture will keep for up to 12 months.
Volume for volume, tinctures are much stronger than infusions, decoctions, or macerates, so 
should be used in smaller quantities. See individual herb entries in the A–Z (pp10–137) for 
speciﬁc dosage instructions. Tinctures may vary in strength (e.g., 1:3 or 1:5), so always follow the 
dosage instructions on the bottle when buying. Dosages in the A–Z are based on a 1:5 tincture 
unless otherwise speciﬁed. These quantities makes an approximately 1:5 tincture.
Tinctures
INGREDIENTS
7oz (200g) dried herb (fresh herbs  
will need to be dried prior to use,  
in order to reduce the water content 
of the tincture)
1 quart (1 liter) 37.5% proof vodka
METHOD
1 Chop the herbs ﬁnely, and place in a large sterilized sealable 
jar (p194).
2 Immerse the herbs completely in the alcohol.
3 Seal the jar and store for 2 weeks away from direct sunlight, 
shaking occasionally. 
4 Strain the mixture through a piece of cheesecloth and then 
ﬁlter through an unbleached coffee ﬁlter.
5 Pour into a sterilized dark glass bottle (p194). Label clearly 
with the name and date, and store in a cool, dark place.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
HERB SAFETY
Herbs and herbal remedies should be treated with 
respect. Individual herb entries in the A–Z (pp10–137) 
give cautionary notes for each herb. Follow the 
method, dosage, and usage instructions closely.
ESSENTIAL OIL SAFETY 
Essential oils contain the active ingredients of a plant  
in a highly concentrated form, and should be treated 
with respect and always diluted in vegetable base oil 
before use. A typical dilution for a massage oil is 2 
percent combined essential oils to 98 percent base oil. 
Essential oils must be diluted before adding to a bath, 
e.g., 5 drops of essential oil in 1 tbsp (15ml) of vegetable 
oil or milk. They should never be taken internally 
without professional recommendation, and children 
under two should not be treated with essential oils. 
Some essential oils, such as basil and sage, should be 
avoided during pregnancy; consult an aromatherapist 
before using any essential oils at this time.
SOAP SAFETY
Soap-making requires accurate measuring and is 
potentially dangerous. The soap recipes in this book  
are not to be attempted by children. Buy 100 percent 
sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) and always wear 
protective plastic gloves and goggles. When you ﬁrst 
make a soap, it is extremely alkaline because of the 
caustic soda and has a very high pH value that drops 
over several weeks as the soap dries out. Test its pH 
value (pH testing kits are widely available) to see if it  
is too alkaline to use. It will eventually drop to a pH of 
10–10.5, which is normal for soap but can still be an 
irritant to sensitive skin.
