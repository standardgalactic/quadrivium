About the Author
Blake Ross discovered computers when he was 4 and hasn’t had time to eat
since then. He began working at Netscape at 14 and cofounded the Firefox
project two years later to make the Web easy to use for plain old human
beings. He also cofounded the SpreadFirefox.com community evangelism 
project, which has changed the face of software marketing and distribution.
Blake was featured on the cover of Wired Magazine in early 2005, and he has
since been featured in dozens of international publications and television
shows to promote computing simplicity. He is on leave from Stanford
University, where he is an undergraduate.
Blake is currently working on a new project with some of the original Firefox
team. If you enjoy Firefox, you’ll enjoy what’s coming next, so sign up at
www.blakeross.com to hear when it launches.


Dedication
For my family, who taught me everything I know. Except the computer stuff.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Many thanks to my family and friends for sticking by me and putting up with
my crazy hours (the sun is rising as I write this). 
Thanks to Mark Enochs and Steve Hayes at Wiley for reminding me to actu-
ally, you know, finish this book, and for putting up with the idiosyncrasies of
a first-time For Dummies author. Likewise, this wouldn’t have happened with-
out Virginia Sanders and James Russell, who rigorously reviewed the book
and fixed every sentence-ending preposition you can think of. (Almost.)
Many thanks to Jatin Billimoria for helping to plan and write the book when
my time was sparse.
Thanks to the MozillaZine community for their generous contributions to
the book.
And finally, thanks to everyone at Mozilla who helped take Firefox to the top:
Mitchell Baker, Chris Beard, Asa Dotzler, Rafael Ebron, Brendan Eich, Ben
Goodger, Joe Hewitt, Chris Hofmann, Dave Hyatt, Dave Hyatt’s closet, Paul
Kim, John Lilly, Scott MacGregor, Marcia Knous, Gervase Markham, Stuart
Parmenter, Jesse Ruderman, Brian Ryner, Mike Shaver, Boris Zbarsky, and
everyone else. On to the next 100 million!

Introduction
I
f you’re the kind of person who walks away from the computer thinking,
“That was pleasant! Let me bake some cookies for those kids at MIT,” nei-
ther Firefox nor this book is for you.
Firefox was created for people who hate computers; who are fed up with
popup ads and an Internet that takes regular coffee breaks; and who are baf-
fled by software that seems to have a mind of its own. In short, Firefox was
created for people — not programmers.
The reason a mild-mannered author can make such a bold claim is that under-
neath this cool exterior, I’m not only an author — I’m also a founder! I helped
start Firefox — not to make money (it’s free), or sell a company (it’s non-profit),
but for the express purpose of making your life easier. The other developers
and I want every Firefox experience to feel like your first foray onto the Net. We
want to take you back to a time when the Web was new and exciting, when
spam was lunch meat and advertisements were found only in books, on televi-
sion, throughout public transportation systems, on people . . . you get the idea.
But we wouldn’t turn down cookies.
About This Book
If Firefox is your time machine, Firefox For Dummies is your H.G. Wells. The
goal of this book is not just to show you Firefox itself, but to help you have a
more enjoyable and productive online experience with Firefox. Remember
your high school science fair? We’re not here to blow up celery. We’re here to
blow up celery to test the effects of explosives on vegetables. It’s a very strong
practical focus, and one I strive to maintain throughout the book.
Along the way, I offer a behind-the-scenes look at Firefox development
through sidebars that don’t distract from the main content. Some of these
sidebars offer insight into why we made certain product designs. Others are
lighthearted anecdotes of the growing pains that occurred as Firefox evolved
from a tiny hobbyist project to an international success. (Note: This book is
written for Firefox 1.5.)
One great thing about developer-authors is that if anything goes wrong with
your Firefox experience, whether the error lies in this book or in the software,
it’s my fault. You don’t have to spend any time figuring out who deserves an
earful. It’s me, all me. See? Firefox is making your life easier already!

How This Book Is Organized
Like most For Dummies books, this book is organized into parts, which are
divided into chapters.
When we began work on Firefox, we identified four key issues to focus on:
 Painless transition from other browsers
 A simplified browsing experience
 Online security and privacy
 Personal customization
Likewise, the first four parts of this book focus on those areas, and the fifth
part encompasses additional reference material and little-known tips and
tricks.
Part I: Getting Fired Up
This part introduces you to the fundamental concepts of the World Wide
Web, explains Firefox’s role in the system, and helps you begin using it. If you
currently use another Web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or
Apple Safari, this part can also help you make a smooth transition to Firefox
by explaining terminology differences and showing you how to import your
information, such as browsing history and bookmarks.
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox
After you’ve gotten your feet wet, this part helps you dive into the core activi-
ties you’ll do online everyday — finding and downloading information, book-
marking and revisiting your favorite sites, and printing. This is also your first
glimpse of Firefox’s innovative tabbed browsing system, which will forever
change the way you surf the Web.
Part III: Outfoxing Hackers
This part explains some basic principles of online safety, outlines how Firefox
protects you, and suggests additional steps you can take to protect yourself. It
2
Firefox For Dummies 

also offers a comprehensive look at the kinds of information Firefox records
during your online travels — such as saved passwords and Web site history —
and shows you how to clear this information.
Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox
This is the really fun part — the one that shows you how to customize your
online experience, both how it looks (with themes) and how it feels (with
preferences). If you want your browser to have a particular theme, this is the
chapter to visit. As if that weren’t enough, this part also introduces you to
Firefox’s powerful extensions system, which allows you to extend Firefox
beyond its typical capabilities by installing tiny plug-ins with one click.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The usual cap on most For Dummies books, this part offers the poor geek’s ver-
sion of David Letterman’s top ten lists, including the top ten ways Firefox makes
your life easier and the ten things you don’t know about Firefox but should.
Icons Used in This Book
Tips are helpful Firefox shortcuts that you might not discover on your own.
You don’t have to follow any tips to get the job done, but they’ll often save 
you time.
These icons point out the kind of nuts-and-bolts information that make the
geek in me smile, but might be of little interest to you. However, feel free to
check them out if your inner geek wants some extra information.
Warnings are in place to prevent you from losing data, revealing your pass-
words to nosy onlookers, or otherwise doing something most people would
consider undesirable and unintended. You should always read and make sure
you understand warnings before continuing.
File these rare tidbits of information away in your brain for later reference.
They’re sure to come in handy.

Introduction

Conventions
Most of this book is written in the English language, which appears to be just
fine with you. However, I discuss keyboard shortcuts so frequently that it
helps to refer to them in shorthand. As the name suggests, a keyboard short-
cut is a quick way to access a program command from the keyboard, and you
execute them by pressing two or three keys simultaneously — special keys,
such as Control (Ctrl), and a letter, such as C. (This is a common shortcut to
copy text.) Rather than spelling out shortcuts each time, I abbreviate them as
key+letter (for example, Ctrl+C).
When I suggest or mention keywords that can be entered on-screen as search
terms, I put them in italic. When you have to choose commands from menus, I
write File➪Exit when you should choose the Exit command from the File menu.
Feedback
Firefox — and, by extension, this book — exists because hundreds of people
just like you asked for a better Internet experience. Your feedback motivates
us to keep working toward that goal. I encourage you to send comments, sug-
gestions, or rants about this book or Firefox itself to me at: 
blake@firefox.com. 
I read and respond to all mail.

In this part . . .
A
dapting to new software can be painful, but Firefox
makes it easy to transition away from your current
browser. The developers of Firefox have purposely 
mimicked certain design elements and keyboard short-
cuts of Internet Explorer and other browsers, and Firefox
can import your settings, bookmarks, browsing history,
and saved passwords. 
This part opens with a brief overview of why Firefox is
worth switching to and then walks you through the brief
transition process. The chapters in this part help you on
your way to a better browsing experience.

T
here’s just one Internet, but there isn’t one Internet experience. How
safely, easily, and quickly you browse the Web is a function of the browser
you’re using. Firefox is the only one designed to meet the demands of a wired
world, so if you’re not using it, you’re stuck in rush hour traffic — while 100
million others whiz by you in the carpool lane. But before I tell you why to
change lanes, I tell you what a browser is.
What Is a Browser, Anyway?
Many people confuse a Web browser with a search engine, such as Google. It’s
a reasonable mistake because most daily browsing begins with a search.
However, whereas a search engine finds Web sites, a browser displays them.
Think of the browser as your window to the Web. It doesn’t have specific
knowledge about the scenery (like a search engine), but you need to look
through it to see what’s out there.
In addition to displaying Web sites, the browser provides tools to help you
navigate among them. I talk about basic commands like Back and Forward in
Chapter 2, but most browsers also include features like Bookmarks, which
help you keep track of your favorite pages. Successful browsers hide the
complex underpinnings of the Web and make surfing safe, pleasurable, and
easy. Check out Figure 1-1.

Why Use Firefox?
On the day the other developers and I started work on Firefox, before we had
any users, and back when a firefox was just a red panda (it’s true!), we wrote
down our goals in a one-page “vision” document. It began:
“Why Create Firefox? We want to have fun and build an excellent, user-
friendly browser without all the constraints (features, compatibility, mar-
keting, month long discussions, etc.) that afflict the current browser
development.”
The document went on to outline the requirements Firefox had to meet, as I
discuss in the following sections.

Chapter 1: Why You Should Fire Your Old Browser
Giving birth to a Firefox (or, how I spent 
my high school years)
For a browser so focused on delivering sim-
plicity, Firefox boasts an absurdly complicated
past that dates back to the beginning of the
mainstream Web itself. The story begins with a
little company called Netscape, which made the
first consumer-oriented, visual Web browser.
Netscape almost single-handedly sparked the
online revolution, and from 1995 through 1997, 
it dominated the browser industry. As the 
millennium drew to a close, however, Netscape
faced increasingly fierce competition from
Microsoft, which undercut Netscape by making
its browser free. With billions in the bank,
Microsoft could afford to throw thousands of
engineers at its fledgling — Internet Explorer —
and lose money for years.
Two milestones radically — but, in hindsight,
futilely — changed Netscape’s direction around
this time. First, the online service juggernaut
America Online (AOL) purchased Netscape for
$4.2 billion. Second, Netscape tried to level the
playing field against Microsoft by making the
historic decision to release its browser code
through a development model called open
source. Most software companies jealously
guard their source code because any competi-
tor who obtains it can easily copy the product.
However, desperate times called for desperate
measures. Netscape was banking on a global
community of volunteer developers to emerge
and help build its next-generation browser.
Volunteers, in turn, would get a chance to influ-
ence and develop an Internet browser still used
by millions. Leveraging free talent was
Netscape’s only shot against the world’s richest
software company.
Although it ultimately failed to keep the com-
pany afloat in the browser wars, Netscape’s
decision to open source the code lead to a
vibrant community of volunteers known as
Mozilla that persevered long after Netscape
bowed out. Self-governing, passionate about
the Web, and funded largely on donations, the
Mozilla community quickly garnered respect in
the development community. The great thing
about open source is that anyone can join,
regardless of experience, age or other con-
straints typically imposed on candidates in the
professional world. I joined the community
during high school at age 14, and soon after-
ward, my efforts landed me a series of intern-
ships at (rapidly sinking) Netscape.
Working in the Mozilla community and later
interning at Netscape were wonderful experi-
ences, and I probably couldn’t have asked for a
better job. However, there was an itch that
couldn’t be scratched in either role: the obses-
sive desire to create a simple, lightweight
browser that didn’t encumber non-technical
people with meaningless jargon and endless
options. It was difficult to achieve this in Mozilla
because the volunteer developers were more
interested in creating a browser that catered to
themselves (with all of the associated power-
user features). It was also difficult to achieve
this at Netscape because the company — now
hanging on by a thread — resorted to monetiz-
ing its flagship browser at the cost of a simple
user experience. Meanwhile, having won the
browser wars, Microsoft all but abandoned the
browser market entirely. Intrigued by such a
wide-open opportunity, I found a small group of
others within Mozilla and Netscape who shared
my itch, and in 2002, we scratched it. Firefox
was born.

Firefox solves your Internet headaches
It’s little wonder that computers are so difficult to use: The developers who
make them have a much higher tolerance for pain. Something that’s “hard”
for an average user is easy for them, and when the user is screaming “I swear
I’ll throw this computer out the window!” the developer is just getting
warmed up.
We’ve found two problems with the way most software is developed:
 Some developers intentionally design products for themselves. This
results in products that are made by geeks and intended for fellow
geeks. The average user then has no idea how to use the product.
 Some developers just can’t help designing products for themselves.
They intend to make a product for the user, but they can’t help tweaking
it into a confusing behemoth of a program.
We solved the first problem by declaring our intent in the Firefox manifesto:
“The interface will not be geeky nor will it have a hacker-focus. The idea is to
design the best Web browser for most people.” Solving the second, however,
requires an understanding of how non-developers look at and use software,
and that isn’t easy to come by.
Enter my mother. I started working on Firefox toward the end of high school,
after many years of jogging down the hall to help her with computer prob-
lems. That hall bridged the generation gap and opened my eyes to how
“normal” people use and understand computers.
Every Firefox developer has a story like that. Some observe their friends and
family struggling; others sit down with strangers in book stores and coffee
shops. We want to understand what’s wrong with your Web experience and
how we can fix it. In the following sections, I discuss the main complaints
we’ve gathered.
“I can’t stand all the clutter.”
Buttons. Menus. Windows. Popups. Technology is supposed to help people,
so why does it always stand in your way? We want Firefox to be practically
invisible, so if we’ve done our job properly, you shouldn’t notice it. Popup
ads and other nuisances are blocked silently and automatically, and only the
features you need are included.
One of those features is called tabbed browsing, and it will change the way
you surf the Web. Tabbed browsing is the kind of thing that’s hard to explain
10
Part I: Getting Fired Up 

but easy to fall in love with. (Figure 1-2 shows you tabs, and Chapter 7 tells
you more about them.) When you work with tabs, you enjoy multiple Web
pages in the same window, just a click away from each other! No more littered
taskbar!
11
Chapter 1: Why You Should Fire Your Old Browser
A Firefox by any other name
In an industry built on Windows, it’s hardly sur-
prising that the question I’m asked most often
concerns Firefox’s unusually eye-catching
name. In fact, Firefox has gone by three names
throughout its short lifetime.
When we started work on the Firefox project in
2002, we called it Phoenix after the mythical bird
that is reborn from its own ashes. This was a
tongue-in-cheek reference to the fact that the
product was being reborn out of the ashes of
Netscape, the very first Web browser. Because
Firefox is based on much of the same underlying
code as Netscape, this was an apt metaphor. It
was also a playful jab at a company that, we felt,
had stopped adequately serving its customers,
and desperately needed to be reborn.
Unfortunately, we were a very small — and very
broke — team in those days, and we didn’t have
the money or the wherewithal to do any sort of
legal inquiry into the name. As Phoenix grew
more popular, we were contacted by a com-
pany who claimed ownership of the trademark.
To avoid legal problems, we changed the name
to Firebird, a synonym for Phoenix that evokes
the same imagery. Of course, we still didn’t have
any money, and we just wanted to get back to
work on the browser. So we didn’t bother inquir-
ing about this name, either.
We soon learned that a database project was
already using the name Firebird, and the
encroachment was even worse this time,
because the project was open source and com-
munity-developed — just like Firefox. Oops.
Because Firebird had grown fairly popular by
this point, we wanted to keep the Fire moniker for
continued name recognition, and spent about
three months just bouncing ideas off each other:
 Fireblast?
 Fireworks?
 Firefox?
 Firesoup?
Bingo! Firesoup it was. No, just kidding. We did,
of course, pick Firefox, and this time we made
sure we had rights to the name. Contrary to pop-
ular belief, a Firefox is actually not a fox — it’s a
Chinese red panda, as shown in the figure.
Of course, our community wasn’t going to let us
off the hook so easily — especially after we
poked fun at Netscape with our first two names.
Soon after this final name change, a volunteer
created an extension called Firesomething that
randomly assigns a new name to Firefox each
time you start — like Firecat or, yes, even
Fireblake. What goes around comes around.

“I can never find what I’m looking for.”
And who can blame you? There are over 12 billion pages on the Web. The
Search Box in the upper-right corner gives you direct access to a handful of
top search engines from wherever you are (see Figure 1-3) and allows you to
add engines to that list (see Chapter 4). When you find a relevant page, use
the Find Bar to drill down even further (see Figure 1-4). Chapter 4 outlines
how Firefox helps you find what you’re looking for.

“The Internet is a scary place.”
Every day, the media warns you about rampant identity theft, yet the world’s
most-used browser — Internet Explorer — has the worst security track
record of any product. Firefox was built with your security in mind and for-
bids the technologies that make Internet Explorer so exploitable. Hundreds of
thousands of volunteers across the globe test for problems before Firefox
reaches your computer.
Firefox also gives you complete control over the information it stores while
you’re surfing, such as browsing history and saved passwords. You can
choose how long Firefox remembers this information, and you can clear it all
at once with a simple keystroke: Ctrl+Shift+Delete in Windows (see Figure 1-5;
see Chapter 14).
“The Internet is slow.”
Over the past five years, a plague called spyware has infected computers world-
wide. Spyware is a kind of software that creeps onto your machine and watches
what you’re doing so it can display supposedly relevant advertisements. It isn’t

13

just a distraction; it’s an invasion of your privacy, and it slows your computer
to a crawl. Research indicates that much of the spyware on computers today
comes through Internet Explorer. Firefox helps you avoid these annoying
pests. When you cut down the spyware on your computer, your Internet con-
nection speeds up.
“Computers are stubborn.”
Sometimes it seems like you have to obey software and not the other way
round. Firefox knows who’s boss: You are. Build your dream browser through
glamorous themes (see Figure 1-6; check out Chapter 17 for more info) and
powerful extensions that reshape, redesign, and enrich Firefox (see Figure 1-7
and Chapters 20 and 22). You can also customize your toolbars to your
heart’s content, as I explain in Chapter 18.
Themes change the appearance of toolbars, buttons, and windows.

“I can’t find the files I downloaded.”
It’s amazing that you can retrieve files from all over the world, but if you can’t
find them on our own computers after you download them, you have a prob-
lem. Firefox integrates a Download Manager that offers one-click access to
your downloaded files (see Figure 1-8; see Chapter 11).
“Staying up-to-date is stressful.”
As wonderful as the Internet is, it can be overwhelming. Some people track so
many sources of information that it’s impossible to keep up. Firefox brings
the news to you through a feature called Live Bookmarks — bookmarks that
can update themselves. Whether you want to stay on top of the headlines,
the weather, or your sister’s blog, Firefox keeps you connected automatically.

Figure 1-9, for example, shows the latest batch of headlines from BBC News.
Firefox creates and updates this list automatically. (See Chapter 5 for more
about bookmarks and live bookmarks.)
Firefox is developed by people who care
The greeting card writers are calling me now, but I don’t know how else to
say it: Firefox developers care. You’ve heard this sales pitch from companies
before, but there are two differences here: We aren’t selling anything, and we
aren’t a traditional company.
Firefox is a free product that is guided by a non-profit organization. Unlike
most other software projects, Firefox is developed by a global network of 
volunteers through a development model called open source. This model
ensures that the project remains open and guided by its principles, not by
the ambitions of any one individual or corporation. There are no riches to be
had and no stocks to be sold; Firefox developers are here because they want
to create a better browser.

Part I: Getting Fired Up 

If you aren’t using Firefox, you’re probably using Microsoft Internet Explorer.
And like most other people I’ve talked to, you probably aren’t thrilled with
the experience. Maybe it’s the incessant popup ads or the weekly security
updates. Maybe your computer moves more slowly than your teenage son on
Monday morning. Maybe you can’t pinpoint the problem; the browser just
feels inadequate.
Firefox solves these problems, but I don’t waste pages in this book giving you
a feature-by-feature comparison. Feature charts are for marketing depart-
ments (yawn), which we Firefox developers don’t have to worry about
(woo!). Instead, I talk about motivations. I look at what drives the people
behind these products.
Internet Explorer is developed by a company that exists, first and foremost,
to make money for its shareholders. This is not an attack; it’s just the reality
of a public company. Using Internet Explorer wasn’t always so painful. But
after it became mainstream over four years ago, Microsoft stopped develop-
ing it. After all, why upgrade a free product? Since then, sleazy salespeople
have come up with a horde of new tricks to bother you online, but Microsoft
has had no financial reason to combat them. Internet Explorer has thus
become outdated and inadequate.
Firefox began as a hobby, not a corporate expenditure. I started it with Dave
Hyatt, a co-worker of mine at Netscape, another browser company, when
Netscape stopped seeing users and started seeing dollar signs. We aren’t
driven by revenues or competition. Our users are our only shareholders, and
they are the ones we need to satisfy.
You have nothing to lose
It takes just a couple minutes to start using a browser that could save you
hundreds of hours and dozens of gray hairs. Your bookmarks, saved pass-
words, browsing history, and other information are transferred automatically
from your old browser to Firefox. And it’s free. Why not?

 Discovering basic Web concepts
 Getting comfortable with the Firefox interface
N
ew software is overwhelming, and not just for the person using it. When
my mother tries a new program, I don’t get to sleep for weeks. Although
the other Firefox developers and I have tried to make Firefox self-explanatory,
any change involves a learning curve. This chapter explains the basics of the
Web and the Web browser, and then shows how they apply in a Firefox world.
Most importantly, it walks you through the buttons and toolbars you will use
in your day-to-day surfing.
Wandering the Web
The Web began as an arcane communications tool for scientists and govern-
ment officials, but today a half-billion people have usurped it for everything
from shopping to photo swapping. I won’t bore you with a longwinded
description of what the Internet is and how it came to be, but I do want to
share some of the fundamental concepts that I explore throughout this book.
The Web is a global network of billions of pages. In the real world, this would
be an organizational nightmare. Can you imagine the filing cabinets? But the
Web offers a radical solution: There is no solution. Rather than being neatly
categorized and indexed, the Web is literally one giant mess. Pages come and
go at random, and no central authority keeps tabs on them.
If this is a weakness of the Web, it’s also its greatest strength. Because there’s no
Web authority, nobody censors, controls, or monopolizes content. Anyone with
an Internet connection can broadcast his or her message around the world.

Looking for links
The glue that holds the Web together is the link, a clickable target on a page
that takes you to a new page or elsewhere within the same page. In the early
days of the Web, most links were underlined blue text, but today almost any-
thing can be a link — even pictures. Perhaps the best part about links is that
they don’t discriminate; they can bridge a sports page to a pasta recipe or
connect a news site to your family photos. A typical Web site (such as www.
onlinecomics.net) might contain dozens of links to other pages, as shown
in Figure 2-1.
Increasing your search engine savvy
In a medium as chaotic as the Web, where do you begin? Let a search engine
be your guide. Search engines are tools that try to make sense of the Web’s
information. The most popular ones, such as Google (www.google.com) and
Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com), can reveal thousands of useful pages on any topic
in under a second, as shown in Figure 2-2. Many people confuse search
engines and browsers, but the two are quite different; see the section “A
Browser Is Not a Search Engine,” later in this chapter.

20

Feeling at home with Web addresses
Just as each home in your city has a unique address, each page on the
Internet has an address that people can use to access it. Fortunately, Internet
addresses don’t require directions. (“Turn right, then left, continue on for 4
million pages. . . .”) Unfortunately, Internet addresses are absurdly compli-
cated and serve as daily reminders that the Internet wasn’t originally
designed for normal folk. Even the simplest ones look like gibberish:
http://www.dog.com/
The .com suffix here means that the Web site at this address belongs to
a commercial entity (indeed, this is a dog supplies outfit). Other suffixes
include .org for organizations and .net for Internet providers.
In general, understanding the meaning of Web addresses isn’t important. As
long as you know where to type them, you can get where you want to be.
The home page is where the heart is
When it comes to browsing, the home page is a Web site that loads automati-
cally when you start your browser and serves as your browsing launch pad.
Many companies aggregate news, sports scores, and other information onto a
Figure 2-2:

single portal page. As an example, Figure 2-3 shows the My Yahoo! page, at
http://my.yahoo.com. Some people set portals as their home pages, and
others prefer to start their browsing with a search engine. By default, Firefox
caters to the second group by offering a Google home page, but it’s easy to
change (see Chapter 16).
The Back, Forward, Reload, 
and Stop commands
Before you go onto the Web, you should understand four basic browsing
commands. These commands have been around since the dawn of the
Internet:
 Back returns you to the last Web site you visited. If you go to the CNN
Web site, click the Sports link, and then click Back, you’re back at the CNN
front page. Now you can click Forward to return to the Sports page.
 Reload fetches the newest version of the Web site you’re currently view-
ing. For example, you might want to leave the CNN Web site open and
reload it occasionally to see the latest headlines.
 Web sites take a little bit of time to load, but you can Stop loading them
at any time.

A Browser Is Not a Search Engine
It’s a reasonable mistake to confuse your browser with a search engine
because most daily browsing begins with a search. However, whereas a search
engine finds Web sites, a browser displays them. Think of the browser as your
window to the Web. It doesn’t have specific knowledge about the scenery (like
a search engine), but you need to look through it to see what’s out there.
In addition to displaying Web sites, the browser provides tools to help you
navigate among them. Most browsers include many features, like the
Bookmarks feature, which helps you keep track of your favorite pages.
Successful browsers hide the complex underpinnings of the Web and make
surfing pleasurable and easy.

(see Figure 2-4) you’ll use each day, identifying features by the names I use

When you first launch Firefox, you see the Firefox Start page shown in Figure
2-4. This page offers fast access to Google searches for news, images or gen-
eral content, and the reason you’re seeing it now is because it’s the default
home page. Take note of the box that holds the home page. This is called the
Content area, and all of the Web sites you visit will load here.
The toolbars
Three toolbars sit above the Content area. The first is the standard Menu Bar,
which you’re probably familiar with from other programs. The Menu Bar,
shown in Figure 2-4, offers access to virtually everything you can do in
Firefox, and I discuss each command in depth in Appendix A.
Below the Menu Bar is the Navigation Toolbar, also known as the primary
toolbar. By default, the Navigation Toolbar, shown in Figure 2-4, offers only
those commands you’ll need while browsing, such as Back and Forward. It
also includes the Location Bar, where you can type in the address of a page
you want to load. You can use the Search Box at the far right to search popu-
lar sites such as Google, Amazon, and eBay from anywhere on the Web.
The Bookmarks Toolbar, shown in Figure 2-4, provides a place to house your
most frequently used bookmarks. By default, Firefox includes two bookmarks
on this toolbar: Getting Started (a Firefox help page) and Latest Headlines (an
automatically updated list of news stories). Chapter 5 shows you how to
delete these items and add your own.
The Status Bar
Firefox also includes a Status Bar that sits at the very bottom of the window.
The Status Bar, shown in Figure 2-4, displays information about the page
you’re currently viewing. For example, as a Web site loads, the Status Bar dis-
plays progress information via a progress meter. When you move the mouse
pointer over a link on a Web site, the Status Bar displays the address of the
linked page. The Status Bar also displays information about the security of a
Web site, as I discuss in Chapter 15.

Sidebars
Firefox displays certain types of content in sidebars that open on the left side
of the screen. A sidebar doesn’t replace the Web site you’re viewing; it just
shoves it over to make room, as shown in Figure 2-5. This location makes it
an ideal access point for things you might need while surfing. For example,
Chapter 6 demonstrates displaying browsing history in a sidebar (shown in
Figure 2-5) so you can keep track of where you are and return to old sites
quickly. You can also display your bookmarks list and even arbitrary Web
sites in sidebars, as I discuss in Chapter 5, and as shown in Figure 2-6.

The Find Bar
The Find Bar (see Figure 2-7) is a thin toolbar that appears above the Status
Bar when you need to find text in a page. It replaces the Find window that
most other applications use, and we think it’s a much faster and less intru-
sive way to search. Chapter 4 discusses the Find Bar in depth.

nstalling Firefox is as easy as using it. After you install Firefox, the handy
Import Wizard allows you to import your settings and bookmarks from
other browsers — like switching flights but having your luggage transferred
automatically. Whether you use Windows or Macintosh, this chapter tells you
everything you need to know to get started.
System Requirements
You should check to make sure that your computer is powerful enough to
handle Firefox before installing it. If you bought your computer in the past
three or four years, it should be fine.
To install Firefox on Windows, we recommend using Windows XP, although
other flavors of Windows (such as Windows ME or Windows 2000) are sup-
ported as well. Your computer should also have at least a 500 MHz processor
and 128MB of RAM.
To install Firefox on the Macintosh, we recommend using OS X 10.1 or later.
For best performance, your computer should also have at least a 667 MHz
PowerPC G4 processor with 256MB of RAM and 72MB of free hard drive space.
Getting Firefox
Firefox is available both on CD from the Mozilla Store and as a free download
from the Firefox Web site.

Downloading Firefox
If you already have an Internet connection, the best way to get Firefox is by
downloading it for free from our Web site. It’s a small file, so it should only
take a few minutes to download — even on the slowest of Internet connec-
tions. To download the setup file:
1. Navigate to the Firefox Web site (www.getfirefox.com).
2. Click the Free Download link and save the Firefox Setup file to your
computer’s Desktop.
3. When the download finishes, double-click the Firefox Setup file on
your Desktop.
For Windows
If you are using Windows, the Setup Wizard appears and walks you through
the installation process, as shown in Figure 3-1. For detailed instructions, see
“Installing Firefox with the Setup Wizard,” later in this chapter.
For the Mac
If you are using a Macintosh, a folder containing a Firefox icon appears, as
shown in Figure 3-2. Simply drag the icon onto your desktop, then double-
click it to launch Firefox.

Using a Firefox CD
If you don’t yet have an Internet connection, or if you want to install Firefox
on your friends’ computers (remember, it’s free and open source!), you can
order Firefox on CD for just a few bucks from the online Mozilla Store. Orders
must be placed via the store’s Web site, so if your Internet connection isn’t
working yet, you can use a friend’s computer.
1. Navigate to the Mozilla Store Web site (www.store.mozilla.org).
2. Click Software & Guides in the left sidebar.
3. Add the Firefox CD to your cart.
4. When you finish shopping, click Check Out. If this is your first time
using the Mozilla Store, you will need to create an account. The Store
Web site walks you through this painless process.
5. When the CD arrives in the mail, put it in your computer’s CD tray.
For Windows
If you are using Windows, the Setup Wizard appears and walks you through
the installation process, as shown earlier in Figure 3-1. For detailed instruc-
tions, see “Installing Firefox with the Setup Wizard.”
If you’re using Windows and the Setup Wizard does not appear automatically,
you can open it manually. Double-click the My Computer icon on your
Desktop, double-click your CD drive, and double-click the Firefox Setup file.
For the Mac
If you’re using a Macintosh, a folder containing a Firefox icon appears, as
shown in Figure 3-2. Simply drag the icon onto your desktop, then double-
click the icon to launch Firefox.

Chapter 3: Setting Up Firefox

Installing Firefox with the Setup Wizard
On Windows, the Firefox Setup Wizard walks you through the installation
process. (The procedure on a Macintosh is a simple drag-and-drop operation
as described in the previous section.)
1. The first screen of the Setup Wizard welcomes you to Firefox. Click
Next to continue to the End-User Software License Agreement.
2. Select “I Accept the Terms of the License Agreement” and click Next.
You’ll probably just skip past End-User Software License Agreement
without reading the actual text, but it’s worth a read if you enjoy the fine
language of legalese. The Software License Agreement tells you, among
other things, that you can use Firefox free of charge, but if something
goes wrong, the Mozilla Foundation isn’t legally liable. Of course, in that
unlikely situation, we’re here to help.
3. The Setup Type screen appears, allowing you to select either a
Standard or Custom setup. If you have no preference where Firefox
installs and don’t need advanced tools, just accept the Standard
option and click Next.
The Custom option allows you to choose:
• Where Firefox gets installed on your computer. For example,
maybe you have several hard drives and you don’t want Firefox
setting up shop on the C drive.
• Whether Firefox installs advanced tools, like the Document
Inspector for analyzing Web site code. These tools are for
advanced users.
• Where Firefox should put its flashy, foxy icons. This option is 
available in case you don’t like clutter on your Desktop or in your
Start menu.
The Summary screen confirms what you’ve decided to install and where
it will be installed.
4. Click Next to begin installation.
The Install Complete screen appears when Firefox is installed.
5. Click Finish to launch Firefox.
By default, the Firefox Home Page is Firefox Start, which offers fast
access to Google Search. If you’ve installed Firefox before and would
rather keep your old home page, deselect the Use Firefox Start as My
Home Page check box.

Importing Your Information
When you first launch Firefox, the Import Wizard appears and walks you
through the migration process. You can also access the wizard at any time 
by choosing File➪Import.
Firefox supports importing information from any of the following browsers:
 Microsoft Internet Explorer
 Netscape
 Opera
 Apple Safari
 OmniWeb
 Camino
 And, of course, earlier versions of Firefox
The import process is short and sweet, and when you’re finished, Firefox
looks and acts like your previous browser. Where possible, importing adds to
your Firefox information rather than replacing it. For example, if you used
Firefox for a week before deciding to import, the bookmarks or passwords
you saved during that time won’t be lost, as you see in the following steps:
1. Open the Import Wizard by choosing File➪Import.
2. Select the browser to import from, and then click Next.
The first screen of the wizard lists the browsers currently installed on
your computer, as shown in Figure 3-3. If you aren’t ready to import,
click Cancel.
Figure 3-3:

Wizard auto-
matically

Chapter 3: Setting Up Firefox

3. Select the information to import, and then click Next.
Several options are available, as shown in Figure 3-4. The available
options depend on the browser from which you are importing.
• Internet Options: Transfer your former browser’s settings to
Firefox. Firefox can only transfer the settings it supports.
• Cookies: Transfer the cookies that are used in the other browser. A
cookie is a piece of information that a Web site stores on your com-
puter, such as your preferences for that site. Cookies make it easier
for a site to remember you if you have visited it before.
• Browsing History: Transfer the history of Web pages you’ve vis-
ited. Transferring your history allows you to revisit the sites you
visited with your former browser.
• Saved Form History: Transfer the form information collected by
your former browser’s form-filling mechanism. This way, you can
get access to form information, such as Internet searches, that is
saved in your other browser.
• Saved Passwords: Transfer passwords your former browser saved
when you logged in to Web sites.
• Favorites/Bookmarks: Transfer your list of bookmarks (also called
Favorites).
By default, Firefox imports everything it can, but you can deselect 
any type.
If you choose to import settings, Firefox will be configured as much like
your former browser as possible. Naturally, Firefox can’t support every
setting available in another browser, but it inherits the ones it can.

When you click Next, the import process begins. It should take less than
a minute.
4. The final screen (see Figure 3-5) shows you the information that Firefox
has imported. Congratulations! Click Finish to start using Firefox.
You can make Firefox look even more like your old one by customizing the
Firefox toolbars to match the other browser’s toolbars, as I discuss in
Chapter 18.
Switching from Internet Explorer
The Windows version of Firefox is designed for an easy transition from
Internet Explorer. It supports nearly all of the Internet Explorer 6.0 keyboard
shortcuts and offers similar toolbars, menus, and colors.
Keyboard shortcut differences
There are just two minor keyboard shortcut differences to be aware of if
you’re switching from Internet Explorer, as you see in Table 3-1.

Feature differences
Firefox does not support certain Safari features by default. However, in many
cases, you can download an extension that will add the same capabilities to
Firefox, and I note the extensions that are available. See Chapter 21 for more
information about installing and using extensions. Firefox does not support
the following Safari features:
 Snapback
 Bookmarks Synchronization (try the Bookmarks Synchronizer extension)
 Spell Check (try the SpellBound extension)
 Edit➪Special Characters
 Send Page (however, the Send Link command, which sends a link to a

Part I: Getting Fired Up 
A tale of two browsers
I spend much of this chapter discussing feature,
keyboard, and terminology differences among
browsers, but the most important difference is
in how browsers decide to lay out Web pages.
Although Web pages are fully interactive and
often beautifully designed documents by the
time they reach your screen, they are in fact a
jumble of computer instructions under the hood.
How a Web page looks on your screen depends
on how your particular browser decides to
interpret these instructions.
To ensure consistency among browsers, an open
standards organization called the World Wide
Web Consortium (W3C) oversees the develop-
ment of technical specs that govern the inter-
pretation of these instructions. Unfortunately,
from 1995 through about 2001 — the very time
period that launched the Web — the two domi-
nant browser vendors largely ignored the W3C.
Engaged in the software industry’s version of the
Space Race, Microsoft and Netscape created
their own Web “standards” in-house and evan-
gelized them to Web developers. Each vendor
hoped, of course, that more developers would
adopt its respective standard, thereby locking
out the other — since Web pages wouldn’t load
properly in the other’s browser.
Unfortunately, this devious strategy worked.
More unfortunately, it worked to the favor of
Microsoft, which now enjoys a monopoly on 
the Web. The lock-in strategy is viciously cycli-
cal: If most developers are developing for
Microsoft’s browser, users have to use that
browser to display Web sites properly. And if
most users are using Microsoft’s browser,
developers want to develop for it. In a world like
this, why would developers follow the W3C’s
standards? As rosy as a global Web standard
sounded, practical developers coded to
Microsoft’s de facto standard.
Part of the reason Firefox exists is to break
Microsoft’s hold on the Web. This kind of
monopoly is harmful to all of us, because it locks
us into Microsoft devices and leaves us at the
whims of an enormous public company that ulti-
mately answers to shareholders. Case in point:
In 2001, Microsoft abandoned development of
Internet Explorer, the most used software appli-
cation in the world, because the company had
no incentive to upgrade a free product after
winning the browser war against Netscape.
Good move for Wall Street, but perhaps not
such a good move for you, if you were one of the
500 million Internet Explorer users left to fend for
themselves.
Firefox adheres closely to the W3C standards to
promote a Web that works on any device, any
platform, anywhere. When we first began the
project, we faced the difficult and often futile
challenge of convincing developers not to use
Microsoft’s proprietary Web standards. However,
now that Firefox has won over 10 percent of the
browsing market — over 50 million users —
developers are starting to change course.
So what does this mean for you today as you
switch to Firefox? It means that about 97 per-
cent of the 12 billion (and counting) Web sites
out there should render perfectly well in Firefox
today, and that number continues to rise as
Firefox’s global market share increases. If you
come across a Web site that doesn’t look or
work properly in Firefox, you can let us know by
following the directions in the “Reporting
Broken Web Sites” section of this chapter.

Reporting Broken Web Sites
Every browser interprets and displays Web sites in different ways. Some Web
sites will look better in Firefox, but others might look worse or work improp-
erly. This is rare, but when it happens, it’s usually due to a programming
error in the Web site (assuming you haven’t yet tweaked the Firefox display
options I discuss in Chapter 19).
Firefox includes a tool you can use to notify us when you encounter a broken
Web site. We examine each submission to make sure it doesn’t indicate a
defect in Firefox itself. To help us, the reporting tool sends basic information
about your version and configuration of Firefox, as shown in Figure 3-6. If you
provide personal information, such as an e-mail address, it is not shared with
anyone outside the core Firefox team. Anonymous version information is
published to our extended development community.
If no Firefox defect is found, we notify the owner of the broken Web site and
help him or her fix the errors so the Web site works properly. After the Web
site is fixed, it starts working in your version of Firefox; you don’t need to
download anything.
To report a broken Web site:
1. Navigate to the broken Web site.
2. Choose Help➪Report Broken Web Site.
3. If this is the first time you’re accessing the Reporting Wizard, select
the check box underneath the policy to indicate your agreement, and
then click Next.
The first time you access the Reporting Wizard, it displays the Mozilla
Reporting Privacy Policy, as shown in Figure 3-6. You must agree to these
terms to continue.
4. The next and final screen of the Reporting Wizard (see Figure 3-7)
asks you to describe the problem:
• Web Site URL: The address of the Web site is already prefilled. If
the site requires a password, select the Web Site is Password-
Protected option. (Your login information is not sent to us.)
• Problem Type: Select the option that best describes the problem
you’re seeing or select Other if none match closely.
• Describe Problem: Enter a brief description of the problem. For
example, if you think part of the page is missing, indicate what you
expect to see and where you expect it.

Anything you enter into this field will be published, so don’t include per-
sonal information (such as name or e-mail address) here. (The Email text
box, however, is not published.)
• Email (Optional): Enter your e-mail address if you’d like the Firefox
team to follow up on your report. This address isn’t shared with
anyone and is used only to contact you regarding this particular
report. For example, we might contact you if we need additional
information about the problem or when the site has been fixed.

In This Chapter
 Searching the Web
 Finding text on a page
T
rying to find your car in a parking garage is hard enough as it is. Now
imagine that the parking garage has 12 billion cars, and all you know
about yours is that it’s white.
Finding the information you want on the Internet can be equally frustrating if
you don’t know where to begin. So-called search engines, such as Google and
Yahoo!, map the Web’s information for you to make it searchable. Firefox
works closely with these search engines to help you find information quickly
and easily.
Searching the Web with Firefox
Finding information on the Web is as easy as “telling” a search engine what
you want to find, clicking a button, and combing through the information the
engine returns. The trick is in the telling. A search engine can’t understand
sentences the way a human does, so follow these tips to get better results:
 Be succinct. Search only for the keywords that define what you want.
For example, if you’re looking for ski resorts in Lake Tahoe, try ski
resorts Lake Tahoe instead of the more conversational “Where can I find
ski resorts in Lake Tahoe?” Many engines, however, are getting better at
understanding the latter format.
 Be specific. Although being succinct is important, you also need to
strive to be as specific as possible. Use distinct, targeted words that pre-
cisely describe what you’re looking for. For example, Lake Tahoe
Karaoke returns about a tenth of the results as Lake Tahoe night life, as
does Lake Tahoe comedy club.

 Don’t worry about case. Virtually all search engines ignore the casing of
your search phrase, which means that Lake Tahoe is equal to lake tahoe.
 Use quotes for phrases. By default, search engines look for pages that
contain any of the words you enter. When you want to search for a
phrase that consists of multiple words, you can enclose it in quotation
marks, and the engine finds only pages that contain the entire phrase.
For example, searching for “Lake Tahoe” returns only pages that contain
the full phrase. Web sites that contain only Lake or only Tahoe are not
returned.
Searching for keywords and phrases at the same time is okay. For example, to
find a healthy restaurant near Lake Tahoe, you could search healthy restaurant
“Lake Tahoe”. You probably wouldn’t want to include healthy restaurant in
quotation marks because most sites wouldn’t include that phrase word for
word. Instead, they’d have restaurant at the beginning of the review, and
healthy elsewhere.
Because searching is such a common activity, you’re never more than one
click away from a search box where you can type your keywords in Firefox.
Searching from the default Firefox
home page
By default, Firefox offers a slightly modified version of Google — the leading
Internet search engine — as its home page (see Figure 4-1). This means that
as long as you don’t change your home page, you’ll be ready to begin search-
ing each time you start Firefox.
To perform a search from the default home page, follow these steps:
1. Click within the Google search box.
2. Type in your search keywords (for example, ski resorts Lake Tahoe).
3. Click the Google Search button (or press Enter) to begin your search.
Google returns a list of Web sites that are (hopefully) relevant to your
search.
Searches usually take less than a second, but they could take longer on
slower Internet connections. The Firefox Tabbed Browsing feature makes it
easy to navigate this list quickly; see Chapter 7 for more information.

Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

Searching from the Search Box
If you have changed your home page to something other than Google or if
you have navigated to a different Web site, you can still begin a search imme-
diately through the handy Firefox Search Box. It’s located on the right side of
the primary toolbar, to the right of the Location Bar and the Go button, as
shown in Figure 4-2.

Chapter 4: Finding Information Online

The Search Box works just as you would expect: Simply type in one or more
search terms and press Enter to see a list of Web sites that contain relevant
information.
To begin your search without having to reach for the mouse, press Ctrl+K in
Windows or Ô+K on the Mac. This shortcut quickly takes your cursor to the
Search Box. Pressing Alt+Enter instead of Enter in Windows, or Option+Return
on the Mac, loads the search results in a new tab when searching from the
Search Box.
Swapping Search Box engines
As with the home page, the Search Box uses Google by default because it is
widely considered to be the fastest and most accurate general-purpose
engine currently available. However, just as you can change your home page
to whatever you’d like, you can also change the engine used by the Search
Box. This is useful if you prefer another general-purpose engine, such as
Yahoo!, or if you’re looking for a specific type of information, such as a word
definition, and want to switch to an engine better equipped to handle it, such
as a dictionary.
To change your Search Box engine, follow these steps:
1. Click the icon to the left in the Search Box (refer to Figure 4-2).
The Firefox Search Box uses Google by default, so the icon you see is the
Google icon.
2. Choose a new engine from the menu that appears (see Figure 4-3).
Firefox remembers which engine you select and defaults to it in all future
windows.
To switch engines with the keyboard, press Ctrl+↓within the Search Box.
Choose a new engine from the menu.

This step loads the Firefox Central Web site.
3. Under the Add New Search Engines heading at the bottom of the page
(see Figure 4-4), find the engine you want to add.
If you don’t see the engine you want in the list, click the last link — Find

nized into categories (such as Reference and Shopping).
Hundreds of search engines are available to choose from. I outline some
of my favorites in Table 4-2.

Vietnamese. As if that weren’t enough, the articles are written
entirely by volunteer experts in each subject area. Because
every volunteer has a voice, no article is subject to the kind of
bias — intentional or otherwise — you can often detect in arti-
cles written by a single author.

which haven’t even hit screens yet.

Searching from the Location Bar
Firefox allows advanced users to search the Web from the Location Bar — the
box in which you typically enter the address of a Web site to visit. This can
be useful if, for example, you have hidden the Search Box to conserve space.
Simple searching with Location Bar keywords
At the simplest level, searching from the Location Bar requires no additional
work on your part. If you enter a series of keywords into the box and press
Enter (or click Go), Firefox automatically treats the phrase as a search

Chapter 4: Finding Information Online
Firefox developers felt lucky
We fiercely debated whether to conduct a tra-
ditional Google search or Google’s I’m Feeling
Lucky search as the default search method for
the Location Bar. All other browsers at the time
conducted normal searches, but the Firefox
development team eventually decided that the
benefits of an I’m Feeling Lucky search far out-
weighed the break with consistency. Two ben-
efits in particular motivated our decision:
 Many of us on the Firefox team share a
strong (if naïve) desire to rid the world of the
arcane site addressing system. We believe
http://www.fordvehicles.com/
is a ridiculous bunch of gibberish that no
sane human being should ever have to
remember. What was that address again?
Ford.com? 
Fordtrucks.com? 
Ford-vehi-
cles.com? Or was there no dash? And what
does all that http:// stuff mean, anyway?
Did somebody’s cat walk across the key-
board? This addressing system is just one of
the many painful reminders that the Internet
was originally designed for military officials,
scientists, and other similarly technical
crowds.
Choosing the I’m Feeling Lucky search as the
default search method in Firefox’s Location
Bar, then, was our first tentative step toward
bypassing this arcane addressing system.
Instead of having to remember an address,
you simply have to remember a couple key-
words that describe what you’re looking for
and have faith that Google and Firefox will
find it for you. For example, instead of worry-
ing about whether there’s a dash in
http://www.fordvehicles.com/,
you can type “Ford trucks”, “Ford vehicles”,
“Ford SUVs”, “Ford cars”, or even “Ford
vehicle info” and be on your way. Or take the
example of the horror flick The Ring:Is the site
address http://www.thering.com,
theringmovie.com, or the-ring.
com? Actually, it’s none of those. It’s 
ring-themovie.com. But if you have
trouble remembering that, just type the ring
into the Location Bar and press Enter.
 The Location Bar is very much a place of
action, whereas combing through search
results is traditionally a more casual and
longer-term approach. Internet surfers are
all accustomed to using the address bar to
get somewhere quickly, and the other
developers and I wanted to uphold that.

request. Unlike a traditional search, however, you don’t see a list of relevant
Web sites. Instead, Firefox automatically takes you to the page that most
likely contains what you’re looking for. Firefox does this neat trick by using
Google’s I’m Feeling Lucky technology, which automatically redirects you to
the very first Google search result for your search phrase.
Specialized searching with Location Bar keywords
Firefox also allows you to conduct searches from the Location Bar by using
Search Keywords. Rather than typing an address, you type the keyword that
represents the search engine you want to use, followed by the phrase to
search for. By default, Firefox includes four Search Keywords that you can
use from the Location Bar. (You can also add your own special words, but
this is a very advanced topic beyond the scope of this book.) I outline these
in Table 4-3.

For example, you can type quote GOOG and find out the current value

Finding Text within a Page
Unfortunately, finding the Web page you’re looking for is often just half the
battle. The other half is finding the specific bit of information you’re looking
for within that page. Fortunately, Firefox offers a powerful tool called the Find
Bar, which makes searching pages easy.

Chapter 4: Finding Information Online
In search of a better Find feature
Because the Find Bar is a radical departure from
the standard Find features in other programs, it
was also the subject of much debate during early
Firefox development. The concern wasn’t that
Firefox searched as you typed, but rather that the
Find feature now lived within a toolbar instead of
a window, and that this toolbar lived at the
bottom of the window instead of the top.
The problem with the standard Find window is
that it invariably gets in the way by obscuring the
very phrase you were trying to find. Some pro-
grams, such as Microsoft Word, try to alleviate
the problem by moving the Find window out of
the way automatically, but we found this behav-
ior even more annoying: Suddenly your windows
are playing musical chairs without your consent.
We modeled an alternate solution whereby the
Find feature was instead housed in a toolbar at
the bottom of the window and asked some
people to try it out. Their reaction was so posi-
tive that we decided the break with tradition was
warranted.
Software development is a tricky business,
however, and we overlooked one subtle flaw in
our model testing: Rather than allowing our test
users to discover the toolbar on their own, we
pointed them to it. Had we instead observed
them in their natural course, we would have
immediately discovered a problem that only
came to light much later on: Many people didn’t
notice the Find Bar’s appearance after they
opened it! We received many reports of the Find
in This Page option being broken.
That discovery came rather late in the develop-
ment process, and we needed to ship Firefox 1.0
soon, so our options were limited. We consid-
ered moving the toolbar to the top of the
window alongside all other toolbars, where it
would be less likely to go unnoticed. However,
the reason we placed it at the bottom in the first
place was to prevent the entire Web site from
shifting up or down to make room for the tool-
bar each time you opened or closed it. Moving
it to the top would mean introducing a long-term
annoyance just to fix a short-term problem of
discovery. That didn’t seem right.
We ultimately converged on a solution that,
although less than ideal, was suitable given our
time constraints. We decided that the first two
times the Find Bar is opened, its text box would
flash bright yellow to draw the user’s attention.
So, no, you’re not crazy. It really did blink!

Using the Find Bar
The Find Bar is a thin toolbar that appears along the bottom of a Web page
when you choose Edit➪Find in This Page or when you press Ctrl+F (Windows)
or Ô+F (Mac). Like the finding capabilities in most other programs, the Find
Bar allows you to jump right to the spot on a Web page that contains a cer-
tain word or phrase. Unlike most other programs, however, Firefox searches
as you type the phrase, enabling you to stop typing as soon as you find it,
and ultimately saving you time. Let’s see how this works.
1. Navigate to www.getfirefox.com.
You can simply type get firefox in the Location Bar and press Enter! (Be
sure to see the earlier section, “Searching from the Location Bar,” to find
out more about this.)
2. Choose Edit➪Find in This Page or press Ctrl+F (Windows) or 
Ô+F (Mac).
3. In the Find Bar at the bottom of the window, type the word or phrase
you want to search for (see Figure 4-6).
For example, you can search for Thunderbird, the name of the e-mail
program produced by the Mozilla Foundation (the same organization
that develops Firefox).
Don’t include quotation marks unless you’re searching for a phrase that
contains them.
By default, searches are case-insensitive, which means thunderbird and
Thunderbird and THUNDERBIRD are treated as if they were all the same
word. To have Firefox treat them distinctly, select the Match Case check box
on the Find Bar.
Notice that even before you finish typing the word, Firefox has already found
the first instance of it, scrolled to it, and highlighted it (see Figure 4-6). For
my Thunderbird example, you could stop typing at Thunder or even Thu!
Now try typing Thunderfox. As soon as you type the f, Firefox highlights the
search box in bright red and displays Phrase not found on the right (see
Figure 4-7). Because Thunderf isn’t found on the page, no additional letters
are going to yield a match, and you can stop typing. Even when you’re look-
ing for something that isn’t to be found, Firefox saves you time.
52
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

Moving among multiple Find Bar results
If a page contains multiple instances of your search phrase, Firefox makes it
easy and intuitive to move among them. To move to the next phrase, click the
Find Next button or just press Enter. To move to the previous phrase, click
the Find Previous button or press Shift+Enter.
Because we wanted to minimize distraction, Firefox doesn’t display an error
message when you reach the end of a Web page in your search. Instead, you
see a message appear on the right side of the toolbar: Reached end of
page, continued from top. (See Figure 4-8.) If you choose Find Next at
this point, Firefox restarts your search from the beginning of the Web page.
When you finish searching, you can close the Find Bar by clicking the Close
button (the one with the X in it) at the far left or by pressing Esc.

irefox strives to make the Web easy to use for everyone, but it can’t avoid
one aspect of the Web: the complicated addressing system. Suppose your
friend Julie maintains a Web site at www.therosenbergfamily.com/julie/
start.html, and you visit it frequently to see how she’s doing. Why should
you have to remember such a long and seemingly absurd string of letters? Why
should you need to recall that the j in Julie is lowercase, contrary to what you
were taught in school?
You shouldn’t. And although Firefox can’t do away with such addresses alto-
gether, it can remember them so you don’t have to. Like many other browsers,
Firefox allows you to bookmark a Web site so you can easily return to it later
on — much as you would bookmark pages in a book. In the Internet Explorer
browser, these bookmarks are called Favorites. Firefox also offers sophisti-
cated but easy-to-use organizational tools to keep your bookmarks in order
whether you have 5 or 500.
Creating and Accessing Bookmarks
Bookmarking a Web page is about as easy as bookmarking a page in a book.
You just need to tell Firefox what to call the bookmark and where you want to
put it. By default, bookmarks appear in a list accessible from either the

Bookmarks menu or the Bookmarks Sidebar, which is a small panel that
opens on the left side of the screen (see the section “The Bookmarks Sidebar,”
later in this chapter). However, you can also organize bookmarks into folders
and subfolders so you can access them in a manner that suits you.
Creating a bookmark
To bookmark an interesting Web site, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the Web site you want to bookmark.
2. Choose Bookmarks➪Bookmark This Page to open the Add Bookmark
window.
You can open this window more quickly by pressing Ctrl+D (Windows)
or Ô+D (Mac).
3. In the Name text box, enter the name you would like to use for the
bookmark or accept the default name that appears there.
The name will appear in the Bookmarks menu and in the Bookmarks
Sidebar. By default, Firefox uses the title of the Web site you’re book-
marking as the name, as shown in Figure 5-1.
4. Select the folder in which you’d like to place the bookmark by using
one of the following methods:
• Select a folder from the Create In drop-down list. This list contains
the last five folders in which you filed a bookmark.
• If you don’t see the folder you want, or if you want to create a new
folder, click the button next to the Create In list (the down arrow,
as shown in Figure 5-1). The full list of folders appears. Select the
one you want to use or click the New Folder button at the bottom
to create a new folder. The folder is created within whichever
folder you selected.
By default, Firefox places all new bookmarks in the main Bookmarks
folder, so the new bookmarks appear alongside folders in the main list
and not within any particular subfolder.
5. Click OK to create the new bookmark.
The bookmark appears immediately on the Bookmarks menu and in the
Bookmarks Sidebar in the location that you chose in Step 4.
56
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

Creating multiple bookmarks at once
If you browse with tabs (see Chapter 7 for more information), you can book-
mark multiple open tabs at once into a single bookmarks folder. Later, you
can open each bookmark individually in the usual way — by opening the
folder and clicking it — or you can open all the bookmarks in the folder at
one time, as I discuss in “Opening multiple bookmarks at once,” later in this
chapter.
To bookmark your open tabs, follow these steps:
1. Open each page you want to bookmark in a separate tab within the
Firefox window.
2. Choose Bookmarks➪Bookmark All Tabs to open the Bookmark All
Tabs window.
3. Enter a folder name. Firefox creates a new folder to contain the 
bookmarks.
4. Choose a location for the new folder.
By default, Firefox creates the folder in your Bookmarks list alongside
regular bookmarks. However, you can also choose to create it inside
another folder (that is, you can make it a subfolder).
5. Click OK to create the new folder and bookmarks.
Creating a bookmark that auto-updates
Bookmarks are a great way to access your favorite Web sites quickly, but in
some ways, they’re a curse. You might find yourself visiting Web sites for
updates five or six times a day just because they’re so easy to access. Thanks

Chapter 5: Bookmarking Great Sites

to an emerging technology called Really Simple Syndication (RSS), Firefox can
bring the updates to you from any Web site that supports RSS. Bookmarks in
special folders can update automatically to show you new content, which
saves you time.
These so-called live bookmarks are based on the simple idea that a Web
site is really a type of folder. CNN.com, for example, is nothing more than
a collection — or folder — of various items, which in this case are news 
stories. Similarly, your friend’s blog (short for Web log, which is an online
journal or diary) is like a folder of journal entries.
You already know that you can organize your bookmarks into folders. But
you can also create live bookmark folders of any RSS-enabled Web site.
Firefox automatically fetches new items posted to the Web site — including
news stories, journal entries, and so on — and presents each new item to you
as a separate bookmark. You access these live folders the same way you do
all other folders. The only difference is that the bookmarks in the folder
change as the Web site it points to is updated with new content.
Firefox comes with a live bookmark folder by default so you can see how they
work. It’s called Latest Headlines, and it sits on your Bookmarks Toolbar. The
folder contains the latest news headlines straight from BBC News, an RSS-
enabled Web site.
To subscribe to additional Web sites in this fashion, follow these steps:
1. Visit the Web site for which you want to create a live bookmark.
If the Web site supports RSS, you see the orange-and-white subscribe
image to the right of the Location Bar, as shown in Figure 5-2. If this
image does not appear, the Web site doesn’t support RSS, and you can’t
create a live bookmark. Plenty of sites these days support RSS. For an
example, try www.cnn.com.
2. Click the subscribe image.
A menu appears containing the list of information sources, or feeds, that
the Web site offers.
For example, CNN allows you to subscribe to all recent stories or only
the top stories.
3. From the menu, choose the feed to which you want to subscribe.
In some cases, the available feeds have arcane names such as RSS 2.0
and Atom 2.0. These names refer to the varying subscription technolo-
gies that the Web site supports; the actual information carried by each
feed is the same, so you can choose either one without worrying about
the technical details.
After you choose from the menu, the standard Add Bookmark window
appears.
58
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

4. At this point, the process is the same as for all other bookmarks, so
follow the instructions I provide in the “Creating a bookmark” section
earlier in this chapter.
Note that what you’re actually creating here is a bookmark folder, not a
single bookmark, that will represent the Web site. Firefox automatically
fills the folder with new bookmarks as new items become available on
the Web site. Therefore, the name you supply in the Add Bookmark
window is actually the name of the folder that Firefox will create.
Opening a bookmark
You can access bookmarks in three ways: from the Bookmarks Toolbar that
sits just above the Web sites you visit, from the Bookmarks menu at the top
of the window, and from the Bookmarks Sidebar that can appear on the left
side of the screen. Each location offers different advantages depending on
how frequently you access a given bookmark and how conservative you are
with your screen’s real estate:
 The Bookmarks Toolbar is useful for fast access to the bookmarks you
visit most frequently. The bookmarks on the toolbar are always visible
and are always one click away. The toolbar occupies a thin horizontal
strip and can show six to ten bookmarks comfortably on a normal-sized
screen.
 The Bookmarks menu is useful if you don’t access bookmarks very
often and don’t want to waste screen space. If you have a lot of book-
marks, you’re better off using the Bookmarks Sidebar, which scrolls
more easily and has a search feature.
 The Bookmarks Sidebar is useful for people who have lots of book-
marks and need to access them frequently. It offers a quick-search fea-
ture and can be opened or closed quickly by pressing Ctrl+B (Windows)
or Ô+B (Macintosh).
I discuss each of these tools further in the following sections.

Chapter 5: Bookmarking Great Sites

The Bookmarks Toolbar
The Bookmarks Toolbar (shown in Figure 5-3) is designed for people who
visit a small set of Web sites so frequently that they want these Web sites to
be one click away at all times. You can put as many bookmarks onto the
Bookmarks Toolbar as you can fit, and if you run out of space, Firefox auto-
matically creates a menu at the end of the toolbar to offer access to the
remaining bookmarks, as illustrated in Figure 5-4. Click a bookmark to visit it.
The Bookmarks Toolbar can display about 6 to 10 bookmarks at a time. You
can make better use of the space by creating folders on the toolbar and
putting frequently accessed bookmarks inside those folders. To create a
folder on the Bookmarks Toolbar, simply right-click on empty space within it,
and then choose New Folder. When the New Folder window appears, enter a
name for the folder and click OK. To add bookmarks to a folder, simply drag
and drop them onto the folder.
You can also conserve space on the Bookmarks Toolbar by giving your book-
marks shorter names. To rename a bookmark, right-click it and choose
Properties. When the Properties window appears, enter a new name for the
bookmark and click OK.
The Bookmarks Toolbar includes two bookmarks by default: a Getting Started
bookmark that introduces you to Firefox, and a live bookmark folder that
contains the latest BBC News headlines (see “Creating a bookmark that auto-
updates,” earlier in this chapter).
If you don’t use the Bookmarks Toolbar and want to reclaim the space it uses,
you can hide the toolbar by choosing View➪Toolbars➪Bookmarks Toolbar.
The Bookmarks Toolbar

Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

So how do you get a bookmark onto the Bookmarks Toolbar? The toolbar
automatically displays any bookmarks you have placed in the special
Bookmarks Toolbar Folder. You can add bookmarks to this folder just as you
would to any other folder: by choosing it from the list in the Add Bookmark
window, as I describe in Step 4 in the earlier section, “Creating a bookmark.”
As soon as you add the bookmark to the folder, it appears on the toolbar.
There’s a faster way to add Web sites to the Bookmarks Toolbar. Visit any
Web site and look to the left of the Web site’s address in the Firefox Location
Bar. In most cases, you see the Location Bar icon. In some cases, you see a
special image representing the Web site you’re viewing (for example, when
you’re visiting CNN.com, you see the CNN logo). In either case, the image that
appears represents a link to the Web site you’re viewing. You can drag the
image into an e-mail to send a link to the page to your friend. In this case, it
also means you can drag the image down to the Bookmarks Toolbar to create
a bookmark to the page.

Chapter 5: Bookmarking Great Sites
The impersonal toolbar
The Bookmarks Toolbar seems so simple and
innocent — you’d hardly guess it was the cause
of many a shouting match at Netscape, the orig-
inal browser company. Because the toolbar is
prominent yet largely empty by default, it was an
appetizing target for Netscape marketers with
dollar signs on the brain. After all, why not fill the
bar with advertising links? Asking the Marketing
department to leave the toolbar alone was like
asking them to pass up a Super Bowl ad or leave
the side of a bus blank — it just wasn’t happen-
ing. Instead, the Netscape 6 browser shipped with
a bevy of advertising and other buttons that didn’t
behave like regular bookmarks and were difficult
to remove manually. Now for the ultimate irony —
the bar was known as the Personal Toolbar.
In Firefox, we drew a line in the sand early on
that the bar would be your bar and no one
else’s. The bar includes two bookmarks by
default: a Getting Started link and a live book-
mark that contains the latest BBC News head-
lines. The first helps you get comfortable with
Firefox, and the second introduces you to our
innovative Live Bookmarks technology (which I
discuss elsewhere in this chapter). Neither
makes us money, and you can remove them just
like any other bookmark — by right-clicking and
choosing Delete. We’ve also retired the tragi-
cally ironic Personal moniker and called it what
it is: your Bookmarks Toolbar.

Changing the bookmarks displayed on the toolbar
Firefox allows advanced users to change which folder’s bookmarks the
Bookmarks Toolbar displays. This can be handy if you have a lot of book-
marks and you’ve already organized them thoroughly into folders. For exam-
ple, suppose you have a folder called News Sites and you want the
bookmarks in this folder to be displayed on the Bookmarks Toolbar. You can
simply designate the News Sites folder as the folder to use for the Bookmarks
Toolbar:
1. Choose Bookmarks➪Manage Bookmarks to open the Bookmarks
Manager.
2. In the pane on the right, select the folder you want to designate as the
Bookmarks Toolbar folder.
3. Choose Edit➪Set as Bookmarks Toolbar Folder.
The Bookmarks Toolbar immediately updates to display this new
folder’s bookmarks.
Note that after you do this the first time, the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder
still has the same name, but it is just a regular folder now; its bookmarks
aren’t reflected in the toolbar. Be sure to rename this folder to avoid 
confusion.
Deleting bookmarks from the Bookmarks Toolbar
The Bookmarks Toolbar merely displays the contents of the Bookmarks
Toolbar Folder by default. Thus, to remove a bookmark from the toolbar, you
simply remove it from the folder as you would any other bookmark (see
“Deleting bookmarks and folders,” later in this chapter). You can also right-
click any bookmark on the toolbar and choose Delete.
Be aware that deleting a bookmark from the Bookmarks Toolbar also removes
the bookmark from the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder (or from whichever folder
you’ve assigned to the toolbar).
The Bookmarks menu
The Bookmarks menu (shown in Figure 5-5) is designed for people who use a
large number of bookmarks and access them relatively infrequently.
Accessing a bookmark is as simple as opening the Bookmarks menu, finding
the bookmark in the list or in a folder, and clicking it. Of course, the more
bookmarks you have, the longer the list gets — and the longer it takes to find
the one you’re looking for. If you run into this problem, organize your book-
marks into folders (see “Organizing Your Bookmarks,” later in this chapter),
or use the Bookmarks Sidebar, which scrolls more easily and offers a search
feature.
62
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

By default, the menu contains two folders: Quick Searches and Firefox and
Mozilla Links. The first is used in conjunction with the Search Keywords fea-
ture, which I discuss in Chapter 4 (see the section on searching from the
Location Bar) and should be ignored. The Firefox and Mozilla Links folder
contains a number of bookmarks to Firefox resources that will prove useful
as you get to know the browser’s ins and outs.
The Bookmarks Sidebar
The Bookmarks Sidebar (shown in Figure 5-6) is designed for those people
who have a large amount of bookmarks and need to access or organize them
frequently. The Sidebar is a thin panel that appears on the left hand side of
the screen, and it will stay open as you navigate from site to site. It contains a
search bar so you can find the bookmark you want more quickly.
You can also drag links into the Bookmarks Sidebar to bookmark them.
You can open the Sidebar in three ways:
 Choose View➪Sidebar➪Bookmarks.
 Press Ctrl+B (Windows) or Ô+B (Mac).
 Click the Bookmarks button on your toolbar. See Chapter 18 for instruc-
tions on how to add the Bookmarks button to your toolbar as well as
other information about customizing toolbars.

Chapter 5: Bookmarking Great Sites

To access a bookmark from the sidebar, simply locate and click it. If you can’t
find the bookmark you’re looking for, try the simple Search function at the
top of the sidebar. Enter a word or phrase that you believe to appear in the
name of the bookmark. As soon as you stop typing, even if you stop typing in
the middle of a word, Firefox searches your collection and displays any
matches, as shown in Figure 5-7.
You can also use the Bookmarks Sidebar for rudimentary bookmark organizing.
For example, you can drag and drop items to new locations or right-click them
to access their properties or delete them. For more information about book-
marks organization, see “Organizing Your Bookmarks,” later in this chapter.

Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

Opening multiple bookmarks at once
Unlike most other Web browsers, Firefox allows you to open all the book-
marks in a folder at once. Each bookmark loads in a separate tab (see
Chapter 7 for more information about tabs). This feature is most useful for
switching between two activities quickly.
For example, suppose you begin the day by reading the news on five different
news Web sites. You could quickly access all five sites by opening your news
folder in the Bookmarks menu and choosing Open in Tabs. Then, when it
comes time to begin work, you could instantly access all your work-related
resources by opening your work folder and choosing Open in Tabs. This
option always appears at the bottom of the folder’s bookmark list, as shown
in Figure 5-8. If you use the Bookmarks Sidebar or the Bookmarks Toolbar
rather than the menu, you can still access this feature by right-clicking the
folder and choosing Open in Tabs.
When you open multiple bookmarks at once in Firefox, Firefox loads the
bookmarks in any tabs you already have open, thus replacing the Web sites
you’re viewing. If you open more bookmarks than you have tabs open, Firefox
opens additional tabs.
Opening bookmarks with keywords
If you prefer using the keyboard over the mouse, be sure to assign brief key-
words to your bookmarks and use those keywords to access the bookmarks
from the Location Bar. For example, if you bookmark Blockbuster’s Web site,
you might assign the bookmark a keyword of bb. You could then type bb into
the Location Bar at any time to go instantly to www.blockbuster.com.

Here’s how you assign a keyword to a bookmark:
1. Right-click the bookmark to which you want to assign a keyword and
choose Properties.
The bookmark’s Properties window appears.
You can do this from the Bookmarks Sidebar, the Bookmarks Manager, or
the Bookmarks Toolbar. If you’re using Windows, you can also right-click
the bookmark in the Bookmarks menu.
2. In the Keyword text box, enter the keyword you want to use (for
example, bb).
3. Click OK to close the Properties window.
4. Try out your new keyword by typing it into the Firefox Location Bar
and then press Enter.
You can’t specify a keyword for a bookmark from the Add Bookmark

Using multiple bookmarks as your home pages
Instead of using a single home page, you can
have several home pages by setting Firefox to
open multiple bookmarks whenever you start
Firefox. The condition is that they all have to be in
the same folder. Here’s how you set up this option:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
The Options window appears.
2. Click the General icon at the top of the
window if it isn’t already selected.
3. Under Home Page, click the Use Bookmark
button.
The Set Home Page window appears.
4. Select the folder that contains the book-
marks you want Firefox to load on startup.
5. Click OK to close the Set Home Page
window.
6. Click OK to close the Options window.
The next time you open a Firefox window or
click the Home button on the main Firefox tool-
bar, the bookmarks in the selected folder open
in tabs.

Web page just to see the latest score of the basketball game? In Firefox, you
can choose to view any bookmark in a sidebar that appears next to — rather
than in place of — whichever site you’re viewing, as shown in Figure 5-9.
To open a bookmark in a sidebar, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the bookmark you want to open in a sidebar and choose
Properties.
The bookmark’s Properties window appears.
You can do this from the Bookmarks Sidebar, the Bookmarks Manager, or
the Bookmarks Toolbar. If you’re using Windows, you can also right-click
the bookmark in the Bookmarks menu.
2. Select the Load This Bookmark in the Sidebar check box.
3. Click OK to close the Properties window.
The next time you open the bookmark, it loads in the sidebar, as shown
in Figure 5-9 (using Amazon Search as an example).
This feature is especially useful if you put the bookmark on your Bookmarks
Toolbar, as I describe earlier in this chapter, in the section “The Bookmarks
Toolbar.” You can close the sidebar by clicking the X in the top-right corner
(of the sidebar, not of the Firefox window).

Opening bookmarks in new windows
or tabs
When you choose to open a bookmark, Firefox loads it in place of whichever
Web site you’re currently viewing. If you’d rather open a bookmark in addi-
tion to your current page, you can choose to open the bookmark in a new tab
or a new window. This is as easy as right-clicking the bookmark and choosing
Open in New Tab or Open in New Window from the menu that appears. You
can right click on a bookmark in the Bookmarks Manager, the Bookmarks
Toolbar or the Bookmarks Sidebar. If you’re using Windows, you can also
right-click a bookmark directly from the Bookmarks menu.
If your mouse has a middle button — or a scroll wheel that doubles as a
button — simply middle-click any bookmark to open it in a new tab.
Organizing Your Bookmarks
Anyone who uses a filing cabinet knows the grim reality of organization: It
doesn’t last long. Sure, that first week you’ve got your stack of brand new
manila folders and pens and you’re eager to file. But by the second week,

The slimmer, trimmer trend
When you try opening sites in the sidebar, you
might notice that as convenient as it is, many
Web sites simply don’t fit in such a small box.
Firefox displays vertical and/or horizontal scroll-
bars to help alleviate this problem. However,
this feature works best when you find Web sites
that are designed to fit in small spaces. Many
Web sites link to versions of their content that
are specially designed for cell phones; these
pages tend to work very well in the Firefox 
sidebar as well. Better still, many companies
provide Web sites specifically tailored to fit
inside browser sidebars and offer easy installa-
tion of these pages.
For example, CNN offers a slender list of the
latest headlines. Opera Browser’s Web site
(http://my.opera.com/community/
customize/panel) includes a directory of
sidebars. When you select a sidebar to install
from the directory, Firefox automatically opens
the Add Bookmark window. The bookmark that
is added is just like any other bookmark, except
it is configured to load in the sidebar by default.

you’re starting to stick papers in the wrong folders just to get them out of
your sight. By the time a month has passed, the stack of junk on your desk is
now a stack of junk in an oversized Miscellaneous folder.
As I discuss earlier, in the “Creating a Bookmark” section, Firefox makes it
easy to organize your bookmarks by helping you file them into folders from
the start. However, it also offers a sophisticated manager so you can go back
and organize your collection at any time. To access this tool, open the
Bookmarks menu and choose Manage Bookmarks.
The Bookmarks Manager, shown in Figure 5-10, is divided into two panes. The
left pane contains a list of folders, and the right pane contains the items in
whichever folder you’ve selected. By default, the Bookmarks folder — which
contains all your bookmarks and folders — is selected.
The Bookmarks Manager offers one-click access to all the organizational
capabilities you need. Note that you can perform many of the actions that I
discuss in the following sections, such as deletion and movement, on multi-
ple bookmarks and folders at one time. For example, you can select multiple
bookmarks and then drag them all into a folder. To select multiple items,
Ctrl+click (Windows) or Ô+click (Mac) them.

Chapter 5: Bookmarking Great Sites

Creating bookmark folders
Firefox helps you file a bookmark into a folder at the moment you create the
bookmark. This is the best way to stay organized, but you might not see the
need for a folder until you’ve accumulated a group of related bookmarks over
time. Therefore, Firefox lets you create bookmark folders at any time, and
then you can move existing bookmarks into them.
To create a bookmarks folder, follow these steps:
1. Choose Bookmarks➪Manage Bookmarks to open the Bookmarks
Manager.
2. Click the New Folder button on the toolbar at the top of the window.
The New Folder window appears.
3. Enter a name for the new folder.
You can also enter a description that will be displayed alongside the
folder in the Bookmarks Manager, as I discuss in “Describing bookmarks
and folders,” later in this chapter.
4. Click OK to create the new folder.
To move existing bookmarks into the new folder, simply drag and drop them
onto the new folder, as I discuss in “Moving bookmarks and folders,” later in
this section.
Renaming bookmarks and folders
To rename a bookmark or folder, follow these steps:
1. Choose Bookmarks➪Manage Bookmarks to open the Bookmarks
Manager.
2. Select the bookmark or folder you want to rename.
3. Click the Rename button on the toolbar at the top of the window.
Alternatively, you can right-click the bookmark and choose
Properties.
The bookmark’s Properties window appears.
4. Type the new name you want to use in the Name text box.
5. Click OK.

Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

Deleting bookmarks and folders
When it comes time to clean house, Firefox makes it easy to delete those old
and unused bookmarks. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Bookmarks➪Manage Bookmarks to open the Bookmarks
Manager.
2. Select the bookmark(s) or folder(s) you want to delete.
Hold down the Ctrl key (Windows) or the Ô key (Mac) to select multiple
bookmarks.
3. Click the Delete button on the toolbar at the top of the window or
press Delete on your keyboard.
If the item you have selected is a folder, all the bookmarks it contains are
deleted.
Firefox won’t ask you to confirm your decision to delete. However, if you
change your mind after doing so, you can undo the action by choosing
Edit➪Undo. After you shut down Firefox, you cannot undo your changes.
The Quick Searches folder that comes with Firefox holds your Search
Keywords. See the section in Chapter 4 about searching from the Location
Bar for information about quick searches using Search Keywords.
Moving bookmarks and folders
Moving bookmarks in the Bookmarks Manager is easy. Simply drag the book-
marks you want to move to the desired location. You can select multiple
bookmarks by holding down the Ctrl key (Windows) or the Ô key (Mac) as
you click them.
You can also use the standard cut-and-paste method of movement. To cut
bookmarks or folders, simply select them and choose Edit➪Cut or press
Ctrl+X (Windows) or Ô+X (Mac). To paste them elsewhere, select the new des-
tination and choose Edit➪Paste, or press Ctrl+V (Windows) or Ô+V (Mac).
Sorting bookmarks
By default, Firefox displays your bookmarks in the order you added them.
Your most recently added bookmarks are at the bottom of the list, and the
bookmarks you created longest ago are at the top. However, you can instruct
71
Chapter 5: Bookmarking Great Sites

Firefox to sort your bookmarks alphabetically at any time. Simply right-click
a bookmark in the Bookmarks Toolbar, Sidebar, or (in Windows) menu and
choose Sort by Name. It doesn’t matter which one you right-click because
Firefox maintains a single bookmarks list across all three interfaces, and thus
your bookmarks will be sorted alphabetically in all of them.
Note that if you sort by right-clicking one of the bookmarks in the main book-
marks list, Firefox sorts only the main bookmarks list. It does not sort book-
marks within folders; those will continue to be in chronological order. To sort
the bookmarks within a particular folder, right-click the folder and choose
Sort by Name.
This kind of sorting is useful if it’s easier for you to find and access book-
marks that are sorted alphabetically. However, if you want to sort your book-
marks temporarily for the purpose of managing and organizing them more
easily, the Bookmarks Manager offers a variety of sorting options, such as
sorting by last visited date or by location. These options are available from
the View menu in the Bookmarks Manager and do not affect the Bookmarks
Toolbar, Sidebar, or menu.
Describing bookmarks and folders
You can give bookmarks and folders brief descriptions that can serve as
reminders to you later on about why you bookmarked a particular page or
what a particular folder contains. Descriptions appear in the Description
column of the Bookmarks Manager, and you can also view them in the
Properties window (right-click the bookmark or folder and choose Properties).
Follow these steps to enter a description:
1. Choose Bookmarks➪Manage Bookmarks to open the Bookmarks
Manager.
2. Select the bookmark or folder you want to describe.
3. Right-click the bookmark or folder and choose Properties, or click
Properties in the toolbar at the top of the window.
The bookmark’s Properties window appears.
4. Enter the description in the Description text box.
5. Click OK.

Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

Creating separators
Separators are horizontal lines used to divide related bookmarks and folders
into groups. For example, if you have a group of sports-related bookmarks
and a group of recipe bookmarks, you could use separators to differentiate
the groups visually in the Bookmarks menu, Sidebar, and Toolbar.
Here’s how you make separators:
1. Choose Bookmarks➪Manage Bookmarks.
2. Select the bookmark or folder above which you want to create a 
separator.
3. Click the Separator button on the toolbar at the top of the window.
You can give separators names that will appear in the Bookmarks Manager
and in the Bookmarks Sidebar (although they don’t appear in the Bookmarks
menu). Simply select the separator, click the Rename button on the toolbar at
the top of the window, then enter the name and click OK.
Importing and Exporting Bookmarks
Can you imagine if you had to start all over again each time you bought a new
filing cabinet? You’d have to start filing your hair away because you’d be tear-
ing it out by the handful. Luckily, Firefox provides an easy Import Wizard that
migrates your bookmarks from your former browser. You can import your
bookmarks when you first launch Firefox or at any time thereafter. Firefox
stores the bookmarks in one of two locations depending on when you import
them, as I discuss in the following sections.
Firefox also allows you to export your bookmarks to a file on your computer
for use in other browsers or for your own personal backup.
Importing on your first launch
When you launch Firefox for the first time, the Import Wizard opens. If you
choose to import bookmarks at this point, Firefox imports the bookmarks
directly into your bookmarks list. In other words, when you open your
Bookmarks menu, you see all your existing bookmarks just as they were in
your previous browser.
73
Chapter 5: Bookmarking Great Sites

Chapter 3 provides instructions for importing bookmarks and other data the
first time you start Firefox.
Importing after the initial launch
Importing favorites works fine if you’re launching Firefox for the first time,
but what happens if you have used it for a couple of months — and built up a
new bookmarks collection — before deciding to import? In this case, rather
than mixing your old bookmarks with your new collection, Firefox places all
your old bookmarks in a new folder named From Previous Browser. For exam-
ple, if you’re importing Internet Explorer Favorites, the folder is called From
Internet Explorer. The imported bookmarks are still organized into the same
folders (if any) as they were in your previous browser, but they will be con-
tained entirely within this new folder.
1. Choose Bookmarks➪Manage Bookmarks.
2. In the Bookmarks Manager, choose File➪Import.
3. To import from another browser, select the name of the browser.
Firefox supports importing bookmarks from Internet Explorer, Apple
Safari, Opera, Netscape 4.0 through 8.0, Camino, iCab, earlier versions of
Firefox, and OmniWeb. Only the browsers that are installed on your com-
puter are displayed.
4. Click Next to import the bookmarks and then click Finish to close the
wizard.
Firefox allows you to import bookmarks from a file located on your computer.
The file must be in the Firefox bookmarks/HTML format. Choose From File, in
the Import Wizard, click Next, and then locate the file that contains the book-
marks you want to import.
Exporting bookmarks
If you need to get bookmarks out of Firefox instead of into it, Firefox can help
you with that, too. Firefox can export your bookmarks — that is, store them
in standard HTML format on your computer — for backup purposes or so
that other browsers are able to retrieve them. This feature is generally useful
only for advanced users. Here’s how:
1. Choose Bookmarks➪Manage Bookmarks.
2. In the Bookmarks Manager, choose File➪Export.
74
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

3. Navigate to the directory in which you would like to store the
exported bookmarks and enter the name of the file to create, and
then press Enter.
By default, Firefox uses the filename bookmarks.html.
Now that your bookmarks exist in an HTML file on your computer, you can
import them into any browser that understands the HTML bookmarks
format. If you’re using the file as a backup, you can import your bookmarks
back into Firefox later by using the Import Wizard, as I discuss at the end of
the preceding section.

Chapter 5: Bookmarking Great Sites
Experimenting with social bookmarks
A new phenomenon is taking the Internet world
by storm — the concept of social bookmarking.
The pioneers behind social bookmarking argue
that if people will just share their bookmarks
with the world, everyone can enjoy a book-
marking experience that is exponentially better
than the one that exists now. Why is that?
By aggregating millions of individual bookmark
collections, computer algorithms can begin to
identify trends that would otherwise be difficult
to chart. For example, computers could notice
that a certain Web site has been bookmarked
by 500,000 people. Because people tend to
bookmark pages that they find interesting or
informative, you could reasonable conclude
that this Web site is extremely interesting or
informative. You can publish a list of such Web
sites, but more importantly, you can incorporate
this knowledge into search engines and use it
to bump these Web sites higher in the rankings.
Think of it as the world’s bookmarks.
In many cases, social bookmarking algorithms
confirm what is already known from Web sites
statistics about the top Internet destinations.
Sites like CNN and Yahoo! rule the Web (no sur-
prises there). Where social bookmarking really
starts to get interesting is when it exposes dia-
monds in the rough — valuable Web sites that
are being passed around fervently on small
word-of-mouth networks but aren’t yet known
to the world at large. Social bookmarking can
find local stars — Web sites that are circulat-
ing among certain communities — and turn
them into worldwide hits overnight.
One of the earliest and most popular social
bookmarking sites to arise was http://
del.icio.us
(think delicious). Using
Delicious is about as easy as using the built-in
Firefox bookmarking feature. The difference is
that instead of accessing your bookmarks
through Firefox, you access your bookmarks
through your personal page on the Delicious
Web site. By using Delicious, you contribute to
the social body of knowledge. Other people can
see what you found interesting on the Web, and
better yet, you can find new and interesting
Web sites you’ve never seen before. Delicious
has clear, step-by-step instructions for getting
started.
One additional benefit of social bookmarking is
that you can also access your bookmarks from
any computer around the world. The downside,
of course, is that your bookmarks are publicly
viewable by anyone. But although some people
consider this a privacy violation, others find it a
valuable way to leverage the expertise of
others. You probably know of people who are
experts in their field, whether it’s computers,
knitting, or biology. When you’re looking for
information about their subjects of expertise,
wouldn’t it be great if you could “get inside their
minds” and know what they find important?

 Navigating backward and forward through Firefox’s history
 Revisiting pages
 Changing how much history Firefox remembers
H
ave you ever had one of those dreams that hops from one scene to
another without any logic to fill the gaps? You know the type. One
minute you’re eating breakfast, the next minute you’re a flying coconut, the
next minute you’re breakfast and the flying coconut is eating you.
Sometimes surfing the Web feels the same way. One minute you’re reading
ESPN, and the next minute you’re shopping for pants. The Internet is a
random patchwork of information loosely joined by hyperlinks. If you’re not
careful, it’s easy to get lost.
But Firefox is there for you. Its powerful yet simple history controls track
your every move and allow you to swiftly return to any spot in your journey.
You decide how much history Firefox remembers and when to empty out
the history.
In real life, you have two kinds of memory: short-term and long-term. (Or per-
haps you don’t — where are those keys?) Firefox’s memory works the same way.
Your short-term history on the Web consists of the last ten Web sites you visited
in the current browsing session, and your long-term history consists of all the
sites you visited in the past nine days — or however many days you choose.
And, yes, those jeans look great on you — now get back to the sports page!
Navigating Short-Term History
If you’ve used the Web for any amount of time, you’re already intimately
familiar with navigating short-term history in Firefox. You know how to go
back to the page you looked at previously (click the Back button), and you
know how to go forward again (click the Forward button). Through deductive
reasoning, you’ve probably also figured out how to go back and forward more

than one page: Just click each respective button repeatedly until you get to
the page you want.
If you prefer the keyboard, you can press Alt+←and Alt+→in Windows (or
Ô+[ and Ô+] on a Mac) to go backwards and forwards, respectively.
But Firefox exists to rid your life of every last extraneous click, especially
with something as common as going back and forth. Seconds here and there
quickly add up to hours every month. Firefox thus offers two additional ways
to jump immediately back to a page you visited recently. I explain each way in
the following sections.
Going back and forth with the 
Back and Forward menus
The first method of navigating short-term history is to use the menus
attached to the Back and Forward buttons:
1. Right-click the Back or Forward button, depending on the direction in
which you want to navigate.
Rather than right-clicking, you can instead click the arrows next to the
Back and Forward buttons.
The button must be lit up (not grayed out) for you to use it. Figure 6-1
illustrates the difference between a lit up button and a grayed out
button. After clicking, a menu appears, and it contains up to the last ten
Web sites you visited in the current browser window (see Figure 6-2).
Note, however, that after you go back ten pages, you can then go back
another ten. In other words, the menu displays only the last ten Web
sites at a time so it’s not overwhelming, but Firefox stores dozens of
pages in your short-term history.
If you’re using tabbed browsing (see Chapter 7), the menu contains only
those Web sites you visited in the current tab. In other words, short-term
history is tied to individual tabs if you’re using them; otherwise, it is tied
to individual windows.
2. Choose the Web site you want to revisit from the history menu.
Navigating history more quickly
with the Go menu
The second method of navigating short-term history is to use the Go menu
at the top of every Firefox window. Like the Back and Forward menus, the
Go menu offers quick access to the last ten Web sites you visited. But unlike
78
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

the Back and Forward menus, the Go menu isn’t tied to any particular tab or
window, and it remembers your recently visited sites even if you restart
Firefox. In that sense, it’s more like “medium-term” history.
An example should illustrate that this is less confusing than it sounds. Open
a new Firefox window and navigate to CNN.com, then to ESPN.com, and then
to Google.com. Right-clicking the Back button offers quick access back to
ESPN.com.
Now open a new Firefox window. You can see that the Back button is no
longer lit up; that’s because you haven’t visited any Web sites in this particu-
lar window yet, so you have no Web sites to go back to. Even so, when you
open the Go menu in this new window, you see CNN, ESPN, and Google near
the top of the Go menu.
Unlike the Back and Forward menus, the Go menu abides by the history set-
ting with respect to how many days’ worth of history to remember. (I discuss
this setting at length in “Extending, shortening, or disabling long-term his-
tory,” later in this chapter.)
In other words, the Go menu is a great tool when you know you visited a Web
site recently but you aren’t sure if it was in this window or that window, this
tab or that one, or even today or yesterday.

Delving into Long-Term History
Many browser designers seem to think that because short-term history is the
one you’ll be accessing most frequently, it’s okay to turn long-term history
into the abandoned, dusty wing in the library basement — you can trek down
there every so often and get what you need, but it won’t be easy. The prob-
lem with this approach is that it’s ridiculously simple to access the last 10
pages you visited but nigh impossible to get to that 11th.
Firefox puts your long-term history at your fingertips so you can quickly
return to that elusive page you found last week. By default, every Web site
you visited in the past nine days is stored; to change this setting, see the
later section “Extending, shortening, or disabling long-term history.” You
access long-term history from the History Sidebar (shown in Figure 6-3),
which you can open by choosing Go➪History or by pressing Ctrl+H (Windows)
or Ô+Shift+H (Mac). The History Sidebar offers two means of finding the page
you’re looking for: browsing through a list or, if you remember part of the
page title, searching for it.

Browsing long-term history
The History Sidebar uses the familiar concept of folders to organize your his-
tory and allows you to switch among five views via the View button next to
the Search text box:
 Date and Site (default): Web sites are organized into folders, first by the
date you visited them (for example, Yesterday or 4 days ago) and then
alphabetically by the site addresses themselves (for example, www.
cnn.com).
 Site: Web sites are organized into one long, alphabetical list by site title.
Folders are not used.
 Date: Web sites are organized into alphabetical lists by site title and
grouped into folders by the date you visited them. See Figure 6-4.
 Most Visited: Web sites are organized into one long list ordered by how
frequently you visited them, with the most frequented page appearing at
the top of the list. Folders are not used.
 Last Visited: Web sites are organized into one long list ordered by when
you last visited them, with the most recently visited page appearing at
the top of the list. Folders are not used. See Figure 6-5.

Chapter 6: Returning to Sites You’ve Visited

It takes just one click to open a folder in the History Sidebar, although
double-clicking will work as well. Likewise, to access a Web site from the
History Sidebar, simply click it once.
Searching long-term history
If you remember a word or phrase that appears in the title of the Web site
you want to revisit, you don’t have to spend time browsing. Simply start
typing in the Search text box at the top of the History Sidebar. As soon as you
stop typing (or press Enter), Firefox searches long-term history and displays
any matches — even if you are in the middle of a word, as demonstrated in
Figure 6-6. (Searches are not case-sensitive, which means that firefox is con-
sidered equivalent to FireFox.)

Cleaning up long-term history
As convenient as it is to have computers remember things, it can also be
unsettling to have your memories on display. After all, no matter how many
times that darn brain forgets something important, it’s still a pretty safe bet
that anything you store in there is known to you and only you. However,
anyone with physical access to your computer and (if you have one) to your
computer login screen can view your long-term history. And the issues go
beyond privacy: The larger your history gets, the more hard drive space
Firefox requires.
To clear short-term history, you simply close the tab or window you were
using to browse. Luckily, clearing long-term history is about as easy. You can
delete specific records or clear the whole shebang.
Deleting individual entries from long-term history
Removing specific records from long-term history is easy:
1. Choose Go➪History to open the History Sidebar.
2. Right-click the record you want to delete and choose Delete from the
contextual menu that appears. If you’re using a view that organizes
Web sites into folders, you can also right-click a folder and choose
Delete to delete the folder and everything within it, as illustrated in
Figure 6-7.

Chapter 6: Returning to Sites You’ve Visited

Deleting from history is not a reversible process; the Undo command won’t
be available after you follow these steps. However, note that deleting a record
from history deletes only that particular entry. If you later visit that same
Web site, it again appears in your long-term history.
Clearing the entire long-term history
Firefox offers two ways to clear long-term history entirely. The fastest way 
is to
1. Choose Tools➪Clear Private Data.
2. In the window that appears, ensure that nothing but Browsing History
is selected (see Figure 6-8).
If the Browsing History check box is grayed out, long-term history is
already empty, and you don’t need to clear it again.
3. Click the Clear Private Data Now button.

ing habits.

84
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

The Clear Private Data window offers quick access to clearing any types of
information that Firefox remembers (see Chapter 14 for more information).
Clearing long-term history directly from the Options window
If you only ever use the Clear Private Data window to clear history, that
method is the fastest way to do it. However, if you use it to clear a certain
combination of information frequently — such as history, cookies, and saved
form information — you might find it frustrating to have to continually
change which check boxes are selected. In that case, Firefox allows you to
bypass the Clear Private Data window altogether and clear browsing history
directly:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Select the Privacy icon at the top of the window.
3. Select the History option.
4. Click the Clear Browsing History Now button to clear the long-term
history.
If this button is grayed out, long-term history is already empty, and you
don’t need to clear it again.
Clearing long-term history is not a reversible action; the Undo command
won’t be available after you complete this step. Furthermore, Firefox
clears your history as soon as you click this button — without confirma-
tion and without waiting for you to click OK in the main Options window.
5. Click OK to close the Options window.
Extending, shortening, or disabling 
long-term history
By default, Firefox remembers all the Web sites you visited in the last nine
days. You can extend or shorten this length of time or turn off long-term his-
tory altogether so that Firefox no longer remembers any Web sites you visit:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Select the Privacy icon at the top of the window.
3. Select the History option.
85
Chapter 6: Returning to Sites You’ve Visited

4. In the text box, enter the number of days for which Firefox should
remember your history.
You can enter as many or as few days as you want. To disable long-term
history entirely, enter 0.
If you disable long-term history, Firefox won’t remember the Web sites
you visit in the future, but any long-term history it has already accumu-
lated will remain. See the earlier section, “Cleaning up long-term his-
tory,” for instructions on clearing existing history.

Is history an ancient concept?
The concept of history is one of the staples of
the Internet. The very first browser ever
released included Back and Forward buttons,
and no browser since then has strayed too far
from this iconic model. But many people are
starting to do away with history altogether —
how do they do this?
People first began to entertain the extinction of
history with the advent of Google in the last five
years. Before Google revolutionized the search
industry, high-quality Web sites were rare and
precious finds. If you came across one, you had
to guard its location carefully — because the
odds of your stumbling across it again, with bil-
lions of Web sites and poor search technology,
were slim. Thus, long-term history became a
critical part of the browsing experience. Paper
notes with Web addresses scrawled illegibly
were gradually replaced with automatic
memory courtesy of the browser.
Google commoditized relevant content. You
probably take it for granted today that you can
enter a search term and find what you’re looking
for in under a second. If Google can’t find any-
thing relevant to what you’re searching for, you
no longer assume it’s a shortcoming of the tech-
nology; instead, you might generally conclude
that the answer just isn’t on the Internet yet.
As a side effect of this new world, you no longer
have to worry that the cream of the crop will slip
away from you. Why crawl through long-term
history when you could just search Google
again for the same (or similar) words? Not only
is searching Google often the fastest option, but
Google is also much more forgiving. If you can’t
remember exactly what appeared in the title of
the page you’re looking for, you’re out of luck in
all Web browsers. But if you can tell Google so
much as a synonym or a general description, it
can hone in on what you want.
The only problem with this approach — as
some of its proponents are discovering, much
to their frustration — is that Google changes its
search technology from time to time. In general,
such changes benefit users because the
changes improve the accuracy, relevance, and
ordering of the search results. But when you’re
relying on a certain set of results, it can be quite
vexing to discover that, for example, “the first
term on the second page of search results” is
no longer what you thought it was.
These kinds of issues make history invaluable
for now. But one day, history might be history.

abbed browsing is the feature for people tired of playing Whack-a-Mole
on the Web. You know how it goes: You’re halfway through a 5-hour surf-
ing extravaganza and fast approaching 2 × 106 open Web sites, each in its own
window. Suddenly, the buttons in your Windows taskbar are approaching
atomic size. The Wally’s Fish World button now reads “Wa . . . ”; Sports
Illustrated becomes “Spo . . . ”; and CNN is just “ . . . ”. Switching back to the
Web site you want becomes a guessing game. The taskbar itself is scrolling,
which you didn’t even know was possible!
Firefox has made that a thing of the past. This chapter shows how to take
advantage of a revolutionary new way to browse the Web. It’s called tabbed
browsing, and it eliminates desktop clutter by allowing you to group all of
your Web sites into a single window. Each Web site displays as a tab in a strip
along the top of the browser’s viewing area. Now you never have to close a
Web site just to make room for more. Choosing between Wally’s Fish World
and CNN is a decision nobody should have to make.
Getting Started with Tabs
When you open multiple documents on your computer, you’re probably
accustomed to working with each document in a separate window. To switch
between two windows, you click the button that represents the appropriate
document on the Windows taskbar at the bottom of your screen. This
method is similar to how things work in real life: You can lay multiple pieces
of paper across your desk and focus your attention on any of them.

Most Web browsers follow this model, and Firefox can, too. But Firefox takes
the perspective that Web sites are different from documents. When you
open a document, you generally intend to spend a fair amount of time work-
ing on it. When you open a Web site, you might spend as little as 30 seconds
reading it. And because Web sites take time to load, many people prefer to
open multiple pages at once so they have more to read while other pages are
loading.
Firefox offers tabbed browsing for users who maintain this kind of frantic and
frenzied pace on the Web. Instead of being contained within a separate window
as documents are, Web sites can be opened in tabs that appear along a tab
strip along the top of the window, as shown in Figure 7-1.
Thus, instead of behaving like separate papers on your desk, each window
(group of tabs) is essentially a folder containing multiple items. You can
view all your Web sites in the same window or you can maintain multiple
“folders” for keeping track of different types of Web sites. For example, 
a journalist might choose to have one window that houses all her research
Web sites and another window that houses all her entertainment Web sites.
Click a tab here to access a site.

Some of the benefits of the tabbed approach are obvious. Your Windows
taskbar is no longer cluttered with dozens of Web pages, each in its own
window. Tabs open much more quickly than new windows. And unlike win-
dows, they also open in the background, which means the tab you’re cur-
rently looking at remains at the forefront. As you come across interesting
links on the Web page you’re reading, you can open them in new tabs for later
viewing without getting distracted and losing your place.
Other benefits are more subtle and start to emerge only after you get
immersed in the new rhythm of tabbed surfing. So, it’s time to begin!
Opening a new site in a new tab
When you enter an address into the Location Bar at the top of the window
and press Enter, the new Web page loads in place of the one you were previ-
ously looking at. If you want to keep the current Web page open and load a
new Web page simultaneously, you can load the new Web page in a tab that
appears next to the old Web page in the tab strip at the top of the window.
Choose File➪New Tab, and then enter the address of the page you want to
visit into the Location Bar. It’s that easy.
You can use the Ctrl+T shortcut in Windows (Ô+T on a Mac) to open a new,
blank tab quickly. You can also open a site in a new tab by typing its address
into the Location Bar and pressing Alt+Enter (Windows) or Option+Return
(Mac). Or, if the tab strip is visible, you can double-click on any of its empty
space (in other words, not on a tab) to open a new, blank tab. After the tab is
open and selected, enter an address into the Location Bar to load a Web page
in the tab.
Opening a linked site in a new tab
One of the biggest advantages of tabbed browsing is that it allows you to
open linked Web pages in new tabs for later viewing without losing your spot
on the Web page you’re reading. For example, say you’re reading a news arti-
cle about allergy season that cross-references (with a link) a story about a
major new medication. To read this story without tabbed browsing, you have
two choices: You can click the link when you encounter it, read the new
story, and then return to the original story. Or you can open the link in a new
window, wait for the new window to load, and then switch back to the origi-
nal window. Neither option is ideal because each steals your focus away from
the original story. With tabbed browsing, you can choose to open the linked
story in a background tab that never obscures the original story.
89
Chapter 7: Browsing with Tabs

To open a linked Web page in a new tab, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the link you want to open in a new tab.
2. Choose Open Link in New Tab from the menu that appears.
The linked page appears in a new tab at the end of the tab strip. A small
image animates to the left of the page title until the page finishes load-
ing, as shown in Figure 7-2. The current page remains the visible page, so
you can continue reading without interruption.
3. When you’re ready to view the new Web site, simply click the tab.
Opening links in new tabs can be a one-step process. If you have a middle
mouse button, just middle-click the link you want to open. You can also
middle-click a tab itself to close the Web site. Although most mice don’t have
traditional middle buttons, they typically offer a scroll wheel between the left
and right buttons that doubles as a middle button when you press it. If your
mouse doesn’t have a middle button, you can hold Ctrl (or Ô on the Mac)
while left-clicking a link to open it in a new tab.

The ability to open linked Web pages in new tabs is perhaps most handy when
you need to open a large number of links, such as when you’re comparison
shopping online or when you’re navigating search results. For example, sup-
pose you search Google for an analysis of Hamlet. In the prehistoric days
before tabbed browsing, you’d probably click the first result and, if the result-
ing page wasn’t what you wanted, go back and click the second result. Then
you’d rinse and repeat until you found what you were looking for.
With tabbed browsing, you can open all the pages you find intriguing, each in
its own tab, and keep the source page open in its original tab. Even if you
open multiple pages in rapid succession, Firefox immediately gets to work on
loading them simultaneously while you keep reading. By the time you’re
ready to look at the new tabs, they should be ready and waiting for you.
Navigating among Web sites in tabs
One important difference between windows and tabs is that each window
gets its own toolbars, whereas tabs must share the same set. For example,
the address in the Location Bar reflects the address of the current tab.
Navigation can be a little confusing at first. Firefox remembers the history of
where you’ve been on the Web and allows you to go back and forth by using the
Back and Forward buttons in the toolbar. The important thing here to remem-
ber is that Firefox remembers your history for each tab that you’re using.
Consider the case where you have two tabs open, both displaying Google. If
you switch to the second tab and load Yahoo!, you can click Back to return to
Google. However, if you were to switch to the first tab, you would notice that
you can’t click Back, even though it’s the same button you could click a
moment ago. Firefox remembers your tracks in each tab but still allows the
tabs to share the same button.
Rearranging tabs
When you open a new tab, Firefox positions the new tab to the right of all
your existing tabs. However, you might often find that you want to group
related tabs together to switch between them quickly. Changing a tab’s posi-
tion in Firefox is as simple as dragging the tab to a new location on the tab
bar. As you drag the tab along the bar, a purple arrow indicates the new posi-
tion of the tab should you decide to drop it there. (Figure 7-3, which appears
later in this chapter, shows you the arrow.)
91
Chapter 7: Browsing with Tabs

Closing tabs
What, closing tabs already? Has the magical journey ended? ’Fraid so. But
this is why millions of people have fallen in love with tabbed browsing: It’s so
simple to understand, and yet it makes surfing the Web much more enjoyable.
Closing tabs is as easy as opening them, which is actually more important
than it sounds — after all, tabbed browsing is about reducing clutter, and
nothing leads to more clutter than your own unwillingness to do something
about it. Isn’t that why your garage is so messy?
Fortunately, cleaning up tabs is easier than cleaning your garage. First, click
the tab that contains the Web site you want to close and then click the X
button at the far-right end of the tab strip. You can also right-click the tab and
choose Close Tab from the menu that appears.
If your mouse has a middle mouse button (or a scroll wheel that acts as a
button), you can middle-click a tab to close it quickly.
When you close the currently selected tab, Firefox automatically selects the
tab to its immediate left. If you don’t like this behavior, you can install an
extension called LastTab that instead selects the tab you used most recently.
(See Chapter 20 for more information about installing and using extensions.)
Super Tabbing: Advanced Tips and Tricks
Okay, so you can open and close tabs in the blink of an eye. You fly through
Google search results like it’s your job. Don’t get too cocky yet; the following
sections show you how to truly exploit the power of tabbed browsing.
Tweaking tabs
Creating tabbed browsing was difficult for Firefox developers because we had
to cater to two kinds of users: those who felt more comfortable with the
normal way to surf and those who fell in love with tabs. We had to make
some compromises and hide some tab features to ensure that we didn’t over-
whelm people with a radically new experience. But have no fear! If you’re a
tab junkie, you can tweak the behavior to your heart’s content.
92
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

Navigate your way to the tabs options by choosing Tools➪Options. Select the
Tabs icon at the top of the Options window. You see the following options,
which allow you to specify how Firefox handles tabs:
 Open links from other applications in: When other programs on your
computer need to display Web sites, they launch Firefox. By default,
Firefox loads these Web sites in a new tab within the Firefox window you
used most recently. Here you can specify that these Web sites should
instead open in a new window or in the most recent tab or window you
used (thus navigating away from whatever Web site is displayed in that
tab or window).
 Force links that open new windows to open in: Usually, when you click
a link on a Web site, the linked page replaces the Web site you’re view-
ing. However, a Web site owner can specify that a linked page must
instead open in a new window. This setting allows you to override this
behavior and open the link in a new tab or in the current tab or window
(like a normal link).
 Hide the tab bar when only one Web site is open: By default, Firefox
doesn’t show the tab strip if you have only one Web site open because
there are no tabs to switch between and it’s a waste of space. Turn off
this setting to keep the tab strip open permanently. You might want to
do so if the flicker of the tab strip showing and hiding bothers you.
Having the tab strip open is also handy because double-clicking any of
its empty space (that is, anywhere but on a tab) opens a new, blank tab.
 Select new tabs opened from links: In the first section of this chapter,
we looked at how to open linked Web sites in new tabs and noted that
Firefox would open them silently without shifting your attention from
your current Web site. This setting allows you to change this behavior
so that Firefox automatically focuses on the new tab.
 Warn when closing multiple tabs: By default, Firefox warns you when-
ever you close a window that is displaying multiple Web sites in tabs.
This setting lets you turn off that warning, but be careful when closing
windows!
 Extend tabbed browsing: We’ve tried to deliver the best possible tabbed
browsing experience out of the box, but remember that with Firefox’s
extensions mechanism (see Chapter 20), you don’t have to settle. The
official Firefox extensions site (http://addons.mozilla.org) con-
tains an entire category of tabbed browsing extensions to customize the
experience. One of my favorites is SessionSaver, which automatically
remembers which tabs you have open when you close Firefox and
reopens them the next time you start Firefox. Even if Firefox crashes,
your tabs are restored.
93
Chapter 7: Browsing with Tabs

There’s no place like home pages
If you’re like most other Web users, you probably begin your online journey
at the same place every day. This is called your home page. Most browsers
allow you to have only one home page, but this is like forcing you to choose
just one section of the paper to read every morning. Firefox bucks the trend
by allowing you to have as many different home pages as you want, each of
which opens in its own tab — naturally — whenever you start the browser.
However, Firefox can’t fix your soggy cereal.
You can set multiple home pages in three different ways. I discuss each in the
following sections.
Setting multiple home pages by entering addresses manually
If you know the addresses of the Web sites you want to set as your home
pages, you can specify them manually. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. In the Options window, select the General icon at the top if it isn’t
already selected.
3. Enter the addresses of the Web sites you would like to use as your
home pages. Separate each address with a | character.
For example, to use both CNN and Google as your home pages, enter
http://www.cnn.com|http://www.google.com, as illustrated in Figure 7-3.
4. Click OK to save your changes.
Your home pages now load in tabs in all future Firefox windows.
Separate addresses with a | character.

Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

Setting the bookmarks in a folder as your home pages
Of course, Web addresses are strange beasts, and remembering them can 
be hard. If you’ve already bookmarked the pages you want to use in a book-
marks folder, you can instruct Firefox to use the folder by following these
steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. In the Options window, select the General icon at the top if it isn’t
already selected.
3. Click the Use Bookmark button.
A window appears containing a list of your current bookmarks.
4. From the bookmarks list, choose the folder that contains the book-
marks you want to set as your home pages.
Choosing a bookmarks folder sets the bookmarks currently in the folder
as your home pages. Adding a bookmark to or removing a bookmark
from the selected folder in the future doesn’t affect your home pages. If
you add a bookmark to a folder and want to add it as a home page, you
need to complete these steps again.
5. Click OK to save your changes.
As before, your home pages load in tabs in all future Firefox windows.
Setting a group of open Web sites as your home pages
You can also tell Firefox to use your current set of tabs as your home pages
by following these simple steps:
1. Open each Web site you want to set as one of your home pages in a
new tab. Ensure that only the Web sites you want to set as your home
pages are open in tabs.
2. Choose Tools➪Options.
3. In the Options window, select the General icon at the top if it isn’t
already selected.
4. Click the Use Current Pages button.
5. Click OK to save your changes.
As before, your home pages load in tabs in all future Firefox windows.
95
Chapter 7: Browsing with Tabs

Opening multiple bookmarks 
simultaneously
Visiting your favorite sites should be a pleasurable experience. So why do
people always look like they’re having an ulcer when they have to venture
into their Bookmarks menu? Perhaps it’s because most people seem to have
more bookmarks than there are pages on the Web. Firefox saves you time —
and repetitive trips to the Bookmarks menu — by allowing you to open all
bookmarks in a bookmarks folder at once, each in its own tab. Follow these
steps (and don’t have an ulcer):
1. Open the Bookmarks menu.
2. Choose the folder that contains the bookmarks you want to open.
The contents of the folder appear in a new menu.
3. Choose the Open in Tabs item at the bottom of the menu, as shown in
Figure 7-4.
Each bookmark in the folder opens instantly in its own tab. As usual,
each tab displays a spinning circle until its page finishes loading.
Your bookmarks load in place of your open Web sites, and Firefox doesn’t
ask for any sort of confirmation. So if you have 12 tabs open and you open
a group of 12 or more bookmarks, all your original 12 tabs are replaced
with new pages. You can go to each individual tab and click Back to return
to the previous page, but that’s a big pain. Instead, make sure you’re ready
to leave your current pages before you open a group of bookmarks.
Figure 7-4:
You can
open all the

Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

If your mouse has a middle button or clickable scroll wheel, you can middle-
click a bookmark folder to achieve the same result.
This feature is incredibly useful if you find yourself needing to switch quickly
between different tasks on the Internet. For example, say you’re playing a
bunch of games online, and your boss comes in. (This is hypothetical.) You
can quickly open your Bookmarks menu and choose to open all your Work
Web sites (that is, all the sites you have grouped in your hypothetical Work
folder).
Bookmarking open tabs
Taking the preceding section’s games pages versus work pages example one
step further, what happens if you actually want to save your games pages for
later? If you just choose the Work folder, your games pages are lost. To take
care of this ultra-important case, Firefox allows you to bookmark all open
tabs at once into a bookmarks folder.
1. Load each Web site you want to bookmark into a tab.
2. Choose Bookmarks➪Bookmark All Tabs.
The Bookmark All Tabs window appears so you can enter information
about the new bookmarks folder that will contain the open tabs.
3. Enter the name you want to use for the new folder.
4. (Optional) From the Create In drop-down list, you can select a folder
within which the new folder will be created.
The Create In drop-down list displays your most recently used book-
marks folders. If you don’t see the folder you’re looking for, click the
button with the down arrow next to it to see a list of all your folders, and
then select the desired folder from the list.
By default, the new folder is displayed directly in the bookmarks list
itself.
5. Click OK to create the new folder.
Put that on my tab!
Tabbed browsing is a favorite new feature among the Firefox developers, so
perhaps it’s no surprise that support for the feature is woven throughout
Firefox. For example, if your mouse has a middle button or a clickable scroll
wheel, you can middle-click virtually anything that loads a Web site to instead
load it in a new tab: the Back, Forward, and Home buttons as well as book-
marks and history items. You can also right-click bookmarks and history items,
and then choose the Open in New Tab option from the menu that appears.

Filling In Forms Quickly
In This Chapter
 Saving time with Firefox’s form-filling feature
 Saving and managing passwords in Firefox
 Using a Master Password to protect saved passwords
I
n your online adventures, you’ve probably encountered Web sites that
require you to register for their services by providing personal informa-
tion. Basic information, such as a username and password, are generally nec-
essary to identify you in the Web site’s network. However, Web site operators
like extended registration because it allows them to learn more about you,
which helps them deliver advertising more closely matched to your interests.
(As charitable as that sounds, the endgame, of course, is getting you to click
the advertisements.)
Registration probably isn’t as rosy from your perspective. It requires you to
enter the same information — such as ZIP code — again and again across
multiple sites, and it forces you to remember the login information you use at
each Web site. Repetitive tasks and long-term memory — isn’t that what com-
puters were supposed to help you with?
Firefox comes to the rescue with two handy features:
 Automatic form filling: Enter a piece of information once, and Firefox
helps you fill it in again in the future.
 Automatic login filling: This feature remembers your username/pass-
word combinations at Web sites that require you to log in.
I give you the details about both of these features in this chapter.

Saving Your Sanity with Saved Forms
By default, Firefox automatically saves information you enter into online
forms, such as search phrases, addresses, and ZIP codes. When you begin
typing the same information into another form, Firefox automatically sug-
gests your previous entries in a list below the form, as shown in Figure 8-1. To
see the complete list of suggestions without beginning to type, double-click
within the empty form field or press the down-arrow key. If no suggestions
are available, either you haven’t entered the information previously, or
Firefox can’t understand what the field is asking for (as I describe a little
later). To select a suggestion, click it or navigate to it with the down-arrow
key and press Enter.
Firefox compares apples to apples when it makes form suggestions. For exam-
ple, if your address starts with 3 and your telephone number starts with 3,
Firefox won’t suggest your address when you begin typing your telephone
number. In general, this feature is convenient because it cuts down on silly
suggestions and helps you choose the right one faster. However, it also
requires that Firefox understand exactly what a form field is asking for, so it
knows which of your previous entries to suggest. This is easier said than
done because Web sites refer to the same piece of information (for example,
a telephone number) differently (as in “phone number,” “phone,” “phone #,”
“home number,” and so on). Firefox uses advanced algorithms to understand
forms and make appropriate suggestions.
Don’t be surprised if Firefox can’t make suggestions from time to time even if
you’ve entered the information previously. (Even advanced algorithms can’t
always be perfect.)
Keep in mind that Firefox offers two distinct form-filling features that function
similarly but are controlled by different settings. The first, which I call auto-
matic form filling, helps you fill out general form fields such as address, ZIP
code, and birthday. The second, called automatic login filling, helps you log in
to sites by remembering usernames and passwords and associating them
together. For example, if you have multiple Amazon.com accounts, this fea-
ture remembers and suggests your login names and automatically fills in the
correct password for the one you choose.
Here’s a brief example to illustrate automatic form filling in action: Say you’re
registering for an eBay account. Like many other Web sites, eBay asks for a
physical address, an e-mail address, and other information when you’re regis-
tering. Ordinarily, filling this out would be a lengthy process. But with auto-
matic form filling, Firefox helps you re-enter information you’ve entered in
the past, as illustrated in Figure 8-1.
100
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

An online form doesn’t necessarily have to resemble a typical form that asks
for name, address, and phone number. Sometimes form fields are used for
other purposes, such as search engines (see Figure 8-2). In general, any Web
site that offers a text box and some sort of Submit button is using an online
form, and Firefox saves the information you enter to make suggestions in the
future.
Clearing saved form information
Real-world experience indicates that convenience often comes at the expense
of privacy. Life would be much easier if everyone carried a national ID card
that knows the holder’s addresses, food preferences, favorite video rentals,
and clothing sizes, but it would also mean that some company knows every-
thing about everyone. Chapter 14 addresses online privacy in depth, but here
I talk about it in terms of the form-filling feature.

Chapter 8: Filling In Forms Quickly

Firefox saves form information directly to your computer, but other people
with access to your computer can see it — sometimes inadvertently, if Firefox
suggests one of your previous form entries as the person fills out a form. Thus,
in Firefox, you draw the line between convenience and privacy by choosing
when to clear saved form information and which information to clear. You can
also disable the feature entirely, as you discover in the next section.
Firefox also remembers phrases you enter into the Search Box to the right of
the Location Bar so it can suggest them when you use the Search Box in the
future. The form-filling settings I discuss in the following steps also affect
saved Search Box entries. For example, clearing saved form information
clears the saved Search Box entries as well.
To clear all saved form information, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Privacy icon at the top of the window that appears.
3. Click the Saved Forms tab.
4. Click the Clear Saved Form Data Now button.
The button becomes gray to confirm that Firefox has cleared saved form
data, as shown in Figure 8-3. If the button is already gray, Firefox has not
yet saved any form information to clear.

Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

If you clear saved form information and other private information (such as
browsing history) frequently, you can use Firefox’s Clear Private Data feature
to do so more quickly. You can also use the feature to have Firefox clear saved
form information automatically each time you exit Firefox. See Chapter 14 for
more information.
If you don’t want to clear all of your saved form information, you can delete
individual entries when Firefox suggests them. Follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the form where Firefox makes a suggestion that you want
to delete, and then select the appropriate field.
For example, if you don’t want Firefox to suggest a particular search
phrase you entered at Google in the past, navigate to Google and click
the search field.
2. Open Firefox’s list of form suggestions.
You can do this step either by typing the beginning of the entry you
want to delete or by leaving the field empty and double-clicking or press-
ing the down-arrow key to open the complete suggestions list.
3. Select the suggestion you want to delete in the list using the down-
arrow key.
4. When the appropriate suggestion is selected, press Shift+Delete to
remove it from the list.
The entry is deleted immediately without confirmation.

Turning off automatic form filling
If you don’t need the convenience of automatic form filling and want to keep
form information private from others who use your computer, you can simply
turn off the feature entirely:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Privacy icon on the top of the window that appears.
3. Click the Saved Forms tab.
4. Select the Save Information I Enter in Forms and the Search Bar 
check box.
Disabling the form-filling feature prevents Firefox from making suggestions
when you fill out forms and from remembering any form information you
enter after disabling the feature, but it does not clear the form information
that’s already saved. This means that someone could turn the feature back on
and see your previous entries. To prevent this from happening, clear the form
information that has already been saved by following the instructions in the
earlier section, “Clearing saved form information.”
Saving Login Information for 
Fast Access to Web Sites
Just as the automatic form-filling feature helps you fill out online forms
quickly, the automatic login-filling feature helps you log in to Web sites
quickly by keeping track of your usernames and their associated passwords.
The first time you log in to a Web site with a username (or e-mail address)
and password, Firefox asks you whether it should remember the password,
as illustrated in Figure 8-4. You have three options:
 Yes: This option saves the password in the Password Manager. When
you use the same username at the Web site in the future, Firefox auto-
matically prefills the password. See the section “Viewing and clearing
saved login info with the Password Manager,” later in this chapter, for
more information about viewing and removing saved passwords.
 Never for This Site: Click this button if you never want Firefox to save a
password on any page of this Web site. This option is useful if you never
104
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

want to save passwords for a particular site, perhaps because the site is
especially private or sensitive (for example, your banking site). If you
choose this option but later decide that you want Firefox to remember
this site’s login information after all, you can reverse this decision from
the Password Manager. See “Viewing and clearing saved login info with the
Password Manager,” later in this chapter.
 Not Now: Click this button if you don’t want to save the password now,
but you want Firefox to continue to ask when you log in to this site in
the future. This is useful if you have multiple accounts at the site and
might want to save login information for some of them, but not this par-
ticular one. This might also be the case if, for example, your family
shares one computer, and some members prefer not to use the auto-
matic login filling feature.
If you choose to save the login information for a site, Firefox helps you fill it
in quickly when you return. (This works in the same fashion as the automatic
form filling feature, which I discuss at the beginning of this chapter.) As you
begin typing a username into a login form field, Firefox makes suggestions
based on the usernames you’ve used at the Web site in the past (see Figure 8-5).
When you choose a username, Firefox automatically fills in the associated
password.
For your convenience, the login filling feature goes one step further than gen-
eral form filling. If Firefox only ever sees you use a single set of login informa-
tion (username and password) at a particular site, it assumes that you want
to use that information each time you visit, and automatically prefills the
username and password fields for you, bypassing the suggestions list
entirely. All you need to do is click the login button. As soon as you save
another password on that site, Firefox stops this behavior and returns to
offering a suggestions list rather than guessing which login you prefer to use.

Chapter 8: Filling In Forms Quickly

Using a Master Password
If multiple people share your computer, you might find it disconcerting that
Firefox automatically prefills your passwords for them. Furthermore, these
people will be able to see your passwords directly by using the View Saved
Passwords option I discuss in “Viewing and clearing saved login information
with the Password Manager,” later in this chapter. On the other hand, you
might appreciate the convenience of the feature when you’re at your computer.
A Master Password provides a middle ground between security and conve-
nience. Firefox asks you to enter the Master Password the first time you visit
a login site for which Firefox has saved a password. If you enter the Master
Password correctly, Firefox silently and automatically prefills all subsequent
passwords until you shut down Firefox; the next time you launch Firefox, you
will need to enter the Master Password again before Firefox starts regurgitat-
ing your saved passwords. Thus, with the minor inconvenience of entering
the Master Password just once per browsing session, you can prevent other
people with access to your computer from accessing your saved passwords.
Remember to shut down Firefox when you walk away from the monitor! If you
leave Firefox open after entering the Master Password, the next person to use
Firefox will have access to your saved passwords.

To set the Master Password, choose Tools➪Options, and click the Privacy icon,
then click the Passwords tab. Then click the Set Master Password button, enter
the password you want to use and then re-enter it (see Figure 8-6). A password
quality meter indicates the relative security of the password you have chosen.
Passwords that contain random mixtures of letters, numbers, and other sym-
bols (such as $) are more secure because they’re harder to guess, even with
the help of automated guessing technology. See Chapter 15 for more advice
about creating secure passwords.
If you decide to use a Master Password, make sure you remember it. If you
ever forget your Master Password, there is no way to recover the passwords
that are stored in the Password Manager.
To change the Master Password later, simply click the same button, which now
reads Change Master Password. Likewise, to remove the Master Password, click

Bypassing Web site registration altogether
Nothing is more frustrating than a Web site that
requires you to register just to see a particular
article. By the time you finish registering and
logging in, you probably could have read the
article, transcribed it into beautiful calligraphy,
and sent it to all your friends. Luckily, an enter-
prising group of people who were fed up with
temporary registrations have set up a free ser-
vice called BugMeNot.com to help you bypass
them. The site is brilliant in its simplicity: Enter
the address of the site offering the content you
want to read, and BugMeNot spits out an
anonymous login name and password you can
use. The site even offers a Firefox extension you
can use to log in to the sites automatically with-
out having to sidetrack to BugMeNot. (See
Chapter 20 for information about installing and
using extensions.) Although some people might
question the ethics of this service, you can’t
question its convenience. For more information,
go to http://bugmenot.com.

the Remove Master Password button. In either case, you need to first enter the
current Master Password to prevent someone else with access to your com-
puter from simply disengaging the feature and gaining access to your saved
passwords.
Viewing and clearing saved login info 
with the Password Manager
From the Firefox Password Manager, you can view login information you’ve
told Firefox to save and tell Firefox to forget that information and to stop rec-
ommending it whenever you visit the site. You can also view a list of Web
sites at which you’ve told Firefox not to save login information and undo that
setting so Firefox begins prompting you again when you log in at those sites.
Follow these instructions to use the Password Manager:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Privacy icon at the top of the window that appears.
3. Click the Passwords tab.
4. Click the View Saved Passwords button.
The Password Manager window appears, as shown in Figure 8-7. It con-
tains two tabs: Passwords Saved and Passwords Never Saved. The first
tab shows the login names Firefox has saved and the associated Web
sites. Passwords are not shown unless you choose to show them, as I
discuss a little later in this section. The second tab shows the sites for
which you’ve told Firefox not to save or offer to save login information.
Figure 8-7:

Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

5. From the Password Manager, you can do any of the following:
• View the passwords Firefox has collected thus far. If Firefox has
prefilled your password for so long you’ve actually forgotten it,
this is a good way to retrieve it!
Make sure nobody’s looking over your shoulder before you decide
to show your passwords. Firefox shows every password it has
saved.
Click the Show Passwords button at the bottom of the Password
Manager. If you have a Master Password, you need to enter it
before you can access the stored passwords, even if you’ve
entered it previously. This is for your security. Otherwise, Firefox
asks you to confirm the decision. After you do so, your passwords
are shown in a new Password column in the Password Manager’s
table of login information. To hide your passwords again, click the
Hide Passwords button.
• Clear some or all of the stored login information. If you want
Firefox to forget a certain username and password combination so
that it stops recommending the information when you visit the
Web site, select the information in the Password Manager list and
click the Remove button. To have Firefox forget all login informa-
tion, click the Remove All button.
• Reverse an earlier decision to prevent Firefox from remember-
ing login information on certain Web sites. As I discuss in “Saving
Login Information for Fast Access to Web Sites,” earlier in this
chapter, you can tell Firefox never to remember — or ask to
remember — login information for certain sites. However, if you
later change your mind and want Firefox to ask about saving login
information at this site again, you can reverse your original deci-
sion from the Passwords Never Saved tab in the Password
Manager. Simply click this tab, select the appropriate Web site in
the list, and then click Remove. You can also click Remove All to
undo the decision for all Web sites in the list.
Unlike most other settings windows that you open from the Options
window, the changes you make in the Password Manager take effect
immediately, and are not undone even if you dismiss the Options
window by clicking Cancel after closing the Password Manager.
6. Click the Close button to close the Password Manager.
7. Click the OK button to close the Options window.

Blocking Popup Ads
In This Chapter
 Blocking popup windows
 Viewing blocked popups temporarily
 Allowing certain sites to always open popups
H
ow many times has a telemarketer called you during dinner? How many
unsolicited catalogues have you received in the mail? The Internet was
supposed to change all that. It promised to be a breakthrough communica-
tions medium that would be free of nuisances and readily available in the
comfort of your own home.
Until Firefox came along, that promise was broken in a number of ways, par-
ticularly through a scourge that came to be known as popup advertising. If
you’ve ever visited a Web site and encountered another, smaller window that
contained a product advertisement obscuring the site you were trying to
access, you have been a victim of popup ads. Luckily, Firefox enables you to
block most unwanted popup windows and view only the ones you want or
need. In fact, it does so for you right out of the box! This chapter walks you
through the handful of ways in which you can customize this behavior.
Blocking Popup Windows
Firefox blocks popup ads by default, so you can start surfing the Web in
peace without having to mess with configuration settings. However, there are
a couple things you should know.
Firefox notifies you whenever it blocks a popup ad. The notification is
designed to be obvious but far less unobtrusive and distracting than the
popup ad itself. A thin bar appears right above the Web site that tried to
open the popup as shown in Figure 9-1.

You also see a small icon appear in the bottom-right corner of the window.
This icon serves as an additional notification and offers access to the same
options as the bar’s Options button. It’s useful if you decide to disable the
bar from appearing when a popup is blocked, as I discuss later.
Some sites use popup windows for legitimate purposes — such as displaying
a login form. The primary purpose of these notifications is to allow you to open
popups that Firefox blocks. See the next section, “Viewing Blocked Popup
Windows,” for more information about how to unblock specific popup ads
either temporarily or permanently, as well as how to disable popup blocking
altogether.
To close the bar when it appears, click the red X button on the far right. The
bar reappears the next time Firefox blocks a popup.

tion bar and

If you never want to see the bar again:
1. Click the Options button — also on the far right.
2. Select Don’t Show This Message When Popups Are Blocked in the
menu that appears.
The bar closes immediately and doesn’t appear the next time a popup is
blocked, but you will still be notified by the icon in the bottom-right corner of
the window (refer to Figure 9-1).
If you later decide you want the bar back, click the icon and deselect the
Don’t Show Info Message When Popups Are Blocked option, as illustrated in
Figure 9-2.
Turn the notification bar back on here.

Chapter 9: Blocking Popup Ads

Viewing Blocked Popup Windows
Although most popup windows are used to display advertising, some contain
login forms or other legitimate contents that are necessary parts of a Web
site. Because Firefox cannot tell advertisements apart from other content, it
blocks all popup windows indiscriminately. However, you can open them
manually, as I discuss in the following section.
So how can you tell which popups are legitimate without having to open all of
them? A good rule is that if you’re trying to do something that isn’t working
at the same time a popup is blocked (as indicated by the notification bar and
icon shown earlier in Figure 9-1), you probably need to use the popup
window to continue. For example, if you click a Web site’s Log In button and
nothing appears to happen, the Web site probably tried to open a popup
login window that Firefox blocked.
The directions in the following two sections assume that you have not dis-
abled Firefox’s popup blocking notification bar by choosing the Don’t Show
This Message When Popups Are Blocked option, as I describe in the preced-
ing section. If you have disabled the bar, you can still do everything I outline
here, but instead of clicking the Options button on the bar, you must click the
popup icon at the bottom of the window (as shown earlier in Figure 9-2).
Opening blocked popup windows
Firefox allows you to specify that certain Web sites can always open popup
windows. This feature comes in handy if you decide that a Web site opens
only legitimate popups. In some cases, however, you might want to peek at a
blocked popup window to confirm its legitimacy before making such a perma-
nent decision. You might also want to do this if you don’t intend to revisit the
Web site later and you need just one-time access to the popup. To accommo-
date these cases, Firefox lets you open a blocked popup window without
changing any long-term behavior. In other words, even after you decide to
view a popup, all future popup windows from the Web site that opened it will
continue to be blocked.
1. Visit the Web site that tries to open the popup window you want to view.
2. When Firefox blocks the popup, click the Options button at the right
end of the notification bar.
3. Choose the last option, which begins with the word Show and con-
tains the Web address of the popup window that Firefox blocked.
If the Web site tried to open multiple popup windows, Firefox displays
an entry in the menu for each one, as shown in Figure 9-3. Unfortunately,
114
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

the only distinguishing factor between each menu item is the addresses
that the Web site tried to load into each of the blocked windows. For
example, in Figure 9-3, Firefox blocked three popups, and although each
Show menu item appears identical, the Web addresses are slightly differ-
ent. Because Web addresses are rarely helpful to mere humans, your
best bet is to click each menu item to open and examine each blocked
window individually.
When you choose a Show menu item, the popup window appears on
your screen.
Allowing certain Web sites 
to open popup windows
If you frequent a Web site that uses a popup window legitimately — such as a
bank that integrates one into its login process — you might find it inconve-
nient to have to open it manually each time by using the steps in the preced-
ing section. Instead, you can permanently allow that particular site’s popup
windows to appear. Popup windows from other sites continue to be blocked.
Figure 9-3:

115
Chapter 9: Blocking Popup Ads

Follow these steps to allow a Web site to open popup windows:
1. Visit the Web site that tries to open the popup window you want to view.
2. When Firefox blocks the popup, click the Options button at the right
end of the notification bar.
3. Choose the first option, which begins with the phrase “Allow popups
for” and contains the Web address of the site you’re viewing.
Firefox doesn’t show the popup it has already blocked. However, Firefox
won’t block any popup windows that the Web site tries to open in the future.
To view the blocked window, follow the directions in the preceding section,
“Opening blocked popup windows.”
What do you do if you allow a site to show popups and later decide you don’t
want to see its popup windows after all? Firefox gives you direct access to the
list of exception sites, so all you need to do is open it and remove the site:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Content icon in the strip at the top of the Options window.
3. Click the Allowed Sites button next to the Block Popup Windows
check box.
4. In the window that appears, select the address of the site whose
popups you want to start blocking again (see Figure 9-4).
5. Click the Remove Site button at the bottom of the window.
6. Click the Close button to close the window, and then click OK to close
the Options window.
The next time you visit the site, Firefox once again blocks its popups.

In This Chapter
 Setting up an e-mail account
 Reading and responding to e-mail
 Searching your e-mail
 Introducing the address book
 Blocking spam
 Getting additional help with Thunderbird
B
rowsing without e-mail is like eating peanut butter without jelly, and I
would be negligent if I failed to introduce Thunderbird, a first-class
e-mail application that runs on your desktop. Thunderbird and Firefox serve
two different purposes, but have plenty in common. Both are produced by
the Mozilla Foundation, and both share the same goal: to make your life
easier. And although they are two separate products, the experience is best
when you use both because they integrate well.
Thunderbird is not an e-mail provider; it’s an application you can use with
your existing provider. If you use a Web-based e-mail program that you’re sat-
isfied with, it might not make sense to begin using Thunderbird. However, if
you’re currently using Microsoft Outlook, you should switch to Thunderbird
because it offers superior search and spam-blocking capabilities. In this chap-
ter, I walk you through the basics of Thunderbird and point you to additional
resources should you decide to stick with it.

Getting Thunderbird
Like Firefox, Thunderbird is available both on CD and as a download. To
order the CD, visit the Mozilla Store online (www.store.mozilla.org). To
download the setup file, visit www.getthunderbird.com. The download
takes just a couple of minutes on a high-speed Internet connection.
Installing Thunderbird
The installation process for Thunderbird is essentially identical to that of
Firefox. If you’re using Windows, a Setup Wizard just like the one from Firefox
walks you through the brief installation process. If you’re using a Macintosh,
installation is the same simple drag-and-drop operation you use to install
Firefox. (See Chapter 3 for instructions on installing Firefox from either the
CD or the downloaded setup file.) Adapting the instructions to Thunderbird
is easy, I promise, and if you get stuck, check out the list of online resources
at the end of this chapter. The online resources offer step-by-step installation
instructions.
Using the Import Wizard
Like Firefox, Thunderbird offers a simple Import Wizard to help you migrate
your settings, address books, and old mail from your current mail applica-
tion. Simply choose Tools➪Import to open the Import Wizard. In the first
screen of the wizard, select what kind of information to import, and in the
next, select the e-mail application from which to import. You can return to
the Import Wizard multiple times if you need to import more than one kind of
information. I don’t include extensive import instructions here because I sus-
pect that you’re taking more of a trial run with Thunderbird, and you might
not be sure if you want to switch yet.
Setting Up Your E-Mail Account
The first thing you need to do after you download Thunderbird is set up your
e-mail account. This is where you provide Thunderbird with a bunch of tech-
nical gibberish like your POP or IMAP server so it knows where to find your
e-mail. When you first start Thunderbird, the Account Wizard opens to walk
you through this process, as shown in Figure 10-1.
118
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

To set up a Thunderbird e-mail account, follow these steps:
1. Open Thunderbird by clicking the icon on your desktop.
Thunderbird opens and launches the Account Wizard.
2. In the first screen of the wizard, select an account type and click Next.
Thunderbird offers three account types. The first option, Email Account,
is used to receive and send e-mail. The second option is an RSS News &
Blogs account, which allows you to subscribe to RSS-enabled Web sites
(such as many blogs and news sites) and receive the latest articles in an
e-mail–like interface. See Chapter 5 for a discussion of the RSS technol-
ogy. The third option is a Newsgroup account, which allows you to par-
ticipate in online forums about every topic imaginable.
3. On the Identity screen, enter your name and e-mail address.
The Identity screen asks for your name and e-mail address so it can dis-
play this information in e-mails you send to others.
4. On the Server Information screen, enter your current account server
information and click Next.
To receive and send e-mail, Thunderbird needs to know certain technical
details about your e-mail server, including account type (POP or IMAP —
see the sidebar elsewhere in this chapter), incoming server (for example,
mail.earthlink.net) and outgoing server (for example, smtp.earthlink.net).
Your e-mail service provider typically offers this information on its Web
site. Figure 10-2 shows how I set up Thunderbird to use my own e-mail
provider, but of course, your settings are different.
Figure 10-1:
The
Thunderbird
Account
Wizard.
119
Chapter 10: E-Mailing with Thunderbird

The Use Global Inbox check box is offered for people with multiple e-mail
accounts. By default, Thunderbird combines e-mails sent to each account
into a single Inbox for your convenience. If you intend to use multiple
accounts and want to keep them separate, deselect this check box.
5. On the User Names screen, enter your current account login informa-
tion and click Next.
In addition to your account server information, Thunderbird also needs
to know your e-mail account name for both incoming and outgoing mail
(these are usually identical for most e-mail providers). Usually, but 
not always, your account username is the part of your e-mail address
before the @ sign. For example, if your e-mail address is jennysmith@
earthlink.net, your username is probably jennysmith.
6. In the Account Name screen, enter a name for the new account and
click Next.
People you e-mail cannot see this Account Name. It’s for personal pur-
poses, to allow you to identify this account if you create additional
accounts in the future. By default, Thunderbird names the account by
using your e-mail address.
7. On the Congratulations! screen, verify the accuracy of the information
you entered, decide whether to download messages now, and click
Finish.
This screen provides an overview of the information you entered. If any
information is wrong, click Back until you return to the screen where
you entered the information, and then correct it. (You can modify
Figure 10-2:
The Server
Information

120
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

account information in the future by choosing Tool➪Account Settings.)
Otherwise, you’re finished with account creation. By default,
Thunderbird downloads all the messages from your e-mail provider’s
server when you click Finish. If you’d rather download them later, dese-
lect the Download Messages Now check box.
If you allow Thunderbird to download your messages here and you have a
POP account, your messages will be removed from your e-mail service
provider and will exist only in Thunderbird on your current computer. If
you’re just giving Thunderbird a trial run, this may not be the best idea. To
instruct Thunderbird to leave the messages on the server, uncheck Download
Messages Now and visit the Account Settings window, as I discuss in the side-
bar “POP versus IMAP.”
121
Chapter 10: E-Mailing with Thunderbird
POP versus IMAP
I generally ignore the technical nitty-gritty when
possible, but you should understand an important
distinction between POP and IMAP accounts.
With a POP account, your e-mail remains on
your e-mail provider’s servers until you choose
to download it to an e-mail program. After you
download it, the e-mail is removed from the
server and exists only on the computer and in
the program to which you downloaded it. You
would generally use this kind of account only if
you use a single computer and e-mail program.
By contrast, with an IMAP account, your e-mail
remains on your e-mail provider’s servers until
you manually delete it. This kind of account is a
good choice if you need to access your e-mail
from multiple computers because anywhere you
go, your e-mail is available. As the world grows
more connected and more people need this kind
of access, IMAP accounts are becoming the
clear favorite. If you use a Web-based mail
server, you already enjoy the benefits of IMAP.
Unfortunately, not all e-mail service providers
offer IMAP accounts. If that’s the case with yours,
you can still turn your POP account into a poor
man’s IMAP by instructing Thunderbird to leave
your POP messages on the server even after you
download them. Follow these directions:
1. In the Thunderbird window, choose Tools➪
Account Settings.
The Thunderbird Account Settings window
appears.
2. Under the name of your POP account in the
left bar, click Server Settings.
3. Select the Leave Messages on Server
check box.
The reason I call this a “poor man’s IMAP” is
because e-mail service providers don’t offer
POP accounts nearly as much space on their
servers as they do IMAP accounts — after
all, POP accounts aren’t intended to be used
in this way. To help alleviate this problem, use
the For At Most ___ Days setting to instruct
Thunderbird to remove messages from the
server a certain number of days after it
downloads them, and/or select the Until I
Delete Or Move Them From Inbox option 
to have Thunderbird remove them from 
the server when you delete them on your
computer.
4. Click OK to save your changes.

If you choose to download your messages now, Thunderbird prompts you for
your e-mail account password as soon as you click Finish. Otherwise, it waits
until the first time you try to receive new e-mail by clicking Get Mail on the
toolbar. If you don’t want to be prompted for the password every time you
send or receive e-mail, select the Use Password Manager to Remember This
Password check box, and Thunderbird remembers it for you.
After your password is accepted, Thunderbird downloads your messages
from your e-mail server. If you have a POP account, there might be messages
to download only if you have new mail, so don’t worry if Thunderbird doesn’t
find any. If you have an IMAP account, Thunderbird needs to download every
last message — and there might be thousands, depending on how frequently
you delete mail. It might take a bit of time.
Receiving, Reading, and 
Searching E-Mail
Now that your e-mail account is set up, you’re ready to begin receiving e-mail.
You can manually check for new e-mail at any time by clicking the Get Mail
button on the toolbar, and Thunderbird also checks automatically every 10
minutes. This interval is customizable.
To change how frequently Thunderbird checks for new e-mail or to disable
automatic checking altogether, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Account Settings to open the Account Settings window.
2. Under the name of your account in the left bar, click Server Settings.
3. Do either of the following:
• In the text box that follows the check box beginning “Check For
New Messages Every,” enter the number of minutes representing
how frequently Thunderbird checks for new e-mail.
• To disable automatic checking, deselect the check box.
4. Click OK to save your changes.
If you have new e-mail when Thunderbird checks automatically, it plays a
sound. If you are using Windows, it also shows an animated notification by
your computer clock.

Reading e-mail
Take a minute and examine the main Thunderbird window. The window, shown
in Figure 10-3, is divided into three panes. The Folders pane on the left contains
the e-mail folders — such as Inbox, Sent (mail), and Trash — for your e-mail
accounts. Your new e-mail appears in the Inbox folder.
When you select a folder in the Folders pane, the List pane in the top right
shows you a list of the messages in the folder, ordered chronologically by
default. Thunderbird packs a wealth of information about each message into
this compact display — well beyond the traditional subject line and sender, as
shown in Figure 10-4. You can quickly see the subject, sender and date, as well
as whether the message has any attachments, is considered junk mail, or has
been read.

123
Chapter 10: E-Mailing with Thunderbird

When you select a message in the List pane, the Message pane on the bottom
right shows you the contents of the message. You can also double-click a
message to open it in a separate window, which is handy if you want to open
multiple messages at one time. After you select message in the List pane, you
can use the toolbar buttons to reply to or forward the message, as I discuss
in the following section. You can also click the Print and Delete buttons to —
rather surprisingly — print or delete the selected e-mail.
Searching e-mail
Many e-mail programs bury their search capabilities in menus and windows
that are difficult to access. Thunderbird takes the approach that search isn’t
just convenient in this networked world; it’s an absolute necessity. As in
Firefox, the search feature in Thunderbird is never more than one click away,
thanks to a handy Search Box in the upper-right corner of the window (see
Figure 10-5).

Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

After you finish typing a phrase into the Search Box, Thunderbird automati-
cally conducts the search and displays the results in the List pane. By
default, Thunderbird searches on message sender and subject line, but you
can choose from a number of other fields by clicking the magnifying glass
icon in the Search Box, as shown in Figure 10-5. Searching certain fields, such
as message body, can take a bit of time depending on how many messages
you have.
The Search Box drop-down list includes two apparently similar options that
actually do very different tasks. The Entire Message option searches all
e-mails in the current folder for messages that contain the phrase you enter.
Thunderbird displays all matching e-mails in the List pane. The Find in
Message option searches only the e-mail currently displayed in the Message
pane for the phrase you enter. Thunderbird highlights all instances of the
phrase in the e-mail.
When matching messages appear in the List pane, you can work with them just
as you work with all other List pane messages — respond to them, delete them,
print them, and so forth. Click the red X button to the right of the Search Box
when you’re done so that the rest of your e-mail comes back into view.
Composing E-Mails
Reading e-mail is fun, but the real value is in the conversation. In Thunderbird,
you can compose a new e-mail by clicking the Write button on the toolbar. To
respond to an e-mail that somebody sent you, ensure that the e-mail is selected
in the List pane and then click the Reply button. You can also forward an e-mail
you receive to somebody else to show it to her by selecting the message and
clicking the Forward button.
If you click Reply, your response is sent only to the sender of the original
e-mail and not to any other recipients. To respond to both the sender and all
of the e-mail’s recipients (such as in a team conversation where every
member should be kept in the loop), click the Reply All button on the
Thunderbird toolbar.
In each of the cases, the powerful Compose window appears (as shown in
Figure 10-6) so you can type, format, and send your message. The Compose
window is organized into three primary sections to fill out before sending an
e-mail, which I discuss in the following sections. I also tell you about attach-
ing files to e-mails, spell-checking, and sending e-mails on their way.

The Firefox connection
Thunderbird is designed to feel comfortable to
Firefox users. Its interface sports a similar menu
bar and theme as Firefox, and also contains a
Search Box in the upper-right corner. If Firefox
and Thunderbird are your computer’s default
browsing and e-mail programs (as I discuss 
at the end of this sidebar), they also work
together seamlessly to provide a complete Inter-
net experience.
When you’re in Firefox, you can access your
Thunderbird mail quickly by choosing Tools➪
Read Mail. You can also open an e-mail compose
window (without even launching Thunderbird) by
choosing Tools➪New Message. To provide
faster access to these commands, Firefox offers
a Mail button that you can add to one of your
Firefox toolbars, as I discuss in Chapter 18.
If you come across a link in a Thunderbird
e-mail, you can click it to load the linked page in
Firefox. By default, the link opens in a new tab of
the last Firefox window you used, but you can
configure this behavior from the Tabs category
of the Firefox Options window, as I discuss in
Chapter 7.
Note that the Firefox mail commands and the
Thunderbird launch-in-browser feature work
with your computer’s default e-mail and brows-
ing programs, respectively. If they aren’t already
your defaults, you can make Firefox and
Thunderbird your default browsing and e-mail
programs by using the General category of each
application’s Options window (Tools➪Options).

Addressing e-mails
The first section you should fill out is the addressing area, where you indicate
to whom the e-mail is being sent and in what way. The addressing area contains
a list of rows in which you specify the addresses of the recipients. Each row
that is in use begins with a drop-down list that contains the possible address
types. Thunderbird supports the following forms of addressing e-mail:
 To: Sends e-mail directly to a recipient, who is the primary target of the
e-mail.
 Cc: Sends a carbon copy to a recipient who might be interested in the
e-mail but who is not its primary audience.
 Bcc: Sends a blind carbon copy to a recipient (which means that other
recipients don’t know that he or she is receiving it).
 Reply-To: Specifies the return address that recipients should use when
responding to your e-mail. By default, the return address is the same
address as the one you use to send the e-mail, but you might want to
indicate a different one if you use multiple e-mail accounts or if the
responses should go to a superior in your organization, to another
e-mail member, or to some other party.
 Newsgroup: Specifies a newsgroup (an online forum) on which to post
the e-mail message. This is an advanced feature that’s beyond the scope
of this chapter.
 Followup-To: This is to newsgroups what Reply-To is to e-mail: It redi-
rects the conversation to a different newsgroup. This is an advanced fea-
ture that’s beyond the scope of this book.
Begin by typing the To e-mail addresses into the top row. Separate multiple
e-mail addresses by using a comma (for example, bob@smith.com,
emily@smith.com).
If you want to specify additional types of recipients (such as Cc or Bcc), click
Enter to insert a new row, and then use the drop-down list to the left of the
row to specify the address type. Figure 10-6, earlier in this chapter, shows an
e-mail addressed to a handful of recipients.
As you enter e-mail addresses, Thunderbird makes suggestions based on your
address book. In fact, if you entered the recipient’s name into your address
book, you can start typing that instead, and Thunderbird can still recommend
the right address. You can also add recipients from your address book manu-
ally by clicking the Compose window’s Contacts button to open the Contacts
Sidebar (shown in Figure 10-7), then double-clicking the recipients in the side-
bar list. See “Creating an Address Book” later in this chapter for more informa-
tion about creating an address book.
127
Chapter 10: E-Mailing with Thunderbird

Specifying an e-mail subject
Sending a new e-mail to someone is like beginning a conversation. It’s a good
idea to use the Subject line of the e-mail to indicate what you want to talk
about (for example, “This week’s sales meeting”). If, on the other hand, you’re
responding to or forwarding an e-mail you received, Thunderbird automati-
cally uses the original e-mail’s subject line, prefixed by Re: or Fwd:, respec-
tively. You can still change the subject line, but I recommend you stick to
these tried-and-true e-mail conventions.
Filling out the e-mail body
You’ve come to the fun part: typing the e-mail itself! If you’re responding to an
e-mail you received, Thunderbird automatically quotes the original e-mail in
the message body, and you can type your response above or even within the
quoted original. Otherwise, if you’re starting fresh, you have a daunting white
box to fill. Don’t worry — Thunderbird offers a variety of handy tools to fill
that box in interesting ways.
Thunderbird allows you to compose and send e-mails rich with colors, font
styles, and images, much as Microsoft Word allows you to create stylized
documents. These options are available on the Formatting Toolbar, as shown
Contacts Sidebar

128
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

earlier in Figure 10-6, and might be familiar to you from other word-processing
programs.
Composing an e-mail worthy of Van Gogh doesn’t necessarily mean the recipi-
ents will receive it in all its glory. Your recipients’ e-mail programs must support
the so-called rich e-mail format that enables colors, fonts, and images to appear.
These days, it’s a pretty safe bet that this will be the case. However, if you use
an unusual font that a recipient doesn’t have, he or she will see your text in a
plain font — so it’s a good idea to stick to common fonts.
Attaching files
If you need to send a file along with an e-mail, you can attach it, and the recip-
ients of the e-mail can download the file to their own computers when they
receive the e-mail. To attach one or more files in Thunderbird, follow these
simple steps:
1. Click the Attach button on the toolbar of the Compose window.
The Attach File window appears so you can find and select the files to
attach.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the files to attach.
3. Select the file(s) to attach.
To select more than one file, hold Ctrl (Windows) or Ô (Mac) while click-
ing. To select a range of files at one time, hold Shift while clicking.
Thunderbird displays the e-mail’s current attachments list in a box in the
corner. (This box appears only when at least one file is attached, so don’t
worry if you don’t see it yet.) You can add or remove files from the list at any
time before sending the e-mail. To add files, repeat the preceding steps. To
remove files, select the files in the list and press Delete. Removing an attach-
ment does not, of course, delete or otherwise affect the file on your computer.
Spell-checking
So your e-mail is beautifully tricked out in colors and styles, and even con-
tains some interesting prose, too. There’s just one problem — that spelling of
mundain doesn’t look quite right, but you’d rather not use a more, uh, boring
word. Fortunately, Thunderbird offers integrated spell-checking. Now you can
focus on the e-mail itself, and not minor nuisances like the English language.
Thunderbird identifies misspelled words as you type, and it can also guide you
through the spell-checking process, which comes in handy for longer e-mails
with more misspellings. I discuss both methods in the following two sections.
129
Chapter 10: E-Mailing with Thunderbird

Spell-checking as you type
Like Microsoft Word and many other word processors, Thunderbird automati-
cally checks your spelling as you type and underlines misspelled words with a
dotted red line. When you right-click the word, Thunderbird displays a list of
suggestions at the top of the contextual menu, as shown in Figure 10-8. You can
choose a suggestion to replace the misspelled word or fix the word manually.
Sometimes Thunderbird complains about words that are actually spelled cor-
rectly, such as slang, names, or other proper nouns. To prevent Thunderbird
from complaining about occurrences of the word in this particular e-mail,
right-click the word and choose Ignore Word from the contextual menu. To
prevent Thunderbird from identifying the word as misspelled in this and all
future e-mails, choose Add to Dictionary to add it to Thunderbird’s dictionary.
Using the guided spell-checking feature
The method I describe in the preceding section is handy for a misspelled
word or two, but might be cumbersome for long e-mails with many mis-
spellings. If you prefer to have Thunderbird guide you through the spell-
checking process, follow these simple steps:
1. Click the Spell button on the toolbar.
The Check Spelling window appears to indicate the status of the spell-
checking process. If Thunderbird finds no misspelled words, it says so.
Figure 10-8:
Thunderbird’s

checking

e-mails.
130
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

In that case, click Close to close the window, and skip the remaining
instructions. Otherwise, Thunderbird displays the first misspelled word
in bold and offers a list of suggested corrections.
2. If the word is in fact misspelled, select one of Thunderbird’s sug-
gested corrections, or type in your own correction in the Replace
With text box. 
I say “if the word is in fact misspelled” because Thunderbird doesn’t
know your mother-in-law’s name (and maybe that’s a good thing) and
some pop-culture lingo. You can use the Ignore buttons to ignore these
words for this e-mail only. If you use the words often and don’t want the
spell-check feature to complain about them again, click the Add Word
button to add the word to Thunderbird’s dictionary.
If you enter your own correction, you can spell-check it by clicking the
Check Word button.
3. After you correct or ignore the misspelled word, click the Recheck
Page button to continue spell-checking the rest of the e-mail. Repeat
until Thunderbird indicates No misspelled words.
Sending your e-mail
When your e-mail is spell-checked and ready to go, simply click the Send
button to send it.
To send an e-mail quickly by using the keyboard, press Ctrl+Enter (or
Ô+Enter on the Mac). When you send an e-mail this way, Thunderbird asks
you to confirm the send to make sure you didn’t press those keys acciden-
tally, so click Send in the confirmation window or press Enter. A check box in
the window allows you to turn off the confirmation window for future sending.
Creating an Address Book
You can’t even remember your mother-in-law’s name, so how do you expect
to remember her e-mail address? Thunderbird’s address book helps you do
what computers were made to do — remember mundane details for us. After
you build up your address book, Thunderbird helps you compose e-mails to
your friends, family and coworkers easily.
Creating an address book can be a chore, but Thunderbird simplifies the task by
helping you build it automatically. Whenever you send an e-mail, Thunderbird
automatically adds the e-mail’s recipients to your address book. Even though
131
Chapter 10: E-Mailing with Thunderbird

you don’t necessarily want everyone you e-mail in your address book, having
them there doesn’t really hurt anything because searching for an address
later takes about the same amount of time even with a handful of unneces-
sary addresses.
If you want to manually add an address to your address book, you have two
ways to do it. If the person you want to add sends you an e-mail, you can add
his or her address from the e-mail itself. The Message pane already contains
the sender’s address, so just click it (with either the left or right mouse
button) and choose Add to Address Book from the menu that appears, as
shown in Figure 10-9.
Otherwise, if you know the person’s e-mail address, you can manually create
a new card (which is like a record) in your address book by choosing File➪
New➪Address Book Card and filling out the window that appears. You can
enter all sorts of information into an Address Book card, but filling out the
first name, last name, and e-mail address is a good place to start.
After you add a name and address to your address book, Thunderbird can
suggest it when you begin typing either one into the address field of an
e-mail, as I discuss in the earlier section, “Composing E-Mails.” You can also
select it manually from the Contacts Sidebar of the Compose window, which I
also discuss in that section.
Blocking Junk Mail
Every time I receive an e-mail from a friend in Peru, I stop to marvel at the
amazing technological advances. But then the Viagra spam arrives, depriving
the moment of its magic. Unsolicited e-mails — known bitterly as spam, or
junk mail in Thunderbird — are a frustrating reality of the online experience.
But Thunderbird takes broad and innovative strides to making them a thing
of the past.
Figure 10-9:
Build your
address
book quickly
and easily
from the
Message
pane.
132
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

The system is simple and works like this: Thunderbird begins life stupid. It
can’t really tell the difference between a legitimate e-mail and junk e-mail, so
you have to manually indicate the junk e-mail. However, as you identify junk
e-mails, Thunderbird learns what junk looks like and begins to recognize it on
its own. When you’re confident in Thunderbird’s ability to recognize junk
e-mail, you can tell it to automatically move junk e-mail to a special Junk
folder that you can quickly peruse when you have time (to ensure that no
legitimate e-mails were misclassified). The Junk folder is displayed in the
Folders pane alongside your other e-mail folders. When you’re really confi-
dent in Thunderbird’s abilities, you can have Thunderbird automatically
empty the Junk folder at certain intervals. Thunderbird grows very smart
pretty quickly, and it errs on the side of caution when it’s uncertain about a
particular e-mail, leaving that e-mail in your Inbox.
So there are just two things you have to know to take advantage of
Thunderbird’s junk mail capabilities: how to manually mark e-mails as junk
mail to train Thunderbird; and how to make Thunderbird deal with junk
e-mails automatically after it learns how to recognize them. I discuss both in
the following two sections.
Marking e-mails as junk mail
Identifying an e-mail as junk mail is so easy it’s almost criminal to devote a
section to it. After you select the message in the List pane (so that you can
now see the message in the Message pane), simply click the Junk button in
the Thunderbird toolbar. A Junk Mail bar appears at the top of the Message
pane indicating the junk mail status, and a tiny Trash icon appears next to
the date in the List pane, as shown in Figure 10-10.
Junk Mail bar
Trash icon
Figure 10-10:

133
Chapter 10: E-Mailing with Thunderbird

By default, marking an e-mail as junk mail doesn’t affect the e-mail in any way; it
just contributes to Thunderbird’s education. However, you can tell Thunderbird
to automatically move these messages to the Junk folder or delete them. This
option affects only messages you mark as junk mail manually, not messages
Thunderbird thinks are junk mail.
Follow these instructions to specify what Thunderbird does when you manu-
ally mark an e-mail as junk mail:
1. Choose Tools➪Junk Mail Controls.
The Junk Mail Controls window appears.
2. Select the When I Manually Mark Message as Junk check box.
3. Select the Move Them to the “Junk” Folder or Delete Them option,
depending on which action you want Thunderbird to take.
4. Click OK to save your changes.
After you have manually marked a handful of e-mails as junk mail, Thunderbird
begins identifying and marking junk mail on its own. You’ll know when this hap-
pens because you’ll start seeing messages flagged with the junk mail indicators
(as shown in Figure 10-10) that you didn’t flag manually. This doesn’t mean it’s
time to stop marking junk mail manually, because Thunderbird is still learning,
but it’s a good sign — like a baby’s first steps. Be sure to correct Thunderbird
when it misidentifies legitimate e-mail as junk e-mail by clicking the Not Junk
button in the toolbar.
Configuring automatic junk mail handling
When you’re confident in Thunderbird’s abilities to correctly distinguish
legitimate mail and junk mail most of the time (it takes me about three weeks
to train Thunderbird), you can instruct it to automatically move junk mail out
of your way — which, after all, is the whole point. Thunderbird can move
junk mail to a folder of your choosing, and optionally delete that folder at reg-
ular intervals you indicate.
To configure automatic handling of junk mail, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Junk Mail Controls.
The Junk Mail Controls window appears.
2. Select the Move Incoming Messages Determined to be Junk Mail To
check box.
134
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

3. To move junk mail to a folder named Junk, select “Junk” Folder On,
and then select (by using the drop-down list) the account whose Junk
folder you want to move it to.
This is an advanced option for people with multiple accounts.
Thunderbird also lets you choose a different folder by choosing Other
and then selecting the folder you want to use in the drop-down to the
right.
4. To have Thunderbird delete the junk mail folder you chose at regular
intervals, select the check box beginning “Automatically Delete Junk
Messages Older Than,” and then enter the desired interval.
The default interval is 2 weeks.
5. Click OK to save your changes.

 Working with plug-ins
 Clearing your download history
T
he Internet is one of the most impressive engineering feats in human his-
tory, but it’s also the largest wasteland ever created. Scattered carelessly
across space and time, the Internet epitomizes mankind’s tendency toward
clutter. It is the collective closet of billions of people worldwide, and it’s a
mess. Just put those shoes anywhere.
But if that’s the Internet’s curse, that’s also its charm. Because unlike your
own closets, the mess that is the Internet is Someone Else’s Problem. You fire
up your browser and take what you need, and at the end of the day, you just
shut it down.
It’s only after you download stuff from the Internet to your computer that the
clutter becomes your problem, and unfortunately, most browsers do little to
temper it. Even the most casual downloaders soon find themselves over-
whelmed with scattered files. The Firefox Download Manager is designed to
help you organize and open the files you download so you don’t have to
spend your time searching for them. In other words, you can rest easy: Even
your own clutter is now someone else’s problem.
Downloading Music, Pictures, 
and Other Files
Many people these days have high-speed, always-on Internet connections. So
what’s the point of downloading a copy of something when you could access

it live on the Internet? Admittedly, downloading has its roots in the quainter
era of dial-up, when it was much cheaper to save a copy of that picture or
song than keep reconnecting to the Internet to access it. Even today, though,
there are plenty of reasons why you might want to download something:
 If you’re a laptop user, you have access to the file when you’re offline
and on the road.
 Some types of media, such as video, play too slowly to enjoy live, even
on a high-speed connection. Downloading these files first and playing
them on your computer provides a less choppy and more pleasurable
experience.
 If you want to edit a file (for example, suppose you have a team docu-
ment at work that needs to be available to several coworkers), you
should download it first so your changes are saved to your computer
while you edit the file. You can later upload the finished version to the
Internet.
Starting a download
How you download a file depends in part on how the Web site from which
you’re downloading is configured. In most cases, you can simply click a link
or button — typically labeled Download. In other cases, the Web site asks
you to wait while it begins the download on your behalf. Either way, Firefox
displays the window shown in Figure 11-1 so you can decide how to down-
load the file.
The name of the file
The file type
Figure 11-1:
Firefox asks
you how to

begin down-
loading it.
138
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

The text at the top of the window indicates the name of the file you are down-
loading, as well as what type of file it is. For example, in this case, a family-
oriented news advisory document is being downloaded, so the name of the
file is NewsAdvisory.doc, and the file type is Microsoft Word Document.
Firefox asks you up front what you want to do when the file is finished trans-
ferring. You have two options:
 Select Open with if you want to open the file as soon as it finishes trans-
ferring. If you have an application on your computer that handles files of
the type you are downloading, Firefox defaults to using it. To change the
application that will be used, open the drop-down list next to Open With
and select another application if one is available. If one is not available,
you can select Other to find one on your computer, which is a fairly
advanced feature.
 Select Save to Disk if you want to save the file directly to your desktop.
(You can change the default download location or instruct Firefox to ask
you for a location each time; see “Changing the default download loca-
tion” later in this chapter for instructions.) When the file finishes down-
loading, you can open it from the Download Manager (see the following
section). However, Firefox doesn’t open it automatically.
When the download begins, Firefox opens the Download Manager so you can
track the progress of the download. See the later section “Using the
Download Manager” if you want to disable this feature. Furthermore,
Windows users are treated to an animated, nonintrusive notification in the
bottom-right corner of the screen whenever a download ends, as shown in
Figure 11-2. You can click it to open the Download Manager, or you can ignore
it, and it will slide back down.

Chapter 11: Downloading and Saving Files

Bypassing the download decision window
If you download frequently and stick with the same set of options, you might
find the download decision window, which asks you how and where to down-
load the file, to be too distracting. If so, select the check box at the bottom to
instruct Firefox not to display the window again when you download files of
the given type in the future. For example, if you select Open With: Microsoft
Word for the document and then select this check box, Firefox automatically
opens all future documents in Word without asking as soon as you choose to
download them.
You can override this default behavior by right-clicking links to files you want
to save and choosing Save Link As from the contextual menu as I discuss in
“Overriding default actions with Save Link” later in this chapter.
If you change your mind later on, you can change which default action Firefox
takes or instruct it to start asking you again:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Downloads icon at the top of the window.
140
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 
Open with caution
When downloading, using the Open With option
has a subtle but important consequence that
you should understand before selecting it. Open
With is the option to select when you just want
to view the file as quickly as possible and you
don’t expect to edit it or return to it later on.
Firefox enforces this idea by downloading the file
to a temporary location that’s difficult to find and
could disappear in the future if you or a cleaning
application you use deletes the temporary folder
to conserve space on your computer.
This might not seem like a big deal, but it’s easy
to wander into a trap. For example, say you
choose to open the document with the intent to
read it, but then decide you need to correct a
few things. When you try to save the file, Word
doesn’t ask you where to save it because it
already exists at a temporary location. However,
you certainly don’t want to save your new copy
to this location because it’s hard to find and
might be deleted later on!
You could work around that problem by choos-
ing the Save As command in Word and saving
the revised copy to a permanent location on
your computer. But the best solution is to use
the Save to Disk command in Firefox instead of
Open With when you download a file that you
need for long-term use. A good way to remem-
ber this is to think of Open With as writing the
information you’re downloading to a fortune
cookie label. Would you save important infor-
mation to that tiny strip of paper? Of course not!
You’d save it to a memorable and easily acces-
sible location, such as your computer’s desktop.

3. Under Download Actions at the bottom, select View & Edit Actions to
open the Download Actions window, shown in Figure 11-3.
Any files that Firefox handles for you automatically upon downloading
are listed here. Notice that Firefox contains a long list of automatic
actions by default; these are to enable the use of browser plug-ins, as I
describe in “Plugging along with plug-ins” later in this chapter.
4. Select the file type in the list whose default action you want to change.
To find the item quickly in the list, type part of the file type. For exam-
ple, type word for Microsoft Word documents. Note that search phrases
must be lowercased.
5. To remove the default action, click the Remove Action button at the
bottom.
Firefox asks you to confirm the decision; if you do so, it takes effect
immediately. For example, if Firefox was set to open Word documents in
Word automatically when you download them, Firefox will prompt you
each time you download a Word document in the future.
Note that for the built-in file types that are handled by plug-ins, this
button is unavailable. You can’t remove the automatic handling for file
types, although you can change how it behaves, as I describe in Step 6.
See “Plugging along with plug-ins” later in this chapter for more informa-
tion about plug-ins.
6. To change the default action, click the Change Action button, and
then select one of the following options in the window that appears.
The first three options, although presented in a slightly different fashion,
behave exactly like the Open With and Save to Disk options I discuss
earlier, and the cautions apply.

Chapter 11: Downloading and Saving Files

• Open Them with the Default Application: Instructs Firefox to
automatically open all files of the selected type in the program
your computer typically uses, as soon as they finish downloading.
For example, if you’re changing the setting for document files and
you have Microsoft Word installed as the default word processor,
Firefox automatically opens documents you download in Word.
• Open Them with This Application: Instructs Firefox to automati-
cally open files of the selected type in a program of your choosing
as soon as they finish downloading. When you select this option,
Firefox opens a Browse File window so you can find the program
you want to use, which is a fairly advanced maneuver. For example,
if you’re changing the setting for document files and you would
rather use WordPerfect to open downloaded documents instead of
your system’s default word processor, Microsoft Word, you can use
this option to locate the WordPerfect program file.
• Save Them on My Computer: Instructs Firefox to automatically
save files of the selected type to your hard drive as soon as they
finish downloading. By default, Firefox saves files to the desktop.
You can change the default download location or instruct Firefox
to ask you for a location each time you download a file. See the fol-
lowing section for more instructions.
• Use This Plugin: Instructs Firefox to load files of the selected type
using the specified plug-ins. If a plug-in that can handle the file type
is available, Firefox displays it automatically. Otherwise, this
option is unavailable. See the section “Plugging along with plug-
ins,” for more information.

Changing the default download location
Firefox allows you to either open or save downloadable files. If you choose to
save, you might be surprised to discover that Firefox doesn’t ask you where
you’d like to save. Because most people tend to save files to a single location,
Firefox bypasses this step to minimize distractions and save you time. By
default, Firefox downloads all files to your computer desktop, where you can
access them without having to search through your computer’s file system.
Some people prefer to disable this behavior because their desktops can
quickly get crowded if they’re not careful. Others turn it off because some-
times they need to specify a different download location. However, neither of
these reasons justifies turning off the feature entirely; instead, you can simply
142
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

tweak the feature to accommodate each. You can resolve the first problem by
changing the default location to a normal folder on your computer, and the
second by using the Save Link mechanism to override the default location in
the exceptional cases, as I outline in “Overriding default actions with Save
Link,” later in this chapter. You should turn off the feature entirely only if you
want Firefox to ask you where to save each and every file you download.
To tweak or disable the default location behavior:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Downloads icon at the top of the window.
3. To change the default download location, click the Browse button and
select the desired location, and then click OK.
To turn off the default download location altogether, select the Ask Me
Where to Save Every File option.
4. Click OK to save your changes.
Plugging along with plug-ins
Saving or opening a file disrupts your flow by pulling you out of the Web
browser. This disruption is expected for things like documents, but wouldn’t
it be nice if Firefox could play movie clips and songs without forcing you to
divide your attention among multiple programs?
You’re in luck. Firefox isn’t designed to be a multimedia masterpiece in and of
itself (that’s what Web pages are responsible for), but it can emulate the
experience through the use of browser plug-ins. Plug-ins are an advanced
technology that most people should never have to worry about, but the basic
idea is that you can literally insert programs into Firefox to give it newfound
capabilities. Firefox can’t play movies? No problem. Apple’s QuickTime pro-
gram can, so Firefox embeds QuickTime into the Content area. Now you’ve
got the power of a full-fledged movie player with the convenience of in-
browser playback. Your computer probably already contains most of the
plug-ins you’ll need, such as Adobe Acrobat for electronic documents, but I
describe how to obtain missing plug-ins in the following section.
Finding plug-ins you might need
As you explore the Web, you might encounter content that requires plug-ins
you don’t already have, such as Flash for complex, animated Web sites. In
such cases, Firefox displays a toolbar above the page to notify you that a
plug-in is required. You also see an empty box on the page with a green
puzzle piece inside, as shown in Figure 11-4.
143
Chapter 11: Downloading and Saving Files

This box is where the plug-in content would load if the plug-in were available,
and the puzzle piece represents the missing plug-in. Click the puzzle piece to
have Firefox find the plug-in and walk you through the installation process as
follows:
1. Click the green puzzle piece to open the plug-in installation wizard,
shown in Figure 11-5.
Firefox searches for available plug-ins. Any matches it finds are dis-
played in a list and installed by default. If multiple plug-ins are available,
you can indicate which plug-ins you don’t want to install by deselecting
the check boxes next to their names.
2. Click Next to continue.
3. Read through the license agreement for the plug-in you’re installing.
This agreement outlines the terms and conditions under which you can
use the plug-in, and explains the rules governing the plug-in’s behavior.
Click the puzzle piece.

Hmm.
Something

here. Click

144
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

4. Select I Agree and click Next to continue with installation.
Firefox downloads and automatically installs the plug-in. This process
should take less than a minute, at which point the completion screen
appears.
5. Click Finish to close the wizard.
Some plug-ins require you to restart Firefox before they work. Otherwise,
Firefox automatically loads the content that required the plug-in in place of
the empty box with the puzzle piece as soon as installation finishes.
Although Firefox maintains a comprehensive plug-in database (located at
https://pfs.mozilla.org/plugins), you might encounter a Web site
that requires a rare plug-in that Firefox can’t find. In that case, you need to
find the plug-in yourself on the Internet or you will be unable to view the con-
tent that requires it.
Overriding default actions with Save Link
Sometimes, Firefox might act on your behalf in undesirable ways due to the
automatic settings I discuss in “Bypassing the download decision window,”
earlier in this chapter. Perhaps you click a link with the intent to save the file
to which it links, but Firefox opens the file automatically. Or perhaps Firefox
saves the link automatically to a certain location, but you wanted to save it to
a certain folder.

Chapter 11: Downloading and Saving Files

Earlier in the chapter, I explain how to prevent or disable all automatic
behaviors, but you might find these behaviors to be convenient in most sce-
narios. For example, if you want to open a downloaded document in Word 99
percent of the time, it makes sense to have Firefox do that automatically. But
what about those one or two documents you need to open in WordPerfect
because Word can’t handle them correctly? For these and other scenarios,
Firefox offers a simple solution: the Save Link mechanism. Rather than click-
ing the link itself, you merely instruct Firefox that you wish to save the con-
tent to which the link points. This not only ensures that you can save a file
without Firefox opening it, but also gives you the chance to save it to a loca-
tion of your choosing. You can then open the file manually in whichever 
program you choose.
1. Right-click the link to the file you want to save and choose Save Link
As to open the Save window.
You can also hold down Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) and click the link.
2. Select the location to which you would like to save the file.
You can also provide a new filename if you don’t like the default pro-
vided by the Web site.
3. Click Save when you’re finished.
Although you can use the Save Link mechanism at any time, it is most useful
for overriding default download behaviors.
Saving Web Sites
Downloading files from Web sites is something most people who browse the
Internet are familiar with. But what about downloading the Web sites them-
selves? Firefox allows you to save a copy of any Web site to your computer,
like a digital snapshot of the site as it exists at that time. This provides peace
of mind that you’ll always have a copy of the page even if it disappears from
the Internet — for example, if you write an online newspaper article that will
stay up only for two weeks and you want to keep a copy of it. It also comes in
handy when you want to save a copy of a long document to read on a plane
or in other offline environments.
1. Visit the Web site you want to save.
2. Choose File➪Save Page As.
Press Ctrl+S (or Ô+S on a Mac) to open the Save window more quickly.
3. Select the location to which you would like to save the file.
You can also provide a new filename if you don’t like the default, which
is provided by the Web site.
146
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

4. From the Save as Type drop-down list at the bottom, select one of the
following options:
• Web Page, Complete: Instructs Firefox to save the entire Web site,
including all images, colors, and designs. This option is the default,
and it’s the best option if you want Firefox to save an exact replica
of the page to your computer.
Firefox saves the main Web page file to the directory of your
choosing and places all subsidiary files to a new directory called
WebPageName_Files. For example, suppose you choose to save
the CNN home page to a file called CNN.html in your computer’s
My Documents folder. Firefox would save CNN.html to My
Documents as instructed and create a new subfolder called
CNN_Files to hold images and other files associated with the Web
site. You don’t have to worry about reconstructing the page in the
future; when you load CNN.html in Firefox, Firefox automatically
does that work for you.
• Web Page, HTML Only: Instructs Firefox to save the Web site itself,
but not the images and other associated media. If you’re online
when you view your saved copy later on, the media may or may
not be available depending on the way the Web site is pro-
grammed. If you’re offline, however, the media is unavailable
because you haven’t saved it to your computer.
• Text Files: Instructs Firefox to save only the plain text of the Web
site. No images or other multimedia will be included, and any text
styling (for example, bold or italic) will be lost.
After you save the page, the Download Manager appears. To view your snap-
shot of the page, simply double-click it in the Download Manager. If you’re
comfortable with your computer’s file system, you can also navigate to the
folder where you saved the snapshot and open the file (which probably has
an .htm or .html extension) in Firefox.
Using the Download Manager
The Firefox Download Manager provides a single, simple interface for track-
ing the progress of ongoing downloads and opening files that have finished
downloading.
Opening the Download Manager
You can access the Download Manager at any time by choosing Tools➪
Downloads or by pressing Ctrl+J (Ô+J on a Mac). Whenever you begin a
download, the Download Manager opens automatically so you can track its
147
Chapter 11: Downloading and Saving Files

progress. If the Download Manager is already open, it flashes briefly on your
computer’s taskbar to indicate that a new download has begun.
You can instruct Firefox not to open the Download Manager automatically if
you find such behavior annoying. Alternatively, you can allow Firefox to open
it automatically but close it as soon your files have finished downloading:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Downloads icon at the top of the window to access the down-
load options, as shown in Figure 11-6.
3. Do one of the following:
• Deselect the Show Download Manager When a Download Begins
check box to turn off the automatic opening feature.
• Select the Close the Download Manager When All Downloads Are
Complete check box to leave the automatic opening intact but
force the manager to close as soon as all files finish downloading.
4. Click OK to save your changes.
Exploring the Download Manager
At the heart of the Download Manager is your downloads list, shown in
Figure 11-7. This list contains both current and finished downloads, with
Figure 11-6:
You can
tweak
Firefox’s
down-
loading
behavior or
change
when the
Download
Manager
appears.
148
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

most recent (or in-progress) downloads at the top and oldest downloads at
the bottom. Each entry in the list displays the filename of the download as
well as an icon representing the application that your computer will use to
open it. For example, the symbol for Microsoft Word typically appears next to
document files if you have Word installed on your computer.
When a download is in progress, a progress meter indicates approximately
how much of the file has been transferred and how much is still to come, as
illustrated in Figure 11-7. The text beneath the progress meter reflects similar
information in the technical language of kilobytes and megabytes, which repre-
sent digital file sizes. It also indicates your approximate download rate as well
as an estimate of how much time is remaining before the download completes.
What you can do with a given download depends on its current status:
 Ongoing downloads (like the first download in Figure 11-7) can either be
canceled or paused via the supplied links. You can resume a paused
download at any time while Firefox remains open, but if you close
Firefox while downloads remain paused, they are canceled entirely. In
that case, Firefox asks you to confirm the shutdown before canceling
your downloads.
 Failed downloads are downloads that were either canceled deliberately
or terminated abruptly due to a connection error. You can restart these
downloads by clicking the Retry link, or you can remove them from the
list by clicking Remove.

149
Chapter 11: Downloading and Saving Files

 Finished downloads are downloads that completed successfully and
exist on your computer. To open these files, click the Open link or
simply double-click anywhere within the item. If the file is a program,
such as an installer, Firefox asks you to confirm your decision to launch
it due to security reasons. Before opening programs, make sure you
trust the Web site that offered them for download. I also recommend
using a professional virus scanner like Norton AntiVirus that automati-
cally scans files you download and open.
If the file is a type of media (such as a graphic file or a document), and if
you have a program on your computer that handles that media type,
Firefox launches the program automatically. If Firefox is able to detect
such a program, the icon to the left of a download is the program’s logo.
If not, Firefox asks you to select the program when you open the file.
Sometimes you don’t want to open the file itself, but rather the folder that
contains it. This is useful if you need to manage the file in a way that the
Download Manager doesn’t offer — such as renaming it or moving it — or if
you just want to know where the file actually lives on your computer. To open
the containing folder, simply right-click a download and choose Open
Containing Folder from the menu that appears. If you’re using a default down-
load location, the Download Manager offers one-click access to it by clicking
the button next to All Files Downloaded To at the bottom of the window.
(Although it doesn’t look like a button, the text is in fact clickable.) The
default download location is the computer desktop, as I describe earlier in
this chapter.
Firefox remembers the Web site from which you downloaded a file so you can
return to it later. Simply right-click a download and choose Properties from
the menu that appears. The Properties window opens and offers the address
of the Web site that provided the download next to From. The Properties
window also contains the path to the file on your computer, as well as the
dates and times at which the download began and finished.
Of course, you can also remove a finished download from the list by clicking
Remove. This does not remove the downloaded file from your computer; it
simply removes the record that this download took place from the Download
Manager.
Clearing your download history
By default, Firefox automatically retains a record of all your downloads —
completed or canceled — but you control what remains in this history or
150
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

even whether such a history is maintained at all. This section discusses vari-
ous ways of managing and clearing your Firefox download history.
This history is merely a record of the downloads that took place and is in no
way tied to the actual files downloaded to your computer. Removing records
from your download history does not remove the files from your computer.
However, you will no longer be able to access those files through the conve-
nient Download Manager interface; you will need to access through your
computer’s standard file system. Chapter 14 covers clearing download his-
tory in more detail.
Removing individual download records
If you want to clean up the Download Manager without clearing all its
records, you can delete records one by one with the following steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Downloads.
2. Find the download record you want to remove in the list and click the
Remove link.
Removing a record instructs Firefox to forget what it knows about that spe-
cific download only. If you download the same file again, Firefox creates a
new record in your download history.
Removing all download records at once
If you’re no longer using any of the records in the Download Manager, you
can remove them with the following steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Downloads.
2. Click the Clean Up button in the bottom-right corner of the Download
Manager.
Firefox won’t ask you to confirm this process, which is irreversible.
Instructing Firefox to remove download records automatically
If you’re concerned about privacy or overwhelmed by a long download his-
tory, you can instruct Firefox to remove download records automatically,
either as soon as a download finishes or when Firefox exits:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Privacy icon at the top of the window.
3. Click the Download History tab to view the download options.
151
Chapter 11: Downloading and Saving Files

4. Select one of the following options from the Remove Files from the
Download Manager drop-down list:
• Manually: This is the default option. It means Firefox will never
erase a download record until you tell it to do so.
• Upon Successful Download: Removes a download record as soon
as the file it represents is finished transferring.
• When Firefox Exits: Removes all download records each time you
close Firefox. Note that this setting affects existing records that
have already accumulated. In other words, if you have 20 records
in your history when you enable this setting and close Firefox,
those 20 records will be erased.
5. Click OK to save your changes.

W
ith the rise of e-mail and the Internet, some doomsayers predicted the
death of the printed book. Business managers whispered the phrase
“paperless office” to each other in excited tones. Some professors began
accepting research papers electronically, and students groaned and moaned
as usual. But has the Web replaced the printed page? Not at all.
For all the benefits of an online world, paper still has its days. Printed text
and graphics are often sharper on the page than on the screen; reading long
passages of text on-screen can still be awkward and uncomfortable. And the
smallest and lightest laptops in the world still aren’t as convenient to carry
around as that rolled-up stack of paper.
Unlike many other browsers, Firefox recognizes the value of paper and makes
the print experience as seamless as your online experience. In particular,
Firefox offers a powerful Print Preview feature that lets you see exactly what
a Web site will look like before you print it. This feature allows you to save
paper by printing only the pages you need. You can even tweak the print
format by changing the margins, header and footer text (the text that appears
in the top and bottom margins of each page), and other features. This chap-
ter shows you how.

Using Print Preview
How many times have you printed an interesting page only to discover that
something was, shall we say, lost in translation? Maybe parts of an image are
missing. Worse, maybe parts of the story are missing. This kind of thing hap-
pens frequently because many Web designers concentrate on designing the
best possible on-screen experience. Because the screen and a sheet of paper
have completely different dimensions, this focus often comes at the expense
of the printed page. Now you just have a piece of paper to throw away.
You can use Print Preview to view a Web page as it will print before you print
it and avoid wasting paper (and time). To open the Print Preview window
(shown in Figure 12-1), navigate to the Web page you want to print, and
choose File➪Print Preview. Firefox offers a variety of correctional features you
can use to improve the print layout if you don’t like the preview. I discuss these
in the following sections.
Macintoshes do not have the Print Preview feature. Furthermore, the Mac
version of Firefox uses the default Page Setup and Print windows, but extends
the Print window to offer Firefox-specific features. Most of the special format-
ting features discussed in this chapter, such as margin customization, are
found in the Print window on the Mac.
154
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 
All the page that’s fit to print
Web sites and paper don’t mix all that well. Web
sites are dynamic, linkable, animated, and com-
pletely unconstrained by space. Paper is . . .
well, paper. And when you try to print a Web site
on it, bad things can and often do happen.
Sometimes a seemingly brief article translates to
a dozen sheets of paper. Other times, the printed
version is too difficult to read because it’s sur-
rounded by silly ads that have lost their animated
vigor and are no longer clickable. Designing con-
tent for the screen just isn’t the same as design-
ing it for paper.
To bridge the gap, many Web sites offer special
print-friendly versions of their content that are
more amenable to the paper format. These 
versions typically remove surrounding ads,
enlarge text size, remove background colors
and images, and format the content into
columns to deliver a more magazine-like expe-
rience. Web sites offer print-friendly formats in
different ways. Some link to a separate page
from the original article, so you must click
through to the page and print that one instead.
Increasingly, however, Web sites are taking
advantage of a new browser feature that allows
them to specify a print format that automatically
takes effect when you print the original article.
In other words, you don’t need to look for a spe-
cial option — it just works.
A good rule is to use Print Preview to see how
a particular Web site will look on paper. If you
don’t like what you see, examine the Web site
to see whether it links to a print-friendly version.

Changing the scale of the page
If a Web site is too wide to fit comfortably on paper (like the one in Figure 12-2),
you can scale the page smaller, which is kind of like zooming out on a page
for printing purposes. When you print wide pages, Firefox automatically wraps
text so that it doesn’t get cut off. However, wrapping text can add many pages,
and you can avoid that by scaling the page smaller. Also, Firefox does not
automatically prevent images that are close to the margins on wide pages
from getting cut off. Scaling the page smaller can fix this as well.
If, on the other hand, a page has text too small to read comfortably on paper,
you can scale the page larger — the paper equivalent of zooming in.

Chapter 12: Printing Web Pages

Temporarily changing the text size of a Web page using the View➪Text Size
menu in the main Firefox window does not change the printed format of the
page, so don’t be surprised if Print Preview shows the page at its original text
size. However, changing the text size of all Web sites, as I discuss in Chapter 19,
does affect the printed page. If you don’t want to enlarge or reduce the text
size of all pages but want to change the text size of a particular page for print-
ing purposes, Print Preview’s scaling feature is the way to go.
To scale a page, simply open the Scale drop-down list in the Print Preview
window and select one of the following settings:
 A preset percentage: Choose a percentage below 100% to scale a page
smaller (I use 50% in Figure 12-3), above 100% to scale a page larger, or
100% to print the page at its current (original) size.
 Shrink to Fit: Select this option to automatically fit the page onto a stan-
dard 81⁄2-x-11-inch sheet of paper.

Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

If you decide to print on a nonstandard size of paper, such as a postcard
or legal-size page, you have to set up your printer to accommodate this.
The procedure for doing this varies depending on your printer, but typi-
cally you open the Firefox Print window, click the Properties button, and
then navigate to a paper size option. Shrinking your page works well
only if your printer knows the type of paper you’re using.
 Custom: Select this option to specify your own scaling percentage. You
can use any number, though anything over 200% usually makes the Web
page look like a large-print book on steroids.
These options are also available from the Page Setup window, which you can
access by clicking the Page Setup button in the Print Preview window. Some
features of the Page Setup window aren’t available directly from the Print
Preview interface, as I discuss later in this chapter.
Changing the orientation of the page
Suppose you’ve just found that 14-column table listing all the stats of your
favorite basketball team online, and you want to print it out for your own
Figure 12-3:
. . . but when
you scale it
down to
50%, it fits.
157
Chapter 12: Printing Web Pages

reference. The problem is every time you try to print the table, the right half
of the table gets cut off. You try the Shrink to Fit feature I discuss earlier, but
then it’s too small to read. What do you do?
Sometimes the image you want to print is too wide for a standard 81⁄2-x-11-inch
piece of paper, but the image will print fine when you turn that piece of 
paper on its side. This is reorienting the page. The tall orientation, which is
the default, is called Portrait, and the wide orientation is called Landscape.
Figures 12-4 and 12-5 illustrate the difference between the Portrait and
Landscape orientations.
To change the print orientation of a particular page, choose File➪Print
Preview in the main Firefox window to open the Print Preview window, and
then choose one of the following orientation buttons in the Print Preview
toolbar.
Portrait
By default, Print Preview shows the page in Portrait mode, meaning the short
side of the page (usually 81⁄2 inches) is at the top and bottom. This is how most
printing is done, as with a newspaper or newsletter. If you switch to Landscape
mode, you can return to Portrait mode by clicking the Portrait button.
Figure 12-4:
In Portrait
mode, you
see only half

158
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

Landscape
Sometimes you simply need to print something that’s wider than the stan-
dard 81⁄2 inches of a normal sheet of paper. To “turn” the page, click the
Landscape button. Note that if you select Landscape mode, you’ll wind up
with many more printed pages because less content fits on each page. You
can select which pages to print from the Print window.
You can also change the orientation setting from the Page Setup window, with-
out having to open Print Preview. To open the Page Setup window, choose
File➪Page Setup in the main Firefox window. However, changing this setting in
the Print Preview window allows you to preview a Web site in each orientation.
The orientation setting affects all Web sites you print, not just the Web site
you’re currently viewing.
Printing background colors and images
By default, Firefox doesn’t print background colors and images because
doing so can make pages more difficult to read, as well as using a tremendous
amount of ink. You can change this behavior from the Page Setup window by
following these steps:
Figure 12-5:

Chapter 12: Printing Web Pages

1. Choose File➪Page Setup in the main Firefox window to open the Page
Setup window.
The Page Setup window is also accessible via the Page Setup button in
the upper-left corner of the Print Preview window.
2. On the Format & Options tab, select the Print Background (Colors &
Images) check box.
3. Click OK.
This setting affects all Web sites you print, not just the Web site you’re cur-
rently viewing.
Changing margins, headers, and footers
Firefox includes information about Web sites you print in the top and bottom
margins (called the header and footer, respectively) of the printed page, such
as the site title, page number, and date. To make more room for the page itself,
you can shrink these margins. To include a more spacious border around the
page, you can enlarge the margins. You also can customize the information
that appears in the margins. Customization options include removing the title
and changing where the date appears.
To get to the Margins & Header/Footer options, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Page Setup.
2. Click the Margins & Header/Footer tab.
The following two sections discuss the options on this tab, which are
shown in Figure 12-6.
The Margins area
This area has four boxes that represent each of the margins on the page, as
shown in Figure 12-6. The default value for each of the margins is 0.5 (half an
inch), but you can change one or more of these. When you type in a new
value, the preview image adjusts to the new margin.
Most printers require a minimum amount of margin space, since they can’t
print right along the edge of a page. This requirement varies among printers,
and your printer’s instructions may indicate its particular requirements. To
be on the safe side, it’s a good idea to ensure that you have at least 0.2 inches
of margins on each side.
160
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

The Headers & Footers area
This area contains six drop-down lists that correspond to six positions on the
printed page. You can use these drop-down lists to change what appears in
each position. The first row of drop-down lists corresponds to the left, center,
and right positions of the header (the top margin), and the second row corre-
sponds to the left, center, and right positions of the footer (the bottom margin).
You can select from the following options to include in each position:
 --blank--: Shows nothing in this part of the page.
 Title: Shows the title of the Web page. This is the title that appears in
the main Firefox window’s title bar when you visit the page.
 URL: Shows the Web page’s address.
 Date/Time: Shows the date and time when the Web page was printed.
 Page #: Shows the page number of each page.
 Page # of #: Shows the page number along with the total number of
pages in the print job. For example, on the fifth page of a 30-page print
job, this area would show Page 5 of 30.
 Custom: Use this option when you want your own text to appear in the

one or more of the following codes to substitute some of the preset
pieces of information when you print:
• &D: Date/Time
• &P: Page Number

Configuring Print Options 
and Printing a Web Site
The Firefox Print window, accessible from the Print button in the Print
Preview window, allows you to choose which parts of a page to print, and
how many copies to print, as I discuss in the following section.
If you don’t want to preview a page before you print it or if you’re using a Mac,
you can bypass the Print Preview window and open the Print window directly
from the main Firefox window by choosing File➪Print. If you print frequently,
you can also add a Print button to one of your Firefox toolbars. See Chapter 18
for more information about toolbar customization.
Unfortunately, Firefox doesn’t currently allow you to use the Print Preview
feature to preview changes you make in the Print window. For example, 
if you use the Print Range feature in the Print window to determine which
pages to print, the Print Preview feature still shows you all the pages in
the Web page. The team and I hope to offer this functionality in a future
release.
Choosing which parts of a page to print
You can save plenty of time and paper by printing only the parts of a Web site
that you need. Of course, Web sites aren’t broken into traditional pages —
they just scroll on endlessly — so there are a handful of ways to specify a
part. Firefox allows you to specify which parts of a page to print in three
ways: with a page range, with a selection, and by indicating a certain frame. I
discuss each of these options in the following sections.
162
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

Printing by page range
The Print Preview feature, which I discuss at length earlier in this chapter,
allows you to see how a Web site will break down into pages when you print it.
When you know which pages of a Web site you need, follow these steps to
print them:
1. Open the Print window.
I provide instructions for doing so a bit earlier in this part of the chapter.
2. Under Print Range, select Pages and then enter the range of pages to
print.
The default print range is All, which, of course, prints the entire Web page.
3. Click Print to print the specified page range.
This setting takes effect on a site-by-site basis. In other words, changing the
page range for the site you’re currently printing doesn’t not affect pages you
print in the future.
Printing by selection
If you find it easier to specify a print range by highlighting the part of the
page you wish to print or if you want to print content that spans two pages
on a single page, use the print-by-selection method as follows:
1. Select (highlight) the portion of the page you want to print.
2. Open the Print window.
I provide instructions for doing so a bit earlier in this part of the chapter.
3. Under Print Range, select Selection.
4. Click Print to print the selection.
This setting takes effect on a site-by-site basis. In other words, choosing to
print a selection on the current site does not affect pages you print in the
future.
Printing by frame
Some Web sites are divided into box structures called frames. Each frame
actually contains a separate Web site. Web sites use this when they need to
aggregate two or more Web sites into a single presentation. For example, the
online resource site About.com includes links to thousands of external Web
sites (Web sites outside of the About.com network) about all sorts of topics.
Rather than linking you directly to an external Web site, About.com loads the
163
Chapter 12: Printing Web Pages

Web site in a frame and inserts its own frame at the top of the page that links
you back to About.com. This helps keep you in the About.com network, so
you can move on to other topical pages discovered by About.com if the cur-
rent page doesn’t meet your needs.
Unfortunately, About.com also includes an advertisement in its top frame, as
you can see in Figure 12-7. By default, Firefox prints all frames in a framed
Web site, just as they’re laid out on the screen. This means the printed page
will have an ugly advertisement at the top. Luckily, Firefox allows you to print
just a particular frame, or to print each frame separately.
Follow these steps to print a particular frame:
1. Select the frame you want to print by clicking an empty space within it.
In other words, don’t click a link. There’s no visual identification of
which frame is selected, but Firefox knows.
2. Open the Print window.
I provided instructions for doing so a bit earlier in this part of the chapter.
Figure 12-7:
On framed
pages, you
can pick
which frame
to print. In
this case,
you can
avoid
printing the
ad at the top
by printing
only the
bottom
frame.
164
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

3. Under Print Frames, select The Selected Frame.
The default option is As Laid Out on the Screen, which prints the Web
site just as it appears to you on the screen.
4. Click Print to print the selected frame.
Another way to print just a particular frame is to isolate the frame — in other
words, load the Web site displayed in the frame by itself. You do this in
Firefox by right-clicking the frame, selecting the This Frame submenu in the
contextual menu that appears, and then choosing Show Only This Frame. The
Web site in the frame loads separately, and then you can print the page nor-
mally, just like any other. This feature is also handy when you want to read
the frame by itself on the screen.
If you’d rather print each frame individually, follow these steps:
1. Open the Print window.
I provide instructions for doing so a bit earlier in this part of the chapter.
2. Under Print Frames, choose Each Frame Separately.
The default option is As Laid Out on the Screen, which prints the Web
site just as it appears to you on the screen.
3. Click Print to print each frame individually.
The Print Frames options are available only if the Web site you’re trying to
print is using frames. To quickly determine whether a page is using frames,
and thus whether you can use the print by frame method, right-click any-
where on the page. If the contextual menu includes a This Frame option, as
shown in Figure 12-8, the page is using frames.
New Web design techniques are making frames obsolete, so you will see
fewer and fewer Web sites using them as time goes by. Some Web sites that
appear to be using frames might actually be using a newer technique instead.
Printing multiple copies of a page
By default, Firefox prints a single copy of a Web site, but you can print as
many copies as you need. This feature comes in handy if, for example, you
need to pass out a copy of the Web site to everyone on your team at work.
To print multiple copies of a Web site, follow these steps:
1. Open the Print window.
I provide instructions for doing so a bit earlier in this part of the chapter.
165
Chapter 12: Printing Web Pages

2. Under Copies, enter the number of copies you want to print.
3. If you want to print the copies in a collated fashion, select the Collate
check box.
Collation affects only multipaged print jobs. By default, Firefox prints all
the copies of each page in a multipaged Web site in order. For example, if
you’re printing five copies of a three-paged Web site, Firefox prints five
copies of page 1, then five copies of page 2, and finally five copies of
page 3. If you collate the copies, Firefox prints entire copies of the Web
site at a time. In this example, Firefox prints page 1, then page 2, then
page 3, and repeats that five times. Figures 12-9 and 12-10 illustrate the
difference between non-collated and collated printing. Collation is handy
because when all copies finish printing, they’re already in sets. Without
collation, you have to reconstruct each copy of the Web site manually.
4. Click Print to print the indicated number of copies.

If you plan to print a lot of pages in black and white, you might want to con-
sider buying a laser printer. Although they’re more expensive than traditional
ink jet printers, they print much more quickly.
Changing page size and other 
printer-specific options
Many printers offer additional formatting options beyond those offered by
Firefox, which I discuss in this chapter. For example, certain printers allow
you to specify different paper sizes or qualities and automatically optimize
printing for those conditions.

The best way to determine what your printer supports is to consult its
manual or simply to look in the Print window and see. (In Windows, you
might need to click a Properties button in the window to access the printer-
specific options.) I provide instructions for opening the Print window earlier
in this chapter.

Chapter 13
Finding Additional Help
In This Chapter
 Navigating Firefox’s built-in help
 Finding help documentation online
 Using the support forums
I
’ve tried to make this book a comprehensive resource, but there are some
things I just can’t cover. I can’t, for example, provide in-depth help on each
of the hundreds of Firefox extensions (see Chapter 20). This chapter gives
you some invaluable (and mostly free) resources you can turn to when you
need additional help, not least of which is my own e-mail address.
Using the Help Window
The best place to start when you have a question I haven’t answered in this
book is Firefox’s own built-in help feature. Although the feature is intended to
offer quick-and-dirty answers rather than a comprehensive guide, it might
have the answer you’re searching for.
To open the Help Window, choose Help➪Help Contents, or press F1 in
Windows.
The Help window, as shown in Figure 13-1, opens to a welcome screen on the
right side and an expandable list of help topics on the left. This list serves as
the digital Table of Contents and is your primary means of navigation. The
window also contains a Search text box in the upper-right corner that you
can use to find a particular topic quickly. I discuss the Table of Contents and
the search feature in the following two sections.

Browsing the Table of Contents
The Table of Contents contains a list of broad topics, such as Using the
Download Manager and Customization. Most topics contain more specific
subtopics, as indicated by a plus sign (+) next to the topic name. To see a
topic’s subtopics, click the plus sign. To view help on a particular topic,
simply click it, and the help documentation appears on the right side of the
window.
When you’re reading the help documentation for a particular topic, you
might encounter a link to a related topic. These links work just like regular
Web site links; click them to go directly to the related topic’s documentation.
Then you can use the Back and Forward buttons in the help window to move
among the two, just as you do with regular Web sites in the main Firefox
window.
From time to time, help documents might also link you to real Web sites that
open in a regular Firefox window. These links are marked with a globe icon.
See the Using the Help Window topic for more tips and tricks on using the
help window. This is the first topic in the table of contents, and it’s also
linked from the help window’s welcome screen, which appears by default
when you open the help window. If you’re switching from the Internet
Explorer browser, I also recommend the For Internet Explorer Users topic to
ease the transition. This topic is linked directly from Help➪For Internet
Explorer Users in the main Firefox window.

Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

Searching for a particular topic
If you’re looking for help with a particular topic, you’ll probably find it faster
to search for the topic directly rather than browsing the Table of Contents.
Simply type part or all of the topic into the Search Box in the upper-right
corner of the window. When you stop typing, Firefox searches for the topic
and displays a list of matching results in a new Search Sidebar (on the left
side of the window) that takes the place of the Table of Contents, as shown in
Figure 13-2. Click a result topic to view the associated help documentation,
just as you do with the Table of Contents.
When you find the help you need, click the red X in the corner of the Search
Sidebar to close it. After you close the sidebar, the Table of Contents returns.
You can also shrink or hide the sidebar temporarily by dragging the gray 
line — that separates the sidebar and the content — to the left. To reopen it,
drag the gray line — which is now flush with the left edge of the window —
back to the right.
The search feature isn’t a full-text search, which means it doesn’t search the
help documentation itself. It searches only the help topics themselves. The
best way to find help with a particular topic is to search for a succinct key-
word that describes it. For more tips, see the Search Tips subtopic under the
Using the Help Window topic, which is the first topic in the Table of Contents.

Chapter 13: Finding Additional Help

Getting Help on the Web
If you can’t find the answer you need in Firefox’s built-in help, the Web offers
two types of resources you can try. The first is a collection of walkthroughs,
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), and other documentation you can use to
help yourself. The second is an online discussion forum where experienced
Firefox users can usually walk you through the proper solution. I discuss
both types of resources in the following sections.
Finding help documents online
Here are some of my favorite online resources:
 The MozillaZine Knowledge Base: Though not officially affiliated with the
Mozilla Foundation, MozillaZine (www.mozillazine.org) is an excellent
community news and support site. One of its best features is a so-called
knowledge base, a community-edited and -maintained resource. The
knowledge base contains a list of the most common trouble spots in
Firefox (with solutions, of course!), a comprehensive Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQs) page, and a bevy of tips and tricks. The knowledge base
is available at http://kb.mozillazine.org/Mozilla_Firefox.
 An Introduction to Mozilla Firefox: A Web site called Open Source
Articles offers a complete walkthrough of Firefox in a dozen different lan-
guages, complete with full-color screenshots. The walkthrough is available
at http://opensourcearticles.com/introduction_to_firefox.
 The Official Firefox Support Site: The Mozilla Foundation maintains an
official Firefox support page that contains useful links to external help
sites (including the other two sites in this list), as well as some original
content of its own. The official support page is available at
www.mozilla.org/support/firefox.
Using the support forums
If you have a question that you can’t solve yourself by examining Firefox’s
built-in help or the online resources I list in the preceding section, you can
turn to the vibrant and growing Firefox user community for help. Before
doing so, see the sidebar in this chapter, “A word on netiquette.”
172
Part II: Ready, Aim, Firefox 

A Web site called MozillaZine serves as the online home of Firefox’s user com-
munity. MozillaZine is not officially affiliated with the Mozilla Foundation and
offers the latest Firefox news, a comprehensive knowledge base (as I mention
in the preceding section), and a set of discussion forums where anyone can
ask a Firefox question (like the one shown in Figure 13-3). If you’ve already
checked the knowledge base and the other online resources I list in the pre-
ceding section, your best bet is to ask your question in the MozillaZine
Mozilla Firefox Support forum.
173
Chapter 13: Finding Additional Help
A word on netiquette
The Firefox user community is comprised of
Firefox’s most advanced users and serves as an
invaluable help resource. These users are not
paid for their efforts, and it’s important to show
them the same respect they are showing you in
trying to answer your question. Aside from
normal conventions of etiquette, you should
abide by some additional netiquette rules when
seeking help in the community.
 Try not to ask a question that is already
answered in Firefox’s built-in help, in the
online help sites, or most importantly, in the
forums themselves. Forum helpers get
many of the same questions again and
again, and understandably get frustrated at
having to answer repeatedly. Use the forum
search feature to see whether your ques-
tion has already been addressed. Many
years and hundreds of thousands of forum
posts are archived, so there’s a good
chance it’s been answered already. Still,
don’t kill yourself trying to find it. If a search
doesn’t uncover it within ten minutes or so,
don’t feel bad about asking the forum users.
 If you do decide to create a new forum post
with your question, make sure you create
it in the right forum, which is the Mozilla
Firefox Support forum under the User
Support heading on MozillaZine. If you put
your question in the wrong forum, users of
that forum are going to be upset by the
intrusion and will be less likely to help you
or redirect you to the right place.
 Don’t post your question multiple times.
Because forum helpers are volunteering
their free time, it might take a few days to
get a response, though it usually doesn’t. If
you don’t get a response, that probably just
means the forum helpers don’t know the
answer; asking again isn’t likely to help.
 Don’t use all capital letters when posting
your question. Doing so is the online equiv-
alent of shouting, even if that was not your
intent.
 Consider registering for a MozillaZine
account, which takes just a minute or two,
if you intend to return to the forums in the
future. Although you can post to the support
forums without a username, forum helpers
are more likely to help when they can match
a persona to a question. If you frequent the
forums and follow these simple rules of
netiquette, you’ll quickly earn a positive rep-
utation among forum helpers, and they’ll be
more willing to help you.

To get to the forum, go to http://forums.mozillazine.org and click
Mozilla Firefox Support, the very first forum in the list. There, you can create
a new discussion thread by clicking the Create New Topic link at the top of
the screen. You don’t need to create an account to post, although doing so
might be a good idea, as I discuss in the sidebar, “A word on netiquette.” I
also discuss in that sidebar why you should search the forums for your ques-
tion before posting.
E-mailing Blake
If you still can’t find the answer you’re looking for, please don’t hesitate to
e-mail me at blake@firefox.com. It takes me a little (okay, a lot of) time,
but I do respond to every e-mail.

H

Internet, you expose yourself to millions of poten-
tial hackers. Here’s a scarier thought: Most of them are 
12 years old! Just think what they’ll be able to do when
they’re older. What’s a person to do?
This part outlines what you need to know and do to stay
safe online, as well as how to secure personal informa-
tion like browsing history from prying eyes. But Firefox
wouldn’t be much of a browser if it left you to fend for
yourself, so I also tell you about the steps Firefox takes 
to protect you. Those 12-year-old twerps don’t stand a

I
t’s your tenth anniversary. Your spouse turns to you inquisitively and
says, “I’m sorry, and you are?”
It wasn’t all that long ago that computers were equally rude. So-called dumb
terminals knew nothing about the person in front of them and had to keep
asking the same question day in and day out: “I’m sorry, and you are?”
Thankfully, you live in the personal computing era. And what’s the use in
having a computer if there’s nothing personal about it? Life is hard, and com-
puters make it easier by remembering information about you so you don’t
have to keep entering it.
As possibly the most-used program on your computer, your Web browser in
particular needs to keep track of all sorts of information: your usernames,
passwords, where you downloaded stuff, and the complicated addresses of
sites you visit frequently. Can you imagine if you had to remember everything
on your own? Human brains just weren’t designed to store the Internet (and
the Firefox developers haven’t yet acquired the licensing to redesign them).
Trustworthy technologies, of course, keep you in control of your private
information at all times. Firefox gives you control over just how much infor-
mation you want Firefox to remember about you and allows you to wipe the
slate clean at any time. Also keep in mind that none of the information Firefox
stores about you is accessible via the Internet; it all remains on your own
computer.

Using the Clear Private Data Feature
Firefox stores a variety of information while you browse, such as your brows-
ing history, your download history, and the online forms you fill out. Each
piece of information is stored to make your browsing experience more conve-
nient. Download history, for example, is maintained so that you can easily
find and open the files you download. Although this kind of memory is conve-
nient, you will probably want to clear it frequently if other people use your
computer (such as family members or co-workers) so that no one can invade
your privacy.
The easiest way to clear stored information in Firefox is by using the Clear
Private Data mechanism. The feature is simple but powerful. First, you spec-
ify which kinds of information you want to clear regularly, such as browsing
history and saved form entries. Then, every time you use the feature —
which I discuss in the following steps — that type of information is cleared,
but other types (such as download history, in this case) remain intact.
To configure and use the Clear Private Data feature, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Clear Private Data.
The Clear Private Data window appears, as shown in Figure 14-1. This
window contains a list of information that Firefox stores (for example,
“Saved Form Information”). See “Working One-on-One with Your Data”
later in this chapter for specific coverage of each type of information.
If you’re on Windows, you can press Ctrl+Shift+Del to open the Clear
Private Data window quickly. (There’s no keyboard shortcut for
Macintosh users.)
2. Select each type of information you want to clear and make sure all
other types are deselected.
If a particular option is grayed out (and thus not selectable), Firefox cur-
rently has no information of that type stored about you, and you don’t
need to clear it.
I discuss the first six types of information listed in this window in the
section “Working One-on-One with Your Data,” later in this chapter. The
seventh, Authenticated Sessions, is technical jargon that refers to infor-
mation that Firefox remembers for a particular session (a session begins
when you start Firefox and ends when you close it), such as your
Amazon.com shopping cart items. Although Firefox automatically for-
gets this information when a Firefox session ends, you might want to
clear it manually (without having to shut down Firefox) when you walk
away from your computer (especially if others share your computer),
which is why this option is available.
178
Part III: Outfoxing Hackers 

3. Click Clear Private Data Now to clear the information you indicated.
This action is permanent and irreversible, and you will not have a
chance to confirm the decision after you click the button.
The Clear Private Data feature clears only the information Firefox has already
stored. New information continues to accrue unless you tell Firefox to stop
storing it altogether. I outline how to do this for each type of information in
“Working One-on-One with Your Data” later in this chapter.
Bypassing the Clear Private Data window
At the bottom of the Clear Private Data window is a mysterious check box
that says Ask Me Before Clearing Private Data, and it is selected by default. 
If you deselect this option, choosing Tools➪Clear Private Data (or pressing
Ctrl+Shift+Del on Windows; there is no Mac shortcut) clears whichever types
of information you had previously selected immediately and silently. In other
words, you won’t be offered the Clear Private Data window or any other con-
firmation. This option is intended for people who clear their information reg-
ularly and want to avoid the window every time.
The Clear Private Data window remembers your decision regarding the Ask
Me Before Clearing Private Data check box even if you press the Cancel
button. Thus, you should make sure the check box is selected or deselected,
depending on your preference, when you close the window.
If you decide to bypass the window and later want to turn it back on or
change exactly which tracks are cleared each time, you can still access the
Clear Private Data settings window from the Firefox Options window:
Figure 14-1:
The Clear
Private Data

3. Click the Settings button at the bottom of the window to open the

4. Select the Ask Me Before Clearing Private Data check box.
5. Click OK.
6. Click OK to close the Options window.
Can’t remember whether you set the preference to bypass the Clear Private
Data window? Well, you certainly don’t want to try the option and see
whether or not the window appears — because if it doesn’t, your information
just got cleared! Instead, open the Tools menu and examine the Clear Private
Data option. If it ends in an ellipsis, you have not bypassed the confirmation
window, and it appears when you use the feature. If it doesn’t . . . the window
is bypassed. Figures 14-2 and 14-3 show the difference.

Clearing private data when Firefox closes
With the window-bypassing feature I describe in the preceding section, clear-
ing your tracks in Firefox is as easy as choosing a menu item or (on Windows)
pressing a few keys. But if you’re very privacy-conscious, that might not be
enough. After all, as easy as it is to clear your data, you still have to remem-
ber to do it. What if you forget?
If you want, you can tell Firefox to clear some or all of your private data each
time it shuts down:
1. Choose Tools➪Options to open the Options window.
2. Click the Privacy icon at the top of the window.
3. Click the Settings button at the bottom of the window to open the
Clear Private Data settings window.
4. Select the types of information that Firefox should clear on shutdown,
and ensure that all other types are deselected.
5. Select the Clear Private Data When Closing Firefox check box.
6. Click OK.
7. Click OK to close the Options window.
Working One-on-One with Your Data
The Clear Private Data feature is great for people who always find themselves
clearing the same set of information — say, download history and browsing
history, but not saved passwords or form information. But the feature just
doesn’t do the trick if your habits are irregular or if you need more specific
control over each type of stored information (such as choosing how many
days’ worth of browsing history to maintain). In either case, the Options
window provides more powerful tools for working closely with each kind of
information that Firefox remembers:
1. Choose Tools➪Options to open the Options window.
2. Click the Privacy icon at the top of the window.
3. Click the tab that corresponds to the type of information you want to
configure.
Figure 14-4 shows the six tabs that are available.
When you reach the tab pertaining to the kind of information you want to
configure, refer to the appropriate section that follows for further help.

Chapter 14: Clearing Your Tracks

Erasing your browsing history
As I discuss in Chapter 6, Firefox keeps a record of the Web sites you visit so
you can find them later if you forget their addresses. This is called browsing
history, and by default, Firefox stores records of all the Web sites you visited
in the past nine days. To configure or clear browsing history, follow the direc-
tions in the preceding section, “Working One-on-One with Your Data,” to get
to the History tab of the Options window. From there, you can do any of the
following:
 Shorten or expand how many days’ worth of Web sites Firefox remem-
bers in browsing history by replacing 9 with a new number.
 Instruct Firefox not to remember browsing history anymore by replac-
ing 9 with 0. Firefox won’t track any Web sites you visit in the future, but
your current browsing history remains until you clear it.
 Clear your current browsing history by clicking the Clear Browsing
History Now button. Firefox clears the history as soon as you click the
button and the action is irreversible. Note that this doesn’t turn off
browsing history; it only clears your current history. New history 
accumulates when you resume surfing. If the Clear Browsing History
button is unavailable, your browsing history is already empty.

Getting rid of old saved forms
As I discuss in Chapter 8, Firefox remembers information you enter into
Web sites so you don’t need to keep reentering it. For example, it can remem-
ber your username at a site you log in to frequently, or your ZIP code at a
weather site. Firefox also remembers phrases you enter into the Firefox
Search Box so you can use them again more quickly. Collectively, this is
called saved form information, and by default, Firefox remembers it indefi-
nitely. To configure or clear saved form information, follow the directions in
the section “Working One-on-One with Your Data,” earlier in this chapter, to
get to the Saved Forms tab of the Options window. From there, you can do
any of the following:
 Instruct Firefox not to remember form information anymore by dese-
lecting the Save Information I Enter in Forms and the Search Bar check
box. As the wording implies, if you choose this option, Firefox also stops
remembering phrases you search for in the Search Box in the upper-
right corner of the main Firefox window.
 Clear your current Saved Form Information by clicking the Clear Saved
Form Data Now button. This takes place as soon as you click the button
and is irreversible. Note that this doesn’t turn off saved form informa-
tion; it only clears the currently stored information. New form informa-
tion accrues the next time you submit an online form or use the Search
Box. If the Clear Saved Form Data Now button is unavailable, no form
information is currently saved.
Saved form information doesn’t include passwords you enter into online
forms; those are stored separately, as I discuss in the next section.
More information about the automatic form-filling feature is available in
Chapter 8.
Keeping your saved passwords safe
Firefox remembers passwords you use to log in to secure sites on the
Internet (after asking you) so you don’t need to enter them every time you
log in. These are known as saved passwords, and by default, Firefox remem-
bers them indefinitely. To configure or clear saved passwords, follow the
directions in the section “Working One-on-One with Your Data,” earlier in this
chapter, to get to the Passwords tab of the Options window. From there, you
can do any of the following:
183
Chapter 14: Clearing Your Tracks

 Instruct Firefox not to remember passwords anymore, by deselecting
the Remember Passwords check box.
 Set, change, or remove a Master Password. If family members or 
co-workers share your computer, you might find it disconcerting that
Firefox automatically prefills your passwords for them. On the other
hand, the feature is convenient when you are at your computer. Firefox
offers a feature called Master Password that lets you enjoy both security
and convenience. See the section on using a Master Password in Chapter
8 for more information about this feature.
 View the passwords Firefox has collected thus far, by choosing the
View Saved Passwords button. If Firefox has prefilled your password for
so long you’ve actually forgotten it, this is a good way to retrieve it! The
window that opens contains a table of Web sites and the usernames you
use at each site, as shown in Figure 14-5. To see your passwords at all
sites, click the Show Passwords button to add a new Password column.
If you have a Master Password, you need to enter it before you can
access the stored passwords even if you’ve entered it previously.
Otherwise, Firefox asks you to confirm the decision. Make sure nobody
is looking over your shoulder before you proceed. To hide your pass-
words again, click the Hide Passwords button. See the section on view-
ing and clearing saved login information in Chapter 8 for more in-depth
help with this feature.
 Clear some or all of the stored passwords. Click the View Saved
Passwords button, select the sites whose saved passwords you want to
clear, and click Remove. Otherwise, to remove all saved passwords, click
Remove All. These actions take effect immediately and are irreversible.
Note that this doesn’t turn off the password-saving feature; it only clears
the current list of passwords.
 Instruct Firefox that it’s okay to prefill passwords at a particular site
where you previously indicated otherwise. When you enter a password at a
Web site Firefox hasn’t seen before, you can decide whether Firefox should
remember the password and prefill it later. If you choose No, Firefox will
continue to ask you each time you log in to the site. To minimize distrac-
tions, a third option, Never for This Site, allows you to tell Firefox that you
never want it to remember passwords you enter on that particular Web site
(which is useful if, for example, it’s a banking site), and to stop asking you.
To reverse this decision later on, click the View Saved Passwords
button on the Privacy tab, and then click the Passwords Never Saved
tab. Firefox displays a list of Web sites for which you have told it never
to ask you about saving. To remove a particular site, select it and click
Remove. To clear the entire list, click Remove All. After you remove a
site from this list, Firefox will ask you again whether to save the pass-
word the next time you try to log in to the site.
More information about Saved Passwords is available in Chapter 8.

Tidying up your download history
As I discuss in Chapter 11, Firefox keeps a record of the files you download so
you can access them easily. This is known as download history, and by default,
Firefox keeps records of all your downloads until you clear them manually. Note
that these are simply records of the download itself; clearing a download record
doesn’t affect the downloaded file that exists on your computer. To configure or
clear download history, follow the directions in the earlier section, “Working
One-on-One with Your Data,” to get to the Download History tab of the Privacy 
category of the Options window. From there, you can do any of the following:
 Specify when the download history is cleared by using the Remove
Files from the Download Manager drop-down list. By default, download
records remain until you clear them manually, with the Download
Manager, the Clear Private Data feature, or the Clear Download History
Now button in the Options window. However, you can also instruct
Firefox to clear a download record as soon as the corresponding download
completes (by selecting Upon Successful Download), or each time you
exit Firefox (by selecting When Firefox Exits). Note that if you choose the
latter, the new policy begins immediately; in other words, your existing
download history will be cleared as soon as you exit Firefox.
 View your download history in the Download Manager by clicking the
View Download History button. The Download Manager is also accessi-
ble from the Tools menu in the main Firefox window.

 Clear the entire download history by clicking the Clear Download
History Now button. This takes place as soon as you click the button
and is irreversible. Note that this doesn’t turn off download history; it
only clears the currently stored records. New download records accrue
as you start new downloads. If the Clear Download History Now button
is unavailable, your download history is already empty.
You can clear individual download records from the Download Manager
window. For more on the Download Manager as well as anything else related
to how Firefox downloads anything off the Internet, turn to Chapter 11.
Sweeping up your cookie crumbs
Billions of different Web sites exist, each serving a different purpose. Although
Firefox can help you remember aspects that are common to many of them —
such as the concept of a username and password — it is impossible for Firefox
to remember the information necessary for each Web site genre. For example,
what about a shopping site that needs to remember what’s in your shopping
cart as you navigate the digital aisles? What about an online newspaper that
wants to remember that you like the sports page? If the other Firefox develop-
ers and I spent our time designing a custom “memory” for anything a Web site
might need to store, we wouldn’t have time for anything else.
Clearly, then, Web sites need their own (generic) way to remember informa-
tion about you, and the mechanism for doing this is called a cookie. A Web
site can leave a cookie — a brief bit of information — on your computer, and
your browser sends it back to the site when you return to that site. It’s as if
the Web site is temporarily storing a tiny memory on your computer.
To prevent your computer from getting cluttered up with these memories,
most Web sites owners give their cookies expiration dates. By default,
Firefox — like virtually all other browsers — allows all Web sites to set cook-
ies and keeps them until they expire. But Firefox gives you extensive control
over which cookies are set and for how long they are kept.
You can impose more restrictions on which sites are allowed to set cookies,
with the understanding that certain Web sites might not function properly
without them.
To configure or clear cookies, follow the directions in the section “Working
One-on-One with Your Data,” earlier in this chapter, to get to the Cookies tab
of the Options window. From there, you can do any of the following:
186
Part III: Outfoxing Hackers 

 To prevent all Web sites from setting a cookie, deselect the Allow Sites
to Set Cookies check box. You can specify an exception to this rule by
clicking the Exceptions button, entering a Web address, and clicking
Allow. To undo this decision later, return to the Exceptions window,
select the Web site in the list, and click Remove. I cover the Exceptions
window in more detail in Chapter 16.
 To prevent certain Web sites from setting a cookie, leave the Allow
Sites to Set Cookies check box selected, but click the Exceptions button,
enter the address of a Web site, and then click the Block button. To undo
this decision later, return to the Exceptions window, select the Web site
in the list, and click Remove.
 To prevent so-called affiliates from setting cookies, select the For the
Originating Site Only check box. An affiliate is a Web site that lives
within another Web site but is not actually part of it. Though you don’t
realize it, most of the Web sites you visit every day contain affiliates in
the form of advertising. Most of the banner ads you see, for example, are
not actually part of the Web site that contains them, but are generated
by a third-party advertising firm. Because these are another form of Web
sites, they can also set their own cookies, and most of these cookies are
used for undesirable purposes such as tracking your viewing habits as
you move among other Web sites in the ad’s network.
Allowing only the originating site — and not affiliates — to set cookies is
a good way to ensure that Web sites continue to work while preventing
affiliate advertisers from storing cookies.
 To prevent Web sites you’ve dealt with previously from setting more
cookies, select the Unless I Have Removed Cookies Set by the Site check
box. In this context, dealt with means you’ve taken the trouble in the
past to manually delete cookies set by the Web site by using the Cookie
Manager. Such drastic and specific action probably means the Web site
did something untrustworthy in your eyes. This option allows you to
automatically block cookies from all such Web sites in the future so you
don’t need to waste time doing so manually.
From the Cookies tab, you can also view, search, and remove stored cookies
by clicking the View Cookies button. The Cookie Manager opens to offer
information about the cookies on your computer, organized into groups by
the Web site who stored them, as shown in Figure 14-6. To find a cookie more
quickly, you can enter part of its name or originating site address into the
Search text box. To view information about a particular cookie, select it and
look at the bottom of the screen. Most of the supplied information is of a
highly technical and irrelevant nature, but you can also take a look at when
the cookie is set to expire. If you aren’t happy with what you see, you can
manually remove the cookie by clicking Remove Cookie. You can also remove
all stored cookies by clicking Remove All Cookies. Note that both actions take
place as soon as you click their respective buttons, and you can’t undo a
removal.

Chapter 14: Clearing Your Tracks

Clearing your cache
You want to go to a new restaurant in town, so you call for directions. It’s so
good that you decide to go there every night. Are you going to call for the
directions every night? Probably not. At some point, the head waiter is going
to recognize your voice and ask why on earth you keep calling — the restau-
rant isn’t moving!
You would, of course, write the directions down or commit them to memory.
In the digital world, the idea that you can make copies of information instead
of constantly returning to the source is known as caching. Technical details
aside, caching allows Firefox to make copies of Web sites you visit frequently
and store them on your computer so they load more quickly. When you
instruct Firefox to visit a Web site, it simply compares the version stored on
your computer with the current version. If they’re the same, it saves time by
loading the Web site directly off your computer.
By default, Firefox caches the last 50MB worth of Web sites that you visit
onto your computer.
To configure or clear the cache, follow the directions in the section “Working
One-on-One with Your Data,” earlier in this chapter, to get to the Cache tab of
the Options window. From there, you can do any of the following:
Figure 14-6:

Part III: Outfoxing Hackers 

 Increase or reduce the amount of hard drive space Firefox uses to
store cached Web sites on your computer by entering a new number in
place of 50. Most computers these days have so much hard drive space
that 50MB is but a tiny fraction, so you probably shouldn’t worry about
reducing this number. If you have available hard drive space, enlarging
the number improves page-load performance because Firefox can cache
more sites.
A megabyte (MB) is a technical unit of measurement used to describe
how much space something uses on a computer. Many computers these
days have at least 20 gigabytes (GB) of space, which — because a giga-
byte roughly equals 1,000MB — is equivalent to about 20,000MB.
 Clear the current cache by clicking the Clear Cache Now button. This
action takes place as soon as you click the button and is irreversible.
Note that this doesn’t turn off the cache; it clears only the currently
cached sites. New cached Web sites accrue as soon as you begin surfing.
If the Clear Cache Now button is unavailable, your cache is already
empty.

ecurity alerts come and go with the tide, and even the most leisurely of
activities is marred by new vigilance. Unfortunately, the Internet offers
little escape. Every day, hackers determine new ways to relieve unwitting
users of their passwords, credit card information, and other key credentials.
Identity theft might seem hard to pull off to common folk like you and me, 
but the reality is that it usually begins with a single online password being
guessed or stolen.
Firefox is determined to give you the smoothest possible online experience,
and security is no exception. Still, your security online ultimately rests in
your hands. This chapter outlines the safeguards Firefox includes and offers
recommendations for how you can protect yourself best.
Phishing, Pharming, and Phriends
Perhaps more frustrating than the online attacks themselves is that each one
has its own technical alias. You don’t have to know the lingo to stay safe, but
it’s helpful to speak the same language as the security organizations that are
working on your behalf.

Phishing: Don’t get hooked!
One of the most popular types of attacks today falls under a category known
as phishing. Phishers bait unsuspecting users into divulging their passwords
by creating perfect replicas (known as spoofs) of popular Web sites. One of
the most common victims of phishing, for example, is eBay (see Figures 15-1
and 15-2). Every year, hundreds of phishers set up fake versions of the
renowned auction site and notify customers that, for whatever reason, they
need to click a link (that loads a fake replica of eBay) and enter their eBay
login information. As soon as a customer does, his username and password
are sent to the owner of the fake eBay, who can then use it on the real eBay.
Phishing scams are prevalent because they’re successful, and they’re success-
ful because they’re nearly impossible to detect. Some phishers are plain lazy
and create error-ridden pages that no professional company would churn out,
but sophisticated phishers can create look-alikes that mimic legitimate Web
sites down to the pixel. The e-mails they send appear to come from respected
addresses such as support@ebay.com or accounts@citibank.com. There
are, however, a few precious aspects of legitimate Web sites that fakes can’t
duplicate. Phishers aren’t expecting you to recognize these aspects, but these
so-called untouchables are your window to safety, as I outline in the next few
sections.

Part III: Outfoxing Hackers 

Even the most experienced computer users fall prey to well-crafted phishing
scams. Keep these tips in mind while surfing and be sure to review your bank
statements regularly for unusual charges, just in case a hacker gets past your
guard.
Don’t believe what you read
Most identify thefts begin with a phishing scam, and most phishing scams
begin with an e-mail or an instant message that appears to come from a rep-
utable source (see Figure 15-3). These messages exist to convince you that
you absolutely, positively must click a link and enter in your personal infor-
mation immediately. Phishers have concocted a dizzying array of explana-
tions: Your information was lost; you might have won a contest; you need to
verify that your information is current; your account will be closed; and so
on. Although the messages often look professional and seem to come from
legitimate addresses, the links they contain take you to the hacker’s replica.
Most legitimate Web sites never ask you for your personal information by
e-mail or instant message. After all, why would they need to? They already
have your information. Powerhouses like eBay don’t take chances on losing
user information: They back it up several times over in their own databases.
And, I’m sorry, but you probably didn’t win a contest. (Did you even enter one?)

Being anti-social isn’t such a bad thing
I spend most of this chapter — and most of my
programming career — examining the technical
ways in which your online security can be vio-
lated. However, studies have shown that hack-
ers often don’t need complex algorithms and
supercomputers; all they need is a telephone and
a friendly voice. In an increasingly popular attack
called social engineering, hackers call up their
would-be victims and cajole the needed infor-
mation out of them. Sometimes they say they’re
from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and
that they need your password or your Internet
will be disconnected. Other times they claim
they’re calling on behalf of the bank or a popular
site such as eBay. Whatever the guise, the end
game is always the same: Convince you to
divulge your personal information to a stranger
who sounds friendly and authoritative.
What makes social engineering scary is that the
best computer tools aren’t going to protect you.
What makes it scarier is that even if you are
aware of this attack and know not to fall for it,
your private information can still be socially
engineered out of those you entrust to protect
your information. That’s because hackers don’t
just play the ISP or the bank in this sick charade;
sometimes they call your ISP or bank and play
you. In this scenario, the hacker doesn’t play the
friendly, authoritative company official. He plays
the angry, exasperated user whose password is
being rejected online. The hope is that if he acts
frustrated enough, the company will divulge or
reset your password even though the hacker
can’t properly verify his (your!) identity.
The best way to protect yourself against social
engineering is to be aware of the scheme and
to ensure that the companies who hold the keys
to your identity, such as your ISP and your bank,
are also aware. Confirm that your ISP’s and
bank’s policies forbid employees from divulging
your information over the phone or by e-mail to
people who can’t authenticate themselves, no
matter how frustrated or angry they get.

Chapter 15: Staying Safe Online
Don’t worry: You aren’t alone
When you read about all the devious schemes I
describe in this chapter, it’s easy to believe that
it’s you and your computer against a sea of bril-
liant hackers. The truth is that in the fight against
hackers, you have some very powerful allies. The
world’s largest corporations — and not just those
in the computer industry — have some very good
reasons to win the war. First of all, these schemes
cost some companies tens of millions of dollars
every year. When a thief splurges with your credit
card, for example, your bank typically foots the
bill. And that’s just the direct monetary cost. What
about the harm done to a company’s brand and
reputation when a phisher posing as a company
official steals your password?
Many companies have set up e-mail addresses
or phone numbers you can use to report hacker
solicitations. For example, if you receive an
e-mail that appears to be from eBay and directs
you to a Web site that asks for your password,
forward it to spoof@ebay.com. Table 15-1
lists the companies that are most often targeted
by phishers, as well as the e-mail address to
use when you receive a phishing scam.
It’s important (and comforting) to realize that
companies like eBay aren’t kidding around. If
the company catches a hacker, it doesn’t send
him a warning notice; it sends him to jail, in col-
laboration with local authorities.

Know where you are
The links in phishing e-mails and instant messages rarely display an address
such as http://www.ebay.com. Rather, they generally offer enticing text
like Billing Information, or simply eBay. That’s because the Web site address
is the one fundamental aspect of a legitimate site that phishers cannot copy.
There is exactly one www.ebay.com in the world, and it’s the real eBay. The
hope, then, is that when you click the link and Firefox opens it automatically,
you’ll forget to check the Location Bar. So that’s an important step:
Always verify that you’re really at the Web site you think you’re at by check-
ing the address in the Location Bar.
Unfortunately, protecting yourself isn’t that simple. As you can tell by now,
phishers are nothing if not persistent. They’ve devised a number of clever ways
to disguise or obfuscate the addresses of their fake replicas so that even people
who know to check are fooled! Here are some indicators to watch out for:
 Most legitimate Web site addresses don’t contain the at sign (@). This
symbol has special meaning when contained within a Web address: The
phrase before it is considered to be login information, and the phrase
after it is interpreted as the Web site to which you wish to login. For
example, an address of http://www.ebay.com@blakeross.com, is
interpreted as user www.ebay.com logging in to the Web site http://
blakeross.com and will actually navigate to http://blakeross.com,
even though it might appear to point to eBay at first glance. If all that
didn’t make much sense, that’s okay — it’s a technical detail you don’t
need to worry about. When you visit these kinds of addresses, Firefox
automatically asks you to confirm the decision, as shown in Figure 15-4. 
(I use my Web site for demo purposes.)
Practically no legitimate Web sites use this kind of addressing scheme,
so if you ever encounter a window like this, the right answer is almost
certainly No.
 Be wary of numerical addresses. Reputable Web sites use words or
phrases in their addresses so you can return to them easily. Malicious
sites often sport numerical addresses, such as http://94.116.102.
156, to make them more difficult to trace.
Figure 15-4:
Firefox asks
you to

Web sites.
196
Part III: Outfoxing Hackers 

 Follow the yellow brick road, er, Location Bar. Legitimate Web sites
that ask you for highly sensitive information, such as banks, always use a
security technology such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). Firefox makes it
easy to tell whether you are at a secure Web site: The entire Location Bar
turns yellow and is punctuated by a lock icon, as shown in Figure 15-5.
Note that if you aren’t using the default theme, the Location Bar might be
shaded with another color, such as green. Although the other developers
and I don’t encourage it, some themes change the color to better match
their design. (See Chapter 17 for more information about the themes 
feature.)
If you ever find yourself entering critical information into a Web site whose
address is not enshrouded in yellow, something is wrong. If you attempt to
submit information at a non-secure Web site, Firefox displays the warning
shown in Figure 15-6.
If you aren’t entering sensitive information, you don’t need to concern your-
self with this warning. It isn’t unusual for Web sites to transmit nonsensitive
data in an unencrypted (non-secure) fashion. In fact, it’s so common that by
default, Firefox doesn’t show this confirmation again unless you specifically
request it by selecting the Alert Me check box. If you leave the confirmation
off, you can continue to detect suspicious activity by observing the Location
Bar, as I describe earlier in this section.
The lock icon indicates a secure Web site.

Bar turns
yellow, and

197
Chapter 15: Staying Safe Online

Likewise, when you leave a secure Web site through a link on its page, Firefox
warns you that you’re venturing back out into non-secure territory (see
Figure 15-7). Again, this should be a concern only if you expected to remain in
secure territory — that is to say, if you intended to enter sensitive informa-
tion into the newly loaded Web site.
Firefox always displays the actual address of any secure Web site you view in
the bottom-right corner of the window, regardless of whatever tricks a
phisher uses to try to disguise it. Note that a secure Web site is simply one
that transfers your information securely over the Internet; whether it’s trans-
ferring that information to a reputable source is another matter. See the fol-
lowing section, “Phending off pharming,” for more information.
Know where you’re typing
Get in the habit of asking yourself “Where am I typing this?” each and every
time you enter your password. Some phishers try to deceive you by opening
browser windows that replicate not other Web sites, but other programs on
your computer. For instance, a phisher might design a Web site that looks like
an AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) window and asks you to verify your pass-
word. If you’re an AIM user and are currently logged on to AIM, you might be
fooled into thinking this is an AIM window.

198
Part III: Outfoxing Hackers 

Remember this simple rule: If the title bar of the window begins with “Mozilla
Firefox,” it is a Web site masquerading as a program, not another program,
because another program on your computer would have its own name in its
title bar or something even more descriptive. The AIM Buddy List window, for
example, contains your instant messaging screen name (such as Johnny123’s
Buddy List Window). A phisher can’t replicate that part of the window in his
spoof Web site because he doesn’t know your screen name, just as he can’t
prevent Mozilla Firefox from appearing in the title bar.
Phending off pharming
A new crop of attacks is on the horizon, and it’s even more insidious than
phishing — and more poorly named. Pharming is a new way of luring you to
fake Web sites with the same old goal: stealing your identity. Instead of set-
ting up a convincing replica of a popular site, hackers attack the site itself and
set up a site redirect that takes effect when you and others try to visit it. In
other words, even if you type the correct address yourself, you can still end
up at a fraudulent Web site. Because the Location Bar actually reflects the
correct address and because the scammer didn’t interact with you in any
other fashion, none of the phishing tests can help you detect pharmers!
Imagine that you have to call a friend for directions to his house. Now imag-
ine that someone posing as your friend answers the phone and, with a voice
just like your friend’s, directs you to his house instead so he can rob you.
Now you can begin to understand why pharming is so sinister.
The good news here is that pharming is a very difficult attack to pull off
because hackers need to successfully break into the Web site itself. Technical
details aside, they essentially need to update the table of information that
says, “when the user types ebay.com, load the information off this computer.”
Furthermore, if a hacker does manage to successfully pharm a major Web
site, the company that operates it can notice and correct the problem very
quickly.
The rarity of pharming is a saving grace, but you should still take steps to
prevent being pharmed. Doing so requires a little knowledge of browser certifi-
cates. These aren’t gift certificates; instead, they’re more like the documents
certifying that your doctor is trained to perform an operation. Browser cer-
tificates help you verify that you’re interacting with the desired site, which
cuts to the very heart of pharming.
In the phishing section, I discuss the concept of secure Web sites that use 
SSL technology and mention that all reputable sites asking for sensitive infor-
mation should use this technology. Certificates are the next layer of security.
Whereas SSL technology ensures that your information is being securely
transferred, certificates ensure that your information is being securely trans-
ferred to the organization you intend to entrust with it. Trusted third parties
199
Chapter 15: Staying Safe Online

such as VeriSign issue certificates to consummate your transactions with
secure Web sites, just as an independent public notary would preside over
the dealings of two strangers. These companies issue certificates only to rep-
utable companies.
Keep in mind that certificates are built atop the SSL technology. Therefore, if
the malicious Web site the pharmer is secretly redirecting to doesn’t support
SSL (which it might want to do as a ruse), Firefox won’t be expecting a certifi-
cate and therefore won’t warn of a mismatch. This is intentional because SSL
should be considered the first hurdle that any legitimate Web site should
pass. In other words, if the Web site doesn’t support SSL — if that Location
Bar doesn’t turn bright yellow — something is already suspect before you
even begin worrying about certificates.
The bottom line is that it’s impossible — as far as I know today — for any
hacker to replicate the combination of SSL technology (which displays the
bright yellow Location Bar!) and a legitimate, matching certificate.
Protecting your password
Your password is the prize most hackers are seeking. It is often the key to
your credit card and Social Security numbers, to your home address and
other private data, and you should guard it with the same vigilance as you do
the key to your home.
Besides using tricks like fake e-mail and fake Web sites to steal your pass-
words, there are hackers working on an entirely different approach: Rather
than persuade you to give us your password, they’ll just guess it themselves!
Yes, that’s right: guess it.
200
Part III: Outfoxing Hackers 
How certificates defend you
When you go to a secure site today, Firefox
asks the site for the certificate issued to it by
VeriSign or another trusted third party. If it’s a
legitimate site, it can do so without concern. If
the site has been pharmed and is thus secretly
redirecting to a different site, the new, illegiti-
mate site has no access to the authentic cer-
tificate. Firefox smells something fishy, and —
here’s the important part — warns you that the
provided certificate does not match and asks
whether you want to continue. You should say
no in all cases. There are very few cases where
legitimate sites would cause this error — usually
when they forgot to renew their certificates —
and in those rare instances, you should say 
no and wait for the company to get its act
together.

The unfortunate fact of security is that it often comes at the expense of con-
venience. Although computing power isn’t yet to the point where hackers can
quickly guess any combination of letters and numbers, they can realistically
try every password in the dictionary and then some. And if the idea of a
hacker slaving away at home entering passwords gives you some consola-
tion, think again: Hackers today use sophisticated networks of computers
that work together to guess passwords automatically (see the “How they do
it” sidebar). That means that using your favorite color or even your mother’s
maiden name as your password just isn’t going to cut it anymore. Here are
some tips for keeping your password safe from prying eyes:
 Throw convenience to the wind. If you’re using a password that has any
kind of recognizable personal significance (such as your mother’s maiden
name or your birth town), you’re putting yourself at risk. Hackers have
assembled vast collections of words far beyond those found in the dictio-
nary, including slang and names of people, streets, and pets. The safest
route is to choose a random combination of letters and numbers, such as
y94pJ332k. Mix the letters and numbers together and use both upper-
and lowercase. If the Web site allows it, include special characters such
as ! or $.
 Write your password down on paper until you remember it. It’s going
to take you awhile to remember Iw2ih4smpw as easily as you remember
your mother’s maiden name. However, saving passwords on your com-
puter is a bad idea because if someone is able to gain access to your
computer, she can retrieve it. Instead, write it down on paper and store
it in a safe location in your home. Throw it out as soon as you’re com-
fortable with your new password.
You can also try using a mnemonic device to remember a seemingly non-
sensical password. For example, Iw2ih4smpw looks like complete gibber-
ish, but I remember it as “I want to (2) imprison hackers for (4) stealing
my password.”
 Never give your password or other private information to anyone.
Anyone. This tip is just common sense. Employees of reputable compa-
nies will never contact you out of the blue to request your password or
other private information.
 Make your password as long as possible. Different sites allow different
length ranges. The longer you make your password, the harder it is for
hacking technology to guess it.
 Use different passwords for different sites. Yes, it’s much more conve-
nient to remember a single password. But using the same password at
multiple places weakens your overall security because your security is
only as strong as the weakest link. If a hacker steals your password at a
low-security site, you can bet he’s going to see whether it also works at
your bank.
201
Chapter 15: Staying Safe Online

 Be careful where you log in. Sites you’re liable to visit frequently —
such as your Web mail site, if you use a Web-based e-mail service —
often remember who you are automatically so you don’t have to keep
entering your login information (see Figure 15-8). This is great when
you’re at home, but it’s dangerous at a public computer where the very
next person might also use your Web mail provider. Many Web sites offer
a check box that says something to the effect of Remember Me on This
Computer. Select this check box only if you’re on your home computer.
Alternatively, some Web sites remember you by default and offer an I Am
on a Public Computer check box to bypass it, and you should select this
whenever you are not on your home computer. If you can’t tell whether a
particular Web site will remember you, I recommend using that site only
on computers that belong to you.
 Limit access to your computer. The Firefox Password Manager remem-
bers your login information for you so you don’t have to keep entering it
when you return to Web sites. Although this is convenient, it might be
undesirable if you share a single computer with other people, such as
family members or co-workers. Unless you trust the other people who
have access to your computer, you might want to disable the Password
Manager or use its Master Password feature, as I describe in Chapter 8.
Check this box if you want Gmail to remember your login info.

Chapter 15: Staying Safe Online
How they do it
While your computer takes its sweet time boot-
ing up, hackers are guessing thousands and
thousands of letter combinations to crack a
victim’s password. How do they do it? And better
yet, where can we common folk get such fast
computers?
The truth is that hackers use the same kinds of
computers that you and I use, but with a few dif-
ferences. One is that hackers aren’t actually
using the computer interactively; they’re using
the computer only to try passwords endlessly
until the correct one is found. This means they
don’t care to see a helpful error message or
click an OK button when the wrong password is
tried. Their programs run automatically and very
quickly without any human interaction until the
correct password is found.
The second and most important difference is
that hackers aren’t limited to a single computer.
Instead, they can network multiple computers
together and have them work in parallel to mul-
tiply the processing power and reduce the
length of the operation. For example, while one
computer is trying all the words beginning with
A, another computer could try all the B words,
and so forth.
The worst part comes when you ask that burn-
ing question: Where do those additional com-
puters come from? Unfortunately, one way or
another, the computer supplier is typically you
or someone like you. Either the hacker pur-
chases additional computers with the money he
obtains by stealing a victim’s banking informa-
tion, or he is actually using a victim’s computer
directly because he stole the victim’s password.
Yes, you read that correctly: Many hackers take
control of victims’ computers and put them to
work guessing other would-be victims’ pass-
words. In this way, hacking is a viciously self-
supporting endeavor.
Most modern Web sites try to counter or slow a
hacker’s ability to guess a user’s password by
pausing a second or two before revealing
whether a guessed password is correct or not, or
by preventing users who use an incorrect pass-
word three times from logging in. These measures
have been fairly successful at staving off hackers.
Another silver lining is that the same networking
technique (called distributed computing) used by
hackers to guess passwords is also used by lead-
ing scientists and researchers worldwide for the
benefit of mankind. Many researchers who
require enormous amounts of computing power
to solve the problem they’re working on distribute
a program you can download to “donate” your
computer’s processing power to the research
effort. When you aren’t using your computer,
these programs use your computer to work on
complex mathematical calculations and submit
the results back to the researchers. Although your
computer is only solving a miniscule portion of the
overall problem, researchers can aggregate all
the data they receive to figure out the larger pic-
ture. Two of the most famous projects to use this
method are Stanford’s Folding@Home (http://
folding.stanford.edu), which seeks to
understand protein folding and cure-related dis-
eases such as Alzheimer’s, and Berkeley’s
Seti@Home (http://setiathome.ssl.
berkeley.edu), which analyzes radio tele-
scope data in the hopes of discovering extrater-
restrial communication.

Using the PwdHash Extension
Reading a chapter about all the work involved in keeping your identity secure
can be a real downer. Firefox was created to make your life easier in every
possible respect, and here I am giving you a laundry list of facts to keep in
mind during everyday surfing. What a pain! You shouldn’t have to worry
about those details. With that in mind, I and a group of security experts at
Stanford set out to create a browser extension called PwdHash, short for
Password Hash. (See Chapter 20 for more information about Firefox exten-
sions.) The goal of PwdHash is to afford users the convenience of remember-
ing a single password with the security of using a different password on each
Web site you visit. It does this by automatically and transparently generating
a different version of your password for each Web site.
Discovering PwdHash
As convenient as it is, using a single password at every Web site you visit cre-
ates one huge problem: When someone gets your password from one Web
site, all other sites you log in to are exposed.
Your password can fall into the wrong hands when
 Someone hacks one of the Web sites you log in to
 A phisher convinces you to enter your password at a replica site
PwdHash handles hacking scams and phishing scams slightly differently, but
the good news is that it protects you from both. The following two sections
tell you how.
Doing the password mash with PwdHash
If your password is the same at every other site in your network, one hack is
no longer an isolated incident — it’s a nightmare. It’s also a hacker’s dream
because your security is only as strong as the weakest site you visit.
Suppose you visit two Web sites regularly. The first is a low-security,
makeshift high school reunion page that an old classmate slapped together
over the weekend. The second is Citibank, which houses your financial
accounts. Both sites require a username and password. Citibank can imple-
ment the most expensive and cutting-edge password defenses in the world,
but they’ll be entirely useless if a hacker breaks into the reunion page and
steals the password list. Do you think he wants to see how you and your
classmates are celebrating your 25th? Of course not. He wants to take your
password to the bank — literally.
204
Part III: Outfoxing Hackers 

Using different usernames at different Web sites makes it more difficult for a
hacker to use the login information he obtains from hacking one Web site at
another site you use because he still won’t know your username at the other
site. (This isn’t always possible, though, because many sites ask for your
e-mail address in lieu of a username.)
If you use PwdHash, you can continue to type the same password into both
Citibank and the reunion site. The difference is that right before you submit the
information to the sites, and without bothering you, PwdHash automatically
generates a different version of your password for each site. (If you’re using a
computer without the PwdHash extension, you need to generate this version
manually, as I discuss in “Using PwdHash from other computers” later in this
chapter.) This process is called hashing, and in a non-technical sense, you can
imagine the process works as follows. Say your password is 42family19. When
you log in to Citibank, PwdHash adds the site’s address — citibank.com — to
the end of your password, yielding 42family19citibank.com. Then it scrambles
up this new phrase in a random order. The same process is repeated at
reunion.com with 42family19reunion.com. The scrambling technique is, of
course, much more complicated, with the end result that it’s impossible for 
a hacker to get from the scrambled version to the unscrambled version.
So how does this fix the problem? Well, even if a hacker does retrieve 
your reunion password, that password works only at the reunion site. It 
doesn’t work at Citibank because Citibank is expecting the Citibank-specific
“definition.”
Giving the phishers a hook to swallow
If you use only one password, the moment a phisher tricks you into entering
your password at a fake replica site, all other Web sites you log in to are 
now exposed. This scenario is related to the Citibank/reunion conundrum I
describe in the preceding section, and PwdHash remedies it in a similar 
fashion. Suppose the replica phishing page is located at www.ebay.org
instead of www.ebay.com. As soon as you type in your password (for this
example, 42family19), and before the hacker has a chance to see it, PwdHash
takes 42family19ebay.org, scrambles it, and then sends it to the hacker. What
the hacker receives is a completely useless password because it works only
at his fake site. It doesn’t work at the real eBay.
Using PwdHash every day
PwdHash was designed with Firefox principles in mind — that is, it tries to
stay out of your hair. The extension is available from www.pwdhash.com, and
the installation process is the same as for all other Firefox extensions. I
describe this simple procedure in Chapter 20.
205
Chapter 15: Staying Safe Online

Using the extension is easy. All you have to do is tell PwdHash whenever
you’re about to type in a password. You do this by typing two at signs (@@)
before typing your password (for example, if your password is family, you
would type @@family) or by pressing F2 before typing your password. You
can then rest assured that PwdHash is safeguarding the password you type in
next.
Configuring PwdHash
Before you can log in to your existing Web sites, however, you have to com-
plete a little bit of configuration. This configuration needs to be done only
once, and unfortunately it isn’t something PwdHash could do for you.
Basically, because PwdHash will be generating new, scrambled versions of
your password for each Web site you visit, you need to tell these Web sites
what your new password is. Even though you yourself continue remembering
the old one, PwdHash will be generating new ones for you on your behalf,
and you need to notify the sites of the change so they allow you to log in.
Luckily, this configuration is quick and painless, and you can do it on an as-
needed basis. The first time you log in to a site after installing PwdHash,
simply go to the Web site’s Change Password page. These pages usually have
three password fields: The first asks you to enter your current password for
security reasons, and the latter two ask you to enter your new password. In
the current password field, enter your password as usual. For the latter two
fields, you must tell PwdHash to scramble the passwords you input. In other
words, you want to notify the Web site of your new, scrambled password. To
do this, click in the field and type @@ or press F2, and then type your current
password into the field. (Follow the steps for both of the new password
fields.)
This is the only time you have to worry about which fields to scramble and
which to leave alone. Whenever you visit this Web site in the future, you
should always scramble your password by typing @@ or pressing F2 before
beginning.
Using PwdHash from other computers
PwdHash works automatically and silently when it’s installed on your com-
puter, but what happens when you’re on a computer that doesn’t have
PwdHash installed? How can you obtain the scrambled versions of your pass-
word for each of the sites you need to access? The best solution, of course, is
to install the PwdHash extension on the new computer — but in some environ-
ments, such as Internet cafes, that isn’t permitted. To remedy this situation,
206
Part III: Outfoxing Hackers 

PwdHash offers a Web site accessible from anywhere that will generate your
scrambled version for you. This Web site is located at www.pwdhash.com and
is simple and intuitive to use: Just copy and paste the address of the Web site
you need to log in to (such as http://www.ebay.com) and enter your pass-
word, and the PwdHash site automatically generates the scrambled version 
for you.
Be sure to note a couple important details here:
 Your scrambled password will be visible as soon as you click the
Generate button. If someone is looking over your shoulder, she can see
it, too. You should immediately cut and paste it from the PwdHash Web
site to the Web site you’re trying to log in to.
 Your unscrambled password (the one you remember) is not saved or
transmitted anywhere when you enter it on www.pwdhash.com. A third
party could never intercept it because it isn’t sent over the Internet.
Preventing Spyware and Viruses
If phishing is the digital equivalent of someone stealing your credit card
number, spyware and viruses are like having criminals living in your bedroom.
(Spyware is software that monitors and records everything you do, and a virus
is a program that deletes files or causes other damage.) Unlike phishing
scams, both spyware and viruses actually live on your computer. These types
of infections typically find their way onto your computer through a malicious
file you download. The bottom line is this:
You should never, ever download a file unless you know exactly what
it is, where it’s coming from, and whether the person or company offer-
ing it is trustworthy.
Avoiding malicious extensions
Unfortunately, many browsers make it easy to download files inadvertently in
the form of extensions. In Internet Explorer, for example, a Web site can spit
out a big, annoying confirmation window as soon as it loads. If you click Yes
in a hurry to get to the page, a malicious extension is installed. Firefox does
everything it can to prevent you from installing malicious files inadvertently.
Instead of allowing Web sites to get in your face with extension downloads,
Firefox displays the non-intrusive toolbar that you see in Figure 15-9. (This
toolbar doesn’t appear for the official Firefox site, though.)
207
Chapter 15: Staying Safe Online

Note that the mere appearance of this toolbar doesn’t necessarily suggest
impropriety on the part of the Web site. The toolbar appears whenever a 
Web site other than the official, trusted Firefox Plugins Web site (http://
addons.mozilla.org) tries to install an extension. If you trust the Web site
you’re viewing, go ahead and proceed, as I discuss in Chapter 20 in the sec-
tion on installing from another site.
Acquiring additional software protection
Firefox does everything it can to keep you safe, but your computer has many
borders to protect, and the browser is only one of them. You must install
three additional tools to remain safe and sound on the Internet:
 Antivirus software: This tool monitors the files on your computer and
checks newly downloaded files for viruses. If it finds one, it notifies you
immediately and allows you to either delete the file or quarantine it so 
it can’t harm your computer. It’s critical that you keep your antivirus
software up-to-date because new viruses are discovered regularly.
Recommendations: Norton AntiVirus and McAfee VirusScan are available
in stores.
Figure 15-9:

toolbar at
the top of

208
Part III: Outfoxing Hackers 

 Antispyware software: Like antivirus software, this tool monitors the
files on your computer as well as new downloads, but it’s looking for
spyware. If it finds any, it notifies you immediately and allows you to
delete the file. You must also keep your antispyware software up-to-
date because new spyware threats are discovered regularly. Plenty of
high-quality antispyware tools are available free of charge, although
many antivirus suites (which usually cost money) include them nowa-
days. Recommendations: Ad-Aware is freely available from Lavasoft
(www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware), and Spybot-Search &
Destroy is freely available from www.safer-networking.org/en/
download.
 Firewall: A firewall monitors inbound and outbound Internet connec-
tions on your computer — that is to say, it checks when your computer
tries to connect to the Internet, and when other computers try to con-
nect to yours. The newest versions of Windows, XP and Vista, come with
a built-in firewall that is on by default, so you don’t have to do anything.
Recommendation: If you have an older version, I recommend ZoneAlarm,
available from www.zonelabs.com.
Additionally, you should install new security patches for your computer as
soon as they’re available. See http://microsoft.com/security for more
information about the Windows patching process, or www.apple.com/sup-
port/downloads for the latest Macintosh security patches.
Staying Up-to-Date
Perhaps the most important fact to remember about your security online is
that it’s a never-ending battle. Phishers are devising new tricks on the hour,
and new strains of computer viruses and spyware appear daily. In addition to
keeping your software tools up-to-date, it’s critical that you keep yourself up-
to-date with new developments in the world of security so you know what
kinds of new scams to look out for.
Updating Firefox
You need to keep your antivirus and antispyware software current. However,
it’s also important that you keep your version of Firefox up-to-date as well,
because the Mozilla Foundation will release security patches from time to
time. Firefox automatically checks for updates once a day. If any are available,
it downloads and installs them and notifies you upon completion, providing
that the update is compatible with your extensions and themes. Virtually all
critical updates (such as those that fix security flaws) are compatible, but
major Firefox updates (such as from version 1.5 to 2.0) might be incompatible.
209
Chapter 15: Staying Safe Online

If you’re using an extension or theme that is incompatible with the updated
version, Firefox presents a list of the incompatible extensions and themes
and asks you to confirm the update. Click the Show List button to see the list
of incompatibilities. If you proceed with the update, Firefox automatically dis-
ables the incompatible extensions and themes until their authors release
compatible versions. When compatible versions are released, Firefox discov-
ers and installs them the next time it checks for updates, and then Firefox re-
enables the extension or theme. That’s because the update feature checks for
updates not just to Firefox itself, but also to your installed extensions,
themes, and Search Box engines.
If you don’t like the automatic update features, you can disable them and
check for updates manually. Even if you leave automatic updating on, you 
can still check for updates manually at any time. I discuss these options in
the following two sections.
Disabling automatic update checking or installation
You can disable automatic update checking or installation by following the
steps in this section. If you don’t like the idea of anything being installed with-
out your permission, it’s all right to disable automatic installation. However, 
I don’t recommend disabling automatic checking because then you won’t be
notified when important updates are available.
To disable automatic update checking or installation, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options to open the Options window.
2. Click the Advanced icon at the top of the window.
3. Click the Update tab.
4. Do one of the following:
• To disable automatic update checking, deselect the desired
update types. For example, to disable automatic checking for
updates to your installed themes and extensions, deselect the
Installed Extensions & Themes check box.
• To disable automatic update installation, under When Updates to
Firefox are Found, select Ask Me What I Want to Do.
5. Click OK.
Checking for updates manually
If you decide to disable automatic update checking, or if you want to check
for updates more frequently than the Firefox once-a-day check, you can check
for Firefox updates manually at any time by following these steps:
210
Part III: Outfoxing Hackers 

1. Choose Help➪Check For Updates in the main Firefox window.
If an update is available, the Update Wizard appears and walks you
through the update process, as shown in Figure 15-10. Otherwise, Firefox
tells you that no updates are available. If no updates are available, click
Finish and skip the remaining steps.
2. Read about the available updates and decide whether you want to
install them.
If an update is incompatible with one or more of your installed exten-
sions or themes, Firefox warns you and offers a list of the incompatible
extensions and themes, which you can access by clicking the Show List
button. If you decide to proceed with the update, Firefox automatically
disables the incompatible extensions and themes until their authors
release updated versions. You can discover and install these updated
versions by repeating these steps, or you can wait until Firefox automati-
cally discovers and installs them, provided you have not disabled the
automatic update features (as I discuss in the earlier section, “Disabling
automatic update checking or installation”).
3. To install the updates, click Download & Install Now.
Firefox displays a progress meter indicating the progress of the update.
4. Click Finish to close the Update Wizard.
When the update finishes, you might need to restart Firefox.

Monitoring new developments
Hundreds of new security exploits and attacks have been discovered between
the time this book was published and the time you’re reading it now. It’s 
critical that you monitor the latest developments so you know how to 
protect yourself against new tricks. Plenty of online resources update daily.
Here are a few of the top dogs of security:
 Microsoft Security Home Page: Offers one-click access to the latest
Windows updates, new tips for protecting your computer, and the 
ongoing blog of the Microsoft Security Response Team.
www.microsoft.com/security
 CERT Coordination Center: Run by the Software Engineering Institute at
Carnegie Mellon University, CERT is one of the world’s most renowned
security response teams, and for good reason: It was also the first. At its
Web site, the team posts information about critical security flaws in a
wide array of software.
www.cert.org/nav/index_red.html
 US-CERT: The United States Computer Emergency Response Team was
formed in 2003 to protect the United States Internet infrastructure
against emerging attacks. Its Web site maintains a list of flaws in popular
software and is updated daily.

Dressing Up 
the Fox

In this part . . .
B
ecause you probably use your browser more than
any other program on your computer, it would be
nothing short of criminal to make you use a browser you
didn’t love. So think of the default Firefox setup as a mere
suggestion. It’s the developers’ best guess as to what a
Web browser should be, but it certainly isn’t the only way
to go. Perhaps you want this button over there or that
menu gone entirely. Perhaps Firefox is missing a feature
you need, or maybe you just think it looks better in black.
Whatever your fancy, anything is possible thanks to the
extensive customization features I outline in this part.

Chapter 16
Setting Your Options
In This Chapter
 Finding your way around the Options window
 Understanding the Firefox options
O
ptions are heresy among Firefox developers. We don’t hate the idea of
customization; we just want Firefox to cater to you automatically. It
should fit your needs out of the box, so we consider every preference we add
a personal failure.
That said, different people have different tastes. Just because I find reality
better than reality TV doesn’t mean the latter shouldn’t be an option. The
Firefox Options window helps you configure every aspect of your browsing
experience, from home page to shutdown. This chapter provides a brief
overview of the Options window and points you to additional information
about each option.
The right choice
As strange as it sounds, one of our primary goals
in developing Firefox is to reduce a user’s
choices. If you’ve ever used an application that
buried one or two useful options in a sea of
absurd ones — and I think that’s most software
applications these days — you can probably
appreciate our intentions. We want to deliver the
best possible experience out of the box, and then
allow a level of customization that most people
are likely to need. For those who really want to
trick out Firefox, our community offers a sea of
extensions.
So how do applications end up so bloated and,
if I may invent an apt word, featureful? Having
observed or participated in the development
processes of many applications, I can tell you
the answer is simple: Developers are an indeci-
sive bunch. Much of the time, the addition of a
setting has little to do with what you might want;
it’s a compromise between two developers who
disagree about how a feature should behave.
Rather than discussing with users to figure out
the right behavior, it’s generally much faster just
to make it an option.
In Firefox, we force ourselves to make decisions
about feature behavior rather than adding an
option and calling it a day. The only way an
option makes it into the product is if the world
at large disagrees about how the feature should
behave — not two developers.

Using the Options Window
The first thing to do is navigate to the Options window. Choose Tools➪
Options (Windows) or Firefox➪Preferences (Mac) to open the Options
window, as shown in Figure 16-1. The Options window is designed to be easy
and straightforward. It contains six categories of settings in a horizontal bar
along the top of the window. Click an icon to view its options. (Note that
whichever category you’re currently viewing has a highlighted background
behind its icon, as the General icon does in Figure 16-1.) Firefox remembers
the last category you viewed when you close the Options window and shows
that category the next time you open it.
Each category is further divided into groups of options. For example, the
General category contains three boxed groups: Home Page, Default Browser,
and Connection.
You can switch freely between groups and categories and make as many
changes as you need to before finalizing your decisions by clicking OK. In
general, the changes you make in the Options window aren’t saved until you
click OK. For example, if you change your home page in General, turn off
popup blocking in Content, and then click Cancel to exit the Options window,
neither of those changes are saved. (Closing the Options window with the
Close button in the corner is equivalent to clicking Cancel.)

However, the Options window contains a few action buttons — such as Clear
Browsing History Now — that take effect immediately. Clicking Cancel doesn’t
undo them. I note these exceptions as they arise in the rest of this chapter.
The Options window demands your attention. In other words, you can’t
access any other part of the Firefox interface while the Options window is
open. However, if you have more than one Firefox window open, you can 
continue to browse in other windows.
To keep the Options window simple, the developers occasionally move
lesser-used settings to separate window. For example, the Colors button in
the Content category opens a separate window with coloring options (see
Figure 16-2). These secondary windows typically have OK and Cancel but-
tons. As you would expect, clicking Cancel tells Firefox to forget any changes
you made to the options in the window. To save the changes, you must click
OK in the secondary window and in the main Options window. I note excep-
tions to this rule in the rest of this chapter.
Also notice the Help button in the bottom-right corner. This button knows
which options you’re looking at when you click it. For example, if you click it
while viewing the Privacy category, it displays help on the Privacy options.
See Chapter 13 for details on the Firefox built-in help system.

Chapter 16: Setting Your Options

Oodles of Options
The following sections walk you through the available options by category. 
I cover most of these options more thoroughly in other chapters, so this 
section is best used as a starting point.
The General category
The General category (see Figure 16-3) contains options that don’t fit well
into any of the other categories.
Home Page
By default, Firefox uses a special Google page (www.google.com/firefox)
as your home page, which is the first page you see each time you start
Firefox. Here you can enter the address of a new home page.
If you can’t remember the address of the site that you want as your home
page, try the following tricks:
 Type what you remember. Firefox displays suggestions from your
browsing history as you type. You can also leave the box empty and
press the down arrow to see a list of addresses you’ve typed into the
Location Bar recently.
Figure 16-3:
You can set

category of

218
Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

 Visit the page first. Firefox can automatically set any Web site you visit
as your home page. First, cancel out of the Options window (or click OK
if you made other changes you want to save). Now return to the page by
using any means, such as a search engine. When it’s displayed, reopen
the Options window and click the Use Current Page button.
You don’t have to return to the Options window to set a page you’re
viewing as the home page. Just drag the tiny icon on the left end of the
Location Bar onto the Home button. Firefox asks you to confirm the
decision.
 Find it in your bookmarks. If you previously bookmarked your desired
home page, click the Use Bookmark button to open your bookmarks list,
as shown in Figure 16-3. Select the bookmark you want to use and click
OK or select a bookmarks folder to set all the bookmarks it contains as
your home pages. If you have more than one home page, Firefox opens
them in tabs, a feature I discuss further in Chapter 7.
If you don’t want any home page, click the Use Blank Page button. This
option is useful if there’s no one Web site you like to check every time you
start Firefox, and don’t want Firefox to waste time loading a home page.
You can also set multiple home pages that will open in tabs (see Chapter 7 for
details).
Default Browser
When a program on your computer needs to display a Web site, it launches
your default browser. If you would like to make Firefox the default browser,
click Check Now. If Firefox isn’t already the default, it offers to make the
change. If you click Yes, Firefox becomes your default browser immediately,
and clicking Cancel in the Options window won’t unset it. To change your
default to another browser in the future, use that browser’s options.
Firefox never makes itself the default browser unless you allow it to.
Unfortunately, certain ruder browsers do so automatically. To have Firefox
ensure that it’s the default each time it starts, select the check box in this
area. Firefox prompts you at startup only if another browser has been set as
the default.
Connection
Because Firefox accesses the Internet, you must have a working Internet con-
nection, such as dial-up, DSL, or cable. Firefox usually detects your connection
automatically. However, certain companies use so-called proxies (computers
that forward Internet requests from one computer to another) that can
obstruct the connection. Company administrators should click Connection
Settings to open a window where they can configure these proxies. This isn’t
something you should have to worry about.
219
Chapter 16: Setting Your Options

The Privacy category
Firefox remembers information for you while you browse, such as browsing
history and passwords. The Privacy category, shown in Figure 16-4, allows
you to configure how much information Firefox stores and when it gets
cleared. It’s broken down into six tabs, one for each type of information
Firefox stores. I discuss the Privacy settings in depth in Chapter 15, so I just
review them briefly here.
History
Firefox maintains a history of the Web sites you visit so you can return to
them easily. By default, Firefox remembers the pages you visited in the last
nine days. For more on browsing history, turn to Chapter 6.
Saved Forms
Firefox remembers information you enter into online forms, such as a ZIP
code, so it can prefill them for you in the future. Likewise, Firefox remembers
phrases you search for from the Search Box on the Navigation Toolbar so you
can search for them again more quickly. For more on forms, check out
Chapter 8.
Passwords
Firefox remembers your online passwords and prefills them for you so you
can log in to Web sites more quickly. Chapter 8 covers passwords in depth.

Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

Download History
Firefox keeps records of downloaded files in the Download Manager so you
can find and open them easily. See Chapter 11 for more information about the
Download Manager. Deleting a record of a download does not delete the
downloaded file itself. By default, Firefox stores records forever — or at least
until you delete them manually. Or until your computer explodes. And let’s
hope that doesn’t happen.
Cookies
Web sites put tiny bits of information called cookies on your computer to
improve your browsing experience. Amazon, for example, might store a cookie
that contains the contents of your shopping cart, so you can browse the site
just as you browse a supermarket. See Chapter 14 for more information about
what cookies are and how to configure them.
Cache
Firefox archives the pages you visit in a cache so they load more quickly in
the future. Unlike browsing history, you don’t have direct access to the
cache; Firefox accesses it behind the scenes to speed browsing.
Clear Private Data Settings
As I discuss in Chapter 14, Firefox includes a feature called Clear Private Data
(Tools➪Clear Private Data) to help you clear many kinds of private informa-
tion quickly. The Settings button at the bottom of the Privacy tab opens the
Clear Private Data settings window, where you can configure which kinds of
information are cleared, and whether or not a confirmation window is shown,
each time you use the Clear Private Data feature. From the settings window,
you can also instruct Firefox to clear the specified information automatically
each time it shuts down. See Chapter 14 for more information.
The Content category
The Content category (see Figure 16-5) configures the display of Web sites
themselves.
Popup Blocking
Firefox blocks Web sites from opening popup windows without your consent,
as I discuss in Chapter 9.
 To turn off popup blocking, deselect the Block Popup Windows
check box.
 To allow popups on certain Web sites, click the Allowed Sites button to
open the exceptions list. Some sites use popup windows legitimately
and might not work properly without them. See Chapter 9 for more infor-
mation about this feature.
221
Chapter 16: Setting Your Options

Extension and Theme Installation
As I discuss in Chapters 17 (for themes) and 20 (for extensions), only the offi-
cial Firefox site is allowed to install extensions and themes by default. When
you try to install an extension or theme from another Web site, Firefox dis-
plays a warning toolbar that you need to dismiss before the installation can
proceed, as I discuss in those chapters.
 To enable installation from certain trusted Web sites without a warn-
ing, leave the Warn Me When Web Sites Try to Install Extensions or
Themes check box selected, and click the Exceptions button to open the
Exceptions window, where you can specify a list of Web sites you trust.
When you try to install an extension or theme from one of these sites,
Firefox allows the installation without requiring you to deal with the
warning toolbar. When you add a site to the exceptions list, the change
takes effect immediately. Although clicking Cancel in the main Options
window doesn’t undo it, you can return to the list and use the Remove
buttons if necessary.
 To enable installation from all sites, deselect the Warn Me When Web
Sites Try to Install Extensions or Themes check box. Make sure you trust
the company or individual offering an extension before you install it
because malicious extensions could carry viruses or have undesirable
side effects.

Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

Loading Images
By default, of course, Firefox loads images on all Web sites you visit. To speed
browsing or cut down on visual distraction, you can set Firefox to load only
certain images or you can turn off images entirely. See Chapter 19 for more
information.
 To prevent Web sites from loading images from other Web sites, select
the For the Originating Web Site Only check box. This is a reasonable
way to block advertising, but it can also break many pages, so I don’t
recommend it. For a better way to block ads, see the section on the
AdBlock extension in Chapter 22.
 To turn off Web site images, deselect the Load Images check box.
 To block or allow images on certain Web sites, click the Exceptions
button to open the exceptions list. If you keep images on, you can use
this list to block certain Web sites from loading images. Likewise, if you
turn images off, you can allow certain Web sites to keep loading them.
To add a Web site to the list, simply enter its address (for example, www.
ebay.com) and click the Allow or Block button depending on whether
the site should be allowed to display images. This is a highly advanced
feature. If you just want to block advertisements, see the section on the
AdBlock extension in Chapter 22.
Java and JavaScript
Advanced Web sites use technologies called Java and JavaScript to offer
more interactive experiences. Why would you want to disable them? Well,
Java sometimes loads slowly, and JavaScript effects are sometimes so inter-
active they’re just annoying. However, if you disable either technology, many
Web sites might stop working properly. These options are intended only for
advanced users who understand the consequences.
Fortunately, you can prevent annoying JavaScript effects without turning off
JavaScript entirely. See Chapter 21 for more information about this feature.
Fonts and Colors
Web site designers, like other artists, spend a great deal of time crafting their
work. Nevertheless, you can override the fonts and colors used on Web sites
to suit your tastes. See Chapter 19 for more information about these options.
The Tabs category
Use the settings in the Tabs category (see Figure 16-6) to configure the
tabbed browsing experience. See Chapter 7 for more information about
tabbed browsing, and the section on tweaking tabs in particular for help with
each option.

The Downloads category
The Downloads category, shown in Figure 16-7, allows you to change the
default destination of downloaded files and configure the behavior of the
Firefox Download Manager. See Chapter 11 for more information.

Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

Download Folder
By default, Firefox saves files you download to your computer’s desktop so
you can find and open them easily. However, you can modify this behavior:
 To be prompted for a destination each time you download, select the
Ask Me Where to Save Every File option.
 To skip the prompt and save all files to the same location, select the
Save All Files to This Folder option and click Browse to choose a folder.
By default, Firefox downloads all files to your computer’s desktop.
If you specify a default download location (or leave it as the desktop), you
can override the save destination for a specific file by right-clicking the link
to the file and choosing Save Link As. You can also press Alt (Windows) or
Option (Mac) while clicking the download link. I discuss this feature at length
in Chapter 11.
Download Manager
By default, Firefox opens the Download Manager when you begin a download
and leaves it open when the download finishes so you can open the new file.
If the Download Manager is already open when a download begins, Firefox
simply flashes the button for the window on your computer taskbar so you
know.
Deselect the Show Download Manager check box in this category if you don’t
want the Download Manager to open when you start a download. Alternatively,
you can leave it on but select the Close the Download Manager check box to
have the Download Manager close automatically when all downloads finish.
Even if you select this option, Firefox (Windows) briefly shows an animated
message in the bottom-right corner of the window when your downloads
finish. You can click this message before it disappears to open the Download
Manager and access the finished downloads.
Download Actions
Most people pick up certain downloading habits over the years. Every time I
download a document, for example, I immediately open it in Microsoft Word.
Firefox can save you time by automatically taking a certain action whenever a
download finishes. Clicking the View & Edit Actions button opens a window
that helps you configure this behavior. See Chapter 11 for more information.
The Advanced category
The Advanced category (see Figure 16-8) contains options intended for expe-
rienced Internet users.
225
Chapter 16: Setting Your Options

These options are divided into the following three tabs.
The General tab
The General tab lets you configure Firefox’s keyboard accessibility, some
advanced browsing features, and how Web sites offered in multiple languages
are displayed.
Accessibility
This area contains options that make Firefox more usable from the keyboard.
 Allow text to be selected with the keyboard: As you know, a flashing
line in a text box indicates your typing position. Set this option to show
a flashing line in Web sites you visit. Although you can’t type into Web
sites, you can select the text by using the keyboard, and the flashing line
indicates where the selection will begin.
To move the flashing line, click a spot on the page or use the keyboard
arrows. Then, to select the text to the right of the flashing line, press
Shift+→. Likewise, to select leftward, press Shift+→. The flashing line
also indicates where on the page the Find Bar (which I discuss in
Chapter 4) will begin searching.
 Begin finding when you begin typing: Set this preference to search for
text on a page just by starting to type, without having to open the Find
Bar first. See Chapter 21 for more information about this feature.

Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

Browsing
This area lets you configure certain advanced features of the browsing expe-
rience, such as whether large images are automatically resized to fit in the
Content area.
 Resize large images to fit in the browser window: By default, Firefox
automatically shrinks large images so you can view them without
scrolling. This feature kicks in only when you’re viewing a large image on
its own (for example, by right-clicking an image in a page and choosing
View Image from the contextual menu). Large images within a Web page
are not resized. When Firefox resizes an image, the mouse pointer
becomes a magnifying glass as you move it over the image. You can
restore a shrunken image to its original size by clicking it. Deselect this
option to turn off this feature.
 Use autoscrolling: If your mouse has a middle button, you can use auto-
scrolling to scroll a page quickly and automatically. See Chapter 21 for
more information about this feature. Deselect this option to turn off
autoscrolling.
 Use smooth scrolling: By default, Firefox scrolls a page in notches —
that is, it bumps the page up or down a certain amount each time you
scroll. Some people might find this behavior jerky when reading a docu-
ment line by line. Turn on smooth scrolling to have Firefox slide pages
up or down more smoothly each time you scroll. If you previously
browsed in Internet Explorer, you might feel more comfortable with
smooth scrolling because Internet Explorer uses it.
Languages
Firefox automatically detects the language of Web sites you visit so it can dis-
play them properly, but some sites are offered in multiple languages. Click
the Edit Languages button to open the Languages window. Use the drop-down
list and the Add button at the bottom of the window to add languages you
understand to the language list, and then use the Move Up and Move Down
buttons to organize the list according to your language preferences. When
Firefox encounters one of these Web sites, it chooses the highest language 
on your list that the page supports.
The Update tab
We developers occasionally update Firefox to fix defects and add features.
Likewise, extension developers, theme designers, and search engine compa-
nies that offer Search Box add-ons are working hard to improve their prod-
ucts. By default, Firefox checks for updates to itself and to each of these other
components once a day and automatically installs any that are available.
227
Chapter 16: Setting Your Options

To configure this automatic behavior or to see a complete history of the
updates installed, do any of the following on the Update tab:
 To prevent Firefox from automatically checking for updates, deselect
the check boxes for the components for which Firefox should stop
checking. You can deselect any of the following:
• Firefox: Updates to the Firefox product itself. I don’t recommend
disabling automatic checking for Firefox because then you won’t
be aware of critical Firefox updates that fix security flaws and
other important bugs.
• Installed Extensions and Themes: Updates to any of the exten-
sions or themes you have installed.
• Search Engines: Updates to any search engines you added to the
Search Box in the upper-right corner of the main Firefox window,
as I discuss in Chapter 4.
 To prevent automatic installation of available updates, select Ask Me
What I Want to Do to have Firefox display the Update Wizard whenever
an update is available. By default, Firefox automatically installs most
available updates to Firefox itself as well as to your installed extensions,
themes and Search Box engines. However, if a Firefox update is incom-
patible with at least one of your installed extensions or themes, Firefox
warns you before installing the update. If you leave automatic updating
enabled, you can turn off this warning by deselecting the Warn Me If
This Will Disable Extensions or Themes check box. For more information
about extension and theme compatibility, see the section on updating
Firefox in Chapter 15, and check out Chapters 17 (on themes) and 20 
(on extensions).
 To see a list of installed updates, click the Show Update History button
to open the Update History window.
See Chapter 15 for help with Firefox updates, Chapter 17 for help with theme
updates, and Chapter 20 for help with extension updates.
The Security tab
Firefox is built to keep you secure, which means you shouldn’t touch the
security options unless you’re an advanced systems administrator. See
Chapter 15 for things you can do to stay safe online.

M
y living room has a mahogany coffee table, a handsome grand piano
finished in jet black, and a big gray box that whirs. Why are computers
so drab? And what can anyone do about it?
Although we developers don’t have the time to build computers, we’re doing
what we can on the Firefox front. Firefox supports themes that completely
change the look and feel of the browsing interface while leaving all your fea-
tures intact. An elegant glass finish, a wooden feel, something bright and silly
for your inner child, even a scene from a movie — whatever your tastes,
you’re sure to find something you like among the hundreds of available
Firefox themes.
Going to the Theme Park
The Mozilla Foundation maintains an official list of the best themes at a site
called Mozilla Update (http://themes.mozilla.org). You don’t need to
remember that address because it’s linked from the Theme Manager, which I
talk about momentarily. Millions of people use the themes on this site, but
because we don’t create them ourselves, we can’t guarantee your satisfaction.
Like extensions (see Chapter 20), most themes are created not by the core
Firefox team but by volunteer developers during their spare time. Therefore,
some themes might not work properly, and others might have undesirable
side effects, such as slowing down Firefox. Some, of course, might just be
ugly!

Mozilla Update organizes themes into categories, as shown in Figure 17-1.
Some of these categories indicate theme content, such as Nature and Sports,
and others indicate the approximate size of a theme’s buttons, like Compact
and Large. Click a category to see its description and a list of its themes.
Most themes offer a small preview that gives you a taste of what to expect.
I include a sampling of my favorite themes in Figures 17-2 and 17-3. If you’re
feeling overwhelmed, try the Popular or Top Rated categories to see what
other Firefox users enjoy. You can also click a particular theme to read
reviews from people who tried it, as shown in Figure 17-1.
Mozilla Update isn’t the only place to find themes. Many designers offer their
themes on their own home pages, and even Hollywood is getting into the act.
For example, on the Warner Bros’ Web site, the Batman Begins movie offered
a Batman theme. Search Google (www.google.com) for Firefox Themes, and
be sure to regularly check the Newest category of Mozilla Update.
When you find an interesting theme, don’t spend a lot of time deciding whether
to try it. You can install and remove themes so quickly that it’s worth your
while to experiment. First, however, make sure you read the following section
on theme compatibility.

Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

Ensuring Theme Compatibility
Each theme is designed to work with a particular version of Firefox or a range
of versions. This seems strange at first, but makes more sense when you con-
sider that each version of Firefox adds some new features. A designer has
trouble theming a feature that hasn’t been invented yet, just as a painter
can’t paint a room that hasn’t been built.
Firefox prevents you from installing an incompatible theme, but you can save
yourself some trouble by ensuring a theme’s compatibility before installing it.

Chapter 17: Finding Your Dream Theme

Mozilla Update provides a theme’s compatibility information below its Install
link in the form of a range of Firefox versions that it supports (for example,
Firefox 1.0–1.5). If a theme supports only one version, the endpoints of the
range are identical (for example, Firefox 1.0–1.0). Make sure that your version
of Firefox, which you can find out by choosing Help➪About Mozilla Firefox),
falls within the listed range.
Even if you use a theme that’s compatible with your version of Firefox, prob-
lems can occur if you’re using an extension that changes or extends the Firefox
interface. (See Chapter 20 for information about extensions.) Firefox does the
best it can to apply your theme to installed extensions, but some things might
look funny or stop working. In such cases, you will need to switch back to the
default Firefox theme or disable the problematic extension.
Whenever you update Firefox to a new version, it checks to make sure that
your installed themes remain compatible. If it finds any that aren’t, Firefox
notifies you and disables the incompatible themes until their designers
release updated versions. Firefox checks for updates about once a day, but
you can check manually at any time, as I explain in “Updating Themes,” later
in this chapter.
Installing and Applying Themes
After you’ve found a theme you like at Mozilla Update or elsewhere (see
“Going to the Theme Park” at the beginning of this chapter), installing it is
quick and easy. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Install link.
Firefox displays a confirmation window, as shown in Figure 17-4.
2. Click Install to continue with the installation.
The Theme Manager opens so you can track the installation progress, as
shown in Figure 17-5.
3. When the installation finishes, select the new theme in the Theme
Manager list and click the Use Theme button at the bottom of the
window.
4. Restart Firefox if you want to apply the new theme immediately. If
not, you can now close the Theme Manager.
You must restart Firefox before the theme change takes effect, although
you don’t have to do it now.
To return to the Theme Manager later on, choose Tools➪Themes.
232
Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

Updating Themes
Firefox automatically checks for updates to (new versions of) your installed
themes about once a day and installs any that are available. If you don’t want
Firefox to check or install updates automatically, you can disable this func-
tionality, as I discuss in the section on updating Firefox in Chapter 15. You
can check for updates manually at any time by clicking the Find Updates
button at the bottom of the Theme Manager (choose Tools➪Themes).
Some theme authors update their themes to improve the look and feel of the
design, but most of the time, designers update their themes to be compatible
with a new version of Firefox, which is necessary for the reasons I discuss in
“Ensuring Theme Compatibility,” earlier in this chapter.
When a new version of Firefox is made available, most theme authors update
their themes to be compatible with the new version, although it might take
them two or more weeks. Although Firefox checks for updates to itself each

themes from

Manager.
Figure 17-4:

233
Chapter 17: Finding Your Dream Theme

day at the same time it checks for theme updates, Firefox asks you before
installing an update that is incompatible with any of your installed themes. If
you proceed with the update, Firefox disables the incompatible themes but
continues to check for updates to them each day. When an update is avail-
able, Firefox installs it automatically and allows you to switch back to the
now-compatible theme.
Each theme has a version number. The designer uses this number to keep
track of the themes. You don’t need to worry about it; just remember that the
higher the number, the newer the theme.
Troubleshooting Themes
If you experience a problem in Firefox after installing a theme, you can launch
Firefox in a special Safe Mode that temporarily disables the current theme and
resorts to the default. Safe Mode also disables your current extensions (see
Chapter 20 for more information about extensions). If the problem isn’t present
in Safe Mode, either your theme or one of your extensions is causing it. Try dis-
abling the theme or your extensions one by one (from the Theme Manager and
the Extension Manager, respectively) until the problem disappears.
To open Firefox in Safe Mode in Windows, shut down Firefox if it is currently
open, and then choose Start➪Programs➪Mozilla Firefox➪Mozilla Firefox
(Safe Mode).
To open Firefox in Safe Mode on a Mac, you need to enter a special command
into the Macintosh Terminal. First, open the Terminal from
Applications➪Utilities➪Terminal. Then type the following and press Enter:
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox –safe-mode
If you installed Firefox to a different location, you need to modify the path
accordingly.
Uninstalling Themes
If things just aren’t working out between you and a particular theme, you can
uninstall it from the Theme Manager (Tools➪Themes). Simply select it in the
list and click the Uninstall button at the bottom, and then click OK when
Firefox asks you to confirm. It’s okay to uninstall the theme you’re currently
using — Firefox falls back to the default theme, and the uninstalled theme
cries on a friend’s shoulder — but you need to restart Firefox before the
change takes effect. Just remember you can’t uninstall the default theme.

f you’ve ever struggled to set the clock in your car — just turn off the AC
and press Eject while going 61.5 mph, of course! — you’ll appreciate the
toolbar customization features in Firefox. The toolbars are those collections
of buttons and text boxes that sit at the top of every Firefox window. Like
your car’s dashboard, the toolbars offer quick access to features you might
use hundreds of times a day — such as going back to the previous page.
Unlike your car’s dashboard, Firefox toolbars are completely configurable.
This chapter shows you how you can add, remove, and rearrange the toolbar
items and even create new toolbars to ensure that the things you do regularly
are always within reach and easy to use . . . unlike your car clock.
Changing the Items on Your Toolbars
Firefox is designed to be simple, and to that end, its toolbars offer access
only to those features that nearly everyone needs every day — features 
such as Back, Forward, and Search. However, Firefox is also designed to be
simple to customize. If you can drag and drop, you can give your toolbars a
makeover by adding buttons that offer new functionality and by sprucing up
the toolbar layout. The following sections look at the powerful Customize
Toolbar window that makes all this possible.
You can’t customize the menu bar (the topmost bar, with File, Edit, and so
on) in the Mac version of Firefox.

Adding items to the toolbar
By default, Firefox offers only a limited set of buttons on its toolbars.
However, Firefox has a large collection of buttons from which you can choose
to customize your toolbars as you like.
Many extensions, such as the Google Toolbar (http://toolbar.google.
com), add items to the Customize Toolbar window when you install them. You
can add these items to your toolbars in the same way you add the default
items, by following the instructions in this section. See Chapter 20 for more
information about extensions.
Follow these steps to add an item to the toolbar:
1. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Customize.
The Customize Toolbar window appears, as shown in Figure 18-1.
You can access this window more quickly by right-clicking on the Home,
Reload, Stop, or Go buttons (or anywhere on the menu bar if you’re
using Windows), and then choosing Customize from the contextual
menu that appears.

2. Drag the item you want to add from the Customize Toolbar window
and drop it onto the desired spot on a toolbar.
A black line indicates where the item will be inserted when you drop it,
as shown in Figure 18-2.
3. When you’re done adding buttons, click Done to close the Customize
Toolbar window.
At any given time, the Customize Toolbar window displays only those items
that aren’t already on one of the toolbars.
You might want to enlarge the Customize Toolbar window by dragging the
window border so you can view its entire collection of buttons in one 
screen without having to scroll.
Rearranging toolbar items
Firefox makes it easy to rearrange toolbar items if, for example, you want to
move a button you click frequently to a more prominent location.
To move an item, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Customize to open the Customize Toolbar
window and enter toolbar customization mode.
You can access this window more quickly by right-clicking on the Home,
Reload, Stop, or Go buttons (or anywhere on the menu bar if you’re
using Windows), and then choosing Customize from the contextual
menu that appears.
2. Drag the toolbar item you want to move to its desired spot.
A black line indicates the position where the item will appear after you
drop it.

the item will be inserted.

Chapter 18: Tailoring Your Toolbars 

For example, suppose you want the Stop and Reload buttons (as shown
in Figure 18-3) to change places. Simply drag the Reload button and drop
it to the right of the Stop button, as illustrated in Figure 18-4.
As soon as you release the mouse button, the Reload button appears in
its new location. Rather than leaving an empty space in the toolbar,
Firefox automatically shifts the Stop button over to where the Reload
button used to be, as shown in Figure 18-5.
3. Click Done to close the Customize Toolbar window.

Removing toolbar items
First, make sure you have the Customize Toolbar window open by choosing
View➪Toolbars➪Customize. Then, to remove an item, drag the item you want
to remove from the toolbar to the Customize Toolbar window. Surrounding
toolbar items shift over automatically. Firefox tries to make efficient use of
toolbar space wherever possible. For example, if you remove the Go button,
Firefox automatically extends the Location Bar instead of leaving an empty
space on the toolbar.
Using special items: Spacing out
Many people squish all their toolbar items into as little space as possible in
order to increase the screen space for Web viewing. Some people, however,
prefer having empty space on their toolbars, either to reduce clutter or to
visually group related items together. Firefox offers several special items from
the Customize Toolbar window for managing space:
 Separator: A Separator is a thin vertical line frequently used to divide
toolbar items into related groups. Figure 18-6 illustrates using a
Separator to distinguish a group of Cut, Copy, and Paste buttons from
the standard navigational group.
 Space: A Space is — as the name suggests — a small bit of horizontal
space you can use to separate two adjacent items. Some people like to
use Spaces like Separators to delineate a group of related toolbar items;
others just find aesthetic appeal in having more spacious and less clut-
tered toolbars. Figure 18-7 illustrates using a space rather than a separa-
tor to distinguish the group of Cut, Copy, and Paste buttons. Notice that
the bottom part of Figure 18-7 shows how the space fades into the tool-
bar color when you close the Customize Toolbar window.

Chapter 18: Tailoring Your Toolbars 

 Flexible Space: A Flexible Space is very similar to a Space, except that
instead of offering a fixed amount of space, a Flexible Space stretches to
fill all the unused space in the toolbar to which you add it.
The toolbar design in the Windows version of Firefox contains a Flexible
Space by default. Look in the top-right corner of the Firefox window, and
you see a small image called the Activity Indicator, which animates when
a Web site is loading. This image is separated from the Firefox menus
with a Flexible Space, which is revealed when you open the Customize
Toolbar window, as shown in Figure 18-8. If you’d like, you can remove
this Flexible Space by dragging it back into the Customize Toolbar
window, just as you remove other toolbar items.

Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

The Firefox Location Bar is designed to be flexible in that it also stretches 
to fill unused space on whatever toolbar it resides on to give you plenty 
of space to view the current address. If you place a Flexible Space in the 
same toolbar as the Location Bar, the Location Bar wins out and takes up 
the unused space, and the Flexible Space is reduced to a thin black line
(since, sadly, it has no space to take up).
241
Chapter 18: Tailoring Your Toolbars 
What’s the best toolbar design?
Most people tend to think of software develop-
ment as a technical discipline with little creative
outlet. Sometimes the other Firefox team mem-
bers and I wish that were true, because the
debate over what constitutes the best toolbar
design turned out to be one of the most divisive
and heated in our development history. This
wasn’t a question of code. It was a question of,
quite frankly, what feels right. Of the thousands
of possible toolbar arrangements, which one
offers the best balance of ease-of-use and aes-
thetics? Which is spacious without stealing pre-
cious screen real estate from Web sites? Which
will adequately distinguish Firefox from other
browsers without being so inconsistent that it’s
impossible to figure out?
To understand why the toolbar is such a big deal,
consider how many times a day you click that
Back button. Serious Internet surfers use the
Firefox toolbars for hours at a time every day. An
ugly, distracting, or nonintuitive toolbar design
would be a deal-breaker for most people, even if
they didn’t consciously understand what it was
that didn’t feel right about Firefox. Even though
we intended to offer customization tools, we
knew that the overwhelming majority of our
target audience would lack the time or technical
literacy to fix our toolbar mistakes. And we
couldn’t just fix the toolbars in a subsequent
release because that would be a jarring change
to people who had grown accustomed to them.
We had one shot at toolbar perfection.
One of the major points of contention during
what we now call the Toolbar Wars was whether
Firefox should follow other browsers in giving the
Location Bar its own toolbar or try something
new by merging the navigation buttons and the
Location Bar into a single toolbar.
The first route was tried and true. Even if it wasn’t
the greatest design in the world, people expected
it, which made it the safer route. Because it
devoted an entire toolbar to buttons, the design
would also allow us to include a variety of buttons
to access features like Bookmarks and History,
just as the popular Internet Explorer does.
The second route was much riskier. No browser
had ever done it before. And it had very little
space for buttons beyond the core set (Back,
Forward, Stop, Reload, and Home) because we
needed to keep the Location Bar a reasonable
size so you could read its contents. But as we
talked with people, a funny thing happened: We
realized that the “disadvantages” were actually
benefits. People didn’t want a toolbar that offered
access to everything under the sun. They wanted
to go back, forward, and home. They wanted to
stop and reload a page. And that was it. When we
gave them trial versions of the new design for
testing, hardly anyone missed the Bookmarks or
Print buttons — they lauded the simplicity. Firefox
1.0 launched with the new design and nearly all of
its competitors have since changed their designs.
Of course, this chapter tells you everything you
need to know to revert to the old-style layout if
you prefer it.

These special items are for cosmetic purposes only and don’t do anything
when you click them.
Unlike the other items in the Customize Toolbar window, these special layout
items don’t disappear from that window after you drag them to a toolbar. You
can drag as many Separators, Spaces, and Flexible Spaces onto the toolbars
as you want.
Using the special Bookmarks 
Toolbar Items item
As I discuss in Chapter 5, Firefox allows you to add your most frequently
accessed bookmarks to the Bookmarks Toolbar (the bottom toolbar) for
quick access. The Bookmarks Toolbar Items item represents this set of book-
marks, enabling you to move all the bookmarks to a different toolbar by drag-
ging a single item. Note that, by default, this item exists on the Bookmarks
Toolbar instead of in the Customize Toolbar window, but it appears only
when the Customize Toolbar window is open.
Adding, Hiding, and Removing Toolbars
As I discuss in the “What’s the best toolbar design?” sidebar, Firefox develop-
ers have done plenty of brainstorming about toolbar design. That doesn’t
mean we got it right. Fortunately, you can create your own masterpiece tool-
bars, then hide or remove ours (sniffle). This section shows you how.
Creating new toolbars
If you’re a power user with a penchant for buttons or just someone who
prefers a more spacious arrangement, you might find yourself wishing that
Firefox had more toolbars. No matter: Firefox allows you to add as many tool-
bars as you need.
1. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Customize to open the Customize Toolbar
window.
You can access this window more quickly by right-clicking the Home,
Reload, Stop, or Go buttons (or by right-clicking anywhere on the menu
bar if you’re using Windows), and then choosing Customize from the
contextual menu that appears.
2. In the Customize Toolbar window, click the Add New Toolbar button.
242
Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

3. When prompted (see Figure 18-9), enter a name for the new toolbar
and click OK.
This is the name that will appear in the list when you choose View➪
Toolbars. By default, Firefox comes with two toolbars, the Navigation
Toolbar and the Bookmarks Toolbar, so you can’t use those names.
Firefox creates and displays the new toolbar when you click OK.
4. Drag items onto the new toolbar as desired.
You can drag items either from existing toolbars or from the Customize
Toolbar window.
You must add at least one item to the new toolbar immediately, before
closing the Customize Toolbar window. If you leave the toolbar blank,
Firefox assumes you don’t want it and automatically deletes it.
5. Click Done to close the Customize Toolbar window.
Many developers have created toolbars with special functionality and offer
them as Firefox extensions, which I discuss in Chapter 20, that you can install
quickly. Two of the most popular are the Google Toolbar (http://toolbar.
google.com) and the Yahoo! Toolbar (http://toolbar.yahoo.com),
which make searching the Web easier, spell-check your online forms, trans-
late Web sites you visit to a language of your choosing, and provide a number
of other useful utilities.
Hiding toolbars temporarily
You can hide a Firefox toolbar at any time. For example, you might want to do
so to make more room for a Web site you’re viewing. Hidden toolbars stay
hidden until you decide to show them again, even if you close and then
reopen Firefox.
Figure 18-9:
Before you
can design
your toolbar,
you must
name it.
243
Chapter 18: Tailoring Your Toolbars 

To hide a toolbar, choose View➪Toolbars, and then select the name of the
toolbar you want to hide. To show the toolbar later, return to the menu and
choose the toolbar’s name again. The list displays a check mark next to each
toolbar that is being shown.
You can quickly access this list by right-clicking the Home, Reload, Stop, 
or Go buttons (or by right-clicking anywhere on the menu bar if you’re 
using Windows).
Removing toolbars
Firefox allows you to remove all toolbars — even the built-in toolbars 
(except the top one on Windows, because it contains the menus).
Although you can recreate it with some effort, removing a toolbar is a perma-
nent action. Don’t do it unless you really don’t want a toolbar anymore. If 
you remove a built-in toolbar, you can restore it by following the directions 
in “Restoring the Default Configuration” later in this chapter, but doing so
restores all of the default toolbars and wipes out any toolbars you create. If
you just want to hide a toolbar temporarily (perhaps to make more room for
a Web site you’re viewing), see the preceding section.
To remove a toolbar:
1. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Customize to open the Customize Toolbar
window.
2. Drag all of the doomed toolbar’s items elsewhere — either to another
toolbar or into the Customize Toolbar window — and then click Done
in the Customize Toolbar window.
Firefox automatically deletes the empty toolbar.
Changing the Appearance 
of Your Toolbar Buttons
By default, the buttons on Firefox’s toolbars are comprised solely of images
that represent their respective functions. The Back button, for example, is
symbolized by a green arrow pointing left. Firefox lets you change the appear-
ance of buttons in a number of ways.
244
Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

For example, what if a mere image isn’t enough? You might find that you have
trouble remembering what a particular button does, especially if you add a
host of new buttons as I describe in the beginning of this chapter. To remedy
this problem, you can instruct Firefox to display explanatory text beneath
each button’s image (for example, Bookmarks or New Window) or even indi-
cate that you want buttons to consist of only text and no images at all.
To change the appearance of your toolbar buttons, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Customize to open the Customize Toolbar
window.
2. From the Show drop-down list, select one of the following options:
• Icons and Text: Indicates that toolbar buttons should consist of an
image followed by explanatory text underneath, as shown in the
top of Figure 18-10.
• Icons: Indicates that toolbar buttons should consist only of
images. This is the default.
• Text: Indicates that toolbar buttons should consist only of text and
no images.
If you select the Icons and Text option or the Icons option, you can also
specify whether the images that appear in toolbar buttons should be
large (the default) or small by using the Use Small Icons check box. This
isn’t just a cosmetic choice. Small icons conserve space and provide
more room for viewing Web sites, but they’re more difficult to click. The
top of Figure 18-10 shows Icons and Text mode with large icons, and the
bottom of Figure 18-10 shows Icons mode with large icons.
3. Click Done to close the Customize Toolbar window.

Chapter 18: Tailoring Your Toolbars 

Restoring the Default Configuration
Suppose you play around with the toolbars for a few hours and decide the
original way was the best after all. Now, how did that look again? And how
long will it take to get back there? Luckily, Firefox offers one-click access to
restore the default configuration at any time.
The restoration process really is as easy as a single click. There’s no confir-
mation window and no Undo button, so make sure you want to revert to the
original configuration before proceeding. You will lose all the changes you
have made to your toolbars — both built-in toolbars and extension toolbars
such as Google Toolbar — and any toolbars you created will be deleted.
1. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Customize to open the Customize Toolbar
window.
2. Click the Restore Default Set button to revert to the original Firefox
toolbars immediately.
There is no confirmation process and no way to undo this action.
246
Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 
Quicker clicking just for you
Not all of our decisions had such highly visible
ramifications as the Location Bar debate I
describe in the “What’s the best toolbar
design?” sidebar in this chapter. In fact, another
one revolved around a single pixel! Think about
that Back button again. Suppose it takes you 1
second to navigate to and click it, and you do
that 60 times a day. That’s a minute a day, or 365
minutes — over 6 hours — per year! Isn’t there
some way we could speed that up just a little bit
and save you some time?
Yup. Think about when you click the X button in
the top-right corner of the window. Not very
strenuous, is it? That’s because you don’t need
to spend any time at all locating the button.
Because it’s located in the rightmost and upper-
most part of the screen, all you have to do is jam
your mouse into the corner as far as it will go
and click. If the button were shifted just one
pixel down or left, you would have to spend an
additional half-second every time ensuring that
the cursor is in the right place before clicking.
The same is true of the Back button. Although we
can’t put it in a screen corner, we can ensure
that it’s aligned properly with the left edge of the
screen so you only have to find the button verti-
cally. The Firefox toolbar used to have a thin
border that prevented the toolbar from butting up
against the screen edge, and we removed it for
exactly this reason.
You can rest assured that every aspect of
Firefox has received this kind of careful scrutiny.
We’re worried about you down to the pixel.

I
f you went over to a friend’s house and started redecorating, he probably
wouldn’t be too thrilled. But in Firefox, you’re free to tweak the sites you
visit to be more comfortable. This includes changing colors and text size,
turning off images, and enlarging the viewing area. Of course, none of your
changes affect other visitors.
Enlarging and Shrinking Text
If you’ve ever squinted at tiny text or grumbled at enormous headlines, you’ll
appreciate Firefox’s resizing features. If you just need to tweak a particular
site, you can change the text size in the current tab or window. However, you
can also resize the text of all Web sites you visit.
Resizing text for the current tab or window
To resize the text on only the Web sites you visit in the current tab or
window, choose View➪Text Size and then choose Increase or Decrease
accordingly. If the text still isn’t as large or small as you’d like, you can con-
tinue resizing. Figure 19-1 shows Memeorandum (a great Web site for keeping
up on what bloggers are talking about) at normal size, and Figure 19-2 shows
the page after using the Increase command twice.

Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

On Windows, press Ctrl++ (that’s Ctrl and the plus sign) to enlarge text and
Ctrl+- (the minus sign) to shrink it. The Macintosh shortcuts are Ô++ and Ô+-, 
respectively.
Any Web sites you visit in the current tab or window use the new text size. To
return to normal size, choose View➪Text Size➪Normal or press Ctrl+0 (Ô+0
on Macintosh). Of course, you could also just start browsing in a new tab or
window.
Resizing text permanently
Resizing the text on all Web sites you visit involves more steps than resizing
for a single window, but it’s also permanent, so you only have to do it once:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Content icon at the top of the Options window.
3. In the Fonts & Colors section at the bottom, ignore the Default Font
settings and click Advanced to open the Fonts window. Default Font is
just a subset of the options in the Fonts window, and you should set
the options in the Fonts window to affect all sites.
The Fonts window offers a variety of complicated options, but you don’t
need to worry about all of them right now. Basically, many different
styles of text exist (such as Serif and Monospace), and the Web site
designer picks a style. Firefox lets you control which font and size are
used for each style.
4. (Optional) Use any of the following techniques to resize text as needed:
• To override the font size on all pages, choose the new size from the
Size drop-down lists next to Proportional and Monospace. Figure
19-3 illustrates the proper settings to use if you want Web sites to
display text at size 18.
• To set a minimum size, use the Minimum Font Size drop-down list.
This is a good option if you’re concerned about readability but
don’t need everything to be one particular size.
5. (Optional) To override all Web page fonts, choose the new font from
the Serif, Sans-Serif, and Monospace drop-down lists, and then dese-
lect the Allow Pages to Choose Their Own Fonts check box.
Because designers go to great trouble to design pixel-perfect Web sites,
it’s probably best to leave Web site fonts alone. Changing them could
affect the readability or the attractiveness of pages you visit.

7. Click OK to save your changes and close the Options window.

Changing Web Site Colors
For all its virtues, the Web makes some things a little too easy. Now that
you’ve become used to reading black text on a white background, for exam-
ple, many Web sites have started to reverse the trend. As far as I’m con-
cerned, these white-on-black designs are an eyesore. Firefox allows you to

Preventing annoying tricks
Most sites on the Net are well-behaved, but as
with anything, a few bad apples crop up. You’ve
probably run into a couple during your online
travels. Sometimes they use flashy tricks that
distract you while you read the page. Certain
Web sites, for example, scroll text in the Firefox
Status Bar like those stock tickers in Times
Square, or blink text to catch your eye again . . .
and again . . . and again.
One of the most devious things a site can do is
disable the contextual menu. If you’ve ever
right-clicked a page only to see a message
about copyright, or simply nothing at all, you can
appreciate just how annoying this is. Usually,
sites block the contextual menu to prevent you
from accessing the Save Image As command if
they don’t want you to take copyrighted images.
It’s an exceedingly arrogant move: after all,
they’re also preventing you access to all the
other commands in the menu, not to mention
that it’s your menu. And it’s a futile effort,
anyway: You could retrieve the image via copy
and paste, by saving the entire Web site, or
through a number of other methods.
Whatever devious tricks a Web site decides to
use, Firefox has you covered. See Chapter 21 for
instructions on keeping the bad apples in line.

override the text, background, and link color of every site so you can view
the Web the way you want:
Designers go to great lengths to design pixel-perfect Web sites, so forcing
Web sites to use your own color scheme could lead to unreadable or awk-
ward-looking pages. Feel free to experiment with these features (since it’s
easy to undo your changes), but be aware of this consequence.
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Content icon at the top of the Options window.
3. In the Fonts & Colors section at the bottom, click the Colors button.
The Colors window appears. The boxes next to Text, Background, Visited
Links, and Unvisited Links indicate the current color of each element.
4. Click the color boxes to select new colors, as shown in Figure 19-4.
Under Text and Background, you can select Use System Colors to have
Firefox use your computer’s default window background and text colors.
These colors are specified in your system’s control panel.
You can also determine whether Firefox underlines links with the
Underline Links check box in the Link Colors boxed group. By default,
links are underlined so you can spot them more quickly.
As the name suggests, a Visited link is a link to a Web site you’ve seen
before. It’s a good idea to select different colors for Visited and
Unvisited under Link Colors so you can tell at a glance which links
you’ve already followed.
5. Deselect the Allow Pages to Choose Their Own Colors check box at
the bottom.
Because you’re forcing Web sites to use your background color, you’re
preventing them from using background images. Some sites use a back-
ground image for a wallpaper-like effect, and others use it to display a
navigational bar at the top of the page.

Chapter 19: Controlling the Way Web Sites Look

Changing How Firefox Displays Images
It’s hard to believe, but when the Internet first launched over a decade ago, 
it had no images — just lots and lots of text. In a world of information overload,
however, there’s some charm to this austerity. There are two ways to control
how Firefox displays images: You can change which images are loaded, and
you can have Firefox automatically shrink images that are too large to fit on-
screen. I discuss these options in the following sections.
Disabling image loading
If you want to return to simpler times and enjoy a faster surfing experience,
you can turn off Web images:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Content icon at the top of the Options window.
3. Deselect the Load Images check box.
You can also choose to load images only for the originating Web site by
leaving the Load Images check box selected and instead selecting the
For the Originating Web Site Only check box beneath it. This option pre-
vents a Web site from displaying images that are part of another Web
site. It’s a reasonable way to block advertising on the Web, but it can
also break many pages, so I don’t recommend it. For a better way to
block ads, see the section on AdBlock in Chapter 22.
4. Click OK to save your changes and close the Options window.
Some Web designers associate brief textual descriptions with each of the
images on their page. This is useful both to display placeholder text when an
image isn’t loaded, and for screen-reading software that needs to describe on-
screen elements to users with vision problems. When Firefox doesn’t load an
image, it puts the textual description in its place if one is available, as shown
in Figure 19-5. Otherwise, the space is left empty.
Figure 19-4:
In the Colors
window,

Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

Turning off image autoshrinking
If you like most images but can’t stand the enormous ones that dominate your
screen, Firefox has you covered. Firefox automatically shrinks large images
(images that can’t be displayed entirely in the Content area without scrolling)
to fit inside the browser window. When this happens, the mouse pointer
becomes a magnifying glass as you move it over the image. To restore the
image to its original size, simply click it.
You can turn off this autoshrinking behavior from the Options window if it
bothers you:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Advanced icon at the top of the Options window.
3. On the General tab, under Browsing, deselect the Resize Large Images
to Fit in the Browser Window check box.
4. Click OK to save your changes and close the Options window.

Chapter 19: Controlling the Way Web Sites Look

Viewing Web Sites in Full Screen Mode
One of the design goals in Firefox is to maximize the amount of space avail-
able for viewing Web sites. Still, the other developers and I can do only so
much. You always need a menu bar and some toolbars, right?
Well, not necessarily. Full Screen mode allows you to hide all the clutter and
use the entire screen to view a Web site. If you’re using Windows, even the
taskbar at the bottom is hidden in Full Screen mode. Only a thin version of
the Navigation Toolbar remains, as shown in Figure 19-6, so you can access
common commands or exit Full Screen mode.
Full Screen mode is especially useful for viewing slideshows or presentations
or playing games within the browser, since it offers much more viewing space
and less surrounding clutter.

Although Full Screen mode hides the menu bar, keyboard shortcuts still
work. For example, you can still open the Bookmarks Sidebar by pressing
Ctrl+B. Full Screen mode is not available in Firefox for the Mac.
To enter Full Screen mode, choose View➪Full Screen or press F11. Firefox
stays in Full Screen mode until you exit it, which you can do by clicking the
Restore button in the top-right corner or by pressing F11 again.
Don’t click the X button to exit Full Screen mode, since doing so closes the
window as usual.

S
oftware is a compromise. Some parts are fantastic; others are lousy. The
features you don’t need are front and center, and the ones you’re crying
out for are nowhere to be found. You wish that button were a menu and that
menu a button. It isn’t perfect, but it’s the best tool out there, quirks and all.
Firefox is built to be extensible so you don’t have to settle. Unlike most soft-
ware, Firefox isn’t etched in stone. It’s more like a collection of building
blocks. We developers made the best design we could, but we invite you to
move blocks around, remove them altogether, and even add your own. This
flexibility is made possible through tiny applications called extensions, which
you can install into Firefox.
The great thing about extensions is that they don’t feel like extensions. Their
features are integrated into the main Firefox interface as if they’d been there
all along. Likewise, they can alter features that are already built in to Firefox.
Extensions don’t create a new, separate design; they work with the very
blocks that Firefox is made of.

Of course, you don’t have to make the extensions yourself. The Firefox develop-
ment community has already created hundreds of them for you, and develop-
ers release new ones each day. (I describe ten of the best extensions in
Chapter 22, so check it out for a more vivid sense of what extensions can do.)
All you have to do is decide what your perfect browser looks like, and then
mix and match the extensions that you want. What could be easier? This chap-
ter shows you where to find great extensions, and how to start using them.
Finding Great Extensions
Before you dash off to find these magnificent beauties, here’s a brief list of
some of the wonderful things extensions can do:
 Integrate other applications — such as your music player — into Firefox.
 Bring you content that other Web surfers find interesting.
 Introduce wacky new ways of surfing the Web, such as by making mouse
gestures.
 Remember the last Web sites you visited and restore them when you
restart Firefox.
 Expand Firefox’s built-in bookmarking tools to make your bookmarks
accessible when you’re on other computers.
 Show the latest news, weather, and other information within Firefox.
I list some of my favorite extensions in Chapter 22.
We maintain a list of the highest-quality extensions at a site called Mozilla
Update (http://addons.mozilla.org). You don’t need to remember that
address because it’s linked from the Extension Manager (see “Managing Your
Extensions” later in this chapter). Millions of people use the extensions 
on this site, so you can be reasonably assured they work as advertised.
However, because we don’t create them ourselves, we can’t guarantee your
satisfaction.
Mozilla Update organizes extensions into categories that typically cover a
specific area of Firefox, as shown in Figure 20-1. In the Download Tools cate-
gory, for example, you can find a download toolbar that completely replaces
the built-in Download Manager. Some categories, however, are broad and
unusual. For example, if you’re looking for an integrated egg timer, you can
find it in Humor. (Hey, nobody said extensions had to make sense.)
258
Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

If you’re feeling overwhelmed, I list ten excellent extensions in Chapter 22.
The front page of Mozilla Update also offers some great starting points. The
Most Popular section lists the most-downloaded extensions of the past week,
and Top Rated shows you the extensions with the highest overall ratings. I
strongly encourage you to rate extensions after you try them, and you can
also write reviews. Click an extension to see its reviews and other informa-
tion that might help you decide whether to try it, such as screenshots, a
description, and the Firefox versions it supports. Ensure that the extension
works in your version of Firefox, which is listed in Help➪About Mozilla
Firefox.
When you find an intriguing extension, don’t spend a lot of time deciding
whether to install it. You can install and remove extensions so quickly that
experimenting is worth your while.

Chapter 20: Extending Firefox

Because the Firefox team is busy working on the core product, most exten-
sions are developed by volunteers during their spare time. This means that
some extensions might not work and others might have undesirable side
effects.
Ensuring Extension Compatibility
Each extension is designed to work with a particular version of Firefox or a
range of versions. Firefox prevents you from installing an extension that is
incompatible with your current version of Firefox. However, you can save
yourself some trouble by ensuring an extension’s compatibility before you
try installing it. Mozilla Update provides an extension’s compatibility infor-
mation below its Install link in the form of a range of Firefox versions that it
supports (for example, Firefox 1.0–1.5). Simply make sure that your version of
Firefox, which is displayed in the About Mozilla Firefox window (Help➪About
Mozilla Firefox), falls within the listed range.
Whenever you update Firefox to a new version, it checks to make sure that
your installed extensions remain compatible. If it finds any that aren’t, Firefox
notifies you and disables the incompatible extensions until their developers
release updated versions. Firefox checks for updates about once a day, but
you can check manually at any time, as I explain in “Updating Extensions,”
later in this chapter.
Installing Extensions
In the earlier sections of this chapter, I talk only about extensions available
through Mozilla Update. However, many volunteers choose to offer exten-
sions through their own Web sites. Although these might work well, remem-
ber that we Firefox developers can verify the quality only of the extensions
on Mozilla Update, so you should install extensions only from other sites you
trust. In case you forget, Firefox makes it slightly more difficult to install
extensions from sources other than Mozilla Update. I discuss both proce-
dures here.
Installing from Mozilla Update
Installing an extension from Mozilla Update couldn’t be easier. When you find
an extension you like, click the Install Now link. Firefox asks you to confirm
the decision, as shown in Figure 20-2. Click Install Now to continue.
260
Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

You might notice that the Install Now button is unavailable for about two sec-
onds. This is to prevent you from inadvertently clicking it.
Firefox opens the Extension Manager to display the installation progress.
Installation is typically very fast, and when it finishes, you need to restart
Firefox before the extension will take effect. After restarting, see “Using
Extensions” later in this chapter for more information.
Installing from another site
Mozilla Update is not the only place to find great extensions. Many developers
offer their extensions on their own Web sites, and you can find these by
searching the Web for Firefox extensions. There are also some sites that aggre-
gate high-quality extensions, just like Mozilla Update, including the following:
 The Extension Room at http://extensionroom.mozdev.org
 The Extensions Mirror at www.extensionsmirror.nl
Firefox blocks the installation of extensions from other Web sites because
they might be broken or unsafe. When this happens, a toolbar appears at the
top of the Web site, as shown in Figure 20-3.
Figure 20-2:
Firefox asks
you to

installations.
Just click
Install Now;

the rest.
261
Chapter 20: Extending Firefox

To continue with installation, you need to verify that you trust the site:
1. Click the Edit Options button at the right end of the toolbar to open
the Allowed Sites window.
This window contains a list of sites that are allowed to install extensions.
By default, only Mozilla Update’s two sites are included on this list.
Firefox prefills the address of your current site.
2. If you’re sure the site is trustworthy, click Allow to add it to the list.
3. Click Close to close the Allowed Sites window.
Now that the site is in the trusted list, the installation process is the same as
on Mozilla Update. Click the install link again and follow the directions in the
earlier section, “Installing from Mozilla Update.”
This toolbar alerts you when Firefox blocks an extension installation.

Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

Using Extensions
Describing the use of an extension can be as hard as describing the plot of a
book. Hundreds of different extensions exist, and each has its own way of
doing things. Some extensions add entire sidebar panels or toolbars, as
shown in Figure 20-4, and others stick to a single button or menu item.
Extensions that modify existing Firefox features, rather than adding new
ones, might leave no trace at all.
Many extensions quietly add buttons that offer fast access to their features to
the Customize Toolbar window. You can drag these buttons to your toolbar,
as I discuss in Chapter 18. I recommend checking the Customize Toolbar
window after installing an extension.
Some extensions include built-in help systems, but the best source of help
usually is the Web site of the extension’s developer. You can access the 
Figure 20-4:
Some
extensions,
such as

sidebars
into Firefox.
263
Chapter 20: Extending Firefox

developer’s site from the Extension Manager, which I describe in the 
next section:
1. Choose Tools➪Extensions.
2. Right-click the extension you need help with and choose Visit Home
Page from the menu that appears.
A new Firefox window opens and loads the page.
If this option is unavailable, either the developer has no Web site, or he
forgot to list it. You can check for the latter by searching Google for the
extension name to see whether it comes up.
Managing Your Extensions
After you install an extension, you can use the Extension Manager (shown in
Figure 20-5) to configure, update, or remove it. To open the manager, choose
Tools➪Extensions.
Configuring extensions
Most extensions are highly configurable and like to flaunt it by adding their
own Options buttons or menu items. Some, however, are shyer and offer no
obvious access. Regardless of how an extension exposes its settings in the
main Firefox interface, you can always access its Options window through the
Extension Manager. Just select the extension you want to configure and click
the Options button at the bottom. If this button is unavailable, the extension
isn’t configurable.
Because each extension offers different options, it’s impossible to provide
more specific instructions here. The earlier section, “Using Extensions,”
explains how to get extension-specific help.

264
Part IV: Dressing Up the Fox 

Updating extensions
Firefox automatically checks for updates to (new versions of) your installed
extensions about once a day and installs any that are available. If you don’t
want Firefox to check for or install updates automatically, you can disable
this functionality as I discuss in the section on updating Firefox in Chapter 15.
You can check for updates manually at any time by clicking the Find Updates
button at the bottom of the Extension Manager.
Developers update their extensions to add features, to fix bugs, or to make
them compatible with a new version of Firefox, which is necessary for the rea-
sons I discuss in “Ensuring Extension Compatibility” earlier in this chapter.
When a new version of Firefox is made available, most developers update
their extensions to be compatible with the new version, although it may take
them two or more weeks. Although Firefox checks for updates to itself each
day at the same time it checks for extension updates, Firefox asks you before
installing an update that is incompatible with any of your installed exten-
sions. If you proceed with the update, Firefox disables the incompatible
extensions, but continues to check for updates to them each day. When an
update is available, Firefox installs it automatically and re-enables the now-
compatible extension.
Each extension has a version number. The developer uses this number to
keep track of his extensions. You don’t need to worry about it; just remember
that the higher the number, the newer the extension.
Removing extensions
Firefox offers three ways to turn off an extension depending on what you
want to do.
265
Chapter 20: Extending Firefox
A quick complaint about version numbers
You’re probably already familiar with the con-
cept of software versioning — the higher the
number, the newer the software. You’re probably
also aware — perhaps painfully so — that soft-
ware companies can’t agree on a standard and
therefore tend to version things however they
please. For example, Microsoft went from
Windows 98 to Windows ME to Windows 2000 to
Windows XP to the forthcoming Windows Vista.
Unfortunately, the situation isn’t much better in
extension land. Although virtually all developers
stick to numeric versions, they use varying
levels of complexity. Don’t be surprised if one
extension’s version is 0.4.7.241 and another’s is
7.2. My advice is to ignore the numbers entirely
and just remember that “higher is newer, and
newer is better.”

Uninstalling an extension
If you just want to get rid of an extension permanently, you can uninstall it
from the Extension Manager. Simply select it in the list and click the Uninstall
button at the bottom. You must restart Firefox to complete the process.
Disabling an extension
If you suspect that an extension is causing a problem in Firefox and want to
find out, you can disable it temporarily by right-clicking it in the Extension
Manager and choosing Disable. Like uninstalling, disabling requires a restart.
However, if it turns out that the extension was not the source of the problem,
you can re-enable it without having to reinstall it. Right-click it, choose
Enable, and then restart Firefox.
Disabling all extensions with Safe Mode
Disabling is a good way to test a single extension, but what if you have a
bunch? You would have to disable each extension one at a time to see
whether it’s the cause of the problem. That grows old fast, especially if it
turns out that none of the extensions is behind the problem. Even worse:
What if the problem you’re experiencing is that Firefox won’t start? Now you
can’t even get to the Extension Manager to turn off extensions. Safe Mode is
the answer to both problems.
If you experience a problem in Firefox after installing an extension, you can
launch Firefox in a special Safe Mode that temporarily disables all installed
extensions. If you are not using the default Firefox theme, Safe Mode also 
disables your current theme (see Chapter 17 for more information about
themes). If the problem isn’t present in Safe Mode, either your theme or one
of your extensions is causing it. If you’re using a special theme, first try
reverting to the default theme in Regular Mode and see if the problem per-
sists. If it does, follow the directions in the preceding two sections to disable
or uninstall your extensions until you fix the problem in Regular Mode.
To open Firefox in Safe Mode in Windows, shut down Firefox if it is currently
open, and then choose Start➪Programs➪Mozilla Firefox➪Mozilla Firefox
(Safe Mode).
To open Firefox in Safe Mode on a Mac, you need to enter a special command
into the Macintosh Terminal. First, open the Terminal by choosing
Applications➪Utilities➪Terminal. Then type the following and press Enter:
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/
firefox –safe-mode
If you installed Firefox to a different location, you need to modify the path
accordingly.

T
he Firefox interface is designed to be simple and intuitive. The goal is to
remove browser clutter so you can focus on the Web site, not on Firefox
itself. However, underneath its simple exterior, Firefox includes a handful of
little features to make your life easier, and we developers don’t want you to
miss them. Enjoy!
The Find Bar Can Read Your Mind
Chapter 4 introduces Firefox’s innovative Find Bar for searching within a Web
page. The Find Bar is built for speed: Rather than waiting until you finish
typing, it searches as you type. You can also open and close the Find Bar by
using keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+F to open, or Ô+F on a Mac, and Esc/Escape
to close on both systems), meaning you never need to reach for the mouse.
In spite of all that, searching can get even faster. What if you didn’t have to
worry about the Find Bar at all? If you turn on a mode called Fast Find, you
can tell Firefox to start searching a page whenever you begin typing. Firefox
automatically opens the Find Bar so you can keep track of what you type.

After you finish typing, Firefox automatically hides the Find Bar so it doesn’t
get in the way. To turn Fast Find mode on:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Select the Advanced icon at the top of the Options window.
3. On the General tab, under Accessibility, select the Begin Finding
When You Begin Typing check box.
4. Click OK to save your changes.
To try out the new behavior, load www.mozilla.org and begin typing
Firefox. Firefox opens the Find Bar and highlights in green the first occur-
rence of the word on the page. A few seconds after you stop typing, Firefox
automatically closes the Find Bar.
For this feature to work, the Web site itself — not the Location Bar, or any
other part of Firefox — must be focused. (The only way to tell whether a Web
site is focused is to press the up- and down-arrow keys and see if the Web site
scrolls.) The focus typically isn’t an issue because Firefox sets focus to the
Web site when you navigate to it. However, if Firefox doesn’t open the Find
Bar when you begin typing, try focusing the Web page first by clicking on a
dead space within the page (that is, text or empty space, but not a link). The
next search you conduct begins wherever you click.
Another nice thing about Fast Find mode is that it’s optimized for links. To
continue the earlier example, the first result for Firefox is actually a link to
the Firefox Web site. Fast Find lets you follow this link by using only the key-
board. One side effect of this feature is that keyboard shortcuts on the Find
Bar behave differently in Fast Find mode than they do in standard Find mode,
and I summarize the differences in Table 21-1.

Stopping Annoying Web Sites 
in Their Tracks
The Internet is a great resource, but the truth is that some Web sites are just
plain annoying. Perhaps they scroll text in the Firefox Status Bar when you’re
trying to read the page or disable the right-click menu so you can’t save an
image. Whatever the case, Firefox gives you complete control over your Web
experience by letting you prevent these and other annoying habits:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Select the Content icon at the top of the Options window.
3. Next to the Enable JavaScript check box, click Advanced.
JavaScript is a general-purpose technology that some sites abuse to
achieve these annoying effects.
4. In the window that appears, you can determine what a Web site can
and cannot do:
• Move or resize existing windows: This setting controls whether a
Web site can move or resize your current Firefox window. By
default, Firefox allows Web sites to do this. 
• Raise or lower windows: This setting controls whether a Web site
can focus and defocus Firefox windows. For example, if you loaded
Web sites simultaneously in two separate windows, one of the Web
sites could steal focus, and that window would be brought to your
attention. Firefox allows Web sites to do this by default.
• Disable or replace context menus: This setting controls whether a
Web site is able to disable the menu that appears when you right-
click or replace it with something else. By default, Web sites are
allowed to do this in Firefox. Some Web site owners use this to
271
Chapter 21: Ten Secrets to a Foxier Web

stop you from accessing the Save Image As command so you can’t
take their images. This is an illegitimate use, because there are
many other commands on the contextual menu that the Web site
is also preventing you from accessing, and because there’s nothing
unethical or illegal about saving an image for personal use. Other
owners, however, use it for legitimate reasons. For example, if you
were playing a game of Minesweeper online, you wouldn’t want the
contextual menu to appear each time you right-click.
• Hide the Status Bar: This setting controls whether a Web site can
hide the Status Bar in any windows it opens. Malicious Web site
authors might try to hide the Status Bar to obscure the crucial
information it offers about a page’s location and security status.
Thus, by default, Web sites aren’t allowed to hide the Status Bar.
• Change Status Bar text: This setting controls whether a Web site
can change the text that appears in the Status Bar. By default,
Firefox prevents Web sites from doing this. Firefox uses the Status
Bar to display progress while a page loads, and to display a link’s
destination when you move the mouse over it. Some Web sites
change the Status Bar text for legitimate reasons, such as to pro-
vide helpful information. Others do so to display distracting wel-
come messages or marquees or to obscure the true destinations of
malicious links so they appear to lead somewhere benign.
5. Click OK to close the Advanced JavaScript Settings window.
6. Click OK to save your changes and close the Options window.
Making Your Privacy 
a One-Button Affair
Firefox compiles a variety of records about your travels on the Internet.
Firefox doesn’t transmit these records anywhere; they exist only for your
convenience. For example, Firefox maintains a list of the Web sites you visit
so you can return to them later. Chapter 14 describes the records Firefox
keeps and shows you how to handle them if you’re concerned about privacy.
However, if you turn off these records, you’ll probably miss them later on.
Instead of turning them off, you can permit Firefox to keep records, but use its
Clear Private Data feature to clear them regularly. Ordinarily, Firefox asks you
which records to clear each time you use the feature. However, if you clear pri-
vate data frequently, you might want to tell Firefox to stop asking that question:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
272
Part V: The Part of Tens 

2. Click the Privacy icon at the top of the Options window.
3. Click the Settings button at the bottom of the window to open the
Clear Private Data settings window.
4. Select the types of records you want to clear regularly and ensure that
all other records are deselected.
If a type of record isn’t selectable, Firefox currently has no records of 
the type.
5. Deselect the Ask Me Before Clearing Private Data check box.
To turn the window back on later, just return to the Clear Private Data
settings window and select this check box.
6. Click OK to close the Clear Private Data settings window.
7. Click OK to save your changes and close the Options window.
Now Firefox stops prompting you each time you use the Clear Private Data
feature, which you access by choosing Tools➪Clear Private Data. On
Windows, this feature also has a keyboard shortcut, so clearing your records
is as simple as pressing Ctrl+Shift+Del whenever you’re using Firefox.
Put It on My Tab!
Firefox is very humble about its tabbed browsing feature, which I explain in
depth in Chapter 7. In fact, many tab fanatics say they had no idea it existed
even weeks into using Firefox. We developers intentionally hid the feature so
people who were accustomed to the old way of surfing wouldn’t be over-
whelmed when they switched to Firefox. However, tabs are seamlessly woven
throughout the browser, just waiting for you to discover them.
Here are some easy ways to open tabs in Firefox:
 Using the middle mouse button: If your mouse has a middle button —
or a scroll wheel that doubles as a button — you’re in luck. At Firefox
headquarters, we call this the tab button because it offers access to a
new tab from virtually anywhere. Naturally, it works on links within Web
sites, but it also works throughout the Firefox interface. Want to open a
bookmark in a new tab? Just middle-click it, whether you’re opening it
from the Bookmarks Sidebar, the Manager, the Toolbar or (in Windows)
the Bookmarks menu. The same goes for Web page history, whether
you’re using the Go menu or the History Sidebar. The basic rule is that
you can middle-click anything that would normally load a Web site in
your current tab to open it in a new tab: Back and Forward buttons,
Home, you name it!
273
Chapter 21: Ten Secrets to a Foxier Web

 Ctrl+clicking items: Don’t have a middle mouse button? No problem.
You can Ctrl+click (or Ô+click on a Mac) Web page links and entries in
your bookmarks and history lists to open them in new tabs. In other
words, hold the Ctrl (or Ô) key while left-clicking items.
 Using the contextual menus: So, you don’t have a middle mouse button
and you don’t want to reach for the keyboard. In the case of bookmarks,
history and Web site links, Firefox still has you covered in most cases.
Simply right-click them and choose to open a new tab from the contex-
tual menu that appears. If you’re using a Mac and you use a mouse with-
out a right button, you can hold the left mouse button for a second or
two, and the context menu appears.
 Using Alt+Enter (Option+Enter on a Mac): This is a handy keyboard
shortcut when you don’t feel like reaching for the mouse. You primarily
use this shortcut in the Location Bar: Simply type an address and hold
Alt (or Option on a Mac) while pressing Enter to open it in a new tab. 
 Double-clicking the tab bar: You can open a new tab at any time by
double-clicking empty space in the tab bar (in other words, anywhere
but on an existing tab).
 Dragging a link onto the tab bar: To open a link in a new tab, simply
drag it to the tab bar. If you drop it on an existing tab, the link loads in
that tab. Otherwise, it loads in a new tab.
 Using the Add a New Tab button: Tab aficionados can add a New Tab
button to any of the Firefox toolbars via the Customize Toolbar window.
See Chapter 18 for help with toolbar customization.
Bookmarklets: The Baby Extensions
Firefox is designed to be simple but extensible. If you want a feature that isn’t
included, odds are you can install it in under five minutes. Usually, you would
do this by installing an extension and restarting Firefox, as I outline in
Chapter 20. However, some smaller features are available as bookmarklets,
which require no installation and no restart. These mini-extensions are so
named because you access them just like you would a bookmark.
Bookmarklets are easy to use but difficult to explain, so the best method is to
dive right in. You can use the following steps to obtain a bookmarklet that
zooms in on a Web site’s images:
1. If your Bookmarks Toolbar isn’t already open, open it by choosing
View➪Toolbars➪Bookmarks Toolbar in the main Firefox window.
The Bookmarks Toolbar is visible by default.
274
Part V: The Part of Tens 

2. Navigate to Jesse Ruderman’s Web site at www.squarefree.com/
bookmarklets.
Jesse is a tester on the Firefox team who has compiled a large assort-
ment of bookmarklets. Jesse’s bookmarklets are divided into categories
based on function.
3. Click the Text and Data Bookmarklets link.
The page that loads contains a list of bookmarklets (in the leftmost
column) and a description of each (in the middle column).
4. Drag the Zoom Images In bookmarklet out of the page and onto your
Bookmarks Toolbar.
5. Click the newly created Zoom Images In button on the Bookmarks
Toolbar.
When you click the button, the images on Jesse’s Web site grow. If you click it
again, they grow even larger. This isn’t a permanent change. When you reload
the page or visit a new page, the images are restored to normal size. Indeed,
one reason bookmarklets are considered mini-extensions is that their effects
are only temporary. This is also why they’re so much easier to install than
extensions: they can’t have any long-term effects, so the risk of using them is
much lower.
If you don’t want to keep this zoom bookmarklet, you can delete it from your
Bookmarks Toolbar just as you would delete a regular bookmark: Right-click
it and choose Delete. Note that bookmarklets can reside in a regular bookmarks
folder instead of on the Bookmarks Toolbar, but they’re easier to access from
the toolbar. Also, if you put a bookmarklet in a folder, Firefox tries to load the
bookmarklet in a tab when you choose the Open in Tabs option (see Chapter 5),
which can lead to some funky (but generally unharmful) results. This is a bug
we developers hope to fix in a future release.
Be sure to explore the rest of Jesse’s bookmarklets. You can test a bookmarklet
before deciding to drag it to your Bookmarks Toolbar just by clicking it, and
reloading the page always undoes its effects. Some of the bookmarklets are
fairly technical in nature, but none are permanent — so feel free to experiment!

The Internet holds billions of Web sites, and most browsers ask you to
choose one to set as your home page. That doesn’t seem fair. Firefox lets you
275
Chapter 21: Ten Secrets to a Foxier Web

have as many home pages as you want, and each one appears in its own tab
whenever you start a new Firefox window.
You can specify multiple home pages in a few different ways. Here’s the easi-
est way:
1. Load the Web pages you want to use as your home pages into one
window, each in its own tab.
2. Choose Tools➪Options.
3. Click the General icon at the top of the Options window.
4. Under the Home Page boxed group, click the Use Current Pages button.
Alternatively, you can tell Firefox to set all the Web sites in one of your
bookmark folders as the home pages by clicking the Use Bookmark
button, selecting a folder, and clicking OK. This action will set as home
pages only the bookmarks that already exist in that folder. In other
words, any bookmarks you add to the folder in the future won’t be home
pages unless you return to this window and select the folder again.
Although Firefox offers a number of ways to choose Web sites as your
home pages, the end result is always the same: Firefox includes a list of
the site addresses in the Location(s) text box, separated by a | (shift+
Backslash on most keyboards). (Firefox can’t use more common separa-
tors like commas or spaces because those can be part of a site address.)
Knowing this technical detail is quite useful because it allows you to remove
a Web site from your home pages list by simply deleting its address from
the text box and leaving the others intact. For example, if your home pages
are Addicting Games, Kitten War, and The Onion, Firefox displays www.
addictinggames.com|www.kittenwar.com|www.theonion.com in your
Location(s) text box. To remove Kitten War as a home page, simply
delete it, leaving www.addictinggames.com|www.theonion.com.
5. Click OK to save your changes.
Name That Bookmark!
Bookmarks are supposed to save you time, but when you accumulate too
many, they might actually slow you down. No worries: You can skip all that
pointing and clicking, and instead just assign keywords to your bookmarks.
For example, you could give the bookmark to your sister’s blog (Web log) the
keyword sis. To go to her page later, simply enter sis into the Location Bar.
Assigning a keyword to a bookmark is easy:
276
Part V: The Part of Tens 

1. Right-click the bookmark and choose Properties.
The Properties window appears.
2. Enter the keyword you want to use into the Keyword text box.
Because you’ll be typing this word to access the bookmark, shorter words
are better. Keywords are not case sensitive, so sis is the same as SIS.
3. Click OK to save your changes.
4. To test the new keyword, enter it into the Location Bar and press
Enter.
Enjoying a Speedier Search
In the preceding section, you assign a keyword to a bookmark to return to it
quickly. That’s a great timesaver if the bookmarked page is your final destina-
tion, but what if it’s just one stop on your route? For example, suppose you
need fast access to Google News (news.google.com), Google’s online news
aggregator. You could bookmark the site and give it the keyword mw. But
every time the front page loads, you still have to type in a word and wait for
the definition to load.
Firefox lets you bypass this middle step by sending a word or phrase directly
to a page from the Location Bar. For example, in the case of Google News, if
news is your keyword for that site, you could type news Super Bowl into the
Location Bar to go straight to a page of recent stories about the Super Bowl.
In this case, news is a search keyword rather than a bookmark keyword.
Naturally, search keywords work only with Web sites that accept search
phrases, such as Google, Amazon, and so forth.
To set up this feature, you must tell Firefox what kind of search to conduct
when you enter the search keyword and search phrase:
1. Navigate to the search Web site.
2. Right-click the search box you would normally use to search.
For example, at Google News, you would right-click the search field at
the top.
3. Choose Add a Keyword for this Search from the menu that appears.
The Add Bookmark window appears.
4. Enter a name for the bookmark.
This name will appear in the Bookmarks menu.
277
Chapter 21: Ten Secrets to a Foxier Web

Assigning a search keyword is a little bit different than assigning a book-
mark keyword. Whereas you can access a regular bookmark by using
either the Bookmarks menu or its keyword, search bookmarks require a
search phrase and thus can be accessed only by using their keywords
(for example, news Super Bowl). They still show up in the Bookmarks
menu and have a name, but you shouldn’t access them this way. If that’s
confusing, the takeaway is this: Don’t worry about the Name field here.
The keyword is all that matters.
5. Enter the keyword you want to use.
This is the word you will type into the Location Bar before the search
phrase. In my Google News example, I use news.
6. Click OK.
7. To test your new search keyword, type it into the Location Bar fol-
lowed by a search phrase and then press Enter.
Firefox includes a set of search keywords by default, and I list them in 
Table 21-2.

Feng Shui for Your Toolbars
Chapter 18 shows you how to go to town with your Firefox toolbars. Most
people use this powerful capability to create new toolbars and load them
278
Part V: The Part of Tens 

up with buttons, but there’s a certain Zen-like satisfaction to be had by 
compacting your toolbars to the bare essentials and reducing the amount
of clutter that’s in your face while browsing. Not to mention that you’re also
freeing up more space for Web sites.
Figure 21-1 shows my favorite layout. Unfortunately, this layout is possible
only on Windows, because you can’t customize the menu bar on the
Macintosh. However, Mac users should head over to Chapter 18 to read
about what else is possible with toolbar customization.
Below, I explain how I achieved my layout on Windows, and then I answer
some of the questions you’re probably asking (like, “how does he reload a
page?”). The following directions assume that you’re beginning from the
default Firefox layout:
1. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Customize.
The Customize Toolbar window appears, and the toolbars all go into
customize mode (meaning elements such as Spaces become visible, as I
discuss in Chapter 18).
2. Drag the Back and Forward buttons from the Navigation Toolbar (the
middle toolbar) to the menu bar (the top toolbar) and drop them to
the left of the main menus (File, Edit, and so on).
You can drag only one button at a time.
3. Drag a Separator from the Customize Toolbar window to the spot
between the Forward button and the File menu.
4. Drag another Separator from the Customize Toolbar window to the
spot after the Help menu.
5. Drag the Location Bar from the Navigation Toolbar to the menu bar
and drop it to the right of the Separator you just added.
6. Drag one more Separator from the Customize Toolbar window to the
menu bar and drop it after the Location Bar.
7. Drag the Search Box from the Navigation Toolbar to the menu bar and
drop it after the Separator you just added.
8. Click Done to exit the Customize Toolbar window and get out of cus-
tomize mode.
9. From the View➪Toolbars menu, hide the Navigation Toolbar.
But the big question is, how do you access features such as Stop and Reload
if those buttons are gone? The key is, well, the keyboard: Do you really need
Stop and Reload buttons when the Escape and Ctrl+R (Ô+R on a Mac) 
279
Chapter 21: Ten Secrets to a Foxier Web

keyboard shortcuts accomplish the same tasks, respectively? Do you need
the Home button when you could press Alt+Home (Option+Home on a Mac)?
Do you need the Go button when you could just press Enter/Return after
typing an address?
If you’re really keyboard-savvy, you don’t even need the Location Bar. The
Ctrl+L shortcut (Ô+L on a Mac) focuses and selects the Location Bar.
However, if the bar isn’t on one of your toolbars, Firefox opens it in a
tiny window temporarily. You can remove the Location Bar from the
toolbar, drag the Bookmarks Toolbar Items into its place, hide the now-
empty Bookmarks Toolbar, and achieve the slim form factor shown in
Figure 21-2.

The Scroll Wheel: Not Just for Scrolling
To accommodate the surge in scrolling in an Internet world, most mice now
include a scroll wheel (or something similar) so you don’t have to use the
scroll bar. You can use this wheel in Firefox to scroll pages, but it also does so
much more:
The mouse pointer must be over the Web site for each of the tricks below 
to work.
 Going back and forth: To navigate backward and forward through
recent browsing history, hold Shift while scrolling the wheel down (to go
back) or up (to go forward). Each tick of the wheel takes you backward
or forward one page.
 Enlarging or shrinking text: To enlarge or shrink text on a page, hold
Ctrl (or Ô on a Mac) while scrolling the wheel down (to enlarge) or up

281

(to shrink). Each tick of the wheel enlarges or shrinks the size of the text
by about 20 percent.
This change will affect future Web sites you visit in the same tab or
window. To reset the text size to normal, go to View➪Text Size➪Normal,
press Ctrl+0 (or Ô+0 on a Mac), or just browse in a different tab or
window.
 Scrolling one line at a time: By default, Firefox respects your system
settings and usually scrolls about four lines at a time. If you want to
focus on a document line by line, you can hold down Alt (or Option 
on a Mac) while scrolling the wheel.
 Scrolling pages more smoothly with Smooth Scrolling: By default,
Firefox scrolls a page in notches — that is, it bumps the page up or
down a certain amount each time you scroll. Some people might find
this behavior jerky when reading a document line by line. You can turn
on smooth scrolling in the Advanced category of the Options window, as
I describe in Chapter 16, to have Firefox slide pages up or down more
smoothly each time you scroll. If you previously browsed in Internet
Explorer, you might feel more comfortable with smooth scrolling
because Internet Explorer uses it.
 Scrolling up and down a page quickly with autoscrolling: If your scroll
wheel doubles as a button, you can use it to scroll a page quickly and
even automatically. Move the mouse pointer to a dead part of the page
(somewhere that isn’t a link) and hold down the wheel button. An icon
overlays the spot you clicked. Now, still pressing the wheel button,
move your mouse up and down to scroll the page much faster than usu-
ally. Alternatively, you can release the wheel button as soon as you see
the icon, move the mouse up or down, and leave it there. Firefox scrolls
the page automatically. If you don’t like autoscrolling and find yourself
activating it frequently, you can disable it in the Advanced category of
the Options window, as I describe in Chapter 16.
Some mice don’t support this feature even if they have a scroll wheel
that acts as a button.

The Ten Best Firefox Extensions
In This Chapter
 Keeping your place across browsing sessions
 Discovering new and interesting content online
 Surfing more quickly and pleasurably
 Customizing Web sites
 Managing bookmarks more efficiently
 Keeping an eye on downloads without leaving the browser
 Archiving and scrapbooking the Web
 Generating nicknames for long addresses
F
irefox is completely extensible, which means you can literally build your
dream browser by installing any of over 700 extensions (and counting!).
Installation is a piece of cake, and you can find instructions in Chapter 20.
After you install an extension, you can access the features it offers through
the main Firefox interface as if they’d always been there.
This chapter outlines la crème de la crème of the Firefox extensions. Because
developers can update their extensions at any time, specific directions would
soon be obsolete, so in this chapter I try to provide a general overview. Most
extensions are very simple to use and offer their own help systems. Have fun!
Before Getting Started
Extensions are created by the extended community, not by the Firefox team
itself. I don’t tell you this to frighten you; the extensions available on the offi-
cial Firefox Web site are used by plenty of people every day. My point is that
the Firefox developers don’t decide when to upgrade or stop distributing a
given extension. This means that by the time you read this, some of the
extensions I discuss here might have changed drastically, and others might
not even be available anymore. I hope that isn’t the case and will do my best
to prevent that, but it’s a possibility.

I have three other notes before you get started:
 Check out Chapter 20 to familiarize yourself with the Firefox extension
system before proceeding. That chapter explains where to find the
extensions I discuss here, as well as how to install them. Remember that
you need to restart Firefox after installing an extension!
 You can configure many extensions from the Options windows that you
access through the Options button in the Extension Manager (Tools➪
Extensions), as I describe in Chapter 20. Some extensions also put short-
cuts to their options on the Tools menu.
 Many extensions quietly add buttons to the Customize Toolbar window.
You can drag these buttons to your Firefox toolbars, as I explain in
Chapter 18, to access the extension’s features quickly.
Gaining Peace of Mind with SessionSaver
Extension: SessionSaver
Categories: Navigation, Tabbed Browsing
Wash the dog, feed the kids, wash the kids, feed the kids to the dog — think
about all the stuff you keep track of every day. Wouldn’t it be great if you
could just download your brain to a disk, enjoy some worry-free downtime,
and reload it later?
Technology still has a little ways to go, but the SessionSaver extension is the
next best thing. As the name implies, SessionSaver remembers the state of
Firefox from one browsing session to the next. For instance, if you open
seven Web sites and then carelessly close Firefox, you see the same seven
sites the next time you open it. The Web sites reopen in whatever form they
were in when you closed Firefox. In other words, Web sites that were open in
windows will reopen in windows, and Web sites that were open in tabs will
reopen in tabs. SessionSaver even remembers information you’ve typed into
Web forms but haven’t yet saved or submitted. And the best part? You don’t
have to do anything to make this work.
SessionSaver restores exactly what you had open in your previous session,
so unless your home page was open last time, it won’t load the next time you
start Firefox.
Thanks to SessionSaver, you no longer have to lose your open Web sites
when your laptop battery dies or your spouse wants to go online. It also
saves you from creating temporary bookmarks just to hold onto them. And
even in the (rare!) case that Firefox crashes, SessionSaver protects your data.
284
Part V: The Part of Tens 

How it works: SessionSaver automatically begins remembering your informa-
tion across browser sessions as soon as you install it. You can configure
SessionSaver by choosing Tools➪SessionSaver➪Settings to open its settings
window. By default, the window displays in Simple Mode and contains a
single setting to turn SessionSaver on and off. However, if you click the
Simple toggle in the upper-right corner, the window changes to Expert Mode
and makes a number of additional options available, as shown in Figure 22-1.
For example, you can have SessionSaver ask you before it restores your last
session by selecting the But Ask Me First check box.
StumbleUpon the Web’s Best Secrets
Extension: StumbleUpon
Categories: Navigation, Search Tools
The Internet holds over 10 billion pages, and quite frankly, many of them are
boring. StumbleUpon is designed to separate the flowers from the weeds by
helping you “stumble upon” Web sites that friends and people who share your
interests recommend. Although StumbleUpon uses complicated algorithms to

decide which Web sites will interest you, finding new and interesting content
is as easy as clicking a button. Of course, you should also add good sites you
find to the mix so others can have the pleasure of stumbling upon them. This,
too, is as easy as clicking.
How it works: StumbleUpon adds its own toolbar (see Figure 22-2) under the
Bookmarks Toolbar. After installation, click the Welcome to StumbleUpon
button on the toolbar to create your account and indicate what kinds of sites
you want to stumble upon. Then you’re ready to go with the toolbar as your
guide. To find a new site, just click Stumble. The results get more interesting
when friends join your network; you can invite them by clicking the friend
button to load the StumbleUpon invite form and filling out your friends’
e-mail addresses, along with a short message. Recommend sites you visit
with the I Like It! button or warn others with Not for Me. You can also see
what others thought by clicking the Page Reviews button (the one with the
speech bubble).

Kissing Ads Goodbye with AdBlock
Extensions: AdBlock, AdBlock Filterset.G Updater
Category: Miscellaneous
Firefox blocks pop-up ads for you right out of the box. But as you’re painfully
aware, many other forms of online advertising are equally annoying. Enter
AdBlock, an extension that can block anything you encounter with a click of
the mouse.
Of course, blocking one ad a time could take you awhile. Even a single Web
site might cycle through a network of tens of thousands of ads. But unless
you block one ad at a time, how does AdBlock tell an ad from a legitimate
image? AdBlock lets you block ads using filters that recognize content that
comes from the same network as an ad you previously blocked. Rather than
blocking one ad a time, AdBlock blocks advertising networks. Because most
of the Internet’s ads are served up by a small conglomerate of advertising
networks, most ads disappear as soon as you’ve built up a small set of filters.
Now for the good news: Expert users have already scoured the Web for
months and constructed a filter list that takes care of most ads you encounter.
I recommend the AdBlock Filterset.G Updater extension, which automatically
configures AdBlock to use such a list and keeps the list up-to-date as new ad
networks are created.
How it works: After installing the AdBlock extension, install the AdBlock
Filterset.G Updater extension and restart Firefox. You might see two scary-
looking notices as soon as you restart. These are harmless; select the check
box and click Close in each notice. Now you’re ready to start surfing the ad-
free Web! Because the purpose here is to reduce distraction caused by ads,
AdBlock doesn’t replace blocked ads with placeholder images or anything
else; it just leaves the space empty. And don’t worry about new advertise-
ments: Your ad filter list is automatically updated each week.
AdBlock does the best it can to recognize and block advertisements, but
some slip through anyway. Whenever you see an ad and sigh, just remember
how things were before AdBlock!
A New Way to Surf with Mouse Gestures
Extension: Mouse Gestures
Categories: Message Reading, Navigation
287
Chapter 22: The Ten Best Firefox Extensions

I started this book by saying I want Firefox to make the Web fun again. That’s
a pretty hard thing to do when you consider that the basics of Web browsing
haven’t changed in the past decade. You click Back to go back. You click
Forward to go forward. How can anyone improve on that?
Well, the other theme I harp on is making tasks simpler. And if you think
about it, a step could be eliminated: moving the mouse all the way to the tool-
bar to click those buttons. (Hey, developers are lazy.) Sure, you could use the
keyboard to go back and forward, but odds are that your hand is already on
the mouse to scroll.
The answer to your troubles — which, until a minute ago, you didn’t know
you had — is the Mouse Gestures extension. As its name suggests, a mouse
gesture is a way to execute commands by moving the mouse in certain ways.
In a gesture world, you don’t move the mouse pointer to the toolbar to click a
button. You press and hold the right mouse button (to indicate that you’re
performing a gesture), jerk the mouse left a couple inches, and then release
the button. To go forward, do the same thing but jerk the mouse to the right.
Gestures work as long as the mouse pointer is over the Web site.
The backward and forward gestures are intuitive because you simply gesture
to the left or right (respectively), but other commands — such as Close Page —
are harder to model and have more arbitrary gestures. I list some of the more
common ones in Table 22-1. After you get the hang of simple mouse gestures
like these, there are plenty more to master, and you can discover more online
at this address:
http://optimoz.mozdev.org/gestures/defaultmappings.html
You can even create your own gestures. First, open the Extension Manager
(Tools➪Extensions), select the Mouse Gestures extension in the list, and click
the Options button at the bottom to open the Mouse Gestures options
window. In this window, click the Edit Mappings button at the bottom of the
General tab to open the Edit Gesture Mappings window (where gestures are
mapped to the Firefox commands they perform). Next, click the New button
to open the New Gesture Mappings window. Now, to define your gesture, you
need to specify two things: the gesture itself, and the Firefox command it per-
forms (e.g. minimize window). The easiest way to specify the gesture is to
click the Recognize button next to Gesture Code and perform the desired ges-
ture (using the right mouse button, as with all gestures) in the white screen
that appears. Then choose the Firefox command to perform from the
Functions list at the bottom of the window. When finished, click OK, and then
click OK again to close the Edit Gesture Mappings window and the original
options window. Your new gesture is ready to go!
You can share your gesture with the world at the Gesture Exchange (http://
optimoz.mozdev.org/gestures/redirect/gesture-exchange/). You
can also see what your fellow gesturers have come up with — and even install
288
Part V: The Part of Tens 

their gestures! When you find an intriguing gesture, simply click the link to it,
and then click OK when the Import Gesture Mapping window appears. You
can start using the new gesture immediately; no restart is required.

How it works: After installing the Mouse Gestures extension, you’re ready to
go. Navigate to a few Web sites so you have some browsing history and then
try the Go Back gesture. A note appears in the Status Bar as soon as the ges-
ture is recognized. You can configure mouse gestures from the extension’s
options window, which you access by selecting Mouse Gestures in the
Extension Manager list (see Chapter 20) and clicking the Options button at
the bottom. To create or change gestures, click the Edit Mappings button at
the bottom of the options window, and note the key in the bottom left so you
can follow the chart. You can also turn on a neat feature called mouse trails
on the Visual Settings tab to have a line drawn on-screen each time you ges-
ture. This feature is handy when you’re getting acquainted with gestures
because you can see exactly what the extension “sees” and discover how to
perform the gestures it doesn’t recognize more precisely. In Figure 22-3, I’m
performing a Go Back gesture. (I didn’t draw a very straight line, but the
Mouse Gestures extension recognized it anyway.) Just be sure to read the
note about this feature on the Visual Settings tab.

Playing Music without Leaving Firefox
Extension: FoxyTunes
Categories: Entertainment, Miscellaneous
Do you spend so much time using your Web browser these days that switch-
ing applications seems like a major distraction? Thankfully, some developers
are creating extensions that bring the applications to you. One of my favorites
is FoxyTunes, which integrates your favorite music player into Firefox by adding
a slim toolbar that stays out of the way. The toolbar offers direct access to
everything you need: Play, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward, and Previous/Next
song, which navigate through your current playlist. FoxyTunes works with all
the popular music players, including WinAmp, iTunes, Windows Media Player,
and RealPlayer. (See http://foxytunes.org/firefox/features.
html#supportedplayers for a complete list of supported players.)
How it works: After installing FoxyTunes, you see a small toolbar in the
bottom-right corner containing a few different sets of buttons (see Figure 22-4).
You can hover over a button to see its purpose, so I mention only the impor-
tant ones here. You can also see a handful of tiny black arrows. Click these
arrows to expand the toolbar and see additional controls or information. For
example, the first black arrow slides out a tray displaying the name of the
current song.
Figure 22-3:

Part V: The Part of Tens 

The first button opens the FoxyTunes menu. Click it, choose Player➪Select,
and then choose your music player. The next set of buttons offers access to
familiar commands like Previous/Next Track and Play and should be self-
explanatory. Note that Previous/Next Track navigate through the playlist in
your player if one exists.
Some players, such as iTunes, must be open to be controlled by FoxyTunes.
The extension will automatically launch a player when necessary (such as
when you click Play). If you don’t want the player to clutter up your screen,
you can tell FoxyTunes to hide (but not close) it with the Hide Player button.
If you don’t like the FoxyTunes bar in the bottom-right corner of the screen,
you can move it. Simply move the mouse pointer to the first black arrow on
the toolbar and when it turns into a pointing hand, begin dragging the toolbar
to the desired location on any of Firefox’s toolbars.

The Web Your Way with Greasemonkey
Extension: Greasemonkey
Categories: Developer Tools, Web Annoyances, Website Integration
Since the birth of the Web, Internet surfing has been a very passive activity.
You decide where to go, but when you get there, the site owner controls the
experience. Greasemonkey allows you to customize Web sites to your liking.
Think of it as your interior decorator for the Web: You can get inside other
people’s pages and move, redesign, or remove what’s on them. You can even
add to them. For example, some Greasemonkey users customize Google to
show image previews of each search result, which helps you decide whether
a result is any good before you waste time clicking through to it. Of course,
none of your changes affect other visitors to the page.
Greasemonkey is the tool that makes this possible. Before you can start surf-
ing the Web your way, you need to tell Greasemonkey what “your way” is.
This is expressed in a set of programming instructions known as a user script.
When a Web site finishes loading, Greasemonkey executes these instructions
to customize it. However, you don’t need to be a programmer to use
Greasemonkey. Thousands of advanced users have already created user
scripts that you can install with one click.
As with extensions in general, the Mozilla Foundation cannot guarantee the
safety or function of user scripts.
Greasemonkey supports two kinds of user scripts:
 Generic scripts can affect any Web site you visit. For example, the Linkifier
script changes text addresses (such as http://www.google.com or
john@smith.com) on any page into actual links that you can click.
 Site-specific scripts are specifically designed for certain Web sites. For
example, the Yahoo! Mail Keyboard Shortcuts script adds keyboard
shortcuts to the Yahoo! mail interface so you can navigate it more
quickly. This script is specially designed for Yahoo! and won’t work else-
where. Site-specific scripts are more fragile than generic scripts because
they could stop working if the target Web site changes significantly.
Greasemonkey is one of the most complicated Firefox extensions available,
but it’s also one of the most powerful. Enjoy your Web!
How it works: After installing Greasemonkey, make your way to the user
scripts collections:
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Generic scripts:
http://dunck.us/collab/GreaseMonkeyUserScriptsGeneric
Site scripts:
http://dunck.us/collab/GreaseMonkeyUserScriptsSpecific
When you find a script you like, right-click the link to it (left-clicking shows
you the script itself) and choose Install User Script. Greasemonkey asks you
whether to exclude certain Web sites from the effects of the script, as shown
in Figure 22-5. By default, generic and site-specific scripts behave as I explain
earlier in this section. When the Install User Script window appears, click OK
to continue with installation. And that’s basically all there is to it. When you
visit an applicable Web site, the script should automatically kick in after the
page is done loading.
You can turn Greasemonkey on and off by clicking the little monkey head in
the bottom-right corner of the main Firefox window. You’ll also notice some
new Greasemonkey options on the Tools menu, but these are mostly techni-
cal features you can ignore.
I recommend the scripts in Table 22-2 to first-time Greasemonkey users who
want to get their feet wet.

Managing Bookmarks More Efficiently
Extension: Flat Bookmark Editing
Category: Bookmarks
Firefox includes a powerful Bookmarks Manager for organizing your book-
mark collection, but it has a quirk that might aggravate frequent filers: You
have to edit a bookmark’s properties through a separate window. Whenever
you want to rename a bookmark, for example, you must right-click the book-
mark, choose Properties, and work inside the Properties window.
The Flat Bookmark Editing extension streamlines this process by flattening the
Properties window into the Bookmarks Manager, as illustrated in Figure 22-7.
As you can see, the OK and Cancel buttons are gone. That’s because changes
to properties take effect as soon as you make them, with no need to save
explicitly. The Flat Bookmark Editing extension saves you just a few seconds
per bookmark, but over time that adds up to a big win.
How it works: After you install Flat Bookmark Editing, you see the property
fields in a panel at the bottom of the Bookmarks Manager. You’re ready to go!

Keeping an Eye on Your Downloads
Extension: Download Statusbar
Category: Download Tools
Most browsers open one progress window per download, which can be pretty
overwhelming if you’re downloading multiple files. What’s worse, closing a
window cancels the download. Firefox improves the situation by integrating
all download progress into a single Download Manager and will continue
downloading even if you close the manager. But what if you could keep an
eye on your downloads without needing a window at all?
The Download Statusbar extension adds an unobtrusive bar to the bottom of
the Firefox window, as shown in Figure 22-8. This bar tracks the progress of
all ongoing downloads. Each download is represented by a white button that
is filled with color as the download progresses. You can pause, cancel, or
launch downloads right from the download status bar.

296
Part V: The Part of Tens 

How it works: After installing the Download Statusbar extension and restart-
ing Firefox, you see a window with usage tips from the extension’s creator,
but the actual status bar doesn’t appear until you start a download. While a
download is in progress, the status bar displays three pieces of information:
the progress, as indicated by the amount of color; the approximate time left,
in the bottom-right corner; and the approximate download rate, in the top-
right corner. The meaning of the download rate is unimportant, but higher is
better. Left-click a download to pause it, and left-click again to resume. When
a download finishes, double-click to launch it or single-click with the middle
mouse button to remove it from the status bar. (If your mouse doesn’t have a
middle mouse button, right-click the download and choose Remove from the
contextual menu.)
You can configure the download status bar in all sorts of ways from its
options window. To access the window, choose Tools➪Extensions to open
the Extension Manager, select the Download Statusbar extension in the list,
and then click the Options button at the bottom. (See Chapter 20 for more on
the Extension Manager.)

Making the World’s Largest Scrapbook
Extensions: Scrapbook
Categories: Download Tools
For all the benefits of the Web, paper documents have traditionally retained
an edge. They don’t magically disappear when your Internet connection does.
And unlike Web sites, you can mark them, highlight them, and otherwise anno-
tate them in any fashion you please. However, the Scrapbook extension — an
innovative tool for archiving and annotating Web sites — puts the Web firmly
in the lead.
A scrapbooked Web site is more than just a link. It is a complete copy of the
page stored on your computer. So unlike a bookmark, you can still return to a
scrapbooked page even if the original page is removed from the Internet or if
your Internet connection is down. (The trade-off, of course, is that when the
original page is updated, your copy is not.) And because Scrapbook has access
to the full text of each page, searching for a scrapbooked page is much easier
than searching for a bookmark; you aren’t limited to searching titles.
297
Chapter 22: The Ten Best Firefox Extensions

Scrapbook also lets you capture copies of each Web site linked from a given
page. Do you need some reading material for a long plane ride? Just go to
CNN and capture the front page, links and all, for your Scrapbook. Now you
have offline access to every article, including pictures, during the flight.
Sometimes, however, a Web page is more than you need — and this is where
Scrapbook really shines. You can capture just a small portion of a page 
and Scrapbook remembers all the original formatting. Just as a real scrap-
book is composed of ticket stubs and receipts, your online scrapbook can
contain mere scraps of pages.
To top it off, Scrapbook offers powerful tools to annotate the items you
archive. And because Scrapbook items are snapshots of their Web counter-
parts, you can actually edit them directly as if they were documents you cre-
ated. Insert notes, highlight key sections, even remove elements you don’t
need — Scrapbook lets you do it all. No wonder The New York Times raved
about it.
How it works: After you install Scrapbook, you’re ready to begin scrapbook-
ing. To capture a page, right-click it and choose Capture Page. This captures
the entire page, including images, without presenting any options. Use the
Capture Page As command for additional options, such as a destination
folder for the captured page and the ability to capture linked pages.
To capture part of a page, select the part, right-click, and choose Capture
Selection (or choose Capture Selection As if you need extended options).
You can view the Scrapbook Sidebar by choosing Tools➪ScrapBook. Select
an item in the sidebar to load it in the current tab or window. When an item 
is loaded, click the blue EDIT button in the bottom-right corner to open the
editing toolbar, shown at the bottom of Figure 22-9. Use the buttons on the
right to highlight, remove, or annotate text after selecting it on the page. You
can hover over each button to see a description of its purpose. When you’re
done, click the disk button to save your edits.
When you install the Scrapbook extension, it adds a button to the Customize
Toolbar window that opens and closes the Scrapbook Sidebar. As I describe
in Chapter 18, you can drag this button to any of your Firefox toolbars for fast
access to the sidebar.
To search items in your Scrapbook, enter a word or phrase into the text box
at the top and press Enter. The Scrapbook Sidebar offers dozens of additional
features you can experiment with as you grow more familiar with it.

Honey, I Shrunk the Link!
Extension: TinyUrl Creator
Categories: Miscellaneous, Navigation, Web Annoyances
Internet addresses are a pain. Apart from being complicated and hard to
remember, they’re often very long. For example, most MapQuest addresses,
which are generated automatically, look like this:
http://www.mapquest.com/directions/main.adp?do=rev&mo=ma&2

Long addresses aren’t just an eyesore; they’re difficult to share with others.
When you send an address like the previous example by e-mail or instant
message, it often gets broken down into multiple lines. When your friend
receives it, only the first line is linked, and because that isn’t the full address,
the link fails. He has to copy and paste the address into his browser — line,
by line, by line. And when the link is for directions to your house and he’s
already 10 minutes late, that’s a real problem.
The TinyUrl Creator extension for Firefox offers a brilliant solution. It allows
you to automatically generate a very short address (such as http://tinyurl.
com/8f46) that redirects to the original page. Think of it like a nickname or a
shortcut; it’s another way to get to the same place. Because this address is
very short, it’s easy to share with others. (URL is a technical term for an
address, in case you’re wondering.)
How it works: After installing TinyUrl Creator, you can generate a short
address by visiting the offending page and choosing Tools➪TinyUrl Creator➪
From Current URL. The short address is automatically copied to your Clipboard
(and it overwrites whatever’s already there!) so it’s easy to share with others
by pasting it into an e-mail or instant message. The extension shows a notifi-
cation window each time you create a short address, as shown in Figure
22-10, but you can turn this off in the extension’s Options window
(Tools➪TinyUrl Creator➪Options).
Additional help is available at the TinyUrl Creator user support forum
(http://forums.mozmonkey.com/index.php). You can find additional
information about how the TinyURL service works at www.tinyurl.com.
Note that the TinyUrl Creator extension is not produced by the makers of the
TinyURL.com service.

Firefox Menu Reference
In This Appendix
 Walking through the Firefox menu system
T
rying a new program with dozens of new commands can be as over-
whelming as meeting the in-laws. This appendix walks you through the
commands offered by the Firefox menu bar. I also list the command’s key-
board shortcut under it (if it has one) and identify any scenarios that might
cause a command to be unavailable. If you want more information on a par-
ticular command or menu, I point you to the chapter where I discuss it.
The File Menu
The File menu (shown in Figure A-1) mostly contains commands that operate
on the currently displayed Web site, along with a few general Firefox com-
mands (such as Import, for importing personal information from your previ-
ous browser, and Exit, for closing all Firefox windows).
Figure A-1:
The File
menu.

New Window
Opens a new Firefox window.
Shortcut: Ctrl+N (Ô+N on a Mac)
New Tab
Opens a new Firefox tab.
Shortcut: Ctrl+T (Ô+T on a Mac)
See Chapter 7 for more information about tabbed browsing.
Open Location
If the Location Bar is on your toolbar, choosing this menu item selects it. If
you remove the Location Bar by using toolbar customization, which I discuss
in Chapter 18, this command opens the window shown in Figure A-2. Type the
address of the page you want to load into the text box, or if you want to open
a file that’s on your computer, click the Choose File button and select the file
in the window that appears. By default, Firefox opens the Web page or file in
the current window. To open it in a new tab or window instead, choose the
appropriate option from the dropdown list next to Open In. Finally, click the
Open button to open the Web page or file.

302
Firefox For Dummies 

Shortcut: Ctrl+L (Ô+L on a Mac)
Open File
Allows you to display a file on your hard drive within Firefox. Only Web sites,
text files, and images can be opened.
Shortcut: Ctrl+O (Ô+O on a Mac)
Close
Closes the current Firefox window. Firefox shows this command only if you
have no tabs open in the current window. Otherwise, it displays Close
Window and Close Tab commands.
Shortcut: Ctrl+W (Ô+W on a Mac)
Close Window
Closes the current Firefox window. Firefox shows this command in addition
to the Close Tab command if you have multiple tabs open in the current
window. If you don’t, the Close command is shown. This is different from the
Exit command, which closes all Firefox windows (and any tabs they contain).
Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+W (Ô+Shift+W on a Mac)
See Chapter 7 for more information about tabbed browsing.
Close Tab
Closes the current tab. Firefox shows this command in addition to the Close
Window command if you have multiple tabs open. If you don’t, the Close
command is shown.
Shortcut: Ctrl+W (Ô+W on a Mac)
See Chapter 7 for more information about tabbed browsing.
303
Appendix A: Firefox Menu Reference

Save Page As
Saves the current Web page to your hard drive so you can view it even if the
site or your Internet connection goes down.
Shortcut: Ctrl+S (Ô+S on a Mac)
See Chapter 11 for more information about saving Web sites.
Save Frame As
Saves the selected frame of the current Web site to your hard drive so you
can view it even if the site or your Internet connection goes down. Firefox
shows this command only if you’re viewing a Web site that is partitioned into
frames, where each frame is itself a page. To save a particular frame, click
some dead space within it (that is, click somewhere other than on a link), and
then choose this command. (Frames are rare on the Web these days.)
See Chapter 11 for more information about saving Web sites.
Send Link
Opens a new e-mail compose window that contains a link to the current page.
Firefox offers this feature so you can send interesting links to friends and family
easily. Simply address the e-mail, write a brief message, and then click Send.
This feature uses your computer’s default e-mail program. To change the
default e-mail program on Windows, click the Start button and choose Control
Panel from the Start menu. In the Control Panel window, switch to Classic
View and double-click on Internet Options, then click the Programs tab in the
Internet Options window. Finally, select the program you want to set as default
from the drop-down list next to E-Mail, and click OK. To change the default
e-mail program on a Mac, you need to use a setting offered in the e-mail 
program itself, if it offers one.
Page Setup
Opens a window where you can configure the display of printed Web sites on
paper.
See Chapter 12 for more information about printing.
304
Firefox For Dummies 

Print Preview
Displays a preview of how the current Web site will look on paper if you print
it. Use the Page Setup command to configure the print layout.
This command is unavailable on Macintosh.
See Chapter 12 for more information about printing.
Print
Displays a window that allows you to configure printing (for example, choos-
ing a page range) and print the current document.
Shortcut: Ctrl+P (Ô+P on a Mac)
See Chapter 12 for more information about printing.
Import
Opens the Import Wizard, which walks you through the process of importing
personal information (such as bookmarks and saved passwords) from your
old browser.
See Chapter 3 for more information about importing.
Work Offline
Puts Firefox in a special Offline mode. In Offline mode, Firefox never actually
connects to Web sites you visit; instead, it displays an archived version of the
page from the last time you visited it. If you haven’t visited the page before or
if you cleared the Firefox cache (see Chapter 14), Firefox displays an error
message. Offline mode is useful when you won’t have an Internet connection
for an extended period of time and you want Firefox to use its archive instead
of failing to load each page. For example, if you’re preparing to go on a plane,
you could visit a few pages, board the plane, put Firefox in Offline mode, and
navigate among them as if you were still online.
Putting Firefox in Offline mode doesn’t actually turn off your Internet connec-
tion. It affects only the way Firefox displays Web sites.
305
Appendix A: Firefox Menu Reference

If you shut down Firefox in Offline mode, it will be in Offline mode next time you
open it. To return to Online mode, choose the Work Offline command again.
Exit
Closes all open Firefox windows and tabs. Firefox displays a warning if any
downloads are in progress and if any open windows contain multiple tabs. 
The Edit Menu
The Edit menu (shown in Figure A-3) lets you copy and paste text and images
or find text in the current Web page.
Undo
Reverses the last text edit you made in the current window (such as in the
Location Bar or a text box on the page). Note that Undo cannot reopen a tab
after you close it, return a bookmark after you delete it from the Bookmarks
Toolbar, or otherwise undo any action besides text editing.
This command is unavailable (grayed out) when you haven’t made any edits
to undo.
Shortcut: Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on a Mac)
Figure A-3:
The Edit
menu.
306
Firefox For Dummies 

Redo
Reverses the last Undo command. This is the opposite of Undo. If you type
Firefox in the Location Bar and choose Undo, “Firefox” disappears. Choose
Redo to restore it. As with Undo, Redo can only restore text edits.
This command is unavailable (grayed out) when you haven’t undone an action.
Shortcuts: Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z (Ô+Shift+Z on a Mac)
Cut
Copies the current selection into the system Clipboard and deletes it from its
original location. Use the Paste command to put the selection in a new location.
This command is unavailable (grayed out) when nothing is selected or when
you have selected something that can’t be cut out of its original location,
such as text in a Web page.
Shortcut: Ctrl+X or Shift+Delete (Ô+X on a Mac)
Copy
Copies the current selection (which can contain both text and images) onto
the system Clipboard, replacing whatever is currently on the Clipboard. You
can then use the Paste command to put the selection in a new location. The
difference between Copy and Cut is that Cut actually removes the text from a
location, whereas Copy leaves the original and simply makes a copy of it. In
both cases, the text that is cut or copied goes onto the Clipboard, and you
can then paste it elsewhere. Although Cut doesn’t work on text that is on a
Web page, Copy usually does.
This command is unavailable (grayed out) when nothing is selected.
Shortcut: Ctrl+C (Ô+C on a Mac)
Paste
Puts the selection on the system Clipboard into the currently focused text
box. The selection stays on the Clipboard until something else is cut or
307
Appendix A: Firefox Menu Reference

copied to replace it, so you can paste multiple instances of the selection if
you want to.
This command is unavailable when the Clipboard is empty.
Shortcut: Ctrl+V (Ô+V on a Mac)
Delete
Deletes the current selection.
This command is unavailable when nothing is selected or when you have
selected something that can’t be deleted, such as text on a Web page.
Shortcut: Delete
Select All
Selects everything in the currently focused area. For example, if the Location
Bar is focused, the Select All command selects the entire address. If the
Content area is focused, the command selects the current Web site.
Shortcut: Ctrl+A (Ô+A on a Mac)
Find in This Page
Opens the Find Bar at the bottom of the window so you can find text within
the current Web page.
Shortcuts: Ctrl+F or F3 (Ô+F on a Mac)
See Chapter 4 for more information about the Find Bar.
Find Again
If you previously searched a Web page in the current window, this command
opens the Find Bar with the last search phrase and searches for the next
instance. Otherwise, it just opens the Find Bar and waits for you to enter a
phrase.
Shortcuts: Ctrl+G or F3 (Ô+G on a Mac)
308

The View Menu
The View menu (shown in Figure A-4) contains a mixture of commands for
showing or hiding Firefox toolbars and sidebars, as well as changing the
appearance of the current Web page.
Toolbars
The Toolbars submenu allows you to show or hide the toolbars in the main
Firefox window. It also offers access to toolbar customization, which I discuss
further in Chapter 18.

Shows or hides the Navigation Toolbar, which contains commands you need
while browsing (such as Back and Forward).
See Chapter 2 for more information about the Navigation Toolbar.
Bookmarks Toolbar
Shows or hides the Bookmarks Toolbar, where you can store your favorite
bookmarks for fast access.
See Chapters 2 and 5 for more information about the Bookmarks Toolbar.
The list of created toolbars
If you have created additional toolbars, as I describe in Chapter 18, a menu
item for each one will appear here. Click the menu item to show or hide the
toolbar.

309
Appendix A: Firefox Menu Reference

Customize
Opens the Customize Toolbar window, which allows you to add or remove
items to and from your toolbars, change the toolbar display, and even create
new toolbars.
See Chapter 18 for more information about toolbar customization.
Status Bar
Shows or hides the Status Bar at the bottom of the window. The Status Bar
displays information about the current page.
See Chapter 2 for more information about the Status Bar.
Sidebar
The Sidebar submenu allows you to show or hide sidebars, which are vertical
bars that open on the left side of the Firefox window. Firefox includes two
sidebars by default: the Bookmarks Sidebar, which I discuss in Chapter 5, and
the History Sidebar, which I discuss in Chapter 6. You can also set book-
marked Web pages to load in a sidebar, as I discuss in Chapter 5. Finally, cer-
tain extensions install their own sidebars; see Chapter 20 for more on
extensions.
Bookmarks
Shows or hides the Bookmarks Sidebar, which contains your bookmarks list.
Shortcut: Ctrl+B or Ctrl+I (Ô+B on a Mac)
See Chapter 5 for more information about the Bookmarks Sidebar.
History
Shows or hides the History Sidebar, which contains a list of sites you’ve vis-
ited recently. This command is the same as choosing Go➪History.
Shortcut: Ctrl+H (Ô+Shift+H on a Mac)
See Chapter 6 for more information about the History Sidebar.

The list of installed sidebars
If any extensions have installed new sidebars, a menu item for each appears
here. For example, the Scrapbook extension I discuss in Chapter 22 installs
its own sidebar. Click the menu item to show or hide the sidebar.
See Chapter 20 for more information about extensions.
Stop
Forces the current Web site to stop loading even though it hasn’t finished.
Only the part of the page that has finished loading will be available. This is
the same as clicking the Stop button on the Navigation Toolbar.
This command is unavailable if the current Web site is already loaded.
Shortcut: Escape
Reload
Fetches the newest version of the current Web site. For example, you might
want to leave the CNN Web site open and reload it occasionally to see the
latest headlines. This is the same as clicking the Reload button on the
Navigation Toolbar.
Shortcut: F5 or Ctrl+R (Ô+R on a Mac)
Text Size
The Text Size menu allows you to enlarge or shrink the text of Web pages you
view in the current tab or window. See Chapter 19 for more information about
changing text size.
Increase
Enlarges the text on the current page and all future pages visited in the cur-
rent tab or window. Use this command repeatedly to enlarge the text further.
Shortcut: Ctrl++ (Ô++ on a Mac); in other words, press Ctrl (or Ô on a Mac)
and the plus sign
311
Appendix A: Firefox Menu Reference

Decrease
Shrinks the text on the current page and all future pages you visit in the cur-
rent tab or window. Use this command repeatedly to shrink the text further.
Shortcut: Ctrl+- (Ô+- on a Mac); in other words, press Ctrl (or Ô on a Mac)
and the minus sign
Normal
Returns the text size of pages you view in the current tab or window to
normal, regardless of how much you increased or decreased it previously.
Shortcut: Ctrl+0 (Ô+0 on a Mac)
Page Style
From time to time, a Web site provides multiple themes that change the
appearance of the page. This menu offers access to these different themes,
and is intended for advanced users only.
No Style
Removes specialized fonts, colors, and other visual effects from the current
page and all future pages visited in the current tab or window.
Basic Page Style
Displays the current page the way its author intended. This is the default,
and the current page can change the name of this command if it wants.
The list of additional styles
If a Web site provides additional styles, a menu item for each appears here
with the name specified by the page author. Click the menu item to choose
the style.
Character Encoding
Allows you to manually specify the language of the Web site you’re viewing.
In most cases, Firefox can automatically detect the language and display text
appropriately. However, if text isn’t showing up properly, choose the lan-
guage from this menu.
312
Firefox For Dummies 

Page Source
Displays the code that created the current Web site. This command is useful
only for Web site developers.
Shortcut: Ctrl+U (Ô+U on a Mac)
Full Screen
Hides Firefox toolbars and the system taskbar so you have more room to
view the current Web site. Because the menu bar is hidden in Full Screen
mode, you can’t use this menu item to exit Full Screen mode. Instead, press
F11 or click the Restore button (the button in the upper right corner to the
left of the Close button).
This command is unavailable on the Mac.
Shortcut: F11
See Chapter 19 for more information about Full Screen mode.
The Go Menu
The Go menu (shown in Figure A-5) allows you to return to Web sites you vis-
ited recently.
Figure A-5:
The Go
menu.
313
Appendix A: Firefox Menu Reference

Back
Takes you back to the last page you visited in the current tab or window. This
is the same as clicking the Back button on the Navigation Toolbar.
This command is unavailable when you’re viewing the first Web site you vis-
ited in the current tab or window.
Shortcuts: Alt+←or Backspace when the page is selected (Ô+←on a Mac)
Forward
Takes you forward one page in history. In other words, suppose you search
Ask Jeeves (www.ask.com) for improving short-term memory and click the
first search result. But by the time the new page finishes loading, you’ve for-
gotten what you’re doing there, so you click Back to return to the search
results page. A few seconds later, you remember again. Now you can click
Forward to return to the page on improving your memory — and please, read
it carefully. This command has the same effect as clicking the Forward button
in the Navigation Toolbar.
This command is unavailable when you haven’t used the Back command and
there are no pages to go forward to.
Shortcut: Alt+→or Shift+Backspace when the page is selected (Ô+→on 
a Mac)
Home
Takes you to your Firefox home page. This is the same as clicking the Home
button on the Navigation Toolbar.
Shortcut: Alt+Home (Option+Home on a Mac)
See Chapters 2 and 16 for more information about what a home page is and
how to set it.
The list of Web sites
After the Home command, the Go menu contains a list of the last ten Web
sites you visited in any Firefox tab or window at any time. Click on any Web
site to load it in the current tab or window. In Windows, do any of the follow-
ing: Shift+click to load it in a new window or Ctrl+click to load it in a new tab.
314
Firefox For Dummies 

If your mouse has a middle button, you can also middle-click a site to load it
in a new tab.
History
Shows or hides the History Sidebar, which contains a list of sites you’ve vis-
ited recently. This command is the same as choosing View➪Sidebars➪History.
Shortcut: Ctrl+H (Ô+Shift+H on a Mac)
See Chapter 6 for more information about the History Sidebar.
The Bookmarks Menu
The Bookmarks menu (shown in Figure A-6) contains your bookmarks list
and allows you to bookmark the current Web page or all Web pages open in
tabs in the current window. You can also open the Bookmarks Manager from
the Bookmarks menu. See Chapter 5 for more information about working with
bookmarks.

Bookmark All Tabs
Adds all of the Web sites open in tabs in the current window to a new folder
in your Bookmarks list. Firefox opens a window so you can select a name and
location for the new folder.
Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+D (Ô+Shift+D on a Mac)
See Chapter 7 for more information about tabbed browsing.
Manage Bookmarks
Opens the Bookmarks Manager, which helps you organize your bookmarks list.
The list of bookmarks
After the Manage Bookmarks menu item, the Bookmarks menu contains your
bookmarks list. Click a bookmark to load it in the current tab or window. In
Windows, do any of the following: Shift+click to load it in a new window or
Ctrl+click to load it in a new tab. If your mouse has a middle button, you can
also middle-click a bookmark to load it in a new tab. Finally, you can right
click on a bookmark to delete it, change its properties, or sort your
Bookmarks menu alphabetically.
The Tools Menu
The Tools menu (shown in Figure A-7) offers access to a variety of helpful
Firefox utilities, such as the Download, Theme, and Extension Managers, and
the (in Windows) Options window.

Selects the Search Box at the right end of the Navigation Toolbar.
If you remove the Search Box using toolbar customization, which I discuss in
Chapter 18, this command opens the window shown in Figure A-8. Type your
search phrase into the Search For text box, and then choose the search
engine you want to use from the drop-down list next to Search With. If you
want the search results to open in a new tab, select the Open Search Results
in a New Tab check box. Finally, click Search to close the window and load
the search results page.

Read Mail
Opens your computer’s default e-mail program. Depending on the e-mail pro-
gram you use, Firefox might be able to detect whether you have new mail. If it
can, it displays the number of new e-mails within the menu item. For exam-
ple, the command might appear as Read Mail (4 new).
This command is only useful if you use an e-mail program, such as Thunderbird
or Outlook, in which case it opens your default program. (See the “Send Link”
section, earlier in this appendix, for instructions on changing your default e-mail
program.) If you read your e-mail on a Web site, ignore this option.
New Message
Opens a new e-mail composition window. This is convenient if you need to
send mail while browsing and don’t want to open your e-mail program.
This command is only useful if you use an e-mail program, such as Thunderbird
or Outlook. If you read your e-mail on a Web site, ignore this option.
This command uses your computer’s default e-mail program. For instructions
on changing the default e-mail program, see the “Send Link” section, earlier in
this appendix.
Shortcut: Ctrl+M (Ô+M on a Mac)
Downloads
Opens the Download Manager, where you can monitor the progress of ongo-

JavaScript Console
Opens the JavaScript Console, where you can see programming errors
reported by Web sites. This window is useful only for Web developers.
Page Info
Opens the Page Info window, which contains a wealth of information about
the current page. This window is intended for advanced users who need to
closely analyze the contents of a Web page.
Clear Private Data
Allows you to clear the information Firefox stores about your surfing, such as
browsing history and saved passwords. Firefox opens a window so you can
choose which types of records to clear. If you clear your information fre-
quently, you can bypass the window to minimize distractions, as I discuss in
Chapter 21.
Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (there is no Mac shortcut)
See Chapters 14 and 21 for more information about clearing your private data.
Options
Opens the Options window, where you can configure many aspects of Firefox.
This command is only available in Windows. On the Mac, choose Firefox
Preferences.
See Chapter 16 for more information about the Options window.
The Help Menu
From the Help menu (shown in Figure A-9), you can access the built-in Firefox
help system, check for Firefox updates, view information about your version
of Firefox, and report broken Web sites to the Firefox team.

Most people using Firefox have switched from Internet Explorer, which is the
default browser on Windows. Chapter 3 includes everything on this page,
plus plenty more.
See Chapter 13 for more on the Firefox help system.
Report Broken Website
Opens the Reporting Wizard, which you can use to inform the Firefox devel-
opers of Web sites that don’t work properly in Firefox. These kinds of failures
are typically the result of a programming error on the part of the Web site’s
developer. In this case, the Firefox team contacts the site developer and
helps him fix the mistake. Sometimes, however, the errors are the result of a
defect in Firefox itself, and these reports help us developers fix the problem.
The Firefox team respects your privacy, and no personal information is pro-
vided to us beyond what you offer if you use this feature. Read our Privacy
Policy in the Reporting Wizard for more information.

Accessing Web Site Elements 
with the Keyboard
Firefox is completely keyboard-accessible, which means anything you can do
with your mouse, you can also do with your keyboard. That’s a pretty remark-
able achievement when you consider all the things you can do with your
mouse in a Web page alone: Select text on the page, click buttons and links,
and select items from drop-down lists, among other things. All this is easy
with a mouse because you can target the element you want to interact with
using the mouse pointer.
Because you don’t have this luxury when you’re using the keyboard, you must
first focus the element you want to interact with. Throughout this appendix,
you can find a number of references to focusing and you might have won-
dered whether I’ve lost my mind. In fact, even though you might not have
heard the term, the concept of focus is common to all software programs,
and you use it all the time. When you focus an element (such as a text box or
a Web page link), you are simply indicating that you want to work with that
particular element by using the keyboard. For example, when you focus a text
box, a flashing cursor appears in the box, and now you can begin typing. This
example points out the three main questions that pertain to focusing:
 How do you focus an element with the keyboard?
 How does an element indicate when it has focus?
 What can you do with a focused element?
To answer the first question, you must be familiar with the concept of Tab
order. When you target an element on a Web page with the mouse, you proba-
bly don’t give much thought to how the page is oriented. You don’t need 
to: The mouse pointer allows you to reach any element easily. However, the
332
Firefox For Dummies 

keyboard offers much less freedom, and so reaching an element takes much
longer. You must focus element by element until you reach the one you want.
You do this by pressing Tab repeatedly. Elements are focused in a left-to-right,
top-to-bottom fashion (approximately), as I demonstrate in Figure B-4, and
this is called the Tab order. To navigate elements in reverse Tab order (in a
right-to-left, bottom-to-top fashion, approximately), you press Shift+Tab. The
reason I say these orders are approximate is because unfortunately, Web
designers have the final say over the Tab order of elements on their pages.
Don’t be surprised if the ordering seems erratic sometimes.
Only one element can have focus at a time. The concept of focus is not lim-
ited to Web page elements; it extends throughout the Firefox interface. For
example, clicking within the Location Bar focuses the bar so you can enter an
address, and whichever element currently has focus (even if it’s part of the
Web page) loses focus.

333
Appendix B: Firefox Keyboard Reference

To know when the element you want to work with is focused, you need to
know how that particular type of element indicates focus. Of course, you’ll
also want to know what you can do with the focused element. Because each
of these things varies among elements, I include a list of focusable elements
in this section.
As if the topic of focus weren’t complicated enough, the situation gets worse.
Unfortunately, the Web designer ultimately has the final say over how a par-
ticular element on his or her page looks when it’s focused. By default, ele-
ments have the appearances I describe in the following list, but the designer
can override the appearance. For example, some designers indicate a focused
link by bolding the text of the link instead of using a dotted rectangle. Because
hundreds of possible styles are available for a designer to use, I can’t cover
them all; it’s just something to watch out for. Fortunately, most designers
stick to the tried-and-true defaults in the following list:
 Web pages themselves: As strange as it sounds, the Web page itself (the
Content area) can have focus. You can scroll the focused page by using
the arrow keys, or select text by holding Shift+←or Shift+→(depending
on the direction in which you wish to select). When text is selected, 
you can use the keyboard shortcuts listed in Table B-3, earlier in this
appendix.
When the Web page has focus, a particular portion of the page actually
has the focus. Which portion is focused controls where selection begins
when you use the text selection method I describe. To see which part of
the page has focus, you can turn on a flashing cursor, just like the flash-
ing cursor you see in focused text boxes. This is called Caret Browsing,
and you can activate it by pressing F7, or by setting an option in the
Advanced category of the Options window, as I discuss at the end of
Chapter 16.
Firefox focuses a page automatically when it finishes loading. If you then
focus the Search Box or the Location Bar (by clicking within either), you
can restore focus to the page by pressing the Tab key once or twice, or
by clicking an empty spot within the page. Unfortunately, the Web page
is the only element that doesn’t indicate when it has focus (a bug we
developers hope to fix soon). Try ↑and ↓; if the page scrolls, it has
focus.
When the page has focus, pressing Tab focuses the first element within
the page. Pressing Shift+Tab focuses the Search Box in keeping with the
reverse Tab order of right to left, bottom to top.
 Links: When a link has focus, its text is surrounded by a dotted, rectangu-
lar border, as shown in Figure B-5. You can load the Web page pointed to
334
Firefox For Dummies 

by the focused link by pressing Enter. To load the page in a new window,
press Shift+Enter. To load the page in a new tab, press Ctrl+Enter
(Windows) or Ô+Return (Mac). (Just as when you open a link in a new tab
using the mouse, the new tab is not automatically selected.) To save the
linked page to your computer instead of following the link, press Alt+Enter
(Windows) or Option+Return (Mac), and then select a destination and file-
name in the window that appears.
 Buttons: When a button has focus, its text is surrounded by a dotted,
rectangular border, as shown in Figure B-5. You can click the focused
button with the keyboard (execute whatever command the button exe-
cutes when clicked) by pressing the spacebar.
 Drop-down lists: When a drop-down list has focus, its text is surrounded
by a dotted, rectangular border, as shown in Figure B-5. You can cycle
through the other items in the focused list one-by-one, upward or down-
ward, by pressing the up- or down-arrow keys. You can cycle through the
list in intervals of 20 by pressing Page Up or Page Down. If the list has
fewer than 20 items, Page Up selects the first item in the list, and Page
Down selects the last. You can also press Home to select the first item or
End to select the last, which works even in lists of more than 20 items.
 Regular lists: When a regular list has focus, the selected item in the list
is surrounded by a dotted, rectangular border, as shown in Figure B-5.
Because the selection color tends to be dark, this border can be hard to
see, but it’s there if you look closely. You can select another item in the
focused list by pressing the up or down arrow until you reach it. To navi-
gate the list more quickly, press Page Up or Page Down. You can also
press Home to select the first item in the list or End to select the last.
 Text box: When a text box has focus, it contains a flashing cursor, as
shown in Figure B-5. You can type text into a focused text box, and it is
inserted at the location indicated by the cursor. To select text on either
side of the cursor, hold down Shift+←or Shift+→(depending on the
direction of the selection) until the desired text is selected. Then you
can use the keyboard shortcuts that I list in Table B-3, earlier.
 Check box: When a check box has focused, its box is surrounded by a
dotted, rectangular border, as shown in Figure B-5. You can select or (if
it’s currently selected) deselect a check box by pressing the spacebar.
 Radio button: A radio button is similar to a check box, but it is part of a
group in which only one option can be selected. Thus, radio buttons are
used for mutually exclusive options. For example, many online forms use
two radio buttons to allow visitors to specify their gender. (The name
radio buttons is a throwback to old car radios, from which large buttons
protruded. Pressing one button popped the other buttons out.)
335
Appendix B: Firefox Keyboard Reference

When a radio button has focus, its circle is surrounded by a dotted
border, as shown in Figure B-5. You can select an adjacent radio button in
the group by pressing any of the four arrow keys depending on the direc-
tion in which the other button lies. To select a button in the group that’s
further away, just continue pressing the arrow key until you reach it.

omputer features are rarely intuitive, but drag-and-drop is one of those
features that just feels right. It mimics the real-world experience of
moving an item from one spot to another: Simply pick it up by pressing the
mouse button, move it by moving the mouse, and put it down by releasing
the mouse button over the new location. The Firefox philosophy is that any-
where drag-and-drop could work, it should work. This appendix outlines the
possibilities, and I keep it short and sweet — just like drag-and-drop.
Getting to Know Drag-and-Drop
Most people are familiar with drag-and-drop from other programs, but in case
you aren’t, I walk through the process with a brief example. In the following
steps, you load a Web page by dragging a link:
1. Navigate to a Web site normally.
Google (www.google.com) or Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org)
would be good for practice.
2. Drag a link by moving the mouse pointer over it and holding down
the left mouse button.

338
Firefox For Dummies 
Do not release the button.
3. Move the mouse pointer to the Go button that sits to the right of the
Location Bar.
Notice that as you move the mouse pointer over the page, the arrow
turns into a “no” sign (the circle with a line through it). This sign means
that you can’t drop the link at that spot. When the pointer reaches the
Go button, it returns to being an arrow and shows a tiny box to indicate
that you can drop on the Go button.
4. Release the mouse button.
Firefox loads the page that the link led to. Of course, this is a rather silly
example, because you could simply have clicked the link to load the
page. However, I want to start with something that has no side effects so
you can get the hang of it.
Getting to the Good Stuff
I use the term link in this section to refer to both normal Web page links and
other items that point to Web sites. For example, bookmarks, history items,
files, and even text that happens to be an address (for example, http://
www.google.com) are all considered links here.
Furthermore, the tiny picture to the left of an address in the Location Bar
(see Figure C-1) is a link to the current page, and you can drag it.
For example, the red Y! here is the Yahoo! logo. If Firefox can’t find a picture
to represent the current site, it uses a generic one, that also acts as a link, as
shown here.
Loading a link in a tab or window
To load a link in a tab or window, drag and drop it onto the Location Bar, the
Go button, or (if you’re using tabs) the tab.
The draggable link image
Figure C-1:
The Yahoo!
draggable
link image.

Loading a link in a new tab
To load a link in a new tab, drag and drop it onto an empty part of the tab bar.
To load it in an existing tab, drag and drop it onto the tab. See Chapter 7 for
more information about tabbed browsing.
Adding a link to your bookmarks
You can add a link to your bookmarks in a few different ways. If the
Bookmarks Sidebar is open, you can drag and drop a link onto it. As you
move the mouse pointer over it, a solid line indicates the drop location, as
shown in Figure C-2.
The line indicates where
the bookmark will be created.

Appendix C: Firefox Drag-and-Drop Reference

If you’re using Windows, you can also drag and drop a link right into the
Bookmarks menu. Simply begin to drag, move the mouse pointer to 
the Bookmarks menu, and pause for a second. The menu opens, and 
then you can drop the link in the desired spot. To add a bookmark to 
your Bookmarks Toolbar, drag and drop it onto the desired spot.
Downloading a file
To download a file with drag-and-drop, the Download Manager (Tools➪
Downloads) must be open and positioned alongside the Firefox window. Simply
drop a link to the file into the manager to begin the download.
Searching for text
Select and then drag text out of a Web site and drop it onto the Search Box at
the right end of the Navigation Toolbar to begin a search. Firefox uses what-
ever search engine is currently selected.
Setting your home page
To change your Firefox home page, drag and drop a link to the page you want
to use onto the Home button on the Navigation Toolbar. When Firefox asks
you to confirm the change, click Yes. For more information about home pages,
see Chapter 2.
Creating a desktop shortcut
Your computer desktop contains shortcuts to applications that you double-
click every day. In the same way, you can add shortcuts to Web sites, and
double-click them to load the Web site in Firefox. To create a shortcut, ensure
that the desktop is visible, and then drag and drop a link to the desktop. For
example, to create a shortcut to the page you’re viewing, drag the little icon
at the left end of the Location Bar out of the Firefox window, and drop it onto
the desktop.
Because you must be able to see both the Firefox window and the desktop to
complete the drag-and-drop, your Firefox window cannot be maximized. Click
the little Restore Down button in the top-right corner to un-maximize it.

Customizing your toolbars
Firefox provides powerful tools to reshape your toolbars. First, open the
Customize Toolbar window (View➪Toolbars➪Customize). To add buttons to
your toolbars, drag and drop them from the Customize window to the desired
spot. To remove buttons from your toolbars, drag and drop them from the
toolbar to the Customize Toolbar window. For more information about tool-
bar customization, see Chapter 18.
Rearranging your tabs
When you open a new tab, Firefox positions the tab to the right of all your
existing tabs. However, you might often find that you want to group related
tabs together to switch between them quickly. To move a tab to a new posi-
tion on the tab bar, simply drag and drop it to the desired position. As you
drag the tab along the bar, a purple arrow indicates the new position of the
tab should you decide to drop it there, as shown in Figure C-3.
Extending Drag-and-Drop Further
If you’re an advanced drag-and-dropper, the Firefox Super Drag and Go exten-
sion offers even more drag-and-drop fun. For example, it allows you to drag-
and drop a link on a page half an inch in any direction to open it in a new tab.
Likewise, you can drag and drop text half an inch in any direction to search
for it on the Web. The extension is available in the Navigation and Tabbed
Browsing categories of the official Mozilla Update page. After you install it, 
be sure to check out its options window for all the things you can do.
One other neat extension deserves a mention, even though it isn’t strictly a
drag-and-drop extension — more just drag. It’s called Grab and Drag, and it’s
a novel approach to scrolling Web pages. The simple act of scrolling has seen
The insertion arrow
Figure C-3:

drag a tab to
a new spot
on the tab
bar.

Appendix C: Firefox Drag-and-Drop Reference

a number of innovations over the past decade. Where you once had to reach
for the scroll bar along the window edge, you can now scroll without moving
the mouse, thanks to scroll wheels (or buttons) featured by most modern mice.
But scrolling itself remains somewhat jerky and can be distracting when you’re
intently reading a long document line by line.
With Grab and Drag, you scroll a page simply by grabbing it (beginning a drag
in an empty part of the page) and dragging it up, down, left, or right depend-
ing on the direction you want to scroll. The farther you move the mouse from
the place where you began the drag, the farther the page scrolls. As confusing
as this might sound, it’s very intuitive when you try it out because it mimics
the tactile experience of sliding a long scroll up or down along a table. It’s 
a great way to scroll long documents because you control how much of the
document to scroll, and the experience is as smooth as your drag. All the 
traditional scrolling mechanisms, such as the scroll bar and mouse wheel,
continue to work as usual.
When Grab and Drag is enabled, you can’t select text on a Web page (because
selection requires the same kind of grabbing action). To temporarily disable
Grab and Drag so you can select text, choose Tools➪Toggle Grab and Drag,
or press Alt+Shift+Delete (Option+Shift+Delete on a Mac). To turn Grab and
Drag back on, do the same thing.
See Chapter 20 for more information about installing and configuring 
extensions.
